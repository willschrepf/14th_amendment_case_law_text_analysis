Code. Crim. Proc. Art. 11.071, filed simultaneously with his\n\nproposed Findings and Conclusior:ts, has previously stated, these proceedings were\n\nrendered unfair because of the Court's refusal to recuse itself, its refusal to admit\n\nthe reports of Applicant's expert witnesses and its denial of prompt and adequate\n\nfunding with which Applicant could develop his case. The fact-finding\n\nprocedures and rulings of the Convicting Court repeatedly impaired Applicant's\n\nability to adequately prepare and develop his case and to have his Grounds for\n\nRelief fairly considered in these TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.071 capital\n\n                                     Page 2 of 51\n\fhabeas corpus proceedings. In a~dition to his previously stated objections, which\n\nApplicant now renews, he makes further objection to the Order of February 12,\n\n2015, which adopted almost in their entirety the State's proposed Findings and\n\nConclusions.\n\n       While state habeas courts are given discretion over the methods of\n\ndeveloping and receiving evidence to resolve contested factual claims, see, e.g.,\n\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.071, § 9(a), such discretion is circumscribed by\n\nthe necessity that the fact-finding procedures be adequate for reaching reasonably\n\ncorrect results. Ex parte Davila, 530 S. W.2d 543, 545 (Tex. Crim. App. 1975)\n\n(citing Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 316 (1963)). Since the fact-finding\n\nprocedures here were not adequate, and the Convicting Court has largely adopted\n\nthe State's Findings and Conclusions despite the fact that they are flawed in many\n\nways, this Court should reconsider its rulings.\n\n       This Court is asked to remc;:dy several fundamental errors in this case,\n\nnamely:\n\n        I)     The Convicting Court Should Have Recused Itself from Presiding\n               over These Art. 11.071 Proceedings; 1\n\n       1\n         As discussed in Applicant's Petition for Writ of Mandamus of July 9, 2014 at 32-38, of\nwhich a copy is attached and which is incorporated herein by reference, the avenues by which to\nraise for review the denial of a Motion to Recuse filed during Art. 11.071 proceedings are\nunclear. Without mandamus relief, such proceedings continue to be presided over, as they have\nhere, by a judge who should have been recused, and whose findings of fact and conclusions of\n\n                                         Page 3 of 51\n\f       2)      The Convicting Court Adopted the State's Proposed Findings of Fact\n               and Conclusions of Law and Recommendations almost in their\n               entirety and with virtually no amendment, thereby abdicating from its\n               proper role of\"neutral arbiter\" of the proceedings;\n\n       3)      The Convicting Court Denied Applicant an Adequate Opportunity to\n               Develop the Factual Basis for His Grounds for Relief Because of the\n               Court's Consistent Failure to Provide Timely and Adequate Funding\n               with Which Applicant Could Develop His Case.\n\n       4)      The Convicting Court Rendered the Proceedings Unfair by Refusing\n               to Admit the Reports ofExpert Witnesses Who Were Unable to\n               Testify Solely Because ofThe Timing Limitations Imposed upon this\n               Case.\n\n\n\n\nlaw must be revisited. The issue of recusal is urged again in these objections, which are being\nfiled simultaneously in the Court of Criminal Appeals, in order to ensure that Applicant's\nobjection to the conduct of these proceedings before a judge who should have been recused is\npreserved.\n\n                                          Page 4 of 51\n\fl)    The Convicting Court Should Have Recused Itself from Presiding over\n      These Art. 11.071 Proceedings.\n\n      On May 27,2014, Applica~t's Counsel filed a Motion for the Court to\n\nRecuse Itself, which was denied. The case was therefore assigned to the Hon. J.R.\n\n\"Bobby\" Flores of the 139lh District Court of Hidalgo County, for a hearing on the\n\nmotion to recuse. The hearing was conducted on June 16, 2014. On July 3, 2014,\n\nJudge Flores entered an order denying the motion to recuse. Judge Flores denied\n\nthe Motion to Recuse on July 3, 2014, without stating reasons for his decision, and\n\nApplicant subsequently, on July 8, 2014, sought leave to file a motion for writ of\n\nmandamus against Judge Flores, and commanding him to vacate his \"Order\n\nDenying Applicant's Motion to Recuse 370lh District Court Judge Noe Gonzalez\"\n\nand to enter an Order recusing the Court. The Court of Criminal Appeals denied\n\nleave to file the motion for writ of mandamus on July 18, 2014.\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals did not deny the Petition for Writ of\n\nMandamus on its merits, and Applicant continues to maintain that this Convicting\n\nCourt should have recused itself.\n\n      The grounds for the recusal motion were that the Court's impartiality might\n\nreasonably be questioned, and that it had personal knowledge of disputed\n\nevidentiary facts. The gist of the factual allegations were that the Court and its\n\nbailiff, Alicia \"Licha\" Salinas, engaged in prejudicial off-the-record\n\n                                     Page 5 of 51\n\fcommunications with the jury during the trial, in the jury room, and outside the\n\npresence of counsel or the defendant.\n\n       The subject matter of the communications included the concern of jury\n\nmembers about their personal safety in this gang-related case in which the jury\n\nwas required to answer the \"future dangerousness\" special issue, TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC. Art. 37.071. The actions of the Court and bailiff formed part of the subject\n\nmatter of Applicant's Grounds for Relief Four, Five and Six, which included\n\nallegations of'~ury misconduct, including the exposure of the jury to outside\n\ninfluences.\" Because of the Convicting Court's failure to provide funding\n\n(discussed further below) few of the jurors could be interviewed while the\n\nApplication was being prepared, and such interviews as were conducted were done\n\nby volunteer law students. Some subsequent investigation of the case revealed\n\nthat former jurors would indeed testify that both the Court and its bailiff engaged\n\nin off-the-record communications with the jury during the trial, in the jury room,\n\nand outside the presence of counsel or the defendant. Those communications\n\nconcerned, among other things, the Court stating that gangs may threaten and\n\nfollow jurors, and the bailiff telling the jurors, in response to their security\n\nconcerns, that the Court carried a gun.\n\n      Since both the Court and its bailiff's actions were an integral part of the\n\n\n                                      Page 6 of 51\n\fpleaded grounds for relief, the basis for the motion to recuse was that, in the\n\ncircumstances the Court's ability to adjudicate impartially a ground for relief\n\nconcerning its own and its bailiffs conduct \"might reasonably be questioned,\" and\n\nalso that \"the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\n\nconcerning the proceeding\", TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b (b)(l) and (3). Applicant objects\n\nboth to the Court's initial and continuing failure to recuse itself and to Judge\n\nFlores' subsequent denial of the Motion to Recuse, and urges that the question of\n\nrecusal be reconsidered and reviewed.\n\n      Moreover, the Court's handling of the underlying issues during the\n\npendency of the case and in the subsequent Findings and Conclusions further\n\ndemonstrates that the Court's impartiality might reasonably be questioned: In\n\naddition to refusing to recuse itself, Court refused even to be interviewed by\n\ncounsel concerning the allegations concerning outside influences on the jury and\n\nwould only answer a few questions from counsel about what it stated its general\n\ncourtroom practices to be. See Letters from undersigned counsel to the Court\n\ndated July 29, 2014, and August 3, 2014, filed on August 5, 2014. Thus, counsel\n\nwas prevented from discovering relevant facts, and could not, of course, call the\n                                   .\nCourt as a witness in the proceedings, because of the absence of prior discovery,\n\nand because ofTEX. R. EVID. 605, which prohibits a sitting judge from appearing a\n\n\n                                       Page 7 of 51\n\fwitness.\n\n       Furthermore, some of the very few amendments made by the Court to the\n\nState's proposed Findings and Conclusions included truncating the factual\n\nnarrative of Ms. Palacios and Ms. Guerrero's accounts of what had happened as\n\nset out by the State in its proposed Findings and Conclusions: Compare State's\n\nproposed Findings and Conclusions at 528-539, with the Court's Findings and\n\nConclusions at 528-530, which eliminate paras. 562-90 of the State's drafting,\n\namong other material.2 The Court then simply dismissed the former jurors'\n\ntestimony as not supporting \"a finding that the jury was exposed to improper\n\ncomment from this Court or its staff,\" and added that it \"agrees with Judge Flores'\n\nimplicit findings on credibility.\" Findings and Conclusions at para. 566, p. 529.\n\nThe Court also added that \"The evidence at the recusal hearing does not support a\n\nrecusal,\" id., thereby volunteering an opinion in its own favor on a legal question\n\nit was not called upon to answer. However, precisely because the Court's own\n\nintegrity and that of its staff member were being called into question, these\n\nfindings cannot be relied on as being impartially made. The jury-related claims\n\n\n       2\n         The Court also inserted some facts concerning the recusal proceedings, see, e.g., Court's\nFindings and Conclusions at 528. Applicant does not suggest that he agrees with the State\ndrafted material that was redacted, but emphasizes that the Court's concern to edit this discrete\npart of the State's voluminous pleading demonstrates why the Court's impartiality may properly\nbe questioned.\n\n                                          Page 8 of 51\n\fare discussed again at pp. 600-604, and the Court again redacted some of the\n\nState-drafted material. Paragraph 66 in the Court's version removes even the\n\nexplicit mention of material supporting both the recusal motion and Applicant's\n\n                                      3\njury-related grounds for relief.\n\n        Moreover, Applicant notes that Ms. Salinas was called by the State at the\n\nhearing on the motion to recuse and her testimony might properly have been\n\nconsidered by Judge Flores with regard to the recusal issue. However, Ms.\n\nSalinas was neither called by the State in person at the August 20 14 evidentiary\n\nhearing, nor was the transcript of her recusal hearing testimony offered into\n\nevidence by the State for the purpose of these underlying Art. 11.071 proceedings,\n\nwhich are governed by the \"Texas Rules of Criminal (sic) Evidence,\" see Art.\n\n11.071 § I 0. Applicant, on the other hand, had the transcripts of the recusal\n\nhearing testimony of jurors PalaciosNera and Guerrero correctly admitted into\n\n\n\n       3\n          Despite discussing the case law at length, neither the State nor the Court address the fact\nthat the communications with the jwy by the Court and bail iff in this case were ones which\nconstituted an \"outside influence\" on the jury, evidence as to which would be admissible under\nTEX. R. EVID. 606(b)( I). Nor is any attempt made to objectively analyze the prejudice to\nApplicant from those communications, as required by McQuarrie v. State, 380 S.W.Jd 145, 153-\n4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (reversing and remanding for further proceedings where outside\ninfluence had potentially had negative impact on jury's verdict). Colyer v. State, 428 S.W.Jd 117,\n129-30 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014)(affirming objective \"reasonable person\" test as measure of\nimpact of outside influence on hypothetical average jurors). Rather para. 71, p. 603, seems to\ndirectly contradict those authorities. The. findings and conclusions concerning this ground for\nrelief therefore cannot stand, and are objected to.\n\n                                           Page 9 of 51\n\fevidence. See Order on Motion to Deem Stipulated Evidence Formally Admitted\n\nof August 29, 2014. The Court in these habeas proceedings properly only had\n\nbefore it the affidavits, declarations and testimony of various former jurors,\n\nuncontradicted by anything to which Ms. Salinas testified. In this situation,\n\nwhatever factors underlay Judge Flores' decision, this Court- or rather, a different\n\njudge presiding over this matter subsequent to this Court's recusal- should have\n\narrived at its own estimation of the credibility of the former jurors rather than\n\nsimply adopting the supposed \"implicit\" findings contained in Judge Flores\n\nsimple statement that recusal was denied, and contained no findings of fact or\n\nconclusions of law. Indeed, Judge Flores' ruling may not have rested on\n\ncredibility at all, or on any other matter relevant to these habeas proceedings.\n\n      For these reasons, Applicant objects to the Court's Findings and\n\nConclusions, which must be revisited.\n\n\n2)    The Convicting Court Adopted the State's Proposed Findings of Fact\n      and Conclusions of Law and Recommendations Almost in Their\n      Entirety and With Virtually No Amendment, Thereby Abdicating from\n      its Proper Role of \"Neutral Arbiter\" of the Proceedings.\n\n      The Court adopted the State's proposed Findings and Conclusions virtually\n\nwithout emendation or correction except, as noted above, with regard to\n\ninformation concerning issues that Applicant contends should have led to the\n\n                                    Page 10 of 51\n\fCourt's recusal and to the grant of relief on his allegations concerning outside\n\ninfluences on the jury. Those parts of the State's proposed Findings and\n\nConclusions that the Court did adopt overlook copious evidence that undennines\n\nthe State's findings, and the many logical flaws in the State's submissions. A\n\nprime example is the finding concerning trial counsel's preparation of the case, at\n\np. 511:\n\n      523. This Court was not privy to infonnation concerning the steps\n      which not privy to infonnation concerning the steps which (sic-\n      repetition in original) Applicant's trial attorneys, Ralph R. Martinez\n      and Libra do \"Keno\" Vasquez took to investigate the underlying\n      criminal case, including any conversations they may have had with\n      Applicant, members of his family, or other potential witnesses, and\n      thus must rely on Mr. Martinez' and Mr. Vasquez' credible testimony\n      concerning this topic.\n\n      This \"finding\" overlooks the fact that in no case is a trial judge ever likely\n\nto be privy to the details of defense case preparation, and that if such knowledge\n\nwere a prerequisite to the grant of habeas relief, relief would probably never be\n\ngranted. Moreover, the Court overlooks the many affidavits from potential\n\nmitigation witnesses either overlooked by trial counsel or from whom trial counsel\n\nfailed to elicit pertinent facts, as well as court and other records concerning\n\nApplicant's background and that of his family. See, e.g., Applicant's Exhibits 4,\n\n5, 10-29, 37-50, 54-73, and Applicant's Hearing Exhibits 2-3. The only reason\n\n\n                                     Page 11 of 51\n\fthat the Convicting Court stated it \"must\" rely on counsel's testimony is, logically,\n\nthat is the testimony that supported the State's position. This ignores the wealth of\n\ninformation undermining the State-drafted Findings and Conclusions. In addition\n\nto the affidavits from family members, the information before the Court included\n\npsychological reports created during Applicant's adolescence, Applicant's\n\nExhibits 18 and 19, and the affidavit of Applicant's former TYC (Texas Youth\n\nCommission, now Texas Juvenile .Justice Department) caseworker, which\n\nindicated that Applicant had serious psychological problems and came from a\n\nfamily background that contributed to those problems. Applicant's Exhibit 70,\n\nAffidavit of Jeanette Brothers.\n\n      There is no indication that the Court actually considered the content of\n\nApplicant's mitigation evidence developed in these habeas proceedings as\n\nexposing trial counsel's flawed and cursory case preparation or the prejudice\n\ncaused to Applicant by trial counsel's performance: Although those four volumes\n\nof exhibits are listed and described at pp. 78-282, they are barely mentioned or\n\ndiscussed in the actual Findings and Conclusions. The Findings and Conclusions\n\nsigned by the Court do not therefore amount to the work of an impartial court\n\naffording a full and fair proceeding and fairly supporting its findings by reference\n\nto the actual record of the case. A post-conviction court must actually consider\n\n\n                                    Page 12 of 51\n\fmitigation evidence brought before it, and may not unreasonably discount the\n\nimpact of such evidence by assuming that because, for example, it might be in\n\nsome way imperfect, it should be disregarded entirely. Porter v. McCollum, 558\n\nU.S. 30, 37, 42-43 (2009) (perceived problems w:ith cognitive testing and with\n\nevidence of alcohol abuse and abusive childhood did not justify \"discount[ing]\n\nentirely the effect that testimony might have had on the jury.\").\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals in Ex parte Reed, 271 S.W.3d 698,729\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2008) warned that a convicting court that does not act as a\n\nneutral arbiter and carefully scrutinize the State's proposed findings to ensure that\n\nthey accurately reflect the record of a case can unnecessarily complicate that\n\nCourt's independent review. Reed, 271 S. W.3d at 729; See also Ex parte\n\nSimpson, 136 S.W.3d 660,668 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)(emphasizing importance\n\nof convicting court's role in habeas proceedings). The United States Supreme\n\nCourt has also criticized courts for \"their verbatim adoption of findings of fact\n\nprepared by prevailing parties/' Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 572\n\n( 1985), and has recently remanded such a case for further review of the procedures\n\nby which such a decision was made. Jefferson v. Upton, 560 U.S. 284,\n\n294(20 I O)(remanding for determination whether state court factual findings\n\nwarranted presumption of correctness).\n\n\n                                   · Page 13 of 51\n\f      The practice of convicting qourts simply adopting the State's proposed\n\nFindings and Conclusions completely, or almost completely, is not unique to the\n\n370111 District Court of Hidalgo County, but is prevalent across this State: See Ex\n\nparte Christopher Chubasco Wilkins, Tarrant County, WR-75~229-01 (findings\n\nsigned on December 22, 201 0); Ex parte Steven Anthony Butler, Harris County,\n\nWR-41,121-02 (findings signed on February 28, 20I2); Ex parte Cortne Robinson,\n\nHarrison County, WR-81,583-01 (findings signed on Aug. 25, 2014); Ex parte\n\nMark Soliz, Johnson County, WR-82,429-01 (findings signed on Nov. 6, 2014);\n\nEx parte Garland Harper, Harris County, WR-81,576-01 (findings signed on Dec.\n\nII , 20 14) and Ex parte Gary Green, Dallas County, WR-81 ,575-0 1 (findings\n\nsigned on Dec. 31, 20 14).\n\n      This practice undermines the principle that the Texas courts should provide\n\nan impartial and independent system for review of convictions and sentences. It\n\nalso defies the statutory   instructio~   that \"Every provision relating to the writ of\n\nhabeas corpus shall be most favorably construed in order to give effect to the\n\nremedy, and protect the rights of the person seeking relief under it.\" TEX. CODE.\n\nCRIM. PROC. Art. 11.04. Furthermore, it results in a denial of due course of law\n\nunder Art. I, s. 19 of the Texas Constitution, especially given that the Texas\n\nhabeas statute specifically mandates protection of\"the rights of the person seeking\n\n\n                                     . Page 14 of 51\n\frelief,\" and also denies due process under the United States Constitution.\n\n      Moreover, the relevant Findings and Conclusions signed by the Court do\n\nnot suggest that they have been the subject of careful scrutiny. In fact the content\n\nof its 63 7 pages is sometimes jumbled, with for example, a brief discussion of the\n\nlaw pertaining to Ground for Relief 14 inserted between a 16-page narrative\n\nconcerning the Court of Criminal Appeals' recent case law on TEX. R. Evm.\n\n606(b), at pp. 511-527, and discussion of Grounds for Relief 4-6 concerning\n\noutside influences on the jury, to which TEX. R. Evm. 606(b) is pertinent, at pp.\n\n528-530. Between pages 332 and 584 there are 252 pages of text discussing\n\nmultiple grounds for relief, unrelieved by a single subheading, and frequently\n\ndiscussing either the facts or the law without even explaining to the reader which\n\nground for relief is being dealt with.\n\n      Some examples of the many respects in which these largely State-drafted\n\nfindings did not merit the Court's signature are given below, specifically in regard\n\nto Applicant's allegation that counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the\n\nsentencing phase of his trial:\n\na)    Unwarranted Reliance on Trial Counsel's \"Credibility\".\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions rely throughout on the rote recitation of the\n\nword \"credible\" to describe trial counsel's testimony and on their attribution of\n\n\n                                     Page 15 of 51\n\fstrategic reasons for their actions and inactions. They fail, however, to address\n\nwhether counsel's explanation of their \"strategies\" and actions in fact\n\ndemonstrated \"reasonable professional assistance,\" given contradictory facts in the\n\nrecord. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689-690 (1984). Even if counsel\n\nwere \"credible\" in the sense that the Court believed them to be sincere, and even if\n\ntheir explanations, taken in isolation, sounded facially plausible, it is imperative\n\nthat any court reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance should come to a\n\ndetermination based on the totality of the facts of the individual case. /d.\n\n      As discussed further in the sections below, there are irreconcilable\n\ndiscrepancies between counsel's- particularly lead counsel's- assertions and\n\nactions at Applicant's trial, assertions during the evidentiary hearing and the other\n\nfacts and evidence available to counsel. For example, the Findings and\n\nConclusions state that trial counsel did not want to introduce psychological reports\n\ncreated during Applicant's adolescence because he wanted to avoid the jury\n\nhearing of\"Applicant's anti-social behavior and his gang involvement.\" Para. 407\n\nat 463-64; para. 26, 29 at 590-91; para. 48 at 596-97. However, lead counsel\n\nhimself at trial referred to Applicant as \"enforc[ing] things that maybe - that\n\ndefinitely were anti-social,\" 35 RR 9, and the jury heard copious evidence of\n\nApplicant's gang involvement during the guilt phase of trial, rendering counsel's\n\n\n                                    Page 16 of 51\n\fsubsequent explanation illogical.\n\nb)    Failure to Investigate and Present Evidence in Mitigation of Sentence.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions are contradictory in that they quote, for\n\nexample, the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Performance of\n\nCounsel in Death Penalty Cases (Rev. Ed. 2003 ), 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. 913 (2003)\n\nadvocating that counsel should retain an investigator, a mitigation specialist and\n\nother professional expertise and conduct a \"comprehensive pretrial investigation.\"\n\nFindings and Conclusions at pp. 402-03, but then endorse counsel's failure to\n\nretain a mitigation specialist, p. 461, and to simply conduct an investigation\n\nhimself in the short time available before the trial commenced. The Findings and\n\nConclusions in fact assert that trial counsel were fully prepared for Applicant's\n\ncapital murder trial and sentencing, para. 11, p. 586, despite counsel's preparation\n\nhaving consisted almost entirely of reading the State's file, speaking to Applicant\n\nand some family members, and performing legal research. Para. 12, p. 587. This\n\nflies in the face of many of the authorities set out in the Findings and Conclusions\n\nat, e.g., pp. 402-420 and 491-510, including the ABA guidelines and Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 706 (1986)(\"[C]ounsel's general duty to investigate ...\n\ntakes on supreme importance to a defendant in the context of developing\n\nmitigating evidence to present to a judge or jury considering the sentence of\n\n\n                                    Page 17 of 51\n\fdeath\"); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510,537 (2003)(counsel ineffective for failing\n\nto investigate and present mitigating evidence of petitioner's life history);\n\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000), Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 382\n\n(2005) and Ex parte Gonzalez, 204 S.W.3d 391,393-400 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2006)(Cochran, J., concurring), which demonstrate the importance of an\n\nindependent, thorough and extensive investigation in a capital case.4\n\n       The Findings and Conclusions claim that trial counsel had \"valid reasons\"\n\nfor not obtaining the services of a mitigation specialist including lead counsel's\n\nbelief that he could do his own mitigation investigation, his assertion that there\n\nwas not that much mitigation evidence available and that he had spoken to\n\nApplicant, Applicant's family and \"church people,\" and that Applicant had denied\n\nhaving problems with his father other than neglect. They also describe as \"valid\"\n\ncounsel's choice to simply tell the family members they interviewed that they\n\nneeded to know about \"problems,\" \"mental issues\" or any other types of issues.\n\nPara. 16, 17,46 and, p. 587-88, 596. This ignores the copious mitigation evidence\n\nthat was in fact readily available and was presented in these Art. 11.071\n\n\n       4\n        Given that the Court sat on the committee that oversaw the creation of the State Bar of\nTexas Guidelines and Standards for Texas Capital Counsel, Texas Bar Joumal966-982\n(November 2006) which largely mirror the ABA guidelines, the Findings and Conclusions'\nendorsement of trial counsel's minimalist investigation as ''thorough\" provides additional ground\nto conclude that these statements are not the product of a neutral arbiter carefully scrutinizing a\nproposed order to ensure an accurate reflection of the record and application of legal principles.\n\n                                          Page 18 of 51\n\fproceedings. It again ignores the very case law and guidelines cited by the State\n\nitself in these Findings and Conclusions, which undennine the Findings and\n\nConclusions' description of counsel's investigation as \"thorough.\" Para.\n\n17 at p. 588.\n\n      The discrepancies between the assertions oflead counsel that Applicant's\n\nfamily had failed to tell him significant infonnation, or had given him different\n\ninfonnation from that contained in their later affidavits, p. 462, should have been\n\ngiven little weight: Lead counsel testified that he had asked Applicant's mother\n\nand family only indirectly about \"problems\" affecting applicant, and\n\nacknowledged that people are sometimes embarrassed or slow to disclose\n\nembarrassing things in their background, and that people with alcohol problems\n\nmay not necessarily recognize them as such. 2 EHRR 125-130. His cocounsel,\n\nKeno Vasquez recalled that counsel had met the family in a group, with counsel\n\nsometimes taking an individual family member aside. 3 EHRR 59.         He recalled\n\nlead counsel asking the family to talk about Applicant's childhood, but did not\n                                  .\nrecall any specific questioning about sexual abuse, substance abuse, or about\n\nApplicant being suicidal, neglected by his mother or exposed to trauma other than\n\nthe murder he had witnessed. 3 EHRR 28-29. While Keno Vasquez' affidavit of\n\nFebruary 8, 2013 indicates, \"Discussed everything with Defendant and family,\" in\n\n\n                                      Page 19 of 51\n\fresponse to a question about whether these and other specific topics were\n\ninvestigated, Affidavit at p. 15, his hearing testimony clarified that these specific\n                                    '\ntopics were in fact not discussed. Indeed, Mr. Vasquez, who made it clear in both\n\nhis hearing testimony and his affidavit that Mr. Martinez had had primary\n\nresponsibility for the case, stated that had he been lead counsel, he would have\n\nlooked closer into everything possible and explored issues such as Applicant being\n\nleft alone by his mother. 3 EHRR 30-32.\n\n      Lead counsel claimed during the hearing that Applicant's family had\n\nconveyed to him that Applicant h~d a \"nice, warm happy home,\" 2 EHRR 118,\n\nand that Applicant's mother, who counsel relied on as their primary source of\n\nmitigation information, was \"a great mom,\" 2 EHRR 242, who calmly handled the\n\npressure of having a son facing the death penalty. 2 EHRR 122. Those assertions\n\nare belied by Applicant's psychological reports and TYC records, by the multiple\n\naffidavits of family members and others describing Applicant's mother's poor\n\nparenting, and by counsel's own statement to the jury that Lydia Garza was a\n\n\"deficient\" and neglectful mother. 35 RR 8. Moreover, an ordained minister,\n\nSalomon A vii a, describes Applicant's mother as \"in a bad way\" and \"extremely\n\nstressed and fearful,\" prior to her son's trial. Exhibit 42 at 3-4. The Findings and\n\nConclusions then condone as reasonable counsel's unquestioning acceptance of\n\n\n                                        Page 20 of 51\n\fstatements made by Applicant's family members about his having had a good and\n\nhappy upbringing, and denial or silence concerning familial alcohol related\n\nproblems and Applicant's suicide attempts Para. 20-21, p. 589. That this reliance\n\nwas unreasonable is demonstrated by the copious evidence that would have been\n\navailable to counsel had they used a qualified and competent mitigation specialist\n\nto review records and thoroughly interview an appropriate range of witnesses\n\nextending beyond Applicant's immediate maternal family.\n\n      Applicant and his family may have failed to volunteer information, or not\n\nhave been perfectly accurate or co~sistent in what they told counsel, but that does\n\nnot automatically excuse counsel's failings. Counsel had no mental health\n\ntraining and no capital mitigation investigation experience and failed to hire\n\nanyone who could supplement those deficiencies. Preparation time was severely\n\nlimited, but counsel did not move for sufficient additional time, and did not have\n\nconducted the kind of repeated, in-depth one-on-one interviews, informed by\n\ntraining and prior records review, that might have been more fruitful. See, e.g.,\n\nState v. Herring, _ _ N.E.3d _·, 2014 Ohio 5228, 2014 Ohio LEXIS 3074 *51-\n\n52 (Ohio December 3, 2014)(defendant's failure to be forthcoming did not excuse\n\ntrial counsel from conducting a mitigation investigation).\n\n      The conclusions, para. 34-36, p. 593, attribute strategic validity to the\n\n\n                                    Page 21 of 51\n\fsupposed decisions by counsel not to present evidence that Applicant's mother\n\nneglected him in favor of her boyfriend, or that she had taken into her home a\n\nviolent adult male criminal who was later shot in front of Applicant. The\n\njustification for these decisions is asserted as being that Applicant's mother had\n\ndenied exposing her son to negative influences, had claimed to be a good mother,\n\nwhich was what counsel wanted the jury to hear and that she had failed to mention\n\nthe shooting. This \"strategic\" explanation is undermined by the fact that counsel\n\nthemselves described Applicant's mother as \"deficient\" and as having both\n\n\"spoiled\" and \"neglected him because of her relationships,\" 35 RR 7-8, but failed\n\nto substantiate those assertions. Moreover, presenting Applicant as being the child\n\nof a good mother would logically fail to explain the negative and criminal\n\ntrajectory of his life as being the product of his upbringing rather than simply the\n\nresult of his own voluntary choices. As the affidavits provided in support of the\n\nwrit application demonstrate, Applicant's mother did consistently give priority to\n\nher husband and boyfriends rather than her child, failed to protect him, exposed\n\nhim to a wide range of criminal behavior and left him to his own devices for days\n\nor weeks at a time when he was as young as ten or eleven. See, e.g., Applicant's\n\nExhibits 4, 13 and 15, Affidavits of Lydia Garza at 6, Jennifer Cavazos at 4,\n\nJuanita Matthews at 2. The mere fact that, in conversation with counsel,\n\n\n                                    Page 22 of 51\n\fApplicant's mother might have had told them she had not left Applicant alone and\n\nwas a \"good mother,\" 2 EHRR 126, cannot excuse their failure to investigate\n\nfurther.\n\n       Moreover, counsel's claim that Applicant's mother did not tell them about\n\nthe shooting is not credible: She and the widow of the deceased were friends, 35\n\nRR 91, there was no reason Applicant's mother would have withheld the\n\ninformation, which she states that she did give to counsel- See Affidavit of Lydia\n\nGarza, Exhibit 4 at para. 81, and counsel elsewhere admitted that Applicant's\n\nmother had identified for them which witnesses they should call. 2 EHRR 274.\n\n       That the Findings and Conclusions's characterization of counsel's decision-\n\nmaking as based on valid strategy and a thorough mitigation investigation is\n\nillogical is further demonstrated by their treatment of Applicant's report of\n\nconcerns, as a teenager, of\"being pushed into sex.\" Para. 23, p. 590. The State's\n\nFindings and Conclusions claim that counsel was right not to present evidence on\n\nthat issue because of damaging facts contained in the same report in which that\n\nconcern was mentioned. See App~icant's Exhibit 18, Report of Dr. L.R. Fricke, p.\n\n2. This ignores two facts: (1) that counsel never even asked their own client to\n\nexplain what he had meant when he spoke of being \"pushed into sex,\" 2 EHRR\n\n132-34, and (2) that information in such reports can simply provide a basis for\n\n\n                                    Page 23 of 51\n\fother investigation without actually being introduced into evidence. Given that\n\ncounsel did not give Applicant's statement even enough thought to simply ask him\n\nwhat he had been talking about, which might have allowed them to discover, e.g.\n\nthe sexual abuse Applicant had experienced during his childhood- see, e.g.,\n\nApplicant's Exhibit 10, Affidavit of Edna Wilma Garza- their decision not to\n\npursue that investigative avenue, or present a more expansive mitigation case,\n\nshould not be dignified as the pursuit of a valid strategy.\n\nc)     Mental Health Evidence and Use of Experts.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions purport to validate trial counsel's failure to\n\nhave Applicant evaluated by a mental health professional because Applicant and\n\nhis family supposedly said he had no mental health issues and because counsel -\n\nwho had no training in the field of mental health - recognized no indication of\n\nsuch problems. Para. 18, 20, 25, 27, p. 588-91. The conclusions state that\n\ncounsel were reasonable to rely on their personal belief that Applicant was\n\nintelligent and their lack of perception that he had any problems. Para. 19, 27 p.\n\n588-89, 591. Psychological reports, which had been disclosed by the State, put\n\ncounsel on actual notice that Applicant's mental health had caused prior evaluators\n\nserious concern, not least because of the consequences of his witnessing the\n\nmurder of a family friend - a fact that counsel themselves identified as sufficiently\n\n\n                                    Page 24 of 51\n\fimportant to Applicant's development to have presented evidence of it at\n\nsentencing. See Applicant's Exhibit 18 (TYC Psychological Evaluations}; 35 RR\n\n80-95, Testimony of Blanca Cortez.\n\n      Paras. 27, 28, 47, p. 591, 596, of the Findings and Conclusions state that\n\ncounsel were reasonable to rely on what was said by Applicant and his family\n\nmembers, in deciding that Application had no mental health issues and that his\n\nmother was a \"great mother,\" and a constant and supportive presence in his life\n\nwith no alcohol-related issues, because they had no reason not to believe what\n\nthey were told. Again, this assertion is obviously illogical when Applicanfs\n\npsychological reports and TYC records are actually taken into account: they\n\ndemonstrate a troubled upbringing by a neglectful mother and recommendations\n\nthat Applicant receive further testing and treatment for problems that were already\n\nevident. See Applicant's Exhibit 18. Counsel had no reason to disbelieve the\n\nreports and records but did not investigate or follow up on this independent source\n\nmaterial in any way. Rather, counsel claimed to have accepted what they were\n\ntold by family members at face value even when what they were told was\n\ncontradicted by the earlier reports; prepared by mental health professionals, and by\n\nthe records compiled by TYC case workers.\n\n      In a notable contradiction of the conclusions in paras. 28 and 47, discussed\n\n\n                                   Page25 of 51\n\fabove, the conclusion at para. 52, p. 598, states that counsel \"properly relied\" on\n\ninformation received from Applicant and his family that Applicant's mother had\n\nnot wanted him, had tried to terminate her pregnancy with him, and had left him to\n\nfend for himself as a child, that there was severe substance abuse within the\n\nfamily, and that Applicant had attempted suicide by cutting his wrist, and had\n\nemotional problems and depression and abused drugs. There is no indication in\n\nthe trial record whatsoever reflecting that counsel relied on this information in any\n\nway, and the inherent contradictions among the various paragraphs of the State-\n\ndrafted Findings and Conclusions are irreconcilable.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions describe as a \"valid strategic decision\"\n\ncounsel's decision not to utilize any experts \"for fear that doing so would open the\n\ndoor to the prosecution's use of hypothetical situations that would emphasize\n\nApplicant's gang involvement and [admitted) extraneous offenses.\" Para. 19, 29,\n\np. 588, 591. The characterization as \"valid\" and \"strategic\" is absurd: Counsel\n\ndid not explain what the feared \"hypotheticals\" might consist of other than\n\nreferences to guns or gangs, 2 EHRR 167-68, factors ofwhich the jury would have\n\nbeen aware from the guilt phase evidence. Nor did they explain how the State\n\ncould further emphasize Applicant's gang involvement and extraneous offenses\n\nwhich formed a large part of the guilt phase evidence. This conclusion also\n\n\n                                   Page 26 of 51\n\fignores the fact that it is possible to use experts to assist in case preparation\n\nwithout necessarily choosing to call them to testify, and that such consultation has\n\nbeen deemed a sine qua non of capital representation: See Commentary to ABA\n\nGuidelines, The Defense Team and Supporting Services: Guideline 4.1 which\n\nstates that \"mental health experts are essential to defending capital cases ...\n\ncreating a competent and reliable mental health evaluation consistent with\n\nprevailing standards of practice is a time consuming and expensive process.\n\nCounsel must compile extensive historical data, as well as obtaining a thorough\n\nphysical and neurological examination.\"\n\n      Similarly, the Findings and Conclusions excuse as a valid strategy counsel's\n\nfailure to present evidence of Applicant's post-traumatic stress disorder and\n\ndepression because the reports from which counsel would have known of those\n\nmental disorders contained material about Applicant carrying a gun and having\n\nengaged in \"anti-social behavior.\" Paras. 25-26, 48, pp. 590-591, pp.596-97.\n\nLeaving aside that the reports themselves need not necessarily have been\n\nintroduced into evidence, the jury in fact became aware, at and before sentencing,\n\nof just such negative information about Applicant. What trial counsel failed to\n\nprovide to the jury was any coherent explanation of why Applicant had developed\n\nas he had. Failing to provide such an explanation because of what counsel\n\n\n                                     Page 27 of 51\n\fdeclared was a concern about introducing damaging material was an inadequate\n\nresponse to the State's case which was already laden with negative information. 5\n\nIndeed, Applicant's undesirable practice of carrying a gun could have been readily\n\nexplained had the jury been informed about his troubled background, not least that\n\nit was the father for whom Applicant \"yearned,\" according to trial counsel, 35 RR\n\n7, who had constantly exposed Applicant as a child to firearms, drug-trafficking\n\nand many other undesirable influences and activities. See Applicant's Exhibits 39,\n\n40, 41, 43 Affidavits of George Morales, Eddie Garza, David Garza, Raul Herrera,\n\nJr.\n\nd)     Gang Evidence and Applicant's Statements.\n\n       The Findings and Conclusions assert that \"Trial counsel also made a valid\n\nstregic (sic) decision to keep evidence of Applicant's alleged gang involvement\n\nand drug involvement out of Applicant's case.\" Para. 15, p. 587. This overlooks\n\nthe State's guilt phase presentation of comprehensive evidence of those very facts,\n\nsee, e.g., 30RR 154-65,31 RR 1-2,31 RR53-67,31 RR 70-91;31 RR209-17,31\n\nRR 200-25, 32 RR 1-20, and that defense counsel themselves established, during\n\n\n       5\n         As the Tennessee Supreme Court recently remarked, in a case reversed for ineffective\nassistance in a capital sentencing: \"Counsel held in their hands compelling evidence that [the\nApplicant) has a broken brain and a tragic past ... [t]he evidence from [Applicant's] mental health\nrecords held little to demean him further in the jury's eyes. However, it had great potential to\nexplain the invisible mental machinations that made him behave this way.\" Davidson v. State,\n_ S.W.3d _ , 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 918 * 42-44 (Tenn. Nov. 17, 2014).\n\n                                          Page 28 of 51\n\fthe guilt phase, that the Texas Syndicate is a gang, 31 RR 129, and that\n\nApplicant's imprisoned father, was a founder member of the Texas Syndicate, 31\n\nRR 213, which information counsel had the same witness repeat on cross-\n\nexamination, 32 RR 34. Counsel then referred to the same facts in his punishment\n\nphase opening. 3 5 RR 7.\n\n      The conclusion that counsel were reasonable to bring out that Applicant's\n\nfather was a negative influence but without actually investigating or \"emphasizing\n\nsaid matters,\" para. 30-31, 33 p. 592, for fear of bringing out information about the\n\nfather's previous convictions and gang activities, is another lapse in logic that\n\nshould not be upheld. Given that counsel did not know in advance what\n\nApplicant's father's criminal   reco~d   consisted of, or what was in his records, their\n\n\"know-nothing\" approach of not even investigating that background information\n\ncannot be deemed \"strategic.\" Moreover, as explained above, the jury was made\n\naware that Applicant's father was a founder of the Texas Syndicate gang, and the\n\nevidence of Applicant's own gang involvement was comprehensively presented to\n\nthe jury during the trial on the merits. Counsel otherwise described Applicant's\n\nfather to the jury as \" a violent man, extensive involvement,\" 35 RR 7, but\n\nwithout further explanation or evidence. Further explanation of the early\n\ninfluences at play in Applicant's life would have helped to demonstrate that\n\n\n                                     Page 29 of 51\n\fApplicant's criminal activities were attributable in large part to the absence of any\n\npositive role model or other support in his early life.\n\n      This Court should also reject the conclusion that trial counsel made a valid\n\nstrategic decision not to introduce evidence about Applicant's father because \"they\n\nhad not wanted any gang evidence in this case and had instead wanted to limit this\n\ncase to the statement which Applicant had made and to argue that there was not\n\nenough to prove the case,\" Para. 33, p. 592-93. Applicant's statement was the\n\nvery source of much ofthe evidence ofhis gang involvement. It had been\n\nintroduced at the guilt phase through the testimony of Detective Alvarez, 30 RR\n\n154- I 66, 31 RR 1-204; Agent Bukowski, 31 RR 205-26, 32 RR 20-53, and\n\nDetective Ochoa, 32 RR 54-185, and Applicant's admissions had presumably been\n\naccepted by the jury that had now convicted Applicant. It was not logically or\n\nlegally possible to ask the jwy to ignore that evidence for the purpose of\n\nsentencing. What was therefore relevant for trial counsel would have been to try\n\nto mitigate Applicant's sentence. Evidence of a dysfunctional family background\n\nand early exposure to criminal activities is precisely the kind of evidence that has\n\ntypically been viewed as mitigating, see, e.g., Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. 945, _ ,\n\n130 S.Ct. 3259,3264 (20IO)(counsel ineffective for failure to introduce evidence\n\nof abusive upbringing and that petitioner's brother introduced him to life of crime)\n\n\n                                    Page 30 of 51\n\fand trial counsel's failure to investigate and present such evidence cannot be\n\njustified by concerns that would only have been pertinent at the outset of the guilt\n\nphase.\n\n         The conclusion stating that it was sound strategy for counsel to rely at\n\nsentencing on a theory that the State had not proved its case beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt, para. 49, p. 597, is similarly insupportable. Indeed, this conclusion stands\n\nin marked contrast to that in para. 56, p. 599, which declares, \"The record of\n\nApplicant's case demonstrates that the jury had made a finding, based on the\n\nevidence, that Applicant was a major participant in the killings involved and had\n\nthus rejected any claim that Applicant's role had merely been peripheral.\" This\n\nCourt should have rejected these essentially contradictory conclusions.\n\ne)       Use of Applicant's Prison Records.\n\n         The conclusion that failing to challenge evidence of Applicant's\n\ndisciplinary violations in prison was a \"valid strategic decision\" because the\n\nevidence would have been admitted anyway, Para. 37, p. 593-94, cannot stand.\n\nLogically, a total absence of disciplinary violations suggests that an inmate is less\n\ndangerous than one who has only some violations. Therefore, in the context of a\n\ncapital sentencing, the goal shoulct have been to exclude all such evidence, rather\n\nthan to fail altogether to challenge it. At least one argument for exclusion existed:\n\n\n                                      Page 31 of 51\n\fthe Confrontation Clause. See Russeau v. State, 171 S.W.3d 871, 880-81 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2005)(Confrontation Clause violated when State did not show that\n\nprison officials were unavailable to testify and defendant had no opportunity to\n\ncross-examine them concerning their testimonial statements). Moreover, contrary\n\nto counsel's other asserted justification for their failure to challenge the evidence,\n                                    .\nthe violations in question included violent acts, among them a stabbing. State's\n\nExhibits 430, 440A.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions also state that counsel were implementing a\n\n\"valid strategic decision\" in not presenting prison records including certificates\n\nthat presented Applicant in a positive light as humorous and well-liked and as\n\nhaving completed courses in prison, for fear of the State introducing \"unfavorable\n\naspects\" of Applicant's prison life'. Para. 39, p. 594. However, counsel had\n\nactually tried, but failed, to introduce the certificates through Applicant's mother,\n\n35 RR 135- 6, undermining their claim of\"strategy.\" Moreover, the purported\n\n\"strategy\" was groundless when the State had already introduced into evidence\n\nApplicant's prison disciplinary record and parole file, counsel could not identify\n\nany further negative incident that was not in the record, and could have introduced\n\nthe records under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. 2 EHRR\n\n172-78.\n\n\n                                     Page 32 of 51\n\f       Further examples of conclusions that should not be approved by this Court\n\nare at para. 38, p. 602, which asserts that counsel made a sound decision not to call\n\n\"too many, witnesses, including family witnesses, because they might mention\n\nother incidents or extraneous offenses involving Applicant. Trial counsel did not,\n\nhowever, point to any such actual incident or offense. Moreover, their belief that\n\nApplicant's statement \"absolved\" him of intent to commit the murders, Para. 38, p.\n\n594, was misplaced, given that the jury had just found him guilty of the murders.\n\nThat counsel \"felt\" that the jury would not give the death penalty even if it\n\nconvicted Applicant, Para. 38, p. 594, also does not represent a sound strategy: a\n\n\"feeling\" is simply not a strategy that justifies limiting the investigation and\n\nevidentiary presentation in a case involving a six-victim homicide.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions assert that trial counsel made a valid\n\nstrategic decision to argue that Applicant had experienced a religious conversion.\n\nPara. 14, p. 587. There was, however, no evidence to support that argument. The\n\nhearing testimony oflead counsel that Applicant's religious devotion had changed\n\nover time is simply not borne out by the trial record or other evidence. While\n\ncounsel claimed that he presented evidence of a jailhouse conversion, that was\n\napparently based on such conversions being \"a generally accepted phenomena\n\n(sic) that I personally believe in, but occurs in the minds of the jurors, who might\n\n\n                                     Page 33 of 51\n\f3)    The Convicting Court denied Applicant an Adequate Opportunity to\n      Develop the Faetual Basis for His Grounds of Relief Because of the\n      Court's Consistent Failure to Provide Timely and Adequate Funding\n      with Which Applicant Could Develop His Case.\n\n      Successive counsel representing Applicant on both Direct Appeal and in\n\nthese Habeas Corpus proceedings attempted from the earliest days_ following\n\nApplicant's conviction and death sentence to obtain sufficient funding with which\n\nto conduct a proper investigation relevant to both stages of Applicant's trial, and\n\nconcerning events occurring during the trial itself. The need for such funding was\n\nparticularly acute because the original attorney retained on Applicant's behalf,\n\nCharles Banker, and the actual trial attorneys, Ralph R. Martinez and Librado\n\n\"Keno\" Vasquez, failed to utilize any investigators, mitigation specialists or other\n\nexpert assistance in the preparation of Applicant's trial.\n\n      Subsequently, Applicant's Direct Appeal counsel, F. Alan Futrell, filed a\n\nmotion for investigative funding, seeking to investigate issues of juror misconduct\n\nin connection with a potential Motion for New Trial, on April 5, 2005, less than\n\ntwo weeks after Applicant was sentenced to death. I CR 982-92. The Convicting\n\nCourt did not rule on that Motion.\n\n      In due course, both former habeas counsel, John E. Wright, and current\n\nhabeas corpus counsel, the undersigned, filed numerous applications for\n\ninvestigative funding and funding for expert services in order to develop\n\n                                     Page 35 of 51\n\fApplicant's claims, repeated requests for rulings on those applications and\n\nrepeated requests for payment for the individuals involved. Those Applications\n\nand requests to the trial court, most of which were made ex parte and under seal,\n\nare herein incorporated by reference and include those filed on: May 11, 2005;\n\nOctober 30, 2006; December 19, 2006; March 8, 2007; June 19, 2007; July 5,\n\n2007; July 12, 2007; August 2, 2007; September 24, 2007; March 5, 2008; April\n\n25, 2008; March 19, 2013; June 17, 2013; July 30, 2013; August 13, 2013;\n\nNovember 7, 2013; January 21, 2014; April 28, 2014; May 2, 2014; June 12,\n\n2014; July 22, 2014; July 24, 2014; August 12, 2014 and October 17, 2014.\n\n      This Court repeatedly failed to rule on the applications that were filed,\n\nnecessitating counsels' further written requests for rulings. Because former\n\ncounsel was located in Huntsville and the undersigned is located in Austin,\n\nhundreds of miles from Hidalgo County, visiting the Court to try to obtain rulings\n\nwas logistically extremely difficult for counsel. Because of the difficulty in\n\nobtaining funding from this Court, counsel for Applicant were obliged to resort to,\n\ne.g., using volunteer law students to assist in interviewing and investigation (see,\n\ne.g., Application for Funding of July 12, 2007, requesting expenses for student\n\ninvestigators - no ruling obtained), and to conducting investigation themselves,\n\nsee, e.g., Ex parte letter to the Court filed on September 18,2013. Even such\n\n\n                                    Page 36 of 51\n\ffunding as could be obtained had to be justified in great and time-consuming\n\ndetail, see, e.g., Ex parte letter to the Court filed on December 10, 2013.\n\n      At one point, the Court of Criminal Appeals ordered this Court on April 7,\n\n2014, to rule on all outstanding motions within thirty days. That was not done.\n\nUltimately, it was only after the hearing in this case, on September 9, 2014, that a\n\nformal order denying then-outstanding requests for expert and investigative\n\nassistance was entered. Another request for funding, filed on November 7, 2013,\n\nand including a request funding for the mitigation specialist/investigator working\n\non the case was only granted in part, despite counsel's detailed explanation of the\n\nwork that remained to be done. Undersigned counsel attempted to make\n\nincremental requests for funding, see, e.g., January 24, 2014, Unopposed Motion\n\nfor Extension of Time at 14, since her predecessor's request for larger amounts at\n\none time had not been ruled upon, let alone granted. Moreover, to try to ensure\n\nthat rulings were obtained, counsel visited the Court in person to discuss the\n\nrequested funding and present orders for signature, and sent repeated requests for\n\nrulings on outstanding items. In many instances, counsel repeatedly sought\n\nfunding, but was unable to secure a prompt ruling, when the Court ruled at all.\n\nWhen funding was granted it was generally in amounts smaller than those\n\nrequested, even where the need for the funding had been explained clearly and in\n\n\n                                    Page 37 of 51\n\f       Applicant's efforts to obtain sufficient funding for development of his case\n\nwere also discussed in Motions for Extensions of Time and Advisories filed on his\n\nbehalf in the Court of Criminal Appeals on December 28, 2012; June 21, 2013;\n\nand January 21, 2014.\n\n       Because of counsel's inability to obtain necessary funding, the work\n\nperformed on behalf of Applicant fell far short of the comprehensive investigation\n\nand development of his case mandated by caselaw, statute and relevant guidelines.\n\nSee January 24, 2014, Unopposed Motion for Extension of Time at 8-16.\n\nConsequently, Applicant was unable to adequately investigate and to present\n\nevidence that would assist in demonstrating entitlement to relief with regard to\n\nnon-record based claims in his Application, such as Grounds for Relief I and 3,\n\nconcerning trial counsel's ineffective assistance in preparing for and conducting\n\nthe sentencing phase of Applicant's trial; Grounds for Relief 4-6, concerning the\n\nhostile atmosphere in the courtroom and the outside influences brought to bear on\n\nApplicant's jury; Grounds for Relief 15-16, concerning trial counsel's failure to\n\ninvestigate and prepare for the hearing on a Motion to Suppress Applicant's oral\n\n\n       ~is convicting court failed entirely to pay the mitigation specialist who obtained the\noriginal mitigation affidavits filed with the Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus in 2007~ and\nsubsequently again declined to pay that mitigation specialist when requested to do so by the\nundersigned.\n\n                                          Page 38 of 51\n\fstatements, and Grounds for Relief 17-19, concerning trial counsel's failure to\n\ninvestigate and litigate the admissibility of the testimony of the State's witnesses\n\nconcerning gang activities.\n\n      As explained in, inter alia, .Applicant's January 21, 2014, Unopposed\n\nMotion for Extension of Time, and accompanying Ex Parte Advisory to the Court,\n\ncomprehensive investigation is necessary in capital cases, both at trial and in\n\nhabeas corpus proceedings, and the availability of adequate funding appears to\n\nhave a direct correlation with the likelihood of success in capital litigation.\n\nApplicant's ability to prevail in this litigation was compromised throughout by the\n\nCourt's refusal to provide such funding or to timely rule on motions for funding.\n\nApplicant therefore objects to this Court's entry of these Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions ofLaw and Recommendation.\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 39 of 51\n\f4)    The Convicting Court Rendered the Proceedings Unfair by Refusing to\n      Admit the Reports of Expert Witnesses Who Were Unable to Testify\n      Solely Because of The Timing Limitations Imposed upon this Case.\n\n      Of great importance to Applicant's sentencing case was the issue of the\n\nimpainnent to his mental functioning brought about by his mother's alcohol use\n\nwhile he was in utero. In order to·demonstrate the role that his mother's alcohol\n\nuse had played in his mental and personal development, Applicant unsuccessfully\n\nsought the admission into evidence of his Exhibits 34-36, the reports of experts\n\nneuropsychologist Paul D. Connor, Ph.D., psychiatrist Richard S. Adler, M.D.,\n\nand psychologist Natalie Novick Brown, Ph.D. Those experts had evaluated\n\nApplicant following the suggestion of Dr. Craig Henderson, a psychologist who\n\ninterviewed Applicant in 2007 and recommended a comprehensive\n\nneuropsychological evaluation. See Exhibit 22. Dr. Henderson had suggested that\n\nApplicant might have a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), given his\n\nmother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy and his previous psychological\n\ntest results. Dr. Richard Adler did subsequently diagnose such a disorder in\n\nApplicant, and the excluded reports explain the nature ofF ASDs, the factors that\n\nled to the diagnosis being made, and the impact of Applicant's FASD on his life\n\ntrajectory and choices.\n\n      Applicant filed the reports of Drs. Adler, Brown and Connor, along with\n\n\n                                   Page 40 of 51\n\fother exhibits, on May 27,2014. Although it had indicated that it would stipulate\n\nthe admissibility of numerous other exhibits, the State of Texas did not state until\n\nit wrote a letter to undersigned counsel dated July 23,2014, that it would not\n\nstipulate to the admissibility of these reports.\n\n      The State indicated in its letter that it was not agreeing to stipulate the\n\nexpert reports because it would have no opportunity to cross-examine the experts\n\nconcerning their qualifications, their methodology or the validity of their work,\n\nand because it believed that it had been given insufficient notice of the subject\n\nmatter of their reports.\n\n      The Court having set a date for an evidentiary hearing commencing August\n\n6, 2014, Applicant's counsel checked the available dates on which the experts in\n\nquestion could testify. None of them were available at all before the beginning of\n\nOctober 2014, and the earliest date on which one of them would be available was\n\nmid-December 2014. 2 EHRR 26. The three experts were unable to testify at the\n\nlive evidentiary hearing conducted on August 6-7, 20 14, solely because their prior\n\nprofessional commitments prevented them from testifying until after a deadline\n\nimposed by the Court of Criminal Appeals in an Order of July 18, 2014, requiring\n\nthat Applicant's case be completed and forwarded to that Court on or before\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 41 of 51\n\fAugust 31, 2014. 7 Thus, because of the incompatibility of that time constraint and\n\nthe availability of his experts, Applicant was unable to call them to testify.\n\n       The Court heard arguments concerning the admissibility of the reports\n\nduring the hearing conducted on August 6-7, 20 14, 2 EHRR 26 - 47, and\n\nsubsequently permitted the parties to file submissions concerning admissibility. 3\n\nEHRR 65-69. The State argued for the first time in its post-hearing briefing that:\n\n        (a)    The reports failed to demonstrate that the experts were relying on the\n               proper application of the methods involved in their field;\n\n       (b)     The reports failed \"to assert that the tests conducted were normed to\n               the population of either South Texas or to prison populations or death\n               row inmates in particular;\"\n\n       (c)     The reports were \"hearsay without exception,\" citing TEX. R. EVJD.\n               802-804.\n\n       The Court initially signed an Order on August 29, 2014, holding the reports\n\nto be inadmissible on two grounds: (1) that the third prong of the criteria for\n\nadmissibility set out in Nenno v. State, 970 S.W.2d 549, 561 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1998) was not met, i.e., that Applicant had not established that the experts's\n\nreports properly relied upon and/or utilized the principles involved in their field\n\n\n        'Counsel for the parties were obliged to file two joint motions in the Court of Criminal\nAppeals, seeking additional time for the preparation of the proposed Findings and Conclusions\nwhich were ultimately filed on September 30, 2014. Then, in response to a letter request for\nadditional time filed by the Convicting Court on October 13, 2014, the Court of Criminal\nAppeals eventually extended the time for completion of the case to November 13,2014. The\nproposed findings of fact and conclusio~s of law and the record of these proceedings have not\nbeen filed in the Court of Criminal Appeals as oftoday's date, March 19, 2015.\n\n                                          Page 42 of 51\n\fand (2) that the State would not have an opportunity to cross-examine the experts.\n\n      Having reviewed Applicant's subsequently filed Motion to Reconsider\n\nAdmissibility of Expert Reports and supporting materials, the Court later\n\nacknowledged that the criteria for admissibility under TEX. R. EVID. 702 and\n\nNenno had been met, but still declined to admit the reports into evidence because\n\nto do so denied the State the opportunity for cross-examination of these three\n\nexperts. However, the State never suggested any actual flaw in these experts'\n\ncredential, nor any Jack of relevant expertise, or shortcoming in the reports that\n\nthey produced, other than querying whether the tests utilized in evaluating\n\nApplicant were normed on appropriate populations. That concern was\n\nsubsequently addressed in an affidavit from Dr. Connor, dated August 26, 2014,\n\nand was not referred to by the Court when it declined to admit the expert reports.\n\n      Thus, significant expert reports concerning potentially mitigating evidence\n\nin Applicant's case were excluded solely because of the Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals' deadline.\n\na)    Affidavit Testimony is Admissible in Habeas Corpus Proceedings\n\n      A trial court has discretion to admit affidavit evidence in TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC. Art. 11.071 proceedings. Under Art. 11.071 § 9(a) it may admit affidavits,\n\ndepositions and interrogatories, and has wide latitude as to the means of resolving\n\n\n                                    Page 43 of 51\n\fthe issues in the case. See, e.g., Ex parte Fierro, 934 S.W.2d 370, 371 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1996)(considering evidence obtained by means ofLetters Rogatory).\n\nThus, the admission of these reports was well within the Court's discretionary\n\npowers, and the state failed to identify any substantive flaw in their reasoning or\n\nmethodology, the results arrived at or their creators' credentials.\n\nb)    Notice of Expert Testimony\n\n      The State claimed a lack of notice concerning the reports. However, the\n\ntopic of\"Fetal Alcohol   Syndrome~'   was specifically raised in the July 17, 2007,\n\nReport of Craig Henderson Ph.D., filed as Exhibit 22 to Applicant's 2007\n\nApplication for Writ of Habeas Corpus, and in which Dr. Henderson\n\nrecommended \"a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation,\" in light of\n\nApplicant's mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy and of Applicant's\n\nschool records and previous psychological testing. Familial alcohol and substance\n\nabuse are mentioned in Claim Three of the Application itself and in supporting\n\naffidavits, together with a statement from former counsel for Applicant John E\n\nWright at p. 70, that he had filed applications for funding for expert and\n\ninvestigative assistance. As Mr. Wright stated, such funding was needed in order\n\nto enable Applicant to fully present his claim.\n\n      The Henderson report similarly makes reference to depression/dysthymic\n\n\n                                      Page 44 of 51\n\fdisorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and trauma, all concepts developed in the\n\nthree more recent expert reports. Thus, the State had notice that those issues were\n\nlikely to be further developed in Applicant's case.\n\n      The State has been aware since late 2012 that undersigned counsel was\n\nworking on the case and was also aware that Applicant had sought extensions of\n\ntime in which to develop support for the Application. However, the State did not,\n\nat any point prior to the filing of the three expert reports on May 27,2014, seek to\n\ndiscover what expert testimony might be in preparation.\n\n      Under TEX. CODE CRJM. PROC. Art. 39.14(b) counsel may move for the\n\ncourt for an order for their adversary to disclose the name and address of potential\n\nexperts, not later than the 201h date before a trial begins. The State made no\n\nequivalent request in this case, and had notice prior to the hearing - exceeding by\n\nthree times the 20 day period set out in the rule- of these experts' names, their\n\ncontact details and the actual substance of their testimony.\n\n      Even at the time of the hearing, the State had apparently made no effort to\n\nenlist any expert assistance of its own to formulate a substantive critique of, or\n\nchallenge to, the three expert reports. It suggested absolutely no specific\n\nshortcoming in these experts' work other than their supposed failure to\n\ndemonstrate that they were relying on the proper application of the methods\n\n\n\n                                    Page 45 of 51\n\finvolved in their field when they assessed Applicant, and that their reports did not\n\nassert that the tests conducted were normed to specific populations - a supposed\n\nshortcoming whose relevance the State failed entirely to explain and which the\n\nCourt rejected when it ultimately ruled that the Nenno criteria were satisfied.\n\nThus, the State's protestation of lack of sufficient notice should be disregarded.\n\nc)    An Expert Opinion May be Supported by Hearsay Evidence\n\n      TEX. R. EVID. 703 states that, \"If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts\n\nin the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts\n\nor data need not be admissible in evidence.\" Thus, these expert reports were not\n\ninadmissible because they are based on information and data narrated or created\n\nby people other than the experts in question.\n\n      Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has affirmed that state hearsay\n\nrules must not be applied mechanistically to exclude reliable hearsay evidence so\n\nas to defeat the ends of justice. In Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. 945, _ , 130 S.Ct. at\n\n3263 n.6 (20 10), the applicant presented evidence, both lay and expert, concerning\n\nhead trauma, substance abuse and traumatic experiences, in addition to evidence\n\nthat Sears' brother introduced him to a life of crime. Although some of this\n\nevidence was hearsay, that did not undermine its probative value or admissibility\n\nin terms of sentencing.\n\n\n                                    Page 46 of 51\n\f        The evidence in Sears was rightfully not excluded by strict operation of\n\nhearsay provisions, but admitted, considered and given effect owing to its possible\n\nrelevance when assessing counsel's deficiency. ld. at 3262-3264. The Supreme\n\nCourt noted that the exclusion ofl)ighly relevant evidence on a critical issue in the\n\npunishment phase of trial may violate due process, regardless of state evidentiary\n\nrules. See also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284,302 (1973); Green v.\n\nGeorgia, 442 U.S. 95,97 (1979).            Similarly here, the critical question ofwhether\n\ncounsel provided effective representation at sentencing in this capital case\n\nmilitates in favor of admission, and proper consideration, of these reports. 8\n\n       This position is supported by state law also: TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art.\n\n11.04 states: \"Every provision relating to the writ of habeas corpus shall be most\n\nfavorably construed in order to give effect to the remedy, and protect the rights of\n\nthe person seeking relief under it.\" Likewise, in a capital sentencing, the court\n\nmay admit \"any matter that the court deems relevant to sentence,\" so long as that\n\nis consistent with the Constitutions of the United States and of the State ofTexas.\n\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 37.071§ 2(a)(l). The Court should therefore have\n\n\n\n       8\n        It should be noted that the three experts stated in their supplemental affidavits that the\nmaterials on which they relied are of exactly the type that are relied on by other professionals in\ntheir fields, demonstrating that they were following the same methods used by equivalent\nprofessionals and that reliance on e.g. affidavits from family members is considered reasonable\nin their respective fields.\n\n                                           Page 47 of 51\n\fexercised its discretion under Art. 11.071 § 9(a) to admit these reports.\n\n       Applicant had the burden of proof in this TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art.\n\n11.071 proceeding to prove not only that his attorney's performance was deficient,\n\nbut that he was thereby prejudiced. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n687-88 (1984). These exhibits were a component part ofhis mitigation case,\n\nreflecting what could and should have been presented at trial, and he now\n\ntherefore reargues the admission of the reports either on remand to the Convicting\n\nCourt or in the Court of Criminal Appeals. Applicant objects to the unfairness of\n\nthe Convicting Court's ruling, and particularly so because the Convicting Court\n\nentered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that do not recommend relief on\n\nApplicant's Ground for ReliefThtee, concerning the ineffective assistance of trial\n\ncounsel in preparing and presenting mitigating evidence.\n\n       While the progress of this case has been protracted, and it is now nearly ten\n\nyears since Applicant was sentenced to death in March 2005, it bears noting that\n\nhalf of that time period is attributable to the failure of the State of Texas to file an\n\nAnswer to his Application, which was timely filed on July 19, 2007. The State's\n\nAnswer was not filed until November 12, 2012, over five years later, and only\n\nafter the Court of Criminal Appeals, on August I, 2012, had ordered this Court to\n\nresolve remaining issues and conclude the case.

See, e.g., Exhibit 36, Report\n\nof Dr. Natalie Novick Brown at 32-43.\n\n      Applicant hereby renews his objection to the arbitrary exclusion of this\n\nsignificant evidence due to factors for which he should bear no responsibility.\n\nSuch a result does not comport with the due process requirement that the fact-\n\nfinding procedures be adequate for reaching reasonably correct results, Ex parte\n\nDavila, 530 S.W.2d 543, 545 (Tex. Crim.

J .R.\n\n\"Bobby\" Flores, of the 139th District Court of Hidalgo County, Texas, arising out\n\nof a motion to recuse the presidingjudge ofthe 370th District Court of Hidalgo\n\nCounty, Hon. Noe Gonzalez, in a capital habeas corpus proceeding filed pursuant\n\nto TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art.§ 11.071.\n\n       The Relator seeks an order commanding the Respondent to vacate his Order\n\nDenying Applicant's Motion to Recuse 370th District Court Judge Noe Gonzalez,\n\nsigned and entered on July 3rd, 2014, and to enter an Order recusing Judge\n\nGonzalez.\n\n       The Relator also seeks a temporary stay of the proceedings in the 370th\n\nDistrict Court, in order to permit this Court to resolve the issues presented in this\n\npetition.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -xii-\n\f                       STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n      Jurisdiction of this Honorable Court is invoked pursuant to TEX. CON ST.\n\nArt. V, § S(c); TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 4.04, § 1; TEX. R. APP. P. 72.1; and\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 52. Thomas v. Stevenson, 561 S.W.2d 845, 847 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1978)(amendment of TEX. CONST. Art. V, § 5(c) provides this Court with power to\n\ngrant extraordinary writs in cases regarding criminal matters).\n\n       When a court of appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals have\n\nconcurrent, original jurisdiction over a petition for a writ of mandamus against the\n\njudge of a district or county court, the petition should be presented first to the\n\ncourt of appeals, unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. Padilla v.\n\nMcDaniel, 122 S.W.3d 805, 808 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). This petition is being\n\npresented to this Court in the first instance because this Court has sole jurisdiction\n\nover the appeal and review death penalty cases, of which this is one. See TEX.\n\nCODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 4.04, § 2; TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.071. Moreover,\n\nthe Court has previously ordered that the underlying case be expeditiously\n\nconcluded. See Order of April7, 2014 in Ex parte Humberto Garza, No. WR-\n\n78, 113-0 1. Were this petition to be filed in the Thirteenth Court of Appeals, there\n\nis the likelihood that the matter would still be brought to this Court in due course,\n\nconsuming additional time.\n\n\n                                         -xiii-\n\f                                ISSUE PRESENTED\n\n      The Respondent judge denied a motion to recuse the judge presiding over\n\nan application for writ of habeas corpus, filed in a capital case pursuant to TEX.\n\nCODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.071. The judge presiding over the application was the\n\nconvicting court at trial. The habeas application contained allegations of\"jury\n\nmisconduct, including the exposure of the jury to outside influences.\"\n\n      Further investigation of the case, conducted prior to a scheduled evidentiary\n\nhearing revealed that former jurors would testify that both Judge Gonzalez and his\n\nbailiff engaged in off-the-record communications with the jury during the trial, in\n\nthe jury room, and outside the presence of counsel or the defendant. The subject\n\nmatter of the communications included the concern ofjury members about their\n\npersonal safety in this gang-related case in which the jury was required to answer\n\nthe \"future dangerousness\" special issue, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 37.071.\n\n      The basis for the motion to recuse was that, in the circumstances of this case\n\nJudge Gonzalez's ability to adjudicate impartially a ground for relief concerning\n\nhis own and his bailiffs conduct \"might reasonably be questioned,\" and that \"the\n\njudge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the\n\nproceeding\", TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b (b)(l) and (3).\n\n      Humberto Garza had a right to a trial where the jury only made its decisions\n\n\n                                        -xiv-\n\fon the basis of evidence developed from the witness stand in a public courtroom,\n\nin his personal presence and with the full protection of his rights of confrontation,\n\nof cross-examination, and of counsel. Given the governing legal standards and the\n\nrecord as developed, Mr. Garza has a clear entitlement to relief from this Court,\n\nand would have no adequate remedy on appeal.\n\n         The intervention of this Court is therefore necessary in this extraordinary\n\nsituation in order to avert the continuation of a habeas proceeding that would\n\ninevitably have to be remanded later for renewed proceedings before a different\n\njudge.\n\n         An immediate stay ofthe proceedings in the trial court is also sought in\n\norder to permit this Court to resolve the issues presented in this petition, and for\n\nMr. Garza to be able to actually receive the reliefrequested, namely that the\n\nhabeas proceedings should only continue before a different judge.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -xv-\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Humberto Garza was convicted of capital murder in the 3 70th Judicial\n\nDistrict Court of Hidalgo County, Texas, Judge Noe Gonzalez presiding, and\n\nsentenced to death on March 24, 2005. Both the conviction and sentence of death\n\nwas affirmed on direct appeal. Garza v. State, No. AP-75,217 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\nApril 30, 2008)(not designated for publication).\n\n      A timely Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed on July 19, 2007.\n\nOn November 13, 2012, the Hidalgo County District Attorney's Office filed its\n\nAnswer to the Writ Application. Claims Five and Six of the Application alleged\n\nthat Mr. Garza's death sentence resulted from jury misconduct, including the\n\nexposure of the jury to outside influences. 2\n\n      An affidavit of juror Rose Marie Vera, submitted as Exhibit 26 to the\n\nApplication, indicated that the trial judge had \"warned us that sometimes gang\n\nmembers come after the jury,\" and that the bailiff had told the jury that the judge\n\nalways carried a gun. 3\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Claims Five and Six are virtually identical and were not argued separately\nwithin the Application.\n      3\n      Applicant was alleged to be a leader of the \"Tri-City Bombers\" gang, and\nwas charged with carrying out a six-victim robbery-homicide along with other\ngang members.\n\n                                          -1-\n\f       Ms. Vera's affidavit, which was obtained by volunteer law students, did not\n\nspecify whether the comment made by the judge about gangs was made in open\n\ncourt (it does not appear on the record), when that comment was made and in what\n\ncircumstances, what the bailiffs name was, what were the circumstances in which\n\nthe bailiff was talking to the jury about the judge, when the bailiff told the jury\n\nthat the judge carried a gun, or what the influence of the judge and bailiffs\n\ncomments had been on Ms. Vera's sentencing decision.\n\n       Mr. Garza's original habeas corpus counsel, John Wright, withdrew and\n\nundersigned counsel was appointed in his place on November 9, 2012.\n\nUndersigned counsel subsequently obtained funding to further investigate and\n\ndevelop the grounds for relief pleaded in Mr. Garza's habeas application.\n\n      On April 7, 2014, this Court entered an order directing the trial court to rule\n\non any outstanding motions in the case within 30 days and to resolve any\n\noutstanding issues within 90 days. On May 14, 2014, the trial court set a hearing\n\ndate of June 9, 2014. In the meantime, investigation on behalfofMr. Garza\n\ncontinued. 4\n\n\n\n      4\n        As stated at the recusal hearing on June 16, 2014, it has only been possible\nto interview some, but not all, of the trial jurors in this case because of the\ndifficulty that undersigned and former counsel experienced in obtaining necessary\ninvestigative funding.\n                                          -2-\n\f      Further information and clarification about the communications between the\n\njury, Judge Gonzalez and his bailiffwas obtained during an interview of juror\n\nRose Marie Vera, now known as Rose Marie Palacios. Ms. Palacios signed a new\n\naffidavit stating that both Judge Gonzalez and his bailiff had engaged in\n\ncommunications with the jury in the jury room, and outside the presence of\n\ncounsel, during which the statements mentioned in her earlier affidavit were made.\n\n      A motion asking Judge Gonzalez to recuse himself was therefore filed on\n\nMay 27, 2014.5 Judge Gonzalez declined to recuse himself, and referred this\n\nmatter to the Regional Presiding Judge, who assigned the case to the Hon J.R.\n\n\"Bobby\" Flores of the 139111 District Court ofHidalgo County.\n\n      A hearing was conducted on June 16, 2014. 6 Three witnesses testified:\n\nformer jurors Rose Marie Palacios and Melissa Guerrero were called on behalf of\n\nMr. Garza; the trial bailiff, Alicia \"Licha\" Salinas, was called by the State. Judge\n\nFlores also took judicial notice of the contents of the court file pertaining to the\n\ncase, which included affidavits from Rose Marie Palacios dated May 19, 2014 and,\n\nunder her former name, Rose Marie Vera, dated July 14,2007, and from Melissa\n\n\n\n\n      5\n          Ms. Vera reverted to her maiden name ofPalacios after a divorce.\n      6\n          A transcript of the testimony from the hearing is attached as Exhibit H.\n                                           -3-\n\fGuerrero, dated July 14, 2007. 7\n\nRose Marie Palacios (formerly Vera).\n\n      Ms. Palacios testified that she had been a juror at Mr. Garza's 2005 trial.\n\nRHR at 4. 8 She had had concerns for her personal safety during the trial, which\n\nwere caused by the other jurors, and by the judge saying that jurors could be in\n\ndanger, as well as by the evidence itself. RHR. at 4-5. She had thought she might\n\nbe followed or threatened. RHR. at 4. Her concerns were increased by an incident\n\nwhere someone took photographs of the jury in court during the trial. RHR at 5.\n\nThe jurors had been asking \"if we were safe because of the gang activity.\" They\n\nwere concerned about gang members' families being in the courtroom, and about\n\nthe taking of the photograph. RHR at 8. Ms. Palacios acknowledged that the\n\nfamily members in the courtroom could have been family members of the victims\n\nin the case, which involved gangs on both sides. RHR at 18.\n\n      The bailiff, who was a woman named Licha, told the jury members that they\n\nwould be safe because the judge carried a gun, but that made Mrs. Palacios more\n\nnervous. RHR at 5, 9. Licha's comments were made in the jury room, not the\n\n\n      7\n          These exhibits are attached as Exhibits I-K.\n      8\n        Page references are to the transcript of the testimony prepared and provided\nto the parties on June 17,2014, which is attached as Exhibit H. It is referred to\nhere as \"RHR\" (Recusal Hearing Record).\n                                           -4-\n\fcourtroom, and with all the jurors present. RHR at 5, 7. Some other jurors had\n\ntold Licha they hoped she was carrying a gun: \"And she said no, she didn't, but\n\nnot to worry because the judge did.\" RHR at 6. Licha said that she never carried a\n\ngun, RHR at 17. This conversation occurred during the trial, and before the jury\n\narrived at a guilty verdict. RHR at 8. Licha also said \"that she would be surprised\n\nif [the judge] bought us lunch because he was a cheapskate[.]\" RHR at 9.\n\n      The judge came into the jury room to talk to the jurors about their safety\n\nconcerns. RHR at 10. Ms. Palacios believed that the judge came into the jury\n\nroom in response to a note from another member of the jury. RHR at I 0. That visit\n\nby the Judge to the jury room was while the trial was still going on, and before the\n\nguilty verdict. RHR at I 0. All twelve members of the jury were there, but she\n\ncould not remember if the bailiff was there also. RHR at II. The court reporter\n\nmay also have been present, but not the defendant or his attorneys, RHR at II. 9\n\nMs. Palacios did not remember Mr. Garza or any of the attorneys ever being\n\npresent in the jury room. RHR at 7-8. The judge had mentioned scheduling when\n\nhe talked to the jurors. RHR at 15.\n\n      Ms. Palacios testified that the judge said \"That he understood our fears, but\n\n\n      9\n      The Reporter's Record filed by the court reporter at trial, the late Francisco\nB. Moreno, does not include any transcript of proceedings conducted in the jury\nroom.\n                                         -5-\n\f... he was going to provide us security and that we would be fine ... That the gangs,\n\nsometimes they threaten the jurors and sometimes they -they may follow you.\"\n\nRHR at II. The judge did not give any specific examples of gangs disrupting\n\ntrials or threatening people. RHR at I6-I 7. The judge said that the person who\n\nhad taken a photograph in court was \"legitimate.\" RHR at II. He said that it was a\n\ncourthouse policy not to permit pictures ofjurors to be taken. RHR at I3-I4.\n\n       Mrs. Palacios thought that the judge may also have come into the jury room\n\nanother time, in response to a note. RHR at I2. Later in the trial, the jury had been\n\npermitted to park on the west side of the courthouse, closer to the courtroom, and\n\nthe deputies had escorted the jurors. RHR at I4-15.\n\n      Mrs. Palacios had been interviewed about the case seven years ago by\n\npeople who said they were students from Austin, and she gave them an affidavit at\n\nthe time. RHR at I5-I6. Mrs. Palacios was asked additional questions when she\n\nwas interviewed a second time. RHR at I9. In her earlier affidavit, Mrs. Palacios\n\nsaid she thought she saw Mr. Garza's mother sitting in a car out in the parking lot,\n\nand the jury had been told by court staff that \"they'd take care of the situation.\"\n\nRHR at 16.\n\n      Ms. Palacios had not named the bailiff in her first affidavit, but she may not\n\nhave been asked for a name at that time. RHR at 20-21.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fMelissa Guerrero\n\n      Ms. Guerrero testified that she was a juror at Mr. Garza's 2005 trial. RHR at\n\n22-23. She had had concerns for her personal safety because of the crime in\n\nquestion, which concerned gang violence, and was specifically concerned about\n\nbeing followed. RHR at 23. There was an incident during the trial when a\n\nreporter took a picture, which she herself did not see, but which worried other\n\njurors. RHR at 23. She believed that jurors had expressed concern to court staff\n\nabout the security situation. RHR at 24.\n\n      The judge had approached the jury in the jury room behind the courtroom\n\non the fifth or sixth day of trial. RHR at 24. He said that he had come to calm the\n\njury down, and that they would be parking in a different area from that point. RHR\n\nat 25. She assumed that the change in parking arrangements was because of\n\nsecurity concerns. RHR at 25. When the judge spoke to the jurors, there was\n\nnobody else in the room, other than the twelve of them. RHR at 25. The jurors\n\nwere told that they would be allowed to leave for their parking area before others\n\nwere released from court. RHR at 25-26.\n\n      Ms. Guerrero did not know if it was a regular policy to let people park close\n\nby the courthouse after hours so that they did not have to walk across the street.\n\nRHR at 29. She had assumed the change in parking arrangements was because of\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fthe security situation. RHR at 30.\n\n      Ms. Guerrero could not remember any other remarks made by the judge, but\n\nthe conversation that did occur concerned security matters. RHR at 26. The\n\nconversation was not about scheduling. RHR at 30. The judge also came to the\n\njury room after the trial to thank the jury and to provide information about\n\ncounseling. RHR at 31. Ms. Guerrero remembered that the bailiff in the case was\n\na woman, but did not recall any conversation with her about security\n\narrangements. RHR at 26-27.\n\n      Mrs Guerrero had signed an affidavit in 2007 in which she said nothing\n\nabout the judge going to the jury room. However, she had not been questioned\n\nabout that at the time. RHR at 27-28. She had been visited in the past few days by\n\ndefense counsel, together with another woman. RHR at 28. On cross-examination,\n\nMs. Guerrero said that defense counsel had not suggested what Ms. Guerrero\n\nshould say, other than telling her to be honest. RHR at 31.\n\n      She had been interviewed by two people in 2007, one of whom may have\n\nbeen a lawyer, or they may have been law students. RHR at 32. The questions\n\nasked more recently were in greater depth than on the previous occasion. RHR at\n\n32. She may not have given further information in 2007 about her security\n\nconcerns because she was not asked at the time. RHR at 32. Also, time\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fconstraints may have prevented having a fuller conversation. RHR at 33.\n\n       Ms. Guerrero acknowledged that sentencing someone to death had been a\n\ntough decision for her. RHR at 33-34.\n\nAlicia \"Licba\" Salinas\n\n      Ms. Salinas confirmed that her nickname is \"Licha.\" RHR at 35. She has\n\nworked in the 370th District Court of Hidalgo County for 12 years. Noe Gonzalez\n\nhas been judge of that court throughout that time. RHR at 35. She is now the court\n\ncoordinator, but was working as bailiff back in 2005. RHR at 35. Ms. Salinas\n\nstated that she \"sort of' remembered Mr. Garza's trial. RHR at 36.\n\n      Ms. Salinas testified that one does not have to be a certified peace officer to\n\nbe a bailiff. RHR at 36. She did not carry a gun when she was acting as a bailiff in\n\n2005. RHR at 36. She did not remember telling anybody on the jury that Judge\n\nGonzalez carried a gun, and does not think she would have said that. RHR. at 36.\n\nTo her knowledge, Judge Gonzalez did not carry a gun back then. RHR at 36.\n\n      As a bailiff, Ms. Salinas would escort the jury and give them notice that\n\nthey were needed in the courtroom. RHR at 37. She might escort them to a\n\nrestaurant if lunch was not being brought in for the jury. RHR at 3 7. Jurors in the\n\n370'h district court would park in the big courthouse parking lot or, if they were\n\nworking late, certain parking areas would be blocked off for them where there is\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fan entrance that goes right into the courtroom. RHR. at 37-38.\n\n      Ms. Salinas did not specifically remember any jurors expressing security\n\nconcerns during Mr. Garza's trial. RHR. at 38. If the jury had a note, they would\n\nhand it to her to give to the judge so that the judge and lawyers could discuss the\n\nresponse. RHR. at 38-39. Usually the judge would have a note handed back to the\n\njury, rather than bringing them back into the courtroom. RHR at 39.\n\n      While working at the 3 70th District Court, Ms. Salinas has performed the\n\nfunctions of bailiff, interpreter and court coordinator. RHR at 39. She had been\n\napproved for promotion to court coordinator, and has been in that position since\n\nabout February 2011. RHR at 39-40. The judge is her boss and writes her\n\nperformance reviews.

R. CIV. P. I8b(a)(2) and (3), and for the recusal of a judge for various reasons\n\nthat might have a bearing on the judge's ability to preside with fairness over a\n\ncase: TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(b)(I )-(8). 10 This Court has recognized that the\n\nprotections ofTEX. R. CIV. P. I8a and I8b extends to criminal proceedings,\n\nincluding habeas proceedings in the trial court: Gaal v. State, 332 S. W.3d 448,\n\n452-3 n. I2 (Tex. Crim. App. 20 I I); Ex parte Sinegar, 324 S. W.3d 578, 58 I\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 20 I 0).\n\n      Mr. Garza sought recusal of Judge Gonzalez on two grounds under TEX. R.\n\nCIV. P. 18b, namely that:\n\n•     \"[T]he judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\"\n      TEX. R. CIV. P. I8b (b)(I); and\n\n•      \"(T]he judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\n      concerning the proceeding\", TEX. R. CIV. P.

Art. 30.0I (no judge may sit in criminal\ncase where he is the injured party, has been counsel to either party or is connected\nto either the defendant or the complainant by consanguinity or affinity within the\nthird degree).\n\n       \"No allegation of\"personal bias or prejudice\" under TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b\n(b)(2) was made against Judge Gonzalez.\n                                          -13-\n\f       A.    A REASONABLE PERSON, KNOWING THE FACTS OF THIS\n             CASE, WOULD REASONABLY DOUBT JUDGE\n             GONZALEZ'S ABILITY TO ADJUDICATE THE RELEVANT\n             CLAIMS IMPARTIALLY.\n\n              1.    The Legal Standard for Deciding Whether a Judge's\n                    Impartiality Might Reasonably Be Questioned.\n\n      Judges normally enjoy a presumption that they will perform their roles\n\nimpartially. Abdygapparova v. State, 243 S.W.3d 191, 198 (Tex. App.- San\n\nAntonio 2007).     That presumption may be rebutted. ld This Court's most recent\n\nsubstantive decision concerning recusallaw in Texas, Gaa/ v. State, 332 S. W.3d\n\n448, 453 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011), quoted the concurrence of Justice Kennedy,\n\njoined by three other justices in Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 557-58\n\n(1994), in referring to the appearance of \"an aversion, hostility or disposition of a\n\nkind that a fair-minded person could not set aside \" as being sufficient for a judge\n\nto be recused for lack of impartiality. Justice Kennedy in Liteky also noted that\n\n\"[o]ne of the objects of law is the impartiality of its judges in fact and\n\nappearance.\" Jd. (emphasis added).\n\n      In Gaal, this Court confirmed that there is no need for a party moving for\n\nrecusal on the basis of lack of impartiality to demonstrate what is going through a\n\ntrial judge's mind, or to prove actual bias: \"Under [Rule 18b (b)(I)], showing that\n\nthe trial judge's impartiality 'might reasonably be questioned' suffices.\" /d. at\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f459.'2 In contrast, TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b (b)(2) requires a showing of actual bias, a\n\n\"personal bias or prejudice.\" Jd.\n\n      In Gaal, the Court referred to the standard applied by a recusal judge in\n\nKniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007), functionally very similar\n\nto Justice Kennedy's position in Liteky, finding that recusal was required because:\n\n      A reasonable member of the public at large, witnessing [the trial\n      judge's] words and acts ... and knowing all the facts in the public\n      domain concerning the judge and the case, would have reasonably\n      believed he [acted adversely to the defendant], and [those facts]\n      would have caused such person to reasonably question, and to have a\n      reasonable doubt about, [the trial judge's] impartiality and objectivity\n      ... in a subsequent hearing ....\n\n      Gaal, 332 S. W.3d at 455 n. 26; See also 48B Robert P. Schuwerk & Lillian\n\nB. Hardwick, Texas Practice Series: Handbook of Texas Lawyer and Judicial\n\nEthics 40:26 at 770 (2010) (quoting Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\n\nState v. Kniatt, No. 25704-CR (40th Dist. Ct., Ellis County, Tex. Jan. 20, 2008).\n\n      Thus, the correct standard to be applied is simply that of TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n18b (b)( 1): Recusal is required if\"[T]he judge's impartiality might reasonably be\n\nquestioned,\" because of a factor \"of a kind that a fair-minded person could not set\n\naside when judging the dispute\" and it is not necessary to come to a conclusion\n\n\n      12\n        Gaal was decided with reference to an earlier version of TEX. R. CIV. P.\n18b, in which the paragraph numbering is different from the current version. The\ntext ofTEX. R. CIV. P. 18a and 18b appears in the Appendix as Exhibits Band C.\n                                        -15-\n\fthat the judge in question is, in fact, lacking in impartiality.\n\n             2.     The Reasons Why Judge Gonzalez's Impartiality Might\n                    Reasonably Be Qyestioned in this Case.\n\n      A reasonable member of the public would reasonably doubt Judge\n\nGonzalez's ability to be impartial in adjudicating the claims concerning jury\n\nmisconduct or, perhaps more accurately here, the impact of\"outside influences\"\n\nimproperly brought to bear on the jury . 13 In the hearing in Respondent's court,\n\njurors Palacios and Guerra testified that Judge Gonzalez had private discussions\n\nwith sitting jurors, outside the presence of the defendant, the court reporter or\n\ncounsel for either party. The discussions concerned the jury's personal safety, in\n\nthe context of a case whose subject matter concerned a six-victim homicide\n\nresulting from the activities of members of a local street gang, of which Mr. Garza\n\nwas alleged to be a Captain. Moreover, this was a death penalty case in which the\n\nquestion whether Mr. Garza \"would commit criminal acts of violence that would\n\nconstitute a continuing threat to society,\" was one the jury would have to answer\n\nat sentencing. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 3 7.071 § 2 {b)(2).\n\n      In addition to making findings of fact concerning his own conduct in the\n\njury room, if he continues to preside over this case, Judge Gonzalez would be\n\n\n      13\n       See TEX. R. EVID. 606(b): \"[A] juror may testify ... whether any outside\ninfluence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror[.]\"\n                                          -16-\n\frequired to make findings of fact concerning the conduct of his long-time\n\nemployee, \"Licha\" Salinas, who was his bailiff at the time. According to the\n\ntestifying jurors, Ms. Salinas had conversed with jury members who had expressed\n\nconcern for their safety telling them that the judge carried a gun. As explained\n\nbelow, the conduct ofbothjudge and bailiff breached court rules and\n\nconstitutional safeguards and was improper. These facts would create the\n\nperception in a reasonable person that Judge Gonzalez could not be expected to\n\nadjudicate his own or his bailiffs behavior impartially.\n\n             3.     Any private communication or contact by a trial judge\n                    with a juror during a trial is improper.\n\n       \"Any ex parte meeting or communication between the judge and ... jury is\n\npregnant with possibilities for error,\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co.\n\neta/., 438 U.S. 422,460 (1978), and may alone warrant reversal of a conviction.\n\nld. at 462; 14 see also Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227 (1954):\n\n       In a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering,\n       directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter\n       pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed\n       presumptively prejudicial, if not made in pursuance of known rules of\n       the court and the instructions and directions of the court made during\n\n\n       14\n        \"[I]t is obvious that under any system ofjury trials the influence of the trial\njudge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight, and that his lightest\nword or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\" Starr\nv. United States, 153 U.S. 614, 626 (1894).\n                                         -17-\n\f      the trial, with full knowledge of the parties.\n\n      Remmer was recently cited by this Court in McQuarrie v. State, 380 S.W.3d\n\n145, 166 n.24 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)(reversing and remanding for further\n\nproceedings where outside influence had potentially had impact on jury's verdict).\n\nAs noted by Judge Johnson in Blue v. State, 41 S. W.3d 129 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2000)(plurality opinion):\n\n      More than eighty years ago, we stated that too much caution cannot\n      be exercised in the effort to avoid impressing the jury with the idea\n      that the court entertains any impressions of the case which he wishes\n      them to know, and putting before them matters which should not\n      enter into or affect their deliberations ... should in all cases be\n      avoided. To the jury the language and conduct of the trial court have\n      a special and peculiar weight. The law contemplates that the trial\n      judge shall maintain an attitude of impartiality throughout the trial.\n      Jurors are prone to seize with alacrity upon any conduct or language\n      of the trial judge which they may interpret as shedding light upon his\n      view of the weight of the evidence, or the merits of the issues\n      involved. The delicacy of the situation in which he is placed requires\n      that he be alert in his communications with the jury, not only to avoid\n      impressing them with any views that he has, but to avoid in his\n      manner and speech things that they may so interpret.\n\nBlue, 41 S.W.3d at 131, quoting Lagrone v. State, 84 Tex. Crim. 609,209 S.W.\n411,415 (Tex. Crim. App. 1919). 15\n\n      Texas statutory law prescribes how communication between a trial court\n\n\n\n      15\n        See also Simmons v. State, 55 Tex. Crim. 441, 117 S.W.2d 141, 143 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1909)(\"The trial judge is to the jury the Lord's anointed. His language\nand his conduct have to them a special and peculiar weight.\").\n                                         -18-\n\fand a jury should be conducted: TEx. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 36.27 sets out a\n\nregime whereby all communications from the jury to the court must be \"written,\n\nprepared by the foreman, and shall be submitted to the court through the bailiff'\n\nwith answers also being in writing and made, if possible, only after notice to the\n\ndefendant and counsel, giving the defense an opportunity to object. Any\n\ninstructions or answers to jury notes must be read out in open court, unless that is\n\nexpressly waived, and all such proceedings should be made part of the record. Id.\n\nThe trial court is specifically prohibited from \"at any stage of the proceeding\n\nprevious to the return of the verdict [making] any remark calculated to convey to\n\nthe jury his opinion ofthe case.\" TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 38.05. 16\n\n      Ex parte contacts between a trial judge and a jury may therefore infringe on\n\nconstitutional safeguards. In addition to the constitutional right to a fair trial\n\nbefore an impartial judge, Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309-10, and impartial jury,\n\nSkilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 377 (20 I 0), a defendant has the right to be\n\npresent in person,Rushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 118 (1983); Hoptv. Utah, 110\n\nU.S. 574, 579-80 (1884), and to have the assistance of counsel, Rothgery v.\n\n\n\n      16\n          See also TEX. CODE JUD. CONDUCT, Canon 3(B)(8) {\"A judge shall not\ninitiate, permit or consider ex parte communications outside the presence of the\nparties between the judge and [court appointee] ... concerning the merits of a\npending or impending judicial proceeding.\").\n                                         -19-\n\fGillespie County, 554 U.S. 191, 198 (2008), as well as having the right to a public\n\ntrial. Presley v. Georgia, 558 U.S. 209, 211-12 (2010). All of these rights are\n\njeopardized by ex parte and in camera communications by court officers with\n\njurors outside the presence of the defendant and his counsel.\n\n             4.    Communication or contact by the trial bailiff with jurors\n                   during a trial may be improper if it goes beyond what is\n                   necessary for the purpose of shepherding the jury.\n\n      While the services of a bailiff are necessary to \"attend the wants of the\n\njury,\" TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art 36.24, communication with jurors about the\n\ncase on trial is impermissible, \"except in the presence and by the permission of the\n\ncourt.\" TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art 36.22. Such communication may result in\n\nconfinement in jail or a fine. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art 36.23.\n\n      Comments made privately by a bailiff to jurors may infringe on the right to\n\nbe fairly tried only on the basis of evidence developed from the witness stand in a\n\npublic courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant's right of\n\nconfrontation, of cross-examination, and of counsel. Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S.\n\n363, 365 ( 1966) (bailiffs improper comment to jurors that petitioner was a\n\n\"wicked fellow\" required reversal); see also Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140\n\n( 1892)(conviction reversed because bailiff remarked to jury that this was third\n\nperson defendant had killed); Ward v. Hall, 592 F .3d 1144, 1173-81 (11th Cir.\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f20 10 )(petitioner's constitutional rights to fair trial and reliable sentence were\n\nviolated when bailiff responded improperly to juror question).\n\n      The fact that a Judge has a personal or business relationship with a\n\nparticular individual is not necessarily enough, in itself, to require recusal on the\n\nground of a lack of impartiality. See, e.g., Woodrujfv. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727,\n\n737-38 (Tex. App.- Texarkana 2001, pet. denied)(that doctor who was a party to\n\ncase had operated on judge's mother and colleague, and judge had conducted\n\ndoctor's wedding ceremony was insufficient to require recusal); Lueg v. Lueg,\n\n976 S.W.2d 308, 309, 311 (Tex. App.- Corpus Christi 1998, pet. denied)(recusal\n\nnot mandated although attorney for party was representing judge in separate\n\nlawsuit and was his fanner campaign manager).\n\n      However, in Keene Corp. v. Rogers, 863 S. W.2d 168 (Tex. App. -\n\nTexarkana 1993, no writ) where the judge's son-in-law had become an associate at\n\none of the law finns involved in the case, but had no direct involvement in it, the\n\nTexas Supreme Court held that each situation where an individual to whom a\n\njudge has a personal connection is associated with a case \"has to be detennined on\n\nan ad hoc basis, considering such factors as whether and to what extent [that\n\nperson] is participating in the case and whether [they] will be substantially\n\naffected by the outcome of the proceeding.\"\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\f      Here, the bailiff indicated in her hearing testimony that she has a long-\n\nstanding work relationship with the judge in question and is a valued employee\n\nwho he has promoted. She also acknowledged that both he and she could\n\nexperience adverse consequences as a result of a finding that her conduct had\n\njeopardized the outcome of a case. Thus, in this situation, the relationship\n\nbetween judge and bailiff goes beyond the mere fact of employment. The court\n\nthat ultimately adjudicates the relevant claim will need to determine and evaluate\n\nthe actions of Ms. Salinas, a bailiff who has committed potentially punishable\n\nmisconduct, and who, given the close quarters in which the judge works with her,\n\nmay have knowledge of the judge's own conduct in this case.\n\n      A reasonable observer would conclude that in these circumstances, Judge\n\nGonzalez's ability to impartially adjudicate the allegations in the writ application\n\nmight reasonably be questioned, given that his own, and his bailiffs, conduct\n\ndeparted from the normal standards of conduct with regard to sitting jurors.\n\n      The case ofO'Quinn v. Hall, 77 S.W.3d 438,447-48 (Tex. App.- Corpus\n\nChristi 2002, no pet.) arose from the same court as Mr. Garza's case, and was also\n\npresided over by the Hon. Noe Gonzalez, see 0 'Quinn v. Hall, 77 S. W.3d 452,\n\n454 (Tex. App. - Corpus Christi 2002). In 0 'Quinn, there was a factual dispute\n\nconcerning the time when counsel received notice of an Order entered by Judge\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fGonzalez and supposedly conveyed to counsel by the court staff. The Thirteenth\n\nCourt of Appeals rejected the idea that the judge could take judicial notice of what\n\nhad occurred, and held that the judge's reliance on evidence about a contested fact,\n\nconveyed to him by his own staff, created an appearance of bias and lack of\n\nimpartiality. 77 S.W.3d at 448. The same concerns militate here in favor of\n\nrecusal.\n\n      B.      JUDGE GONZALEZ HAS PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF\n              DISPUTED EVIDENTIARY FACTS WHICH REQUIRE HIS\n              RECUSAL.\n\n      The State of Texas, in its Answer to the Writ Application, disputed Mr.\n\nGarza's claims of outside influences on the jury contending that they \"are based on\n\nfactual premises of doubtful validity,\" /d. at 387. Thus, there are disputed factual\n\nissues here that require that the case be adjudicated by a judge who is a \"neutral\n\narbiter in the courtroom,\" Hensarling v. State, 829 S.W.2d 168, 171 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992).\n\n      On the evidence developed thus far, Judge Gonzalez has knowledge of the\n\nexistence - or non-existence - of facts concerning at least his own conduct and\n\npossibly that of a valued employee - his bailiff- also. It is therefore very possible\n\nthat he will be called as a witness, which cannot be done while he is still presiding\n\nover the case. See TEX. R. EVID. 605: \"The Judge presiding at the trial may not\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\ftestify in that trial as a witness.\"\n\n       Whether or not he testifies, for Judge Gonzalez to continue to preside over\n\nthis case, at minimum, \"give[s] the appearance of the court becoming a witness in\n\nthis matter\" and risks creating \"the appearance of bias which Rule 605 seeks to\n\nprevent.\" O'Quinn, 77 S.W.3d at 447-48. See also Brown v. Lynaugh, 843 F.2d\n\n849, 850 (5th Cir. 1988)(\"1t is difficult to see how the neutral role of the court\n\ncould be more compromised, or more blurred with the prosecutor's role, than\n\nwhen the judge serves as a witness for the state.\").\n\n       In the analogous case of Gentry v. State, No. 06-05-00237-CR, 2006 Tex.\n\nApp. LEXIS 2923 (Tex. App.- Texarkana 2006, no pet.) the court held that a\n\njudge could not decide the outcome of a suppression hearing where he may\n\nhimself have observed the conduct leading to initial detention, and explicitly ruled\n\non his personal knowledge of the sequence of events. The court noted that a lack\n\nof impartiality on the part of a trial judge deprives a defendant of due process,\n\nciting Kemp v. State, 846 S. W.2d 289, 305-06 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992). The facts\n\nof Gent1y were described as a \"clear instance\" of\"personal knowledge of disputed\n\nevidentiary facts,\" by this Court in Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 454. Similarly, the facts\n\nhere, concerning both Judge Gonzalez's own conduct and possibly that of his\n\nbailiff also, provide another \"clear instance\" of critical facts of a case being\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\fpersonally known to a judge, who therefore cannot continue to preside.\n\n      Hensarling v. State, 829 S.W.2d 168, 171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992), a case\n\nwhere the judge who had presided at trial testified at a retrospective competency\n\nhearing, noted the practical difficulties that would occur should a presiding judge\n\nattempt to testify as a witness in the same proceeding, and which underline why\n\nsuch an endeavor is infeasible, quoting Goode, Wellborn and Sharlot, Texas Rules\n\nofEvidence: Civil and Criminal, 33 Texas Practice 605.1, p. 384:\n\n      A judge who testifies, for example, might be required to evaluate his\n      own testimony in the course of deciding a motion for a directed\n      verdict. Furthermore, the aura of impartiality surrounding the judge\n      will likely cause the jury to give undue credence to his testimony.\n      Opposing counsel might well be hesitant to attack the judge on cross-\n      examination for fear of alienating either the judge or jury. Finally,\n      practical problems inhere in such judicial testimony. Who, for\n      example, will rule on objections?\n\n      The conclusion in Hensarling was that for the State to introduce the\n\ntestimony of the judge who had presided at a previous stage of the proceedings did\n\nnot violate TEX. R. EVID. 605, but on the facts of that case, a new judge was now\n\npresiding,\n\nand the judge's own conduct was not in question, as it is here.\n\n             1.    A Clear Entitlement to Relief Exists in These Circumstances.\n\n      Mr. Garza has a \"a clear right to the relief sought.\" The merits of the\n\nsituation are \"clear and indisputable\" with \"nothing left to the exercise of\n\n                                         -25-\n\fdiscretion or judgment.\" State ex rei. Hill v. Fifth Court ofAppeals, 34 S.W.3d\n\n924, 927-28 (Tex. Crim. App. 200l){citing Buntion v. Harmon, 827 S.W.2d 945,\n\n94 7 and 947 n. 2 {Tex. Crim. App. 1992). 17\n\n       That there is a disputed evidentiary issue, and that Judge Gonzalez would\n\nhave personal knowledge of his own role in what occurred in the jury room during\n\nthe trial, see TEX. R. CIV. PROC. 18b(b)(3) is itself beyond dispute: The State, in\n\nits Answer, disputed Mr. Garza's claims of outside influences on the jury\n\ncontending that they \"are based on factual premises of doubtful validity,\" /d. at\n\n387. The State has also contested the strength and credibility of the juror\n\naffidavits and testimony adduced at the recusal hearing. See Exhibit F: \"State's\n\nMemorandum Response to Applicant's Motion to Recuse 3701h District Court\n\nJudge Noe Gonzalez\" at 12-19,21. 18\n\n      Likewise, given the allegations in the habeas application, the affidavits of\n\n\n\n      17\n        The fundamental nature of the right to an impartial trial judge was such\nthat the Sixth Court of Appeals in Gentry, where the trial judge relied on his\npersonal knowledge of the facts of the case in ruling, elected to address the issue\nsua sponte. That court held that the trial judge had been disqualified from\npresiding, and reversed and remanded to the trial court. Gentry, 2006 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 2923 * 8.\n      18\n        The State has acknowledged in its Response at 14 that there is a \"clear-cut\nfactual dispute concerning whether Ms. Salinas had made a remark about Judge\nGonzalez carrying a gun for this court.\"\n                                        -26-\n\fthe two jurors and the hearing testimony, that Judge Gonzalez and his bailiff\n\nbrought an improper outside influence to bear on the jury, an outside observer\n\nwould question whether he could resolve those issues impartially. That is\n\napparent, whatever the merit of the underlying ground for habeas relief, and\n\nwhether or not Judge Gonzalez should decide to conduct a live hearing on the\n\nallegation. 19 The question of whether he would in fact be partial may never be\n\nresolved, and is not even relevant.\n\n       Moreover, the State in the proceeding below did not contest any of the basic\n\npropositions of law either underlying the alleged ground for habeas relief or the\n\nlaw on recusal. 20 The State has not contested the conclusion that Judge Gonzalez\n\n\n       19\n         Applicant's Motion for Supplemental Order Designating Issues concerning\nthe claim of jury misconduct, and requesting a hearing upon it, remains pending in\nthe trial court.\n      2 <1The State did refer, at the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth points in its\nResponse, to propositions that have a bearing on the issue of personal bias on the\npart of a judge, which is not alleged here. See State's Response at 9-10. The State\nalso referred to there being a \"high threshold\" to be met in recusing a judge on the\nbasis of perceived impartiality. See State's Response at 12. The only case cited\nby the State that actually mentions a \"high threshold\" is Ex parte Ellis, 275\nS.W.3d 109, 112 (Tex. App.- Austin 2008, no pet.) which referred to the\nconcurrence of Justice Kennedy in Liteky, which then explains that a judge should\nonly be disqualified, under the relevant federal statute, if it \"appears that he or she\nharbors an aversion, hostility or disposition of a kind that a fair-minded person\ncould not set aside when judging the dispute\" adding that \"[o]ne of the objects of\nlaw is the impartiality of its judges in fact and appearance.\" (emphasis added).\nThe State also cited Abdygapparova, 243 S.W.3d at 198, which refers to a \"high\n                                         -27-\n\fwould have personal knowledge of the behavior alleged. Nor has the State offered\n\nany explanation ofhow a judge in his position could rule impartially. Finally, the\n\nState has offered no argument showing how the appearance of impartiality has not\n\nbeen compromised.\n\n      As Buntion explained, a ministerial act is one \"clearly compelled by the\n\nfacts and legal authority extant in a given situation.\" 827 S.W. 2d at 947. Even\n\nwhat might otherwise be deemed a discretionary function, may become\n\n'\"ministerial' when the facts and circumstances dictate but one rational decision.\n\n!d. Here, the legal authorities and the facts in the record dictated that recusal was\n\nnecessary, and there is \"no ... principled reason\" apparent from the record\n\nsupporting the Respondent Judge's decision. On the contrary, the only rational\n\ndecision was to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n             2.    That a Convicting Court Normally Has the Discretion to Use\n                   Personal Recollection in Resolving Issues in a Habeas\n                   Proceeding Does Not Alter the Conclusion That Judge\n                   Gonzalez May Not Preside over this Case.\n\n      The State contended in Respondent's court that because the trial court in a\n\nhabeas proceeding may use personal recollection in determining the issues, recusal\n\nwas not required in this instance. While that argument is collateral to the question\n\n\nstandard,\" but in the context of a case concerning personal bias as a basis for\nrecusal, which does not discuss the appearance of partiality at all.\n                                         -28-\n\fof whether recusal was mandated on the facts available to Respondent, it will be\n\naddressed here.\n\n         Both the capital and noncapital habeas corpus statutes provide that the\n\nconvicting court \"may use personal recollection\" in determining \"controverted,\n\npreviously unresolved factual issues\" in a writ application. See TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC. Art. 11.071 § 9(a) {emphasis added); TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.07 §\n\n3(d). There is, however, a dearth of authority concerning the scope of a trial\n\ncourt's proper discretion to use personal recollection in determining controverted\n\nissues. It is submitted that it may be appropriate to use personal recollection to\n\ndetermine facts that are unlikely to be disputed or that might be verified by the\n\ncreation of a record to review. Here, however, the facts remain controverted, and\n\nthe State has not declared itself willing to stipulate that the actions of the judge\n\nand bailiff testified to by former jurors Palacios and Guerrero did in fact take\n\nplace.\n\n         In Ex parte Davila, 530 S.W.2d 543 {Tex. Crim. App. 1975), no hearing\n\nwas conducted prior to the trial court making findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. In that case the ruling was based on \"the files and records in this case and\n\nupon the pleadings,\" and the critical fact at issue was not disputed by the State.\n\nThis Court, granting relief, concluded that the \"proper standard in such cases as\n\n\n                                          -29-\n\fthe one before us is whether 'the fact-finding procedure there employed was ...\n\nadequate for reaching reasonable correct results,\"' quoting Townsend v. Sain, 372\n\nU.S. 293 ( 1963)(hearing required in federal district court where state procedures\n\nhad been inadequate to ensure a full and fair hearing); See also Wellons v. Hall,\n\n558 U.S. 220,223 n. 3 (2010) (remanding case concerning alleged ex parte\n\ncontacts between the trial court and jurors, on which the petitioner had been\n\nprevented from creating a record, noting that it would be \"bizarre if a federal court\n\nhad to defer to state-court factual findings, made without any evidentiary record.\")\n\n       The fact-finding procedure must be fair to both parties. In Ex parte Byars,\n\n176 S.W.3d 841 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005), where a recommendation for the grant of\n\nhabeas rei ief was upheld, a recanting witness had been interviewed by the trial\n\ncourt in camera with only a court reporter present, albeit with the acquiescence of\n\nthe parties. Members of this Court concurred in the decision but expressed\n\nconcern as to whether the procedure employed was adequate, given that\n\n\"adversarial testing is the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing\n\nreliability,\" and the State had not cross-examined the witness. Id at 841 (Keller,\n\nP.J., and Hervey & Cochran, JJ., concurring). Similar concerns pertain where\n\nthere is a risk that the trial court will make findings on the basis of facts that\n\ncannot actually be known, let alone properly tested or challenged. Rose v.\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fMitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 563 (1979)(earlier state court detennination of facts was\n\nnot dispositive where ''judge whose conduct [the petitioner] challenged decided\n\nthe validity of that challenge.\").\n\n      Moreover, weight should be given to the circumstances in which the\n\nconvicting court acquires its knowledge of the facts: In Sommers v. Concepcion,\n\n20 S.W.3d 27,43-44 {Tex. Crim. App.- Houston [14'h Dist.] 2000, pet. denied) a\n\ntrustee in bankruptcy tried to recuse a judge who had testified in another\n\nproceeding concerning the same parties. It was held that it was no ground for\n\nrecusal if a judge has learned facts in the course of prior proceedings, but that\n\n\"where a party alleges the judge possesses personal knowledge of disputed facts,\n\nthe party must show that this knowledge either was wrongfully obtained or led to a\n\nwrongful disposition of the case.\" Here, where the trial court's knowledge of the\n\noccurrences in the jury room were obtained - indeed, created - in violation of the\n\nrelevant statutes, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 36.22 and 36.27 concerning\n\ncontacts and communications with a jury during trial, it may be fairly said that the\n\njudge's personal knowledge seems to have been wrongfully obtained. Thus, to\n\nhave that same judge rely on his personal recollection of those events would not\n\nbe an adequate method \"for reaching reasonably correct results.\" Davila, 530\n\nS.W.2d at 545. A finding favorable to Mr. Garza's position here would require\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fJudge Gonzalez- explicitly or implicitly- to admit negative facts about his own\n\nconduct and possibly that of his longtime bailiff also. A finding adverse to Mr.\n\nGarza could also result in factual determinations which cannot adequately be\n\nreviewed later, since the court's contacts with the jury were in camera, ex parte\n\nand unrecorded.\n\nIII.   NO ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW\n\n       Mr. Garza has no adequate remedy at law. Unless mandamus relief is\n\ngranted, the proceedings will continue to be presided over by a judge who should\n\nhave been recused, and whose findings of fact and conclusions of law may have to\n\nbe revisited by a subsequent judge.\n\n             I.     Review of Denial ofRecusal in the Context of Habeas Corpus\n                    Proceedings\n\n       There is no comparable criminal rule or statute to TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b,\n\nwhich provides the various statutory bases for recusal. However, this Court has\n\nheld that the civil rules on recusal apply, absent legislative intent indicating\n\notherwise. Gaal v. State, 332 S.W.3d 448, 453 n. 12 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011);\n\nMcC/enan v. State, 661 S.W.2d 108, 110 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983). Because there\n\nis no expressed legislative intent otherwise, TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b therefore certainly\n\napplies to Mr. Garza's case.\n\n       This Court has also specifically held that TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(a), which\n\n                                         -32-\n\fstates the procedures governing recusal motions in the trial courts, applies to\n\nhabeas proceedings \"before the trial court.\" Ex parte Sinegar, 324 S.W.3d 578,\n\n580 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). However, TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a G)(1)(A), provides\n\nthat: \"[a]n order denying a motion to recuse may be reviewed only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion on appeal from the fmaljudgment,\" (emphasis added) and the specific\n\napplication of that part of Rule 18a is not discussed in Sinegar.\n\n      Sinegar concerned a situation where the judge of a convicting court had\n\ndeclined to address a motion to recuse filed in the course of a habeas corpus\n\nproceeding in which the convicting court had already issued findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law recommending that relief be denied. In Sinegar, this Court was\n\npresented with both the question of the trial court's handling of the recusal issue\n\nand that court's findings of fact and conclusions of law on the merits. However, in\n\nthat case, unlike this, the trial court had not actually acted on the recusal motion,\n\nand the Court apparently felt it necessary to have the recusal issue addressed prior\n\nto deciding whether the findings and conclusions could even be reviewed, given\n\nthat Sinegar's recusal efforts were underway prior to the issuance of the trial\n\ncourt's findings and recommendations. See also Ex parte Roundtree, No. WR-\n\n74,550-01, 2011 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS 249 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011)\n\n(Court of Criminal Appeals declined adoption of findings and conclusions because\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\frecusal proceedings were pending when trial court made findings and\n\nconclusions); see also TEX. R. APP. P. 73.4 Action on Application: \"The Court\n\nmay deny relief based on its own review of the Application or may issue such\n\nother instructions or orders as may be appropriate. \" 21\n\n      This Court has not stated whether its TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. I I .071 §\n\nII review ofthe trial court's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on a\n\nhabeas application is an \"appeal from the final judgment\" for the purpose of TEX.\n\nR. CIV. P. 18a G)(l )(A). It does not appear that it is: This Court reserves to itself\n\nall final decisions on both fact and law in habeas corpus cases, Ex parte Van\n\nAlstyne, 239 S.W.3d 815,817 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)(Court ofCriminal Appeals\n\nis \"ultimate fact finder\" in post-conviction habeas corpus review); Ex parte\n\nGalvan, 110 S.W.2d 822, 823-24 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989)(Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals not bound by trial court's conclusions of law). This Court's resolution of\n\na capital habeas writ application is itself the \"final judgment\" in a habeas action\n\nwhich disposes of all issues and parties in a case. There is simply no \"appeal\" in\n\n\n\n\n      21\n       Neither Sinegar, nor any other authority that counsel has located, articulate\nwhether this Court's \"review,\" see TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. I 1.071 § I 1, is in\nan \"appeal\" for the purpose of TEX. R. CIV. P. I8a G)(l)(A)'s exclusive avenue to\nremedy the denial of a recusal motion.\n\n                                         -34-\n\fTexas law from this Court's \"final judgment.\"22\n\n      Moreover, the habeas statute, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.071 instructs\n\nthis Court to review the application and possibly to request further briefing of\"the\n\nissues,\" but in this context, that reference must be to the factual issues material to\n\nthe underlying legality of an Applicant's confinement, see TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC.\n\nArt. 11.071 § 8(a). The statute contains no specific provision allowing\n\npresentation of arguments concerning irregularity or impropriety in the\n\nproceedings below.\n\n      The plain words of the recusal rule TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a 0)(1)(A) indicate\n\nthat it requires the existence of an appeal from a trial court proceeding in order for\n\na recusal decision to be challenged. Being drafted as a civil rule, it is hardly\n\nsurprising that it makes no explicit provision for review of criminal habeas corpus\n\nproceedings, and while this Court has long since extended an invitation to the\n\nlegislature to provide relevant rules specific to criminal cases, see McLenan, 661\n\nS.W.2d at 111, no such rules have been provided.\n\n      There being no provision in the habeas context for an \"appeal\" in the usual\n\n\n       \"!.JSee Green v. State. 374 S.W.3d 434,445-46 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)\nadopting Texas Supreme Court's interpretation of\"final judgement,\" as that which\ndisposes of all issues and parties in a case in North East Independent School Dist.\nv. Aldridge, 400 S. W.2d 893, 895 (Tex. 1966); Davis v. McCray Refrigerator\nSales Corp., 136 Tex. 296, 150 S.W.2d 377 (Tex. 1941).\n                                         -35-\n\fsense from a trial court's denial ofrecusal, there is no adequate remedy at law for\n\nan improper denial.\n\n2.    Awaiting Later Appeal or Review Is Not an Adequate Remedy in the\n      Context of this Case.\n\n      Even if TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.071 § 11 review is an \"appeal from\n\nthe final judgment\" for the purpose of TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a G)( 1)(A}, and provides a\n\npotential remedy, that remedy would not be adequate in these circumstances.\n\n      In other cases where an appeal was a remedy that would eventually become\n\navailable to a defendant seeking mandamus, it has been held that such a remedy\n\nwas not adequate, given the circumstances. In Stearnes v. Clinton, 780 S. W.2d\n\n216 {Tex. Crim. App. 1989), the relator complained that the respondent judge had\n\narbitrarily removed his court-appointed attorneys. The relator conceded that if he\n\nwas denied mandamus relief, and if convicted, he would be able to seek review of\n\nthe issue through an appeal. ld. at 225. This Court held that the \"remedy of\n\nappeal is simply inappropriate to the situation present here,\" and quoted Smith v.\n\nFlack, 728 S. W.2d 784, 792 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) {\"In some cases, a remedy at\n\nlaw may technically exist; however, it may nevertheless be so uncertain, tedious,\n\nburdensome, slow, inconvenient, inappropriate, or ineffective as to be deemed\n\ninadequate.\") The Court held that failing to provide an immediate remedy would\n\nburden the defendant by compelling him \"to again endure a trip through the\n\n                                        -36-\n\fsystem creating in tum needless additional cost to the taxpayers of this state.\" !d.\n\nat 225. In Buntion, 827 S.W.2d at 948-49 where the trial court arbitrarily replaced\n\ncounsel post-trial, this Court came to the same conclusion, emphasizing the\n\nfundamental nature of the right to· counsel, and held that the relator had no\n\nadequate remedy at law.\n\n      Given ''the subjective nature of such terms as 'plain' and 'uncertain,'\n\n'convenient' and 'inconvenient,' 'effective' and 'ineffective,\"' Smith v. Flack, 728\n\nS.W.2d at 792, noted that the Court must examine the specific circumstances of\n\neach case in the course of carefully exercising its discretion as to whether a\n\nparticular remedy at law would be adequate. While this case involved a different\n\nright - the right to an impartial judge - than that at play in Stearnes and Buntion,\n\nwhere the right to counsel was involved, the right to an impartial judge is equally\n\nfundamental to a fair proceeding.\n\n      Relator could continue through the habeas corpus process with the presiding\n\njudge unchanged, and then ask this Court to set aside any adverse findings and\n\nconclusions of the trial court, reverse the respondent judge's ruling on the recusal\n\nissue and remand for renewed litigation of the issues, untainted by the\n\ninvolvement of a judge whose impartiality and knowledge are at issue. However,\n\nto \"require him to go through a complete [habeas proceeding] in order to assert\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fthis right to which he is now entitled would be to require a mere formality, and\n\nwould be wasteful of both time and money.\" Thi Van Lev. Perkins, 700 S.W.2d\n\n768, 776) (Tex. App. - Austin 1985); Perkins v. Court ofAppeals, 738 S. W.2d 276\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1987)(denying writ of mandamus against court of appeals in Thi\n\nVan Le).\n\n      It should also be borne in mind that the trial court in a habeas proceeding\n\nperforms multiple tasks in such a case, all of which may be affected by his\n\ndiscretionary decision-making: \"He is 'Johnny-on-the-Spot.' He is the collector of\n\nthe evidence, the organizer of the materials, the decisionmaker as to what live\n\ntestimony may be necessary, the factfinder who resolves disputed factual issues,\n\nthe judge who applies the law to the facts, enters specific findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, and may make a specific recommendation to grant or deny\n\nrelief.\" Ex parte Simpson, 136 S.W.3d 660, 668 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Thus,\n\nrather than any adverse rulings adverse being easily segregable if the case were\n\nremanded to the trial court, the involvement of a judge whose impartiality might\n\nreasonably be questioned would properly demand that the entire proceeding be\n\nsubject to a \"do-over.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                        -38-\n\fIV.   A STAY OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n      IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT AN ADEQUATE\n      REMEDY IS AVAILABLE\n\n      This Court issued an Order on April 7, 2014, commanding Judge Gonzalez\n\nto resolve the outstanding issues and to have the completed case forwarded to the\n\nCourt on or before July 3 1, 2014. The Order, which reflected that Mr. Garza had\n\npreviously received extensions of time in which to prepare and investigate the\n\ncase, stated that no further extensions of time would be entertained. 23 See Order of\n\nApril 7, 2014 in Ex parte Humberto Garza, No. WR-78, 113-0 I. The Order also\n\nstated that an order to show cause would issue \"against the trial judge, the\n\nprosecutor and defense counsel,\" ifthe July 31,2014 deadline was not met.\n\n      At the time that the additional information was obtained from former juror\n\nRose Marie Palacios, giving rise to the Motion for Court to Recuse Itself filed on\n\nMay 27,2014, Judge Gonzalez had ordered an evidentiary hearing to commence\n\nduring the week beginning June 9, 2014. However, because of the provisions of\n\nTEX. R. Crv. P. 18a (f)(2)(A) which prevent a judge against whom a recusal motion\n\n\n      23\n        The Order states that undersigned counsel was seeking a fourth extension\nof time in the case. In fact, since appointment, undersigned counsel had received\ntwo previous motions for extension of time, one being granted on January 7, 2013\nand one on August 2, 2013. An extension oftime which appears on the Court's\nwebsite as being granted on November 5, 2012, was at the behest of the trial court\non behalf of the State which had not filed its Answer, even though over five years\nhad elapsed since the Application was filed.\n                                        -39-\n\fhas been filed from taking any further action while the motion is pending, Judge\n\nGonzalez was unable to proceed until the motion had been decided. That did not\n\nhappen until Respondent Judge Flores denied the motion, on July 3, 2014.\n\n       While Judge Gonzalez is no longer subject to the strictures ofTEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 18a (t)(2)(A), Mr. Garza's need for his case to be decided by a different judge\n\nremains, and is the subject of this Petition for Writ of Mandamus. However,\n\nAssistant Criminal District Attorney Theodore C. Hake, who has been handling\n\nthis matter for the appellate division of the Hidalgo County District Attorney's\n\noffice has asked Judge Gonzalez, in a letter of July 7, 2014, to set a renewed date\n\nfor an evidentiary hearing as soon as possible in light of this Court's Order of\n\nApril4, 2014. 24\n\n      While Mr. Garza regrets the need for further delay in this case, he submits\n\nthat his legitimate interest in having his habeas application adjudicated only in a\n\nreliable proceeding before a judge whose impartiality cannot be questioned, and\n\nwho is not encumbered with personal knowledge of the disputed facts, should\n\nprevail over this Court's earlier order. Mr. Garza did not create the circumstances\n\ngiving rise to the need to tile his recusal motion, and his interests- and, he would\n\n\n\n      24\n       A copy of that letter, as provided to undersigned counsel, is attached as\nExhibit L.\n\n                                         -40-\n\fsubmits, the wider interests ofbothjustice and judicial economy- are imminently\n\n                                                                                    25\nthreatened if the district court proceeds to an evidentiary hearing at this time.\n\n      He therefore moves, pursuant to TEX. R. APP. P. 52.1 0, for Temporary Relief\n\nin the form of an immediate stay of the proceedings in the 3 70th District Court so\n\nthat this Court can resolve the case, and he can receive the relief he requests:\n\nnamely that the habeas proceedings should only continue before a different judge.\n\nWithout a stay, the proceedings in the district court may well have concluded\n\nbefore this Court has time to rule, and the subject matter of this Petition will have\n\nbecome moot.

Chapter 25 of the Government Code\ngoverns statutory probate courts, Rule 528 governs justice courts, and Chapter 29 of\nthe Government Code governs municipal courts. Under Rule 18a, a judge's rulings\nmay not be the sole basis for a motion to recuse or disqualify the judge. But when one\nor more sufficient other bases are raised, the judge hearing the motion may consider\nevidence of rulings when considering whether to grant the motion. For purposes of\nthis rule, the term \"rulings\" is not meant to encompass a judge's statements or remarks\nabout a case.\n(Comment amended by Texas Supreme Court, Misc.

The grounds may include\nany disability of the judge to sit in the case. The motion shall be verified and must\nstate with particularity the grounds why the judge before whom the case is pending\nshould not sit. The motion shall be made on personal knowledge and shall set forth\nsuch facts as would be admissible in evidence provided that facts may be stated upon\ninformation and belief if the grounds of such belief are specifically stated.\n (b) On the day the motion is filed, copies shall be served on all other parties or their\ncounsel of record, together with a notice that movant expects the motion to be\npresented to the judge three days after the filing of such motion unless otherwise\nordered by the judge. Any other party may file with the clerk an opposing or\nconcurring statement at any time before the motion is heard.\n\f (c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse himself\nor request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge\nto hear such motion. If the judge recuses himself, he shall enter an order of recusal\nand request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign another\njudge to sit, and shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in the\ncase except for good cause stated in the order in which such action is taken.\n (d) If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding judge of\nthe administrative judicial district, in either original form or certified copy, an order\nof referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements. Except for good\ncause stated in the order in which further action is taken, the judge shall make no\nfurther orders and shall take no further action in the case after filing of the motion and\nprior to a hearing on the motion.

If the motion is granted, the order shall not be reviewable, and the\npresiding judge shall assign another judge to sit in the case.\n (g) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may also appoint and assign judges in\nconformity with this rule and pursuant to statute.\n (h) If a party files a motion to recuse under this rule and it is determined by the\npresiding judge or the judge designated by him at the hearing and on motion of the\nopposite party, that the motion to recuse is brought solely for the purpose of delay\nand without sufficient cause, the judge hearing the motion may, in the interest of\njustice, impose any sanction authorized by Rule 215(2)(b).\"\n\n2011 amendment, by G.O. 11-9141, added \"or disqualification\" in (f)(1)(A).\n\f  Exhibit C\nTEX.

that such breaches could cause negative comment\n       in the media, or reversal of a case which would also cause the judge a loss\n       of reputation, p. 44.\n\n\nII.    A REASONABLE PERSON, KNOWING THE FACTS OF THIS\n       CASE, WOULD REASONABLY DOUBT THE JUDGE'S ABILITY\n       TO ADJUDICATE THE RELEVANT CLAIMS IMPARTIALLY.\n\n       A.    The Legal Standard for Decidin& Whetber the Judae'l Impartiality\n             Might Reasonably Be Questioned.\n\n      Judges normally e[\\joy a presumption that they will perform their roles\n\nimpartially. Abdygapparova v. State~ 243 S.W.3d 191, 198 (Tex. App... San\n\nAntonio 2007). While, during argument at the hearing on this Motion, reference\n\nwas made to Ex parte Ellis, 215 S.W.3d 109, 112 (Tex. App... Austin 2008, no\n\npet.), which states that a \"high threshold\" has to be passed in order to displace the\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fpresumption of impartiality, the actual height of such a threshold is nowhere\n\ndiscussed in either Texas or federal law.\n\n       The \"high threshold\" reference in Ellis was to the concurrence of Justice\n\nKennedy, joined by three other justices, in Liteky v. United States, S 10 U.S. 540,\n\n551-58 (1994), which explained that a judge should only be disqualified, under the\n\nrelevant federal statute, if it \"appears that he or she harbors an aversion, hostility\n\nor disposition of a kind that a fair-minded person could not set aside when judging\n\nthe dispute\" and that \"[o]ne of the objects of law is the impartiality of its judges in\n\nfact and appearance.\" (emphasis added). The Court of Criminal Appeals' most\n\nrecent substantive decision concerning recusallaw in Texas, Gaal v. State, 332\n\nS.W.3d 448,453 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011), also referred to the appearance of \"an\n\naversion, hostility or disposition\" being sufficient for a judge to be recused for\n\nlack of impartiality, and confinned that there is no need for a party moving for\n\nrecusal to demonstrate what is going through a trial judge's mind, or to prove\n\nactual bias: \"Under Rule 18b (2)(a), showing that the trial judge's impartiality\n\n'might reasonably be questioned' suffices.\" Jd at 459.\n\n      In its opinion in Gaal, the Court of Criminal Appeals did not adopt, or even\n\nrefer to, the idea of a \"high threshold.\" However, it did refer to the standard\n\napplied by a recusal judge in Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 91 0 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n                                         -11-\n\f2007), finding that recusal was required because:\n\n       A reasonable member of the public at large, witnessing [the trial\n       judge's] words and acts •.• and knowing all the facts in the public\n       domain concerning the judge and the case, would have reasonably\n       believed he [acted adversely to the defendant}, and [those facts]\n       would have caused such person to reasonably question, and to have a\n       reasonable doubt about, [the trial judge's] impartiality and objectivity\n       ... in a subsequent hearing ....\n\n       Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 455 n. 26; See also 488 Robert P. Schuwerk & Lillian\n\nB. Hardwick, Texas Practice Series: Handbook of Texas Lawyer and Judicial\n\nEthics 40:26 at 770 (2010) (quoting Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\n\nState v. Kniatt, No. 25704-CR (40\"' Dist Ct, Ellis County, Tex. Jan. 20, 2008).\n\n      Thus, the correct standard to be applied is simply that of TEX. R. Crv. P.\n\n18b (b)(l): Recusal is required if\"[T]hejudge's impartiality might reasonably be\n\nquestioned,\" because of a factor such as \"an aversion, hostili~ or disposition of a\n\nkind that a fair-minded person could not set aside when judging the dispute\" and it\n\nis not necessary to come to a conclusion that the judge in question is, in fact,\n\nlacking in impartiality.\n\n      B.     The Reasons Why the Judge's Impartiality Might ReasonablY B~\n             Questioned in this  ease.\n      This Court is called on to decide whether a reasonable member of the public\n\nwould reasonably doubt Judge Gonzalez' ability to be impartial in adjudicating\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fclaims concerning jury misconduct or, perhaps more accurately here, the impact of\n\noutside influences improperly brought to bear on the jury. On June 16, 2014, this\n\nCourt heard testimony establishing that Judge Gonzalez had private discussions\n\nwith sitting jurors, outside the presence of the defendant, the court reporter or\n\ncounsel for either party. The discussions concerned the question of the jwy's\n\npersonal safety, in the context of a case whose subject matter concerned a six-\n\nvictim homicide resulting from the activities of members of a local street gang, of\n\nwhich Mr. Garza was alleged to be a Captain. Moreover, this was a death penalty\n\ncase in which the question whether Mr. Garza \"would commit criminal acts of\n\nviolence that would constitute a continuing threat to society,\" was one the jury\n\nwould have to answer at sentencing. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 37.071 § 2\n\n(b){2).\n\n          In addition to now having to make findings of fact concerning his own\n\nconduct, if he continues to preside over this case, Judge Gonzalez would be\n\nrequired to make findings of fact concerning the conduct of his long-time\n\nemployee, Ms. Salinas, who was acting as his bailiff. Ms. Salinas had conversed\n\nwith jury members who had expressed concern for their safety telling them, among\n\nother matters, that the judge carried a gun. The conduct of both judge and bailiff\n\nbreached court rules and constitutional safeguards and was improper, creating the\n\n                                          -13-\n\fperception in a reasonable person that Judge Gonzalez could not now be expected\n\nto adjudicate that behavior impartially.\n\n       C.    An;y private communication or contac.t b.x a trial Jud&e with a juror\n             during a trial is impro,per.\n       \"Any ex parte meeting or communication between the judge and .•• jury is\n\npregnant with possibilities for eJTOr;' United States v. United States Gypsum Co.\n\neta/., 438 U.S. 422, 460 ( 1978), and may alone warrant reversal of a conviction.\n\nJd. at 462; see also Remmer v. United States, 341 U.S. 227 (1954):\n      In a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering,\n      directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter\n      pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed\n      presumptively prejudicial, if not made in pursuance of known rules of\n      the court and the instructions and directions of the court made during\n      the trial, with full knowledge of the parties.\n\n      Remmer was recently cited by the Court of Criminal Appeals in McQuarrie\n\nv. State, 380 S.W.3d 145, 166 n.24 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)(reversing and\n\nremanding for further proceedings where outside influence had potentially had\n\nimpact on jury's verdict); see also TEX. CODE Juo. CONDUCT, Canon 3(8)(8) (\"A\n\njudge shall not initiate, pennit or consider ex parte communications outside the\n\npresence of the parties between the judge and {court appointee] ... concerning the\n\nmerits of a pending or impending judicial proceeding.\").\n\n      Texas statutory law prescribes how communication between a trial court\n\n                                            -14-\n\fand a jury should be conducted: TEX. COD£ CRIM. PROC. Art. 36.27 sets out a\n\nregime whereby all communications from the jury to the court must be \"written,\n\nprepared by the foreman, and shall be submitted to the court through the bailiff'\n\nwith answers also being in writing and made, if possible, only after notice to the\n\ndefendant and counsel, giving the defense an opportunity to object. Any\n\ninstructions or answers to jury notes must be read out in open court, unless that is\n\nexpressly waived, and all such proceedings should be made part of the record. Id\n\n       Ex parte contacts between a trial judge and a jury may infringe on\n\nconstitutional safeguards. In addition to the constitutional right to a fair trial\n\nbefore an impartial jury, Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 377 (20 10), a\n\ndefendant has the right to be present in person, Rushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 118\n\n( 1983); Hopt v. Utah, ll 0 U.S. 574, 519-80 (1884), and to have the assistance of\n\ncounsel, Rothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 U.S. 191, 198 (2008), as well as\n\nhaving the right to a public trial. Presley v. Georgia, 130 S.Ct 721, 723 (2010).\n\nAll of these rights are jeopardized by ex parte and in camera communications by\n\ncourt officers with jurors outside the presence of the defendant and his counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f       D.     Communication or contact by the tJjal bailiff witb jurors durins\n              a trial max be impmper if it goes beyond what is necessaty fOI,\n              the purpose of shepherding the jwy.\n\n       While the services of a bailiff are necessary to \"attend the wants of the\n\njury,\" TEx. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art 36.24, communication with jurors about the\n\ncase on trial is impennissible, \"except in the presence and by the pennission of the\n\ncourt.\" TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art 36.22. Such communication may result in\n\nconfinement in jail or a fine. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art 36.23.\n\n       Comments made privately by a bailiff to jurors may infringe on the right to\n\nbe fairly tried only on the basis of evidence developed from the witness stand in a\n\npublic courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant's right of\n\nconfrontation, of cross-examination, and of counsel. Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S.\n\n363, 365 ( 1966) (bailiff's improper comment to jurors that petitioner was a\n\n'wicked fellow\" required reversal); see also Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140\n4\n\n\n\n\n(1892)(conviction reversed because bailiff remarked to jury that this was third\n\nperson defendant had killed); Wardv. Hall, 592 F.3d 1144, 1173-81 (lllh Cir.\n\n20 IO)(petitioner's constitutional rights to fair trial and reliable sentence were\n\nviolated when bailiff responded improperly to juror question).\n\n      The fact that a Judge has a personal or business relationship with a\n\nparticular individual is not necessarily enough, in itself, to require recusal on the\n\n                                          -16-\n\fground of a lack of impartiality. See, e.g., Woodruff v. Wright, SI S. W.3d 727,\n\n737-38 {Tex. App. -Texarkana 2001, pet. denied)(doctor who was a party to case\n\nhad operated on judge's mother and colleague, and judge had conducted doctor's\n\nwedding ceremony insufficient to require recusal); Lueg v. Lueg, 916 S.W.2d 308,\n\n309, 311 (Tex. App. - Corpus Christi 1998, pet. denied)(recusal not mandated\n\nalthough attorney for party was representing judge in separate lawsuit and was his\n\nformer campaign manager).\n\n       However, in Keene Corp. v. Rogers, 863 S.W.2d 168 (fex. App. -\n\nTexarkana 1993, no writ) where the judge's son-in-law had become an associate at\n\none of the law finns involved in the case, but had no direct involvement in it, the\n\nTexas Supreme Court held that each situation where an individual to whom a\n\njudge has a personal connection is associated with a case \"has to be detennined on\n\nan ad hoc basis, considering such factors as whether and to what extent [that\n\nperson] is participating in the case and whether [they] will be substantially\n\naffected by the outcome of the proceeding.\"\n\n      Here, the bailiff indicated that she has a long-standing work relationship\n\nwith the judge in question and is a valued employee who he has promoted. She\n\nalso acknowledged that both he and she could experience adverse consequences as\n\na result of a finding that her conduct had jeopardized the outcome of a case.\n\n                                        -17-\n\fThus, in this situation, the relationship between judge and bailiff goes beyond the\n\nmere fact of employment. The court that ultimately adjudicates the relevant claim\n\nwill need to detennine and evaluate the actions of Ms. Salinas, a bailiff who has\n\ncommitted potentially punishable misconduct, and who, given the close quarters in\n\nwhich the judge works with her, may have knowledge of the judge's own conduct\n\nin this case.\n\n       A reasonable observer would conclude that in these circumstances, Judge\n\nGonzalez' ability to impartially adjudicate the allegations in the writ application\n\nmight reasonably be questioned, given that his own, and his bailiffs, conduct\n\nappears to have departed from the nonnal standards of conduct with regard to\n\nsitting jurors.\n\n       The case of 0 'Quinn v. Hall, 11 S.W.3d 438, 447-48 (Tex. App... Corpus\n\nChristi 2002, no pet.) arose from the same court and was presided over by the\n\nsame trial judge, the Hon. Noe Gonalez, as Mr. Garza's case, see 0 'Quinn v.\n\nHall, 11 S. W.3d 452, 454 (Tex. App. - Corpus Christi 2002). The Thirteenth\n\nCourt of Appeals decision in 0 'Quinn clearly demonstrates what the correct\n\noutcome here should be: In 0 'Quinn, there was a factual dispute concerning the\n\ntime when counsel received notice of an Order entered by Judge Gonzalez and\n\nsupposedly conveyed to counsel by the court staff. The Thirteenth Court of\n\n                                        -18-\n\fAppeals rejected the idea that the judge could take judicial notice of what had\n\noccurred, and held that the judge's reliance on evidence about a contested fact,\n\nconveyed to him by his own staff, created an appearance of bias and lack of\n\nimpartiality. 77 S.W.3d at 448. The same concerns militate here in favor of\n\nrecusal.\n\nIII.   THE JUDGE HAS PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF DISPUTED\n       EVIDENTIARY FACTS WHICH REQUIRE ms RECUSAL.\n\n       The State ofTexas has, in its Answer to the Writ Application, disputed Mr.\n\nGarza's claims of outside influences on the jury contending that they \"are based on\n\nfactual premises of doubtful validity,\" Id at 387. Thus, there are disputed factual\n\nissues here that require that the case be adjudicated by a judge who is a \"neutral\n\narbiter in the courtroom,\" Hensarlingv. State, 829 S.W.2d 168, 171 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992).\n\n       On the evidence developed thus far, Judge Gonzalez has knowledge of the\n\nexistence - or non-existence - of facts concerning at least his own conduct and\n\npossibly that of a valued employee- his bailiff- also. If the State has discovered\n\nwhat Judge Gonzalez' position is as to the facts, and that account is favorable to\n\nthe State's position, it would likely have to call the Judge as a witness, which\n\ncannot be done while he is still presiding over the case. See TEX. R. EVID. 60S:\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f\"The Judge presiding at the trial may not testify in that trial as a witness.\"\n\n       Whether or not he testifies, for Judge Gonzalez to continue to preside over\n\nthis case, at minimum, \"give[s] the appearance of the court becoming a witness in\n\nthis mattef' and risks creating \"the appearance of bias which rule 605 seeks to\n\nprevent.\" 0 'Quinn, 77 S. W.3d at 447-48. See also Brown v. Lynaugh, 843 F.2d\n\n849, 850 (Sm Cir. 1988)(\"1t is difficult to see how the neutral role of the court\n\ncould be more compromised, or more blurred with the prosecutor's role, than\n\nwhen the judge serves as a witness for the state.'').\n\n       In the analogous case of Gentry v. State, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 2923 (Tex.\n\nApp.- Texarkana 2006, no pet.) the court held that a judge could not decide the\n\noutcome of a suppression hearing where he may himself have observed the\n\nconduct leading to initial detention, and explicitly ruled on his personal\n\nknowledge of the sequence of events. The court noted that a lack of impartiality\n\non the part of a trial judge deprives a defendant of due process, citing Kemp v.\n\nState, 846 S. W.2d 289, 305-06 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992). The facts of Gentry were\n\ndescribed as a \"clear instance\" of\"personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary\n\nfacts,\" in Gaal, 332 8. W.3d at 454. Similarly, the facts here, concerning both\n\nJudge Gonzalez' own conduct and possibly that of his bailiff also, provide another\n\n\"clear instance\" of critical facts of a case being personally known to a judge, who\n\n                                         ·20-\n\ftherefore cannot continue to preside.\n\n       Hensar/ingv. State, 829 S.W.2d 168,171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992),acase\n\nwhere the judge who had presided at trial testified at a retrospective competency\n\nhearing, noted the practical difficulties that would occur should a presiding judge\n\nattempt to testify as a witness in the same proceeding, and which underline why\n\nsuch an endeavor is infeasible, quoting Goode, Wellborn and Sharlot, Texas Rules\n\nofEvidence: Civil and Criminal, 33 Texas Practice 605.1, p. 384:\n\n      A judge who testifies, for example, might be required to evaluate his\n      own testimony in the course of deciding a motion for a directed\n      verdict. Furthennore, the aura of impartiality surrounding the judge\n      will likely cause the jury to give undue credence to his testimony.\n      Opposing counsel might well be hesitant to attack the judge on cross-\n      examination for fear of alienating either the judge or jury. Finally,\n      practical problems inhere in such judicial testimony. Who, for\n      example, will rule on objections?\n\n      The conclusion in Hensarling was that for the State to introduce the\n\ntestimony of the judge who had presided at a previous stage of the proceedings did\n\nnot violate Rule 605, but on the facts of that case, a new judge was now presiding,\n\nand the judge's own conduct was not in question, as it is here.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fIV.     THE JUDGE'S USE OF PERSONAL RECOLLECTION IN\n        DETERMINING THESE CONTROVERTED, PREVIOUSLY\n      . UNRESOLVED FACTUAL ISSUES WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATE\n        TO REACH A REASONABLY CORRECT RESULT IN THIS CASE.\n       Both the capital and noncapital habeas corpus statutes provide that the\n\nconvicting court \"may use personal recollection\" in detennining \"controverted,\n\npreviously unresolved factual issues\" in a writ application. See TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC. Art. 11.071 § 9(a); TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.07 § 3(d).\n\n       There is a dearth of authority concerning the scope of a trial court's proper\n\ndiscretion to use personal recollection in detennining controverted issues.\n\nHowever, Ex parte Davila. 530 S.W.2d 543 (Tex. Crim. App. 1975) concerned a\n\nrape case, in which no hearing was conducted prior to habeas relief being granted.\n\nIn that case the ruling was based on \"the files and records in this case and upon the\n\npleadings,\" and the critical tact at issue was not disputed by the State.\n\n      The Court granted relief, concluding that the ''proper standard in such cases\n\nas the one before us is whether 'the fact-fmding procedure there employed was ..•\n\nadequate for reaching reasonable correct results,\"' quoting Townsend v. Sain, 312\n\nU.S. 293 (J 963)(hearing required in federal district court where state procedures\n\nhad been inadequate to ensure a full and fair hearing); See also Vuong v. Scott, 62\n\nF.3d 673 (Sdl Cir. 199S)(federal courts accord state findings of fact a presumption\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fof correctness, provided the factfinding procedures employed are ''adequate\"\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2)); Wellons v. Hall, 558 U.S. 220, 223 n. 3 (2010)\n\n(remanding case concerning alleged ex parte contacts between the trial court and\n\njurors, on which the petitioner had been prevented from creating a record, noting\n\nthat it would be \"bizarre if a federal court had to defer to state-court factual\n\nfindings, made without any evidentiary record.\")\n\n       It might be appropriate to use personal recollection to determine facts that\n\nare unlikely to be disputed or that might be verified by the creation of a record to\n\nreview. Here, however, the facts remain controverted. and the State has not\n\ndeclared itselfwilling to stipulate that the actions of the judge and bailiff testified\n\nto by fonner jurors Palacios and Guerrero did in fact take place.\n\n       The fact-finding procedure must be fair to both parties. In Ex parte Byars,\n\n176 S. W.3d 841 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005), where a recommendation for the grant of\n\nhabeas relief was upheld, a recanting witness had been interviewed by the trial\n\ncourt in camera with only a court reporter present, albeit with the acquiescence of\n\nthe parties. Members of the Court of Criminal Appeals concurred in the decision\n\nbut expressed concern as to whether the procedure employed was adequate, given\n\nthat \"adversarial testing is the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing\n\nreliability,\" and the State had not cross-examined the witness. ld at 84 J (Keller,\n\n                                         ·23-\n\fP.J. and Hervey & Cochran, JJ., concurring). Similar concerns pertain here, where\n\nthere is a risk that the trial court will make findings on the basis of facts that\n\ncannot be properly tested or chaiJenged. Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 563\n\n( 1979)(earlier state court determination of facts was not dispositive because\n\n'~udge whose    conduct [the petitioner] challenged decided the validity of that\n\nchallenge.\").\n\n       Moreover, weipt should be given to the circumstances in which the\n\nconvicting court acquires its knowledge of the facts: In Sommers v. Concepcion,\n\n20 S.W.3d 27,43-44 (Tex. Crim. App.- Houston [141h Dist.]) 2000, pet. denied) a\n\ntrustee in bankruptcy tried to recuse a judge who had testified in another\n\nproceeding concerning the same parties. It was held that it was no ground for\n\nrecusal if a judge has learned facts in the course of prior proceedings, but that\n\n\"where a party alleges the judge possesses personal knowledge of disputed facts,\n\nthe party must show that this knowledge either was wrong:fUUy obtained or led to a\n\nwrongful disposition of the case.'' Here, where the trial court's knowledge of the\n\noccurrences in the jury room were obtained - indeed, created - in violation of the\n\nrelevant statutes, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 36.22 and 36.27 concerning\n\ncontacts and communications with a jury during trial, it may be fairly said that the\n\njudge's personal knowledge was wrongfully obtained. Thus, to have that same\n\n                                          -24-\n\fjudge rely on his personal recollection of those events would not be an adequate\n\nmethod \"for reaching reasonably correct results.\" Davila, 530 S.W.2d at 545. A\n\nfinding favorable to Mr. Garza's position here would require Judge Gonzalez-\n\nexplicitly or implicitly - to admit negative facts about his own conduct and\n\npossibly that of his longtime bailiff also. A finding adverse to Mr. Garza could\n\nalso result in factual determinations which cannot adequately be reviewed later,\n\nsince the court's contacts with the jury were in camera, ex parte and unrecorded.\n\nV.     CONCLUSION.\n\n      Recusal should be ordered on both of the grounds pleaded, TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n18b (b)(I) and (b)(3). A reasonable person would reasonably question the ability\n\nof Judge Gonzalez to rule impartially, with untainted decision-making, when his\n\nown reputational interest is at stake, and he has been shown to have personal\n\nknowledge of disputed facts.\n\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Mr. Garza prays that this\n\nCourt grant his motion to recuse the judge hitherto presiding in this case, pursuant\n\nto TEX.

Background.\n\n\n      Applicant HUMBERTO GARZA was charged in Count One of the indictment\n\nin cause number CR-3175-04-G with the offense of Capital Murder, based on an\n\nallegation that he had caused the deaths of six individuals \"during the same criminal\n\ntransaction\" and charged in Count Two of the indictment in said case based on an\n\nallegation that he had caused the deaths of six individuals \"in the course of commit-\n\nting or attempting to commit the offense of robbery of(said individuals)\".\n\n      At the end of the guilt phase of a trial on these charges before 370th District\n\nCourt Judge Noe Gonzalez, the jury found Applicant guilty of the lesser-included\n\noffense of Murder as to Count One and the indicted Capital Murder as to Count Two.\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f      The jury then answered \"Yes\" to the future dangerousness and anti-parties\n\nspecial issues and \"No\" to the mitigating circumstances issue as to Count Two and,\n\naccordingly, Judge Gonzalez sentenced Applicant to death.\n\n      The jury also assessed a life sentence as to Count One.\n\n      Judge Gonzalez later allowed trial counsel for Applicant to withdraw;\n\nappointed Alan Futrell to represent Applicant in his direct appeal; and appo~nted Jolm\n\nE. Wright as habeas counsel for Applicant.\n\n      Since TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. Art. 37.071, Sec. 2 (h) (Supp. 2013)\n\nprovides that a capital murder conviction and death sentence is subject to automatic\n\nreview by the Court of Criminal Appeals, Applicant's appeal of his conviction and\n\ndeath sentence based on Count Two of the indictment was submitted to said Court.\n\n      In addition, Applicant's murder conviction and life sentence as to Count One\n\nwas submitted to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals.\n\n      On April 30, 2008, the Court of Criminal Appeals handed down a unanimous\n\nopinion affinning the judgment and death sentence as to Count Two. See Garza v.\n\nState, No. AP-75,217, 2008 Tex.Crim.App. Unpub. LEXIS 340 (April 30, 2008).\n\n      On August 28, 2008, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals issued an unpublished\n\nper curiam opinion in which it mentioned the Court of Criminal Appeals' opinion in\n\nthe death penalty case appeal; stated that the remedy for a violation of a defendant's\n\ndouble jeopardy rights was to vacate one of the convictions; noted that the Court of\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fCriminal Appeals had retained the \"most serious offense\" and affirmed the judgment\n\nand sentence of death in Count Two; and reversed and rendered the conviction and\n\nsentence in Count One for entry of an acquittal as to said count. See Garza v. State,\n\nNo. 13-05-00397-CR, 2008 Tex.App. LEXIS 6859 (Tex.App. - Corpus Christi 2008,\n\nno pet.) (not designated for publication).\n\n      On July 19 2007, Mr. Wright filed an application for writ of habeas corpus on\n\nbehalf of Applicant.\n\n      The State accepted service of a copy of said application, in lieu of formal\n\nservice thereof via certified mail, return receipt requested, on September 18, 2012.\n\n      On October 24, 2012, Mr. Wright filed an motion to withdraw and substitute\n\nattorney Hilary Sheard in which he says that he is unable to continue to represent\n\nApplicant because he has recently undergone open heart surgeries and because Texas\n\nlaw prohibits him, as an attorney who is now employed by a public defender's office,\n\nfrom engaging in the private practice of criminal law.\n\n       On November 9, 2012, this court granted Mr. Wright's motion to withdraw\n\nand substitute Ms. Sheard as habeas counsel for Applicant.\n\n       On November 13, 2012, the State filed Respondent's Original Answer to\n\nApplicant's application far writ, along with a proposed order designating issues.\n\n       On November 15, 2012, Judge Gonzalez entered an Order Designating Issues\n\nin which in which he indicated that there were unresolved fact issues; listed said\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fissues; pointed out that said issues may be resolved by having Applicant's trial attor-\n\nneys, Ralph R. Martinez and Librado \"Keno\" Vasquez, each submit an affidavit re-\n\nsponding to the allegations concerning their perfonnance; and ordered each of those\n\nattorneys to file an affidavit within twenty days of the date of said Order. Said Order\n\nalso stated that Applicant and Respondent were to then submit any proposed findings\n\nof fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation within twenty days after the filing\n\nof whichever affidavit was filed last.\n\n      Ralph R. Martinez submitted his affidavit on February 8, 2013 and Librado\n\n\"Keno\" Vasquez filed his affidavit on March 20, 2013.\n\n      Since Ms. Sheard took over this case from Mr. Wright, she has filed several\n\nextension requests asserting the need for additional time to be able to investigate the\n\nissues involved in this case.\n\n      Moreover, in an order dated April 7, 2014 addressing Ms. Sheard's latest\n\nextension request, the Court of Criminal Appeals indicated that it understands the\n\nintricacies involved in capital litigation, but that it also recognizes Ms. Sheard was, at\n\nthis point, limited to the claims raised in the application which Mr. Wright had filed\n\nin 2007. The Court of Criminal Appeals further ordered the trial court to rule on any\n\noutstanding motions in this case within thirty days of the date of said order and to\n\nresolve any outstanding issues in the case within ninety days of the date of said order\n\nand indicated that an order to show cause and notice to appear would issue against\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\fthe trial judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel if the completed case was not\n\nforwarded to it on or before July 31, 2014.\n\n       On May 12, 2014, Ms. Sheard filed a Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing in\n\nwhich she stated that the affidavits submitted by trial counsel lacked sufficient detail\n\nto be able to adequately resolve the issues concerning adequacy of their performance;\n\nthat a live evidentiary hearing was thus necessary; and that the State had indicated\n\nthat it did not oppose a hearing, although it was concerned about ensuring com-\n\npliance with the deadlines set by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\n       Judge Gonzalez then held a scheduling conference with the attorneys in this\n\ncase and indicated that he would hold a live evidentiary hearing on June 9, 2014.\n\n       On May 27, 2014, Ms. Sheard filed \"Applicant's Motion to Court to Recuse\n\nItself\" in this case.\n\n       In said motion, Ms. Sheard stated that the application for writ filed in 2007 had\n\nincluded a claim that Applicant had been denied his right to a fair trial before an im-\n\npartial jury because of the hostile atmosphere in the courtroom and that Applicant's\n\ndeath sentence had resulted from alleged jury misconduct, namely a judicial com-\n\nment that gangs would sometimes come after jurors, a comment by the bailiff that the\n\njudge was carrying a gun; and the conduct of the trial in an atmosphere of gang vio-\n\nlence. She also indicated that she and an investigator had interviewed former juror\n\nRose Marie Palacios, who had been known as Rose Marie Vera when she served as a\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fjuror; that Ms. Palacios had provided additional details not mentioned in the affidavit\n\nshe had given in 2007; that this information had made it apparent to her that Judge\n\nGonzalez had to be asked to recuse himself; and that it led to a conclusion that Judge\n\nGonzalez' knowledge of evidentiary facts that are in dispute and the possible appear-\n\nance of impropriety and lack of impartiality if Judge Gonzalez continued to deter-\n\nmine the relevant issues compelled filing of the motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n      After discussing the law governing recusal of judges, Ms. Sheard prayed that\n\nJudge Gonzalez either recuse himself or request that the Presiding Judge of this\n\nadministrative district hear the motion himself or assign another judge to do so.\n\n       Judge Gonzalez utilized the latter option and I 39th District Court Judge J.R.\n\n\"Bobby\" Flores was assigned to hear the motion to recuse.\n\n       Accordingly, a hearing was held in the l39th District Court, before Judge\n\nFlores, on June 16, 2014.\n\n       During said hearing, testimony was presented by former juror Rose Marie\n\nPalacios, formerly known as Rose Marie Vera; former juror Melissa Guerrero; and\n\nAlicia uLicha\" Salinas, who had been the bailiff for the 370th District Court at the\n\ntime of the trial of Applicant's case.\n\n       After hearing testimony from those witnesses and the argument of counsel,\n\nJudge Flores requested that the parties submit a memorandum and copies of the cases\n\nthey were relying on. Accordingly, the State is now submitting this memorandum.\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fII.    Fonnat of This Response.\n\n\n       In this document, the State will first describe the legal principles applicable to\n\nevaluation of the motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez. In next applying those principles\nto the evidence presented at the hearing on said motion, the State will demonstrate\n\nthat Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to support his request that Judge\n\nGonzalez be recused from further involvement in this habeas proceeding.\n\n\nIII.   Applicable Legal Principles.\n\n\n       First of all, a Texas judge may be removed from presiding over a case if (1) he\n\nis constitutionally disqualified, (2) he is subject to a statutory strike, or (3) he is sub~\n\nject to statutory disqualification or recusal under Texas Supreme Court rules. See,\n\ne.g., Gaal v. State, 332 S.W.3d 448, 452 (Tex. Crim.App. 2011); Rhodes v. State,\n\n357 S.W.3d 796,799 (Tex.App.- Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. ref d).\n\n       Secondly, generally a motion to recuse seeks to prevent a judge from hearing a\n\ncase because of a non-constitutional reason, while ground for disqualification are\n\nlimited to those identified in the constitution. See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 452.\n\n       Third, the Court of Criminal Appeals has pointed out that Rule 18b (2) of the\n\nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure sets out the law concerning recusal and includes in-\n\nstances in which a judge must step down from hearing a case for reasons other than\n\nthe disqualifying grounds listed in the constitution. See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 452-53.\n\n\n                                             7\n\f      Fourth, Texas Courts have also noted that Rule 18b (2) states, in pertinent part,\n\nthat, \"a judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in which (a) his impartiality\n\nmight reasonably be questioned or (b) he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning\n\nthe subject matter or a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\n\nconcerning the proceeding.      See,~      Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 43; Youkers v. State, 400\n\nS.W.3d 200,206 (Tex.App.- Dallas 2013, pet. rerd); Rhodes, 357 S.W.3d at 799.\n\n      Fifth, the Court of Criminal Appeals has also stated that there is a lot of over-\n\nlap between the two subsections, but that the first basis for recusal mentioned in Rule\n\n18b (2)--that the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned-appears to be\n\none that the parties may use when in doubt as to any more concrete reason why the\n\njudge should not preside and noted that Justice Kennedy had stated, in his concurring\n\nopinion in Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 558, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1258, 127\n\nL.Ed. 2d 474 (1994) that a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned \"only\n\nif it appears that he or she harbors an aversion, hostility or disposition of a kind that a\n\nfair-minded person could not set aside when judging the dispute\". See Gaal, 332\n\nS.W.3d at 453. 1\n\n       Sixth, the Court of Criminal Appeals has also pointed out that Rule 18b (2)(b)\n\nis more specific and covers how the judge feels and what the judge knows; that the\n\nFourth Court of Appeals had, for example, held in Abdygapparova v. State, 243\n\n1\n Lower court cases have mentioned this reference to Justice Kennedy's remarks. See Diaz v. State,\n380 S.W.3d 309,312 (Tex.App.- Fort Worth 2012, pet. rerd); Rhodes, 357 S.W.3d at 799-800.\n\n\n                                                8\n\fS.W.3d 191, 208~10 (Tex.App.- San Antonio 2007, pet. rerd) that the trial judge's\n\nfeeling of personal bias was evidenced by ex parte communications with the prosecu-\n\ntor in which the judge provided guidance to the prosecutor on how to present his case\n\nand discussed the judge's initial ruling regarding the defendant's ongoing request for\n\nan interpreter; and that the situation where the trial judge interrupted a suppression\n\nhearing and announced that he had himself observed the conduct that had led to the\n\ndefendant's initial detention which was involved in Gentry v. State, No. 06-05~\n\n00237-CR, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS 2923 (Tex.App.- Texarkana 2006, no pet.) (not\n\ndesignated for publication) was an illustration of a clear instance of \"personal know-\n\nledge of disputed evidentiary facts\" requiring recusal. See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 453.\n\n      Seventh, said Court has also indicated that recusal is, however, generally not\n\nrequired when based solely on judicial rulings, remarks, or actions; that those acts\n\nalmost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion; that they may be\n\nproper grounds for appeal, but not for recusal; and that opinions formed by the judge\n\non the basis of facts introduced, or events occurring, during the current or prior pro-\n\nceedings do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a\n\ndeep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\n\nSee Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 454, quoting Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. at 1157.\n\n      Eighth, Texas courts have further stated that a judge's remarks that are critical,\n\ndisapproving, or hostile to counsel, the parties, or their cases will thus usually not\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fsupport a bias or partiality challenge, although they may do so if they reveal an opin·\n\nion based on extrajudicial information and will require recusal if they reveal ''such a\n\nhigh degree of favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible\";\n\nthat expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and anger that are within\n\nthe bounds of what imperfect people display do not establish bias or partiality; and\n\nthat a judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration thus do not make him sub-\n\nject to recusal. See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 454; Rhodes, 357 S.W.3d at 800.\n\n      Ninth, said Court has also stated that, although intemperate remarks or un-\n\nethical conduct may well violate a rule of judicial conduct, such a violation does not\n\nnecessarily mean that the judge should be recused.        See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 455;\n\nWesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 121 (Tex.Crim.App. 2000); Kemp v. State, 846\n\nS.W.2d 289, 305 (Tex.Crim.App. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 918, 113 S.Ct. 2361,\n\n124 L.Ed.2d 268 ( 1993 ).\n\n       Tenth, the courts have stated that judicial bias can result in disqualification, but\n\nonly does so when it is shown to be of such a nature and to such an extent as to deny\n\nthe defendant due process of law. See, ~' Wesbrook, 29 S. W .3d at 121 ; McCienan\n\nv. State, 661 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex.Crim.App. 1983), overruled on other grounds by\n\nDeLeon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 {Tex.Crim.App. 2004); Abdygapparovg, 243 S.W.\n\n3d at 198; Rosas v. State, 76 S.W.3d 771, 775 (Tex.App.- Houston [1st Dist.] 2002,\n\nno pet.).\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f      Eleventh, there is a presumption ofjudicial impartiality. See,~ Durrough v.\n\nState, 620 S.W.2d 134, 143 (Tex.Crim.App. 1981); Ex parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109,\n\n117 {Tex.App.- Austin 2008, no pet.); Abdygapparov§, 243 S.W.3d at 198.\n\n      Twelfth, an appellate court must utilize an abuse of discretion standard in\n\nreviewing an order denying a motion to recuse and should not reverse a judge hearing\n\nthe motion whose ruling on the motion is within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\nSee,~'    Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 456; Wesbrook, 29 S.W.3d at 120-21; Kemp, 846\n\nS.W.2d at 306; Rhodes, 357 S.W.3d at 800; Abdygapparova, 243 S.W.3d at 197-98.\n\n      Thirteenth, in applying said standard, the appellate court must consider the\n\ntotality of the evidence and information elicited at the recusal hearing to see if the\n\nrecord reveals sufficient evidence to support the recusal judge's ruling that the trial\n\njudge was unbiased. See,~' Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 456; Kemp, 846 S.W.2d at 306;\n\nRhodes, 357 S.W.3d at 800.\n\n      Fourteenth, a high threshold must be met in order to recuse a judge and the\n\nproper inquiry to be made in evaluating a request to do so is whether a reasonable\n\nmember of the public at large, knowing all of the facts in the public domain concern-\n\ning the judge and the case, would have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually\n\nimpartial. See,~, Kemp, 846 S.W.2d at 305; McClenan, 661 S.W.2d at 109; Ellis,\n\n275 S.W.3d at 116; Abdygapparova, 243 S.W.3d at 198; Burkett v. State, 196\n\nS.W.3d 892, 896 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2006, no pet.); Rosas, 76 S.W.3d at 774.\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fIV.   Application ofThese Principles to the Facts Presented at the Recusal Hearing.\n\n\n      Application of these legal principles to the facts adduced at the hearing on Ap-\n\nplicant's motion to recuse Judge Gomalez demonstrates that Applicant has not met\nhis burden to establish a sufficient factual basis to warrant granting of his request.\n\n      First of all, former juror Rose Marie Palacios merely referred in general terms\n\nto having had concerns for her personal safety; said that other jurors and \"the judge\n\nand stuff like that\" had told the jurors that sometimes some of the jurors could be in\n\ndanger; indicated that she had been afraid of being followed, or talked to, or maybe\n\nbeing threatened; indicated that her concerns had mostly been the result of other\n\njurors talking about their fears; and stated that she had not really thought about \"if'.\n\n       However, Ms. Palacios never provided any specifics about any remarks made\n\nby any particular individual, including what exactly had been said, who had made\n\nsaid comments, or when said remarks had been made.\n\n       Secondly, Ms. Palacios also stated that the evidence of gang activity in the\n\ncase had increased her concerns, but also admitted that the facts of the case involved\n\ngangs on both sides and that people she had seen in the parking lot or the courtroom\n\nthat had concerned her could be family members of either the victims or Applicant.\n\n       Third, Ms. Palacios further stated that her concerns had been increased_ when\n\nsomeone in the audience took a photograph toward the jury, but further acknow-\n\nledged that Judge Gonzalez had reassured the jury that that person was a legitimate\n\n\n                                            12\n\fmember of the media and that he would make sure that said individual was reminded\n\nof the policy not to take photographs which identified jurors when the jurors' concern\n\nabout the photograph was somehow conveyed to him.\n\n      Fourth, Ms. Palacios also said that male members of the jury had been talking\n\nto the bailiff about gang activity, seeing gang members' families in the courtroom,\n\nand someone carrying the photograph while the jury was in the jury room at some\n\nunspecified point during the guilt phase of trial; that someone had told the bailiff that\n\nthey hoped that she was carrying a gun; and that the bailiff had responded that she\n\ndid not do so, but that the jurors did not have to worry because the judge had a gun.\n\n      However, Alicia \"Licha\" Salinas, who had been the bailiff during Applicant's\n\ntrial, testified that she had not carried a gun while serving in that capacity; that she\n\ndid not remember ever telling anyone that Judge Gonzalez carried a gun; that she\n\ndoes not think that she would have told anybody that Judge Gonzalez carried a gun;\n\nand that Judge Gonzalez did not, to her knowledge, carry a gun \"back then\".\n\n      Accordingly, there is a clear-cut factual dispute concerning whether Ms. Sali-\n\nnas had made a remark about Judge Gonzalez carrying a gun for this court, as the\n\nfact-finder in regard to the motion to recuse to resolve.\n\n      Moreover, the State would submit that Ms. Salinas' testimony on this subject\n\nis more credible than that of Ms. Palacios, particularly in light of the lack of any cred-\n\nible explanation why a court bailiff would volunteer such prejudicial information.\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\f      Fifth, even under Ms. Palacios' version of events, the remark Ms. Salinas\n\nallegedly made was that Judge Gonzalez had a gun, which literally merely means that\n\nhe possessed some type of gun, such as a hunting rifle, at some undisclosed location,\n\nsuch as his residence.\n\n      Sixth, Ms. Palacios further indicated that the bailiff had further assured the\n\njurors that the court would make sure that the jurors were allowed to park closer to\n\nthe courtroom when they worked into the evening.\n\n      Seventh, Ms. Palacios said that Judge Gonzalez had, at one point during the\n\nguilt phase of trial, come into the jury room to re-assure the jurors that h~ understood\n\ntheir concerns about their safety, reassure them that he was going to provide security\n\nfor them, and let the jury know that the person who had taken the photograph which\n\nhad concerned them was legitimate and that he would make sure that the photograph\n\nwould not become public.\n\n      However, Ms. Palacios also admitted that, when Judge Gonzalez came to talk\n\nto the jurors, it would concern issues concerning scheduling and whether the jurors\n\nwould be available to finish the trial or work late.\n\n      Eighth, although Ms. Palacios mentioned Judge Gonzalez speaking to the jury\n\nin response to a note from some jurors, she did not give any specific information\n\nabout the content of any such note, at what point the note had been sent, which juror\n\nor jurors had sent the note, or the content of the judge's response to the note.\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f      Moreover, while it was suggested that an oral communication outside of the\n\npresence of Applicant and the attorneys involved in the case would be improper, any\n\nsuch improper conduct would merely involve an arguable violation of the rules of\n\njudicial conduct and would not constitute evidence of judicial bias or lack of impar-\n\ntiality sufficient to show that Judge Gonzalez should be recused from this case.\n\n       Ninth, Ms. Palacios acknowledged that her first affidavit, which she executed\n\nin 2007, mentioned a time when she thought that Applicant's mother was sitting\n\nalone in the parking lot when she went to her car; that someone had told a member of\n\nthe court staff; and that she had been reassured that the court would take care of the\n\nsituation.\n\n       Tenth, former juror Melissa Guerrero merely testified that she had had con-\n\ncerns about her personal safety during the first few days of the trial, because of the\n\nextent of the crime involved and the fact that the case had to do with gang violence.\n\n       Ms. Guerrero further indicated that \"nothing really was mentioned\" by the\n\nother jurors about the security situation; that they had been concerned about being\n\nfollowed while walking to their cars; and that the jurors had also been concerned\n\nabout the incident where a reporter had taken a photograph of the jury.\n\n       Eleventh, Ms. Guerrero also said that Judge Gonzalez had come into the jury\n\nroom on about the fifth or sixth day of the trial to calm down those jurors who had\n\nhad questions or concerns about their safety; that the jurors had been allowed to park\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fin a different area at some point and to be released from court first; and that she\n\nassumed that the change had occurred because of the concerns about security.\n\n         Twelfth, Ms. Guerrero indicated that the only other time Judge Gonzalez had\n\ncome to talk to the jury was when he came to thank them for their service and pro-\n\nvide information if anyone wanted counseling after serving in this death penalty case.\n\n         Finally, although Ms. Palacios and Ms. Guerrero were not asked any questions\n\nabout the effect of the events they were describing on their deliberations during their\n\ntestimony at the hearing on the motion to recuse, Judge Flores took judicial notice of\n\nthe contents of the court file pertaining to this case, which included the affidavits by\n\nMs. Palacios which are attached to Applicant's motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n         Furthermore, Ms. Guerrero says that she would have voted differently if she\n\nhad known that a co-defendant had received a lesser sentence in her 2007 affidavit;\n\nstates that certain defense witnesses at the punishment phase had not had any impact\n\non her in her 20 14 affidavit, and also says, in the latter affidavit, that the issue of\n\nsecurity had played a big role in her decision on the future dangerousness special\n\nISSUe.\n\n\n         Because this material is thus arguably part of Applicant's effort to show that\n\nthe jury had had concerns about their safety, the State must, out of an abundance of\n\ncaution, note that TEX. R. EVID. ANN. 606 (b) does not allow a juror to testify or\n\nprovide an affidavit \"as to any matter or statement occurring during the jury's delib-\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\ferations, or to the effect of anything on any juror's mind or emotions or mental pro-\n\ncesses, as influencing any juror's assert to or dissent from the verdict or indictment\".\n\n      The State would also note that the Court of Criminal Appeals recently\n\ndiscussed this principle in Colyer v. State, 428 S.W.3d 117 (Tex.Crim.App. 2014)?\n\n       In particular, in Colyer, said Court noted that the purpose of Rule 606 (b) is to\n\nlimit \"the role jurors may play in attacking the validity of a verdict\"; that this limita-\n\ntion serves the important policy interests of (I) encouraging jurors to candidly dis-\n\ncuss the case; (2) protecting jurors from post-trial harassment, (3) promoting finality,\n\nand (4) preventing tampering and fraud; that courts try to maintain the balance be-\n\ntween the goal of a trial by a jury free from bias or misconduct and the need to pre-\n\nvent losing parties from trying the jury; and that Rule 606 (b) and the case law have\n\ngenerally struck the balance in favor of the privacy of deliberations. Id. at 15-16.\n\n       The Court of Criminal Appeals next stated that the most common, but dis-\n\nallowed, means to impeach the jury's verdict is the \"disgruntled juror''; that a juror\n\nwho reluctantly joined a verdict is likely to be sympathetic to overtures by the loser\n\nand persuadable to the view that his own consent rested on false or impermissible\n\nconsiderations; that allowing such jurors to impeach their former verdict would give\n\nthe losing party much to gain and little to lose in harassing all of the former jurors in\n\n2\n  Although LexisNexus indicates that Colyer has now been published at 428 S.W.3d 117, it does not\ninclude mention of page numbers within said publication of said case. For this reason, in describing\npassages in said caset the State has utilized the references found in the Lexis citation to Colyer v.\nState, No. PD·0305~13, 2014 Tex.Crim.App. LEXIS 636 (April30, 2014).\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fa search for a \"disgruntled\" one; and that \"Rule 606 (b) flatly prohibits 'disgruntled\n\njuror' evidence either by affidavit or testimony\". Id. at* 17.\n\n      Said Court next indicated that the purpose of the exception to Rule 606 (b)\n\nwhich allows testimony about outside influences is to allow proof of external pres-\n\nsures that are likely to influence the verdict; that, in McQuarrie v. State, 380 S.W.3d\n\n145, 154 (Tex.Crim.App. 2012), it had explained that an \"outside influence\" is\n\n\"something originating from a source outside of the jury room and other than from\n\nthe jurors themselves\"; that a Rule 606 (b) inquiry is, therefore, limited to that which\n\noccurs both outside of the jury room and outside of the jurors' personal knowledge\n\nand experience; that external events or information, unrelated to the trial, which hap-\n\npen to cause jurors to feel personal pressure to hasten or end deliberations are not\n\n''outside influences\" because they are caused by a juror's personal and emotional re-\n\naction to information that is irrelevant to the trial issues; that those kinds of internal\n\npersonal pressures are normal and may be expected in any trial; and that they are,\n\nfurthermore, not \"improperly brought to bear\" upon the juror in a manner designed or\n\nlikely to influence deliberations. Id. at *17-19.\n\n       The Court of Criminal Appeals also stated that Texas cases have concluded\n\nthat allowing normal personal pressures to qualify as 'outside influences\" would jeo-\n\npardize the finality of virtually every verdict; that, under Colyer's interpretation, any\n\njuror who had had second thoughts about his vote could retroactively claim that a\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\fpersonal pressure made him apprehensive and eager to conclude the deliberations;\n\nthat Rule 606 (b) explicitly prohibits post-verdict testimony about a juror's mental\n\nprocesses to impeach the verdict; and that most jurors feel some type of normal\n\ninternal, individual pressures throughout the entire trial. Id. at *26-30.\n\n      The State would submit that the remarks about jurors who have second-\n\nthoughts about their decisions which the Court of Criminal Appeals made in Colyer\n\nare clearly relevant to evaluation of the credibility of the testimony and affidavits\n\nprovided by former jurors Rose Marie Palacios and Melissa Guerrero.\n\n\nV.    The Unique Aspect of This Recusal Motion: It Seeks Recusal In Regard to a\n      Proceeding In Which the Judge Is Allowed to Utilize Personal Recollection.\n\n\n      The State is compelled to mention one more other point before concluding this\n\nresponse to Applicant's motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n      Applicant's motion seeks to recuse Judge Gonzalez from further involvement\n\nin this post-conviction habeas proceeding in a death penalty case under TEX. CODE\n\nCRIM. PROC. ANN. Art. 11.071 (Supp. 201.3).\n\n      The present status of this case is that an application for writ and an answer\n\nhave been filed, an Order Designating Issues has been entered, trial counsel have sub-\n\nmitted affidavits, Applicant has filed a motion for a live courtroom hearing, said\n\nmotion has been granted, and the hearing which Judge Gonzalez had scheduled has\n\nbeen put on hold pending disposition of the motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n\n                                           19\n\f      Accordingly, the next step to be taken once the recusal issue is resolved would\n\nbe to hold the live courtroom hearing; have both sides submit proposed fmdings of\n\nfact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation; and have whatever judge ends up\n\npresiding over this case enter findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n      Moreover, the Court of Criminal Appeals April 7, 2014 order imposes some\n\ntime pressure for those matters to occur.\n\n      Typically, a trial judge is expected to be unfamiliar with the facts of the case\n\nand the parties involved, although the case law mentioned earlier indicates that some\n\nknowledge of the case, such as information derived from having tried the case\n\ninvolving a co-defendant, is not necessarily grounds for recusal.\n\n       However, this case, a post-conviction habeas proceeding, involves a somewhat\n\ndifferent situation.\n\n       After all, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. Art. 11.071, Sec. 9 (a) (Supp.\n\n2013) states that, in order to resolve any designated controverted, previously un-\n\nresolved fact issues material to the legality of the applicant's confinement, \"the court\n\nmay require affidavits, depositions, interrogatories, and evidentiary hearings and may\n\nuse personal recollection\".\n\n       The clear implication of this last phrase is thus that the court may have some\n\nlevel of personal knowledge of the relevant disputed fact issues and is not required to\n\nbe totally without any knowledge concerning them.\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\f      Admittedly, the statute and case law do not specify the extent of personal\n\nrecollection which the trial judge is allowed to utilize and what level of knowledge\n\nwould be too much to allow him to remain impartial and would thus require recusal.\n\n      The State would, nonetheless, submit that, wherever the line should be drawn,\n\nthe evidence which Applicant has produced in support of his motion to recuse does\n\nnot support a conclusion that Judge Gonzalez' impartiality might reasonably be\n\nquestioned and that he should be recused from further involvement in this case.\n\n\nVI.   Conclusion and Prayer.\n\n\n      This Court should deny Applicant's motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez based\n\nupon the lack of sufficient factual support for Applicant's contention that Judge Gon-\n\nzalez' impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\n\n      Accordingly, the State prays that this Court deny Applicant's motion to recuse\n\nJudge Gonzalez.\n\n\n                                            Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                            RENE GUERRA,\n                                            CRIIvfiNAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY\n                                            HIDALGO COUNTY, TEXAS\n                                               c      .....?                      #\n\n\n\n\n                                               L/~c:'~\n                                            THEODORE C.

Judge Noe Gonzalez is the district judge of the 370111 Judicial District Court\n\n      of Hidalgo County, Texas.\n\n2.    Humberto Garza III is the Applicant in this capital habeas corpus\n\n      proceeding, filed pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 11 0.071.\n\n3.    The habeas Application in this case was filed on July 19,2007, by former\n\n      counsel John E. Wright, Esq. The Application contained allegations that:\n\n      •      Mr. Garza was denied his right to a fair trial before an impartial jury\n             under the Sixth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment and the Due\n\n\n                                     Page 1 ofl4\n\f                Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because of the hostile\n                atmosphere in the courtroom (Claim 4);\n\n       •        Mr. Garza's death sentence resulted from jury misconduct, including\n                the exposure of the jury to outside influences, namely a comment to\n                the jury by the trial judge that gangs would sometimes come after\n                jurors, a comment by the bailiff that the judge was carrying a gun,\n                and the conduct of the trial in an atmosphere of gang violence, as well\n                as premature deliberations, and the conveying of extra-record\n                infonnation by two jurors to the other jury members (Claims 5 & 6).\n\n\n4.         These allegations were supported by:\n\n       •        Exhibit 2: A listing of coverage of the trial from the local newspaper\n                \"The Monitor;\"\n\n       •        Exhibit 23 and 24: Affidavit and Declaration ofjuror Miguel\n                Martinez;\n\n       •        Exhibit 25: Declaration ofjuror Felipe Hernandez;\n\n       •        Exhibit 26: Affidavit ofjuror Rose Marie Vera;\n\n       •        Exhibit 27: Affidavit ofjuror Melissa Guerrero\n\n5.     The affidavit ofjuror Rose Marie Vera, Exhibit 27, indicated that the trial\n\n       judge had \"warned us that sometimes gang members come after the jury,\"\n\n       that the judge had given reassurance to the jurors about a journalist who had\n\n       taken a photograph in the courtroom, and that a bailiff had told the jury that\n                                  1\n       the judge carried a gun.\n\n\n\n       1\n        Applicant was alleged to be a leader of the \"Tri-City Bombers\" gang, and was charged\nwith carrying out a six-victim robbery-homicide along with other gang members.\n                                         Page2ofl4\n\f6.    Jurors Miguel Martinez and Melissa Guerrero, as well as Rose Marie Vera,\n\n      indicated that they had been concerned for their safety during the trial. See\n\n      Exhibits 24, 26, 27.\n\n1.    The Answer filed by the State of Texas on November 13,2012, contended,\n\n      at 387, that these claims \"are based on factual premises of doubtful validity!'\n\n8.    The Answer continued: ''the fact that Applicant merely argues that exposure\n\n      of the jury to the information to which he refers had been likely to have\n\n      denied him the impartial system to which he was entitled demonstrated the\n\n      lack of validity of his arguments.•.. Habeas relief must be based on a\n\n      showing that a constitutional right was violated, and not merely a claim that\n\n      it is likely that it was violated.\" Jd\n\n9.    The 2007 affidavit of Rose Marie Vera, which was obtained by volunteer\n\n      law students, did not specify whether the comment made by the judge about\n\n      gangs was made in open court (it does not appear on the record), what were\n\n      the circumstances in which the bailiff was talking to the jury about the\n\n      judge, and what the influence of the judge and bailiff's comments had been\n\n      on Ms. Vera's sentencing decision.\n\n10.   Undersigned counsel filed a series of funding applications for investigative\n\n      expenses in this matter. Unfortunately, the requested funding was not\n\n      granted in full, and investigative work on the case has therefore been\n\n                                       Pagel of14\n\f        sporadic. Counsel experienced great difficulty in scheduling her\n\n        investigator's work as a result: neither she nor the investigator are local to\n\n        the area, and the investigator has had other substantial commitments to\n\n        capital trial cases. Thus, additional jury interviewing was only recently\n\n        conducted, with undersigned counsel accompanying the investigator, Kristi\n\n        Bishop.\n\nB.      Newly-Discovered Facts Indicating the Need for the Court's Rec:usal.\n\nI 1.    On Sunday May 18, 2014, undersigned counsel, together with Ms. Bishop,\n\n        interviewed Rose Marie Vera, now known as Rose Marie Palacios, at her\n\n        home.\n\n12.     On Monday May 19,2014, Ms. Palacios signed an affidavit repeating\n\n        matters she had discussed in the interview of May 18, 2012, which included\n\n        more detailed infonnation than was previously known to counse1:2\n\n13.     In her affidavit, Ms. Palacios explained that the judge, the Hon. Noe\n\n       Gonzalez, had spoken to the jury in the jwy room behind the courtroom on\n\n        more than one occasion. In addition to talking to the jury about the security\n\n       risk that gang members represented to jurors, the judge also spoke to them in\n\n       response to notes they had sent out.\n\n\n       2\n         Copies of both Ms. Vera/Palacios' affidavits are attached. The affidavit of May 19,\n2014, will be submitted as part of a volume of supplemental exhibits to the habeas application\nbeing filed with the court.\n                                          Page4of14\n\f14.   Ms. Palacios stated that, so far as she could recall, the attorneys representing\n\n      the State and the defense were not present at the time the judge warned the\n\n      jury about gangs, or at any time when he was with them in the jury room.\n\n15.   Ms. Palacios identified the bailiff who had told the jury members that the\n\n      judge carried a gun as being a woman named \"Licha.\" Some members of\n\n      the jury had told Licha that they were concerned about their personal safety,\n\n      and Licha had told them that Judge Gonzalez always carried a gun. Ms.\n\n      Palacios believed that Judge Gonzalez was in the habit of carrying a gun\n\n      because he had been threatened in the past.\n\n16.   Ms. Palacios concluded that: \"It is my belief that the issue of security during\n\n      the trial played a big role in my decision on the issue of deciding whether\n\n      Mr. Garza was a future danger to society. I had my own security concerns\n\n      very much in mind, and they were increased by Licha' s comment about the\n\n      judge carrying a gun, and by what the judge said about the gang following\n\n      jurors.\"\n\n17.   Now that Ms. Palacios has explained the circumstances of both the court and\n\n      its bailiff's conduct, for example, by ascertaining that her reference to the\n\n      trial court talking about gangs following jurors was not a mishearing of\n\n      something said on the open record, it has become apparent to undersigned\n\n      counsel that the court must be asked to recuse itself.\n\n                                     PageSofl4\n\f18.     This motion is not predicated on any allegation that Judge Gonzalez harbors\n\n        any personal bias against applicant However, and unfortunately, the newly\n\n        discovered facts lead to the inevitable conclusion that the court's personal\n\n        knowledge of evidentiary facts that are in dispute, and the possible\n\n        appearance of impropriety and lack of impartiality if he continues to\n\n        detennine the relevant issues, compel the filing of this motion on Mr.\n\n        Garza's behalf. 3\n\n                                      Law and Argument\n\n      The court can got preside over this proceeding because it has personal\n      knowledge of disputed evidentiaa facts concerning Applicant's trial.\n\n\n        Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b(b) provides various grounds for recusal,\n\nsuch as where the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, where the\n\njudge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or party, or has\n\npersonal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.                 TEX.\n\nR. CIV. P. 18b(b); Gaalv. State, 332 S.W.3d 448,453 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n20 II)( discussing statutory bases for recusal).\n\n\n\n       3\n           Undersigned counsel has discussed this situation with Assistant District Attorney\nTheodore C. Hake who, like undersigned counsel, is concerned that this motion for the court to\nrecuse itself may jeopardize the deadline for completion of the case of July 31, 2014, imposed by\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals in an order of April7, 2014. Notwithstanding the scheduling\ndifficulties that this motion for recusal might entail, undersigned counsel has no alternative but\nto file it, in order to ensure that Mr. Garza's receive an appropriate adjudication of these habeas\ncorpus proceedings.\n                                           Page6of14\n\f           Although there is no comparable criminal rule or statute to TEX. R. Ctv. P.\n\n 18b, the Court of Criminal Appeals has held that the civil rules on disqualification\n\napply unless there is legislative intent indicating otherwise. See McC/enan v. State,\n\n661 S.W.2d 108, 110 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983). Because there is no legislative\n\nintent otherwise, TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b applies in this case.\n\n           TEX. R. Ctv. P. 18b(b)(3) plainly states that a '~udge must recuse in any\n\nproceeding in which ... the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary\n\nfacts concerning the proceeding.\" TEx. R. Crv. P. 18b(b)(3). When a judge has\n\npersonally witnessed the events whose existence and legal significance he would\n\nhave to decide, he must recuse himself. See, e.g., Gentry v. State, No. 06-05-\n\n00237-CR, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 2923 (Tex. App.- Texarkana April 12, 2006,\n\nno. pet.)Gudge could not conduct suppression hearing where he had himself\n\nobserved conduct leading to initial detention}.\n\n       It appears that the court here was communicating with the jury privately,\n\nwhereas TEX. CoDE CRJM. PROC. Art. 36.27 mandates that all communications\n\nbetween jurors and the trial court must be written, with the court's responses to\n\njuror questions also being in writing, where possible after securing the presence of\n\nthe defendant and counsel, and being read out in open court unless expressly\n\nwaived by the defendant.4 The court will have personal knowledge of whether or\n\n       4\n        There are jury notes in the record, 2 CR 925-942. many dealing with \"housekeeping\"\nmatters such as bathroom breaks or requests for food, to which no written response appears.\n                                         Page7 ofl4\n\fnot there were such communications conducted without following the strictures of\n\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 36.27.5\n\n           Moreover, the court would have personal knowledge both of whether or not\n\nhe carries a gun, and whether the bailiff would know that fact. The court may also\n\nhave personal knowledge of what the bailiff said to the jury members about his\n\nowning a gun.\n\n           The State has already questioned the \"validity'' of the factual premises of\n\nApplicant's claims concerning outside influences upon the jury; Applicant\n\ncontends that those outside influences did exist, and did have a deleterious impact\n\non the fairness of the proceedings against him. Thus, there exist here\n\n\"controverted, previously unresolved factual issues,\" under TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC.      Art. 11.071 § 9 (a).6\n\n\nTwo notes, requesting guidance as to the charge, do include the court's written response, 2 CR\n931 and 935, but there is nothing in the record to indicate that there was any consultation with\ncounsel, nor were the responses read in open court. While there is one note indicating juror\nconcem that people were able to overhear their deliberations at a point when they had gone into\ndte courtroom in order to deliberate there, 2 CR 929, there is no written response to that note.\nThus, it appears that TEx. CODE CRJM. Paoc. Art. 36.27 was not being scrupulously followed.\n       ''\"(A]ny private communication, contac~ or tamperin& directly or indirectly, with a juror\nduring a trial about a matter pending before the jury is ... deemed presumptively prejudicial, if\nnot made in pursuance of known rules of the court ••. with full knowledge of the parties.\"\nRemmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227,229 (1954); Mallox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140\n( 1892).\n\n        'The existing Order Designating Issues ofNovember IS, 2012, drafted by the State, does\nnot include these claims among those to be resolved by way of a hearing. Applicant's Motion\nfor Evidentiary Hearing of May 9, 2014, indicated that it might be necessmy to ask for additional\nissues to be designated. Now that Applicant has clarification from Ms. Palacios as to what\noccurred at Mr. Garza's trial, a proposed order designating additional issues to be heard by the\n                                          Page 8 ofl4\n\f           The eourt eannot preside oyer this proeeeding because its impartialiu\n                         might reasonably be questioned..\n\n        A trial judge must recuse himself in any proceeding in which ''the judge's\n\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"          TEX. R. CIV. P.   18b(b)(I).\n\n        The impartiality of the judiciary is indeed one of the most fundamental and\n\nindispensable aspects of the American system ofjustice and of due process. See,\n\ne.g., Tumey v. Ohio, 213 U.S. 510, 532 (1927). 7 In order \"to promote public\n\nconfidence in the integrity of the judicial process,\" judges must not only be\n\nimpartial, but reasonably be perceived to be impartial. Liljeberg v. Health Services\n\nAcquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847,859-860 (1988). Due process requires recusal not\n\nonly when a judge is biased, but when there is merely an appearance of bias in the\n\neyes of a reasonable, non-judicial observer. The Supreme Court explained:\n\n               Such a strinJtent rule may sometimes bar trial by jud.ttes\n               who have no actual bias and who would do their very\n               best to wei.tth the scales of justice equally between the\n               contendina parties. but to perform its hi.tth function in the\n               best wav. \"justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\"\n               Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11, 14 (1954).\n\nIn re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955).\n\n        The court's recusal is mandated not only by caselaw and the Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, but also by the Code of Judicial Conduct. The Code of Judicial\n\n\nCourt is being filed separately.\n       7\n        See also Panetti v. Quarterman, SS I U.S. 930, 949-50 (2007)(even after conviction and\nsentence. state court proceedings must still provide sufficient procedural due process to accord\nwith fundamental fairness).\n                                          Page9ofl4\n\fConduct requires a judge to avoid involvement in any case where he or she would\n\nnot be impartial, or where the appearance ofimpartiality would not exist. See Tex.\n\nCODEJUD. CON., Canons 2(A) & (B), 3(B)(5). The appearance ofjustice is an\n\nessential part of the right to a fair tribunal. Bradshaw v. McCotter, 185 F.2d 1327,\n\n 1329 (5th Cir. 1986). Bias may be used as a basis for disqualifying a judge when it\n\nis shown to be of such a nature and to such an extent as to deny the defendant due\n\nprocess of law. Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 454-5; McClenan v. State, 661 S.W.2d 108,\n\n II 0 (Tex. Crim. App 1983); Norton v. State, 155 S. W.2d 522, 524 (Tex. App. -\n\nHouston (1st Dist.]1988),pet. ref. 111 S.W.2d 560 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989).\n\n        In order to adjudicate Claims 5 and 6 - with or without a hearing - the court\n\nwould be compelled to decide the extra-record factual issue of whether his own\n\nbailiff had told the jury that it always carried a gun, and to decide the issues of\n\nwhether the court itself had communicated with the jury off the record, what had\n\nbeen said, and whether what was said would have prejudiced the outcome of\n\nApplicant's trial and sentencing.8\n\n        However the court might strive to reach fair and impartial factual findings\n\nand to make correct conclusions of law as to those issues, it is axiomatic that \"(n]o\n\nman is allowed to be a judge in his own cause,\" see Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal\n\n        snte impact of such off-the-record communia.tions to a jury can be sufficient to deprive\na defendant of his right to trial by an impartial jury. Parlcer v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 365\n( 1966) (bailitrs improper comment to jurors that petitioner was a \"wicked fellow\" required\nreversal).\n                                          Page 10ofl4\n\fCo., 556 U.S. 868, 876 (2009){recusal required when probability of actual bias is\n\ntoo high to be tolerable). Moreover, a judge's impartiality might reasonably be\n\nquestioned when deciding issues concerning not only his own conduct but that of a\n\nmember of his own court staff. Where a judge's impartiality might reasonably be\n\nquestioned, it is unnecessary for the movant to prove actual bias, or the thought\n\nprocesses of the judge. Gaa/, 332 S. W.3d at 459.\n\n      \"In detennining whether a judge's impartiality might be reasonably\n\nquestioned so as to require recusal, the proper inquiry is whether a reasonable\n\nmember of the public at large, knowing all the facts in the public domain\n\nconcerning the judge and the case, would have a reasonable doubt that the judge is\n\nactually impartial.\" Burkett v. State, 196 S.W.3d 892, 896 (Tex. App.- Texarkana\n\n2006, no pet.); Kemp v. State, 846 S.W.2d 289,305 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992); Rosas\n\nv. State, 16 S. W.3d 771, 774 (Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] 2002). Applicant\n\nsubmits that in the circumstances of Mr. Garza's case, regardless of the court's\n\nactual conduct or approach to this case, a rational observer would reasonably doubt\n\nwhether the court can be impartial.\n\n\n\n\n                                      Page 11 ofl4\n\f   Prior to qnv further proceedigs in the sase or catering any oniers in this\n   ease. the eourt is required either to reeuse itself or to request the presiding\n    judge oftbe admjoistndve judiclal district to assign a judge to hear this\n                                       motion.\n\n       Prior to conducting any further proceedings or entering any further orders in\n\nthis case, a judge against whom a motion to recuse is filed is required either to\n\nrecuse himself or request that the presiding judge of the administrative judicial\n\ndistrict assign a judge to hear the motion.

App.- El Paso 2003).\n\nThe filing of the motion does not, in itself, disqualify the judge, but merely\n\nrequires that another judge be assigned to detennine the merits of the motion.\n\nChastain v. State, 661 S.W.2d 791,795 {Tex. App.- Houston [14th Dist.] 1983,\n\npet. rej. ). This requirement is mandatory. /d.\n\n       The judge must take no further action on the case until a motion for recusal\n\nhas been decided. TEX. R. crv. P. 18a (t)(2)(A). In fact, any order entered by the\n\nchallenged judge after a proper recusal motion is filed, other than an order of\n\nrecusal or referra~ is void. Crawfordv. State, 807 S.W.2d 597,598 (Tex.

During the trial of Mr. Garza, did you have any\n\n 9   concerns for your personal safety?\n\n10        A.   Yes.\n\n11        Q.   And what caused those concerns?\n\n12        A.   The other jurors and, well, the judge and stuff like\n\n13   that, telling us that sometimes some of the jurors could be in\n\n14   danger.\n\n15        Q.   Okay.     Well, let's back up a moment.   When we talk\n\n16   about concerns for your personal safety, what were you concerned\n\n17   might happen?\n\n18        A.   I -- I just -- I just was afraid to be followed, or to\n\n19   be talked to, maybe to be threatened.\n\n20        Q.   Okay.     Did you have any concerns about the security\n\n21   arrangements in the courtroom?\n\n22        A.   No.     At first, but we --\n\n23        Q.   What caused those concerns?\n\n24        A.   Well, mostly that the jurors were, well, they talked\n\n25   about being their fears.    I really didn't think about it.\n\n\n\n                   JESSIE C.

Were there specific incidents during the trial that\n\n 5   caused your concerns to increase?\n\n 6           A.   Well, there was a time that there was somebody in the\n\n 7   audience that took pictures and then they took it towards the\n\n 8   jury.\n\n 9           Q.   Was there anything else?\n\n10           A.   Let me think.\n\n11           Q.   Was there any person who caused you to have a concern\n\n12   for your safety?\n\n13           A.   Like another juror maybe.    They did.    That -- well,\n\n14   the -- the bailiff, I guess she -- she did try to tell us that\n\n15   we would be safe because the judge had a gun on him, but that\n\n16   made me more nervous.\n\n17           Q.   Okay.    Well, let's talk about that.    When -- when,\n\n18   during the trial, did the bailiff talk to you about the comment\n\n19   you just made?\n\n20           A.   We were in the jury -- we were not in the jury room,\n\n21   we were in the room next to the -- where the jury meets.        I\n\n22   don't know what you call it.\n\n23           Q.   Let's first clarify.    There's a courtroom which is the\n\n24   room of the trial itself --\n\n25           A.   That's not where we were.\n\n\n\n                   JESSIE C.

That's the room.\n\n 6        Q.     And was it the latter room?\n\n 7        A.     Yes.\n\n 8        Q.     So that is the room that is private and away from the\n\n 9   public eyes?\n\n10        A.     Yes, correct.\n\n11        Q.     Okay.    And how was it that you came to have the\n\n12   conversation with the bailiff?\n\n13        A.     I think that I remember the other jurors were asking\n\n14   questions about that, and that they hoped that she was carrying\n\n15   a gun.    And she said no, she didn't, but not to worry because\n\n16   the judge did.\n\n17        Q.     Okay.\n\n18                       THE COURT:   I missed the last part.\n\n19                       THE WITNESS:   The judge did.\n\n20                       THE COURT:   That --\n\n21                       THE WITNESS:   She said --\n\n22                       THE COURT:   She said she didn't carry a gun, but\n\n23   what now?\n\n24                       THE WITNESS:   But not to worry.

Was there anybody else in the room at that time apart\n\n16   from the 12 jurors and the bailiff?\n\n17        A.      I don't remember.      It -- no, I don't remember.\n\n18        Q.      Do you remember, for example, Mr. Garza himself ever\n\n19   being brought back to that jury room?\n\n20        A.      No.\n\n21        Q.      So the Defendant was not present?\n\n22        A.      No.\n\n23        Q.      And what about defense counsel, the lawyers for the\n\n24   Defendant?\n\n25        A.

And why was it that she started talking to you about\n\n 6   the judge carrying a gun?    What started that conversation?\n\n 7        A.   Jurors that were asking her about if -- if we were\n\n 8   safe because of the gang activity.    They thought they saw the\n\n 9   gang member's family in the courtroom and then whoever took the\n\n10   picture, which -- that they were very concerned about that.\n\n11        Q.   Do you remember which of the jurors raised those\n\n12   issues?\n\n13        A.   No.     I know it was a male because the men were more --\n\n14        Q.   More nervous?\n\n15        A.   It seemed like it, yes.\n\n16        Q.   Okay.     When this conversation occurred was it during\n\n17   the trial itself?\n\n18        A.   Like on a break.\n\n19        Q.   Was the trial still continuing at the time that you\n\n20   had this conversation?\n\n21        A.   Yes.\n\n22        Q.   So was it before you arrived at a guilty verdict\n\n23   against Mr. Garza?\n\n24        A.   Yes.\n\n25        Q.

Just assured us that they would have somebody get us\n\n 2   to our cars, make sure that when it was already evening and\n\n 3   there were just like a few cars in the parking lot, and that we\n\n 4   would start parking in the back, and that's about it.\n\n 5        Q.    Do you remember anything else that the bailiff said?\n\n 6        A.    Not right now.   I can't.   Sorry.\n\n 7        Q.    Was the bailiff in question a man or a woman?\n\n 8        A.

What kind of things was she saying?\n\n22        A.    That she would be surprised if he bought us lunch\n\n23   because he was a cheapskate, and stuff like that.     And then --\n\n24        Q.

During your jury service, did you have any concerns\n\n 5   for your personal safety?\n\n 6           A.   The first couple of days only because of the extent of\n\n 7   the crime, and that it had to do with gang violence.        So just\n\n 8   that in itself, you know, had me worried.\n\n 9           Q.   What was the -- what were the other jurors saying\n\n10   about the security situation?\n\n11           A.   Nothing really was mentioned.   Pretty much the same at\n\n12   the beginning.      The getting to our cars and looking over your\n\n13   shoulder.    You just kind of had that doubt.\n\n14           Q.   What were you concerned might happen?\n\n15           A.   Just being followed.   I really didn't know.    You just\n\n16   you don't know.\n\n17           Q.   Were there any specific incidents during the trial\n\n18   that caused people to have a concern about their safety?\n\n19           A.   There was one incident that there was a reporter in\n\n20   the room.    I didn't see anything.\n\n21           Q.   What was supposed to have happened?\n\n22           A.   A picture was taken, or pictures were taken of the\n\n23   jury.\n\n24           Q.   And what was the reaction of the other jurors to that?\n\n25           A.   Well, they were concerned or worried.\n\n\n\n                   JESSIE C.

Was there anything else that caused you concern about\n\n 2   your personal safety?\n\n 3           A.   No.\n\n 4           Q.   What -- at some point, did members of the jury express\n\n 5   some kind of concern to the court staff about the security\n\n 6   situation?\n\n 7           A.   I believe so.\n\n 8           Q.   Did anything happen as a result of that?\n\n 9           A.   We were approached.   I want to say it was the middle,\n\n10   maybe the fifth, sixth day.\n\n11           Q.   The fifth or sixth day of trial?\n\n12           A.   Yes.    Uh-huh.\n\n13           Q.   And who was it that approached you?\n\n14           A.   The judge.\n\n15           Q.   Okay.    Where did the judge approach you?\n\n16           A.   In our holding room, or whatever it is called.\n\n17           Q.   Is that the jury room --\n\n18           A.   The jury room.\n\n19           Q.   -- that's behind the courtroom?\n\n20           A.   Yes.\n\n21           Q.   Which is normally a private room, it's not a public\n\n22   area?\n\n23           A.   Right.\n\n24           Q.   And did the judge explain why he had come to talk to\n\n25   you?\n\n\n\n                   JESSIE C.

Pretty much just to calm us down, or those who had\n\n 2   questions or concerns that safety, you know, we would be parking\n\n 3   in a different area.    By that point, I think they moved us\n\n 4   towards the back.\n\n 5        Q.   Let's talk for a moment about the parking.    Was there\n\n 6   a change in parking arrangements during the trial?\n\n 7        A.   Yes, I want to say it was around that same time\n\n 8   because of this certain concern.\n\n 9        Q.   And was it explained to you that it was concern about\n\n10   security that caused a change in the parking arrangements?\n\n11        A.   Not direct.    I mean, since that issue was the one\n\n12   being addressed, I assumed it was because of that.\n\n13        Q.   And when the judge came to talk to you was anybody\n\n14   else in the room with you?\n\n15        A.   Not that I can recall.    With me?\n\n16        Q.   With -- with the other jurors?\n\n17        A.   Well, the other jury just us.\n\n18        Q.   It was 12 jurors and the judge?\n\n19        A.   Right.\n\n20        Q.   And nobody else in the room?\n\n21        A.   No.\n\n22        Q.   And what else did the judge say to you?\n\n23        A.   Just that we would be the ones let out first to this\n\n24   new -- towards the back of the parking.\n\n25        Q.   Uh-huh.\n\n\n\n                   JESSIE C.

And they would wait until we were all gone and then\n\n 2   they would release the rest of them.\n\n 3        Q.     Did he say anything else?   Anything specific that you\n\n 4   remember?\n\n 5        A.     No.\n\n 6        Q.     Were there other remarks that he made you can't\n\n 7   remember?\n\n 8        A.     No.\n\n 9        Q.     Are you sure that there was nothing, no additional\n\n10   conversation?\n\n11        A.     At that point, no.   Not that I can remember.\n\n12        Q.     Do you recall him coming back to the jury room on any\n\n13   other occasion?\n\n14        A.     At the end of the trial.\n\n15        Q.     Okay.   Let me just back up.   So the conversation with\n\n16   the judge did happen with you during the trial was to do with\n\n17   security concerns?\n\n18        A.     Correct.\n\n19        Q.     And with nobody else present?\n\n20        A.     No.\n\n21        Q.     Okay.   Do you recall the bailiff in this case?\n\n22        A.     Yes.\n\n23        Q.

You and the other ones?\n\n15        A.   I believe so.\n\n16        Q.   That was back in 2007?\n\n17        A.   I think so.\n\n18        Q.   And nothing you're saying today about these concerns\n\n19   about safety, or these conversations, or the judge going to the\n\n20   jury room, none of that is in that affidavit, is it?\n\n21        A.   I don't think they were ever -- those questions were\n\n22   ever an issue, or they never were brought to my -- I was never\n\n23   asked those questions.\n\n24        Q.

In the last couple of years they closed it off, put\n\n14   that iron fence, and changed it, but back then it was right on\n\n15   there by the courtroom, right?\n\n16        A.     Right.\n\n17        Q.     And you said that in the middle of trial, they said\n\n18   you could start parking there?\n\n19        A.     Right.\n\n20        Q.

You never have\n\n 8   been on another jury in that court, right?\n\n 9          A.   No.\n\n10          Q.   So you don't know if it was a regular policy to let\n\n11   people park close by, particularly after hours so they wouldn't\n\n12   have to walk all the way across the street?\n\n13          A.   Right.   I'm not sure about that.\n\n14          Q.   In fact, you said a minute ago you assumed it was\n\n15   because of the security, but you didn't know why.\n\n16          A.   Why didn't I know?\n\n17          Q.   No.   But you didn't know why the judge had decided to\n\n18   let you park there, you are just guessing.\n\n19          A.   I just assumed because that's what was brought up,\n\n20   yes.\n\n21          Q.   Right.   Okay.   When the judge came to talk to you all\n\n22   in the jury room was it about scheduling of the case, working --\n\n23   whether or not you all could work late, or how long the trial\n\n24   would last and things like that?\n\n25          A.

I am Rose Marie Palacios, formerly known as Rose Marie Vera.\n     The change in my name is because Vera was my married name.\n     I am now divorced.\n\n2.   I was a juror at the 2005 death penalty trial of Humberto Garza.\n     I gave an affidavit concerning that trial in 2007, which I have\n     reviewed, and I confirm that the facts stated in that affidavit are\n     true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n\n3.   I have now been asked additional questions concerning Mr.\n     Garza's trial. In my previous affidavit, I explained that the bailiff\n     at the trial had told the jury members that the judge always\n     carried a gun. That bailiff was a little woman whose name was\n     \"Licha.\" She took us to and from the jury room and generally\n     escorted us. For example, when the judge bought us all lunch,\n     which happened on a couple of occasions, Licha took us to the\n     restaurant.\n\n4.   So far as I recall, Licha's comment about the judge always\n     carrying a gun was made when all of the jury was together in the\n     jury room behind the courtroom.\n\n5.   Some members of the jury were concerned about whether they\n     were safe, given that we were sitting on a case involving a gang.\n     There were jurors who were alarmed that there was a reporter\n     who took a photograph in the courtroom, and who were\n     concerned about people in the courtroom who might be gang\n     members.\n\n                                      1\n\f6.    Some jurors were worried about whether they were safe parking\n      in the public lot at the front of the courthouse. For example,\n      some, including me, were concerned that a relative or supporter\n      of Mr. Garza might write down our license plate numbers out in\n      that lot, and then follow us.\n\n7.    I was concerned about my personal safety. When we heard from\n      Licha that the judge carried a gun, I believed that to mean that\n      he must have past experiences of being threatened. Licha's\n      comment about the gun added to my fear.\n\n8.    Some members of the jury told Licha we were concerned about\n      the security situation, although I did not personally complain\n      about it.\n\n9.    There was a young man on the jury who sat next to me who\n      seemed so scared that after the sentencing he literally ran from\n      the room and let the door almost swing into my face.\n\n10.   In my previous affidavit, I mentioned that the judge had warned\n      us that sometimes gang members come after members of the\n      jury in a case. I was not previously asked to explain when that\n      warning was given. It was when the jury was in the jury room.\n      It was not in open court. So far as I recall, the attorneys\n      representing the State and the defense were not present at that\n      time, or at any time when the judge was with us in the jury\n      room.\n\n11.   A couple of times at least the judge spoke to us in the jury room\n      in response to a note we sent out. I can't remember precisely,\n      but I think we sent out at least a couple of notes. At times Licha\n      would respond if we had a question.\n\n12.   As stated in my previous affidavit, the judge reassured us that\n      the reporter who took a photograph in court was legitimate. My\n      recollection is that we were all back in that jury room when the\n      judge gave that reassurance.\n\n\n                                    2\n\f13.   I think that the court reporter, who was a young man, came into\n      the jury room a couple of times also, but I can't remember why\n      he was there.\n\n14.   When I signed my previous affidavit, I had forgotten that part\n      way through the trial we were allowed to start parking in the lot\n      behind the courthouse, which was used by the judges and court\n      staff. We were told by the deputies that the change was made\n      because jurors had expressed fear about the gang members. I\n      think that the change in parking arrangements only made me\n      more scared that something might happen to me.\n\n15.   The Judge made it very clear that the case would definitely\n      conclude by Easter. While I thought it was possible that we\n      might continue longer than that if it was necessary, I thought\n      that it was inappropriate to fix a finishing time in a case where a\n      man's life was at stake.\n\n16.   In the end, the trial was not that long - just a couple of weeks at\n      most - and the sentencing phase seemed very short.\n\n17.   The lead defense attorney looked professional, but he showed no\n      passion: it was as though his heart was not in it.\n\n18.   This was not an attorney who even seemed to be trying very\n      hard. He did not present much evidence. It made me sorry for\n      the young man on trial, to be represented by an attorney like\n      that.\n\n19.   When the lead defense counsel presented the character\n      witnesses at sentencing, he did not draw much out of them. I\n      could not even understand the point of his aunt's testimony. The\n      religious witnesses did not really have any impact on me at all.\n\n20.   The lead defense attorney argued that Mr. Garza did not intend\n      or expect the people who died in that house to be shot, but that\n      was just not credible - it was going too far to expect us to believe\n      that.\n\n\n                                    3\n\f21.   The lead defense attorney seemed to be thrown off course by the\n      prosecution objections when defense evidence was being\n      presented.\n\n22.   The junior defense attorney hardly spoke at all, and I was not\n      sure what he was doing there. He seemed almost like an\n      assistant or secretary.\n\n23.   The end of the sentencing was very emotional. I was actually\n      worried that people might pass out. There were people in the\n      jury room crying openly, even a younger man was just sobbing\n      like a baby. For some reason we had to wait there until the\n      judge came to talk to us. I can't even remember what he said\n      then, but he did not try to console the people who were so upset.\n\n24.   It is my belief that the issue of security during the trial played a\n      big role in my decision on the issue of deciding whether Mr.\n      Garza was a future danger to society. I had my own security\n      concerns very much in mind, and they were increased by Licha's\n      comment about the judge carrying a gun, and by what the judge\n      said about the gang following jurors.\n\nI have read this affidavit and swear upon pain and penalty of perjury\nthat it is true and correct.\n\n\n\nk~~)\nSigned\n\nSIGNED AND SWORN before me this \\        Oi~ay of~                 1   2014:\n\n\n\n\n                                     4\n                                           -\n\f               Exhibit J\nAffidavit of Rose Marie Vera, July 14, 2007\n\fSTATE OF TEXAS                       }\n                                     }\nCOUNTY OF HIDALGO                    }\n\n\n                         AFFIDAVIT OF ROSE MARIE VERA\n\n       My name is Rose Marie Vera. I am a resident of Hidalgo County, Texas. I am over\nthe age of eighteen and am competent to make this affidavit. All the facts stated here are\nwithin my personal knowledge.\n\n\n       1.     I was a juror in the 2005 capital murder trial of Humberto Garza.\n\n       2.     The death penalty was presented to us as if it was not our decision to make.\n              We just answered the questions given to us and then it was the judge who gave\n              death penalty. It is the judge's authority to give the death penalty.\n\n       3.     The way it was explained to the jury, and the way I understood it, is that it was\n              capital murder if you were involved in the crime any way.\n\n       4.     The security guards and deputies would occasionally make sure we got to our\n              car in the parking lot safely. Another night, when we went to the parking lot,\n              only one car remained. Mr. Garza's mother was sitting in her car, alone,\n              staring at us. I was worried she was writing down our license plate numbers.\n              Another night during the trial, I thought a truck was following me home from\n              the courthouse. I moved aside so it could pass me, but it didn't pass me. I\n              drove past my driveway and circled the block and the car stopped following\n              me.\n\n       5.     During the trial, the male jurors noticed that a couple of Garza's friends in the\n              audience were staring at us. There was a reporter in the audience who took a\n              picture of us. We were scared and we took our fears to the judge. The judge\n              assured us that the reporter was legitimate and trustworthy.\n\n       6.     The judge warned us that sometimes gang members come after the jury. What\n              made it scary for us is that you never know who is or is not a gang member in\n              the Valley. I thought Garza's gang could work anywhere, even inside the\n              courtroom.\n\n       7.     The judge carried a gun. He always had one. We knew this because the\n              bailiff told us that the judge carried one. Even the bailiff didn't carry a gun.\n\n       8.     After the death verdict was read, there was one man who was so scared that he\n              ran through the door to get out of the courtroom before everyone else. I\n              remember he hit let the door hit me on his way out, he was so scared.\n\n       9.     I was worried that Garza's lawyers would feel rushed because the judge said,\n              \"we are going to finish. There is no way we are going to come back after\n\f              Easter.\" I think he mentioned something about traveling or fishing with his\n              son. We finished on Holy Thursday.\n\n       10.    Garza's lawyer was professional, but not passionate. The lawyer just did not\n              have a lot to work with.\n\n       11.    I feel all of the defendants should be punished equally for their involvement in\n              the crime. If I had known Marcial Bocanegra, one of the shooters in the\n              murders, would receive a 35-year sentence for the actual shooting, I would\n              have voted for a life sentence for Humberto Garza instead of a death sentence.\n\n       12.    On June 29, 2007, Felicia Espinosa and Peter Walker, two student interns,\n              showed me affidavits from Garza's mother and aunt. This evidence was not\n              presented at trial. I did not know about Garza's sexual molestation. The\n              affidavits show a very dysfunctional family. I did not see that at trial.\n\n       13.    I do remember from trial that Garza's father was in prison and Garza had seen\n              a neighbor killed as a kid. Garza's mother testified that Garza was working at\n              the time. She thought he was doing well. She should have known he was\n              meeting with his old friends. The testimony of Ms. Garza's mother was just\n              not compelling.\n\n\n       I have read all 13 paragraphs of the above statement and swear, under the pain and\npenalty of perjury, that it is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

I am a resident of Hidalgo County, Texas. I am over\nthe age of eighteen and am competent to make this affidavit. All the facts stated here are\nwithin my personal knowledge.\n\n\n          1.   I was a juror in the in Humberto Garza's 2005 Capital Murder trial.\n\n          2.   As it was explained to us, the jurors were supposed to only answer the special\n               issue questions during the sentencing phase of the trial. It was the judge who\n               would ultimately decide Humberto Garza's sentence.\n\n          3.   Even after the special issue questions had been answered, I still did not know\n               what Humberto Garza's sentence would be. When the judge announced the\n               death sentence I took it really hard.\n\n          4.   If I had known Mr. Cantu, the other person accused of planning the robbery,\n               would be acquitted of charges relating to the murders, it would have\n               influenced me to vote for a life sentence rather than a death sentence.\n\n          5.   If I had known that Mr. Bocanegra, one of the shooters in the murders, would\n               receive a 35-year sentence for the murders, I would have voted for a life\n               sentence instead of a death sentence.\n\n          6.   Both Cantu's acquittal and Bocanegra's sentence would have influenced me\n               sufficiently to vote for a life sentence.\n\n          7.   During the sentencing phase, I remember looking at a list of Humberto\n               Garza's prior convictions. One conviction for breaking into a house had the\n               prefix \"aggravated\" before it. Arlett Lomeli, another juror, who had worked\n               as a probation officer, explained to me and the other jurors that \"aggravated\"\n               meant that someone had been at home in the house at the time of the break-in.\n\n          8.   I relied upon and considered Arlett's explanation in determining that\n               Humberto Garza would be a danger in the future. It definitely influenced me\n               in determining Humberto Garza's future dangerousness.\n\n          9.   During the trial, I feared for my safety as a juror. I was worried that I would\n               be the victim of retaliation by a gang for my involvement with the trial.\n\n          10. I was the \"holdout juror\" during the sentencing phase. Eventually, I was the\n              only one who did not want to give a death sentence. I argued that Humberto\n              could change, that he could be rehabilitated. Eventually I gave in and agreed\n              with eve~yone.lf I h(At\\ ~Y\\t>'Nn 4-\\'\\pt- .fh~ .'f\\JY~~s         d.ec.\\sion\n               rv>p.rc\\ln~ .m 0Uli</nle yva0 .fi~l, tWlcJ +f\\0..\\- 1+ wovtJ   ,ill\n               htie0'1atd~ rtt;\\t\\..\\- If\\ .fhe, )~e B)VIt\\~ adid+l10tnk:rttJ ''U\n               \\ wov\\d ~Le- been ,h~\\vtKt .}U voff, for a h.fe c.t,n-\\tnt:e\n               rntfuer     ~hct h (L       otCt.th fVt           (t.\n\f       I have read all 10 paragraphs of the above statement and swear, under the pain and\npenalty of perjury, that it is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

However, said hearing had to be postponed because\nhabeas counsel for Applicant filed a motion to recuse you from\nfurther involvement in this case; 139th District Court Judge J.R.\n“Bobby” Flores, who was assigned to hear said motion, held a hear-\ning on June 16, 2014; and Judge Flores then took the matter under\nadvisement and asked each side to submit a memorandum of law.\n\n     On July 3, 2014, Judge Flores signed an order denying Appli-\ncant’s motion to recuse you from further involvement in this case.\n\n     Earlier today, I received an E-mail copy of a letter to you\nin which Ms. Sheard indicated that she will be filing a petition\nfor writ of mandamus and a motion for a stay of proceedings in the\ntrial court later today or tomorrow at the latest.\n\n     Despite this indication of Ms. Sheard’s intentions, the State\nbelieves that you should still re-schedule the evidentiary hearing\nfor the soonest available date, for several reasons.\n\f     First of all, the Court of Criminal Appeals may or may not\ngrant Applicant’s request for a stay of proceedings, should he\nseek such a stay.\n\n     Secondly, given the fact that the hearing was previously set\nfor June 9, 2014, and only delayed because of the intervening\nrecusal proceedings, neither side should have any difficulty being\nready to go forward with said hearing.\n\n     Third, setting this matter for a hearing as soon as possible\nwill demonstrate that the you, as the trial judge, and the parties\nare attempting to move this case along toward ultimate disposition\nas expeditiously as possible, despite the delay caused by the in-\nability to take any action while the recusal issue was pending.\nClearly, demonstrating this point is a major concern given the\ndeadline to resolve any outstanding issues in this case imposed by\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals’ April 7, 2014 order in this case.\n\n     In order to ensure her awareness of this communication, I\nhave E-mailed a copy of this letter to Applicant’s habeas coun-\nsel Hilary Sheard at Ms. Sheard’s E-mail address of HilarySheard\n@Hotmail.com. I have also mailed a follow-up copy of said item\nto Ms. Sheard addressed to Hilary Sheard, Attorney at Law, 7301\nBurnet Road # 102-328, Austin, Texas 78757.\n\n      Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n\n\nRespectfully,\n\n\nTHEODORE C.

Code. Crim. Proc. Art. 11.071, filed simultaneously with his\n\nproposed Findings and Conclusior:ts, has previously stated, these proceedings were\n\nrendered unfair because of the Court's refusal to recuse itself, its refusal to admit\n\nthe reports of Applicant's expert witnesses and its denial of prompt and adequate\n\nfunding with which Applicant could develop his case. The fact-finding\n\nprocedures and rulings of the Convicting Court repeatedly impaired Applicant's\n\nability to adequately prepare and develop his case and to have his Grounds for\n\nRelief fairly considered in these TEX.

Since the fact-finding\n\nprocedures here were not adequate, and the Convicting Court has largely adopted\n\nthe State's Findings and Conclusions despite the fact that they are flawed in many\n\nways, this Court should reconsider its rulings.\n\n       This Court is asked to remc;:dy several fundamental errors in this case,\n\nnamely:\n\n        I)     The Convicting Court Should Have Recused Itself from Presiding\n               over These Art. 11.071 Proceedings; 1\n\n       1\n         As discussed in Applicant's Petition for Writ of Mandamus of July 9, 2014 at 32-38, of\nwhich a copy is attached and which is incorporated herein by reference, the avenues by which to\nraise for review the denial of a Motion to Recuse filed during Art. 11.071 proceedings are\nunclear. Without mandamus relief, such proceedings continue to be presided over, as they have\nhere, by a judge who should have been recused, and whose findings of fact and conclusions of\n\n                                         Page 3 of 51\n\f       2)      The Convicting Court Adopted the State's Proposed Findings of Fact\n               and Conclusions of Law and Recommendations almost in their\n               entirety and with virtually no amendment, thereby abdicating from its\n               proper role of\"neutral arbiter\" of the proceedings;\n\n       3)      The Convicting Court Denied Applicant an Adequate Opportunity to\n               Develop the Factual Basis for His Grounds for Relief Because of the\n               Court's Consistent Failure to Provide Timely and Adequate Funding\n               with Which Applicant Could Develop His Case.\n\n       4)      The Convicting Court Rendered the Proceedings Unfair by Refusing\n               to Admit the Reports ofExpert Witnesses Who Were Unable to\n               Testify Solely Because ofThe Timing Limitations Imposed upon this\n               Case.\n\n\n\n\nlaw must be revisited. The issue of recusal is urged again in these objections, which are being\nfiled simultaneously in the Court of Criminal Appeals, in order to ensure that Applicant's\nobjection to the conduct of these proceedings before a judge who should have been recused is\npreserved.\n\n                                          Page 4 of 51\n\fl)    The Convicting Court Should Have Recused Itself from Presiding over\n      These Art. 11.071 Proceedings.\n\n      On May 27,2014, Applica~t's Counsel filed a Motion for the Court to\n\nRecuse Itself, which was denied. The case was therefore assigned to the Hon. J.R.\n\n\"Bobby\" Flores of the 139lh District Court of Hidalgo County, for a hearing on the\n\nmotion to recuse. The hearing was conducted on June 16, 2014. On July 3, 2014,\n\nJudge Flores entered an order denying the motion to recuse. Judge Flores denied\n\nthe Motion to Recuse on July 3, 2014, without stating reasons for his decision, and\n\nApplicant subsequently, on July 8, 2014, sought leave to file a motion for writ of\n\nmandamus against Judge Flores, and commanding him to vacate his \"Order\n\nDenying Applicant's Motion to Recuse 370lh District Court Judge Noe Gonzalez\"\n\nand to enter an Order recusing the Court. The Court of Criminal Appeals denied\n\nleave to file the motion for writ of mandamus on July 18, 2014.\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals did not deny the Petition for Writ of\n\nMandamus on its merits, and Applicant continues to maintain that this Convicting\n\nCourt should have recused itself.\n\n      The grounds for the recusal motion were that the Court's impartiality might\n\nreasonably be questioned, and that it had personal knowledge of disputed\n\nevidentiary facts. The gist of the factual allegations were that the Court and its\n\nbailiff, Alicia \"Licha\" Salinas, engaged in prejudicial off-the-record\n\n                                     Page 5 of 51\n\fcommunications with the jury during the trial, in the jury room, and outside the\n\npresence of counsel or the defendant.\n\n       The subject matter of the communications included the concern of jury\n\nmembers about their personal safety in this gang-related case in which the jury\n\nwas required to answer the \"future dangerousness\" special issue, TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC. Art. 37.071. The actions of the Court and bailiff formed part of the subject\n\nmatter of Applicant's Grounds for Relief Four, Five and Six, which included\n\nallegations of'~ury misconduct, including the exposure of the jury to outside\n\ninfluences.\" Because of the Convicting Court's failure to provide funding\n\n(discussed further below) few of the jurors could be interviewed while the\n\nApplication was being prepared, and such interviews as were conducted were done\n\nby volunteer law students. Some subsequent investigation of the case revealed\n\nthat former jurors would indeed testify that both the Court and its bailiff engaged\n\nin off-the-record communications with the jury during the trial, in the jury room,\n\nand outside the presence of counsel or the defendant. Those communications\n\nconcerned, among other things, the Court stating that gangs may threaten and\n\nfollow jurors, and the bailiff telling the jurors, in response to their security\n\nconcerns, that the Court carried a gun.\n\n      Since both the Court and its bailiff's actions were an integral part of the\n\n\n                                      Page 6 of 51\n\fpleaded grounds for relief, the basis for the motion to recuse was that, in the\n\ncircumstances the Court's ability to adjudicate impartially a ground for relief\n\nconcerning its own and its bailiffs conduct \"might reasonably be questioned,\" and\n\nalso that \"the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\n\nconcerning the proceeding\", TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b (b)(l) and (3). Applicant objects\n\nboth to the Court's initial and continuing failure to recuse itself and to Judge\n\nFlores' subsequent denial of the Motion to Recuse, and urges that the question of\n\nrecusal be reconsidered and reviewed.\n\n      Moreover, the Court's handling of the underlying issues during the\n\npendency of the case and in the subsequent Findings and Conclusions further\n\ndemonstrates that the Court's impartiality might reasonably be questioned: In\n\naddition to refusing to recuse itself, Court refused even to be interviewed by\n\ncounsel concerning the allegations concerning outside influences on the jury and\n\nwould only answer a few questions from counsel about what it stated its general\n\ncourtroom practices to be. See Letters from undersigned counsel to the Court\n\ndated July 29, 2014, and August 3, 2014, filed on August 5, 2014. Thus, counsel\n\nwas prevented from discovering relevant facts, and could not, of course, call the\n                                   .\nCourt as a witness in the proceedings, because of the absence of prior discovery,\n\nand because ofTEX. R.

However, precisely because the Court's own\n\nintegrity and that of its staff member were being called into question, these\n\nfindings cannot be relied on as being impartially made. The jury-related claims\n\n\n       2\n         The Court also inserted some facts concerning the recusal proceedings, see, e.g., Court's\nFindings and Conclusions at 528. Applicant does not suggest that he agrees with the State\ndrafted material that was redacted, but emphasizes that the Court's concern to edit this discrete\npart of the State's voluminous pleading demonstrates why the Court's impartiality may properly\nbe questioned.\n\n                                          Page 8 of 51\n\fare discussed again at pp. 600-604, and the Court again redacted some of the\n\nState-drafted material. Paragraph 66 in the Court's version removes even the\n\nexplicit mention of material supporting both the recusal motion and Applicant's\n\n                                      3\njury-related grounds for relief.\n\n        Moreover, Applicant notes that Ms. Salinas was called by the State at the\n\nhearing on the motion to recuse and her testimony might properly have been\n\nconsidered by Judge Flores with regard to the recusal issue. However, Ms.\n\nSalinas was neither called by the State in person at the August 20 14 evidentiary\n\nhearing, nor was the transcript of her recusal hearing testimony offered into\n\nevidence by the State for the purpose of these underlying Art. 11.071 proceedings,\n\nwhich are governed by the \"Texas Rules of Criminal (sic) Evidence,\" see Art.\n\n11.071 § I 0. Applicant, on the other hand, had the transcripts of the recusal\n\nhearing testimony of jurors PalaciosNera and Guerrero correctly admitted into\n\n\n\n       3\n          Despite discussing the case law at length, neither the State nor the Court address the fact\nthat the communications with the jwy by the Court and bail iff in this case were ones which\nconstituted an \"outside influence\" on the jury, evidence as to which would be admissible under\nTEX. R. EVID. 606(b)( I). Nor is any attempt made to objectively analyze the prejudice to\nApplicant from those communications, as required by McQuarrie v. State, 380 S.W.Jd 145, 153-\n4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (reversing and remanding for further proceedings where outside\ninfluence had potentially had negative impact on jury's verdict). Colyer v. State, 428 S.W.Jd 117,\n129-30 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014)(affirming objective \"reasonable person\" test as measure of\nimpact of outside influence on hypothetical average jurors). Rather para. 71, p. 603, seems to\ndirectly contradict those authorities. The. findings and conclusions concerning this ground for\nrelief therefore cannot stand, and are objected to.\n\n                                           Page 9 of 51\n\fevidence. See Order on Motion to Deem Stipulated Evidence Formally Admitted\n\nof August 29, 2014. The Court in these habeas proceedings properly only had\n\nbefore it the affidavits, declarations and testimony of various former jurors,\n\nuncontradicted by anything to which Ms. Salinas testified. In this situation,\n\nwhatever factors underlay Judge Flores' decision, this Court- or rather, a different\n\njudge presiding over this matter subsequent to this Court's recusal- should have\n\narrived at its own estimation of the credibility of the former jurors rather than\n\nsimply adopting the supposed \"implicit\" findings contained in Judge Flores\n\nsimple statement that recusal was denied, and contained no findings of fact or\n\nconclusions of law. Indeed, Judge Flores' ruling may not have rested on\n\ncredibility at all, or on any other matter relevant to these habeas proceedings.\n\n      For these reasons, Applicant objects to the Court's Findings and\n\nConclusions, which must be revisited.\n\n\n2)    The Convicting Court Adopted the State's Proposed Findings of Fact\n      and Conclusions of Law and Recommendations Almost in Their\n      Entirety and With Virtually No Amendment, Thereby Abdicating from\n      its Proper Role of \"Neutral Arbiter\" of the Proceedings.\n\n      The Court adopted the State's proposed Findings and Conclusions virtually\n\nwithout emendation or correction except, as noted above, with regard to\n\ninformation concerning issues that Applicant contends should have led to the\n\n                                    Page 10 of 51\n\fCourt's recusal and to the grant of relief on his allegations concerning outside\n\ninfluences on the jury. Those parts of the State's proposed Findings and\n\nConclusions that the Court did adopt overlook copious evidence that undennines\n\nthe State's findings, and the many logical flaws in the State's submissions. A\n\nprime example is the finding concerning trial counsel's preparation of the case, at\n\np. 511:\n\n      523. This Court was not privy to infonnation concerning the steps\n      which not privy to infonnation concerning the steps which (sic-\n      repetition in original) Applicant's trial attorneys, Ralph R. Martinez\n      and Libra do \"Keno\" Vasquez took to investigate the underlying\n      criminal case, including any conversations they may have had with\n      Applicant, members of his family, or other potential witnesses, and\n      thus must rely on Mr. Martinez' and Mr. Vasquez' credible testimony\n      concerning this topic.\n\n      This \"finding\" overlooks the fact that in no case is a trial judge ever likely\n\nto be privy to the details of defense case preparation, and that if such knowledge\n\nwere a prerequisite to the grant of habeas relief, relief would probably never be\n\ngranted. Moreover, the Court overlooks the many affidavits from potential\n\nmitigation witnesses either overlooked by trial counsel or from whom trial counsel\n\nfailed to elicit pertinent facts, as well as court and other records concerning\n\nApplicant's background and that of his family. See, e.g., Applicant's Exhibits 4,\n\n5, 10-29, 37-50, 54-73, and Applicant's Hearing Exhibits 2-3. The only reason\n\n\n                                     Page 11 of 51\n\fthat the Convicting Court stated it \"must\" rely on counsel's testimony is, logically,\n\nthat is the testimony that supported the State's position. This ignores the wealth of\n\ninformation undermining the State-drafted Findings and Conclusions. In addition\n\nto the affidavits from family members, the information before the Court included\n\npsychological reports created during Applicant's adolescence, Applicant's\n\nExhibits 18 and 19, and the affidavit of Applicant's former TYC (Texas Youth\n\nCommission, now Texas Juvenile .Justice Department) caseworker, which\n\nindicated that Applicant had serious psychological problems and came from a\n\nfamily background that contributed to those problems. Applicant's Exhibit 70,\n\nAffidavit of Jeanette Brothers.\n\n      There is no indication that the Court actually considered the content of\n\nApplicant's mitigation evidence developed in these habeas proceedings as\n\nexposing trial counsel's flawed and cursory case preparation or the prejudice\n\ncaused to Applicant by trial counsel's performance: Although those four volumes\n\nof exhibits are listed and described at pp. 78-282, they are barely mentioned or\n\ndiscussed in the actual Findings and Conclusions. The Findings and Conclusions\n\nsigned by the Court do not therefore amount to the work of an impartial court\n\naffording a full and fair proceeding and fairly supporting its findings by reference\n\nto the actual record of the case. A post-conviction court must actually consider\n\n\n                                    Page 12 of 51\n\fmitigation evidence brought before it, and may not unreasonably discount the\n\nimpact of such evidence by assuming that because, for example, it might be in\n\nsome way imperfect, it should be disregarded entirely.

It\n\nalso defies the statutory   instructio~   that \"Every provision relating to the writ of\n\nhabeas corpus shall be most favorably construed in order to give effect to the\n\nremedy, and protect the rights of the person seeking relief under it.\" TEX. CODE.\n\nCRIM. PROC. Art. 11.04. Furthermore, it results in a denial of due course of law\n\nunder Art. I, s. 19 of the Texas Constitution, especially given that the Texas\n\nhabeas statute specifically mandates protection of\"the rights of the person seeking\n\n\n                                     . Page 14 of 51\n\frelief,\" and also denies due process under the United States Constitution.\n\n      Moreover, the relevant Findings and Conclusions signed by the Court do\n\nnot suggest that they have been the subject of careful scrutiny. In fact the content\n\nof its 63 7 pages is sometimes jumbled, with for example, a brief discussion of the\n\nlaw pertaining to Ground for Relief 14 inserted between a 16-page narrative\n\nconcerning the Court of Criminal Appeals' recent case law on TEX. R. Evm.\n\n606(b), at pp. 511-527, and discussion of Grounds for Relief 4-6 concerning\n\noutside influences on the jury, to which TEX. R. Evm. 606(b) is pertinent, at pp.\n\n528-530. Between pages 332 and 584 there are 252 pages of text discussing\n\nmultiple grounds for relief, unrelieved by a single subheading, and frequently\n\ndiscussing either the facts or the law without even explaining to the reader which\n\nground for relief is being dealt with.\n\n      Some examples of the many respects in which these largely State-drafted\n\nfindings did not merit the Court's signature are given below, specifically in regard\n\nto Applicant's allegation that counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the\n\nsentencing phase of his trial:\n\na)    Unwarranted Reliance on Trial Counsel's \"Credibility\".\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions rely throughout on the rote recitation of the\n\nword \"credible\" to describe trial counsel's testimony and on their attribution of\n\n\n                                     Page 15 of 51\n\fstrategic reasons for their actions and inactions. They fail, however, to address\n\nwhether counsel's explanation of their \"strategies\" and actions in fact\n\ndemonstrated \"reasonable professional assistance,\" given contradictory facts in the\n\nrecord.

Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689-690 (1984). Even if counsel\n\nwere \"credible\" in the sense that the Court believed them to be sincere, and even if\n\ntheir explanations, taken in isolation, sounded facially plausible, it is imperative\n\nthat any court reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance should come to a\n\ndetermination based on the totality of the facts of the individual case. /d.\n\n      As discussed further in the sections below, there are irreconcilable\n\ndiscrepancies between counsel's- particularly lead counsel's- assertions and\n\nactions at Applicant's trial, assertions during the evidentiary hearing and the other\n\nfacts and evidence available to counsel. For example, the Findings and\n\nConclusions state that trial counsel did not want to introduce psychological reports\n\ncreated during Applicant's adolescence because he wanted to avoid the jury\n\nhearing of\"Applicant's anti-social behavior and his gang involvement.\" Para. 407\n\nat 463-64; para. 26, 29 at 590-91; para. 48 at 596-97. However, lead counsel\n\nhimself at trial referred to Applicant as \"enforc[ing] things that maybe - that\n\ndefinitely were anti-social,\" 35 RR 9, and the jury heard copious evidence of\n\nApplicant's gang involvement during the guilt phase of trial, rendering counsel's\n\n\n                                    Page 16 of 51\n\fsubsequent explanation illogical.\n\nb)    Failure to Investigate and Present Evidence in Mitigation of Sentence.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions are contradictory in that they quote, for\n\nexample, the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Performance of\n\nCounsel in Death Penalty Cases (Rev. Ed. 2003 ), 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. 913 (2003)\n\nadvocating that counsel should retain an investigator, a mitigation specialist and\n\nother professional expertise and conduct a \"comprehensive pretrial investigation.\"\n\nFindings and Conclusions at pp. 402-03, but then endorse counsel's failure to\n\nretain a mitigation specialist, p. 461, and to simply conduct an investigation\n\nhimself in the short time available before the trial commenced. The Findings and\n\nConclusions in fact assert that trial counsel were fully prepared for Applicant's\n\ncapital murder trial and sentencing, para. 11, p. 586, despite counsel's preparation\n\nhaving consisted almost entirely of reading the State's file, speaking to Applicant\n\nand some family members, and performing legal research.

This ignores the copious mitigation evidence\n\nthat was in fact readily available and was presented in these Art. 11.071\n\n\n       4\n        Given that the Court sat on the committee that oversaw the creation of the State Bar of\nTexas Guidelines and Standards for Texas Capital Counsel, Texas Bar Joumal966-982\n(November 2006) which largely mirror the ABA guidelines, the Findings and Conclusions'\nendorsement of trial counsel's minimalist investigation as ''thorough\" provides additional ground\nto conclude that these statements are not the product of a neutral arbiter carefully scrutinizing a\nproposed order to ensure an accurate reflection of the record and application of legal principles.\n\n                                          Page 18 of 51\n\fproceedings. It again ignores the very case law and guidelines cited by the State\n\nitself in these Findings and Conclusions, which undennine the Findings and\n\nConclusions' description of counsel's investigation as \"thorough.\" Para.\n\n17 at p. 588.\n\n      The discrepancies between the assertions oflead counsel that Applicant's\n\nfamily had failed to tell him significant infonnation, or had given him different\n\ninfonnation from that contained in their later affidavits, p. 462, should have been\n\ngiven little weight: Lead counsel testified that he had asked Applicant's mother\n\nand family only indirectly about \"problems\" affecting applicant, and\n\nacknowledged that people are sometimes embarrassed or slow to disclose\n\nembarrassing things in their background, and that people with alcohol problems\n\nmay not necessarily recognize them as such. 2 EHRR 125-130. His cocounsel,\n\nKeno Vasquez recalled that counsel had met the family in a group, with counsel\n\nsometimes taking an individual family member aside. 3 EHRR 59.         He recalled\n\nlead counsel asking the family to talk about Applicant's childhood, but did not\n                                  .\nrecall any specific questioning about sexual abuse, substance abuse, or about\n\nApplicant being suicidal, neglected by his mother or exposed to trauma other than\n\nthe murder he had witnessed. 3 EHRR 28-29. While Keno Vasquez' affidavit of\n\nFebruary 8, 2013 indicates, \"Discussed everything with Defendant and family,\" in\n\n\n                                      Page 19 of 51\n\fresponse to a question about whether these and other specific topics were\n\ninvestigated, Affidavit at p. 15, his hearing testimony clarified that these specific\n                                    '\ntopics were in fact not discussed. Indeed, Mr. Vasquez, who made it clear in both\n\nhis hearing testimony and his affidavit that Mr. Martinez had had primary\n\nresponsibility for the case, stated that had he been lead counsel, he would have\n\nlooked closer into everything possible and explored issues such as Applicant being\n\nleft alone by his mother. 3 EHRR 30-32.\n\n      Lead counsel claimed during the hearing that Applicant's family had\n\nconveyed to him that Applicant h~d a \"nice, warm happy home,\" 2 EHRR 118,\n\nand that Applicant's mother, who counsel relied on as their primary source of\n\nmitigation information, was \"a great mom,\" 2 EHRR 242, who calmly handled the\n\npressure of having a son facing the death penalty. 2 EHRR 122. Those assertions\n\nare belied by Applicant's psychological reports and TYC records, by the multiple\n\naffidavits of family members and others describing Applicant's mother's poor\n\nparenting, and by counsel's own statement to the jury that Lydia Garza was a\n\n\"deficient\" and neglectful mother. 35 RR 8. Moreover, an ordained minister,\n\nSalomon A vii a, describes Applicant's mother as \"in a bad way\" and \"extremely\n\nstressed and fearful,\" prior to her son's trial. Exhibit 42 at 3-4. The Findings and\n\nConclusions then condone as reasonable counsel's unquestioning acceptance of\n\n\n                                        Page 20 of 51\n\fstatements made by Applicant's family members about his having had a good and\n\nhappy upbringing, and denial or silence concerning familial alcohol related\n\nproblems and Applicant's suicide attempts Para. 20-21, p. 589. That this reliance\n\nwas unreasonable is demonstrated by the copious evidence that would have been\n\navailable to counsel had they used a qualified and competent mitigation specialist\n\nto review records and thoroughly interview an appropriate range of witnesses\n\nextending beyond Applicant's immediate maternal family.\n\n      Applicant and his family may have failed to volunteer information, or not\n\nhave been perfectly accurate or co~sistent in what they told counsel, but that does\n\nnot automatically excuse counsel's failings. Counsel had no mental health\n\ntraining and no capital mitigation investigation experience and failed to hire\n\nanyone who could supplement those deficiencies. Preparation time was severely\n\nlimited, but counsel did not move for sufficient additional time, and did not have\n\nconducted the kind of repeated, in-depth one-on-one interviews, informed by\n\ntraining and prior records review, that might have been more fruitful. See, e.g.,\n\nState v.

The\n\njustification for these decisions is asserted as being that Applicant's mother had\n\ndenied exposing her son to negative influences, had claimed to be a good mother,\n\nwhich was what counsel wanted the jury to hear and that she had failed to mention\n\nthe shooting. This \"strategic\" explanation is undermined by the fact that counsel\n\nthemselves described Applicant's mother as \"deficient\" and as having both\n\n\"spoiled\" and \"neglected him because of her relationships,\" 35 RR 7-8, but failed\n\nto substantiate those assertions. Moreover, presenting Applicant as being the child\n\nof a good mother would logically fail to explain the negative and criminal\n\ntrajectory of his life as being the product of his upbringing rather than simply the\n\nresult of his own voluntary choices. As the affidavits provided in support of the\n\nwrit application demonstrate, Applicant's mother did consistently give priority to\n\nher husband and boyfriends rather than her child, failed to protect him, exposed\n\nhim to a wide range of criminal behavior and left him to his own devices for days\n\nor weeks at a time when he was as young as ten or eleven. See, e.g., Applicant's\n\nExhibits 4, 13 and 15, Affidavits of Lydia Garza at 6, Jennifer Cavazos at 4,\n\nJuanita Matthews at 2. The mere fact that, in conversation with counsel,\n\n\n                                    Page 22 of 51\n\fApplicant's mother might have had told them she had not left Applicant alone and\n\nwas a \"good mother,\" 2 EHRR 126, cannot excuse their failure to investigate\n\nfurther.\n\n       Moreover, counsel's claim that Applicant's mother did not tell them about\n\nthe shooting is not credible: She and the widow of the deceased were friends, 35\n\nRR 91, there was no reason Applicant's mother would have withheld the\n\ninformation, which she states that she did give to counsel- See Affidavit of Lydia\n\nGarza, Exhibit 4 at para. 81, and counsel elsewhere admitted that Applicant's\n\nmother had identified for them which witnesses they should call. 2 EHRR 274.\n\n       That the Findings and Conclusions's characterization of counsel's decision-\n\nmaking as based on valid strategy and a thorough mitigation investigation is\n\nillogical is further demonstrated by their treatment of Applicant's report of\n\nconcerns, as a teenager, of\"being pushed into sex.\" Para. 23, p. 590. The State's\n\nFindings and Conclusions claim that counsel was right not to present evidence on\n\nthat issue because of damaging facts contained in the same report in which that\n\nconcern was mentioned. See App~icant's Exhibit 18, Report of Dr. L.R. Fricke, p.\n\n2. This ignores two facts: (1) that counsel never even asked their own client to\n\nexplain what he had meant when he spoke of being \"pushed into sex,\" 2 EHRR\n\n132-34, and (2) that information in such reports can simply provide a basis for\n\n\n                                    Page 23 of 51\n\fother investigation without actually being introduced into evidence. Given that\n\ncounsel did not give Applicant's statement even enough thought to simply ask him\n\nwhat he had been talking about, which might have allowed them to discover, e.g.\n\nthe sexual abuse Applicant had experienced during his childhood- see, e.g.,\n\nApplicant's Exhibit 10, Affidavit of Edna Wilma Garza- their decision not to\n\npursue that investigative avenue, or present a more expansive mitigation case,\n\nshould not be dignified as the pursuit of a valid strategy.\n\nc)     Mental Health Evidence and Use of Experts.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions purport to validate trial counsel's failure to\n\nhave Applicant evaluated by a mental health professional because Applicant and\n\nhis family supposedly said he had no mental health issues and because counsel -\n\nwho had no training in the field of mental health - recognized no indication of\n\nsuch problems. Para. 18, 20, 25, 27, p. 588-91. The conclusions state that\n\ncounsel were reasonable to rely on their personal belief that Applicant was\n\nintelligent and their lack of perception that he had any problems. Para. 19, 27 p.\n\n588-89, 591. Psychological reports, which had been disclosed by the State, put\n\ncounsel on actual notice that Applicant's mental health had caused prior evaluators\n\nserious concern, not least because of the consequences of his witnessing the\n\nmurder of a family friend - a fact that counsel themselves identified as sufficiently\n\n\n                                    Page 24 of 51\n\fimportant to Applicant's development to have presented evidence of it at\n\nsentencing. See Applicant's Exhibit 18 (TYC Psychological Evaluations}; 35 RR\n\n80-95, Testimony of Blanca Cortez.\n\n      Paras. 27, 28, 47, p. 591, 596, of the Findings and Conclusions state that\n\ncounsel were reasonable to rely on what was said by Applicant and his family\n\nmembers, in deciding that Application had no mental health issues and that his\n\nmother was a \"great mother,\" and a constant and supportive presence in his life\n\nwith no alcohol-related issues, because they had no reason not to believe what\n\nthey were told. Again, this assertion is obviously illogical when Applicanfs\n\npsychological reports and TYC records are actually taken into account: they\n\ndemonstrate a troubled upbringing by a neglectful mother and recommendations\n\nthat Applicant receive further testing and treatment for problems that were already\n\nevident. See Applicant's Exhibit 18. Counsel had no reason to disbelieve the\n\nreports and records but did not investigate or follow up on this independent source\n\nmaterial in any way. Rather, counsel claimed to have accepted what they were\n\ntold by family members at face value even when what they were told was\n\ncontradicted by the earlier reports; prepared by mental health professionals, and by\n\nthe records compiled by TYC case workers.\n\n      In a notable contradiction of the conclusions in paras. 28 and 47, discussed\n\n\n                                   Page25 of 51\n\fabove, the conclusion at para. 52, p. 598, states that counsel \"properly relied\" on\n\ninformation received from Applicant and his family that Applicant's mother had\n\nnot wanted him, had tried to terminate her pregnancy with him, and had left him to\n\nfend for himself as a child, that there was severe substance abuse within the\n\nfamily, and that Applicant had attempted suicide by cutting his wrist, and had\n\nemotional problems and depression and abused drugs. There is no indication in\n\nthe trial record whatsoever reflecting that counsel relied on this information in any\n\nway, and the inherent contradictions among the various paragraphs of the State-\n\ndrafted Findings and Conclusions are irreconcilable.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions describe as a \"valid strategic decision\"\n\ncounsel's decision not to utilize any experts \"for fear that doing so would open the\n\ndoor to the prosecution's use of hypothetical situations that would emphasize\n\nApplicant's gang involvement and [admitted) extraneous offenses.\" Para. 19, 29,\n\np. 588, 591. The characterization as \"valid\" and \"strategic\" is absurd: Counsel\n\ndid not explain what the feared \"hypotheticals\" might consist of other than\n\nreferences to guns or gangs, 2 EHRR 167-68, factors ofwhich the jury would have\n\nbeen aware from the guilt phase evidence. Nor did they explain how the State\n\ncould further emphasize Applicant's gang involvement and extraneous offenses\n\nwhich formed a large part of the guilt phase evidence. This conclusion also\n\n\n                                   Page 26 of 51\n\fignores the fact that it is possible to use experts to assist in case preparation\n\nwithout necessarily choosing to call them to testify, and that such consultation has\n\nbeen deemed a sine qua non of capital representation: See Commentary to ABA\n\nGuidelines, The Defense Team and Supporting Services: Guideline 4.1 which\n\nstates that \"mental health experts are essential to defending capital cases ...\n\ncreating a competent and reliable mental health evaluation consistent with\n\nprevailing standards of practice is a time consuming and expensive process.\n\nCounsel must compile extensive historical data, as well as obtaining a thorough\n\nphysical and neurological examination.\"\n\n      Similarly, the Findings and Conclusions excuse as a valid strategy counsel's\n\nfailure to present evidence of Applicant's post-traumatic stress disorder and\n\ndepression because the reports from which counsel would have known of those\n\nmental disorders contained material about Applicant carrying a gun and having\n\nengaged in \"anti-social behavior.\" Paras. 25-26, 48, pp. 590-591, pp.596-97.\n\nLeaving aside that the reports themselves need not necessarily have been\n\nintroduced into evidence, the jury in fact became aware, at and before sentencing,\n\nof just such negative information about Applicant. What trial counsel failed to\n\nprovide to the jury was any coherent explanation of why Applicant had developed\n\nas he had. Failing to provide such an explanation because of what counsel\n\n\n                                     Page 27 of 51\n\fdeclared was a concern about introducing damaging material was an inadequate\n\nresponse to the State's case which was already laden with negative information. 5\n\nIndeed, Applicant's undesirable practice of carrying a gun could have been readily\n\nexplained had the jury been informed about his troubled background, not least that\n\nit was the father for whom Applicant \"yearned,\" according to trial counsel, 35 RR\n\n7, who had constantly exposed Applicant as a child to firearms, drug-trafficking\n\nand many other undesirable influences and activities. See Applicant's Exhibits 39,\n\n40, 41, 43 Affidavits of George Morales, Eddie Garza, David Garza, Raul Herrera,\n\nJr.\n\nd)     Gang Evidence and Applicant's Statements.\n\n       The Findings and Conclusions assert that \"Trial counsel also made a valid\n\nstregic (sic) decision to keep evidence of Applicant's alleged gang involvement\n\nand drug involvement out of Applicant's case.\" Para. 15, p. 587. This overlooks\n\nthe State's guilt phase presentation of comprehensive evidence of those very facts,\n\nsee, e.g., 30RR 154-65,31 RR 1-2,31 RR53-67,31 RR 70-91;31 RR209-17,31\n\nRR 200-25, 32 RR 1-20, and that defense counsel themselves established, during\n\n\n       5\n         As the Tennessee Supreme Court recently remarked, in a case reversed for ineffective\nassistance in a capital sentencing: \"Counsel held in their hands compelling evidence that [the\nApplicant) has a broken brain and a tragic past ... [t]he evidence from [Applicant's] mental health\nrecords held little to demean him further in the jury's eyes. However, it had great potential to\nexplain the invisible mental machinations that made him behave this way.\" Davidson v. State,\n_ S.W.3d _ , 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 918 * 42-44 (Tenn. Nov. 17, 2014).\n\n                                          Page 28 of 51\n\fthe guilt phase, that the Texas Syndicate is a gang, 31 RR 129, and that\n\nApplicant's imprisoned father, was a founder member of the Texas Syndicate, 31\n\nRR 213, which information counsel had the same witness repeat on cross-\n\nexamination, 32 RR 34. Counsel then referred to the same facts in his punishment\n\nphase opening. 3 5 RR 7.\n\n      The conclusion that counsel were reasonable to bring out that Applicant's\n\nfather was a negative influence but without actually investigating or \"emphasizing\n\nsaid matters,\" para. 30-31, 33 p. 592, for fear of bringing out information about the\n\nfather's previous convictions and gang activities, is another lapse in logic that\n\nshould not be upheld. Given that counsel did not know in advance what\n\nApplicant's father's criminal   reco~d   consisted of, or what was in his records, their\n\n\"know-nothing\" approach of not even investigating that background information\n\ncannot be deemed \"strategic.\" Moreover, as explained above, the jury was made\n\naware that Applicant's father was a founder of the Texas Syndicate gang, and the\n\nevidence of Applicant's own gang involvement was comprehensively presented to\n\nthe jury during the trial on the merits. Counsel otherwise described Applicant's\n\nfather to the jury as \" a violent man, extensive involvement,\" 35 RR 7, but\n\nwithout further explanation or evidence. Further explanation of the early\n\ninfluences at play in Applicant's life would have helped to demonstrate that\n\n\n                                     Page 29 of 51\n\fApplicant's criminal activities were attributable in large part to the absence of any\n\npositive role model or other support in his early life.\n\n      This Court should also reject the conclusion that trial counsel made a valid\n\nstrategic decision not to introduce evidence about Applicant's father because \"they\n\nhad not wanted any gang evidence in this case and had instead wanted to limit this\n\ncase to the statement which Applicant had made and to argue that there was not\n\nenough to prove the case,\" Para. 33, p. 592-93. Applicant's statement was the\n\nvery source of much ofthe evidence ofhis gang involvement. It had been\n\nintroduced at the guilt phase through the testimony of Detective Alvarez, 30 RR\n\n154- I 66, 31 RR 1-204; Agent Bukowski, 31 RR 205-26, 32 RR 20-53, and\n\nDetective Ochoa, 32 RR 54-185, and Applicant's admissions had presumably been\n\naccepted by the jury that had now convicted Applicant. It was not logically or\n\nlegally possible to ask the jwy to ignore that evidence for the purpose of\n\nsentencing. What was therefore relevant for trial counsel would have been to try\n\nto mitigate Applicant's sentence. Evidence of a dysfunctional family background\n\nand early exposure to criminal activities is precisely the kind of evidence that has\n\ntypically been viewed as mitigating, see, e.g., Sears v. Upton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149653\"><a href=\"/opinion/149653/sears-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, _ ,\n\n130 S.Ct. 3259,3264 (20IO)(counsel ineffective for failure to introduce evidence\n\nof abusive upbringing and that petitioner's brother introduced him to life of crime)\n\n\n                                    Page 30 of 51\n\fand trial counsel's failure to investigate and present such evidence cannot be\n\njustified by concerns that would only have been pertinent at the outset of the guilt\n\nphase.\n\n         The conclusion stating that it was sound strategy for counsel to rely at\n\nsentencing on a theory that the State had not proved its case beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt, para. 49, p. 597, is similarly insupportable. Indeed, this conclusion stands\n\nin marked contrast to that in para. 56, p. 599, which declares, \"The record of\n\nApplicant's case demonstrates that the jury had made a finding, based on the\n\nevidence, that Applicant was a major participant in the killings involved and had\n\nthus rejected any claim that Applicant's role had merely been peripheral.\" This\n\nCourt should have rejected these essentially contradictory conclusions.\n\ne)       Use of Applicant's Prison Records.\n\n         The conclusion that failing to challenge evidence of Applicant's\n\ndisciplinary violations in prison was a \"valid strategic decision\" because the\n\nevidence would have been admitted anyway, Para. 37, p. 593-94, cannot stand.\n\nLogically, a total absence of disciplinary violations suggests that an inmate is less\n\ndangerous than one who has only some violations. Therefore, in the context of a\n\ncapital sentencing, the goal shoulct have been to exclude all such evidence, rather\n\nthan to fail altogether to challenge it. At least one argument for exclusion existed:\n\n\n                                      Page 31 of 51\n\fthe Confrontation Clause. See Russeau v.

Moreover, contrary\n\nto counsel's other asserted justification for their failure to challenge the evidence,\n                                    .\nthe violations in question included violent acts, among them a stabbing. State's\n\nExhibits 430, 440A.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions also state that counsel were implementing a\n\n\"valid strategic decision\" in not presenting prison records including certificates\n\nthat presented Applicant in a positive light as humorous and well-liked and as\n\nhaving completed courses in prison, for fear of the State introducing \"unfavorable\n\naspects\" of Applicant's prison life'. Para. 39, p. 594. However, counsel had\n\nactually tried, but failed, to introduce the certificates through Applicant's mother,\n\n35 RR 135- 6, undermining their claim of\"strategy.\" Moreover, the purported\n\n\"strategy\" was groundless when the State had already introduced into evidence\n\nApplicant's prison disciplinary record and parole file, counsel could not identify\n\nany further negative incident that was not in the record, and could have introduced\n\nthe records under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. 2 EHRR\n\n172-78.\n\n\n                                     Page 32 of 51\n\f       Further examples of conclusions that should not be approved by this Court\n\nare at para. 38, p. 602, which asserts that counsel made a sound decision not to call\n\n\"too many, witnesses, including family witnesses, because they might mention\n\nother incidents or extraneous offenses involving Applicant. Trial counsel did not,\n\nhowever, point to any such actual incident or offense. Moreover, their belief that\n\nApplicant's statement \"absolved\" him of intent to commit the murders, Para. 38, p.\n\n594, was misplaced, given that the jury had just found him guilty of the murders.\n\nThat counsel \"felt\" that the jury would not give the death penalty even if it\n\nconvicted Applicant, Para. 38, p. 594, also does not represent a sound strategy: a\n\n\"feeling\" is simply not a strategy that justifies limiting the investigation and\n\nevidentiary presentation in a case involving a six-victim homicide.\n\n      The Findings and Conclusions assert that trial counsel made a valid\n\nstrategic decision to argue that Applicant had experienced a religious conversion.\n\nPara. 14, p. 587. There was, however, no evidence to support that argument. The\n\nhearing testimony oflead counsel that Applicant's religious devotion had changed\n\nover time is simply not borne out by the trial record or other evidence. While\n\ncounsel claimed that he presented evidence of a jailhouse conversion, that was\n\napparently based on such conversions being \"a generally accepted phenomena\n\n(sic) that I personally believe in, but occurs in the minds of the jurors, who might\n\n\n                                     Page 33 of 51\n\f3)    The Convicting Court denied Applicant an Adequate Opportunity to\n      Develop the Faetual Basis for His Grounds of Relief Because of the\n      Court's Consistent Failure to Provide Timely and Adequate Funding\n      with Which Applicant Could Develop His Case.\n\n      Successive counsel representing Applicant on both Direct Appeal and in\n\nthese Habeas Corpus proceedings attempted from the earliest days_ following\n\nApplicant's conviction and death sentence to obtain sufficient funding with which\n\nto conduct a proper investigation relevant to both stages of Applicant's trial, and\n\nconcerning events occurring during the trial itself. The need for such funding was\n\nparticularly acute because the original attorney retained on Applicant's behalf,\n\nCharles Banker, and the actual trial attorneys, Ralph R. Martinez and Librado\n\n\"Keno\" Vasquez, failed to utilize any investigators, mitigation specialists or other\n\nexpert assistance in the preparation of Applicant's trial.\n\n      Subsequently, Applicant's Direct Appeal counsel, F. Alan Futrell, filed a\n\nmotion for investigative funding, seeking to investigate issues of juror misconduct\n\nin connection with a potential Motion for New Trial, on April 5, 2005, less than\n\ntwo weeks after Applicant was sentenced to death. I CR 982-92. The Convicting\n\nCourt did not rule on that Motion.\n\n      In due course, both former habeas counsel, John E. Wright, and current\n\nhabeas corpus counsel, the undersigned, filed numerous applications for\n\ninvestigative funding and funding for expert services in order to develop\n\n                                     Page 35 of 51\n\fApplicant's claims, repeated requests for rulings on those applications and\n\nrepeated requests for payment for the individuals involved. Those Applications\n\nand requests to the trial court, most of which were made ex parte and under seal,\n\nare herein incorporated by reference and include those filed on: May 11, 2005;\n\nOctober 30, 2006; December 19, 2006; March 8, 2007; June 19, 2007; July 5,\n\n2007; July 12, 2007; August 2, 2007; September 24, 2007; March 5, 2008; April\n\n25, 2008; March 19, 2013; June 17, 2013; July 30, 2013; August 13, 2013;\n\nNovember 7, 2013; January 21, 2014; April 28, 2014; May 2, 2014; June 12,\n\n2014; July 22, 2014; July 24, 2014; August 12, 2014 and October 17, 2014.\n\n      This Court repeatedly failed to rule on the applications that were filed,\n\nnecessitating counsels' further written requests for rulings. Because former\n\ncounsel was located in Huntsville and the undersigned is located in Austin,\n\nhundreds of miles from Hidalgo County, visiting the Court to try to obtain rulings\n\nwas logistically extremely difficult for counsel. Because of the difficulty in\n\nobtaining funding from this Court, counsel for Applicant were obliged to resort to,\n\ne.g., using volunteer law students to assist in interviewing and investigation (see,\n\ne.g., Application for Funding of July 12, 2007, requesting expenses for student\n\ninvestigators - no ruling obtained), and to conducting investigation themselves,\n\nsee, e.g., Ex parte letter to the Court filed on September 18,2013. Even such\n\n\n                                    Page 36 of 51\n\ffunding as could be obtained had to be justified in great and time-consuming\n\ndetail, see, e.g., Ex parte letter to the Court filed on December 10, 2013.\n\n      At one point, the Court of Criminal Appeals ordered this Court on April 7,\n\n2014, to rule on all outstanding motions within thirty days. That was not done.\n\nUltimately, it was only after the hearing in this case, on September 9, 2014, that a\n\nformal order denying then-outstanding requests for expert and investigative\n\nassistance was entered. Another request for funding, filed on November 7, 2013,\n\nand including a request funding for the mitigation specialist/investigator working\n\non the case was only granted in part, despite counsel's detailed explanation of the\n\nwork that remained to be done. Undersigned counsel attempted to make\n\nincremental requests for funding, see, e.g., January 24, 2014, Unopposed Motion\n\nfor Extension of Time at 14, since her predecessor's request for larger amounts at\n\none time had not been ruled upon, let alone granted. Moreover, to try to ensure\n\nthat rulings were obtained, counsel visited the Court in person to discuss the\n\nrequested funding and present orders for signature, and sent repeated requests for\n\nrulings on outstanding items. In many instances, counsel repeatedly sought\n\nfunding, but was unable to secure a prompt ruling, when the Court ruled at all.\n\nWhen funding was granted it was generally in amounts smaller than those\n\nrequested, even where the need for the funding had been explained clearly and in\n\n\n                                    Page 37 of 51\n\f       Applicant's efforts to obtain sufficient funding for development of his case\n\nwere also discussed in Motions for Extensions of Time and Advisories filed on his\n\nbehalf in the Court of Criminal Appeals on December 28, 2012; June 21, 2013;\n\nand January 21, 2014.\n\n       Because of counsel's inability to obtain necessary funding, the work\n\nperformed on behalf of Applicant fell far short of the comprehensive investigation\n\nand development of his case mandated by caselaw, statute and relevant guidelines.\n\nSee January 24, 2014, Unopposed Motion for Extension of Time at 8-16.\n\nConsequently, Applicant was unable to adequately investigate and to present\n\nevidence that would assist in demonstrating entitlement to relief with regard to\n\nnon-record based claims in his Application, such as Grounds for Relief I and 3,\n\nconcerning trial counsel's ineffective assistance in preparing for and conducting\n\nthe sentencing phase of Applicant's trial; Grounds for Relief 4-6, concerning the\n\nhostile atmosphere in the courtroom and the outside influences brought to bear on\n\nApplicant's jury; Grounds for Relief 15-16, concerning trial counsel's failure to\n\ninvestigate and prepare for the hearing on a Motion to Suppress Applicant's oral\n\n\n       ~is convicting court failed entirely to pay the mitigation specialist who obtained the\noriginal mitigation affidavits filed with the Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus in 2007~ and\nsubsequently again declined to pay that mitigation specialist when requested to do so by the\nundersigned.\n\n                                          Page 38 of 51\n\fstatements, and Grounds for Relief 17-19, concerning trial counsel's failure to\n\ninvestigate and litigate the admissibility of the testimony of the State's witnesses\n\nconcerning gang activities.\n\n      As explained in, inter alia, .Applicant's January 21, 2014, Unopposed\n\nMotion for Extension of Time, and accompanying Ex Parte Advisory to the Court,\n\ncomprehensive investigation is necessary in capital cases, both at trial and in\n\nhabeas corpus proceedings, and the availability of adequate funding appears to\n\nhave a direct correlation with the likelihood of success in capital litigation.\n\nApplicant's ability to prevail in this litigation was compromised throughout by the\n\nCourt's refusal to provide such funding or to timely rule on motions for funding.\n\nApplicant therefore objects to this Court's entry of these Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions ofLaw and Recommendation.\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 39 of 51\n\f4)    The Convicting Court Rendered the Proceedings Unfair by Refusing to\n      Admit the Reports of Expert Witnesses Who Were Unable to Testify\n      Solely Because of The Timing Limitations Imposed upon this Case.\n\n      Of great importance to Applicant's sentencing case was the issue of the\n\nimpainnent to his mental functioning brought about by his mother's alcohol use\n\nwhile he was in utero. In order to·demonstrate the role that his mother's alcohol\n\nuse had played in his mental and personal development, Applicant unsuccessfully\n\nsought the admission into evidence of his Exhibits 34-36, the reports of experts\n\nneuropsychologist Paul D. Connor, Ph.D., psychiatrist Richard S. Adler, M.D.,\n\nand psychologist Natalie Novick Brown, Ph.D. Those experts had evaluated\n\nApplicant following the suggestion of Dr. Craig Henderson, a psychologist who\n\ninterviewed Applicant in 2007 and recommended a comprehensive\n\nneuropsychological evaluation. See Exhibit 22. Dr. Henderson had suggested that\n\nApplicant might have a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), given his\n\nmother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy and his previous psychological\n\ntest results. Dr. Richard Adler did subsequently diagnose such a disorder in\n\nApplicant, and the excluded reports explain the nature ofF ASDs, the factors that\n\nled to the diagnosis being made, and the impact of Applicant's FASD on his life\n\ntrajectory and choices.\n\n      Applicant filed the reports of Drs. Adler, Brown and Connor, along with\n\n\n                                   Page 40 of 51\n\fother exhibits, on May 27,2014. Although it had indicated that it would stipulate\n\nthe admissibility of numerous other exhibits, the State of Texas did not state until\n\nit wrote a letter to undersigned counsel dated July 23,2014, that it would not\n\nstipulate to the admissibility of these reports.\n\n      The State indicated in its letter that it was not agreeing to stipulate the\n\nexpert reports because it would have no opportunity to cross-examine the experts\n\nconcerning their qualifications, their methodology or the validity of their work,\n\nand because it believed that it had been given insufficient notice of the subject\n\nmatter of their reports.\n\n      The Court having set a date for an evidentiary hearing commencing August\n\n6, 2014, Applicant's counsel checked the available dates on which the experts in\n\nquestion could testify. None of them were available at all before the beginning of\n\nOctober 2014, and the earliest date on which one of them would be available was\n\nmid-December 2014. 2 EHRR 26. The three experts were unable to testify at the\n\nlive evidentiary hearing conducted on August 6-7, 20 14, solely because their prior\n\nprofessional commitments prevented them from testifying until after a deadline\n\nimposed by the Court of Criminal Appeals in an Order of July 18, 2014, requiring\n\nthat Applicant's case be completed and forwarded to that Court on or before\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 41 of 51\n\fAugust 31, 2014. 7 Thus, because of the incompatibility of that time constraint and\n\nthe availability of his experts, Applicant was unable to call them to testify.\n\n       The Court heard arguments concerning the admissibility of the reports\n\nduring the hearing conducted on August 6-7, 20 14, 2 EHRR 26 - 47, and\n\nsubsequently permitted the parties to file submissions concerning admissibility. 3\n\nEHRR 65-69. The State argued for the first time in its post-hearing briefing that:\n\n        (a)    The reports failed to demonstrate that the experts were relying on the\n               proper application of the methods involved in their field;\n\n       (b)     The reports failed \"to assert that the tests conducted were normed to\n               the population of either South Texas or to prison populations or death\n               row inmates in particular;\"\n\n       (c)     The reports were \"hearsay without exception,\" citing TEX. R. EVJD.\n               802-804.\n\n       The Court initially signed an Order on August 29, 2014, holding the reports\n\nto be inadmissible on two grounds: (1) that the third prong of the criteria for\n\nadmissibility set out in Nenno v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1491957\"><a href=\"/opinion/1491957/nenno-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1998) was not met, i.e., that Applicant had not established that the experts's\n\nreports properly relied upon and/or utilized the principles involved in their field\n\n\n        'Counsel for the parties were obliged to file two joint motions in the Court of Criminal\nAppeals, seeking additional time for the preparation of the proposed Findings and Conclusions\nwhich were ultimately filed on September 30, 2014. Then, in response to a letter request for\nadditional time filed by the Convicting Court on October 13, 2014, the Court of Criminal\nAppeals eventually extended the time for completion of the case to November 13,2014. The\nproposed findings of fact and conclusio~s of law and the record of these proceedings have not\nbeen filed in the Court of Criminal Appeals as oftoday's date, March 19, 2015.\n\n                                          Page 42 of 51\n\fand (2) that the State would not have an opportunity to cross-examine the experts.\n\n      Having reviewed Applicant's subsequently filed Motion to Reconsider\n\nAdmissibility of Expert Reports and supporting materials, the Court later\n\nacknowledged that the criteria for admissibility under TEX. R. EVID. 702 and\n\nNenno had been met, but still declined to admit the reports into evidence because\n\nto do so denied the State the opportunity for cross-examination of these three\n\nexperts. However, the State never suggested any actual flaw in these experts'\n\ncredential, nor any Jack of relevant expertise, or shortcoming in the reports that\n\nthey produced, other than querying whether the tests utilized in evaluating\n\nApplicant were normed on appropriate populations. That concern was\n\nsubsequently addressed in an affidavit from Dr. Connor, dated August 26, 2014,\n\nand was not referred to by the Court when it declined to admit the expert reports.\n\n      Thus, significant expert reports concerning potentially mitigating evidence\n\nin Applicant's case were excluded solely because of the Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals' deadline.\n\na)    Affidavit Testimony is Admissible in Habeas Corpus Proceedings\n\n      A trial court has discretion to admit affidavit evidence in TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC. Art. 11.071 proceedings. Under Art. 11.071 § 9(a) it may admit affidavits,\n\ndepositions and interrogatories, and has wide latitude as to the means of resolving\n\n\n                                    Page 43 of 51\n\fthe issues in the case. See, e.g., Ex parte Fierro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1657939\"><a href=\"/opinion/1657939/ex-parte-fierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1996)(considering evidence obtained by means ofLetters Rogatory).\n\nThus, the admission of these reports was well within the Court's discretionary\n\npowers, and the state failed to identify any substantive flaw in their reasoning or\n\nmethodology, the results arrived at or their creators' credentials.\n\nb)    Notice of Expert Testimony\n\n      The State claimed a lack of notice concerning the reports. However, the\n\ntopic of\"Fetal Alcohol   Syndrome~'   was specifically raised in the July 17, 2007,\n\nReport of Craig Henderson Ph.D., filed as Exhibit 22 to Applicant's 2007\n\nApplication for Writ of Habeas Corpus, and in which Dr. Henderson\n\nrecommended \"a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation,\" in light of\n\nApplicant's mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy and of Applicant's\n\nschool records and previous psychological testing. Familial alcohol and substance\n\nabuse are mentioned in Claim Three of the Application itself and in supporting\n\naffidavits, together with a statement from former counsel for Applicant John E\n\nWright at p. 70, that he had filed applications for funding for expert and\n\ninvestigative assistance. As Mr. Wright stated, such funding was needed in order\n\nto enable Applicant to fully present his claim.\n\n      The Henderson report similarly makes reference to depression/dysthymic\n\n\n                                      Page 44 of 51\n\fdisorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and trauma, all concepts developed in the\n\nthree more recent expert reports. Thus, the State had notice that those issues were\n\nlikely to be further developed in Applicant's case.\n\n      The State has been aware since late 2012 that undersigned counsel was\n\nworking on the case and was also aware that Applicant had sought extensions of\n\ntime in which to develop support for the Application. However, the State did not,\n\nat any point prior to the filing of the three expert reports on May 27,2014, seek to\n\ndiscover what expert testimony might be in preparation.\n\n      Under TEX. CODE CRJM. PROC. Art. 39.14(b) counsel may move for the\n\ncourt for an order for their adversary to disclose the name and address of potential\n\nexperts, not later than the 201h date before a trial begins. The State made no\n\nequivalent request in this case, and had notice prior to the hearing - exceeding by\n\nthree times the 20 day period set out in the rule- of these experts' names, their\n\ncontact details and the actual substance of their testimony.\n\n      Even at the time of the hearing, the State had apparently made no effort to\n\nenlist any expert assistance of its own to formulate a substantive critique of, or\n\nchallenge to, the three expert reports. It suggested absolutely no specific\n\nshortcoming in these experts' work other than their supposed failure to\n\ndemonstrate that they were relying on the proper application of the methods\n\n\n\n                                    Page 45 of 51\n\finvolved in their field when they assessed Applicant, and that their reports did not\n\nassert that the tests conducted were normed to specific populations - a supposed\n\nshortcoming whose relevance the State failed entirely to explain and which the\n\nCourt rejected when it ultimately ruled that the Nenno criteria were satisfied.\n\nThus, the State's protestation of lack of sufficient notice should be disregarded.\n\nc)    An Expert Opinion May be Supported by Hearsay Evidence\n\n      TEX. R. EVID. 703 states that, \"If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts\n\nin the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts\n\nor data need not be admissible in evidence.\" Thus, these expert reports were not\n\ninadmissible because they are based on information and data narrated or created\n\nby people other than the experts in question.\n\n      Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has affirmed that state hearsay\n\nrules must not be applied mechanistically to exclude reliable hearsay evidence so\n\nas to defeat the ends of justice. In Sears v. Upton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149653\"><a href=\"/opinion/149653/sears-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, _ , 130 S.Ct. at\n\n3263 n.6 (20 10), the applicant presented evidence, both lay and expert, concerning\n\nhead trauma, substance abuse and traumatic experiences, in addition to evidence\n\nthat Sears' brother introduced him to a life of crime. Although some of this\n\nevidence was hearsay, that did not undermine its probative value or admissibility\n\nin terms of sentencing.\n\n\n                                    Page 46 of 51\n\f        The evidence in Sears was rightfully not excluded by strict operation of\n\nhearsay provisions, but admitted, considered and given effect owing to its possible\n\nrelevance when assessing counsel's deficiency. ld. at 3262-3264. The Supreme\n\nCourt noted that the exclusion ofl)ighly relevant evidence on a critical issue in the\n\npunishment phase of trial may violate due process, regardless of state evidentiary\n\nrules. See also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284,302 (1973); Green v.\n\nGeorgia, 442 U.S. 95,97 (1979).            Similarly here, the critical question ofwhether\n\ncounsel provided effective representation at sentencing in this capital case\n\nmilitates in favor of admission, and proper consideration, of these reports. 8\n\n       This position is supported by state law also: TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art.\n\n11.04 states: \"Every provision relating to the writ of habeas corpus shall be most\n\nfavorably construed in order to give effect to the remedy, and protect the rights of\n\nthe person seeking relief under it.\" Likewise, in a capital sentencing, the court\n\nmay admit \"any matter that the court deems relevant to sentence,\" so long as that\n\nis consistent with the Constitutions of the United States and of the State ofTexas.\n\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 37.071§ 2(a)(l). The Court should therefore have\n\n\n\n       8\n        It should be noted that the three experts stated in their supplemental affidavits that the\nmaterials on which they relied are of exactly the type that are relied on by other professionals in\ntheir fields, demonstrating that they were following the same methods used by equivalent\nprofessionals and that reliance on e.g. affidavits from family members is considered reasonable\nin their respective fields.\n\n                                           Page 47 of 51\n\fexercised its discretion under Art. 11.071 § 9(a) to admit these reports.\n\n       Applicant had the burden of proof in this TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art.\n\n11.071 proceeding to prove not only that his attorney's performance was deficient,\n\nbut that he was thereby prejudiced. See Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n687-88 (1984). These exhibits were a component part ofhis mitigation case,\n\nreflecting what could and should have been presented at trial, and he now\n\ntherefore reargues the admission of the reports either on remand to the Convicting\n\nCourt or in the Court of Criminal Appeals. Applicant objects to the unfairness of\n\nthe Convicting Court's ruling, and particularly so because the Convicting Court\n\nentered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that do not recommend relief on\n\nApplicant's Ground for ReliefThtee, concerning the ineffective assistance of trial\n\ncounsel in preparing and presenting mitigating evidence.\n\n       While the progress of this case has been protracted, and it is now nearly ten\n\nyears since Applicant was sentenced to death in March 2005, it bears noting that\n\nhalf of that time period is attributable to the failure of the State of Texas to file an\n\nAnswer to his Application, which was timely filed on July 19, 2007. The State's\n\nAnswer was not filed until November 12, 2012, over five years later, and only\n\nafter the Court of Criminal Appeals, on August I, 2012, had ordered this Court to\n\nresolve remaining issues and conclude the case. Since taking over Applicant's\n\n\n\n                                      Page48 of 51\n\fcase upon the withdrawal of original State Habeas Counsel, undersigned counsel\n\nworked diligently to ensure proper factual development of the case, which\n\nincluded repeated attempts to obtain adequate funding for further investigation as\n\nwell as the assistance of experts, creating further delays.\n\n      The content of the reports themselves demonstrates that Mr. Garza suffers\n\nfrom a condition created while he was in his mother's womb that caused life-long\n\nadaptive impairments and susceptibility to other mental disorders, while the same\n\ncondition rendered him likely to be a low-risk inmate in the highly structured\n\nenvironment of prison, especially as he grows older. See, e.g., Exhibit 36, Report\n\nof Dr. Natalie Novick Brown at 32-43.\n\n      Applicant hereby renews his objection to the arbitrary exclusion of this\n\nsignificant evidence due to factors for which he should bear no responsibility.\n\nSuch a result does not comport with the due process requirement that the fact-\n\nfinding procedures be adequate for reaching reasonably correct results, Ex parte\n\nDavila, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2376580\"><a href=\"/opinion/2376580/ex-parte-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545 (Tex.

Crim. App.\n\n1978)(amendment of TEX. CONST. Art. V, § 5(c) provides this Court with power to\n\ngrant extraordinary writs in cases regarding criminal matters).\n\n       When a court of appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals have\n\nconcurrent, original jurisdiction over a petition for a writ of mandamus against the\n\njudge of a district or county court, the petition should be presented first to the\n\ncourt of appeals, unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. Padilla v.\n\nMcDaniel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1881148\"><a href=\"/opinion/1881148/padilla-v-mcdaniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 808 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). This petition is being\n\npresented to this Court in the first instance because this Court has sole jurisdiction\n\nover the appeal and review death penalty cases, of which this is one. See TEX.\n\nCODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 4.04, § 2; TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.071. Moreover,\n\nthe Court has previously ordered that the underlying case be expeditiously\n\nconcluded. See Order of April7, 2014 in Ex parte Humberto Garza, No. WR-\n\n78, 113-0 1. Were this petition to be filed in the Thirteenth Court of Appeals, there\n\nis the likelihood that the matter would still be brought to this Court in due course,\n\nconsuming additional time.\n\n\n                                         -xiii-\n\f                                ISSUE PRESENTED\n\n      The Respondent judge denied a motion to recuse the judge presiding over\n\nan application for writ of habeas corpus, filed in a capital case pursuant to TEX.\n\nCODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 11.071. The judge presiding over the application was the\n\nconvicting court at trial. The habeas application contained allegations of\"jury\n\nmisconduct, including the exposure of the jury to outside influences.\"\n\n      Further investigation of the case, conducted prior to a scheduled evidentiary\n\nhearing revealed that former jurors would testify that both Judge Gonzalez and his\n\nbailiff engaged in off-the-record communications with the jury during the trial, in\n\nthe jury room, and outside the presence of counsel or the defendant. The subject\n\nmatter of the communications included the concern ofjury members about their\n\npersonal safety in this gang-related case in which the jury was required to answer\n\nthe \"future dangerousness\" special issue, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 37.071.\n\n      The basis for the motion to recuse was that, in the circumstances of this case\n\nJudge Gonzalez's ability to adjudicate impartially a ground for relief concerning\n\nhis own and his bailiffs conduct \"might reasonably be questioned,\" and that \"the\n\njudge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the\n\nproceeding\", TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b (b)(l) and (3).\n\n      Humberto Garza had a right to a trial where the jury only made its decisions\n\n\n                                        -xiv-\n\fon the basis of evidence developed from the witness stand in a public courtroom,\n\nin his personal presence and with the full protection of his rights of confrontation,\n\nof cross-examination, and of counsel. Given the governing legal standards and the\n\nrecord as developed, Mr. Garza has a clear entitlement to relief from this Court,\n\nand would have no adequate remedy on appeal.\n\n         The intervention of this Court is therefore necessary in this extraordinary\n\nsituation in order to avert the continuation of a habeas proceeding that would\n\ninevitably have to be remanded later for renewed proceedings before a different\n\njudge.\n\n         An immediate stay ofthe proceedings in the trial court is also sought in\n\norder to permit this Court to resolve the issues presented in this petition, and for\n\nMr. Garza to be able to actually receive the reliefrequested, namely that the\n\nhabeas proceedings should only continue before a different judge.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -xv-\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Humberto Garza was convicted of capital murder in the 3 70th Judicial\n\nDistrict Court of Hidalgo County, Texas, Judge Noe Gonzalez presiding, and\n\nsentenced to death on March 24, 2005. Both the conviction and sentence of death\n\nwas affirmed on direct appeal. Garza v. State, No. AP-75,217 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\nApril 30, 2008)(not designated for publication).\n\n      A timely Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed on July 19, 2007.\n\nOn November 13, 2012, the Hidalgo County District Attorney's Office filed its\n\nAnswer to the Writ Application. Claims Five and Six of the Application alleged\n\nthat Mr. Garza's death sentence resulted from jury misconduct, including the\n\nexposure of the jury to outside influences. 2\n\n      An affidavit of juror Rose Marie Vera, submitted as Exhibit 26 to the\n\nApplication, indicated that the trial judge had \"warned us that sometimes gang\n\nmembers come after the jury,\" and that the bailiff had told the jury that the judge\n\nalways carried a gun. 3\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Claims Five and Six are virtually identical and were not argued separately\nwithin the Application.\n      3\n      Applicant was alleged to be a leader of the \"Tri-City Bombers\" gang, and\nwas charged with carrying out a six-victim robbery-homicide along with other\ngang members.\n\n                                          -1-\n\f       Ms. Vera's affidavit, which was obtained by volunteer law students, did not\n\nspecify whether the comment made by the judge about gangs was made in open\n\ncourt (it does not appear on the record), when that comment was made and in what\n\ncircumstances, what the bailiffs name was, what were the circumstances in which\n\nthe bailiff was talking to the jury about the judge, when the bailiff told the jury\n\nthat the judge carried a gun, or what the influence of the judge and bailiffs\n\ncomments had been on Ms. Vera's sentencing decision.\n\n       Mr. Garza's original habeas corpus counsel, John Wright, withdrew and\n\nundersigned counsel was appointed in his place on November 9, 2012.\n\nUndersigned counsel subsequently obtained funding to further investigate and\n\ndevelop the grounds for relief pleaded in Mr. Garza's habeas application.\n\n      On April 7, 2014, this Court entered an order directing the trial court to rule\n\non any outstanding motions in the case within 30 days and to resolve any\n\noutstanding issues within 90 days. On May 14, 2014, the trial court set a hearing\n\ndate of June 9, 2014. In the meantime, investigation on behalfofMr. Garza\n\ncontinued. 4\n\n\n\n      4\n        As stated at the recusal hearing on June 16, 2014, it has only been possible\nto interview some, but not all, of the trial jurors in this case because of the\ndifficulty that undersigned and former counsel experienced in obtaining necessary\ninvestigative funding.\n                                          -2-\n\f      Further information and clarification about the communications between the\n\njury, Judge Gonzalez and his bailiffwas obtained during an interview of juror\n\nRose Marie Vera, now known as Rose Marie Palacios. Ms. Palacios signed a new\n\naffidavit stating that both Judge Gonzalez and his bailiff had engaged in\n\ncommunications with the jury in the jury room, and outside the presence of\n\ncounsel, during which the statements mentioned in her earlier affidavit were made.\n\n      A motion asking Judge Gonzalez to recuse himself was therefore filed on\n\nMay 27, 2014.5 Judge Gonzalez declined to recuse himself, and referred this\n\nmatter to the Regional Presiding Judge, who assigned the case to the Hon J.R.\n\n\"Bobby\" Flores of the 139111 District Court ofHidalgo County.\n\n      A hearing was conducted on June 16, 2014. 6 Three witnesses testified:\n\nformer jurors Rose Marie Palacios and Melissa Guerrero were called on behalf of\n\nMr. Garza; the trial bailiff, Alicia \"Licha\" Salinas, was called by the State. Judge\n\nFlores also took judicial notice of the contents of the court file pertaining to the\n\ncase, which included affidavits from Rose Marie Palacios dated May 19, 2014 and,\n\nunder her former name, Rose Marie Vera, dated July 14,2007, and from Melissa\n\n\n\n\n      5\n          Ms. Vera reverted to her maiden name ofPalacios after a divorce.\n      6\n          A transcript of the testimony from the hearing is attached as Exhibit H.\n                                           -3-\n\fGuerrero, dated July 14, 2007. 7\n\nRose Marie Palacios (formerly Vera).\n\n      Ms. Palacios testified that she had been a juror at Mr. Garza's 2005 trial.\n\nRHR at 4. 8 She had had concerns for her personal safety during the trial, which\n\nwere caused by the other jurors, and by the judge saying that jurors could be in\n\ndanger, as well as by the evidence itself. RHR. at 4-5. She had thought she might\n\nbe followed or threatened. RHR. at 4. Her concerns were increased by an incident\n\nwhere someone took photographs of the jury in court during the trial. RHR at 5.\n\nThe jurors had been asking \"if we were safe because of the gang activity.\" They\n\nwere concerned about gang members' families being in the courtroom, and about\n\nthe taking of the photograph. RHR at 8. Ms. Palacios acknowledged that the\n\nfamily members in the courtroom could have been family members of the victims\n\nin the case, which involved gangs on both sides. RHR at 18.\n\n      The bailiff, who was a woman named Licha, told the jury members that they\n\nwould be safe because the judge carried a gun, but that made Mrs. Palacios more\n\nnervous. RHR at 5, 9. Licha's comments were made in the jury room, not the\n\n\n      7\n          These exhibits are attached as Exhibits I-K.\n      8\n        Page references are to the transcript of the testimony prepared and provided\nto the parties on June 17,2014, which is attached as Exhibit H. It is referred to\nhere as \"RHR\" (Recusal Hearing Record).\n                                           -4-\n\fcourtroom, and with all the jurors present. RHR at 5, 7. Some other jurors had\n\ntold Licha they hoped she was carrying a gun: \"And she said no, she didn't, but\n\nnot to worry because the judge did.\" RHR at 6. Licha said that she never carried a\n\ngun, RHR at 17. This conversation occurred during the trial, and before the jury\n\narrived at a guilty verdict. RHR at 8. Licha also said \"that she would be surprised\n\nif [the judge] bought us lunch because he was a cheapskate[.]\" RHR at 9.\n\n      The judge came into the jury room to talk to the jurors about their safety\n\nconcerns. RHR at 10. Ms. Palacios believed that the judge came into the jury\n\nroom in response to a note from another member of the jury. RHR at I 0. That visit\n\nby the Judge to the jury room was while the trial was still going on, and before the\n\nguilty verdict. RHR at I 0. All twelve members of the jury were there, but she\n\ncould not remember if the bailiff was there also. RHR at II. The court reporter\n\nmay also have been present, but not the defendant or his attorneys, RHR at II. 9\n\nMs. Palacios did not remember Mr. Garza or any of the attorneys ever being\n\npresent in the jury room. RHR at 7-8. The judge had mentioned scheduling when\n\nhe talked to the jurors. RHR at 15.\n\n      Ms. Palacios testified that the judge said \"That he understood our fears, but\n\n\n      9\n      The Reporter's Record filed by the court reporter at trial, the late Francisco\nB. Moreno, does not include any transcript of proceedings conducted in the jury\nroom.\n                                         -5-\n\f... he was going to provide us security and that we would be fine ... That the gangs,\n\nsometimes they threaten the jurors and sometimes they -they may follow you.\"\n\nRHR at II. The judge did not give any specific examples of gangs disrupting\n\ntrials or threatening people. RHR at I6-I 7. The judge said that the person who\n\nhad taken a photograph in court was \"legitimate.\" RHR at II. He said that it was a\n\ncourthouse policy not to permit pictures ofjurors to be taken. RHR at I3-I4.\n\n       Mrs. Palacios thought that the judge may also have come into the jury room\n\nanother time, in response to a note. RHR at I2. Later in the trial, the jury had been\n\npermitted to park on the west side of the courthouse, closer to the courtroom, and\n\nthe deputies had escorted the jurors. RHR at I4-15.\n\n      Mrs. Palacios had been interviewed about the case seven years ago by\n\npeople who said they were students from Austin, and she gave them an affidavit at\n\nthe time. RHR at I5-I6. Mrs. Palacios was asked additional questions when she\n\nwas interviewed a second time. RHR at I9. In her earlier affidavit, Mrs. Palacios\n\nsaid she thought she saw Mr. Garza's mother sitting in a car out in the parking lot,\n\nand the jury had been told by court staff that \"they'd take care of the situation.\"\n\nRHR at 16.\n\n      Ms. Palacios had not named the bailiff in her first affidavit, but she may not\n\nhave been asked for a name at that time. RHR at 20-21.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fMelissa Guerrero\n\n      Ms. Guerrero testified that she was a juror at Mr. Garza's 2005 trial. RHR at\n\n22-23. She had had concerns for her personal safety because of the crime in\n\nquestion, which concerned gang violence, and was specifically concerned about\n\nbeing followed. RHR at 23. There was an incident during the trial when a\n\nreporter took a picture, which she herself did not see, but which worried other\n\njurors. RHR at 23. She believed that jurors had expressed concern to court staff\n\nabout the security situation. RHR at 24.\n\n      The judge had approached the jury in the jury room behind the courtroom\n\non the fifth or sixth day of trial. RHR at 24. He said that he had come to calm the\n\njury down, and that they would be parking in a different area from that point. RHR\n\nat 25. She assumed that the change in parking arrangements was because of\n\nsecurity concerns. RHR at 25. When the judge spoke to the jurors, there was\n\nnobody else in the room, other than the twelve of them. RHR at 25. The jurors\n\nwere told that they would be allowed to leave for their parking area before others\n\nwere released from court. RHR at 25-26.\n\n      Ms. Guerrero did not know if it was a regular policy to let people park close\n\nby the courthouse after hours so that they did not have to walk across the street.\n\nRHR at 29. She had assumed the change in parking arrangements was because of\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fthe security situation. RHR at 30.\n\n      Ms. Guerrero could not remember any other remarks made by the judge, but\n\nthe conversation that did occur concerned security matters. RHR at 26. The\n\nconversation was not about scheduling. RHR at 30. The judge also came to the\n\njury room after the trial to thank the jury and to provide information about\n\ncounseling. RHR at 31. Ms. Guerrero remembered that the bailiff in the case was\n\na woman, but did not recall any conversation with her about security\n\narrangements. RHR at 26-27.\n\n      Mrs Guerrero had signed an affidavit in 2007 in which she said nothing\n\nabout the judge going to the jury room. However, she had not been questioned\n\nabout that at the time. RHR at 27-28. She had been visited in the past few days by\n\ndefense counsel, together with another woman. RHR at 28. On cross-examination,\n\nMs. Guerrero said that defense counsel had not suggested what Ms. Guerrero\n\nshould say, other than telling her to be honest. RHR at 31.\n\n      She had been interviewed by two people in 2007, one of whom may have\n\nbeen a lawyer, or they may have been law students. RHR at 32. The questions\n\nasked more recently were in greater depth than on the previous occasion. RHR at\n\n32. She may not have given further information in 2007 about her security\n\nconcerns because she was not asked at the time. RHR at 32.

She did not carry a gun when she was acting as a bailiff in\n\n2005. RHR at 36. She did not remember telling anybody on the jury that Judge\n\nGonzalez carried a gun, and does not think she would have said that.

RHR. at 37-38.\n\n      Ms. Salinas did not specifically remember any jurors expressing security\n\nconcerns during Mr. Garza's trial. RHR. at 38. If the jury had a note, they would\n\nhand it to her to give to the judge so that the judge and lawyers could discuss the\n\nresponse. RHR. at 38-39. Usually the judge would have a note handed back to the\n\njury, rather than bringing them back into the courtroom. RHR at 39.\n\n      While working at the 3 70th District Court, Ms. Salinas has performed the\n\nfunctions of bailiff, interpreter and court coordinator. RHR at 39. She had been\n\napproved for promotion to court coordinator, and has been in that position since\n\nabout February 2011. RHR at 39-40. The judge is her boss and writes her\n\nperformance reviews. RHR at 40. He would have some influence over whether\n\nshe would get an increase in salary. RHR at 40. She has worked for him for\n\ntwelve years. RHR. at 40. Her county job comes with benefits and a retirement\n\nplan, and is a valuable thing to have. RHR at 40. She is a valued member of the\n\njudge's staff and likes working where she does. RHR at 41.\n\n      Ms. Salinas' office is right next to the judge's chamber, so she is physically\n\nvery close to him - he can just call out and she is at his side in a minute. RHR at\n\n41. Her name appears on court transcripts, together with that of the judge and the\n\nattorneys.

RHR at 41-42. She knows\n\nthat it would be undignified to gossip about cases. RHR at 42. She has had\n\ntraining at officially-run court bailiff workshops. RHR at 42. She has been taught\n\nwhat she should and should not do, with regard to not exposing the jury to\n\nanything that might cause them to be prejudiced for one side or the other, other\n\nthan by the evidence. RHR at 42-43. She understands that she should not talk\n\nabout a case with the jury except in the presence of the judge and with his\n\npermission, that there are rules about the judge not communicating with the jury\n\nexcept in writing, and that breaking some of these rules can result in a fine or\n\nconfinement in jail, or in a case reversal or a mistrial. RHR at 43. She knows that\n\nif she broke those rules she could lose her job or be demoted. RHR at 44.\n\n      She knows that the judge might lose his reputation if he allowed such\n\nbreaches of the rules, and that such breaches could cause negative comment in the\n\nmedia, or reversal of a case which would also cause the judge a loss of reputation,\n\nRHRat44.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f                       ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nI.

(emphasis added).\n\n      In Gaal, this Court confirmed that there is no need for a party moving for\n\nrecusal on the basis of lack of impartiality to demonstrate what is going through a\n\ntrial judge's mind, or to prove actual bias: \"Under [Rule 18b (b)(I)], showing that\n\nthe trial judge's impartiality 'might reasonably be questioned' suffices.\" /d. at\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f459.'2 In contrast, TEX.

The Reasons Why Judge Gonzalez's Impartiality Might\n                    Reasonably Be Qyestioned in this Case.\n\n      A reasonable member of the public would reasonably doubt Judge\n\nGonzalez's ability to be impartial in adjudicating the claims concerning jury\n\nmisconduct or, perhaps more accurately here, the impact of\"outside influences\"\n\nimproperly brought to bear on the jury . 13 In the hearing in Respondent's court,\n\njurors Palacios and Guerra testified that Judge Gonzalez had private discussions\n\nwith sitting jurors, outside the presence of the defendant, the court reporter or\n\ncounsel for either party. The discussions concerned the jury's personal safety, in\n\nthe context of a case whose subject matter concerned a six-victim homicide\n\nresulting from the activities of members of a local street gang, of which Mr. Garza\n\nwas alleged to be a Captain. Moreover, this was a death penalty case in which the\n\nquestion whether Mr. Garza \"would commit criminal acts of violence that would\n\nconstitute a continuing threat to society,\" was one the jury would have to answer\n\nat sentencing. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 3 7.071 § 2 {b)(2).\n\n      In addition to making findings of fact concerning his own conduct in the\n\njury room, if he continues to preside over this case, Judge Gonzalez would be\n\n\n      13\n       See TEX. R. EVID. 606(b): \"[A] juror may testify ... whether any outside\ninfluence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror[.]\"\n                                          -16-\n\frequired to make findings of fact concerning the conduct of his long-time\n\nemployee, \"Licha\" Salinas, who was his bailiff at the time. According to the\n\ntestifying jurors, Ms. Salinas had conversed with jury members who had expressed\n\nconcern for their safety telling them that the judge carried a gun. As explained\n\nbelow, the conduct ofbothjudge and bailiff breached court rules and\n\nconstitutional safeguards and was improper. These facts would create the\n\nperception in a reasonable person that Judge Gonzalez could not be expected to\n\nadjudicate his own or his bailiffs behavior impartially.\n\n             3.     Any private communication or contact by a trial judge\n                    with a juror during a trial is improper.\n\n       \"Any ex parte meeting or communication between the judge and ... jury is\n\npregnant with possibilities for error,\" United States v.

Art. 36.22 and 36.27 concerning\n\ncontacts and communications with a jury during trial, it may be fairly said that the\n\njudge's personal knowledge seems to have been wrongfully obtained. Thus, to\n\nhave that same judge rely on his personal recollection of those events would not\n\nbe an adequate method \"for reaching reasonably correct results.\" Davila, 530\n\nS.W.2d at 545. A finding favorable to Mr. Garza's position here would require\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fJudge Gonzalez- explicitly or implicitly- to admit negative facts about his own\n\nconduct and possibly that of his longtime bailiff also. A finding adverse to Mr.\n\nGarza could also result in factual determinations which cannot adequately be\n\nreviewed later, since the court's contacts with the jury were in camera, ex parte\n\nand unrecorded.\n\nIII.   NO ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW\n\n       Mr. Garza has no adequate remedy at law. Unless mandamus relief is\n\ngranted, the proceedings will continue to be presided over by a judge who should\n\nhave been recused, and whose findings of fact and conclusions of law may have to\n\nbe revisited by a subsequent judge.\n\n             I.     Review of Denial ofRecusal in the Context of Habeas Corpus\n                    Proceedings\n\n       There is no comparable criminal rule or statute to TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b,\n\nwhich provides the various statutory bases for recusal. However, this Court has\n\nheld that the civil rules on recusal apply, absent legislative intent indicating\n\notherwise. Gaal v.

P. 18b therefore certainly\n\napplies to Mr. Garza's case.\n\n       This Court has also specifically held that TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(a), which\n\n                                         -32-\n\fstates the procedures governing recusal motions in the trial courts, applies to\n\nhabeas proceedings \"before the trial court.\" Ex parte Sinegar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2284121\"><a href=\"/opinion/2284121/ex-parte-sinegar/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n580 (Tex.

P. 18a G)(1)(A), provides\n\nthat: \"[a]n order denying a motion to recuse may be reviewed only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion on appeal from the fmaljudgment,\" (emphasis added) and the specific\n\napplication of that part of Rule 18a is not discussed in Sinegar.\n\n      Sinegar concerned a situation where the judge of a convicting court had\n\ndeclined to address a motion to recuse filed in the course of a habeas corpus\n\nproceeding in which the convicting court had already issued findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law recommending that relief be denied. In Sinegar, this Court was\n\npresented with both the question of the trial court's handling of the recusal issue\n\nand that court's findings of fact and conclusions of law on the merits. However, in\n\nthat case, unlike this, the trial court had not actually acted on the recusal motion,\n\nand the Court apparently felt it necessary to have the recusal issue addressed prior\n\nto deciding whether the findings and conclusions could even be reviewed, given\n\nthat Sinegar's recusal efforts were underway prior to the issuance of the trial\n\ncourt's findings and recommendations.

Flack, 728\n\nS.W.2d at 792, noted that the Court must examine the specific circumstances of\n\neach case in the course of carefully exercising its discretion as to whether a\n\nparticular remedy at law would be adequate.

He is the collector of\n\nthe evidence, the organizer of the materials, the decisionmaker as to what live\n\ntestimony may be necessary, the factfinder who resolves disputed factual issues,\n\nthe judge who applies the law to the facts, enters specific findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, and may make a specific recommendation to grant or deny\n\nrelief.\" Ex parte Simpson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1879311\"><a href=\"/opinion/1879311/ex-parte-simpson/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 668 (Tex.

A STAY OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n      IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT AN ADEQUATE\n      REMEDY IS AVAILABLE\n\n      This Court issued an Order on April 7, 2014, commanding Judge Gonzalez\n\nto resolve the outstanding issues and to have the completed case forwarded to the\n\nCourt on or before July 3 1, 2014. The Order, which reflected that Mr. Garza had\n\npreviously received extensions of time in which to prepare and investigate the\n\ncase, stated that no further extensions of time would be entertained. 23 See Order of\n\nApril 7, 2014 in Ex parte Humberto Garza, No. WR-78, 113-0 I. The Order also\n\nstated that an order to show cause would issue \"against the trial judge, the\n\nprosecutor and defense counsel,\" ifthe July 31,2014 deadline was not met.\n\n      At the time that the additional information was obtained from former juror\n\nRose Marie Palacios, giving rise to the Motion for Court to Recuse Itself filed on\n\nMay 27,2014, Judge Gonzalez had ordered an evidentiary hearing to commence\n\nduring the week beginning June 9, 2014.

An extension oftime which appears on the Court's\nwebsite as being granted on November 5, 2012, was at the behest of the trial court\non behalf of the State which had not filed its Answer, even though over five years\nhad elapsed since the Application was filed.\n                                        -39-\n\fhas been filed from taking any further action while the motion is pending, Judge\n\nGonzalez was unable to proceed until the motion had been decided.

CIV.\n\nP. 18a (t)(2)(A), Mr. Garza's need for his case to be decided by a different judge\n\nremains, and is the subject of this Petition for Writ of Mandamus. However,\n\nAssistant Criminal District Attorney Theodore C. Hake, who has been handling\n\nthis matter for the appellate division of the Hidalgo County District Attorney's\n\noffice has asked Judge Gonzalez, in a letter of July 7, 2014, to set a renewed date\n\nfor an evidentiary hearing as soon as possible in light of this Court's Order of\n\nApril4, 2014. 24\n\n      While Mr. Garza regrets the need for further delay in this case, he submits\n\nthat his legitimate interest in having his habeas application adjudicated only in a\n\nreliable proceeding before a judge whose impartiality cannot be questioned, and\n\nwho is not encumbered with personal knowledge of the disputed facts, should\n\nprevail over this Court's earlier order.

Further\n\ninfonnation about the communications between the jury, Judge Gonzalez and his\n\nbailiff having thereby come to light, a motion asking Judge Gonzalez to recuse\n\nhimself was tiled on May 27,2014. Judge Gonzalez declined to recuse himself,\n\nand referred this matter to the Regional Presiding Judge, who assigned the case to\n\nthis Court. A hearing was conducted on June 16,2014. Three witnesses testified:\n\nfonner jurors Rose Marie Palacios and Melissa Guenero were called on behalf of\n\nMr. Garza; Alicia \"Licha\" Salinas was called by the State.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n        As stated at the hearing of June 16, 2014, it has thus far only been possible to interview\nsome, but not all, of the trial jurors in this case because of the difftculty that undersigned and\nfonner counsel experienced in obtaining necessary investigative fi.mding.\n                                                -2-\n\fRose Marie Pala~ios (formerly Vera) testified at the hearing as follows:\n\n•         She was a juror at Mr. Garza's 2005 trial, p. 4.2\n\n•         She had concerns for her personal safety during the trial, p. 4.\n\n•      Those concerns were caused by the other jurors, and by the judge saying\n       that jurors could be in danger, as well as by the evidence, p. 4-5.\n\n•      She thought she might be followed or threatened, p. 4.\n\n•      Her concerns were increased by an incident where someone took\n       photographs of the jury in court during the trial, p. 5.\n\n•      The bailiff told the jury members that they would be safe because the judge\n       carried a gun, but that made Mrs. Palacios more nervous, p. 5.\n\n•      The bailifrs comment were made in the jury room, not the courtroom, and\n       with all the jurors present, p. 5, 7.\n\n•      Other jurors had told the bailiff they hoped she was canying a gun: \"And\n       she said no, she didn't, but not to worry because the judge did,\" p. 6.\n\n•      She did not remember Mr. Garza or any of the attorneys ever being present\n       in the jury room, p. 7-8.\n\n•      The jurors had been asking \"if we were safe because of the gang activity.,'\n       Jurors were concerned about gang members' family being in the courtroom,\n       and about the taking of the photograph, p. 8.\n\n•     The conversation with the bailiff occurred during the trial, and before the\n      jury arrived at a guilty verdict, p. 8.\n\n•     The bailiff was a woman called \"Licha,\" p. 9.\n\n      2\n       Page references are to a transcript of the testimony prepared and provided to the parties\non June 17.2014.\n\n                                              -3-\n\f•       The bailiff also said \"that she would be surprised if[thejudge] bought us\n        lunch because he was a cheapskate, and stuff like that,\" p. 9.\n\n•       The judge came into the jury room to talk to the jurors about their safety\n        concerns, p. 10.\n\n•       Ms. Palacios believed that the judge came into the jury room that time in\n        response to a note from another member of the jury, p. 10.\n\n•       When the judge came in, he was still wearing his robe, p. 10.\n\n•       The judge's visit to the jury room was while the trial was still going on, and\n        before the guilty verdict, p. 10.\n\n•       All twelve members of the jury were there, but she could not remember if\n        the bailiff was there also, p. 11.\n\n•       The court reporter may also have been present, but not the defendant or his\n        attorneys, p. 11.3\n\n•       The judge said ''That he understood our fears, but .•• he was going to\n        provide us security and that we would be fine •.• That the gangs, sometimes\n        they threaten the jurors and sometimes they - they may follow you,\" p. 11.\n\n•       The judge said that the person who took the photograph in court was\n        \"legitimate,\" p. 11.\n\n•       Mrs. Palacios thought that the judge may also have come into the jury room\n        another time, in response to a note, p. 12.\n\n•       The judge said that it was a policy in the courthouse not to pennit pictures\n        ofjurors to be taken, p. 13-14.\n\n•       Later in the trial the jury had been pennitted to park on the west side of the\n\n\n       1-fhe reporter's record tiled by the court reporter at trial, the late Francisco B.

However, she had not been\n    questioned about that, p. 27-28.\n\n•   She had been visited in the past few days by defense counsel, p. 28.\n\n•   She did not know if it was a regular policy to let

on the\n      previous occasion in 2007, p. 32.\n\n•     She may not have given further infomtation in 2007 about her security\n      concerns because she was not asked at the time, p. 32.\n\n•     Time constraints may have prevented having a fuller conversation, p. 33.\n\n•     Sentencing someone to death had been a tough decision, p. 33-34.\n\nAlicia \"Lieba\" Salinas testified at the hearing

them notice that they were\n    needed in the courtroom, p. 37.\n\n•   She might escort jurors to a restaurant if lunch was not being brought in for\n    the jury, p. 37.\n\n•   Jurors in the 370th

p. 37-38.\n\n•   She did not specifically remember any jurors expressing security concerns\n    during Mr. Garza's trial, p. 38.\n\n•   If the jury had a note they would hand it to her to give to the judge so that\n    the judge and lawyers could discuss the response, p. 38-39.\n\n•   Usually the judge would have a note handed back to the jury, rather than\n    bringing them back into the

that such breaches could cause negative comment\n       in the media, or reversal of a case which would also cause the judge a loss\n       of reputation, p. 44.\n\n\nII.    A REASONABLE PERSON, KNOWING THE FACTS OF THIS\n       CASE, WOULD REASONABLY DOUBT THE JUDGE'S ABILITY\n       TO ADJUDICATE THE RELEVANT CLAIMS IMPARTIALLY.\n\n       A.

Schuwerk & Lillian\n\nB. Hardwick, Texas Practice Series: Handbook of Texas Lawyer and Judicial\n\nEthics 40:26 at 770 (2010) (quoting Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\n\nState v. Kniatt, No. 25704-CR (40\"' Dist Ct, Ellis County, Tex. Jan. 20, 2008).\n\n      Thus, the correct standard to be applied is simply that of TEX. R. Crv. P.\n\n18b (b)(l): Recusal is required if\"[T]hejudge's impartiality might reasonably be\n\nquestioned,\" because of a factor such as \"an aversion, hostili~ or disposition of a\n\nkind that a fair-minded person could not set aside when judging the dispute\" and it\n\nis not necessary to come to a conclusion that the judge in question is, in fact,\n\nlacking in impartiality.\n\n      B.     The Reasons Why the Judge's Impartiality Might ReasonablY B~\n             Questioned in this  ease.\n      This Court is called on to decide whether a reasonable member of the public\n\nwould reasonably doubt Judge Gonzalez' ability to be impartial in adjudicating\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fclaims concerning jury misconduct or, perhaps more accurately here, the impact of\n\noutside influences improperly brought to bear on the jury. On June 16, 2014, this\n\nCourt heard testimony establishing that Judge Gonzalez had private discussions\n\nwith sitting jurors, outside the presence of the defendant, the court reporter or\n\ncounsel for either party. The discussions concerned the question of the jwy's\n\npersonal safety, in the context of a case whose subject matter concerned a six-\n\nvictim homicide resulting from the activities of members of a local street gang, of\n\nwhich Mr. Garza was alleged to be a Captain. Moreover, this was a death penalty\n\ncase in which the question whether Mr. Garza \"would commit criminal acts of\n\nviolence that would constitute a continuing threat to society,\" was one the jury\n\nwould have to answer at sentencing. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 37.071 § 2\n\n(b){2).\n\n          In addition to now having to make findings of fact concerning his own\n\nconduct, if he continues to preside over this case, Judge Gonzalez would be\n\nrequired to make findings of fact concerning the conduct of his long-time\n\nemployee, Ms. Salinas, who was acting as his bailiff.

Background.\n\n\n      Applicant HUMBERTO GARZA was charged in Count One of the indictment\n\nin cause number CR-3175-04-G with the offense of Capital Murder, based on an\n\nallegation that he had caused the deaths of six individuals \"during the same criminal\n\ntransaction\" and charged in Count Two of the indictment in said case based on an\n\nallegation that he had caused the deaths of six individuals \"in the course of commit-\n\nting or attempting to commit the offense of robbery of(said individuals)\".\n\n      At the end of the guilt phase of a trial on these charges before 370th District\n\nCourt Judge Noe Gonzalez, the jury found Applicant guilty of the lesser-included\n\noffense of Murder as to Count One and the indicted Capital Murder as to Count Two.\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f      The jury then answered \"Yes\" to the future dangerousness and anti-parties\n\nspecial issues and \"No\" to the mitigating circumstances issue as to Count Two and,\n\naccordingly, Judge Gonzalez sentenced Applicant to death.\n\n      The jury also assessed a life sentence as to Count One.\n\n      Judge Gonzalez later allowed trial counsel for Applicant to withdraw;\n\nappointed Alan Futrell to represent Applicant in his direct appeal; and appo~nted Jolm\n\nE. Wright as habeas counsel for Applicant.\n\n      Since TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. Art. 37.071, Sec. 2 (h) (Supp. 2013)\n\nprovides that a capital murder conviction and death sentence is subject to automatic\n\nreview by the Court of Criminal Appeals, Applicant's appeal of his conviction and\n\ndeath sentence based on Count Two of the indictment was submitted to said Court.\n\n      In addition, Applicant's murder conviction and life sentence as to Count One\n\nwas submitted to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals.\n\n      On April 30, 2008, the Court of Criminal Appeals handed down a unanimous\n\nopinion affinning the judgment and death sentence as to Count Two. See Garza v.\n\nState, No. AP-75,217, 2008 Tex.Crim.App. Unpub. LEXIS 340 (April 30, 2008).\n\n      On August 28, 2008, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals issued an unpublished\n\nper curiam opinion in which it mentioned the Court of Criminal Appeals' opinion in\n\nthe death penalty case appeal; stated that the remedy for a violation of a defendant's\n\ndouble jeopardy rights was to vacate one of the convictions; noted that the Court of\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fCriminal Appeals had retained the \"most serious offense\" and affirmed the judgment\n\nand sentence of death in Count Two; and reversed and rendered the conviction and\n\nsentence in Count One for entry of an acquittal as to said count. See Garza v. State,\n\nNo. 13-05-00397-CR, 2008 Tex.App. LEXIS 6859 (Tex.App. - Corpus Christi 2008,\n\nno pet.) (not designated for publication).\n\n      On July 19 2007, Mr. Wright filed an application for writ of habeas corpus on\n\nbehalf of Applicant.\n\n      The State accepted service of a copy of said application, in lieu of formal\n\nservice thereof via certified mail, return receipt requested, on September 18, 2012.\n\n      On October 24, 2012, Mr. Wright filed an motion to withdraw and substitute\n\nattorney Hilary Sheard in which he says that he is unable to continue to represent\n\nApplicant because he has recently undergone open heart surgeries and because Texas\n\nlaw prohibits him, as an attorney who is now employed by a public defender's office,\n\nfrom engaging in the private practice of criminal law.\n\n       On November 9, 2012, this court granted Mr. Wright's motion to withdraw\n\nand substitute Ms. Sheard as habeas counsel for Applicant.\n\n       On November 13, 2012, the State filed Respondent's Original Answer to\n\nApplicant's application far writ, along with a proposed order designating issues.\n\n       On November 15, 2012, Judge Gonzalez entered an Order Designating Issues\n\nin which in which he indicated that there were unresolved fact issues; listed said\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fissues; pointed out that said issues may be resolved by having Applicant's trial attor-\n\nneys, Ralph R. Martinez and Librado \"Keno\" Vasquez, each submit an affidavit re-\n\nsponding to the allegations concerning their perfonnance; and ordered each of those\n\nattorneys to file an affidavit within twenty days of the date of said Order. Said Order\n\nalso stated that Applicant and Respondent were to then submit any proposed findings\n\nof fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation within twenty days after the filing\n\nof whichever affidavit was filed last.\n\n      Ralph R. Martinez submitted his affidavit on February 8, 2013 and Librado\n\n\"Keno\" Vasquez filed his affidavit on March 20, 2013.\n\n      Since Ms. Sheard took over this case from Mr. Wright, she has filed several\n\nextension requests asserting the need for additional time to be able to investigate the\n\nissues involved in this case.\n\n      Moreover, in an order dated April 7, 2014 addressing Ms. Sheard's latest\n\nextension request, the Court of Criminal Appeals indicated that it understands the\n\nintricacies involved in capital litigation, but that it also recognizes Ms. Sheard was, at\n\nthis point, limited to the claims raised in the application which Mr. Wright had filed\n\nin 2007. The Court of Criminal Appeals further ordered the trial court to rule on any\n\noutstanding motions in this case within thirty days of the date of said order and to\n\nresolve any outstanding issues in the case within ninety days of the date of said order\n\nand indicated that an order to show cause and notice to appear would issue against\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\fthe trial judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel if the completed case was not\n\nforwarded to it on or before July 31, 2014.\n\n       On May 12, 2014, Ms. Sheard filed a Motion for an Evidentiary Hearing in\n\nwhich she stated that the affidavits submitted by trial counsel lacked sufficient detail\n\nto be able to adequately resolve the issues concerning adequacy of their performance;\n\nthat a live evidentiary hearing was thus necessary; and that the State had indicated\n\nthat it did not oppose a hearing, although it was concerned about ensuring com-\n\npliance with the deadlines set by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\n       Judge Gonzalez then held a scheduling conference with the attorneys in this\n\ncase and indicated that he would hold a live evidentiary hearing on June 9, 2014.\n\n       On May 27, 2014, Ms. Sheard filed \"Applicant's Motion to Court to Recuse\n\nItself\" in this case.\n\n       In said motion, Ms. Sheard stated that the application for writ filed in 2007 had\n\nincluded a claim that Applicant had been denied his right to a fair trial before an im-\n\npartial jury because of the hostile atmosphere in the courtroom and that Applicant's\n\ndeath sentence had resulted from alleged jury misconduct, namely a judicial com-\n\nment that gangs would sometimes come after jurors, a comment by the bailiff that the\n\njudge was carrying a gun; and the conduct of the trial in an atmosphere of gang vio-\n\nlence. She also indicated that she and an investigator had interviewed former juror\n\nRose Marie Palacios, who had been known as Rose Marie Vera when she served as a\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fjuror; that Ms. Palacios had provided additional details not mentioned in the affidavit\n\nshe had given in 2007; that this information had made it apparent to her that Judge\n\nGonzalez had to be asked to recuse himself; and that it led to a conclusion that Judge\n\nGonzalez' knowledge of evidentiary facts that are in dispute and the possible appear-\n\nance of impropriety and lack of impartiality if Judge Gonzalez continued to deter-\n\nmine the relevant issues compelled filing of the motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n      After discussing the law governing recusal of judges, Ms. Sheard prayed that\n\nJudge Gonzalez either recuse himself or request that the Presiding Judge of this\n\nadministrative district hear the motion himself or assign another judge to do so.\n\n       Judge Gonzalez utilized the latter option and I 39th District Court Judge J.R.\n\n\"Bobby\" Flores was assigned to hear the motion to recuse.\n\n       Accordingly, a hearing was held in the l39th District Court, before Judge\n\nFlores, on June 16, 2014.\n\n       During said hearing, testimony was presented by former juror Rose Marie\n\nPalacios, formerly known as Rose Marie Vera; former juror Melissa Guerrero; and\n\nAlicia uLicha\" Salinas, who had been the bailiff for the 370th District Court at the\n\ntime of the trial of Applicant's case.\n\n       After hearing testimony from those witnesses and the argument of counsel,\n\nJudge Flores requested that the parties submit a memorandum and copies of the cases\n\nthey were relying on. Accordingly, the State is now submitting this memorandum.\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fII.    Fonnat of This Response.\n\n\n       In this document, the State will first describe the legal principles applicable to\n\nevaluation of the motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez. In next applying those principles\nto the evidence presented at the hearing on said motion, the State will demonstrate\n\nthat Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to support his request that Judge\n\nGonzalez be recused from further involvement in this habeas proceeding.\n\n\nIII.   Applicable Legal Principles.\n\n\n       First of all, a Texas judge may be removed from presiding over a case if (1) he\n\nis constitutionally disqualified, (2) he is subject to a statutory strike, or (3) he is sub~\n\nject to statutory disqualification or recusal under Texas Supreme Court rules. See,\n\ne.g., Gaal v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286624\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286624/gaal-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 452 (Tex. Crim.App. 2011); Rhodes v. State,\n\n357 S.W.3d 796,799 (Tex.App.- Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. ref d).\n\n       Secondly, generally a motion to recuse seeks to prevent a judge from hearing a\n\ncase because of a non-constitutional reason, while ground for disqualification are\n\nlimited to those identified in the constitution. See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 452.\n\n       Third, the Court of Criminal Appeals has pointed out that Rule 18b (2) of the\n\nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure sets out the law concerning recusal and includes in-\n\nstances in which a judge must step down from hearing a case for reasons other than\n\nthe disqualifying grounds listed in the constitution. See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 452-53.\n\n\n                                             7\n\f      Fourth, Texas Courts have also noted that Rule 18b (2) states, in pertinent part,\n\nthat, \"a judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in which (a) his impartiality\n\nmight reasonably be questioned or (b) he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning\n\nthe subject matter or a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\n\nconcerning the proceeding.      See,~      Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 43; Youkers v. State, 400\n\nS.W.3d 200,206 (Tex.App.- Dallas 2013, pet. rerd); Rhodes, 357 S.W.3d at 799.\n\n      Fifth, the Court of Criminal Appeals has also stated that there is a lot of over-\n\nlap between the two subsections, but that the first basis for recusal mentioned in Rule\n\n18b (2)--that the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned-appears to be\n\none that the parties may use when in doubt as to any more concrete reason why the\n\njudge should not preside and noted that Justice Kennedy had stated, in his concurring\n\nopinion in Liteky v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 558, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Gaal, 332\n\nS.W.3d at 453. 1\n\n       Sixth, the Court of Criminal Appeals has also pointed out that Rule 18b (2)(b)\n\nis more specific and covers how the judge feels and what the judge knows; that the\n\nFourth Court of Appeals had, for example, held in Abdygapparova v. State, 243\n\n1\n Lower court cases have mentioned this reference to Justice Kennedy's remarks. See Diaz v. State,\n380 S.W.3d 309,312 (Tex.App.- Fort Worth 2012, pet. rerd); Rhodes, 357 S.W.3d at 799-800.\n\n\n                                                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208~10 (Tex.App.- San Antonio 2007, pet. rerd) that the trial judge's\n\nfeeling of personal bias was evidenced by ex parte communications with the prosecu-\n\ntor in which the judge provided guidance to the prosecutor on how to present his case\n\nand discussed the judge's initial ruling regarding the defendant's ongoing request for\n\nan interpreter; and that the situation where the trial judge interrupted a suppression\n\nhearing and announced that he had himself observed the conduct that had led to the\n\ndefendant's initial detention which was involved in Gentry v. State, No. 06-05~\n\n00237-CR, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS 2923 (Tex.App.- Texarkana 2006, no pet.) (not\n\ndesignated for publication) was an illustration of a clear instance of \"personal know-\n\nledge of disputed evidentiary facts\" requiring recusal. See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 453.\n\n      Seventh, said Court has also indicated that recusal is, however, generally not\n\nrequired when based solely on judicial rulings, remarks, or actions; that those acts\n\nalmost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion; that they may be\n\nproper grounds for appeal, but not for recusal; and that opinions formed by the judge\n\non the basis of facts introduced, or events occurring, during the current or prior pro-\n\nceedings do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a\n\ndeep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\n\nSee Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 454, quoting Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. at 1157.\n\n      Eighth, Texas courts have further stated that a judge's remarks that are critical,\n\ndisapproving, or hostile to counsel, the parties, or their cases will thus usually not\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fsupport a bias or partiality challenge, although they may do so if they reveal an opin·\n\nion based on extrajudicial information and will require recusal if they reveal ''such a\n\nhigh degree of favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible\";\n\nthat expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and anger that are within\n\nthe bounds of what imperfect people display do not establish bias or partiality; and\n\nthat a judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration thus do not make him sub-\n\nject to recusal. See Gaal, 332 S.W.3d at 454; Rhodes, 357 S.W.3d at 800.\n\n      Ninth, said Court has also stated that, although intemperate remarks or un-\n\nethical conduct may well violate a rule of judicial conduct, such a violation does not\n\nnecessarily mean that the judge should be recused.

Application ofThese Principles to the Facts Presented at the Recusal Hearing.\n\n\n      Application of these legal principles to the facts adduced at the hearing on Ap-\n\nplicant's motion to recuse Judge Gomalez demonstrates that Applicant has not met\nhis burden to establish a sufficient factual basis to warrant granting of his request.\n\n      First of all, former juror Rose Marie Palacios merely referred in general terms\n\nto having had concerns for her personal safety; said that other jurors and \"the judge\n\nand stuff like that\" had told the jurors that sometimes some of the jurors could be in\n\ndanger; indicated that she had been afraid of being followed, or talked to, or maybe\n\nbeing threatened; indicated that her concerns had mostly been the result of other\n\njurors talking about their fears; and stated that she had not really thought about \"if'.\n\n       However, Ms. Palacios never provided any specifics about any remarks made\n\nby any particular individual, including what exactly had been said, who had made\n\nsaid comments, or when said remarks had been made.\n\n       Secondly, Ms. Palacios also stated that the evidence of gang activity in the\n\ncase had increased her concerns, but also admitted that the facts of the case involved\n\ngangs on both sides and that people she had seen in the parking lot or the courtroom\n\nthat had concerned her could be family members of either the victims or Applicant.\n\n       Third, Ms. Palacios further stated that her concerns had been increased_ when\n\nsomeone in the audience took a photograph toward the jury, but further acknow-\n\nledged that Judge Gonzalez had reassured the jury that that person was a legitimate\n\n\n                                            12\n\fmember of the media and that he would make sure that said individual was reminded\n\nof the policy not to take photographs which identified jurors when the jurors' concern\n\nabout the photograph was somehow conveyed to him.\n\n      Fourth, Ms. Palacios also said that male members of the jury had been talking\n\nto the bailiff about gang activity, seeing gang members' families in the courtroom,\n\nand someone carrying the photograph while the jury was in the jury room at some\n\nunspecified point during the guilt phase of trial; that someone had told the bailiff that\n\nthey hoped that she was carrying a gun; and that the bailiff had responded that she\n\ndid not do so, but that the jurors did not have to worry because the judge had a gun.\n\n      However, Alicia \"Licha\" Salinas, who had been the bailiff during Applicant's\n\ntrial, testified that she had not carried a gun while serving in that capacity; that she\n\ndid not remember ever telling anyone that Judge Gonzalez carried a gun; that she\n\ndoes not think that she would have told anybody that Judge Gonzalez carried a gun;\n\nand that Judge Gonzalez did not, to her knowledge, carry a gun \"back then\".\n\n      Accordingly, there is a clear-cut factual dispute concerning whether Ms. Sali-\n\nnas had made a remark about Judge Gonzalez carrying a gun for this court, as the\n\nfact-finder in regard to the motion to recuse to resolve.\n\n      Moreover, the State would submit that Ms. Salinas' testimony on this subject\n\nis more credible than that of Ms. Palacios, particularly in light of the lack of any cred-\n\nible explanation why a court bailiff would volunteer such prejudicial information.\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\f      Fifth, even under Ms. Palacios' version of events, the remark Ms. Salinas\n\nallegedly made was that Judge Gonzalez had a gun, which literally merely means that\n\nhe possessed some type of gun, such as a hunting rifle, at some undisclosed location,\n\nsuch as his residence.\n\n      Sixth, Ms. Palacios further indicated that the bailiff had further assured the\n\njurors that the court would make sure that the jurors were allowed to park closer to\n\nthe courtroom when they worked into the evening.\n\n      Seventh, Ms. Palacios said that Judge Gonzalez had, at one point during the\n\nguilt phase of trial, come into the jury room to re-assure the jurors that h~ understood\n\ntheir concerns about their safety, reassure them that he was going to provide security\n\nfor them, and let the jury know that the person who had taken the photograph which\n\nhad concerned them was legitimate and that he would make sure that the photograph\n\nwould not become public.\n\n      However, Ms. Palacios also admitted that, when Judge Gonzalez came to talk\n\nto the jurors, it would concern issues concerning scheduling and whether the jurors\n\nwould be available to finish the trial or work late.\n\n      Eighth, although Ms. Palacios mentioned Judge Gonzalez speaking to the jury\n\nin response to a note from some jurors, she did not give any specific information\n\nabout the content of any such note, at what point the note had been sent, which juror\n\nor jurors had sent the note, or the content of the judge's response to the note.\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f      Moreover, while it was suggested that an oral communication outside of the\n\npresence of Applicant and the attorneys involved in the case would be improper, any\n\nsuch improper conduct would merely involve an arguable violation of the rules of\n\njudicial conduct and would not constitute evidence of judicial bias or lack of impar-\n\ntiality sufficient to show that Judge Gonzalez should be recused from this case.\n\n       Ninth, Ms. Palacios acknowledged that her first affidavit, which she executed\n\nin 2007, mentioned a time when she thought that Applicant's mother was sitting\n\nalone in the parking lot when she went to her car; that someone had told a member of\n\nthe court staff; and that she had been reassured that the court would take care of the\n\nsituation.\n\n       Tenth, former juror Melissa Guerrero merely testified that she had had con-\n\ncerns about her personal safety during the first few days of the trial, because of the\n\nextent of the crime involved and the fact that the case had to do with gang violence.\n\n       Ms. Guerrero further indicated that \"nothing really was mentioned\" by the\n\nother jurors about the security situation; that they had been concerned about being\n\nfollowed while walking to their cars; and that the jurors had also been concerned\n\nabout the incident where a reporter had taken a photograph of the jury.\n\n       Eleventh, Ms. Guerrero also said that Judge Gonzalez had come into the jury\n\nroom on about the fifth or sixth day of the trial to calm down those jurors who had\n\nhad questions or concerns about their safety; that the jurors had been allowed to park\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fin a different area at some point and to be released from court first; and that she\n\nassumed that the change had occurred because of the concerns about security.\n\n         Twelfth, Ms. Guerrero indicated that the only other time Judge Gonzalez had\n\ncome to talk to the jury was when he came to thank them for their service and pro-\n\nvide information if anyone wanted counseling after serving in this death penalty case.\n\n         Finally, although Ms. Palacios and Ms. Guerrero were not asked any questions\n\nabout the effect of the events they were describing on their deliberations during their\n\ntestimony at the hearing on the motion to recuse, Judge Flores took judicial notice of\n\nthe contents of the court file pertaining to this case, which included the affidavits by\n\nMs. Palacios which are attached to Applicant's motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n         Furthermore, Ms. Guerrero says that she would have voted differently if she\n\nhad known that a co-defendant had received a lesser sentence in her 2007 affidavit;\n\nstates that certain defense witnesses at the punishment phase had not had any impact\n\non her in her 20 14 affidavit, and also says, in the latter affidavit, that the issue of\n\nsecurity had played a big role in her decision on the future dangerousness special\n\nISSUe.\n\n\n         Because this material is thus arguably part of Applicant's effort to show that\n\nthe jury had had concerns about their safety, the State must, out of an abundance of\n\ncaution, note that TEX. R. EVID. ANN. 606 (b) does not allow a juror to testify or\n\nprovide an affidavit \"as to any matter or statement occurring during the jury's delib-\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\ferations, or to the effect of anything on any juror's mind or emotions or mental pro-\n\ncesses, as influencing any juror's assert to or dissent from the verdict or indictment\".\n\n      The State would also note that the Court of Criminal Appeals recently\n\ndiscussed this principle in Colyer v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Crim.App. 2014)?\n\n       In particular, in Colyer, said Court noted that the purpose of Rule 606 (b) is to\n\nlimit \"the role jurors may play in attacking the validity of a verdict\"; that this limita-\n\ntion serves the important policy interests of (I) encouraging jurors to candidly dis-\n\ncuss the case; (2) protecting jurors from post-trial harassment, (3) promoting finality,\n\nand (4) preventing tampering and fraud; that courts try to maintain the balance be-\n\ntween the goal of a trial by a jury free from bias or misconduct and the need to pre-\n\nvent losing parties from trying the jury; and that Rule 606 (b) and the case law have\n\ngenerally struck the balance in favor of the privacy of deliberations. Id. at 15-16.\n\n       The Court of Criminal Appeals next stated that the most common, but dis-\n\nallowed, means to impeach the jury's verdict is the \"disgruntled juror''; that a juror\n\nwho reluctantly joined a verdict is likely to be sympathetic to overtures by the loser\n\nand persuadable to the view that his own consent rested on false or impermissible\n\nconsiderations; that allowing such jurors to impeach their former verdict would give\n\nthe losing party much to gain and little to lose in harassing all of the former jurors in\n\n2\n  Although LexisNexus indicates that Colyer has now been published at </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, it does not\ninclude mention of page numbers within said publication of said case. For this reason, in describing\npassages in said caset the State has utilized the references found in the Lexis citation to Colyer v.\nState, No. PD·0305~13, 2014 Tex.Crim.App. LEXIS 636 (April30, 2014).\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fa search for a \"disgruntled\" one; and that \"Rule 606 (b) flatly prohibits 'disgruntled\n\njuror' evidence either by affidavit or testimony\". Id. at* 17.\n\n      Said Court next indicated that the purpose of the exception to Rule 606 (b)\n\nwhich allows testimony about outside influences is to allow proof of external pres-\n\nsures that are likely to influence the verdict; that, in McQuarrie v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 (Tex.Crim.App. 2012), it had explained that an \"outside influence\" is\n\n\"something originating from a source outside of the jury room and other than from\n\nthe jurors themselves\"; that a Rule 606 (b) inquiry is, therefore, limited to that which\n\noccurs both outside of the jury room and outside of the jurors' personal knowledge\n\nand experience; that external events or information, unrelated to the trial, which hap-\n\npen to cause jurors to feel personal pressure to hasten or end deliberations are not\n\n''outside influences\" because they are caused by a juror's personal and emotional re-\n\naction to information that is irrelevant to the trial issues; that those kinds of internal\n\npersonal pressures are normal and may be expected in any trial; and that they are,\n\nfurthermore, not \"improperly brought to bear\" upon the juror in a manner designed or\n\nlikely to influence deliberations. Id. at *17-19.\n\n       The Court of Criminal Appeals also stated that Texas cases have concluded\n\nthat allowing normal personal pressures to qualify as 'outside influences\" would jeo-\n\npardize the finality of virtually every verdict; that, under Colyer's interpretation, any\n\njuror who had had second thoughts about his vote could retroactively claim that a\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\fpersonal pressure made him apprehensive and eager to conclude the deliberations;\n\nthat Rule 606 (b) explicitly prohibits post-verdict testimony about a juror's mental\n\nprocesses to impeach the verdict; and that most jurors feel some type of normal\n\ninternal, individual pressures throughout the entire trial. Id. at *26-30.\n\n      The State would submit that the remarks about jurors who have second-\n\nthoughts about their decisions which the Court of Criminal Appeals made in Colyer\n\nare clearly relevant to evaluation of the credibility of the testimony and affidavits\n\nprovided by former jurors Rose Marie Palacios and Melissa Guerrero.\n\n\nV.    The Unique Aspect of This Recusal Motion: It Seeks Recusal In Regard to a\n      Proceeding In Which the Judge Is Allowed to Utilize Personal Recollection.\n\n\n      The State is compelled to mention one more other point before concluding this\n\nresponse to Applicant's motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n      Applicant's motion seeks to recuse Judge Gonzalez from further involvement\n\nin this post-conviction habeas proceeding in a death penalty case under TEX. CODE\n\nCRIM. PROC. ANN. Art. 11.071 (Supp. 201.3).\n\n      The present status of this case is that an application for writ and an answer\n\nhave been filed, an Order Designating Issues has been entered, trial counsel have sub-\n\nmitted affidavits, Applicant has filed a motion for a live courtroom hearing, said\n\nmotion has been granted, and the hearing which Judge Gonzalez had scheduled has\n\nbeen put on hold pending disposition of the motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez.\n\n\n                                           19\n\f      Accordingly, the next step to be taken once the recusal issue is resolved would\n\nbe to hold the live courtroom hearing; have both sides submit proposed fmdings of\n\nfact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation; and have whatever judge ends up\n\npresiding over this case enter findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n      Moreover, the Court of Criminal Appeals April 7, 2014 order imposes some\n\ntime pressure for those matters to occur.\n\n      Typically, a trial judge is expected to be unfamiliar with the facts of the case\n\nand the parties involved, although the case law mentioned earlier indicates that some\n\nknowledge of the case, such as information derived from having tried the case\n\ninvolving a co-defendant, is not necessarily grounds for recusal.\n\n       However, this case, a post-conviction habeas proceeding, involves a somewhat\n\ndifferent situation.\n\n       After all, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. Art. 11.071, Sec. 9 (a) (Supp.\n\n2013) states that, in order to resolve any designated controverted, previously un-\n\nresolved fact issues material to the legality of the applicant's confinement, \"the court\n\nmay require affidavits, depositions, interrogatories, and evidentiary hearings and may\n\nuse personal recollection\".\n\n       The clear implication of this last phrase is thus that the court may have some\n\nlevel of personal knowledge of the relevant disputed fact issues and is not required to\n\nbe totally without any knowledge concerning them.\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\f      Admittedly, the statute and case law do not specify the extent of personal\n\nrecollection which the trial judge is allowed to utilize and what level of knowledge\n\nwould be too much to allow him to remain impartial and would thus require recusal.\n\n      The State would, nonetheless, submit that, wherever the line should be drawn,\n\nthe evidence which Applicant has produced in support of his motion to recuse does\n\nnot support a conclusion that Judge Gonzalez' impartiality might reasonably be\n\nquestioned and that he should be recused from further involvement in this case.\n\n\nVI.   Conclusion and Prayer.\n\n\n      This Court should deny Applicant's motion to recuse Judge Gonzalez based\n\nupon the lack of sufficient factual support for Applicant's contention that Judge Gon-\n\nzalez' impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\n\n      Accordingly, the State prays that this Court deny Applicant's motion to recuse\n\nJudge Gonzalez.\n\n\n                                            Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                            RENE GUERRA,\n                                            CRIIvfiNAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY\n                                            HIDALGO COUNTY, TEXAS\n                                               c      .....?                      #\n\n\n\n\n                                               L/~c:'~\n                                            THEODORE C.

The Application contained allegations that:\n\n      •      Mr. Garza was denied his right to a fair trial before an impartial jury\n             under the Sixth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment and the Due\n\n\n                                     Page 1 ofl4\n\f                Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because of the hostile\n                atmosphere in the courtroom (Claim 4);\n\n       •        Mr. Garza's death sentence resulted from jury misconduct, including\n                the exposure of the jury to outside influences, namely a comment to\n                the jury by the trial judge that gangs would sometimes come after\n                jurors, a comment by the bailiff that the judge was carrying a gun,\n                and the conduct of the trial in an atmosphere of gang violence, as well\n                as premature deliberations, and the conveying of extra-record\n                infonnation by two jurors to the other jury members (Claims 5 & 6).\n\n\n4.         These allegations were supported by:\n\n       •        Exhibit 2: A listing of coverage of the trial from the local newspaper\n                \"The Monitor;\"\n\n       •        Exhibit 23 and 24: Affidavit and Declaration ofjuror Miguel\n                Martinez;\n\n       •        Exhibit 25: Declaration ofjuror Felipe Hernandez;\n\n       •        Exhibit 26: Affidavit ofjuror Rose Marie Vera;\n\n       •        Exhibit 27: Affidavit ofjuror Melissa Guerrero\n\n5.     The affidavit ofjuror Rose Marie Vera, Exhibit 27, indicated that the trial\n\n       judge had \"warned us that sometimes gang members come after the jury,\"\n\n       that the judge had given reassurance to the jurors about a journalist who had\n\n       taken a photograph in the courtroom, and that a bailiff had told the jury that\n                                  1\n       the judge carried a gun.\n\n\n\n       1\n        Applicant was alleged to be a leader of the \"Tri-City Bombers\" gang, and was charged\nwith carrying out a six-victim robbery-homicide along with other gang members.\n                                         Page2ofl4\n\f6.    Jurors Miguel Martinez and Melissa Guerrero, as well as Rose Marie Vera,\n\n      indicated that they had been concerned for their safety during the trial. See\n\n      Exhibits 24, 26, 27.\n\n1.    The Answer filed by the State of Texas on November 13,2012, contended,\n\n      at 387, that these claims \"are based on factual premises of doubtful validity!'\n\n8.    The Answer continued: ''the fact that Applicant merely argues that exposure\n\n      of the jury to the information to which he refers had been likely to have\n\n      denied him the impartial system to which he was entitled demonstrated the\n\n      lack of validity of his arguments.•.. Habeas relief must be based on a\n\n      showing that a constitutional right was violated, and not merely a claim that\n\n      it is likely that it was violated.\" Jd\n\n9.    The 2007 affidavit of Rose Marie Vera, which was obtained by volunteer\n\n      law students, did not specify whether the comment made by the judge about\n\n      gangs was made in open court (it does not appear on the record), what were\n\n      the circumstances in which the bailiff was talking to the jury about the\n\n      judge, and what the influence of the judge and bailiff's comments had been\n\n      on Ms. Vera's sentencing decision.\n\n10.   Undersigned counsel filed a series of funding applications for investigative\n\n      expenses in this matter. Unfortunately, the requested funding was not\n\n      granted in full, and investigative work on the case has therefore been\n\n                                       Pagel of14\n\f        sporadic. Counsel experienced great difficulty in scheduling her\n\n        investigator's work as a result: neither she nor the investigator are local to\n\n        the area, and the investigator has had other substantial commitments to\n\n        capital trial cases. Thus, additional jury interviewing was only recently\n\n        conducted, with undersigned counsel accompanying the investigator, Kristi\n\n        Bishop.\n\nB.      Newly-Discovered Facts Indicating the Need for the Court's Rec:usal.\n\nI 1.    On Sunday May 18, 2014, undersigned counsel, together with Ms. Bishop,\n\n        interviewed Rose Marie Vera, now known as Rose Marie Palacios, at her\n\n        home.\n\n12.     On Monday May 19,2014, Ms. Palacios signed an affidavit repeating\n\n        matters she had discussed in the interview of May 18, 2012, which included\n\n        more detailed infonnation than was previously known to counse1:2\n\n13.     In her affidavit, Ms. Palacios explained that the judge, the Hon. Noe\n\n       Gonzalez, had spoken to the jury in the jwy room behind the courtroom on\n\n        more than one occasion. In addition to talking to the jury about the security\n\n       risk that gang members represented to jurors, the judge also spoke to them in\n\n       response to notes they had sent out.\n\n\n       2\n         Copies of both Ms. Vera/Palacios' affidavits are attached. The affidavit of May 19,\n2014, will be submitted as part of a volume of supplemental exhibits to the habeas application\nbeing filed with the court.\n                                          Page4of14\n\f14.   Ms. Palacios stated that, so far as she could recall, the attorneys representing\n\n      the State and the defense were not present at the time the judge warned the\n\n      jury about gangs, or at any time when he was with them in the jury room.\n\n15.   Ms. Palacios identified the bailiff who had told the jury members that the\n\n      judge carried a gun as being a woman named \"Licha.\" Some members of\n\n      the jury had told Licha that they were concerned about their personal safety,\n\n      and Licha had told them that Judge Gonzalez always carried a gun. Ms.\n\n      Palacios believed that Judge Gonzalez was in the habit of carrying a gun\n\n      because he had been threatened in the past.\n\n16.   Ms. Palacios concluded that: \"It is my belief that the issue of security during\n\n      the trial played a big role in my decision on the issue of deciding whether\n\n      Mr. Garza was a future danger to society. I had my own security concerns\n\n      very much in mind, and they were increased by Licha' s comment about the\n\n      judge carrying a gun, and by what the judge said about the gang following\n\n      jurors.\"\n\n17.   Now that Ms. Palacios has explained the circumstances of both the court and\n\n      its bailiff's conduct, for example, by ascertaining that her reference to the\n\n      trial court talking about gangs following jurors was not a mishearing of\n\n      something said on the open record, it has become apparent to undersigned\n\n      counsel that the court must be asked to recuse itself.\n\n                                     PageSofl4\n\f18.     This motion is not predicated on any allegation that Judge Gonzalez harbors\n\n        any personal bias against applicant However, and unfortunately, the newly\n\n        discovered facts lead to the inevitable conclusion that the court's personal\n\n        knowledge of evidentiary facts that are in dispute, and the possible\n\n        appearance of impropriety and lack of impartiality if he continues to\n\n        detennine the relevant issues, compel the filing of this motion on Mr.\n\n        Garza's behalf. 3\n\n                                      Law and Argument\n\n      The court can got preside over this proceeding because it has personal\n      knowledge of disputed evidentiaa facts concerning Applicant's trial.\n\n\n        Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b(b) provides various grounds for recusal,\n\nsuch as where the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, where the\n\njudge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or party, or has\n\npersonal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.

Crim. App. 1983). Because there is no legislative\n\nintent otherwise, TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b applies in this case.\n\n           TEX. R. Ctv. P. 18b(b)(3) plainly states that a '~udge must recuse in any\n\nproceeding in which ... the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary\n\nfacts concerning the proceeding.\" TEx. R. Crv. P. 18b(b)(3). When a judge has\n\npersonally witnessed the events whose existence and legal significance he would\n\nhave to decide, he must recuse himself. See, e.g., Gentry v. State, No. 06-05-\n\n00237-CR, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 2923 (Tex. App.- Texarkana April 12, 2006,\n\nno. pet.)Gudge could not conduct suppression hearing where he had himself\n\nobserved conduct leading to initial detention}.\n\n       It appears that the court here was communicating with the jury privately,\n\nwhereas TEX. CoDE CRJM. PROC. Art. 36.27 mandates that all communications\n\nbetween jurors and the trial court must be written, with the court's responses to\n\njuror questions also being in writing, where possible after securing the presence of\n\nthe defendant and counsel, and being read out in open court unless expressly\n\nwaived by the defendant.4 The court will have personal knowledge of whether or\n\n       4\n        There are jury notes in the record, 2 CR 925-942. many dealing with \"housekeeping\"\nmatters such as bathroom breaks or requests for food, to which no written response appears.\n                                         Page7 ofl4\n\fnot there were such communications conducted without following the strictures of\n\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. Art. 36.27.5\n\n           Moreover, the court would have personal knowledge both of whether or not\n\nhe carries a gun, and whether the bailiff would know that fact. The court may also\n\nhave personal knowledge of what the bailiff said to the jury members about his\n\nowning a gun.\n\n           The State has already questioned the \"validity'' of the factual premises of\n\nApplicant's claims concerning outside influences upon the jury; Applicant\n\ncontends that those outside influences did exist, and did have a deleterious impact\n\non the fairness of the proceedings against him. Thus, there exist here\n\n\"controverted, previously unresolved factual issues,\" under TEX. CODE CRIM.\n\nPROC.      Art. 11.071 § 9 (a).6\n\n\nTwo notes, requesting guidance as to the charge, do include the court's written response, 2 CR\n931 and 935, but there is nothing in the record to indicate that there was any consultation with\ncounsel, nor were the responses read in open court. While there is one note indicating juror\nconcem that people were able to overhear their deliberations at a point when they had gone into\ndte courtroom in order to deliberate there, 2 CR 929, there is no written response to that note.\nThus, it appears that TEx.

Art. 36.27 was not being scrupulously followed.\n       ''\"(A]ny private communication, contac~ or tamperin& directly or indirectly, with a juror\nduring a trial about a matter pending before the jury is ... deemed presumptively prejudicial, if\nnot made in pursuance of known rules of the court ••. with full knowledge of the parties.\"\nRemmer v.

Pretty much just to calm us down, or those who had\n\n 2   questions or concerns that safety, you know, we would be parking\n\n 3   in a different area.    By that point, I think they moved us\n\n 4   towards the back.\n\n 5        Q.   Let's talk for a moment about the parking.

And was it explained to you that it was concern about\n\n10   security that caused a change in the parking arrangements?\n\n11        A.   Not direct.

I am Rose Marie Palacios, formerly known as Rose Marie Vera.\n     The change in my name is because Vera was my married name.\n     I am now divorced.\n\n2.   I was a juror at the 2005 death penalty trial of Humberto Garza.\n     I gave an affidavit concerning that trial in 2007, which I have\n     reviewed, and I confirm that the facts stated in that affidavit are\n     true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n\n3.   I have now been asked additional questions concerning Mr.\n     Garza's trial. In my previous affidavit, I explained that the bailiff\n     at the trial had told the jury members that the judge always\n     carried a gun. That bailiff was a little woman whose name was\n     \"Licha.\" She took us to and from the jury room and generally\n     escorted us. For example, when the judge bought us all lunch,\n     which happened on a couple of occasions, Licha took us to the\n     restaurant.\n\n4.   So far as I recall, Licha's comment about the judge always\n     carrying a gun was made when all of the jury was together in the\n     jury room behind the courtroom.\n\n5.   Some members of the jury were concerned about whether they\n     were safe, given that we were sitting on a case involving a gang.\n     There were jurors who were alarmed that there was a reporter\n     who took a photograph in the courtroom, and who were\n     concerned about people in the courtroom who might be gang\n     members.\n\n                                      1\n\f6.    Some jurors were worried about whether they were safe parking\n      in the public lot at the front of the courthouse. For example,\n      some, including me, were concerned that a relative or supporter\n      of Mr. Garza might write down our license plate numbers out in\n      that lot, and then follow us.\n\n7.    I was concerned about my personal safety. When we heard from\n      Licha that the judge carried a gun, I believed that to mean that\n      he must have past experiences of being threatened. Licha's\n      comment about the gun added to my fear.\n\n8.    Some members of the jury told Licha we were concerned about\n      the security situation, although I did not personally complain\n      about it.\n\n9.    There was a young man on the jury who sat next to me who\n      seemed so scared that after the sentencing he literally ran from\n      the room and let the door almost swing into my face.\n\n10.   In my previous affidavit, I mentioned that the judge had warned\n      us that sometimes gang members come after members of the\n      jury in a case. I was not previously asked to explain when that\n      warning was given. It was when the jury was in the jury room.\n      It was not in open court. So far as I recall, the attorneys\n      representing the State and the defense were not present at that\n      time, or at any time when the judge was with us in the jury\n      room.\n\n11.   A couple of times at least the judge spoke to us in the jury room\n      in response to a note we sent out. I can't remember precisely,\n      but I think we sent out at least a couple of notes. At times Licha\n      would respond if we had a question.\n\n12.   As stated in my previous affidavit, the judge reassured us that\n      the reporter who took a photograph in court was legitimate. My\n      recollection is that we were all back in that jury room when the\n      judge gave that reassurance.\n\n\n                                    2\n\f13.   I think that the court reporter, who was a young man, came into\n      the jury room a couple of times also, but I can't remember why\n      he was there.\n\n14.   When I signed my previous affidavit, I had forgotten that part\n      way through the trial we were allowed to start parking in the lot\n      behind the courthouse, which was used by the judges and court\n      staff. We were told by the deputies that the change was made\n      because jurors had expressed fear about the gang members. I\n      think that the change in parking arrangements only made me\n      more scared that something might happen to me.\n\n15.   The Judge made it very clear that the case would definitely\n      conclude by Easter. While I thought it was possible that we\n      might continue longer than that if it was necessary, I thought\n      that it was inappropriate to fix a finishing time in a case where a\n      man's life was at stake.\n\n16.   In the end, the trial was not that long - just a couple of weeks at\n      most - and the sentencing phase seemed very short.\n\n17.   The lead defense attorney looked professional, but he showed no\n      passion: it was as though his heart was not in it.\n\n18.   This was not an attorney who even seemed to be trying very\n      hard. He did not present much evidence. It made me sorry for\n      the young man on trial, to be represented by an attorney like\n      that.\n\n19.   When the lead defense counsel presented the character\n      witnesses at sentencing, he did not draw much out of them. I\n      could not even understand the point of his aunt's testimony. The\n      religious witnesses did not really have any impact on me at all.\n\n20.   The lead defense attorney argued that Mr. Garza did not intend\n      or expect the people who died in that house to be shot, but that\n      was just not credible - it was going too far to expect us to believe\n      that.\n\n\n                                    3\n\f21.   The lead defense attorney seemed to be thrown off course by the\n      prosecution objections when defense evidence was being\n      presented.\n\n22.   The junior defense attorney hardly spoke at all, and I was not\n      sure what he was doing there. He seemed almost like an\n      assistant or secretary.\n\n23.   The end of the sentencing was very emotional. I was actually\n      worried that people might pass out. There were people in the\n      jury room crying openly, even a younger man was just sobbing\n      like a baby. For some reason we had to wait there until the\n      judge came to talk to us. I can't even remember what he said\n      then, but he did not try to console the people who were so upset.\n\n24.   It is my belief that the issue of security during the trial played a\n      big role in my decision on the issue of deciding whether Mr.\n      Garza was a future danger to society. I had my own security\n      concerns very much in mind, and they were increased by Licha's\n      comment about the judge carrying a gun, and by what the judge\n      said about the gang following jurors.\n\nI have read this affidavit and swear upon pain and penalty of perjury\nthat it is true and correct.\n\n\n\nk~~)\nSigned\n\nSIGNED AND SWORN before me this \\        Oi~ay of~                 1   2014:\n\n\n\n\n                                     4\n                                           -\n\f               Exhibit J\nAffidavit of Rose Marie Vera, July 14, 2007\n\fSTATE OF TEXAS                       }\n                                     }\nCOUNTY OF HIDALGO                    }\n\n\n                         AFFIDAVIT OF ROSE MARIE VERA\n\n       My name is Rose Marie Vera. I am a resident of Hidalgo County, Texas. I am over\nthe age of eighteen and am competent to make this affidavit. All the facts stated here are\nwithin my personal knowledge.\n\n\n       1.     I was a juror in the 2005 capital murder trial of Humberto Garza.\n\n       2.     The death penalty was presented to us as if it was not our decision to make.\n              We just answered the questions given to us and then it was the judge who gave\n              death penalty. It is the judge's authority to give the death penalty.\n\n       3.     The way it was explained to the jury, and the way I understood it, is that it was\n              capital murder if you were involved in the crime any way.\n\n       4.     The security guards and deputies would occasionally make sure we got to our\n              car in the parking lot safely. Another night, when we went to the parking lot,\n              only one car remained. Mr. Garza's mother was sitting in her car, alone,\n              staring at us. I was worried she was writing down our license plate numbers.\n              Another night during the trial, I thought a truck was following me home from\n              the courthouse. I moved aside so it could pass me, but it didn't pass me. I\n              drove past my driveway and circled the block and the car stopped following\n              me.\n\n       5.     During the trial, the male jurors noticed that a couple of Garza's friends in the\n              audience were staring at us. There was a reporter in the audience who took a\n              picture of us. We were scared and we took our fears to the judge. The judge\n              assured us that the reporter was legitimate and trustworthy.\n\n       6.     The judge warned us that sometimes gang members come after the jury. What\n              made it scary for us is that you never know who is or is not a gang member in\n              the Valley. I thought Garza's gang could work anywhere, even inside the\n              courtroom.\n\n       7.     The judge carried a gun. He always had one. We knew this because the\n              bailiff told us that the judge carried one. Even the bailiff didn't carry a gun.\n\n       8.     After the death verdict was read, there was one man who was so scared that he\n              ran through the door to get out of the courtroom before everyone else. I\n              remember he hit let the door hit me on his way out, he was so scared.\n\n       9.     I was worried that Garza's lawyers would feel rushed because the judge said,\n              \"we are going to finish. There is no way we are going to come back after\n\f              Easter.\" I think he mentioned something about traveling or fishing with his\n              son. We finished on Holy Thursday.\n\n       10.    Garza's lawyer was professional, but not passionate. The lawyer just did not\n              have a lot to work with.\n\n       11.    I feel all of the defendants should be punished equally for their involvement in\n              the crime. If I had known Marcial Bocanegra, one of the shooters in the\n              murders, would receive a 35-year sentence for the actual shooting, I would\n              have voted for a life sentence for Humberto Garza instead of a death sentence.\n\n       12.    On June 29, 2007, Felicia Espinosa and Peter Walker, two student interns,\n              showed me affidavits from Garza's mother and aunt. This evidence was not\n              presented at trial. I did not know about Garza's sexual molestation. The\n              affidavits show a very dysfunctional family. I did not see that at trial.\n\n       13.    I do remember from trial that Garza's father was in prison and Garza had seen\n              a neighbor killed as a kid. Garza's mother testified that Garza was working at\n              the time. She thought he was doing well. She should have known he was\n              meeting with his old friends. The testimony of Ms. Garza's mother was just\n              not compelling.\n\n\n       I have read all 13 paragraphs of the above statement and swear, under the pain and\npenalty of perjury, that it is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. I give this\nstatement of my own free will.\n\n\n\n                                                     Rose Marie Vera\n\n\n                                                        61-Jtf -(J?\n                                                     Date\n\n\n\n        Subscribed to and sworn before me by Rose Marie Vera\non thisJ.¥-  day of July, 2007.\n\n\n                                              ~~\n                                               Notary Public\n\nMy Commission expires:   _)-_---~-~--(;~7t:....__                      MARIO CAVAZOS\n                                                                     MY COMMISSION EXPIRES\n                                                                           May30, 2009\n\f              Exhibit K\nAffidavit of Melissa Guerrero, July 14, 2007\n\fSTATE OF TEXAS                        }\n                                      }\nCOUNTY OF HIDALGO                     }\n\n\n                        AFFIDAVIT OF MELISSA GUERRERO\n\n        My name is Melissa Guerrero. I am a resident of Hidalgo County, Texas. I am over\nthe age of eighteen and am competent to make this affidavit. All the facts stated here are\nwithin my personal knowledge.\n\n\n          1.   I was a juror in the in Humberto Garza's 2005 Capital Murder trial.\n\n          2.   As it was explained to us, the jurors were supposed to only answer the special\n               issue questions during the sentencing phase of the trial. It was the judge who\n               would ultimately decide Humberto Garza's sentence.\n\n          3.   Even after the special issue questions had been answered, I still did not know\n               what Humberto Garza's sentence would be. When the judge announced the\n               death sentence I took it really hard.\n\n          4.   If I had known Mr. Cantu, the other person accused of planning the robbery,\n               would be acquitted of charges relating to the murders, it would have\n               influenced me to vote for a life sentence rather than a death sentence.\n\n          5.   If I had known that Mr. Bocanegra, one of the shooters in the murders, would\n               receive a 35-year sentence for the murders, I would have voted for a life\n               sentence instead of a death sentence.\n\n          6.   Both Cantu's acquittal and Bocanegra's sentence would have influenced me\n               sufficiently to vote for a life sentence.\n\n          7.   During the sentencing phase, I remember looking at a list of Humberto\n               Garza's prior convictions. One conviction for breaking into a house had the\n               prefix \"aggravated\" before it. Arlett Lomeli, another juror, who had worked\n               as a probation officer, explained to me and the other jurors that \"aggravated\"\n               meant that someone had been at home in the house at the time of the break-in.\n\n          8.   I relied upon and considered Arlett's explanation in determining that\n               Humberto Garza would be a danger in the future. It definitely influenced me\n               in determining Humberto Garza's future dangerousness.\n\n          9.   During the trial, I feared for my safety as a juror. I was worried that I would\n               be the victim of retaliation by a gang for my involvement with the trial.\n\n          10. I was the \"holdout juror\" during the sentencing phase. Eventually, I was the\n              only one who did not want to give a death sentence. I argued that Humberto\n              could change, that he could be rehabilitated.

However, said hearing had to be postponed because\nhabeas counsel for Applicant filed a motion to recuse you from\nfurther involvement in this case; 139th District Court Judge J.R.\n“Bobby” Flores, who was assigned to hear said motion, held a hear-\ning on June 16, 2014; and Judge Flores then took the matter under\nadvisement and asked each side to submit a memorandum of law.\n\n     On July 3, 2014, Judge Flores signed an order denying Appli-\ncant’s motion to recuse you from further involvement in this case.\n\n     Earlier today, I received an E-mail copy of a letter to you\nin which Ms. Sheard indicated that she will be filing a petition\nfor writ of mandamus and a motion for a stay of proceedings in the\ntrial court later today or tomorrow at the latest.\n\n     Despite this indication of Ms. Sheard’s intentions, the State\nbelieves that you should still re-schedule the evidentiary hearing\nfor the soonest available date, for several reasons.\n\f     First of all, the Court of Criminal Appeals may or may not\ngrant Applicant’s request for a stay of proceedings, should he\nseek such a stay.\n\n     Secondly, given the fact that the hearing was previously set\nfor June 9, 2014, and only delayed because of the intervening\nrecusal proceedings, neither side should have any difficulty being\nready to go forward with said hearing.\n\n     Third, setting this matter for a hearing as soon as possible\nwill demonstrate that the you, as the trial judge, and the parties\nare attempting to move this case along toward ultimate disposition\nas expeditiously as possible, despite the delay caused by the in-\nability to take any action while the recusal issue was pending.\nClearly, demonstrating this point is a major concern given the\ndeadline to resolve any outstanding issues in this case imposed by\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals’ April 7, 2014 order in this case.\n\n     In order to ensure her awareness of this communication, I\nhave E-mailed a copy of this letter to Applicant’s habeas coun-\nsel Hilary Sheard at Ms. Sheard’s E-mail address of HilarySheard\n@Hotmail.com. I have also mailed a follow-up copy of said item\nto Ms. Sheard addressed to Hilary Sheard, Attorney at Law, 7301\nBurnet Road # 102-328, Austin, Texas 78757.\n\n      Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n\n\nRespectfully,\n\n\nTHEODORE C. HAKE, Assistant\nCriminal District Attorney\nHidalgo County, Texas\n\n\nxc:   Hilary Sheard\n      Attorney at Law\n      7301 Burnet Road, #102-328\n      Austin, Texas 78757\n\f</pre>",
