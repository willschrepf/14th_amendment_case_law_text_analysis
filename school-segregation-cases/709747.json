Glick, appearing pro se, appeals the district court’s dismissal of\n\nhis 28 U.S.C. § 1983 action against Roy Romer and Aristedes W. Zavaras for\n\nviolation of his civil rights. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291 and affirm.\n\n\n\n      *\n         The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument\npursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and\njudgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case,\nres judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of\norders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the\nterms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\f      Appellant Glick’s complaint alleges the following facts. Appellant is a\n\nprisoner serving time in Arkansas after having been previously incarcerated in a\n\nColorado Department of Corrections (“CDOC”) facility. While incarcerated at\n\nthe facility, he was diagnosed with heart disease. In March 1998, he addressed a\n\nletter to Romer, with a carbon copy to Zavaras, complaining of his medical\n\ndifficulties, his living situation requiring him to climb two flights of stairs and\n\ninto and out of the top bunk in his cell, and a lack of adequate grievance\n\nprocedures. At some time thereafter he suffered a heart attack and relapse of a\n\nruptured disc. In April, he was assigned to an isolation cell in administrative\n\nsegregation. Several days later, he was transferred to an Arkansas prison without\n\nhis funds, personal property, or medical records.\n\n      In September 1998, Glick filed suit in United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Colorado against Romer, governor of the State of Colorado, and\n\nZavaras, executive director of CDOC, in their personal capacities, alleging\n\nviolations of his constitutional rights under 28 U.S.C. § 1983. Specifically, Glick\n\nclaimed defendants-appellees were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical\n\nneeds and retaliated against him by assigning him to administrative segregation\n\nand by transferring him to a prison facility in Arkansas without conducting a pre-\n\ntransfer hearing. In December 1998, he filed a motion for appointment of\n\ncounsel.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge, who denied\n\nGlick’s motion for appointment of counsel due to the insufficiently complex\n\nnature of the lawsuit, citing McCarthy v. Weinberg, 753 F.2d 836 (10th Cir.\n\n1985). The magistrate judge subsequently issued his recommendation to the\n\ndistrict court, determining pursuant to defendants’ motion that Glick’s action\n\nagainst Zavaras failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted and\n\ncounseling dismissal. The magistrate also issued an order requiring Glick to show\n\ncause why the case against Romer should not be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n4(m) for failure to effect service. Glick showed the magistrate a return receipt of\n\ncertified mail sent to Romer, who did not accept service by mail. The magistrate\n\nafterwards denied Glick’s motion to direct service of process, finding no\n\nallegations that Romer was personally involved in any actions or decision of\n\nwhich Glick complained, and recommended dismissal of his claim against Romer\n\nfor substantially the same reason. Glick filed timely objections to both\n\nrecommendations of dismissal. Adopting the magistrate’s recommendations, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the actions against both Zavaras and Romer, and this\n\nappeal followed. 1\n\n\n      1\n          We note appellees’ argument that Glick filed notice of appeal in untimely\nfashion under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1) because he filed within thirty days after the\ndistrict court dismissed the claim against Romer, but not within thirty days of the\ndismissal of the claim against Zavaras. Appellees ignore Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b),\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                        -3-\n\f      On appeal, Glick raises seven assignments of error: (1) the district court\n\nerred in holding Romer had not been properly served; (2) the district court erred\n\nin its determinations as to whether Zavaras was being sued in his personal or\n\nofficial capacity; (3) the court erred in holding Zavaras’s qualified immunity\n\nbarred Glick’s suit against him; (4) the court erred in holding Glick’s claims for\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief moot; (5) the court erred in finding Zavaras did\n\nnot personally participate in depriving him of his rights; (6) the court erred in\n\ndenying Glick appointed counsel; and (7) the court erred in determining Romer\n\nand Zavaras had not conspired to retaliate against him.\n\n      With regard Glick’s challenge to the court’s dismissal against Romer, “[w]e\n\nreview the district court’s dismissal for untimely service for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.” Espinoza v. United States, 52 F.3d 838, 840 (10th Cir. 1995) (citing\n\nJones v. Frank, 973 F.2d 872, 872 (10th Cir. 1992)). Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m)\n\nprovides a single exception to the 120-day time limit for service: “if the plaintiff\n\nshows good cause for the failure, the court may extend time to effect service.” In\n\nthe present case, the district court determined Glick had failed to timely serve\n\n\n\n      1\n       (...continued)\nwhich, in a suit involving multiple parties, mandates that the district court\nexpressly declare its order to be final if that order is issued before final orders\ninvolving the remaining parties to the suit. See Perington Wholesale, Inc. v.\nBurger King Corp., 631 F.2d 1369, 1370-71 n.2 (10th Cir. 1980). Thus, Glick’s\nappeal is timely.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fRomer and had failed to show good cause for that failure and, finding Glick had\n\nin no way demonstrated Romer’s involvement in the violations of which he\n\ncomplains, dismissed the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d). 2 The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in so finding and thereupon dismissing the\n\naction against Romer. See Espinoza, 52 F.3d at 838.\n\n      With respect to the court’s dismissal of Glick’s claims against Zavaras, we\n\nreview de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim for which relief can be\n\ngranted, “assess[ing] whether the plaintiff’s complaint alone is legally sufficient\n\nto state a claim.” Sutton v. Utah Sch. for the Deaf & Blind, 173 F.3d 1226, 1236\n\n(10th Cir. 1999) (quoting Miller v. Glanz, 948 F.2d 1562, 1565 (10th Cir. 1991)).\n\nWe accept “all well-pleaded allegations in the . . . complaint . . . as true” and\n\nview them “in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Id. (citing GFF\n\nCorp. v. Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 130 F.3d 1381, 1384 (10th Cir.\n\n1997)).\n\n      Construing Glick’s pro se pleadings liberally, as required under Haines v.\n\nKerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972), we read his briefs as alleging a deliberate\n\nindifference claim under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United\n\n\n      2\n         Although the district court cited Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) (providing for\ndismissal of actions without prejudice), it is clear from the court’s discussion of\nthe merits of the action and its citation to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) that its dismissal of\nthe action against Romer as frivolous was with prejudice. We so construe its\ndismissal. Cf. Brace v. O’Neill, 567 F.2d 237, 242 n.25a (3d Cir. 1977).\n\n                                         -5-\n\fStates. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics          ,\n\n403 U.S. 388, 397 (1971) (holding that a plaintiff can recover money damages for\n\ninjuries suffered as a result of a federal agent’s violation of her Fourth\n\nAmendment rights); see also Carlson v. Green , 446 U.S. 14, 20-23 (1980)\n\n(recognizing Bivens actions for alleged violation of Eighth Amendment rights).      3\n\n\n\nIt is undisputed that convicted inmates are protected from “deliberate\n\nindifference” to their “serious medical needs.”      Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. 97,\n\n104 (1976). To establish deliberate indifference, a prisoner must demonstrate\n\nmore than mere negligence.      See id. at 105-06.   Rather, Glick must show that\n\nRomer and Zavaras had a “sufficiently culpable state of mind,” meaning their\n\nacts or omissions arose from “deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.”\n\nFarmer v. Brennan , 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994) (internal quotations and citations\n\nomitted). “[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth\n\nAmendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the\n\nofficial knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health and safety.”\n\nId. at 837. In the present case, Glick has alleged no facts indicating knowledge\n\non the part of Romer and Zavaras of facts leading to an inference of “an\n\n\n\n       3\n        Glick alleges numerous constitutional violations as a result of\ndefendants-appellees’ failure to provide him with adequate medical care. These\nclaims are properly addressed under an Eighth Amendment analysis. See Estelle\nv. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).\n\n                                           -6-\n\fexcessive risk” to Glick’s “health and safety.”       Id. Thus, the district court\n\nproperly dismissed Glick’s claim of disregard of his serious medical needs.\n\n       Similarly, with regard to Glick’s claims that Romer and Zavaras retaliated\n\nagainst him and transferred him to Arkansas without a hearing, Glick must show\n\nthat Romer and Zavaras had a “sufficiently culpable state of mind” regarding the\n\nrisk of the unconstitutional actions taken against him.       See id. at 834. In the\n\npresent case, Glick has alleged no facts tending to show that Romer and Zavaras\n\nhad any knowledge whatsoever of the violations of which he complains, even if\n\nthey were colorable constitutional violations. Thus, the district court properly\n\ndeemed Glick’s claim against Romer frivolous under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) and\n\nproperly granted Zavaras’s motion to dismiss on this claim.\n\n       In conclusory fashion, Glick also alleges Zavaras conspired with Romer to\n\nviolate his rights. Even assuming Glick’s rights were violated, however, he\n\nalleges no facts tending to show how Zavaras and Romer conspired to violate\n\nthose rights. Again, he fails to allege facts tending to show actual knowledge on\n\ntheir part of the violations of which he complains.       See Farmer , 511 U.S. at 837.\n\n       Because we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Glick’s claims on the\n\npreceding grounds, we need not address his further claims of legal error on the\n\npart of district court.   See United States v. Sandoval , 29 F.3d 537, 542 n.6 (10th\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\f       Finally, “[w]e review the denial of appointment of counsel in a civil case\n\nfor an abuse of discretion.”    Rucks v. Boergermann , 57 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir.\n\n1995) (citing Shabazz v. Askins , 14 F.3d 533, 535 (10th Cir. 1994)). The district\n\ncourt may appoint counsel for an indigent plaintiff if, under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, the denial of counsel would result in a fundamentally unfair\n\nproceeding, see McCarthy v. Weinberg , 753 F.2d 836, 839-40 (10th Cir. 1985),\n\nconsidering the merits of the claims, the nature of the factual issues, the litigant’s\n\nability to present the claims, and the complexity of the legal issues,   see Rucks , 57\n\nF.3d at 979. In the present case, for the reasons discussed above, Glick’s claims\n\nare meritless. The court therefore did not abuse its discretion in refusing to\n\nappoint counsel in this case.\n\n       “If we dismiss as frivolous the appeal of an action the district court\n\ndismissed under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B), both dismissals count as strikes.” 4\n\nJennings v. Natrona County Detention Ctr. Med. Facility, 175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th\n\nCir. 1999). The district court correctly determined that Glick’s complaints\n\nagainst Romer and Zavaras were frivolous and did not state claims for which\n\nrelief could be granted, respectively, and its dismissals therefore fall under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) & (ii) (“the action . . . is frivolous” and “the action . . .\n\n\n\n       4\n        28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) was formerly codified as § 1915(d). See Washington\nv. Loving, No. 96-6192, 1997 WL 111259, at **1 n.3 (10th Cir. March 13, 1997).\n\n                                            -8-\n\ffails to state a claim for which relief may be granted”). Because this appeal\n\nlikewise lacks any arguable basis in law or fact, we deem it to be frivolous under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Glick incurs strikes one and two for purposes of 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1915(g). He is advised that if he incurs one more strike by filing further\n\nfrivolous suits or appeals, under the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act of 1995, he\n\nwill no longer be entitled to proceed in forma pauperis in a civil action in federal\n\ncourt—other than petitions for writ of habeas corpus—not involving “‘imminent\n\ndanger of serious physical injury.’” White v. Colorado, 157 F.3d 1226, 1232\n\n(10th Cir. 1998) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g)), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1150\n\n(1999).\n\n      We remind Glick of his continuing obligation to pay all installments of the\n\ndeferred district court and appellate filing fees until they are paid in full. No\n\nexception is made for dismissed appeals. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(2); Jennings,\n\n175 F.3d at 781.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n      The mandate shall issue forthwith.\n\n                                        ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                        Carlos F.

Appellant is a\n\nprisoner serving time in Arkansas after having been previously incarcerated in a\n\nColorado Department of Corrections (“CDOC”) facility. While incarcerated at\n\nthe facility, he was diagnosed with heart disease. In March 1998, he addressed a\n\nletter to Romer, with a carbon copy to Zavaras, complaining of his medical\n\ndifficulties, his living situation requiring him to climb two flights of stairs and\n\ninto and out of the top bunk in his cell, and a lack of adequate grievance\n\nprocedures.

In December 1998, he filed a motion for appointment of\n\ncounsel.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge, who denied\n\nGlick’s motion for appointment of counsel due to the insufficiently complex\n\nnature of the lawsuit, citing McCarthy v. Weinberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"447036\"><a href=\"/opinion/447036/emmett-ray-mccarthy-v-dr-f-weinberg-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir.\n\n1985). The magistrate judge subsequently issued his recommendation to the\n\ndistrict court, determining pursuant to defendants’ motion that Glick’s action\n\nagainst Zavaras failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted and\n\ncounseling dismissal. The magistrate also issued an order requiring Glick to show\n\ncause why the case against Romer should not be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n4(m) for failure to effect service. Glick showed the magistrate a return receipt of\n\ncertified mail sent to Romer, who did not accept service by mail. The magistrate\n\nafterwards denied Glick’s motion to direct service of process, finding no\n\nallegations that Romer was personally involved in any actions or decision of\n\nwhich Glick complained, and recommended dismissal of his claim against Romer\n\nfor substantially the same reason. Glick filed timely objections to both\n\nrecommendations of dismissal. Adopting the magistrate’s recommendations, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the actions against both Zavaras and Romer, and this\n\nappeal followed. 1\n\n\n      1\n          We note appellees’ argument that Glick filed notice of appeal in untimely\nfashion under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1) because he filed within thirty days after the\ndistrict court dismissed the claim against Romer, but not within thirty days of the\ndismissal of the claim against Zavaras. Appellees ignore Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b),\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                        -3-\n\f      On appeal, Glick raises seven assignments of error: (1) the district court\n\nerred in holding Romer had not been properly served; (2) the district court erred\n\nin its determinations as to whether Zavaras was being sued in his personal or\n\nofficial capacity; (3) the court erred in holding Zavaras’s qualified immunity\n\nbarred Glick’s suit against him; (4) the court erred in holding Glick’s claims for\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief moot; (5) the court erred in finding Zavaras did\n\nnot personally participate in depriving him of his rights; (6) the court erred in\n\ndenying Glick appointed counsel; and (7) the court erred in determining Romer\n\nand Zavaras had not conspired to retaliate against him.\n\n      With regard Glick’s challenge to the court’s dismissal against Romer, “[w]e\n\nreview the district court’s dismissal for untimely service for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.” Espinoza v.

To establish deliberate indifference, a prisoner must demonstrate\n\nmore than mere negligence.      See id. at 105-06.

Thus, the district court\n\nproperly dismissed Glick’s claim of disregard of his serious medical needs.\n\n       Similarly, with regard to Glick’s claims that Romer and Zavaras retaliated\n\nagainst him and transferred him to Arkansas without a hearing, Glick must show\n\nthat Romer and Zavaras had a “sufficiently culpable state of mind” regarding the\n\nrisk of the unconstitutional actions taken against him.       See id. at 834. In the\n\npresent case, Glick has alleged no facts tending to show that Romer and Zavaras\n\nhad any knowledge whatsoever of the violations of which he complains, even if\n\nthey were colorable constitutional violations. Thus, the district court properly\n\ndeemed Glick’s claim against Romer frivolous under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) and\n\nproperly granted Zavaras’s motion to dismiss on this claim.\n\n       In conclusory fashion, Glick also alleges Zavaras conspired with Romer to\n\nviolate his rights. Even assuming Glick’s rights were violated, however, he\n\nalleges no facts tending to show how Zavaras and Romer conspired to violate\n\nthose rights. Again, he fails to allege facts tending to show actual knowledge on\n\ntheir part of the violations of which he complains.       See Farmer , 511 U.S. at 837.\n\n       Because we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Glick’s claims on the\n\npreceding grounds, we need not address his further claims of legal error on the\n\npart of district court.
