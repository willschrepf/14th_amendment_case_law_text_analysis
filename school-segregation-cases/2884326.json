The District Court dismissed their\ncomplaint. On appeal, they assert that their allegations of\nplacement in restrictive confinement state valid substantive and\n\n\n                               2\n\fprocedural due process claims sufficient to survive a motion to\ndismiss. We agree, and remand the case to the District Court.\n\n                               I.\n\n        At the time of their complaint, Stevenson and Manley\nwere awaiting resentencing. Both had been convicted and\nsentenced to death in January 1997, but their sentences were\nvacated and remanded on or about May 30, 2001. At that time,\nthey were moved off death row, and into the Security Housing\nUnit (“SHU”). Stevenson was moved from the SHU to a less\nrestrictive pre-trial facility in December 2003, but was returned\nto the SHU in January 2004. Neither one of them received a\nhearing or explanation for their transfers into the SHU. They\nwere both subsequently re-sentenced to death on February 3,\n2006.\n\n        Jones was awaiting trial at the time of the complaint.\nFollowing a disruption at Gander Hill Prison in Wilmington,\nDelaware, he and several other inmates were moved to the SHU\non or about February 19, 2003. Jones asserts that, like Stevenson\nand Manley, he was not afforded an explanation or hearing\nregarding his transfer into more restrictive housing. He does,\nhowever, state that he was alleged to have been involved in the\nriot at Gander Hill. Jones was subsequently found guilty of first-\ndegree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment on September\n16, 2005.\n\n       The appellants seek relief in the form of a transfer back\n                                3\n\finto the general prison population, monetary damages, and the\nestablishment of a system of review for transfers of pretrial\ndetainees into the SHU.1\n\n        The Warden filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which was granted on December 7,\n2004. The District Court held that the detainees’ transfer out of\nthe general prison population into the SHU for nonpunitive\nreasons was within the scope of the prison officials’ authority\nwith respect to prison management. In its ruling, the District\nCourt relied upon Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995). The\nplaintiffs appealed from this order on January 4, 2005.2 Review\nof a dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is plenary.\nLake v. Arnold, 112 F.3d 682, 684-85 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n                               II.\n\n       Stevenson, Manley, and Jones present two arguments as\n\n\n   1\n    Stevenson and Manley are now on death row, and Warden\nCarroll indicates that Jones is now housed in the part of the SHU\nreserved for sentenced inmates. Accordingly, their request for\ninjunctive relief on the grounds that they are improperly\nconfined pretrial detainees is moot. The other two forms of relief\nthey seek continue to be viable.\n   2\n    The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1331. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291.\n                                4\n\fto why their complaint should have survived the motion to\ndismiss. First, they argue that they have sufficiently asserted a\nliberty interest in being free from punishment prior to imposition\nof sentence. Second, they assert that they should have been\nafforded notice of their transfer and an opportunity to respond.\nThe Warden disputes the sufficiency of their substantive and\nprocedural due process claims, arguing that they have made only\nconclusory allegations regarding punishment and have no\ncognizable liberty interest in being housed in the general prison\npopulation.\n\n        In support of his contention that the complaint made only\nconclusory statements regarding punishment, the Warden looks\nto Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 351-53 (3d Cir. 2005). The\nopinion in Evancho, however, offers the Warden no support.\nThe holding of Evancho is that the amended complaint of a state\nemployee filed against the state attorney general alleging\nviolations of the Pennsylvania Whistleblower Law and her civil\nrights failed to meet the liberal pleading requirement of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 8(a). Evancho admitted that she did not\nhave evidence of the involvement of one of her named\ndefendants. Id. at 350. The complaint here is significantly\ndifferent in that it does support a claim for substantive due\nprocess violations. As the Warden acknowledges, the complaint\nalleges that “Plaintiffs weren’t given an explanation for the\npunitive move.” This express reference to punishment is\nsupported by numerous references in the complaint to lengthy\nstays in isolation with prisoners who had disciplinary problems\nor who were in protective custody, and the imposition of\n                                5\n\fadditional hardships that are not shared by the general prison\npopulation. The reasonable inference from these factual\nallegations is that appellants were impermissibly punished.\nMarkowitz v. Northeast Land Co., 906 F.2d 100, 103 (3d Cir.\n1990) (“We accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint and\nall reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them.”).\nLiberal pleading dictates that, particularly in the context of a pro\nse complaint, such allegations be deemed sufficient. Erickson v.\nPardus, --- U.S. ---, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007); Gibbs v.\nRoman, 116 F.3d 83, 86 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n       To be sure, there are reasonable inferences apart from\npunishment that could be drawn from the complaint as\nexplanation for the appellants’ confinement. Jones notes that he\nwas alleged to have been a participant in a riot at the Gander\nHill detention facility. If this allegation is true, it is entirely\npossible that his relocation to the Smyrna facility’s SHU was for\ndisciplinary reasons rather than for impermissible retaliation or\npunishment. Likewise, Stevenson and Manley admit that they\nhad been sentenced to death, but that only their sentences had\nbeen vacated. Death sentences are available in Delaware only\nfor offenses of first-degree murder. See 11 DEL. CODE §§ 636,\n4209(a). Accordingly, the Warden’s assertion that Stevenson\nand Manley were housed in the SHU because they were charged\nwith violent offenses is also a legitimate inference to be drawn\nfrom the complaint. However, the fact that such inferences may\nbe drawn is proof that the dismissal was premature. The\nappellants have met their obligation to provide grounds for their\nentitlement to relief by presenting factual allegations sufficient\n                                 6\n\fto raise their right to relief above a speculative level. See, e.g.,\nBell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, --- U.S. ---, 127 S. Ct. 1955,\n1964-65 (2007).\n\n        The complaint also alleges sufficient facts to make out a\nclaim for relief based on procedural due process. In addition to\nthe list of deprivations the plaintiffs suffered, the complaint\nstates that they were not afforded “all the rights of normal pre-\ntrial [detainees],” and that the “standard practice at Delaware\nCorrectional Center” of returning those whose sentences had\nbeen vacated to the general prison population was not followed.\nThese allegations do not explicitly state the nature of the\nappellants’ alleged liberty interest, but they provide an adequate\nframework for the inquiry. See, e.g., Unger v. Nat’l Residents\nMatching Program, 928 F.2d 1392, 1402 (3d Cir. 1991)\n(requiring “facts in [the] complaint from which we could infer\nthat [plaintiff] had a liberty or property interest”).\n\n        The complaint details the differences between the\nconditions they encountered in the SHU and those encountered\nby regular pretrial detainees. It evinces the appellants’\ncontention that they were improperly housed in the SHU without\nexplanation or an opportunity to contest their placement. The\ncomplaint states that the appellants wrote to Warden Carroll and\nhis employees requesting an explanation for their confinement\nin the SHU, but received no response. The reasonable inference\nto be drawn from these allegations is that the appellants assert\na liberty interest in being free from punishment while awaiting\nsentencing and in not being held in the SHU indefinitely. The\n                                 7\n\fplaintiffs specifically requested relief in the form of “a system\nto inform inmates why they were put into isolation, who made\nthe decision to put them in isolation, and a chance to appeal the\ndecision to a non-partisan official.” They also requested that the\nprison “[m]ake procedural safeguards.” The allegations in the\ncomplaint sufficiently raise the appellants’ claim that their\nprocedural due process rights were violated.\n\n                               III.\n\n                               A.\n\n         Although both Stevenson and Manley had been convicted\nat the time of their complaint, they are classified as pretrial\ndetainees for purposes of our constitutional inquiry. See Cobb v.\nAytch, 643 F.2d 946, 962 (3d Cir. 1981) (“The right to remain\nat liberty continues until a court pronounces a judgment of\nsentence, although after a jury has pronounced a guilty verdict\nthe court may insist upon greater assurance that a defendant will\nsubmit to sentence.”); see also Fuentes v. Wagner, 206 F.3d\n335, 341 (3d Cir. 2000). Their initial sentences had been vacated\nand they were awaiting resentencing at the time of their\ncomplaint and for the duration during which they allege they\nwere subjected to due process violations. Jones was awaiting\ntrial at the time of the complaint. The Warden does not contest\nthe status of the appellants as pretrial detainees for purposes of\nthis appeal.\n\n                               B.\n                                8\n\f        With respect to the substantive due process claims of\npunishment, in Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court established\nthe principle that “under the Due Process Clause, a detainee may\nnot be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance\nwith due process of law.” 441 U.S. 520, 535-36 (1979). The Bell\nCourt mandated a pragmatic approach to determining what\nconstitutes punishment, and formulated the “reasonable\nrelationship” test for determining whether a restriction is\npunitive. Id. at 539 (“[I]f a particular condition or restriction of\npretrial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate\ngovernmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to\npunishment.’”). To aid courts in applying this test, the Bell\nopinion looked to the test in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372\nU.S. 144, 168-69 (1963) for factors that courts might use as\nguideposts in distinguishing restrictions that are punitive from\nthose that are not:\n\n       Whether the sanction involves an affirmative\n       disability or restraint, whether it has historically\n       been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes\n       into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its\n       operation will promote the traditional aims of\n       punishment–retribution and deterrence, whether\n       the behavior to which it applies is already a crime,\n       whether an alternative purpose to which it may\n       rationally be connected is assignable for it, and\n       whether it appears excessive in relation to the\n       alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the\n       inquiry....\n\n\n                                 9\n\fSee also Bell, 441 U.S. at 537-38. However, the Court cautioned\nthat “[a]bsent a showing of an expressed intent to punish on the\npart of detention facility officials, that determination generally\nwill turn on ‘whether an alternative purpose to which [the\nrestriction] may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and\nwhether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative\npurpose assigned [to it].’” Id. at 538 (quoting Kennedy, 372 U.S.\nat 168-69). Thus, “if a restriction or condition is not reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate goal–if it is arbitrary or purposeless–a\ncourt permissibly may infer that the purpose of the\ngovernmental action is punishment that may not constitutionally\nbe inflicted upon detainees qua detainees.” Id. at 539.3\n\n\n\n   3\n    In a footnote, the Court exhorted that\n\n       In determining whether restrictions or conditions\n       are reasonably related to the Government’s\n       interest in maintaining security and order and\n       operating the institution in a manageable fashion,\n       courts must heed our warning that “[s]uch\n       considerations are peculiarly within the province\n       and professional expertise of corrections officials,\n       and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the\n       record to indicate that the officials have\n       exaggerated their response to these\n       considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to\n       their expert judgment in such matters.”\n\nId. at 540 n.23 (citations omitted).\n                               10\n\f        Unconstitutional punishment typically includes both\nobjective and subjective components. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991), the objective\ncomponent requires an inquiry into whether “the deprivation\n[was] sufficiently serious” and the subjective component asks\nwhether “the officials act[ed] with a sufficiently culpable state\nof mind[.]” Id. at 298. The Supreme Court did not abandon this\nbipartite analysis in Bell, but rather allowed for an inference of\nmens rea where the restriction is arbitrary or purposeless, or\nwhere the restriction is excessive, even if it would accomplish\na legitimate governmental objective. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 538-\n39 & n.20. Thus, we agree with the summary of the holding of\nBell in Rapier v. Harris:\n\n       [A] particular measure amounts to punishment\n       when there is a showing of express intent to\n       punish on the part of detention facility officials,\n       when the restriction or condition is not rationally\n       related to a legitimate non-punitive government\n       purpose, or when the restriction is excessive in\n       light of that purpose.\n\n172 F.3d 999, 1005 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n       Because the District Court could not make either an\nobjective inquiry into the severity of the deprivations or a\nsubjective inquiry into the mental state of the officials at the\nmotion to dismiss stage, the dismissal was improper. One\nreasonable inference from the allegations in the complaint of\n\n                               11\n\fdisparate treatment of prisoners is that, at a minimum, the\nappellants’ confinement in the SHU was arbitrary. See id. at 304\n(allowing collective examination of conditions of confinement);\nsee also Bell, 441 U.S. at 542 (stating that confining pretrial\ndetainees “in such a manner as to cause them to endure genuine\nprivations and hardship over an extended period of time might\nraise serious questions under the Due Process Clause as to\nwhether those conditions amounted to punishment”). Stevenson\nand Manley assert that they were not treated in the same manner\nas other similarly situated inmates. Jones’ allegations suggest\nthat one of the other prisoners who was alleged to have been\ninvolved in the riot at Gander Hill was released from the SHU\nin July 2003, and two others were moved into the general prison\npopulation in August 2003. These allegations intimate a degree\nof as yet unexplained arbitrariness in the procedures regarding\nplacement in the SHU.\n\n        In evaluating a pretrial detainee’s claim of\nunconstitutional punishment, courts must examine the totality of\nthe circumstances within the institution. In Hubbard v. Taylor,\n399 F.3d 150 (3d Cir. 2005), we explained that “[o]ur inquiry\ninto whether given conditions constitute ‘punishment’ must\ntherefore consider the totality of circumstances within an\ninstitution.” Hubbard, 388 F.3d at 160. Appellants assert that, as\ncompared to the conditions for the general prison population,\nhousing in the SHU is significantly more restrictive. The\ncomplaint draws specific, item-by-item comparisons between\nthe restrictions in the SHU and those in the general prison\npopulation. The allegations in the complaint raise an inference\nof impermissible punishment that precludes granting a motion\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\fto dismiss and may warrant further discovery.4\n\n        When warranted, such discovery need not be extensive.\nIn situations such as this, where the allegations of punishment\nare coextensive with the allegations that form the basis for the\nprocedural due process claim, it will generally be sufficient for\nthe prison officials to submit affidavits to show that the\nclassification was appropriate based on reasonable prison\nmanagement concerns. While district courts have discretion to\nmanage their cases, such affidavits alone will often be adequate\nto resolve the punishment inquiry. Although the substantive and\n\n   4\n     The able District Judge erroneously relied upon Sandin v.\nConner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995) for the proposition that the\ninstitutional decision to place appellants in the SHU “is exactly\nthe type of decision the Supreme Court noted when it held that\nfederal courts should defer to prison officials with respect to\nmanaging the ‘ordinary incidents of prison life.’” Appellants’\npretrial detainee status necessitates a more nuanced approach.\nThe focus in Sandin was on state-created liberty interests\nregarding “freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding\nthe sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to\nprotection by the Due Process Clause of its own force, ...\nnonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at\n484 (emphasis added). The Court emphasized that its holding\nwas driven by “the range of confinement to be normally\nexpected for one serving an indeterminate term,” id. at 487, and\nthe “expected perimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of\nlaw,” id. at 485. Several courts of appeals, including this one,\nsubsequently concluded that “Sandin does not apply [to pretrial\ndetainees]. Sandin concerned punishment of a sentenced\nprisoner, and therefore required a completely different analysis.”\nFuentes, 206 F.3d at 342 n.9; see also Benjamin, 264 F.3d at\n188.\n                                13\n\fprocedural due process evaluations are distinct, a showing by\nthe prison officials that a restrictive housing assignment is\npredicated on a legitimate managerial concern and is therefore\nnot arbitrary or purposeless, will typically foreclose the\nsubstantive due process inquiry.\n\n                                 C.\n\n        Appellants assert that they were denied notice of their\ntransfer and an opportunity to respond. The Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly stated that “[t]he core of due process is the right to\nnotice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.” LaChance v.\nErickson, 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998). Appellants have\nsufficiently pled facts to show that they were housed in the\nrestrictive conditions of the SHU without any procedural\nprotections. Although pretrial detainees do not have a liberty\ninterest in being confined in the general prison population, they\ndo have a liberty interest in not being detained indefinitely in the\nSHU without explanation or review of their confinement. This\nresult is compelled by our holding in Shoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d\n140 (3d Cir. 2000). In our discussion in Shoats focusing on the\nliberty interests at stake, we explained that “we have no\ndifficulty concluding that eight years in administrative custody,\nwith no prospect of immediate release in the near future, is\n‘atypical’ in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id.\nat 144. Unlike appellants, Shoats was a sentenced inmate who\nreceived periodic review of his status, to which he was permitted\nto respond. Id. at 145-46. As explained above, the protections\ndue to sentenced inmates provide a floor for what pretrial\ndetainees may expect.\n\n      In determining what procedural protections are adequate,\nwe are guided by the tenet that “[d]ue process is flexible and\n\n                                14\n\fcalls for such procedural protections as the particular situation\ndemands. Accordingly, resolution of the issue whether ...\nadministrative procedures provided ... are constitutionally\nsufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private\ninterests that are affected.” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319,\n334 (1976) (citations omitted). Thus, the substantive liberty\nanalysis is integral to the inquiry into the process due. See, e.g.,\nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 560 (1974) (“Consideration\nof what procedures due process may require under any given set\nof circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise\nnature of the government function involved as well as of the\nprivate interest that has been affected by governmental action.”\n(citations omitted)); Benjamin v. Fraser, 264 F.3d 175, 190 (2d\nCir. 2001).\n\n        Taking into account both the private interests of the\ndetainees and the governmental function involved, it becomes\nclear that the process required for administrative transfers of\npretrial detainees need not be extensive. Detainees have a liberty\ninterest in not being subjected to punishment for the crime with\nwhich they have been charged until after they have been\nconvicted and sentenced, but the governmental interest in\nmaintaining prison security for the duration of their detention is\nsubstantial. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 540 (1979) (“The\nGovernment also has legitimate interests that stem from its need\nto manage the facility in which the individual is detained.”).\n\n       Prison officials must provide detainees who are\ntransferred into more restrictive housing for administrative\npurposes only an explanation of the reason for their transfer as\nwell as an opportunity to respond. This level of process\ncomports with the Supreme Court’s holding in Hewitt v. Helms,\n459 U.S. 460 (1983) that the removal of a sentenced inmate\n\n                                15\n\ffrom the general prison population and his transfer into\nadministrative segregation requires at least a minimal degree of\nprocess. The Court explained that “the Due Process Clause\nrequires only an informal nonadversary review of evidence ... in\norder to confine an inmate feared to be a threat to institutional\nsecurity to administrative segregation.” Id. at 474. This informal\nnonadversary review is satisfied when an inmate receives “some\nnotice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present\nhis views to the prison official charged with deciding whether to\ntransfer him to administrative segregation.” Id. at 476. The\nCourt further explained that “[t]he proceeding must occur within\na reasonable time following an inmate’s transfer....” Id. at 476\nn.8.\n\n        The degree of process required varies depending on the\nreason for the transfer, with greater process accorded to\nprisoners who are confined for disciplinary infractions than\nthose moved for purely administrative reasons. See Mathews,\n424 U.S. at 334. In Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974),\nthe Supreme Court held that “written notice of the charges must\nbe given to the disciplinary-action defendant in order to inform\nhim of the charges and to enable him to marshal the facts and\nprepare a defense,” and “there must be a ‘written statement by\nthe factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons’ for the\ndisciplinary action.” Id. at 564. As the Second Circuit has noted,\n“the procedures required by Wolff apply if the restraint on\nliberty is imposed for disciplinary reasons; if the restraint is for\n‘administrative’ purposes, the minimal procedures outlined in\nHewitt are all that is required.” Benjamin, 264 F.3d at 190; see\nalso Rapier v. Harris, 172 F.3d 999, 1005-06 (7th Cir. 1999).\nDue to the unique exigencies of prison management, and in\naccordance with Hewitt, the minimal exchange of paperwork our\nholding will occasion need not occur prior to the transfer of a\n\n                                16\n\fdetainee.\n\n        Jones’ complaint suggests that his transfer was\noccasioned by his alleged participation in a prison riot, which\nmay necessitate a higher level of procedure. Stevenson and\nManley allege only that they were transferred without\nexplanation. The Warden stated in an affidavit attached to his\nmemorandum in support of the motion to dismiss that Jones’\ntransfer to the SHU was due to the fact that he had “very serious\npending charges” and “a number of inmate disciplinary\ninfractions.” The Warden also stated that Stevenson and Manley\nwere housed in the SHU based on their “potential ... to again\nreceive a sentence of death.” Accordingly, the District Court\nshould examine the asserted purposes for appellants’ detentions,\nand determine whether sufficient process has been afforded.\n\n\n        In considering the asserted rationale for placing pretrial\ndetainees in restricted housing, courts should be mindful of our\npronouncement in Shoats: “Shoats could conceivably be held in\nadministrative custody merely because his prior crimes\nreasonably foreshadow future misconduct.” Shoats, 213 F.3d at\n146. This consideration is consistent with the Supreme Court’s\nemphasis on the principle that “we are unwilling to substitute\nour judgment on these difficult and sensitive matters of\ninstitutional administration and security for that of ‘the persons\nwho are actually charged with and trained in the running’ of\nsuch facilities.” Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 588 (1984)\n(quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 562).\n\n        In Bell, the Supreme Court instructed that if there is a\nreasonable relationship between the particular condition or\nrestriction of pretrial detention and a legitimate governmental\n\n                               17\n\fobjective, then that condition, “without more,” does not infringe\nupon a detainee’s constitutional rights. Bell, 441 U.S. 539. In\nthis case, at the motion to dismiss stage, it is not possible to\ndiscern whether the relationship between the appellants’\ndetention in the SHU and a legitimate governmental objective\nis reasonable. Such a determination may be properly made on a\nmotion for summary judgment, at which point the Warden must\ncome forward and demonstrate the governmental objective in\nquestion.\n\n                               IV.\n\n       Warden Carroll asserts that he is entitled to qualified\nimmunity on the grounds that even if the facts alleged show a\nviolation of a constitutional right, that right was not clearly\nestablished. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001) (“The\nrelevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is\nclearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable\nofficer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\nconfronted.”). The District Court dismissed the complaint on the\nmerits and therefore did not reach the issue of qualified\nimmunity. It is not necessary for us to resolve this question now.\nWe leave it to the District Court to consider qualified immunity\non remand.\n\n                               V.\n\n       Under the liberal construction of complaints afforded to\npro se prisoner plaintiffs, we find that the complaint challenges\nthe reasonable relationship of the appellants’ confinement to a\nlegitimate government objective and alleges impermissible\npunishment of pretrial detainees. The complaint alleges\ndeprivations suffered by the appellants and compares their living\n\n                               18\n\fconditions to those of the general prison population. The\nappellants asserted that they had sought, but been refused, an\nexplanation for their placement in the SHU. Accordingly, the\ncomplaint alleges sufficient facts to survive the motion to\ndismiss. We will vacate the dismissal of the complaint and\nremand the case to the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                             19\n\f",

The District Court dismissed their\ncomplaint. On appeal, they assert that their allegations of\nplacement in restrictive confinement state valid substantive and\n\n\n                               2\n\fprocedural due process claims sufficient to survive a motion to\ndismiss. We agree, and remand the case to the District Court.\n\n                               I.\n\n        At the time of their complaint, Stevenson and Manley\nwere awaiting resentencing. Both had been convicted and\nsentenced to death in January 1997, but their sentences were\nvacated and remanded on or about May 30, 2001. At that time,\nthey were moved off death row, and into the Security Housing\nUnit (“SHU”). Stevenson was moved from the SHU to a less\nrestrictive pre-trial facility in December 2003, but was returned\nto the SHU in January 2004. Neither one of them received a\nhearing or explanation for their transfers into the SHU. They\nwere both subsequently re-sentenced to death on February 3,\n2006.\n\n        Jones was awaiting trial at the time of the complaint.\nFollowing a disruption at Gander Hill Prison in Wilmington,\nDelaware, he and several other inmates were moved to the SHU\non or about February 19, 2003. Jones asserts that, like Stevenson\nand Manley, he was not afforded an explanation or hearing\nregarding his transfer into more restrictive housing. He does,\nhowever, state that he was alleged to have been involved in the\nriot at Gander Hill. Jones was subsequently found guilty of first-\ndegree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment on September\n16, 2005.\n\n       The appellants seek relief in the form of a transfer back\n                                3\n\finto the general prison population, monetary damages, and the\nestablishment of a system of review for transfers of pretrial\ndetainees into the SHU.1\n\n        The Warden filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which was granted on December 7,\n2004. The District Court held that the detainees’ transfer out of\nthe general prison population into the SHU for nonpunitive\nreasons was within the scope of the prison officials’ authority\nwith respect to prison management. In its ruling, the District\nCourt relied upon Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). The\nplaintiffs appealed from this order on January 4, 2005.2 Review\nof a dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is plenary.\nLake v. Arnold, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740235\"><a href=\"/opinion/740235/elizabeth-j-arnold-lake-justin-wilson-lake-husband-and-wife-v-frederick/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684-85 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n                               II.\n\n       Stevenson, Manley, and Jones present two arguments as\n\n\n   1\n    Stevenson and Manley are now on death row, and Warden\nCarroll indicates that Jones is now housed in the part of the SHU\nreserved for sentenced inmates. Accordingly, their request for\ninjunctive relief on the grounds that they are improperly\nconfined pretrial detainees is moot. The other two forms of relief\nthey seek continue to be viable.\n   2\n    The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1331. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291.\n                                4\n\fto why their complaint should have survived the motion to\ndismiss. First, they argue that they have sufficiently asserted a\nliberty interest in being free from punishment prior to imposition\nof sentence. Second, they assert that they should have been\nafforded notice of their transfer and an opportunity to respond.\nThe Warden disputes the sufficiency of their substantive and\nprocedural due process claims, arguing that they have made only\nconclusory allegations regarding punishment and have no\ncognizable liberty interest in being housed in the general prison\npopulation.\n\n        In support of his contention that the complaint made only\nconclusory statements regarding punishment, the Warden looks\nto Evancho v. Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791886\"><a href=\"/opinion/791886/karen-e-evancho-v-d-michael-fisher-attorney-general-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351-53 (3d Cir. 2005). The\nopinion in Evancho, however, offers the Warden no support.\nThe holding of Evancho is that the amended complaint of a state\nemployee filed against the state attorney general alleging\nviolations of the Pennsylvania Whistleblower Law and her civil\nrights failed to meet the liberal pleading requirement of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 8(a). Evancho admitted that she did not\nhave evidence of the involvement of one of her named\ndefendants. Id. at 350. The complaint here is significantly\ndifferent in that it does support a claim for substantive due\nprocess violations. As the Warden acknowledges, the complaint\nalleges that “Plaintiffs weren’t given an explanation for the\npunitive move.” This express reference to punishment is\nsupported by numerous references in the complaint to lengthy\nstays in isolation with prisoners who had disciplinary problems\nor who were in protective custody, and the imposition of\n                                5\n\fadditional hardships that are not shared by the general prison\npopulation. The reasonable inference from these factual\nallegations is that appellants were impermissibly punished.\nMarkowitz v. Northeast Land Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543601\"><a href=\"/opinion/543601/tobye-r-markowitz-individually-and-on-behalf-of-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (3d Cir.\n1990) (“We accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint and\nall reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them.”).\nLiberal pleading dictates that, particularly in the context of a pro\nse complaint, such allegations be deemed sufficient. Erickson v.\nPardus, --- U.S. ---, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145722\"><a href=\"/opinion/145722/erickson-v-pardus/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2200 (2007); Gibbs v.\nRoman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741917\"><a href=\"/opinion/741917/henry-gibbs-jr-v-ms-marcia-roman-sci-somerset-librarian-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n       To be sure, there are reasonable inferences apart from\npunishment that could be drawn from the complaint as\nexplanation for the appellants’ confinement. Jones notes that he\nwas alleged to have been a participant in a riot at the Gander\nHill detention facility. If this allegation is true, it is entirely\npossible that his relocation to the Smyrna facility’s SHU was for\ndisciplinary reasons rather than for impermissible retaliation or\npunishment. Likewise, Stevenson and Manley admit that they\nhad been sentenced to death, but that only their sentences had\nbeen vacated. Death sentences are available in Delaware only\nfor offenses of first-degree murder. See 11 DEL. CODE §§ 636,\n4209(a). Accordingly, the Warden’s assertion that Stevenson\nand Manley were housed in the SHU because they were charged\nwith violent offenses is also a legitimate inference to be drawn\nfrom the complaint. However, the fact that such inferences may\nbe drawn is proof that the dismissal was premature. The\nappellants have met their obligation to provide grounds for their\nentitlement to relief by presenting factual allegations sufficient\n                                 6\n\fto raise their right to relief above a speculative level. See, e.g.,\nBell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, --- U.S. ---, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1964-65 (2007).\n\n        The complaint also alleges sufficient facts to make out a\nclaim for relief based on procedural due process. In addition to\nthe list of deprivations the plaintiffs suffered, the complaint\nstates that they were not afforded “all the rights of normal pre-\ntrial [detainees],” and that the “standard practice at Delaware\nCorrectional Center” of returning those whose sentences had\nbeen vacated to the general prison population was not followed.\nThese allegations do not explicitly state the nature of the\nappellants’ alleged liberty interest, but they provide an adequate\nframework for the inquiry. See, e.g., Unger v. Nat’l Residents\nMatching Program, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557998\"><a href=\"/opinion/557998/lisa-d-unger-v-national-residents-matching-program-temple-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1392</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1402 (3d Cir. 1991)\n(requiring “facts in [the] complaint from which we could infer\nthat [plaintiff] had a liberty or property interest”).\n\n        The complaint details the differences between the\nconditions they encountered in the SHU and those encountered\nby regular pretrial detainees. It evinces the appellants’\ncontention that they were improperly housed in the SHU without\nexplanation or an opportunity to contest their placement. The\ncomplaint states that the appellants wrote to Warden Carroll and\nhis employees requesting an explanation for their confinement\nin the SHU, but received no response. The reasonable inference\nto be drawn from these allegations is that the appellants assert\na liberty interest in being free from punishment while awaiting\nsentencing and in not being held in the SHU indefinitely. The\n                                 7\n\fplaintiffs specifically requested relief in the form of “a system\nto inform inmates why they were put into isolation, who made\nthe decision to put them in isolation, and a chance to appeal the\ndecision to a non-partisan official.” They also requested that the\nprison “[m]ake procedural safeguards.” The allegations in the\ncomplaint sufficiently raise the appellants’ claim that their\nprocedural due process rights were violated.\n\n                               III.\n\n                               A.\n\n         Although both Stevenson and Manley had been convicted\nat the time of their complaint, they are classified as pretrial\ndetainees for purposes of our constitutional inquiry. See Cobb v.\nAytch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388186\"><a href=\"/opinion/388186/charles-cobb-james-s-glover-darrel-x-jackson-michael-jordan-gregory/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 962 (3d Cir. 1981) (“The right to remain\nat liberty continues until a court pronounces a judgment of\nsentence, although after a jury has pronounced a guilty verdict\nthe court may insist upon greater assurance that a defendant will\nsubmit to sentence.”); see also Fuentes v. Wagner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767972\"><a href=\"/opinion/767972/luis-fuentes-v-wagner-warden-konemann-correctional-officer-kleeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (3d Cir. 2000). Their initial sentences had been vacated\nand they were awaiting resentencing at the time of their\ncomplaint and for the duration during which they allege they\nwere subjected to due process violations. Jones was awaiting\ntrial at the time of the complaint. The Warden does not contest\nthe status of the appellants as pretrial detainees for purposes of\nthis appeal.\n\n                               B.\n                                8\n\f        With respect to the substantive due process claims of\npunishment, in Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court established\nthe principle that “under the Due Process Clause, a detainee may\nnot be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance\nwith due process of law.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535-36 (1979). The Bell\nCourt mandated a pragmatic approach to determining what\nconstitutes punishment, and formulated the “reasonable\nrelationship” test for determining whether a restriction is\npunitive. Id. at 539 (“[I]f a particular condition or restriction of\npretrial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate\ngovernmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to\npunishment.’”). To aid courts in applying this test, the Bell\nopinion looked to the test in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168-69 (1963) for factors that courts might use as\nguideposts in distinguishing restrictions that are punitive from\nthose that are not:\n\n       Whether the sanction involves an affirmative\n       disability or restraint, whether it has historically\n       been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes\n       into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its\n       operation will promote the traditional aims of\n       punishment–retribution and deterrence, whether\n       the behavior to which it applies is already a crime,\n       whether an alternative purpose to which it may\n       rationally be connected is assignable for it, and\n       whether it appears excessive in relation to the\n       alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the\n       inquiry....\n\n\n                                 9\n\fSee also Bell, 441 U.S. at 537-38. However, the Court cautioned\nthat “[a]bsent a showing of an expressed intent to punish on the\npart of detention facility officials, that determination generally\nwill turn on ‘whether an alternative purpose to which [the\nrestriction] may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and\nwhether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative\npurpose assigned [to it].’” Id. at 538 (quoting Kennedy, 372 U.S.\nat 168-69). Thus, “if a restriction or condition is not reasonably\nrelated to a legitimate goal–if it is arbitrary or purposeless–a\ncourt permissibly may infer that the purpose of the\ngovernmental action is punishment that may not constitutionally\nbe inflicted upon detainees qua detainees.” Id. at 539.3\n\n\n\n   3\n    In a footnote, the Court exhorted that\n\n       In determining whether restrictions or conditions\n       are reasonably related to the Government’s\n       interest in maintaining security and order and\n       operating the institution in a manageable fashion,\n       courts must heed our warning that “[s]uch\n       considerations are peculiarly within the province\n       and professional expertise of corrections officials,\n       and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the\n       record to indicate that the officials have\n       exaggerated their response to these\n       considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to\n       their expert judgment in such matters.”\n\nId. at 540 n.23 (citations omitted).\n                               10\n\f        Unconstitutional punishment typically includes both\nobjective and subjective components. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Wilson v. Seiter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), the objective\ncomponent requires an inquiry into whether “the deprivation\n[was] sufficiently serious” and the subjective component asks\nwhether “the officials act[ed] with a sufficiently culpable state\nof mind[.]” Id. at 298. The Supreme Court did not abandon this\nbipartite analysis in Bell, but rather allowed for an inference of\nmens rea where the restriction is arbitrary or purposeless, or\nwhere the restriction is excessive, even if it would accomplish\na legitimate governmental objective. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 538-\n39 & n.20. Thus, we agree with the summary of the holding of\nBell in Rapier v. Harris:\n\n       [A] particular measure amounts to punishment\n       when there is a showing of express intent to\n       punish on the part of detention facility officials,\n       when the restriction or condition is not rationally\n       related to a legitimate non-punitive government\n       purpose, or when the restriction is excessive in\n       light of that purpose.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763054\"><a href=\"/opinion/763054/ricky-j-rapier-v-sheriff-william-harris-jail-commander-jon-marvel/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1005 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n       Because the District Court could not make either an\nobjective inquiry into the severity of the deprivations or a\nsubjective inquiry into the mental state of the officials at the\nmotion to dismiss stage, the dismissal was improper. One\nreasonable inference from the allegations in the complaint of\n\n                               11\n\fdisparate treatment of prisoners is that, at a minimum, the\nappellants’ confinement in the SHU was arbitrary. See id. at 304\n(allowing collective examination of conditions of confinement);\nsee also Bell, 441 U.S. at 542 (stating that confining pretrial\ndetainees “in such a manner as to cause them to endure genuine\nprivations and hardship over an extended period of time might\nraise serious questions under the Due Process Clause as to\nwhether those conditions amounted to punishment”). Stevenson\nand Manley assert that they were not treated in the same manner\nas other similarly situated inmates. Jones’ allegations suggest\nthat one of the other prisoners who was alleged to have been\ninvolved in the riot at Gander Hill was released from the SHU\nin July 2003, and two others were moved into the general prison\npopulation in August 2003. These allegations intimate a degree\nof as yet unexplained arbitrariness in the procedures regarding\nplacement in the SHU.\n\n        In evaluating a pretrial detainee’s claim of\nunconstitutional punishment, courts must examine the totality of\nthe circumstances within the institution. In Hubbard v. Taylor,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789359\"><a href=\"/opinion/789359/gregory-hubbard-alvin-phillips-julian-payne-curtis-gibbs-gregory-j-bolling/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2005), we explained that “[o]ur inquiry\ninto whether given conditions constitute ‘punishment’ must\ntherefore consider the totality of circumstances within an\ninstitution.” Hubbard, 388 F.3d at 160. Appellants assert that, as\ncompared to the conditions for the general prison population,\nhousing in the SHU is significantly more restrictive. The\ncomplaint draws specific, item-by-item comparisons between\nthe restrictions in the SHU and those in the general prison\npopulation. The allegations in the complaint raise an inference\nof impermissible punishment that precludes granting a motion\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\fto dismiss and may warrant further discovery.4\n\n        When warranted, such discovery need not be extensive.\nIn situations such as this, where the allegations of punishment\nare coextensive with the allegations that form the basis for the\nprocedural due process claim, it will generally be sufficient for\nthe prison officials to submit affidavits to show that the\nclassification was appropriate based on reasonable prison\nmanagement concerns. While district courts have discretion to\nmanage their cases, such affidavits alone will often be adequate\nto resolve the punishment inquiry. Although the substantive and\n\n   4\n     The able District Judge erroneously relied upon Sandin v.\nConner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995) for the proposition that the\ninstitutional decision to place appellants in the SHU “is exactly\nthe type of decision the Supreme Court noted when it held that\nfederal courts should defer to prison officials with respect to\nmanaging the ‘ordinary incidents of prison life.’” Appellants’\npretrial detainee status necessitates a more nuanced approach.\nThe focus in Sandin was on state-created liberty interests\nregarding “freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding\nthe sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to\nprotection by the Due Process Clause of its own force, ...\nnonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at\n484 (emphasis added). The Court emphasized that its holding\nwas driven by “the range of confinement to be normally\nexpected for one serving an indeterminate term,” id. at 487, and\nthe “expected perimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of\nlaw,” id. at 485. Several courts of appeals, including this one,\nsubsequently concluded that “Sandin does not apply [to pretrial\ndetainees]. Sandin concerned punishment of a sentenced\nprisoner, and therefore required a completely different analysis.”\nFuentes, 206 F.3d at 342 n.9; see also Benjamin, 264 F.3d at\n188.\n                                13\n\fprocedural due process evaluations are distinct, a showing by\nthe prison officials that a restrictive housing assignment is\npredicated on a legitimate managerial concern and is therefore\nnot arbitrary or purposeless, will typically foreclose the\nsubstantive due process inquiry.\n\n                                 C.\n\n        Appellants assert that they were denied notice of their\ntransfer and an opportunity to respond. The Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly stated that “[t]he core of due process is the right to\nnotice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.” LaChance v.\nErickson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118163\"><a href=\"/opinion/118163/lachance-v-erickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266 (1998). Appellants have\nsufficiently pled facts to show that they were housed in the\nrestrictive conditions of the SHU without any procedural\nprotections. Although pretrial detainees do not have a liberty\ninterest in being confined in the general prison population, they\ndo have a liberty interest in not being detained indefinitely in the\nSHU without explanation or review of their confinement. This\nresult is compelled by our holding in Shoats v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768788\"><a href=\"/opinion/768788/russell-shoats-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-the-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2000). In our discussion in Shoats focusing on the\nliberty interests at stake, we explained that “we have no\ndifficulty concluding that eight years in administrative custody,\nwith no prospect of immediate release in the near future, is\n‘atypical’ in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id.\nat 144. Unlike appellants, Shoats was a sentenced inmate who\nreceived periodic review of his status, to which he was permitted\nto respond. Id. at 145-46. As explained above, the protections\ndue to sentenced inmates provide a floor for what pretrial\ndetainees may expect.\n\n      In determining what procedural protections are adequate,\nwe are guided by the tenet that “[d]ue process is flexible and\n\n                                14\n\fcalls for such procedural protections as the particular situation\ndemands. Accordingly, resolution of the issue whether ...\nadministrative procedures provided ... are constitutionally\nsufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private\ninterests that are affected.” Mathews v. Eldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n334 (1976) (citations omitted). Thus, the substantive liberty\nanalysis is integral to the inquiry into the process due. See, e.g.,\nWolff v. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 (1974) (“Consideration\nof what procedures due process may require under any given set\nof circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise\nnature of the government function involved as well as of the\nprivate interest that has been affected by governmental action.”\n(citations omitted)); Benjamin v. Fraser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774797\"><a href=\"/opinion/774797/james-benjamin-v-william-j-fraser-commissioner-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 (2d\nCir. 2001).\n\n        Taking into account both the private interests of the\ndetainees and the governmental function involved, it becomes\nclear that the process required for administrative transfers of\npretrial detainees need not be extensive. Detainees have a liberty\ninterest in not being subjected to punishment for the crime with\nwhich they have been charged until after they have been\nconvicted and sentenced, but the governmental interest in\nmaintaining prison security for the duration of their detention is\nsubstantial. Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (1979) (“The\nGovernment also has legitimate interests that stem from its need\nto manage the facility in which the individual is detained.”).\n\n       Prison officials must provide detainees who are\ntransferred into more restrictive housing for administrative\npurposes only an explanation of the reason for their transfer as\nwell as an opportunity to respond. This level of process\ncomports with the Supreme Court’s holding in Hewitt v. Helms,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983) that the removal of a sentenced inmate\n\n                                15\n\ffrom the general prison population and his transfer into\nadministrative segregation requires at least a minimal degree of\nprocess. The Court explained that “the Due Process Clause\nrequires only an informal nonadversary review of evidence ... in\norder to confine an inmate feared to be a threat to institutional\nsecurity to administrative segregation.” Id. at 474. This informal\nnonadversary review is satisfied when an inmate receives “some\nnotice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present\nhis views to the prison official charged with deciding whether to\ntransfer him to administrative segregation.” Id. at 476. The\nCourt further explained that “[t]he proceeding must occur within\na reasonable time following an inmate’s transfer....” Id. at 476\nn.8.\n\n        The degree of process required varies depending on the\nreason for the transfer, with greater process accorded to\nprisoners who are confined for disciplinary infractions than\nthose moved for purely administrative reasons. See Mathews,\n424 U.S. at 334. In Wolff v. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974),\nthe Supreme Court held that “written notice of the charges must\nbe given to the disciplinary-action defendant in order to inform\nhim of the charges and to enable him to marshal the facts and\nprepare a defense,” and “there must be a ‘written statement by\nthe factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons’ for the\ndisciplinary action.” Id. at 564. As the Second Circuit has noted,\n“the procedures required by Wolff apply if the restraint on\nliberty is imposed for disciplinary reasons; if the restraint is for\n‘administrative’ purposes, the minimal procedures outlined in\nHewitt are all that is required.” Benjamin, 264 F.3d at 190; see\nalso Rapier v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763054\"><a href=\"/opinion/763054/ricky-j-rapier-v-sheriff-william-harris-jail-commander-jon-marvel/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1005-06 (7th Cir. 1999).\nDue to the unique exigencies of prison management, and in\naccordance with Hewitt, the minimal exchange of paperwork our\nholding will occasion need not occur prior to the transfer of a\n\n                                16\n\fdetainee.\n\n        Jones’ complaint suggests that his transfer was\noccasioned by his alleged participation in a prison riot, which\nmay necessitate a higher level of procedure. Stevenson and\nManley allege only that they were transferred without\nexplanation. The Warden stated in an affidavit attached to his\nmemorandum in support of the motion to dismiss that Jones’\ntransfer to the SHU was due to the fact that he had “very serious\npending charges” and “a number of inmate disciplinary\ninfractions.” The Warden also stated that Stevenson and Manley\nwere housed in the SHU based on their “potential ... to again\nreceive a sentence of death.” Accordingly, the District Court\nshould examine the asserted purposes for appellants’ detentions,\nand determine whether sufficient process has been afforded.\n\n\n        In considering the asserted rationale for placing pretrial\ndetainees in restricted housing, courts should be mindful of our\npronouncement in Shoats: “Shoats could conceivably be held in\nadministrative custody merely because his prior crimes\nreasonably foreshadow future misconduct.” Shoats, 213 F.3d at\n146. This consideration is consistent with the Supreme Court’s\nemphasis on the principle that “we are unwilling to substitute\nour judgment on these difficult and sensitive matters of\ninstitutional administration and security for that of ‘the persons\nwho are actually charged with and trained in the running’ of\nsuch facilities.” Block v. Rutherford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111254\"><a href=\"/opinion/111254/block-v-rutherford/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588 (1984)\n(quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 562).\n\n        In Bell, the Supreme Court instructed that if there is a\nreasonable relationship between the particular condition or\nrestriction of pretrial detention and a legitimate governmental\n\n                               17\n\fobjective, then that condition, “without more,” does not infringe\nupon a detainee’s constitutional rights. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In\nthis case, at the motion to dismiss stage, it is not possible to\ndiscern whether the relationship between the appellants’\ndetention in the SHU and a legitimate governmental objective\nis reasonable. Such a determination may be properly made on a\nmotion for summary judgment, at which point the Warden must\ncome forward and demonstrate the governmental objective in\nquestion.\n\n                               IV.\n\n       Warden Carroll asserts that he is entitled to qualified\nimmunity on the grounds that even if the facts alleged show a\nviolation of a constitutional right, that right was not clearly\nestablished. Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (2001) (“The\nrelevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is\nclearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable\nofficer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he\nconfronted.”). The District Court dismissed the complaint on the\nmerits and therefore did not reach the issue of qualified\nimmunity. It is not necessary for us to resolve this question now.\nWe leave it to the District Court to consider qualified immunity\non remand.\n\n                               V.\n\n       Under the liberal construction of complaints afforded to\npro se prisoner plaintiffs, we find that the complaint challenges\nthe reasonable relationship of the appellants’ confinement to a\nlegitimate government objective and alleges impermissible\npunishment of pretrial detainees. The complaint alleges\ndeprivations suffered by the appellants and compares their living\n\n                               18\n\fconditions to those of the general prison population. The\nappellants asserted that they had sought, but been refused, an\nexplanation for their placement in the SHU. Accordingly, the\ncomplaint alleges sufficient facts to survive the motion to\ndismiss. We will vacate the dismissal of the complaint and\nremand the case to the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                             19\n\f</pre>",
