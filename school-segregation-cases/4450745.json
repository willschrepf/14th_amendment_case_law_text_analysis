Hooks, III as “Hooks.”\n\n                           STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nNature of the Case:              On November 16, 2006, Plaintiffs joined a pre-\n                                 existing lawsuit brought by several lessors.\n                                 Plaintiffs asserted several breach of oil and gas\n                                 lease claims as well as fraud in connection with oil\n                                 and gas leases located in Jefferson and Hardin\n                                 Counties. Later, that case was severed into three\n                                 actions, this Hooks action being one of them.\n                                 Several of the breach claims were decided on\n                                 motions for summary judgment and the remaining\n                                 claims were tried to a jury in November 2008.\n\nTrial Court:                     The Hon. Gary Sanderson in the 60th District\n                                 Court in Jefferson County.\nTrial Court Disposition:         The original judgment in this case was against\n                                 Samson for $21,749,376, plus attorneys’ and\n                                 expert witness fees, costs, (all totaling\n                                 $22,251,297). $20,081,638 of the judgment rested\n                                 on jury findings of fraud. Of that amount, nearly\n                                 $13 million was an 18% contractual “late charge”;\n                                 and around $3.5 million pertained to a well as to\n                                 which Hooks admitted he had not been defrauded.\n                                 The judgment also awarded damages for several\n                                 alleged breaches of Plaintiffs’ oil and gas leases,\n                                 adding $1,615,481 to the judgment. Those alleged\n                                 breaches included a favored nations claim, a claim\n                                 for additional payments based on incremental\n                                 formation production, and a claim Samson had\n                                 wrongfully “unpooled” a unit. The judgment also\n                                 awarded $52,257 to Plaintiffs for their ad valorem\n                                 tax payments.\n\n\n                                        xii\n\fCourt of Appeals:                This Court’s panel was composed of Justice Keyes\n                                 (authoring judge), joined by Justice Massengale\n                                 and with Justice Sharp, concurring and dissenting.\n                                 The panel decided this case in a published decision\n                                 after it was transferred to this Court on a docket\n                                 equalization order.

The Supreme Court\n                                 affirmed this Court’s judgment reversing the trial\n                                 court’s summary judgments on the incremental\n                                 formation production and “unpooling” issues. Id.\n                                 at 65, 66. That Court reversed this Court’s reversal\n                                 of the summary judgment on the favored nations\n                                 issue. Id. at 63. The Supreme Court also reversed\n                                 this Court’s rendition of judgment against\n                                 Plaintiffs as to Plaintiffs’ fraud claim based solely\n                                 on limitations barring that claim as a matter of law.\n                                 The Supreme Court remanded the fraud limitations\n                                 issue to this Court for further consideration of the\n                                 factual sufficiency of the jury’s limitations finding.\n                                 The Supreme Court also remanded for this Court\n                                 to consider the legal and factual sufficiency of the\n                                 fraud liability and damages issues. Id. at 61.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xiii\n\f              STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n      This case was previously briefed to this Court in 2009 and 2010 and orally\n\nargued in 2011. One of the judges of the original panel no longer serves on the Court.\n\nWhen this case was argued in 2011, a member of this Court stated this case was\n\npossibly the most complicated case then-pending before the First Court of Appeals.\n\n      The previous oral argument focused on issues no longer before the Court, such\n\nas whether Plaintiffs’ fraud claims were barred by limitations as a matter of law. The\n\nSupreme Court’s decisions against Samson were narrowly focused. As a result,\n\nvirtually all of Samson’s appellate points regarding the jury’s findings of fraud and\n\nfraud damages remain for determination by this Court. The remand also involves\n\nother issues including the most favored nations damages and interest charges. Oral\n\nargument would assist the Court in addressing issues that remain before the Court, as\n\ninformed by the Supreme Court’s opinion. Those issues remain complicated, and oral\n\nargument will assist the Court in addressing them. Furthermore, this case has always\n\nbeen factually complex, and remains so following this Court’s and the Supreme\n\nCourt’s prior opinion.\n\n      This case was transferred to this Court through docket equalization. Samson\n\nconsents to this Court conducting oral argument in Houston. Tex. Gov’t Code §\n\n73.003(b) (allowing parties to request transferee appellate court to conduct oral\n\nargument in the court’s regular location).\n\n\n                                             xiv\n\f                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nA.    Issues Involving Plaintiffs’ Fraud Claim\n      1.     Fraud\n\n      Plaintiffs sued Samson for fraud allegedly arising from Samson’s written\n\noffer to pool 50 acres out of one of Plaintiffs’ leases into a gas unit. The unit well\n\nwas not drilled on Plaintiffs’ tract; it was drilled on a different tract. Plaintiffs,\n\nacting through Mr. Charles G. Hooks III (“Hooks”), accepted Samson’s offer to\n\npool in 2001. PX156, 157.\n\n      Before Hooks accepted the offer, he requested a plat showing where\n\nPlaintiffs’ acreage would lie within the unit. Samson sent Hooks a scaled plat\n\ndepicting the lands and leases to be included in the unit.\n\n      That plat included several indications of where the bottom hole of the well\n\nwas located, including one Hooks interpreted to mean the bottom hole was 1400\n\nfeet from Plaintiffs’ lease. The plat actually said “1400´± Scaled.” Nearly eight\n\nyears later, Hooks testified he relied on the “1400´± Scaled” indication (while\n\nignoring other indications) when he consented to the pooling. Hooks claimed if he\n\nhad known the well’s bottom-hole was located closer than 1320 feet to Plaintiffs’\n\nlease line, he would not have agreed to the unit (the BSM1 unit), but would have\n\ndemanded that Samson comply with offset obligations set out in Plaintiffs’ oil and\n\ngas lease.\n\n\n                                          xv\n\f      There is no legally or factually sufficient evidence of fraud as to each of the\n\nfollowing:\n\n   a) fraud - misrepresentation – Hooks testified he relied on a measurement that\n\n      was indefinite on its face and on a scaled plat to determine whether a well’s\n\n      bottom hole was within 1320 feet of Plaintiffs’ lease line.\n\n   b) fraud - reliance - Hooks read “1400´± Scaled” to mean exactly 1400 feet.\n\n   c) fraud - intent to deceive - There is no evidence Hooks told Samson why he\n\n      wanted the plat or that he wanted a plat to answer his unstated question\n\n      about the proximity between a well’s bottom hole and Plaintiffs’ lease line.\n\n   d) fraud - duty to disclose – There was no fiduciary or confidential relationship\n\n      between Samson and the Plaintiffs, no continued reliance by Plaintiffs on the\n\n      plat, no knowledge by Samson that Plaintiffs might be relying on the plat in\n\n      this way, and Plaintiffs could have found the precise location of the bottom\n\n      hole by consulting public records.\n\n   e) statutory fraud - There was no “sale” of land but only a consent by\n\n      Plaintiffs to pooling, and the evidence underlying the jury’s finding of\n\n      statutory fraud has the same misrepresentation, reliance, and intent\n\n      insufficiencies as the evidence underlying the common law fraud finding.\n\n      Since statutory fraud fails, the judgment’s award of expert witness fees and\n\n      deposition costs should be reversed.\n\n\n                                         xvi\n\f      2.     Statute of Limitations for Fraud\n\n      Hooks and his wife executed the pooling agreement that is the subject of\n\nPlaintiffs’ fraud claim in May 2001. Plaintiffs did not file any lawsuit against\n\nSamson until November 2006 and did not amend to assert fraud claims until May\n\n2007. There were multiple publicly-filed records from which Plaintiffs could have\n\ndiscovered their alleged fraud claim at least by February 2003, and some of those\n\nrecords were in the official land records of both Jefferson and Hardin Counties. At\n\ntrial, the jury found that, had Plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence, they could\n\nnot have discovered their fraud claim until April 2007. Hooks’ testimony on that\n\nsubject was nothing more than the simple statement that he did not learn of the\n\nclaim until during discovery in the lawsuit during the Spring of 2007.\n\n      There is factually insufficient evidence that:\n\n   a) Plaintiffs could not have discovered the alleged fraud in the exercise of\n\n      reasonable diligence prior to four years before they filed suit for fraud.\n\n   b) Plaintiffs could not have discovered the alleged fraud by exercising\n\n      reasonable diligence prior to April 2007.\n\n      3.     Fraud Damages\n      Plaintiffs originally pleaded this action as one for breach of an oil and gas\n\nlease. They pleaded that Samson did not pay compensatory royalty on production\n\nfrom Samson’s wells on adjacent leases and units, which they claimed were\n\n\n                                         xvii\n\fbottomed within 1320 feet of their Jefferson County lease line. Plaintiffs also\n\npleaded fraud in the alternative. The trial court rendered summary judgment\n\nagainst Plaintiffs on their breach of lease compensatory royalty claim. Plaintiffs\n\nthen tried their alleged fraud claim to the jury, but Plaintiffs introduced no\n\nevidence of fraud damages and did not seek to set aside their written consent to the\n\npooled unit. Plaintiffs’ damages evidence was (i) based on exactly the same\n\ncalculation as their breach of lease claim for compensatory royalties, (ii) calculated\n\nas if their fraud claim were a breach of lease claim, and (iii) as if their consent to\n\njoin the unit did not exist. The damages also included (i) contractual late fees\n\n(prejudgment interest) compounded monthly at 18% (ii) damages attributable to\n\nanother well as to which Hooks admitted there was no fraud; and (iii) incremental\n\nformation production damages later found by this Court and the Supreme Court to\n\nhave been improper.\n\n      There is legally and factually insufficient evidence of damages when\n\n   a. Plaintiffs’ evidence was not of fraud damages, but was of only breach of\n\n      lease damages.\n\n   b. Plaintiffs’ damages questions sought measures of special damages for which\n\n      they had not pleaded and to which they were not entitled as a measure of\n\n      out-of-pocket fraud damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xviii\n\f     c. Plaintiffs did not seek or obtain an order setting aside their written consent\n\n        to the pooled unit, but presented evidence of damages as if their land was\n\n        never a part of the pooled unit while continuing to accept payments based on\n\n        their continued inclusion in the unit.\n\n     d. The fraud damages awarded by the jury include compensatory damages for\n\n        another well as to which Plaintiffs admit there was no fraud.\n\n     e. The damages include a prejudgment interest rate of 18%, rather than 5%,\n\n        and interest was compounded monthly when it should be simple.\n\n     f. The damages included incremental formation production damages even\n\n        though Plaintiffs’ formation production claim has been reversed by this\n\n        Court and the Supreme Court and rendered against Plaintiffs on appeal.\n\n     g. As of the time of trial (and continuing through today), Plaintiffs continued to\n\n        accept payments from Samson as if Plaintiffs were still a part of the unit.\n\n        The fraud damages must be recalculated to take these payments into\n\n        account.\n\nB.      Issues Involving Plaintiffs’ Most Favored Nations Claim\n        The Supreme Court reversed this Court’s judgment with respect to\n\nPlaintiffs’ most favored nations (“favored nations”) claim, holding Plaintiffs were\n\ndue an increased royalty rate of 28.28896% (rather than the lease rate of 25%) for\n\nproduction attributable to Plaintiffs’ three leases to Samson. The favored nations\n\n\n                                           xix\n\fdamages awarded Plaintiffs in the judgment were based on a stipulation between\n\nthe parties. Court Ex A. The stipulation set out favored nations damages sums with\n\nand without incremental formation production included. Both this Court and the\n\nSupreme Court reversed Plaintiffs’ judgment for incremental formation production\n\ndamages. As awarded in the original judgment, the favored nations damages\n\ninclude the substantial amounts attributable to the incremental formation\n\nproduction claims. Furthermore, the damages only go through May 2008.\n\n       The fraud damages for the wells included in the BSM1 unit incorporated\n\nfavored nations amounts for those wells in the fraud damages. Should this Court\n\nagain reverse the fraud portion of the original judgment, Plaintiffs will seek an\n\nincreased royalty percentage for production attributable to production from the\n\nwells in that unit.\n\n       This Court must remand the favored nations damages for recalculation:\n\n   a. The original judgment’s favored nations damages include incremental\n\n       formation production damages, although Plaintiffs’ incremental formation\n\n       production claim has now been reversed by this Court and the Supreme\n\n       Court.\n\n   b. Assuming reversal of any of the jury’s fraud liability, limitations, or\n\n       damages findings, Plaintiffs’ favored nations increased royalty interest in\n\n       production from the BSM1 unit will need to be calculated and awarded.\n\n\n                                        xx\n\fc. Any prejudgment interest awarded on the favored nations damages must be\n\n  simple interest, not compounded monthly as Plaintiffs originally sought on\n\n  all their damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                  xxi\n\f                                 CASE HISTORY\n      This case returns to this Court following this Court’s reversal of the\n\njudgment below (except for an agreed-upon amount for ad valorem taxes) and the\n\nSupreme Court’s partial reversal, partial affirmance, and remand of this Court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n      The original judgment in this case was against Samson for $21,749,376.15,\n\nplus attorneys’ and expert witness fees, costs, and post-judgment interest at the rate\n\nof 18%. Samson Lone Star, Ltd. P’ship v. Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409, 440 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012), rev’d in part, aff’d in part and remanded, 457\n\nS.W.3d 52 (Tex. 2015). The judgment arose from an oil and gas case involving\n\nallegations of fraud and breach of lease. $20,081,638 of the judgment’s total award\n\nrested solely on jury findings of fraud. Of the fraud damages, $12,995,832\n\nconsisted of an 18% contractual “late charge”; $3,547,241 pertained to the one\n\nwell (the BSM1 well) about which Plaintiffs complained at trial; and $3,538,565\n\npertained to another well as to which Hooks admitted he was not defrauded. In\n\naddition, Plaintiffs’ evidence of alleged fraud damages were based on the\n\nassumption Plaintiffs would win all their breach of lease claims, including their\n\nclaim for payments based on incremental formation production (“formation\n\nproduction”). As a result, the fraud damages have certain contractual lease claims\n\nincluded within those damages, even though those claims have been reversed.\n\n\n                                          1\n\f         The breach of lease claims—in addition to their inclusion in the fraud\n\ndamages—separately added another $1,667,738 to the judgment. Those breach\n\nallegations included $848,854 for increased payments under a favored nations\n\nprovision, $766,626 for additional payments under a claim that Samson had\n\nwrongfully “unpooled” a unit, and $52,257 for damages related to ad valorem\n\ntaxes.\n\n         The claims, this Court’s actions, and the Supreme Court’s actions are\n\nsummarized below:\n\nA.       Fraud\n         Plaintiffs asserted that had Hooks known the true bottom-hole location of the\n\nwell drilled on the adjacent tract, he would not have agreed to include his Jefferson\n\nCounty lease within a unit (the Black Stone Minerals No.1 “BSM1” unit) and,\n\ninstead, would have demanded compensatory royalties—one of the contractual\n\nremedies provided by Plaintiffs’ lease. This Court reversed the fraud portion of the\n\njudgment because it found, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs’ fraud claims were barred\n\nby limitations. This Court concluded Plaintiffs could have discovered the adjacent\n\nwell’s location from a directional survey filed in public Railroad Commission\n\nrecords. 389 S.W.3d at 428-30.\n\n         With regard to fraud, the Supreme Court held and ordered:\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f• Noting the allegedly-fraudulent plat that was the basis for Plaintiffs’ fraud claim\n\n     was also filed in Railroad Commission records attached to a P-12 pooling\n\n     authorization form, the Supreme Court held: “when the defendant’s fraudulent\n\n     misrepresentations extend to the Railroad Commission record itself, earlier\n\n     inconsistent filings cannot be used to establish, as a matter of law, that\n\n     reasonable diligence was not exercised.”      457 S.W.3d at 61. The Court\n\n     continued: “Under these circumstances, reasonable diligence remains a fact\n\n     question.” Id.\n\n• Based on its limitations ruling, the Supreme Court remanded for this Court’s\n\n     consideration “the factual and legal sufficiency of the evidence with regard to\n\n     common-law fraud, statutory fraud, and damages for fraud, as well as the\n\n     factual sufficiency of the evidence regarding when Hooks, by the exercise of\n\n     reasonable diligence, would have discovered the fraud.” Id.\n\nB.      Breach of Lease Claims\n        Three breach of lease claims decided against Samson were a part of\n\nSamson’s previous appeal to this Court. The claims and the Supreme Court’s\n\nactions on those claims are:\n\n        1.    Most Favored Nations\n        Plaintiffs’ leases to Samson contain a “most favored nations” clause\n\nrequiring Samson to pay Plaintiffs the same royalty percentage Samson pays a\n\n\n                                          3\n\fthird party should Samson enter into a lease (within a 3-mile radius of Plaintiffs’\n\npremises) with a royalty exceeding 25%. 389 S.W.3d at 434. Samson entered into a\n\npooling agreement with the State in which Samson paid the State an increased\n\nallocation of unit production as consideration for the State’s approval of a unit. The\n\nSupreme Court noted the increased allocation of production was equal to a royalty\n\nincrease from 25% to 28.28896%. 457 S.W.3d at 62. This Court reversed the\n\nfavored nations judgment because Samson did not enter into a new “lease” with the\n\nState, but entered into a settlement agreement called a “pooling agreement.” 389\n\nS.W.3d at 435. The Supreme Court reversed, holding the payment to the State\n\nmeant “Samson increased the State's 25% royalty on production from its tract to\n\n28.28896%” and “the royalty imposed by the Pooling Agreement is ‘payable\n\nunder’ the lease….” 457 S.W.3d 52 at 63. The Supreme Court concluded “the\n\ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Samson did not breach the most-favored\n\nnations clause.” Id.\n\n      The judgment lists “Damages for breach of Most Favored Nations Clause”\n\nof $848,854.01. 1Supp2dCR:6. That amount is attributable to two wells: the Joyce\n\nDuJay No.1 and the Joyce DuJay “A” No.1 wells. But that amount is composed of\n\n(i) $431.450.71 of damages for both wells plus prejudgment interest (contractual\n\n“late charges” calculated at 18 percent compounded monthly) resulting from the\n\nfavored nations increased royalty decimal of 3.28896%; plus (ii) $417,403.30 of\n\n\n                                          4\n\fbase damages and interest (“late charges”) for both wells attributable to formation\n\nproduction damages. Court Ex A.\n\n      2.    Incremental Formation Production.\n\n      Plaintiffs claimed Samson was required to pay royalty based on all liquid\n\ncondensate, and—on top of that—was required to pay royalty based on that same\n\ncondensate production again as if the condensate were produced as a gas. 389\n\nS.W.3d at 435-37; 457 S.W.3d at 63-65. Plaintiffs’ claims were based on a lease\n\nterm stating, “all such [royalty] calculations shall be based on formation\n\nproduction as reported on Texas Railroad Commission forms P-1 and P-2.” 457\n\nS.W.3d at 63. This Court held the formation production clause “does not operate to\n\ndouble the amount of royalties owed on the liquid condensate produced from the\n\nwell.” 389 S.W.3d at 437. This Court reversed the summary judgment in Plaintiffs’\n\nfavor and rendered judgment in Samson’s favor on that issue. Id. at 437, 440-41.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed on this issue, agreeing with this Court’s “decision\n\nwith regard to the formation-production claims.” 457 S.W.3d at 65.\n\n      Because of the disposition of this issue, any final judgment entered in this\n\ncase cannot include amounts for formation production. But both the alleged fraud\n\ndamages and the favored nations damages include formation production damages.\n\nFor fraud, the jury awarded and the judgment granted damages of $20,081,638,\n\nwhich precisely matched the damages Plaintiffs’ expert set out in his fraud\n\n\n                                        5\n\fdamages exhibit, PX608. 1Supp2dCR:6; 19CR:3268. That exhibit is titled,\n\n“Summary of Lost Compensatory Royalty with Incremental Formation\n\nProduction….” PX608 (emphasis added). Thus, the damages awarded for fraud\n\ninclude formation production damages (as does favored nations damages), which\n\ncannot be a part of any judgment.\n\n      3.     Unpooling\n\n      Plaintiffs’ third breach of lease claim was that Samson allegedly wrongfully\n\n“unpooled” a pooled unit by amending it. As the Supreme Court noted, “[b]ecause\n\nthe owner of 87.5% of the mineral interest in the tract where the well in this unit\n\nwas located refused to pool, Samson decided to ‘amend’ the unit designation.” 457\n\nS.W.3d at 65. Samson notified Hooks of the amendment and Plaintiffs accepted the\n\npayments made to them from the amended unit. Id. This Court held that under the\n\ncircumstances of this case, “Hooks accepted and ratified the amendment and\n\nredesignation of the units.” 389 S.W.3d at 434. The Supreme Court affirmed this\n\nCourt’s unpooling judgment, holding: “[b]ecause of the undisputed contents of the\n\nnotice letter, Hooks' acceptance of royalties for the new unit, and Hooks' refusal to\n\nchallenge the new unit, we decide the question of ratification as a matter of law.”\n\n457 S.W.3d at 66. Because of the disposition of this issue, there is nothing left for\n\nthis Court to consider with regard to “unpooling,” and any final judgment entered\n\nin this case cannot include “unpooling” damages.\n\n\n                                         6\n\fC.    Post-Judgment Interest\n      The trial court’s judgment imposed post-judgment interest at the rate of 18%\n\ncompounded annually. Because the only remaining portion of the judgment after\n\nthe appeal to this Court was for ad valorem taxes—the subject of a trial stipulation\n\nbetween the parties—this Court held the proper post-judgment interest rate was\n\n5%, rather than 18%. 389 S.W.3d at 439. The Supreme Court held the “leases only\n\nimpose ‘the maximum [interest] rate allowed by law’ for past-due royalties.” 457\n\nS.W.3d at 69 (emphasis added). Accordingly, to the extent Hooks ultimately\n\n“recovers for past due royalties, he is entitled to an 18% interest rate” but “[f]or\n\nother recoveries, the statutory rate of 5% applies….” 457 S.W.3d at 70.\n\nD.    Attorneys’ Fees\n      The trial court’s judgment awarded attorneys’ fees in accordance with a\n\nstipulation between the parties. Following the reversal of all claims on appeal\n\n(leaving only the agreed-upon ad valorem tax amounts to be paid by Samson), this\n\nCourt also reversed the attorneys’ fees award. 389 S.W.3d at 438. The Supreme\n\nCourt, however, held Plaintiffs were entitled to recover on their favored nations\n\nclaims, thus entitling them to the stipulated amounts of attorneys’ fees. 457 S.W.3d\n\nat 69. The fees were $300,000 through trial and another $70,000 through all\n\nappeals. 18CR:3166.\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fE.     Hooks’ Cross-Appeal\n       Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal challenging a summary judgment denying their\n\nclaims that Samson had supposedly breached offset obligations concerning\n\nPlaintiffs’ two leases in Hardin County, north of the lease at issue on the fraud\n\nclaim. This Court affirmed that summary judgment based on Samson’s limitations\n\ndefense. The Supreme Court reversed this Court’s affirmance because it disagreed\n\nthe claims were entirely barred by limitations. 457 S.W.3d at 68-69. That portion\n\nof the case has also been remanded for this Court’s consideration of “the merits of\n\nHooks’ claim for breach of the offset provisions and the proper construction of”\n\nthe clause at issue. Id. at 69.\n\n       In their cross-appeal, Plaintiffs asserted their offset obligation that applied\n\nwhen a well was drilled on lands “not more than … 1320´ from the leased\n\npremises” applied even when a well was drilled much farther than 1320 feet from\n\nPlaintiffs’ leased premises. Plaintiffs’ theory is based on a common provision in\n\nTexas oil and gas leases stating operations on pooled units\n\n       …shall be considered as operations for drilling on or production of\n       gas from the Leased Premises, whether or not the well or wells be\n       located on the Leased Premises, and the entire acreage constituting\n       such unit or units shall be treated for all purposes, except the payment\n       of royalties on production from the pooled unit, as if the same were\n       included in this Lease. [PX26¶V(E), PX27¶V(E).]\n\n       Plaintiffs assert this provision means all their lease terms (and the terms of\n\nany other lease with such a provision) are spread to the entire unit so that if a well\n\n                                          8\n\fis drilled within 1320 feet of any unit line (as opposed to a lease line as the lease\n\nsays), Samson owes offset obligations to Plaintiffs even though the well is not\n\nwithin 1320 feet of their lease. Moreover, Samson did in fact offset the wells at\n\nissue in Plaintiffs’ cross-appeal and Plaintiffs failed to provide notice to Samson of\n\nSamson’s alleged default.\n\n        Because these offset obligation claims are the subject of Hooks’ cross-\n\nappeal, Samson will address these claims in its response to Hooks’ supplemental\n\nbrief on this subject.\n\nF.      Samson’s Appeal Issues on Remand\n        As a result of the Supreme Court’s decision, the issues raised by Samson in\n\nits appeal that were remanded for this Court’s consideration are:\n\n     1. Legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting common law fraud;\n\n     2. Legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting statutory fraud;\n\n     3. Legal and factual sufficiency of the fraud damages, along with a remand for\n\n        a reduction and recalculation of the fraud damages, including attendant\n\n        prejudgment and post-judgment interest issues;\n\n     4. Factual sufficiency of the jury’s finding on limitations;\n\n     5. Remand for recalculation of favored nations damages owed to Plaintiffs,\n\n        with consideration of interest issues including whether Plaintiffs are entitled\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f      to 18% prejudgment interest compounded monthly, as they requested during\n\n      the first trial.\n\n                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA.    Hooks Was a Very Experienced Oil and Gas Attorney\n      Hooks was an attorney with extensive experience in oil and gas matters.\n\n13RR:9. For 33 years, in addition to practicing law, Hooks managed his family’s\n\nconsiderable investments in oil, gas and mineral estates. 13RR:9-10. Plaintiffs\n\nowned properties in Louisiana and 36 Texas counties. 13RR:11. Hooks has\n\nnegotiated at least 100 oil and gas leases. 13RR:10-11.\n\n      Samson holds three separate oil and gas leases from Plaintiffs:\n\n      (1) 640 acres in Jefferson County (PX25) (called the “Jefferson County\n      lease”). Fifty acres from the southwest corner of this lease is the land at issue\n      in Plaintiffs’ fraud claims.\n      (2) 95 acres in Hardin County (PX26).\n      (3) 10 acres in Hardin County (PX27).\n      The primary issue at trial was Plaintiffs’ fraud claim. Plaintiffs were co-\n\ntenants in the mineral estate on the Jefferson County lease. 12RR:46-47, 13RR:26-\n\n27. Plaintiffs own 42.75% of the minerals in that tract; another extended family\n\nwhom Samson called “the Broussards,” owned the remaining 57.25% of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fminerals. PX25; 12RR:46-47, 13RR:26-27. Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease did\n\nnot grant authority to pool. PX25¶V(E).1\n\nB.     Samson Drilled the Black Stone Minerals No. 1 Gas Well\n       In April 2000, Samson began drilling the Black Stone Minerals No. 1 Gas\n\n(“BSM1”) well in the Walker Pettitt Survey in Hardin County. That survey lies\n\nimmediately west of the Pine Island Bayou, which is the Hardin/Jefferson County\n\nline. The bayou forms the western boundary of Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease\n\nand the 50 acres included in the BSM1 unit. PX25; PX569. The BSM1 well was\n\ncompleted in August 2000; first gas sales occurred October 2000. PX569, 627. The\n\nwell was drilled as a directional well in accordance with Railroad Commission\n\nrules. The bottom of the hole was drilled to a location southeast of the surface\n\nlocation. 11RR:122-24; 8 H. WILLIAMS & C. MEYERS, OIL                      AND    GAS LAW 264\n\n(2008) (directional drilling is “[t]he drilling of a well that departs materially from\n\nthe vertical,” frequently because of surface conditions). As reported in public\n\nrecords, the BSM1 well was originally planned with a bottom hole 1080 feet (i.e.,\n\nwithin 1320 feet) from Plaintiffs’ lease line. PX616; 12RR:48-49.\n\nC.     The Jefferson County Lease Contained Offset Obligations\n       Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease provided if the leased lands were not\n\npooled, and a gas well was drilled within 1320 feet of the leased premises, Samson\n1\n “Pooling is the combining of tracts or interests, or parts of tracts or interests, for facilitating\nmore orderly development and production of oil, gas and associated products.” OWEN L.\nANDERSON ET AL., HEMINGWAY OIL AND GAS LAW AND TAXATION, §7.13 AT 386 (4th ed. 2004).\n                                                11\n\fhad to do one of: (1) drill a well on the lease; (2) pay Plaintiffs compensatory\n\nroyalty equal to their share of production from the adjacent producing well as if\n\nthat well had been drilled on their lease; or (3) release the Lease and have no\n\nfurther obligations. PX25¶VI(A).2 Separately, in addition to the offset obligations,\n\nSamson could at any time release “any portion or portions” of the lease “and be\n\nrelieved of all obligations as to the acreage surrendered….” PX25¶IV(B). Samson\n\ndid not owe any offset obligations if the well drilled within 1320 feet was on land\n\npooled with Plaintiffs’ lease.\n\n       Samson decided to create a 704-acre unit for the BSM1 well. Samson’s plan\n\nwas to include 50 acres out of the Broussards’ lease and Plaintiffs’ Jefferson\n\nCounty lease in that unit. That would require Samson to pay royalty to Plaintiffs\n\nbased on their proportionate interest in the unit, but it would otherwise extinguish\n\nSamson’s offset obligations. Otherwise, Samson simply could have released\n\n2\n The Jefferson County lease provides at ¶VI(A):\n      “A. …[I]n the event a well producing from a unit not comprised of acreage from the\n      leased premises … which has been classified as “gas” … is completed on adjacent or\n      nearby lands not more than … [1,320’] from the leased premises … Lessee covenants\n      and agrees to, within ninety (90) days from the date production is first sold …, either (1)\n      commence with due diligence operations for the actual drilling of an offset well on the\n      leased premises…, (2) pay Lessors as compensatory royalty … a sum equal to the\n      royalties which would be payable under this Lease on the production from said adjacent\n      or nearby producing well had same been producing on the leased premises, or (3) in lieu\n      of drilling such offset well or paying such compensatory royalty, release by recordable\n      instrument the offset acreage…. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Lessee\n      shall have no obligations under this Article … in the event a producing well ... is already\n      offset by a well on the leased premises or on acreage pooled therewith producing from\n      the same producing horizon …” [Emphasis added.]\nThe provision above measures the distance between the lease and where the nearby well is\n“completed.” The well at issue was completed very near its bottom-hole location.\n                                               12\n\fPlaintiffs’ lease pursuant to lease paragraphs VI(A) or IV(B), the latter of which\n\npermitted Samson to release the lease at any time. PX25¶¶IV(B), VI(A). Samson\n\ntook steps to obtain pooling authority from Plaintiffs and other mineral owners\n\nwhose consent Samson needed to form the unit. E.g., PX62, 63, 65. 3\n\nD.     Samson Contacted Plaintiffs, Offering to Include 50 Acres of Plaintiffs’\n       Jefferson County Lease in the Unit\n       On February 15, 2001, Mr. Lanoue—a landman then working for Samson—\n\nwrote Hooks requesting Plaintiffs’ consent to pool 50 acres of Plaintiffs’ Jefferson\n\nCounty Lease with adjacent land containing the BSM1 well (the “BSM1 unit”).\n\nPX65, 160.4 The Broussard family already had consented to the unit as to their\n\ninterest in the same acreage. PX63, 65; 12RR:122-23. Hooks wanted additional\n\ninformation and telephoned Lanoue on February 20, 2001. 12RR:124, 177; PX160.\n\nHooks and Lanoue discussed a range of topics concerning the well and the unit.\n\nPX160. Among Hooks’ notes of the conversation was the statement the BSM1 well\n\nwas about 1500 feet west of Pine Island Bayou—the western boundary of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease—a boundary that can move as the river moves.\n\nPX160. Hooks’ notes do not indicate whether the two were discussing the well’s\n\nsurface or bottom-hole location, or a generalized number between the two.\n\n3\n  It is typical for the planned unit to change as the well is designed and drilled. 15RR:54-56.\nThus, there were different plats showing different participants in the possible unit configurations.\n15RR:56.\n4\n  As it appears in the record, PX65 is not identical to what Samson sent to Hooks, but is an\nannotated version of the letter. 12RR:175. The original letter more closely resembled PX63,\nwhich did not have a plat attached. 12RR:176.\n                                                13\n\fE.    Hooks Requested a Plat, and Samson Sent Him One, to Show the\n      Location of Plaintiffs’ Land within the Unit\n      During the February 2001 phone call, Hooks requested a plat showing the\n\nunit; Lanoue sent him one the next day. 12RR:180-81; PX64. Hooks testified he\n\nwanted the plat to see (1) how his property fit within the unit, and (2) whether the\n\nwell was within 1320 feet of his lease. 12RR:180. But Hooks admitted he may not\n\nhave told Lanoue he was interested in the offset obligation. 13RR:25. He also\n\nadmitted he may not have said he needed to know whether the well was within\n\n1320 feet of his lease. 13RR:25. Consistent with Hooks’ explanation of the first\n\nreason he wanted the plat, Lanoue testified he sent Hooks the plat so Hooks could\n\nunderstand where his land lay within the unit. 12RR:124.\n\n      The plat Lanoue sent is attached to PX65. 12RR:181. It is similar to plats\n\nsent to other lessors, including the State of Texas (see, e.g., PX62). It was prepared\n\nin August 2000, around the time the well was completed and months before\n\nLanoue contacted Hooks. The plat regularly was used through October 2001.\n\n12RR:33, 49-50. The plat shows the well deviated toward Plaintiffs’ lease. Lanoue\n\ntestified he estimated the well’s bottom hole location on the plat, using only a ruler\n\nto do so. 12RR:110-111. The plat repeatedly says it is “scaled,” meaning someone\n\nused a ruler, not a survey, to make the plat. 16RR:62-63; 13RR:70-71 (Hooks,\n\nagreeing to definition of “scaled”). It also uses the symbol: “±” in key places. As a\n\nresult, the plat does not purport to be exact or survey-accurate:\n\n                                          14\n\f      Following is a segment of the plat, with color coding added to highlight\n\ncertain features:\n\n                                      15\n\f        The plat has a line (red) depicting something is “1400´±” from the western\n\nboundary of Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease. PX65. (The 50 acres included in\n\nthe unit from Plaintiffs’ lease is in yellow.) An arrow (green) points to a bottom\n\nhole location not on that line, but to an east-west location slightly north of the line\n\nand approximately 3/4 of the way along that line. Three-fourths of 1400 is 1050.\n\n        The plat provides the following information in the lower left corner:\n\n\n\n\nPX65.\n\n        So the plat also states the bottom hole of the well is “1400´± Scaled” from\n\nthe eastern line of the unit (purple line, shown above). PX65 (“FEL” means “from\n\neast line of unit”). The eastern line of the unit is on Plaintiffs’ lease. PX65.\n\n\n                                          16\n\fRunning a line 1400´± westward from the unit’s eastern line would place the well\n\non or nearly on Plaintiffs’ Lease. PX65; 12RR:62-63.\n\n      These signals are contradictory. If the estimation of “1400´±” were to the\n\nwell’s bottom hole location, the BSM1 well could be farther than 1320 feet from\n\nPlaintiffs’ lease. “1400´± Scaled” from the east line of the unit indicates the BSM1\n\nwell could have been closer than 1320 feet to Plaintiffs’ lease. The arrow pointing\n\nto a bottom-hole location 3/4 of the way along the “1400´± Scaled” line showed\n\nthe BSM1 well was about 1050 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease. That is very close to the\n\noriginal estimated bottom-hole location of 1080 feet from Plaintiffs’ Lease.\n\nF.    Hooks Testified He Relied on the “1400´± Scaled” Depiction to\n      Determine the Distance of the BSM1 Well from Plaintiffs’ Jefferson\n      County Lease\n      To determine the BSM1 well’s distance from his Lease, Hooks testified he\n\nfocused on the line estimating “1400´± Scaled”:\n\n      Q. And what did you do to verify that the—what he told you was true about\n      the well being located 1500 feet away from Pine Bayou—Pine Bayou?\n\n      A. [Hooks] Well, I looked at the—what was indicated on the plat; and it\n      shows me that it was approximately—the bottom hole location was\n      approximately 1400 feet west of Pine Island Bayou.\n\n      Q. Now, that's a little bit different than the 1500 feet that he told you over\n      the telephone, right?\n\n      A. A little bit. I assumed that he was talking in generalities in that case and\n      that once he got the plat it was more specific on the plat.\n\n      Q. Well, did that spark any concern that he might be lying to you if he told\n      you 1500 on the telephone and then gave you a plat that was 1400?\n\n                                         17\n\f      A. No. I—the plat speaks for itself.\n\n                                              ***\n      Q. Now, I want to—well, first of all, after you got this plat and checked it\n      out and confirmed what Mr. Lanoue had told you over the telephone, what\n      did you then do? Did you agree to—to accept the pooling?\n\n      A. Well, once I had satisfied myself that everything was in order, was\n      appropriate, then I decided I would send back the letter that he had requested\n      me to sign agreeing to this but with some changes on it.\n\n12RR:181-183. On cross-examination, Hooks continued to stress his reliance on\n\nthe “1400´± Scaled” distance:\n\n      Q. But, yet, you didn't call him [Lanoue], did you, and ask him for some\n      clarification?\n\n      A. Well, I didn't think I needed any clarification. It seemed clear to me that\n      it was—it was 1400 feet away from the bayou.\n                                              ***\n\n      Q. All right, Mr. Hooks. So, anyway, you concluded that wherever in there\n      the bottom hole was that it was in a satisfactory location, right?\n      A. Yes. I—I concluded that it was fourteen—approximately 1400 feet west\n      of Pine Island Bayou. [13RR:33, 35.]\n      Hooks emphasized he relied on the plat’s estimate of “1400´± Scaled” to the\n\nexclusion of everything else, including Lanoue’s statement over the telephone.\n\n13RR:36. He testified, “when I saw a surveyor’s plat that shows 1400 feet, I\n\nassume that’s more accurate than what his—his verbal estimation was.” 13RR:36;\n\nsee also 13RR:68 (“I assumed that he was just estimating and—verbally, but the\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fplat would be more accurate”). Hooks made no further inquiries regarding the\n\nlocation of the well’s bottom hole. 13RR:39.\n\nG.    Plaintiffs Agreed to Include their 50 acres in the BSM1 Unit.\n      On May 25, 2001, Hooks and his wife signed a letter consenting to pool 50\n\nacres from the Jefferson County lease into the BSM1 unit. PX65. They specified\n\ntheir acceptance was “conditioned upon the subsequent execution by Lessors and\n\nLessee of a formal lease amendment document to be prepared by [Hooks] and\n\nsubmitted to [Samson].” PX65. Plaintiffs never prepared such a document.\n\n12RR:187-88. At trial, Hooks testified repeatedly he always intended to be a part\n\nof the unit and considered Plaintiffs’ 50 acres to be part of the unit. 13RR:14-17.\n\nHooks also agreed to the division order setting out Plaintiffs’ percentage\n\ndistribution of the unit’s proceeds. PX156, 157.\n\n      After Plaintiffs consented to the unit, Samson sent them royalty checks for\n\ntheir unit interest in production for the three wells eventually drilled on the BSM1\n\nunit. PX552. Plaintiffs cashed those checks continuing through trial and now for\n\nmore than six years after the trial. 12RR:203-04; 13RR:44-45. Plaintiffs never\n\nsought any judicial decree setting aside their consent to the pooled unit.\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fH.     Other Operations Near and on the BSM1 Unit\n       Samson drilled other wells in the vicinity of Plaintiffs’ lease after Plaintiffs\n\nconsented to join the BSM1 unit. One of those wells was the Joyce DuJay No. 1\n\nwell (“DuJay1 well”), north of the Jefferson County lease. PX565. That well was\n\ncompleted in January 2002 and included in a unit called the DuJay1 unit. PX21,\n\n552, 565. Plaintiffs’ two Hardin County leases were included in the DuJay1 unit.\n\nPX21, 552. The bottom-hole location of the DuJay1 well was also within 1320 feet\n\nof Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease. PX640. Samson owed no offset obligations as\n\nto the DuJay1 well because—although the well was drilled within 1320 feet of the\n\nJefferson County lease—it was already offset by the BSM1 well 5 Hooks testified\n\nhe had not been defrauded with regard to the DuJay1 well:\n\n       Q. All right. Now, nobody tricked you into – or nobody did anything to\n       deceive you or defraud you with respect to the DuJay 1 well, did they?\n\n       A. [Hooks] Not that I'm aware of.\n\n       Q. Well, you never talked to Mr. Lanoue about it. Nobody ever sent you\n       anything that you say is fraudulent. With respect to the DuJay 1 nobody did\n       anything—or from Samson, anyway, nobody did anything to trick you or\n       hoodwink you or defraud you or something with respect to the DuJay 1,\n       right?\n\n        A. Not that I'm aware of, no.\n\n\n5\n  The Jefferson County lease states, “Lessee shall have no [offset] obligations under this Article\nVI in the event a producing well on nearby or adjacent land is already offset by a well on the\nleased premises or on acreage pooled therewith producing from the same producing horizon\nfrom which production has been secured….” PX25 ¶VI (A). Both the BSM1 well and the\nDuJay1 well produced from the same formation and offset one another.\n                                               20\n\f13RR:53. Nevertheless, alleged “damages” for the DuJay1 were included in the\n\njury’s award of “fraud damages.” PX608; 19CR:3268.\n\n          Other wells followed the DuJay1. See PX552; 13RR:136. Plaintiffs did not\n\nclaim any of these additional wells was within 1320 feet of the Jefferson County\n\nlease.\n\n          No well was ever drilled on any of Plaintiffs’ three leases to Samson. The\n\nroyalties Samson paid to Plaintiffs always were based on the inclusion of\n\nPlaintiffs’ leases in a pooled unit, with unit wells drilled on someone else’s\n\nproperty. Through May 2008, Plaintiffs received over $510,000 in royalty from the\n\nBSM1 unit (the subject of Plaintiffs’ fraud claim), and over $2.14 million in\n\nroyalty from Samson for wells drilled on units pooled with one or more of\n\nPlaintiffs’ three leases. 16RR:21-22; DX3; PX552. Now, seven years later, those\n\npayments—all received and deposited by Plaintiffs—are much higher than in 2008.\n\nDespite these facts, Plaintiffs claim to have been damaged in excess of $22\n\nmillion. 6\n\nI.        This Lawsuit\n          In August 2004, an action was filed against Samson styled Joyce DuJay Lee\n\nv. Samson. 1CR:2. The Lee plaintiffs complained about pooling issues unrelated to\n\nthe BSM1 well. In December 2004, a second action, Thomas Klorer et al. v.\n\n\n6\n    In recent trial court filings, Plaintiffs now assert their claims exceed $52 million.\n                                                    21\n\fSamson, was filed in which other landowners also complained about the same\n\nunrelated pooling issue. 1Supp1stCR:2. Those two actions were consolidated in\n\nAugust 2005. 2CR:295.\n\n      On his birthday in the fall of 2006, Hooks attended a seminar for oil and gas\n\nlawyers. 12RR:165-66; 13RR:50. There, he met Plaintiffs’ attorney Paul Simpson,\n\nwho told Hooks he was handling the consolidated actions against Samson.\n\n12RR:165-67. Following that encounter, Plaintiffs joined the pending case on\n\nNovember 16, 2006. 3CR:440. At that time, however, Plaintiffs did not plead fraud\n\nclaims. 3CR:440-465. They added fraud allegations May 7, 2007. 4CR:467, 490-\n\n94. In the May 7, 2007 petition, Plaintiffs alleged in the alternative—relying on\n\ndiffering facts—(1) they had never been part of the BSM1 unit and Samson\n\nbreached its lease by not paying compensatory royalties; or (2) if they were a part\n\nof the unit, Samson defrauded them into joining the unit. 4CR:487-94. Plaintiffs\n\nhad not notified Samson about their fraud or lease breach allegations prior to filing\n\nthose claims. Accordingly, Samson drilled wells in the vicinity of the BSM1 unit in\n\nreliance on Plaintiffs’ participation in that unit.\n\n      In September 2007, the trial court severed the action into three cases, one of\n\nwhich became this Hooks action, which was tried and is now this appeal. 4CR:626.\n\nThe trial court granted summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs’ breach of lease\n\nclaim with regard to the drilling of the BSM1 well because it was barred by\n\n\n                                            22\n\flimitations. That left Plaintiffs with only their fraud claim. 18CR:3162. Plaintiffs\n\ndid not appeal from the granting of the breach of lease summary judgment. The\n\nfraud claim was tried to the jury, along with the formation production claim. The\n\njudgment entered following the jury trial, in combination with previous summary\n\njudgment rulings, awarded the following amounts [1Supp2dCR:6; Court Ex.

There is factually insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding Hooks, in the exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence, could not have discovered his fraud claim until April 2007. Further,\n\nthere is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support fraud damages and\n\nprejudgment interest on those damages.\n\n      Common Law Fraud Liability. There is legally and factually insufficient\n\nevidence to support Plaintiffs’ common law fraud claim for the following reasons:\n\n   • The plat was marked “scaled,” meaning it was inexact and the distance upon\n\n      which Plaintiff testified he relied said “1400´± Scaled”. A distance of\n\n      “1400´± Scaled” is too indefinite to form the basis of a misrepresentation\n\n      when someone is attempting to determine whether a well is 1320 feet from a\n\n      lease line. Plaintiffs’ witnesses admitted there had to be at least some give\n\n      on the 1400 number, with Plaintiffs’ expert admitting it could be a 100 foot\n\n      tolerance.\n\n   • Hooks ignored the “±” part of the plat when he supposedly relied on the\n\n      “1400´± Scaled” distance call. He could not justifiably have relied on such\n\n      an indefinite measurement when he was looking for a precise answer to his\n\n      supposed question—a question he never even posed to Samson.\n\n\n                                         24\n\f   • Hooks admitted he may not have told Samson why he cared about the\n\n      location of the BSM1 well. Samson’s landman, Lanoue, thought Hooks\n\n      wanted the plat only to see where Plaintiffs’ lease was located within the\n\n      unit, which the plat plainly showed. There was no evidence Samson had any\n\n      intent in supplying the plat to defraud Plaintiffs into consenting to the unit.\n\n   • Plaintiffs failed to prove a duty to disclose existed. First, as a matter of law,\n\n      no duty to disclose existed. Second, there is legally and factually insufficient\n\n      evidence of the breach of a duty to disclose. Samson did not know Plaintiffs\n\n      were relying on the plat in the way Hooks testified. Further, Plaintiffs were\n\n      not “continuing” to rely on the plat after the date they consented to the unit.\n\n      Finally, in contrast to the requirement Plaintiffs must lack an equal\n\n      opportunity to discover “the truth,” Plaintiffs had access to multiple public\n\n      records from which they could have learned the bottom hole’s precise\n\n      distance from their lease line.\n\n      Statutory Fraud Liability. Statutory fraud does not even apply to these facts\n\nbecause there was no “sale” of real estate. Moreover, for the same reasons as\n\nabove, there is legally and factually insufficient evidence of statutory fraud. That\n\nclaim requires the same misrepresentation, intent, and reliance elements as\n\ncommon law fraud. There is no, or insufficient, evidence of any of those elements.\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f      Statute of Limitations for Fraud. The misrepresentation allegedly occurred in\n\nFebruary 2001 and Plaintiffs supposedly acted on it in May 2001, when they\n\nsigned the pooling consent. But Plaintiffs did not file their fraud claim until May\n\n2007. Limitations for fraud is four years. There is factually insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s finding that Plaintiffs, by exercising reasonable diligence, could\n\nnot have discovered their fraud claim until April 2007. Hooks’ testimony on the\n\nissue was nothing more than a statement of when he actually learned about the\n\nclaim. He did not provide any evidence why, in the exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence (as an experienced oil and gas attorney and mineral owner), he could not\n\nhave discovered his claim earlier. Accordingly, there is factually insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s answer to when Plaintiffs could have discovered the\n\nalleged fraud by exercising reasonable diligence.\n\n      Improper Fraud Damages. There was legally and factually insufficient\n\nevidence supporting Plaintiffs’ damages evidence for the following reasons:\n\n   • There was no evidence of a fraud measure of damages. Instead, Plaintiffs\n\n      presented only breach of lease damages as alleged fraud damages.\n\n   • Although Plaintiffs attempted to categorize their damages as “consequential”\n\n      damages, they never pleaded for consequential damages.\n\n   • In this alleged fraud in the inducement case, Plaintiffs had a choice of (1)\n\n      setting aside the agreement they claim they were induced to sign (the\n\n                                         26\n\f   pooling consent) or (2) standing on that agreement and seeking fraud\n\n   damages. Plaintiffs never attempted to set aside the agreement to pool but\n\n   nevertheless sought damages as if that consent to pooling did not exist.\n\n   Throughout this case, they accepted royalty payments from that unit and\n\n   continue to do so to this day.\n\n• Approximately half of Plaintiffs’ claimed fraud damages were attributable to\n\n   another well—the DuJay1 well—as to which Hooks admitted he was not\n\n   defrauded. Moreover, to the extent Plaintiffs were seeking compensatory\n\n   royalty damages for the DuJay1 well, there was no evidence (and\n\n   insufficient evidence) those damages were foreseeable at the time the\n\n   alleged fraud supposedly occurred.\n\n• Almost ⅔ of the fraud damages ($12,995,832) represents an improper\n\n   contractual “late charge” of 18% compounded monthly. The 18% interest\n\n   rate “only” applies to “past due royalties” not to fraud damages. Hooks, 457\n\n   S.W.3d at 69-70. Fraud damages are an “other recovery” to which “the\n\n   statutory rate of 5% applies.” Id. at 70. Here, the 18% contractual late charge\n\n   was incorporated into the fraud damages calculations and is part of the jury’s\n\n   damages award, so there is no proper evidence of fraud damages. PX608;\n\n   1Supp2dCR:6.\n\n\n\n\n                                      27\n\f   • The fraud damages also incorporated damages for formation production. The\n\n      Supreme Court held Plaintiffs are not entitled to formation production\n\n      damages. Accordingly, the fraud damages must be reversed.\n\n   • Plaintiffs have continued to accept royalties from the unit. Accordingly,\n\n      those payments have to be taken into account if any damages are awarded to\n\n      Plaintiffs.\n\n      Recalculation of Favored Nations Damages. The parties entered into a\n\nstipulation of the favored nations damages, both with and without formation\n\nproduction damages. The favored nations damages awarded in the original\n\njudgment are incorrect now because they, like the fraud damages, include\n\nformation production damages. Thus, the favored nations damages need to be\n\nrecalculated. Moreover, because the damages currently only go through May 2008,\n\nPlaintiffs certainly will request those damages be made current. As a consequence,\n\nthis Court should remand the favored nations damages to be recalculated by the\n\ntrial court. In connection with that remand, Plaintiffs asserted the late payment\n\nprovision provides for monthly compounding of interest at 18%. The Supreme\n\nCourt agreed to the 18% interest rate for past-due royalties. But Plaintiffs are\n\nentitled to prejudgment interest measured by the standard “simple” interest\n\nmeasure. Other courts, interpreting contract language similar to the language at\n\nissue in this case, have held the language allows for 18% simple interest.\n\n                                         28\n\f                                   ARGUMENT\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n      Samson’s appeal presents both legal and factual insufficiency of the\n\nevidence challenges to the jury’s findings on fraud and fraud damages. Further,\n\nthis appeal presents factual insufficiency challenges to the jury’s limitations\n\nfinding on fraud. Finally, this appeal presents legal questions surrounding damages\n\nremand, interest calculation questions, and damages recalculations.\n\n      This Court should sustain a legal sufficiency challenge on issues on which\n\nPlaintiffs bear the burden of proof if “the evidence demonstrates a complete\n\nabsence of a vital fact, or if the evidence offered is no more than a scintilla.”\n\nBurbage v. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d 249, 259 (Tex. 2014). “We regard evidence that\n\ncreates a mere surmise or suspicion of a vital fact as, in legal effect, no evidence.”\n\nId.; accord Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 601 (Tex. 2004). The\n\nevidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the judgment but credit\n\nmust be given to evidence a reasonable juror could not disregard. City of Keller v.\n\nWilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807 (Tex. 2005).\n\n      When considering a factual sufficiency challenge, the court “must consider\n\nand weigh all of the evidence, not just that evidence which supports the verdict.”\n\nMaritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 407 (Tex. 1998). The appellate\n\ncourt is authorized to set aside the verdict in the circumstance that it is so contrary\n\n\n                                          29\n\fto the overwhelming weight of the evidence that the verdict is clearly wrong and\n\nunjust. Id.; see also Ortiz v. Jones, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex.1996).\n\n      The Supreme Court did not decide the legal or factual sufficiency of\n\nPlaintiffs’ fraud claims. This Court reversed and rendered judgment on the fraud\n\nclaim based on limitations. The Supreme Court held that ruling was incorrect and\n\nremanded for this Court’s consideration of the other arguments “concerning\n\nHooks’ fraudulent inducement claims” including “the factual and legal sufficiency\n\nof the evidence with regard to common-law fraud, statutory fraud, and damages for\n\nfraud….” 457 S.W.3d at 61. Furthermore, the limitations issue has been remanded\n\nfor reconsideration on factual sufficiency grounds.\n\n      Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion addresses the fraud liability and\n\ndamages challenges now remanded to this Court. Nor is there any decision on\n\nlimitations factual sufficiency.\n\nB.    There is Legally and Factually Insufficient Evidence of Common Law\n      Fraud\n             To recover damages for fraud, Plaintiffs must prove:\n\n      (1) a material representation that was false when made; (2) when the\n      representation was made, the speaker knew it was false or made it recklessly\n      as a positive assertion without any knowledge of its truth; (3) the speaker\n      made the representation with the intent that the other party should act upon\n      it; (4) the party actually and justifiably relied on the representation; and (5)\n      thereby suffered injury.\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\fMiller v. Raytheon Aircraft Co., 229 S.W.3d 358, 380-81 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.). “Fraudulent inducement is a subspecies of fraud; ‘with a\n\nfraudulent inducement claim, the elements of fraud must be established as they\n\nrelate to an agreement between the parties.’” 457 S.W.3d at 57 (quoting Haase v.\n\nGlazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 798–99 (Tex.2001)).\n\n      1.     There is legally and factually insufficient evidence             of   a\n             misrepresentation on which Hooks claims to have relied\n      Hooks’ reliance was limited. He made it very clear he only relied on the plat,\n\nand then on only one representation on the plat: the line saying “1400´± Scaled.”\n\nHe repeatedly disclaimed any reliance on Lanoue’s statements in their telephone\n\ncall. 12RR:181-183; 13RR:33-36, 68. He testified the “plat speaks for itself,” he\n\ndid not need “any clarification” and the plat was “more accurate” than Lanoue’s\n\n“verbal estimation.” 12RR:181-183; 13RR:33-36.\n\n      Hooks did not point to anything else on which he relied. He did not claim he\n\nhad relied upon the X,Y coordinates on the plat. He testified he disregarded the\n\ncontradictory statement in the legend that the well was bottomed “1400´± Scaled”\n\nfrom the east line of the unit. 13RR:38-39. Hooks did not rely on anything other\n\nthan the plat and he relied only on the one statement on the plat.\n\n      The problem is the plat does not say “1400´ absolute.” That is plainly how\n\nHooks read it; but that it not what it says. The plat does not say it is an accurate\n\nsurvey. In fact, it says the opposite. Hooks admitted at trial “scaled” means there\n\n                                         31\n\fmay be inaccuracies in the plat. 13RR:71 (admitting there could be “some room for\n\nerror” in a plat that says it is “scaled”); 16RR:62-63 (scaled map is subject to\n\nerror). And the plat does not say “1400´”. It says “1400´± Scaled”. And the\n\nmeasurement was to a waterway whose boundaries can move.\n\n       Both the statement the plat is “scaled”—meaning it says on its face it is\n\ninaccurate—and the statement “1400´±” mean the plat did not represent the line\n\nmeasured anything precisely 1400 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease.\n\n       The symbol “±” indicates a tolerance from 1400 feet. Plaintiffs’ expert\n\nsurveyor explained Lanoue’s original verbal estimate that the well was\n\napproximately 1500 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease could be explained by the plat’s\n\nindication of “1400´±”. 12RR:53, 67-68; see also 13RR:36, 68 (Hooks similarly\n\nexcusing Lanoue’s 1500 foot description). In other words, “1400´± Scaled” could\n\nmean a variance of 100 feet one way or the other. 12RR:53, 67-68. If “1400´±”\n\ncould include 1500 feet, then it could equally encompass 1300 feet. 1300 feet\n\nwould place the well closer than 1320 feet to Plaintiffs’ lease.\n\n       Indefinite statements cannot form the basis of a misrepresentation. Bradford\n\nv. Vento, 48 S.W.3d 749, 759 (Tex. 2001). 7 The purpose of using terms like “more\n\nor less” or “plus or minus” is to relieve exactness. 4 A. LEOPOLD, TEXAS PRACTICE\n\n7\n Accord, Simulis, L.L.C. v. Gen. Elec. Capital Corp., 439 S.W.3d 571, 577, 579 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2014, pet. denied); Ikon Office Solutions v. Eifert, 125 S.W.3d 113, 128 n.\n11 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. den.); In re Media Arts Group, Inc., 116 S.W.3d\n900, 910 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, orig. proc.).\n                                              32\n\fSERIES, LAND TITLES AND TITLE EXAMINATION, §15.15 (3d Ed. 2015). Adding “±”\n\nto a number signals indefiniteness, as Plaintiffs’ expert confirmed. Plaintiffs’\n\nsurveyor could not put a number on what “±” might mean. 12RR:54. However, she\n\nallowed that “1400´±” could permit differences of 100 feet. 12RR:53, 67-68.\n\nHooks testified he thought “±” meant a few feet one direction or another. 13RR:36.\n\n      Courts addressing acreage or distance calls using terms like “plus or minus”\n\nor “more or less” allow for variances at least up to 10%. See Slagle v. Clark, 237\n\nS.W.2d 430, 433-34 (Tex. Civ. App.—Amarillo 1951, no writ); Harkins v. North\n\nShore Energy, L.L.C., No. 13-12-00504-CV, 2014 WL 1789572, at *8 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi May 1, 2014, pet. pending) (“more or less” allowed a\n\ndifference greater than 5%). For example, the Slagle court observed one\n\njurisdiction had fixed the discrepancy at 10%. Slagle noted the discrepancy before\n\nit was less than 10% and held there was no fraud. Id. at 434; see also 26A C.J.S.\n\nDeeds § 274 (2015) (“more or less” relieves a “stated distance or quantity of the\n\nattribute of exactness”).\n\n      Here, if the 10% rule is applied, “1400´±” would include everything from\n\n1260 to 1540 feet. Even greater latitude is warranted when the term “Scaled” is\n\nused. There is less than a 6% difference between 1400 and 1320. So, even if\n\nsomeone read the plat as did Hooks, ignoring the arrow showing the well’s bottom-\n\nhole location to be about 1050 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease line, there was no\n\n\n                                        33\n\fmisrepresentation. “1400´± Scaled” warns it is inaccurate and the “±” causes\n\n“1400´” to be too close to the 1320 foot line. There was no actionable\n\nmisrepresentation here as a matter of law. Alternatively, there is factually\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding.\n\n      Furthermore, Hooks specifically admitted at trial there was no fraud as to a\n\nsubstantial portion of what the jury awarded as fraud damages. Plaintiffs’ expert\n\npresented fraud damages that included compensatory royalties supposedly owed on\n\ntwo wells—the BSM1 well (located in the BSM1 unit where the fraud supposedly\n\noccurred) and another well—the DuJay1 well. PX608; 19CR:3268 (jury awarding\n\namount to which Plaintiffs’ expert testified). Half what the jury awarded for fraud\n\nwas for the DuJay1 well. PX608 ($3,538,565.24 of the total $7,085,806.02 fraud\n\ndamages is for DuJay1 well; an additional $12,995,832.05 is “late charges” for\n\nboth wells). But the DuJay1 well was not drilled until significantly after Plaintiffs\n\nconsented to the BSM1 unit, and was in a different unit from the BSM1 well.\n\nHooks admitted he was not defrauded as to the DuJay1 well. Hooks was asked:\n\n“[N]obody did anything to deceive you or defraud you with respect to the DuJay 1\n\nwell, did they?” He answered: “Not that I'm aware of.” 13RR:53.\n\n      So, Hooks admitted there was no fraud with regard to the well comprising\n\nhalf the jury’s award for fraud damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f      2.     There is legally and factually insufficient evidence of reliance\n\n      For the same reasons the uncertainty of “1400´± Scaled” means there was no\n\nlegally or factually sufficient evidence of misrepresentation, there was similarly no\n\nand insufficient evidence of reliance. Hooks’ testimony demonstrates he treated\n\n“1400´±” as if it was simply “1400´.” 13RR:36. He did not “rely” on what was\n\nrepresented to him. He concluded the distance from the well to his property was\n\n1400 feet, exactly, and he relied upon his own conclusion. He did not rely on\n\nSamson’s plat, which said the “1400´” was “±” and the entire plat was “Scaled.”\n\n      There must be legally and factually sufficient evidence that a plaintiff\n\n“actually” and justifiably relied on the alleged misrepresentation. Ernst & Young,\n\nL.L.P. v. Pac. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 51 S.W.3d 573, 577 (Tex. 2001); accord, Nat’l\n\nProp. Holdings, L.P. v. Westergren, 453 S.W.3d 419, 423 (Tex. 2015); Hartford\n\nFire Ins. Co. v. C. Springs 300, Ltd., 287 S.W.3d 771, 781 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). The evidence here is lacking. Hooks “relied” on\n\nsomething other than the plat description. He relied on his own mental filling-in of\n\nthe number “1400´” without taking into account the “± Scaled.” Hooks assumed an\n\nanswer to his unexpressed question concerning the well’s location from Samson’s\n\nindefinite statement “1400´± Scaled,” contained on a plat sent to Hooks for another\n\npurpose, and did not tell Samson he had leaped to that conclusion or otherwise\n\nseek confirmation.\n\n\n                                         35\n\f      Cases hold a plaintiff has not relied as a matter of law when the statements\n\nhe supposedly relied upon are indefinite.

Brown, 965\n\nS.W.2d 501, 503 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      There was legally and factually insufficient evidence of reliance.\n\n      3.    There is legally and factually insufficient evidence Samson intended to\n            defraud Plaintiffs\n      There is no and insufficient evidence Samson intended for Plaintiffs to rely\n\non the “1400´± Scaled” or any other measurement on the plat to determine the\n\ndistance between their lease and the bottom-hole location of the BSM1 well.\n\nHooks was asked at trial whether he mentioned his concerns about Samson’s offset\n\nobligations during the conversation with Lanoue that resulted in Lanoue’s sending\n\nthe plat. 13RR:25. Hooks admitted he may not have mentioned them:\n\n      Q. Did you mention to Mr. Lanoue anything about offset obligations in that\n      phone call?\n      A. [Hooks] I don't know if we specifically talked about offset obligations.\n      We talked about the location of the well; and I believe that was clear, that\n      that was a potential issue.\n      Q. Well, you did not tell Mr. Lanoue that you were concerned about\n      whether the well was going to be within 1,320 feet. You never said that\n      specifically, did you?\n\n      A. I may not have…. [13RR:25 (emphasis added).]\n                                        36\n\f      Lanoue testified he sent this plat because he understood Hooks wanted to\n\nvisualize the location of Plaintiffs’ Lease within the unit:\n\n      Q. And, then, did you then send Mr. Hooks some additional information\n      about the Black Stone Minerals well and unit?\n      A. [Lanoue] He had called and was not sure—was not sure where their land\n      was laying. He wanted to know where their tract was going to be located\n      within the unit and requested a plat. So, I sent him one. I faxed him one.\n      [12RR:124.]\n\n      Lanoue also testified the lease’s offset provision was not a topic of\n\nconversation when he sent the plat to Hooks. 12RR:92-93. Lanoue explained, “The\n\nplat I’d sent to the Hooks wasn’t intended to be a plat showing where the—how far\n\naway the well was located. It was purely an informational plat to show where their\n\ntract was to be located within the unit.” 12RR:93 (emphasis added). The plat sent\n\nto Hooks was not one created at Hooks’ request. Lanoue drew it six months before\n\nhe ever talked to Hooks. 12RR:49-50. Moreover, Lanoue used it and similar plats\n\nfrom August 2000 through October 2001. 12RR:49-50.\n\n      Samson derived no advantage—monetary or otherwise—from Plaintiffs’ 50\n\nacres being in the unit. Plaintiffs’ 57.25% cotenant in the lease—the Broussards—\n\nalready had agreed to the pooling. 15RR:63. If Plaintiffs refused to join the unit,\n\nSamson could have released their 50 acres from their lease. PX25 ¶IV(B). The\n\nJefferson County lease expressly gave Samson the authority “at any time” to\n\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\frelease any portion of the lease “and be relieved of all obligations as to the acreage\n\nsurrendered.” PX25¶IV(B).\n\n      Had Samson been aware of Mr. Hooks’ allegations earlier, it obviously\n\nwould have released Plaintiffs’ lease, and Plaintiffs would have received none of\n\nthe $510,000 Samson paid them for their participation in the BSM1 unit through\n\nMay 2008, plus additional payments thereafter. 15RR:63. Samson’s geophysicist,\n\nMr. Beale, testified without contradiction that if Hooks had refused to consent to\n\nthe unit, Samson would have released Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease. 15RR:62.\n\nMost of the Jefferson County lease was separated from productive acreage by a\n\ngeological fault. 15RR:65-66. Hooks agreed that, had Samson released his lease\n\nand kept the Broussard lease in the unit, Samson would have made more money\n\nthan it did by including Plaintiffs’ interest in the unit:\n\n       Q. And if you did not join the unit and your property was released, your\n      interest in the property was released, the portion that would have gone to\n      you would have just stayed with Samson, wouldn't it?\n       A. I believe that's correct.\n       Q. And that's perfectly legal, isn't it?\n       A. Yes.\n      Q. They would not have been doing anything improper, illegal, or wrong by\n      doing that, would they?\n       A. I suppose not.\n      Q. So, they had zero incentive, didn't they, Mr. Hooks, to feel compelled to\n      do whatever it took to get you into the unit?\n       A. I don't know what their incentive is.\n\n\n                                            38\n\f        Q. Given that they had more money in their pocket without you going into\n       the unit, would you agree with me that certainly is a counterincentive?\n        A. I—if that were the case, it would appear to be.\n\n13RR:44. Hooks could not identify any reason why Samson would want to defraud\n\nhim into consenting to the unit. 13RR:44; see also 15RR:63. In other words,\n\nSamson would have benefitted by releasing Plaintiffs’ lease and excluding\n\nPlaintiffs from the unit, rather than by including them. 8\n\n       Proof of intent requires something more than a foreseeable possibility\n\nsomeone might rely on something. “The mere fact that it should be known that\n\nanother will rely upon a misrepresentation does not, of itself, establish that the\n\nmisrepresentation was made with the intent to induce reliance.” Blue Bell, Inc. v.\n\nPeat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 715 S.W.2d 408, 415 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1986,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.); see Ernst & Young, 51 S.W.3d at 579-80 (citing Blue Bell).\n\nRather, “[t]he ‘intent’ element of a fraud action imports a significantly greater\n\ndegree of purposeful conduct than does the ‘foreseeability’ element of a negligence\n\naction.” Blue Bell, 715 S.W.2d at 415; Willis v. Marshall, 401 S.W.3d 689, 702\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 2013, no pet.) (quoting Blue Bell in a fraudulent inducement\n\n8\n  There is a breach notification provision in the Jefferson County lease, but Plaintiffs never\ncomplied with it. See Arbor Windsor Court, Ltd. v. Weekley Homes, LP, No. 14-13-00480-CV,\n2015 WL 1245548, at *1 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Mar. 17, 2015, no pet.) (breach\nnotification provision is condition precedent). Because Samson was not informed of any\npotential breaches, it did not release any portion of the Hooks lease, which it was free to do at\nany time. Had Samson released Plaintiffs’ lease in whole or in part, Plaintiffs would have\nreceived no money from the BSM1 unit and Samson would have avoided Plaintiffs’ fraud claim\nwith all the attendant costs.\n                                               39\n\fcase); see also Ehrhardt v.

Samson objected to these\n\ninstructions because there was no evidence raising a duty to disclose. 17RR:28.\n\n        Whether a party has a duty to disclose is a question of law. Bradford, 48\n\nS.W.3d at 755. “Generally, no duty of disclosure arises without evidence of a\n\nconfidential or fiduciary relationship.” Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Morris, 981 S.W.2d\n\n667, 674 (Tex. 1998).\n\n        Restatement of Torts §551 describes other circumstances where parties may\n\nhave a duty to disclose. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS, §551 (1977). Here, the\n\ninstruction apparently was based on an alleged duty to disclose “subsequently\n\nacquired information.” Id. But the Supreme Court has “never adopted section\n\n551.”        Bradford, 48 S.W.3d at 756.9 Samson did not have a fiduciary or\n\n\n9\n As the Fifth Circuit noted, “[a] reasonable jurist might well conclude … that a duty to disclose\nexists in Texas only in the context of a confidential or fiduciary relationship.” United Teacher\nAssocs. Ins. Co. v. Union Labor Life Ins. Co., 414 F.3d 558, 566 (5th Cir. 2005). Nevertheless,\n“courts after Bradford (including [the Fifth Circuit]) have not gotten the message, but have\n                                               40\n\fconfidential relationship with Plaintiffs that could create a duty to disclose. See\n\nHECI Exploration Co. v. Neel, 982 S.W.2d 881, 888 (Tex. 1998). There was no\n\nduty to disclose as a matter of law in this case.\n\n       Even if there were a duty to disclose outside a fiduciary or confidential\n\nrelationship, that duty would not have existed here. In this case, the “duty to\n\ndisclose” supposedly arose “when a party makes a representation and later acquires\n\nnew information which makes the representation untrue or misleading….”\n\n19CR:3266 (jury instructions). Under that circumstance, there is supposedly a duty\n\nto “disclose such information to anyone whom [the party] knows to be still acting\n\non the basis of the original statement.” Id. Plaintiffs asserted Samson had a duty to\n\nnotify Plaintiffs of a change made to its plat in November 2001, correcting the\n\nbottom-hole location. 17RR:8.\n\n       In order for a duty to disclose to exist under these instructions, there had to\n\nbe sufficient evidence Samson knew (1) Hooks had relied on the “1400´± Scaled”\n\nnotation and (2) was “still acting on the basis of the original statement.”\n\n19CR:3266; see also RESTATEMENT §551. There was no (and insufficient)\n\nevidence of either of these two elements. First, there is legally and factually\n\ninsufficient evidence Samson knew Hooks had used the plat to determine whether\n\nthe well was 1320 feet from his lease. Second, Plaintiffs had already taken the one\n\ninstead continued to find that a duty to disclose can exist in Texas absent a confidential or\nfiduciary relationship.” Id.\n                                             41\n\faction Hooks testified they took based on the plat—signing a written consent to\n\npooling on May 25, 2001. Since the plat was not corrected until November 2001,\n\nthere is no or insufficient evidence Plaintiffs were “still acting on the basis of the\n\noriginal statement.”\n\n             b.    There is legally and factually insufficient evidence of a failure\n                   to disclose\n\n             The charge defined a “failure to disclose” as:\n\n      [1] the party fails to disclose a material fact within the knowledge of that\n      party; [2] the party knows that the other party is ignorant of the fact and does\n      not have an equal opportunity to discover the truth; [3] the party intends to\n      induce the other party to take some action by failing to disclose the fact; and\n      [4] the other party suffers injury as a result of acting without knowledge of\n      the undisclosed fact. [19CR:3266.]\n\n      Bearing in mind the alleged “failure to disclose” was of Samson’s November\n\n2001 plat (17RR:8), there was no or insufficient evidence of three of the four stated\n\nelements. Skipping to the third element, there was no or insufficient evidence\n\nSamson intended to induce Hooks to do anything when it sent him the original plat,\n\nor when it did not send him the corrected plat. There was no or insufficient\n\nevidence Samson knew Hooks was trying to determine whether the bottom hole\n\nwas within 1320 feet of Plaintiffs’ lease; Hooks had not said that was why he\n\nwanted the plat. 12RR:124; 13RR:25. On the fourth element, Plaintiffs suffered no\n\ninjury because of the alleged subsequent nondisclosure. The only injury of which\n\nPlaintiffs complain is their granting written consent to pooling. They had already\n\n\n                                         42\n\fsustained that supposed “injury” previously when they agreed to include their 50\n\nacres in the unit; that occurred significantly before the time Samson corrected the\n\nplat.\n\n        The second element calls for sufficient evidence Samson knew Hooks was\n\nignorant of the well’s distance from his land and did not “have an equal\n\nopportunity to discover the truth….” 19CR:3266. As stated above, there is no or\n\ninsufficient evidence Samson knew Hooks was silently questioning the bottom\n\nhole’s distance from his lease line. Moreover, there is no evidence Plaintiffs lacked\n\nan equal opportunity to discover the truth. Hooks could have directly asked\n\nSamson whether the well’s bottom hole was within 1320 feet of Plaintiffs’ lease or\n\nwhether the offset obligations had been triggered; but he did not. He was an\n\nexperienced Texas oil and gas attorney who could have requested the directional\n\nsurvey from Samson. But he did not do that either.\n\n        Furthermore, Hooks could have reviewed publicly-available records.\n\n“[F]ilings and other materials publicly available from the Railroad Commission are\n\na ready source of information….” HECI, 982 S.W.2d at 887. “As owners of an\n\ninterest in the mineral estate, [Plaintiffs] had some obligation to exercise\n\nreasonable diligence in protecting their interests.” Id. at 886.10 The Texas\n\n\n\n10\n  The Supreme Court fraud holdings were limited to the limitations issue. 457 S.W.3d at 61. Its\nholdings and other statements do not assert Plaintiffs did not have access to the Railroad\n                                              43\n\fAdministrative Code requires a directional survey be filed at the Railroad\n\nCommission.11 16 Tex. Admin. Code §3.11 (2015). Parties are presumed to know\n\nthe law. See Greater Houston Transp. Co. v. Phillips, 801 S.W.2d 523, 525 n.3\n\n(Tex. 1990) (“all persons are presumed to know the law.”).\n\n       In accordance with Railroad Commission requirements, a directional survey\n\nhad been filed with the Railroad Commission six months before Lanoue contacted\n\nHooks. DX5. Hooks could have used it to determine (or have someone determine)\n\nthe well’s precise bottom hole location. DX5; 12RR:80; 16RR:53-54, 72, 85-86,\n\n102-03. A plat (the “Schlumberger plat”) was filed along with the survey. DX13.\n\nAlthough “some data on the plat does not completely correspond to the data on a\n\nlater correct plat,” the Supreme Court noted “the plat correctly placed the bottom\n\nhole within the protected zone.” 457 S.W.3d at 56 n. 4. In fact, the Schlumberger\n\nplat shows the location of the well’s bottom hole as being only slightly further\n\naway from Plaintiffs’ lease than the 1080 feet originally planned. Thus, Plaintiffs\n\nhad access to official records showing the well’s bottom hole was within 1320 feet\n\nof Plaintiffs’ lease.\n\n       There is legally and factually insufficient evidence of a failure to disclose.\n\n\n\nCommission records for purposes of a duty to disclose or that Plaintiffs did not have “an equal\nopportunity to discover the truth.”\n11\n   A directional (or inclination) survey is “[a] well survey that measures the degree of departure\nof a hole from the vertical and the direction of the departure.” 8 H. WILLIAMS & C. MEYERS, OIL\nAND GAS LAW 265 (2008).\n\n                                               44\n\fC.    There is Legally and Factually Insufficient Evidence of Statutory Fraud\n      In Question No. 2, the jury found Samson violated Tex. Bus. & Com. Code\n\n§27.01(a), which proscribes fraud in a real estate transaction. That statute is a form\n\nof penalty and is strictly construed. Porter v. Irvine, 658 S.W.2d 711, 715 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1983, no writ); Ratcliff v. Trenholm, 596 S.W.2d 645,\n\n650 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1980, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n      1.     Statutory fraud does not apply to this case because there is no real\n             estate transaction of the type required by that statute\n      The May 25, 2001 consent to pooling did not effect a sale of real estate.\n\nRather, it granted consent for Samson to pool a mineral interest Samson already\n\nheld under Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County Lease. The agreement did not involve a\n\ntransaction within §27.01.\n\n      Texas courts hold §27.01 is limited to misrepresentations made to induce\n\nanother into a contract “for the sale of land or stock.” Burleson State Bank v.\n\nPlunkett, 27 S.W.3d 605, 611 (Tex. App.—Waco 2000, pet. denied) (emphasis\n\nadded); Nolan v. Bettis, 577 S.W.2d 551, 556 (Tex. Civ. App.—1979, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.). The statute does not apply where there is “no sale of real estate … as\n\ncontemplated by the statute.” Life Ins. Co. v. Murray Inv. Co., 646 F.2d 224, 227\n\nn.2 (5th Cir. 1981). Here, there was no such sale. Samson gained a limited power\n\nto pool a mineral estate it already owned as lessee.\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f      2.     There is legally and factually insufficient evidence of the elements of\n             statutory fraud\n\n      For the same reasons there was legally and factually insufficient evidence of\n\ncommon law fraud, the evidence was equally lacking as to statutory fraud.\n\nStatutory fraud requires proof of a misrepresentation of a material fact, intent to\n\ninduce reliance, and reasonable reliance by the person entering the contract.\n\nSchlumberger Tech. Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171, 182 (Tex. 1997); Petras v.\n\nCriswell, 248 S.W.3d 471, 475 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.); Spethmann v.\n\nAnderson, 171 S.W.3d 680, 688 n.1 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.).\n\n      As with common law fraud, “a representation is not material if it is ‘vague\n\nand indefinite in its nature and terms.’” In re Webber, 350 B.R. 344, 367 (Bankr.\n\nS.D. Tex. 2006); see also Sawyer, 430 S.W.3d at 401; Montgomery Cnty., 965\n\nS.W.2d at 503. The “1400´± Scaled” line was indefinite and could not have been\n\nthe basis of a material representation. See Bradford, 48 S.W.3d at 759; Slagle, 237\n\nS.W.2d at 433-34. Nor could Hooks justifiably rely on the “1400´±” description.\n\nSee Lewis, 343 F.3d at 546-47; Montgomery Cnty., 965 S.W.2d at 503. Likewise,\n\nthere is no and insufficient evidence Samson intended to use the plat to convince\n\nHooks the well was more than 1320 feet from his property. There is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient evidence of a misrepresentation, reliance, or intent to support\n\nthe jury’s finding on Question No. 2.\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f      Since statutory fraud fails, the judgment’s award of expert witness fees and\n\ndeposition costs, which rest on §27.01(e), should be reversed.\n\nD.    There is Factually Insufficient Evidence to Support the Jury’s Finding\n      that Plaintiffs Could Not Have Discovered the Alleged Fraud Claim\n      until April 2007\n      Plaintiffs consented in 2001 to Samson’s pooling of acreage from their\n\nJefferson County lease to form the BSM1 unit. PX65 (agreement), PX157\n\n(consenting again as to interest specified in PX156). Over 5 years later, in\n\nNovember 2006, Plaintiffs joined the already-pending and consolidated Lee and\n\nKlorer actions. 3CR:440; 12RR:165-67; 13RR:50-51. The Lee and Klorer actions\n\ndid not include fraud allegations. 1CR:2, 114; 2CR:297; 3CR:391, 413. Plaintiffs\n\ndid not plead fraud until May 2007, nearly 6 years after Plaintiffs consented to the\n\nunit. 4CR:467, 490-92. The statute of limitations for fraud is four years. Williams\n\nv. Khalaf, 802 S.W.2d 651, 652 (Tex. 1990). Plaintiffs cannot legally prejudice\n\nSamson by sitting on claims for so long.\n\n      With regard to limitations, the jury was asked: “By what date should the\n\nHooks, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discovered the fraud of\n\nSamson?” 19CR:3274. Hooks testified the alleged fraud was “discovered” in\n\nSpring 2007. 12RR:165-67; 13RR:50-51. Initially, the jury answered the\n\nlimitations question: “Hooks Birthday.” 19CR:3274. Hooks had met Paul Simpson,\n\nPlaintiffs’ lead trial lawyer, on Hooks’ birthday in 2006 at a lunch meeting of the\n\n\n                                           47\n\fHouston Bar Association’s Oil Gas and Mineral Law section. 12RR:165-66.\n\nInstructed to clarify their answer, the jury responded “April 2007”—months after\n\nHooks’ birthday. 19CR:3274; 12RR:165-66.\n\n      There is factually insufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that\n\nPlaintiffs should not have discovered facts putting them on notice of the alleged\n\nfraud before April 2007.\n\n      The following testimony is the only evidence touching on why Plaintiffs\n\nsupposedly should not have, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, discovered\n\ntheir fraud claim until 2007:\n\n      Q. Well, at what point in time just generally did you-all, through the\n      discovery process, uncover what had happened to you?\n\n      A. Oh, I think it was in the spring, the following spring that information\n      came out. [12RR:167.]\n                                          ***\n      Q. Now, once—I guess it was in the fall of 2006 when you and Mr.\n      Simpson ran into each other up at the Houston Club, right?\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. And that's the first time that you—or sometime thereafter—and I don't\n      know if it was that day or when—but at some point then you became, you\n      know, unhappy and felt like you had been defrauded, right?\n\n      A. After some further information came to light that that was apparently\n      the situation. [13RR:50-51.]\n\n       That is it: a simple bald-faced statement something came to light sometime\n\nduring the spring of 2007 in discovery. There is no explanation why the claim—\n\n\n                                       48\n\fwhich at least could have been discovered in various separate public records—\n\ncould not have been discovered previously. There is no explanation why discovery\n\nwas needed to find out about the fraud claim. There is no explanation what facts\n\ndiscovery revealed to Plaintiffs that put them on notice of alleged fraud. Nothing.\n\nThere is the bare assertion, and nothing more.\n\n      The fraud claim is based on the location of a well. That well had been in the\n\nsame place since July 2000 when Schlumberger ran the directional survey and\n\nsince August 2000 when Schlumberger filed that survey in the Railroad\n\nCommission records. It is not as if Plaintiffs were dealing with a moving target.\n\nThe well’s bottom-hole location has been in the same place since the summer of\n\n2000. Why it took Plaintiffs nearly seven years to locate the well’s bottom-hole is a\n\nmystery.\n\n      Moreover, the “April 2007” answer is wholly unsupported by the\n\nuncontradicted evidence Plaintiffs, themselves, put in the record. Plaintiffs\n\nacknowledge Samson filed a correct plat in the official public records of both\n\nHardin and Jefferson Counties in January and February 2003. 16RR:13 (Plaintiffs’\n\ncross-examination); PX19. That plat showed the correct bottom-hole location for\n\nthe BSM1 well and was attached to an amended unit designation. 11RR:183-84;\n\n12RR:6-7; 16RR:13; PX19.\n\n\n\n\n                                         49\n\f      So according to Plaintiffs’own evidence, the official public land records of\n\nJefferson County contained correct bottom-hole location information more than\n\nfour years prior to the date Plaintiffs filed their fraud claims.\n\n      Plaintiffs did not introduce a scintilla of evidence regarding why “in the\n\nexercise of reasonable diligence” Hooks should not have discovered the alleged\n\nfraud before April 2007. Plaintiffs provided no explanations or details, but only a\n\nbare assertion of when the alleged fraud was actually discovered, without further\n\nexplanation. Evidence is insufficient when it is only “generalized” and\n\n“conclusory.” Serv. Corp. Int’l v. Guerra, 348 S.W.3d 221, 232 (Tex. 2011). “Bare\n\nassertions” with no accompanying explanation do not provide sufficient evidence\n\nto pass the scintilla threshold. Jelinek v. Casas, 328 S.W.3d 526, 540 (Tex. 2010).\n\n      If Hooks’ testimony were sufficient to establish when facts putting him on\n\nnotice of alleged fraud should have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence, then there is little reason to have limitations in fraud cases. His\n\ntestimony was, in essence, “we discovered the claim when we discovered it.” So\n\nlong as someone testifies a claim was not discovered until it was discovered, then\n\nall fraud claims and all claims subject to the discovery rule will be timely filed.\n\n      The question was “By what date should the Hooks, in the exercise of\n\nreasonable diligence, have discovered the fraud of Samson?” 19CR:3274\n\n(Question 9, emphasis added). There was no evidence concerning the “should” part\n\n\n                                           50\n\fof this inquiry and there was no evidence concerning the “exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence” inquiry. There was only an answer to the unasked and irrelevant\n\nquestion, “when did you happen to discover the alleged fraud?”\n\n       There is factually insufficient evidence to support the jury’s response to\n\nQuestion 9, and this Court should remand for a new trial on the limitations issue.\n\nE.     There is Legally and Factually Insufficient Evidence to Support the\n       Fraud Damages Finding\n       Plaintiffs’ evidence was of a legally incorrect measure of damages. 12 The\n\njudgment for $20,081,638.07 for “damages proximately caused by fraud” should\n\nbe reversed. 19CR:3268 (verdict); 1Supp2CR:6 (judgment). There is no evidence\n\nand factually insufficient evidence to support the jury’s answer to Question 3.\n\n       Leading up to trial, Plaintiffs pleaded, first, that they were not in the BSM1\n\nunit and Samson had breached the Jefferson County lease by not meeting its offset\n\nobligations. 16CR:2756-57. In the alternative, Plaintiffs pleaded that, if they were\n\nin the unit, it was because Samson defrauded them into giving consent.\n\n16CR:2759. The trial court granted Samson’s motions for summary judgment on\n\nPlaintiffs’ offset obligations breach of lease claims. 18CR:3162. That left Plaintiffs\n\nwith only a fraud-in-the-inducement claim. But Plaintiffs continued to seek the\n\nidentical contract measure of damages, even including damages for a well as to\n\n\n12\n  Samson repeatedly objected to Plaintiffs’ use of an incorrect measure of damages. 18CR:3171-\n73, 3200-07, 3232; 19CR:3322-26, 3353-58; 10RR:43-44; 17RR:10-14.\n                                             51\n\fwhich they admitted there was no fraud. So Plaintiffs pursued fraud liability, but\n\nsought breach of contract damages. Awarding judgment for contract damages was\n\nerror. There was no legally or factually sufficient evidence to support the damages\n\nawarded.\n\n      Because Plaintiffs chose to pursue an incorrect measure of damages, there is\n\nno evidence of damages. The damages testimony is based on a flawed\n\nmethodology and is “no evidence” of damages or causation. City of Keller, 168\n\nS.W.3d at 813; Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Helton, 133 S.W.3d 245, 247 (Tex. 2004),\n\nabrogated in part on other grounds, Coastal Oil & Gas Trust v. Garza Energy\n\nTrust, 268 S.W.3d 1, 18-19 (Tex. 2008).\n\n      For all the following reasons, the jury’s fraud damages award was\n\nunsupported and should be reversed and either rendered or remanded:\n\n      1.    Plaintiffs did not prove fraud damages and, instead, proved only the\n            same damages they would have presented for the breach of oil and\n            gas lease claim they previously lost on summary judgment\n      There are two measures of fraud damages for the necessary and usual result\n\nof fraud: (1) out-of-pocket and (2) benefit-of-the-bargain. Baylor Univ. v.\n\nSonnichsen, 221 S.W.3d 632, 636 (Tex. 2007); Fortune Prod. Co. v. Conoco, Inc.,\n\n52 S.W.3d 671, 681 (Tex. 2000). Out-of-pocket damages are restitutionary\n\ndamages that “measure the difference between the value of that which was parted\n\nwith and the value of that which was received.” Sonnichsen, 221 S.W.3d at 636;\n\n\n                                          52\n\fsee also Formosa Plastics Corp. v. Presidio Eng’rs & Contractors, Inc., 960\n\nS.W.2d 41, 49 (Tex. 1998). Benefit-of-the-bargain damages derive from an\n\nexpectancy theory and “evaluate the difference between the value that was\n\nrepresented and the value actually received.” Id. The damages for statutory fraud\n\nare measured in the same way as common law fraud. Scott v. Sebree, 986 S.W.2d\n\n364, 368 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999, pet. denied). Leading up to trial, Plaintiffs\n\npleaded an out-of-pocket damages measure (16CR:2760-61), but the evidence does\n\nnot fit within that measure.\n\n      The charge did not instruct the jury to find either out-of-pocket damages or\n\nbenefit-of-the-bargain damages. 19CR:3268. Instead, it asked only about Plaintiffs’\n\n“lost income.” 19CR:3268. After trial, Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment plainly\n\nadmitted the judgment “is based on contract, i.e., Plaintiffs’ oil and gas leases with\n\nSamson.” 19CR:3281. Plaintiffs elected to present only contract damages to the\n\njury. The judgment rests on fraud liability findings, but on contract damages.\n\n      Calculations that take into account “expected lost profits on a bargain that\n\nwas never made” are not properly a part of an out-of-pocket calculation. Formosa\n\nPlastics, 960 S.W.2d at 49. Plaintiffs’ damages formula was composed entirely of\n\nlost profits in the form of lost income. 19CR:3268. That was the only measure of\n\ndamages asked of the jury. Id. Plaintiffs did not plead for or seek benefit of the\n\nbargain damages.\n\n\n                                         53\n\f       2.     Plaintiffs never pleaded for consequential damages; they only pleaded\n              for out-of-pocket damages\n\n       In their previous briefing to this Court, Plaintiffs argued compensatory\n\nroyalty damages were permissible consequential damages. But, Plaintiffs were\n\nrequired to plead for consequential damages. Tex. R. Civ. P. 56; Burbage, 447\n\nS.W.3d at 261 n.6; Statewide Bank and SN Servicing Corp. v. Keith, 301 S.W.3d\n\n776, 786 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2009, pet. abated). Although Plaintiffs’ petition\n\nmentioned compensatory royalties, it did so only in relation to their out-of-pocket\n\nmeasure of damages. 13 Plaintiffs did not plead for compensatory royalties as\n\nconsequential damages. 16CR:2741-73. In fact, Plaintiffs never mentioned the\n\nterm “consequential damages” or “lost profits” anywhere in their pleading.\n\nAccordingly, they were not entitled to recover consequential damages.\n\n       3.     Plaintiffs were not entitled to consequential damages as a part of an\n              out-of-pocket measure of recovery\n\n       Plaintiffs clearly pled an out-of-pocket measure of recovery. 16CR:2760-61.\n\nOut-of-pocket damages are purely restitutionary. What Plaintiffs submitted to the\n\njury was a lost profits measure of damages, which they now assert were actually\n\nconsequential damages. “Lost profits is not a calculation of out-of-pocket\n\ndamages.” Case Corp. v. Hi-Class Bus. Sys. of Am., Inc., 184 S.W.3d 760, 778-79\n\n\n13\n   They pled: “The Landowners are thus entitled to damages equal to at least the difference\nbetween the value of that with which they parted, and the value they actually received…. Such\ndamages would equal at least the compensatory royalties the Landowners would have been due\nunder the Hooks Jefferson County lease in the absence of any pooling….” 16CR:2760-61.\n                                             54\n\f(Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, pet. denied); accord, Formosa Plastics, 960 S.W.2d at\n\n49-50. Under the out-of-pocket measure Plaintiffs pleaded, they were not entitled\n\nto recover lost profit-compensatory damages.\n\n      4.     Furthermore, Plaintiffs could not seek compensatory damages unless\n             they set aside the pooling agreement, which is something they never\n             sought to do\n      Plaintiffs’ evidence was of an alleged fraud-in-the-inducement claim. They\n\nclaimed Samson supposedly made misrepresentations to convince Plaintiffs to sign\n\na pooling consent they otherwise would not have signed. On their fraud-in-the-\n\ninducement claim, Plaintiffs had a choice. They could stand on the bargain and\n\nrecover fraud damages, or they could seek rescission of their consent to pool. See\n\nFortune Prod., 52 S.W.3d at 676-77. They could not do both. Yet, Plaintiffs never\n\nattempted to set aside the pooling agreement and—to this day—have accepted\n\nsubstantial royalty payments paid to them solely because of that pooling\n\nagreement.\n\n      The problem is Plaintiffs waited too long before suing under their breach of\n\nlease theory; limitations lapsed on that claim. So Plaintiffs could not sue on the\n\nunderlying contract. And, importantly, as the Supreme Court has pointed out,\n\nPlaintiffs cannot sue through fraud to seek their contractual damages if the contract\n\nis unenforceable. Sonnichsen, 221 S.W.3d at 637. Importantly, however, Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\fcannot remain a part of the pooled unit and then pretend for damages purposes that\n\ntheir lease is not a part of the unit. 14\n\n       Plaintiffs had their opportunity to seek a proper measure of damages. They\n\nrefused to do so. Having had that opportunity, and having failed to prove damages\n\nunder a correct legal measure, this Court should render judgment against Plaintiffs.\n\nSee, e.g., Goldman v. Olmstead, 414 S.W.3d 346, 363-64 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2013, pet. denied).\n\n       5.     Plaintiffs were not entitled to their compensatory royalty damages\n              based on production from the DuJay1 well\n\n       Even if consequential damages were permitted, “lost profits” based on the\n\nDuJay1 well are not recoverable. The DuJay1 well is the source of half the $20\n\nmillion in fraud damages. When asked at trial, Hooks flatly admitted no one had\n\ndone “anything to deceive [him] or defraud [him] with respect to the DuJay1 well.”\n\n13RR:53.\n\n       Samson contacted Plaintiffs about pooling their lease into the BSM1 unit in\n\nFebruary 2001, and Plaintiffs consented to pool in May 2001. PX65. Plaintiffs\n\nreceived their first check for unit production in September 2001. PX552. Samson\n\ndid not begin drilling the DuJay1 well until October 2001. PX565. The proximate\n\ncause standard applicable to consequential damages requires proof of cause in fact\n\n14\n  Because Plaintiffs did not set aside their pooling consent, they should receive no damages. At\na minimum, however, Samson should receive credit for the payments it has been making to\nPlaintiffs on the BSM1 unit since the time of Plaintiffs’ damages calculations for trial.\n                                              56\n\fand forseeability. IHS Cedars Treatment Ctr. v. Mason, 143 S.W.3d 794, 798-99\n\n(Tex. 2004); see also Fazio v. Cypress/GR Houston I, L.P., 403 S.W.3d 390 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, pet. denied) (damages measured at the time of the\n\nfraud, not some future time). If the initial act merely creates a condition by which\n\nthe second act could occur, the resulting harm is not a cause in fact. IHS, 143\n\nS.W.3d at 799. Here, there would have to be evidence Samson would have drilled\n\nthe DuJay1 well (1) even if Plaintiffs had not agreed to pool; (2) within 1320 feet\n\nof Plaintiffs’ tract; and (3) not released Plaintiffs’ tract to address offset issues. 15\n\nSee Lee & Lee Int’l, Inc. v. Lee, 261 F. Supp. 2d 665, 677 (N.D. Tex. 2003); see\n\nalso Tracy v. Annie’s Attic, Inc., 840 S.W.2d 527, 537 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1992,\n\nwrit denied). There was no evidence of these things.\n\n       It was error to award damages based on the DuJay1 well and this Court\n\nshould reverse the judgment for fraud damages.\n\n       6.     The fraud damages improperly include “late charges” of 18%\n              compounded monthly\n\n       Approximately two-thirds of Plaintiffs’ fraud damages—an astonishing $13\n\nmillion—are not actual damages at all. Instead, that sum is a “late charge”\n\nmeasured at the rate of 18% compounded monthly. PX608. Those charges are\n\n\n15\n   Samson was authorized under Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease at any time to release “any\nportion or portions” of the lease “and be relieved of all obligations as to the acreage\nsurrendered….” PX25¶IV(B). This was not tied to the offset obligations paragraph. So, if\nSamson had known any of its well locations were a problem for Plaintiffs, Samson could have\nreleased all or a portion of Plaintiffs’ lease.\n                                             57\n\fimproper and the fraud damages judgment should be reversed on that ground as\n\nwell.\n\n        Plaintiffs’ “late charge” damages are another way in which Plaintiffs are\n\nattempting to convert their barred contract case into fraud damages. The Jefferson\n\nCounty lease states: “All past due royalties (including any compensatory royalties\n\npayable under Paragraph VI.B) shall be subject to a Late Charge based on the\n\namount due and calculated at the maximum rate allowed by law….”                            PX25\n\n¶XVII(C) (emphasis added).\n\n        “Late charges” are not proper out-of-pocket damages. 16 The “late charges”\n\nshould not be included in Plaintiffs’ fraud damages. Those charges were a part of\n\nPlaintiffs’ breach of lease claim they lost on summary judgment. Those charges are\n\nnot part of any fraud claim. With a fraud claim, the aggrieved party can seek\n\nprejudgment interest, not “late charges.” And the prejudgment interest is to be\n\nassessed by the court, not the jury. See Olympia Marble & Granite v. Mayes, 17\n\nS.W.3d 437, 441 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n\n        Moreover, the Supreme Court directly addressed this issue. The Court\n\nrestricted the 18% interest rate to “past due royalties” and held that rate could not\n\napply to other claims:\n16\n   Because Plaintiffs did not seek consequential damages at all in connection with their fraud\nclaims, they did not plead for late charges as fraud consequential damages. Although Plaintiffs\npleaded for late charges as a part of their contract claims, they never pled for late charges as a\npart of their fraud claim. 16CR:2753 (contract), 2757-58 (contract); 2765 (interest and attorneys’\nfees under Natural Resources Code), 2771 (maximum damages).\n                                               58\n\f      The leases only impose “the maximum [interest] rate allowed by law”\n      for past-due royalties. Accordingly, to the extent Hooks recovers for\n      past due royalties, he is entitled to an 18% interest rate. For other\n      recoveries, the statutory rate of 5% applies because Hooks has not\n      directed us to any portion of the leases providing otherwise.\n\n457 S.W.3d at 69-70.\n\n      Regardless how Plaintiffs measured their alleged fraud damages, those\n\ndamages are damages for fraud, not breach of lease. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ fraud\n\ncause of action is an “other recovery” for which “the statutory rate of 5% applies.”\n\n457 S.W.3d at 70. As it stands, there is no (and insufficient) evidence of any fraud\n\ndamages. But, if any portion of Plaintiffs’ fraud damages survive, the trial court\n\nmust be restricted to adding 5% simple prejudgment interest to those damages.\n\nAnd the post-judgment interest would also be 5%.\n\n      7.    The damages have to be reversed because they include incremental\n            formation production damages, which the Supreme Court held were\n            improper\n      The fraud damages included Plaintiffs’ formation production damages\n\nwithin the damages calculation. The exhibit on which the jury based its damages\n\nwas PX608. That exhibit calculated fraud damages as $20,081,638.07. PX608. The\n\njury awarded precisely that amount: $20,081,638.07. 19CR:3268. PX608 is titled\n\n“Summary of Lost Compensatory Royalty with Incremental Formation\n\nProduction.” So, the jury’s damages award included formation production\n\namounts.\n\n\n                                        59\n\f      The Supreme Court held this Court was correct in determining Plaintiffs\n\nwere not entitled to formation production damages. 457 S.W.3d at 64-65. As a\n\nconsequence, the fraud damages must be reversed for improperly including\n\nformation production damages.\n\n      8.     If this Court reverses and remands for a new trial on fraud damages,\n             then fraud liability will have to be retried as well\n\n      Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1 dictates, if this Court orders a new trial on\n\ndamages, it must also order a new trial on liability:\n\n      (b) Error Affecting Only Part of Case. If the error affects part of, but\n      not all, the matter in controversy and that part is separable without\n      unfairness to the parties, the judgment must be reversed and a new\n      trial ordered only as to the part affected by the error. The court may\n      not order a separate trial solely on unliquidated damages if liability is\n      contested.\n\nTex. R. App. P. 44.1(b) (emphasis added). There is a companion rule for the\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court. See Tex. R. App. P. 61.2. There is no question this\n\nrule means what it says. “Failure to comply with this rule is reversible error.”\n\nRancho La Valencia, Inc. v. Aquaplex, Inc., 383 S.W.3d 150, 152 (Tex. 2012).\n\n      There is no question here damages are unliquidated and liability is contested.\n\nThat being the case, if this Court reverses for a new trial on damages, it must also\n\nremand for a new trial on fraud liability.\n\n\n\n\n                                             60\n\fF.    The Court Must Also Remand the Favored Nations Damages for a\n      Recalculation and Should Determine Issues Regarding the Application\n      of Prejudgment Interest to Newly Awarded Favored Nations Damages\n      As with the fraud damages, the favored nations damages wrongly include\n\nformation production damages. The judgment awards a total of $848,854 for the\n\nfavored nations claim. 1Supp2dCR:6. The parties had stipulated to different\n\namounts in accordance with whether formation production damages should be\n\nincluded with the favored nations damages. Court ExA. The amount in the\n\njudgment includes formation production. Id. The stipulation for favored nations\n\ndamages without formation production was $431,450.71. Id. As a result, the\n\njudgment needs to be reversed on this ground as well.\n\n      It can be expected that Plaintiffs will request that their favored nations\n\ndecimal increases be paid to them for production occurring after the end of May\n\n2008. Furthermore, should this Court reverse and render judgment on the fraud\n\nportion of the case, Plaintiffs will also seek favored nations damages on the BSM1\n\nwell because favored nations damages were initially included in their fraud\n\ndamages.\n\n      In the trial of this action, Plaintiffs relied on the late payments provision to\n\ncalculate their prejudgment interest. That provision states:\n\n      All past due royalties (including any compensatory royalties payable\n      under Paragraph VI.B) shall be subject to a Late Charge based on the\n      amount due and calculated at the maximum rate allowed by law\n      commencing on the day after the last day on which such monthly\n\n                                          61\n\f      royalty payment could have been timely made and for every calendar\n      month and/or fraction thereof from the due date until paid, plus\n      attorney’s fees, court costs, and other costs in connection with the\n      collection of the unpaid amounts. Any Late Charge that may become\n      applicable shall be due and payable on the last day of each month\n      when this provision becomes applicable.\n\nPX25, PX 26, PX27¶XVII(C). The Supreme Court held this language set an\n\ninterest rate of 18% for past due royalties, but “only” for past due royalties.\n\n      Plaintiffs assumed previously the late payment provision meant they would\n\nreceive 18% prejudgment interest compounded monthly as prejudgment interest.\n\nBut there is nothing in the late payment provision saying that. And there is nothing\n\nin the Supreme Court’s decision saying that either.\n\n      Typically, prejudgment interest is computed as simple interest. Johnson &\n\nHiggins of Texas, Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d 507, 532 (Tex. 1998)\n\n(prejudgment interest is calculated as simple interest). The question is whether\n\nthere is anything in the leases changing the simple interest rate for prejudgment\n\ninterest. The answer is “no.”\n\n      Another appellate court has previously decided this question in Samson’s\n\nfavor. The language of Plaintiffs’ leases is very similar to the contract at issue in\n\nPegasus Energy Grp., Inc. v. Cheyenne Petroleum Co., 3 S.W.3d 112, 123 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1999, no pet.). In Pegasus, the contract provided if a\n\nrequired payment was not timely made, “the unpaid balance shall bear interest\n\nmonthly at the… maximum contract rate permitted by the applicable usury laws in\n                                          62\n\fthe [applicable] state.” Id. (emphasis added). In calculating the prejudgment\n\ninterest due under that contract, the court held Kenneco applied and prejudgment\n\ninterest was to be computed as simple interest. Id. at 124-25.\n\n       When this case is remanded for a recalculation of the favored nations\n\ndamages, the prejudgment interest awarded as to those damages should be simple\n\ninterest.\n\n                             PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n       Appellant Samson prays that the Court will again reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment on the fraud claim and render judgment that Plaintiffs take nothing on\n\ntheir fraud claim. In the alternative, Samson prays that the Court reverse and\n\nremand for a new trial on the fraud liability and fraud damages claims as well as\n\nthe fraud limitations defense.\n\n       In the further alternative, Samson prays that the Court will reform the\n\njudgment to eliminate improper damages awards identified in this brief, including\n\nformation production damages, late charges, fraud damages attributable to the\n\nDuJay 1 well, witness fees, and deposition costs in accordance with Samson’s\n\narguments set out above, and to reduce the prejudgment and postjudgment interest\n\nrate to the proper rate of 5%. Further, this Court should remand for the trial court\n\nto credit Samson for the royalty payments it has made to Plaintiffs based on\n\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\fproduction from the BSM1 unit since the damages were calculated prior to the\n\njudgment.\n\n      Additionally, Samson requests that the favored nations damages be\n\nremanded for a recalculation and that prejudgment interest be assessed on any new\n\ncalculations of favored nations damages using a simple interest rate for\n\nprejudgment interest. Samson further requests its costs and any additional relief to\n\nwhich it may have shown itself entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                           64\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nLOCKE LORD LLP\n\n\n/s/ Cynthia K.

You are the sole judges of the credibility of the\nwitnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, but in matters of law, you must be\ngoverned by the instructions in this charge. In discharging your responsibility on this jury, you\nwill observe all the instructions which have previously been given you. I shall now give you\nadditional instructions which you should carefully and strictly follow during your deliberations.\n\n       1. Do not let bias, prejudice or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n       2. In arriving at your answers, consider only Llie evidence introduced here under oath\n          and such exhibits, if any, as have been introduced for your consideration under the\n          rulings of the court, that is, what you have seen and heard in this courtroom, together\n          with the law as given you by the court. In your deliberations, you will not consider or\n          discuss anything that is not represented by the evidence in this case.\n\n       3. Since every answer that is required by the charge is important, no juror should state or\n          consider that any required answer is not important.\n\n       4. You must not decide who you think should win, and then try to answer the questions\n          accordingly. Simply answer the questions, and do not discuss nor concern yourselves\n          with the effect of your answers.\n\n       5. You will not decide the answer to a question by lot or by drawing straws, or by any\n          other method of chance. Do not return a quotient verdict. A quotient verdict means\n          that the jurors agree to abide by the result to be reached by adding together each\n          juror's figures and dividing by the number of jurors to get an average. Do not do any\n          trading on your answers; that is, one juror should not agree to answer a certain\n          question one way if others will agree to answer another question another way.\n\n       6. Unless otherwise instructed, you may answer a question upon the vote of ten or more\n          jurors. If you answer more than one question upon the vote of ten or more jurors, the\n          same group of at least ten of you must agree upon the answers to each of those\n          questions.\n\f       These instructions are given you because your conduct is subject to review the same as\nthat of the witnesses, parties, attorneys and the judge. If it should be found that you have\ndisregarded any of these instructions, it will be jury misconduct and it may require another trial\nby another jury; then all of our time will have been wasted.\n\n      The presiding juror or any other who observes a violation of the court's instructions shall\nimmediately warn the one who is violating the same and caution the juror not to do so again.\n\n       When words are used in this charge in a sense that varies from the meaning commonly\nunderstood, you are given a proper legal definition, which you are bound to accept in place of\nany other meaning.\n\n        Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to all questions unless otherwise instructed. A \"Yes\" answer must\nbe based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are otherwise instructed. If you do not\nfind that a preponderance of the evidence supports a \"Yes\" answer, then answer \"No.\" The term\n\"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight and degree of credible evidence\nadmitted in this case. Whenever a question requires an answer other than \"Yes\" or \"No,\" your\nanswer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are otherwise instructed.\n\fGeneral Instruction: Circumstantial Evidence\n\n        A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence, or both. A\nfact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or by witnesses\nwho saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established by circumstantial evidence\nwhen it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\nGeneral Instruction: Corporations\n\n        The defendant is a corporation. All persons are equal before the law, and a corporation is\nentitled to the same consideration you give any other person. Certain rules define how\ncorporations act and are held responsible for acts or omissions:\n\n       A corporation acts through its officer, agents, and employees. Unless otherwise indicated\n       in this charge, any act or omission of any officer, agent, or employee of any of the\n       defendants is the act or omission of that defendant if it occurred while acting within the\n       scope of his actual or apparent authority in the performance of his duties for that\n       defendant.\n\n       A corporation is held responsible for the knowledge possessed by those people who are\n       its representatives or agents acting within the scope of their actual or apparent authority.\n\nGeneral Instruction: Damages\n\nDamages, if any, must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty. This does not, however,\nrequire proof as to an absolute mathematical certainty. If a wrong has been done from which\nmonetary loss results, you may make a just and reasonable estimate of damages based on\nrelevant data, including opinion evidence, even if the extent of the injury cannot be proven\nprecisely. Damages cannot be remote or contingent.\n\nIn answering questions about damages, answer each question separately. Do not increase or\nreduce the amount in one answer because of the instructions in or your answers to any other\nquestions about damages. Do not speculate about what any party's ultimate recovery may or may\nnot be. Any recovery will be determined by the court when it applies the law to your answers at\nthe time of judgment.\n\fDEFINITIONS, QUESTIONS, AND SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\n     The \"Hooks\" means Plaintiffs Charles G.

The 60th\nDistrict Court, Jefferson County, Gary Sanderson, J., granted lessee partial summary judgment and entered a jury verdict in\nfavor of lessors on remaining claims.\n\n\n\nHoldings: On cross appeals, and on rehearing, the Court of Appeals, Evelyn V. Keyes, J., held that:\n\n[1] lessors' fraud claims concerning the pooling of interests accrued under discovery rule no later than date when information\nconcerning actual location of bottom hole of disputed well was a matter of public record;\n\n[2] lessors accepted and ratified the amendment and redesignation of original unit into pooled units;\n\n[3] the most favored nations clauses in leases did not apply to trigger royalties payable to the lessors equal to those payable\nunder settlement agreement reached between lessee and State;\n\n[4] formation production clause in leases did not operate to double the amount of royalties owed on the liquid condensate\nproduced from well;\n\n[5] trial court abused its discretion by including permanent injunctive relief in its order;\n\n[6] a stipulated payment of ad valorem taxes by lessee did not entitle lessors to claim attorney fees as prevailing parties under\na separate pre-trial fee stipulation; and\n\n[7] postjudgment interest on ad valorem taxes that lessee was obligated to pay pursuant to stipulation was to be calculated\nbased on statutory rate.\n\n\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

KEYES, Justice.\n\nFollowing the issuance of our March 1, 2012 opinion and judgment on rehearing, appellant, Samson Lone Star, Limited\nPartnership n/k/a Samson Lone Star L.L.C. (“Samson”), moved for further rehearing on issues relating to the supersede as bond\nand surety. Appellees, Charles G. Hooks, et al. (“the Hooks”), moved for further rehearing asking this Court to clarify its ruling\nregarding post judgment interest. Subsequently, on April 16, 2012, the Hooks moved for en banc reconsideration of our March\n1, 2012 opinion. We grant both motions for rehearing, withdraw our opinion and judgment of March 1, 2012, and issue this\nopinion and judgment in their stead. We dismiss the Hooks' April 16, 2012 motion for en banc reconsideration as moot. 2\n\n2      See Brookshire Bros., Inc. v. Smith, 176 S.W.3d 30, 40 & n. 2 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. denied).\nThis is an appeal from a final judgment against Samson for more than $21 million in favor of the Hooks. Samson has a number\nof oil and gas leases from landowners in Hardin and Jefferson Counties, including the Hooks. The judgment arises from an oil\nand gas case in which the Hooks brought suit against Samson with respect to three oil and gas leases, two in Hardin County,\nTexas (the “95–acre Lease” and the “10–acre Lease,” collectively the “Hardin County Leases”) and one in Jefferson County,\nTexas (the “Jefferson County Lease”). The Hooks sued Samson for breach of contract, fraud, fraudulent concealment, statutory\nfraud, negligent misrepresentation, violation of the Texas Natural Resources Code by failure to properly pay royalties, statutory\nnegligence, common law negligence per se, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment.\n\nThe trial court granted Samson's motion for partial summary judgment on whether it had breached certain offset obligations\nunder the Leases. It also granted the Hooks' motions for summary judgment on claims for additional royalties related to their\nclaims of “unpooling” with respect to the Hardin County Leases and breach of the “most favored nations” clause in both Hardin\nCounty Leases and the Jefferson County Lease.\n\nThe questions of whether Samson committed fraud against the Hooks with respect to a well drilled within the buffer zone of the\nHooks' Jefferson County Lease *416 and whether it underpaid royalties by not paying royalties for “formation production”\nin all three Leases were tried to a jury. The trial court rendered judgment on the verdict, holding Samson liable to the Hooks\nfor fraud and underpaid royalties, and it entered a final judgment that left intact the summary judgment in Samson's favor on\noffset obligations and the summary judgments in favor of the Hooks on their unpooling claim and their most favored nations\nclause claims. Samson has appealed the final judgment, and the Hooks have cross-appealed.\n\nIn eight issues, Samson complains that (1) there is legally and factually insufficient evidence of common law fraud; (2) there\nis legally and factually insufficient evidence of statutory fraud; (3) the statute of limitations bars the Hooks' fraud claims; (4)\nthere is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding on fraud damages; (5) the trial court erred in\ninterpreting the phrase “formation production” in the Hooks' Leases as requiring Samson to pay twice for molecules of gas\nproduced as condensate; (6) the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the Hooks for additional royalties based on\nthe unpooling issue with respect to the Hardin County Leases and on the most favored nations clauses in all three Leases; (7)\nthe trial court erred in elevating lease provisions into a permanent injunction, and there is no evidence to support the injunction\nor attorney's fees; and (8) the trial court erred by granting post-judgment interest at the rate of 18%, compounded annually. 3\n\n3      This issue was added at Samson's request by order dated June 10, 2010, and both parties were required to and did file supplemental\n       briefs thereon.\nIn a single issue, the Hooks complain on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment in favor of\nSamson on the issue of whether Samson breached certain offset obligations in the Hooks' leases.

SAMSON'S APPEAL\n\n\n                                                          A. BACKGROUND\n\n1. The Hooks' Jefferson County Lease and the BSM No. 1 Unit\nIn 1999, the Hooks entered into the Jefferson County Lease with Samson. This lease covered 640 acres owned by the Hooks\nin the Dyches survey in Jefferson County, Texas and was bordered by Pine Island Bayou, which also serves as the county line\nbetween Jefferson and Hardin Counties.\n\nArticle VI of the Jefferson County Lease was a section called “Offset Obligations.” In this section, Samson covenanted to\noperate the leased premises as a reasonably prudent operator would and to protect the leased premises from drainage. Article\nVI also contained specific obligations for Samson in case of potential drainage. This Article provided that if a gas well were\ncompleted within 1,320 feet from the leased premises, then, within 90 days from the date of the sale of first production from that\nwell, Samson must take one of three actions: (1) drill an offset well; (2) pay the Hooks “compensatory royalties”—in addition\nto any royalties currently due—in a sum equal to the royalties that would be payable under the *417 Lease on the production\nfrom the adjacent or nearby producing well as if it had been producing on the leased premises; or (3) release the offset acreage. 4\nThe Jefferson County Lease did not provide for pooling.\n\n4      Article VI(A) of the Jefferson County Lease provided, in pertinent part, as follows:\n            [I]n the event a well producing from a unit not comprised of acreage from the leased premises ... which has been classified as\n            “gas” ... is completed on adjacent or nearby lands not more than one thousand three hundred and twenty feet (1,320′) from the\n            leased premises, or draining the leased premises, Lessee covenants and agrees to, within ninety (90) days from the date production\n            is first sold, removed or otherwise marketed from said adjacent or nearby producing well, either (1) commence with due diligence\n            operations for the actual drilling of an offset well on the leased premises to the base of the formation from which the adjacent\n            or nearby producing well is producing, (2) pay Lessors as compensatory royalty, in addition to any royalties currently due, a\n            sum equal to the royalties which would be payable under this lease on the production from said adjacent or nearby producing\n            well had same been producing on the leased premises, or (3) in lieu of drilling such offset well or paying such compensatory\n            royalty, release by recordable instrument the offset acreage, as hereinafter defined. “Offset Acreage,” as used hereinabove, shall\n            be defined as a unit which would surround such a well if same were completed on the leased premises; provided, however, that\n            if any portion of the offset acreage would be included in a producing unit designated by Lessee hereunder, then if Lessee elects\n            to surrender and release such offset acreage, it may retain and except from such release the producing stratum or strata included\n            in such producing unit, but such offset acreage must conform to the depth, size and shape limitations contained in Paragraph\n            V. herein. The provisions hereof shall apply regardless of whether lands upon which offset wells may be located are owned\n            by Lessor or any of them or not, and with regard to wells located within the hereinabove prescribed distances from the leased\n            premises, regardless of whether drainage is actually proved to be taking place or not. Notwithstanding anything herein to the\n            contrary, Lessee shall have no obligations under this Article VI in the event a producing well on nearby or adjacent land is\n            already offset by a well on the leased premises or on acreage pooled therewith producing from the same producing horizon from\n            which production has been secured from any well on nearby or adjacent lands.\nIn April 2000, Samson began drilling a gas well, the Black Stone Minerals No. 1 (the “BSM No. 1 well”), on a tract it owned\nin Hardin County adjacent to the Hooks' 640–acre Jefferson County Lease. This adjacent tract was located in Hardin County.\nThe surface drillsite was outside the 1,320–foot buffer zone around the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease that triggered Samson's\noffset obligations under Article VI(A) of the Lease. However, the well was a directional well that slanted away from the surface\ndrillsite. Originally, the BSM No. 1 well was planned with a bottom hole location 1,080 feet from the Hooks' lease line on\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                       18\n\fSamson Lone Star, Ltd. Partnership v. Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nthe east, a location within the 1,320–foot buffer zone of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease. This proposed well location was\nreflected on a plat titled “Proposed Well Location [BSM No.]1 Walker Pettitt League, A–43, Hardin County, Texas,” which\nwas prepared and signed by a third-party surveyor on March 22, 2000. The surveyor certified that “this is a true and correct plat\nbased on a ground survey made under my supervision on March 22, 2000.” This plat was filed with the Railroad Commission\nof Texas (“Railroad Commission”).\n\nThe March 22, 2000 plat showed a 704–acre gas pooling unit (the “BSM No. 1 unit”) designated by Samson that ran along\nPine Island Bayou, the Hardin County/Jefferson County line, on the east. This line was also the western boundary of the tract\ncontaining the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease. The Hooks and their co-owners of the tract on which their Jefferson *418\nCounty Lease was located were not named as lessors in the table shown on the plat of the designated unit. An arrow shown on\nthe plat pointed to the location of the proposed bottom hole about at the beginning of a line that ran to the eastern line of the\nunit at Pine Island Bayou, the county line. Notations on the plat stated:\n\n  The Proposed Surface Location is:\n\n  630′ FSL x 1600′ FEL Survey\n\n  2750′± Scaled FWL x 3834′ FNL Unit.\n\n  The Proposed Bottom Hole Location is:\n\n  330′ FSL x 330′ FEL Survey\n\n  870′± Scaled FSL x 1080′± Scaled′ FEL Unit.\n\nIt is undisputed that “FSL” meant “From the Southern Line” of the Walker Pettitt Survey, “FNL” meant “From the Northern\nLine” of the Survey, and “FEL” meant “From the Eastern Line” of the Survey, which was the Hardin County/Jefferson County\nline at Pine Island Bayou. Thus, in this notation, the surface location of the BSM No. 1 well was 1,600 feet from the eastern line\nof the survey at Pine Island Bayou, and the proposed bottom hole location was about 1,080 feet from the eastern line, which\nmarked the western line of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease. The proposed bottom hole was therefore within the 1,320–foot\nbuffer zone for the Jefferson County Lease.\n\nAlthough the March 22, 2000 plat of the designated BSM No. 1 unit estimated the location of the proposed bottom hole location\nof the BSM No. 1 well, the exact bottom hole location of the well, following drilling, could only be ascertained from a directional\nsurvey. This survey was completed in July 2000 and was also filed with the Railroad Commission. Both parties agree that the\nsurvey showed the BSM No. 1 well to be bottomed 1,184 feet from the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease, within the 1,320–foot\nbuffer zone of the Lease. Thus, Samson had an obligation under the terms of the “Offset Obligations” in the Hooks' Jefferson\nCounty Lease to (1) drill an offset well, (2) pay the Hooks “compensatory royalties,” or (3) release the “offset acreage” within\n90 days from the date production was first “sold, removed, or otherwise marketed” from the well.\n\nThe BSM No. 1 well was completed in August 2000, and the first gas sales occurred in late October 2000. Because the bottom\nhole of the well was within the 1,320–foot buffer zone of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease, the first gas sales triggered\nSamson's offset obligations under the terms of the Lease. The Hooks complain, and the jury found, however, that Samson did\nnot follow the provisions in Article VI(A) of the Jefferson County Lease, which provided that, within 90 days of the first sale of\ngas from a well within its buffer zone, Samson must drill an offset well, pay the Hooks compensatory royalties, or release the\noffset acreage. Instead, the jury found that Samson attempted to avoid those obligations by seeking to pool the Hooks' interest\nin the production from the BSM No. 1 well with those of other mineral owners, despite the lack of pooling authority in the\nJefferson County Lease, while concealing the bottom hole location of the BSM No. 1 well.\n\nIn December 2000, Samson filed a P–12 “Pooling Authority” form with the Railroad Commission that reflected a reconfigured\nBSM No. 1 pooling unit. By letter, Samson informed the Commission that a portion of the 704 acres in the original BSM\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nNo. 1 unit was to be put into a separate 308.41–acre pooling unit for the proposed Black Stone Minerals No. A–1 well (the\n“BSM A–1 well”). Attached to the letter was a “Certificate of Pooling Authority,” which represented the Broussard tract, on\nwhich the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease lay, as one of the tracts whose mineral-rights owners either had *419 given Samson\npooling authority under an instrument currently in effect or had pooled their interests into the reconfigured BSM No. 1 unit.\nAlso attached was a plat of the redesignated704–acre pooling unit dated November 16, 2000 and certified by Samson's land\nman, Glenn Lanoue.\n\nThe arrows pointing to the surface and bottom hole locations on the November 16 plat of the redesignated BSM No. 1 unit were\nthe same as those pointing to the proposed surface and bottom hole locations on the original March 22, 2000 plat of the unit.\nHowever, the acreage of the unit had been changed to show a different 704–acre configuration for the BSM No. 1 unit from that\noriginally filed with the Railroad Commission. The redesignated BSM No. 1 unit, unlike the previously designated BSM No.\n1 unit, extended beyond the eastern line of Hardin County at Pine Island Bayou into Jefferson County. The certificate, signed\nby Lanoue, stated that “this is a true and correct plat based on the best of my knowledge November 16, 2000.”\n\nOn February 15, 2001, Samson sent the Hooks a letter offering to pool 50 acres covered by the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease\ninto there designated BSM No. 1 gas pooling unit for the BSM No. 1 well. Attached to the letter was a copy of the plat of the\nreconfigured unit Samson had filed with the Railroad Commission in December 2000.\n\nOn February 20, 2001, before accepting Samson's offer to pool—which would require amendment of Article VI of the Hooks'\nJefferson County Lease to permit pooling—Charles Hooks, the landowner and an attorney who had participated in a number\nof oil and gas deals, called Lanoue and sought more information. Charles Hooks inquired about the BSM No. 1 well's location\nand about how his property fit in the unit. Lanoue told him that the well was about 1,500 feet away from Pine Island Bayou,\nthe boundary between Hardin and Jefferson Counties and the western line of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease.\n\nHooks requested a plat showing where his acreage would lie within the proposed reconfigured BSM No. 1 unit. That same\nday, Lanoue sent Hooks the scaled plat of the redesignated BSM No. 1 pooling unit that Samson had filed with the Railroad\nCommission in December 2000. This plat was certified by Lanoue as “a true and correct plat based on the best of my knowledge\nDecember 28, 2000.” A number of changes had been made to the March 22, 2000 plat showing the original BSM No. 1 gas\npooling unit to reflect the redesignated unit. The plat of the reconfigured unit had different boundaries extending further west\nand also further east into Jefferson County, encompassing part of the Broussard tract on the east that had not been included in the\noriginal unit designation. The plat had been highlighted to show the location of the Hooks' 50 acres east of Pine Island Bayou.\n\nLike the March 2000 plat of the original BSM No. 1 unit, the plat of the redesignated BSM No. 1 unit contained the arrow\npointing to the location of the bottom hole, but it gave slightly changed coordinates from those of the proposed bottom hole\nof the BSM No. 1 well on the March 2000 plat. At trial, Lanoue testified that he changed these coordinates with a ruler. Also,\ninstead of a line running from the proposed bottom hole location and showing ±1,080 feet to the eastern line of the unit at Pine\nIsland Bayou, the plat showed a different line to the bayou with an undesignated starting point. The plat also showed an eastern\nborder of the reconfigured BSM No. 1 unit beyond the bayou and encompassing a portion of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease.\nAbove the line was the designation “±1400#.” An arrow stating *420 “BHL” and giving the well coordinates pointed to a\npoint on the line about one quarter of the way from the western starting point of the line to the eastern end of the line at the\nbayou. Thus, if the designation “±1400#” were interpreted as the distance from the bottom hole to the bayou, the bottom hole\nof the BSM No. 1 well would be outside the 1,320 foot buffer zone for the Jefferson County Lease. However, if the “±1400#”\ndesignation were interpreted as the distance from the undesignated starting point of the line to the bayou and the arrow one-\nquarter of the way along it were interpreted as the bottom hole location, the bottom hole of the well would be within the buffer\nzone of the Hooks' Lease, triggering Samson's offset obligations under Article VI(A) of the Jefferson County Lease.\n\nIn addition, the plat stated:\n\n  The Bottom Hole Location is:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\n\n  290′ FSL x 740′ FEL Survey\n\n  500′ Scaled FNL x 1400′± Scaled′ FEL Unit.\n\nThis language in the plat thus expressly stated that the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well was located about 1,400 feet from\nthe eastern line of the redesignated BSM No. 1 unit, which encompassed the Hooks' 50 acres from their Jefferson County Lease\nbetween Pine Island Bayou and the eastern edge of the redesignated unit. According to this notation, the bottom hole of the\nBSM No. 1 well was within 1,320 feet of the “leased premises,” and, therefore, inside the buffer zone for the Hooks' Jefferson\nCounty Lease\n\nLanoue testified at trial that he added the notation that showed the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well to be ±1,400 feet from the\neastern line of the unit in August 2000 to reflect the newly shaped unit. He also testified that he got the notation “740 feet from\nthe east line and 290 feet from the south line” “from myself.” He did not go to the directional survey which had been previously\ncompleted to determine the exact location of the bottom hole. However, he intended the numbers to be “[a]s accurate as a land\nguy is using a ruler on a scaled piece of paper that might not even be to scale.”\n\nHooks testified at trial, however, that Lanoue orally told him that the BSM No. 1 well was 1,500 feet from Pine Island Bayou.\nHe then looked at the plat and concluded that the bottom hole location was approximately 1,400 feet west of Pine Island Bayou\nand thus outside the line that would have triggered the 1,320 foot offset provisions in the Jefferson County Lease. He made\nno other inquiries regarding the plat or the bottom hole of the well, and he did not check the records filed with the Railroad\nCommission to determine the exact location of the bottom hole.\n\nAfter making the pooling offer to the Hooks, Lanoue executed the designation of the BSM No. 1 pooling unit in February 2001\nand recorded it in the county's real property records on March 7, 2001, showing the Hooks as participating in the pool for the\nBSM No. 1 unit. However, the Hooks did not actually consent to pool the 50 acres from their Jefferson County Lease into the\nBSM No. 1 unit until May 25, 2001, and they conditioned their assent on a formal amendment to the lease which they were\nto prepare and submit to Samson. The Hooks did not prepare the formal amendment, however, and the parties never executed\nsuch an amendment. Instead, the Hooks agreed to a division order setting out their percentage distribution of the unit's proceeds,\nwhich stated that Samson would pay the Hooks royalties based on a stated percentage of their acreage in the unit to the entire\nacreage of the BSM No. 1 unit unless notified otherwise in writing.\n\n *421 After the Hooks agreed to be included in the BSM No. 1 unit, Samson sent royalty checks to them for their unit interest\ncontinuing through the time of trial, and the Hooks cashed the royalty checks. However, the royalty checks did not include\nadditional compensatory royalties calculated under the terms of Article VI of the Hooks' Lease for a well drilled within the\n1,320–foot buffer zone of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease.\n\nAfter the Hooks agreed to pool 50 acres of their Jefferson County Lease into the BSM No. 1 unit, Samson drilled a second well,\nthe Joyce DuJay No. 1 well (“DuJay No. 1 well”), within the 1,320–foot buffer zone of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease.\nThat well was completed in January 2002 and made part of another pooling unit, the DuJay No. 1 unit, in which the Hooks\nalso participated and from which they received royalties. This well was offset by the BSM No. 1 unit. Hooks testified that he\nwas not defrauded with respect to the DuJay No. 1 unit.\n\n\n2. The Hooks' Hardin County Leases, the BSM A–1 Well and Pooling Unit, and the Hooks' “Unpooling” Claim\nIn addition to their Jefferson County Lease, the Hooks also owned two leases in Hardin County near the BSM No. 1 well, the\n95–acre and 10–acre Hardin County Leases. Unlike the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease, these Leases did provide for pooling\nin terms that were essentially the same with respect to the manner and methods of pooling.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nThe Hardin County Leases both contained language calling for an instrument “identifying and describing the pooled acreage”\nand stating that a “pooled unit shall become effective on the date such instrument or instruments are so filed for record.” Article\nV(E) of the pooling provision in each Lease also stated that production from any part of a pooled unit that included the leased\npremises was considered production from the leased premises “regardless of whether ... such production was secured before\nor after the date of this lease or the date of the instrument designating the pooled unit.” The 95–acre Lease provided in Article\nV(E) as follows:\n\n  E. Lessee [Samson], at its option, is hereby given the right and power in its discretion to pool or combine, as to any one\n  or more formations, the land covered by this Lease or any portion of said land, insofar only as gas or gas condensate\n  rights are concerned ... with other land, lease or leases in the immediate vicinity thereof, except to the extent and in the\n  manner hereinafter stipulated. With respect to any such unit so formed, Lessee shall execute in writing an instrument or\n  instruments identifying and describing the pooled acreage, and file same for recording in the office of the County Clerk in\n  Hardin County, Texas; and the pooled unit shall become effective on the date such instrument or instruments are so filed\n  for record. Notwithstanding anything hereof to the contrary, pooled units created hereunder and comprising all or part of\n  the herein leased premises shall not exceed the maximum acreage figures permitted for all production units of oil or gas\n  wells completed at certain depths under Article V. hereof unless the Railroad Commission of Texas or any governmental\n  authority having and asserting jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof prescribes for the drilling or operation of a well\n  at a regular location, or permits for the obtaining of the maximum allowable from any well to be drilled, drilling, or already\n  drilled, larger pooled units than any of those herein permitted, then any such pooled unit may be established or enlarged to\n  conform to the size either required of a well *422 or permitted for the obtaining of the maximum allowable. For any well\n  drilled on and completed at depths beneath the surface of a tract covered by this lease there shall be no pooling with other\n  lands, unless such tract is insufficient, due to either its lack of size or prior unitization hereunder, to comprise the maximum\n  acreage figures permitted hereunder in which case all of said tract (95 acres more or less) or the then un-unitized portion of\n  same shall be so pooled; and Lessee may include in such pooled unit such other acreage as may be available to comprise the\n  maximum acreage figures permitted under the terms of this lease. For a well drilled on or completed at depths beneath the\n  surface of lands other than the herein leased premises, not less than all (100%) of the lands (95 acres more or less) or the\n  then un-unitized portion of same shall be so pooled; and Lessee may include in such pooled unit such other acreage as may\n  be available to comprise the maximum acreage figures permitted under the terms of this lease.\n\n  Operations for drilling on or production of gas from any part of the pooled unit which includes all or a portion of the Leased\n  Premises, regardless of whether such operations for drilling were commenced or such production was secured before or after\n  the date of this lease or the date of the instrument designating the pooled unit, shall be considered as operations for drilling on\n  or production of gas from the Leased Premises, whether or not the well or wells be located on the Leased Premises, and the\n  entire acreage constituting such unit or units shall be treated for all purposes, except the payment of royalties on production\n  from the pooled unit, as if the same were included in this Lease. The above right and power to pool may be exercised at any\n  time and from time to time and before or after a well has been drilled, or while a well is being drilled. Lessee may vacate\n  any unit formed by it hereunder by instrument in writing filed for record in said county at any time when there is no unitized\n  substance being produced from such unit. The pooling for gas hereunder by Lessee shall also pool and unitize all liquid gas,\n  and the royalty interest payable to Lessor thereon shall be computed the same as on gas. For the purpose of computing the\n  royalties to which owners of royalties shall be entitled on production from each production unit, there shall be allocated to\n  the applicable separate tract acreage included in such production unit a pro rata portion of the production produced from\n  such production unit. Such allocation shall be on an acreage basis; that is to say, there shall be allocated to the applicable\n  separate tract acreage within the unit that pro rata portion of the production produced from the production unit which the\n  number of surface acres covered by such separate tract and included in the production unit bears to the total number of surface\n  acres included in the production unit, commencing with the date of first production from the production unit.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nIn February 2001, Samson finished directionally drilling and completed the BSM A–1 well north of the BSM No. 1 well on\nSamson's own lease in Hardin County (the “Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank lease”). The mineral interests underlying this lease\nwere owned 87.5% by Black Stone Minerals and 12.5% by FirnBank as cotenants.\n\nSamson did not have the contractual authority to pool under its leases with either Black Stone Minerals or FirnBank. Samson\ntherefore negotiated with the leaseholders for such a right and concluded that both of the lessors were in agreement. *423\nAccordingly, on March 12, 2001, Samson filed a Unit Designation for a 704–acre unit called the Black Stone Minerals “A”\nNo. 1 Gas Unit (the “BSM A–1 unit”). The BSM A–1 unit designation unitized the Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank lease, as\nwell as the Hooks' 10–acre and 95–acre Hardin County Leases and other tracts, including leases beneath Pine Island Bayou\nowned by the State. The designation reflected that it was effective as of the date of first production, and it included a list of the\nleases pooled, including the Hooks' Hardin County Leases. The designation for the BSM A–1 unit included gas production at\nall depths between 6,000 and 13,800 feet, although the BSM A–1 well produced gas only from the shallow EY5 formation.\n\nFirnBank consented to be pooled into the BSM A–1 Unit in May 2001. Samson also obtained written consent from the Hooks\nto pool their Hardin County Leases into the BSM A–1 unit. In addition, it obtained the agreement of the Texas General Land\nOffice and the School Land Board (collectively, the “State of Texas”), who owned adjacent land, to pool that land into the\nunit. However, Black Stone Minerals, the 87.5% owner of the mineral interests underlying the drill site, declined to consent\nto the pooling unit.\n\nSamson drilled and completed the BSM A–1 well, and the well began producing in June 2001 from the depth range of the\nformation at the horizon from 12,304 to 12,332 feet. In December 2001, Samson finished another gas well, the DuJay No. 1\nwell. The DuJay No. 1 well produced from some of the same land designated to the BSM A–1 unit, but it reached from 13,150\nto 13,176 feet—a lower horizon than the BSM A–1 well. The DuJay No. 1 well began producing in January 2002.\n\nIn February 2002, after failing to receive Black Stone Minerals' consent to the BSM A–1 pooling unit, Samson amended the\nBSM A–1 unit designation. It executed and recorded a designation for a new unit, the Joyce DuJay No. 1 Gas unit (“DuJay No.\n1 unit”) that recited an effective date as of first production of the DuJay No. 1 well, i.e., January 2002. The DuJay No. 1 unit\ndesignated a new, smaller, 571–acre unit with a different name, different leases, different depths and different boundaries from\nthe BSM A–1 unit. The DuJay No. 1 unit included some of the deeper strata of the originally designated BSM A–1 unit, but it\nexcluded the EY5 horizon from which the BSM A–1 well was producing at 12,304 to 12,332 feet. Instead, the designated DuJay\nNo. 1 unit pooled its leases as to gas well production from 12,800 feet and deeper, including some already-pooled depths carved\nout of the BSM A–1 unit (12,400–13,800 feet) and deeper strata (below 13,800 feet). Because of its depth limitations, the DuJay\nNo. 1 unit included the DuJay No. 1 well, but not the shallower-completed BSM A–1 well. The designated acreage excluded\nmost of the Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank lease, but it included the Hooks' Hardin County Leases and the State's leases.\n\nSamson did not get consent from the Hooks to vacate or amend the BSM A–1 unit or to “unpool” their interests from the\nBSM A–1 unit or well. However, it informed the Hooks that the BSM A–1 unit had been amended and the unit name had\nbeen changed. It stated, “Please note that the Unit Designation for the Black Stone Minerals ‘A’ No. 1 is being amended and\nwill now be called the Joyce DuJay No. 1 unit. No additional action is needed on your part.” After the BSM A–1 unit was\namended, reconstituted, and renamed the DuJay No. 1 unit, Samson paid, and the Hooks accepted, royalty payments from\npooled production from the DuJay No. 1 well from the date of first production until *424 after commencement of trial in the\ninstant case. The BSM A–1 well was produced as a lease well on Samson's Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank leases and was not\nincluded in any unit. Samson did not pay the Hooks royalties on the BSM A–1 well, and the Hooks took no action to enforce\nany rights with respect to the original BSM A–1 unit.\n\nSubsequently, Samson drilled another DuJay well (the “DuJay A–1 well”) and created a separate pooling unit for that well. The\nDuJay A–1 unit differed from the DuJay No. 1 unit by depth limitation and acreage. The DuJay A–1 well began producing on\nSeptember 25, 2002. However, Samson did not file the DuJay A–1 unit designation until July 2003. The Hooks' Hardin County\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nLeases were likewise pooled into the designated DuJay A–1 unit, and the Hooks accepted royalties on the production from that\nunit as well from the date of first production until after trial had begun in the instant action.\n\n\n3. The Hooks' Hardin County Leases and the “Most Favored Nation” Clause\nThe Hooks' Hardin County Leases also contained a “most favored nation” clause. This clause provided that, under certain\ncircumstances, the royalties payable to the Hooks must be elevated to match the highest royalty payable to Samson's other\nlessors.\n\n\n4. The Hooks' Leases and the “Formation Production Clause”\nArticle III(K) of each of the Hooks' Leases contained a “formation production clause.” Article III provided that the Hooks were\nto receive as royalties 25% of “the market value at the wells” on the “gas, including casinghead gas or other gaseous substances\nproduced from said land,” or 25% of “the price received therefor by Lessee.” Likewise, they were to receive as royalties 25%\nof “all liquid hydrocarbons that may be produced from said land.” Article III(K) provided, “For the purposes of calculating\nall royalties payable under Article III herein, it is expressly provided that all such calculations shall be based on formation\nproduction as reported on Texas Railroad Commission forms P–1 and P–2.”\n\n\n\n                                               B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n1. Trial Court Proceedings\nIn August 2004, several mineral-rights owners who had leased to Samson filed a suit against Samson styled Joyce DuJay Lee\nv. Samson Lone Star. The plaintiffs, who did not include the Hooks, complained about pooling issues unrelated to the BSM No.\n1 well. In December 2004, other landowners, also not including the Hooks, filed a second action, styled Thomas Klorer et al.\nv. Samson, complaining about the same issues. In August 2005, these two actions were consolidated.\n\nOn his birthday in November 2006, Charles Hooks, as an oil and gas attorney, attended a seminar for oil and gas attorneys.\nThere, he met an attorney who told him he was handling the Klorer and Lee cases against Samson.\n\nOn November 16, 2006, the Hooks were added to the consolidated suit in a Fifth Amended Petition. This petition alleged against\nSamson various breaches of contract and common law and statutory negligence related to the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease\nand their two Hardin County Leases. Among other things, the Hooks claimed that Samson had breached the Jefferson County\nLease by not paying compensatory royalties based on the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well being within 1,320 feet from their\nLease. The Hooks also claimed that Samson had improperly “unpooled” the BSM A–1 unit, and they sued to obtain all royalties\nthey would have received from that unit as if all *425 the lessors, including Black Stone Minerals, had agreed to pool, to be\nadded to the royalties they received from the DuJay No. 1 and DuJay A–1 units(the “unpooling claim”). The Hooks also asked\nfor a declaratory judgment regarding the construction of the “most favored nations” clauses in their Leases, which they argued\nwas triggered by a royalty paid to the State of Texas under a pooling agreement with Samson that was higher than the royalty\npaid to the Hooks under their pooling agreements. Finally, the Hooks sought the payment of royalties to them on “formation\nproduction” under the terms of all three Leases. The Hooks did not, however, plead any fraud claims at that time.\n\nThe Hooks added fraud, fraudulent inducement, and statutory fraud claims with respect to the Jefferson County Lease in a\nSixth Amended Petition, filed on May 7, 2007. The Hooks alleged in the alternative (1) that their Jefferson County Lease\nhad never been a part of the BSM No. 1 unit because no agreement to amend that Lease to allow pooling was entered, and,\ntherefore, they were entitled to damages under the Lease for the loss of their rights to require Samson either to drill an offset\nwell, pay them compensatory royalties, or release their acreage, and (2) that Samson had made false representations to them\nas to the configuration of the BSM No. 1 unit and the location of the BSM No. 1 well to induce them to agree to amend the\nJefferson County Lease to allow a portion of it to be pooled in the BSM No. 1 well and unit(the “offset obligations claim”).\nThey contended that Samson had falsely represented “that the [BSM No. 1] (gas) well was more than 1,320′ from the nearest\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nlease line of the Hooks Jefferson County Lease” so that its offset obligations were not triggered under the Lease. The Hooks\nclaimed that the representations were intended to save Samson from having to pay them the substantially greater compensatory\nroyalties that would have been payable under the terms of the Lease for infringement of the 1,320–foot buffer zone.\n\nIn September 2007, the trial court severed the consolidated action against Samson into three different actions, one of which\nwas the Hooks' action against Samson for fraud and breach of contract. 5\n\n5      The severed lawsuits are Klorer v. Samson Lone Star, No. B–173,008; Bordages v. Samson Lone Star, No. B–173,008–A; and Hooks\n       v. Samson Lone Star, No. B–173,008–B. Only Hooks has gone to trial. Klorer and Bordages remain pending.\nSubsequently, the Hooks moved for partial summary judgment on several of their claims based on the terms of their Leases.\nThe Hooks moved for summary judgment on the unpooling claim, claiming that Samson did not have authority to vacate the\nBSM A–1 unit into which their Hardin County Leases were pooled and that, therefore, Samson had breached its lease contract\nby failing to pay them royalties on the BSM A–1 well. The Hooks also moved for summary judgment on their most favored\nnation claim, formation production claim, and offset claims. They argued that Samson failed to pay them “royalties based on a\ngreater ‘Most Favored Nations' rate and compensatory royalties on certain offset encroaching wells.”\n\nSamson moved for partial summary judgment on the offset obligations provision, on the formation production claims, and on the\nmost favored nation claim. Samson also moved for summary judgment on the Hooks' unpooling claim on the basis of limitations.\n\nThe trial court granted the Hooks' motion for summary judgment and denied Samson's motion on the unpooling claim. It\nassessed damages of $766,626.85 against Samson on the Hooks' unpooling claim.\n\n *426 The trial court also granted the Hooks' summary judgment motion on their claim for breach of the most favored nations\nclause in their Hardin County Leases and awarded them $848,854.01 in damages.\n\nThe trial court granted Samson's motion for summary judgment for breach of the offset obligations provision in the Jefferson\nCounty Lease on limitations, and it denied the Hooks' corresponding motion. The trial court also disposed of some other contract\nclaims by other partial summary judgment motions.\n\nIn 2008, the case went to trial solely on the Hooks' fraud claims with respect to the Jefferson County Lease and their formation\nproduction claims. The fraud claims included the Hooks' claims that Samson's landman, Lanoue, had made misrepresentations\nto them to get them to allow Samson to add their 50 acres subject to the Jefferson County Lease to the BSM No. 1 pooling unit\nfor the BSM No. 1 well, which was within the 1,320–foot buffer zone for the Lease. The Hooks contended Samson made these\nmisrepresentations to avoid abiding by the terms of Article VI(A) of the Jefferson County Lease, which they contended would\nhave required Samson to drill an offset well, release their acreage, or pay them compensatory royalties, and, therefore, they\nwere entitled to damages. The Hooks also claimed that they were entitled to additional royalties under the formation production\nclauses in both their Jefferson County and their Hardin County Leases.\n\nThe jury answered “yes” to the questions of whether Samson committed fraud and statutory fraud with respect to the BSM No.\n1 well. It assessed damages against Samson for fraud in the amount of $20,081,638.07. The jury found that, in the exercise of\nreasonable diligence, the Hooks should have discovered Samson's fraud by Charles “Hook's Birthday April 2007.” It did not\nrespond, however, to the questions asking for a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the harm to the Hooks resulted\nfrom fraud or that Samson had actual awareness of the falsity of the representations or promise that the jury had found to be\nfraud. 6 Therefore, it did not award exemplary damages. The jury also did not respond to the question requesting it to “find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Samson secured execution by the Hooks of a document by deception” and that the property\nhad a value of $1,500 or more. 7\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\n6      Question Four, the question asking for a finding that the harm to the Hooks resulted from fraud, and Question Five, asking for a\n       finding that Samson had actual awareness of the falsity of the representation, instructed the jury to answer the questions only if it\n       unanimously answered “yes” to Questions One and Two. Only eleven of the twelve jurors answered “yes” to Questions One and\n       Two; therefore, the jury properly refrained from answering Questions Four and Five.\n7      Question Seven, seeking a finding that Samson secured execution of a document by deception, instructed the jury to answer the\n       question only if it unanimously answered “yes” to Question Four or Five. Because the jury did not answer Question Four or Five,\n       it properly refrained from answering Question Seven.\nFinally, the jury found that Samson's failure to pay royalties based on formation production resulted in underpayment of royalties\non all three of the Hooks' Leases.\n\nThe trial court entered final judgment on the jury's verdict, awarding the Hooks $20,081,638.07 for damages proximately caused\nby Samson's fraud with respect to the BSM No. 1 well. The final judgment also reaffirmed and incorporated the trial court's\nprevious summary judgment rulings in favor of the Hooks. In addition to the fraud award, the judgment awarded *427 the\nHooks$766,626.85 in damages for the “unpooling” claim related to the BSM A–1 well, $848,854.01 in damages for breach of\nthe Leases' most favored nations clause, and $52,257.22 in damages related to ad valorem taxes. 8 Finally, the final judgment\nincluded an award of attorney's fees, expert witness fees, costs for copies of depositions, and pre- and post-judgment interest\nin favor of the Hooks.\n\n8      At trial, Samson stipulated that it owed the Hooks $52,257.22 for ad valorem taxes that the Hooks had paid through November 2007.\n       This stipulation and the amount of ad valorem taxes owed by Samson to the Hooks is not challenged on appeal.\n\n\n2. Claims on Appeal\nSamson has appealed the judgment on the trial verdict and the partial summary judgments entered against it, and the Hooks\nhave cross-appealed the partial summary judgments entered against them, all of which were incorporated in the final judgment.\n\nSamson contends on appeal that the trial court erred in entering judgment on the jury's finding that it committed fraud with\nrespect to the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease and that it withheld royalties on formation production with respect to all three\nof the Hooks' claims. It also contends that the trial court erred in granting the Hooks' motion for summary judgment on their\nunpooling claim with respect to the BSM A–1 well, in granting summary judgment on the Hooks' claim for royalties under the\nmost favored nations clause in their Jefferson and Hardin County Leases, and in denying its own motion for summary judgment\non those claims. Finally, Samson contends that the trial court erred by granting a permanent injunction in its final judgment\nrequiring Samson to fulfill certain contract provisions on pain of contempt of court, that it erred in awarding attorney's fees to\nthe Hooks, and that it erred in awarding the Hooks 18% post-judgment interest compounded annually.\n\nThe Hooks contend on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in ruling in Samson's favor on their claims that Samson breached\nthe offset obligations clause in the Hardin County Leases.\n\n\n\n                                                           C. DISCUSSION\n\n1. The Trial Court's Judgment on the Hooks' Fraud Claims with Respect to the Jefferson County Lease\nIn its third issue, Samson contends (1) that there is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that\nthe Hooks could not have discovered their fraud claims until April 2007 and (2) that the statute of limitations bars the Hooks'\nclaim for fraud, fraudulent inducement, and statutory fraud with respect to the Jefferson County Lease.\n\n [1] [2] To prove fraud, a plaintiff must show that the defendant made (1) a material misrepresentation (2) that was either\nknown to be false when made or was asserted without knowledge of its truth (3) which was intended to be relied upon (4)\nwhich was indeed relied upon and (5) which caused injury.

Smith, 943 S.W.2d 414,\n420 (Tex.1997) (“Generally, in a case of fraud the statute of limitations does not commence to run until the fraud is discovered\nor until it might have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence.”).\n\n [7] The Hooks claimed, and the jury found, that in making their determination to agree to the pooling of 50 acres of their\nJefferson County Lease in the BSM No. 1 unit, they relied solely on Lanoue's oral statement that the BSM No. 1 well was\nabout 1,500 feet from their Lease line and on Charles Hooks' interpretation of the plat of the BSM No. 1 unit provided to him\nin response to his conversation with Lanoue on February 15, 2001. The Hooks also contended, and the jury found, that they did\nnot discover that the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well was within their 1,320–foot buffer zone, entitling them to additional\ncompensation royalties, until well within the limitations period as extended by application of the discovery rule. 9 Specifically,\nthe Hooks claimed that they relied on Charles Hooks' interpretation of the designation “±1400#” on the line on the plat of the\nredesignated unit drawn from an undesignated point to Pine Island Bayou as meaning that the bottom hole of the BSM No.\n1 well was about 1,400 feet, or more than 1,320 feet, from their Lease, and, therefore, outside the buffer zone. They did not\ninquire into seemingly contradictory information in that document showing an arrow pointing to the bottom hole of the BSM\nNo. 1 well about one-quarter of the way along the 1,400–foot line from an undesignated point to Pine Island Bayou, the western\nline of their Jefferson County Lease. Nor did they inquire into the notation that the bottom hole was about 1,400 feet “FEL\nunit,” i.e., from the eastern line of the reconfigured BSM No. 1 unit, which included 50 acres of their Jefferson County Lease.\nBoth of these notations would have indicated to them that the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well was clearly within the Lease's\n1,320–foot buffer zone. Similarly, the Hooks did not seek available records from either Samson or the Railroad Commission\nthat would have shown them the actual location of the BSM No. 1 well's bottom hole.\n\n9      Although the jury found that the Hooks' cause of action for fraud accrued on “Hooks' birthday April 2007,” the record shows that\n       Hooks' birthday was in November and that it was on his birthday in November 2006 that he attended the seminar for oil and gas\n       attorneys where he first heard about the other mineral-rights owners' suits against Samson.\nHad the Hooks exercised reasonable diligence, they should have known of the exact location of the bottom hole when the\ndirectional survey was filed with the Railroad Commission in July 2000. See Emerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 216; *429 Little,\n943 S.W.2d at 420. Charles Hooks was an oil and gas attorney and had participated in more than 100 oil and gas leases at\nthe time of trial, and he knew that Lanoue had certified the plat furnished to Hooks as being made on his own knowledge in\nDecember 2000, but he never sought to investigate the results of the directional survey filed with the Railroad Commission in\nJuly 2000, which showed the exact location of the bottom hole. Nor did the Hooks conduct due diligence in seeking the plat\nof the originally designated BSM No. 1 unit certified by the surveyor in March 2000, showing the proposed bottom hole of\nthe BSM No. 1 well, which was likewise filed with the Railroad Commission in July 2000. Both of these publicly available\ndocuments would have shown that the well was proposed to be and was bottomed within the 1,320–foot buffer zone of the\nJefferson County Lease, triggering Samson's obligations to them under Article VI(A) of that Lease.

Partnership v. Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\navailable from the lessee, Samson, or from the Railroad Commission would have shown the Hooks the actual location of the\nBSM No. 1 well's bottom hole in February 2001, when pooling was first proposed to them.\n\nThe Hooks' fraud claims were not filed until May 2007, more than six years after pooling was proposed to them by Samson.\nWe conclude that the Hooks knew or should have known information that led to the discovery of the alleged fraud no later\nthan February 2001, as the necessary information was a matter of public record at that time. See BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Marshall,\n342 S.W.3d 59, 66 (Tex.2011) (holding that information disclosing lessee's failure to continue good faith efforts to develop oil\nand gas lease was available from public records and “from several other sources, including the lessee”); HECI Exploration Co.\nv. Neel, 982 S.W.2d 881, 886 (Tex.1998) (holding that, because several sources of information about common reservoirs and\noperations are available to royalty owners, including Railroad Commission records, discovery rule deferring accrual of cause\nof action does not apply to claims of royalty owners for damage to common oil and gas reservoir).\n\n [8] The statute of limitations for fraud begins to run when the claimant knew or could have discovered the fraud by the exercise\nof reasonable diligence. See Little, 943 S.W.2d at 420. Thus, the statute of limitations began to run in February 2001, but the\nHooks did not file suit until May 2007, which is well outside the limitations period. See Emerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 216. We\nhold that the Hooks' fraud claims are barred by limitations as a matter of law.\n\nOn rehearing, the Hooks argue that the issue of when they could have discovered the fraud was a question for the jury, citing\nLesley v. Veterans Land Board, 352 S.W.3d 479, 485–86 (Tex.2011). That case addressed an alleged mistake in a reservation\nof a mineral interest. Id. The supreme court held that there were fact issues as to whether this mistake was so plain as to charge\nthe grantor with knowledge of the mistake. Id. at 486. The court concluded, “In these circumstances, it cannot be said that, as\na matter of law, Lesley knew or should have known of the mistake in her deed when she executed it. Whether her claim for\nreformation is barred by limitations involves disputed facts.” Id. This scenario is distinguishable from the present case.\n\n [9] When a cause of action accrues is normally a question of law. Emerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 202. Our analysis of when the\nHooks knew or should have known of facts that in the exercise of reasonable diligence would have led to the discovery of the\nalleged wrongful act demonstrates *430 that they should have known of the alleged fraud, as a matter of law, in February\n2001, more than six years before they filed suit. There is no disputed fact issue here regarding whether this information was\nplain enough to charge the Hooks with this knowledge—it is undisputed that this information was readily available in Samson's\nrecords and in the records filed with the Railroad Commission. Moreover, there was sufficient information available on the\nplat of the redesignated BSM No. 1 unit—namely the information that the bottom hole of the well was “±1400” feet from the\neastern line of the unit that encompassed their 50 acres—that should have put them on inquiry notice. Thus, the reasoning in\nLesley does not apply in this case.\n\nWe sustain Samson's third issue.\n\n\n2. Summary Judgments Entered Against Samson on the Hardin County Leases\n\n\n                                       (a) Samson's “Unpooling” of the BSM A–1 Unit\n\nIn its sixth issue, Samson challenges the trial court's summary judgment awarding the Hooks damages on their claim for royalties\nfrom the BSM A–1 unit due to Samson's improper unpooling of that unit.\n\nSamson contends that because Black Stone Minerals, the 87.5% owner of the mineral rights on the drill site tract did not consent\nto pooling, (although FirnBank, the owner of a 12.5% interest in the mineral rights did), the “essential purpose for forming that\nunit had failed” and the BSM A–1 unit as originally designated was not formed. Thus, the amendment of the unit to exclude\nthe non-consenting drill site mineral owner, Black Stone Minerals, was justified. Samson further argues that, after the BSM A–\n1 unit was amended and renamed the DuJay No. 1 unit, the Hooks accepted royalty payments from production on both DuJay\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nunits, which gave the Hooks a higher percentage of the production than they would have received under the BSM A–1 unit.\nSamson argues that, by accepting the royalty payments from the DuJay No. 1 well and the DuJay A–1 well, the Hooks accepted\nthe amendment to the BSM A–1 unit and they understood and acknowledged that the BSM A–1 unit was not formed.\n\nAlternatively, Samson argues that, if the amendment to the BSM A–1 unit was improper, the BSM A–1 unit still exists and the\nHooks should have been paid in accordance with their interests in that unit, not in accordance with their interest in the two DuJay\nunits, which were improperly formed. Moreover, it argues that the extent of the unit must be limited to FirnBank's 12.5% interest\nin the drill site tract because only FirnBank consented to pool its undivided interest in the gas produced from the BSM A–1 well.\n\nThe Hooks argue that the BSM A–1 unit was validly formed when FirnBank, the owner of a 12.5% undivided interest in the\nmineral rights to the drill site, consented to the unit and that this pooled unit could not be vacated or amended so long as gas\ncontinued to be produced from the BSM A–1 well. The Hooks agreed to the pooling of their Hardin County Leases in the BSM\nA–1 unit. Therefore, they argue, they are entitled to royalties from the BSM A–1 well in addition to the royalties they accepted\nfrom their participation in the DuJay No. 1 and DuJay A–1 pooling units.\n\n [10] [11] [12] [13] An oil and gas lease is a contract and is therefore interpreted as such. Tittizer v. Union Gas Corp., 171\nS.W.3d 857, 860 (Tex.2005). When construing a contract, the primary goal of the courts is to give effect to the parties' written\nexpression of their intent. PG & E Gas *431 Transmission v. City of Edinburg, 59 S.W.3d 225, 227 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi\n2001, no pet.). The courts will enforce the intentions of the parties to an unambiguous oil and gas lease as expressed in the lease.\nTittizer, 171 S.W.3d at 860. In determining the agreement, the court examines all parts of the contract and the circumstances\nsurrounding its formulation. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. New Ulm Gas, Ltd., 940 S.W.2d 587, 591 (Tex.1996); PG\n& E Gas Transmission, 59 S.W.3d at 227–28.\n\n [14] [15] With respect to royalty interest owners, “pooling results in ‘a cross-conveyance of interests in land by agreement\namong the participating parties, each of whom obtains an undivided joint ownership in the royalty earned from the land in the\n“block” created by the agreement’ ” and each of whom receives royalty on the basis of the percentage of that party's acreage\nto the whole block. Browning Oil Co. v. Luecke, 38 S.W.3d 625, 633 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, pet. denied) (quoting MCZ, Inc.\nv. Triolo, 708 S.W.2d 49, 52–53 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1986, writ ref'd n.r.e.)). In other words, pooling effects a cross-\nconveyance among the owners of the minerals under the various tracts in the pool so that all cotenants own undivided interests\nunder the unitized tract in the proportion that their contribution bears to the unitized tract. Montgomery v. Rittersbacher, 424\nS.W.2d 210, 213 (Tex.1968). Thus, when an oil and gas lease is executed by all of the owners of different mineral interests\nin two or more tracts, the royalties payable under the lease will be pooled, and all royalty interest owners in the land subject\nto the lease will share in production, no matter where the well is drilled on the leasehold. London v. Merriman, 756 S.W.2d\n736, 739 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1988, writ denied).\n\n [16] [17] [18] An oil and gas lessee has no power to pool, however, without the lessor's express authorization, usually\ncontained in the lease's pooling clause. Tittizer, 171 S.W.3d at 860; Se. Pipe Line Co. v. Tichacek, 997 S.W.2d 166, 170\n(Tex.1999); Luecke, 38 S.W.3d at 634 (holding that lessee's authority to pool is derived solely from terms of lease, and lessee\nhas no power to pool absent express authority). “For pooling to be valid, it must be done in accordance with the terms of the\nmethods and purposes specified in the lease.” Tittizer, 171 S.W.3d at 860; Tichacek, 997 S.W.2d at 170. Good-faith pooling can\nbe exercised multiple times. See Expando Prod. Co. v. Marshall, 407 S.W.2d 254, 259–60 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1966,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.). However, “[t]he lessors' land may be pooled only to the extent stipulated in the lease.” Tittizer, 171 S.W.3d\nat 860 (quoting Jones v. Killingsworth, 403 S.W.2d 325, 327–28 (Tex.1965)).\n\n [19] [20] [21] Joinder by all interest owners is not necessary for a pooled unit to be valid. See Ladd Petroleum Corp. v.\nEagle Oil & Gas Co., 695 S.W.2d 99, 106 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see also Whelan v.

Rather, a tenant in common has the legal\nright to incorporate a pooling agreement into an original oil and gas lease without the consent or joinder of the other cotenants,\ncreating a valid contract binding the undivided interest of the cotenant *432 making the agreement. Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at\n128. In such a case, the timely completion of a producing well under the terms of the pooling agreement and within the unit area\nset out in the unitization agreement will serve to continue the lease in full force and effect so long as gas is being produced in\ncommercial quantities. Id. A cotenant who enters into such a lease binding its royalty interest in the completed and producing\nwell and who accepts its pro rata share in the royalties from the well calculated under the terms of the unitization agreement is\nestopped to deny the validity of the unitization agreement as to its interest therein. Id. at 129.\n\n [22] A lessee cannot unilaterally terminate a unit that has a producing pooled well. See Ladd Petroleum Corp., 695 S.W.2d\nat 106–07. Rather, for a lessee to terminate a unit, either the lessors must agree to the unpooling or the lease must expressly\nauthorize such termination. Id. at 107; see Williamson v. Mobil Producing Tex. & N.M., Inc., 737 S.W.2d 917, 921 (Tex.App.-\nBeaumont 1987, writ denied) (“So, clearly, the lessee, if it is ‘after the discovery of the same,’ can change the pooling unit only\nsubsequent to the cessation of production....”).\n\n [23] [24] When a mineral interest owner—a lessor—accepts royalty checks from a pooled unit, he has accepted that unit. See\nMontgomery, 424 S.W.2d at 214–15. Under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, mineral interest owners can not repudiate a unit\ndesignation after accepting royalties attributable to that unit. Cambridge Prod. Inc. v. Geodyne Nominee Corp., 292 S.W.3d\n725, 732 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2009, pet. denied).\n\nHere, The Hardin County Leases granted Samson the authority to pool those leases with other land or leases. Under that\nauthority, Samson obtained the Hooks' agreement to pool their interests with the undivided interests of the two drill site lessors,\nBlack Stone Minerals and FirnBank, in the BSM A–1 unit. One of the two drillsite lessors—FirnBank—consented to the BSM\nA–1 unit. In addition, Samson pooled other lands and its own working interests into that unit. However, Black Stone Minerals\nrefused to pool. Samson had no authority to pool Black Stone Minerals' interests without its express consent. See Tittizer, 171\nS.W.3d at 860; Tichacek, 997 S.W.2d at 170; Luecke, 38 S.W.3d at 634. But it did not lack authority to form a gas production\nunit that included the mineral interests of Black Stone Minerals's cotenant, FirnBank. See Ladd Petroleum Corp., 695 S.W.2d\nat 106; Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128.\n\nWe agree with the Hooks that the originally designated BSM A–1 unit was validly formed, creating a valid contract binding\nFirnBank, the cotenant making the agreement, and the Hooks. See Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128. Thus, the Hardin County Leases\nand FirnBank's undivided 12.5% interest in the acreage of the designated unit, as well as the leases of the other consenting\nlandowners, constituted a valid pooling unit. However, FirnBank pooled only its own undivided 12.5% interest in the production\nfrom the BSM A–1 unit. See id. at 129. The BSM A–1 unit that was created for the BSM A–1 well did not include the interest of\nBlack Stone Minerals, who had not consented to pool its undivided mineral interest in the drill site lease, as a lessor. See Tittizer,\n171 S.W.3d at 860; Tichacek, 997 S.W.2d at 170; Luecke, 38 S.W.3d at 634. Neither FirnBank nor the Hooks had the authority\nto bind Black Stone Minerals to their own agreement to pool. See Montgomery, 424 S.W.2d at 213; Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128.\n\n [25] While there was production from the original BSM A–1 unit, Samson had no *433 authority to dissolve that unit. See\nWilliamson, 737 S.W.2d at 921. Nevertheless, when Black Stone Minerals refused to pool, Samson treated the BSM A–1 well\nas continuing as an independent lease well on the Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank Lease that was not pooled in any unit. Samson\ndid not pay the Hooks royalties on the production from the BSM A–1 well, nor did the Hooks complain that they were not\nreceiving royalties. Instead, it amended and redesignated the pooling unit to exclude the BSM A–1 well and the EY5 formation\nfrom which it was producing, which Samson renamed the DuJay No. 1 unit.\n\nSamson pooled the Hooks' interests and those of the other interest holders in the originally designated BSM A–1 unit into\nboth the DuJay No. 1 unit and the DuJay A–1 unit, pursuant to its right under the Hardin County Leases to exercise pooling\nauthority multiple times, “at any time and from time to time....” Samson notified the Hooks, stating, “Please note that the Unit\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nDesignation for the Black Stone Minerals ‘A’ No. 1 is being amended and will now be called the Joyce DuJay No. 1 Unit. No\nadditional action is needed on your part.”\n\nThe amended unit and redesignated pooling unit included reduced acreage from the Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank lease as\nwell as the Hooks' Hardin County Leases and others from the original BSM A–1 unit, including the State's leases. Although the\nnew DuJay No. 1 unit did not include the horizon from which the BSM A–1 well was producing, it did include deeper strata\nthat had been included in the original BSM A–1 unit, including the depths from which the DuJay No. 1 well was producing.\nSubsequently, Samson designated a second new gas production unit that overlapped with the original BSM A–1 unit, which it\nnamed the DuJay A–1 unit. The DuJay A–1 unit included different strata not included in the DuJay No. 1 unit.\n\nThe completion of a producing well, the BSM A–1, within the unit area set out in the unitization agreement served to continue\nthe leases granted to Samson by FirnBank, the Hooks, and the other landowners in full force and effect so long as any “unitized\nsubstance” continued to be produced from the BSM A–1 well, subject to unpooling through agreement of the lessors or through\ncessation of the production of unitized substance as provided in the habendum clause of the Hardin County Leases. See Ladd\nPetroleum Corp., 695 S.W.2d at 107; Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128. Therefore, Samson's redesignation of the BSM A–1 unit\nconstituted a breach of the Hardin County Leases by Samson, as did its failure to pay the Hooks royalties on the production\nfrom the BSM A–1 well unless the lessors agreed to the unpooling.\n\nThe Hooks took no action to assert any rights under the originally designated BSM A–1 unit in response to Samson's amendment\nand redesignation of the BSM A–1 unit as the DuJay No. 1 unit and its subsequent designation of the DuJay A–1 unit until they\nfiled suit for breach of contract against Samson in November 2006, more than four years from the date of first production and\nmore than four years from the date the BSM A–1 unit was amended and redesignated and the Hooks were notified. Instead, the\nHooks expressly agreed to accept the redesignation and terms of the new units, binding themselves to accept royalties pursuant\nto their pro rata share of the royalties from the DuJay No. 1 and DuJay A–1 units as calculated under the terms of the DuJay\nNo. 1 and DuJay A–1 unitization agreements, and they did accept royalties from the production of both DuJay units until the\ntime of trial in this case.\n\n *434 We conclude that, by accepting royalty checks from the amended and redesignated pooling units, the DuJay No. 1 and\nDuJay A–1 units, which they had been notified replaced the BSM A–1 unit, and by not asserting any rights to royalties from the\noriginal BSM A–1 unit or making any timely claim against Samson in regard to the amendment and redesignation of the BSM\nA–1 unit, the Hooks accepted and ratified the amendment and redesignation of the units. See Fortune Prod. Co. v. Conoco, Inc.,\n52 S.W.3d 671, 678 (Tex.2000) (stating that ratification is adoption or confirmation by person with knowledge of all material\nfacts of prior act which he had right to repudiate); Montgomery, 424 S.W.2d at 214–15.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that the Hooks are estopped to assert an interest in royalties from production from the BSM A–1 well by\ntheir ratification of the amended and redesignated BSM A–1 unit.\n\nWe sustain Samson's sixth issue.\n\n\n\n (b) The Hooks' Summary Judgment on the “Most Favored Nations” Clause in the Jefferson and Hardin County Leases\n\n [26] In its seventh issue, Samson claims that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment in the Hooks' favor on\nthe “most favored nations” lease clause contained in all three of the Hooks' Leases. This clause provided that, under certain\ncircumstances, the royalties payable to the Hooks must be elevated to match the highest royalty payable to Samson's other\nlessors. Specifically, the clause provides:\n\n  XXIX. MOST FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSE\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

If the reserved royalty or the amount per acre payable for delay rentals, shut-in rentals or minimum royalty, at any\n  time payable under such Third Party Lease, is higher than the like royalty and amounts payable as provided in the Subject\n  Lease, the royalty or amount payable per acre in the Subject Lease, which is less than that provided in the Third Party Lease\n  shall be immediately increased so that it will equal the royalty or other amounts payable under the Third Party Lease. The\n  subject Lease and the Third Party Lease must be calculated in substantially the same manner, such that the comparison of\n  the Subject Lease and the Third Party Lease is based on the same effective net royalty or other payments, and that same shall\n  include or deduct the same types of charges, taxes and other burdens from such interests.\n\nThe trial court granted summary judgment in the Hooks' favor, holding that this clause was triggered by royalty paid to the\nState of Texas under a pooling agreement with Samson that was higher than the royalty due to the Hooks.\n\nIt is undisputed that the State of Texas's lease under Pine Island Bayou (“State of Texas Lease”) is a “Third Party Lease” within\nthe meaning of that term in the most favored nations clause in the Leases in that it covers land located within three miles of the\nlands covered by the Hooks' Leases. The State, like FirnBank and the Hooks, originally consented to pooling to form the BSM\nA–1 unit. It declined, however, to consent to the subsequent DuJay No. 1 unit. In order to obtain the State's consent to pool its\nlease under Pine Island Bayou into the DuJay No. 1 unit, Samson entered into a pooling agreement wherein Samson became\nobligated to pay the State *435 a 28.28896% royalty on production from the DuJay No. 1 well, as opposed to the 25% it had\nbeen paying the State and was paying to the Hooks. The issue, therefore, is whether the pooling agreement executed by Samson\nand the State constitutes a “Third Party Lease,” i.e., an oil and gas lease located within three miles of any exterior boundary of\nany of the Hooks' Leases with a higher royalty than that provided for in the Hooks' Leases, so that Samson's obligation to pay\nthe Hooks increased royalties under the most favored nations clause in those leases was triggered.\n\n [27] [28] A most favored nations clause is “a vendor protection clause [that] enables the vendor to receive the benefit of\nincreases in the market price of his product over the term of a long range contract with a purchaser.” Lone Star Gas Co. v.\nHoward Corp., 556 S.W.2d 372, 374 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Such a clause is enforced according to\nits terms. See id. at 375–76.\n\nThe most favored nations clause in the Leases referred specifically to Samson's obligation to pay the Hooks royalty per acre\nequal to that payable under any Third Party “oil and gas lease(s) part of which is located within three (3) miles of any exterior\nboundary of the subject lands covered by [the Hooks'] Lease that Samson entered.” Here, however, Samson did not enter an\n“oil and gas lease” with the State that required it to pay higher royalties per acre than it was paying the Hooks under their\nLeases. It entered a settlement agreement, called a “Pooling Agreement,” that raised only the royalty payable to the State on\nproduction from the DuJay No. 1 unit.\n\nThe difference between the royalties payable to the State on production from the DuJay No. 1 unit and the royalties paid to\nthe Hooks did not represent a difference in the market price of gas at the time the pooling agreement was entered; nor did it\nrepresent a general increase in the royalty rate on the State's leases. It was an amount agreed upon by Samson and the State to\ninduce the State to accept the amended unit in place of the BSM A–1 unit and to compensate the State for its loss of royalties\nfrom the BSM A–1 well due to Samson's amendment and redesignation of the BSM A–1 unit as the DuJay No. 1, excluding\nthe BSM A–1 well formation.\n\nWe conclude that, under its plain terms, the most favored nations clause in the Hooks' Leases does not apply to trigger royalties\npayable to the Hooks equal to those payable under the settlement agreement reached between Samson and the State. Therefore,\nwe hold that the trial court erred in granting the Hooks' motion for summary judgment for damages under the most favored\nnations clause in the Hardin County Leases.\n\nWe sustain Samson's seventh issue.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Hooks' Claims Under the Formation Production Clause in the Jefferson and Hardin County Leases\n [29] In its fifth issue, Samson complains about the jury's finding, in response to Question Number 8, that Samson's failure to\npay royalty based on formation production resulted in underpayment of royalty under the Hooks' Jefferson and Hardin County\nLeases and the trial court's judgment awarding the Hooks damages based on the formation production clause in the Leases.\nSamson contends the issue was erroneously submitted to the jury because the construction of the contractual provision involved\nwas a question of law for the trial court; therefore, the jury's response to Question Number 8 is immaterial. Samson argues that,\nas a matter of law, the lease provision in question, properly *436 construed, does not require Samson to pay for formation\nproduction, as this would require it to pay twice for molecules of gas produced at the surface of the well as liquid condensate.\nIt also contends that there is legally and factually insufficient evidence that the Hooks' Leases required Samson to pay twice\nfor those molecules of gas. It states that, by giving effect to the jury's answer to Question Number 8, the trial court increased\nall the other categories of damages assessed against it.\n\nCondensate consists of “hydrocarbons that exist in the form of gas when contained in the natural gas reservoir underground,\nwhich condense into liquid form when released from the reservoir's higher pressure and temperature.” Bowden v. Phillips\nPetroleum Co., 247 S.W.3d 690, 704 n. 7 (Tex.2008). When gas is produced, it goes through a mechanical separator through\nwhich condensate drops out as a liquid at the wellhead. The Railroad Commission has implemented a system by which producers\nreport the amount of gas in the reservoir before it is produced. This system requires producers to use a formula to calculate the\nvolume of reservoir gas produced at the surface as a liquid. “Formation production” is thus the calculation of the total amount\nof natural gas taken from the reservoir in whatever form it arrives at the surface, whether in the form of gas or in the form of\nliquid condensate. Formation production calculations allow the Railroad Commission to track the amount of gas coming out\nof the ground to avoid overproduction.\n\nArticle III of each of the Hooks' Leases contained several paragraphs specifying how royalties were to be paid. It reads in\npertinent part:\n\n  III ROYALTIES:\n\n  Lessors reserve for themselves ... the following royalties ...\n\n  ....\n\n      B. (1) On gas, including casing head gas or other gaseous substances produced from said land, Twenty–Five percent (25%)\n        of the market value at the wells of such gas, or Twenty–Five percent (25%) of the price received therefor by Lessee,\n        whichever is greater ...\n\n      D. An equal Twenty–Five percent (25%) part of all other liquid hydrocarbons that may be produced from said land ...\n\n  ....\n\n      K. For the purposes of calculating all royalties payable under Article III herein, it is expressly provided that all such\n        calculations shall be based on formation production as reported on Texas Railroad Commission forms P–1 and P–2.\n\nThe Hooks base their formation production argument on Article III(K). They contend that although this provision expressly\nrefers to the entirety of Article III, which covers payments for both liquids and gas, it requires that all calculations shall be\nbased on gas as it exists in the reservoir so that royalties must be paid on liquid condensate both as it is produced in liquid form\nand as it exists in gaseous form in the reservoir.\n\n [30] [31] [32] [33] The interpretation of the formation production provision in the Hooks' Leases is a matter of contract\nconstruction. Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\n229 (Tex.2003). We construe the parties' intentions as expressed in the document, considering the entire writing and attempting\nto harmonize and give effect to all of the contract's provisions with reference to the whole agreement. Frost Nat'l Bank v. L\n& F Distribs., 165 S.W.3d 310, 311–12 (Tex.2005). “We construe contracts *437 ‘from a utilitarian standpoint bearing in\nmind the particular business activity sought to be served’ and ‘will avoid when possible and proper a construction which is\nunreasonable, inequitable, and oppressive.’ ” Id.; accord Ace Ins. Co. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 59 S.W.3d 424, 428 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). If, after the rules of construction are applied, the contract can be given a definite or\ncertain legal meaning, it is unambiguous and we construe it as a matter of law. Frost Nat'l Bank, 165 S.W.3d at 312.\n\nArticle III of the Hooks' Leases, governing the payment of royalties, addresses a number of royalty payment issues. In each\ncase, it unambiguously states that Samson will pay 25% of the proceeds it receives, whether for gas or for liquids, as royalties\nto the Hooks unless the proceeds are below market value, in which case it must pay 25% of market value. In no place do the\nLeases state that, having paid royalties to the Hooks from the proceeds it receives on the sale of gas or liquid condensate,\nSamson must pay for the condensate a second time as it existed as gas in the reservoir. Article III does not state that Samson\nmust pay a 25% royalty on “formation production” in addition to royalty on gas and liquids as produced, and we decline to\nread that provision into the unambiguous language of the Lease. See Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors Inc. v. Fielding,\n289 S.W.3d 844, 850 (Tex.2009) ( “[T]erms are to be implied in contract, not because they are reasonable, but because they\nare necessarily involved in the contractual relationship, such that the parties must have intended them and must have failed to\nexpress them only because of sheer inadvertence or because they are too obvious to need expression.”). We agree with Samson\nthat the unambiguous meaning of these lease provisions is that the Hooks are entitled to a 25% royalty on all gas and liquid\nhydrocarbons at the time proceeds are received from their sale.\n\nWe hold that, under its plain language, the formation production clause in Article III(K) of the Hooks' Jefferson County and\nHardin County Leases does not operate to double the amount of royalties owed on the liquid condensate produced from the well.\nTherefore, the trial court erred in awarding the Hooks damages calculated under the formation production clause in their Leases.\n\nWe sustain Samson's fifth issue.\n\n\n4. The Trial Court's Grant of a Permanent Injunction\nIn its eighth issue, Samson claims that the trial court erred by granting a permanent injunction in its judgment that requires it\nto fulfill certain contractual provisions upon pain of contempt of court. Samson claims that no evidence was presented of the\nelements necessary for a permanent injunction.\n\nThe first item of injunctive relief requires Samson to pay the Hooks royalty on production from the BSM A–1 well commencing\nwith production after May 2008. The fourth item states that Samson shall be liable for all ad valorem taxes on the Hooks'\ninterests in the oil and gas leases at issue after November 2007, as long as those leases are in effect. The fifth item requires\nSamson to provide the Hooks with certain notices and information “as required by the oil and gas leases in this case while\nthose leases are in effect.”\n\n [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] A permanent injunction is proper only when there is evidence of four elements: (1) a\nwrongful act; (2) imminent harm; (3) irreparable injury, and (4) no adequate remedy at law. Jordan v. Landry's Seafood Rest.,\nInc., 89 S.W.3d 737, 742 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). The ruling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Id.\nCourts do not *438 enforce contractual rights by permanent injunction unless the complaining party can show an inadequate\nremedy at law and irreparable injury. Cytogenix, Inc. v. Waldroff, 213 S.W.3d 479, 487 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2006,\npet. denied). Moreover, in order to grant specific performance of a contract via an injunction, present performance of the\ncontract's terms must be possible. Id. “A court should not decree future contractual performance by requiring a party to perform\na continuous series of acts, extending through a long period of time, over which the court exercises its supervision.” Id.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\n [40] [41] [42] The Hooks have failed to cite to us any evidence showing that they are in danger of imminent harm or\nirreparable injury from Samson's failure to pay them royalties on production from the BSM A–1 well or ad valorem taxes or\nfailure to provide them with lease notices and information. Nor have they shown that they have no adequate remedy at law\nfor their grievances. Moreover, at least three of the items of injunctive relief decree future contractual performance, which is\nforbidden by Cytogenix. Id. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by including injunctive relief\nin its order (1) in the absence of any evidence of the elements of a permanent injunction and (2) when the injunctive relief\ndecrees future contractual performance.\n\nWe sustain Samson's fifth issue.\n\n\n5. Attorney's Fees and Post judgment Interest Rate\n [43] In its eighth issue, Samson complains about the grant of attorney's fees in the final judgment. The parties stipulated that the\nHooks' right to collect attorney's fees was contingent on the Hooks prevailing at trial and on appeal. During trial, the parties also\nstipulated that Samson owed the Hooks $52,257.22 related to ad valorem taxes. Although Samson asked this Court to reverse the\ntrial court's judgment “in its entirety,” the parties do not challenge the agreement as to Samson's payment of ad valorem taxes.\nHowever, the Hooks argue on rehearing that Samson's stipulation regarding ad valorem taxes means that the Hooks prevailed\non a claim, and, thus, they are entitled to stipulated attorney's fees under the terms of a separate pre-trial fee stipulation.\n\nThe pre-trial fee stipulation provided that the stipulated attorney's fees “are owed to [the Hooks] by [Samson] if [the Hooks]\nprevail on any of their claims.” The agreement then provided specific exceptions for claims not relevant here. The parties made\na separate stipulation during trial that addressed the issue of the ad valorem taxes.\n\n [44] [45] An “agreement between the parties will not be given greater effect than intended,” and “[a] stipulation will not be\nconstrued as an admission of a fact intended to be controverted.” Austin v. Austin, 603 S.W.2d 204, 207 (Tex.1980). Nothing\nin the ad valorem tax stipulation indicated that it was intended to constitute an admission that the Hooks had prevailed on that\nissue. Thus, the stipulated payment of ad valorem taxes does not entitle the Hooks to claim attorney's fees. See id. Because we\nhave reversed the portions of the judgment in favor of the Hooks on which they could claim to be prevailing parties, and upon\nwhich their right to attorney's fees is contingent, we conclude that the Hooks are not entitled to attorney's fees.\n\nWe sustain Samson's eighth issue.\n\n [46] Additionally, in two sentences in its appellate brief, Samson claimed that *439 “[i]t was error to award post judgment\ninterest of 18% compounded annually. Instead, the post judgment interest should be at the same rate as a proper prejudgment\ninterest rate.” We asked for and received supplemental briefing from both parties on this issue. The supplemental issue, as\nphrased by Samson, is as follows: “Should the post judgment interest rate be 5% as set by Texas Finance Code § 304.003,\nrather than the rate of 18% as stated in the Final Judgment?” In its supplemental briefing and in its motion for rehearing filed\non March 16, 2012, the Hooks argue that post judgment interest should be awarded at the “maximum allowed by law (per the\nleases).” However, the agreement under which Samson is obligated to pay the ad valorem taxes, the only recovery to which\nthe Hooks are entitled, is the stipulation entered by the parties during trial, not the leases. The ad valorem tax stipulation does\nnot provide an interest rate.\n\n [47] [48] When the interest rate is not specified in a contract, post judgment interest should be calculated based on the\nstatutory rate provided in Texas Finance Code section 304.003. See TEX. FIN.CODE ANN. § 304.003 (Vernon 2006) (providing\njudgment interest rate when interest rate or time price differential is not in contract). Section 304.003(b) provides that, “[o]n\nthe 15th day of each month, the consumer credit commissioner shall determine the post judgment interest rate to be applied to\na money judgment rendered during the succeeding calendar month.” Id. § 304.003(b). Section 304.003(c) provides that, with\nexceptions not applicable here, “[t]he post judgment interest rate is ... the prime rate as published by the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System on the date of computation” or “five percent a year if the prime rate ... described by Subdivision (1)\nis less than five percent.” Id. § 304.003(c)(l )-(2). The prime rate is published in the Texas Register by the Secretary of State.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Pub. Util. Comm'n of Tex., 878 S.W.2d 598, 600 (Tex.1994).\n\nHere, when the trial court entered its final judgment on December 11, 2008, the judgment interest rate according to the consumer\ncredit commissioner was five percent. See Judgment Rate Summary, http://www.occc.state.tx. us/pages/int_rates/Index.html\n(last visited May 22, 2012). Thus, the post judgment interest rate on Samson's obligation to pay the stipulated ad valorem taxes\nshould be five percent. See TEX. FIN.CODE ANN. § 304.003(c).\n\nWe sustain Samson's issue on the post judgment interest rate.\n\n\n\n                                                      C. CONCLUSION\n\nWe reverse the trial court's final judgment awarding the Hooks damages on their fraud, fraudulent inducement, statutory fraud,\nand formation production claims and render judgment that the Hooks take nothing by these claims. We likewise reverse the\ntrial court's final judgment as it reaffirms and incorporates its summary judgments on the Hooks' unpooling and most favored\nnations claims and render judgment that the Hooks take nothing by these claims. Because of our holding on these issues, we\nvacate the trial court's award of attorney's fees. Finally, we vacate the permanent injunction entered against Samson by the trial\ncourt. We further hold that the proper post judgment interest rate is five percent.\n\n\n\n                                             II. THE HOOKS' CROSS–APPEAL\n\nBefore trial, the Hooks and Samson filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether Samson breached the\n *440 offset obligations in the Hardin County Leases. The trial court granted Samson's motion and denied the Hooks' motion\non this issue without stating its reasons.\n\nThe Hooks filed a cross-appeal claiming, in one issue, that the trial court erred in granting Samson's motion for summary\njudgment and denying their own. The Hooks include in this issue sub-issues regarding the correct interpretation of Samson's\noffset obligations under the Jefferson County and Hardin County Leases, an exception in the Leases for pre-existing wells, and\nthe statute of limitations.\n\nSamson contends that the Hooks have waived their appeal of the summary judgments by failing to preserve it. It further argues\nthat the trial court correctly interpreted the Hardin County Leases with respect to the issues raised by the Hooks on cross-appeal\nand correctly rendered summary judgment holding that the Hooks' offset claims are contract claims that are barred by limitations.\n\n\n\n                                                A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nTo prevail on a summary judgment motion, a movant has the burden of proving that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\nand that there is no genuine issue of material fact. TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Cathey v. Booth, 900 S.W.2d 339, 341 (Tex.1995).\nNeither party herein argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists which precludes summary judgment; instead, both claim\nthat, as a matter of law, they are entitled to summary judgment based on the language of the Leases.\n\n\n\n                                              B. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\n [49] [50] The Hooks' claims that Samson breached its offset obligations are breach of contract claims. The four-year statute\nof limitations applies to the Hooks' contract claims. See Stine v. Stewart, 80 S.W.3d 586, 592 (Tex.2002); HECI Exploration\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nCo., 982 S.W.2d at 885. “It is well-settled law that a breach of contract claim accrues when the contract is breached.” Stine,\n80 S.W.3d at 592.\n\nHere, Samson's alleged breach of its offset obligations occurred ninety days from the date of first production from the wells in\nquestion. For the BSM No. 1 well, the ninety days ran in January 2001. For the BSM A–1 well, the ninety days ran in September\n2001. The Hooks did not file suit until November 2006, more than five years later.\n\nWe conclude that the Hooks' cause of action for Samson's breach of its offset obligations was barred by the four-year statute\nof limitations.\n\n\nBecause our resolution of this issue is dispositive, we do not reach the other sub-issues raised in the Hooks' cross-appeal. 10\n\n10     Likewise, we do not reach Samson's claims of waiver.\nWe overrule the Hooks' issue on cross-appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\nWe modify the applicable post judgment interest rate to five percent and affirm the portion of the trial court's judgment awarding\nthe Hooks $52,257.22 related to ad valorem taxes as stipulated by the parties. We reverse the remaining portions of the final\njudgment of the trial court, including the awards to the Hooks of $20,081,638.07 for damages proximately cause by fraud,\n$848,854.01 for damages for breach of the most favored nations clause, and $766,626.85 for damages for “unpooling” related\nto the BSM A–1 well, attorney's fees, other fees and costs. We hold that the Hooks take nothing by those *441 claims, and\nwe vacate the permanent injunction entered against Samson.\n\n\n\nJustice SHARP, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n                            DISSENTING AND CONCURRING OPINION ON REHEARING\n\n\nJIM SHARP, Justice.\nI withdraw my dissenting and concurring opinion dated August 25, 2011 and substitute this opinion in its stead. I continue to\ndissent in part and concur in part.\n\nIt is undisputed that Samson drilled a directional well bottomed within the “buffer zone” established in the Hooks' Jefferson\nCounty Lease (the “Lease”) and failed to elect between the three alternatives outlined in the Lease, thus exposing itself to\nliability for breach of contract. If the Lease had allowed pooling, Samson could have solved the problem by pooling the lands\ncovered by the Lease with the adjacent lands. The Lease, however, did not allow pooling.\n\nSamson's solution to this problem was to begin misrepresenting various “facts” to escape the consequences of its actions. Its\nlandman, Lanoue, filed papers with the Railroad Commission falsely certifying that Samson had pooling authority from the\nHooks. He later filed paperwork in the county's real property records falsely indicating that the Hooks had already agreed to\npool. Lanoue then sent a letter to the Hooks asking them to agree to pool the westernmost 50 acres of the Hooks' acreage in\nthe Lease into the BSM 1 Unit. When Charles Hooks called Lanoue and asked for more information about the well's location,\nLanoue represented to Hooks that the well was located approximately 1500 feet from the lease line, a location outside the\nbuffer zone. When Charles Hooks asked for a plat, Lanoue faxed him one that represented a bottom-hole location that was\n+/–1400 feet from the lease line, the accuracy of which he, Lanoue, had certified with no reference to an actual bottom-hole\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nlocation, although it was ascertainable from a prior directional survey. Instead, when asked the origin of those measurements,\nhe answered: “I got them from myself.” On this basis the Hooks agreed to the formation of the unit.\n\nThus it is clear that Samson, through its representative, took action to cover up its own error by both oral and written\nmisrepresentations to its lessor, born of “assuming” and “hoping.” It is further clear that the Hooks, after asking for and receiving\nverification of Lanoue's oral representation in the form of a plat, believed its lessee's representations and made no attempt to go\nbeyond them to discover the truth or falsity thereof. On these facts, the majority has found that the discovery rule does not apply\nto the Hooks' fraud, fraudulent inducement, and statutory fraud claims and that they are barred by limitations as a matter of law.\n\nI reluctantly concur, based on the Texas Supreme Court's holding in BP America Production Co. v. Marshall, 342 S.W.3d 59\n(Tex.2011). In that case, the Texas Supreme Court makes clear that no lies on the part of a lessee, however self-serving and\negregious, are sufficient to toll limitations, as long as it is technically possible for the lessor to have discovered the lie by resort\nto the Railroad Commission records. This burden the Court imposes upon lessors is severe. It is now a lessor's duty to presume\nthat any statement made by its lessee is false and to ransack the esoteric and oft-changing records at the Railroad Commission\nto discover the truth or falsity of its lessee's statements. If, as is often the case, these records are technical in nature and require\nexpert review to ferret out the truth, it is the lessor's job to hire experts out of its own pocket to perform *442 such a review.\nIf a lessor fails to take these steps, then it will have failed in exercising reasonable diligence to protect its mineral interests and,\nif the lessee's fraud is successful for longer than the limitations period, the lessor's claims will be barred by limitations.\n\nSuch is the case here. Had the Hooks presumed that Samson's oral representations, followed by written representations, about\nthe bottom-hole location of the well were false, and had they hired an expert to resort to Railroad Commission records to\ntrace the various filings (some of which were also false), that expert could have hit upon the directional survey and, by virtue\nof his expertise, interpreted it to prove the falsity of the representations. Instead they merely relied on the oral and written\nrepresentations of their lessee, without undergoing what doubtless seemed to them the useless expense of hiring an expert to\nrake through the Railroad Commission records with an eye towards exposing a potential falsehood.\n\nI believe the Texas Supreme Court has placed an unnecessary and very heavy burden on lessors by its ruling in BP America,\none that will result either in much money being spent unnecessarily on prophylactic forensic review of Railroad Commission\nrecords or in many viable claims being lost to limitations. As we are, however, bound to follow the Court's rulings, I reluctantly\nconcur in that part of the opinion that finds the Hooks' fraud, fraudulent inducement, and statutory fraud claims barred by\nlimitations as a matter of law.\n\nI dissent, however, to that part of the majority's opinion that sustains Samson's challenge to the trial court's findings concerning\n“unpooling” by amending a unit.\n\nEarly in 2001, Samson drilled the Black Stone Minerals No. A–1 well (“BSM A-l Well”) on a separate Samson lease. The\nmineral interests underlying this lease were owned 87.5% by Black Stone Minerals and 12.5% by FirnBank.\n\nBecause Samson was without contractual authority to pool pursuant to its leases with either Black Stone or FirnBank, it sought\nto negotiate with them for such a right. Before such agreement, if any, was reached, however, Samson unilaterally concluded\nthat both of the lessors were in agreement. Pursuant to this unilateral conclusion, in March 2001, Samson filed a unit designation\nfor a 704–acre unit called the Black Stone Minerals “A” No. 1 Gas Unit (the “BSM A-l Unit”), which unitized the above-\ndescribed leases as well as the Hooks' Hardin County leases (the “Hardin County Leases”). The designation recited that it was\neffective as of the date of first production. Firnbank consented to the pooling in May 2001. Written consent to pool was also\nobtained from the Hooks. The 87.5% interest owner, Black Stone Minerals, however, declined to consent.\n\nSamson drilled and completed the BSM A–1 Well and it began producing in June 2001 from the depth range of the BSM A–\n1 Unit as designated by Samson. In December 2001, Samson finished another gas well (“Joyce DuJay No. 1 Well”) from the\nsurface of the BSM A–1 Unit that was completed within the area and depth limits of the BSM A–1 Unit. In February 2002,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                38\n\fSamson Lone Star, Ltd. Partnership v. Hooks, 389 S.W.3d 409 (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nSamson executed and recorded a designation for a Joyce DuJay No. 1 Gas Unit (“DuJay 1 Unit”) that recited an effective date\nas of first production of the DuJay No. 1 Well. Although termed an “Amendment” of the BSM A–1 Unit, it designated a new,\nsmaller, 570–acre unit with a different name, different leases, different depths and different boundaries than the BSM A–1\nUnit. The DuJay 1 Unit included some of the deeper strata of the BSM A–1 Unit, but excluded the horizon from which the\nBSM A–1 Well was producing. Thereafter, the BSM A–1 Well was produced as a *443 lease well, not included in any unit.\nSubsequently, Samson drilled another DuJay well (“DuJay A–1”) and created a separate unit for that well (the “DuJay A–1\nUnit”). The DuJay A–1 Unit differed from the DuJay 1 Unit by depth limitation and acreage. The Hooks' Hardin County Leases\nwere listed in all three unit designations: the BSM A–1, the DuJay 1, and the DuJay A–1.\n\nSamson claimed that the DuJay 1 Unit was an “amendment” of the BSM A–1 and thus that the BSM A–1 Unit no longer\nexisted. In other words, it took the position that, because it failed to sign up all the other leaseholders in the BSM A–1 Unit, it\ncould “de-designate” the earlier-designated BSM A–1 Unit. If Samson was correct, it did not need to pay the Hooks for their\nproportionate share of the BSM A–1 Well; if not, it did.\n\nThe Hooks moved for summary judgment claiming that Samson had no authority to terminate or invalidate the BSM A–1\nUnit and therefore had breached its lease contract by failing to pay the Hooks royalties on the BSM A–1 Well. The trial court\ngranted this motion. Samson, in its sixth point, contends that the trial court erred in granting this motion (and in denying its\nown cross-motion).\n\nThe majority opinion holds that, by accepting royalties from the DuJay 1 and DuJay A–1 Units, the Hooks “accepted” those\nunits and thus, “[t]heir interest in the BSM A–1 unit was, therefore, terminated, and they are estopped to deny the validity of\nthe unitization agreements for the DuJay 1 and DuJay A–1 as to their interest therein.” The majority bases this decision on its\nconclusion that “a previously designated unit necessarily terminates upon the agreement of all the parties to the agreement to\nparticipate in a unit that is incompatible with the prior unit; and the parties who have consented to a new unitization of the same\ninterests are estopped to deny termination of the prior inconsistent unit designation.” The majority posits that accepting royalties\nfrom a unit the depth or acreage of which overlaps at all with any other unit amounts to a de facto agreement to terminate any\nearlier unit containing any part of the same depth or acreage.\n\nThe Hardin County Leases, however, contain no such limitations. Instead, the Hardin County Leases give Samson the right to\nexercise pooling authority multiple times, “at any time and from time to time.” The language of the leases neither limits this\npooling authority to certain depths, nor states or implies that pooling is only valid when the multiple pools do not overlap at\nany depth. To hold instead that the right to pool multiple times is limited to units that have no overlap is to imply a term in\nthe contract that does not exist. A court is not free to make contracts for parties, nor must it imply terms in a contract without\nexercising extreme caution. See Universal Health Servs., Inc. RCW v. Renaissance Women's Group, P.A., 121 S.W.3d 742, 747\n(Tex.2003). The Texas Supreme Court has held that “terms are to be implied in contract, not because they are reasonable, but\nbecause they are necessarily involved in the contractual relationship, such that the parties must have intended them and must\nhave failed to express them only because of sheer inadvertence or because they are too obvious to need expression.” Mann\nFrankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 850 (Tex.2009) (citing 11 Richard A. Lord, Williston on\nContracts § 31:7 (4th ed.1999)). The rule set up by the majority is not one that is “necessarily involved” in the contractual\nrelationship between a lessor and lessee and we ought not imply it.\n\n *444 If such a limitation to the right to accept royalties from multiple pools exists, then, it must exist as a matter of law. The\nmajority, however, cites no law for the proposition that accepting royalties from more than one unit covering some of the same\ndepths and lands (termed “conflicting” units in the majority opinion) serves to terminate an earlier-designated unit.\n\nInstead, it is black-letter law that a lessee cannot unilaterally terminate a unit, once formed. Good-faith pooling can be exercised\nmultiple times. Expando Prod., Co. v. Marshall, 407 S.W.2d 254, 259–60 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1966, writ ref'd n.r.e.)\n(citing Texaco, Inc. v. Letterman, 343 S.W.2d 726, 731 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1961, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The right to pool leases,\nhowever, does not mean the lessee can unilaterally terminate a unit that has a producing pooled well. See Ladd Petroleum\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Eagle Oil & Gas Co., 695 S.W.2d 99, 10607 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.). When a lease provides that\na lessee may dissolve a unit, once formed, when there is no “unitized substance” being produced from the unit, the lessee may\nnot dissolve a unit as long as a well is still producing on it. See Williamson v. Mobil Producing Tex. & N.M., Inc., 737 S.W.2d\n917, 921 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 1987, writ denied) (“So, clearly, the lessee, if it is ‘after the discovery of the same,’ can change\nthe pooling unit only subsequent to the cessation of production.”).\n\nHere, no party argues that there was a cessation of production from the BSM A–1 Unit. The only basis for finding that the\nBSM A–1 Unit was no longer valid is the majority's holding that, by accepting royalty on “conflicting” pooled units, the Hooks\naccepted those units and thus their interest in the BSM A–1 Unit terminated and they are estopped to deny the validity of\nthe unitization agreements for the DuJay 1 and DuJay A–1 as to their interests. The majority cites three cases in support of\nthis proposition. See Cambridge Prod., Inc. v. Geodyne Nominee Corp., 292 S.W.3d 725, 732 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2009, pet.\ndenied); Ladd, 695 S.W.2d at 107; Whelan v. Placid Oil Co., 274 S.W.2d 125, 128 (Tex.Civ.App.Texarkana 1954, writ ref'd\nn.r.e.). None, however, actually supports the majority's position. Cambridge holds that a top-lessee, the rights of which derive\nfrom its underlying lessors, is estopped from taking the position that a unit is terminated when its underlying lessors had taken an\ninconsistent position by accepting royalties from the unit. Cambridge, 292 S.W.3d at 732. Ladd holds that “an unpooling could\nonly come about through an agreement of the lessors, or through a cessation of production as provided for in the habendum\nclauses.” Ladd, 695 S.W.2d at 107. In Whelan, the Texarkana court found that parties that have accepted royalty pursuant to a\nunitization agreement are estopped from denying the validity of the unitization agreement. Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128.\n\nAll of these cases are distinguishable from the case at bar and none set up the rule that the majority asserts. The Hooks do not\ndeny that they have “consented” to the DuJay 1 Unit. Instead, their position is that each of the units (the BSM A–1 Unit, the\nDuJay 1 Unit and the DuJay A–1 Unit) is independent of the other, and all could and did exist at the same time. Samson did\nnot exhaust its right to pool by designating the BSM A–1 Unit, so its later DuJay 1 and DuJay A–1 Units were also valid. This\nposition is consistent with the language of the pooling clause itself, which states that “[t]he above right and power to pool may\nbe exercised at any time and from time to time.”\n\nThe majority's ruling creates a new limitation on pooling, one found neither in the *445 language of the Hardin County Leases\nnor in case law, and one which has serious ramifications for the oil and gas industry. I believe that this limitation is legally\nunsupported, unnecessary, and detrimental to the legitimate interests of both lessors and lessees.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, I dissent to the portion of the majority's opinion sustaining Samson's sixth issue.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n389 S.W.3d 409, 177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

They also sought injunctive relief and declaratory judgment.\nThe 60th District Court, Jefferson County, Gary Sanderson, J., entered summary judgment on some claims and entered judgment\non jury verdict in favor of lessors on remaining claims. Cross appeals were taken. The Houston Court of Appeals, First District,\nEvelyn V. Keyes, J., 389 S.W.3d 409, affirmed in part and reversed in part. Petition for review was granted.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Supreme Court, Devine, J., held that:\n\n[1] as a matter of first impression, reasonableness of diligence in discovering alleged fraud was question of fact;\n\n[2] lessee breached most favored nations clause by increasing state's 25% royalty;\n\n[3] lessee was not required to pay royalty on volume of condensate in addition to royalty on gas volume in reservoir;\n\n[4] lessors ratified amendment altering boundaries of gas pool and changing name and, therefore, were not entitled to receive\nroyalties from old unit; and\n\n[5] four-year statute of limitations did not bar claim for recurring royalties owed within four years before filing of suit.\n\n\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n West Headnotes (23)\n\n\n [1]     Limitation of Actions        Causes of action in general\n         Limitation of Actions        Concealment of Cause of Action\n         241 Limitation of Actions\n         241II Computation of Period of Limitation\n         241II(A) Accrual of Right of Action or Defense\n         241k43 Causes of action in general\n         241 Limitation of Actions\n         241II Computation of Period of Limitation\n         241II(F) Ignorance, Mistake, Trust, Fraud, and Concealment or Discovery of Cause of Action\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 252\n\n\nOpinion\n\nJUSTICE DEVINE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this oil and gas appeal, we consider whether a mineral owner's claims of fraud *55 and breach of contract in the leasing\nand pooling of his mineral interests are, as a matter of law, barred by limitations. A jury determined that the mineral owner, in\nthe exercise of reasonable diligence, discovered the fraud less than four years before filing suit, and the trial court accordingly\nconcluded that the claims were not barred by limitations. The jury also found fraud and damages in the mineral owner's favor,\nand the trial court rendered judgment on the jury's verdict. The court of appeals, however, reversed most aspects of the mineral\nowner's judgment, concluding that the fraud should have been discovered, as a matter of law, more than four years before the\nmineral owner filed suit because the relevant information was available in the Texas Railroad Commission's public records.\n389 S.W.3d 409, 429–30, 439–40 (Tex.App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2012).\n\nWhile we agree that public records may under certain circumstances establish a lack of diligence in the discovery of fraud as a\nmatter of law, here the records themselves were tainted by fraud and thus provide no conclusive proof on the subject. Because\nwe conclude that the mineral owner's diligence in discovering the underlying fraud was in this instance a question of fact for\nthe jury, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment on this and other issues in part, affirm its judgment on other issues in part,\nand remand the cause to the court of appeals for review of a factual sufficiency of the evidence complaint and other issues not\nconsidered because of the court's ruling on limitations.\n\n\n\n                                              I.

Later amendments to Hooks' petition included allegations of fraud, fraudulent inducement, and\nstatutory fraud. These claims centered on three oil and gas leases that Hooks, the lessor, executed with Samson, the lessee, in\n1999. Two leases were in Hardin County, Texas (the “Hardin County Leases”), and one was in Jefferson County, Texas (the\n“Jefferson County Lease”).\n\n1      The plaintiffs consist of multiple parties. We refer to them collectively as “Hooks.” Specifically, the parties are Charles G. Hooks\n       III, acting individually and as independent executor of the estate of Charles G. Hooks, Jr., as Trustee of the Scott Ira McKeever Trust\n       and the David Wayne McKeever Trust, and on behalf of Chas. G. Hooks & Son, a General Partnership; McKeever Partnership, Ltd.;\n       and Charles G. Hooks III and Sue Ann Hooks, as co-trustees under the will of Charles G. Hooks, Sr.\n2      Hooks joined a preexisting lawsuit brought by various lessors against Samson. Hooks' suit was later severed from the other claims.\nThis appeal from a final judgment involves seven claims raised by Hooks. First, Hooks alleges that Samson fraudulently induced\nHooks to amend the Jefferson County Lease to allow for pooling. Second, Hooks asserts that Samson breached the most-\nfavored-nations clause in all three leases, failing to pay Hooks the same higher royalty that it paid to a nearby lessor. Third,\nHooks contends that Samson breached the formation-production clause in each lease by calculating gas royalties based on\nproceeds instead of the volume of gas leaving the reservoir. Fourth, Hooks claims that Samson wrongly “unpooled” a unit into\nwhich the two Hardin County Leases were pooled, and seeks damages for royalties allegedly owed from this unit. Fifth, Hooks\nalleges that *56 Samson breached certain offset provisions in the two Hardin County Leases. Sixth, pursuant to a pretrial\nstipulation, Hooks contends that Samson must reimburse Hooks for attorney's fees. And seventh, Hooks asserts that the proper\npost-judgment interest rate is 18%, rather than 5% as decided by the court of appeals.\n\nHooks prevailed on the majority of his claims in the trial court. The trial court granted summary judgment for Hooks on the most-\nfavored-nations clause claims and “unpooling” claims, but granted summary judgment for Samson regarding Hooks' allegations\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 252\n\nthat Samson breached the offset provisions of the Hardin County Leases. The jury returned a verdict for Hooks on the fraud\nand formation-production claims. The trial court's final judgment awarded Hooks more than $21 million in damages, ordered\nSamson to pay the stipulated attorney's fees, and applied a post-judgment interest rate of 18%. The court of appeals, however,\nreversed, holding that Hooks take nothing except for $52,257.22, a stipulated amount to reimburse Hooks for payment of ad\nvalorem taxes. Id. at 440–41.\n\n\n\n                                                       II. Fraud and Limitations\n\nHooks' fraud claims relate to the Jefferson County Lease. This lease, which prohibited pooling, contained “offset obligations”\nproviding that if a gas well were completed within 1,320 feet of Hooks' lease line but was not unitized with Hooks' acreage,\nthen Samson would either drill an offset well, pay Hooks compensatory royalties, or release the offset acreage. In 2000, Samson\ndrilled a well that bottomed about 1,186 feet from Hooks' lease, within the 1,320–foot protected zone. But, instead of complying\nwith the original offset obligations, Samson asked Hooks to amend the Jefferson County Lease in 2001 to pool into a unit\nassociated with the new well. In connection with this request, Samson provided Hooks with a plat that incorrectly placed the\nwell's bottom hole outside of the protected zone. A plat with the same false information had already been filed with the Railroad\nCommission. Older Railroad Commission records, however, contained a directional survey and an attached plat 3 that correctly\nplaced the bottom hole within the 1,320–foot boundary. 4 Other preliminary Railroad Commission filings demonstrated that\nSamson originally intended the well to bottom within 1,320 feet of Hooks' lease.\n\n3      The parties dispute whether, based on the record in this case, the plat was attached to the directional survey in the Railroad Commission\n       filing. This does not affect our holding, and we assume without deciding that it was attached.\n4      Although the plat correctly placed the bottom hole within the protected zone, some data on the plat does not completely correspond\n       to data on a later correct plat.\nHooks brought his fraud claims in 2007, alleging that Samson deprived Hooks of compensatory royalties by misrepresenting the\nwell's bottom-hole location and fraudulently inducing Hooks to amend the lease and pool. A jury found that Samson committed\nfraud and statutory fraud, awarding more than $20 million in damages on these claims, and the trial court rendered judgment\non the jury's verdict. The court of appeals, however, reversed, holding that the four-year statute of limitations for fraud barred\nthe claims. Id. at 428–29 (citing TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODEE § 16.004(a)(4)).\n\nHooks argues that the court of appeals erred because the statute of limitations did not begin to run until Hooks “knew or\nshould have known of facts that in the exercise of reasonable diligence would have led to the discovery of the wrongful *57\nact.” Exxon Corp. v. Emerald Oil & Gas Co., 348 S.W.3d 194, 216 (Tex.2011) (quoting Little v. Smith, 943 S.W.2d 414, 420\n(Tex.1997)). The jury found that, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, Hooks should have discovered Samson's fraud by\n2007. Samson responds that, as a matter of law, reasonable diligence would have discovered the true location of the well's\nbottom hole in 2000 or 2001. Samson points to this Court's decisions in BP America Production Co. v. Marshall, 342 S.W.3d 59\n(Tex.2011), and Shell Oil Co. v. Ross, 356 S.W.3d 924 (Tex.2011), where reasonable diligence required sophisticated lessors\nto acquaint themselves with “readily accessible and publicly available information” from Railroad Commission records. Ross,\n356 S.W.3d at 929; see Marshall, 342 S.W.3d at 68–69. According to Samson, the directional survey and its associated plat, as\nwell as filings showing the original proposed location of the well's bottom hole, should have been discovered by the exercise\nof reasonable diligence by 2001 at the latest, meaning that Hooks' fraud claims are barred by limitations.\n\n[1]    [2] We have long held that “fraud prevents the running of the statute of limitations until it is discovered, or by the exercise\nof reasonable diligence might have been discovered.” Ruebeck v. Hunt, 142 Tex. 167,176 S.W.2d 738, 739 (1943). 5 Generally,\n“[c]auses of action accrue and statutes of limitation begin to run when facts come into existence that authorize a claimant to\nseek a judicial remedy,” Emerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 202, but “a person cannot be permitted to avoid liability for his actions by\ndeceitfully concealing wrongdoing until limitations has run,” S.V. v. R.V., 933 S.W.2d 1, 6 (Tex.1996). Because “fraud vitiates\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 252\n\nwhatever it touches,” Borderlon v. Peck, 661 S.W.2d 907, 909 (Tex.1983), limitations does not start to run until the fraud is\ndiscovered or the exercise of reasonable diligence would discover it, Marshall, 342 S.W.3d at 69.\n\n5      See also Emerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 216; Marshall, 342 S.W.3d at 68; Computer Assocs. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 918 S.W.2d 453,\n       455 (Tex.1996); Woods v. William M. Mercer, Inc., 769 S.W.2d 515, 517 (Tex.1988).\n [3] [4] The same rule applies to claims of fraudulent inducement. Fraudulent inducement is a subspecies of fraud; “with a\nfraudulent inducement claim, the elements of fraud must be established as they relate to an agreement between the parties.”\nHaase v. Glazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 798–99 (Tex.2001). Accordingly, the same principle applies: limitations does not start to\nrun until the fraud with respect to the contract is discovered or the exercise of reasonable diligence would discover it.\n\n\n [5] [6] And just when would reasonable diligence discover the wrong? And who decides? 6 Although “the date a cause\nof action accrues is normally a question of law,” *58 Etan Indus., Inc. v. Lehmann, 359 S.W.3d 620, 623 (Tex.2011) (per\ncuriam), reasonable diligence is an issue of fact, Estate of Stonecipher v. Estate of Butts, 591 S.W.2d 806, 809 (Tex.1979). 7\nNevertheless, in some circumstances, we can still determine as a matter of law that reasonable diligence would have uncovered\nthe wrong. 8 A survey of our decisions reveals the reasons for holding, as a matter of law, that the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence would lead to the discovery of the wrong within the statutory period. 9\n\n6      Hooks and amicus Cardwell, Hart & Bennett, LLP cite cases stating that if there is a fraudulent misrepresentation, it is no defense that\n       proper inquiry might have revealed the truth. See, e.g., Buchanan v. Burnett, 102 Tex. 492, 119 S.W. 1141, 1142 (1909); Labbe v.\n       Corbett, 69 Tex. 503, 6 S.W. 808, 811 (1888); Mitchell v. Zimmerman, 4 Tex. 75, 79–80 (1849). These cases, however, stand for the\n       general proposition that one may be liable for fraud even if it could be discovered by due diligence; they do not hold that limitations\n       is extended even if due diligence would reveal the fraud. Also, at least one amicus, Cardwell, Hart & Bennett, LLP, invokes a lessee's\n       implied covenant to act as a reasonably prudent operator. But we held in HECI Exploration Co. v. Neel that “[i]mplied covenants\n       do not dispense with the need for royalty owners to exercise due diligence in enforcing their contractual rights, express or implied,\n       within the statutory limitations period.” 982 S.W.2d 881, 887 (Tex.1998).\n7      See also Shah v. Moss, 67 S.W.3d 836, 846 (Tex.2001) (“To avoid summary judgment on limitations grounds, Moss must have raised\n       a fact issue to support his fraudulent-concealment assertion.”); Hurlbut v. Gulf Atl. Life Ins. Co., 749 S.W.2d 762, 766 (Tex.1987)\n       (“[W]e agree that whether the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the fraud ... raises a fact issue....”); Borderlon, 661 S.W.2d at\n       909 (“A fact issue exists whether, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, Borderlon knew, or should have known ..., that the presence\n       of the foreign object in her abdomen gave rise to a cause of action against Dr. Peck.”); Cherry v. Victoria Equip. & Supply, Inc., 645\n       S.W.2d 781, 782 (Tex.1983) (“The ultimate duty to weigh the evidence, determine credibility and decide if fraudulent concealment\n       actually existed rests upon the trier of fact.”); Ruebeck, 176 S.W.2d at 740 (“What will constitute reasonable diligence to discover\n       fraud and when the fraud might have been discovered by the exercise of such diligence are necessarily questions which must be\n       determined from all the facts and circumstances in evidence in each particular case. When, under the facts in evidence, reasonable\n       minds might differ on such issues, the findings of the jury thereon are binding on the appellate court.”).\n8      See, e.g., Etan Indus., 359 S.W.3d at 623 (“On these facts, we hold as a matter of law that the estoppel effect of the alleged fraudulent\n       concealment ended in December 2002 at the latest. By that date, the Lehmanns were apprised of facts, conditions, and circumstances\n       sufficient to cause a reasonable person to make inquiry that would lead to the discovery of the concealed cause of action.”); Ross, 356\n       S.W.3d at 929 (“Because the Rosses could have discovered Shell's alleged fraud through the use of reasonable diligence, we hold\n       that, as a matter of law, the doctrine of fraudulent concealment cannot apply to toll the statute of limitations.”); Marshall, 342 S.W.3d\n       at 69 (“[A]s a matter of law, the Marshalls would have been able to discover BP's fraud through the use of reasonable diligence.”);\n       Kerlin v.

Although fraudulent concealment allows the statute of\n       limitations to be tolled for causes of action besides fraud itself, the standard of reasonable diligence remains the same: “Fraudulent\n       concealment only tolls the running of limitations until the fraud is discovered or could have been discovered with reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 252\n\n       diligence.” Marshall, 342 S.W.3d at 67. Consequently, cases discussing fraudulent concealment are relevant to the meaning of\n       reasonable diligence.\nIn Shell Oil Co. v. Ross, we considered untimely claims made by Ross—an attorney who “understood the oil and gas industry”—\nand his family that Shell had underpaid gas royalties. 356 S.W.3d at 926. Despite Shell's allegedly fraudulent representations,\nthe Rosses had a duty to “make themselves aware of relevant information available in the public record.” Id. at 928. We held that\n“[d]iligence is required when claimants have been ‘put on notice of the alleged harm of injury-causing actions.’ ” Id. (quoting\nEmerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 207). 10 Discrepancies in royalties paid to the Rosses on different wells put them on notice. Id. at\n929. A publicly available price index illuminated the underpayments, *59 as did General Land Office records demonstrating\nthat Shell paid higher royalties to the State even though it owed the Rosses the same royalty. Id. Had the Rosses exercised\nreasonable diligence, this “[r]eadily accessible and publicly available information” would have revealed the underpayments.\nId. Accordingly, as a matter of law, they did not exercise reasonable diligence.\n\n10     Samson and Hooks dispute whether parties must be put on notice of potential harm before they have a duty to exercise reasonable\n       diligence, as well as whether Hooks was on notice. We need not reach these questions here. Instead, we decide the case by assuming,\n       without deciding, that Hooks should exercise reasonable diligence.\nIn BP America Production Co. v. Marshall, we held that the statute of limitations was not tolled when BP fraudulently\nrepresented that it was maintaining continuous operations on a lease. 342 S.W.3d at 67–69. This case also involved a\nsophisticated plaintiff who “understood the oil and gas industry.” Id. at 69. The public record contained two public filings with\nthe Railroad Commission: a well log and a plugging report that contained “highly technical information.” Id. at 66. Had the\nMarshalls read these two documents together, they would have discovered that BP was not conducting good-faith continuous\noperations. Id. at 69. “[A]s a matter of law, the Marshalls would have been able to discover BP's fraud th[r]ough the use of\nreasonable diligence.” Id.\n\nWe have reached similar conclusions in other cases. For example, if the plaintiff has “actual knowledge ... of injury-causing\nconduct,” then this “starts the clock on the limitations period” “[i]rrespective of the potential effect of fraudulent concealment.”\nEmerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 209. The availability of court records may indicate under some circumstances that reasonable\ndiligence would have found the information. See Kerlin, 263 S.W.3d at 926. Land title records and probate proceedings create\nconstructive notice, “an irrebuttable presumption of actual notice,” which prevents limitations from being delayed. Mooney\nv. Harlin, 622 S.W.2d 83, 85 (Tex.1981); Sherman v. Sipper, 137 Tex. 85, 152 S.W.2d 319, 321 (1941). These cases reveal\nthat when there is actual or constructive notice, or when information is “readily accessible and publicly available,” Ross, 356\nS.W.3d at 929, then, as a matter of law, the accrual of a fraud claim is not delayed.\n\n [7] The present case does not fall into any of the categories where we can determine, as a matter of law, that reasonable\ndiligence would have timely uncovered the fraud. Though Samson relies extensively on Marshall and Ross, Hooks correctly\nidentifies an important distinction: in those cases, the public record itself was not tainted by the fraud. We have not previously\nconsidered whether reasonable diligence would uncover a correct public Railroad Commission filing when more recent filings\ncontain false information.\n\nIn December 2000, Samson submitted a plat to the Railroad Commission as part of an application to pool. The plat was signed\nby Glenn Lanoue, Samson's landman, and dated November 16, 2000, certifying that it was “a true and correct plat based on\nthe best of my knowledge.” The plat had a label stating “Proposed Well Location,” but, unlike some earlier plats in the record,\nthe individual data on this plat were not themselves also marked as “proposed.” The plat gave “X” and “Y” coordinates for\nthe well's bottom-hole location, the distance of the well from various survey lines, and the well's surface location along with\nthe bottom hole's location relative to the surface. Trial testimony established that this data is internally consistent, placing the\nwell's bottom hole more than 1,320 feet from Hooks' lease line even though the well actually bottomed within the 1,320–foot\nprotected zone. When Lanoue was asked where he obtained the bottom hole's distance from the survey *60 lines, he testified\nthat he created them himself. 11\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                  11\n\fHooks v. Samson Lone Star, Limited Partnership, 457 S.W.3d 52 (2015)\n58 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 252\n\n11     His deposition testimony was: “I got them from myself.”\nSamson later provided a plat with the same information to Hooks in connection with Samson's request to amend the lease and\nallow pooling. Samson argues the plat was ambiguous and indefinite, creating a need for Hooks, an experienced oil and gas\nlessor, to investigate further. On the plat is the notation “1400' ± scaled,” but trial testimony presented different interpretations\nof what points this distance measured between. Elsewhere, the plat expressly states that the bottom-hole location is “1400' ±\nscaled' FEL Unit.” Testimony indicated that “FEL” means “from the eastern line” of the pooled unit. Another testified that\ntaking the notation literally would be unreasonable because if the well truly bottomed about 1,400 feet from the eastern line of\nthe unit, as opposed to Hooks' lease line, it would be very close to Hooks' lease, perhaps even within it.\n\nMonths earlier, a directional survey performed by an independent surveyor and an accompanying plat were filed with the\nRailroad Commission. Some information on the directional survey clearly contradicts the Lanoue plat discussed above, and\nSamson urges that the information on the survey could have easily been used to estimate the bottom hole's true location. Hooks\nargues that it would take an expert to interpret the survey and pinpoint its location.\n\nWe cannot say that, as a matter of law, Hooks should have discovered the accurate information when the more recent filing\nfalsely conveyed that the well had been completed outside the protected zone. Although reasonable diligence should examine\nreadily available information in the public record, it may stop at more recent filings with the Railroad Commission, without\nneeding to double-check more recent filings against earlier filings. This accords with our prior decisions. We have held that\n“fraud vitiates whatever it touches,” Borderlon, 661 S.W.2d at 909, in this case, the public record. We have held that not all\nRailroad Commission records create constructive notice, HECI Exploration Co., 982 S.W.2d at 886, meaning that, in some\ncircumstances, Railroad Commission filings may exist that one is not charged with discovering. We have held that fraudulent\nconcealment is “an equitable doctrine that ... is fact-specific.” Marshall, 342 S.W.3d at 67. And we have held that “a person\ncannot be permitted to avoid liability for his actions by deceitfully concealing wrongdoing until limitations has run.” S.V., 933\nS.W.2d at 6. Though reasonable diligence should lead to information in the public record, here, the fraudulent information itself\ntaints the public record. To require, as a matter of law, that Hooks double-check the more recent filings against earlier filings\nis a higher burden than reasonable diligence requires.\n\nSamson argues that the directional survey is the “gold standard,” and that the fraudulent plat was filed to show unit lines for\npooling purposes, not to provide the exact location of the well's bottom hole. Samson observes that, in some situations, Texas\nlaw mandates directional surveys performed by independent surveyors, see 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 3.11(c)(2)(A); 3.12\n(Tex.R.R. Comm'n), and asserts that Hooks should have known this and looked for the survey to establish the bottom hole's true\nlocation. Samson also argues that because Lanoue told Hooks the well was about 1,500 feet from the lease line, but then sent\nHooks a plat indicating the bottom hole was about 1,400 feet away, very close to the protected zone, these *61 inconsistencies\nshould have caused Hooks to inquire further. None of these arguments avail. Had Hooks gone to the Railroad Commission,\nthe more recent filing would have been a plat with the same inaccurate information, placing the well's bottom hole beyond the\nprotected zone. Hooks is not required, as a matter of law, to double-check it against the earlier directional survey. To the extent\nsome information on the Lanoue plat is unclear, a careful reader could have examined other information on the plat (e.g., the\n“X” and “Y” coordinates, distances from lease lines, and location of the bottom hole relative to the surface) to resolve any\nambiguity, determining that the plat placed the bottom hole outside the protected zone. Indeed, Hooks presented testimony that\nthis plat clearly placed the bottom hole outside of the protected zone. Thus, though Samson's arguments regarding potential\nambiguities on the plat, and the availability and superiority of the directional survey, may be appropriate for the factfinder to\nconsider when determining whether reasonable diligence would have uncovered the fraud, they do not establish that, as a matter\nof law, Hooks did not exercise reasonable diligence.\n\nAmicus Texas Oil and Gas Association suggests that holding for Hooks will encourage litigants to guise their breach-of-contract\nclaims as fraud claims to avoid the statute of limitations. We disagree. To establish fraudulent inducement, “the elements of\nfraud must be established as they relate to an agreement between the parties.” Haase, 62 S.W.3d at 798–99. Many breach-of-\ncontract cases do not implicate the elements of fraud. Only when fraud is established with regard to the contract may fraudulent\ninducement be established, and, in any case, the suit is based on the fraud itself rather than a breach of contract. Moreover,\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              12\n\fHooks v. Samson Lone Star, Limited Partnership, 457 S.W.3d 52 (2015)\n58 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 252\n\nbecause fraudulent concealment may toll the statute of limitations for contract claims, no incentive will exist to recast them\nas fraud claims.\n\nWe hold that when the defendant's fraudulent misrepresentations extend to the Railroad Commission record itself, earlier\ninconsistent filings cannot be used to establish, as a matter of law, that reasonable diligence was not exercised. Under these\ncircumstances, reasonable diligence remains a fact question. The factfinder, no doubt, may consider the failure to examine\nolder records when determining whether reasonable diligence was exercised, but their availability is not enough to establish\nthat reasonable diligence was not exercised as a matter of law.\n\nBecause the court of appeals mistakenly concluded that the date by which Hooks reasonably should have discovered Samson's\nfraud was a question of law, it did not reach Samson's other arguments concerning Hooks' fraudulent inducement claims. See\n389 S.W.3d at 428–30. These include the factual and legal sufficiency of the evidence with regard to common-law fraud,\nstatutory fraud, and damages for fraud, as well as the factual sufficiency of the evidence regarding when Hooks, by the exercise\nof reasonable diligence, would have discovered the fraud. We remand these issues for the court of appeals' consideration.\n\n\n\n                                    III. Breach of Most–Favored–Nations Clause Claims\n\n [8] When an oil and gas lease contains a most-favored-nations clause, it typically provides that a lessee who pays higher\nroyalties on nearby leases must pay matching royalties to the lessor under the subject lease. Here, all three leases contain an\nidentical most-favored-nations clause, providing that\n\n              *62 If Lessee shall enter into an oil and gas lease(s) part of which is located within three (3) miles\n             of any exterior boundary of the subject lands covered by the subject Lease, hereinafter referred to as\n             “Third Party Lease”, Lessee shall notify Lessor of such fact. If the reserved royalty or the amount per\n             acre payable for delay rentals, shut-in rentals or minimum royalty, at any time payable under such Third\n             Party Lease, is higher than the like royalty and amounts payable as provided in the subject Lease, the\n             royalty or amount payable per acre in the subject lease, which is less than that provided in the Third Party\n             Lease shall be immediately increased so that it will equal the royalty or other amounts payable under the\n             Third Party Lease. The subject Lease and the Third Party Lease must be calculated in substantially the\n             same manner, such that the comparison of the subject Lease and the Third Party Lease is based on the\n             same effective net royalty or other payments, and that same shall include or deduct the same types of\n             charges, taxes and other burdens from such interests.\n\nThe trial court determined on summary judgment that Samson breached the clause by paying a higher royalty to the State of\nTexas.\n\nSamson leased a qualifying oil and gas interest from the State at the same 25% royalty Samson paid Hooks. In 2003, to induce\nthe State to consent to a Pooling Agreement, Samson increased the State's royalty. This Pooling Agreement allocates production\namong different interest owners based on their individual shares in their own tracts and the proportion that their tracts play in\nthe overall unit. This general allocation is made “provided that the state [']s unit royalty interest shall be 0.7969%.” Considering\nthe size of the State's tract relative to the size of the entire unit, this is equivalent to a royalty of 28.28896% on the production\nallocated to the State's tract. In other words, the State's royalty of 0.7969% on production from the unit equates to a 28.28896%\nroyalty on production allocated to the State's tract.\n\nSamson argues that the most-favored-nations clause does not apply because the clause regards the “reserved royalty ... payable\nunder” another lease, whereas Samson paid the State higher royalties under the Pooling Agreement. If the clause were to apply\nto more than just leases, then it would have said so, Samson argues. Samson also asserts that the Pooling Agreement increased\nthe State's allocation of production from the unit without raising the royalty.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 252\n\n [9] [10] [11] [12] We disagree. To resolve this dispute, we apply the “ ‘primary legal consequence’ of pooling to this case\n—that production anywhere on a pooled unit is treated as production on every tract in the unit.” See Key Operating & Equip.,\nInc. v. Hegar, 435 S.W.3d 794, 798–99 (Tex.2014) (quoting See Pipe Line Co. v. Tichacek, 997 S.W.2d 166, 170 (Tex.1999)).\nThe reason a lessor receives royalties under a pooling agreement, even if no production occurs directly on that lessor's tract, is\nbecause production elsewhere on the pooled unit is attributed to the lessor's tract. And the reason the lessor receives royalties\non production attributed to the lessor's tract is because of the underlying lease. It follows that a lessor's royalty on production\nfrom the unit as a whole reflects the lessor's royalty on production from its individual tracts in proportion to the size of the\ntracts relative to the overall unit. This accords with the nature of pooling, which “effects a cross-conveyance among the owners\nof minerals under the various tracts of royalty or minerals in a *63 pool so that they all own undivided interests under the\nunitized tract in the proportion their contribution bears to the unitized tract.” Montgomery v. Rittersbacher, 424 S.W.2d 210,\n213 (Tex.1968). In other words, the royalty owed on production from the whole unit is necessarily tied to the royalty owed on\nproduction from the lessor's individual tracts. To increase one is to increase the other.\n\nThus, by definition, Samson's grant of a royalty to the State of 0.7969% on production from the unit means that Samson increased\nthe State's 25% royalty on production from its tract to 28.28896%. For purposes of the most-favored-nations clause, the royalty\nimposed by the Pooling Agreement is “payable under” the lease, and the Pooling Agreement itself states that it was entered\ninto by the State “as Lessor” and Samson “as Lessee.”\n\nThe court of appeals here defined a most-favored-nations clause as “a vendor protection clause” that “enables the vendor to\nreceive the benefit of increases in the market price of his product over the term of a long range contract with a purchaser.” 389\nS.W.3d at 435 (quoting Lone Star Gas Co. v. Howard Corp., 556 S.W.2d 372, 374 (Tex.Civ.App.–Texarkana 1977), writ ref'd\nn.r.e., 568 S.W.2d 129 (Tex.1978) (per curiam)) (emphasis added). Though this may be the purpose of such clauses, unless they\nexpressly so provide, we are not authorized to examine whether increased prices were caused by market forces or, as seems to\nbe the case here, other considerations. The reason for giving the State a higher royalty—inducing it to pool—is irrelevant in\ndetermining whether the most-favored-nations clause applies.\n\nFor all these reasons, we conclude that the court of appeals erred in holding that Samson did not breach the most-favored-\nnations clause.\n\n\n\n                                    IV. Breach of Formation–Production Clause Claims\n\n [13] Article III of each lease specifies a 25% royalty on “gas, including casinghead gas or other gaseous substances produced\nfrom said land,” as well as a 25% royalty on “all other liquid hydrocarbons that may be produced from said land.” At the end\nof Article III, each lease also states that\n\n            For the purposes of calculating all royalties payable under Article III. herein, it is expressly provided that\n            all such calculations shall be based on formation production as reported on Texas Railroad Commission\n            forms P–1 and P–2.\n\nHooks claims that Samson has paid gas royalties on proceeds from gas sales rather than on the total amount of formation\nproduction. Samson disputes Hooks' interpretation of the formation-production clause. The trial court awarded damages for\nbreach of the clause, but the court of appeals reversed. 389 S.W.3d at 437.\n\n [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] “In construing contracts, we must ascertain and give effect to the parties' intentions as expressed\nin the document.” Lopez v.

J. 252\n\nrules of construction, the contract can be given a definite meaning, we construe it *64 as a matter of law. Frost Nat'l Bank,\n165 S.W.3d at 312.\n\nThe parties do not dispute the meaning of formation production; rather, they dispute what it means to calculate all royalties\nbased on formation production. As used on the old Railroad Commission forms P–1 and P–2, 12 formation production describes\nthe total volume of gas removed from the underground reservoir. Not all gas, however, that leaves the reservoir as gas continues\nto be a gas at the surface; instead, some condenses. “Condensate is hydrocarbons that exist in the form of gas when contained\nin the natural gas reservoir underground, which condense into a liquid form when released from the reservoir's higher pressure\nand temperature.” Bowden v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 247 S.W.3d 690, 704 n.7 (Tex.2008). When reporting the total volume\nof gas removed from the reservoir to the Railroad Commission, Samson would convert the volume of condensate at the surface\nto its equivalent volume as a gas.\n\n12     These forms, referred to by the leases, are no longer used by the Railroad Commission. Instead, Form PR has replaced them.\n       According to the instructions accompanying Form PR, “[f]or gas well gas, you no longer need to convert the condensate production\n       to a gas equivalent volume; the RRC will automatically convert the volume.” TEX. R.R. COMM'N, INSTRUCTIONS FORM P R:\n       MONTHLY PRODUCTION REPORT, available at http:// www.rrc.texas.gov/media/2646/formpr–instructions–final–02–2005.pdf.\n       This opinion need not—and does not—interpret “formation production” as used by the new form.\nHooks argues that because all royalties must be based on formation production, and formation production is the volume of all\nproduction while it existed in the reservoir as gas, then the 25% royalty paid on gas should be for the volume of gas removed\nfrom the reservoir instead of the volume of gas at the surface. Notably, however, Hooks contends that Samson must still pay a\n25% royalty on the volume of condensate taken from the wellhead. In other words, Hooks asserts that the formation-production\nclause requires that a 25% royalty be paid on the liquid condensate, which must then be converted to its equivalent in gas\nvolume so that another 25% royalty may be paid on it again. Samson responds that Hooks' interpretation unreasonably imposes\na double royalty by requiring Samson to pay royalties on condensate twice: first as condensate, and then again as a gas as part\nof formation production. Samson submits that the formation-production clause means Samson must pay for produced minerals,\neither as gas or as condensate, but not that Samson must pay royalties on condensate twice.\n\nThe formation-production clause provides that all royalty calculations be based on formation production. Hooks' approach,\nhowever, causes only gas royalties (for gas as gas and for condensate as gas) to be based on formation production. For royalties\non condensate as condensate, Hooks' approach bases them solely on the amount of condensate without reference to formation\nproduction. We disagree with that interpretation.\n\nThe formation-production clause simply requires Samson to convert the volume of condensate to its equivalent volume in\ngas, ensuring that the total volume that Samson pays royalties on relates to the volume that Samson reports to the Railroad\nCommission. The conversion ensures that Samson pays royalties on an appropriate volume of production, not that Samson pays\nroyalties on some production twice. In other words, the clause does not require that royalties be paid on everything as gas.\nOtherwise, the instruction that all royalties be based on formation production would be ignored, because royalties would be\npaid on condensate without reference to formation *65 production. This interpretation of the clause, unlike Hooks', allows\nroyalties on condensate (as well as on gas) to be based on formation production, as the leases require.\n\nHooks also argues that Samson failed to pay royalties on gas that was not ultimately sold, such as lost or consumed gas. Hooks\npoints to the testimony of a Samson employee that Samson pays royalties based on dollars received rather than on formation\nproduction. But Hooks presented no evidence of the royalties that should have been paid on the unsold gas; Hooks merely\naggregates this amount (if any) with the royalties that Hooks claims are owed on condensate when converted back to gas. Absent\nspecific evidence of damages for lost and used gas—as opposed to a combined amount for lost and used gas and condensate as\npart of formation production—Hooks cannot prevail, and thus we need not determine whether Samson breached the contract by\nfailing to pay royalties on lost and used gas. In sum, we agree with the court of appeals' decision with regard to the formation-\nproduction claims.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 252\n\n\n\n                                                     V. “Unpooling” Claims\n\n [19] The two Hardin County Leases authorized Samson to pool. Samson pooled both of Hooks' Hardin County Leases into the\n“Blackstone Minerals ‘A’ No. 1” unit, effective as of the date of first production in June 2001. Because the owner of 87.5%\nof the mineral interest in the tract where the well in this unit was located refused to pool, Samson decided to “amend” the unit\ndesignation. A letter from Samson dated October 24, 2001, notified Hooks of an “Amendment and Name Change of Black\nStone Minerals ‘A’ No. 1 Unit Designation, Hardin County, Texas”:\n\n  Reference is made to Samson Lone Star Limited Partnership's letter dated March 20, 2001, in which approval to pool on\n  640–acre plus 10% tolerance was received. Please note that the Unit Designation for the Black Stone Minerals “A” No. 1 is\n  being amended and will now be called the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit.\n\n  No additional action is needed on your part, this letter is meant for informational purposes only. Please update your records\n  with the new name and call the undersigned should you have any questions.\n\nThe amended unit was effective in January 2002, when production began.\n\nAs filed in the Hardin County records, the amendment did not merely change the name of the existing unit but also significantly\naltered its boundaries. Whereas the original unit extended from a depth of 6,000 feet to a depth of 13,800 feet, the new Joyce\nDu Jay No. 1 Unit, beginning at 12,400 feet below surface, extends down without limit. Samson has paid Hooks royalties on\nproduction from the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit, but not from the original Blackstone Minerals A–1 Unit. Accordingly, Hooks\nseeks royalties on the original unit, claiming that Samson did not have the authority to “unpool” the Blackstone Minerals A–\n1 Unit. The trial court agreed, granting summary judgment in Hooks' favor. Samson responds—and the court of appeals held\n—that Hooks ratified the new unit by accepting royalties on it, and therefore cannot recover from the old unit. 389 S.W.3d at\n434. Samson also asserts that if Hooks is entitled to royalties from the original unit, then these should be offset by the royalties\nHooks has already received on the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit.\n\nNotably, Hooks does not question the validity of the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit; rather, Hooks alleges that he should receive\nroyalties from both the original unit *66 and the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit. Hooks notes that the Hardin County Leases allowed\nunlimited pooling. Although Samson claimed it was “amending” the original unit, Hooks suggests that the change effectively\nadded another unit without eliminating the original one.\n\nFactually, Hooks' position is problematic. Samson's letter to Hooks made clear that it purported to “amend” the unit designation,\nnot merely create an additional unit. The letter stated that it concerned an “amendment and name change,” (emphasis added),\nso Hooks should have been aware that the pooled area could change. The original designation and the amended designation,\nas well as their differences, were a matter of public record. Though Hooks did not know exactly how Samson amended the\nunit designation, Hooks was nevertheless aware that Samson amended it, and Hooks regularly accepted royalty checks for the\nJoyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit without ever receiving royalties on the earlier designation. Under these circumstances, Hooks cannot\nclaim additional royalties from the older unit because Hooks ratified the amendment, having full knowledge that something\nhad changed and by his actions consenting to it, failing even to challenge the new unit. See Fortune Prod. Co. v. Conoco, Inc.,\n52 S.W.3d 671, 677 (Tex.2000). Because Hooks does not deny the validity of the new unit, one that existed only after Hooks\nwas notified that the old unit was being amended, Hooks cannot later assert that he should also receive royalties from the old\nunit. See Ohrt v. Union Gas Corp., 398 S.W.3d 315, 329 (Tex.App.–Corpus Christi 2012, pet. denied) (“Prolonged silence or\ninaction in not asserting a known right is conduct that may amount to waiver.”); see also Bob Montgomery Chevrolet, Inc. v.\nDent Zone Cos., 409 S.W.3d 181, 195 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2013, no pet.) (“Any act inconsistent with an intent to avoid a contract\nhas the effect of ratifying the contract.”). Because of the undisputed contents of the notice letter, Hooks' acceptance of royalties\nfor the new unit, and Hooks' refusal to challenge the new unit, we decide the question of ratification as a matter of law. 13\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We affirm\nthe judgment of the court of appeals with regard to Hooks' “unpooling” claims.\n\n\n\n                                   VI. Breach of Hardin County Offset Provision Claims\n\nLike the Jefferson County Lease, the two Hardin County Leases also contain offset provisions requiring that if a well is\ncompleted within 1,320 feet of Hooks' lease line but is not unitized with Hooks' acreage, then within ninety days of production\nfrom the infringing well, Samson must either drill an offset well, pay Hooks compensatory royalties, or release the offset acreage.\nUnder these offset provisions, if Samson elects to pay compensatory royalties, then it has a recurring monthly obligation to pay\nthem. The first compensatory royalty would be due “following the expiration of ninety (90) days after the end *67 of said\ncalendar month in which production [is] first marketed.”\n\nThe Hardin County Leases allow pooling and also contain what the parties have termed an “entire-acreage clause”:\n\n            Operations for drilling on or production of gas from any part of the pooled unit which includes all or a\n            portion of the Leased Premises ... shall be considered as operations for drilling on or production of gas\n            from the Leased Premises, ... and the entire acreage constituting such unit or units shall be treated for\n            all purposes, except the payment of royalties on production from the pooled unit, as if the same were\n            included in this Lease.\n\n\nSamson pooled the Hardin County Leases and drilled additional gas wells within 1,320 feet of the pooled units but more than\n1,320 feet from Hooks' individual tracts. Hooks argues that the entire-acreage clause extended the 1,320–foot protected zone\naround the units themselves, and that Samson breached by disregarding the offset provisions. In the trial court, Samson moved\nfor summary judgment on this claim on several grounds, including limitations, which the trial court granted. The court of appeals\naffirmed because of limitations. 389 S.W.3d at 440.\n\n [20] Before analyzing the issue of limitations, we first consider Samson's argument that Hooks waived his claims for breach of\nthe offset provisions by filing a proposed judgment with the trial court. In Hooks' motion for judgment, he averred that he moved\nfor judgment “without waiving any rights to contest or appeal prior orders of the Court.” And, the statement “APPROVED AS\nTO FORM” was above Hooks' attorney's signature on the proposed judgment. Samson asserts that these reservations did not\npreserve Hooks' right to appeal, invoking Litton Industrial Products, Inc. v. Gammage, where we “disapprove [d] a practice by\nwhich a party, by motion, induces the trial court on the one hand to render a judgment, but reserves in a brief the right for the\nmovant to attack the judgment if the court grants the motion.” 668 S.W.2d 319, 322 (Tex.1984). Importantly, Litton Industrial\nProducts applies only to arguments inconsistent with the specifics of the requested judgment. See id.\n\nIn contrast, when the argument asserted on appeal is not inconsistent with the judgment, the argument is not waived. See\nDiamond Shamrock Ref. Co. v. Hall, 168 S.W.3d 164, 170 (Tex.2005). This is because “[t]here must be a method by which\na party who desires to initiate the appellate process may move the trial court to render judgment without being bound by its\nterms.” First Nat'l Bank v. Fojtik, 775 S.W.2d 632, 633 (Tex.1989) (per curiam). Here, Hooks specifically reserved the right\nto challenge prior orders of the court, and by moving for judgment on the claims that Hooks won, Hooks did not waive his\nright to appeal on claims that he lost.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 252\n\nRegarding limitations, Samson argues, and the court of appeals held, that the four-year statute of limitations bars Hooks' claims\nfor breach of the offset provisions because the offset provisions were first breached in 2001, at least five years before Hooks\nfiled suit. 389 S.W.3d at 440; see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODEE § 16.004. Hooks responds that compensatory damages\nunder the offset provisions are owed monthly, Samson's breach is recurring, and Hooks can recover damages for royalties that\nshould have been paid during the four years preceding the filing of suit. See, e.g., Lyle v. Jane Guinn Revocable Trust, 365\nS.W.3d 341, 355 (Tex.App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied). Samson denies that the breach, if any, has been recurring.\nSpecifically, Samson argues that the offset provisions authorized *68 Samson to elect to release the offset acreage or drill an\noffset well or pay compensatory royalties. Samson contends that it is not bound by the recurring provision when it could have\nopted for a non-recurring one, and damages for breach of a non-recurring provision are barred by limitations.\n\n [21] It is true that, “if the terms of an agreement call for periodic payments during the course of the contract, a cause of action\nfor such payments may arise at the end of each period.” Intermedics, Inc. v. Grady, 683 S.W.2d 842, 845 (Tex.App.–Houston\n[1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.). 14 The question remains whether, because the contract gave Samson alternatives that were\nnot recurring, Samson may prevent Hooks from suing based on the one recurring obligation. Samson cites a Fifth Circuit case\nholding that when a party refuses to make an election under an alternative contract, the choice does not devolve to the other\nparty. See Liberty Bank v. Talman Home Mortg. Corp., 877 F.2d 400, 407 (5th Cir.1989). The Fifth Circuit held that when the\n“breaching party had the option of choosing between two alternatives at the time of breach, ‘the measure of damages is the\nloss caused by reason of the promisor failing to perform the promise with the lesser value.’ ” Id. (quoting Stewart v. Cran–\nVela Rental Co., 510 F.2d 982, 986 (5th Cir.1975)). Although Samson has not presented evidence of alternative measures of\ndamages, it presumably argues that limitations reduces the alternative damages to zero. Hooks responds by citing a decision\nfrom 1849, Hemming v. Zimmerschitte, where this Court observed that there “does not appear on the record, as presented, a\nmanifestation of willingness on the part of the obligor to discharge his obligation; and the right of election, if applicable at all,\nis lost and cannot avail the defendant.” 4 Tex. 159, 164 (1849). We have not addressed the issue since then.\n\n14     See, e.g., Barnes v. LPP Mortg., Ltd., 358 S.W.3d 301, 307 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2011, pet. denied); Lyle, 365 S.W.3d at 355; Headington\n       Oil Co., L.P. v. White, 287 S.W.3d 204, 214 (Tex.App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.); F.D. Stella Prods. Co. v. Scott, 875\n       S.W.2d 462, 465–66 (Tex.App.–Austin 1994, no writ); Dvorken v. Lone Star Indus., Inc., 740 S.W.2d 565, 567 (Tex.App.–Fort\n       Worth 1987, no writ).\n [22] We need not reach the general issue of the measure of damages for breach of an alternative contract. The Hardin County\nLeases required Samson to begin drilling an offset well or release the acreage within ninety days of production from the\ninfringing well. But Samson must pay compensatory royalties slightly later—“on or before the first day of the calendar month\nnext following the expiration of ninety (90) days after the end of said calendar month in which production [is] first marketed.”\nAssuming that Samson breached, then by waiting without performing the first two alternatives, Samson impliedly elected to\nperform the later one, the only choice remaining after the first ninety days had passed. If Samson breached the offset provisions,\nthen Samson's failure to timely elect an alternative creates an implied election of the recurring compensatory royalty payments.\nAccordingly, if Samson did indeed breach, then Hooks is entitled to damages for royalties owed within four years of filing suit.\nThis accords with the nature of damages: providing “just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained.” Stewart v.\nBasey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 486 (1952). When the law would allow compensation under a recurring alternative (i.e.,\ncompensatory royalties) but not under a non-recurring alternative, it would not be just to allow the obligor's silent, continuous\nbreach to constitute an election of the non-recurring alternative.\n\n *69 The court of appeals held for Samson on limitations and did not reach the merits of Hooks' claim for breach of the offset\nprovisions and the proper construction of the entire-acreage clause. See 389 S.W.3d at 440. Because limitations does not apply\nto the compensatory royalties that may have been owed within the four years preceding suit, we remand for the court of appeals\nto consider the merits of Hooks' claims.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Attorney's Fees Claims\n\nThe parties stipulated that if Hooks “prevail[ed] on any of [his] claims” (with exceptions not applicable here), Samson would\nreimburse Hooks for a stipulated amount of attorney's fees. Because Hooks prevailed on several claims in the trial court, the trial\ncourt granted Hooks these attorney's fees. The court of appeals, however, held that Hooks take nothing except for $52,257.22,\na stipulated amount to reimburse Hooks for ad valorem taxes that the leases required Samson to pay. Id. at 438. It also held that\nreimbursement for the ad valorem taxes did not constitute “prevail[ing] on [a] claim[ ]” as contemplated by the stipulation. Id.\nAccordingly, the court of appeals did not require Samson to pay attorney's fees. Id.\n\nWe need not decide whether the ad valorem taxes trigger Samson's obligation to pay attorney's fees under the stipulation.\nRather, under our decision today, Hooks prevails on another claim such that he is entitled to the stipulated amount of fees. 15\nWe reverse the court of appeals on this point.\n\n15     At the least, Hooks prevails on his claims under the most-favored-nations clause. Other claims, such as fraud and breach of the Hardin\n       County offset provisions, are remanded to the court of appeals for further consideration.\n\n\n\n                                                     VIII.

Each lease provides that “past due\nroyalties ... shall be subject to a Late Charge based on the amount due and calculated at the maximum rate allowed by law.”\nBecause the court of appeals reversed all of Hooks' damages except for compensation for ad valorem taxes, it reduced the\ninterest rate to 5%. Id. at 439.\n\nThe Texas Finance Code provides for a maximum post-judgment interest rate of 18% on contract claims:\n\n             A money judgment of a court of this state on a contract that provides for interest or time price differential\n             earns post-judgment interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (1) the rate specified in the contract, which\n             may be a variable rate; or (2) 18 percent a year.\n\nTEX. FIN. CODE § 304.002. But, if the contract does not specify the interest rate, then the rate is determined under section\n304.003 of the Finance Code. Under section 304.003(c), the post-judgment interest rate is “the prime rate as published by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the date of computation,” not to exceed 15% a year or fall below 5% a\nyear. Id. § 304.003(c). “On the 15th day of each month, the consumer credit commissioner shall determine the post-judgment\ninterest rate to be applied to a money judgment rendered during the succeeding calendar month.” Id. § 304.003(b). Here, the\ntrial court's final judgment was rendered in December 2008, and the judgment interest rate according to the consumer credit\ncommissioner was five percent. 16\n\n16     See OFFICE OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT COMM'R, JUDGMENT RATE SUMMARY , available at http://\n       www.occc.state.tx.us/pages/int_ rates/Judgment% 20Rate% 20Summaries/ Thru% 202014% 20Judgment% 20Rate%\n       20Summary.pdf.\nThe leases only impose “the maximum [interest] rate allowed by law” for past-due royalties. Accordingly, to the extent *70\nHooks recovers for past due royalties, he is entitled to an 18% interest rate. For other recoveries, the statutory rate of 5% applies\nbecause Hooks has not directed us to any portion of the leases providing otherwise. We affirm in part and reverse in part the\ncourt of appeals' judgment regarding post-judgment interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we reverse the court of appeals regarding limitations for fraud, the most-favored-nations clause, limitations for\nbreach of the offset provisions in the Hardin County Leases, and attorney's fees. We affirm in part and reverse in part regarding\nthe applicable post-judgment interest rate. And we affirm regarding the formation-production and “unpooling” claims. We\nremand to the court of appeals for further action consistent with this opinion.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n457 S.W.3d 52, 58 Tex. Sup. Ct.

Hooks III, et al., without waiving any rights to contest or appeal\n\nprior orders of the Court, move that the Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs against\n\nDefendant Samson Lone Star Limited Partnership, n/k/a Samson Lone Star, L.L.C. (\"Samson\"),\n\nas follows:\n\n        Plaintiffs submit herewith a proposed Final Judgment for entry by the Court, pursuant to\n\nthe verdict of the jury, certain Orders on Motions for Partial Summary Judgment, and\n\nStipulations of the parties entered of record,. and request entry of that proposed Final Judgment.\n\nBackground\n\n       On November 3, 2008, this cause proceeded to trial and was subsequently submitted to a\n\njury on November 12, 2008. On November 13, 2008, the jury's verdict was read in open court\n\nwith all of the jury questions answered. Attached to this Motion as Exhibit A and incorporated\n\nherein by reference as if fully set out is a true and correct copy of the Charge of the Court and the\n\njury verdict form with the jury's answers to the questions submitted, as follows:\n\n        >     In response to Question No. 1, the jury found by a vote of eleven (11) to one\n              that Samson committed fraud against the Hooks;\n       >      In response to Question No. 2, the jury found by a vote of eleven (11) to one\n              that Samson committed statutory fraud against the Hooks;\n       >      In response to Question No. 3, the jury found by a vote of eleven (11) to one\n              that the sum of money if paid now in cash that would fairly and reasonable\n              compensate the Hooks for their damages proximately caused by such fraud is\n              $20,081,638.07;\n\f        J;>   The jury did not answer Questions Nos. 4, 5, 6, or 7;\n        );>   In response to Question No. 8, the jury found by a vote of eleven (11) to one\n              that Samson's failure to pay royalty based on formation production resulted in\n              underpayment of royalty under the three Hooks oil and gas leases entered as\n              Exhibits 25, 26, and 27; and\n        );>   In response to Question No. 9, the jury found by a unanimous vote that the\n              Hooks, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the\n              fraud of Samson by April 2007.\n\nIn addition, before trial, the Court had entered Orders on motions for partial summary judgment\n\nwith regard to certain claims at issue in this case. The following Orders on motions for partial\n\nsummary judgment, attached to this Motion and incorporated herein by reference, adjudicated\n\nliability- but not damages - as to some of Plaintiffs' claims, as indicated:\n\n        );>   Exhibit B: Order on Plaintiffs' First Amended Motion for Partial Summary\n              Judgment (Tract 4/14 Leases), recommended by Special Master W. Frank\n              Newton on July 29, 2008, and adopted by the Court on July 30, 2008, held\n              that the royalty rate under the Hooks oil and gas leases at issue in this case\n              (admitted as Exhibits 25, 26, and 27 at trial) has been equal to 28.28896%\n              since November 2001 and\n       );>    Exhibit C: Order Granting Plaintiffs' First Amended Motion for Partial\n              Summary Judgment (Unpooling), recommended by Special Master W. Frank\n              Newton on July 29, 2008, and adopted by the Court on July 30, 2008, held\n              that Defendant Samson pay Plaintiffs royalty on production from Samson's\n              Black Stone Minerals A-1 well based on the royalty revenue interest Plaintiffs\n              are due pursuant to the Black Stone Minerals \"A\" No. 1 Gas Unit as described\n              in Samson's Designation of Gas Unit for the Black Stone Minerals \"A\" No. 1\n              Gas Unit filed of record at Volume 1259, Page 237 of the Official Public\n              Records of Hardin County, Texas.\n\nDamages related to the foregoing Orders were left to be determined at trial.\n\n       Plaintiffs and Defendant Samson thereafter entered into certain stipulations entered into\n\nthe Court's record. Accordingly, the following stipulations are attached to this Motion and\n\nincorporated herein by reference:\n\n       );>    Exhibit D: Stipulation (regarding damages) signed by counsel for the parties\n              and filed November 7, 2008; and\n       );>    Exhibit E: Stipulation Regarding Attorneys' Fees signed by counsel for the\n              parties and filed October 31, 2008.\n\n\n\n                                                 -2 -\n\fDamages\n\n        As noted above, the jury found that the damages to the Hooks proximately caused by\n\nSamson's fraud equals $20,081,638.07. In addition, in Exhibit D, the parties stipulated amounts\n\nof damages for the claims adjudicated by the Orders on partial summary judgment listed above\n\nfor production through May 2008, with various alternatives depending on (among other things)\n\nwhether Plaintiffs prevailed in their claims that Samson had underpaid royalty by not paying it\n\nbased on \"formation production\" as specified in Plaintiffs' leases. Because the jury found that\n\nSamson's failure to pay on \"formation production\" resulted in underpayment of royalty,\n\nPlaintiffs prevailed on that claim. In addition, Samson stipulated its liability for and the amount\n\nof reimbursement it owes Plaintiffs for ad valorem taxes paid through November 2007.\n\n        Therefore, the actual damages to be awarded Plaintiffs, based on the jury's verdict, the\n\nCourt's Orders identified above, and the parties' Stipulations, are as follows:\n\n                                      Damages proximately caused by fraud:            $20,081,638.07\n                      Damages for breach of Most Favored Nations Clause:              $    848,854.01\n Damages for \"Unpooling\" claim related to Black Stone Minerals A-1 well:              $    766,626.85\n                                     Damages Related to Ad Valorem Taxes:             $     52,257.22\n                                                               Total Damages:         $21,749,376.15\n\n\nThe proposed Final Judgment submitted with this Motion includes the foregoing amounts for\n\nactual damages.\n\nAttorneys' Fees\n\n       Plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorneys' fees pursuant to statute, the leases at issue, and\n\nthe parties' Stipulations. In Exhibit E, the parties stipulated as to the amounts of reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys' fees incurred in the prosecution of Plaintiffs' claims in this case for which\n\nattorneys' fees are recoverable (net of segregation of fees for claims for which attorneys' fees are\n\nnot recoverable), and that all such fees are owed Plaintiffs if they prevailed on any claim other\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fthan certain claims specified in the Stipulation. At least because Plaintiffs prevailed on various\n\nother contract claims in this case, and Samson stipulated liability for ad valorem taxes in Exhibit\n\nD, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover fees pursuant to the Stipulation Regarding Attorneys' Fees.\n\nThe proposed Final Judgment submitted herewith includes such amounts for attorneys' fees.\n\nCosts and Witness Fees\n\n        In addition, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover various other costs incurred in connection\n\nwith this case. As the successful party, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover from Samson all taxable\n\ncosts of court. TEX. R. C1v P. 131. In addition, Plaintiffs' leases provide for recovery of \"court\n\ncosts, and other costs\" incurred in collecting unpaid amounts. Trial Exhibits 25, 26, and 27,\n\nArticle XVIJC (\"Time, Method and Manner of Payment\"). Plaintiffs are also entitled to recover\n\nother costs based on the jury's finding that Samson committed statutory fraud as defined in\n\nSection 27.01 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. Pursuant to that Section, a person\n\nwho violates its provisions is liable to the person defrauded for \"reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney's fees, expert witness fees, costs for copies of depositions, and costs of court.\" TEX.\n\nBus. & COM. CODE§ 27.01 (e).\n\n       Therefore, in addition to the usual taxable costs of court, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover\n\nat least expert witness fees and costs for copies of depositions. Plaintiffs entered evidence at trial\n\nof the fees invoiced as of the time of trial for the expert witnesses Plaintiffs called to testify -\n\nNedra Foster and Charles Graham (Exhibits 553 and 554, respectively) - and those witnesses\n\nthen estimated their additional fees through trial. In addition, evidence of such witness fees can\n\nbe submitted post-verdict by affidavit. Durish v. Panan Int'!, N.V, 808 S.W.2d 175, 179-80.\n\nBefore the hearing on this Motion, Plaintiffs will submit affidavit proof with supporting detail of\n\nthe additional expert witness fees invoiced post-trial, and of the costs of copies of depositions\n\nincurred by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs anticipate those total amounts will be as follows: fees for Nedra\n\n\n                                                 -4 -\n\fFoster, $47 351.79 ($40,926.94 in Exhibit 553, plus an additional $6,424.85 in post-trial billings;\n\nfees for Charles E. Graham, $58.689.07 ($50,244.99 in Exhibit 554 plus an additional $8,444.08\n\nin post-trial billings); and $5 493.51 for costs for copies of depositions. The proposed Final\n\nJudgment submitted with this Motion includes such amounts for costs and expert witness fees.\n\nPostjudgment Interest\n\n        The judgment to be entered is based on contract, i.e., Plaintiffs' oil and gas leases with\n\nSamson. Plaintiffs' damages for both fraud and breach of contract (other than unpaid taxes) are\n\nmeasured on the basis of unpaid royalty and include Late Charges computed in accordance with\n\nthose leases.\n\n       The leases specify that all royalty payments, including (unpaid) compensatory royalties -\n\nby which the damages awarded to Plaintiffs' for Samson's fraud were measured - shall be\n\nsubject to Late Charges based on the amount due, calculated at the maximum rate allowed by\n\nlaw commencing on the day after the last day on which such monthly royalty payment could\n\nhave been timely paid and for every calendar month or fraction thereof from the due date until\n\npaid. See Trial Exhibits 25, 26, and 27, Article XVII (\"Time, Method and Manner of Payment'').\n\nTherefore, per the Texas Finance Code, the judgment is \"on a contract that provides for interest\n\nor time price differential\" and thus should earn postjudgment interest at a rate equal to the lesser\n\nof the rate specified in the leases or eighteen (18) percent per year. TEXAS FIN. CODE §304.002.\n\n       The Court has previously determined that, under this provision, Late Charges are to be\n\ncomputed each month based on the amount due, including any previously accrued Late Charges,\n\ncalculated at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. See Exhibit F to this Motion: the \"Order\n\nGranting Plaintiffs' First Amended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Accrued Unpaid\n\nRoyalties)\" recommended by Special Master W. Frank Newton on July 29, 2008, and adopted by\n\nthe Court on July 30, 2008, in the Bordages case from which this case was severed in 2007 (Joe\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fA.

It was drilled.     It was -- they were just\n\n 2   simply reporting inaccurately, and now this is correct.\n\n 3   The bottom one is the correct placement of the bottom\n\n 4   hole.\n\n 5           Q.   Did Samson eventually file a second amendment\n\n 6   to the designation of the Black Stone 1 unit?\n\n 7           A.   Yes.\n\n 8           Q.   Is that Exhibit 19?\n\n 9           A.   Yes, that's right.\n\n10                       MR. SIMPSON:     Plaintiffs offer Exhibit 19.     16:30:22\n\n11                       MR.

SIMPSON)       Now, before we get into this,\n\n15   I'm going to want to look at one other letter in a\n\n16   second; but I want to make clear that on this second\n\n17   amendment, the designation, was there a plat attached?\n\n18           A.   Yes.\n\n19           Q.   Is this it right here (indicating)?\n\n20           A.   Yes, it is.                                              16:31:09\n\n21           Q.   This was -- how does this plat compare with the\n\n22   corrected one that Samson got from the surveyors in\n\n23   November, 2001?\n\n24           A.   This is a correct plat that shows the correct\n\n25   bottom hole, and it -- it is signed and sealed by the\n\f                                                                         184\n\n 1   surveyor.\n\n 2        Q.     Okay.     You've seen the records from Samson's\n\n 3   files indicating when Samson got this designation with\n\n 4   the correct plat?\n\n 5        A.     November 21st of --\n\n 6        Q.     I'm sorry.\n\n 7        A.     -- 2000 -- I'm sorry.\n\n 8        Q.     I asked you a bad question.\n\n 9                       Have you seen from Samson's files what\n\n10   Samson -- when Samson got the second amended designation                  16:31:55\n\n11   in its -- with the new plat?\n\n12        A.

I'd just like to recap where we were at the end\n\n16   of the day yesterday.\n\n17                      MR. SIMPSON:     Would you put Exhibit 19 up,\n\n18   please.\n\n19                      THE TECHNICIAN:        (Complying)\n\n20        Q.    (BY MR. SIMPSON)        And do you remember we were         09:22:10\n\n21   looking at this Exhibit 19?          You may have it there.\n\n22        A.    Yes.\n\n23        Q.    And do you remember what Exhibit 19 was?\n\n24        A.    It's the -- a second amendment to the\n\n25   designation of the gas unit on the Black Stone Minerals\n\f                                                                      7\n\n 1   No. 1.\n\n 2           Q.     And there's a plat attached to this second\n\n 3   amended designation?\n\n 4           A.     That's correct.\n\n 5           Q.     And which plat was this?\n\n 6           A.     This is one that is signed and sealed by\n\n 7   Jeffrey Fansler out of the John Jakubik & Associates\n\n 8   survey office.           This one actually shows the correct\n\n 9   bottom hole as drilled with the 356 feet off the east\n\n10   line of the Walker Pettitt and 148 feet off of the south             09:23:01\n\n11   line.        The -- from the surface down to the bottom hole,\n\n12   the distance is 1327.47; and the bearing is south 73\n\n13   degrees 09 minutes, 14 seconds east.\n\n14           Q.     And then I think we had just taken a look -- or\n\n15   just seen Exhibit 71 at the end of the day yesterday.\n\n16   Do you recall that exhibit?\n\n17           A.     I don't remember the numbers.     So...\n\n18           Q.     It's --\n\n19           A.     Oh.   Okay, yes.\n\n20           Q.     What -- what is Exhibit 71?                           09:23:41\n\n21           A.     That's a letter from Eric Lindahl of Williams &\n\n22   Lindahl.        It's addressed to Samson Lone Star to\n\n23   attention of Glenn Lanoue, and it's dated November 21st,\n\n24   2001.        What he's telling Mr. Lanoue is that he's\n\n25   enclosing the second amendment for this designation we\n\f                                                                      49\n\n 1   the -- in apparently Mr. Lanoue's grand plan.         They\n\n 2   screwed up and told the truth at the Railroad\n\n 3   Commission, right?\n\n 4           A.   Well, I don't know about that.\n\n 5           Q.   Okay.\n\n 6           A.   Their proposed plat showed the initial unit\n\n 7   line was over here to the bayou, and they did show the\n\n 8   distance as being 1,080 feet to the bayou to the unit\n\n 9   line.\n\n10           Q.   Okay.     So, if they were really -- if they were        10:16:41\n\n11   really going to try to pull off a real good fraud, they\n\n12   would have not disclosed 1,080 feet to the Railroad\n\n13   Commission right off the bat, correct?\n\n14           A.   I think the plat speaks for itself.\n\n15           Q.   It sure does.\n\n16           A.   That was their proposal.\n\n17           Q.   It does.     Okay.\n\n18                        Now, we know that this plat and this 740\n\n19   feet from the section line there, we know that was --\n\n20   that was changed and put in at the request of Mr. Lanoue              10:17:11\n\n21   in August, correct?\n\n22           A.   That's correct.\n\n23           Q.   Excuse me.     August of 2000, six months before\n\n24   this plat was sent to Mr. Hooks, right?\n\n25           A.   That's correct.\n\f                                                                       50\n\n 1           Q.   Okay.     And, again, we don't know why he made\n\n 2   the mistake or how he made the error in his\n\n 3   calculations; but, nonetheless, that was what went\n\n 4   forward from August on through, correct, was the 740\n\n 5   feet?\n\n 6           A.   Up until October of '01.\n\n 7           Q.   All right.      Now, do you have any reason --\n\n 8   strike that.\n\n 9                        Okay.   So, six months after Mr. --\n\n10   Mr. Lanoue messes up with his scaling and has an                       10:17:49\n\n11   erroneous number there, this plat goes to Mr. Hooks; and\n\n12   Mr. Hooks is concerned about 1320 feet, right?\n\n13           A.   Among other things, I'm sure.\n\n14           Q.   So, he gets this -- and Mr. Lanoue -- you\n\n15   understand that Mr. Lanoue, according to Mr. Hooks, told\n\n16   him on the 20th, which is the day before he got this,\n\n17   that that well's about 1500 feet from your property.\n\n18                        You understand that?\n\n19           A.   Yes.\n\n20           Q.   All right.      Which is outside of 1320, correct?        10:18:17\n\n21           A.   True.\n\n22           Q.   But Mr. Hooks is concerned about 1320?\n\n23           A.   Yes.\n\n24           Q.   So, he has been told the well is going to be\n\n25   about 180 feet away from his protective zone, right?\n\f                                                                    53\n\n 1   doesn't it?\n\n 2        A.    Yes, plus or minus.\n\n 3        Q.    All right.     Two things come to mind right\n\n 4   there.    1400 feet is not 1500 feet, is it?\n\n 5        A.    Well, he says plus or minus.      So, he's been\n\n 6   given those two numbers.\n\n 7        Q.    Okay.     All right.   But the numbers are\n\n 8   obviously different, aren't they?\n\n 9        A.    Yes.\n\n10        Q.    Okay.     If I'm Mr. Hooks and I'm worried about         10:20:31\n\n11   1320 and I'm told 1500 one day and I'm told 1400 plus or\n\n12   minus the next day, we're getting closer to that 1320,\n\n13   aren't we?\n\n14        A.    That's true.\n\n15        Q.    I'm concerned.     Wouldn't you be?\n\n16        A.    I as a surveyor might be.      I don't know about\n\n17   Mr. Hooks as a landowner being given a plat.\n\n18        Q.    Okay.     So, now we're within 80 feet of this\n\n19   protective zone, aren't we, at 1400?\n\n20        A.    By perpendicular measure, yes.                           10:21:04\n\n21        Q.    Right.\n\n22                      Now, plus or minus -- 1400 feet plus or\n\n23   minus -- how much -- how much do you think -- that plus\n\n24   or minus, what do you -- when you see that, what do you\n\n25   think of that when you say plus or minus?\n\f                                                                       54\n\n 1                       A minute ago you said 1400 feet, 1500 feet.\n\n 2   So, it was a hundred feet plus or minus, within the\n\n 3   ballpark?\n\n 4        A.     If we -- if we look at what Mr. Lanoue did --\n\n 5   if we think about the original proposed plat, which was\n\n 6   what Mr. Lanoue had, 330 feet off of the east line, this\n\n 7   one shows 740.\n\n 8                       What this has done, it means that it's\n\n 9   moved it off of this very solid survey line some 410\n\n10   feet back over to the west.        If you then add 410 to that         10:21:49\n\n11   1080 that they had initially, you're at 1490.\n\n12                       I -- I don't know that that's what\n\n13   Mr. Lanoue did; but I -- as I say, I've tried to back in\n\n14   his numbers many ways to find some basis for it and...\n\n15        Q.     Okay.     That really wasn't my question.    Listen\n\n16   carefully to my question.\n\n17                       When you see 1400 feet plus or minus, what\n\n18   does the plus or minus mean to you?        How much is plus,\n\n19   how much is minus, 50 feet, 75 feet?\n\n20        A.     I don't know.                                              10:22:24\n\n21        Q.     As a surveyor you have no opinion on that?\n\n22        A.     No.\n\n23        Q.     Okay.\n\n24        A.     It -- it introduces an element of it could be a\n\n25   little more, it could be a little less.        The day before\n\f                                                                   67\n\n 1           A.   I -- I don't know.\n\n 2           Q.   All right.   So, your testimony, then, is\n\n 3   Mr. Hooks, given what we know about Mr. Hooks, should\n\n 4   have been able to -- when he received this plat,\n\n 5   concerned about 1,320 feet, he should have been able to\n\n 6   ignore whatever inconsistencies there are, not even\n\n 7   noticed them, just relied on that and gone on down the\n\n 8   road?\n\n 9           A.   I think it's entirely reasonable --\n\n10           Q.   Okay.                                                 10:50:40\n\n11           A.   -- for Mr. Hooks to receive this plat and rely\n\n12   upon it.\n\n13           Q.   That -- that is what a reasonable and prudent\n\n14   mineral interest owner would have done?\n\n15           A.   As -- as a landowner in response to his\n\n16   request, having been told it was 1500, this shows plus\n\n17   or minus 1400, certainly he should be able to rely on\n\n18   what Samson is telling him.\n\n19           Q.   All right.   So, it's 1500 and 1400.   That's\n\n20   close enough that that shouldn't raise a red flag; is              10:51:06\n\n21   that true?\n\n22           A.   They're both outside of the 1320.\n\n23           Q.   Okay.   But --\n\n24           A.   And he has every reason to rely upon Samson.\n\n25           Q.   So, a hundred feet difference like that, 1500\n\f                                                                      68\n\n 1   feet, 1400 feet, that shouldn't make any difference, the\n\n 2   inconsistency -- that's -- that's consistent in your\n\n 3   mind?\n\n 4           A.   Both of those are outside of the 1320.\n\n 5           Q.   Okay.\n\n 6           A.   So, I -- I think he should have been able to\n\n 7   rely on it.\n\n 8           Q.   Is it your testimony that 1500 and 1400 are\n\n 9   essentially the same?\n\n10           A.   Well, there's a hundred between them and then            10:51:37\n\n11   plus or minus on the 1400.\n\n12           Q.   Okay.\n\n13           A.   It is outside of the 1320.\n\n14           Q.   Okay.     Now -- and to make sure I'm perfectly\n\n15   sure I understand, too, that we're in agreement, the\n\n16   directional survey that would allow you or any other\n\n17   surveyor to locate the bottom hole location was on file\n\n18   with the Railroad Commission in July of 2000, right?\n\n19           A.   That's correct.\n\n20                        MR. CARRINGTON:   We'll pass the witness,        10:52:33\n\n21   your Honor.\n\n22                            REDIRECT EXAMINATION\n\n23   BY MR. SIMPSON:\n\n24           Q.   Ms. Foster, let me ask you about some of the\n\n25   supposed inconsistencies that Mr. Carrington's brought\n\f                                                                   92\n\n 1   you met before this deposition with Samson personnel?\n\n 2        A.   A portion of a lease.\n\n 3        Q.   Who read this?\n\n 4        A.   Rob Human.\n\n 5        Q.   Portion of which lease?\n\n 6        A.   It was one -- it might have been the Hooks'.\n\n 7        Q.   And what portion of the lease was read?\n\n 8        A.   It was referring to the different spacing\n\n 9   units, I believe.      I'm trying to recall.   It's missing\n\n10   me right now, but I'm sure it will come to me.                     11:22:48\n\n11        Q.   Did it relate to pooling?\n\n12        A.   Yes, and protecting their -- it's coming to me.\n\n13   Maybe it's the water.      I don't know.\n\n14        Q.   Go ahead.\n\n15        A.   In regard to pro -- protecting their\n\n16   correlative rights.\n\n17        Q.   Did it relate to something called offset\n\n18   obligations?\n\n19        A.   Yes.\n\n20        Q.   Do you have any idea why Mr. Human read you              11:23:22\n\n21   that paragraph -- or that section?\n\n22        A.   I guess he felt it was necessary.\n\n23        Q.   Well, did you have -- then discuss that offset\n\n24   obligations section?\n\n25        A.   Yes.\n\f                                                                     93\n\n 1         Q.    What was -- what did you discuss about it?\n\n 2         A.    He had asked if it was ever a topic of\n\n 3   conversation when we were forming the units and whenever\n\n 4   I'd sent a plat to the Hooks.\n\n 5         Q.    And what was your answer?\n\n 6         A.    No.   The plat I'd sent to the Hooks wasn't\n\n 7   intended to be a plat showing where the -- how far away\n\n 8   the well was located.       It was purely an informational\n\n 9   plat to show where their tract was to be located within\n\n10   the unit.                                                            11:24:29\n\n11         Q.    But the plat did show the well location, didn't\n\n12   it?\n\n13         A.    Yes, sir.\n\n14         Q.    And --\n\n15         A.    It showed a well location.\n\n16         Q.    For the Black Stone Minerals No. 1?\n\n17         A.    I believe that's right.     I didn't read -- look\n\n18   at the plat.\n\n19         Q.    Is Samson compensating you in any way for being\n\n20   here today?                                                          11:24:54\n\n21         A.    No, sir.    It would be nice, but it's not\n\n22   happening.\n\n23         Q.    Has -- has anyone at Samson or on Samson's\n\n24   behalf talked to you about attending trial in this case?\n\n25         A.    No, sir.\n\f                                                                110\n\n 1   in some small handwriting it says 740 feet from the east\n\n 2   line and 290 feet from the south line?\n\n 3        A.   Yes, sir.\n\n 4        Q.   All right.   Do you recall where you got those\n\n 5   locations, information that you gave Mr. Fansler?\n\n 6        A.   Where I got them?\n\n 7        Q.   Yes, sir.\n\n 8        A.   I got them from myself.\n\n 9        Q.   I'm sorry?\n\n10        A.   I got them from myself.                                13:40:55\n\n11        Q.   Well, then, there had been a plat for the unit\n\n12   prepared back at least in March of 2000, hadn't there?\n\n13        A.   Well, probably.\n\n14        Q.   Well, take a look at an exhibit we've already\n\n15   seen, right?   Exhibit 44?\n\n16        A.   Well, evidently that one wasn't going to work.\n\n17        Q.   Why do you say that?\n\n18        A.   I don't know.     Because I'm doing a new one.\n\n19        Q.   So, the numbers you gave Mr. Fansler, 740 from\n\n20   the east line and 290 from the south line, they were             13:41:27\n\n21   measurements from a map?\n\n22        A.   Yes, sir.\n\n23        Q.   In your view were they supposed to be accurate?\n\n24        A.   As accurate as a land guy is using a ruler on a\n\n25   scaled piece of paper that might not even be to scale,\n\f                                                                   111\n\n 1   sure.\n\n 2           Q.   So, did you think that should be the actual\n\n 3   location of the bottom hole?\n\n 4           A.   I was probably assuming that or hoping that.\n\n 5           Q.   In fact, that's what you told the -- y'all told\n\n 6   the surveyor?\n\n 7           A.   Yes.\n\n 8           Q.   And, now, in Exhibit 52 Mr. Fansler has done as\n\n 9   instructed and just indicated the bottom hole location,\n\n10   right?                                                              13:42:15\n\n11           A.   Yes, sir.\n\n12           Q.   And, again, 740 feet from the east line and 290\n\n13   feet from the south line?\n\n14           A.   Yes, sir.\n\n15           Q.   And a total distance from the surface of the\n\n16   bottom hole of a little under 920 feet?\n\n17           A.   Yes, sir.\n\n18           Q.   Do you note -- see the note there on Exhibit 52\n\n19   says --      it's been added -- position of the bottom hole\n\n20   location was provided by Samson Lone Star, LP, right?\n\n21           A.   Yes, sir.\n\n22           Q.   And that was accurate, an accurate statement?\n\n23           A.   Well, it appears to be that way, yes, sir.\n\n24           Q.   So, the bottom hole location was not Mr.\n\n25   Fansler's but what Samson had told him it was?\n\f                                                                      122\n\n 1   some of the lessors?\n\n 2           A.   Yes, sir.\n\n 3           Q.   Mr. Lanoue?\n\n 4           A.   Yes, sir.\n\n 5           Q.   Is Exhibit 63 a copy of a letter you sent some\n\n 6   of the lessors in that Jefferson County Tract 4?\n\n 7           A.   It appears to be.\n\n 8           Q.   And you sent this letter on February 15th,\n\n 9   2001?\n\n10           A.   Yes, sir.                                                 13:55:47\n\n11           Q.   And is this -- you sent the same letter or a\n\n12   similar letter to a number of lessors?\n\n13           A.   Yes, sir, all the ones that required it.\n\n14           Q.   And you asked them in the letter to amend their\n\n15   lease to allow Samson to pool their lease with other\n\n16   tracts and to grant 640-acre pooling plus a 10 percent\n\n17   tolerance for the Black Stone Minerals No. 1 well,\n\n18   right?\n\n19           A.   Yes, sir.\n\n20           Q.   And in your understanding that's 640 plus 10              13:56:19\n\n21   percent, allows you to have a 704 acre unit?\n\n22           A.   Yes, sir.\n\n23           Q.   And then you noted that -- in the second\n\n24   sentence of Exhibit 63 or the second paragraph:         Please\n\n25   be advised that Jimmy Broussard has already given\n\f                                                                  123\n\n 1   approval for the 640-acre pooling plus a 10 percent\n\n 2   tolerance, and we would like to have your approval as\n\n 3   well.\n\n 4                     Did I read that right?\n\n 5           A.   Where -- I'm -- yes -- yes, sir.\n\n 6           Q.   So, you had talked to Mr. Broussard of the\n\n 7   Broussard lessors?\n\n 8           A.   Jimmy Broussard was the -- there's -- there's a\n\n 9   lot of owners that are in that family, and he was the\n\n10   spokesman for them.                                                13:57:01\n\n11           Q.   So, your position -- did you understand that\n\n12   Mr. Broussard was speaking for the Heisigs in\n\n13   California?\n\n14           A.   I just knew he was speaking for some of them.\n\n15   I'm not absolutely sure of the exact list today.      I knew\n\n16   it was quite a long list whenever I visited with them\n\n17   and I was surprised but I knew he represented a number\n\n18   of people.\n\n19           Q.   And there were other lessors that he did not\n\n20   represent in that who were -- also had interest in that            13:57:39\n\n21   tract, right?\n\n22           A.   I'm sure there would be because they didn't\n\n23   have a hundred percent of that tract.\n\n24           Q.   The Broussards did not have a hundred percent\n\n25   of the Jefferson County Tract 4, right?\n\f                                                                  124\n\n 1        A.    No, sir.\n\n 2        Q.    So, you had to -- your understanding was that\n\n 3   you had to get consent to pool from the other lessors\n\n 4   that he did not represent?\n\n 5        A.    Yes.\n\n 6        Q.    Were the Hooks' interests one of those lessors\n\n 7   you had to go contact?\n\n 8        A.    They were one of the owners, yes.\n\n 9        Q.    Have you ever met Mr. Hooks?\n\n10        A.    No, sir.                                                13:58:13\n\n11        Q.    Okay.\n\n12        A.    I just talked to him on the phone; Charles,\n\n13   that is.\n\n14        Q.    And you sent Mr. Hooks a letter similar to the\n\n15   one you sent the -- to the Heisigs and the Carlisis in\n\n16   Exhibit 63?\n\n17        A.    Yes, sir, I sure did.\n\n18        Q.    And, then, did you then send Mr. Hooks some\n\n19   additional information about the Black Stone Minerals\n\n20   well and unit?                                                     13:58:44\n\n21        A.    He had called and was not sure -- was not sure\n\n22   where their land was laying.       He wanted to know where\n\n23   their tract was going to be located within the unit and\n\n24   requested a plat.       So, I sent him one.   I faxed him one.\n\n25                      And then, again, I talked to him in May\n\f                                                                   165\n\n 1   sorts of things associated with that, you know, oil and\n\n 2   gas business.\n\n 3        Q.   Okay.     Now, we've heard -- and you've sat here\n\n 4   through the testimony here for a couple of days -- about\n\n 5   the pooling of your tract in 2001 and the faulty\n\n 6   information that was given to you at that time.\n\n 7                     I want to move past that time for just a\n\n 8   minute, and I want to move up until the time you met my\n\n 9   partner Paul Simpson in 2006.      At that point in time did\n\n10   you have any reason to suspect that you'd been supplied             15:07:34\n\n11   false information in order to get you to join that unit?\n\n12        A.   No, I didn't.\n\n13        Q.   How did you run into Paul?\n\n14        A.   I'm a member of the Oil Gas and Mineral Law\n\n15   Section of the Houston Bar Association and every month\n\n16   they have a monthly luncheon meeting at the Houston Club\n\n17   and -- with a speaker and, so, I normally attend those\n\n18   and I -- this one particular month, day, I attended the\n\n19   meeting and that's when I -- that's when I met him.\n\n20        Q.   Okay.     And you had lunch with him there and            15:08:14\n\n21   listening to the exciting speech, I'm sure, that was\n\n22   given about oil and gas law?\n\n23        A.   Yes, we had lunch.     I don't know how exciting\n\n24   it was.   I think it was on ethics, as I recall, but...\n\n25        Q.   Okay.     The -- I remember Mr. Burmeister saying\n\f                                                                     166\n\n 1   that you had celebrated your 60th birthday going to a\n\n 2   legal seminar.\n\n 3           A.     That was just coincidental, but that's true\n\n 4   actually.\n\n 5           Q.     Now, at that point -- in that conversation did\n\n 6   you -- when you just met him casually did you suddenly\n\n 7   discover that you'd been defrauded?\n\n 8           A.     No, that's -- no, not at all.\n\n 9           Q.     How did the conversation go that you became\n\n10   interested in looking into seeing whether or not Samson               15:09:08\n\n11   had done something wrong to your family?\n\n12           A.     Well, when I sat down next to Paul at this\n\n13   table, he was sitting there by himself initially and I\n\n14   went over to join him and I thought I'd be friendly,\n\n15   it'd be a nice thing to sit down next to him.        So, I did\n\n16   that.        We introduced each other and he recognized my\n\n17   name from some litigation that he had been involved in\n\n18   already and started asking me some questions and said,\n\n19   \"Yes, I'm that Charles Hooks,\" et cetera, and, so, we\n\n20   got into a little bit of discussion about some of the                 15:09:44\n\n21   things that are involved here.\n\n22           Q.     And I don't want to get into all that, but did\n\n23   you eventually go down to his office and see some of the\n\n24   materials that he had accumulated in this existing\n\n25   lawsuit against Samson for some other people?\n\f                                                                    167\n\n 1          A.   Yes, yes, I did.\n\n 2          Q.   Okay.     And, again, at that point in time was\n\n 3   the nature of the claim failure to pay royalties,\n\n 4   something like that?\n\n 5          A.   Things of that nature, right.\n\n 6          Q.   It wasn't -- you hadn't discovered the fraud\n\n 7   yet?\n\n 8          A.   No, that wasn't involved at that time.\n\n 9          Q.   Well, at what point in time just generally did\n\n10   you-all, through the discovery process, uncover what had             15:10:23\n\n11   happened to you?\n\n12          A.   Oh, I think it was in the spring, the following\n\n13   spring that information came out.\n\n14          Q.   And it was at that point in time that you\n\n15   actually amended your lawsuit that -- you were already\n\n16   part of another lawsuit against Samson.        You amended\n\n17   that and brought the fraud allegation as part of this\n\n18   case here today?\n\n19          A.   Yes, once we became aware of the situation.\n\n20          Q.   Now, now I want to rewind back -- okay? -- to            15:10:52\n\n21   how you got into any kind of business arrangement with\n\n22   Samson.\n\n23                       Let me show you Exhibit 501 (tendering).\n\n24   Can you identify Exhibit 501?\n\n25          A.   This -- yes, I can identify it.\n\f                                                                       175\n\n 1   beginning of all that, it says that that's to be done\n\n 2   within 90 days from the date production is first sold.\n\n 3        A.   Right.\n\n 4        Q.   Okay.     Now, you've seen leases -- provisions\n\n 5   like this in other leases, I assume?\n\n 6        A.   I've seen variations of that, yes.\n\n 7        Q.   Okay.     Now, this was in '99 when you entered\n\n 8   into this lease.      Do you recall getting a letter from a\n\n 9   Mr. Glenn Lanoue in February of 2001?\n\n10        A.   Yes.     Yes, I did.                                          15:22:24\n\n11        Q.   Okay.\n\n12                     MR. LOCHRIDGE:     Can we throw Exhibit 65 up\n\n13   on the screen, please.\n\n14                     THE TECHNICIAN:     (Complying).\n\n15        Q.   (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)        Okay.   And is this similar\n\n16   to the letter that he sent to you?          And I say \"similar,\"\n\n17   because you've added some things here, right?\n\n18        A.   Yes.     That's my -- my annotated version of the\n\n19   letter, right.\n\n20        Q.   So, this actually is the letter as you sent it                15:22:49\n\n21   back to him a couple of days later, correct?\n\n22        A.   Yes.\n\n23        Q.   Okay.     So, let's -- let's go to Exhibit 63,\n\n24   which just shows the letter as it was sent to most of\n\n25   the other royalty owners.        And it just is basically\n\f                                                                       176\n\n 1   saying --\n\n 2                       MR. CARRINGTON:     Judge, can we get\n\n 3   Mr. Lochridge to quit leading the witness?            He's just\n\n 4   testifying for Mr. Hooks.\n\n 5                       MR. LOCHRIDGE:     I realize I'm leading, your\n\n 6   Honor; but we've heard a lot of this.           I'm trying to\n\n 7   move quicker.\n\n 8                       MR. CARRINGTON:     Well, then, if we've heard\n\n 9   it, we don't need to repeat it.\n\n10                       THE COURT:   All right.    Try not to lead.         15:23:27\n\n11                       MR. LOCHRIDGE:     All right.   Yes, sir.\n\n12        Q.     (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)        Did you get a letter with\n\n13   the similar language from Mr. Lanoue?\n\n14        A.     Yes.\n\n15        Q.     In February, 2001?\n\n16        A.     Yes, I did.\n\n17        Q.     Now, in that letter they were -- he was\n\n18   requesting you to give permission to agree to a unit,\n\n19   right?\n\n20        A.     Yes, to pool at least a portion of the 640-acre             15:23:54\n\n21   tract.\n\n22        Q.     Okay.     And what did you do when you got this\n\n23   request from the people at Samson?\n\n24        A.     I called Mr. Lanoue on the telephone.\n\n25        Q.     You just took the -- got the number here from\n\f                                                                    177\n\n 1   the letter?\n\n 2        A.   Yeah.\n\n 3        Q.   You just gave him a call; is that right?\n\n 4        A.   Yes.     I had some questions for him.\n\n 5        Q.   While you were -- when you were making this\n\n 6   telephone call, did it so happen that you took some\n\n 7   notes of the telephone conversation while you were\n\n 8   talking to him or just after?\n\n 9        A.   Yes, I did.\n\n10        Q.   And is Plaintiff's Exhibit 160 the notes that              15:24:31\n\n11   you took at the time of the telephone conversation\n\n12   (tendering)?\n\n13        A.   Yes, those are my notes.\n\n14                     MR. LOCHRIDGE:     Your Honor, we offer\n\n15   Plaintiff's Exhibit 160.\n\n16                     MR. CARRINGTON:     No objection.\n\n17                     THE COURT:   Admitted.\n\n18                     (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 160 received)\n\n19        Q.   (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)        Now, let's -- let's just\n\n20   make sure we're reading your handwriting here.         We've         15:25:01\n\n21   got the date of 2-20-01, correct?\n\n22        A.   Yes.\n\n23        Q.   All right.     And you've got your first note.\n\n24   Would you just read that out loud to the jury to make\n\n25   sure that there's no mistake about what you've written.\n\f                                                                    178\n\n 1           A.   (Reading) 13,700-foot deep gas well with good\n\n 2   deal of condensate located about 1500 feet west of\n\n 3   Pine Island Bayou on Black Stone lease.       Well drilled by\n\n 4   Samson.      Want to include 50 acres out of our 640 acres\n\n 5   in 704-acre gas unit.       Haven't decided about remaining\n\n 6   590 acres.\n\n 7           Q.   Now, what you've written here, is this what\n\n 8   you're telling him or what he's telling you?\n\n 9           A.   That's what he was telling me.\n\n10           Q.   All right.   And generally what were you asking         15:25:50\n\n11   him about?\n\n12           A.   I was asking him about the location of our\n\n13   property in relation to the rest of the unit; and, also,\n\n14   I was concerned about the location of the well because I\n\n15   knew about the offset obligation that could be involved\n\n16   here.\n\n17           Q.   Okay.   And in response to your inquiry he\n\n18   indicated that it was located about 1500 feet west of\n\n19   Pine Island Bayou?\n\n20           A.   Yes.                                                    15:26:23\n\n21           Q.   And what did you understand that to mean?\n\n22           A.   I understood that to mean that the well was\n\n23   located or completed outside of that 1320-foot zone that\n\n24   we've talked about.\n\n25           Q.   Is that what you were trying to find out?\n\f                                                                    181\n\n 1   been admitted.\n\n 2                    THE TECHNICIAN:     (Complying).\n\n 3          Q.   (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)     Is this the -- the fax he\n\n 4   sent to you that -- I think the same day or the next\n\n 5   day?\n\n 6          A.   It looks like it's the next day, and it looks\n\n 7   like the transmittal sheet.\n\n 8          Q.   All right.\n\n 9                    MR. LOCHRIDGE:     And let's flip to the -- I\n\n10   believe it's the last page of this exhibit.                          15:29:36\n\n11                    THE TECHNICIAN:     (Complying).\n\n12          Q.   (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)     The jury's seen this\n\n13   before.\n\n14                    First of all, is that the plat he sent to\n\n15   you, the last page of this Exhibit 64?\n\n16          A.   Yes, as far as I can tell.\n\n17          Q.   And what did you do to verify that the -- what\n\n18   he told you was true about the well being located 1500\n\n19   feet away from Pine Bayou -- Pine Bayou?\n\n20          A.   Well, I looked at the -- what was indicated on           15:30:06\n\n21   the plat; and it shows me that it was approximately --\n\n22   the bottom hole location was approximately 1400 feet\n\n23   west of Pine Island Bayou.\n\n24          Q.   Now, that's a little bit different than the\n\n25   1500 feet that he told you over the telephone, right?\n\f                                                                  182\n\n 1        A.   A little bit.     I assumed that he was talking in\n\n 2   generalities in that case and that once he got the plat\n\n 3   it was more specific on the plat.\n\n 4        Q.   Well, did that spark any concern that he might\n\n 5   be lying to you if he told you 1500 on the telephone and\n\n 6   then gave you a plat that was 1400?\n\n 7        A.   No.     I -- the plat speaks for itself.\n\n 8        Q.   Okay.\n\n 9        A.   And I had no reason to be concerned that it\n\n10   wasn't accurate.                                                   15:31:02\n\n11        Q.   Well, did you go and hire a surveyor or anyone\n\n12   to check it out?\n\n13        A.   No.     I didn't see any reason to do that.   It\n\n14   seems -- I mean, I assumed that he was going to send me\n\n15   accurate information; and that's what I got.\n\n16        Q.   Now, earlier there was some argument made about\n\n17   this arrow going -- the leader, I think they call it,\n\n18   from this box that says B.H.L. going over in the\n\n19   direction.\n\n20                     From looking at this plat where did you          15:31:43\n\n21   believe the bottom hole to be?\n\n22        A.   Well, it looks like the bottom hole is there at\n\n23   that sort of black dot area where the -- right about --\n\n24        Q.   (Indicating)?\n\n25        A.   -- right there about where the red is, right.\n\f                                                                   183\n\n 1   That would be about where it would be, that\n\n 2   intersection.\n\n 3        Q.    Now, I want to -- well, first of all, after you\n\n 4   got this plat and checked it out and confirmed what\n\n 5   Mr. Lanoue had told you over the telephone, what did you\n\n 6   then do?    Did you agree to -- to accept the pooling?\n\n 7        A.    Well, once I had satisfied myself that\n\n 8   everything was in order, was appropriate, then I decided\n\n 9   I would send back the letter that he had requested me to\n\n10   sign agreeing to this but with some changes on it.                  15:32:49\n\n11        Q.    Okay.   Let's turn back to Exhibit 65.   Now, is\n\n12   that the -- did you just take his letter dated February\n\n13   15th and edit it with your changes?\n\n14        A.    Yes, that's what I did.\n\n15        Q.    And does your change begin here: ...as per a\n\n16   photocopy of a plat?\n\n17        A.    Yes, the -- after the comma.\n\n18        Q.    Okay.   And you just typed that in yourself?\n\n19        A.    I personally typed that on there.\n\n20        Q.    And, then, is that yours and your wife's                 15:33:26\n\n21   initials to the left?\n\n22        A.    Yes, they are.\n\n23        Q.    Now, why did you want to tie them down to the\n\n24   plat that he had sent to you?\n\n25        A.    Well, that's the basis on which I made the\n\f                                                                      184\n\n 1   decision that everything was okay; and I wanted to be\n\n 2   sure there was no confusion later as to what was what.\n\n 3   I mean, that's the basis on which it was all done.\n\n 4           Q.   Let's turn to the third page of this.    The\n\n 5   jury's seen this plat.\n\n 6                       Now, is this the same plat that he sent to\n\n 7   you, only now it has your and your wife's signatures?\n\n 8           A.   Yes.    Right.   We initialed it.\n\n 9           Q.   Or I'm sorry.     Initialed it.\n\n10                       And what was the purpose of initialling the        15:34:16\n\n11   plat?\n\n12           A.   To be sure that that was, in fact, the plat and\n\n13   that if it ever came up later, that this was the plat we\n\n14   were using to establish this information.\n\n15           Q.   And what are the two things that were of\n\n16   importance to you on this plat?\n\n17           A.   Well, first and foremost, the location of the\n\n18   well and then, of course, how our 50 acres would fit\n\n19   into this proposed unit that they were -- would do.\n\n20           Q.   And the plat shows both the area here is your             15:34:50\n\n21   50 acres?\n\n22           A.   Yes.    I think it's Tract 4, that they have it\n\n23   designated as Tract 4.\n\n24           Q.   And, then, the 1400 plus or minus scale line?\n\n25           A.   The 1400 feet, yes.\n\f                                                                   203\n\n 1   Mr. Carrington).\n\n 2        Q.   (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)     Is Exhibit 5 -- what is\n\n 3   Exhibit 552?\n\n 4        A.   Exhibit 552 appears to be a copy of all of the\n\n 5   various royalty checks we've received from Samson over a\n\n 6   period of time.\n\n 7        Q.   Okay.     And does Samson send -- how does Samson\n\n 8   send the checks, a different check for each well; or how\n\n 9   do they do this?\n\n10        A.   No.     They send one check each month which              16:24:27\n\n11   covers all of the royalty from each of the -- the wells\n\n12   or units --\n\n13        Q.   Okay.\n\n14        A.   -- involved.\n\n15        Q.   And then you re -- what, do you generally just\n\n16   routinely put those in the bank, you or Norma?\n\n17        A.   Well, yes, we deposit those each time.\n\n18        Q.   Okay.     Now, you've heard the counsel for Samson\n\n19   talk about you just accepting this money all along\n\n20   and -- despite the fact that you feel like you were not             16:24:54\n\n21   shot straight with regard to this unit.      You've heard\n\n22   that argument, right?\n\n23        A.   Yes, I have.\n\n24        Q.   Well, when you've cashed these checks, has it\n\n25   been your intent to ratify or acquiesce in any way with\n\f                                                                    204\n\n 1   what they have done here with regard to this unit?\n\n 2        A.   Not at all.\n\n 3        Q.   Well, why have you cashed the checks, then?\n\n 4        A.   I've cashed the checks because I see that as\n\n 5   just being a part of what they actually owe me.        I saw\n\n 6   no reason not to go ahead and accept them.\n\n 7        Q.   Now, you have not calculated yourself what you\n\n 8   think you're owed, have you?\n\n 9        A.   No.\n\n10        Q.   Again, is that -- have you left that up to                 16:25:44\n\n11   Mr. Graham?\n\n12        A.   Yes.    That's his job.\n\n13        Q.   Now, do you know if Mr. Graham has been\n\n14   instructed one way or the other about giving Samson\n\n15   credit for the -- the funds that they have paid you?\n\n16        A.   Well, yes.    If -- whatever that may be that I'm\n\n17   owed -- I mean, anything I've already received, I would\n\n18   certainly give him credit for that.\n\n19                    MR. LOCHRIDGE:     Your Honor, we offer\n\n20   Plaintiff's 552.                                                     16:26:21\n\n21                    MR. CARRINGTON:     No objection.\n\n22                    THE COURT:   Admitted.\n\n23                    (Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 552 received)\n\n24                    MR. LOCHRIDGE:     Could you put Exhibit 71 up\n\n25   on the board, please.\n\f                                                                            9\n\n 1   oil and gas law.\n\n 2        A.       I wouldn't classify myself as an expert.    I'd say I\n\n 3   was somewhat knowledgeable but not an expert.\n\n 4        Q.       Well, you -- you've described yourself as having\n\n 5   expertise in oil and gas law and real estate law on previous\n\n 6   occasions, have you not?\n\n 7        A.       Yes, in that I had -- that's the areas I do most of\n\n 8   my work in.\n\n 9        Q.       Right.    Most of your knowledge is in real estate law\n\n10   and oil and gas law.\n\n11        A.       Yes, that's fair to say.\n\n12        Q.       And you're active, as you mentioned yesterday, in\n\n13   the oil and gas section of the Houston Bar Association?\n\n14        A.       I'm a member, and I attend the meetings.    I'm not\n\n15   otherwise active as such.\n\n16        Q.       You keep up with -- try to keep up with current\n\n17   events and keep your legal education in that field updated,\n\n18   correct?\n\n19        A.       I do.    I do that, yes.\n\n20        Q.       You're certainly not a novice in this area?\n\n21        A.       No, I wouldn't say I'm a novice, no.\n\n22        Q.       And you've been involved in this for 30-some-odd\n\n23   years, right, ever since you got out of school?\n\n24        A.       Yes, a little over 33 years now.\n\n25        Q.       And since you got out of school -- and I'm not --\n\n\n\n                            ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                         10\n\n 1   I'm not demeaning what you do 'cause I wish I could do the same\n\n 2   thing; but this is all you've done, is manage your family's\n\n 3   investments since you got out of law school, right?\n\n 4        A.    That's been my primary job, yes, although it's --\n\n 5   it's pretty challenging and certainly very time-consuming, yes.\n\n 6        Q.    But you've never had a job where you worked for\n\n 7   someone else or anything like that, right?\n\n 8        A.    Well, I have.\n\n 9        Q.    Since you got out of law school.\n\n10        A.    Since law school?\n\n11        Q.    Right.\n\n12        A.    No, not since I've been involved in this.\n\n13        Q.    I understand back in high school and so forth,\n\n14   between there and the Navy, that you had a job.\n\n15                     All right.   So, for the last 30-plus years you\n\n16   have been involved in negotiating oil and gas leases?\n\n17        A.    Yes.\n\n18        Q.    Talking to landmen?\n\n19        A.    Yes.\n\n20        Q.    Dealing with landmen, correct?\n\n21        A.    Right, right.\n\n22        Q.    And that's who you normally deal with when you're\n\n23   negotiating leases, isn't it?\n\n24        A.    Yes, usually.\n\n25        Q.    All right.    And you've been involved in numerous gas\n\n\n\n                         ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                                11\n\n 1   units, I assume, over the years?\n\n 2           A.   Yes, we've had properties and various gas units.\n\n 3           Q.   How many states did you say you had properties in,\n\n 4   30-some-odd?\n\n 5           A.   No.     We have -- our property's basically in Texas\n\n 6   and Louisiana.\n\n 7           Q.   I'm sorry.     Maybe I misstated.    I said \"states.\"     I\n\n 8   meant counties.       How many counties?\n\n 9           A.   There are 36 counties that we have some interests in\n\n10   of some description or another.\n\n11           Q.   How many leases do you think you negotiate a year?\n\n12           A.   Well, that varies.     It's hard to say.    In a year's\n\n13   time -- I don't know -- maybe a half a dozen --\n\n14           Q.   Okay.\n\n15           A.   -- over the course of a year.\n\n16           Q.   And I think you told us in your deposition you've\n\n17   negotiated over a hundred oil and gas leases in your -- in your\n\n18   life.\n\n19           A.   I don't recall saying that but I -- over 33 years,\n\n20   that's probably true.\n\n21           Q.   Well, you said it would be purely a guess; but you\n\n22   said it would be right around a hundred -- over or a hundred,\n\n23   you said.\n\n24           A.   Well, that's probably right, yeah.\n\n25           Q.   All right.     The point is you have a lot of\n\n\n\n                           ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                             25\n\n 1           Q.       Yes, sir.\n\n 2           A.       Yes.\n\n 3           Q.       All right.    Now, your position is you told\n\n 4   Mr. Lanoue that you wanted to get a plat to see where this --\n\n 5   where this well was going to be?\n\n 6           A.       To see the location of the well and the property and\n\n 7   that sort of thing.\n\n 8           Q.       Did you mention to Mr. Lanoue anything about offset\n\n 9   obligations in that phone call?\n\n10           A.       I don't know if we specifically talked about offset\n\n11   obligations.        We talked about the location of the well; and I\n\n12   believe that was clear, that that was a potential issue.\n\n13           Q.       Well, you did not tell Mr. Lanoue that you were\n\n14   concerned about whether the well was going to be within 1,320\n\n15   feet.        You never said that specifically, did you?\n\n16           A.       I may not have.    I was concerned with the location\n\n17   of the well; and once I could determine that, then I'd see if\n\n18   there was a concern.\n\n19           Q.       All right.    You asked him for a plat?\n\n20           A.       Yes.\n\n21           Q.       And he sent you one by fax the next day?\n\n22           A.       Yes.\n\n23           Q.       And we've all seen the plat; and we're going to look\n\n24   at it again here in a minute, as well.\n\n25                           You wanted that plat for -- am I hearing you\n\n\n\n                              ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                             26\n\n 1   say two reasons?        No. 1, just to see what the unit was going to\n\n 2   look like and, then, No. 2, to see where itself well was going\n\n 3   to be in proximity to your tract?\n\n 4        A.       Yes.     Those were the two things I was basically\n\n 5   interested in.\n\n 6        Q.       Okay.     You know Jimmy Broussard, don't you?\n\n 7        A.       I've talked with Jimmy on the phone a few times.\n\n 8   I've never met him personally face to face.\n\n 9        Q.       You guys are cotenants, joint tenants, whatever, on\n\n10   a number of pieces of property or mineral interests; is that --\n\n11   is that correct?\n\n12        A.       Yes.     Our families have interests in various\n\n13   properties.\n\n14        Q.       Right.     I think you said in your deposition there\n\n15   was some relationship back up the food chain with your\n\n16   grandfather and one of the Broussards.         They did business\n\n17   together, something like that, right?\n\n18        A.       Right.     They all knew each other.\n\n19        Q.       And that's how you and the Broussards have come to\n\n20   own property together?\n\n21        A.       As I understand it, yes.\n\n22        Q.       And you understand that Jimmy Broussard is -- is, I\n\n23   guess, kind of like you.        He's the person that runs the\n\n24   Broussard oil and gas interests and things of that nature.\n\n25        A.       That's my impression.\n\n\n\n                            ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                           32\n\n 1   doesn't go to that intersection.\n\n 2        A.     Well, frankly I'm not so sure that you can't -- that\n\n 3   it doesn't go to that intersection because the way those lines\n\n 4   were drawn and what I had to look at, it looked very much like\n\n 5   it could have.\n\n 6        Q.     Mr. Hooks, look at this.     This arrow for the surface\n\n 7   location goes to right there (indicating).      Okay?   You with me\n\n 8   there?\n\n 9        A.     Uh-huh, yes.\n\n10        Q.     This box for the bottom hole location, the arrow\n\n11   goes right here (indicating), right underneath that \"4\".       You\n\n12   see that?\n\n13        A.     Well, now I can see that.\n\n14        Q.     All right.     How did you know where the bottom hole\n\n15   was when you got this?\n\n16        A.     I knew it was approximately in that location based\n\n17   on that information and --\n\n18        Q.     Well, Mr. Hooks \"approximately\" doesn't cut it when\n\n19   you're talking 180 feet.      If that bottom hole location's right\n\n20   there (indicating), you've got a problem.      If it's over here\n\n21   (indicating), you don't have a problem.\n\n22                    Didn't you want to know exactly where it was if\n\n23   you were really concerned about 1320?\n\n24        A.     Well, as far as I could tell on what he had faxed\n\n25   me, that was -- that area was where the -- was the bottom hole\n\n\n\n                       ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                            33\n\n 1   location; and that 1400 feet was the distance to it.\n\n 2        Q.      But this is what he faxed you, Mr. Hooks; and from\n\n 3   looking at this, you can't tell where the bottom hole is.\n\n 4                     But, yet, you didn't call him, did you, and ask\n\n 5   him for some clarification?\n\n 6        A.      Well, I didn't think I needed any clarification.     It\n\n 7   seemed clear to me that it was -- it was 1400 feet away from\n\n 8   the bayou.\n\n 9        Q.      Well, there's a line over here that's 1400 feet\n\n10   away; but you can't tell where the well is, Mr. Hooks.     That's\n\n11   what's important, isn't it?\n\n12        A.      To me, where that line went to and where that arrow\n\n13   appeared to go to were very close and it -- it -- I didn't\n\n14   have -- there was no confusion as far as I was concerned.\n\n15        Q.      All right.   So, your testimony is that where this\n\n16   arrow is going, which is right here (indicating) underneath\n\n17   this \"4\", and where the bottom hole location actually was, at\n\n18   least for purposes of this map, are all in the same area and it\n\n19   was okay, it was ballpark, and it was close enough for\n\n20   government work, huh?\n\n21        A.      From the fax that I got, which was not the size of\n\n22   this -- it was a small piece of paper -- it looked very much\n\n23   like that arrow was at that intersection where the bottom hole\n\n24   location supposedly is.\n\n25        Q.      All right, Mr. Hooks.   Here's one just the same size\n\n\n\n                        ANITA L.

You see the arrow going right under the\n\n 2   \"4\" just like it is on the big one?        It's even harder to see on\n\n 3   that one, isn't it, Mr. Hooks?\n\n 4        A.     Actually this is clearer to me because that line\n\n 5   appears to continue across there and there's a little circle\n\n 6   where that intersection is and that looks like that's where the\n\n 7   bottom hole location would be and that's exactly what -- the\n\n 8   way I interpret it.\n\n 9        Q.     So, you don't think that arrow goes to the bottom of\n\n10   the \"4\"?   You think it kicks over here (indicating)?\n\n11        A.     I think it's entirely -- that's the case.\n\n12        Q.     All right.    I'm going to mark this --\n\n13        A.     That's the way I interpreted it.\n\n14        Q.     Is this (indicating) the map that you received?\n\n15        A.     What's the date on it?       February 21.\n\n16                    I assume that it is, based on the dates.\n\n17        Q.     It sure looks like it, doesn't it?          And the dates\n\n18   are the same.\n\n19        A.     February 21, 2001, that would be appear to be.\n\n20        Q.     All right.    Thank you.\n\n21                    MR.

So, this has got a red\n\n10   dot that wasn't on there when you got this map?\n\n11                       THE WITNESS:     Correct.\n\n12                       MR. LOCHRIDGE:        Well, your Honor, we don't --\n\n13   we object to the red dot and any representation that that might\n\n14   be part of the map; but with that explanation we have no\n\n15   objection to this exhibit.\n\n16                       THE COURT:     The jury will disregard the red\n\n17   dot.    It's admitted.\n\n18                       MR. CARRINGTON:        Disregard the red dot.\n\n19                       (Defendant's Exhibit No. 1 received)\n\n20          Q.    (BY MR. CARRINGTON)          All right, Mr. Hooks.     So,\n\n21   anyway, you concluded that wherever in there the bottom hole\n\n22   was that it was in a satisfactory location, right?\n\n23          A.    Yes.    I -- I concluded that it was fourteen --\n\n24   approximately 1400 feet west of Pine Island Bayou.\n\n25          Q.    Now, did it give you any concern that, even by this\n\n\n\n                          ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                            36\n\n 1   map, it was a hundred feet different than what Mr. Lanoue had\n\n 2   supposedly told you the day before?\n\n 3           A.      Not really.\n\n 4           Q.      So, now that we're within 80 feet, given that he's\n\n 5   already missed it by a hundred feet, it didn't send off a -- a\n\n 6   red light in your head, thinking, \"Wow, this guy told me 1500\n\n 7   feet yesterday, which was close enough, and now he's missed it\n\n 8   by a hundred feet.        Now we're within 80 feet.     What if he's\n\n 9   missed it any more\"?\n\n10                         That didn't trigger a question like that in\n\n11   your mind?\n\n12           A.      No.   His comment was that he was approximately 1500\n\n13   feet; and when I saw a surveyor's plat that shows 1400 feet, I\n\n14   assume that's more accurate than what his -- his verbal\n\n15   estimation was.\n\n16           Q.      What about the fact that it was 1400 feet plus or\n\n17   minus?       What if 80 feet is the minus?\n\n18           A.      To me plus or minus means just a few feet, not a\n\n19   huge substantial amount.\n\n20           Q.      Well, you heard Ms. -- Ms. Foster's testimony and\n\n21   I -- and she was a little ambivalent but she seemed to think,\n\n22   ah, 1500 feet, 1400 feet, you know, it's not much difference,\n\n23   kind of like the plus or minus might go as far as a hundred\n\n24   feet.\n\n25           A.      That's not my -- that's not my assumption.\n\n\n                            ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                           37\n\n 1        Q.    So, you weren't worried about that, huh?\n\n 2        A.    It didn't bother me particularly, no.       I assumed it\n\n 3   was fairly close --\n\n 4        Q.    Okay.\n\n 5        A.    -- to 1400 feet.\n\n 6        Q.    All right.     Now, the final thing, I guess, that's\n\n 7   curious on this map -- or this plat --\n\n 8                      MR. CARRINGTON:    And if you guys would, do the\n\n 9   same thing you did last time with the twin screens and blowing\n\n10   up the bottom.\n\n11                      THE TECHNICIAN:    (Complying).\n\n12                      MR. CARRINGTON:    There you go.\n\n13        Q.    (BY MR. CARRINGTON)       Now, Mr. Hooks, on -- on this\n\n14   plat down at the bottom where it's in writing, whereas it's\n\n15   1400 feet from your lease line up here, 1400 feet from the\n\n16   bayou, down here it says the bottom hole location is 14\n\n17   heat [sic] -- 1400 feet from the east line of the unit, which\n\n18   is over there (indicating).\n\n19                      You understand that?\n\n20        A.    I understand what it says.\n\n21        Q.    Okay.\n\n22        A.    Yes.\n\n23        Q.    That would be a problem for that 1320 issue,\n\n24   wouldn't it?\n\n25        A.    Not if it's -- not if it's the east line of the unit\n\n\n\n                         ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                           38\n\n 1   before this acreage is added in.      It's clear that it's\n\n 2   1400 feet from Pine Island Bayou.\n\n 3        Q.    Did you have any other plats to look at from -- that\n\n 4   would indicate previous unit designations?\n\n 5        A.    I hadn't seen anything --\n\n 6        Q.    No.\n\n 7        A.    -- no.\n\n 8        Q.    So, when you get this (indicating), this is all\n\n 9   you're operating from, right?\n\n10        A.    Yes.\n\n11        Q.    And you've got -- aside from the ambiguities about\n\n12   where the -- where the well actually is, you've got something\n\n13   that's saying it's 1400 feet from your lease line, your\n\n14   property over here (indicating); and, then, you've got it\n\n15   written down here that it's 1400 feet from over here\n\n16   (indicating).\n\n17                      Doesn't that inconsistency give you at least\n\n18   enough pause, if you're really concerned about the 1320, to\n\n19   pick up the phone and call Mr. Lanoue and say, \"I don't\n\n20   understand this.     Why is it -- why is it different?\"\n\n21        A.    Well, I didn't have any confusion about it.       To me,\n\n22   it would indicate -- I knew our tract was not in any other unit\n\n23   and the east line of whatever unit there was couldn't have been\n\n24   any further east than Pine Island Bayou and, since the line ran\n\n25   from Pine Island Bayou west, it seemed to me that that was not\n\n\n\n                         ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                               39\n\n 1   a problem.\n\n 2           Q.       Mr. Hooks, you've got a map that says two different\n\n 3   things, one going over here (indicating), one going over there\n\n 4   (indicating).          You're concerned about 1320 and, so, you're just\n\n 5   going -- you just assume that somehow it's all right with the\n\n 6   world and that this is from some previous map that they just\n\n 7   didn't change?          Is that what you're telling us?\n\n 8           A.       I'm telling you that there was no confusion in my\n\n 9   mind.        I assumed this was a proposed unit and that the\n\n10   reference, if I even saw that down there, was from the other\n\n11   unit, not from what they were proposing, because it was\n\n12   consistent with the arrow -- with the 1400 feet.\n\n13           Q.       Well, there's no way -- just to be absolutely sure,\n\n14   Mr. -- Mr. Hooks, there is no way that 1400 feet to this line\n\n15   (indicating) and 1400 feet to this line (indicating) are\n\n16   consistent.        You'll give me that, won't you?\n\n17           A.       No.\n\n18           Q.       You think they're the same?\n\n19           A.       I didn't have any confusion about it.    It's clear to\n\n20   me.\n\n21           Q.       Crystal clear?\n\n22           A.       Yes, or I would have inquired.\n\n23           Q.       And you never did, did you?\n\n24           A.       I had no reason to.\n\n25           Q.       You were very, very concerned about the 1320,\n\n\n\n                              ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                            43\n\n 1   for you to get in on the unit?\n\n 2        A.       Well, the way it was presented to me, it was the\n\n 3   only way we'd have any economic benefit out of the situation.\n\n 4        Q.       Right.     And that's because the well was not drilled\n\n 5   on -- on your property, correct?\n\n 6        A.       Correct.\n\n 7        Q.       And you were told that if you didn't join the unit\n\n 8   that you wouldn't participate in the production, right?\n\n 9        A.       Right.\n\n10        Q.       Now, your position is that -- that that was the case\n\n11   because it was outside of 1320 and no well on your property.\n\n12   So, if I don't join the unit, I don't get anything, right?\n\n13        A.       That's -- that's correct, yes.\n\n14        Q.       In reality -- in reality, Mr. Hooks, the reason you\n\n15   would have gotten nothing is because Samson would have released\n\n16   your property, isn't it?\n\n17        A.       I don't know that.      They never talked about\n\n18   releasing it.\n\n19        Q.       Why in the world would they ever pay you\n\n20   compensatory royalties, Mr. Hooks, instead of just releasing\n\n21   your lease?\n\n22        A.       I don't know.     That would be for Samson to decide.\n\n23        Q.       Exactly.     Exactly.   They had 60 percent already of\n\n24   the property, aside from yours, under lease in the unit,\n\n25   correct?\n\n\n\n                            ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                         44\n\n 1           A.   If they had all the rest of it leased, yes,\n\n 2   approximately 60 percent.\n\n 3           Q.   And if you did not join the unit and your property\n\n 4   was released, your interest in the property was released, the\n\n 5   portion that would have gone to you would have just stayed with\n\n 6   Samson, wouldn't it?\n\n 7           A.   I believe that's correct.\n\n 8           Q.   And that's perfectly legal, isn't it?\n\n 9           A.   Yes.\n\n10           Q.   They would not have been doing anything improper,\n\n11   illegal, or wrong by doing that, would they?\n\n12           A.   I suppose not.\n\n13           Q.   So, they had zero incentive, didn't they, Mr. Hooks,\n\n14   to feel compelled to do whatever it took to get you into the\n\n15   unit?\n\n16           A.   I don't know what their incentive is.\n\n17           Q.   Given that they had more money in their pocket\n\n18   without you going into the unit, would you agree with me that\n\n19   certainly is a counterincentive?\n\n20           A.   I -- if that were the case, it would appear to be.\n\n21           Q.   Now, since you have -- and setting aside the\n\n22   question of whether you're really even in the unit or not due\n\n23   to lack of complying with your own specific terms, you have\n\n24   been receiving the checks as you have been all along, right?\n\n25           A.   Yes.\n\n\n\n                         ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                          45\n\n 1        Q.     And you said that you've been cashing them because\n\n 2   you think, well, Samson owes me money anyway.      So, this will\n\n 3   just be kind of a down payment or something like that.      Do you\n\n 4   recall that?\n\n 5        A.     Well, yes, that would be -- I'd consider that part\n\n 6   of what I was owed.\n\n 7        Q.     How long have you been cashing the checks under that\n\n 8   pretense?   What did -- how long have you been cashing the\n\n 9   checks thinking, well, Samson owes me money anyway so I'm going\n\n10   to keep cashing them?\n\n11        A.     Well, once I became aware that there were some\n\n12   issues here associated with this situation that I didn't know\n\n13   about.\n\n14        Q.     Once you realized that you shouldn't have been so\n\n15   happy with that $2 1/2 million you'd been paid, then you\n\n16   decided that in the future it was going to be payments against\n\n17   what they really owed you?\n\n18        A.     I just saw no reason not to continue to take the\n\n19   checks, that whatever they may owe me in the future, that would\n\n20   certainly apply to that.\n\n21        Q.     Now, Mr. Hooks, there are two other wells in this\n\n22   unit, aren't there?\n\n23        A.     I believe so.\n\n24        Q.     I'll just hold this up briefly (complying).     Here's\n\n25   the BSM-1 that we've been talking about; and here's 2 and 3,\n\n\n\n                       ANITA L.

I wasn't even -- I was just addressing why I\n\n 2   hadn't done it, you know, in a timely fashion.         That's what\n\n 3   that was about.\n\n 4        Q.      It was a condition you put into the letter\n\n 5   agreement, and then you were going to be able to be the one\n\n 6   that decided whether you really had to do it or not?\n\n 7        A.      No.     I intended to do it.\n\n 8        Q.      But then you decided you just weren't going to do\n\n 9   it, right?\n\n10        A.      Only after the conversation with Ms. McGhee that\n\n11   that wasn't necessary to do it.       So, we agreed that we'd just\n\n12   not do it.\n\n13        Q.      Which, of course, we both know -- although you say\n\n14   it's only possible -- really has no effect on a written\n\n15   agreement involving oil and gas.\n\n16        A.      I did agree in writing to join the unit, but it was\n\n17   subject to further documentation.\n\n18        Q.      And that documentation, of course, never occurred,\n\n19   right?\n\n20        A.      Yes, that's correct.\n\n21        Q.      All right.     You...\n\n22                        Now, once -- I guess it was in the fall of 2006\n\n23   when you and Mr. Simpson ran into each other up at the\n\n24   Houston Club, right?\n\n25        A.

And that's the first time that you -- or sometime\n\n 2   thereafter -- and I don't know if it was that day or when --\n\n 3   but at some point then you became, you know, unhappy and felt\n\n 4   like you had been defrauded, right?\n\n 5        A.       After some further information came to light that\n\n 6   that was apparently the situation.\n\n 7        Q.       After that happened, did you pick up the phone and\n\n 8   call your acquaintance, if not a friend, Jimmy Broussard and\n\n 9   say, \"Jimmy, man, look what I found out.        I got snookered on\n\n10   this thing.     What about you?    Did you get tricked?    You're in\n\n11   the same situation\"?\n\n12                       Did you do that to see whether the other folks\n\n13   on the property had gotten hoodwinked?\n\n14        A.       I don't recall that.\n\n15        Q.       Why do you think that Samson picked on you?      Why do\n\n16   you think you're the only one that got tricked?\n\n17        A.       I don't know.   I may not be the only one.\n\n18        Q.       Well, has anyone else ever told you they got\n\n19   tricked?\n\n20        A.       No.\n\n21        Q.       Now, there was a little bit of testimony -- there's\n\n22   been some talk about this DuJay 1 well.        You know where that\n\n23   is, don't you, Mr. Hooks?\n\n24        A.       I think I do.\n\n25        Q.       Let's just put this up here just long enough for\n\n\n                          ANITA L.

Because there is another unit up\n\n 2   there -- and here it is on this board (indicating).\n\n 3                         There is a DuJay unit of which you are a\n\n 4   participant, correct?\n\n 5        A.       Yes.\n\n 6        Q.       Now, we don't -- here's the DuJay 1 (indicating).\n\n 7                         And you're in this unit up here (indicating),\n\n 8   right?     You're receiving money on the DuJay 1, aren't you?\n\n 9        A.       Yes.\n\n10        Q.       All right.     Now, nobody tricked you into -- or\n\n11   nobody did anything to deceive you or defraud you with respect\n\n12   to the DuJay 1 well, did they?\n\n13        A.       Not that I'm aware of.\n\n14        Q.       Well, you never talked to Mr. Lanoue about it.\n\n15   Nobody ever sent you anything that you say is fraudulent.            With\n\n16   respect to the DuJay 1 nobody did anything -- or from Samson,\n\n17   anyway, nobody did anything to trick you or hoodwink you or\n\n18   defraud you or something with respect to the DuJay 1, right?\n\n19        A.

It would be a well on our property.\n\n 3        Q.       You said several times that you weren't the least\n\n 4   bit confused about this map when it was sent to you by\n\n 5   Mr. Lanoue.     Now, tell us again why that map didn't confuse you\n\n 6   in light of the conversation you had with Mr. Lanoue.\n\n 7        A.       He commented that the well was located about\n\n 8   1500 feet west of Pine Island Bayou, that being west of our\n\n 9   property.     The plat indicates that the -- that the bottom hole\n\n10   location, which is what we were talking about, is about\n\n11   1400 feet west, which was, I considered, consistent with what\n\n12   he was saying.       I assumed that he was just estimating and --\n\n13   verbally, but the plat would be more accurate.\n\n14        Q.       Fair enough.\n\n15                        Did you have any reason whatsoever to suspect\n\n16   that Mr. Lanoue, calling you on behalf of Samson, was\n\n17   attempting to mislead you?\n\n18        A.       No, not at all.\n\n19        Q.       And --\n\n20                        MR. LOCHRIDGE:    I just have one thing further,\n\n21   your Honor, as a matter of clean-up.\n\n22        Q.       (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)      We had talked yesterday about\n\n23   the provision in the lease where they are to pay your ad\n\n24   valorem taxes.\n\n25        A.       Yes.\n\n\n\n                            ANITA L.

I -- no, I have no knowledge of -- of that, no.\n\n 5           Q.      Okay.     Now, Mr. Lochridge brings up an excellent\n\n 6   point.       If this number down here (indicating) is correct,\n\n 7   1400 feet from the east line of the unit, that well -- I think\n\n 8   Ms. Foster said it wouldn't be on your property.          It would be\n\n 9   close; but, as he said, if you're just eyeballing it, it could\n\n10   be -- it could be on your property.\n\n11                           Isn't that -- doesn't that make it even more\n\n12   important that you'd want to get that clarified just in case\n\n13   Samson had made a mistake and it's actually on your property?\n\n14   Wouldn't you want that clarified?\n\n15           A.      Well, it was clear to me from what Mr. Lanoue said\n\n16   that the well was not on the property, it was 1500 feet west of\n\n17   our property, and that this was not inconsistent with what he\n\n18   said.\n\n19           Q.      But when you get a plat that potentially says\n\n20   something completely different, that didn't bother you?\n\n21           A.      I don't find that problem in it.\n\n22           Q.      Do you know the difference between a scaled map and\n\n23   a surveyed map?\n\n24           A.      I'm not sure I could give you a technical\n\n25   definition.\n\n\n\n                              ANITA L. BECKER, CSR, RPR, CRR\n\f                                                                           71\n\n 1        Q.    But you know that when a distance indicates that\n\n 2   it's scaled, that that means it's not surveyed.      It's been done\n\n 3   with a scale.     It's been mapped off on a plot -- on a plat with\n\n 4   a scale and a ruler, correct?\n\n 5        A.    That would make sense.\n\n 6        Q.    Which, of course, leaves room for inaccuracies\n\n 7   anytime you're using a ruler and trying to do something by\n\n 8   scale based on the scale of the map, correct?\n\n 9        A.    There would probably be some room for some error.\n\n10        Q.    And those numbers, as they indicate on that plat,\n\n11   are scaled, aren't they?\n\n12        A.    Yes.\n\n13        Q.    Now, I never implied -- or never said that you never\n\n14   talked to Ms. McGhee or told you talked to Ms. McGhee; but is\n\n15   there anywhere in your deposition, Mr. Hooks, where you said\n\n16   that, when you talked to Ms. McGhee, \"I told her that we didn't\n\n17   need that lease agreement after all\"?\n\n18        A.    I don't recall that.\n\n19        Q.    But you were asked on multiple occasions, at least\n\n20   two or three occasions in your deposition, \"Why didn't you ever\n\n21   complete the amended lease agreement?\"      You were asked those\n\n22   questions, weren't you?\n\n23        A.    Yes.\n\n24        Q.    And never once in response to that question did you\n\n25   say, \"Well, when I talked to Ms. McGhee, we agreed we didn't\n\n\n\n                         ANITA L.

Did Mr. Lanoue report to the team periodically\n\n 2   about his progress with getting the unit formed and\n\n 3   getting consents and things of that nature?\n\n 4        A.   I imagine he did.     That was eight years ago.\n\n 5   That would have been standard operating procedure.         I\n\n 6   can't remember exactly from eight years ago.\n\n 7        Q.   Would you remember if during the discussion of\n\n 8   those team meetings that Mr. Lanoue mentioned to you\n\n 9   that, \"Hey, we need to trick this guy because we need to\n\n10   get him into the unit\"?      Would you remember that?               10:40:47\n\n11        A.   That would have been one of those \"fall out of\n\n12   the seat\" moments that, yeah, you wouldn't forget that\n\n13   'cause you've got to know Glenn.      Glenn's as honest as\n\n14   the day is long.      That wouldn't have happened; and I\n\n15   would have remembered it, yeah.\n\n16        Q.   What -- if Mr. Hooks had declined to\n\n17   participate in the unit, what would Samson have done --\n\n18        A.   Well --\n\n19        Q.   -- with his tract, with his lease?\n\n20        A.   Sure.     Obviously we would have released that 50        10:41:15\n\n21   acres.\n\n22        Q.   But why is that?     Why would you have done that?\n\n23        A.   Well, that's kind of why it's so flabbergasting\n\n24   to hear Mr. Hooks claim that, you know, he would have\n\n25   opted out of the unit.      If we'd have released it or he'd\n\f                                                                        63\n\n 1   have opted out of the unit, then all that money that we\n\n 2   paid him, we would have got.          It makes no sense.\n\n 3           Q.    Was there any motive whatsoever to trick\n\n 4   Mr. Hooks or defraud Mr. Hooks into staying in the unit\n\n 5   or joining the unit?\n\n 6           A.    No.     As Mr. Hooks himself said, there was kind\n\n 7   of a counter motive, you know.          It makes the opposite\n\n 8   sense.       If anything, if he'd have claimed that we tried\n\n 9   to trick him out of joining unit so we could have kept\n\n10   his money.          Now, that makes sense because we would have         10:42:06\n\n11   gotten more money.          To claim that we tried to trick him\n\n12   into the unit makes zero sense.\n\n13           Q.    Did you need to keep his lease in order to\n\n14   recover the gas that was underneath his tract?\n\n15           A.    No.     We had the Broussard interest lease.   The\n\n16   Broussards had agreed to the unit.          That's all we\n\n17   needed.\n\n18           Q.    Well, frankly, Mr. Beale, did you even need the\n\n19   Broussard's lease to drain or to extract the minerals\n\n20   that might have been captured from coming under their                   10:42:45\n\n21   land?\n\n22           A.    No.     I mean we could have just excluded that\n\n23   acreage entirely and just drilled the well and formed\n\n24   the unit differently.          Then he didn't have to be in the\n\n25   unit at all.\n\f                                                                         65\n\n 1   and so forth.           My question to you is:   Was there ever a\n\n 2   big secret that this well was intended to be within\n\n 3   1,320 feet of Mr. Hooks' tract?\n\n 4           A.     I don't see how it could be a big secret when\n\n 5   you're turning in a plat that says that to the Railroad\n\n 6   Commission.\n\n 7           Q.     Now, you have seen introduced into evidence a\n\n 8   lease renewal and extension for 590 acres.            You recall\n\n 9   that?\n\n10           A.     Sure.                                                     10:44:38\n\n11           Q.     Mr. Hooks' tract is 640 and then the 50 had\n\n12   been participated in the unit?\n\n13           A.     Right.\n\n14           Q.     Samson took out a lease extension and renewal\n\n15   on the remaining 590 acres?\n\n16           A.     Sure.\n\n17           Q.     Why did you do that?\n\n18           A.     Well, we had a active exploration program going\n\n19   in the area.           It's just standard policy to keep your\n\n20   lease position intact while you're still active in the                   10:45:03\n\n21   area.        There's no reason not to.     It's small dollars.\n\n22   That's what we're in the business for.\n\n23           Q.     Did that -- does that other 590-acre tract and\n\n24   the renewal and extension you got on it have anything to\n\n25   do with the BSM-1 well or the DuJay 1 well?\n\f                                                                   66\n\n 1         A.   Absolutely nothing.\n\n 2         Q.   Why is that?\n\n 3         A.   Well, it's across a fault.   We included in the\n\n 4   unit the acreage that we felt was part of the -- you\n\n 5   know, what we were producing out of and then there's a\n\n 6   fault and then there's the other 590 acres which was\n\n 7   just completely different, had nothing to do with it.\n\n 8         Q.   So, could -- had you released Mr. Hooks' 50\n\n 9   acres, if he didn't want to join the unit, could you\n\n10   have kept the 590 acres, extended that and renewed that?           10:45:54\n\n11         A.   Yeah, could have, would have -- we did --\n\n12   whether he joined the unit or not.\n\n13         Q.   Did Simpson -- excuse me -- Samson have any\n\n14   incentive to agree to pay compensatory royalties to\n\n15   Mr. Hooks?    Would there have been any -- any scenario\n\n16   that under the conditions that we know existed that\n\n17   would have caused Samson to pay him compensatory\n\n18   royalties rather than release?\n\n19         A.   Well, let me think.   If we release it, we get a\n\n20   bunch of money.    If we pay compensatory royalties, we've         10:46:26\n\n21   got to pay out a bunch of money.     No, there's no reason\n\n22   to do that, absolutely none.     We'd have just released\n\n23   it.   We'd have made more money.    End of story.\n\n24         Q.   Now, Mr. Beale, at the outset of this -- this\n\n25   examination, we talked about how you felt about being\n\f         Cecilia Gower, CSR - 60th District Court, Beaumont, TX\n\n                                                                       13\n\n 1        A.   Yes.\n\n 2        Q.   Now, we also know from what we've seen that in\n\n 3   November of 2001 -- which we'll go to Exhibit 71 -- the\n\n 4   lawyer -- this is November of 2001 -- the lawyer sends to\n\n 5   Mr. Lanoue another amended plat.       And this one -- or\n\n 6   amended designation.\n\n 7                    And this one has an accurate plat on it.    Do\n\n 8   you recall that?\n\n 9        A.   I recall that I think the final amendment had the\n\n10   right plat.\n\n11        Q.   Right.     And that Mr. Lanoue had that in November\n\n12   of 2001, correct?\n\n13        A.   Makes sense.\n\n14        Q.   And we also know --\n\n15                    MR. LOCHRIDGE:   -- if you would put\n\n16   Plaintiffs' 19 up there --\n\n17        Q.   (By Mr. Lochridge) -- that it doesn't get filed\n\n18   until some 14 months later in early 2003, correct?\n\n19        A.   Right.\n\n20        Q.   So, it's not until then that if Mr. Hooks had any\n\n21   reason to suspect he had been misled that he could\n\n22   actually find some accurate information, correct?\n\n23        A.   No, I don't think that is correct.      I think there\n\n24   was a correct plat out there at the Railroad Commission,\n\n25   wasn't there?\n\f         Cecilia Gower, CSR - 60th District Court, Beaumont, TX\n\n                                                                            62\n\n 1   here.        Yet, I heard testimony today that the bottom hole\n\n 2   location is supposed to be 1400 feet, which is over here\n\n 3   (indicating).          So, those two things don't go around.     I\n\n 4   mean, just by looking at the plat those two things don't\n\n 5   match.        And then if you go to the Railroad Commission\n\n 6   records that were available at this time, the actual\n\n 7   bottom hole location is way over here.\n\n 8                      Then, in addition, the plat says the bottom\n\n 9   hole location is 1400 feet from the east unit line.            Well,\n\n10   the east unit line is this point right here, which would\n\n11   be 1400 feet this way.          So, if you just simply look at\n\n12   this plat in any detail you just see that it has severe\n\n13   problems.\n\n14           Q.     Let's talk about -- you can sit back down --\n\n15   well, keep standing because you're probably gonna point at\n\n16   the map.\n\n17                      What is the significance of the distance\n\n18   being marked as 1400 feet plus or minus scale?          And could\n\n19   you point to that over there?\n\n20           A.     Right here (indicating).\n\n21           Q.     Yes, sir.    What does 1400 plus or minus scale\n\n22   mean?\n\n23           A.     Well, scale means that somebody used a ruler to\n\n24   do it, as opposed to surveying it.\n\n25           Q.     Okay.    So, a surveyor didn't go survey 1400 feet.\n\f         Cecilia Gower, CSR - 60th District Court, Beaumont, TX\n\n                                                                           63\n\n 1   Somebody took out a ruler on a map with a scale and\n\n 2   measured 1400 feet?\n\n 3           A.    That's my interpretation.\n\n 4           Q.    Okay.    How would that possibly affect the\n\n 5   accuracy of this plat?\n\n 6           A.    Well, it's -- the 1400 feet doesn't go to any\n\n 7   known point that I'm aware of that's relevant or material\n\n 8   here, because it doesn't go to the bottom hole location\n\n 9   even shown on this map.         It doesn't go to the bottom hole\n\n10   location that's in the commission records at this time,\n\n11   been in the records about six months at this time.           So, it\n\n12   just sort of goes to an irrelevant point.\n\n13           Q..    Okay.    Well, how much faith would you put in on\n\n14   a -- you've got a copy of it in your hand, don't you?\n\n15           A.    Yes, sir.\n\n16           Q.    How -- is it difficult to accurately scale on a\n\n17   map like that?\n\n18           A.    Well, I mean, it's -- if you look at this scale,\n\n19   sure, it's subject to some error.\n\n20           Q.    What is the scale on that map, the one in your\n\n21   hand?\n\n22           A.    The one in my hand says an inch to 2000 feet.\n\n23           Q.    Okay.    So, on that plat 1 inch is supposed to\n\n24   equal 2000 feet, correct?\n\n25           A.    Right.    So, every single nick on this is about\n\f",

Hooks, III as “Hooks.”\n\n                           STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nNature of the Case:              On November 16, 2006, Plaintiffs joined a pre-\n                                 existing lawsuit brought by several lessors.\n                                 Plaintiffs asserted several breach of oil and gas\n                                 lease claims as well as fraud in connection with oil\n                                 and gas leases located in Jefferson and Hardin\n                                 Counties. Later, that case was severed into three\n                                 actions, this Hooks action being one of them.\n                                 Several of the breach claims were decided on\n                                 motions for summary judgment and the remaining\n                                 claims were tried to a jury in November 2008.\n\nTrial Court:                     The Hon. Gary Sanderson in the 60th District\n                                 Court in Jefferson County.\nTrial Court Disposition:         The original judgment in this case was against\n                                 Samson for $21,749,376, plus attorneys’ and\n                                 expert witness fees, costs, (all totaling\n                                 $22,251,297). $20,081,638 of the judgment rested\n                                 on jury findings of fraud. Of that amount, nearly\n                                 $13 million was an 18% contractual “late charge”;\n                                 and around $3.5 million pertained to a well as to\n                                 which Hooks admitted he had not been defrauded.\n                                 The judgment also awarded damages for several\n                                 alleged breaches of Plaintiffs’ oil and gas leases,\n                                 adding $1,615,481 to the judgment. Those alleged\n                                 breaches included a favored nations claim, a claim\n                                 for additional payments based on incremental\n                                 formation production, and a claim Samson had\n                                 wrongfully “unpooled” a unit. The judgment also\n                                 awarded $52,257 to Plaintiffs for their ad valorem\n                                 tax payments.\n\n\n                                        xii\n\fCourt of Appeals:                This Court’s panel was composed of Justice Keyes\n                                 (authoring judge), joined by Justice Massengale\n                                 and with Justice Sharp, concurring and dissenting.\n                                 The panel decided this case in a published decision\n                                 after it was transferred to this Court on a docket\n                                 equalization order.

The Supreme Court\n                                 affirmed this Court’s judgment reversing the trial\n                                 court’s summary judgments on the incremental\n                                 formation production and “unpooling” issues. Id.\n                                 at 65, 66.

The Supreme Court also reversed\n                                 this Court’s rendition of judgment against\n                                 Plaintiffs as to Plaintiffs’ fraud claim based solely\n                                 on limitations barring that claim as a matter of law.\n                                 The Supreme Court remanded the fraud limitations\n                                 issue to this Court for further consideration of the\n                                 factual sufficiency of the jury’s limitations finding.\n                                 The Supreme Court also remanded for this Court\n                                 to consider the legal and factual sufficiency of the\n                                 fraud liability and damages issues.

One of the judges of the original panel no longer serves on the Court.\n\nWhen this case was argued in 2011, a member of this Court stated this case was\n\npossibly the most complicated case then-pending before the First Court of Appeals.\n\n      The previous oral argument focused on issues no longer before the Court, such\n\nas whether Plaintiffs’ fraud claims were barred by limitations as a matter of law. The\n\nSupreme Court’s decisions against Samson were narrowly focused. As a result,\n\nvirtually all of Samson’s appellate points regarding the jury’s findings of fraud and\n\nfraud damages remain for determination by this Court. The remand also involves\n\nother issues including the most favored nations damages and interest charges. Oral\n\nargument would assist the Court in addressing issues that remain before the Court, as\n\ninformed by the Supreme Court’s opinion. Those issues remain complicated, and oral\n\nargument will assist the Court in addressing them. Furthermore, this case has always\n\nbeen factually complex, and remains so following this Court’s and the Supreme\n\nCourt’s prior opinion.\n\n      This case was transferred to this Court through docket equalization. Samson\n\nconsents to this Court conducting oral argument in Houston. Tex. Gov’t Code §\n\n73.003(b) (allowing parties to request transferee appellate court to conduct oral\n\nargument in the court’s regular location).\n\n\n                                             xiv\n\f                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nA.    Issues Involving Plaintiffs’ Fraud Claim\n      1.     Fraud\n\n      Plaintiffs sued Samson for fraud allegedly arising from Samson’s written\n\noffer to pool 50 acres out of one of Plaintiffs’ leases into a gas unit. The unit well\n\nwas not drilled on Plaintiffs’ tract; it was drilled on a different tract. Plaintiffs,\n\nacting through Mr. Charles G. Hooks III (“Hooks”), accepted Samson’s offer to\n\npool in 2001. PX156, 157.\n\n      Before Hooks accepted the offer, he requested a plat showing where\n\nPlaintiffs’ acreage would lie within the unit. Samson sent Hooks a scaled plat\n\ndepicting the lands and leases to be included in the unit.\n\n      That plat included several indications of where the bottom hole of the well\n\nwas located, including one Hooks interpreted to mean the bottom hole was 1400\n\nfeet from Plaintiffs’ lease. The plat actually said “1400´± Scaled.” Nearly eight\n\nyears later, Hooks testified he relied on the “1400´± Scaled” indication (while\n\nignoring other indications) when he consented to the pooling. Hooks claimed if he\n\nhad known the well’s bottom-hole was located closer than 1320 feet to Plaintiffs’\n\nlease line, he would not have agreed to the unit (the BSM1 unit), but would have\n\ndemanded that Samson comply with offset obligations set out in Plaintiffs’ oil and\n\ngas lease.\n\n\n                                          xv\n\f      There is no legally or factually sufficient evidence of fraud as to each of the\n\nfollowing:\n\n   a) fraud - misrepresentation – Hooks testified he relied on a measurement that\n\n      was indefinite on its face and on a scaled plat to determine whether a well’s\n\n      bottom hole was within 1320 feet of Plaintiffs’ lease line.\n\n   b) fraud - reliance - Hooks read “1400´± Scaled” to mean exactly 1400 feet.\n\n   c) fraud - intent to deceive - There is no evidence Hooks told Samson why he\n\n      wanted the plat or that he wanted a plat to answer his unstated question\n\n      about the proximity between a well’s bottom hole and Plaintiffs’ lease line.\n\n   d) fraud - duty to disclose – There was no fiduciary or confidential relationship\n\n      between Samson and the Plaintiffs, no continued reliance by Plaintiffs on the\n\n      plat, no knowledge by Samson that Plaintiffs might be relying on the plat in\n\n      this way, and Plaintiffs could have found the precise location of the bottom\n\n      hole by consulting public records.\n\n   e) statutory fraud - There was no “sale” of land but only a consent by\n\n      Plaintiffs to pooling, and the evidence underlying the jury’s finding of\n\n      statutory fraud has the same misrepresentation, reliance, and intent\n\n      insufficiencies as the evidence underlying the common law fraud finding.\n\n      Since statutory fraud fails, the judgment’s award of expert witness fees and\n\n      deposition costs should be reversed.\n\n\n                                         xvi\n\f      2.     Statute of Limitations for Fraud\n\n      Hooks and his wife executed the pooling agreement that is the subject of\n\nPlaintiffs’ fraud claim in May 2001. Plaintiffs did not file any lawsuit against\n\nSamson until November 2006 and did not amend to assert fraud claims until May\n\n2007. There were multiple publicly-filed records from which Plaintiffs could have\n\ndiscovered their alleged fraud claim at least by February 2003, and some of those\n\nrecords were in the official land records of both Jefferson and Hardin Counties. At\n\ntrial, the jury found that, had Plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence, they could\n\nnot have discovered their fraud claim until April 2007. Hooks’ testimony on that\n\nsubject was nothing more than the simple statement that he did not learn of the\n\nclaim until during discovery in the lawsuit during the Spring of 2007.\n\n      There is factually insufficient evidence that:\n\n   a) Plaintiffs could not have discovered the alleged fraud in the exercise of\n\n      reasonable diligence prior to four years before they filed suit for fraud.\n\n   b) Plaintiffs could not have discovered the alleged fraud by exercising\n\n      reasonable diligence prior to April 2007.\n\n      3.     Fraud Damages\n      Plaintiffs originally pleaded this action as one for breach of an oil and gas\n\nlease. They pleaded that Samson did not pay compensatory royalty on production\n\nfrom Samson’s wells on adjacent leases and units, which they claimed were\n\n\n                                         xvii\n\fbottomed within 1320 feet of their Jefferson County lease line. Plaintiffs also\n\npleaded fraud in the alternative. The trial court rendered summary judgment\n\nagainst Plaintiffs on their breach of lease compensatory royalty claim. Plaintiffs\n\nthen tried their alleged fraud claim to the jury, but Plaintiffs introduced no\n\nevidence of fraud damages and did not seek to set aside their written consent to the\n\npooled unit. Plaintiffs’ damages evidence was (i) based on exactly the same\n\ncalculation as their breach of lease claim for compensatory royalties, (ii) calculated\n\nas if their fraud claim were a breach of lease claim, and (iii) as if their consent to\n\njoin the unit did not exist. The damages also included (i) contractual late fees\n\n(prejudgment interest) compounded monthly at 18% (ii) damages attributable to\n\nanother well as to which Hooks admitted there was no fraud; and (iii) incremental\n\nformation production damages later found by this Court and the Supreme Court to\n\nhave been improper.\n\n      There is legally and factually insufficient evidence of damages when\n\n   a. Plaintiffs’ evidence was not of fraud damages, but was of only breach of\n\n      lease damages.\n\n   b. Plaintiffs’ damages questions sought measures of special damages for which\n\n      they had not pleaded and to which they were not entitled as a measure of\n\n      out-of-pocket fraud damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xviii\n\f     c. Plaintiffs did not seek or obtain an order setting aside their written consent\n\n        to the pooled unit, but presented evidence of damages as if their land was\n\n        never a part of the pooled unit while continuing to accept payments based on\n\n        their continued inclusion in the unit.\n\n     d. The fraud damages awarded by the jury include compensatory damages for\n\n        another well as to which Plaintiffs admit there was no fraud.\n\n     e. The damages include a prejudgment interest rate of 18%, rather than 5%,\n\n        and interest was compounded monthly when it should be simple.\n\n     f. The damages included incremental formation production damages even\n\n        though Plaintiffs’ formation production claim has been reversed by this\n\n        Court and the Supreme Court and rendered against Plaintiffs on appeal.\n\n     g. As of the time of trial (and continuing through today), Plaintiffs continued to\n\n        accept payments from Samson as if Plaintiffs were still a part of the unit.\n\n        The fraud damages must be recalculated to take these payments into\n\n        account.\n\nB.      Issues Involving Plaintiffs’ Most Favored Nations Claim\n        The Supreme Court reversed this Court’s judgment with respect to\n\nPlaintiffs’ most favored nations (“favored nations”) claim, holding Plaintiffs were\n\ndue an increased royalty rate of 28.28896% (rather than the lease rate of 25%) for\n\nproduction attributable to Plaintiffs’ three leases to Samson. The favored nations\n\n\n                                           xix\n\fdamages awarded Plaintiffs in the judgment were based on a stipulation between\n\nthe parties. Court Ex A. The stipulation set out favored nations damages sums with\n\nand without incremental formation production included. Both this Court and the\n\nSupreme Court reversed Plaintiffs’ judgment for incremental formation production\n\ndamages. As awarded in the original judgment, the favored nations damages\n\ninclude the substantial amounts attributable to the incremental formation\n\nproduction claims. Furthermore, the damages only go through May 2008.\n\n       The fraud damages for the wells included in the BSM1 unit incorporated\n\nfavored nations amounts for those wells in the fraud damages. Should this Court\n\nagain reverse the fraud portion of the original judgment, Plaintiffs will seek an\n\nincreased royalty percentage for production attributable to production from the\n\nwells in that unit.\n\n       This Court must remand the favored nations damages for recalculation:\n\n   a. The original judgment’s favored nations damages include incremental\n\n       formation production damages, although Plaintiffs’ incremental formation\n\n       production claim has now been reversed by this Court and the Supreme\n\n       Court.\n\n   b. Assuming reversal of any of the jury’s fraud liability, limitations, or\n\n       damages findings, Plaintiffs’ favored nations increased royalty interest in\n\n       production from the BSM1 unit will need to be calculated and awarded.\n\n\n                                        xx\n\fc. Any prejudgment interest awarded on the favored nations damages must be\n\n  simple interest, not compounded monthly as Plaintiffs originally sought on\n\n  all their damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                  xxi\n\f                                 CASE HISTORY\n      This case returns to this Court following this Court’s reversal of the\n\njudgment below (except for an agreed-upon amount for ad valorem taxes) and the\n\nSupreme Court’s partial reversal, partial affirmance, and remand of this Court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n      The original judgment in this case was against Samson for $21,749,376.15,\n\nplus attorneys’ and expert witness fees, costs, and post-judgment interest at the rate\n\nof 18%. Samson Lone Star, Ltd. P’ship v. Hooks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012), rev’d in part, aff’d in part and remanded, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2015). The judgment arose from an oil and gas case involving\n\nallegations of fraud and breach of lease. $20,081,638 of the judgment’s total award\n\nrested solely on jury findings of fraud. Of the fraud damages, $12,995,832\n\nconsisted of an 18% contractual “late charge”; $3,547,241 pertained to the one\n\nwell (the BSM1 well) about which Plaintiffs complained at trial; and $3,538,565\n\npertained to another well as to which Hooks admitted he was not defrauded. In\n\naddition, Plaintiffs’ evidence of alleged fraud damages were based on the\n\nassumption Plaintiffs would win all their breach of lease claims, including their\n\nclaim for payments based on incremental formation production (“formation\n\nproduction”). As a result, the fraud damages have certain contractual lease claims\n\nincluded within those damages, even though those claims have been reversed.\n\n\n                                          1\n\f         The breach of lease claims—in addition to their inclusion in the fraud\n\ndamages—separately added another $1,667,738 to the judgment. Those breach\n\nallegations included $848,854 for increased payments under a favored nations\n\nprovision, $766,626 for additional payments under a claim that Samson had\n\nwrongfully “unpooled” a unit, and $52,257 for damages related to ad valorem\n\ntaxes.\n\n         The claims, this Court’s actions, and the Supreme Court’s actions are\n\nsummarized below:\n\nA.       Fraud\n         Plaintiffs asserted that had Hooks known the true bottom-hole location of the\n\nwell drilled on the adjacent tract, he would not have agreed to include his Jefferson\n\nCounty lease within a unit (the Black Stone Minerals No.1 “BSM1” unit) and,\n\ninstead, would have demanded compensatory royalties—one of the contractual\n\nremedies provided by Plaintiffs’ lease. This Court reversed the fraud portion of the\n\njudgment because it found, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs’ fraud claims were barred\n\nby limitations. This Court concluded Plaintiffs could have discovered the adjacent\n\nwell’s location from a directional survey filed in public Railroad Commission\n\nrecords. 389 S.W.3d at 428-30.\n\n         With regard to fraud, the Supreme Court held and ordered:\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f• Noting the allegedly-fraudulent plat that was the basis for Plaintiffs’ fraud claim\n\n     was also filed in Railroad Commission records attached to a P-12 pooling\n\n     authorization form, the Supreme Court held: “when the defendant’s fraudulent\n\n     misrepresentations extend to the Railroad Commission record itself, earlier\n\n     inconsistent filings cannot be used to establish, as a matter of law, that\n\n     reasonable diligence was not exercised.”      457 S.W.3d at 61. The Court\n\n     continued: “Under these circumstances, reasonable diligence remains a fact\n\n     question.” Id.\n\n• Based on its limitations ruling, the Supreme Court remanded for this Court’s\n\n     consideration “the factual and legal sufficiency of the evidence with regard to\n\n     common-law fraud, statutory fraud, and damages for fraud, as well as the\n\n     factual sufficiency of the evidence regarding when Hooks, by the exercise of\n\n     reasonable diligence, would have discovered the fraud.” Id.\n\nB.      Breach of Lease Claims\n        Three breach of lease claims decided against Samson were a part of\n\nSamson’s previous appeal to this Court. The claims and the Supreme Court’s\n\nactions on those claims are:\n\n        1.    Most Favored Nations\n        Plaintiffs’ leases to Samson contain a “most favored nations” clause\n\nrequiring Samson to pay Plaintiffs the same royalty percentage Samson pays a\n\n\n                                          3\n\fthird party should Samson enter into a lease (within a 3-mile radius of Plaintiffs’\n\npremises) with a royalty exceeding 25%. 389 S.W.3d at 434. Samson entered into a\n\npooling agreement with the State in which Samson paid the State an increased\n\nallocation of unit production as consideration for the State’s approval of a unit. The\n\nSupreme Court noted the increased allocation of production was equal to a royalty\n\nincrease from 25% to 28.28896%. 457 S.W.3d at 62. This Court reversed the\n\nfavored nations judgment because Samson did not enter into a new “lease” with the\n\nState, but entered into a settlement agreement called a “pooling agreement.” 389\n\nS.W.3d at 435. The Supreme Court reversed, holding the payment to the State\n\nmeant “Samson increased the State's 25% royalty on production from its tract to\n\n28.28896%” and “the royalty imposed by the Pooling Agreement is ‘payable\n\nunder’ the lease….” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 63. The Supreme Court concluded “the\n\ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Samson did not breach the most-favored\n\nnations clause.” Id.\n\n      The judgment lists “Damages for breach of Most Favored Nations Clause”\n\nof $848,854.01. 1Supp2dCR:6. That amount is attributable to two wells: the Joyce\n\nDuJay No.1 and the Joyce DuJay “A” No.1 wells. But that amount is composed of\n\n(i) $431.450.71 of damages for both wells plus prejudgment interest (contractual\n\n“late charges” calculated at 18 percent compounded monthly) resulting from the\n\nfavored nations increased royalty decimal of 3.28896%; plus (ii) $417,403.30 of\n\n\n                                          4\n\fbase damages and interest (“late charges”) for both wells attributable to formation\n\nproduction damages. Court Ex A.\n\n      2.    Incremental Formation Production.\n\n      Plaintiffs claimed Samson was required to pay royalty based on all liquid\n\ncondensate, and—on top of that—was required to pay royalty based on that same\n\ncondensate production again as if the condensate were produced as a gas. 389\n\nS.W.3d at 435-37; 457 S.W.3d at 63-65. Plaintiffs’ claims were based on a lease\n\nterm stating, “all such [royalty] calculations shall be based on formation\n\nproduction as reported on Texas Railroad Commission forms P-1 and P-2.” 457\n\nS.W.3d at 63. This Court held the formation production clause “does not operate to\n\ndouble the amount of royalties owed on the liquid condensate produced from the\n\nwell.” 389 S.W.3d at 437. This Court reversed the summary judgment in Plaintiffs’\n\nfavor and rendered judgment in Samson’s favor on that issue. Id. at 437, 440-41.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed on this issue, agreeing with this Court’s “decision\n\nwith regard to the formation-production claims.” 457 S.W.3d at 65.\n\n      Because of the disposition of this issue, any final judgment entered in this\n\ncase cannot include amounts for formation production. But both the alleged fraud\n\ndamages and the favored nations damages include formation production damages.\n\nFor fraud, the jury awarded and the judgment granted damages of $20,081,638,\n\nwhich precisely matched the damages Plaintiffs’ expert set out in his fraud\n\n\n                                        5\n\fdamages exhibit, PX608. 1Supp2dCR:6; 19CR:3268. That exhibit is titled,\n\n“Summary of Lost Compensatory Royalty with Incremental Formation\n\nProduction….” PX608 (emphasis added). Thus, the damages awarded for fraud\n\ninclude formation production damages (as does favored nations damages), which\n\ncannot be a part of any judgment.\n\n      3.     Unpooling\n\n      Plaintiffs’ third breach of lease claim was that Samson allegedly wrongfully\n\n“unpooled” a pooled unit by amending it. As the Supreme Court noted, “[b]ecause\n\nthe owner of 87.5% of the mineral interest in the tract where the well in this unit\n\nwas located refused to pool, Samson decided to ‘amend’ the unit designation.” 457\n\nS.W.3d at 65. Samson notified Hooks of the amendment and Plaintiffs accepted the\n\npayments made to them from the amended unit. Id. This Court held that under the\n\ncircumstances of this case, “Hooks accepted and ratified the amendment and\n\nredesignation of the units.” 389 S.W.3d at 434. The Supreme Court affirmed this\n\nCourt’s unpooling judgment, holding: “[b]ecause of the undisputed contents of the\n\nnotice letter, Hooks' acceptance of royalties for the new unit, and Hooks' refusal to\n\nchallenge the new unit, we decide the question of ratification as a matter of law.”\n\n457 S.W.3d at 66. Because of the disposition of this issue, there is nothing left for\n\nthis Court to consider with regard to “unpooling,” and any final judgment entered\n\nin this case cannot include “unpooling” damages.\n\n\n                                         6\n\fC.    Post-Judgment Interest\n      The trial court’s judgment imposed post-judgment interest at the rate of 18%\n\ncompounded annually. Because the only remaining portion of the judgment after\n\nthe appeal to this Court was for ad valorem taxes—the subject of a trial stipulation\n\nbetween the parties—this Court held the proper post-judgment interest rate was\n\n5%, rather than 18%. 389 S.W.3d at 439. The Supreme Court held the “leases only\n\nimpose ‘the maximum [interest] rate allowed by law’ for past-due royalties.” 457\n\nS.W.3d at 69 (emphasis added). Accordingly, to the extent Hooks ultimately\n\n“recovers for past due royalties, he is entitled to an 18% interest rate” but “[f]or\n\nother recoveries, the statutory rate of 5% applies….” 457 S.W.3d at 70.\n\nD.    Attorneys’ Fees\n      The trial court’s judgment awarded attorneys’ fees in accordance with a\n\nstipulation between the parties. Following the reversal of all claims on appeal\n\n(leaving only the agreed-upon ad valorem tax amounts to be paid by Samson), this\n\nCourt also reversed the attorneys’ fees award. 389 S.W.3d at 438. The Supreme\n\nCourt, however, held Plaintiffs were entitled to recover on their favored nations\n\nclaims, thus entitling them to the stipulated amounts of attorneys’ fees. 457 S.W.3d\n\nat 69. The fees were $300,000 through trial and another $70,000 through all\n\nappeals. 18CR:3166.\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fE.     Hooks’ Cross-Appeal\n       Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal challenging a summary judgment denying their\n\nclaims that Samson had supposedly breached offset obligations concerning\n\nPlaintiffs’ two leases in Hardin County, north of the lease at issue on the fraud\n\nclaim. This Court affirmed that summary judgment based on Samson’s limitations\n\ndefense. The Supreme Court reversed this Court’s affirmance because it disagreed\n\nthe claims were entirely barred by limitations. 457 S.W.3d at 68-69. That portion\n\nof the case has also been remanded for this Court’s consideration of “the merits of\n\nHooks’ claim for breach of the offset provisions and the proper construction of”\n\nthe clause at issue. Id. at 69.\n\n       In their cross-appeal, Plaintiffs asserted their offset obligation that applied\n\nwhen a well was drilled on lands “not more than … 1320´ from the leased\n\npremises” applied even when a well was drilled much farther than 1320 feet from\n\nPlaintiffs’ leased premises. Plaintiffs’ theory is based on a common provision in\n\nTexas oil and gas leases stating operations on pooled units\n\n       …shall be considered as operations for drilling on or production of\n       gas from the Leased Premises, whether or not the well or wells be\n       located on the Leased Premises, and the entire acreage constituting\n       such unit or units shall be treated for all purposes, except the payment\n       of royalties on production from the pooled unit, as if the same were\n       included in this Lease. [PX26¶V(E), PX27¶V(E).]\n\n       Plaintiffs assert this provision means all their lease terms (and the terms of\n\nany other lease with such a provision) are spread to the entire unit so that if a well\n\n                                          8\n\fis drilled within 1320 feet of any unit line (as opposed to a lease line as the lease\n\nsays), Samson owes offset obligations to Plaintiffs even though the well is not\n\nwithin 1320 feet of their lease. Moreover, Samson did in fact offset the wells at\n\nissue in Plaintiffs’ cross-appeal and Plaintiffs failed to provide notice to Samson of\n\nSamson’s alleged default.\n\n        Because these offset obligation claims are the subject of Hooks’ cross-\n\nappeal, Samson will address these claims in its response to Hooks’ supplemental\n\nbrief on this subject.\n\nF.      Samson’s Appeal Issues on Remand\n        As a result of the Supreme Court’s decision, the issues raised by Samson in\n\nits appeal that were remanded for this Court’s consideration are:\n\n     1. Legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting common law fraud;\n\n     2. Legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting statutory fraud;\n\n     3. Legal and factual sufficiency of the fraud damages, along with a remand for\n\n        a reduction and recalculation of the fraud damages, including attendant\n\n        prejudgment and post-judgment interest issues;\n\n     4. Factual sufficiency of the jury’s finding on limitations;\n\n     5. Remand for recalculation of favored nations damages owed to Plaintiffs,\n\n        with consideration of interest issues including whether Plaintiffs are entitled\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f      to 18% prejudgment interest compounded monthly, as they requested during\n\n      the first trial.\n\n                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA.    Hooks Was a Very Experienced Oil and Gas Attorney\n      Hooks was an attorney with extensive experience in oil and gas matters.\n\n13RR:9. For 33 years, in addition to practicing law, Hooks managed his family’s\n\nconsiderable investments in oil, gas and mineral estates. 13RR:9-10. Plaintiffs\n\nowned properties in Louisiana and 36 Texas counties. 13RR:11. Hooks has\n\nnegotiated at least 100 oil and gas leases. 13RR:10-11.\n\n      Samson holds three separate oil and gas leases from Plaintiffs:\n\n      (1) 640 acres in Jefferson County (PX25) (called the “Jefferson County\n      lease”). Fifty acres from the southwest corner of this lease is the land at issue\n      in Plaintiffs’ fraud claims.\n      (2) 95 acres in Hardin County (PX26).\n      (3) 10 acres in Hardin County (PX27).\n      The primary issue at trial was Plaintiffs’ fraud claim. Plaintiffs were co-\n\ntenants in the mineral estate on the Jefferson County lease. 12RR:46-47, 13RR:26-\n\n27. Plaintiffs own 42.75% of the minerals in that tract; another extended family\n\nwhom Samson called “the Broussards,” owned the remaining 57.25% of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fminerals. PX25; 12RR:46-47, 13RR:26-27. Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease did\n\nnot grant authority to pool. PX25¶V(E).1\n\nB.     Samson Drilled the Black Stone Minerals No. 1 Gas Well\n       In April 2000, Samson began drilling the Black Stone Minerals No. 1 Gas\n\n(“BSM1”) well in the Walker Pettitt Survey in Hardin County. That survey lies\n\nimmediately west of the Pine Island Bayou, which is the Hardin/Jefferson County\n\nline. The bayou forms the western boundary of Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease\n\nand the 50 acres included in the BSM1 unit. PX25; PX569. The BSM1 well was\n\ncompleted in August 2000; first gas sales occurred October 2000. PX569, 627. The\n\nwell was drilled as a directional well in accordance with Railroad Commission\n\nrules. The bottom of the hole was drilled to a location southeast of the surface\n\nlocation. 11RR:122-24; 8 H. WILLIAMS & C. MEYERS, OIL                      AND    GAS LAW 264\n\n(2008) (directional drilling is “[t]he drilling of a well that departs materially from\n\nthe vertical,” frequently because of surface conditions). As reported in public\n\nrecords, the BSM1 well was originally planned with a bottom hole 1080 feet (i.e.,\n\nwithin 1320 feet) from Plaintiffs’ lease line. PX616; 12RR:48-49.\n\nC.     The Jefferson County Lease Contained Offset Obligations\n       Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease provided if the leased lands were not\n\npooled, and a gas well was drilled within 1320 feet of the leased premises, Samson\n1\n “Pooling is the combining of tracts or interests, or parts of tracts or interests, for facilitating\nmore orderly development and production of oil, gas and associated products.” OWEN L.\nANDERSON ET AL., HEMINGWAY OIL AND GAS LAW AND TAXATION, §7.13 AT 386 (4th ed. 2004).\n                                                11\n\fhad to do one of: (1) drill a well on the lease; (2) pay Plaintiffs compensatory\n\nroyalty equal to their share of production from the adjacent producing well as if\n\nthat well had been drilled on their lease; or (3) release the Lease and have no\n\nfurther obligations. PX25¶VI(A).2 Separately, in addition to the offset obligations,\n\nSamson could at any time release “any portion or portions” of the lease “and be\n\nrelieved of all obligations as to the acreage surrendered….” PX25¶IV(B). Samson\n\ndid not owe any offset obligations if the well drilled within 1320 feet was on land\n\npooled with Plaintiffs’ lease.\n\n       Samson decided to create a 704-acre unit for the BSM1 well. Samson’s plan\n\nwas to include 50 acres out of the Broussards’ lease and Plaintiffs’ Jefferson\n\nCounty lease in that unit. That would require Samson to pay royalty to Plaintiffs\n\nbased on their proportionate interest in the unit, but it would otherwise extinguish\n\nSamson’s offset obligations. Otherwise, Samson simply could have released\n\n2\n The Jefferson County lease provides at ¶VI(A):\n      “A. …[I]n the event a well producing from a unit not comprised of acreage from the\n      leased premises … which has been classified as “gas” … is completed on adjacent or\n      nearby lands not more than … [1,320’] from the leased premises … Lessee covenants\n      and agrees to, within ninety (90) days from the date production is first sold …, either (1)\n      commence with due diligence operations for the actual drilling of an offset well on the\n      leased premises…, (2) pay Lessors as compensatory royalty … a sum equal to the\n      royalties which would be payable under this Lease on the production from said adjacent\n      or nearby producing well had same been producing on the leased premises, or (3) in lieu\n      of drilling such offset well or paying such compensatory royalty, release by recordable\n      instrument the offset acreage…. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Lessee\n      shall have no obligations under this Article … in the event a producing well ... is already\n      offset by a well on the leased premises or on acreage pooled therewith producing from\n      the same producing horizon …” [Emphasis added.]\nThe provision above measures the distance between the lease and where the nearby well is\n“completed.” The well at issue was completed very near its bottom-hole location.\n                                               12\n\fPlaintiffs’ lease pursuant to lease paragraphs VI(A) or IV(B), the latter of which\n\npermitted Samson to release the lease at any time. PX25¶¶IV(B), VI(A). Samson\n\ntook steps to obtain pooling authority from Plaintiffs and other mineral owners\n\nwhose consent Samson needed to form the unit. E.g., PX62, 63, 65. 3\n\nD.     Samson Contacted Plaintiffs, Offering to Include 50 Acres of Plaintiffs’\n       Jefferson County Lease in the Unit\n       On February 15, 2001, Mr. Lanoue—a landman then working for Samson—\n\nwrote Hooks requesting Plaintiffs’ consent to pool 50 acres of Plaintiffs’ Jefferson\n\nCounty Lease with adjacent land containing the BSM1 well (the “BSM1 unit”).\n\nPX65, 160.4 The Broussard family already had consented to the unit as to their\n\ninterest in the same acreage. PX63, 65; 12RR:122-23. Hooks wanted additional\n\ninformation and telephoned Lanoue on February 20, 2001. 12RR:124, 177; PX160.\n\nHooks and Lanoue discussed a range of topics concerning the well and the unit.\n\nPX160. Among Hooks’ notes of the conversation was the statement the BSM1 well\n\nwas about 1500 feet west of Pine Island Bayou—the western boundary of\n\nPlaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease—a boundary that can move as the river moves.\n\nPX160. Hooks’ notes do not indicate whether the two were discussing the well’s\n\nsurface or bottom-hole location, or a generalized number between the two.\n\n3\n  It is typical for the planned unit to change as the well is designed and drilled. 15RR:54-56.\nThus, there were different plats showing different participants in the possible unit configurations.\n15RR:56.\n4\n  As it appears in the record, PX65 is not identical to what Samson sent to Hooks, but is an\nannotated version of the letter. 12RR:175. The original letter more closely resembled PX63,\nwhich did not have a plat attached. 12RR:176.\n                                                13\n\fE.    Hooks Requested a Plat, and Samson Sent Him One, to Show the\n      Location of Plaintiffs’ Land within the Unit\n      During the February 2001 phone call, Hooks requested a plat showing the\n\nunit; Lanoue sent him one the next day. 12RR:180-81; PX64. Hooks testified he\n\nwanted the plat to see (1) how his property fit within the unit, and (2) whether the\n\nwell was within 1320 feet of his lease. 12RR:180. But Hooks admitted he may not\n\nhave told Lanoue he was interested in the offset obligation. 13RR:25. He also\n\nadmitted he may not have said he needed to know whether the well was within\n\n1320 feet of his lease. 13RR:25. Consistent with Hooks’ explanation of the first\n\nreason he wanted the plat, Lanoue testified he sent Hooks the plat so Hooks could\n\nunderstand where his land lay within the unit. 12RR:124.\n\n      The plat Lanoue sent is attached to PX65. 12RR:181. It is similar to plats\n\nsent to other lessors, including the State of Texas (see, e.g., PX62). It was prepared\n\nin August 2000, around the time the well was completed and months before\n\nLanoue contacted Hooks. The plat regularly was used through October 2001.\n\n12RR:33, 49-50. The plat shows the well deviated toward Plaintiffs’ lease. Lanoue\n\ntestified he estimated the well’s bottom hole location on the plat, using only a ruler\n\nto do so. 12RR:110-111. The plat repeatedly says it is “scaled,” meaning someone\n\nused a ruler, not a survey, to make the plat. 16RR:62-63; 13RR:70-71 (Hooks,\n\nagreeing to definition of “scaled”). It also uses the symbol: “±” in key places. As a\n\nresult, the plat does not purport to be exact or survey-accurate:\n\n                                          14\n\f      Following is a segment of the plat, with color coding added to highlight\n\ncertain features:\n\n                                      15\n\f        The plat has a line (red) depicting something is “1400´±” from the western\n\nboundary of Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease. PX65. (The 50 acres included in\n\nthe unit from Plaintiffs’ lease is in yellow.) An arrow (green) points to a bottom\n\nhole location not on that line, but to an east-west location slightly north of the line\n\nand approximately 3/4 of the way along that line. Three-fourths of 1400 is 1050.\n\n        The plat provides the following information in the lower left corner:\n\n\n\n\nPX65.\n\n        So the plat also states the bottom hole of the well is “1400´± Scaled” from\n\nthe eastern line of the unit (purple line, shown above). PX65 (“FEL” means “from\n\neast line of unit”). The eastern line of the unit is on Plaintiffs’ lease. PX65.\n\n\n                                          16\n\fRunning a line 1400´± westward from the unit’s eastern line would place the well\n\non or nearly on Plaintiffs’ Lease. PX65; 12RR:62-63.\n\n      These signals are contradictory. If the estimation of “1400´±” were to the\n\nwell’s bottom hole location, the BSM1 well could be farther than 1320 feet from\n\nPlaintiffs’ lease. “1400´± Scaled” from the east line of the unit indicates the BSM1\n\nwell could have been closer than 1320 feet to Plaintiffs’ lease. The arrow pointing\n\nto a bottom-hole location 3/4 of the way along the “1400´± Scaled” line showed\n\nthe BSM1 well was about 1050 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease. That is very close to the\n\noriginal estimated bottom-hole location of 1080 feet from Plaintiffs’ Lease.\n\nF.    Hooks Testified He Relied on the “1400´± Scaled” Depiction to\n      Determine the Distance of the BSM1 Well from Plaintiffs’ Jefferson\n      County Lease\n      To determine the BSM1 well’s distance from his Lease, Hooks testified he\n\nfocused on the line estimating “1400´± Scaled”:\n\n      Q. And what did you do to verify that the—what he told you was true about\n      the well being located 1500 feet away from Pine Bayou—Pine Bayou?\n\n      A. [Hooks] Well, I looked at the—what was indicated on the plat; and it\n      shows me that it was approximately—the bottom hole location was\n      approximately 1400 feet west of Pine Island Bayou.\n\n      Q. Now, that's a little bit different than the 1500 feet that he told you over\n      the telephone, right?\n\n      A. A little bit. I assumed that he was talking in generalities in that case and\n      that once he got the plat it was more specific on the plat.\n\n      Q. Well, did that spark any concern that he might be lying to you if he told\n      you 1500 on the telephone and then gave you a plat that was 1400?\n\n                                         1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>\n\f      <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">No. I—the plat speaks for itself.\n\n                                              ***\n      Q. Now, I want to—well, first of all, after you got this plat and checked it\n      out and confirmed what Mr. Lanoue had told you over the telephone, what\n      did you then do? Did you agree to—to accept the pooling?\n\n      A. Well, once I had satisfied myself that everything was in order, was\n      appropriate, then I decided I would send back the letter that he had requested\n      me to sign agreeing to this but with some changes on it.\n\n12RR:181-183. On cross-examination, Hooks continued to stress his reliance on\n\nthe “1400´± Scaled” distance:\n\n      Q. But, yet, you didn't call him [Lanoue], did you, and ask him for some\n      clarification?\n\n      A. Well, I didn't think I needed any clarification. It seemed clear to me that\n      it was—it was 1400 feet away from the bayou.\n                                              ***\n\n      Q. All right, Mr. Hooks. So, anyway, you concluded that wherever in there\n      the bottom hole was that it was in a satisfactory location, right?\n      A. Yes. I—I concluded that it was fourteen—approximately 1400 feet west\n      of Pine Island Bayou. [13RR:33, 35.]\n      Hooks emphasized he relied on the plat’s estimate of “1400´± Scaled” to the\n\nexclusion of everything else, including Lanoue’s statement over the telephone.\n\n13RR:36. He testified, “when I saw a surveyor’s plat that shows 1400 feet, I\n\nassume that’s more accurate than what his—his verbal estimation was.” 13RR:36;\n\nsee also 13RR:68 (“I assumed that he was just estimating and—verbally, but the\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fplat would be more accurate”). Hooks made no further inquiries regarding the\n\nlocation of the well’s bottom hole. 13RR:39.\n\nG.    Plaintiffs Agreed to Include their 50 acres in the BSM1 Unit.\n      On May 25, 2001, Hooks and his wife signed a letter consenting to pool 50\n\nacres from the Jefferson County lease into the BSM1 unit. PX65. They specified\n\ntheir acceptance was “conditioned upon the subsequent execution by Lessors and\n\nLessee of a formal lease amendment document to be prepared by [Hooks] and\n\nsubmitted to [Samson].” PX65. Plaintiffs never prepared such a document.\n\n12RR:187-88. At trial, Hooks testified repeatedly he always intended to be a part\n\nof the unit and considered Plaintiffs’ 50 acres to be part of the unit. 13RR:14-17.\n\nHooks also agreed to the division order setting out Plaintiffs’ percentage\n\ndistribution of the unit’s proceeds. PX156, 157.\n\n      After Plaintiffs consented to the unit, Samson sent them royalty checks for\n\ntheir unit interest in production for the three wells eventually drilled on the BSM1\n\nunit. PX552. Plaintiffs cashed those checks continuing through trial and now for\n\nmore than six years after the trial. 12RR:203-04; 13RR:44-45. Plaintiffs never\n\nsought any judicial decree setting aside their consent to the pooled unit.\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fH.     Other Operations Near and on the BSM1 Unit\n       Samson drilled other wells in the vicinity of Plaintiffs’ lease after Plaintiffs\n\nconsented to join the BSM1 unit. One of those wells was the Joyce DuJay No. 1\n\nwell (“DuJay1 well”), north of the Jefferson County lease. PX565. That well was\n\ncompleted in January 2002 and included in a unit called the DuJay1 unit. PX21,\n\n552, 565. Plaintiffs’ two Hardin County leases were included in the DuJay1 unit.\n\nPX21, 552. The bottom-hole location of the DuJay1 well was also within 1320 feet\n\nof Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease. PX640. Samson owed no offset obligations as\n\nto the DuJay1 well because—although the well was drilled within 1320 feet of the\n\nJefferson County lease—it was already offset by the BSM1 well 5 Hooks testified\n\nhe had not been defrauded with regard to the DuJay1 well:\n\n       Q. All right. Now, nobody tricked you into – or nobody did anything to\n       deceive you or defraud you with respect to the DuJay 1 well, did they?\n\n       A. [Hooks] Not that I'm aware of.\n\n       Q. Well, you never talked to Mr. Lanoue about it. Nobody ever sent you\n       anything that you say is fraudulent. With respect to the DuJay 1 nobody did\n       anything—or from Samson, anyway, nobody did anything to trick you or\n       hoodwink you or defraud you or something with respect to the DuJay 1,\n       right?\n\n        A. Not that I'm aware of, no.\n\n\n5\n  The Jefferson County lease states, “Lessee shall have no [offset] obligations under this Article\nVI in the event a producing well on nearby or adjacent land is already offset by a well on the\nleased premises or on acreage pooled therewith producing from the same producing horizon\nfrom which production has been secured….” PX25 ¶VI (A). Both the BSM1 well and the\nDuJay1 well produced from the same formation and offset one another.\n                                               20\n\f13RR:53. Nevertheless, alleged “damages” for the DuJay1 were included in the\n\njury’s award of “fraud damages.” PX608; 19CR:3268.\n\n          Other wells followed the DuJay1. See PX552; 13RR:136. Plaintiffs did not\n\nclaim any of these additional wells was within 1320 feet of the Jefferson County\n\nlease.\n\n          No well was ever drilled on any of Plaintiffs’ three leases to Samson. The\n\nroyalties Samson paid to Plaintiffs always were based on the inclusion of\n\nPlaintiffs’ leases in a pooled unit, with unit wells drilled on someone else’s\n\nproperty. Through May 2008, Plaintiffs received over $510,000 in royalty from the\n\nBSM1 unit (the subject of Plaintiffs’ fraud claim), and over $2.14 million in\n\nroyalty from Samson for wells drilled on units pooled with one or more of\n\nPlaintiffs’ three leases. 16RR:21-22; DX3; PX552. Now, seven years later, those\n\npayments—all received and deposited by Plaintiffs—are much higher than in 2008.\n\nDespite these facts, Plaintiffs claim to have been damaged in excess of $22\n\nmillion. 6\n\nI.        This Lawsuit\n          In August 2004, an action was filed against Samson styled Joyce DuJay Lee\n\nv. Samson. 1CR:2. The Lee plaintiffs complained about pooling issues unrelated to\n\nthe BSM1 well. In December 2004, a second action, Thomas Klorer et al. v.\n\n\n6\n    In recent trial court filings, Plaintiffs now assert their claims exceed $52 million.\n                                                    21\n\fSamson, was filed in which other landowners also complained about the same\n\nunrelated pooling issue. 1Supp1stCR:2. Those two actions were consolidated in\n\nAugust 2005. 2CR:295.\n\n      On his birthday in the fall of 2006, Hooks attended a seminar for oil and gas\n\nlawyers. 12RR:165-66; 13RR:50. There, he met Plaintiffs’ attorney Paul Simpson,\n\nwho told Hooks he was handling the consolidated actions against Samson.\n\n12RR:165-67. Following that encounter, Plaintiffs joined the pending case on\n\nNovember 16, 2006. 3CR:440. At that time, however, Plaintiffs did not plead fraud\n\nclaims. 3CR:440-465. They added fraud allegations May 7, 2007. 4CR:467, 490-\n\n94. In the May 7, 2007 petition, Plaintiffs alleged in the alternative—relying on\n\ndiffering facts—(1) they had never been part of the BSM1 unit and Samson\n\nbreached its lease by not paying compensatory royalties; or (2) if they were a part\n\nof the unit, Samson defrauded them into joining the unit. 4CR:487-94. Plaintiffs\n\nhad not notified Samson about their fraud or lease breach allegations prior to filing\n\nthose claims. Accordingly, Samson drilled wells in the vicinity of the BSM1 unit in\n\nreliance on Plaintiffs’ participation in that unit.\n\n      In September 2007, the trial court severed the action into three cases, one of\n\nwhich became this Hooks action, which was tried and is now this appeal. 4CR:626.\n\nThe trial court granted summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs’ breach of lease\n\nclaim with regard to the drilling of the BSM1 well because it was barred by\n\n\n                                            22\n\flimitations. That left Plaintiffs with only their fraud claim. 18CR:3162. Plaintiffs\n\ndid not appeal from the granting of the breach of lease summary judgment. The\n\nfraud claim was tried to the jury, along with the formation production claim. The\n\njudgment entered following the jury trial, in combination with previous summary\n\njudgment rulings, awarded the following amounts [1Supp2dCR:6; Court Ex.

There is factually insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding Hooks, in the exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence, could not have discovered his fraud claim until April 2007. Further,\n\nthere is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support fraud damages and\n\nprejudgment interest on those damages.\n\n      Common Law Fraud Liability. There is legally and factually insufficient\n\nevidence to support Plaintiffs’ common law fraud claim for the following reasons:\n\n   • The plat was marked “scaled,” meaning it was inexact and the distance upon\n\n      which Plaintiff testified he relied said “1400´± Scaled”. A distance of\n\n      “1400´± Scaled” is too indefinite to form the basis of a misrepresentation\n\n      when someone is attempting to determine whether a well is 1320 feet from a\n\n      lease line. Plaintiffs’ witnesses admitted there had to be at least some give\n\n      on the 1400 number, with Plaintiffs’ expert admitting it could be a 100 foot\n\n      tolerance.\n\n   • Hooks ignored the “±” part of the plat when he supposedly relied on the\n\n      “1400´± Scaled” distance call. He could not justifiably have relied on such\n\n      an indefinite measurement when he was looking for a precise answer to his\n\n      supposed question—a question he never even posed to Samson.\n\n\n                                         24\n\f   • Hooks admitted he may not have told Samson why he cared about the\n\n      location of the BSM1 well. Samson’s landman, Lanoue, thought Hooks\n\n      wanted the plat only to see where Plaintiffs’ lease was located within the\n\n      unit, which the plat plainly showed. There was no evidence Samson had any\n\n      intent in supplying the plat to defraud Plaintiffs into consenting to the unit.\n\n   • Plaintiffs failed to prove a duty to disclose existed. First, as a matter of law,\n\n      no duty to disclose existed. Second, there is legally and factually insufficient\n\n      evidence of the breach of a duty to disclose. Samson did not know Plaintiffs\n\n      were relying on the plat in the way Hooks testified. Further, Plaintiffs were\n\n      not “continuing” to rely on the plat after the date they consented to the unit.\n\n      Finally, in contrast to the requirement Plaintiffs must lack an equal\n\n      opportunity to discover “the truth,” Plaintiffs had access to multiple public\n\n      records from which they could have learned the bottom hole’s precise\n\n      distance from their lease line.\n\n      Statutory Fraud Liability. Statutory fraud does not even apply to these facts\n\nbecause there was no “sale” of real estate. Moreover, for the same reasons as\n\nabove, there is legally and factually insufficient evidence of statutory fraud. That\n\nclaim requires the same misrepresentation, intent, and reliance elements as\n\ncommon law fraud. There is no, or insufficient, evidence of any of those elements.\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f      Statute of Limitations for Fraud. The misrepresentation allegedly occurred in\n\nFebruary 2001 and Plaintiffs supposedly acted on it in May 2001, when they\n\nsigned the pooling consent. But Plaintiffs did not file their fraud claim until May\n\n2007. Limitations for fraud is four years. There is factually insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s finding that Plaintiffs, by exercising reasonable diligence, could\n\nnot have discovered their fraud claim until April 2007. Hooks’ testimony on the\n\nissue was nothing more than a statement of when he actually learned about the\n\nclaim. He did not provide any evidence why, in the exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence (as an experienced oil and gas attorney and mineral owner), he could not\n\nhave discovered his claim earlier. Accordingly, there is factually insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s answer to when Plaintiffs could have discovered the\n\nalleged fraud by exercising reasonable diligence.\n\n      Improper Fraud Damages. There was legally and factually insufficient\n\nevidence supporting Plaintiffs’ damages evidence for the following reasons:\n\n   • There was no evidence of a fraud measure of damages. Instead, Plaintiffs\n\n      presented only breach of lease damages as alleged fraud damages.\n\n   • Although Plaintiffs attempted to categorize their damages as “consequential”\n\n      damages, they never pleaded for consequential damages.\n\n   • In this alleged fraud in the inducement case, Plaintiffs had a choice of (1)\n\n      setting aside the agreement they claim they were induced to sign (the\n\n                                         26\n\f   pooling consent) or (2) standing on that agreement and seeking fraud\n\n   damages. Plaintiffs never attempted to set aside the agreement to pool but\n\n   nevertheless sought damages as if that consent to pooling did not exist.\n\n   Throughout this case, they accepted royalty payments from that unit and\n\n   continue to do so to this day.\n\n• Approximately half of Plaintiffs’ claimed fraud damages were attributable to\n\n   another well—the DuJay1 well—as to which Hooks admitted he was not\n\n   defrauded. Moreover, to the extent Plaintiffs were seeking compensatory\n\n   royalty damages for the DuJay1 well, there was no evidence (and\n\n   insufficient evidence) those damages were foreseeable at the time the\n\n   alleged fraud supposedly occurred.\n\n• Almost ⅔ of the fraud damages ($12,995,832) represents an improper\n\n   contractual “late charge” of 18% compounded monthly. The 18% interest\n\n   rate “only” applies to “past due royalties” not to fraud damages. Hooks, 457\n\n   S.W.3d at 69-70. Fraud damages are an “other recovery” to which “the\n\n   statutory rate of 5% applies.” Id. at 70. Here, the 18% contractual late charge\n\n   was incorporated into the fraud damages calculations and is part of the jury’s\n\n   damages award, so there is no proper evidence of fraud damages. PX608;\n\n   1Supp2dCR:6.\n\n\n\n\n                                      27\n\f   • The fraud damages also incorporated damages for formation production. The\n\n      Supreme Court held Plaintiffs are not entitled to formation production\n\n      damages. Accordingly, the fraud damages must be reversed.\n\n   • Plaintiffs have continued to accept royalties from the unit. Accordingly,\n\n      those payments have to be taken into account if any damages are awarded to\n\n      Plaintiffs.\n\n      Recalculation of Favored Nations Damages. The parties entered into a\n\nstipulation of the favored nations damages, both with and without formation\n\nproduction damages. The favored nations damages awarded in the original\n\njudgment are incorrect now because they, like the fraud damages, include\n\nformation production damages. Thus, the favored nations damages need to be\n\nrecalculated. Moreover, because the damages currently only go through May 2008,\n\nPlaintiffs certainly will request those damages be made current. As a consequence,\n\nthis Court should remand the favored nations damages to be recalculated by the\n\ntrial court. In connection with that remand, Plaintiffs asserted the late payment\n\nprovision provides for monthly compounding of interest at 18%. The Supreme\n\nCourt agreed to the 18% interest rate for past-due royalties. But Plaintiffs are\n\nentitled to prejudgment interest measured by the standard “simple” interest\n\nmeasure. Other courts, interpreting contract language similar to the language at\n\nissue in this case, have held the language allows for 18% simple interest.\n\n                                         28\n\f                                   ARGUMENT\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n      Samson’s appeal presents both legal and factual insufficiency of the\n\nevidence challenges to the jury’s findings on fraud and fraud damages. Further,\n\nthis appeal presents factual insufficiency challenges to the jury’s limitations\n\nfinding on fraud. Finally, this appeal presents legal questions surrounding damages\n\nremand, interest calculation questions, and damages recalculations.\n\n      This Court should sustain a legal sufficiency challenge on issues on which\n\nPlaintiffs bear the burden of proof if “the evidence demonstrates a complete\n\nabsence of a vital fact, or if the evidence offered is no more than a scintilla.”\n\nBurbage v.

There is legally and factually insufficient evidence             of   a\n             misrepresentation on which Hooks claims to have relied\n      Hooks’ reliance was limited. He made it very clear he only relied on the plat,\n\nand then on only one representation on the plat: the line saying “1400´± Scaled.”\n\nHe repeatedly disclaimed any reliance on Lanoue’s statements in their telephone\n\ncall. 12RR:181-183; 13RR:33-36, 68. He testified the “plat speaks for itself,” he\n\ndid not need “any clarification” and the plat was “more accurate” than Lanoue’s\n\n“verbal estimation.” 12RR:181-183; 13RR:33-36.\n\n      Hooks did not point to anything else on which he relied. He did not claim he\n\nhad relied upon the X,Y coordinates on the plat. He testified he disregarded the\n\ncontradictory statement in the legend that the well was bottomed “1400´± Scaled”\n\nfrom the east line of the unit. 13RR:38-39. Hooks did not rely on anything other\n\nthan the plat and he relied only on the one statement on the plat.\n\n      The problem is the plat does not say “1400´ absolute.” That is plainly how\n\nHooks read it; but that it not what it says. The plat does not say it is an accurate\n\nsurvey. In fact, it says the opposite. Hooks admitted at trial “scaled” means there\n\n                                         31\n\fmay be inaccuracies in the plat. 13RR:71 (admitting there could be “some room for\n\nerror” in a plat that says it is “scaled”); 16RR:62-63 (scaled map is subject to\n\nerror). And the plat does not say “1400´”. It says “1400´± Scaled”. And the\n\nmeasurement was to a waterway whose boundaries can move.\n\n       Both the statement the plat is “scaled”—meaning it says on its face it is\n\ninaccurate—and the statement “1400´±” mean the plat did not represent the line\n\nmeasured anything precisely 1400 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease.\n\n       The symbol “±” indicates a tolerance from 1400 feet. Plaintiffs’ expert\n\nsurveyor explained Lanoue’s original verbal estimate that the well was\n\napproximately 1500 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease could be explained by the plat’s\n\nindication of “1400´±”. 12RR:53, 67-68; see also 13RR:36, 68 (Hooks similarly\n\nexcusing Lanoue’s 1500 foot description). In other words, “1400´± Scaled” could\n\nmean a variance of 100 feet one way or the other. 12RR:53, 67-68. If “1400´±”\n\ncould include 1500 feet, then it could equally encompass 1300 feet. 1300 feet\n\nwould place the well closer than 1320 feet to Plaintiffs’ lease.\n\n       Indefinite statements cannot form the basis of a misrepresentation.

For example, the Slagle court observed one\n\njurisdiction had fixed the discrepancy at 10%. Slagle noted the discrepancy before\n\nit was less than 10% and held there was no fraud. Id. at 434; see also 26A C.J.S.\n\nDeeds § 274 (2015) (“more or less” relieves a “stated distance or quantity of the\n\nattribute of exactness”).\n\n      Here, if the 10% rule is applied, “1400´±” would include everything from\n\n1260 to 1540 feet. Even greater latitude is warranted when the term “Scaled” is\n\nused. There is less than a 6% difference between 1400 and 1320. So, even if\n\nsomeone read the plat as did Hooks, ignoring the arrow showing the well’s bottom-\n\nhole location to be about 1050 feet from Plaintiffs’ lease line, there was no\n\n\n                                        33\n\fmisrepresentation. “1400´± Scaled” warns it is inaccurate and the “±” causes\n\n“1400´” to be too close to the 1320 foot line. There was no actionable\n\nmisrepresentation here as a matter of law. Alternatively, there is factually\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding.\n\n      Furthermore, Hooks specifically admitted at trial there was no fraud as to a\n\nsubstantial portion of what the jury awarded as fraud damages. Plaintiffs’ expert\n\npresented fraud damages that included compensatory royalties supposedly owed on\n\ntwo wells—the BSM1 well (located in the BSM1 unit where the fraud supposedly\n\noccurred) and another well—the DuJay1 well. PX608; 19CR:3268 (jury awarding\n\namount to which Plaintiffs’ expert testified). Half what the jury awarded for fraud\n\nwas for the DuJay1 well. PX608 ($3,538,565.24 of the total $7,085,806.02 fraud\n\ndamages is for DuJay1 well; an additional $12,995,832.05 is “late charges” for\n\nboth wells). But the DuJay1 well was not drilled until significantly after Plaintiffs\n\nconsented to the BSM1 unit, and was in a different unit from the BSM1 well.\n\nHooks admitted he was not defrauded as to the DuJay1 well. Hooks was asked:\n\n“[N]obody did anything to deceive you or defraud you with respect to the DuJay 1\n\nwell, did they?” He answered: “Not that I'm aware of.” 13RR:53.\n\n      So, Hooks admitted there was no fraud with regard to the well comprising\n\nhalf the jury’s award for fraud damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f      2.     There is legally and factually insufficient evidence of reliance\n\n      For the same reasons the uncertainty of “1400´± Scaled” means there was no\n\nlegally or factually sufficient evidence of misrepresentation, there was similarly no\n\nand insufficient evidence of reliance. Hooks’ testimony demonstrates he treated\n\n“1400´±” as if it was simply “1400´.” 13RR:36. He did not “rely” on what was\n\nrepresented to him. He concluded the distance from the well to his property was\n\n1400 feet, exactly, and he relied upon his own conclusion. He did not rely on\n\nSamson’s plat, which said the “1400´” was “±” and the entire plat was “Scaled.”\n\n      There must be legally and factually sufficient evidence that a plaintiff\n\n“actually” and justifiably relied on the alleged misrepresentation.

There is legally and factually insufficient evidence Samson intended to\n            defraud Plaintiffs\n      There is no and insufficient evidence Samson intended for Plaintiffs to rely\n\non the “1400´± Scaled” or any other measurement on the plat to determine the\n\ndistance between their lease and the bottom-hole location of the BSM1 well.\n\nHooks was asked at trial whether he mentioned his concerns about Samson’s offset\n\nobligations during the conversation with Lanoue that resulted in Lanoue’s sending\n\nthe plat. 13RR:25. Hooks admitted he may not have mentioned them:\n\n      Q. Did you mention to Mr. Lanoue anything about offset obligations in that\n      phone call?\n      A. [Hooks] I don't know if we specifically talked about offset obligations.\n      We talked about the location of the well; and I believe that was clear, that\n      that was a potential issue.\n      Q. Well, you did not tell Mr. Lanoue that you were concerned about\n      whether the well was going to be within 1,320 feet. You never said that\n      specifically, did you?\n\n      A. I may not have…. [13RR:25 (emphasis added).]\n                                        36\n\f      Lanoue testified he sent this plat because he understood Hooks wanted to\n\nvisualize the location of Plaintiffs’ Lease within the unit:\n\n      Q. And, then, did you then send Mr. Hooks some additional information\n      about the Black Stone Minerals well and unit?\n      A. [Lanoue] He had called and was not sure—was not sure where their land\n      was laying. He wanted to know where their tract was going to be located\n      within the unit and requested a plat. So, I sent him one. I faxed him one.\n      [12RR:124.]\n\n      Lanoue also testified the lease’s offset provision was not a topic of\n\nconversation when he sent the plat to Hooks. 12RR:92-93. Lanoue explained, “The\n\nplat I’d sent to the Hooks wasn’t intended to be a plat showing where the—how far\n\naway the well was located. It was purely an informational plat to show where their\n\ntract was to be located within the unit.” 12RR:93 (emphasis added). The plat sent\n\nto Hooks was not one created at Hooks’ request. Lanoue drew it six months before\n\nhe ever talked to Hooks. 12RR:49-50. Moreover, Lanoue used it and similar plats\n\nfrom August 2000 through October 2001. 12RR:49-50.\n\n      Samson derived no advantage—monetary or otherwise—from Plaintiffs’ 50\n\nacres being in the unit. Plaintiffs’ 57.25% cotenant in the lease—the Broussards—\n\nalready had agreed to the pooling. 15RR:63. If Plaintiffs refused to join the unit,\n\nSamson could have released their 50 acres from their lease. PX25 ¶IV(B). The\n\nJefferson County lease expressly gave Samson the authority “at any time” to\n\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\frelease any portion of the lease “and be relieved of all obligations as to the acreage\n\nsurrendered.” PX25¶IV(B).\n\n      Had Samson been aware of Mr. Hooks’ allegations earlier, it obviously\n\nwould have released Plaintiffs’ lease, and Plaintiffs would have received none of\n\nthe $510,000 Samson paid them for their participation in the BSM1 unit through\n\nMay 2008, plus additional payments thereafter. 15RR:63. Samson’s geophysicist,\n\nMr. Beale, testified without contradiction that if Hooks had refused to consent to\n\nthe unit, Samson would have released Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease. 15RR:62.\n\nMost of the Jefferson County lease was separated from productive acreage by a\n\ngeological fault. 15RR:65-66. Hooks agreed that, had Samson released his lease\n\nand kept the Broussard lease in the unit, Samson would have made more money\n\nthan it did by including Plaintiffs’ interest in the unit:\n\n       Q. And if you did not join the unit and your property was released, your\n      interest in the property was released, the portion that would have gone to\n      you would have just stayed with Samson, wouldn't it?\n       A. I believe that's correct.\n       Q. And that's perfectly legal, isn't it?\n       A. Yes.\n      Q. They would not have been doing anything improper, illegal, or wrong by\n      doing that, would they?\n       A. I suppose not.\n      Q. So, they had zero incentive, didn't they, Mr. Hooks, to feel compelled to\n      do whatever it took to get you into the unit?\n       A. I don't know what their incentive is.\n\n\n                                            38\n\f        Q. Given that they had more money in their pocket without you going into\n       the unit, would you agree with me that certainly is a counterincentive?\n        A. I—if that were the case, it would appear to be.\n\n13RR:44. Hooks could not identify any reason why Samson would want to defraud\n\nhim into consenting to the unit. 13RR:44; see also 15RR:63. In other words,\n\nSamson would have benefitted by releasing Plaintiffs’ lease and excluding\n\nPlaintiffs from the unit, rather than by including them. 8\n\n       Proof of intent requires something more than a foreseeable possibility\n\nsomeone might rely on something. “The mere fact that it should be known that\n\nanother will rely upon a misrepresentation does not, of itself, establish that the\n\nmisrepresentation was made with the intent to induce reliance.” Blue Bell, Inc. v.\n\nPeat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523645\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523645/blue-bell-v-peat-marwick-mitchell-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (Tex.

There was no\n\nduty to disclose as a matter of law in this case.\n\n       Even if there were a duty to disclose outside a fiduciary or confidential\n\nrelationship, that duty would not have existed here. In this case, the “duty to\n\ndisclose” supposedly arose “when a party makes a representation and later acquires\n\nnew information which makes the representation untrue or misleading….”\n\n19CR:3266 (jury instructions). Under that circumstance, there is supposedly a duty\n\nto “disclose such information to anyone whom [the party] knows to be still acting\n\non the basis of the original statement.” Id.

There was no (and insufficient)\n\nevidence of either of these two elements. First, there is legally and factually\n\ninsufficient evidence Samson knew Hooks had used the plat to determine whether\n\nthe well was 1320 feet from his lease.

There is legally and factually insufficient evidence of a failure\n                   to disclose\n\n             The charge defined a “failure to disclose” as:\n\n      [1] the party fails to disclose a material fact within the knowledge of that\n      party; [2] the party knows that the other party is ignorant of the fact and does\n      not have an equal opportunity to discover the truth; [3] the party intends to\n      induce the other party to take some action by failing to disclose the fact; and\n      [4] the other party suffers injury as a result of acting without knowledge of\n      the undisclosed fact. [19CR:3266.]\n\n      Bearing in mind the alleged “failure to disclose” was of Samson’s November\n\n2001 plat (17RR:8), there was no or insufficient evidence of three of the four stated\n\nelements. Skipping to the third element, there was no or insufficient evidence\n\nSamson intended to induce Hooks to do anything when it sent him the original plat,\n\nor when it did not send him the corrected plat. There was no or insufficient\n\nevidence Samson knew Hooks was trying to determine whether the bottom hole\n\nwas within 1320 feet of Plaintiffs’ lease; Hooks had not said that was why he\n\nwanted the plat. 12RR:124; 13RR:25. On the fourth element, Plaintiffs suffered no\n\ninjury because of the alleged subsequent nondisclosure. The only injury of which\n\nPlaintiffs complain is their granting written consent to pooling. They had already\n\n\n                                         42\n\fsustained that supposed “injury” previously when they agreed to include their 50\n\nacres in the unit; that occurred significantly before the time Samson corrected the\n\nplat.\n\n        The second element calls for sufficient evidence Samson knew Hooks was\n\nignorant of the well’s distance from his land and did not “have an equal\n\nopportunity to discover the truth….” 19CR:3266. As stated above, there is no or\n\ninsufficient evidence Samson knew Hooks was silently questioning the bottom\n\nhole’s distance from his lease line. Moreover, there is no evidence Plaintiffs lacked\n\nan equal opportunity to discover the truth. Hooks could have directly asked\n\nSamson whether the well’s bottom hole was within 1320 feet of Plaintiffs’ lease or\n\nwhether the offset obligations had been triggered; but he did not. He was an\n\nexperienced Texas oil and gas attorney who could have requested the directional\n\nsurvey from Samson. But he did not do that either.\n\n        Furthermore, Hooks could have reviewed publicly-available records.\n\n“[F]ilings and other materials publicly available from the Railroad Commission are\n\na ready source of information….” HECI, 982 S.W.2d at 887. “As owners of an\n\ninterest in the mineral estate, [Plaintiffs] had some obligation to exercise\n\nreasonable diligence in protecting their interests.” Id. at 886.10 The Texas\n\n\n\n10\n  The Supreme Court fraud holdings were limited to the limitations issue. 457 S.W.3d at 61.

Plaintiffs cannot legally prejudice\n\nSamson by sitting on claims for so long.\n\n      With regard to limitations, the jury was asked: “By what date should the\n\nHooks, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discovered the fraud of\n\nSamson?” 19CR:3274. Hooks testified the alleged fraud was “discovered” in\n\nSpring 2007. 12RR:165-67; 13RR:50-51. Initially, the jury answered the\n\nlimitations question: “Hooks Birthday.” 19CR:3274. Hooks had met Paul Simpson,\n\nPlaintiffs’ lead trial lawyer, on Hooks’ birthday in 2006 at a lunch meeting of the\n\n\n                                           47\n\fHouston Bar Association’s Oil Gas and Mineral Law section. 12RR:165-66.\n\nInstructed to clarify their answer, the jury responded “April 2007”—months after\n\nHooks’ birthday. 19CR:3274; 12RR:165-66.\n\n      There is factually insufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that\n\nPlaintiffs should not have discovered facts putting them on notice of the alleged\n\nfraud before April 2007.\n\n      The following testimony is the only evidence touching on why Plaintiffs\n\nsupposedly should not have, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, discovered\n\ntheir fraud claim until 2007:\n\n      Q. Well, at what point in time just generally did you-all, through the\n      discovery process, uncover what had happened to you?\n\n      A. Oh, I think it was in the spring, the following spring that information\n      came out. [12RR:167.]\n                                          ***\n      Q. Now, once—I guess it was in the fall of 2006 when you and Mr.\n      Simpson ran into each other up at the Houston Club, right?\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. And that's the first time that you—or sometime thereafter—and I don't\n      know if it was that day or when—but at some point then you became, you\n      know, unhappy and felt like you had been defrauded, right?\n\n      A. After some further information came to light that that was apparently\n      the situation. [13RR:50-51.]\n\n       That is it: a simple bald-faced statement something came to light sometime\n\nduring the spring of 2007 in discovery. There is no explanation why the claim—\n\n\n                                       48\n\fwhich at least could have been discovered in various separate public records—\n\ncould not have been discovered previously. There is no explanation why discovery\n\nwas needed to find out about the fraud claim. There is no explanation what facts\n\ndiscovery revealed to Plaintiffs that put them on notice of alleged fraud. Nothing.\n\nThere is the bare assertion, and nothing more.\n\n      The fraud claim is based on the location of a well. That well had been in the\n\nsame place since July 2000 when Schlumberger ran the directional survey and\n\nsince August 2000 when Schlumberger filed that survey in the Railroad\n\nCommission records. It is not as if Plaintiffs were dealing with a moving target.\n\nThe well’s bottom-hole location has been in the same place since the summer of\n\n2000. Why it took Plaintiffs nearly seven years to locate the well’s bottom-hole is a\n\nmystery.\n\n      Moreover, the “April 2007” answer is wholly unsupported by the\n\nuncontradicted evidence Plaintiffs, themselves, put in the record. Plaintiffs\n\nacknowledge Samson filed a correct plat in the official public records of both\n\nHardin and Jefferson Counties in January and February 2003. 16RR:13 (Plaintiffs’\n\ncross-examination); PX19. That plat showed the correct bottom-hole location for\n\nthe BSM1 well and was attached to an amended unit designation. 11RR:183-84;\n\n12RR:6-7; 16RR:13; PX19.\n\n\n\n\n                                         49\n\f      So according to Plaintiffs’own evidence, the official public land records of\n\nJefferson County contained correct bottom-hole location information more than\n\nfour years prior to the date Plaintiffs filed their fraud claims.\n\n      Plaintiffs did not introduce a scintilla of evidence regarding why “in the\n\nexercise of reasonable diligence” Hooks should not have discovered the alleged\n\nfraud before April 2007. Plaintiffs provided no explanations or details, but only a\n\nbare assertion of when the alleged fraud was actually discovered, without further\n\nexplanation. Evidence is insufficient when it is only “generalized” and\n\n“conclusory.” Serv. Corp. Int’l v.

His\n\ntestimony was, in essence, “we discovered the claim when we discovered it.” So\n\nlong as someone testifies a claim was not discovered until it was discovered, then\n\nall fraud claims and all claims subject to the discovery rule will be timely filed.\n\n      The question was “By what date should the Hooks, in the exercise of\n\nreasonable diligence, have discovered the fraud of Samson?” 19CR:3274\n\n(Question 9, emphasis added). There was no evidence concerning the “should” part\n\n\n                                           50\n\fof this inquiry and there was no evidence concerning the “exercise of reasonable\n\ndiligence” inquiry. There was only an answer to the unasked and irrelevant\n\nquestion, “when did you happen to discover the alleged fraud?”\n\n       There is factually insufficient evidence to support the jury’s response to\n\nQuestion 9, and this Court should remand for a new trial on the limitations issue.\n\nE.     There is Legally and Factually Insufficient Evidence to Support the\n       Fraud Damages Finding\n       Plaintiffs’ evidence was of a legally incorrect measure of damages. 12 The\n\njudgment for $20,081,638.07 for “damages proximately caused by fraud” should\n\nbe reversed. 19CR:3268 (verdict); 1Supp2CR:6 (judgment). There is no evidence\n\nand factually insufficient evidence to support the jury’s answer to Question 3.\n\n       Leading up to trial, Plaintiffs pleaded, first, that they were not in the BSM1\n\nunit and Samson had breached the Jefferson County lease by not meeting its offset\n\nobligations. 16CR:2756-57. In the alternative, Plaintiffs pleaded that, if they were\n\nin the unit, it was because Samson defrauded them into giving consent.\n\n16CR:2759. The trial court granted Samson’s motions for summary judgment on\n\nPlaintiffs’ offset obligations breach of lease claims. 18CR:3162. That left Plaintiffs\n\nwith only a fraud-in-the-inducement claim. But Plaintiffs continued to seek the\n\nidentical contract measure of damages, even including damages for a well as to\n\n\n12\n  Samson repeatedly objected to Plaintiffs’ use of an incorrect measure of damages. 18CR:3171-\n73, 3200-07, 3232; 19CR:3322-26, 3353-58; 10RR:43-44; 17RR:10-14.\n                                             51\n\fwhich they admitted there was no fraud. So Plaintiffs pursued fraud liability, but\n\nsought breach of contract damages. Awarding judgment for contract damages was\n\nerror. There was no legally or factually sufficient evidence to support the damages\n\nawarded.\n\n      Because Plaintiffs chose to pursue an incorrect measure of damages, there is\n\nno evidence of damages. The damages testimony is based on a flawed\n\nmethodology and is “no evidence” of damages or causation. City of Keller, 168\n\nS.W.3d at 813; Kerr-McGee Corp. v.

Under the out-of-pocket measure Plaintiffs pleaded, they were not entitled\n\nto recover lost profit-compensatory damages.\n\n      4.     Furthermore, Plaintiffs could not seek compensatory damages unless\n             they set aside the pooling agreement, which is something they never\n             sought to do\n      Plaintiffs’ evidence was of an alleged fraud-in-the-inducement claim. They\n\nclaimed Samson supposedly made misrepresentations to convince Plaintiffs to sign\n\na pooling consent they otherwise would not have signed. On their fraud-in-the-\n\ninducement claim, Plaintiffs had a choice. They could stand on the bargain and\n\nrecover fraud damages, or they could seek rescission of their consent to pool. See\n\nFortune Prod., 52 S.W.3d at 676-77. They could not do both. Yet, Plaintiffs never\n\nattempted to set aside the pooling agreement and—to this day—have accepted\n\nsubstantial royalty payments paid to them solely because of that pooling\n\nagreement.\n\n      The problem is Plaintiffs waited too long before suing under their breach of\n\nlease theory; limitations lapsed on that claim. So Plaintiffs could not sue on the\n\nunderlying contract. And, importantly, as the Supreme Court has pointed out,\n\nPlaintiffs cannot sue through fraud to seek their contractual damages if the contract\n\nis unenforceable. Sonnichsen, 221 S.W.3d at 637. Importantly, however, Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\fcannot remain a part of the pooled unit and then pretend for damages purposes that\n\ntheir lease is not a part of the unit. 14\n\n       Plaintiffs had their opportunity to seek a proper measure of damages. They\n\nrefused to do so. Having had that opportunity, and having failed to prove damages\n\nunder a correct legal measure, this Court should render judgment against Plaintiffs.\n\nSee, e.g., Goldman v.

Plaintiffs were not entitled to their compensatory royalty damages\n              based on production from the DuJay1 well\n\n       Even if consequential damages were permitted, “lost profits” based on the\n\nDuJay1 well are not recoverable. The DuJay1 well is the source of half the $20\n\nmillion in fraud damages. When asked at trial, Hooks flatly admitted no one had\n\ndone “anything to deceive [him] or defraud [him] with respect to the DuJay1 well.”\n\n13RR:53.\n\n       Samson contacted Plaintiffs about pooling their lease into the BSM1 unit in\n\nFebruary 2001, and Plaintiffs consented to pool in May 2001. PX65. Plaintiffs\n\nreceived their first check for unit production in September 2001. PX552. Samson\n\ndid not begin drilling the DuJay1 well until October 2001. PX565. The proximate\n\ncause standard applicable to consequential damages requires proof of cause in fact\n\n14\n  Because Plaintiffs did not set aside their pooling consent, they should receive no damages. At\na minimum, however, Samson should receive credit for the payments it has been making to\nPlaintiffs on the BSM1 unit since the time of Plaintiffs’ damages calculations for trial.\n                                              56\n\fand forseeability.

There was no evidence of these things.\n\n       It was error to award damages based on the DuJay1 well and this Court\n\nshould reverse the judgment for fraud damages.\n\n       6.     The fraud damages improperly include “late charges” of 18%\n              compounded monthly\n\n       Approximately two-thirds of Plaintiffs’ fraud damages—an astonishing $13\n\nmillion—are not actual damages at all. Instead, that sum is a “late charge”\n\nmeasured at the rate of 18% compounded monthly. PX608. Those charges are\n\n\n15\n   Samson was authorized under Plaintiffs’ Jefferson County lease at any time to release “any\nportion or portions” of the lease “and be relieved of all obligations as to the acreage\nsurrendered….” PX25¶IV(B). This was not tied to the offset obligations paragraph. So, if\nSamson had known any of its well locations were a problem for Plaintiffs, Samson could have\nreleased all or a portion of Plaintiffs’ lease.\n                                             57\n\fimproper and the fraud damages judgment should be reversed on that ground as\n\nwell.\n\n        Plaintiffs’ “late charge” damages are another way in which Plaintiffs are\n\nattempting to convert their barred contract case into fraud damages. The Jefferson\n\nCounty lease states: “All past due royalties (including any compensatory royalties\n\npayable under Paragraph VI.B) shall be subject to a Late Charge based on the\n\namount due and calculated at the maximum rate allowed by law….”                            PX25\n\n¶XVII(C) (emphasis added).\n\n        “Late charges” are not proper out-of-pocket damages. 16 The “late charges”\n\nshould not be included in Plaintiffs’ fraud damages. Those charges were a part of\n\nPlaintiffs’ breach of lease claim they lost on summary judgment. Those charges are\n\nnot part of any fraud claim. With a fraud claim, the aggrieved party can seek\n\nprejudgment interest, not “late charges.” And the prejudgment interest is to be\n\nassessed by the court, not the jury. See Olympia Marble & Granite v. Mayes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1561379\"><a href=\"/opinion/1561379/olympia-marble-granite-v-mayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n\n        Moreover, the Supreme Court directly addressed this issue. The Court\n\nrestricted the 18% interest rate to “past due royalties” and held that rate could not\n\napply to other claims:\n16\n   Because Plaintiffs did not seek consequential damages at all in connection with their fraud\nclaims, they did not plead for late charges as fraud consequential damages. Although Plaintiffs\npleaded for late charges as a part of their contract claims, they never pled for late charges as a\npart of their fraud claim. 16CR:2753 (contract), 2757-58 (contract); 2765 (interest and attorneys’\nfees under Natural Resources Code), 2771 (maximum damages).\n                                               58\n\f      The leases only impose “the maximum [interest] rate allowed by law”\n      for past-due royalties. Accordingly, to the extent Hooks recovers for\n      past due royalties, he is entitled to an 18% interest rate. For other\n      recoveries, the statutory rate of 5% applies because Hooks has not\n      directed us to any portion of the leases providing otherwise.\n\n457 S.W.3d at 69-70.\n\n      Regardless how Plaintiffs measured their alleged fraud damages, those\n\ndamages are damages for fraud, not breach of lease. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ fraud\n\ncause of action is an “other recovery” for which “the statutory rate of 5% applies.”\n\n457 S.W.3d at 70. As it stands, there is no (and insufficient) evidence of any fraud\n\ndamages. But, if any portion of Plaintiffs’ fraud damages survive, the trial court\n\nmust be restricted to adding 5% simple prejudgment interest to those damages.\n\nAnd the post-judgment interest would also be 5%.\n\n      7.    The damages have to be reversed because they include incremental\n            formation production damages, which the Supreme Court held were\n            improper\n      The fraud damages included Plaintiffs’ formation production damages\n\nwithin the damages calculation. The exhibit on which the jury based its damages\n\nwas PX608. That exhibit calculated fraud damages as $20,081,638.07. PX608. The\n\njury awarded precisely that amount: $20,081,638.07. 19CR:3268. PX608 is titled\n\n“Summary of Lost Compensatory Royalty with Incremental Formation\n\nProduction.” So, the jury’s damages award included formation production\n\namounts.\n\n\n                                        59\n\f      The Supreme Court held this Court was correct in determining Plaintiffs\n\nwere not entitled to formation production damages. 457 S.W.3d at 64-65. As a\n\nconsequence, the fraud damages must be reversed for improperly including\n\nformation production damages.\n\n      8.     If this Court reverses and remands for a new trial on fraud damages,\n             then fraud liability will have to be retried as well\n\n      Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1 dictates, if this Court orders a new trial on\n\ndamages, it must also order a new trial on liability:\n\n      (b) Error Affecting Only Part of Case. If the error affects part of, but\n      not all, the matter in controversy and that part is separable without\n      unfairness to the parties, the judgment must be reversed and a new\n      trial ordered only as to the part affected by the error. The court may\n      not order a separate trial solely on unliquidated damages if liability is\n      contested.\n\nTex. R. App. P. 44.1(b) (emphasis added). There is a companion rule for the\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court. See Tex. R. App. P. 61.2. There is no question this\n\nrule means what it says. “Failure to comply with this rule is reversible error.”\n\nRancho La Valencia, Inc. v.

The Court Must Also Remand the Favored Nations Damages for a\n      Recalculation and Should Determine Issues Regarding the Application\n      of Prejudgment Interest to Newly Awarded Favored Nations Damages\n      As with the fraud damages, the favored nations damages wrongly include\n\nformation production damages. The judgment awards a total of $848,854 for the\n\nfavored nations claim. 1Supp2dCR:6. The parties had stipulated to different\n\namounts in accordance with whether formation production damages should be\n\nincluded with the favored nations damages. Court ExA. The amount in the\n\njudgment includes formation production. Id. The stipulation for favored nations\n\ndamages without formation production was $431,450.71. Id. As a result, the\n\njudgment needs to be reversed on this ground as well.\n\n      It can be expected that Plaintiffs will request that their favored nations\n\ndecimal increases be paid to them for production occurring after the end of May\n\n2008. Furthermore, should this Court reverse and render judgment on the fraud\n\nportion of the case, Plaintiffs will also seek favored nations damages on the BSM1\n\nwell because favored nations damages were initially included in their fraud\n\ndamages.\n\n      In the trial of this action, Plaintiffs relied on the late payments provision to\n\ncalculate their prejudgment interest. That provision states:\n\n      All past due royalties (including any compensatory royalties payable\n      under Paragraph VI.B) shall be subject to a Late Charge based on the\n      amount due and calculated at the maximum rate allowed by law\n      commencing on the day after the last day on which such monthly\n\n                                          61\n\f      royalty payment could have been timely made and for every calendar\n      month and/or fraction thereof from the due date until paid, plus\n      attorney’s fees, court costs, and other costs in connection with the\n      collection of the unpaid amounts. Any Late Charge that may become\n      applicable shall be due and payable on the last day of each month\n      when this provision becomes applicable.\n\nPX25, PX 26, PX27¶XVII(C). The Supreme Court held this language set an\n\ninterest rate of 18% for past due royalties, but “only” for past due royalties.\n\n      Plaintiffs assumed previously the late payment provision meant they would\n\nreceive 18% prejudgment interest compounded monthly as prejudgment interest.\n\nBut there is nothing in the late payment provision saying that. And there is nothing\n\nin the Supreme Court’s decision saying that either.\n\n      Typically, prejudgment interest is computed as simple interest. Johnson &\n\nHiggins of Texas, Inc. v.

You are the sole judges of the credibility of the\nwitnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, but in matters of law, you must be\ngoverned by the instructions in this charge. In discharging your responsibility on this jury, you\nwill observe all the instructions which have previously been given you. I shall now give you\nadditional instructions which you should carefully and strictly follow during your deliberations.\n\n       1. Do not let bias, prejudice or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n       2. In arriving at your answers, consider only Llie evidence introduced here under oath\n          and such exhibits, if any, as have been introduced for your consideration under the\n          rulings of the court, that is, what you have seen and heard in this courtroom, together\n          with the law as given you by the court. In your deliberations, you will not consider or\n          discuss anything that is not represented by the evidence in this case.\n\n       3. Since every answer that is required by the charge is important, no juror should state or\n          consider that any required answer is not important.\n\n       4. You must not decide who you think should win, and then try to answer the questions\n          accordingly. Simply answer the questions, and do not discuss nor concern yourselves\n          with the effect of your answers.\n\n       5. You will not decide the answer to a question by lot or by drawing straws, or by any\n          other method of chance. Do not return a quotient verdict. A quotient verdict means\n          that the jurors agree to abide by the result to be reached by adding together each\n          juror's figures and dividing by the number of jurors to get an average. Do not do any\n          trading on your answers; that is, one juror should not agree to answer a certain\n          question one way if others will agree to answer another question another way.\n\n       6. Unless otherwise instructed, you may answer a question upon the vote of ten or more\n          jurors. If you answer more than one question upon the vote of ten or more jurors, the\n          same group of at least ten of you must agree upon the answers to each of those\n          questions.\n\f       These instructions are given you because your conduct is subject to review the same as\nthat of the witnesses, parties, attorneys and the judge. If it should be found that you have\ndisregarded any of these instructions, it will be jury misconduct and it may require another trial\nby another jury; then all of our time will have been wasted.\n\n      The presiding juror or any other who observes a violation of the court's instructions shall\nimmediately warn the one who is violating the same and caution the juror not to do so again.\n\n       When words are used in this charge in a sense that varies from the meaning commonly\nunderstood, you are given a proper legal definition, which you are bound to accept in place of\nany other meaning.\n\n        Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to all questions unless otherwise instructed. A \"Yes\" answer must\nbe based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are otherwise instructed. If you do not\nfind that a preponderance of the evidence supports a \"Yes\" answer, then answer \"No.\" The term\n\"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight and degree of credible evidence\nadmitted in this case. Whenever a question requires an answer other than \"Yes\" or \"No,\" your\nanswer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are otherwise instructed.\n\fGeneral Instruction: Circumstantial Evidence\n\n        A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence, or both. A\nfact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or by witnesses\nwho saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established by circumstantial evidence\nwhen it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\nGeneral Instruction: Corporations\n\n        The defendant is a corporation. All persons are equal before the law, and a corporation is\nentitled to the same consideration you give any other person. Certain rules define how\ncorporations act and are held responsible for acts or omissions:\n\n       A corporation acts through its officer, agents, and employees. Unless otherwise indicated\n       in this charge, any act or omission of any officer, agent, or employee of any of the\n       defendants is the act or omission of that defendant if it occurred while acting within the\n       scope of his actual or apparent authority in the performance of his duties for that\n       defendant.\n\n       A corporation is held responsible for the knowledge possessed by those people who are\n       its representatives or agents acting within the scope of their actual or apparent authority.\n\nGeneral Instruction: Damages\n\nDamages, if any, must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty. This does not, however,\nrequire proof as to an absolute mathematical certainty. If a wrong has been done from which\nmonetary loss results, you may make a just and reasonable estimate of damages based on\nrelevant data, including opinion evidence, even if the extent of the injury cannot be proven\nprecisely. Damages cannot be remote or contingent.\n\nIn answering questions about damages, answer each question separately. Do not increase or\nreduce the amount in one answer because of the instructions in or your answers to any other\nquestions about damages. Do not speculate about what any party's ultimate recovery may or may\nnot be. Any recovery will be determined by the court when it applies the law to your answers at\nthe time of judgment.\n\fDEFINITIONS, QUESTIONS, AND SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\n     The \"Hooks\" means Plaintiffs Charles G.

The 60th\nDistrict Court, Jefferson County, Gary Sanderson, J., granted lessee partial summary judgment and entered a jury verdict in\nfavor of lessors on remaining claims.\n\n\n\nHoldings: On cross appeals, and on rehearing, the Court of Appeals, Evelyn V. Keyes, J., held that:\n\n[1] lessors' fraud claims concerning the pooling of interests accrued under discovery rule no later than date when information\nconcerning actual location of bottom hole of disputed well was a matter of public record;\n\n[2] lessors accepted and ratified the amendment and redesignation of original unit into pooled units;\n\n[3] the most favored nations clauses in leases did not apply to trigger royalties payable to the lessors equal to those payable\nunder settlement agreement reached between lessee and State;\n\n[4] formation production clause in leases did not operate to double the amount of royalties owed on the liquid condensate\nproduced from well;\n\n[5] trial court abused its discretion by including permanent injunctive relief in its order;\n\n[6] a stipulated payment of ad valorem taxes by lessee did not entitle lessors to claim attorney fees as prevailing parties under\na separate pre-trial fee stipulation; and\n\n[7] postjudgment interest on ad valorem taxes that lessee was obligated to pay pursuant to stipulation was to be calculated\nbased on statutory rate.\n\n\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The judgment arises from an oil\nand gas case in which the Hooks brought suit against Samson with respect to three oil and gas leases, two in Hardin County,\nTexas (the “95–acre Lease” and the “10–acre Lease,” collectively the “Hardin County Leases”) and one in Jefferson County,\nTexas (the “Jefferson County Lease”). The Hooks sued Samson for breach of contract, fraud, fraudulent concealment, statutory\nfraud, negligent misrepresentation, violation of the Texas Natural Resources Code by failure to properly pay royalties, statutory\nnegligence, common law negligence per se, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment.\n\nThe trial court granted Samson's motion for partial summary judgment on whether it had breached certain offset obligations\nunder the Leases. It also granted the Hooks' motions for summary judgment on claims for additional royalties related to their\nclaims of “unpooling” with respect to the Hardin County Leases and breach of the “most favored nations” clause in both Hardin\nCounty Leases and the Jefferson County Lease.\n\nThe questions of whether Samson committed fraud against the Hooks with respect to a well drilled within the buffer zone of the\nHooks' Jefferson County Lease *416 and whether it underpaid royalties by not paying royalties for “formation production”\nin all three Leases were tried to a jury. The trial court rendered judgment on the verdict, holding Samson liable to the Hooks\nfor fraud and underpaid royalties, and it entered a final judgment that left intact the summary judgment in Samson's favor on\noffset obligations and the summary judgments in favor of the Hooks on their unpooling claim and their most favored nations\nclause claims. Samson has appealed the final judgment, and the Hooks have cross-appealed.\n\nIn eight issues, Samson complains that (1) there is legally and factually insufficient evidence of common law fraud; (2) there\nis legally and factually insufficient evidence of statutory fraud; (3) the statute of limitations bars the Hooks' fraud claims; (4)\nthere is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding on fraud damages; (5) the trial court erred in\ninterpreting the phrase “formation production” in the Hooks' Leases as requiring Samson to pay twice for molecules of gas\nproduced as condensate; (6) the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the Hooks for additional royalties based on\nthe unpooling issue with respect to the Hardin County Leases and on the most favored nations clauses in all three Leases; (7)\nthe trial court erred in elevating lease provisions into a permanent injunction, and there is no evidence to support the injunction\nor attorney's fees; and (8) the trial court erred by granting post-judgment interest at the rate of 18%, compounded annually. 3\n\n3      This issue was added at Samson's request by order dated June 10, 2010, and both parties were required to and did file supplemental\n       briefs thereon.\nIn a single issue, the Hooks complain on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment in favor of\nSamson on the issue of whether Samson breached certain offset obligations in the Hooks' leases. We affirm the trial court's\nsummary judgment order in favor of Samson on its offset obligations.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

SAMSON'S APPEAL\n\n\n                                                          A. BACKGROUND\n\n1. The Hooks' Jefferson County Lease and the BSM No. 1 Unit\nIn 1999, the Hooks entered into the Jefferson County Lease with Samson. This lease covered 640 acres owned by the Hooks\nin the Dyches survey in Jefferson County, Texas and was bordered by Pine Island Bayou, which also serves as the county line\nbetween Jefferson and Hardin Counties.\n\nArticle VI of the Jefferson County Lease was a section called “Offset Obligations.” In this section, Samson covenanted to\noperate the leased premises as a reasonably prudent operator would and to protect the leased premises from drainage. Article\nVI also contained specific obligations for Samson in case of potential drainage. This Article provided that if a gas well were\ncompleted within 1,320 feet from the leased premises, then, within 90 days from the date of the sale of first production from that\nwell, Samson must take one of three actions: (1) drill an offset well; (2) pay the Hooks “compensatory royalties”—in addition\nto any royalties currently due—in a sum equal to the royalties that would be payable under the *417 Lease on the production\nfrom the adjacent or nearby producing well as if it had been producing on the leased premises; or (3) release the offset acreage. 4\nThe Jefferson County Lease did not provide for pooling.\n\n4      Article VI(A) of the Jefferson County Lease provided, in pertinent part, as follows:\n            [I]n the event a well producing from a unit not comprised of acreage from the leased premises ... which has been classified as\n            “gas” ... is completed on adjacent or nearby lands not more than one thousand three hundred and twenty feet (1,320′) from the\n            leased premises, or draining the leased premises, Lessee covenants and agrees to, within ninety (90) days from the date production\n            is first sold, removed or otherwise marketed from said adjacent or nearby producing well, either (1) commence with due diligence\n            operations for the actual drilling of an offset well on the leased premises to the base of the formation from which the adjacent\n            or nearby producing well is producing, (2) pay Lessors as compensatory royalty, in addition to any royalties currently due, a\n            sum equal to the royalties which would be payable under this lease on the production from said adjacent or nearby producing\n            well had same been producing on the leased premises, or (3) in lieu of drilling such offset well or paying such compensatory\n            royalty, release by recordable instrument the offset acreage, as hereinafter defined. “Offset Acreage,” as used hereinabove, shall\n            be defined as a unit which would surround such a well if same were completed on the leased premises; provided, however, that\n            if any portion of the offset acreage would be included in a producing unit designated by Lessee hereunder, then if Lessee elects\n            to surrender and release such offset acreage, it may retain and except from such release the producing stratum or strata included\n            in such producing unit, but such offset acreage must conform to the depth, size and shape limitations contained in Paragraph\n            V. herein. The provisions hereof shall apply regardless of whether lands upon which offset wells may be located are owned\n            by Lessor or any of them or not, and with regard to wells located within the hereinabove prescribed distances from the leased\n            premises, regardless of whether drainage is actually proved to be taking place or not. Notwithstanding anything herein to the\n            contrary, Lessee shall have no obligations under this Article VI in the event a producing well on nearby or adjacent land is\n            already offset by a well on the leased premises or on acreage pooled therewith producing from the same producing horizon from\n            which production has been secured from any well on nearby or adjacent lands.\nIn April 2000, Samson began drilling a gas well, the Black Stone Minerals No. 1 (the “BSM No. 1 well”), on a tract it owned\nin Hardin County adjacent to the Hooks' 640–acre Jefferson County Lease. This adjacent tract was located in Hardin County.\nThe surface drillsite was outside the 1,320–foot buffer zone around the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease that triggered Samson's\noffset obligations under Article VI(A) of the Lease. However, the well was a directional well that slanted away from the surface\ndrillsite. Originally, the BSM No. 1 well was planned with a bottom hole location 1,080 feet from the Hooks' lease line on\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nthe east, a location within the 1,320–foot buffer zone of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease. This proposed well location was\nreflected on a plat titled “Proposed Well Location [BSM No.]1 Walker Pettitt League, A–43, Hardin County, Texas,” which\nwas prepared and signed by a third-party surveyor on March 22, 2000. The surveyor certified that “this is a true and correct plat\nbased on a ground survey made under my supervision on March 22, 2000.” This plat was filed with the Railroad Commission\nof Texas (“Railroad Commission”).\n\nThe March 22, 2000 plat showed a 704–acre gas pooling unit (the “BSM No. 1 unit”) designated by Samson that ran along\nPine Island Bayou, the Hardin County/Jefferson County line, on the east. This line was also the western boundary of the tract\ncontaining the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease. The Hooks and their co-owners of the tract on which their Jefferson *418\nCounty Lease was located were not named as lessors in the table shown on the plat of the designated unit. An arrow shown on\nthe plat pointed to the location of the proposed bottom hole about at the beginning of a line that ran to the eastern line of the\nunit at Pine Island Bayou, the county line. Notations on the plat stated:\n\n  The Proposed Surface Location is:\n\n  630′ FSL x 1600′ FEL Survey\n\n  2750′± Scaled FWL x 3834′ FNL Unit.\n\n  The Proposed Bottom Hole Location is:\n\n  330′ FSL x 330′ FEL Survey\n\n  870′± Scaled FSL x 1080′± Scaled′ FEL Unit.\n\nIt is undisputed that “FSL” meant “From the Southern Line” of the Walker Pettitt Survey, “FNL” meant “From the Northern\nLine” of the Survey, and “FEL” meant “From the Eastern Line” of the Survey, which was the Hardin County/Jefferson County\nline at Pine Island Bayou. Thus, in this notation, the surface location of the BSM No. 1 well was 1,600 feet from the eastern line\nof the survey at Pine Island Bayou, and the proposed bottom hole location was about 1,080 feet from the eastern line, which\nmarked the western line of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease. The proposed bottom hole was therefore within the 1,320–foot\nbuffer zone for the Jefferson County Lease.\n\nAlthough the March 22, 2000 plat of the designated BSM No. 1 unit estimated the location of the proposed bottom hole location\nof the BSM No. 1 well, the exact bottom hole location of the well, following drilling, could only be ascertained from a directional\nsurvey. This survey was completed in July 2000 and was also filed with the Railroad Commission. Both parties agree that the\nsurvey showed the BSM No. 1 well to be bottomed 1,184 feet from the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease, within the 1,320–foot\nbuffer zone of the Lease. Thus, Samson had an obligation under the terms of the “Offset Obligations” in the Hooks' Jefferson\nCounty Lease to (1) drill an offset well, (2) pay the Hooks “compensatory royalties,” or (3) release the “offset acreage” within\n90 days from the date production was first “sold, removed, or otherwise marketed” from the well.\n\nThe BSM No. 1 well was completed in August 2000, and the first gas sales occurred in late October 2000. Because the bottom\nhole of the well was within the 1,320–foot buffer zone of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease, the first gas sales triggered\nSamson's offset obligations under the terms of the Lease. The Hooks complain, and the jury found, however, that Samson did\nnot follow the provisions in Article VI(A) of the Jefferson County Lease, which provided that, within 90 days of the first sale of\ngas from a well within its buffer zone, Samson must drill an offset well, pay the Hooks compensatory royalties, or release the\noffset acreage. Instead, the jury found that Samson attempted to avoid those obligations by seeking to pool the Hooks' interest\nin the production from the BSM No. 1 well with those of other mineral owners, despite the lack of pooling authority in the\nJefferson County Lease, while concealing the bottom hole location of the BSM No. 1 well.\n\nIn December 2000, Samson filed a P–12 “Pooling Authority” form with the Railroad Commission that reflected a reconfigured\nBSM No. 1 pooling unit. By letter, Samson informed the Commission that a portion of the 704 acres in the original BSM\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nNo. 1 unit was to be put into a separate 308.41–acre pooling unit for the proposed Black Stone Minerals No. A–1 well (the\n“BSM A–1 well”). Attached to the letter was a “Certificate of Pooling Authority,” which represented the Broussard tract, on\nwhich the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease lay, as one of the tracts whose mineral-rights owners either had *419 given Samson\npooling authority under an instrument currently in effect or had pooled their interests into the reconfigured BSM No. 1 unit.\nAlso attached was a plat of the redesignated704–acre pooling unit dated November 16, 2000 and certified by Samson's land\nman, Glenn Lanoue.\n\nThe arrows pointing to the surface and bottom hole locations on the November 16 plat of the redesignated BSM No. 1 unit were\nthe same as those pointing to the proposed surface and bottom hole locations on the original March 22, 2000 plat of the unit.\nHowever, the acreage of the unit had been changed to show a different 704–acre configuration for the BSM No. 1 unit from that\noriginally filed with the Railroad Commission. The redesignated BSM No. 1 unit, unlike the previously designated BSM No.\n1 unit, extended beyond the eastern line of Hardin County at Pine Island Bayou into Jefferson County. The certificate, signed\nby Lanoue, stated that “this is a true and correct plat based on the best of my knowledge November 16, 2000.”\n\nOn February 15, 2001, Samson sent the Hooks a letter offering to pool 50 acres covered by the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease\ninto there designated BSM No. 1 gas pooling unit for the BSM No. 1 well. Attached to the letter was a copy of the plat of the\nreconfigured unit Samson had filed with the Railroad Commission in December 2000.\n\nOn February 20, 2001, before accepting Samson's offer to pool—which would require amendment of Article VI of the Hooks'\nJefferson County Lease to permit pooling—Charles Hooks, the landowner and an attorney who had participated in a number\nof oil and gas deals, called Lanoue and sought more information. Charles Hooks inquired about the BSM No. 1 well's location\nand about how his property fit in the unit. Lanoue told him that the well was about 1,500 feet away from Pine Island Bayou,\nthe boundary between Hardin and Jefferson Counties and the western line of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease.\n\nHooks requested a plat showing where his acreage would lie within the proposed reconfigured BSM No. 1 unit. That same\nday, Lanoue sent Hooks the scaled plat of the redesignated BSM No. 1 pooling unit that Samson had filed with the Railroad\nCommission in December 2000. This plat was certified by Lanoue as “a true and correct plat based on the best of my knowledge\nDecember 28, 2000.” A number of changes had been made to the March 22, 2000 plat showing the original BSM No. 1 gas\npooling unit to reflect the redesignated unit. The plat of the reconfigured unit had different boundaries extending further west\nand also further east into Jefferson County, encompassing part of the Broussard tract on the east that had not been included in the\noriginal unit designation. The plat had been highlighted to show the location of the Hooks' 50 acres east of Pine Island Bayou.\n\nLike the March 2000 plat of the original BSM No. 1 unit, the plat of the redesignated BSM No. 1 unit contained the arrow\npointing to the location of the bottom hole, but it gave slightly changed coordinates from those of the proposed bottom hole\nof the BSM No. 1 well on the March 2000 plat. At trial, Lanoue testified that he changed these coordinates with a ruler. Also,\ninstead of a line running from the proposed bottom hole location and showing ±1,080 feet to the eastern line of the unit at Pine\nIsland Bayou, the plat showed a different line to the bayou with an undesignated starting point. The plat also showed an eastern\nborder of the reconfigured BSM No. 1 unit beyond the bayou and encompassing a portion of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease.\nAbove the line was the designation “±1400#.” An arrow stating *420 “BHL” and giving the well coordinates pointed to a\npoint on the line about one quarter of the way from the western starting point of the line to the eastern end of the line at the\nbayou. Thus, if the designation “±1400#” were interpreted as the distance from the bottom hole to the bayou, the bottom hole\nof the BSM No. 1 well would be outside the 1,320 foot buffer zone for the Jefferson County Lease. However, if the “±1400#”\ndesignation were interpreted as the distance from the undesignated starting point of the line to the bayou and the arrow one-\nquarter of the way along it were interpreted as the bottom hole location, the bottom hole of the well would be within the buffer\nzone of the Hooks' Lease, triggering Samson's offset obligations under Article VI(A) of the Jefferson County Lease.\n\nIn addition, the plat stated:\n\n  The Bottom Hole Location is:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

According to this notation, the bottom hole of the\nBSM No. 1 well was within 1,320 feet of the “leased premises,” and, therefore, inside the buffer zone for the Hooks' Jefferson\nCounty Lease\n\nLanoue testified at trial that he added the notation that showed the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well to be ±1,400 feet from the\neastern line of the unit in August 2000 to reflect the newly shaped unit. He also testified that he got the notation “740 feet from\nthe east line and 290 feet from the south line” “from myself.” He did not go to the directional survey which had been previously\ncompleted to determine the exact location of the bottom hole. However, he intended the numbers to be “[a]s accurate as a land\nguy is using a ruler on a scaled piece of paper that might not even be to scale.”\n\nHooks testified at trial, however, that Lanoue orally told him that the BSM No. 1 well was 1,500 feet from Pine Island Bayou.\nHe then looked at the plat and concluded that the bottom hole location was approximately 1,400 feet west of Pine Island Bayou\nand thus outside the line that would have triggered the 1,320 foot offset provisions in the Jefferson County Lease. He made\nno other inquiries regarding the plat or the bottom hole of the well, and he did not check the records filed with the Railroad\nCommission to determine the exact location of the bottom hole.\n\nAfter making the pooling offer to the Hooks, Lanoue executed the designation of the BSM No. 1 pooling unit in February 2001\nand recorded it in the county's real property records on March 7, 2001, showing the Hooks as participating in the pool for the\nBSM No. 1 unit. However, the Hooks did not actually consent to pool the 50 acres from their Jefferson County Lease into the\nBSM No. 1 unit until May 25, 2001, and they conditioned their assent on a formal amendment to the lease which they were\nto prepare and submit to Samson. The Hooks did not prepare the formal amendment, however, and the parties never executed\nsuch an amendment. Instead, the Hooks agreed to a division order setting out their percentage distribution of the unit's proceeds,\nwhich stated that Samson would pay the Hooks royalties based on a stated percentage of their acreage in the unit to the entire\nacreage of the BSM No. 1 unit unless notified otherwise in writing.\n\n *421 After the Hooks agreed to be included in the BSM No. 1 unit, Samson sent royalty checks to them for their unit interest\ncontinuing through the time of trial, and the Hooks cashed the royalty checks. However, the royalty checks did not include\nadditional compensatory royalties calculated under the terms of Article VI of the Hooks' Lease for a well drilled within the\n1,320–foot buffer zone of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease.\n\nAfter the Hooks agreed to pool 50 acres of their Jefferson County Lease into the BSM No. 1 unit, Samson drilled a second well,\nthe Joyce DuJay No. 1 well (“DuJay No. 1 well”), within the 1,320–foot buffer zone of the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease.\nThat well was completed in January 2002 and made part of another pooling unit, the DuJay No. 1 unit, in which the Hooks\nalso participated and from which they received royalties. This well was offset by the BSM No. 1 unit. Hooks testified that he\nwas not defrauded with respect to the DuJay No. 1 unit.\n\n\n2. The Hooks' Hardin County Leases, the BSM A–1 Well and Pooling Unit, and the Hooks' “Unpooling” Claim\nIn addition to their Jefferson County Lease, the Hooks also owned two leases in Hardin County near the BSM No. 1 well, the\n95–acre and 10–acre Hardin County Leases. Unlike the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease, these Leases did provide for pooling\nin terms that were essentially the same with respect to the manner and methods of pooling.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

For any well\n  drilled on and completed at depths beneath the surface of a tract covered by this lease there shall be no pooling with other\n  lands, unless such tract is insufficient, due to either its lack of size or prior unitization hereunder, to comprise the maximum\n  acreage figures permitted hereunder in which case all of said tract (95 acres more or less) or the then un-unitized portion of\n  same shall be so pooled; and Lessee may include in such pooled unit such other acreage as may be available to comprise the\n  maximum acreage figures permitted under the terms of this lease.

The mineral interests underlying this lease\nwere owned 87.5% by Black Stone Minerals and 12.5% by FirnBank as cotenants.\n\nSamson did not have the contractual authority to pool under its leases with either Black Stone Minerals or FirnBank. Samson\ntherefore negotiated with the leaseholders for such a right and concluded that both of the lessors were in agreement. *423\nAccordingly, on March 12, 2001, Samson filed a Unit Designation for a 704–acre unit called the Black Stone Minerals “A”\nNo. 1 Gas Unit (the “BSM A–1 unit”). The BSM A–1 unit designation unitized the Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank lease, as\nwell as the Hooks' 10–acre and 95–acre Hardin County Leases and other tracts, including leases beneath Pine Island Bayou\nowned by the State. The designation reflected that it was effective as of the date of first production, and it included a list of the\nleases pooled, including the Hooks' Hardin County Leases. The designation for the BSM A–1 unit included gas production at\nall depths between 6,000 and 13,800 feet, although the BSM A–1 well produced gas only from the shallow EY5 formation.\n\nFirnBank consented to be pooled into the BSM A–1 Unit in May 2001. Samson also obtained written consent from the Hooks\nto pool their Hardin County Leases into the BSM A–1 unit. In addition, it obtained the agreement of the Texas General Land\nOffice and the School Land Board (collectively, the “State of Texas”), who owned adjacent land, to pool that land into the\nunit. However, Black Stone Minerals, the 87.5% owner of the mineral interests underlying the drill site, declined to consent\nto the pooling unit.\n\nSamson drilled and completed the BSM A–1 well, and the well began producing in June 2001 from the depth range of the\nformation at the horizon from 12,304 to 12,332 feet. In December 2001, Samson finished another gas well, the DuJay No. 1\nwell. The DuJay No. 1 well produced from some of the same land designated to the BSM A–1 unit, but it reached from 13,150\nto 13,176 feet—a lower horizon than the BSM A–1 well. The DuJay No. 1 well began producing in January 2002.\n\nIn February 2002, after failing to receive Black Stone Minerals' consent to the BSM A–1 pooling unit, Samson amended the\nBSM A–1 unit designation. It executed and recorded a designation for a new unit, the Joyce DuJay No. 1 Gas unit (“DuJay No.\n1 unit”) that recited an effective date as of first production of the DuJay No. 1 well, i.e., January 2002. The DuJay No. 1 unit\ndesignated a new, smaller, 571–acre unit with a different name, different leases, different depths and different boundaries from\nthe BSM A–1 unit. The DuJay No. 1 unit included some of the deeper strata of the originally designated BSM A–1 unit, but it\nexcluded the EY5 horizon from which the BSM A–1 well was producing at 12,304 to 12,332 feet. Instead, the designated DuJay\nNo. 1 unit pooled its leases as to gas well production from 12,800 feet and deeper, including some already-pooled depths carved\nout of the BSM A–1 unit (12,400–13,800 feet) and deeper strata (below 13,800 feet). Because of its depth limitations, the DuJay\nNo. 1 unit included the DuJay No. 1 well, but not the shallower-completed BSM A–1 well. The designated acreage excluded\nmost of the Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank lease, but it included the Hooks' Hardin County Leases and the State's leases.\n\nSamson did not get consent from the Hooks to vacate or amend the BSM A–1 unit or to “unpool” their interests from the\nBSM A–1 unit or well. However, it informed the Hooks that the BSM A–1 unit had been amended and the unit name had\nbeen changed. It stated, “Please note that the Unit Designation for the Black Stone Minerals ‘A’ No. 1 is being amended and\nwill now be called the Joyce DuJay No. 1 unit. No additional action is needed on your part.” After the BSM A–1 unit was\namended, reconstituted, and renamed the DuJay No. 1 unit, Samson paid, and the Hooks accepted, royalty payments from\npooled production from the DuJay No. 1 well from the date of first production until *424 after commencement of trial in the\ninstant case. The BSM A–1 well was produced as a lease well on Samson's Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank leases and was not\nincluded in any unit. Samson did not pay the Hooks royalties on the BSM A–1 well, and the Hooks took no action to enforce\nany rights with respect to the original BSM A–1 unit.\n\nSubsequently, Samson drilled another DuJay well (the “DuJay A–1 well”) and created a separate pooling unit for that well. The\nDuJay A–1 unit differed from the DuJay No. 1 unit by depth limitation and acreage. The DuJay A–1 well began producing on\nSeptember 25, 2002. However, Samson did not file the DuJay A–1 unit designation until July 2003. The Hooks' Hardin County\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Hooks' Hardin County Leases and the “Most Favored Nation” Clause\nThe Hooks' Hardin County Leases also contained a “most favored nation” clause. This clause provided that, under certain\ncircumstances, the royalties payable to the Hooks must be elevated to match the highest royalty payable to Samson's other\nlessors.\n\n\n4. The Hooks' Leases and the “Formation Production Clause”\nArticle III(K) of each of the Hooks' Leases contained a “formation production clause.” Article III provided that the Hooks were\nto receive as royalties 25% of “the market value at the wells” on the “gas, including casinghead gas or other gaseous substances\nproduced from said land,” or 25% of “the price received therefor by Lessee.” Likewise, they were to receive as royalties 25%\nof “all liquid hydrocarbons that may be produced from said land.” Article III(K) provided, “For the purposes of calculating\nall royalties payable under Article III herein, it is expressly provided that all such calculations shall be based on formation\nproduction as reported on Texas Railroad Commission forms P–1 and P–2.”\n\n\n\n                                               B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n1. Trial Court Proceedings\nIn August 2004, several mineral-rights owners who had leased to Samson filed a suit against Samson styled Joyce DuJay Lee\nv. Samson Lone Star. The plaintiffs, who did not include the Hooks, complained about pooling issues unrelated to the BSM No.\n1 well. In December 2004, other landowners, also not including the Hooks, filed a second action, styled Thomas Klorer et al.\nv. Samson, complaining about the same issues. In August 2005, these two actions were consolidated.\n\nOn his birthday in November 2006, Charles Hooks, as an oil and gas attorney, attended a seminar for oil and gas attorneys.\nThere, he met an attorney who told him he was handling the Klorer and Lee cases against Samson.\n\nOn November 16, 2006, the Hooks were added to the consolidated suit in a Fifth Amended Petition. This petition alleged against\nSamson various breaches of contract and common law and statutory negligence related to the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease\nand their two Hardin County Leases. Among other things, the Hooks claimed that Samson had breached the Jefferson County\nLease by not paying compensatory royalties based on the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well being within 1,320 feet from their\nLease. The Hooks also claimed that Samson had improperly “unpooled” the BSM A–1 unit, and they sued to obtain all royalties\nthey would have received from that unit as if all *425 the lessors, including Black Stone Minerals, had agreed to pool, to be\nadded to the royalties they received from the DuJay No. 1 and DuJay A–1 units(the “unpooling claim”). The Hooks also asked\nfor a declaratory judgment regarding the construction of the “most favored nations” clauses in their Leases, which they argued\nwas triggered by a royalty paid to the State of Texas under a pooling agreement with Samson that was higher than the royalty\npaid to the Hooks under their pooling agreements. Finally, the Hooks sought the payment of royalties to them on “formation\nproduction” under the terms of all three Leases. The Hooks did not, however, plead any fraud claims at that time.\n\nThe Hooks added fraud, fraudulent inducement, and statutory fraud claims with respect to the Jefferson County Lease in a\nSixth Amended Petition, filed on May 7, 2007. The Hooks alleged in the alternative (1) that their Jefferson County Lease\nhad never been a part of the BSM No. 1 unit because no agreement to amend that Lease to allow pooling was entered, and,\ntherefore, they were entitled to damages under the Lease for the loss of their rights to require Samson either to drill an offset\nwell, pay them compensatory royalties, or release their acreage, and (2) that Samson had made false representations to them\nas to the configuration of the BSM No. 1 unit and the location of the BSM No. 1 well to induce them to agree to amend the\nJefferson County Lease to allow a portion of it to be pooled in the BSM No. 1 well and unit(the “offset obligations claim”).\nThey contended that Samson had falsely represented “that the [BSM No. 1] (gas) well was more than 1,320′ from the nearest\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nlease line of the Hooks Jefferson County Lease” so that its offset obligations were not triggered under the Lease. The Hooks\nclaimed that the representations were intended to save Samson from having to pay them the substantially greater compensatory\nroyalties that would have been payable under the terms of the Lease for infringement of the 1,320–foot buffer zone.\n\nIn September 2007, the trial court severed the consolidated action against Samson into three different actions, one of which\nwas the Hooks' action against Samson for fraud and breach of contract. 5\n\n5      The severed lawsuits are Klorer v. Samson Lone Star, No. B–173,008; Bordages v. Samson Lone Star, No. B–173,008–A; and Hooks\n       v. Samson Lone Star, No. B–173,008–B. Only Hooks has gone to trial. Klorer and Bordages remain pending.\nSubsequently, the Hooks moved for partial summary judgment on several of their claims based on the terms of their Leases.\nThe Hooks moved for summary judgment on the unpooling claim, claiming that Samson did not have authority to vacate the\nBSM A–1 unit into which their Hardin County Leases were pooled and that, therefore, Samson had breached its lease contract\nby failing to pay them royalties on the BSM A–1 well. The Hooks also moved for summary judgment on their most favored\nnation claim, formation production claim, and offset claims. They argued that Samson failed to pay them “royalties based on a\ngreater ‘Most Favored Nations' rate and compensatory royalties on certain offset encroaching wells.”\n\nSamson moved for partial summary judgment on the offset obligations provision, on the formation production claims, and on the\nmost favored nation claim. Samson also moved for summary judgment on the Hooks' unpooling claim on the basis of limitations.\n\nThe trial court granted the Hooks' motion for summary judgment and denied Samson's motion on the unpooling claim. It\nassessed damages of $766,626.85 against Samson on the Hooks' unpooling claim.\n\n *426 The trial court also granted the Hooks' summary judgment motion on their claim for breach of the most favored nations\nclause in their Hardin County Leases and awarded them $848,854.01 in damages.\n\nThe trial court granted Samson's motion for summary judgment for breach of the offset obligations provision in the Jefferson\nCounty Lease on limitations, and it denied the Hooks' corresponding motion. The trial court also disposed of some other contract\nclaims by other partial summary judgment motions.\n\nIn 2008, the case went to trial solely on the Hooks' fraud claims with respect to the Jefferson County Lease and their formation\nproduction claims. The fraud claims included the Hooks' claims that Samson's landman, Lanoue, had made misrepresentations\nto them to get them to allow Samson to add their 50 acres subject to the Jefferson County Lease to the BSM No. 1 pooling unit\nfor the BSM No. 1 well, which was within the 1,320–foot buffer zone for the Lease. The Hooks contended Samson made these\nmisrepresentations to avoid abiding by the terms of Article VI(A) of the Jefferson County Lease, which they contended would\nhave required Samson to drill an offset well, release their acreage, or pay them compensatory royalties, and, therefore, they\nwere entitled to damages. The Hooks also claimed that they were entitled to additional royalties under the formation production\nclauses in both their Jefferson County and their Hardin County Leases.\n\nThe jury answered “yes” to the questions of whether Samson committed fraud and statutory fraud with respect to the BSM No.\n1 well. It assessed damages against Samson for fraud in the amount of $20,081,638.07. The jury found that, in the exercise of\nreasonable diligence, the Hooks should have discovered Samson's fraud by Charles “Hook's Birthday April 2007.” It did not\nrespond, however, to the questions asking for a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the harm to the Hooks resulted\nfrom fraud or that Samson had actual awareness of the falsity of the representations or promise that the jury had found to be\nfraud. 6 Therefore, it did not award exemplary damages. The jury also did not respond to the question requesting it to “find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Samson secured execution by the Hooks of a document by deception” and that the property\nhad a value of $1,500 or more. 7\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Only eleven of the twelve jurors answered “yes” to Questions One and\n       Two; therefore, the jury properly refrained from answering Questions Four and Five.\n7      Question Seven, seeking a finding that Samson secured execution of a document by deception, instructed the jury to answer the\n       question only if it unanimously answered “yes” to Question Four or Five. Because the jury did not answer Question Four or Five,\n       it properly refrained from answering Question Seven.\nFinally, the jury found that Samson's failure to pay royalties based on formation production resulted in underpayment of royalties\non all three of the Hooks' Leases.\n\nThe trial court entered final judgment on the jury's verdict, awarding the Hooks $20,081,638.07 for damages proximately caused\nby Samson's fraud with respect to the BSM No. 1 well. The final judgment also reaffirmed and incorporated the trial court's\nprevious summary judgment rulings in favor of the Hooks. In addition to the fraud award, the judgment awarded *427 the\nHooks$766,626.85 in damages for the “unpooling” claim related to the BSM A–1 well, $848,854.01 in damages for breach of\nthe Leases' most favored nations clause, and $52,257.22 in damages related to ad valorem taxes. 8 Finally, the final judgment\nincluded an award of attorney's fees, expert witness fees, costs for copies of depositions, and pre- and post-judgment interest\nin favor of the Hooks.\n\n8      At trial, Samson stipulated that it owed the Hooks $52,257.22 for ad valorem taxes that the Hooks had paid through November 2007.\n       This stipulation and the amount of ad valorem taxes owed by Samson to the Hooks is not challenged on appeal.\n\n\n2. Claims on Appeal\nSamson has appealed the judgment on the trial verdict and the partial summary judgments entered against it, and the Hooks\nhave cross-appealed the partial summary judgments entered against them, all of which were incorporated in the final judgment.\n\nSamson contends on appeal that the trial court erred in entering judgment on the jury's finding that it committed fraud with\nrespect to the Hooks' Jefferson County Lease and that it withheld royalties on formation production with respect to all three\nof the Hooks' claims. It also contends that the trial court erred in granting the Hooks' motion for summary judgment on their\nunpooling claim with respect to the BSM A–1 well, in granting summary judgment on the Hooks' claim for royalties under the\nmost favored nations clause in their Jefferson and Hardin County Leases, and in denying its own motion for summary judgment\non those claims. Finally, Samson contends that the trial court erred by granting a permanent injunction in its final judgment\nrequiring Samson to fulfill certain contract provisions on pain of contempt of court, that it erred in awarding attorney's fees to\nthe Hooks, and that it erred in awarding the Hooks 18% post-judgment interest compounded annually.\n\nThe Hooks contend on cross-appeal that the trial court erred in ruling in Samson's favor on their claims that Samson breached\nthe offset obligations clause in the Hardin County Leases.\n\n\n\n                                                           C. DISCUSSION\n\n1. The Trial Court's Judgment on the Hooks' Fraud Claims with Respect to the Jefferson County Lease\nIn its third issue, Samson contends (1) that there is legally and factually insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that\nthe Hooks could not have discovered their fraud claims until April 2007 and (2) that the statute of limitations bars the Hooks'\nclaim for fraud, fraudulent inducement, and statutory fraud with respect to the Jefferson County Lease.\n\n [1] [2] To prove fraud, a plaintiff must show that the defendant made (1) a material misrepresentation (2) that was either\nknown to be false when made or was asserted without knowledge of its truth (3) which was intended to be relied upon (4)\nwhich was indeed relied upon and (5) which caused injury.

The Hooks also contended, and the jury found, that they did\nnot discover that the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well was within their 1,320–foot buffer zone, entitling them to additional\ncompensation royalties, until well within the limitations period as extended by application of the discovery rule. 9 Specifically,\nthe Hooks claimed that they relied on Charles Hooks' interpretation of the designation “±1400#” on the line on the plat of the\nredesignated unit drawn from an undesignated point to Pine Island Bayou as meaning that the bottom hole of the BSM No.\n1 well was about 1,400 feet, or more than 1,320 feet, from their Lease, and, therefore, outside the buffer zone. They did not\ninquire into seemingly contradictory information in that document showing an arrow pointing to the bottom hole of the BSM\nNo. 1 well about one-quarter of the way along the 1,400–foot line from an undesignated point to Pine Island Bayou, the western\nline of their Jefferson County Lease. Nor did they inquire into the notation that the bottom hole was about 1,400 feet “FEL\nunit,” i.e., from the eastern line of the reconfigured BSM No. 1 unit, which included 50 acres of their Jefferson County Lease.\nBoth of these notations would have indicated to them that the bottom hole of the BSM No. 1 well was clearly within the Lease's\n1,320–foot buffer zone. Similarly, the Hooks did not seek available records from either Samson or the Railroad Commission\nthat would have shown them the actual location of the BSM No. 1 well's bottom hole.\n\n9      Although the jury found that the Hooks' cause of action for fraud accrued on “Hooks' birthday April 2007,” the record shows that\n       Hooks' birthday was in November and that it was on his birthday in November 2006 that he attended the seminar for oil and gas\n       attorneys where he first heard about the other mineral-rights owners' suits against Samson.\nHad the Hooks exercised reasonable diligence, they should have known of the exact location of the bottom hole when the\ndirectional survey was filed with the Railroad Commission in July 2000. See Emerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 216; *429 Little,\n943 S.W.2d at 420. Charles Hooks was an oil and gas attorney and had participated in more than 100 oil and gas leases at\nthe time of trial, and he knew that Lanoue had certified the plat furnished to Hooks as being made on his own knowledge in\nDecember 2000, but he never sought to investigate the results of the directional survey filed with the Railroad Commission in\nJuly 2000, which showed the exact location of the bottom hole. Nor did the Hooks conduct due diligence in seeking the plat\nof the originally designated BSM No. 1 unit certified by the surveyor in March 2000, showing the proposed bottom hole of\nthe BSM No. 1 well, which was likewise filed with the Railroad Commission in July 2000. Both of these publicly available\ndocuments would have shown that the well was proposed to be and was bottomed within the 1,320–foot buffer zone of the\nJefferson County Lease, triggering Samson's obligations to them under Article VI(A) of that Lease.

The court concluded, “In these circumstances, it cannot be said that, as\na matter of law, Lesley knew or should have known of the mistake in her deed when she executed it.

This scenario is distinguishable from the present case.\n\n [9] When a cause of action accrues is normally a question of law. Emerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 202. Our analysis of when the\nHooks knew or should have known of facts that in the exercise of reasonable diligence would have led to the discovery of the\nalleged wrongful act demonstrates *430 that they should have known of the alleged fraud, as a matter of law, in February\n2001, more than six years before they filed suit. There is no disputed fact issue here regarding whether this information was\nplain enough to charge the Hooks with this knowledge—it is undisputed that this information was readily available in Samson's\nrecords and in the records filed with the Railroad Commission. Moreover, there was sufficient information available on the\nplat of the redesignated BSM No. 1 unit—namely the information that the bottom hole of the well was “±1400” feet from the\neastern line of the unit that encompassed their 50 acres—that should have put them on inquiry notice. Thus, the reasoning in\nLesley does not apply in this case.\n\nWe sustain Samson's third issue.\n\n\n2.

Thus, the amendment of the unit to exclude\nthe non-consenting drill site mineral owner, Black Stone Minerals, was justified. Samson further argues that, after the BSM A–\n1 unit was amended and renamed the DuJay No. 1 unit, the Hooks accepted royalty payments from production on both DuJay\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Moreover, it argues that the extent of the unit must be limited to FirnBank's 12.5% interest\nin the drill site tract because only FirnBank consented to pool its undivided interest in the gas produced from the BSM A–1 well.\n\nThe Hooks argue that the BSM A–1 unit was validly formed when FirnBank, the owner of a 12.5% undivided interest in the\nmineral rights to the drill site, consented to the unit and that this pooled unit could not be vacated or amended so long as gas\ncontinued to be produced from the BSM A–1 well. The Hooks agreed to the pooling of their Hardin County Leases in the BSM\nA–1 unit. Therefore, they argue, they are entitled to royalties from the BSM A–1 well in addition to the royalties they accepted\nfrom their participation in the DuJay No. 1 and DuJay A–1 pooling units.\n\n [10] [11] [12] [13] An oil and gas lease is a contract and is therefore interpreted as such.

Under that\nauthority, Samson obtained the Hooks' agreement to pool their interests with the undivided interests of the two drill site lessors,\nBlack Stone Minerals and FirnBank, in the BSM A–1 unit. One of the two drillsite lessors—FirnBank—consented to the BSM\nA–1 unit. In addition, Samson pooled other lands and its own working interests into that unit. However, Black Stone Minerals\nrefused to pool. Samson had no authority to pool Black Stone Minerals' interests without its express consent. See Tittizer, 171\nS.W.3d at 860; Tichacek, 997 S.W.2d at 170; Luecke, 38 S.W.3d at 634. But it did not lack authority to form a gas production\nunit that included the mineral interests of Black Stone Minerals's cotenant, FirnBank. See Ladd Petroleum Corp., 695 S.W.2d\nat 106; Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128.\n\nWe agree with the Hooks that the originally designated BSM A–1 unit was validly formed, creating a valid contract binding\nFirnBank, the cotenant making the agreement, and the Hooks. See Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128. Thus, the Hardin County Leases\nand FirnBank's undivided 12.5% interest in the acreage of the designated unit, as well as the leases of the other consenting\nlandowners, constituted a valid pooling unit. However, FirnBank pooled only its own undivided 12.5% interest in the production\nfrom the BSM A–1 unit. See id. at 129. The BSM A–1 unit that was created for the BSM A–1 well did not include the interest of\nBlack Stone Minerals, who had not consented to pool its undivided mineral interest in the drill site lease, as a lessor. See Tittizer,\n171 S.W.3d at 860; Tichacek, 997 S.W.2d at 170; Luecke, 38 S.W.3d at 634. Neither FirnBank nor the Hooks had the authority\nto bind Black Stone Minerals to their own agreement to pool. See Montgomery, 424 S.W.2d at 213; Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128.\n\n [25] While there was production from the original BSM A–1 unit, Samson had no *433 authority to dissolve that unit. See\nWilliamson, 737 S.W.2d at 921. Nevertheless, when Black Stone Minerals refused to pool, Samson treated the BSM A–1 well\nas continuing as an independent lease well on the Black Stone Minerals/FirnBank Lease that was not pooled in any unit. Samson\ndid not pay the Hooks royalties on the production from the BSM A–1 well, nor did the Hooks complain that they were not\nreceiving royalties. Instead, it amended and redesignated the pooling unit to exclude the BSM A–1 well and the EY5 formation\nfrom which it was producing, which Samson renamed the DuJay No. 1 unit.\n\nSamson pooled the Hooks' interests and those of the other interest holders in the originally designated BSM A–1 unit into\nboth the DuJay No. 1 unit and the DuJay A–1 unit, pursuant to its right under the Hardin County Leases to exercise pooling\nauthority multiple times, “at any time and from time to time....” Samson notified the Hooks, stating, “Please note that the Unit\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Although the\nnew DuJay No. 1 unit did not include the horizon from which the BSM A–1 well was producing, it did include deeper strata\nthat had been included in the original BSM A–1 unit, including the depths from which the DuJay No. 1 well was producing.\nSubsequently, Samson designated a second new gas production unit that overlapped with the original BSM A–1 unit, which it\nnamed the DuJay A–1 unit. The DuJay A–1 unit included different strata not included in the DuJay No. 1 unit.\n\nThe completion of a producing well, the BSM A–1, within the unit area set out in the unitization agreement served to continue\nthe leases granted to Samson by FirnBank, the Hooks, and the other landowners in full force and effect so long as any “unitized\nsubstance” continued to be produced from the BSM A–1 well, subject to unpooling through agreement of the lessors or through\ncessation of the production of unitized substance as provided in the habendum clause of the Hardin County Leases. See Ladd\nPetroleum Corp., 695 S.W.2d at 107; Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128. Therefore, Samson's redesignation of the BSM A–1 unit\nconstituted a breach of the Hardin County Leases by Samson, as did its failure to pay the Hooks royalties on the production\nfrom the BSM A–1 well unless the lessors agreed to the unpooling.\n\nThe Hooks took no action to assert any rights under the originally designated BSM A–1 unit in response to Samson's amendment\nand redesignation of the BSM A–1 unit as the DuJay No. 1 unit and its subsequent designation of the DuJay A–1 unit until they\nfiled suit for breach of contract against Samson in November 2006, more than four years from the date of first production and\nmore than four years from the date the BSM A–1 unit was amended and redesignated and the Hooks were notified. Instead, the\nHooks expressly agreed to accept the redesignation and terms of the new units, binding themselves to accept royalties pursuant\nto their pro rata share of the royalties from the DuJay No. 1 and DuJay A–1 units as calculated under the terms of the DuJay\nNo. 1 and DuJay A–1 unitization agreements, and they did accept royalties from the production of both DuJay units until the\ntime of trial in this case.\n\n *434 We conclude that, by accepting royalty checks from the amended and redesignated pooling units, the DuJay No. 1 and\nDuJay A–1 units, which they had been notified replaced the BSM A–1 unit, and by not asserting any rights to royalties from the\noriginal BSM A–1 unit or making any timely claim against Samson in regard to the amendment and redesignation of the BSM\nA–1 unit, the Hooks accepted and ratified the amendment and redesignation of the units.

The State, like FirnBank and the Hooks, originally consented to pooling to form the BSM\nA–1 unit. It declined, however, to consent to the subsequent DuJay No. 1 unit. In order to obtain the State's consent to pool its\nlease under Pine Island Bayou into the DuJay No. 1 unit, Samson entered into a pooling agreement wherein Samson became\nobligated to pay the State *435 a 28.28896% royalty on production from the DuJay No. 1 well, as opposed to the 25% it had\nbeen paying the State and was paying to the Hooks. The issue, therefore, is whether the pooling agreement executed by Samson\nand the State constitutes a “Third Party Lease,” i.e., an oil and gas lease located within three miles of any exterior boundary of\nany of the Hooks' Leases with a higher royalty than that provided for in the Hooks' Leases, so that Samson's obligation to pay\nthe Hooks increased royalties under the most favored nations clause in those leases was triggered.\n\n [27] [28] A most favored nations clause is “a vendor protection clause [that] enables the vendor to receive the benefit of\nincreases in the market price of his product over the term of a long range contract with a purchaser.” Lone Star Gas Co. v.\nHoward Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1793914\"><a href=\"/opinion/1793914/lone-star-gas-co-v-howard-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Such a clause is enforced according to\nits terms. See id. at 375–76.\n\nThe most favored nations clause in the Leases referred specifically to Samson's obligation to pay the Hooks royalty per acre\nequal to that payable under any Third Party “oil and gas lease(s) part of which is located within three (3) miles of any exterior\nboundary of the subject lands covered by [the Hooks'] Lease that Samson entered.” Here, however, Samson did not enter an\n“oil and gas lease” with the State that required it to pay higher royalties per acre than it was paying the Hooks under their\nLeases. It entered a settlement agreement, called a “Pooling Agreement,” that raised only the royalty payable to the State on\nproduction from the DuJay No. 1 unit.\n\nThe difference between the royalties payable to the State on production from the DuJay No. 1 unit and the royalties paid to\nthe Hooks did not represent a difference in the market price of gas at the time the pooling agreement was entered; nor did it\nrepresent a general increase in the royalty rate on the State's leases. It was an amount agreed upon by Samson and the State to\ninduce the State to accept the amended unit in place of the BSM A–1 unit and to compensate the State for its loss of royalties\nfrom the BSM A–1 well due to Samson's amendment and redesignation of the BSM A–1 unit as the DuJay No. 1, excluding\nthe BSM A–1 well formation.\n\nWe conclude that, under its plain terms, the most favored nations clause in the Hooks' Leases does not apply to trigger royalties\npayable to the Hooks equal to those payable under the settlement agreement reached between Samson and the State. Therefore,\nwe hold that the trial court erred in granting the Hooks' motion for summary judgment for damages under the most favored\nnations clause in the Hardin County Leases.\n\nWe sustain Samson's seventh issue.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Hooks' Claims Under the Formation Production Clause in the Jefferson and Hardin County Leases\n [29] In its fifth issue, Samson complains about the jury's finding, in response to Question Number 8, that Samson's failure to\npay royalty based on formation production resulted in underpayment of royalty under the Hooks' Jefferson and Hardin County\nLeases and the trial court's judgment awarding the Hooks damages based on the formation production clause in the Leases.\nSamson contends the issue was erroneously submitted to the jury because the construction of the contractual provision involved\nwas a question of law for the trial court; therefore, the jury's response to Question Number 8 is immaterial. Samson argues that,\nas a matter of law, the lease provision in question, properly *436 construed, does not require Samson to pay for formation\nproduction, as this would require it to pay twice for molecules of gas produced at the surface of the well as liquid condensate.\nIt also contends that there is legally and factually insufficient evidence that the Hooks' Leases required Samson to pay twice\nfor those molecules of gas. It states that, by giving effect to the jury's answer to Question Number 8, the trial court increased\nall the other categories of damages assessed against it.\n\nCondensate consists of “hydrocarbons that exist in the form of gas when contained in the natural gas reservoir underground,\nwhich condense into liquid form when released from the reservoir's higher pressure and temperature.” Bowden v. Phillips\nPetroleum Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894950\"><a href=\"/opinion/894950/bowden-v-phillips-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704 n. 7 (Tex.2008). When gas is produced, it goes through a mechanical separator through\nwhich condensate drops out as a liquid at the wellhead. The Railroad Commission has implemented a system by which producers\nreport the amount of gas in the reservoir before it is produced. This system requires producers to use a formula to calculate the\nvolume of reservoir gas produced at the surface as a liquid. “Formation production” is thus the calculation of the total amount\nof natural gas taken from the reservoir in whatever form it arrives at the surface, whether in the form of gas or in the form of\nliquid condensate. Formation production calculations allow the Railroad Commission to track the amount of gas coming out\nof the ground to avoid overproduction.\n\nArticle III of each of the Hooks' Leases contained several paragraphs specifying how royalties were to be paid. It reads in\npertinent part:\n\n  III ROYALTIES:\n\n  Lessors reserve for themselves ... the following royalties ...\n\n  ....\n\n      B. (1) On gas, including casing head gas or other gaseous substances produced from said land, Twenty–Five percent (25%)\n        of the market value at the wells of such gas, or Twenty–Five percent (25%) of the price received therefor by Lessee,\n        whichever is greater ...\n\n      D. An equal Twenty–Five percent (25%) part of all other liquid hydrocarbons that may be produced from said land ...\n\n  ....\n\n      K. For the purposes of calculating all royalties payable under Article III herein, it is expressly provided that all such\n        calculations shall be based on formation production as reported on Texas Railroad Commission forms P–1 and P–2.\n\nThe Hooks base their formation production argument on Article III(K). They contend that although this provision expressly\nrefers to the entirety of Article III, which covers payments for both liquids and gas, it requires that all calculations shall be\nbased on gas as it exists in the reservoir so that royalties must be paid on liquid condensate both as it is produced in liquid form\nand as it exists in gaseous form in the reservoir.\n\n [30] [31] [32] [33] The interpretation of the formation production provision in the Hooks' Leases is a matter of contract\nconstruction.

Frost Nat'l Bank, 165 S.W.3d at 312.\n\nArticle III of the Hooks' Leases, governing the payment of royalties, addresses a number of royalty payment issues. In each\ncase, it unambiguously states that Samson will pay 25% of the proceeds it receives, whether for gas or for liquids, as royalties\nto the Hooks unless the proceeds are below market value, in which case it must pay 25% of market value. In no place do the\nLeases state that, having paid royalties to the Hooks from the proceeds it receives on the sale of gas or liquid condensate,\nSamson must pay for the condensate a second time as it existed as gas in the reservoir. Article III does not state that Samson\nmust pay a 25% royalty on “formation production” in addition to royalty on gas and liquids as produced, and we decline to\nread that provision into the unambiguous language of the Lease.

We agree with Samson\nthat the unambiguous meaning of these lease provisions is that the Hooks are entitled to a 25% royalty on all gas and liquid\nhydrocarbons at the time proceeds are received from their sale.\n\nWe hold that, under its plain language, the formation production clause in Article III(K) of the Hooks' Jefferson County and\nHardin County Leases does not operate to double the amount of royalties owed on the liquid condensate produced from the well.\nTherefore, the trial court erred in awarding the Hooks damages calculated under the formation production clause in their Leases.\n\nWe sustain Samson's fifth issue.\n\n\n4. The Trial Court's Grant of a Permanent Injunction\nIn its eighth issue, Samson claims that the trial court erred by granting a permanent injunction in its judgment that requires it\nto fulfill certain contractual provisions upon pain of contempt of court. Samson claims that no evidence was presented of the\nelements necessary for a permanent injunction.\n\nThe first item of injunctive relief requires Samson to pay the Hooks royalty on production from the BSM A–1 well commencing\nwith production after May 2008. The fourth item states that Samson shall be liable for all ad valorem taxes on the Hooks'\ninterests in the oil and gas leases at issue after November 2007, as long as those leases are in effect. The fifth item requires\nSamson to provide the Hooks with certain notices and information “as required by the oil and gas leases in this case while\nthose leases are in effect.”\n\n [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] A permanent injunction is proper only when there is evidence of four elements: (1) a\nwrongful act; (2) imminent harm; (3) irreparable injury, and (4) no adequate remedy at law.

Nor have they shown that they have no adequate remedy at law\nfor their grievances. Moreover, at least three of the items of injunctive relief decree future contractual performance, which is\nforbidden by Cytogenix. Id. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by including injunctive relief\nin its order (1) in the absence of any evidence of the elements of a permanent injunction and (2) when the injunctive relief\ndecrees future contractual performance.\n\nWe sustain Samson's fifth issue.\n\n\n5. Attorney's Fees and Post judgment Interest Rate\n [43] In its eighth issue, Samson complains about the grant of attorney's fees in the final judgment. The parties stipulated that the\nHooks' right to collect attorney's fees was contingent on the Hooks prevailing at trial and on appeal. During trial, the parties also\nstipulated that Samson owed the Hooks $52,257.22 related to ad valorem taxes. Although Samson asked this Court to reverse the\ntrial court's judgment “in its entirety,” the parties do not challenge the agreement as to Samson's payment of ad valorem taxes.\nHowever, the Hooks argue on rehearing that Samson's stipulation regarding ad valorem taxes means that the Hooks prevailed\non a claim, and, thus, they are entitled to stipulated attorney's fees under the terms of a separate pre-trial fee stipulation.\n\nThe pre-trial fee stipulation provided that the stipulated attorney's fees “are owed to [the Hooks] by [Samson] if [the Hooks]\nprevail on any of their claims.” The agreement then provided specific exceptions for claims not relevant here. The parties made\na separate stipulation during trial that addressed the issue of the ad valorem taxes.\n\n [44] [45] An “agreement between the parties will not be given greater effect than intended,” and “[a] stipulation will not be\nconstrued as an admission of a fact intended to be controverted.” Austin v. Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1624504\"><a href=\"/opinion/1624504/austin-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207 (Tex.1980). Nothing\nin the ad valorem tax stipulation indicated that it was intended to constitute an admission that the Hooks had prevailed on that\nissue. Thus, the stipulated payment of ad valorem taxes does not entitle the Hooks to claim attorney's fees. See id. Because we\nhave reversed the portions of the judgment in favor of the Hooks on which they could claim to be prevailing parties, and upon\nwhich their right to attorney's fees is contingent, we conclude that the Hooks are not entitled to attorney's fees.\n\nWe sustain Samson's eighth issue.\n\n [46] Additionally, in two sentences in its appellate brief, Samson claimed that *439 “[i]t was error to award post judgment\ninterest of 18% compounded annually. Instead, the post judgment interest should be at the same rate as a proper prejudgment\ninterest rate.” We asked for and received supplemental briefing from both parties on this issue. The supplemental issue, as\nphrased by Samson, is as follows: “Should the post judgment interest rate be 5% as set by Texas Finance Code § 304.003,\nrather than the rate of 18% as stated in the Final Judgment?” In its supplemental briefing and in its motion for rehearing filed\non March 16, 2012, the Hooks argue that post judgment interest should be awarded at the “maximum allowed by law (per the\nleases).” However, the agreement under which Samson is obligated to pay the ad valorem taxes, the only recovery to which\nthe Hooks are entitled, is the stipulation entered by the parties during trial, not the leases. The ad valorem tax stipulation does\nnot provide an interest rate.\n\n [47] [48] When the interest rate is not specified in a contract, post judgment interest should be calculated based on the\nstatutory rate provided in Texas Finance Code section 304.003. See TEX. FIN.CODE ANN. § 304.003 (Vernon 2006) (providing\njudgment interest rate when interest rate or time price differential is not in contract). Section 304.003(b) provides that, “[o]n\nthe 15th day of each month, the consumer credit commissioner shall determine the post judgment interest rate to be applied to\na money judgment rendered during the succeeding calendar month.” Id. § 304.003(b). Section 304.003(c) provides that, with\nexceptions not applicable here, “[t]he post judgment interest rate is ... the prime rate as published by the Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System on the date of computation” or “five percent a year if the prime rate ... described by Subdivision (1)\nis less than five percent.” Id. § 304.003(c)(l )-(2).

THE HOOKS' CROSS–APPEAL\n\nBefore trial, the Hooks and Samson filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether Samson breached the\n *440 offset obligations in the Hardin County Leases. The trial court granted Samson's motion and denied the Hooks' motion\non this issue without stating its reasons.\n\nThe Hooks filed a cross-appeal claiming, in one issue, that the trial court erred in granting Samson's motion for summary\njudgment and denying their own. The Hooks include in this issue sub-issues regarding the correct interpretation of Samson's\noffset obligations under the Jefferson County and Hardin County Leases, an exception in the Leases for pre-existing wells, and\nthe statute of limitations.\n\nSamson contends that the Hooks have waived their appeal of the summary judgments by failing to preserve it. It further argues\nthat the trial court correctly interpreted the Hardin County Leases with respect to the issues raised by the Hooks on cross-appeal\nand correctly rendered summary judgment holding that the Hooks' offset claims are contract claims that are barred by limitations.\n\n\n\n                                                A.

If the Lease had allowed pooling, Samson could have solved the problem by pooling the lands\ncovered by the Lease with the adjacent lands. The Lease, however, did not allow pooling.\n\nSamson's solution to this problem was to begin misrepresenting various “facts” to escape the consequences of its actions. Its\nlandman, Lanoue, filed papers with the Railroad Commission falsely certifying that Samson had pooling authority from the\nHooks. He later filed paperwork in the county's real property records falsely indicating that the Hooks had already agreed to\npool. Lanoue then sent a letter to the Hooks asking them to agree to pool the westernmost 50 acres of the Hooks' acreage in\nthe Lease into the BSM 1 Unit. When Charles Hooks called Lanoue and asked for more information about the well's location,\nLanoue represented to Hooks that the well was located approximately 1500 feet from the lease line, a location outside the\nbuffer zone. When Charles Hooks asked for a plat, Lanoue faxed him one that represented a bottom-hole location that was\n+/–1400 feet from the lease line, the accuracy of which he, Lanoue, had certified with no reference to an actual bottom-hole\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Instead, when asked the origin of those measurements,\nhe answered: “I got them from myself.” On this basis the Hooks agreed to the formation of the unit.\n\nThus it is clear that Samson, through its representative, took action to cover up its own error by both oral and written\nmisrepresentations to its lessor, born of “assuming” and “hoping.” It is further clear that the Hooks, after asking for and receiving\nverification of Lanoue's oral representation in the form of a plat, believed its lessee's representations and made no attempt to go\nbeyond them to discover the truth or falsity thereof. On these facts, the majority has found that the discovery rule does not apply\nto the Hooks' fraud, fraudulent inducement, and statutory fraud claims and that they are barred by limitations as a matter of law.\n\nI reluctantly concur, based on the Texas Supreme Court's holding in BP America Production Co. v. Marshall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895321\"><a href=\"/opinion/895321/bp-america-production-co-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tex.2011). In that case, the Texas Supreme Court makes clear that no lies on the part of a lessee, however self-serving and\negregious, are sufficient to toll limitations, as long as it is technically possible for the lessor to have discovered the lie by resort\nto the Railroad Commission records. This burden the Court imposes upon lessors is severe. It is now a lessor's duty to presume\nthat any statement made by its lessee is false and to ransack the esoteric and oft-changing records at the Railroad Commission\nto discover the truth or falsity of its lessee's statements. If, as is often the case, these records are technical in nature and require\nexpert review to ferret out the truth, it is the lessor's job to hire experts out of its own pocket to perform *442 such a review.\nIf a lessor fails to take these steps, then it will have failed in exercising reasonable diligence to protect its mineral interests and,\nif the lessee's fraud is successful for longer than the limitations period, the lessor's claims will be barred by limitations.\n\nSuch is the case here. Had the Hooks presumed that Samson's oral representations, followed by written representations, about\nthe bottom-hole location of the well were false, and had they hired an expert to resort to Railroad Commission records to\ntrace the various filings (some of which were also false), that expert could have hit upon the directional survey and, by virtue\nof his expertise, interpreted it to prove the falsity of the representations. Instead they merely relied on the oral and written\nrepresentations of their lessee, without undergoing what doubtless seemed to them the useless expense of hiring an expert to\nrake through the Railroad Commission records with an eye towards exposing a potential falsehood.\n\nI believe the Texas Supreme Court has placed an unnecessary and very heavy burden on lessors by its ruling in BP America,\none that will result either in much money being spent unnecessarily on prophylactic forensic review of Railroad Commission\nrecords or in many viable claims being lost to limitations. As we are, however, bound to follow the Court's rulings, I reluctantly\nconcur in that part of the opinion that finds the Hooks' fraud, fraudulent inducement, and statutory fraud claims barred by\nlimitations as a matter of law.\n\nI dissent, however, to that part of the majority's opinion that sustains Samson's challenge to the trial court's findings concerning\n“unpooling” by amending a unit.\n\nEarly in 2001, Samson drilled the Black Stone Minerals No. A–1 well (“BSM A-l Well”) on a separate Samson lease. The\nmineral interests underlying this lease were owned 87.5% by Black Stone Minerals and 12.5% by FirnBank.\n\nBecause Samson was without contractual authority to pool pursuant to its leases with either Black Stone or FirnBank, it sought\nto negotiate with them for such a right. Before such agreement, if any, was reached, however, Samson unilaterally concluded\nthat both of the lessors were in agreement. Pursuant to this unilateral conclusion, in March 2001, Samson filed a unit designation\nfor a 704–acre unit called the Black Stone Minerals “A” No. 1 Gas Unit (the “BSM A-l Unit”), which unitized the above-\ndescribed leases as well as the Hooks' Hardin County leases (the “Hardin County Leases”). The designation recited that it was\neffective as of the date of first production. Firnbank consented to the pooling in May 2001. Written consent to pool was also\nobtained from the Hooks. The 87.5% interest owner, Black Stone Minerals, however, declined to consent.\n\nSamson drilled and completed the BSM A–1 Well and it began producing in June 2001 from the depth range of the BSM A–\n1 Unit as designated by Samson. In December 2001, Samson finished another gas well (“Joyce DuJay No. 1 Well”) from the\nsurface of the BSM A–1 Unit that was completed within the area and depth limits of the BSM A–1 Unit. In February 2002,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                38\n\fSamson Lone Star, Ltd. Partnership v. Hooks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nSamson executed and recorded a designation for a Joyce DuJay No. 1 Gas Unit (“DuJay 1 Unit”) that recited an effective date\nas of first production of the DuJay No. 1 Well. Although termed an “Amendment” of the BSM A–1 Unit, it designated a new,\nsmaller, 570–acre unit with a different name, different leases, different depths and different boundaries than the BSM A–1\nUnit. The DuJay 1 Unit included some of the deeper strata of the BSM A–1 Unit, but excluded the horizon from which the\nBSM A–1 Well was producing. Thereafter, the BSM A–1 Well was produced as a *443 lease well, not included in any unit.\nSubsequently, Samson drilled another DuJay well (“DuJay A–1”) and created a separate unit for that well (the “DuJay A–1\nUnit”). The DuJay A–1 Unit differed from the DuJay 1 Unit by depth limitation and acreage. The Hooks' Hardin County Leases\nwere listed in all three unit designations: the BSM A–1, the DuJay 1, and the DuJay A–1.\n\nSamson claimed that the DuJay 1 Unit was an “amendment” of the BSM A–1 and thus that the BSM A–1 Unit no longer\nexisted. In other words, it took the position that, because it failed to sign up all the other leaseholders in the BSM A–1 Unit, it\ncould “de-designate” the earlier-designated BSM A–1 Unit. If Samson was correct, it did not need to pay the Hooks for their\nproportionate share of the BSM A–1 Well; if not, it did.\n\nThe Hooks moved for summary judgment claiming that Samson had no authority to terminate or invalidate the BSM A–1\nUnit and therefore had breached its lease contract by failing to pay the Hooks royalties on the BSM A–1 Well. The trial court\ngranted this motion. Samson, in its sixth point, contends that the trial court erred in granting this motion (and in denying its\nown cross-motion).\n\nThe majority opinion holds that, by accepting royalties from the DuJay 1 and DuJay A–1 Units, the Hooks “accepted” those\nunits and thus, “[t]heir interest in the BSM A–1 unit was, therefore, terminated, and they are estopped to deny the validity of\nthe unitization agreements for the DuJay 1 and DuJay A–1 as to their interest therein.” The majority bases this decision on its\nconclusion that “a previously designated unit necessarily terminates upon the agreement of all the parties to the agreement to\nparticipate in a unit that is incompatible with the prior unit; and the parties who have consented to a new unitization of the same\ninterests are estopped to deny termination of the prior inconsistent unit designation.” The majority posits that accepting royalties\nfrom a unit the depth or acreage of which overlaps at all with any other unit amounts to a de facto agreement to terminate any\nearlier unit containing any part of the same depth or acreage.\n\nThe Hardin County Leases, however, contain no such limitations. Instead, the Hardin County Leases give Samson the right to\nexercise pooling authority multiple times, “at any time and from time to time.” The language of the leases neither limits this\npooling authority to certain depths, nor states or implies that pooling is only valid when the multiple pools do not overlap at\nany depth. To hold instead that the right to pool multiple times is limited to units that have no overlap is to imply a term in\nthe contract that does not exist. A court is not free to make contracts for parties, nor must it imply terms in a contract without\nexercising extreme caution. See Universal Health Servs., Inc. RCW v. Renaissance Women's Group, P.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894484\"><a href=\"/opinion/894484/universal-health-v-renaissance-womens/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 747\n(Tex.2003). The Texas Supreme Court has held that “terms are to be implied in contract, not because they are reasonable, but\nbecause they are necessarily involved in the contractual relationship, such that the parties must have intended them and must\nhave failed to express them only because of sheer inadvertence or because they are too obvious to need expression.” Mann\nFrankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v.

The rule set up by the majority is not one that is “necessarily involved” in the contractual\nrelationship between a lessor and lessee and we ought not imply it.\n\n *444 If such a limitation to the right to accept royalties from multiple pools exists, then, it must exist as a matter of law. The\nmajority, however, cites no law for the proposition that accepting royalties from more than one unit covering some of the same\ndepths and lands (termed “conflicting” units in the majority opinion) serves to terminate an earlier-designated unit.\n\nInstead, it is black-letter law that a lessee cannot unilaterally terminate a unit, once formed.

The only basis for finding that the\nBSM A–1 Unit was no longer valid is the majority's holding that, by accepting royalty on “conflicting” pooled units, the Hooks\naccepted those units and thus their interest in the BSM A–1 Unit terminated and they are estopped to deny the validity of\nthe unitization agreements for the DuJay 1 and DuJay A–1 as to their interests.

None, however, actually supports the majority's position. Cambridge holds that a top-lessee, the rights of which derive\nfrom its underlying lessors, is estopped from taking the position that a unit is terminated when its underlying lessors had taken an\ninconsistent position by accepting royalties from the unit. Cambridge, 292 S.W.3d at 732. Ladd holds that “an unpooling could\nonly come about through an agreement of the lessors, or through a cessation of production as provided for in the habendum\nclauses.” Ladd, 695 S.W.2d at 107. In Whelan, the Texarkana court found that parties that have accepted royalty pursuant to a\nunitization agreement are estopped from denying the validity of the unitization agreement. Whelan, 274 S.W.2d at 128.\n\nAll of these cases are distinguishable from the case at bar and none set up the rule that the majority asserts. The Hooks do not\ndeny that they have “consented” to the DuJay 1 Unit. Instead, their position is that each of the units (the BSM A–1 Unit, the\nDuJay 1 Unit and the DuJay A–1 Unit) is independent of the other, and all could and did exist at the same time. Samson did\nnot exhaust its right to pool by designating the BSM A–1 Unit, so its later DuJay 1 and DuJay A–1 Units were also valid. This\nposition is consistent with the language of the pooling clause itself, which states that “[t]he above right and power to pool may\nbe exercised at any time and from time to time.”\n\nThe majority's ruling creates a new limitation on pooling, one found neither in the *445 language of the Hardin County Leases\nnor in case law, and one which has serious ramifications for the oil and gas industry. I believe that this limitation is legally\nunsupported, unnecessary, and detrimental to the legitimate interests of both lessors and lessees.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, I dissent to the portion of the majority's opinion sustaining Samson's sixth issue.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177 Oil & Gas Rep. 542\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

A jury determined that the mineral owner, in\nthe exercise of reasonable diligence, discovered the fraud less than four years before filing suit, and the trial court accordingly\nconcluded that the claims were not barred by limitations. The jury also found fraud and damages in the mineral owner's favor,\nand the trial court rendered judgment on the jury's verdict. The court of appeals, however, reversed most aspects of the mineral\nowner's judgment, concluding that the fraud should have been discovered, as a matter of law, more than four years before the\nmineral owner filed suit because the relevant information was available in the Texas Railroad Commission's public records.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429–30, 439–40 (Tex.App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2012).\n\nWhile we agree that public records may under certain circumstances establish a lack of diligence in the discovery of fraud as a\nmatter of law, here the records themselves were tainted by fraud and thus provide no conclusive proof on the subject. Because\nwe conclude that the mineral owner's diligence in discovering the underlying fraud was in this instance a question of fact for\nthe jury, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment on this and other issues in part, affirm its judgment on other issues in part,\nand remand the cause to the court of appeals for review of a factual sufficiency of the evidence complaint and other issues not\nconsidered because of the court's ruling on limitations.\n\n\n\n                                              I. Background and Procedural History\n\nCharles G. Hooks III (“Hooks”) 1 sued Samson Lone Star Limited Partnership, now known as Samson Lone Star, LLC\n(“Samson”), in 2006, 2 alleging, among other things, breach of contract and failure to pay royalties under Texas Natural\nResources Code section 91.404. Later amendments to Hooks' petition included allegations of fraud, fraudulent inducement, and\nstatutory fraud. These claims centered on three oil and gas leases that Hooks, the lessor, executed with Samson, the lessee, in\n1999. Two leases were in Hardin County, Texas (the “Hardin County Leases”), and one was in Jefferson County, Texas (the\n“Jefferson County Lease”).\n\n1      The plaintiffs consist of multiple parties. We refer to them collectively as “Hooks.” Specifically, the parties are Charles G. Hooks\n       III, acting individually and as independent executor of the estate of Charles G. Hooks, Jr., as Trustee of the Scott Ira McKeever Trust\n       and the David Wayne McKeever Trust, and on behalf of Chas. G. Hooks & Son, a General Partnership; McKeever Partnership, Ltd.;\n       and Charles G. Hooks III and Sue Ann Hooks, as co-trustees under the will of Charles G. Hooks, Sr.\n2      Hooks joined a preexisting lawsuit brought by various lessors against Samson. Hooks' suit was later severed from the other claims.\nThis appeal from a final judgment involves seven claims raised by Hooks. First, Hooks alleges that Samson fraudulently induced\nHooks to amend the Jefferson County Lease to allow for pooling. Second, Hooks asserts that Samson breached the most-\nfavored-nations clause in all three leases, failing to pay Hooks the same higher royalty that it paid to a nearby lessor. Third,\nHooks contends that Samson breached the formation-production clause in each lease by calculating gas royalties based on\nproceeds instead of the volume of gas leaving the reservoir. Fourth, Hooks claims that Samson wrongly “unpooled” a unit into\nwhich the two Hardin County Leases were pooled, and seeks damages for royalties allegedly owed from this unit. Fifth, Hooks\nalleges that *56 Samson breached certain offset provisions in the two Hardin County Leases. Sixth, pursuant to a pretrial\nstipulation, Hooks contends that Samson must reimburse Hooks for attorney's fees. And seventh, Hooks asserts that the proper\npost-judgment interest rate is 18%, rather than 5% as decided by the court of appeals.\n\nHooks prevailed on the majority of his claims in the trial court. The trial court granted summary judgment for Hooks on the most-\nfavored-nations clause claims and “unpooling” claims, but granted summary judgment for Samson regarding Hooks' allegations\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The jury returned a verdict for Hooks on the fraud\nand formation-production claims. The trial court's final judgment awarded Hooks more than $21 million in damages, ordered\nSamson to pay the stipulated attorney's fees, and applied a post-judgment interest rate of 18%. The court of appeals, however,\nreversed, holding that Hooks take nothing except for $52,257.22, a stipulated amount to reimburse Hooks for payment of ad\nvalorem taxes. Id. at 440–41.\n\n\n\n                                                       II. Fraud and Limitations\n\nHooks' fraud claims relate to the Jefferson County Lease. This lease, which prohibited pooling, contained “offset obligations”\nproviding that if a gas well were completed within 1,320 feet of Hooks' lease line but was not unitized with Hooks' acreage,\nthen Samson would either drill an offset well, pay Hooks compensatory royalties, or release the offset acreage. In 2000, Samson\ndrilled a well that bottomed about 1,186 feet from Hooks' lease, within the 1,320–foot protected zone. But, instead of complying\nwith the original offset obligations, Samson asked Hooks to amend the Jefferson County Lease in 2001 to pool into a unit\nassociated with the new well. In connection with this request, Samson provided Hooks with a plat that incorrectly placed the\nwell's bottom hole outside of the protected zone. A plat with the same false information had already been filed with the Railroad\nCommission. Older Railroad Commission records, however, contained a directional survey and an attached plat 3 that correctly\nplaced the bottom hole within the 1,320–foot boundary. 4 Other preliminary Railroad Commission filings demonstrated that\nSamson originally intended the well to bottom within 1,320 feet of Hooks' lease.\n\n3      The parties dispute whether, based on the record in this case, the plat was attached to the directional survey in the Railroad Commission\n       filing. This does not affect our holding, and we assume without deciding that it was attached.\n4      Although the plat correctly placed the bottom hole within the protected zone, some data on the plat does not completely correspond\n       to data on a later correct plat.\nHooks brought his fraud claims in 2007, alleging that Samson deprived Hooks of compensatory royalties by misrepresenting the\nwell's bottom-hole location and fraudulently inducing Hooks to amend the lease and pool. A jury found that Samson committed\nfraud and statutory fraud, awarding more than $20 million in damages on these claims, and the trial court rendered judgment\non the jury's verdict.

Consequently, cases discussing fraudulent concealment are relevant to the meaning of\n       reasonable diligence.\nIn Shell Oil Co. v. Ross, we considered untimely claims made by Ross—an attorney who “understood the oil and gas industry”—\nand his family that Shell had underpaid gas royalties. 356 S.W.3d at 926. Despite Shell's allegedly fraudulent representations,\nthe Rosses had a duty to “make themselves aware of relevant information available in the public record.” Id. at 928. We held that\n“[d]iligence is required when claimants have been ‘put on notice of the alleged harm of injury-causing actions.’ ” Id. (quoting\nEmerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 207). 10 Discrepancies in royalties paid to the Rosses on different wells put them on notice. Id. at\n929. A publicly available price index illuminated the underpayments, *59 as did General Land Office records demonstrating\nthat Shell paid higher royalties to the State even though it owed the Rosses the same royalty. Id. Had the Rosses exercised\nreasonable diligence, this “[r]eadily accessible and publicly available information” would have revealed the underpayments.\nId. Accordingly, as a matter of law, they did not exercise reasonable diligence.\n\n10     Samson and Hooks dispute whether parties must be put on notice of potential harm before they have a duty to exercise reasonable\n       diligence, as well as whether Hooks was on notice. We need not reach these questions here. Instead, we decide the case by assuming,\n       without deciding, that Hooks should exercise reasonable diligence.\nIn BP America Production Co. v. Marshall, we held that the statute of limitations was not tolled when BP fraudulently\nrepresented that it was maintaining continuous operations on a lease. 342 S.W.3d at 67–69. This case also involved a\nsophisticated plaintiff who “understood the oil and gas industry.” Id. at 69. The public record contained two public filings with\nthe Railroad Commission: a well log and a plugging report that contained “highly technical information.” Id. at 66. Had the\nMarshalls read these two documents together, they would have discovered that BP was not conducting good-faith continuous\noperations. Id. at 69. “[A]s a matter of law, the Marshalls would have been able to discover BP's fraud th[r]ough the use of\nreasonable diligence.” Id.\n\nWe have reached similar conclusions in other cases. For example, if the plaintiff has “actual knowledge ... of injury-causing\nconduct,” then this “starts the clock on the limitations period” “[i]rrespective of the potential effect of fraudulent concealment.”\nEmerald Oil, 348 S.W.3d at 209. The availability of court records may indicate under some circumstances that reasonable\ndiligence would have found the information. See Kerlin, 263 S.W.3d at 926. Land title records and probate proceedings create\nconstructive notice, “an irrebuttable presumption of actual notice,” which prevents limitations from being delayed. Mooney\nv.

These cases reveal\nthat when there is actual or constructive notice, or when information is “readily accessible and publicly available,” Ross, 356\nS.W.3d at 929, then, as a matter of law, the accrual of a fraud claim is not delayed.\n\n [7] The present case does not fall into any of the categories where we can determine, as a matter of law, that reasonable\ndiligence would have timely uncovered the fraud. Though Samson relies extensively on Marshall and Ross, Hooks correctly\nidentifies an important distinction: in those cases, the public record itself was not tainted by the fraud. We have not previously\nconsidered whether reasonable diligence would uncover a correct public Railroad Commission filing when more recent filings\ncontain false information.\n\nIn December 2000, Samson submitted a plat to the Railroad Commission as part of an application to pool. The plat was signed\nby Glenn Lanoue, Samson's landman, and dated November 16, 2000, certifying that it was “a true and correct plat based on\nthe best of my knowledge.” The plat had a label stating “Proposed Well Location,” but, unlike some earlier plats in the record,\nthe individual data on this plat were not themselves also marked as “proposed.” The plat gave “X” and “Y” coordinates for\nthe well's bottom-hole location, the distance of the well from various survey lines, and the well's surface location along with\nthe bottom hole's location relative to the surface. Trial testimony established that this data is internally consistent, placing the\nwell's bottom hole more than 1,320 feet from Hooks' lease line even though the well actually bottomed within the 1,320–foot\nprotected zone. When Lanoue was asked where he obtained the bottom hole's distance from the survey *60 lines, he testified\nthat he created them himself. 11\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Samson argues the plat was ambiguous and indefinite, creating a need for Hooks, an experienced oil and gas\nlessor, to investigate further. On the plat is the notation “1400' ± scaled,” but trial testimony presented different interpretations\nof what points this distance measured between. Elsewhere, the plat expressly states that the bottom-hole location is “1400' ±\nscaled' FEL Unit.” Testimony indicated that “FEL” means “from the eastern line” of the pooled unit. Another testified that\ntaking the notation literally would be unreasonable because if the well truly bottomed about 1,400 feet from the eastern line of\nthe unit, as opposed to Hooks' lease line, it would be very close to Hooks' lease, perhaps even within it.\n\nMonths earlier, a directional survey performed by an independent surveyor and an accompanying plat were filed with the\nRailroad Commission. Some information on the directional survey clearly contradicts the Lanoue plat discussed above, and\nSamson urges that the information on the survey could have easily been used to estimate the bottom hole's true location. Hooks\nargues that it would take an expert to interpret the survey and pinpoint its location.\n\nWe cannot say that, as a matter of law, Hooks should have discovered the accurate information when the more recent filing\nfalsely conveyed that the well had been completed outside the protected zone. Although reasonable diligence should examine\nreadily available information in the public record, it may stop at more recent filings with the Railroad Commission, without\nneeding to double-check more recent filings against earlier filings. This accords with our prior decisions. We have held that\n“fraud vitiates whatever it touches,” Borderlon, 661 S.W.2d at 909, in this case, the public record. We have held that not all\nRailroad Commission records create constructive notice, HECI Exploration Co., 982 S.W.2d at 886, meaning that, in some\ncircumstances, Railroad Commission filings may exist that one is not charged with discovering. We have held that fraudulent\nconcealment is “an equitable doctrine that ... is fact-specific.” Marshall, 342 S.W.3d at 67. And we have held that “a person\ncannot be permitted to avoid liability for his actions by deceitfully concealing wrongdoing until limitations has run.” S.V., 933\nS.W.2d at 6. Though reasonable diligence should lead to information in the public record, here, the fraudulent information itself\ntaints the public record. To require, as a matter of law, that Hooks double-check the more recent filings against earlier filings\nis a higher burden than reasonable diligence requires.\n\nSamson argues that the directional survey is the “gold standard,” and that the fraudulent plat was filed to show unit lines for\npooling purposes, not to provide the exact location of the well's bottom hole. Samson observes that, in some situations, Texas\nlaw mandates directional surveys performed by independent surveyors, see 16 TEX. ADMIN. CODE §§ 3.11(c)(2)(A); 3.12\n(Tex.R.R. Comm'n), and asserts that Hooks should have known this and looked for the survey to establish the bottom hole's true\nlocation. Samson also argues that because Lanoue told Hooks the well was about 1,500 feet from the lease line, but then sent\nHooks a plat indicating the bottom hole was about 1,400 feet away, very close to the protected zone, these *61 inconsistencies\nshould have caused Hooks to inquire further. None of these arguments avail. Had Hooks gone to the Railroad Commission,\nthe more recent filing would have been a plat with the same inaccurate information, placing the well's bottom hole beyond the\nprotected zone. Hooks is not required, as a matter of law, to double-check it against the earlier directional survey. To the extent\nsome information on the Lanoue plat is unclear, a careful reader could have examined other information on the plat (e.g., the\n“X” and “Y” coordinates, distances from lease lines, and location of the bottom hole relative to the surface) to resolve any\nambiguity, determining that the plat placed the bottom hole outside the protected zone. Indeed, Hooks presented testimony that\nthis plat clearly placed the bottom hole outside of the protected zone. Thus, though Samson's arguments regarding potential\nambiguities on the plat, and the availability and superiority of the directional survey, may be appropriate for the factfinder to\nconsider when determining whether reasonable diligence would have uncovered the fraud, they do not establish that, as a matter\nof law, Hooks did not exercise reasonable diligence.\n\nAmicus Texas Oil and Gas Association suggests that holding for Hooks will encourage litigants to guise their breach-of-contract\nclaims as fraud claims to avoid the statute of limitations. We disagree. To establish fraudulent inducement, “the elements of\nfraud must be established as they relate to an agreement between the parties.” Haase, 62 S.W.3d at 798–99. Many breach-of-\ncontract cases do not implicate the elements of fraud. Only when fraud is established with regard to the contract may fraudulent\ninducement be established, and, in any case, the suit is based on the fraud itself rather than a breach of contract.

These include the factual and legal sufficiency of the evidence with regard to common-law fraud,\nstatutory fraud, and damages for fraud, as well as the factual sufficiency of the evidence regarding when Hooks, by the exercise\nof reasonable diligence, would have discovered the fraud.

Breach of Most–Favored–Nations Clause Claims\n\n [8] When an oil and gas lease contains a most-favored-nations clause, it typically provides that a lessee who pays higher\nroyalties on nearby leases must pay matching royalties to the lessor under the subject lease. Here, all three leases contain an\nidentical most-favored-nations clause, providing that\n\n              *62 If Lessee shall enter into an oil and gas lease(s) part of which is located within three (3) miles\n             of any exterior boundary of the subject lands covered by the subject Lease, hereinafter referred to as\n             “Third Party Lease”, Lessee shall notify Lessor of such fact. If the reserved royalty or the amount per\n             acre payable for delay rentals, shut-in rentals or minimum royalty, at any time payable under such Third\n             Party Lease, is higher than the like royalty and amounts payable as provided in the subject Lease, the\n             royalty or amount payable per acre in the subject lease, which is less than that provided in the Third Party\n             Lease shall be immediately increased so that it will equal the royalty or other amounts payable under the\n             Third Party Lease. The subject Lease and the Third Party Lease must be calculated in substantially the\n             same manner, such that the comparison of the subject Lease and the Third Party Lease is based on the\n             same effective net royalty or other payments, and that same shall include or deduct the same types of\n             charges, taxes and other burdens from such interests.\n\nThe trial court determined on summary judgment that Samson breached the clause by paying a higher royalty to the State of\nTexas.\n\nSamson leased a qualifying oil and gas interest from the State at the same 25% royalty Samson paid Hooks. In 2003, to induce\nthe State to consent to a Pooling Agreement, Samson increased the State's royalty. This Pooling Agreement allocates production\namong different interest owners based on their individual shares in their own tracts and the proportion that their tracts play in\nthe overall unit. This general allocation is made “provided that the state [']s unit royalty interest shall be 0.7969%.” Considering\nthe size of the State's tract relative to the size of the entire unit, this is equivalent to a royalty of 28.28896% on the production\nallocated to the State's tract. In other words, the State's royalty of 0.7969% on production from the unit equates to a 28.28896%\nroyalty on production allocated to the State's tract.\n\nSamson argues that the most-favored-nations clause does not apply because the clause regards the “reserved royalty ... payable\nunder” another lease, whereas Samson paid the State higher royalties under the Pooling Agreement. If the clause were to apply\nto more than just leases, then it would have said so, Samson argues. Samson also asserts that the Pooling Agreement increased\nthe State's allocation of production from the unit without raising the royalty.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

And the reason the lessor receives royalties\non production attributed to the lessor's tract is because of the underlying lease. It follows that a lessor's royalty on production\nfrom the unit as a whole reflects the lessor's royalty on production from its individual tracts in proportion to the size of the\ntracts relative to the overall unit. This accords with the nature of pooling, which “effects a cross-conveyance among the owners\nof minerals under the various tracts of royalty or minerals in a *63 pool so that they all own undivided interests under the\nunitized tract in the proportion their contribution bears to the unitized tract.” Montgomery v.

In other words, the royalty owed on production from the whole unit is necessarily tied to the royalty owed on\nproduction from the lessor's individual tracts. To increase one is to increase the other.\n\nThus, by definition, Samson's grant of a royalty to the State of 0.7969% on production from the unit means that Samson increased\nthe State's 25% royalty on production from its tract to 28.28896%. For purposes of the most-favored-nations clause, the royalty\nimposed by the Pooling Agreement is “payable under” the lease, and the Pooling Agreement itself states that it was entered\ninto by the State “as Lessor” and Samson “as Lessee.”\n\nThe court of appeals here defined a most-favored-nations clause as “a vendor protection clause” that “enables the vendor to\nreceive the benefit of increases in the market price of his product over the term of a long range contract with a purchaser.” 389\nS.W.3d at 435 (quoting Lone Star Gas Co. v.

Though this may be the purpose of such clauses, unless they\nexpressly so provide, we are not authorized to examine whether increased prices were caused by market forces or, as seems to\nbe the case here, other considerations. The reason for giving the State a higher royalty—inducing it to pool—is irrelevant in\ndetermining whether the most-favored-nations clause applies.\n\nFor all these reasons, we conclude that the court of appeals erred in holding that Samson did not breach the most-favored-\nnations clause.\n\n\n\n                                    IV.

As used on the old Railroad Commission forms P–1 and P–2, 12 formation production describes\nthe total volume of gas removed from the underground reservoir. Not all gas, however, that leaves the reservoir as gas continues\nto be a gas at the surface; instead, some condenses. “Condensate is hydrocarbons that exist in the form of gas when contained\nin the natural gas reservoir underground, which condense into a liquid form when released from the reservoir's higher pressure\nand temperature.” Bowden v.

When reporting the total volume\nof gas removed from the reservoir to the Railroad Commission, Samson would convert the volume of condensate at the surface\nto its equivalent volume as a gas.\n\n12     These forms, referred to by the leases, are no longer used by the Railroad Commission. Instead, Form PR has replaced them.\n       According to the instructions accompanying Form PR, “[f]or gas well gas, you no longer need to convert the condensate production\n       to a gas equivalent volume; the RRC will automatically convert the volume.” TEX. R.R. COMM'N, INSTRUCTIONS FORM P R:\n       MONTHLY PRODUCTION REPORT, available at http:// www.rrc.texas.gov/media/2646/formpr–instructions–final–02–2005.pdf.\n       This opinion need not—and does not—interpret “formation production” as used by the new form.\nHooks argues that because all royalties must be based on formation production, and formation production is the volume of all\nproduction while it existed in the reservoir as gas, then the 25% royalty paid on gas should be for the volume of gas removed\nfrom the reservoir instead of the volume of gas at the surface. Notably, however, Hooks contends that Samson must still pay a\n25% royalty on the volume of condensate taken from the wellhead. In other words, Hooks asserts that the formation-production\nclause requires that a 25% royalty be paid on the liquid condensate, which must then be converted to its equivalent in gas\nvolume so that another 25% royalty may be paid on it again. Samson responds that Hooks' interpretation unreasonably imposes\na double royalty by requiring Samson to pay royalties on condensate twice: first as condensate, and then again as a gas as part\nof formation production. Samson submits that the formation-production clause means Samson must pay for produced minerals,\neither as gas or as condensate, but not that Samson must pay royalties on condensate twice.\n\nThe formation-production clause provides that all royalty calculations be based on formation production. Hooks' approach,\nhowever, causes only gas royalties (for gas as gas and for condensate as gas) to be based on formation production. For royalties\non condensate as condensate, Hooks' approach bases them solely on the amount of condensate without reference to formation\nproduction. We disagree with that interpretation.\n\nThe formation-production clause simply requires Samson to convert the volume of condensate to its equivalent volume in\ngas, ensuring that the total volume that Samson pays royalties on relates to the volume that Samson reports to the Railroad\nCommission. The conversion ensures that Samson pays royalties on an appropriate volume of production, not that Samson pays\nroyalties on some production twice. In other words, the clause does not require that royalties be paid on everything as gas.\nOtherwise, the instruction that all royalties be based on formation production would be ignored, because royalties would be\npaid on condensate without reference to formation *65 production. This interpretation of the clause, unlike Hooks', allows\nroyalties on condensate (as well as on gas) to be based on formation production, as the leases require.\n\nHooks also argues that Samson failed to pay royalties on gas that was not ultimately sold, such as lost or consumed gas. Hooks\npoints to the testimony of a Samson employee that Samson pays royalties based on dollars received rather than on formation\nproduction. But Hooks presented no evidence of the royalties that should have been paid on the unsold gas; Hooks merely\naggregates this amount (if any) with the royalties that Hooks claims are owed on condensate when converted back to gas. Absent\nspecific evidence of damages for lost and used gas—as opposed to a combined amount for lost and used gas and condensate as\npart of formation production—Hooks cannot prevail, and thus we need not determine whether Samson breached the contract by\nfailing to pay royalties on lost and used gas. In sum, we agree with the court of appeals' decision with regard to the formation-\nproduction claims.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Samson pooled both of Hooks' Hardin County Leases into the\n“Blackstone Minerals ‘A’ No. 1” unit, effective as of the date of first production in June 2001. Because the owner of 87.5%\nof the mineral interest in the tract where the well in this unit was located refused to pool, Samson decided to “amend” the unit\ndesignation. A letter from Samson dated October 24, 2001, notified Hooks of an “Amendment and Name Change of Black\nStone Minerals ‘A’ No. 1 Unit Designation, Hardin County, Texas”:\n\n  Reference is made to Samson Lone Star Limited Partnership's letter dated March 20, 2001, in which approval to pool on\n  640–acre plus 10% tolerance was received. Please note that the Unit Designation for the Black Stone Minerals “A” No. 1 is\n  being amended and will now be called the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit.\n\n  No additional action is needed on your part, this letter is meant for informational purposes only. Please update your records\n  with the new name and call the undersigned should you have any questions.\n\nThe amended unit was effective in January 2002, when production began.\n\nAs filed in the Hardin County records, the amendment did not merely change the name of the existing unit but also significantly\naltered its boundaries. Whereas the original unit extended from a depth of 6,000 feet to a depth of 13,800 feet, the new Joyce\nDu Jay No. 1 Unit, beginning at 12,400 feet below surface, extends down without limit. Samson has paid Hooks royalties on\nproduction from the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit, but not from the original Blackstone Minerals A–1 Unit. Accordingly, Hooks\nseeks royalties on the original unit, claiming that Samson did not have the authority to “unpool” the Blackstone Minerals A–\n1 Unit. The trial court agreed, granting summary judgment in Hooks' favor. Samson responds—and the court of appeals held\n—that Hooks ratified the new unit by accepting royalties on it, and therefore cannot recover from the old unit. 389 S.W.3d at\n434. Samson also asserts that if Hooks is entitled to royalties from the original unit, then these should be offset by the royalties\nHooks has already received on the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit.\n\nNotably, Hooks does not question the validity of the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit; rather, Hooks alleges that he should receive\nroyalties from both the original unit *66 and the Joyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit. Hooks notes that the Hardin County Leases allowed\nunlimited pooling. Although Samson claimed it was “amending” the original unit, Hooks suggests that the change effectively\nadded another unit without eliminating the original one.\n\nFactually, Hooks' position is problematic. Samson's letter to Hooks made clear that it purported to “amend” the unit designation,\nnot merely create an additional unit. The letter stated that it concerned an “amendment and name change,” (emphasis added),\nso Hooks should have been aware that the pooled area could change. The original designation and the amended designation,\nas well as their differences, were a matter of public record. Though Hooks did not know exactly how Samson amended the\nunit designation, Hooks was nevertheless aware that Samson amended it, and Hooks regularly accepted royalty checks for the\nJoyce Du Jay No. 1 Unit without ever receiving royalties on the earlier designation. Under these circumstances, Hooks cannot\nclaim additional royalties from the older unit because Hooks ratified the amendment, having full knowledge that something\nhad changed and by his actions consenting to it, failing even to challenge the new unit.

Breach of Hardin County Offset Provision Claims\n\nLike the Jefferson County Lease, the two Hardin County Leases also contain offset provisions requiring that if a well is\ncompleted within 1,320 feet of Hooks' lease line but is not unitized with Hooks' acreage, then within ninety days of production\nfrom the infringing well, Samson must either drill an offset well, pay Hooks compensatory royalties, or release the offset acreage.\nUnder these offset provisions, if Samson elects to pay compensatory royalties, then it has a recurring monthly obligation to pay\nthem. The first compensatory royalty would be due “following the expiration of ninety (90) days after the end *67 of said\ncalendar month in which production [is] first marketed.”\n\nThe Hardin County Leases allow pooling and also contain what the parties have termed an “entire-acreage clause”:\n\n            Operations for drilling on or production of gas from any part of the pooled unit which includes all or a\n            portion of the Leased Premises ... shall be considered as operations for drilling on or production of gas\n            from the Leased Premises, ... and the entire acreage constituting such unit or units shall be treated for\n            all purposes, except the payment of royalties on production from the pooled unit, as if the same were\n            included in this Lease.\n\n\nSamson pooled the Hardin County Leases and drilled additional gas wells within 1,320 feet of the pooled units but more than\n1,320 feet from Hooks' individual tracts. Hooks argues that the entire-acreage clause extended the 1,320–foot protected zone\naround the units themselves, and that Samson breached by disregarding the offset provisions. In the trial court, Samson moved\nfor summary judgment on this claim on several grounds, including limitations, which the trial court granted. The court of appeals\naffirmed because of limitations. 389 S.W.3d at 440.\n\n [20] Before analyzing the issue of limitations, we first consider Samson's argument that Hooks waived his claims for breach of\nthe offset provisions by filing a proposed judgment with the trial court. In Hooks' motion for judgment, he averred that he moved\nfor judgment “without waiving any rights to contest or appeal prior orders of the Court.” And, the statement “APPROVED AS\nTO FORM” was above Hooks' attorney's signature on the proposed judgment. Samson asserts that these reservations did not\npreserve Hooks' right to appeal, invoking Litton Industrial Products, Inc. v. Gammage, where we “disapprove [d] a practice by\nwhich a party, by motion, induces the trial court on the one hand to render a judgment, but reserves in a brief the right for the\nmovant to attack the judgment if the court grants the motion.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2389036\"><a href=\"/opinion/2389036/litton-indus-products-inc-v-gammage/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322 (Tex.1984). Importantly, Litton Industrial\nProducts applies only to arguments inconsistent with the specifics of the requested judgment. See id.\n\nIn contrast, when the argument asserted on appeal is not inconsistent with the judgment, the argument is not waived. See\nDiamond Shamrock Ref. Co. v.

CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODEE § 16.004. Hooks responds that compensatory damages\nunder the offset provisions are owed monthly, Samson's breach is recurring, and Hooks can recover damages for royalties that\nshould have been paid during the four years preceding the filing of suit. See, e.g., Lyle v. Jane Guinn Revocable Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355 (Tex.App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied). Samson denies that the breach, if any, has been recurring.\nSpecifically, Samson argues that the offset provisions authorized *68 Samson to elect to release the offset acreage or drill an\noffset well or pay compensatory royalties. Samson contends that it is not bound by the recurring provision when it could have\nopted for a non-recurring one, and damages for breach of a non-recurring provision are barred by limitations.\n\n [21] It is true that, “if the terms of an agreement call for periodic payments during the course of the contract, a cause of action\nfor such payments may arise at the end of each period.” Intermedics, Inc. v. Grady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755678/intermedics-inc-v-grady/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 845 (Tex.App.–Houston\n[1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.). 14 The question remains whether, because the contract gave Samson alternatives that were\nnot recurring, Samson may prevent Hooks from suing based on the one recurring obligation. Samson cites a Fifth Circuit case\nholding that when a party refuses to make an election under an alternative contract, the choice does not devolve to the other\nparty. See Liberty Bank v. Talman Home Mortg. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524998\"><a href=\"/opinion/524998/liberty-bank-and-its-successor-in-interest-the-federal-deposit-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 407 (5th Cir.1989). The Fifth Circuit held that when the\n“breaching party had the option of choosing between two alternatives at the time of breach, ‘the measure of damages is the\nloss caused by reason of the promisor failing to perform the promise with the lesser value.’ ” Id. (quoting Stewart v. Cran–\nVela Rental Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"325256\"><a href=\"/opinion/325256/marvin-e-stewart-v-cran-vela-rental-co-inc-third-party-shell-oil/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 986 (5th Cir.1975)). Although Samson has not presented evidence of alternative measures of\ndamages, it presumably argues that limitations reduces the alternative damages to zero. Hooks responds by citing a decision\nfrom 1849, Hemming v. Zimmerschitte, where this Court observed that there “does not appear on the record, as presented, a\nmanifestation of willingness on the part of the obligor to discharge his obligation; and the right of election, if applicable at all,\nis lost and cannot avail the defendant.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164 (1849).

The Hardin County\nLeases required Samson to begin drilling an offset well or release the acreage within ninety days of production from the\ninfringing well. But Samson must pay compensatory royalties slightly later—“on or before the first day of the calendar month\nnext following the expiration of ninety (90) days after the end of said calendar month in which production [is] first marketed.”\nAssuming that Samson breached, then by waiting without performing the first two alternatives, Samson impliedly elected to\nperform the later one, the only choice remaining after the first ninety days had passed. If Samson breached the offset provisions,\nthen Samson's failure to timely elect an alternative creates an implied election of the recurring compensatory royalty payments.\nAccordingly, if Samson did indeed breach, then Hooks is entitled to damages for royalties owed within four years of filing suit.\nThis accords with the nature of damages: providing “just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained.” Stewart v.\nBasey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1507983\"><a href=\"/opinion/1507983/stewart-v-basey/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486 (1952). When the law would allow compensation under a recurring alternative (i.e.,\ncompensatory royalties) but not under a non-recurring alternative, it would not be just to allow the obligor's silent, continuous\nbreach to constitute an election of the non-recurring alternative.\n\n *69 The court of appeals held for Samson on limitations and did not reach the merits of Hooks' claim for breach of the offset\nprovisions and the proper construction of the entire-acreage clause. See 389 S.W.3d at 440. Because limitations does not apply\nto the compensatory royalties that may have been owed within the four years preceding suit, we remand for the court of appeals\nto consider the merits of Hooks' claims.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Attorney's Fees Claims\n\nThe parties stipulated that if Hooks “prevail[ed] on any of [his] claims” (with exceptions not applicable here), Samson would\nreimburse Hooks for a stipulated amount of attorney's fees. Because Hooks prevailed on several claims in the trial court, the trial\ncourt granted Hooks these attorney's fees. The court of appeals, however, held that Hooks take nothing except for $52,257.22,\na stipulated amount to reimburse Hooks for ad valorem taxes that the leases required Samson to pay. Id. at 438. It also held that\nreimbursement for the ad valorem taxes did not constitute “prevail[ing] on [a] claim[ ]” as contemplated by the stipulation. Id.\nAccordingly, the court of appeals did not require Samson to pay attorney's fees. Id.\n\nWe need not decide whether the ad valorem taxes trigger Samson's obligation to pay attorney's fees under the stipulation.\nRather, under our decision today, Hooks prevails on another claim such that he is entitled to the stipulated amount of fees. 15\nWe reverse the court of appeals on this point.\n\n15     At the least, Hooks prevails on his claims under the most-favored-nations clause. Other claims, such as fraud and breach of the Hardin\n       County offset provisions, are remanded to the court of appeals for further consideration.\n\n\n\n                                                     VIII. Interest Rate Claims\n\n [23] Hooks seeks, and the trial court granted, a post-judgment interest rate of 18%. Each lease provides that “past due\nroyalties ... shall be subject to a Late Charge based on the amount due and calculated at the maximum rate allowed by law.”\nBecause the court of appeals reversed all of Hooks' damages except for compensation for ad valorem taxes, it reduced the\ninterest rate to 5%. Id. at 439.\n\nThe Texas Finance Code provides for a maximum post-judgment interest rate of 18% on contract claims:\n\n             A money judgment of a court of this state on a contract that provides for interest or time price differential\n             earns post-judgment interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (1) the rate specified in the contract, which\n             may be a variable rate; or (2) 18 percent a year.\n\nTEX. FIN. CODE § 304.002. But, if the contract does not specify the interest rate, then the rate is determined under section\n304.003 of the Finance Code. Under section 304.003(c), the post-judgment interest rate is “the prime rate as published by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the date of computation,” not to exceed 15% a year or fall below 5% a\nyear. Id. § 304.003(c). “On the 15th day of each month, the consumer credit commissioner shall determine the post-judgment\ninterest rate to be applied to a money judgment rendered during the succeeding calendar month.” Id. § 304.003(b). Here, the\ntrial court's final judgment was rendered in December 2008, and the judgment interest rate according to the consumer credit\ncommissioner was five percent. 16\n\n16     See OFFICE OF THE CONSUMER CREDIT COMM'R, JUDGMENT RATE SUMMARY , available at http://\n       www.occc.state.tx.us/pages/int_ rates/Judgment% 20Rate% 20Summaries/ Thru% 202014% 20Judgment% 20Rate%\n       20Summary.pdf.\nThe leases only impose “the maximum [interest] rate allowed by law” for past-due royalties. Accordingly, to the extent *70\nHooks recovers for past due royalties, he is entitled to an 18% interest rate. For other recoveries, the statutory rate of 5% applies\nbecause Hooks has not directed us to any portion of the leases providing otherwise. We affirm in part and reverse in part the\ncourt of appeals' judgment regarding post-judgment interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hooks III, et al., without waiving any rights to contest or appeal\n\nprior orders of the Court, move that the Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs against\n\nDefendant Samson Lone Star Limited Partnership, n/k/a Samson Lone Star, L.L.C. (\"Samson\"),\n\nas follows:\n\n        Plaintiffs submit herewith a proposed Final Judgment for entry by the Court, pursuant to\n\nthe verdict of the jury, certain Orders on Motions for Partial Summary Judgment, and\n\nStipulations of the parties entered of record,. and request entry of that proposed Final Judgment.\n\nBackground\n\n       On November 3, 2008, this cause proceeded to trial and was subsequently submitted to a\n\njury on November 12, 2008. On November 13, 2008, the jury's verdict was read in open court\n\nwith all of the jury questions answered. Attached to this Motion as Exhibit A and incorporated\n\nherein by reference as if fully set out is a true and correct copy of the Charge of the Court and the\n\njury verdict form with the jury's answers to the questions submitted, as follows:\n\n        >     In response to Question No. 1, the jury found by a vote of eleven (11) to one\n              that Samson committed fraud against the Hooks;\n       >      In response to Question No. 2, the jury found by a vote of eleven (11) to one\n              that Samson committed statutory fraud against the Hooks;\n       >      In response to Question No. 3, the jury found by a vote of eleven (11) to one\n              that the sum of money if paid now in cash that would fairly and reasonable\n              compensate the Hooks for their damages proximately caused by such fraud is\n              $20,081,638.07;\n\f        J;>   The jury did not answer Questions Nos. 4, 5, 6, or 7;\n        );>   In response to Question No. 8, the jury found by a vote of eleven (11) to one\n              that Samson's failure to pay royalty based on formation production resulted in\n              underpayment of royalty under the three Hooks oil and gas leases entered as\n              Exhibits 25, 26, and 27; and\n        );>   In response to Question No. 9, the jury found by a unanimous vote that the\n              Hooks, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the\n              fraud of Samson by April 2007.\n\nIn addition, before trial, the Court had entered Orders on motions for partial summary judgment\n\nwith regard to certain claims at issue in this case. The following Orders on motions for partial\n\nsummary judgment, attached to this Motion and incorporated herein by reference, adjudicated\n\nliability- but not damages - as to some of Plaintiffs' claims, as indicated:\n\n        );>   Exhibit B: Order on Plaintiffs' First Amended Motion for Partial Summary\n              Judgment (Tract 4/14 Leases), recommended by Special Master W. Frank\n              Newton on July 29, 2008, and adopted by the Court on July 30, 2008, held\n              that the royalty rate under the Hooks oil and gas leases at issue in this case\n              (admitted as Exhibits 25, 26, and 27 at trial) has been equal to 28.28896%\n              since November 2001 and\n       );>    Exhibit C: Order Granting Plaintiffs' First Amended Motion for Partial\n              Summary Judgment (Unpooling), recommended by Special Master W. Frank\n              Newton on July 29, 2008, and adopted by the Court on July 30, 2008, held\n              that Defendant Samson pay Plaintiffs royalty on production from Samson's\n              Black Stone Minerals A-1 well based on the royalty revenue interest Plaintiffs\n              are due pursuant to the Black Stone Minerals \"A\" No. 1 Gas Unit as described\n              in Samson's Designation of Gas Unit for the Black Stone Minerals \"A\" No. 1\n              Gas Unit filed of record at Volume 1259, Page 237 of the Official Public\n              Records of Hardin County, Texas.\n\nDamages related to the foregoing Orders were left to be determined at trial.\n\n       Plaintiffs and Defendant Samson thereafter entered into certain stipulations entered into\n\nthe Court's record. Accordingly, the following stipulations are attached to this Motion and\n\nincorporated herein by reference:\n\n       );>    Exhibit D: Stipulation (regarding damages) signed by counsel for the parties\n              and filed November 7, 2008; and\n       );>    Exhibit E: Stipulation Regarding Attorneys' Fees signed by counsel for the\n              parties and filed October 31, 2008.\n\n\n\n                                                 -2 -\n\fDamages\n\n        As noted above, the jury found that the damages to the Hooks proximately caused by\n\nSamson's fraud equals $20,081,638.07. In addition, in Exhibit D, the parties stipulated amounts\n\nof damages for the claims adjudicated by the Orders on partial summary judgment listed above\n\nfor production through May 2008, with various alternatives depending on (among other things)\n\nwhether Plaintiffs prevailed in their claims that Samson had underpaid royalty by not paying it\n\nbased on \"formation production\" as specified in Plaintiffs' leases. Because the jury found that\n\nSamson's failure to pay on \"formation production\" resulted in underpayment of royalty,\n\nPlaintiffs prevailed on that claim. In addition, Samson stipulated its liability for and the amount\n\nof reimbursement it owes Plaintiffs for ad valorem taxes paid through November 2007.\n\n        Therefore, the actual damages to be awarded Plaintiffs, based on the jury's verdict, the\n\nCourt's Orders identified above, and the parties' Stipulations, are as follows:\n\n                                      Damages proximately caused by fraud:            $20,081,638.07\n                      Damages for breach of Most Favored Nations Clause:              $    848,854.01\n Damages for \"Unpooling\" claim related to Black Stone Minerals A-1 well:              $    766,626.85\n                                     Damages Related to Ad Valorem Taxes:             $     52,257.22\n                                                               Total Damages:         $21,749,376.15\n\n\nThe proposed Final Judgment submitted with this Motion includes the foregoing amounts for\n\nactual damages.\n\nAttorneys' Fees\n\n       Plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorneys' fees pursuant to statute, the leases at issue, and\n\nthe parties' Stipulations. In Exhibit E, the parties stipulated as to the amounts of reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys' fees incurred in the prosecution of Plaintiffs' claims in this case for which\n\nattorneys' fees are recoverable (net of segregation of fees for claims for which attorneys' fees are\n\nnot recoverable), and that all such fees are owed Plaintiffs if they prevailed on any claim other\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fthan certain claims specified in the Stipulation. At least because Plaintiffs prevailed on various\n\nother contract claims in this case, and Samson stipulated liability for ad valorem taxes in Exhibit\n\nD, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover fees pursuant to the Stipulation Regarding Attorneys' Fees.\n\nThe proposed Final Judgment submitted herewith includes such amounts for attorneys' fees.\n\nCosts and Witness Fees\n\n        In addition, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover various other costs incurred in connection\n\nwith this case. As the successful party, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover from Samson all taxable\n\ncosts of court. TEX. R. C1v P. 131. In addition, Plaintiffs' leases provide for recovery of \"court\n\ncosts, and other costs\" incurred in collecting unpaid amounts. Trial Exhibits 25, 26, and 27,\n\nArticle XVIJC (\"Time, Method and Manner of Payment\"). Plaintiffs are also entitled to recover\n\nother costs based on the jury's finding that Samson committed statutory fraud as defined in\n\nSection 27.01 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. Pursuant to that Section, a person\n\nwho violates its provisions is liable to the person defrauded for \"reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney's fees, expert witness fees, costs for copies of depositions, and costs of court.\" TEX.\n\nBus. & COM. CODE§ 27.01 (e).\n\n       Therefore, in addition to the usual taxable costs of court, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover\n\nat least expert witness fees and costs for copies of depositions. Plaintiffs entered evidence at trial\n\nof the fees invoiced as of the time of trial for the expert witnesses Plaintiffs called to testify -\n\nNedra Foster and Charles Graham (Exhibits 553 and 554, respectively) - and those witnesses\n\nthen estimated their additional fees through trial. In addition, evidence of such witness fees can\n\nbe submitted post-verdict by affidavit. Durish v. Panan Int'!, N.V, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438442\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438442/durish-v-panan-intern-nv/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179-80.\n\nBefore the hearing on this Motion, Plaintiffs will submit affidavit proof with supporting detail of\n\nthe additional expert witness fees invoiced post-trial, and of the costs of copies of depositions\n\nincurred by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs anticipate those total amounts will be as follows: fees for Nedra\n\n\n                                                 -4 -\n\fFoster, $47 351.79 ($40,926.94 in Exhibit 553, plus an additional $6,424.85 in post-trial billings;\n\nfees for Charles E. Graham, $58.689.07 ($50,244.99 in Exhibit 554 plus an additional $8,444.08\n\nin post-trial billings); and $5 493.51 for costs for copies of depositions. The proposed Final\n\nJudgment submitted with this Motion includes such amounts for costs and expert witness fees.\n\nPostjudgment Interest\n\n        The judgment to be entered is based on contract, i.e., Plaintiffs' oil and gas leases with\n\nSamson. Plaintiffs' damages for both fraud and breach of contract (other than unpaid taxes) are\n\nmeasured on the basis of unpaid royalty and include Late Charges computed in accordance with\n\nthose leases.\n\n       The leases specify that all royalty payments, including (unpaid) compensatory royalties -\n\nby which the damages awarded to Plaintiffs' for Samson's fraud were measured - shall be\n\nsubject to Late Charges based on the amount due, calculated at the maximum rate allowed by\n\nlaw commencing on the day after the last day on which such monthly royalty payment could\n\nhave been timely paid and for every calendar month or fraction thereof from the due date until\n\npaid. See Trial Exhibits 25, 26, and 27, Article XVII (\"Time, Method and Manner of Payment'').\n\nTherefore, per the Texas Finance Code, the judgment is \"on a contract that provides for interest\n\nor time price differential\" and thus should earn postjudgment interest at a rate equal to the lesser\n\nof the rate specified in the leases or eighteen (18) percent per year. TEXAS FIN. CODE §304.002.\n\n       The Court has previously determined that, under this provision, Late Charges are to be\n\ncomputed each month based on the amount due, including any previously accrued Late Charges,\n\ncalculated at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. See Exhibit F to this Motion: the \"Order\n\nGranting Plaintiffs' First Amended Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Accrued Unpaid\n\nRoyalties)\" recommended by Special Master W.

August of 2000, six months before\n\n24   this plat was sent to Mr. Hooks, right?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">That's correct.\n\f                                                                       50\n\n 1           Q.   Okay.     And, again, we don't know why he made\n\n 2   the mistake or how he made the error in his\n\n 3   calculations; but, nonetheless, that was what went\n\n 4   forward from August on through, correct, was the 740\n\n 5   feet?\n\n 6           A.   Up until October of '01.\n\n 7           Q.   All right.      Now, do you have any reason --\n\n 8   strike that.\n\n 9                        Okay.   So, six months after Mr. --\n\n10   Mr. Lanoue messes up with his scaling and has an                       10:17:49\n\n11   erroneous number there, this plat goes to Mr. Hooks; and\n\n12   Mr. Hooks is concerned about 1320 feet, right?\n\n13           A.   Among other things, I'm sure.\n\n14           Q.   So, he gets this -- and Mr. Lanoue -- you\n\n15   understand that Mr. Lanoue, according to Mr. Hooks, told\n\n16   him on the 20th, which is the day before he got this,\n\n17   that that well's about 1500 feet from your property.\n\n18                        You understand that?\n\n19           A.   Yes.\n\n20           Q.   All right.      Which is outside of 1320, correct?        10:18:17\n\n21           A.   True.\n\n22           Q.   But Mr. Hooks is concerned about 1320?\n\n23           A.   Yes.\n\n24           Q.   So, he has been told the well is going to be\n\n25   about 180 feet away from his protective zone, right?\n\f                                                                    53\n\n 1   doesn't it?\n\n 2        A.    Yes, plus or minus.\n\n 3        Q.    All right.

Right.\n\n22                      Now, plus or minus -- 1400 feet plus or\n\n23   minus -- how much -- how much do you think -- that plus\n\n24   or minus, what do you -- when you see that, what do you\n\n25   think of that when you say plus or minus?\n\f                                                                       54\n\n 1                       A minute ago you said 1400 feet, 1500 feet.\n\n 2   So, it was a hundred feet plus or minus, within the\n\n 3   ballpark?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>     <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">f we -- if we look at what Mr. Lanoue did --\n\n 5   if we think about the original proposed plat, which was\n\n 6   what Mr. Lanoue had, 330 feet off of the east line, this\n\n 7   one shows 740.\n\n 8                       What this has done, it means that it's\n\n 9   moved it off of this very solid survey line some 410\n\n10   feet back over to the west.

All right.   So, it's 1500 and 1400.   That's\n\n20   close enough that that shouldn't raise a red flag; is              10:51:06\n\n21   that true?\n\n22           A.

Jimmy Broussard was the -- there's -- there's a\n\n 9   lot of owners that are in that family, and he was the\n\n10   spokesman for them.                                                13:57:01\n\n11           Q.

And there were other lessors that he did not\n\n20   represent in that who were -- also had interest in that            13:57:39\n\n21   tract, right?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">'m sure there would be because they didn't\n\n23   have a hundred percent of that tract.\n\n24           Q.

No, sir.\n\n 2        Q.

Were the Hooks' interests one of those lessors\n\n 7   you had to go contact?\n\n 8        A.    They were one of the owners, yes.\n\n 9        Q.    Have you ever met Mr. Hooks?\n\n10        A.    No, sir.                                                13:58:13\n\n11        Q.

And you sent Mr. Hooks a letter similar to the\n\n15   one you sent the -- to the Heisigs and the Carlisis in\n\n16   Exhibit 63?\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Yes, sir, I sure did.\n\n18        Q.    And, then, did you then send Mr. Hooks some\n\n19   additional information about the Black Stone Minerals\n\n20   well and unit?                                                     13:58:44\n\n21        A.    He had called and was not sure -- was not sure\n\n22   where their land was laying.       He wanted to know where\n\n23   their tract was going to be located within the unit and\n\n24   requested a plat.       So, I sent him one.   I faxed him one.\n\n25                      And then, again, I talked to him in May\n\f                                                                   165\n\n 1   sorts of things associated with that, you know, oil and\n\n 2   gas business.\n\n 3        Q.   Okay.     Now, we've heard -- and you've sat here\n\n 4   through the testimony here for a couple of days -- about\n\n 5   the pooling of your tract in 2001 and the faulty\n\n 6   information that was given to you at that time.\n\n 7                     I want to move past that time for just a\n\n 8   minute, and I want to move up until the time you met my\n\n 9   partner Paul Simpson in 2006.      At that point in time did\n\n10   you have any reason to suspect that you'd been supplied             15:07:34\n\n11   false information in order to get you to join that unit?\n\n12        A.   No, I didn't.\n\n13        Q.   How did you run into Paul?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">'m a member of the Oil Gas and Mineral Law\n\n15   Section of the Houston Bar Association and every month\n\n16   they have a monthly luncheon meeting at the Houston Club\n\n17   and -- with a speaker and, so, I normally attend those\n\n18   and I -- this one particular month, day, I attended the\n\n19   meeting and that's when I -- that's when I met him.\n\n20        Q.   Okay.     And you had lunch with him there and            15:08:14\n\n21   listening to the exciting speech, I'm sure, that was\n\n22   given about oil and gas law?\n\n23        A.   Yes, we had lunch.     I don't know how exciting\n\n24   it was.   I think it was on ethics, as I recall, but...\n\n25        Q.   Okay.     The -- I remember Mr. Burmeister saying\n\f                                                                     166\n\n 1   that you had celebrated your 60th birthday going to a\n\n 2   legal seminar.\n\n 3           A.     That was just coincidental, but that's true\n\n 4   actually.\n\n 5           Q.     Now, at that point -- in that conversation did\n\n 6   you -- when you just met him casually did you suddenly\n\n 7   discover that you'd been defrauded?\n\n 8           A.     No, that's -- no, not at all.\n\n 9           Q.     How did the conversation go that you became\n\n10   interested in looking into seeing whether or not Samson               15:09:08\n\n11   had done something wrong to your family?\n\n12           A.     Well, when I sat down next to Paul at this\n\n13   table, he was sitting there by himself initially and I\n\n14   went over to join him and I thought I'd be friendly,\n\n15   it'd be a nice thing to sit down next to him.        So, I did\n\n16   that.        We introduced each other and he recognized my\n\n17   name from some litigation that he had been involved in\n\n18   already and started asking me some questions and said,\n\n19   \"Yes, I'm that Charles Hooks,\" et cetera, and, so, we\n\n20   got into a little bit of discussion about some of the                 15:09:44\n\n21   things that are involved here.\n\n22           Q.     And I don't want to get into all that, but did\n\n23   you eventually go down to his office and see some of the\n\n24   materials that he had accumulated in this existing\n\n25   lawsuit against Samson for some other people?\n\f                                                                    167\n\n 1          A.   Yes, yes, I did.\n\n 2          Q.   Okay.     And, again, at that point in time was\n\n 3   the nature of the claim failure to pay royalties,\n\n 4   something like that?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>          <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Things of that nature, right.\n\n 6          Q.   It wasn't -- you hadn't discovered the fraud\n\n 7   yet?\n\n 8          A.   No, that wasn't involved at that time.\n\n 9          Q.   Well, at what point in time just generally did\n\n10   you-all, through the discovery process, uncover what had             15:10:23\n\n11   happened to you?\n\n12          A.   Oh, I think it was in the spring, the following\n\n13   spring that information came out.\n\n14          Q.   And it was at that point in time that you\n\n15   actually amended your lawsuit that -- you were already\n\n16   part of another lawsuit against Samson.        You amended\n\n17   that and brought the fraud allegation as part of this\n\n18   case here today?\n\n19          A.   Yes, once we became aware of the situation.\n\n20          Q.   Now, now I want to rewind back -- okay? -- to            15:10:52\n\n21   how you got into any kind of business arrangement with\n\n22   Samson.\n\n23                       Let me show you Exhibit 501 (tendering).\n\n24   Can you identify Exhibit 501?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span>          <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">This -- yes, I can identify it.\n\f                                                                       175\n\n 1   beginning of all that, it says that that's to be done\n\n 2   within 90 days from the date production is first sold.\n\n 3        A.

Now, this was in '99 when you entered\n\n 8   into this lease.      Do you recall getting a letter from a\n\n 9   Mr. Glenn Lanoue in February of 2001?\n\n10        A.   Yes.     Yes, I did.                                          15:22:24\n\n11        Q.   Okay.\n\n12                     MR.

And is this similar\n\n16   to the letter that he sent to you?          And I say \"similar,\"\n\n17   because you've added some things here, right?\n\n18        A.   Yes.     That's my -- my annotated version of the\n\n19   letter, right.\n\n20        Q.   So, this actually is the letter as you sent it                15:22:49\n\n21   back to him a couple of days later, correct?\n\n22        A.   Yes.\n\n23        Q.   Okay.     So, let's -- let's go to Exhibit 63,\n\n24   which just shows the letter as it was sent to most of\n\n25   the other royalty owners.

Is that what you were trying to find out?\n\f                                                                    181\n\n 1   been admitted.\n\n 2                    THE TECHNICIAN:     (Complying).\n\n 3          Q.   (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)     Is this the -- the fax he\n\n 4   sent to you that -- I think the same day or the next\n\n 5   day?\n\n 6          A.   It looks like it's the next day, and it looks\n\n 7   like the transmittal sheet.\n\n 8          Q.   All right.\n\n 9                    MR. LOCHRIDGE:     And let's flip to the -- I\n\n10   believe it's the last page of this exhibit.                          15:29:36\n\n11                    THE TECHNICIAN:     (Complying).\n\n12          Q.   (BY MR. LOCHRIDGE)     The jury's seen this\n\n13   before.\n\n14                    First of all, is that the plat he sent to\n\n15   you, the last page of this Exhibit 64?\n\n16          A.   Yes, as far as I can tell.\n\n17          Q.   And what did you do to verify that the -- what\n\n18   he told you was true about the well being located 1500\n\n19   feet away from Pine Bayou -- Pine Bayou?\n\n20          A.   Well, I looked at the -- what was indicated on           15:30:06\n\n21   the plat; and it shows me that it was approximately --\n\n22   the bottom hole location was approximately 1400 feet\n\n23   west of Pine Island Bayou.\n\n24          Q.   Now, that's a little bit different than the\n\n25   1500 feet that he told you over the telephone, right?\n\f                                                                  182\n\n 1        A.   A little bit.     I assumed that he was talking in\n\n 2   generalities in that case and that once he got the plat\n\n 3   it was more specific on the plat.\n\n 4        Q.   Well, did that spark any concern that he might\n\n 5   be lying to you if he told you 1500 on the telephone and\n\n 6   then gave you a plat that was 1400?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">No.     I -- the plat speaks for itself.\n\n 8        Q.   Okay.\n\n 9        A.   And I had no reason to be concerned that it\n\n10   wasn't accurate.                                                   15:31:02\n\n11        Q.   Well, did you go and hire a surveyor or anyone\n\n12   to check it out?\n\n13        A.   No.     I didn't see any reason to do that.   It\n\n14   seems -- I mean, I assumed that he was going to send me\n\n15   accurate information; and that's what I got.\n\n16        Q.   Now, earlier there was some argument made about\n\n17   this arrow going -- the leader, I think they call it,\n\n18   from this box that says B.H.L. going over in the\n\n19   direction.\n\n20                     From looking at this plat where did you          15:31:43\n\n21   believe the bottom hole to be?\n\n22        A.   Well, it looks like the bottom hole is there at\n\n23   that sort of black dot area where the -- right about --\n\n24        Q.   (Indicating)?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">-- right there about where the red is, right.\n\f                                                                   183\n\n 1   That would be about where it would be, that\n\n 2   intersection.\n\n 3        Q.    Now, I want to -- well, first of all, after you\n\n 4   got this plat and checked it out and confirmed what\n\n 5   Mr. Lanoue had told you over the telephone, what did you\n\n 6   then do?    Did you agree to -- to accept the pooling?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Well, once I had satisfied myself that\n\n 8   everything was in order, was appropriate, then I decided\n\n 9   I would send back the letter that he had requested me to\n\n10   sign agreeing to this but with some changes on it.                  15:32:49\n\n11        Q.    Okay.   Let's turn back to Exhibit 65.   Now, is\n\n12   that the -- did you just take his letter dated February\n\n13   15th and edit it with your changes?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Yes, that's what I did.\n\n15        Q.

Okay.   And you just typed that in yourself?\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> personally typed that on there.\n\n20        Q.    And, then, is that yours and your wife's                 15:33:26\n\n21   initials to the left?\n\n22        A.    Yes, they are.\n\n23        Q.    Now, why did you want to tie them down to the\n\n24   plat that he had sent to you?\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>    <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Well, that's the basis on which I made the\n\f                                                                      184\n\n 1   decision that everything was okay; and I wanted to be\n\n 2   sure there was no confusion later as to what was what.\n\n 3   I mean, that's the basis on which it was all done.\n\n 4           Q.   Let's turn to the third page of this.    The\n\n 5   jury's seen this plat.\n\n 6                       Now, is this the same plat that he sent to\n\n 7   you, only now it has your and your wife's signatures?\n\n 8           A.   Yes.    Right.   We initialed it.\n\n 9           Q.   Or I'm sorry.     Initialed it.\n\n10                       And what was the purpose of initialling the        15:34:16\n\n11   plat?\n\n12           A.   To be sure that that was, in fact, the plat and\n\n13   that if it ever came up later, that this was the plat we\n\n14   were using to establish this information.\n\n15           Q.   And what are the two things that were of\n\n16   importance to you on this plat?\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Well, first and foremost, the location of the\n\n18   well and then, of course, how our 50 acres would fit\n\n19   into this proposed unit that they were -- would do.\n\n20           Q.   And the plat shows both the area here is your             15:34:50\n\n21   50 acres?\n\n22           A.   Yes.    I think it's Tract 4, that they have it\n\n23   designated as Tract 4.\n\n24           Q.

Exhibit 552 appears to be a copy of all of the\n\n 5   various royalty checks we've received from Samson over a\n\n 6   period of time.\n\n 7        Q.   Okay.     And does Samson send -- how does Samson\n\n 8   send the checks, a different check for each well; or how\n\n 9   do they do this?\n\n10        A.   No.     They send one check each month which              16:24:27\n\n11   covers all of the royalty from each of the -- the wells\n\n12   or units --\n\n13        Q.

And then you re -- what, do you generally just\n\n16   routinely put those in the bank, you or Norma?\n\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Well, yes, we deposit those each time.\n\n18        Q.   Okay.     Now, you've heard the counsel for Samson\n\n19   talk about you just accepting this money all along\n\n20   and -- despite the fact that you feel like you were not             16:24:54\n\n21   shot straight with regard to this unit.      You've heard\n\n22   that argument, right?\n\n23        A.   Yes, I have.\n\n24        Q.   Well, when you've cashed these checks, has it\n\n25   been your intent to ratify or acquiesce in any way with\n\f                                                                    204\n\n 1   what they have done here with regard to this unit?\n\n 2        A.   Not at all.\n\n 3        Q.   Well, why have you cashed the checks, then?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">'ve cashed the checks because I see that as\n\n 5   just being a part of what they actually owe me.        I saw\n\n 6   no reason not to go ahead and accept them.\n\n 7        Q.   Now, you have not calculated yourself what you\n\n 8   think you're owed, have you?\n\n 9        A.   No.\n\n10        Q.   Again, is that -- have you left that up to                 16:25:44\n\n11   Mr. Graham?\n\n12        A.   Yes.    That's his job.\n\n13        Q.   Now, do you know if Mr. Graham has been\n\n14   instructed one way or the other about giving Samson\n\n15   credit for the -- the funds that they have paid you?\n\n16        A.   Well, yes.    If -- whatever that may be that I'm\n\n17   owed -- I mean, anything I've already received, I would\n\n18   certainly give him credit for that.\n\n19                    MR.

Well, as far as I could tell on what he had faxed\n\n25   me, that was -- that area was where the -- was the bottom hole\n\n\n\n                       ANITA L.

But this is what he faxed you, Mr. Hooks; and from\n\n 3   looking at this, you can't tell where the bottom hole is.\n\n 4                     But, yet, you didn't call him, did you, and ask\n\n 5   him for some clarification?\n\n 6        A.      Well, I didn't think I needed any clarification.     It\n\n 7   seemed clear to me that it was -- it was 1400 feet away from\n\n 8   the bayou.\n\n 9        Q.      Well, there's a line over here that's 1400 feet\n\n10   away; but you can't tell where the well is, Mr. Hooks.     That's\n\n11   what's important, isn't it?\n\n12        A.      To me, where that line went to and where that arrow\n\n13   appeared to go to were very close and it -- it -- I didn't\n\n14   have -- there was no confusion as far as I was concerned.\n\n15        Q.      All right.   So, your testimony is that where this\n\n16   arrow is going, which is right here (indicating) underneath\n\n17   this \"4\", and where the bottom hole location actually was, at\n\n18   least for purposes of this map, are all in the same area and it\n\n19   was okay, it was ballpark, and it was close enough for\n\n20   government work, huh?\n\n21        A.      From the fax that I got, which was not the size of\n\n22   this -- it was a small piece of paper -- it looked very much\n\n23   like that arrow was at that intersection where the bottom hole\n\n24   location supposedly is.\n\n25        Q.      All right, Mr. Hooks.   Here's one just the same size\n\n\n\n                        ANITA L.

You see the arrow going right under the\n\n 2   \"4\" just like it is on the big one?        It's even harder to see on\n\n 3   that one, isn't it, Mr. Hooks?\n\n 4        A.     Actually this is clearer to me because that line\n\n 5   appears to continue across there and there's a little circle\n\n 6   where that intersection is and that looks like that's where the\n\n 7   bottom hole location would be and that's exactly what -- the\n\n 8   way I interpret it.\n\n 9        Q.     So, you don't think that arrow goes to the bottom of\n\n10   the \"4\"?

Yes.    I -- I concluded that it was fourteen --\n\n24   approximately 1400 feet west of Pine Island Bayou.\n\n25          Q.    Now, did it give you any concern that, even by this\n\n\n\n                          ANITA L.

Not really.\n\n 4           Q.      So, now that we're within 80 feet, given that he's\n\n 5   already missed it by a hundred feet, it didn't send off a -- a\n\n 6   red light in your head, thinking, \"Wow, this guy told me 1500\n\n 7   feet yesterday, which was close enough, and now he's missed it\n\n 8   by a hundred feet.        Now we're within 80 feet.     What if he's\n\n 9   missed it any more\"?\n\n10                         That didn't trigger a question like that in\n\n11   your mind?\n\n12           A.      No.   His comment was that he was approximately 1500\n\n13   feet; and when I saw a surveyor's plat that shows 1400 feet, I\n\n14   assume that's more accurate than what his -- his verbal\n\n15   estimation was.\n\n16           Q.      What about the fact that it was 1400 feet plus or\n\n17   minus?       What if 80 feet is the minus?\n\n18           A.      To me plus or minus means just a few feet, not a\n\n19   huge substantial amount.\n\n20           Q.      Well, you heard Ms. -- Ms. Foster's testimony and\n\n21   I -- and she was a little ambivalent but she seemed to think,\n\n22   ah, 1500 feet, 1400 feet, you know, it's not much difference,\n\n23   kind of like the plus or minus might go as far as a hundred\n\n24   feet.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span>           <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>      <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">That's not my -- that's not my assumption.\n\n\n                            ANITA L.

I assumed this was a proposed unit and that the\n\n10   reference, if I even saw that down there, was from the other\n\n11   unit, not from what they were proposing, because it was\n\n12   consistent with the arrow -- with the 1400 feet.\n\n13           Q.       Well, there's no way -- just to be absolutely sure,\n\n14   Mr. -- Mr. Hooks, there is no way that 1400 feet to this line\n\n15   (indicating) and 1400 feet to this line (indicating) are\n\n16   consistent.

What -- if Mr. Hooks had declined to\n\n17   participate in the unit, what would Samson have done --\n\n18        A.   Well --\n\n19        Q.   -- with his tract, with his lease?\n\n20        A.   Sure.     Obviously we would have released that 50        10:41:15\n\n21   acres.\n\n22        Q.   But why is that?     Why would you have done that?\n\n23        A.   Well, that's kind of why it's so flabbergasting\n\n24   to hear Mr. Hooks claim that, you know, he would have\n\n25   opted out of the unit.      If we'd have released it or he'd\n\f                                                                        63\n\n 1   have opted out of the unit, then all that money that we\n\n 2   paid him, we would have got.          It makes no sense.\n\n 3           Q.    Was there any motive whatsoever to trick\n\n 4   Mr. Hooks or defraud Mr. Hooks into staying in the unit\n\n 5   or joining the unit?\n\n 6           A.    No.     As Mr. Hooks himself said, there was kind\n\n 7   of a counter motive, you know.          It makes the opposite\n\n 8   sense.       If anything, if he'd have claimed that we tried\n\n 9   to trick him out of joining unit so we could have kept\n\n10   his money.          Now, that makes sense because we would have         10:42:06\n\n11   gotten more money.          To claim that we tried to trick him\n\n12   into the unit makes zero sense.\n\n13           Q.

Well, frankly, Mr. Beale, did you even need the\n\n19   Broussard's lease to drain or to extract the minerals\n\n20   that might have been captured from coming under their                   10:42:45\n\n21   land?\n\n22           A.    No.     I mean we could have just excluded that\n\n23   acreage entirely and just drilled the well and formed\n\n24   the unit differently.          Then he didn't have to be in the\n\n25   unit at all.\n\f                                                                         65\n\n 1   and so forth.

Now, you have seen introduced into evidence a\n\n 8   lease renewal and extension for 590 acres.            You recall\n\n 9   that?\n\n10           A.     Sure.                                                     10:44:38\n\n11           Q.     Mr. Hooks' tract is 640 and then the 50 had\n\n12   been participated in the unit?\n\n13           A.     Right.\n\n14           Q.     Samson took out a lease extension and renewal\n\n15   on the remaining 590 acres?\n\n16           A.     Sure.\n\n17           Q.     Why did you do that?\n\n18           A.     Well, we had a active exploration program going\n\n19   in the area.           It's just standard policy to keep your\n\n20   lease position intact while you're still active in the                   10:45:03\n\n21   area.        There's no reason not to.     It's small dollars.\n\n22   That's what we're in the business for.\n\n23           Q.     Did that -- does that other 590-acre tract and\n\n24   the renewal and extension you got on it have anything to\n\n25   do with the BSM-1 well or the DuJay 1 well?\n\f                                                                   66\n\n 1         A.   Absolutely nothing.\n\n 2         Q.   Why is that?\n\n 3         A.   Well, it's across a fault.   We included in the\n\n 4   unit the acreage that we felt was part of the -- you\n\n 5   know, what we were producing out of and then there's a\n\n 6   fault and then there's the other 590 acres which was\n\n 7   just completely different, had nothing to do with it.\n\n 8         Q.   So, could -- had you released Mr. Hooks' 50\n\n 9   acres, if he didn't want to join the unit, could you\n\n10   have kept the 590 acres, extended that and renewed that?           10:45:54\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span>         <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">Yeah, could have, would have -- we did --\n\n12   whether he joined the unit or not.\n\n13         Q.   Did Simpson -- excuse me -- Samson have any\n\n14   incentive to agree to pay compensatory royalties to\n\n15   Mr. Hooks?    Would there have been any -- any scenario\n\n16   that under the conditions that we know existed that\n\n17   would have caused Samson to pay him compensatory\n\n18   royalties rather than release?\n\n19         A.   Well, let me think.   If we release it, we get a\n\n20   bunch of money.    If we pay compensatory royalties, we've         10:46:26\n\n21   got to pay out a bunch of money.     No, there's no reason\n\n22   to do that, absolutely none.     We'd have just released\n\n23   it.   We'd have made more money.    End of story.\n\n24         Q.

Yes.\n\n 2        Q.   Now, we also know from what we've seen that in\n\n 3   November of 2001 -- which we'll go to Exhibit 71 -- the\n\n 4   lawyer -- this is November of 2001 -- the lawyer sends to\n\n 5   Mr. Lanoue another amended plat.       And this one -- or\n\n 6   amended designation.\n\n 7                    And this one has an accurate plat on it.    Do\n\n 8   you recall that?\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>   <span class=\"page\">I</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> recall that I think the final amendment had the\n\n10   right plat.\n\n11        Q.   Right.     And that Mr. Lanoue had that in November\n\n12   of 2001, correct?\n\n13        A.   Makes sense.\n\n14        Q.   And we also know --\n\n15                    MR. LOCHRIDGE:   -- if you would put\n\n16   Plaintiffs' 19 up there --\n\n17        Q.   (By Mr. Lochridge) -- that it doesn't get filed\n\n18   until some 14 months later in early 2003, correct?\n\n19        A.   Right.\n\n20        Q.   So, it's not until then that if Mr. Hooks had any\n\n21   reason to suspect he had been misled that he could\n\n22   actually find some accurate information, correct?\n\n23        A.   No, I don't think that is correct.      I think there\n\n24   was a correct plat out there at the Railroad Commission,\n\n25   wasn't there?\n\f         Cecilia Gower, CSR - 60th District Court, Beaumont, TX\n\n                                                                            62\n\n 1   here.        Yet, I heard testimony today that the bottom hole\n\n 2   location is supposed to be 1400 feet, which is over here\n\n 3   (indicating).          So, those two things don't go around.     I\n\n 4   mean, just by looking at the plat those two things don't\n\n 5   match.        And then if you go to the Railroad Commission\n\n 6   records that were available at this time, the actual\n\n 7   bottom hole location is way over here.\n\n 8                      Then, in addition, the plat says the bottom\n\n 9   hole location is 1400 feet from the east unit line.            Well,\n\n10   the east unit line is this point right here, which would\n\n11   be 1400 feet this way.          So, if you just simply look at\n\n12   this plat in any detail you just see that it has severe\n\n13   problems.\n\n14           Q.     Let's talk about -- you can sit back down --\n\n15   well, keep standing because you're probably gonna point at\n\n16   the map.\n\n17                      What is the significance of the distance\n\n18   being marked as 1400 feet plus or minus scale?          And could\n\n19   you point to that over there?\n\n20           A.     Right here (indicating).\n\n21           Q.     Yes, sir.    What does 1400 plus or minus scale\n\n22   mean?\n\n23           A.     Well, scale means that somebody used a ruler to\n\n24   do it, as opposed to surveying it.\n\n25           Q.     Okay.    So, a surveyor didn't go survey 1400 feet.\n\f         Cecilia Gower, CSR - 60th District Court, Beaumont, TX\n\n                                                                           63\n\n 1   Somebody took out a ruler on a map with a scale and\n\n 2   measured 1400 feet?\n\n 3           A.    That's my interpretation.\n\n 4           Q.    Okay.    How would that possibly affect the\n\n 5   accuracy of this plat?\n\n 6           A.    Well, it's -- the 1400 feet doesn't go to any\n\n 7   known point that I'm aware of that's relevant or material\n\n 8   here, because it doesn't go to the bottom hole location\n\n 9   even shown on this map.         It doesn't go to the bottom hole\n\n10   location that's in the commission records at this time,\n\n11   been in the records about six months at this time.           So, it\n\n12   just sort of goes to an irrelevant point.\n\n13           Q..    Okay.

How -- is it difficult to accurately scale on a\n\n17   map like that?\n\n18           A.    Well, I mean, it's -- if you look at this scale,\n\n19   sure, it's subject to some error.\n\n20           Q.    What is the scale on that map, the one in your\n\n21   hand?\n\n22           A.
