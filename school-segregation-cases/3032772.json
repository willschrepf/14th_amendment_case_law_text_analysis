R. 47.5.4.\n       1Crawford’s brief is inconsistent regarding whether her first name is spelled “Rachel”\nor “Rachael.” We will use the spelling in the case caption.\n\f     Case: 15-50175        Document: 00513365827          Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/02/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-50175\nruled that the doctrine of claim preclusion 2 barred Crawford’s Americans with\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”) claim because she could have raised that claim in one\nof her previous lawsuits against the District. 3 We affirm.\n\n\n                                               I.\n       Crawford suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome, a psychological disorder\ncharacterized by significant difficulties in nonverbal communication and social\ninteraction, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and\ninterests.\n       Crawford attended high school in the District. The District provided\nCrawford special education services to accommodate her disability. Crawford\nalleges that, while she was still a student, the District discriminated against\nher on the basis of disability in two respects. She first alleges that, while she\nwas experiencing an emotional outburst at school, District employees\nrestrained her and injured her head. She also alleges that the District denied\nher an appropriate education by segregating her from non-disabled students\nin a closed room without providing her liquids or bathroom breaks. Crawford\nclaims that the District’s actions violated the ADA.\n       This is the third time Crawford has sued the District. 4 Her first suit\nagainst the District raised a claim pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (“IDEA”). Because all the events giving rise to Crawford’s ADA\n\n\n       2  Many courts and litigants, including the parties in this case, use the term “res\njudicata” instead of “claim preclusion.” Commentators prefer the term “claim preclusion”\nbecause it is more precise. CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS 680 (4th ed.\n1983). We will therefore use the term “claim preclusion” to the exclusion of “res judicata.”\n        3 Crawford also raised claims under IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983 in her complaint, but she does not pursue those claims on appeal.\n        4 Crawford’s mother filed the first suit against the District on Crawford’s behalf as her\n\nnext friend. After Crawford’s mother died, Crawford amended her complaint in the first case\nto pursue her claims on her own behalf. Thus, Crawford was a named plaintiff in all three\nsuits against the District.\n                                               2\n\f    Case: 15-50175    Document: 00513365827     Page: 3   Date Filed: 02/02/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-50175\nclaims had already occurred by the time Crawford filed the first suit, she could\nhave raised her ADA claims at the same time as her IDEA claim. However, she\ndid not do so. Crawford ultimately settled her IDEA claim against the District,\nand the court entered a final judgment dismissing the first case with prejudice.\n      In the instant case, Crawford now pursues the ADA claims she could\nhave pursued in the first suit. The District moved for summary judgment, and\nthe district court referred the summary judgment motion to a magistrate\njudge. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the\nmotion. He reasoned that, “[b]ecause all of the facts were known to [Crawford]\nand her mother when the First Suit was filed, [Crawford] could have brought\nthe claims raised in the Current Suit in her First Suit.” The magistrate judge\ntherefore concluded that the doctrine of claim preclusion barred Crawford from\nraising her ADA claims in the instant case.\n      The magistrate judge warned Crawford that if she failed to file written\nobjections to the report and recommendation within fourteen days, she would\nbe barred “from de novo review by the District Court of the proposed findings\nand recommendations in the Report,” as well as “from appellate review of\nunobjected-to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the\nDistrict Court,” “except upon grounds of plain error.”\n      Crawford nevertheless failed to object to the report and recommendation.\nThe district court accordingly reviewed the report and recommendation for\nplain error and found none. The district court therefore adopted the report and\nrecommendation in its entirety and granted summary judgment in the\nDistrict’s favor. Crawford now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\f     Case: 15-50175       Document: 00513365827         Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/02/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-50175\n                                             II.\n       “Ordinarily, ‘[w]e review a district court’s grant of summary judgment\nde novo, applying the same standards as the district court.’” 5 However, if the\nappellant “‘did not object to a magistrate judge’s findings of fact, conclusions of\nlaw, or recommendation to the district court’ despite being ‘served with notice\nof the consequences of failing to object[,]’” we instead review the district court’s\njudgment for plain error. 6 The plain error standard applies to the magistrate\njudge’s legal conclusions and factual findings alike. 7\n       Crawford did not object to the magistrate judge’s report and\nrecommendation, even though the magistrate judge warned her of the\nconsequences of failing to object. Thus, the plain error standard governs this\nappeal.\n\n\n                                             III.\n       Claim preclusion, also known as res judicata, 8 “bars the litigation of\nclaims that either have been litigated or should have been raised in an earlier\nsuit.” 9 For the following reasons, the magistrate judge did not plainly err by\nconcluding that Crawford could have and should have raised her ADA claims\nin her first lawsuit against the District.\n\n\n\n\n       5 Ortiz v.

In both\ncases, Crawford was a named plaintiff and the District was a named defendant.\n       Second, the district court in the first case was a court of competent\njurisdiction.\n       Third, the first case was concluded by a final judgment on the merits\nbecause Crawford stipulated to dismissal of the first case with prejudice. 10\n       Finally, the first case and the current case involve the same claim or\ncause of action. Two cases involve the same claim or cause of action if they “are\nbased on the same nucleus of operative facts.” 11 Here, both cases involve the\nsame allegations that the District failed to provide disability-appropriate\neducational services to Crawford. Moreover, both cases involve events that\noccurred during the same time period. Thus, both cases involve the same\nnucleus of operative facts, and, therefore, the claim or cause of action. 12\n       Crawford argues that the first case and the current case do not involve\nthe same claim or cause of action because the IDEA claim she raised in the\nfirst case is governed by different elements than the ADA claim she raises in\nin the instant case. To support her argument, she cites Pace v. Bogulusa City\nSchool Board, 403 F.3d 272 (5th Cir. 2005) (en banc), which states that\n“relitigation of an issue is not precluded unless the facts and the legal\nstandards used to assess them are the same in both proceedings.” 13\n\n\n\n\n       10  See United States v. Cunan, 156 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir. 1998) (“[A] voluntary\ndismissal with prejudice is ordinarily deemed a final judgment that satisfies the [claim\npreclusion] criterion.”).\n        11 Petro-Hunt, 365 F.3d at 396 (citing Southmark, 163 F.3d at 934).\n        12 See Draper v. Atlanta Independent School System, 377 F. App’x 937, 940 (11th Cir.\n\n2010) (“Because [the prior case] and the instant case involve Plaintiff’s same primary right\nto receive a proper education, Defendant’s same duty to provide a proper education, and the\nsame nucleus of operative fact, they involve the same cause of action for the purposes of [claim\npreclusion].”).\n        13 403 F.3d at 290.\n\n                                               5\n\f     Case: 15-50175       Document: 00513365827          Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/02/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-50175\n       Crawford’s argument confuses two distinct doctrines with different\nelements. The standard Crawford cites from Pace applies to the doctrine of\nissue preclusion (also known as collateral estoppel), not claim preclusion. 14 The\ntwo doctrines are “very different.” 15 Claim preclusion “foreclos[es] any\nlitigation of matters that have never been litigated” on the ground that “they\nshould have been advanced in an earlier suit.” 16 Issue preclusion, by contrast,\n“foreclos[es] relitigation of matters that have once been litigated and decided.” 17\nBecause issue preclusion, unlike claim preclusion, requires the matter in\nquestion to be fully litigated in a prior proceeding, the doctrine only applies if\n“the facts and the legal standards used to assess them are the same in both\nproceedings.” 18 Claim preclusion, which is the only type of preclusion that this\nappeal implicates, has no such requirement. 19 Because the first case and the\ninstant case involve the same nucleus of operative facts, the magistrate judge\ncorrectly concluded that claim preclusion bars Crawford’s suit. 20\n       In sum, the magistrate judge committed no error, plain or otherwise. 21\nWe therefore affirm the judgment.\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       14  See id.\n       15  CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS 680 (4th ed. 1983).\n        16 Id.

Crawford now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\f     Case: 15-50175       Document: 00513365827         Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/02/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-50175\n                                             II.\n       “Ordinarily, ‘[w]e review a district court’s grant of summary judgment\nde novo, applying the same standards as the district court.’” 5 However, if the\nappellant “‘did not object to a magistrate judge’s findings of fact, conclusions of\nlaw, or recommendation to the district court’ despite being ‘served with notice\nof the consequences of failing to object[,]’” we instead review the district court’s\njudgment for plain error. 6 The plain error standard applies to the magistrate\njudge’s legal conclusions and factual findings alike. 7\n       Crawford did not object to the magistrate judge’s report and\nrecommendation, even though the magistrate judge warned her of the\nconsequences of failing to object. Thus, the plain error standard governs this\nappeal.\n\n\n                                             III.\n       Claim preclusion, also known as res judicata, 8 “bars the litigation of\nclaims that either have been litigated or should have been raised in an earlier\nsuit.” 9 For the following reasons, the magistrate judge did not plainly err by\nconcluding that Crawford could have and should have raised her ADA claims\nin her first lawsuit against the District.\n\n\n\n\n       5 Ortiz v.

In both\ncases, Crawford was a named plaintiff and the District was a named defendant.\n       Second, the district court in the first case was a court of competent\njurisdiction.\n       Third, the first case was concluded by a final judgment on the merits\nbecause Crawford stipulated to dismissal of the first case with prejudice. 10\n       Finally, the first case and the current case involve the same claim or\ncause of action. Two cases involve the same claim or cause of action if they “are\nbased on the same nucleus of operative facts.” 11 Here, both cases involve the\nsame allegations that the District failed to provide disability-appropriate\neducational services to Crawford. Moreover, both cases involve events that\noccurred during the same time period. Thus, both cases involve the same\nnucleus of operative facts, and, therefore, the claim or cause of action. 12\n       Crawford argues that the first case and the current case do not involve\nthe same claim or cause of action because the IDEA claim she raised in the\nfirst case is governed by different elements than the ADA claim she raises in\nin the instant case. To support her argument, she cites Pace v.

The standard Crawford cites from Pace applies to the doctrine of\nissue preclusion (also known as collateral estoppel), not claim preclusion. 14 The\ntwo doctrines are “very different.” 15 Claim preclusion “foreclos[es] any\nlitigation of matters that have never been litigated” on the ground that “they\nshould have been advanced in an earlier suit.” 16 Issue preclusion, by contrast,\n“foreclos[es] relitigation of matters that have once been litigated and decided.” 17\nBecause issue preclusion, unlike claim preclusion, requires the matter in\nquestion to be fully litigated in a prior proceeding, the doctrine only applies if\n“the facts and the legal standards used to assess them are the same in both\nproceedings.” 18 Claim preclusion, which is the only type of preclusion that this\nappeal implicates, has no such requirement. 19 Because the first case and the\ninstant case involve the same nucleus of operative facts, the magistrate judge\ncorrectly concluded that claim preclusion bars Crawford’s suit. 20\n       In sum, the magistrate judge committed no error, plain or otherwise. 21\nWe therefore affirm the judgment.\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       14  See id.\n       15  CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS 680 (4th ed. 1983).\n        16 Id.
