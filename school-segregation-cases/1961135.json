Frostrom, for\n\nDefendants and Respondents.\n\n       In 2007, defendants and appellants, the City of National City and its Community\n\nDevelopment Commission (the Commission or CDC; together, the City), approved an\n\namendment to its 1995 redevelopment plan, ordinance No. 2007-2295 (Amendment), that\n\nextended the time period authorized by the plan for the use of eminent domain powers\n\nwithin a 300-acre area, based on certain designations of physical and economic blight.\n\n(Health & Saf. Code, § 33000 et seq., the Community Redevelopment Law (CRL); all\n\nfurther statutory references are to the Health & Safety Code unless noted.) During the\n\nCity's months-long amendment and hearing process, it received statutorily mandated\n\nreports from a retained private consultant, held noticed hearings, and received opposition\n\nfrom two sets of landowners within the Amendment area, plaintiff and appellant\n\nCommunity Youth Athletic Center (CYAC), and additional respondents, Robert Leif,\n\nSuzanne Leif and Anthony Bedford (the \"Interested Parties\"). (§§ 33352, subd. (b);\n\n33457.1.)1\n\n\n\n1       Under section 33352, subdivision (b): \"Every redevelopment plan submitted by\nthe agency to the legislative body shall be accompanied by a report containing all of the\nfollowing: [¶] (b) A description of the physical and economic conditions specified in\nSection 33031 that exist in the area that cause the project area to be blighted. The\ndescription shall include a list of the physical and economic conditions described in\nSection 33031 that exist within the project area and a map showing where in the project\nthe conditions exist. The description shall contain specific, quantifiable evidence that\ndocuments both of the following: [¶] (1) The physical and economic conditions specified\nin Section 33031. [¶] (2) That the described physical and economic conditions are so\nprevalent and substantial that, collectively, they seriously harm the entire project area.\"\n(Italics added.)\n                                             2\n\f       When their opposition to the City's approval of the Amendment was unsuccessful,\n\nCYAC brought this reverse validation action in superior court (Code Civ. Proc., § 860 et\n\nseq., the Validation Act), to seek declaratory and injunctive relief and damages under\n\nseveral statutory and constitutional theories, along with attorney fees and costs. (CRL,\n\n§§ 33500, 33501; Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq., Public Records Act (PRA) violations; U.S.\n\nConst., 14th Amend. (due process clause); 42 U.S.C. § 1988.) The response filed by the\n\nInterested Parties sought similar relief.\n\n       After a bench trial, the superior court issued a statement of decision and judgment\n\nin favor of CYAC, the Interested Parties and the interested public. In the reverse\n\nvalidation proceedings, the trial court examined the administrative record and set aside\n\nthe Amendment to the redevelopment plan, by issuing declaratory relief based on its\n\nfindings of several violations of the CRL: (1) contrary to the provisions of section\n\n33457.1, the City failed to include in its mandated report, prior to the hearing on such\n\nAmendment, the maps required by section 33352, subdivision (b) that documented the\n\nphysical and economic conditions of blight that existed within the project area, (2) the\n\nadministrative record did not contain substantial evidence supporting the physical blight\n\nfindings underlying the Amendment, and (3) neither the City nor its retained private\n\nconsultant (Rosenow Spevacek Group, or \"RSG\") had produced, on request by CYAC,\n\ntwo types of underlying raw data relied upon in the RSG \"Report to Council\" (the\n\n\"RTC\") (i.e., RSG's field surveys of blight conditions, or the City's police department's\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fproperty-by-property crime data).2 The City had relied on those RSG field surveys and\n\ncrime data to support the enactment of the Amendment which extended the eminent\n\ndomain redevelopment power, as they led to the RTC's conclusions that physical and\n\neconomic blight existed within the project area, but the record did not support that\n\nreliance.\n\n       In an underlying finding, the trial court concluded that the administrative record\n\nnevertheless contained \"substantial evidence\" of a condition of economic blight (by using\n\ncrime statistics City-wide). However, since the record failed to contain \"substantial\n\nevidence of at least one condition of physical blight,\" and since both findings were\n\nneeded, the Amendment was declared invalid. (§§ 33030, subd. (b); 33031, subds. (a),\n\n(b); 33333.2, subd. (a)(4).)\n\n       Additionally, the trial court issued declaratory relief on the ground that the City\n\nhad violated the PRA, by failing to produce at the request of CYAC certain documents\n\nabout the same two types of underlying raw data relied upon in the RTC (field surveys of\n\nblight conditions, and property-by-property crime data), which the City had used to\n\njustify its blight claims.\n\n\n\n\n2       Section 33457.1 provides: \"To the extent warranted by a proposed amendment to\na redevelopment plan, (1) the ordinance adopting an amendment to a redevelopment plan\nshall contain the findings required by Section 33367 and (2) the reports and information\nrequired by Section 33352 shall be prepared and made available to the public prior to the\nhearing on such amendment.\" (Italics added.) Section 33367, subdivision (d) requires\nthe redevelopment ordinance or amendment to include findings of, inter alia, its necessity\nto alleviate blight conditions, \"based on clearly articulated and documented evidence.\"\n                                              4\n\f       Further, the court determined that the federal procedural due process rights of\n\nCYAC and the public had not been adequately protected by the City during the\n\namendment process, due to the City's failure to comply with CRL statutory requirements\n\nor to grant a continuance of the hearing. The court issued declaratory relief finding\n\nfederal due process violations and awarded nominal damages ($1). (U.S. Const., 14th\n\nAmend. [due process clause]; Mathews v. Eldridge (1976) 424 U.S. 319 (Mathews).)\n\nHowever, CYAC's alternative California Constitution due process causes of action were\n\nfound to lack merit. (Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7(a), 19 [due process and takings clauses].)\n\n       After trial, the court ordered the City to pay substantial attorney fees to CYAC\n\n($1,906,516.75) and to the Interested Parties ($84,652.50). The court had initially\n\ndetermined that their requests were untimely filed, but that discretionary relief from\n\ndefault should be granted to entertain the fees motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702;\n\nall further rule references are to the California Rules of Court; Code Civ. Proc., § 473,\n\n1021.5; 42 U.S.C. § 1988; Gov. Code, § 6259, subd. (d).)\n\n       The City appeals the judgment and in the consolidated appeal (D061141), the fee\n\norders. CYAC has filed a cross-appeal of a portion of the underlying findings on the\n\nreverse validation decision (to challenge the trial court's ruling regarding economic\n\nblight, that City-wide crime data was correctly considered by the City, rather than just\n\nproject-wide data). (§ 33031, subd. (b)(7); CYAC does not cross-appeal the dismissal of\n\nits California Constitution claims.)\n\n       CYAC has also cross-appealed on a timeliness issue regarding its attorney fees\n\nrequest, since the trial court granted CYAC and the Interested Parties discretionary relief\n\n                                              5\n\ffrom the untimely filing, then awarded fees. However, CYAC contends there was no late\n\nfiling in the first place that gave rise to any such need for such relief. (Rule 3.1702; Code\n\nCiv. Proc., § 473.)\n\n       In a previous order, we granted in part and denied in part the City's judicial notice\n\nrequest, to permit additional materials on the attorney fee questions to be considered on\n\nappeal. (See part V, post.)3\n\n       On the merits of the appeal and cross-appeal, first, our review of the\n\nadministrative record persuades us that the trial court's reverse validation order is well\n\nsupported by the facts and the law, concerning the CRL violations of sections 33352 and\n\n33457.1 (map requirement and description of specific, quantifiable evidence supporting\n\nthe blight findings). Although the Legislature abolished redevelopment agencies through\n\nits 2011 legislation, the issues regarding the invalidity of this Amendment have not\n\nbecome moot by the passage of time or the subsequent legislative action, particularly as\n\nto the attorney fees awards. (§ 33037, subd. (c); California Redevelopment Assn. v.\n\nMatosantos (2011) 53 Cal.4th 231 (Matosantos) [discussed post].)\n\n       Next, on the trial record of the PRA issues, which includes both the administrative\n\nrecord and the trial exhibits and testimony, we uphold the judgment of the trial court\n\nissuing declaratory relief in favor of CYAC. Although we disagree with some of the\n\n\n\n3        We denied the City's judicial notice request on appeal of the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Studies of March 2005 (\"Brownfields\nStudies\") which previously studied contamination in the Amendment area. The trial\ncourt refused to include it as part of the administrative record, or to take judicial notice of\nit, or to admit that material as trial exhibit No. 501.\n                                               6\n\freasoning set forth in the statement of decision, the particular theory of the trial court is\n\nnot controlling, and it reached the correct result. (Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq.; D'Amico v.\n\nBoard of Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 18-19 (D'Amico).) We shall affirm the\n\ndeclaratory relief judgment on the reverse validation and PRA issues.\n\n       However, the judgment must be reversed in part with respect to the trial court's\n\nerroneous determination that as a matter of law, the City's proven statutory violations of\n\nthe CRL additionally amounted to an actionable deprivation of federal due process\n\nprotections, under the appropriate legal test. (Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. 319.)4 Although\n\nCYAC properly pursued its remedy in the reverse validation action, to challenge such a\n\nblight designation amendment within the statutory limitations period (only 90 days;\n\n§§ 33500 or 33501), at this point, CYAC or the Interested Parties still cannot show their\n\nessential property interests were actually or potentially affected at the level necessary to\n\nsatisfy the above-cited due process test.5 There was no eminent domain filing by the\n\nCity, nor had CYAC brought any inverse condemnation action, to crystallize its\n\n\n\n4       The Mathews procedural due process analysis requires the courts to consider (1)\nthe private interest affected by the official action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation\nof that interest through the procedures used, as well as the probable value of additional\nsafeguards; and (3) the Government's interest, including any administrative burden that\nadditional procedural requirements would entail. (Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. 319, 335.)\n\n5      Section 33500 now provides: \"(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law,\nincluding Section 33501, an action may be brought to review the validity of the adoption\nor amendment of a redevelopment plan at any time within 90 days after the date of the\nadoption of the ordinance adopting or amending the plan, if the adoption of the ordinance\noccurred prior to January 1, 2011.\" Subdivision (b) is similar for review of agency\nfindings. Section 33501 prescribes use of the validation statutes, Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 860 et seq., for such CRL challenges.\n                                               7\n\fimmediate property interests as protectable under federal due process standards during\n\nthis early stage redevelopment amendment proceeding. (Cambria Spring Co. v. City of\n\nPico Rivera (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1080, 1097-1098 (Cambria Spring Co.).)\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in part but reverse the grant of declaratory\n\nrelief on the due process theory, with directions to enter a different order. On the\n\nattorney fees issues, we find the trial court appropriately granted CYAC and the\n\nInterested Parties discretionary relief from any applicable filing deadlines for their fees\n\nrequest, but we reverse the orders awarding such fees and costs to the extent that they\n\nincorrectly relied upon Title 42 United States Code section 1988 or Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 1021.5 (the due process conclusions). Upon remand, the trial court\n\nshall reevaluate the extent to which such an award of fees and costs continues to be\n\njustified in light of the remaining statutory grounds for relief that we upheld in this\n\nopinion, in accordance with the principles of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and\n\nGovernment Code section 6259.\n\n                      BACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n\n               A. Ordinance and Complaint; Prior Appeal on Publication\n\n       In broad outline, with more specialized facts to be added in the discussion portion\n\nof this opinion, the City's 1995 redevelopment plan and its amendments (the plan)\n\nauthorized the use of eminent domain in the area where the CYAC and Interested Parties'\n\nproperties are located, based on designations of blight. (§ 33037, subd. (c).) There are\n\n692 parcels in the overall 300-acre Amendment area. On its parcel, CYAC operates a\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fboxing gym and athletic facility that serves at-risk youth as a community center. The\n\nInterested Parties and their lessees conduct business on their property.\n\n       As proposed, the 2007 Amendment reduced the area subject to eminent domain\n\nand restricted its use on residential properties, and focused on two business corridors\n\n(Civic Center Drive and National City Boulevard) and the harbor district area, where\n\nsome environmental contamination existed due to previous industrial uses there. The\n\nCity sought to amend the plan to extend the time for eminent domain proceedings to be\n\nconducted under redevelopment powers until 2017. The City was interested in allowing\n\nthe construction of condominium developments in the designated area, as a\n\nredevelopment measure.\n\n       In preparation for amending the plan, the City's Commission hired the consulting\n\nfirm of RSG, an independent contractor, to prepare reports required under the CRL. RSG\n\nassisted the Commission (sometimes designated the agency) in preparing and publishing\n\nthe initial notice of the public hearings on the Amendment, both through mail notice to\n\ntaxing agencies and through newspaper publication. From February 2007 to June 2007,\n\nRSG was in the process of drafting its report to the council (the RTC) on the need for the\n\nAmendment. RSG's contract with the City's Commission provided that this agency\n\nwould have the property rights to the memoranda, reports, maps, drawings, plans,\n\nspecifications and other documents prepared by RSG for the project, and all of these\n\nwould be turned over to the agency upon completion of the project.\n\n       On April 17, 2007, a hearing was held by the City Council to adopt a resolution to\n\nauthorize circulation and public review of the Amendment, and to set a public hearing for\n\n                                             9\n\fJune 19, 2007 to consider adoption of the Amendment. The Council's agenda statement\n\nattached a map indicating the boundary around the parcels that would be subject to the\n\nAmendment (the \"boundary parcel map\").\n\n      In May 2007, notice of the June hearing was mailed to all affected tax agencies,\n\nand to all affected property owners, businesses and residents. The same boundary parcel\n\nmap that was attached to the April 17, 2007 Council Agenda Statement was also provided\n\nwith the May 11, 2007 mailing.\n\n      In May 2007, CYAC retained expert witnesses to oppose the Amendment and\n\nbegan the process of requesting numerous documents that related in any way to the\n\nproposed amendment for the project area, which included CYAC. On May 23, it sought\n\n\"Any and all blight studies that have been performed that specifically deal with National\n\nCity Boulevard and its surrounding areas or any other blight studies that have been\n\nperformed for National City since 2000. Please include any documents that show the\n\nactual areas the City or CDC included in conducting the blight study. [¶] Any and all\n\nblight studies the CDC or City will rely on in support of the redevelopment plan or\n\neminent domain proceedings.\" CYAC's May 23 request relied upon the federal Freedom\n\nof Information Act (FOIA). (5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq.)6\n\n      City staff members responded to CYAC that such a \"blight study\" was also called\n\nthe RTC, and that the City planned to make it and other reports available approximately\n\n\n6      Judicial interpretations of the FOIA in the federal courts may be used to construe\nthe PRA. (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; American Civil\nLiberties Union of Northern California v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 68\n(ACLU).)\n                                            10\n\fthree days before the public hearing, pursuant to the standards of the Brown Act. (Gov.\n\nCode, § 54954.2, subd. (a).)\n\n       In June 2007, the City published three weekly notices in local newspapers, to give\n\nnotice of the upcoming June 19, 2007 public hearing. On June 14, 2007, three business\n\ndays before the hearing, the City released to the public for review its 37-page RTC\n\nrecommending adoption of the Amendment. The RTC detailed in writing different types\n\nof blight conditions that it found were remaining in the Amendment area, and stated it\n\nhad relied on six major sources in that analysis and assessment, including \"the April 2007\n\nfield survey by RSG,\" and \"Information from the National City police department.\" The\n\nRTC concluded that such blight could not be eliminated without the use of eminent\n\ndomain.\n\n       The RTC referred in passing to 2005 findings by the United States Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (the Brownfields Studies) about environmental contamination existing\n\nin part of the Amendment area. (See fn. 3, ante.) No map was attached to the RTC made\n\navailable to the public, to show where in the project any particular blighting conditions\n\nexisted. (See fns. 1, 2, ante, text of CRL statutes requiring such a map.)\n\n       On June 15, 2007, CYAC sent three PRA requests to the City, referencing the\n\nsame boundary parcel map that had been attached to the April 17, 2007 council agenda\n\nand the City's notice of hearing. On June 17, 2007, CYAC, represented by a law firm,\n\nthe Institute of Justice, sent a letter to the City objecting to the Amendment on various\n\nstatutory and constitutional grounds.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       At the June 19, 2007 public hearing, the City Council heard opposition from\n\nCYAC and the Interested Parties and other citizens to the adoption of the Amendment.\n\nCYAC filed 34 pages of written objections to the Amendment. CYAC obtained\n\npermission from the City to file its six-volume appendix in opposition to the plan. The\n\nCity denied CYAC's request for a continuance of the hearing, but allowed its additional\n\nwritten objections to be received after the hearing.\n\n       In July 2007, the City Council approved a negative declaration for the\n\nAmendment, and prepared written responses to written objections to the Amendment, as\n\nfiled by members of the public.\n\n       On July 10, 2007, the City provided to the public four maps of the Amendment\n\narea showing the different types of blighting conditions on which it relied as justification\n\nfor the Amendment (i.e., structural obsolescence, incompatible adjacent uses,\n\ndeterioration and dilapidation, or defective design without parking). (§ 33352, subd. (b).)\n\nOn July 17, 2007, the ordinance approving the Amendment was adopted, incorporating\n\nby reference documents contained in earlier studies.7\n\n       After several more PRA requests and much further communication, discussion,\n\nclarification, and objections taking place between June and August 2007, the City\n\n\n7       In the reply brief, the City, after first admitting in the opening brief that no map\nwas attached to the council's copy of the RTC in June 2007, now contends that the\nboundary parcel map was timely provided to the council. This was the same boundary\nparcel map that had been provided with the May 2007 mailed notice to taxing agencies\nand property owners. However, it is still not disputed that the more detailed maps later\nprovided in July 2007, identifying the four types of claimed blighting conditions, were\nnot attached to the RTC when it was made available to the council or the public June 14,\n2007.\n                                             12\n\fsupplied at least three additional sets of informational documents to CYAC. (See pts. II,\n\nIII, post.)\n\n        In September 2007, CYAC brought this action seeking a judicial declaration that\n\nthe Amendment was invalid on a number of specific grounds, including noncompliance\n\nwith the procedures of the CRL. In particular, its first, fifth, and sixth causes of action\n\nalleged that the City failed to release or complete its reports or maps on the matter in a\n\ntimely fashion, thus preventing the public from preparing any effective objections to the\n\nproposed Amendment, or from obtaining documents related to the required substantial\n\nevidence of existing blight and alleviation of blight through the proposed redevelopment.\n\n        In its second cause of action alleging violations of federal constitutional\n\nprotections, CYAC contended it was deprived of procedural due process of law affecting\n\nthe proposed use of its property (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.). In its third and fourth\n\ncauses of action alleging state constitutional violations, CYAC claimed the eminent\n\ndomain law was being used for constitutionally illegitimate purposes, such as economic\n\ndevelopment or increasing tax revenue. All these constitutional claims were alleged\n\nseparately from the statutory causes of action. The prayer requested a declaration that the\n\nCity had violated CYAC's procedural due process rights to a meaningful opportunity to\n\nbe heard, and it sought invalidation of the ordinance and other relief (injunction and\n\ndamages).\n\n        In its seventh cause of action, CYAC sought to compel the City to disclose\n\nnumerous public records relied on by the City to support the blight designations\n\nunderlying the Amendment. (PRA, Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq.)\n\n                                              13\n\f       As explained in two prior opinions issued by this court, CYAC obtained a court\n\norder through noticed ex parte proceedings for the publication of the summons, which\n\nwas directed toward the City and to \"All Persons Interested in the Matter of the\n\nAmendment to National City's Redevelopment Plan as Adopted by [the ordinance].\"\n\n(Community Youth Athletic Center v. City of National City (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 416\n\n(our prior opinion); Community Youth Athletic Center v. Superior Court (Feb. 18, 2009,\n\nD052630) [nonpub. opn.] [reversing the judgment on the separate PRA petition; some\n\nfacts stated here have been adapted from those opinions].) CYAC encountered\n\ndifficulties with the publication process in English and Spanish newspapers, when one of\n\nthe newspapers unexpectedly changed its publication schedule, and ultimately, the\n\nsummons that was published after some delay retained an incorrect date for responses by\n\nany interested parties (i.e., the published summons contained the date for response as\n\noriginally anticipated, thus advancing the allowable response period following\n\npublication, from Monday, Nov. 19 to Friday, Nov. 16, 2007). (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 861,\n\n861.1, 863 [part of the Validation Act].)\n\n       The City then moved for judgment on the pleadings on all causes of action,\n\nclaiming defective publication. The trial court ruled in favor of the City, and CYAC\n\nappealed. We reversed, allowing republication and further notice proceedings.\n\n                     B. Renewed Litigation After 2009 Prior Appeal\n\n       Back on track, the parties negotiated the contents of the administrative record, for\n\npurposes of litigating the reverse validation issues. The administrative record was lodged\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fwith the trial court in February 2011. The Interested Parties were granted leave to appear\n\nand respond, pleading similar theories.8\n\n       Extensive motion practice continued, in which CYAC pursued a motion for\n\nsummary adjudication on the PRA claims, opposed by the City. The court denied the\n\nmotion, ruling that there were remaining disputed material facts about whether the raw\n\ndata regarding the blight studies created by the private consultant, RSG, constituted\n\npublic records subject to disclosure.\n\n       Discovery disputes ensued, followed by motions to compel production of records\n\nor quash subpoenas. The City pursued a summary adjudication motion on the CYAC\n\nconstitutional claims, both federal and state. Opposition was filed. The court denied the\n\nmotion, ruling that the City could not establish on the undisputed evidence that CYAC\n\nhad been afforded sufficient notice and documentation of the blight conditions to satisfy\n\ndue process standards. The court relied on the test in Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. 319, and\n\nstated \"what passes muster for constitutional due process is fact dependent.\" The court\n\nalso ruled that the City had not yet established whether the two California constitutional\n\nclaims, alleging wrongful taking of property, were totally without merit, since CYAC\n\nwas also alleging that the process of adopting the redevelopment plan and blight\n\ndesignation was commenced for improper purposes.\n\n\n\n\n8       In their reply brief, the Interested Parties state they are responding to the City's\nappeal only on the reverse validation and attorney fees issues. Their responsive pleading\nis in the nature of a cross-complaint that asserts CRL violations. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 863.)\n                                             15\n\f       In preparation for trial, the City sought to sever the PRA issues, but the court\n\ndenied the motion. It had become known that the City's consultant RSG had routinely\n\npurged its records after completing the RTC, and had not retained copies of the raw data\n\nin the form of its field survey spreadsheets that were compiled by staff persons who\n\nwalked the area to be covered by the Amendment, as they investigated physical blighting\n\nconditions.\n\n       Back in May 2007, the City police department's crime analyst sent RSG a chart\n\ncontaining three years of crime data (the \"three-year chart\") which RSG used to prepare a\n\ntable of crime rates from 2006 for the RTC. However, the raw data used by the City's\n\nanalyst to prepare the three-year chart was no longer available.\n\n       CYAC brought a motion seeking an order for sanctions for alleged spoliation of\n\nboth kinds of that \"critical evidence.\" The City filed opposition. The court denied the\n\nmotions, ruling there was no evidence from which the court could reasonably infer\n\nintentional or willful conduct by City agents or employees to destroy either the raw data\n\nused by the consultant (field surveys) or any background data compiled by the City police\n\ndepartment (crime statistics).\n\n       Trial briefs and motions in limine were filed, as well as motions for judicial notice.\n\nIn limine, the court ruled that with respect to the reverse validation claims, review was\n\nlimited to the administrative record.9 However, on the PRA and constitutional issues,\n\n\n\n9      Apparently, neither the crime table referred to in the RTC, or the three-year chart\nthat had been supplied to RSG for study, was actually included in the RTC or in the\nadministrative record. However, the RTC discusses its conclusions, and the three-year\n                                             16\n\ftestimony and trial exhibits going beyond the administrative record were allowed to be\n\npresented, and a lengthy bench trial took place. The parties requested a statement of\n\ndecision and prepared drafts.\n\n          C. 2011 Statement of Decision and Judgment; Attorney Fees Awards\n\n       In its April 20, 2011 statement of decision, the trial court found on the reverse\n\nvalidation claims that the City's lack of compliance with CRL requirements resulted in a\n\nlack of support for the Amendment, due to the failure to include the required map\n\nattachment in the RTC. (§ 33352, subd. (b).) Additionally, the court ruled the\n\nadministrative record did not contain \"specific, quantifiable evidence about the location\n\nand prevalence of the alleged blighting conditions,\" to show a serious physical and\n\neconomic burden on the community, as required by section 33030, subdivision (b)(1) and\n\nsection 33352, subdivision (b)(2). Even though the RTC and administrative record\n\ncontained \"substantial evidence\" of one condition of economic blight (using crime\n\nstatistics City-wide), they still \"did not have substantial evidence of at least one condition\n\nof physical blight.\" (§ 33031, subds. (a), (b).) Thus, even if some blight conditions\n\nexisted in the Amendment area, the administrative record did not contain substantial\n\nevidence that there were substantial and prevalent amounts of blighting conditions, or\n\nthat any such conditions could not be eliminated without the use of eminent domain.\n\n(§ 33333.2, subd. (a)(4).) Declaratory relief was issued invalidating the Amendment.\n\n\nchart submitted to RSG by the police department was admitted as an exhibit at trial. The\ncourt also granted CYAC's request to augment the administrative record, to include fire\ndispatch reports previously requested to be produced. However, the court denied a\nCYAC request to augment the record with certain evidentiary presumptions.\n                                             17\n\f       On the PRA, the trial court's key findings were (a) both forms of raw data relied\n\non by the RTC and the City, the property-by-property field surveys conducted by RSG\n\nand the property-by-property crime data for three years before the PRA request was\n\nmade, constituted public records; (b) CYAC's various PRA requests were not unduly\n\nbroad or vague, and thus (c) the City did not undertake a reasonable search for the\n\nrequested information, nor carry its burden of showing that it justifiably withheld public\n\nrecords that were in the possession of its consultant, RSG, or in the possession of its\n\npolice department when the requests were made. Specifically, \"The Court holds that a\n\nreasonable search requires the agency to: (1) ask the known custodian of records for (2)\n\nthe documents requested in the PRA request.\" (Italics added.) Thus, the court impliedly\n\nfound that the City should have conveyed to the consultant the same request language\n\nthat CYAC sent to the City. Although the court stated the City staff members had\n\ndemonstrated evident neglect of their duties, the court was \"not convinced that the\n\nviolations of the PRA were intentional or that the City refused to attempt to obtain\n\ndocuments from its consultant.\" The court issued declaratory relief finding such\n\nviolations of the PRA, but denied any injunctive relief, on the basis there was no showing\n\nof any need for prospective relief.\n\n       Regarding federal due process, the trial court made a series of rulings. First, the\n\nCity was found to have violated \"CYAC's right to procedural due process under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment with respect to its failure to timely provide the maps with the\n\nRTC, which were required by statute.\" (Italics added.) The trial court determined that\n\nthe \"City's decision to provide CYAC with the RTC only three business days before the\n\n                                             18\n\fpublic hearing, and at that time its failure to provide any underlying data and without the\n\nrequired maps, created an unreasonable risk of erroneous deprivation,\" denying CYAC its\n\nprocedural due process rights. The trial court also concluded, \"at a minimum, a\n\ncontinuance of the public hearing upon request was required.\"\n\n       In its federal due process findings, the trial court continued: \"The evidence in this\n\ncase presents a troubling picture where the [City] appears to have intentionally provided\n\nnotices and scheduled all of the public hearings so as to provide as little time as possible\n\nto meaningfully prepare any opposition. The RTC itself was vaguely written.\" The City\n\nhad compounded this process by failing to provide the statutorily required maps with the\n\nRTC, by failing to respond promptly to PRA requests for crime data and property survey\n\ninformation, by unjustifiably claiming the survey data were not public records, and by\n\nfailing to secure that information during litigation to prevent it from being destroyed.\n\n(§ 33352, subd. (b).)\n\n       However, to the extent that CYAC seemed to be making a constitutional challenge\n\nto section 33457.1 (either facially or as applied), the trial court found that the notice and\n\naccess to the RTC as provided by the City, pursuant to that section, did not create a\n\nfurther or broader denial of due process. (See fn. 2, ante.) Essentially, the court found\n\nthe City had substantially complied with the notice requirements of section 33452, and\n\nCYAC had been able to protect its rights and to prepare and submit extensive opposition\n\nto the Amendment, based upon its own investigation and the material made known to it.\n\n       The court thus declined to make a broad finding that any particular number of\n\nweeks or months of access to the RTC must have been provided to the public by the City,\n\n                                              19\n\fpursuant to the terms of section 33457.1. Declaratory relief and $1 in nominal damages\n\nwere awarded to CYAC. With respect to the claims under the California Constitution,\n\nthe court found them to be premature due to the lack of any eminent domain proceedings\n\nthat had been initiated by the City. Judgment was issued in favor of CYAC.\n\n       Following requests for prevailing party attorney fees and costs by CYAC and the\n\nInterested Parties, the trial court granted them relief from default for late filing pursuant\n\nto Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), based on its interpretation of rule\n\n3.1702 and related provisions. (Rules 8.104, 8.108.) The court ruled on the merits that\n\nboth CYAC and the Interested Parties were entitled to attorney fees awards under several\n\nstatutory provisions, including Title 42 United States Code section 1988, Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 1021.5 and Government Code section 6259, subdivision (d). (Further\n\ndetails will be set forth in pt. V, post.)\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n                                               I\n\n                      OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTORY REMARKS\n\n       We will set forth the respective standards of review and statutory schemes as we\n\ndiscuss, in turn, the grant of declaratory relief on the reverse validation issues about CRL\n\nprocedural protections for such a redevelopment plan amendment, and the application of\n\nthe PRA standards in this factual and legal context. (Pts. II, III, post.) We can then\n\naddress the propriety of the declaratory relief issued on the federal due process issues, as\n\nwell as the attorney fees issues, both on the appeal and cross-appeal. (Pts. IV, V, post.)\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       In all of our analyses, we are mindful that in its 2011 legislation (§§ 34170 et seq.,\n\n34161 et seq.), the Legislature prospectively abolished all redevelopment agencies,\n\nreallocated their funding, and delegated their work to successor agencies. In Matosantos,\n\nsupra, 53 Cal.4th 231, our Supreme Court held that because the Legislature had created\n\nredevelopment agencies in the CRL, it had the power to dissolve those agencies through\n\nsubsequent legislation. (11 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2012-2013 supp.),\n\n§ 30B:0.10, pp. 45-46.)10 Accordingly, this exact form of redevelopment method of\n\ncondemnation will not be pursued by a City commission that no longer exists. (§ 33037,\n\nsubd. (c); California Redevelopment Association v. Matosantos II (2013) 212\n\nCal.App.4th 1457, 1485 [issues on the existing obligations or duties of redevelopment\n\nagencies before their dissolution are not moot, where successor agencies have taken over\n\ntheir functions].) The briefs on appeal have only minimally addressed this dramatic legal\n\ndevelopment.11\n\n       We are required to review the existing ordinances and redevelopment actions in\n\nthe time frame in which they were conducted, in this case, 2007. (See County of Los\n\n\n\n10     On another point, the Court in Matosantos, supra, 53 Cal.4th 231 invalidated a\nprovision that would have provided for the continuation of redevelopment agencies if the\nlocal governing body agreed to make substantial payments to fund education and other\nfunctions. (Id. at pp. 274-276.)\n\n11     Formerly, redevelopment agencies addressed problems of urban blight using\n\"three extraordinary powers--the diversion of property taxes that otherwise would have\ngone to the state or other government entities; the use of public funds to subsidize private\nenterprise; and the power of eminent domain.\" (Neilson v. City of California City (2007)\n146 Cal.App.4th 633, 642; Evans v. City of San Jose (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1123, 1131\n(Evans).)\n                                             21\n\fAngeles v. Glendora Redevelopment Project (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 817, 832\n\n(Glendora).) We do not speculate what action the City may take in the future to pursue\n\nany eminent domain powers based on blight designations within the area affected by the\n\nAmendment. In any case, the eminent domain powers controlled by Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 1230.010 et seq. were not directly affected by the 2011 redevelopment\n\nlegislation. (§ 33037, subd. (c).) The attorney fees issues raised in this appeal serve to\n\nkeep these validation and related issues alive, despite the major changes in\n\nredevelopment law.\n\n       Our review of the judgment is conducted in view of the trial court's issuance of a\n\ndetailed statement of decision that addressed each of the above-described substantive\n\nareas. When reviewing a judgment based on such a statement of decision, \"any conflict\n\nin the evidence or reasonable inferences to be drawn from the facts will be resolved in\n\nsupport of the determination of the trial court decision.\" (In re Marriage of Hoffmeister\n\n(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 351, 358.) The ultimate facts found in the court's statement of\n\ndecision necessarily include findings on the intermediate evidentiary facts that sustain\n\nthem. (Muzquiz v. City of Emeryville (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1125.)\n\n       Although the statement of decision reveals the basis for the judgment, all of its\n\nreasoning is not treated as binding on an appellate court. (D'Amico, supra, 11 Cal.3d 1,\n\n18-19.) To the extent the record presents an undisputed or established set of facts, the\n\ninterpretation and application of a statutory scheme to those facts are treated as questions\n\nof law and are subject to de novo review on appeal. (Blue v. City of Los Angeles (2006)\n\n137 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1140 (Blue).) With regard to validation proceedings, the\n\n                                             22\n\fundisputed set of facts is to be measured against the standards set by those statutes. (Katz\n\nv. Campbell Union High School Dist. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1024, 1031 (Katz).) This\n\nappellate court is not bound by the trial court's statutory interpretations. (Blue, supra, at\n\np. 1140; California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. (1981) 28\n\nCal.3d 692, 699.)\n\n       Essentially, these parties do not dispute that the trial court correctly stated each of\n\nthe statutory standards for deciding the claims under the CRL and PRA regulatory\n\nschemes, but they each challenge portions of the trial court's interpretation and\n\napplication of those standards to the facts as established by the evidence, and they also\n\nargue the sufficiency of that evidence. (Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th 817, 835-836\n\n[administrative record must contain substantial proof of essential statutory criteria].)\n\nWhen the trial court applied federal procedural due process standards to that same set of\n\nestablished facts, it stated it was doing so narrowly and was rejecting CYAC's broader\n\nrequested ruling. With respect to each of the operative components of the judgment, our\n\ntask on appeal is to independently construe the statutory protections and evaluate the\n\nsufficiency of the supporting evidence for the legal conclusions reached. With those\n\ncaveats, we turn to the substantive questions presented.\n\n                                              II\n\n                    REVERSE VALIDATION DECLARATORY RELIEF\n\n                                A. Validation Law and CRL\n\n       Under section 33501, CRL litigation may be framed as validation or reverse\n\nvalidation actions. These actions promote the important public policy of securing a\n\n                                              23\n\fspeedy determination of the validity of certain actions taken by a public agency.\n\n(McLeod v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1156, 1166-1167\n\n(McLeod); Code Civ. Proc., § 860 et seq.) Such in rem proceedings require notice to all\n\nthose persons potentially interested in the issues of public interest presented (here,\n\nredevelopment and eminent domain). (Katz, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th 1024, 1028.) Under\n\nCode of Civil Procedure section 866, \"[t]he court hearing the action shall disregard any\n\nerror, irregularity, or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\"\n\n       \" 'The scope of judicial review of an agency's decision to adopt a redevelopment\n\nplan is quite limited. Both the trial court and this court review the administrative record\n\nto determine whether the findings and decision of the legislative body are supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.' [Citations.] Appellate 'review is done independent of any\n\ndeterminations made by the superior court.' [Citations.] [¶] In examining the\n\nadministrative record, we resolve all ' \"reasonable doubts\" ' and 'accept all reasonable\n\ninferences supporting the administrative findings.' [Citation.] 'The fact that different\n\ninferences or conclusions could be drawn, or that different methods of gathering and\n\ncompiling statistics could have been employed, is not determinative in a substantial\n\nevidence review.' \" (Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th 817, 835-836.)\n\n       On appeal, this court independently \" 'determine[s] the law applicable to the facts\n\nin the administrative record' in assessing whether the statutory requirements have been\n\nmet. [Citations.]\" (Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th 817, 836.) We review de novo the\n\nlegal issues involving the interpretation and application of statutes. (Ibid., citing Blue,\n\nsupra, 137 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1140.) We confine this review to the issues presented by\n\n                                              24\n\fthe administrative record, without use of the additional evidence presented at trial. (See\n\nGlendora, supra, at pp. 828-831, 835.)\n\n       To review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's conclusions\n\ninvalidating the Amendment, we are guided by the CRL sections outlining the\n\ncharacteristics of blighted areas that give rise to a need for redevelopment. \"[A]n area is\n\nblighted, and hence eligible for redevelopment, if it is predominantly urban and if it is\n\nadversely affected by economic and physical conditions too serious to be cured by private\n\nor governmental enterprise, thus necessitating redevelopment.\" (County of Riverside v.\n\nCity of Murrieta (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 616, 624-625 (Riverside).)\n\n       In 2006, the Legislature made important, applicable changes in the redevelopment\n\nlaw, imposing more restrictions on the definitions and proof of blighting conditions.\n\n(Glendora, 185 Cal. App. 4th 817 at p. 832.) Section 33030 refers, inter alia, to the\n\ndefinitions of conditions that cause physical blight (§ 33031 (subd. (a)), and economic\n\nblight (§ 33031, subd. (b)). Formerly, section 33031, subdivisions (a)(1) and (2) each\n\ncontained general language allowing \"other similar factors\" to be used to support a\n\nphysical blight designation, but in 2006, the Legislature removed that general language.\n\nThe Legislature also added language to section 33352 that required \"specific [and]\n\nquantifiable evidence\" to document alleged blight conditions to be included in the reports\n\nprepared for the legislative body, here, the City Council.12 The same reports and\n\n\n\n12    As part of the 2006 amendments, section 33352 was amended to add the italicized\nlanguage, showing a more restrictive approach to documenting blight: \"Every\nredevelopment plan submitted by the agency to the legislative body shall be accompanied\n                                             25\n\finformation required by section 33352 must, under section 33457.1, be made available to\n\nthe public prior to the redevelopment amendment hearing.13\n\n       Under section 33333.2, subdivision (a)(4), the 12-year time limitation for eminent\n\ndomain ordinance authorizations may be extended only by amendment of the\n\nredevelopment plan after the agency finds, based on substantial evidence, both of the\n\nfollowing: \"(A) That significant blight remains within the project area. [¶] (B) That this\n\nblight cannot be eliminated without the use of eminent domain.\" (Italics added.) Given\n\nthe nature of the amendment to the redevelopment plan, new blight findings were\n\nwarranted and required by section 33457.1. (Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 1149;\n\nBoelts v. City of Lake Forest (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 116, 120-121.) \" 'Tangible proof\n\nwhich can be scrutinized in a meaningful way,' \" is required. (Glendora, supra, 185\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 836.)\n\n\nby a report containing all of the following: [¶] (b) A description of the physical and\neconomic conditions specified in Section 33031 that exist in the area that cause the\nproject area to be blighted. The description shall include a list of the physical and\neconomic conditions described in Section 33031 that exist within the project area and a\nmap showing where in the project the conditions exist. The description shall contain\nspecific, quantifiable evidence that documents both of the following: [¶] (1) The physical\nand economic conditions specified in Section 33031. [¶] (2) That the described physical\nand economic conditions are so prevalent and substantial that, collectively, they\nseriously harm the entire project area.\" (Stats. 2006, ch. 595, § 1(e), p. 3777; italics\nadded.)\n\n13      The historical and statutory notes provided with section 33030 further explain that\nin 2006, the Legislature also amended sections 33500 and 33501 with the intent to lower\nthe barriers for interested public members to challenge local officials' decisions regarding\nredevelopment and, in particular, to increase the opportunities for review of local\nofficials' findings regarding the conditions of blight. (Historical and Statutory Notes,\n41 West's Ann. Health & Saf. Code (2010 ed.) foll. § 33030, p. 451; Stats. 2006, ch. 595,\n§ 1(f), p. 3778; see due process discussion, pt.

CRL Rulings\n\n       Many of the topics in the trial court's detailed analysis of the various blight\n\nshowings regarding CYAC's reverse validation claims (first, fifth and sixth causes of\n\naction) are not directly discussed or attacked in this appeal and cross-appeal. We focus\n\non the two major defects that prevented enforceability of this Amendment, and that are\n\nchallenged on appeal: (1) the RTC omitted maps showing the location of blighting\n\nconditions that should have been made available before the time of the June 2007 public\n\nhearing under section 33352, subdivision (b) and section 33457.1; and (2) the\n\nadministrative record, overall, lacked \"specific, quantifiable evidence about the location\n\nand prevalence of the alleged blighting conditions\" under the definitions of section\n\n33352, subdivision (b) (referring in turn to § 33031), such that the administrative record\n\n\"did not have substantial evidence of at least one condition of physical blight.\"14 In\n\nparticular, the RTC had relied on the field surveys prepared by the consulting firm RSG,\n\nbut those field surveys had later been purged from their files and were not available for\n\nproduction by the City.\n\n\n14      Section 33031 subdivision (a) describes physical conditions that cause blight:\n\"(1) Buildings in which it is unsafe or unhealthy for persons to live or work. These\nconditions may be caused by serious building code violations, serious dilapidation and\ndeterioration caused by long-term neglect, construction that is vulnerable to serious\ndamage from seismic or geologic hazards, and faulty or inadequate water or sewer\nutilities. [¶] (2) Conditions that prevent or substantially hinder the viable use or capacity\nof buildings or lots. These conditions may be caused by buildings of substandard,\ndefective, or obsolete design or construction given the present general plan, zoning, or\nother development standards.\" (Note, no issues are raised here on additional subdivisions\nof § 33031, subd. (a)(3) regarding adjacent or nearby incompatible land uses; or\nsubd. (a)(4) regarding existence of subdivided lots in multiple ownership.)\n\n                                             27\n\f       Even though the trial court determined that the administrative record contained\n\n\"substantial evidence\" of one condition of economic blight (by using crime statistics\n\nCity-wide), the RTC still \"did not have substantial evidence of at least one condition of\n\nphysical blight.\" (§ 33031, subds. (a), (b).) And, even accepting that some blight\n\nconditions existed in the Amendment area, the court found the administrative record did\n\nnot contain substantial evidence that there were substantial and prevalent amounts of\n\nblighting conditions, or that they could not be eliminated without the use of eminent\n\ndomain. (§§ 33333.2, subd. (a)(4); 33030, subd. (b)(1); 33352, subd. (b)(2).)\n\n       In its cross-appeal, CYAC attacks the ruling there was some evidence of economic\n\nblight, claiming it was error for the trial court to use crime statistics City-wide. (§ 33031,\n\nsubd. (b)(7).)15 Rather, CYAC argues such economic conditions evidence is only\n\nrelevant project-wide under section 33352, subdivision (b), and it further complains that\n\nthe raw data underlying the crime statistics table referred to in the RTC (but left out) were\n\nnot produced by the City, even though the police department analyst possessed the raw\n\ndata at the time she prepared the three-year chart and sent it to RSG so it could prepare\n\nthe RTC and table. Since evidence of both types of conditions was required, the\n\nAmendment was invalidated, and we shall discuss the cross-appeal's economic blight\n\n\n\n\n15      Section 33031, subdivision (b) describes economic conditions that cause blight:\n\"(1) Depreciated or stagnant property values. [¶] (2) Impaired property values, due in\nsignificant part, to hazardous wastes on property where the agency may be eligible to use\nits [specified] authority . . . . [¶] . . . [¶] (7) A high crime rate that constitutes a serious\nthreat to the public safety and welfare.\"\n                                               28\n\fissues only if the trial court erred in its physical blight analysis. (§§ 33030, subd. (b);\n\n33333.2, subd. (a)(4).)\n\n                                    C. Analysis: Appeal\n\n                   1. Defects in Notice of Hearing and Issuance of RTC\n\n       Under sections 33457.1 and 33352, supporting reports and information must be\n\nprovided to the public before a redevelopment plan is amended, \"prior to the hearing,\"\n\nbut no time frame is stated. (Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 1144.) In that case, the\n\ncourt interpreted section 33352, subdivision (b), as not requiring the raw data regarding\n\nblight conditions to be included in the report or elsewhere in the administrative record,\n\n\"in order for a redevelopment plan to be found valid.\" (Blue, supra, at p. 1142.)\n\nHowever, the court in Blue was interpreting the previous version of that section, which\n\ndid not contain the recently added language requiring \"specific, quantifiable evidence that\n\ndocuments both of the following: [¶] (1) The physical and economic conditions specified\n\nin Section 33031. [¶] (2) That the described physical and economic conditions are so\n\nprevalent and substantial that, collectively, they seriously harm the entire project area.\"\n\n(§ 33352, subd. b; italics added.) More support is now required, but the City seems to\n\nhave been operating under the previous version of the law.\n\n       The requirements for the RTC containing an attached map showing blight\n\nconditions prior to the hearing were admittedly not met. However, the City appears to\n\nargue on appeal that the administrative record as a whole sufficiently and substantially\n\nsupports the Amendment, because this court should find it determinative that the original\n\nboundary parcel map was given to affected landowners with the notice of hearing, and\n\n                                              29\n\flater, four more detailed maps were provided to the public a week before the adoption of\n\nthe Amendment in July (showing the four alleged blighting conditions, under § 33031\n\ndefinitions).\n\n       In its related due process ruling, the trial court determined that the publication of\n\nthe RTC only three business days before the public hearing, and the failure by the City to\n\nprovide any underlying data or the required maps at that time, \"created an unreasonable\n\nrisk of erroneous deprivation\" of CYAC's procedural due process rights. In any case, the\n\ntrial court said that with respect to the validation claims, even if the late filed maps were\n\nconsidered, they still did not contain any substantial evidence \"that there is a substantial\n\namount of this blight or that this blight cannot be eliminated without the use of eminent\n\ndomain.\" (§ 33030, subd. (b).)\n\n       We reject the City's positions that it substantially complied with the CRL\n\nrequirements, or that overall, the administrative record supports the Amendment. First,\n\nunder section 33352, subdivision (b), regarding the provision of information by the\n\nredevelopment agency to the legislative body (City), the RTC was mandated to include\n\nthe following: a description of the physical and economic blighting conditions in the\n\nproject area, including \"a map showing where in the project the conditions exist.\" This\n\ndescription shall contain \"specific, quantifiable evidence\" documenting the conditions,\n\nand showing that the \"physical and economic conditions are so prevalent and substantial\n\nthat, collectively, they seriously harm the entire project area.\" (§ 33352, subd. (b).) The\n\nboundary parcel map originally sent out by the City with notice of the hearing, and\n\nprovided to the City Council in the RTC, did not show any such conditions. The maps\n\n                                              30\n\flater sent out to the public July 10, before the final approval of the Amendment on\n\nJuly 17, delineated the four types of conditions relied upon: structural obsolescence,\n\nincompatible adjacent uses, deterioration and dilapidation, and defective design without\n\nparking. (§ 33352, subd. (b); however, parking is now a relevant concern only with\n\nregard to development standards under § 33031, subd. (a)(2).) Some of these four\n\ncondition maps were apparently supported by the field surveys, which were unavailable\n\nto CYAC. (See also pt. III, post, PRA topic.)\n\n       With respect to the map requirement for the RTC, section 33457.1 additionally\n\nrequired that, \"To the extent warranted by a proposed amendment to a redevelopment\n\nplan . . . the reports and information required by Section 33352 shall be prepared and\n\nmade available to the public prior to the hearing on such amendment.\" (Italics added.)\n\nThus, the trial court was required to make a statutory interpretation of section 33457.1, to\n\nrule on the extent that this Amendment \"warranted\" disclosure of the information\n\nrequired by section 33352, and when. The court reasonably concluded that it was not\n\nenough, under this statutory restriction, for the City not to disclose that required\n\ninformation with maps until a week before the approval of the Amendment. Earlier, the\n\nCity had provided a different map and an incomplete RTC three business days before the\n\npublic hearing of June 19, but that was not enough to constitute substantial compliance\n\nwith either of those requirements.16\n\n\n\n16     In our discussion of the due process arguments on appeal (pt. IV, post), we will\naddress to the extent necessary CYAC's argument that we should judicially impose a time\ndeadline for disclosure of reports, as an interpretation of section 33457.1 (such as 60-90\n                                              31\n\f       The City relies on Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at page 1145, to argue that even\n\nthough the map was not timely provided nor a continuance granted, CYAC was able to\n\nprepare extensive opposition and objections, it could have conducted more of its own\n\ninvestigation, and thus it should not be deemed to have suffered any prejudice in\n\npreparing its opposition. However, the court could reasonably have concluded, and\n\nimpliedly did, that a more focused investigation would have been possible if the statutory\n\ncompliance had been forthcoming, with the use of a map identifying the location of the\n\nblighting conditions being relied upon in the RTC. We agree with the findings of the trial\n\ncourt that this sequence of events in the processing of the Amendment did not qualify as\n\nexcusable error that would permit validation of the Amendment, and it also did not\n\nconstitute such \"error, irregularity, or omission which does not affect the substantial\n\nrights of the parties,\" that accordingly could properly be \"disregarded\" by the court\n\nhearing the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 866.) The Interested Parties were similarly\n\nentitled to more specific descriptions of blight before the hearing.\n\n       We are supported in this conclusion by the legislative history of the 2006\n\namendments to the CRL showing, in relevant part, that more stringent definitions and\n\nquantifiable factual support for alleged conditions of economic and physical blight are\n\nnow required, so that interested public members are kept informed of potential\n\nredevelopment changes affecting them. (Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 832;\n\nHistorical and Statutory Notes, 41 West's Ann. Health & Saf. Code (2010 ed.) foll.\n\n\ndays). (But see Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 831 [such policy decisions are\ngenerally delegated to the Legislature, not the courts].)\n                                             32\n\f§ 33030, p. 451 [\"It is the intent of the Legislature, in amending Sections 33030,\n\n33031 . . . , 33352, 33367 . . . of the Health and Safety Code to restrict the statutory\n\ndefinition of blight and to require better documentation of local officials' findings\n\nregarding the conditions of blight. The legislative purpose of these statutory\n\namendments is to focus public officials' attention and their extraordinary redevelopment\n\npowers on properties with physical and economic conditions that are so significantly\n\ndegraded that they seriously harm the prospects for physical and economic development\n\nwithout the use of redevelopment.\" (Italics added.)].)17\n\n              2. Defects in Data Provided Under CRL Definitions of Blight\n\n       The trial court ruled the administrative record did not contain any substantial\n\n\"specific, quantifiable evidence about the location and prevalence of the alleged blighting\n\nconditions,\" under the definitions of section 33031, subdivision (a)(1), for physical blight.\n\nIn reaching these conclusions, the court adopted the approach set forth in Glendora,\n\nsupra, 185 Cal.App.4th at pages 835 through 836, and in Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at\n\npage 1147 and pages 1149 through 1150, that the meaning of \"significant\" remaining\n\nblight in an amended project area (as required for the use of redevelopment eminent\n\n\n\n17      Under section 33367, an amendment to the ordinance shall contain, inter alia: \"(d)\nThe findings and determinations of the legislative body, which shall be based on clearly\narticulated and documented evidence, that: [¶] (1) The project area is a blighted area, the\nredevelopment of which is necessary to effectuate the public purposes declared in this\npart. [¶] . . . [¶] (11) The elimination of blight and the redevelopment of the project area\ncould not be reasonably expected to be accomplished by private enterprise acting alone\nwithout the aid and assistance of the agency. [¶] . . . [¶] (14) The implementation of the\nredevelopment plan will improve or alleviate the physical and economic conditions of\nblight in the project area, as described in the report prepared pursuant to Section 33352.\"\n                                             33\n\fdomain powers under section 33333.2, subdivision (a)(4)), can be gleaned from the basic\n\ndefinitions of blight contained in sections 33030 and 33031. The court also correctly\n\nobserved that section 33352 now requires substantial evidence of specific quantification\n\nof blight conditions. (§ 33333.2, subd. (a)(4).) This was reflected in the 2006\n\namendments to the CRL, adding to section 33352, subdivision (b), this language: \"The\n\ndescription [in required reports on the proposed specific amendment/project] shall\n\ncontain specific, quantifiable evidence that documents both of the following: (1) The\n\nphysical and economic conditions specified in Section 33031. (2) That the described\n\nphysical and economic conditions are so prevalent and substantial that, collectively, they\n\nseriously harm the entire project area.\" (Italics added; Stats. 2006, ch. 595, § 7(b),\n\np. 3780.)\n\n       In its statement of decision, the court exhaustively analyzed the types of blighting\n\nphysical conditions set forth in the RTC and administrative record, under section 33031,\n\nsubdivision (a)(1): \"Buildings in which it is unsafe or unhealthy for persons to live or\n\nwork,\" and subdivision (a)(2) \"[c]onditions that prevent or substantially hinder the viable\n\nuse or capacity of buildings or lots.\" The missing RSG/City field surveys were not in the\n\nadministrative record, and the court criticized the City's overall showing on physical\n\nblight, such as duplicative photographic evidence that did not show the claimed serious\n\ndilapidation and deterioration of buildings, and that did not show the required nexus\n\nbetween the deterioration conditions and evidence showing that they rendered those\n\nbuildings unsafe or unhealthy. Consequently, those blight findings were not supported by\n\n\"tangible proof.\" (Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 836.) Indeed, the court found\n\n                                             34\n\fthe supporting \"evidence\" in the RTC for the City's claims of structural obsolescence to\n\nbe mainly jargon and conclusory statements, which failed to satisfy statutory\n\nrequirements. (Riverside, supra, 65 Cal.App.4th at p. 627.) The City does not\n\nadequately respond to those findings, mainly arguing instead that the Brownfields Studies\n\nshould have been admitted (as next discussed).\n\n       In Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at pages 1142 through 1143, the court discussed\n\npre-2006 CRL statutes and interpreted them as not expressly requiring raw data, such as\n\nfield surveys, to be provided to the public before an amendment hearing is held\n\n(§ 33457.1), nor requiring such data to be provided if referenced in the report to the\n\nlegislative body. (§ 33352.) In that case, the plaintiffs had been able to prepare adequate\n\nopposition, even without obtaining the raw data underlying the reports, and no prejudice\n\nto the substantial rights of those parties was found. (Code Civ. Proc., § 866.) Our case is\n\ndifferent, and the recent amendments to section 33352 undermine this portion of the\n\nholding of Blue because now, the Legislature has made clear that better documentation of\n\nblight conditions is required, and \"specific, quantifiable evidence\" of prevalent, serious\n\nblighting conditions harming the entire project area must now be presented to support\n\nsuch an amendment. This was not done here to meet the amended standards added to\n\nsection 33352, subdivision (b).\n\n                          3. Effect of Brownfields Studies Rulings\n\n       As previously stated, the trial court declined to admit trial exhibit No. 501 (2005\n\nBrownfields Studies), as evidence or as part of the administrative record, and it declined\n\nto take judicial notice of its contents. However, the trial court allowed the City in its\n\n                                             35\n\fclosing argument to discuss the effect of the mentions of the Brownfields Studies in the\n\nRTC, in terms of proof of economic blight conditions, and we briefly address those\n\nissues. (§ 33031, subd. (b); but see fn. 3, ante, regarding our denial of judicial notice of\n\nBrownfields Studies on appeal.)\n\n       In the briefs on appeal, the parties continue to dispute whether the Brownfields\n\nStudies were properly excluded, on either physical or economic blight issues. The City\n\ndid not show that the studies were part of the 2007 redevelopment decisional process, but\n\nargues they could have been considered, since they already existed, and it was possible\n\nthe hazardous conditions discussed in them regarding the harbor district (10 percent of\n\nthe project) were relevant. (See Franklin-McKinley School Dist. v. San Jose (1991) 234\n\nCal.App.3d 1599, 1606-1608 [allowing incorporation of a general plan into an\n\nadministrative record regarding redevelopment plan, because it was the city's underlying\n\ngeneral planning document].) However, the trial court denied the City's request to take\n\njudicial notice of them, reasoning that the City should be judicially estopped from relying\n\non the studies, because of its previous in limine motions excluding anything from the\n\nreverse validation proceedings that was not in the administrative record. The trial court\n\nwas justified in that discretionary ruling. (See Blix St. Records Inc. v. Cassidy (2010) 191\n\nCal.App.4th 39, 47.)\n\n       Even if the Brownfields Studies had been considered to be part of the\n\nadministrative record that supported an economic blight finding, (§ 33031, subd. (b)(2)\n\n[(hazardous wastes]), there was no still physical blight finding that was substantially\n\nsupported by quantifiable data. Also, the studies would not properly be judicially noticed\n\n                                             36\n\ffor their truth about blight issues. (Mangini v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994)\n\n7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063.) We find no error or abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision\n\nto exclude the Brownfields Studies from the administrative record, because they would\n\nnot have added materially to the City's demonstration of blight conditions.\n\n                         D. Analysis: Cross-Appeal on Economic Blight\n\n       To attack the trial court's economic blight \"erroneous ruling\" (§ 33031,\n\nsubd. (b)(7)), CYAC says the crime statistics relied on should have been only project-\n\nwide, not City-wide, under the language of section 33030, subdivision (b), as interpreted\n\nin cases such as Friends of Mammoth v. Town of Mammoth Lakes Redevelopment Agency\n\n(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 511, 555-556. (Also see § 33352, subd. (b) [referring to blight in\n\nthe \"project area.\"].)\n\n       We need not address this issue, because the issues previously discussed in\n\nconnection with the City's unsuccessful appeal of the reverse validation order are\n\ndispositive. There was no adequately supported condition of physical blight in the\n\nadministrative record, and for a valid Amendment, findings on both serious, significant\n\nremaining physical and economic blight, burdening the community and necessitating\n\nredevelopment, were required. (§§ 33030, subd. (b); 33333.2, subd. (a)(4).) There is no\n\nneed to resolve the additional claims in the cross-appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\f                                               III\n\n                                          PRA ISSUES\n\n                                        A. Introduction\n\n         As a separate and independent ground of the judgment, the trial court issued\n\ndeclaratory relief that the City violated PRA statutory standards, when the City did not\n\nproduce, upon request, some of the raw data that underlay the RTC conclusions and the\n\nenactment of the Amendment. The attorney fees awards against the City are based on\n\nprivate attorney general theories (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.5) and also a PRA provision\n\n(Gov. Code, § 6259, subd. (d)). There is some unavoidable overlap between these PRA\n\nissues and the CRL ruling that we have already discussed (pt. II, ante). Our review of the\n\nPRA ruling in favor of CYAC addresses the trial court's decision to issue declaratory\n\nrelief strictly as it is reflected in the terms of the judgment, not in all of its broadly stated\n\nreasoning in the statement of decision. (D'Amico, supra, 11 Cal.3d at p. 19; see fn. 8,\n\nante.)\n\n         The trial court ruled that both types of this underlying raw data constituted public\n\nrecords, (1) the property-by-property field surveys of the Amendment area (held and\n\nstored by the City's consultant, RSG, then destroyed), and (2) property-by-property crime\n\ndata for the three years prior to the PRA request (held by the City's police department's\n\ncrime analyst, and used by her to prepare the three-year chart that she sent to RSG for\n\ninclusion in the RTC; that underlying data was not found when requested). The court\n\nfound that the CYAC requests for such material, among 22 or more categories of records,\n\nover a period of two or three months, were reasonably clear, but the City had not\n\n                                               38\n\fresponded with reasonable searches and was not justified in failing to require that the\n\nknown custodians of the existing records should produce them. Injunctive relief was\n\ndenied because there was no prospective problem shown. (Gov. Code, § 6253.1.)\n\n       On appeal in these respects, the City protests that it produced numerous\n\ndocuments to CYAC and should not have been faulted for failing to additionally provide\n\nthe data its consultant discarded or the crime data, which it did not consider to be\n\nmeaningful to anyone outside its police department. Under Government Code\n\nsection 6253.1, the City has the duty to respond to requests for disclosure of the\n\ninformation in public records, including assisting the requester in formulating reasonable\n\nrequests, because of the City's superior knowledge about the contents of its records. The\n\nCity's duty requires it to communicate the scope of the information requested to the\n\ncustodians of its records, who may include private retained consultants, but the City need\n\nnot forward the exact language of a request, which may not have been accurate. (ACLU,\n\nsupra, 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 82-83.) No exact duplication or \"parroting\" of the precise\n\nlanguage of the requests by the agency to its known custodians is required, but the agency\n\nis obligated to make reasonable efforts toward clarification and production. (Id. at pp.\n\n85-86, fn. 16.)18 We agree with the trial court's analysis of the record that the evidence\n\ndemonstrated that the City's efforts fell short of that accepted standard.\n\n\n\n18     As will be discussed, the statement of decision imposes an overly broad\ninterpretation of the PRA, holding \"that a reasonable search requires the agency to:\n(1) ask the known custodian of records for (2) the documents requested in the PRA\nrequest.\" The PRA does not require an agency to convey to the custodian or consultant\nthe identical language of the request.\n                                             39\n\f                               B. PRA Law; CRL Context\n\n       The PRA defines \"public record\" as \"any writing containing information relating\n\nto the conduct of the public's business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or\n\nlocal agency.\" (Gov. Code, § 6252, subd. (e); italics added.) \"The definition is broad and\n\n' \" 'intended to cover every conceivable kind of record that is involved in the\n\ngovernmental process[.]' \" ' \" (Coronado Police Officers Assn. v. Carroll (2003) 106\n\nCal.App.4th 1001, 1006.) \"[A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the\n\nLegislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\" (Williams v. Superior Court (1993) 5\n\nCal.4th 337, 346; Gov. Code, § 6253, subd. (a).)\n\n       In Government Code section 6254, specific exceptions to the PRA's policy of\n\ndisclosure are enumerated, and in Government Code section 6255, a \"catch-all exception\"\n\nallows a governmental agency \"to withhold a record if it can demonstrate that 'on the\n\nfacts of a particular case the public interest served by not making the record public\n\nclearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.' \" (CBS, Inc. v.\n\nBlock (1986) 42 Cal.3d 646, 652; italics omitted.) Generally, \" 'exemptions are construed\n\nnarrowly, and the burden is on the public agency to show that the records should not be\n\ndisclosed.' \" (California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67\n\nCal.App.4th 159, 167 (California First Amendment Coalition).)\n\n       In Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th 1131, similar PRA issues arose in the context of a\n\nredevelopment agency reverse validation action. There the court confirmed that PRA\n\nrequests are a proper method for seeking information about the underlying raw data that\n\nwere utilized to support an agency's redevelopment decisions. The court also clarified\n\n                                             40\n\fthat \"the real 'raw data' was not the [field surveys], but rather, the existing conditions at\n\nthe properties in the project area,\" which could independently be observed by opponents\n\nof a blight designation. (Id. at p. 1144.) However, the 2006 amendments to the CRL,\n\nsection 33352, subdivision (b) now require more \"specific, quantifiable evidence\" in\n\nsupport of a blight designation than did the court in Blue, which was interpreting prior\n\nlaw. (See fn. 1, ante.)\n\n       In this case, we are presented not with a traditional claim of exemption of records,\n\nbut rather with a question of the reasonableness of a given set of requests and responses.\n\nUnder Government Code section 6253, subdivision (b), an agency has the duty to\n\nrespond to \"a request for a copy of records that reasonably describes an identifiable\n\nrecord or records . . . .\" Government Code section 6253, subdivision (c) allows the\n\nagency to determine whether the request, in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable\n\npublic records in its possession, and then to make them available within 10 days from\n\nreceipt of the request. Where more time is needed, to the extent reasonably necessary to\n\nthe proper processing of the particular request, that time limit may be extended by written\n\nnotice. (Ibid.) Government Code section 6253, subdivision (d), provides: \"Nothing in\n\nthis chapter shall be construed to permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or\n\ncopying of public records.\" In CBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d 646, 652, the court\n\nsaid such statutory exemptions \"are permissive, not mandatory. The Act endows the\n\nagency with discretionary authority to override the statutory exceptions when a\n\ndominating public interest favors disclosure.\"\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f       Government Code section 6253.1, subdivisions (a) and (b) set forth additional\n\nrequirements encouraging production of records, over those of Government Code section\n\n6253: \"(a) When a member of the public requests to inspect a public record or obtain a\n\ncopy of a public record, the public agency, in order to assist the member of the public\n\nmake a focused and effective request that reasonably describes an identifiable record or\n\nrecords, shall do all of the following, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances:\n\n[¶] (1) Assist the member of the public to identify records and information that are\n\nresponsive to the request or to the purpose of the request, if stated. [¶] (2) Describe the\n\ninformation technology and physical location in which the records exist. [¶] (3) Provide\n\nsuggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records or\n\ninformation sought. [¶] (b) The requirements of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) shall be\n\ndeemed to have been satisfied if the public agency is unable to identify the requested\n\ninformation after making a reasonable effort to elicit additional clarifying information\n\nfrom the requester that will help identify the record or records.\" (Italics added.)\n\nGovernment Code section 6253.1, subdivision (c) states these requirements are in\n\naddition to those of section 6253.\n\n       In a case in which an agency has deliberately withheld its public records,\n\nGovernment Code section 6255, subdivision (a) requires it to justify the same \"by\n\ndemonstrating that the record in question is exempt under express provisions of this\n\nchapter or that on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not\n\ndisclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the\n\nrecord.\"\n\n                                              42\n\f       Here, the trial court did not find there had been any deliberate withholding of\n\npublic records by the City. Rather, it ruled in connection with its due process holding\n\nthat there had been City neglect, indifference or inadvertence in conveying the requests to\n\nthe respective custodians of the records (field surveys and raw crime data). In the PRA\n\ncontext, we inquire into the scope of the searches as they were understood by each side.\n\nIn ACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 59, the court remarked, \"The scope of the search\n\nagencies are required . . . to undertake need only be reasonably calculated to locate\n\nresponsive documents [citation], and it is often not easy to say what is reasonable in the\n\ncircumstances. The difficulty in this area also arises from the fact that the scope of the\n\nsearch is determined by the scope of the request. Because the requestor may not know\n\nwhat documents or information of interest an agency possesses, he or she may be unable\n\nto provide the specificity an agency may require.\"\n\n       In this light, we examine the statutory requirements on a de novo basis, and then\n\nevaluate the record for any substantial evidence support for the trial court's conclusions.\n\n(San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. v. Superior Court (2011) 196\n\nCal.App.4th 1228, 1237, 1241-1242 [statutory interpretation issues are questions of law\n\nsubject to independent review, while the reviewing court accepts as true any trial court\n\nfindings of the \"facts of the particular case,\" where supported by substantial evidence];\n\nACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 66 [substantial evidence standard used for trial court\n\nfactual determinations].)\n\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f                          C. PRA Requests and City's Responses\n\n                 1. Background of RTC; Initial Production of Documents\n\n       The RTC stated it had relied on six major sources in the analysis and assessment\n\nof different types of blight conditions remaining in the Amendment area, including as\n\nrelevant here, \"the April 2007 field survey by RSG,\" and \"Information from the [City]\n\nPolice Department.\" From May through August 2007, CYAC requested many forms of\n\ndata in its numerous PRA requests to the City, for over 20 categories of documents.\n\nUpon receiving the notice to property owners of the June 19, 2007 hearing, CYAC's\n\nofficial Casillas informally and then on May 23 formally requested documents referenced\n\nin that notice, including a copy of the City's \"blight studies\" together with the \"negative\n\ndeclaration\" report and \"CDC's most recent report.\" In response to CYAC's May 23\n\nrequest, and others later, the City disclosed more than 1,200 pages of documents.19\n\n       On June 15, 2007, CYAC sent three separate PRA requests to the City: (1) its fire\n\ndepartment (regarding hazardous materials), (2) its building and safety department\n\n(regarding building code violations), and (3) its police department (regarding crime rates\n\nand \"a property-by-property breakdown of crime in the shaded area over the last three\n\nyears\"). Each of these sought \"any data provided to [RSG]\" or to the agency, and also\n\nreferred to \"the shaded area\" of the boundary parcel map sent out with the notice.\n\n\n\n19      CYAC made other PRA requests June 7, June 15 and June 29, but they are not\ndirectly involved in this appeal and need not be discussed in detail, except to note that\nCYAC used a broadsword approach, not the narrowly targeted one that its respondent's\nbrief represents occurred here. The Interested Parties did not participate in the PRA\ndisputes. (See fn. 8, ante.)\n                                             44\n\f       On July 27, 2007, CYAC's attorneys sent a lengthy status letter to the City\n\ndiscussing a number of the requests already made to the City. Although some responsive\n\nmaterials had been produced, the raw property-by-property survey data prepared by RSG\n\nhad not been provided and were again requested, along with other documents.\n\n       In its ruling, the trial court determined that the City's response to the May 23,\n\nJune 15 and July 27 requests violated the PRA because the City did not \"diligently search\n\nfor and produce\" the requested documents, that were known to exist and that were under\n\nthe control of its employees or its consultants. For purposes of this appeal, we need not\n\nsummarize all the PRA requests or responses, but focus upon the requests that are the\n\nsubject of this appeal, that pertain to the two types of raw data that were not provided, for\n\nvarious reasons.\n\n                                      2. Field Surveys\n\n       RSG's contract with the Commission gave that agency the property rights to the\n\nmemoranda, reports, maps, etc. prepared by RSG for the project, all of which was to be\n\nturned over to the agency upon completion of the project. RSG used software to process\n\ndata and to convert field studies from raw data into the documents submitted into the\n\nrecord. The field surveys of blight conditions prepared by RSG were referred to in the\n\nRTC as part of the methodology used in creating it. RSG used the 2005 field study as a\n\nbase and added the 2007 data to it, but it could not later determine what data had been\n\nadded from the 2007 field surveys.\n\n       In the June 15 Fire Department and Building Department requests, CYAC sought\n\n\"any data provided to [RSG]\" or to the commission regarding hazardous materials in the\n\n                                             45\n\fCity, or code violations. The City and Commission staff started to locate and provide\n\nCYAC with some responsive documents. Around July 10-12, a representative of the City\n\nAttorney's office asked RSG to hold onto its backup data or field notes. On July 17,\n\n2007, the City's redevelopment manager Patricia Beard (Beard) sent an e-mail to RSG\n\nrequesting the back-up data. This was done the same day that the Amendment was\n\napproved by the City Council. However, the PRA dispute raged on.\n\n       On July 27, 2007, CYAC's status letter to the City discussed a number of the\n\nrequests it had made to the City, including those for the \"raw property-by-property survey\n\ndata that the consultant RSG used to write the 2007 [RTC].\" CYAC's attorney stated that\n\nsuch field surveys of blight conditions had not been supplied.\n\n       On August 9, 2007, Beard sent another e-mail to RSG, requesting everything in\n\nRSG's files from the 2005 and 2007 Amendments. This request was copied to Frank\n\nSpevacek, president of RSG. He testified that only general requests were made to RSG\n\nfor their files, and he did not understand this request to include any property-by-property\n\nfield surveys. Beard followed up on CYAC's request by asking her administrative\n\nassistant to call RSG's staffer Walter Lauderdale, but it is not clear whether this was\n\ndone. Nothing further was received from RSG. Their field surveys were later discarded,\n\npossibly between June or July of 2007 and May 2008.\n\n                                      3. Crime Data\n\n       In the RTC, the City referred to a \"Table B-3\" of crime statistics from 2006,\n\nshowing the City's crime rates were higher than those of surrounding communities for\n\ncertain offenses and further, a disproportionate share of the City's crime occurs within the\n\n                                             46\n\fboundaries of the Amendment area. However, the table referred to does not appear in the\n\nRTC copies in the record. It was created from a chart of three years of crime data, dated\n\nMay 8, 2007, \"Part 1 Crime Statistics\" in the target redevelopment area and City-wide, as\n\nprovided by the City's police department crime analyst (the three-year chart). The three-\n\nyear chart was admitted at trial as exhibit No. 14.\n\n       In the June 15 police department PRA request, CYAC requested four categories of\n\ninformation: \"any data provided to [RSG]\" or to the Commission in the last year\n\nregarding crime rates in the City. Next, by using the May 2007 notice copy of the\n\nboundary parcel map, it sought: \"(2) Any data on the rate of crime in the shaded area on\n\nthe map (map provided). (3) A property-by-property breakdown of crime in the shaded\n\narea over the last three years. (4) Numbers of parking and traffic violations issued in the\n\nshaded area over the last three years.\" (Italics added.)\n\n       The City's assistant city attorney responded on June 21, 2007, as follows: \"You\n\nhave requested documents from us in a manner that is vague and ambiguous as to what\n\ndocuments are inclusive to your request. For example, I am unclear as to the address of\n\nthe documents requested via a 'shaded area' in your attachment. I cannot ascertain the\n\naddresses in such shaded areas by inspection of the map you have attached. As such, I\n\nneed clarification as to the category of items 2-4 as to the exact addresses intended. . . .\n\nItem 1 also refers to crime rates. If such crime statistics have not been created by the\n\nDepartment, the City is not required by law to create them for a Public Records Request.\n\nIf they exist, you are, however, entitled to inspect them.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n\n                                              47\n\f       On June 29, 2007, CYAC answered: \"Regarding Request Number 2, that request\n\nis based on the statement in the [RTC] that the Police Department gave an estimate of the\n\ncrime rate in that area. I do not know in what form the Police Department may have\n\nprovided the information, but I would like to receive it in whatever form it was provided.\n\n[¶] Regarding Requests Numbers 3 and 4, unfortunately, I do not have the addresses. If\n\nyou are able to locate the responsive documents to Request Numbers 1 and/or 2, that\n\nwould hopefully encompass the responses to Requests 3 and 4. Also, although I do not\n\nhave the number addresses, the addresses certainly include any address on National City\n\nBoulevard, any address on Civic Center Drive, [etc.].\" (Italics added.)\n\n       On July 17, 2007, Beard e-mailed two RSG staffers, Lauderdale and Zachary\n\nMikelson, to request back-up data for the \"crime table\" information mentioned in the\n\nRTC. On July 18, 2007, Beard was told by RSG staffer Mikelson that he received the\n\nthree-year chart (crime statistics) from crime analyst Molli Knobbe (Knobbe) of the\n\npolice department. She had used raw crime statistics to create the three-year chart, and\n\nRSG received and used it to create its table of 2006 crime statistics for the project area,\n\nwhich underlay its RTC conclusions.\n\n       On July 19, 2007, the City Attorney's office requested that Knobbe provide it with\n\n\"any of the data you provided below to this company [RSG].\" Knobbe forwarded to the\n\nCity Attorney the information (the three-year chart) she had provided to RSG on May 8,\n\n2007. When asked if she had provided any other information to RSG, Knobbe replied,\n\n\"That was it.\"\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\f       On July 24, 2007, the City Attorney's office forwarded Knobbe's crime data\n\ninformation to CYAC, including the three-year chart containing crime statistics in the\n\ntarget redevelopment area and City-wide, as well as a list of properties by parcel number.\n\n       On July 27, 2007, CYAC's attorneys sent a letter to the City discussing a number\n\nof the requests made to the City, including those to the City's police department, and\n\ninformed the City that it had satisfied the June 15, 2007 requests 1 and 2 to the police\n\ndepartment (crime rates in City and shaded map area), but it had not produced anything\n\nin response to requests 3 and 4 (property-by-property breakdown of crime in the shaded\n\narea over the last three years, and parking/traffic violations).\n\n       On August 9, 22 and 27, 2007, the City supplied three more sets of documents to\n\nCYAC for inspection. On September 25, 2007, CYAC filed its lawsuit claiming in the\n\nseventh cause of action that the City had failed to provide responsive documents.\n\n                               4. Additional Trial Evidence\n\n       Regarding the field surveys, the president of RSG, Spevacek, testified they had\n\nremained in its possession for a time, but were not made part of the RTC. Accordingly,\n\nRSG started to discard them when the project closed out in July 2007, and in 2008, RSG\n\ncompleted its office cleanup by purging its paper and physical data after the information\n\nwas entered into the computer and the computer program updated. He did not recall\n\nreceiving any request for \"everything in your files.\" RSG did not believe it needed to\n\nascertain if it could provide that 2007 raw data.\n\n       At trial, Knobbe testified that the three-year chart she prepared included crime\n\nstatistics of particular offenses, not crime rates. Crime rates were prepared City-wide\n\n                                             49\n\ftwice a year. Once she sent off the three-year chart as requested, she would not normally\n\nhave sent to the City Attorney any backup data she had used to create the three-year\n\nchart, because she did not think anyone else could make sense of it. However, she still\n\nhad that backup data in her file cabinet in August 2007, and could have sent it if anyone\n\nasked for it.\n\n          D. Special Considerations: Possession and Control of Public Records\n\n       Generally, public records must be described clearly enough to permit the agency\n\nto determine whether the writings or information of the type described in the request are\n\nunder its control. (California First Amendment Coalition, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th 159,\n\n165-166.) \"However, the requirement of clarity must be tempered by the reality that a\n\nrequester, having no access to agency files, may be unable to precisely identify the\n\ndocuments sought. Thus, writings may be described by their content. The agency must\n\nthen determine whether it has such writings under its control and the applicability of any\n\nexemption. An agency is thus obliged to search for records based on criteria set forth in\n\nthe search request.\" (Ibid.)\n\n       \"Records requests, however, inevitably impose some burden on government\n\nagencies. An agency is obliged to comply so long as the record can be located with\n\nreasonable effort.\" (California First Amendment Coalition, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th 159,\n\n166.) An agency may legitimately raise an objection that a request is overbroad or\n\nunduly burdensome. (Ibid.) However, the courts need not take literally a request's\n\nlanguage to deem it clearly excessive, but instead should construe the request reasonably,\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\fin light of its clear purposes: \"Feigned confusion based on a literal interpretation of the\n\nrequest is not grounds for denial.\" (Id. at pp. 166-167.)\n\n       Certainly, there was confusion here, some genuine and perhaps some that was\n\nfeigned. The City is not claiming that the requested information was exempt from\n\ndisclosure, but instead that it could not reasonably have been expected to locate it or\n\nproduce it, either because the requests were confusing, its consultant was to blame, or the\n\ncrime data was incomprehensible. The effect of the City's inability or unwillingness to\n\nlocate the records had the same effect as withholding requested information from the\n\npublic. (ACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 85.) \"[I]f an agency's claim that information\n\nis beyond the scope of the request can be sustained without the detailed justification\n\nnecessary to sustain a claim that information is exempt or not segregable, agencies could\n\nuse such claims to relieve themselves of the need to provide the 'detailed justification'\n\nordinarily required to withhold information.\" (Ibid.) The focus should be on the criteria\n\nin the request and the description of the information, as reasonably construed, and the\n\nsearch should be broad enough to account for the problem that the requester may not\n\nknow what documents or information of interest an agency possesses. Without certain\n\nknowledge of the nature of the documents, the requester may be unable to provide the\n\nspecificity an agency may require. (Ibid.)\n\n       In construing a disclosure request, the policy of the PRA requires the courts to\n\nconsider the information that is being requested, not only the precise type of records that\n\nmust be provided. (Haynie v. Superior Court (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1072 (Haynie).)\n\nFor example, an agency may be required to produce the \"substance\" of complaints and\n\n                                             51\n\fthe \" 'factual circumstances surrounding the crime or incident,' \" even if a requested arrest\n\nrecord is exempt from disclosure. In enacting exemption provisions, \"the Legislature\n\n'required the disclosure of information derived from the records while, in most cases,\n\npreserving the exemption for the records themselves.' \" (Ibid.; italics omitted.)\n\n       \"It is well-settled that if an agency has reason to know that certain places may\n\ncontain responsive documents, it is obligated under FOIA to search barring an undue\n\nburden. [Citations.]\" (Valencia-Lucena v. U.S. Coast Guard (D.C. Cir. 1999) 180 F.3d\n\n321, 327; compare Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency (D.C. Cir. 2003) 315 F.3d 311,\n\n315 (Iturralde) [\"[I]t is long settled that the failure of an agency to turn up one specific\n\ndocument in its search does not alone render a search inadequate. [Citations.] Rather,\n\nthe adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but\n\nby the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search. [Citation.] After all,\n\nparticular documents may have been accidentally lost or destroyed, or a reasonable and\n\nthorough search may have missed them.\"].)20\n\n       In ACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 55, the court relied on FOIA legal standards as\n\npersuasive: \" '[W]hether the requestor has been specific enough so that a professional\n\nemployee of the agency, familiar with the general subject area, could reasonably be\n\nexpected to find the desired documents.' \" (Id. at p. 85, fn. 16; see Sierra Club v.\n\n\n20     In Citizens Commission on Human Rights v. FDA (9th Cir. 1995) 45 F.3d 1325,\n1327, an agency's search for requested documents was considered to be reasonable, even\nthough it was unable to produce all of the requested documents, because of the\ncomplexity of the 1,000-volume file that had to be searched, having an index of 482\npages, and referring to over 300,000 pages of undisclosed documents, some of which\nwere privileged.\n                                              52\n\fSuperior Court (2013) 57 Cal. 4th 157 [Supreme Court decided that a PRA statutory\n\nexemption for \"computer software\" in § 6254.9, subd. (a) (a term which included\n\ncomputer mapping systems under § 6254.9, subd. (b)), did not also apply to the mapping\n\ndatabase in a certain file format; the underlying database material had to be disclosed,\n\nwhile the computer software required to manipulate the database remained properly\n\nexempt from disclosure].)\n\n       In Consolidated Irrigation Dist. v. Superior Court (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 697,\n\n709 (Consolidated Irrigation Dist.), the appellate court addressed the issue of whether,\n\nunder the PRA, \" 'the files of consultants retained to prepare an EIR for the City are\n\n\"public records\" that the City has a duty to seek [and] obtain to respond to a public\n\nrecords request.' \" In that case, there were two levels of consultants whose files were\n\nsought, the primary consultant and the subconsultants. The court was not required to\n\naddress any issue concerning the primary consultant's files( those issues were moot due to\n\naccess granted). With respect to the subconsultants' files, the court looked to the nature\n\nof the contractual relationship between the public entity and the subconsultants, to decide\n\nthe PRA issues of (1) whether the files of the subconsultants were \" 'in the [actual or\n\nconstructive] possession of the agency' for purposes of Government Code section 6253,\n\nsubdivision (c)\"; and (2) the nature of the agency's right, if any, to control the files and\n\nrecords of the subconsultants. (Consolidated Irrigation Dist., supra, at p. 710.)\n\n       In Consolidated Irrigation Dist., the record substantially supported a finding that\n\nthe agency lacked control over the subconsultants' records. The operative contract stated\n\nthe primary consultant, Land Use Associates, was an independent contractor, and there\n\n                                              53\n\fwas an implied finding that the City agency did not control the subconsultants or their\n\nfiles, and could not be required to produce them. (Consolidated Irrigation Dist., supra,\n\n205 Cal.App.4th at p. 711.) The case is distinguishable on its facts, but it indicates that\n\nthe contractual relationship of a public agency and its private consultant is important in\n\ndetermining the agency's duty of disclosure.21\n\n          E. Extent of City's PRA Obligations to Communicate with Custodians\n\n       In its related federal due process findings, the trial court said the City had failed to\n\nrespond promptly to PRA requests for crime data and property survey information, and it\n\nunjustifiably claimed the survey data were not public records, and it had failed to secure\n\nthat information during litigation to prevent it from being destroyed.

IV, post.)\n\nWe next examine those factual conclusions, but in the PRA context.\n\n       Under Government Code section 6253.1, the City had the duty to assist a requester\n\nsuch as CYAC to formulate reasonable requests and to respond accordingly, by\n\ncommunicating the scope of the public information requested to the custodians of its\n\nrecords. Reasonableness goes both ways, and we disagree with CYAC that only a very\n\nfew of its requests need be evaluated: July 27 regarding field survey data, and June 15\n\nand July 27 with regard to crime data. The facts are otherwise, because the May 23\n\nrequest included \"all blight studies\" and the June 15 requests included not only crime\n\ndata, but also all materials provided to RSG regarding hazardous materials and building\n\n\n\n21      With reference to its fees motion, CYAC claims the case before us represents the\nfirst California PRA trial court ruling about a third party consultant's custody of public\nrecords, and the PRA obligation to disclose such records.\n                                              54\n\fcode violations (physical blight). Even if the precise \"field survey\" term did not appear\n\nin the requests until July 27, it had become clear after the May 23 request that CYAC was\n\nseeking information backing up the field surveys, as they had been referred to in the RTC\n\nas source material. CYAC cannot now claim that its July 27 request was the only\n\noperative one and the others were irrelevant, since the July 27 request clarified the earlier\n\nones. (See Galbiso v. Orosi Public Utility Dist. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1063, 1088\n\n(Galbiso) [\"[A] person who seeks public records must present a reasonably focused and\n\nspecific request, so that the public agency will have an opportunity to promptly identify\n\nand locate such records and to determine whether any exemption to disclosure applies.\"].)\n\n       The record also shows that the trial court previously denied CYAC's motion for\n\nsanctions for alleged spoliation of such \"critical evidence.\" The court found no evidence\n\nfrom which it could reasonably infer intentional or willful conduct by City agents or\n\nemployees that was directed toward destroying either the raw data used by the consultant\n\n(field surveys) or any data compiled by the City police department (crime statistics).\n\nAccordingly, the whole picture should be examined: Were these public records or\n\ninformation about the people's business, when were they reasonably identifiable, and\n\nwhen were they in the possession or constructive possession of the City? (Gov. Code,\n\n§§ 6252, subd. (e); 6253, subd. (c).) The rules of review for statutory interpretation\n\nissues apply to questions of law (independent review), but we should accept as true any\n\ntrial court findings of the \"facts of the particular case,\" if supported by substantial\n\nevidence. (ACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 66.)\n\n\n\n                                              55\n\f                               1. Records of Consultant RSG\n\n       The court correctly concluded these were public records within the meaning of\n\nGovernment Code section 6252, subdivision (e), concerning the people's business.\n\nAlthough CYAC originally designated its requests as seeking \"blight studies,\" that was\n\nnot an unreasonable approach in light of the original language of the RTC. It was not\n\nenough for the City to respond that the RTC \"was\" the blight study. The City then\n\nappropriately took further action by contacting RSG in an attempt to obtain the\n\nunderlying data, the field surveys.\n\n       Based on the contractual language between RSG and the City's Commission, the\n\nCity had an ownership interest in the field survey material and it had the right to possess\n\nand control it, even though it did not enforce its contractual right. We agree with the trial\n\ncourt that the City did not act reasonably in protecting its contractual rights to retain this\n\nmaterial, even if its staff did not intentionally conceal the data. No bad faith finding was\n\nrequired to support the finding there was a PRA violation. (Iturralde, supra, 315 F.3d at\n\np. 315.) When the City staff requested that RSG produce all of its files, but without\n\ndefining the material actually being sought, it failed to take into account that \"field\n\nsurveys\" are a term of art in the redevelopment context. (See Blue, supra, 137\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1140-1142.) The City gave up too soon and did not press the matter\n\nsufficiently, to a reasonable extent, at a time when most of the field surveys, which it\n\nowned, still existed.\n\n       We are mindful of the press of business of public agencies, particularly in these\n\ndifficult fiscal times, and do not hold the City to an impossible standard, merely a\n\n                                              56\n\freasonable one. The City is not justified in arguing that it did everything it could or\n\nshould have to do, nor that all the fault lay with its contractor RSG. Moreover, since\n\n2008 (after the requests in this case were made), Government Code section 6253.3 has\n\nprovided that a public agency \"may not allow another party to control the disclosure of\n\ninformation that is otherwise subject to disclosure pursuant to this chapter,\" showing the\n\ntrend in the law is toward promoting such disclosure. (See fn. 21, ante.)\n\n       Notwithstanding the above, the trial court's reasoning or implied ruling that the\n\nCity had the statutory obligation to forward the PRA request it received, verbatim, to its\n\nconsultant as a custodian of public records, is not justifiable as an interpretation of this\n\nstatutory scheme. Instead, the City had the obligation to interpret the request as received,\n\nas made by a member of the public that was presumably not familiar with the underlying\n\ndata, and then to make reasonable efforts to facilitate the location and release of the\n\ninformation. The trial court's declaratory relief that there had been violations of the PRA\n\nwas justified, but we decline to issue a rule that PRA requests must be passed on exactly\n\nas received to the custodians of public records, even those who are private consultants.\n\n                          2. Records of City's Police Department\n\n       The record shows that the property-by-property crime reports, requested by CYAC\n\nas of June 15, were existing crime data located at the City's police department's crime\n\nanalyst's office, that were supplied to the City's consultant RSG on May 8, 2007 as\n\ntransformed into the three-year chart. However, the RSG-created crime table was\n\napparently omitted from the RTC, and the backup crime data was not transferred to the\n\nCity attorney's office upon request, since the individual crime analyst did not understand\n\n                                              57\n\fthe request to include it. Since the RTC had stated that police records were among the\n\nsource material relied upon, CYAC had a legitimate basis to request that information.\n\n       In response, the City Attorney's office first claimed that it was unclear about what\n\nmap was being used to identify the information sought, even though only one map had\n\nyet been made available (the boundary parcel map; this may have been a stalling tactic).\n\nIn any case, the City's attorneys eventually sought clarification of the requests, and\n\nreceived the June 29, 2007 response by CYAC that a response to requests 1 and 2 would\n\nprobably suffice as a response to requests 3 and 4. Next, CYAC's July 27, 2007 letter\n\nstating the City had satisfied requests 1 and 2, but requests 3 and 4 were still outstanding.\n\n       As of that time, the City's attorneys were already in possession, or should\n\nreasonably have been in possession, of knowledge that its own crime analyst Knobbe had\n\nused the underlying crime data to create the three-year chart she sent to RSG, and which\n\nRSG used to create a table of crime as referred to in the RTC, to serve as a basis for the\n\nRTC's conclusions. When the City Attorney's office requested that Knobbe provide it\n\nwith \"any of the data you provided below to this company [RSG],\" it mistakenly accepted\n\nthe same information (three-year chart) she had already provided to RSG on May 8,\n\n2007, and also apparently accepted her interpretation that the data would not have made\n\nsense to anyone else. The City could have asked her what raw statistical information\n\nunderlay the three-year chart or the table, but it did not, and we have no adequate basis to\n\nsay the data was in fact unintelligible. (See ACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 86, fn.\n\n17 [public data should be produced if possible, even if the court wonders why anyone\n\nwould want it].)\n\n                                             58\n\f       Even without any bad faith showing, the record discloses that the City did not ask\n\nthe right questions, even though it presumably had the ability to do so. In the course of\n\nits normal PRA response procedure, the City's responding attorneys had actual or\n\nconstructive knowledge of both the information relevant to the redevelopment\n\nproceedings, and the police department's type of data, and how they could have been\n\nrelated. To comply with its existing obligations under Government Code section 6253.1,\n\nthe City staff would not have been required to create a new set of public records nor to\n\ntake other action that would have exceeded the duties imposed by the PRA. (Haynie,\n\nsupra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1072.) This is not a case in which multiple governmental\n\ndepartments and agencies are involved in an exceedingly complex fact pattern, in which\n\nan extensive search may be deemed reasonable, even where it did not produce the desired\n\nresults. In such distinguishable cases, requiring additional work over the efforts made by\n\nthe public agency would unfairly place an undue burden on it. (See Citizens Comm. on\n\nHuman Rights, supra, 45 F.3d at p. 1327.)\n\n       Even though the City was not found to be intentionally obstructionist, neither was\n\nit sufficiently proactive or diligent in making a reasonable effort to identify and locate the\n\nraw crime data. The trial court was justified in concluding the City failed to meet its\n\ndisclosure duties under the PRA. However, the trial court's ruling imposed more than a\n\nstatutory obligation on the City, by ruling or implying that the City had the obligation to\n\nforward the same PRA request language to its custodian of records, the police department\n\nstaff. Instead, the City had the obligation to interpret the request, as made by a member\n\nof the public that was not presumably as familiar with the underlying data, and to\n\n                                             59\n\ffacilitate a reasonable effort to locate and release the information. (Gov. Code,\n\n§ 6253.1.)\n\n       The declaratory relief finding that there had been violations of the PRA was\n\njustified, but we decline to endorse or establish any rule that PRA requests must be\n\npassed on verbatim to the custodians of records, whether they are public employees or\n\nprivate consultants.\n\n                                             IV\n\n                  FEDERAL PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS RULING\n\n                                 A. Applicable Guidelines\n\n       \"The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard 'at a\n\nmeaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' \" (Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. 319, 333.)\n\nThere the Supreme Court said, \" ' \"[d]ue process,\" unlike some legal rules, is not a\n\ntechnical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.'\n\n[Citation.] '[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the\n\nparticular situation demands.' [Citation.] Accordingly, resolution of the issue whether\n\nthe administrative procedures provided here are constitutionally sufficient requires\n\nanalysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected.\" (Id. at pp. 334-335\n\n[statement preceding the three-part test elements].)\n\n       \"[T]he Due Process Clause provides that certain substantive rights--life, liberty,\n\nand property--cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate\n\nprocedures. The categories of substance and procedure are distinct. Were the rule\n\notherwise, the Clause would be reduced to a mere tautology. 'Property' cannot be defined\n\n                                             60\n\fby the procedures provided for its deprivation any more than can life or liberty.\"\n\n(Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

Once it is determined that the due process clause applies,\n\nfederal standards, not state standards, govern the decision on what process is due. (Id. at\n\np. 541.)\n\n       \"The procedural component of the Due Process Clause does not protect everything\n\nthat might be described as a 'benefit': 'To have a property interest in a benefit, a person\n\nclearly must have more than an abstract need or desire' and 'more than a unilateral\n\nexpectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.' \" (Town\n\nof Castle Rock v. Gonzales (2005) 545 U.S. 748, 756 (Castle Rock).) \"Such entitlements\n\nare, ' \"of course, . . . not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their\n\ndimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent\n\nsource such as state law.\" ' \" (Ibid.)\n\n       In Castle Rock, as here, \"the ultimate issue\" was whether state law gave to the\n\nplaintiff a protectable property interest, for purposes of Fourteenth Amendment remedies.\n\n\"That determination, despite its state-law underpinnings, is ultimately one of federal\n\nconstitutional law. 'Although the underlying substantive interest is created by \"an\n\nindependent source such as state law,\" federal constitutional law determines whether that\n\ninterest rises to the level of a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" protected by the Due\n\n                                              61\n\fProcess Clause.' [Citations.] Resolution of the federal issue begins, however, with a\n\ndetermination of what it is that state law provides.\" (Castle Rock, supra, 545 U.S. 748,\n\n756-757; italics omitted.) There, the court also expressed and explained \"our continuing\n\nreluctance to treat the Fourteenth Amendment as ' \"a font of tort law\" ' \" (id. at p. 768),\n\nwhile recognizing that the states have the power to provide plaintiff-victims with\n\npersonally enforceable remedies. (Id. at pp. 765-768 [but noting there was no existing\n\nstatutory right of a \"protected person\" to enforce a domestic violence restraining order].)\n\n       In Clark v. City of Hermosa Beach (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1152 (Clark), the court\n\nexplained that a violation of state administrative hearing protections does not always give\n\nrise to liability under the federal Constitution: \"Obviously, this is not the first time a\n\nplaintiff has attempted to convert a state law claim into a federal case of constitutional\n\nproportions. [Citation.] However, we conclude that while the City violated state law by\n\nfailing to provide a fair hearing, it did not offend the federal Constitution, on either\n\nprocedural or substantive due process grounds.\" (Id. at p. 1178.) Thus, a \"state law\n\nrequirement that a public entity conduct hearings in a fair manner does not automatically\n\nimplicate the federal due process clause. . . . [B]efore reaching any question about the\n\nfairness of a particular proceeding under the federal Constitution, we must first address\n\nwhether a protected interest--life, liberty, or property--is implicated. If no such interest is\n\ninvolved, then the procedural protections of the due process clause do not come into\n\nplay.\" (Ibid., citing Board of Regents v. Roth (1972) 408 U.S. 564, 569-578.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              62\n\f                                 B. Issues Now Presented\n\n       As already explained, the trial court ruled the City had violated \"CYAC's right to\n\nprocedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to its failure to\n\ntimely provide the maps with the RTC, which were required by statute.\" (Italics added.)\n\nThe court also referred to the lack of \"other blight condition information\" in the RTC. In\n\na related ruling, the court concluded that \"at a minimum, a continuance of the public\n\nhearing upon request was required.\"\n\n       However, since the City had met all the basic notice requirements of section\n\n33452, and CYAC had been given notice by late April-early May of the June 19, 2007\n\nhearing on the Amendment, the court ruled that CYAC had \"sufficient time to undertake\n\nits own investigation to present evidence to the City Council.\"22 Thus, the court\n\ndeclined to issue a broader procedural due process ruling that would have imposed any\n\nadditional specific time requirements on the City to make the RTC available to the\n\npublic, \"prior to the public hearing,\" such as by impliedly adding to the language of\n\nsection 33457.1. (Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1142-1144.)23 Since CYAC had\n\nbeen able to prepare and present extensive opposition, the court restricted its ruling to a\n\nfinding that CYAC was not afforded the requisite due process with respect to the failure\n\n22     The RTC and agenda items were made available three business days before the\npublic hearing, pursuant to the standards of the Brown Act. (Gov. Code, § 54954.2,\nsubd. (a).)\n\n23     CYAC seeks imposition of a rule for 60-90 days' mandatory notice under the PRL.\nThis would in effect require this court to act as a legislative body making policy\ndecisions, and we shall reject that claim post. (Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at\np. 831.)\n                                             63\n\fto timely provide the maps and other statutorily required blight condition information\n\nwith the RTC. (§ 33352, subd. (b).)\n\n        In its earlier denial of summary adjudication to the City of the CYAC\n\nconstitutional claims, the court had identified remaining factual issues about whether, on\n\nthis record, the statutory requirements satisfy due process requirements. Later at trial, the\n\ncourt heard expert testimony from CYAC's land use consultants about their estimates of\n\nthe time it would take to prepare adequate responses to the RTC, as well as other\n\ntestimony about the nature of CYAC's property interest within the proposed Amendment\n\narea.\n\n        To examine this ruling, we emphasize that CYAC did not plead and prove these\n\nwere substantive due process violations, such as arbitrary and irrational governmental\n\ndecision-making. (Clark, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1183.)24 The trial court\n\nexplained that the arguments being made by CYAC possibly included a facial challenge\n\nor an as applied challenge to the terms of section 33457.1, which required provision of\n\nthe RTC to the legislative body and the public \"prior to\" the hearing.25 As noted,\n\n\n\n24      For illustration, compare County of Sacramento v. Lewis (1998) 523 U.S. 833, 845\nstating \"[s]ubstantive due process protects against arbitrary government action\"; Galland\nv. City of Clovis (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1003, 1032 (substantive due process violation requires\nsome form of outrageous or egregious conduct constituting \"a true abuse of power\").\n\n25     \" 'A facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance\nconsiders only the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular\ncircumstances of an individual. [Citation.] \" 'To support a determination of facial\nunconstitutionality, voiding the statute as a whole, petitioners cannot prevail by\nsuggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may\npossibly arise as to the particular application of the statute . . . . Rather, petitioners must\n                                               64\n\fhowever, the court rejected any such facial or as applied challenge, which it considered to\n\nbe broader than the essential procedural due process claim before it, related to the lack of\n\nthe timely provision of statutorily required maps and \"other blight condition\n\ninformation.\" (§ 33352, subd. (b).)\n\n       Accordingly, we are required to address a fairly narrow ruling by the trial court,\n\nwhich found that each element of the test set forth in Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. 319, was\n\nviolated here, due to the lack of timely provision of maps or \"other blight condition\n\ninformation.\" Identification and balancing of the competing interests at stake are\n\nrequired to determine if this procedural scheme for the protection of CYAC's property\n\ninterest was adequate to ensure a meaningful hearing that met minimum overall standards\n\nof fairness in this particular context. (California Teachers Assn. v. State of California,\n\nsupra, 20 Cal.4th 327, 347-348.)\n\n        C. Application of Legal Principles: Type of Protectable Property Interest\n\n       CYAC chiefly argues that if it had failed to follow its remedies under section\n\n33500, to promptly pursue a cause of action for reverse validation of the Amendment, its\n\nproperty interests would have been immediately harmed by the blight designation. 26 It\n\n\n\n\ndemonstrate that the act's provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with\napplicable constitutional prohibitions.' \" [Citations.]' \" (California Teachers Assn. v.\nState of California (1999) 20 Cal.4th 327, 338.)\n\n26     Section 33500 now provides: \"(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law,\nincluding Section 33501, an action may be brought to review the validity of the adoption\nor amendment of a redevelopment plan at any time within 90 days after the date of the\nadoption of the ordinance adopting or amending the plan, if the adoption of the ordinance\n                                             65\n\fclaims that under section 33368, an unchallenged decision of the City would have been\n\nfinal and conclusive, allowing a conclusive presumption that the project area is a blighted\n\narea as defined by section 33031. However, the reverse validation ruling prevented this\n\nsection 33368 presumption from going into effect to allow any later land acquisition\n\nbased on blight. (§ 33391.)\n\n       More generally, CYAC seems to argue its ownership of property in the\n\nAmendment area should give it a protected, heightened interest in participating in an\n\namendment procedure that is in strict compliance with the CRL, in which the City would\n\nguarantee the public received only a timely and complete RTC. (§ 33457.1.) We must\n\nconsider the nature of CYAC's private property interest to be affected by the enacted\n\nAmendment, and \"the precise nature of the government function involved.\" (Cafeteria &\n\nRestaurant Workers Union v. McElroy (1961) 367 U.S. 886, 895.) As we will show,\n\neven in light of the statutory limitations period of only 90 days to challenge the blight\n\ndesignation, the record did not show that as a matter of law, an imminent blight\n\ndesignation was so harmful or personalized to CYAC's property interests as to invoke\n\nfederal procedural due process protections that would go beyond state law. (§§ 33500 or\n\n33501.)\n\n                      1. Redevelopment Law and Blight Designation\n\n       Generally, a land use application invokes procedural due process protections only\n\nif the owner has a legitimate claim of entitlement to the approval. (Breneric Associates v.\n\n\noccurred prior to January 1, 2011.\" Subdivision (b) is similar on agency findings. The\nValidation Act applies to such an action. (§ 33501; Code Civ. Proc., § 860 et seq.)\n                                             66\n\fCity of Del Mar (1998) 69 Cal.App.4th 166, 181-184.) \"An ownership interest alone\n\ndoes not cloak the prospect of developing the property with the protections of procedural\n\ndue process.\" (Las Lomas Land Co., LLC v. City of Los Angeles (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th\n\n837, 853 (Las Lomas Land).)\n\n       In Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 614-615 (Horn), it was held\n\nthat procedural due process protections apply to adjoining property owners, if their\n\nproperty interests are substantially affected by adjudicatory land use decisions on an\n\nadjacent property. However, \"Horn does not support the proposition that the denial of a\n\ndevelopment application constitutes a deprivation of property for purposes of procedural\n\ndue process.\" (Las Lomas Land, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th 837, 853-854.) Constitutional\n\nnotice and hearing requirements are triggered by governmental action that will result in\n\nsignificant or substantial deprivations of property, and this category does not include an\n\nagency decision having only a de minimis effect on land. (Horn, supra, at p. 616;\n\nRobinson v. City and County of San Francisco (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 950, 963\n\n(Robinson).)\n\n       In the context of redevelopment law, the eminent domain power was only one of\n\nthe avenues that the City's (former) redevelopment agency could take in fighting urban\n\nblight. (See fn. 11, ante.) In Cambria Spring Co., supra, 171 Cal.App.3d 1080, the\n\nappellate court distinguished between the eminent domain power and an amendment of a\n\nredevelopment plan relating to eminent domain. In rejecting a landowner's claim of\n\ninverse condemnation damages based on redevelopment decisions, the court noted:\n\n\n\n                                            67\n\f          \"The adoption of a redevelopment plan closely resembles the general\n          planning which . . . has been held not to constitute an announcement\n          of intent to condemn. The adoption of a redevelopment plan goes\n          further than the adoption of a general plan (Gov. Code, § 65300 et\n          seq.). As held in Selby Realty Company v. City of San Buenaventura\n          [1973] 10 Cal.3d 110 [(Selby Realty)], the adoption of a general plan\n          does not amount to an announcement of intent to condemn, and a\n          general plan is prerequisite to a redevelopment plan [citation].\n          However, the adoption of a redevelopment plan still falls 'several\n          leagues short of a firm declaration of an intention to condemn\n          property.' (Selby Realty[, supra], 10 Cal.3d at p. 119.) This is so\n          because the redevelopment plan still does not provide the 'special\n          and direct interference with plaintiff's property' required by Selby\n          Realty. [Citation.] Moreover, a redevelopment plan, like a general\n          plan, may be amended [citation] before plaintiff's property is taken.\n          [Citation.] . . . Thus, adoption of a redevelopment plan does not\n          have the finality required to give rise to liability for damages.\"\n          (Cambria Spring Co., supra, at p. 1097.)\n\n       In Cambria Spring Co., supra, 171 Cal.App.3d at page 1098 the court further\n\nconcluded, \"As there was no official action amounting to an announcement of intent to\n\ncondemn, there could be no liability based upon unreasonable delay following such an\n\nannouncement. The evidence was substantial and convincing that [the City's] activities\n\nnever went beyond the planning stage, and did not reach the 'acquiring stage.' \"\n\n       In Card v. Community Redevelopment Agency (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 570, 578-\n\n579, the reviewing court distinguished between procedural due process protections and\n\nsubstantive due process protections, in the context of redevelopment. There, the agency\n\nhad failed to follow the correct statutory scheme for amending a redevelopment plan, but\n\nhad given constitutionally adequate notice and hearing in doing so, and constitutional\n\nprocedural due process of law was not denied. (Accord, National City Business Assn. v.\n\nCity of National City (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1060, 1069 [wrong type of agency making\n\n\n                                            68\n\fthe correct decision did not prejudice the landowners].) Instead, in Card, the failure to\n\nuse the correct procedures served to effectively deny the affected persons substantive due\n\nprocess of law, by making them ineligible for certain statutory relocation protections they\n\nwould have received, had proper redevelopment procedures been followed. (Card,\n\nsupra, at pp. 580-582.)\n\n       In the case before us, the City sought to impose a blight designation on CYAC's\n\nproperty, through the redevelopment amendment, at a time when the City had not\n\ninitiated any eminent domain action. Neither had CYAC brought any inverse\n\ncondemnation action. (See City of Ripon v. Sweetin (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 887, 897\n\n[\"[I]nverse condemnation damages for precondemnation conduct must be claimed in a\n\npending eminent domain action\" and \" '[t]he basic measure of damages in inverse\n\ncondemnation actions, as in all eminent domain proceedings, is \"market value.\" ' \"; see 29\n\nCal.Jur.3d (2011) Eminent Domain, § 345, p. 457 [\"a planning designation is not the\n\nfunctional equivalent of an announced intent to condemn\"].) Section 33390 et seq.\n\noutlines the means of acquiring real property for redevelopment purposes. Under section\n\n33398, an eminent domain statute (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1245.260), that authorizes\n\ninverse condemnation claims alleging harm from an undue delay after a resolution of\n\nnecessity to take, shall not apply to approvals of redevelopment plans or amendments.\n\nThese are different bodies of law.\n\n       CYAC nevertheless seems to be importing concepts from the realms of eminent\n\ndomain (just compensation), or inverse condemnation (precondemnation damages), to\n\nassert that from the RTC defects, it suffered such an injury to its protected property\n\n                                             69\n\finterests (whether in value or legal status) that additional procedural due process\n\nrequirements should have been imposed.27 However, in this early stage proceeding in\n\nthe redevelopment context, CYAC cannot show that the enactment of the Amendment\n\ncreating a potentially unsupported blight designation was so harmful that it resulted in\n\nsignificant or substantial deprivations of its procedural rights to protect its property.\n\n(Horn, supra, 24 Cal.3d at p. 616; Robinson, supra, 208 Cal.App.4th 950, 963.)\n\n       We acknowledge that a blight designation amendment might potentially have\n\nmore than a de minimis effect upon a property interest. Here, however, the procedural\n\nprotections imposed by the CRL statutory scheme, combined with the eminent domain\n\nstatutory scheme, were constitutionally sufficient state law measures to safeguard the\n\ninterests of a landowner within a proposed Amendment area. (Horn, supra, 24 Cal.3d at\n\np. 616; Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. at pp. 334-335.) Under Cambria Spring Co., supra,\n\n171 Cal.App.3d 1080, the Amendment to the redevelopment plan did not amount to a\n\n\" 'special and direct interference with plaintiff's property,' \" because it preceded any\n\nactual taking of property: \"[A]doption of a redevelopment plan does not have the finality\n\nrequired to give rise to liability for damages.\" (Id. at p. 1097.) The same is true of an\n\namendment. Moreover, the lack of adequate supporting data for the Amendment,\n\nregarding blight conditions, was already addressed through the 2006 changes in the CRL\n\nprovisions (§§ 33352, subd. (b); 33457.1), and in the PRA procedures followed.\n\n\n27     With respect to the value of the CYAC real property, it claims the City was trying\nto force it to sell to a developer, so it gave it an inflated $1.2 million sales offer to make\nthe developer go away, but CYAC does not claim the property is worth that much. The\nCity denies that it was pressuring CYAC.\n                                              70\n\f       In considering \"the precise nature of the government function involved,\" and the\n\nnature of CYAC's interest in its property (as potentially affected by the public\n\nAmendment proceedings), we conclude the CRL statutory protections against an\n\nunsupported blight designation were not so inadequate as to require or invoke greater\n\nconstitutional procedural due process protections. (§§ 33500, 33501, 33368; Cafeteria &\n\nRestaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, supra, 367 U.S. 886, 895.) We next test this\n\nconclusion against the cases relied on by CYAC and the trial court in support of the\n\nprocedural due process finding.\n\n                               2. Comparison of Cases Cited\n\n       The trial court's ruling relied on United States v. James Daniel Good Real\n\nProperty (1993) 510 U.S. 43, 53-55 (Good), to state that \"[t]he right of Californians to be\n\nsecure in their real property constitutes a valid protectable property interest.\" That case\n\narose in the context of ex parte preseizure proceedings, after Good had pleaded guilty to\n\npromoting a harmful drug in violation of Hawaii law. The federal government\n\nsubsequently declared a forfeiture, seizing his house and land without prior notice or an\n\nadversary proceeding, on the ground that the property had been used to commit or\n\nfacilitate federal drug offenses. (21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(7).) The high court accepted Good's\n\nassertion that this ex parte proceeding deprived him of his home and property without due\n\nprocess of law, because the purpose of a due process requirement is \" 'not only to ensure\n\nabstract fair play to the individual. Its purpose, more particularly, is to protect his use\n\nand possession of property from arbitrary encroachment--to minimize substantively\n\n\n\n                                              71\n\funfair or mistaken deprivations of property. . . .' [Citation.]\" (Good, supra, at p. 53.)\n\nThus:\n\n           \"The constitutional limitations we enforce in this case apply to real\n           property in general, not simply to residences. That said, the case\n           before us well illustrates an essential principle: Individual freedom\n           finds tangible expression in property rights. At stake in this and\n           many other forfeiture cases are the security and privacy of the home\n           and those who take shelter within it.\" (Good, supra, 510 U.S. 43,\n           61.)\n\n        Although those principles cannot be disputed, the degree of the invasion of\n\nCYAC's commercial property interests by these redevelopment amendment proceedings,\n\nthrough the City's provision of a late and incomplete RTC, is simply not fairly\n\ncomparable to the magnitude of an ex parte seizure of residential property as a civil\n\nforfeiture. (See Ginns v. Savage (1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [\"Language used in any\n\nopinion is of course to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the\n\ncourt, and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.\"].)\n\n        Here, CYAC's business property was the subject, among 691 other parcels, of\n\nCRL notice and hearing procedures for the amendment of the redevelopment plan, and\n\nCYAC had the opportunity to present opposition and to seek additional data for preparing\n\nfurther opposition. CYAC cannot persuasively now argue that it had a general \"interest\n\nin protecting its real property\" that should have precluded the City from pursuing its\n\nstatutorily controlled, noticed redevelopment procedures, or punished the City for doing\n\nso defectively, in light of otherwise available state remedies under the CRL. Nor can we\n\ngive any particular policy weight to CYAC's commendable use of its property to serve\n\nthe youthful public.\n\n                                             72\n\f       CYAC places great reliance on the case of Brody v. Village of Port Chester\n\n(2d Cir. 2005) 434 F.3d 121 (Brody), in which a condemnee sued the Village as\n\ncondemnor, alleging it had violated his federal procedural due process rights, by failing\n\nto provide him with adequate notice of his statutory right to challenge its public use\n\ndetermination (as well as the procedures to implement the right). State law provided him\n\nwith an opportunity for a predeprivation review hearing, before the title acquisition\n\nprocess was concluded. The court held in the eminent domain context that due process\n\nrequires the condemnor to give as much notice as is practicable in attempting to inform\n\nan affected property owner of a proceeding that threatens to deprive the owner of that\n\nproperty interest, and such \"reasonable notice\" must include mention of the\n\ncommencement of the statutory 30-day challenge period. However, no notice of the\n\nimplementing procedures was constitutionally required. This case is distinguishable, as\n\nfarther along in the condemnation process, with a greater taking at stake.\n\n       In Brody, the court referred to the principle in Kelo v. City of New London (2005)\n\n545 U.S. 469, that \" '[f]or more than a century, [the Supreme Court's] public use\n\njurisprudence has widely eschewed rigid formulas and intrusive scrutiny in favor of\n\naffording legislatures broad latitude in determining what public needs justify the use of\n\nthe takings power.' \" (Brody, supra, 434 F.3d at p. 134.) Although the court in Brody set\n\naside an order allowing the condemnation to proceed, it also noted that the state law\n\nreview procedure was appropriate \"given the narrow role that the courts play in ensuring\n\nthat the condemnation is for a public use.\" (Ibid.) It thus ruled that \"from a\n\nconstitutional perspective, Brody has no constitutional right to participate in the Village's\n\n                                             73\n\finitial decision to exercise its power of eminent domain, and the post-determination\n\nreview procedure set forth in [N.Y. law] is sufficient under the test articulated by\n\nMathews, [supra], 424 U.S. 319, 335 []. Due process does not require New York to\n\nfurnish a procedure to challenge public use beyond that which it already provides.\"\n\n(Brody, supra, at p. 133; italics added.)\n\n       Here too, the CRL statutory scheme allowed the City and its Commission to\n\npursue the Amendment to authorize a public use determination, and thus to enable some\n\nfuture exercise of the eminent domain power, by following the prescribed procedures,\n\nand it further provided for reverse validation challenges. (See National City Business\n\nAssn. v. City of National City, supra, 146 Cal.App.3d 1060, 1065 [federal and state\n\nconstitutions \"guarantee the right to not have one's property taken without just\n\ncompensation; there is no fundamental right to not have one's property taken at all;\"\n\noriginal italics.) As we have found previously in this opinion, the City did not pursue the\n\nAmendment entirely properly, and CYAC was entitled to the remedy of reverse\n\nvalidation, as well as a declaration that the PRA procedures had not been followed. That\n\nrelief was comprehensive in nature and sufficiently vindicated the actual, existing\n\ninterests that CYAC, as well as other interested parties, had at stake in successfully\n\nresisting the blight designation.\n\n       A \"state law requirement that a public entity conduct hearings in a fair manner\n\ndoes not automatically implicate the federal due process clause.\" (Clark, supra, 48\n\nCal.App.4th 1152, 1178.) CYAC did not show any separate and additional, cognizable\n\nprocedural due process deprivation that occurred due to these statutory duty violations,\n\n                                             74\n\fwhich all took place before any \"taking\" was actually initiated. Here, as in Cambria\n\nSpring Co., \"Under the facts of this case, the Constitution does not require that [CYAC]\n\nbe given relief beyond that provided by the statute.\" (Cambria Spring Co., supra, 171\n\nCal.App.3d at p. 1099.)\n\n          D. Risk of Erroneous Deprivation of Rights; Burden on Public Entity\n\n       \"[P]rocedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the\n\ntruthfinding process as applied to the generality of cases, not the rare exceptions.\"\n\n(Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. 319, 344-345.) At trial, the court heard expert opinion\n\ntestimony about how much more time the opponents of the Amendment should have been\n\ngiven to fight this redevelopment blight designation. The court's ruling acknowledged\n\nthat CYAC had nevertheless been given adequate notice of the public hearing and had\n\nhad an opportunity to prepare opposition.\n\n       The trial court correctly declined to issue any ruling adding to the statutory\n\nrequirements of section 33457.1, that the RTC and related information of blight\n\nconditions must be given \"prior to the hearing.\" The Legislature did not designate any\n\ntime frame for how far in advance that disclosure should be made, and it was not required\n\nto do so; we leave such policy decisions to the Legislature. (Glendora, supra, 185\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 831.)\n\n       Further, we need not weigh in upon whether the City should have granted a\n\ncontinuance of the public hearing for purposes of allowing further opposition to be filed.\n\nThe City took six volumes and more of posthearing written opposition, as shown in the\n\nadministrative record. The record also shows that the City was under some self-imposed\n\n                                             75\n\ftime pressure because the previous ordinance allowing the exercise of the eminent\n\ndomain power was about to expire, but the City had not noticed the hearing earlier\n\nbecause the November 2006 election ballot had created some uncertainty, due to a\n\nmeasure on it about redevelopment. In any case, and especially since the reverse\n\nvalidation order was properly granted, this record does not show there was a serious risk\n\nof erroneous deprivation of rights of property owners within the Amendment area, that\n\nwould have justified imposing additional federal procedural due process protections or\n\nsanctions.\n\n       In view of the recent abolition of redevelopment agencies, and for all of the above\n\nreasons, it would serve no purpose for this court to additionally examine the portions of\n\nthe Mathews test that address the \"probable value, if any, of additional or substitute\n\nprocedural safeguards\" and the \"fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or\n\nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail.\" (Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. at p. 335.)\n\n       We conclude that CYAC's asserted interest in property protection against any\n\npotentially unsupported blight designation, by receiving strict CRL compliance, is not a\n\nprotectable property interest for procedural due process purposes. There is no federal\n\nconstitutional law principle currently establishing that such a claimed interest \" 'rises to\n\nthe level of a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" protected by the Due Process Clause.' \"\n\n(Castle Rock, supra, 545 U.S. 748, 756-757.) The declaratory relief and nominal\n\ndamages order and judgment on CYAC's claim of federal procedural due process\n\ndeprivations must be reversed.\n\n\n\n                                              76\n\f                                              V\n\n                                     ATTORNEY FEES\n\n       After trial, the court ordered the City to pay substantial attorney fees to CYAC\n\n($1,906,516.75) and to the Interested Parties ($84,652.50). (42 U.S.C. § 1988; Gov.\n\nCode, § 6259; Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.5.) The court made those awards after\n\ndetermining that discretionary relief from late filing of the motions should be granted\n\nunder Code of Civil Procedure section 473, and then hearing the respective fees motions.\n\n(Rule 3.1702.)\n\n       Despite the abolition of redevelopment agencies and the overhaul of the CRL that\n\noccurred in 2011, the trial court's substantive rulings in the validation context, as well as\n\nthe PRA claims, continue to serve as the basis for an attorney fees award. Particularly as\n\nto the relief granted to CYAC on the federal due process claim, our reversal of that part\n\nof the judgment removes in large part the legal basis for the attorney fees award against\n\nthe City, insofar as it was based on Title 42 United States Code section 1988. (Law\n\nOffices of Dixon R. Howell v. Valley (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1105 [when a\n\njudgment is reversed, the fee award based on the judgment falls].)\n\n       However, the fees awards to CYAC and the Interested Parties were also based on\n\nanother provision of law with respect to the validation and CRL relief, Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 1021.5 (private attorney general theory). CYAC alone received an\n\nattorney fee award based on the PRA (Gov. Code, § 6259, subd. (d)), as the court\n\ndetermined that it applied, and that if it did not, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5\n\nwould fill the gap and allow such fees.\n\n                                              77\n\f       Before we can address the merits of the City's appeal of those fee awards under the\n\nPRA (Gov. Code, § 6259, subd. (d)) or Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, or the\n\nfees cross-appeal by CYAC, we must resolve several procedural problems presented by\n\nthis record. First, we will discuss the propriety of the discretionary relief granted by the\n\ntrial court from alleged untimely filing of the fees motions under the provisions of rule\n\n3.1702. (See Russell v. Trans Pacific Group (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1717, 1728-1729\n\n[even though procedural requirements for obtaining costs are mandatory, trial court\n\nretains jurisdiction to grant relief upon proper showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise\n\nor excusable neglect].)\n\n       We shall determine that the trial court had jurisdiction to grant relief from any late\n\nfiling, and did not abuse its discretion in doing so, and accordingly, we proceed to\n\nexamine the legal basis for the attorney fees awards under both the two remaining\n\nstatutory theories, the PRA and Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. As explained in\n\nBell v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 672, 689-690 (Bell), Code of\n\nCivil Procedure section 1021.5 will not provide an independent basis for an attorney fees\n\naward, when there are already existing specific statutory fee provisions that apply, such\n\nas Government Code section 6259, subdivision (d). \" 'Code of Civil Procedure section\n\n1021.5 was intended to provide specific guidelines for the exercise of inherent judicial\n\npower to award fees not specifically authorized by statute.' \" (Bell, supra, at pp. 689-690;\n\nitalics added.) We address whether the court correctly concluded that fees on CYAC's\n\nPRA claim were specifically authorized by the PRA statute.\n\n\n\n                                             78\n\f       Having given guidance to the trial court in those respects, we shall reverse the\n\norders awarding attorney fees and return those remaining issues to the trial court for its\n\nexercise of discretion in evaluating the factors set out in Code of Civil Procedure section\n\n1021.5 (and the PRA, as to CYAC only). This will include both the entitlement issues\n\nand an apportionment of any fees awards among the various successful and unsuccessful\n\nclaims.\n\n                      A. Discretionary Relief From \"Untimely\" Filing\n\n       To assess the soundness of the relief allowed from late filing of the fees motions,\n\nwe outline the terms of rule 3.1702(a). It states, \"Except as otherwise provided by\n\nstatute, this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney's fees and claims for\n\nattorney's fees provided for in a contract. Subdivisions (b) and (c) of rule 3.1702 apply\n\nwhen the court determines entitlement to the fees, the amount of the fees, or both,\n\nwhether the court makes that determination because the statute or contract refers to\n\n'reasonable' fees, because it requires a determination of the prevailing party, or for other\n\nreasons.\" (Italics added.) Turning to rule 3.1702(b)(1), \"A notice of motion to claim\n\nattorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial\n\ncourt--including attorney's fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment in the trial\n\ncourt--must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules\n\n8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil case . . . .\" (Italics added.) At the outset, it seems\n\nrule 8.104(a)(1)(B) would therefore apply, stating \"Unless a statute or rule 8.108 provides\n\notherwise, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of: [¶] (B) 60 days\n\nafter the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document\n\n                                              79\n\fentitled 'Notice of Entry' of judgment or a file-stamped copy of the judgment,\n\naccompanied by proof of service . . . .\" (Italics added; rule 8.108(a) [would allow an\n\nextension of time only in certain cases not present here, e.g., motion for new trial, etc.].)\n\n       The text of rule 3.1702(d) clearly allows for \"Extensions[:] For good cause, the\n\ntrial judge may extend the time for filing a motion for attorney's fees in the absence of a\n\nstipulation or for a longer period than allowed by stipulation.\"\n\n       As relevant here, major confusion arose from the parallel terms of Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 870, subdivision (b), the Validation Act appeals deadline:\n\n\"(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law including . . . any rule of court, no\n\nappeal shall be allowed from any judgment entered pursuant to this chapter unless a\n\nnotice of appeal is filed within 30 days after the notice of entry of the judgment, or, within\n\n30 days after the entry of the judgment if there is no answering party.\" (Italics added; see\n\nPlanning and Conservation League v. Department of Water Resources (1998) 17 Cal.4th\n\n264, 269, 273-274 [\"The legislative history indicates the intent of the amendments to\n\nsection 870, adding the shortened period, was simply to reduce the period of uncertainty\n\nbefore finality of a validation action . . . . Moreover, the provision of a longer period for\n\nappealing collateral orders would be inconsistent with the legislative purpose of ensuring\n\nprompt finality.\"].)\n\n       With reference to rule 3.1702(d), the court in Lewow v. Surfside III Condominium\n\nOwners Assn., Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 128, 135 said the provision allowing a trial\n\njudge to extend the time for filing a motion for attorney fees is remedial and should be\n\ngiven a liberal, not a strict interpretation. While an attorney fees motion should be timely\n\n                                              80\n\ffiled, the rule provisions are mandatory but not jurisdictional, and on a proper showing\n\nunder section 473, the trial court may grant relief for such mistake, inadvertence,\n\nsurprise, or excusable neglect. (Russell v. Trans Pacific Group, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th\n\n1717, 1728-1729.)\n\n        In a previous order, we granted in part the City's judicial notice request, to permit\n\nadditional materials on the attorney fee questions to be considered on appeal. They show\n\nthe same basic history of the enactment of the predecessor rule (rule 870.2) that was\n\noutlined in Sanabria v. Embrey (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422, 428, as follows. That\n\npredecessor rule incorporated other stated time periods for filing a notice of appeal and a\n\nfees motion, as shown in Administrative Office of the Courts memoranda. From this\n\nhistory, the appellate court concluded, \"It is therefore clear that . . . rule 870.2 provides\n\ntime limits for motions for attorney fees in all civil cases, and its 60-day time limit\n\ncommences to run at notice of entry of judgment or dismissal.\" (Sanabria, supra, at p.\n\n429.)\n\n        From its rulemaking history materials, of which judicial notice has been taken, the\n\nCity now argues the trial court should not have heard the fees motion of either CYAC or\n\nthe Interested Parties, because they were not filed according to the 30-day deadline of\n\nCode of Civil Procedure section 870, but were filed within 60 days, under the alternative\n\nrule provisions. The City claims that there was no excusable neglect, because the portion\n\nof rule 3.1702(a) referring to \"except as otherwise provided by statute\" should have been\n\neasily interpreted to apply the 30-day deadline of Code of Civil Procedure section 870.\n\n\n\n                                              81\n\f       In its October 2011 opposition to the motion for section 473 relief, the City further\n\nargued it would be prejudiced if such relief were granted, due to its imminent financial\n\nobligations under the recent legislation dissolving all redevelopment agencies and\n\nrequiring the successor agencies to wind down their operations. The City referred to\n\nthen-pending litigation about the legislation, which might affect the City's liability for a\n\nfee award as a judgment.\n\n       In granting relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 and rule 3.1702(d),\n\nthe trial court correctly stated it was empowered to relieve a party from the failure to\n\nmeet a procedural time limit, upon a proper showing, and that the applications were\n\ntimely and accompanied by the proposed pleading. The court ruled that CYAC's counsel,\n\nand by joinder, counsel for the Interested Parties, had shown there was a reasonable and\n\nhonest mistake of law in the late filing, so that the fees applications should be heard on\n\ntheir merits. We agree that this was a proper resolution of these inconsistent rules and\n\nprovisions, and there was no inexcusable neglect by counsel in interpreting them.\n\n       To reach this conclusion, we need not answer the precise question posed by the\n\nappeal and the cross-appeal, of whether the 30- or 60-day deadline properly applies, but\n\ninstead, we rule only that the court was justified in granting relief under Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 473 and rule 3.1702(d), and therefore the fees motions were properly\n\nheard on their merits. We next turn to the legal foundations of the awards themselves.\n\n\n\n\n                                             82\n\f                 B. PRA, Government Code section 6259, Subdivision (d)\n                            Requirements for Fees Awards\n\n       \"The [PRA] sets forth specific procedures for seeking a judicial determination of a\n\npublic agency's obligation to disclose records in the event the agency denies a request by\n\na member of the public.\" (Filarsky v. Superior Court (2002) 28 Cal.4th 419, 426\n\n(Filarsky).) Under Government Code section 6258, \"[a]ny person may institute\n\nproceedings for injunctive or declarative relief or writ of mandate in any court of\n\ncompetent jurisdiction to enforce his or her right to inspect or to receive a copy of any\n\npublic record or class of public records under this chapter.\"\n\n       Under Government Code section 6259, subdivision (a), \"if it appears from the\n\nplaintiff's verified petition that 'certain public records are being improperly withheld from\n\na member of the public . . . ,' the court shall order the officer or person charged with\n\nwithholding the records to disclose the public record or show cause why he or she should\n\nnot do so. . . . 'If the Court finds that the public official's decision to refuse disclosure\n\nwas not justified under Section 6254 or 6255, he or she shall order the public official to\n\nmake the record public.' (§ 6259, subd. (b).)\" (Galbiso, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1063,\n\n1084.)28 \"[T]he standard test for determining if a plaintiff has prevailed under the Public\n\n\n\n28      In Galbiso, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1063, 1089, there were \"highly unique\ncircumstances presented\" that justified an award of fees. The public agency had\nunjustifiably denied the plaintiff any \"access to all public records by means of making\nGalbiso leave the premises if and when she sought to inspect documents, [and] Galbiso's\nsuccess in the lawsuit was adequately demonstrated by her vindication of her basic right\nof access under the [PRA, and thus,] Galbiso was a prevailing party entitled to an award\nof attorney fees under section 6259, subdivision (d) . . . .\" (Galbiso, supra, at p. 1089;\nitalics omitted.)\n                                               83\n\fRecords Act is whether or not the litigation caused a previously withheld document to be\n\nreleased.\" (Id. at p. 1088.) In the case before us, such remedies were never obtained.\n\n       Government Code section 6259, subdivision (d) provides: \" 'The court shall award\n\ncourt costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff should the plaintiff prevail in\n\nlitigation filed pursuant to this section.' \" (Filarsky, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 427; italics\n\nadded.) If the plaintiff pursued more than one legal theory, apportionment of fees is\n\nrequired by statute.\n\n       The case before us is somewhat anomalous in that the subject requested records\n\nwere never produced, i.e., the lost field survey data and the missing police department\n\nproperty-to-property crime reports from the past three years. The question then arises\n\nwhether CYAC has actually \"prevailed\" within the meaning of section 6259,\n\nsubdivision (d), by suing and causing the agency to release previously withheld\n\ndocuments. (Belth v. Garamendi (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 896, 898 [Gov. Code, § 6259,\n\nsubd. (d), mandates an award of attorney fees \"to a plaintiff who prevails in litigation\n\nfiled under the [PRA]\"].) \"An action under the [PRA] results in the release of previously\n\nwithheld documents if the lawsuit motivated the defendants to produce the documents.\"\n\n(Rogers v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 469, 482.) Not so here. Accordingly,\n\nthese observations in Galbiso, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1063, 1087, are well taken here:\n\n           \"[Government Code] Section 6259 expressly applies '[w]henever it\n           is made to appear by verified petition . . . that certain public records\n           are being improperly withheld from a member of the public,' and a\n           judicial determination is necessary to resolve the issue. [Citation.]\n           We believe the language of [Government Code] section 6259 is\n           sufficiently broad to include the present lawsuit. That is, where a\n           means is employed by a public agency to effectively deny access to\n\n                                              84\n\f          all public records and a lawsuit is filed to remedy the problem, that\n          lawsuit would constitute a claim that 'certain public records are\n          being improperly withheld from a member of the public' within the\n          scope of section 6259.\" (Italics omitted.)\n\n       Government Code section 6259 should be interpreted in light of \"the overall\n\nremedial purpose of the Public Records Act to broaden access to public records.\"\n\n(Galbiso, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1063, 1088; Filarsky, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 427.)\n\n\"Indeed, the very purpose of the attorney fees provision is to provide 'protections and\n\nincentives for members of the public to seek judicial enforcement of their right to inspect\n\npublic records subject to disclosure.' \" (Galbiso, supra, at p. 1088.)\n\n       In light of these statutory policies, we conclude that CYAC may qualify as a\n\n\"prevailing\" party, since CYAC sought and obtained declaratory relief that there had been\n\nPRA violations, and we have found the record supports that conclusion by the trial court.\n\nIt would not be a practical or reasonable interpretation of Government Code section 6259,\n\nsubdivision (d), to say that a public agency is protected from liability for an attorney fee\n\naward, because it cannot or will not produce the documents due to its internal logistical\n\nproblems or general neglect of duties. However, we do not decide the entitlement issues\n\non this record, but remand for the trial court to determine all the fee issues, upon remand.\n\nAlong with the Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 fee issues, next to be discussed,\n\nthe CYAC fee motion must be returned to the trial court to determine any reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                             85\n\fattorney fees or apportionment regarding the PRA claim (only one of CYAC's seven\n\ncauses of action).29\n\n    C. Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; Remand for Discretion of Trial Court\n\n       The principles for considering an award of fees under Code of Civil Procedure\n\nsection 1021.5 are now well settled. The statute seeks to address the problem of\n\n\"inherent unaffordability of legal services for public interest cases yielding primarily\n\nnonpecuniary benefits.\" (Conservatorship of Whitley (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1206, 1225\n\n(Whitley).) Eligibility for such attorney fees awards is established when \" '(1) plaintiffs'\n\naction \"has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public\n\ninterest,\" (2) \"a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been\n\nconferred on the general public or a large class of persons\" and (3) \"the necessity and\n\nfinancial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.\" ' \"\n\n(Id. at p. 1214.) Each requirement must be met, and the trial court's award is evaluated de\n\nnovo for its consistency with these applicable legal principles, on the available record.\n\n(Id. at p. 1213; In re Vitamin Cases (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1052.)\n\n       In Whitley, supra, 50 Cal.4th 1206, 1221, the Supreme Court made it clear that for\n\npurposes of applying these requirements, the court should assess the criterion of the\n\n\n29     Although we have found CYAC may qualify as a prevailing party on the PRA\nclaims, we feel compelled to observe that CYAC only prevailed with regard to two\nclasses of documents. The record clearly shows that CYAC received a very large number\nof documents from the City without the necessity of declaratory relief. Thus, on remand,\nthe court in determining reasonable attorney fees should focus on the amount of effort\nreasonably related to the limited scope of the PRA declaratory relief that was granted,\nand the relationship of the relief to the CRL orders. (See Bell, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 689-690.)\n                                             86\n\ffinancial burden of litigation not with attention to the subjective motives of the litigant,\n\nbut must consider the \"objective financial incentives\" for litigation, in deciding the third\n\nelement for eligibility for fees, whether \" 'the necessity and financial burden of private\n\nenforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.' \" (Id. at p. 1214.) Even if that\n\nelement is met, the trial court must also decide the remaining issues about any resulting\n\nenforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, or any significant benefit\n\nconferred in that respect. (Ibid.) If those tests are met, the trial court \"may legitimately\n\nrestrict the award to only that portion of the attorneys' efforts that furthered the litigation\n\nof issues of public importance.\" (Whitley, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 1226.)30\n\n       In this case, we cannot determine what proportion of the existing attorney fee\n\nawards were attributable to the federal due process theories. As CYAC already\n\nrecognized, by deleting its fee requests regarding its unsuccessful state constitutional\n\nclaims, no award on them would be proper. Although all the basic issues were closely\n\nintertwined at trial, the specific statutory claims under the CRL (and as to CYAC, the\n\nlimited PRA issues) were dispositive. The trial court's substantive ruling on the\n\nprocedural due process claims went too far, and accordingly, neither of its attorney fee\n\nawards was fully supported by the applicable legal principles. On remand, \"further\n\n\n\n30      The City's judicial notice request, as granted, included two sets of 2012 bill history\nand veto messages for two pieces of legislation that the Governor vetoed, that would have\nrestored some of the redevelopment powers that were taken away from municipalities in\n2011. The City argues this material shows there was no significant public interest in the\nsubject matter of this lawsuit and no support for any awards of private attorney general\nfees. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.5.) We need not decide that issue and return the entire set\nof attorney fee entitlement issues to the trial court.\n                                              87\n\fconsideration and amplification of reasoning\" will be required to determine the extent to\n\nwhich fees awards are proper regarding the remaining statutory theories, the CRL as to\n\nboth prevailing parties, and the PRA as to CYAC only.

Code, § 33000 et seq., the Community Redevelopment Law (CRL); all\n\nfurther statutory references are to the Health & Safety Code unless noted.) During the\n\nCity's months-long amendment and hearing process, it received statutorily mandated\n\nreports from a retained private consultant, held noticed hearings, and received opposition\n\nfrom two sets of landowners within the Amendment area, plaintiff and appellant\n\nCommunity Youth Athletic Center (CYAC), and additional respondents, Robert Leif,\n\nSuzanne Leif and Anthony Bedford (the \"Interested Parties\"). (§§ 33352, subd.

Proc., § 860 et\n\nseq., the Validation Act), to seek declaratory and injunctive relief and damages under\n\nseveral statutory and constitutional theories, along with attorney fees and costs. (CRL,\n\n§§ 33500, 33501; Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq., Public Records Act (PRA) violations; U.S.\n\nConst., 14th Amend. (due process clause); 42 U.S.C. § 1988.) The response filed by the\n\nInterested Parties sought similar relief.\n\n       After a bench trial, the superior court issued a statement of decision and judgment\n\nin favor of CYAC, the Interested Parties and the interested public. In the reverse\n\nvalidation proceedings, the trial court examined the administrative record and set aside\n\nthe Amendment to the redevelopment plan, by issuing declaratory relief based on its\n\nfindings of several violations of the CRL: (1) contrary to the provisions of section\n\n33457.1, the City failed to include in its mandated report, prior to the hearing on such\n\nAmendment, the maps required by section 33352, subdivision (b) that documented the\n\nphysical and economic conditions of blight that existed within the project area, (2) the\n\nadministrative record did not contain substantial evidence supporting the physical blight\n\nfindings underlying the Amendment, and (3) neither the City nor its retained private\n\nconsultant (Rosenow Spevacek Group, or \"RSG\") had produced, on request by CYAC,\n\ntwo types of underlying raw data relied upon in the RSG \"Report to Council\" (the\n\n\"RTC\") (i.e., RSG's field surveys of blight conditions, or the City's police department's\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fproperty-by-property crime data).2 The City had relied on those RSG field surveys and\n\ncrime data to support the enactment of the Amendment which extended the eminent\n\ndomain redevelopment power, as they led to the RTC's conclusions that physical and\n\neconomic blight existed within the project area, but the record did not support that\n\nreliance.\n\n       In an underlying finding, the trial court concluded that the administrative record\n\nnevertheless contained \"substantial evidence\" of a condition of economic blight (by using\n\ncrime statistics City-wide). However, since the record failed to contain \"substantial\n\nevidence of at least one condition of physical blight,\" and since both findings were\n\nneeded, the Amendment was declared invalid. (§§ 33030, subd. (b); 33031, subds. (a),\n\n(b); 33333.2, subd. (a)(4).)\n\n       Additionally, the trial court issued declaratory relief on the ground that the City\n\nhad violated the PRA, by failing to produce at the request of CYAC certain documents\n\nabout the same two types of underlying raw data relied upon in the RTC (field surveys of\n\nblight conditions, and property-by-property crime data), which the City had used to\n\njustify its blight claims.\n\n\n\n\n2       Section 33457.1 provides: \"To the extent warranted by a proposed amendment to\na redevelopment plan, (1) the ordinance adopting an amendment to a redevelopment plan\nshall contain the findings required by Section 33367 and (2) the reports and information\nrequired by Section 33352 shall be prepared and made available to the public prior to the\nhearing on such amendment.\" (Italics added.) Section 33367, subdivision (d) requires\nthe redevelopment ordinance or amendment to include findings of, inter alia, its necessity\nto alleviate blight conditions, \"based on clearly articulated and documented evidence.\"\n                                              4\n\f       Further, the court determined that the federal procedural due process rights of\n\nCYAC and the public had not been adequately protected by the City during the\n\namendment process, due to the City's failure to comply with CRL statutory requirements\n\nor to grant a continuance of the hearing. The court issued declaratory relief finding\n\nfederal due process violations and awarded nominal damages ($1). (U.S. Const., 14th\n\nAmend. [due process clause]; Mathews v. Eldridge (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mathews).)\n\nHowever, CYAC's alternative California Constitution due process causes of action were\n\nfound to lack merit. (Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7(a), 19 [due process and takings clauses].)\n\n       After trial, the court ordered the City to pay substantial attorney fees to CYAC\n\n($1,906,516.75) and to the Interested Parties ($84,652.50). The court had initially\n\ndetermined that their requests were untimely filed, but that discretionary relief from\n\ndefault should be granted to entertain the fees motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702;\n\nall further rule references are to the California Rules of Court; Code Civ. Proc., § 473,\n\n1021.5; 42 U.S.C. § 1988; Gov. Code, § 6259, subd. (d).)\n\n       The City appeals the judgment and in the consolidated appeal (D061141), the fee\n\norders. CYAC has filed a cross-appeal of a portion of the underlying findings on the\n\nreverse validation decision (to challenge the trial court's ruling regarding economic\n\nblight, that City-wide crime data was correctly considered by the City, rather than just\n\nproject-wide data). (§ 33031, subd. (b)(7); CYAC does not cross-appeal the dismissal of\n\nits California Constitution claims.)\n\n       CYAC has also cross-appealed on a timeliness issue regarding its attorney fees\n\nrequest, since the trial court granted CYAC and the Interested Parties discretionary relief\n\n                                              5\n\ffrom the untimely filing, then awarded fees. However, CYAC contends there was no late\n\nfiling in the first place that gave rise to any such need for such relief. (Rule 3.1702; Code\n\nCiv. Proc., § 473.)\n\n       In a previous order, we granted in part and denied in part the City's judicial notice\n\nrequest, to permit additional materials on the attorney fee questions to be considered on\n\nappeal. (See part V, post.)3\n\n       On the merits of the appeal and cross-appeal, first, our review of the\n\nadministrative record persuades us that the trial court's reverse validation order is well\n\nsupported by the facts and the law, concerning the CRL violations of sections 33352 and\n\n33457.1 (map requirement and description of specific, quantifiable evidence supporting\n\nthe blight findings). Although the Legislature abolished redevelopment agencies through\n\nits 2011 legislation, the issues regarding the invalidity of this Amendment have not\n\nbecome moot by the passage of time or the subsequent legislative action, particularly as\n\nto the attorney fees awards. (§ 33037, subd.

Ordinance and Complaint; Prior Appeal on Publication\n\n       In broad outline, with more specialized facts to be added in the discussion portion\n\nof this opinion, the City's 1995 redevelopment plan and its amendments (the plan)\n\nauthorized the use of eminent domain in the area where the CYAC and Interested Parties'\n\nproperties are located, based on designations of blight. (§ 33037, subd. (c).) There are\n\n692 parcels in the overall 300-acre Amendment area. On its parcel, CYAC operates a\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fboxing gym and athletic facility that serves at-risk youth as a community center. The\n\nInterested Parties and their lessees conduct business on their property.\n\n       As proposed, the 2007 Amendment reduced the area subject to eminent domain\n\nand restricted its use on residential properties, and focused on two business corridors\n\n(Civic Center Drive and National City Boulevard) and the harbor district area, where\n\nsome environmental contamination existed due to previous industrial uses there. The\n\nCity sought to amend the plan to extend the time for eminent domain proceedings to be\n\nconducted under redevelopment powers until 2017. The City was interested in allowing\n\nthe construction of condominium developments in the designated area, as a\n\nredevelopment measure.\n\n       In preparation for amending the plan, the City's Commission hired the consulting\n\nfirm of RSG, an independent contractor, to prepare reports required under the CRL. RSG\n\nassisted the Commission (sometimes designated the agency) in preparing and publishing\n\nthe initial notice of the public hearings on the Amendment, both through mail notice to\n\ntaxing agencies and through newspaper publication. From February 2007 to June 2007,\n\nRSG was in the process of drafting its report to the council (the RTC) on the need for the\n\nAmendment. RSG's contract with the City's Commission provided that this agency\n\nwould have the property rights to the memoranda, reports, maps, drawings, plans,\n\nspecifications and other documents prepared by RSG for the project, and all of these\n\nwould be turned over to the agency upon completion of the project.\n\n       On April 17, 2007, a hearing was held by the City Council to adopt a resolution to\n\nauthorize circulation and public review of the Amendment, and to set a public hearing for\n\n                                             9\n\fJune 19, 2007 to consider adoption of the Amendment. The Council's agenda statement\n\nattached a map indicating the boundary around the parcels that would be subject to the\n\nAmendment (the \"boundary parcel map\").\n\n      In May 2007, notice of the June hearing was mailed to all affected tax agencies,\n\nand to all affected property owners, businesses and residents. The same boundary parcel\n\nmap that was attached to the April 17, 2007 Council Agenda Statement was also provided\n\nwith the May 11, 2007 mailing.\n\n      In May 2007, CYAC retained expert witnesses to oppose the Amendment and\n\nbegan the process of requesting numerous documents that related in any way to the\n\nproposed amendment for the project area, which included CYAC. On May 23, it sought\n\n\"Any and all blight studies that have been performed that specifically deal with National\n\nCity Boulevard and its surrounding areas or any other blight studies that have been\n\nperformed for National City since 2000. Please include any documents that show the\n\nactual areas the City or CDC included in conducting the blight study. [¶] Any and all\n\nblight studies the CDC or City will rely on in support of the redevelopment plan or\n\neminent domain proceedings.\" CYAC's May 23 request relied upon the federal Freedom\n\nof Information Act (FOIA). (5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq.)6\n\n      City staff members responded to CYAC that such a \"blight study\" was also called\n\nthe RTC, and that the City planned to make it and other reports available approximately\n\n\n6      Judicial interpretations of the FOIA in the federal courts may be used to construe\nthe PRA.

(Gov.\n\nCode, § 54954.2, subd. (a).)\n\n       In June 2007, the City published three weekly notices in local newspapers, to give\n\nnotice of the upcoming June 19, 2007 public hearing. On June 14, 2007, three business\n\ndays before the hearing, the City released to the public for review its 37-page RTC\n\nrecommending adoption of the Amendment. The RTC detailed in writing different types\n\nof blight conditions that it found were remaining in the Amendment area, and stated it\n\nhad relied on six major sources in that analysis and assessment, including \"the April 2007\n\nfield survey by RSG,\" and \"Information from the National City police department.\" The\n\nRTC concluded that such blight could not be eliminated without the use of eminent\n\ndomain.\n\n       The RTC referred in passing to 2005 findings by the United States Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (the Brownfields Studies) about environmental contamination existing\n\nin part of the Amendment area. (See fn. 3, ante.) No map was attached to the RTC made\n\navailable to the public, to show where in the project any particular blighting conditions\n\nexisted. (See fns. 1, 2, ante, text of CRL statutes requiring such a map.)\n\n       On June 15, 2007, CYAC sent three PRA requests to the City, referencing the\n\nsame boundary parcel map that had been attached to the April 17, 2007 council agenda\n\nand the City's notice of hearing. On June 17, 2007, CYAC, represented by a law firm,\n\nthe Institute of Justice, sent a letter to the City objecting to the Amendment on various\n\nstatutory and constitutional grounds.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       At the June 19, 2007 public hearing, the City Council heard opposition from\n\nCYAC and the Interested Parties and other citizens to the adoption of the Amendment.\n\nCYAC filed 34 pages of written objections to the Amendment. CYAC obtained\n\npermission from the City to file its six-volume appendix in opposition to the plan. The\n\nCity denied CYAC's request for a continuance of the hearing, but allowed its additional\n\nwritten objections to be received after the hearing.\n\n       In July 2007, the City Council approved a negative declaration for the\n\nAmendment, and prepared written responses to written objections to the Amendment, as\n\nfiled by members of the public.\n\n       On July 10, 2007, the City provided to the public four maps of the Amendment\n\narea showing the different types of blighting conditions on which it relied as justification\n\nfor the Amendment (i.e., structural obsolescence, incompatible adjacent uses,\n\ndeterioration and dilapidation, or defective design without parking). (§ 33352, subd. (b).)\n\nOn July 17, 2007, the ordinance approving the Amendment was adopted, incorporating\n\nby reference documents contained in earlier studies.7\n\n       After several more PRA requests and much further communication, discussion,\n\nclarification, and objections taking place between June and August 2007, the City\n\n\n7       In the reply brief, the City, after first admitting in the opening brief that no map\nwas attached to the council's copy of the RTC in June 2007, now contends that the\nboundary parcel map was timely provided to the council. This was the same boundary\nparcel map that had been provided with the May 2007 mailed notice to taxing agencies\nand property owners. However, it is still not disputed that the more detailed maps later\nprovided in July 2007, identifying the four types of claimed blighting conditions, were\nnot attached to the RTC when it was made available to the council or the public June 14,\n2007.\n                                             12\n\fsupplied at least three additional sets of informational documents to CYAC. (See pts. II,\n\nIII, post.)\n\n        In September 2007, CYAC brought this action seeking a judicial declaration that\n\nthe Amendment was invalid on a number of specific grounds, including noncompliance\n\nwith the procedures of the CRL. In particular, its first, fifth, and sixth causes of action\n\nalleged that the City failed to release or complete its reports or maps on the matter in a\n\ntimely fashion, thus preventing the public from preparing any effective objections to the\n\nproposed Amendment, or from obtaining documents related to the required substantial\n\nevidence of existing blight and alleviation of blight through the proposed redevelopment.\n\n        In its second cause of action alleging violations of federal constitutional\n\nprotections, CYAC contended it was deprived of procedural due process of law affecting\n\nthe proposed use of its property (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.). In its third and fourth\n\ncauses of action alleging state constitutional violations, CYAC claimed the eminent\n\ndomain law was being used for constitutionally illegitimate purposes, such as economic\n\ndevelopment or increasing tax revenue. All these constitutional claims were alleged\n\nseparately from the statutory causes of action. The prayer requested a declaration that the\n\nCity had violated CYAC's procedural due process rights to a meaningful opportunity to\n\nbe heard, and it sought invalidation of the ordinance and other relief (injunction and\n\ndamages).\n\n        In its seventh cause of action, CYAC sought to compel the City to disclose\n\nnumerous public records relied on by the City to support the blight designations\n\nunderlying the Amendment. (PRA, Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq.)\n\n                                              13\n\f       As explained in two prior opinions issued by this court, CYAC obtained a court\n\norder through noticed ex parte proceedings for the publication of the summons, which\n\nwas directed toward the City and to \"All Persons Interested in the Matter of the\n\nAmendment to National City's Redevelopment Plan as Adopted by [the ordinance].\"\n\n(Community Youth Athletic Center v.

CYAC encountered\n\ndifficulties with the publication process in English and Spanish newspapers, when one of\n\nthe newspapers unexpectedly changed its publication schedule, and ultimately, the\n\nsummons that was published after some delay retained an incorrect date for responses by\n\nany interested parties (i.e., the published summons contained the date for response as\n\noriginally anticipated, thus advancing the allowable response period following\n\npublication, from Monday, Nov. 19 to Friday, Nov. 16, 2007).

The trial court ruled in favor of the City, and CYAC\n\nappealed. We reversed, allowing republication and further notice proceedings.\n\n                     B. Renewed Litigation After 2009 Prior Appeal\n\n       Back on track, the parties negotiated the contents of the administrative record, for\n\npurposes of litigating the reverse validation issues.

The Interested Parties were granted leave to appear\n\nand respond, pleading similar theories.8\n\n       Extensive motion practice continued, in which CYAC pursued a motion for\n\nsummary adjudication on the PRA claims, opposed by the City. The court denied the\n\nmotion, ruling that there were remaining disputed material facts about whether the raw\n\ndata regarding the blight studies created by the private consultant, RSG, constituted\n\npublic records subject to disclosure.\n\n       Discovery disputes ensued, followed by motions to compel production of records\n\nor quash subpoenas. The City pursued a summary adjudication motion on the CYAC\n\nconstitutional claims, both federal and state. Opposition was filed. The court denied the\n\nmotion, ruling that the City could not establish on the undisputed evidence that CYAC\n\nhad been afforded sufficient notice and documentation of the blight conditions to satisfy\n\ndue process standards. The court relied on the test in Mathews, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and\n\nstated \"what passes muster for constitutional due process is fact dependent.\" The court\n\nalso ruled that the City had not yet established whether the two California constitutional\n\nclaims, alleging wrongful taking of property, were totally without merit, since CYAC\n\nwas also alleging that the process of adopting the redevelopment plan and blight\n\ndesignation was commenced for improper purposes.\n\n\n\n\n8       In their reply brief, the Interested Parties state they are responding to the City's\nappeal only on the reverse validation and attorney fees issues. Their responsive pleading\nis in the nature of a cross-complaint that asserts CRL violations. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 863.)\n                                             15\n\f       In preparation for trial, the City sought to sever the PRA issues, but the court\n\ndenied the motion. It had become known that the City's consultant RSG had routinely\n\npurged its records after completing the RTC, and had not retained copies of the raw data\n\nin the form of its field survey spreadsheets that were compiled by staff persons who\n\nwalked the area to be covered by the Amendment, as they investigated physical blighting\n\nconditions.\n\n       Back in May 2007, the City police department's crime analyst sent RSG a chart\n\ncontaining three years of crime data (the \"three-year chart\") which RSG used to prepare a\n\ntable of crime rates from 2006 for the RTC. However, the raw data used by the City's\n\nanalyst to prepare the three-year chart was no longer available.\n\n       CYAC brought a motion seeking an order for sanctions for alleged spoliation of\n\nboth kinds of that \"critical evidence.\" The City filed opposition. The court denied the\n\nmotions, ruling there was no evidence from which the court could reasonably infer\n\nintentional or willful conduct by City agents or employees to destroy either the raw data\n\nused by the consultant (field surveys) or any background data compiled by the City police\n\ndepartment (crime statistics).\n\n       Trial briefs and motions in limine were filed, as well as motions for judicial notice.\n\nIn limine, the court ruled that with respect to the reverse validation claims, review was\n\nlimited to the administrative record.9 However, on the PRA and constitutional issues,\n\n\n\n9      Apparently, neither the crime table referred to in the RTC, or the three-year chart\nthat had been supplied to RSG for study, was actually included in the RTC or in the\nadministrative record. However, the RTC discusses its conclusions, and the three-year\n                                             16\n\ftestimony and trial exhibits going beyond the administrative record were allowed to be\n\npresented, and a lengthy bench trial took place. The parties requested a statement of\n\ndecision and prepared drafts.\n\n          C. 2011 Statement of Decision and Judgment; Attorney Fees Awards\n\n       In its April 20, 2011 statement of decision, the trial court found on the reverse\n\nvalidation claims that the City's lack of compliance with CRL requirements resulted in a\n\nlack of support for the Amendment, due to the failure to include the required map\n\nattachment in the RTC. (§ 33352, subd. (b).) Additionally, the court ruled the\n\nadministrative record did not contain \"specific, quantifiable evidence about the location\n\nand prevalence of the alleged blighting conditions,\" to show a serious physical and\n\neconomic burden on the community, as required by section 33030, subdivision (b)(1) and\n\nsection 33352, subdivision (b)(2). Even though the RTC and administrative record\n\ncontained \"substantial evidence\" of one condition of economic blight (using crime\n\nstatistics City-wide), they still \"did not have substantial evidence of at least one condition\n\nof physical blight.\" (§ 33031, subds. (a), (b).) Thus, even if some blight conditions\n\nexisted in the Amendment area, the administrative record did not contain substantial\n\nevidence that there were substantial and prevalent amounts of blighting conditions, or\n\nthat any such conditions could not be eliminated without the use of eminent domain.\n\n(§ 33333.2, subd. (a)(4).) Declaratory relief was issued invalidating the Amendment.\n\n\nchart submitted to RSG by the police department was admitted as an exhibit at trial. The\ncourt also granted CYAC's request to augment the administrative record, to include fire\ndispatch reports previously requested to be produced. However, the court denied a\nCYAC request to augment the record with certain evidentiary presumptions.\n                                             17\n\f       On the PRA, the trial court's key findings were (a) both forms of raw data relied\n\non by the RTC and the City, the property-by-property field surveys conducted by RSG\n\nand the property-by-property crime data for three years before the PRA request was\n\nmade, constituted public records; (b) CYAC's various PRA requests were not unduly\n\nbroad or vague, and thus (c) the City did not undertake a reasonable search for the\n\nrequested information, nor carry its burden of showing that it justifiably withheld public\n\nrecords that were in the possession of its consultant, RSG, or in the possession of its\n\npolice department when the requests were made. Specifically, \"The Court holds that a\n\nreasonable search requires the agency to: (1) ask the known custodian of records for (2)\n\nthe documents requested in the PRA request.\" (Italics added.) Thus, the court impliedly\n\nfound that the City should have conveyed to the consultant the same request language\n\nthat CYAC sent to the City. Although the court stated the City staff members had\n\ndemonstrated evident neglect of their duties, the court was \"not convinced that the\n\nviolations of the PRA were intentional or that the City refused to attempt to obtain\n\ndocuments from its consultant.\" The court issued declaratory relief finding such\n\nviolations of the PRA, but denied any injunctive relief, on the basis there was no showing\n\nof any need for prospective relief.\n\n       Regarding federal due process, the trial court made a series of rulings. First, the\n\nCity was found to have violated \"CYAC's right to procedural due process under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment with respect to its failure to timely provide the maps with the\n\nRTC, which were required by statute.\" (Italics added.) The trial court determined that\n\nthe \"City's decision to provide CYAC with the RTC only three business days before the\n\n                                             18\n\fpublic hearing, and at that time its failure to provide any underlying data and without the\n\nrequired maps, created an unreasonable risk of erroneous deprivation,\" denying CYAC its\n\nprocedural due process rights. The trial court also concluded, \"at a minimum, a\n\ncontinuance of the public hearing upon request was required.\"\n\n       In its federal due process findings, the trial court continued: \"The evidence in this\n\ncase presents a troubling picture where the [City] appears to have intentionally provided\n\nnotices and scheduled all of the public hearings so as to provide as little time as possible\n\nto meaningfully prepare any opposition. The RTC itself was vaguely written.\" The City\n\nhad compounded this process by failing to provide the statutorily required maps with the\n\nRTC, by failing to respond promptly to PRA requests for crime data and property survey\n\ninformation, by unjustifiably claiming the survey data were not public records, and by\n\nfailing to secure that information during litigation to prevent it from being destroyed.\n\n(§ 33352, subd. (b).)\n\n       However, to the extent that CYAC seemed to be making a constitutional challenge\n\nto section 33457.1 (either facially or as applied), the trial court found that the notice and\n\naccess to the RTC as provided by the City, pursuant to that section, did not create a\n\nfurther or broader denial of due process. (See fn. 2, ante.) Essentially, the court found\n\nthe City had substantially complied with the notice requirements of section 33452, and\n\nCYAC had been able to protect its rights and to prepare and submit extensive opposition\n\nto the Amendment, based upon its own investigation and the material made known to it.\n\n       The court thus declined to make a broad finding that any particular number of\n\nweeks or months of access to the RTC must have been provided to the public by the City,\n\n                                              19\n\fpursuant to the terms of section 33457.1. Declaratory relief and $1 in nominal damages\n\nwere awarded to CYAC. With respect to the claims under the California Constitution,\n\nthe court found them to be premature due to the lack of any eminent domain proceedings\n\nthat had been initiated by the City. Judgment was issued in favor of CYAC.\n\n       Following requests for prevailing party attorney fees and costs by CYAC and the\n\nInterested Parties, the trial court granted them relief from default for late filing pursuant\n\nto Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), based on its interpretation of rule\n\n3.1702 and related provisions. (Rules 8.104, 8.108.) The court ruled on the merits that\n\nboth CYAC and the Interested Parties were entitled to attorney fees awards under several\n\nstatutory provisions, including Title 42 United States Code section 1988, Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 1021.5 and Government Code section 6259, subdivision (d).

(Pts. II, III, post.) We can then\n\naddress the propriety of the declaratory relief issued on the federal due process issues, as\n\nwell as the attorney fees issues, both on the appeal and cross-appeal. (Pts.

(11 Miller & Starr, Cal.

The briefs on appeal have only minimally addressed this dramatic legal\n\ndevelopment.11\n\n       We are required to review the existing ordinances and redevelopment actions in\n\nthe time frame in which they were conducted, in this case, 2007. (See County of Los\n\n\n\n10     On another point, the Court in Matosantos, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> invalidated a\nprovision that would have provided for the continuation of redevelopment agencies if the\nlocal governing body agreed to make substantial payments to fund education and other\nfunctions.

We do not speculate what action the City may take in the future to pursue\n\nany eminent domain powers based on blight designations within the area affected by the\n\nAmendment.

The attorney fees issues raised in this appeal serve to\n\nkeep these validation and related issues alive, despite the major changes in\n\nredevelopment law.\n\n       Our review of the judgment is conducted in view of the trial court's issuance of a\n\ndetailed statement of decision that addressed each of the above-described substantive\n\nareas.

Section 33030 refers, inter alia, to the\n\ndefinitions of conditions that cause physical blight (§ 33031 (subd. (a)), and economic\n\nblight (§ 33031, subd. (b)). Formerly, section 33031, subdivisions (a)(1) and (2) each\n\ncontained general language allowing \"other similar factors\" to be used to support a\n\nphysical blight designation, but in 2006, the Legislature removed that general language.\n\nThe Legislature also added language to section 33352 that required \"specific [and]\n\nquantifiable evidence\" to document alleged blight conditions to be included in the reports\n\nprepared for the legislative body, here, the City Council.12 The same reports and\n\n\n\n12    As part of the 2006 amendments, section 33352 was amended to add the italicized\nlanguage, showing a more restrictive approach to documenting blight: \"Every\nredevelopment plan submitted by the agency to the legislative body shall be accompanied\n                                             25\n\finformation required by section 33352 must, under section 33457.1, be made available to\n\nthe public prior to the redevelopment amendment hearing.13\n\n       Under section 33333.2, subdivision (a)(4), the 12-year time limitation for eminent\n\ndomain ordinance authorizations may be extended only by amendment of the\n\nredevelopment plan after the agency finds, based on substantial evidence, both of the\n\nfollowing: \"(A) That significant blight remains within the project area.

CRL Rulings\n\n       Many of the topics in the trial court's detailed analysis of the various blight\n\nshowings regarding CYAC's reverse validation claims (first, fifth and sixth causes of\n\naction) are not directly discussed or attacked in this appeal and cross-appeal. We focus\n\non the two major defects that prevented enforceability of this Amendment, and that are\n\nchallenged on appeal: (1) the RTC omitted maps showing the location of blighting\n\nconditions that should have been made available before the time of the June 2007 public\n\nhearing under section 33352, subdivision (b) and section 33457.1; and (2) the\n\nadministrative record, overall, lacked \"specific, quantifiable evidence about the location\n\nand prevalence of the alleged blighting conditions\" under the definitions of section\n\n33352, subdivision (b) (referring in turn to § 33031), such that the administrative record\n\n\"did not have substantial evidence of at least one condition of physical blight.\"14 In\n\nparticular, the RTC had relied on the field surveys prepared by the consulting firm RSG,\n\nbut those field surveys had later been purged from their files and were not available for\n\nproduction by the City.\n\n\n14      Section 33031 subdivision (a) describes physical conditions that cause blight:\n\"(1) Buildings in which it is unsafe or unhealthy for persons to live or work. These\nconditions may be caused by serious building code violations, serious dilapidation and\ndeterioration caused by long-term neglect, construction that is vulnerable to serious\ndamage from seismic or geologic hazards, and faulty or inadequate water or sewer\nutilities. [¶] (2) Conditions that prevent or substantially hinder the viable use or capacity\nof buildings or lots. These conditions may be caused by buildings of substandard,\ndefective, or obsolete design or construction given the present general plan, zoning, or\nother development standards.\" (Note, no issues are raised here on additional subdivisions\nof § 33031, subd. (a)(3) regarding adjacent or nearby incompatible land uses; or\nsubd. (a)(4) regarding existence of subdivided lots in multiple ownership.)\n\n                                             27\n\f       Even though the trial court determined that the administrative record contained\n\n\"substantial evidence\" of one condition of economic blight (by using crime statistics\n\nCity-wide), the RTC still \"did not have substantial evidence of at least one condition of\n\nphysical blight.\" (§ 33031, subds. (a), (b).) And, even accepting that some blight\n\nconditions existed in the Amendment area, the court found the administrative record did\n\nnot contain substantial evidence that there were substantial and prevalent amounts of\n\nblighting conditions, or that they could not be eliminated without the use of eminent\n\ndomain. (§§ 33333.2, subd. (a)(4); 33030, subd. (b)(1); 33352, subd. (b)(2).)\n\n       In its cross-appeal, CYAC attacks the ruling there was some evidence of economic\n\nblight, claiming it was error for the trial court to use crime statistics City-wide. (§ 33031,\n\nsubd. (b)(7).)15 Rather, CYAC argues such economic conditions evidence is only\n\nrelevant project-wide under section 33352, subdivision (b), and it further complains that\n\nthe raw data underlying the crime statistics table referred to in the RTC (but left out) were\n\nnot produced by the City, even though the police department analyst possessed the raw\n\ndata at the time she prepared the three-year chart and sent it to RSG so it could prepare\n\nthe RTC and table. Since evidence of both types of conditions was required, the\n\nAmendment was invalidated, and we shall discuss the cross-appeal's economic blight\n\n\n\n\n15      Section 33031, subdivision (b) describes economic conditions that cause blight:\n\"(1) Depreciated or stagnant property values. [¶] (2) Impaired property values, due in\nsignificant part, to hazardous wastes on property where the agency may be eligible to use\nits [specified] authority . . . . [¶] . . . [¶] (7) A high crime rate that constitutes a serious\nthreat to the public safety and welfare.\"\n                                               28\n\fissues only if the trial court erred in its physical blight analysis. (§§ 33030, subd. (b);\n\n33333.2, subd. (a)(4).)\n\n                                    C. Analysis: Appeal\n\n                   1. Defects in Notice of Hearing and Issuance of RTC\n\n       Under sections 33457.1 and 33352, supporting reports and information must be\n\nprovided to the public before a redevelopment plan is amended, \"prior to the hearing,\"\n\nbut no time frame is stated. (Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 1144.) In that case, the\n\ncourt interpreted section 33352, subdivision (b), as not requiring the raw data regarding\n\nblight conditions to be included in the report or elsewhere in the administrative record,\n\n\"in order for a redevelopment plan to be found valid.\" (Blue, supra, at p. 1142.)\n\nHowever, the court in Blue was interpreting the previous version of that section, which\n\ndid not contain the recently added language requiring \"specific, quantifiable evidence that\n\ndocuments both of the following: [¶] (1) The physical and economic conditions specified\n\nin Section 33031. [¶] (2) That the described physical and economic conditions are so\n\nprevalent and substantial that, collectively, they seriously harm the entire project area.\"\n\n(§ 33352, subd. b; italics added.) More support is now required, but the City seems to\n\nhave been operating under the previous version of the law.\n\n       The requirements for the RTC containing an attached map showing blight\n\nconditions prior to the hearing were admittedly not met. However, the City appears to\n\nargue on appeal that the administrative record as a whole sufficiently and substantially\n\nsupports the Amendment, because this court should find it determinative that the original\n\nboundary parcel map was given to affected landowners with the notice of hearing, and\n\n                                              29\n\flater, four more detailed maps were provided to the public a week before the adoption of\n\nthe Amendment in July (showing the four alleged blighting conditions, under § 33031\n\ndefinitions).\n\n       In its related due process ruling, the trial court determined that the publication of\n\nthe RTC only three business days before the public hearing, and the failure by the City to\n\nprovide any underlying data or the required maps at that time, \"created an unreasonable\n\nrisk of erroneous deprivation\" of CYAC's procedural due process rights. In any case, the\n\ntrial court said that with respect to the validation claims, even if the late filed maps were\n\nconsidered, they still did not contain any substantial evidence \"that there is a substantial\n\namount of this blight or that this blight cannot be eliminated without the use of eminent\n\ndomain.\" (§ 33030, subd. (b).)\n\n       We reject the City's positions that it substantially complied with the CRL\n\nrequirements, or that overall, the administrative record supports the Amendment. First,\n\nunder section 33352, subdivision (b), regarding the provision of information by the\n\nredevelopment agency to the legislative body (City), the RTC was mandated to include\n\nthe following: a description of the physical and economic blighting conditions in the\n\nproject area, including \"a map showing where in the project the conditions exist.\" This\n\ndescription shall contain \"specific, quantifiable evidence\" documenting the conditions,\n\nand showing that the \"physical and economic conditions are so prevalent and substantial\n\nthat, collectively, they seriously harm the entire project area.\" (§ 33352, subd. (b).) The\n\nboundary parcel map originally sent out by the City with notice of the hearing, and\n\nprovided to the City Council in the RTC, did not show any such conditions. The maps\n\n                                              30\n\flater sent out to the public July 10, before the final approval of the Amendment on\n\nJuly 17, delineated the four types of conditions relied upon: structural obsolescence,\n\nincompatible adjacent uses, deterioration and dilapidation, and defective design without\n\nparking. (§ 33352, subd. (b); however, parking is now a relevant concern only with\n\nregard to development standards under § 33031, subd. (a)(2).) Some of these four\n\ncondition maps were apparently supported by the field surveys, which were unavailable\n\nto CYAC. (See also pt. III, post, PRA topic.)\n\n       With respect to the map requirement for the RTC, section 33457.1 additionally\n\nrequired that, \"To the extent warranted by a proposed amendment to a redevelopment\n\nplan . . . the reports and information required by Section 33352 shall be prepared and\n\nmade available to the public prior to the hearing on such amendment.\" (Italics added.)\n\nThus, the trial court was required to make a statutory interpretation of section 33457.1, to\n\nrule on the extent that this Amendment \"warranted\" disclosure of the information\n\nrequired by section 33352, and when. The court reasonably concluded that it was not\n\nenough, under this statutory restriction, for the City not to disclose that required\n\ninformation with maps until a week before the approval of the Amendment. Earlier, the\n\nCity had provided a different map and an incomplete RTC three business days before the\n\npublic hearing of June 19, but that was not enough to constitute substantial compliance\n\nwith either of those requirements.16\n\n\n\n16     In our discussion of the due process arguments on appeal (pt. IV, post), we will\naddress to the extent necessary CYAC's argument that we should judicially impose a time\ndeadline for disclosure of reports, as an interpretation of section 33457.1 (such as 60-90\n                                              31\n\f       The City relies on Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at page 1145, to argue that even\n\nthough the map was not timely provided nor a continuance granted, CYAC was able to\n\nprepare extensive opposition and objections, it could have conducted more of its own\n\ninvestigation, and thus it should not be deemed to have suffered any prejudice in\n\npreparing its opposition. However, the court could reasonably have concluded, and\n\nimpliedly did, that a more focused investigation would have been possible if the statutory\n\ncompliance had been forthcoming, with the use of a map identifying the location of the\n\nblighting conditions being relied upon in the RTC. We agree with the findings of the trial\n\ncourt that this sequence of events in the processing of the Amendment did not qualify as\n\nexcusable error that would permit validation of the Amendment, and it also did not\n\nconstitute such \"error, irregularity, or omission which does not affect the substantial\n\nrights of the parties,\" that accordingly could properly be \"disregarded\" by the court\n\nhearing the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 866.) The Interested Parties were similarly\n\nentitled to more specific descriptions of blight before the hearing.\n\n       We are supported in this conclusion by the legislative history of the 2006\n\namendments to the CRL showing, in relevant part, that more stringent definitions and\n\nquantifiable factual support for alleged conditions of economic and physical blight are\n\nnow required, so that interested public members are kept informed of potential\n\nredevelopment changes affecting them. (Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 832;\n\nHistorical and Statutory Notes, 41 West's Ann. Health & Saf. Code (2010 ed.) foll.\n\n\ndays). (But see Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 831 [such policy decisions are\ngenerally delegated to the Legislature, not the courts].)\n                                             32\n\f§ 33030, p. 451 [\"It is the intent of the Legislature, in amending Sections 33030,\n\n33031 . . . , 33352, 33367 . . . of the Health and Safety Code to restrict the statutory\n\ndefinition of blight and to require better documentation of local officials' findings\n\nregarding the conditions of blight. The legislative purpose of these statutory\n\namendments is to focus public officials' attention and their extraordinary redevelopment\n\npowers on properties with physical and economic conditions that are so significantly\n\ndegraded that they seriously harm the prospects for physical and economic development\n\nwithout the use of redevelopment.\" (Italics added.)].)17\n\n              2. Defects in Data Provided Under CRL Definitions of Blight\n\n       The trial court ruled the administrative record did not contain any substantial\n\n\"specific, quantifiable evidence about the location and prevalence of the alleged blighting\n\nconditions,\" under the definitions of section 33031, subdivision (a)(1), for physical blight.\n\nIn reaching these conclusions, the court adopted the approach set forth in Glendora,\n\nsupra, 185 Cal.App.4th at pages 835 through 836, and in Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at\n\npage 1147 and pages 1149 through 1150, that the meaning of \"significant\" remaining\n\nblight in an amended project area (as required for the use of redevelopment eminent\n\n\n\n17      Under section 33367, an amendment to the ordinance shall contain, inter alia: \"(d)\nThe findings and determinations of the legislative body, which shall be based on clearly\narticulated and documented evidence, that: [¶] (1) The project area is a blighted area, the\nredevelopment of which is necessary to effectuate the public purposes declared in this\npart. [¶] . . . [¶] (11) The elimination of blight and the redevelopment of the project area\ncould not be reasonably expected to be accomplished by private enterprise acting alone\nwithout the aid and assistance of the agency. [¶] . . . [¶] (14) The implementation of the\nredevelopment plan will improve or alleviate the physical and economic conditions of\nblight in the project area, as described in the report prepared pursuant to Section 33352.\"\n                                             33\n\fdomain powers under section 33333.2, subdivision (a)(4)), can be gleaned from the basic\n\ndefinitions of blight contained in sections 33030 and 33031. The court also correctly\n\nobserved that section 33352 now requires substantial evidence of specific quantification\n\nof blight conditions. (§ 33333.2, subd. (a)(4).) This was reflected in the 2006\n\namendments to the CRL, adding to section 33352, subdivision (b), this language: \"The\n\ndescription [in required reports on the proposed specific amendment/project] shall\n\ncontain specific, quantifiable evidence that documents both of the following: (1) The\n\nphysical and economic conditions specified in Section 33031. (2) That the described\n\nphysical and economic conditions are so prevalent and substantial that, collectively, they\n\nseriously harm the entire project area.\" (Italics added; Stats. 2006, ch. 595, § 7(b),\n\np. 3780.)\n\n       In its statement of decision, the court exhaustively analyzed the types of blighting\n\nphysical conditions set forth in the RTC and administrative record, under section 33031,\n\nsubdivision (a)(1): \"Buildings in which it is unsafe or unhealthy for persons to live or\n\nwork,\" and subdivision (a)(2) \"[c]onditions that prevent or substantially hinder the viable\n\nuse or capacity of buildings or lots.\" The missing RSG/City field surveys were not in the\n\nadministrative record, and the court criticized the City's overall showing on physical\n\nblight, such as duplicative photographic evidence that did not show the claimed serious\n\ndilapidation and deterioration of buildings, and that did not show the required nexus\n\nbetween the deterioration conditions and evidence showing that they rendered those\n\nbuildings unsafe or unhealthy. Consequently, those blight findings were not supported by\n\n\"tangible proof.\" (Glendora, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 836.) Indeed, the court found\n\n                                             34\n\fthe supporting \"evidence\" in the RTC for the City's claims of structural obsolescence to\n\nbe mainly jargon and conclusory statements, which failed to satisfy statutory\n\nrequirements. (Riverside, supra, 65 Cal.App.4th at p. 627.) The City does not\n\nadequately respond to those findings, mainly arguing instead that the Brownfields Studies\n\nshould have been admitted (as next discussed).\n\n       In Blue, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at pages 1142 through 1143, the court discussed\n\npre-2006 CRL statutes and interpreted them as not expressly requiring raw data, such as\n\nfield surveys, to be provided to the public before an amendment hearing is held\n\n(§ 33457.1), nor requiring such data to be provided if referenced in the report to the\n\nlegislative body. (§ 33352.) In that case, the plaintiffs had been able to prepare adequate\n\nopposition, even without obtaining the raw data underlying the reports, and no prejudice\n\nto the substantial rights of those parties was found. (Code Civ. Proc., § 866.) Our case is\n\ndifferent, and the recent amendments to section 33352 undermine this portion of the\n\nholding of Blue because now, the Legislature has made clear that better documentation of\n\nblight conditions is required, and \"specific, quantifiable evidence\" of prevalent, serious\n\nblighting conditions harming the entire project area must now be presented to support\n\nsuch an amendment. This was not done here to meet the amended standards added to\n\nsection 33352, subdivision (b).\n\n                          3. Effect of Brownfields Studies Rulings\n\n       As previously stated, the trial court declined to admit trial exhibit No. 501 (2005\n\nBrownfields Studies), as evidence or as part of the administrative record, and it declined\n\nto take judicial notice of its contents. However, the trial court allowed the City in its\n\n                                             35\n\fclosing argument to discuss the effect of the mentions of the Brownfields Studies in the\n\nRTC, in terms of proof of economic blight conditions, and we briefly address those\n\nissues. (§ 33031, subd. (b); but see fn. 3, ante, regarding our denial of judicial notice of\n\nBrownfields Studies on appeal.)\n\n       In the briefs on appeal, the parties continue to dispute whether the Brownfields\n\nStudies were properly excluded, on either physical or economic blight issues. The City\n\ndid not show that the studies were part of the 2007 redevelopment decisional process, but\n\nargues they could have been considered, since they already existed, and it was possible\n\nthe hazardous conditions discussed in them regarding the harbor district (10 percent of\n\nthe project) were relevant.

San Jose (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2135505\"><a href=\"/opinion/2135505/franklin-mckinley-sch-dist-v-city-of-san-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

However, the trial court denied the City's request to take\n\njudicial notice of them, reasoning that the City should be judicially estopped from relying\n\non the studies, because of its previous in limine motions excluding anything from the\n\nreverse validation proceedings that was not in the administrative record. The trial court\n\nwas justified in that discretionary ruling. (See Blix St. Records Inc. v. Cassidy (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47.)\n\n       Even if the Brownfields Studies had been considered to be part of the\n\nadministrative record that supported an economic blight finding, (§ 33031, subd. (b)(2)\n\n[(hazardous wastes]), there was no still physical blight finding that was substantially\n\nsupported by quantifiable data. Also, the studies would not properly be judicially noticed\n\n                                             36\n\ffor their truth about blight issues. (Mangini v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994)\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612871\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612871/mangini-v-rj-reynolds-tobacco-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1063.) We find no error or abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision\n\nto exclude the Brownfields Studies from the administrative record, because they would\n\nnot have added materially to the City's demonstration of blight conditions.\n\n                         D.

(b) [referring to blight in\n\nthe \"project area.\"].)\n\n       We need not address this issue, because the issues previously discussed in\n\nconnection with the City's unsuccessful appeal of the reverse validation order are\n\ndispositive. There was no adequately supported condition of physical blight in the\n\nadministrative record, and for a valid Amendment, findings on both serious, significant\n\nremaining physical and economic blight, burdening the community and necessitating\n\nredevelopment, were required. (§§ 33030, subd. (b); 33333.2, subd. (a)(4).) There is no\n\nneed to resolve the additional claims in the cross-appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\f                                               III\n\n                                          PRA ISSUES\n\n                                        A. Introduction\n\n         As a separate and independent ground of the judgment, the trial court issued\n\ndeclaratory relief that the City violated PRA statutory standards, when the City did not\n\nproduce, upon request, some of the raw data that underlay the RTC conclusions and the\n\nenactment of the Amendment. The attorney fees awards against the City are based on\n\nprivate attorney general theories (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.5) and also a PRA provision\n\n(Gov. Code, § 6259, subd. (d)). There is some unavoidable overlap between these PRA\n\nissues and the CRL ruling that we have already discussed (pt. II, ante). Our review of the\n\nPRA ruling in favor of CYAC addresses the trial court's decision to issue declaratory\n\nrelief strictly as it is reflected in the terms of the judgment, not in all of its broadly stated\n\nreasoning in the statement of decision. (D'Amico, supra, 11 Cal.3d at p. 19; see fn. 8,\n\nante.)\n\n         The trial court ruled that both types of this underlying raw data constituted public\n\nrecords, (1) the property-by-property field surveys of the Amendment area (held and\n\nstored by the City's consultant, RSG, then destroyed), and (2) property-by-property crime\n\ndata for the three years prior to the PRA request (held by the City's police department's\n\ncrime analyst, and used by her to prepare the three-year chart that she sent to RSG for\n\ninclusion in the RTC; that underlying data was not found when requested). The court\n\nfound that the CYAC requests for such material, among 22 or more categories of records,\n\nover a period of two or three months, were reasonably clear, but the City had not\n\n                                               38\n\fresponded with reasonable searches and was not justified in failing to require that the\n\nknown custodians of the existing records should produce them. Injunctive relief was\n\ndenied because there was no prospective problem shown. (Gov. Code, § 6253.1.)\n\n       On appeal in these respects, the City protests that it produced numerous\n\ndocuments to CYAC and should not have been faulted for failing to additionally provide\n\nthe data its consultant discarded or the crime data, which it did not consider to be\n\nmeaningful to anyone outside its police department. Under Government Code\n\nsection 6253.1, the City has the duty to respond to requests for disclosure of the\n\ninformation in public records, including assisting the requester in formulating reasonable\n\nrequests, because of the City's superior knowledge about the contents of its records. The\n\nCity's duty requires it to communicate the scope of the information requested to the\n\ncustodians of its records, who may include private retained consultants, but the City need\n\nnot forward the exact language of a request, which may not have been accurate. (ACLU,\n\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82-83.) No exact duplication or \"parroting\" of the precise\n\nlanguage of the requests by the agency to its known custodians is required, but the agency\n\nis obligated to make reasonable efforts toward clarification and production. (Id. at pp.\n\n85-86, fn. 16.)18 We agree with the trial court's analysis of the record that the evidence\n\ndemonstrated that the City's efforts fell short of that accepted standard.\n\n\n\n18     As will be discussed, the statement of decision imposes an overly broad\ninterpretation of the PRA, holding \"that a reasonable search requires the agency to:\n(1) ask the known custodian of records for (2) the documents requested in the PRA\nrequest.\" The PRA does not require an agency to convey to the custodian or consultant\nthe identical language of the request.\n                                             39\n\f                               B.

PRA Requests and City's Responses\n\n                 1. Background of RTC; Initial Production of Documents\n\n       The RTC stated it had relied on six major sources in the analysis and assessment\n\nof different types of blight conditions remaining in the Amendment area, including as\n\nrelevant here, \"the April 2007 field survey by RSG,\" and \"Information from the [City]\n\nPolice Department.\" From May through August 2007, CYAC requested many forms of\n\ndata in its numerous PRA requests to the City, for over 20 categories of documents.\n\nUpon receiving the notice to property owners of the June 19, 2007 hearing, CYAC's\n\nofficial Casillas informally and then on May 23 formally requested documents referenced\n\nin that notice, including a copy of the City's \"blight studies\" together with the \"negative\n\ndeclaration\" report and \"CDC's most recent report.\" In response to CYAC's May 23\n\nrequest, and others later, the City disclosed more than 1,200 pages of documents.19\n\n       On June 15, 2007, CYAC sent three separate PRA requests to the City: (1) its fire\n\ndepartment (regarding hazardous materials), (2) its building and safety department\n\n(regarding building code violations), and (3) its police department (regarding crime rates\n\nand \"a property-by-property breakdown of crime in the shaded area over the last three\n\nyears\"). Each of these sought \"any data provided to [RSG]\" or to the agency, and also\n\nreferred to \"the shaded area\" of the boundary parcel map sent out with the notice.\n\n\n\n19      CYAC made other PRA requests June 7, June 15 and June 29, but they are not\ndirectly involved in this appeal and need not be discussed in detail, except to note that\nCYAC used a broadsword approach, not the narrowly targeted one that its respondent's\nbrief represents occurred here. The Interested Parties did not participate in the PRA\ndisputes. (See fn. 8, ante.)\n                                             44\n\f       On July 27, 2007, CYAC's attorneys sent a lengthy status letter to the City\n\ndiscussing a number of the requests already made to the City. Although some responsive\n\nmaterials had been produced, the raw property-by-property survey data prepared by RSG\n\nhad not been provided and were again requested, along with other documents.\n\n       In its ruling, the trial court determined that the City's response to the May 23,\n\nJune 15 and July 27 requests violated the PRA because the City did not \"diligently search\n\nfor and produce\" the requested documents, that were known to exist and that were under\n\nthe control of its employees or its consultants. For purposes of this appeal, we need not\n\nsummarize all the PRA requests or responses, but focus upon the requests that are the\n\nsubject of this appeal, that pertain to the two types of raw data that were not provided, for\n\nvarious reasons.\n\n                                      2. Field Surveys\n\n       RSG's contract with the Commission gave that agency the property rights to the\n\nmemoranda, reports, maps, etc. prepared by RSG for the project, all of which was to be\n\nturned over to the agency upon completion of the project. RSG used software to process\n\ndata and to convert field studies from raw data into the documents submitted into the\n\nrecord. The field surveys of blight conditions prepared by RSG were referred to in the\n\nRTC as part of the methodology used in creating it. RSG used the 2005 field study as a\n\nbase and added the 2007 data to it, but it could not later determine what data had been\n\nadded from the 2007 field surveys.\n\n       In the June 15 Fire Department and Building Department requests, CYAC sought\n\n\"any data provided to [RSG]\" or to the commission regarding hazardous materials in the\n\n                                             45\n\fCity, or code violations. The City and Commission staff started to locate and provide\n\nCYAC with some responsive documents. Around July 10-12, a representative of the City\n\nAttorney's office asked RSG to hold onto its backup data or field notes. On July 17,\n\n2007, the City's redevelopment manager Patricia Beard (Beard) sent an e-mail to RSG\n\nrequesting the back-up data. This was done the same day that the Amendment was\n\napproved by the City Council. However, the PRA dispute raged on.\n\n       On July 27, 2007, CYAC's status letter to the City discussed a number of the\n\nrequests it had made to the City, including those for the \"raw property-by-property survey\n\ndata that the consultant RSG used to write the 2007 [RTC].\" CYAC's attorney stated that\n\nsuch field surveys of blight conditions had not been supplied.\n\n       On August 9, 2007, Beard sent another e-mail to RSG, requesting everything in\n\nRSG's files from the 2005 and 2007 Amendments. This request was copied to Frank\n\nSpevacek, president of RSG. He testified that only general requests were made to RSG\n\nfor their files, and he did not understand this request to include any property-by-property\n\nfield surveys. Beard followed up on CYAC's request by asking her administrative\n\nassistant to call RSG's staffer Walter Lauderdale, but it is not clear whether this was\n\ndone. Nothing further was received from RSG. Their field surveys were later discarded,\n\npossibly between June or July of 2007 and May 2008.\n\n                                      3. Crime Data\n\n       In the RTC, the City referred to a \"Table B-3\" of crime statistics from 2006,\n\nshowing the City's crime rates were higher than those of surrounding communities for\n\ncertain offenses and further, a disproportionate share of the City's crime occurs within the\n\n                                             46\n\fboundaries of the Amendment area. However, the table referred to does not appear in the\n\nRTC copies in the record. It was created from a chart of three years of crime data, dated\n\nMay 8, 2007, \"Part 1 Crime Statistics\" in the target redevelopment area and City-wide, as\n\nprovided by the City's police department crime analyst (the three-year chart). The three-\n\nyear chart was admitted at trial as exhibit No. 14.\n\n       In the June 15 police department PRA request, CYAC requested four categories of\n\ninformation: \"any data provided to [RSG]\" or to the Commission in the last year\n\nregarding crime rates in the City. Next, by using the May 2007 notice copy of the\n\nboundary parcel map, it sought: \"(2) Any data on the rate of crime in the shaded area on\n\nthe map (map provided). (3) A property-by-property breakdown of crime in the shaded\n\narea over the last three years. (4) Numbers of parking and traffic violations issued in the\n\nshaded area over the last three years.\" (Italics added.)\n\n       The City's assistant city attorney responded on June 21, 2007, as follows: \"You\n\nhave requested documents from us in a manner that is vague and ambiguous as to what\n\ndocuments are inclusive to your request. For example, I am unclear as to the address of\n\nthe documents requested via a 'shaded area' in your attachment. I cannot ascertain the\n\naddresses in such shaded areas by inspection of the map you have attached. As such, I\n\nneed clarification as to the category of items 2-4 as to the exact addresses intended. . . .\n\nItem 1 also refers to crime rates. If such crime statistics have not been created by the\n\nDepartment, the City is not required by law to create them for a Public Records Request.\n\nIf they exist, you are, however, entitled to inspect them.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n\n                                              47\n\f       On June 29, 2007, CYAC answered: \"Regarding Request Number 2, that request\n\nis based on the statement in the [RTC] that the Police Department gave an estimate of the\n\ncrime rate in that area. I do not know in what form the Police Department may have\n\nprovided the information, but I would like to receive it in whatever form it was provided.\n\n[¶] Regarding Requests Numbers 3 and 4, unfortunately, I do not have the addresses. If\n\nyou are able to locate the responsive documents to Request Numbers 1 and/or 2, that\n\nwould hopefully encompass the responses to Requests 3 and 4. Also, although I do not\n\nhave the number addresses, the addresses certainly include any address on National City\n\nBoulevard, any address on Civic Center Drive, [etc.].\" (Italics added.)\n\n       On July 17, 2007, Beard e-mailed two RSG staffers, Lauderdale and Zachary\n\nMikelson, to request back-up data for the \"crime table\" information mentioned in the\n\nRTC. On July 18, 2007, Beard was told by RSG staffer Mikelson that he received the\n\nthree-year chart (crime statistics) from crime analyst Molli Knobbe (Knobbe) of the\n\npolice department. She had used raw crime statistics to create the three-year chart, and\n\nRSG received and used it to create its table of 2006 crime statistics for the project area,\n\nwhich underlay its RTC conclusions.\n\n       On July 19, 2007, the City Attorney's office requested that Knobbe provide it with\n\n\"any of the data you provided below to this company [RSG].\" Knobbe forwarded to the\n\nCity Attorney the information (the three-year chart) she had provided to RSG on May 8,\n\n2007. When asked if she had provided any other information to RSG, Knobbe replied,\n\n\"That was it.\"\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\f       On July 24, 2007, the City Attorney's office forwarded Knobbe's crime data\n\ninformation to CYAC, including the three-year chart containing crime statistics in the\n\ntarget redevelopment area and City-wide, as well as a list of properties by parcel number.\n\n       On July 27, 2007, CYAC's attorneys sent a letter to the City discussing a number\n\nof the requests made to the City, including those to the City's police department, and\n\ninformed the City that it had satisfied the June 15, 2007 requests 1 and 2 to the police\n\ndepartment (crime rates in City and shaded map area), but it had not produced anything\n\nin response to requests 3 and 4 (property-by-property breakdown of crime in the shaded\n\narea over the last three years, and parking/traffic violations).\n\n       On August 9, 22 and 27, 2007, the City supplied three more sets of documents to\n\nCYAC for inspection. On September 25, 2007, CYAC filed its lawsuit claiming in the\n\nseventh cause of action that the City had failed to provide responsive documents.\n\n                               4. Additional Trial Evidence\n\n       Regarding the field surveys, the president of RSG, Spevacek, testified they had\n\nremained in its possession for a time, but were not made part of the RTC. Accordingly,\n\nRSG started to discard them when the project closed out in July 2007, and in 2008, RSG\n\ncompleted its office cleanup by purging its paper and physical data after the information\n\nwas entered into the computer and the computer program updated. He did not recall\n\nreceiving any request for \"everything in your files.\" RSG did not believe it needed to\n\nascertain if it could provide that 2007 raw data.\n\n       At trial, Knobbe testified that the three-year chart she prepared included crime\n\nstatistics of particular offenses, not crime rates. Crime rates were prepared City-wide\n\n                                             49\n\ftwice a year. Once she sent off the three-year chart as requested, she would not normally\n\nhave sent to the City Attorney any backup data she had used to create the three-year\n\nchart, because she did not think anyone else could make sense of it. However, she still\n\nhad that backup data in her file cabinet in August 2007, and could have sent it if anyone\n\nasked for it.\n\n          D. Special Considerations: Possession and Control of Public Records\n\n       Generally, public records must be described clearly enough to permit the agency\n\nto determine whether the writings or information of the type described in the request are\n\nunder its control. (California First Amendment Coalition, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2301720\"><a href=\"/opinion/2301720/cfac-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n165-166.) \"However, the requirement of clarity must be tempered by the reality that a\n\nrequester, having no access to agency files, may be unable to precisely identify the\n\ndocuments sought. Thus, writings may be described by their content. The agency must\n\nthen determine whether it has such writings under its control and the applicability of any\n\nexemption. An agency is thus obliged to search for records based on criteria set forth in\n\nthe search request.\" (Ibid.)\n\n       \"Records requests, however, inevitably impose some burden on government\n\nagencies. An agency is obliged to comply so long as the record can be located with\n\nreasonable effort.\" (California First Amendment Coalition, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2301720\"><a href=\"/opinion/2301720/cfac-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n166.) An agency may legitimately raise an objection that a request is overbroad or\n\nunduly burdensome. (Ibid.) However, the courts need not take literally a request's\n\nlanguage to deem it clearly excessive, but instead should construe the request reasonably,\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\fin light of its clear purposes: \"Feigned confusion based on a literal interpretation of the\n\nrequest is not grounds for denial.\" (Id. at pp. 166-167.)\n\n       Certainly, there was confusion here, some genuine and perhaps some that was\n\nfeigned. The City is not claiming that the requested information was exempt from\n\ndisclosure, but instead that it could not reasonably have been expected to locate it or\n\nproduce it, either because the requests were confusing, its consultant was to blame, or the\n\ncrime data was incomprehensible. The effect of the City's inability or unwillingness to\n\nlocate the records had the same effect as withholding requested information from the\n\npublic. (ACLU, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85.) \"[I]f an agency's claim that information\n\nis beyond the scope of the request can be sustained without the detailed justification\n\nnecessary to sustain a claim that information is exempt or not segregable, agencies could\n\nuse such claims to relieve themselves of the need to provide the 'detailed justification'\n\nordinarily required to withhold information.\" (Ibid.) The focus should be on the criteria\n\nin the request and the description of the information, as reasonably construed, and the\n\nsearch should be broad enough to account for the problem that the requester may not\n\nknow what documents or information of interest an agency possesses. Without certain\n\nknowledge of the nature of the documents, the requester may be unable to provide the\n\nspecificity an agency may require. (Ibid.)\n\n       In construing a disclosure request, the policy of the PRA requires the courts to\n\nconsider the information that is being requested, not only the precise type of records that\n\nmust be provided.

The court was not required to\n\naddress any issue concerning the primary consultant's files( those issues were moot due to\n\naccess granted). With respect to the subconsultants' files, the court looked to the nature\n\nof the contractual relationship between the public entity and the subconsultants, to decide\n\nthe PRA issues of (1) whether the files of the subconsultants were \" 'in the [actual or\n\nconstructive] possession of the agency' for purposes of Government Code section 6253,\n\nsubdivision (c)\"; and (2) the nature of the agency's right, if any, to control the files and\n\nrecords of the subconsultants.

Extent of City's PRA Obligations to Communicate with Custodians\n\n       In its related federal due process findings, the trial court said the City had failed to\n\nrespond promptly to PRA requests for crime data and property survey information, and it\n\nunjustifiably claimed the survey data were not public records, and it had failed to secure\n\nthat information during litigation to prevent it from being destroyed. (See pt. IV, post.)\n\nWe next examine those factual conclusions, but in the PRA context.\n\n       Under Government Code section 6253.1, the City had the duty to assist a requester\n\nsuch as CYAC to formulate reasonable requests and to respond accordingly, by\n\ncommunicating the scope of the public information requested to the custodians of its\n\nrecords. Reasonableness goes both ways, and we disagree with CYAC that only a very\n\nfew of its requests need be evaluated: July 27 regarding field survey data, and June 15\n\nand July 27 with regard to crime data. The facts are otherwise, because the May 23\n\nrequest included \"all blight studies\" and the June 15 requests included not only crime\n\ndata, but also all materials provided to RSG regarding hazardous materials and building\n\n\n\n21      With reference to its fees motion, CYAC claims the case before us represents the\nfirst California PRA trial court ruling about a third party consultant's custody of public\nrecords, and the PRA obligation to disclose such records.\n                                              54\n\fcode violations (physical blight). Even if the precise \"field survey\" term did not appear\n\nin the requests until July 27, it had become clear after the May 23 request that CYAC was\n\nseeking information backing up the field surveys, as they had been referred to in the RTC\n\nas source material. CYAC cannot now claim that its July 27 request was the only\n\noperative one and the others were irrelevant, since the July 27 request clarified the earlier\n\nones. (See Galbiso v.

(Gov. Code,\n\n§§ 6252, subd. (e); 6253, subd. (c).) The rules of review for statutory interpretation\n\nissues apply to questions of law (independent review), but we should accept as true any\n\ntrial court findings of the \"facts of the particular case,\" if supported by substantial\n\nevidence.

Records of Consultant RSG\n\n       The court correctly concluded these were public records within the meaning of\n\nGovernment Code section 6252, subdivision (e), concerning the people's business.\n\nAlthough CYAC originally designated its requests as seeking \"blight studies,\" that was\n\nnot an unreasonable approach in light of the original language of the RTC. It was not\n\nenough for the City to respond that the RTC \"was\" the blight study. The City then\n\nappropriately took further action by contacting RSG in an attempt to obtain the\n\nunderlying data, the field surveys.\n\n       Based on the contractual language between RSG and the City's Commission, the\n\nCity had an ownership interest in the field survey material and it had the right to possess\n\nand control it, even though it did not enforce its contractual right. We agree with the trial\n\ncourt that the City did not act reasonably in protecting its contractual rights to retain this\n\nmaterial, even if its staff did not intentionally conceal the data. No bad faith finding was\n\nrequired to support the finding there was a PRA violation. (Iturralde, supra, 315 F.3d at\n\np. 315.) When the City staff requested that RSG produce all of its files, but without\n\ndefining the material actually being sought, it failed to take into account that \"field\n\nsurveys\" are a term of art in the redevelopment context. (See Blue, supra, 137\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1140-1142.) The City gave up too soon and did not press the matter\n\nsufficiently, to a reasonable extent, at a time when most of the field surveys, which it\n\nowned, still existed.\n\n       We are mindful of the press of business of public agencies, particularly in these\n\ndifficult fiscal times, and do not hold the City to an impossible standard, merely a\n\n                                              56\n\freasonable one. The City is not justified in arguing that it did everything it could or\n\nshould have to do, nor that all the fault lay with its contractor RSG. Moreover, since\n\n2008 (after the requests in this case were made), Government Code section 6253.3 has\n\nprovided that a public agency \"may not allow another party to control the disclosure of\n\ninformation that is otherwise subject to disclosure pursuant to this chapter,\" showing the\n\ntrend in the law is toward promoting such disclosure. (See fn. 21, ante.)\n\n       Notwithstanding the above, the trial court's reasoning or implied ruling that the\n\nCity had the statutory obligation to forward the PRA request it received, verbatim, to its\n\nconsultant as a custodian of public records, is not justifiable as an interpretation of this\n\nstatutory scheme. Instead, the City had the obligation to interpret the request as received,\n\nas made by a member of the public that was presumably not familiar with the underlying\n\ndata, and then to make reasonable efforts to facilitate the location and release of the\n\ninformation. The trial court's declaratory relief that there had been violations of the PRA\n\nwas justified, but we decline to issue a rule that PRA requests must be passed on exactly\n\nas received to the custodians of public records, even those who are private consultants.\n\n                          2. Records of City's Police Department\n\n       The record shows that the property-by-property crime reports, requested by CYAC\n\nas of June 15, were existing crime data located at the City's police department's crime\n\nanalyst's office, that were supplied to the City's consultant RSG on May 8, 2007 as\n\ntransformed into the three-year chart. However, the RSG-created crime table was\n\napparently omitted from the RTC, and the backup crime data was not transferred to the\n\nCity attorney's office upon request, since the individual crime analyst did not understand\n\n                                              57\n\fthe request to include it. Since the RTC had stated that police records were among the\n\nsource material relied upon, CYAC had a legitimate basis to request that information.\n\n       In response, the City Attorney's office first claimed that it was unclear about what\n\nmap was being used to identify the information sought, even though only one map had\n\nyet been made available (the boundary parcel map; this may have been a stalling tactic).\n\nIn any case, the City's attorneys eventually sought clarification of the requests, and\n\nreceived the June 29, 2007 response by CYAC that a response to requests 1 and 2 would\n\nprobably suffice as a response to requests 3 and 4. Next, CYAC's July 27, 2007 letter\n\nstating the City had satisfied requests 1 and 2, but requests 3 and 4 were still outstanding.\n\n       As of that time, the City's attorneys were already in possession, or should\n\nreasonably have been in possession, of knowledge that its own crime analyst Knobbe had\n\nused the underlying crime data to create the three-year chart she sent to RSG, and which\n\nRSG used to create a table of crime as referred to in the RTC, to serve as a basis for the\n\nRTC's conclusions. When the City Attorney's office requested that Knobbe provide it\n\nwith \"any of the data you provided below to this company [RSG],\" it mistakenly accepted\n\nthe same information (three-year chart) she had already provided to RSG on May 8,\n\n2007, and also apparently accepted her interpretation that the data would not have made\n\nsense to anyone else. The City could have asked her what raw statistical information\n\nunderlay the three-year chart or the table, but it did not, and we have no adequate basis to\n\nsay the data was in fact unintelligible. (See ACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 86, fn.\n\n17 [public data should be produced if possible, even if the court wonders why anyone\n\nwould want it].)\n\n                                             58\n\f       Even without any bad faith showing, the record discloses that the City did not ask\n\nthe right questions, even though it presumably had the ability to do so. In the course of\n\nits normal PRA response procedure, the City's responding attorneys had actual or\n\nconstructive knowledge of both the information relevant to the redevelopment\n\nproceedings, and the police department's type of data, and how they could have been\n\nrelated. To comply with its existing obligations under Government Code section 6253.1,\n\nthe City staff would not have been required to create a new set of public records nor to\n\ntake other action that would have exceeded the duties imposed by the PRA. (Haynie,\n\nsupra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1072.) This is not a case in which multiple governmental\n\ndepartments and agencies are involved in an exceedingly complex fact pattern, in which\n\nan extensive search may be deemed reasonable, even where it did not produce the desired\n\nresults. In such distinguishable cases, requiring additional work over the efforts made by\n\nthe public agency would unfairly place an undue burden on it. (See Citizens Comm. on\n\nHuman Rights, supra, 45 F.3d at p. 1327.)\n\n       Even though the City was not found to be intentionally obstructionist, neither was\n\nit sufficiently proactive or diligent in making a reasonable effort to identify and locate the\n\nraw crime data. The trial court was justified in concluding the City failed to meet its\n\ndisclosure duties under the PRA. However, the trial court's ruling imposed more than a\n\nstatutory obligation on the City, by ruling or implying that the City had the obligation to\n\nforward the same PRA request language to its custodian of records, the police department\n\nstaff. Instead, the City had the obligation to interpret the request, as made by a member\n\nof the public that was not presumably as familiar with the underlying data, and to\n\n                                             59\n\ffacilitate a reasonable effort to locate and release the information. (Gov. Code,\n\n§ 6253.1.)\n\n       The declaratory relief finding that there had been violations of the PRA was\n\njustified, but we decline to endorse or establish any rule that PRA requests must be\n\npassed on verbatim to the custodians of records, whether they are public employees or\n\nprivate consultants.\n\n                                             IV\n\n                  FEDERAL PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS RULING\n\n                                 A.

In\n\na related ruling, the court concluded that \"at a minimum, a continuance of the public\n\nhearing upon request was required.\"\n\n       However, since the City had met all the basic notice requirements of section\n\n33452, and CYAC had been given notice by late April-early May of the June 19, 2007\n\nhearing on the Amendment, the court ruled that CYAC had \"sufficient time to undertake\n\nits own investigation to present evidence to the City Council.\"22 Thus, the court\n\ndeclined to issue a broader procedural due process ruling that would have imposed any\n\nadditional specific time requirements on the City to make the RTC available to the\n\npublic, \"prior to the public hearing,\" such as by impliedly adding to the language of\n\nsection 33457.1.

Section 33390 et seq.\n\noutlines the means of acquiring real property for redevelopment purposes. Under section\n\n33398, an eminent domain statute (Code of Civ.

The federal government\n\nsubsequently declared a forfeiture, seizing his house and land without prior notice or an\n\nadversary proceeding, on the ground that the property had been used to commit or\n\nfacilitate federal drug offenses. (21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(7).) The high court accepted Good's\n\nassertion that this ex parte proceeding deprived him of his home and property without due\n\nprocess of law, because the purpose of a due process requirement is \" 'not only to ensure\n\nabstract fair play to the individual. Its purpose, more particularly, is to protect his use\n\nand possession of property from arbitrary encroachment--to minimize substantively\n\n\n\n                                              71\n\funfair or mistaken deprivations of property. . . .'

That\n\nrelief was comprehensive in nature and sufficiently vindicated the actual, existing\n\ninterests that CYAC, as well as other interested parties, had at stake in successfully\n\nresisting the blight designation.\n\n       A \"state law requirement that a public entity conduct hearings in a fair manner\n\ndoes not automatically implicate the federal due process clause.\" (Clark, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

At trial, the court heard expert opinion\n\ntestimony about how much more time the opponents of the Amendment should have been\n\ngiven to fight this redevelopment blight designation. The court's ruling acknowledged\n\nthat CYAC had nevertheless been given adequate notice of the public hearing and had\n\nhad an opportunity to prepare opposition.\n\n       The trial court correctly declined to issue any ruling adding to the statutory\n\nrequirements of section 33457.1, that the RTC and related information of blight\n\nconditions must be given \"prior to the hearing.\" The Legislature did not designate any\n\ntime frame for how far in advance that disclosure should be made, and it was not required\n\nto do so; we leave such policy decisions to the Legislature. (Glendora, supra, 185\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 831.)\n\n       Further, we need not weigh in upon whether the City should have granted a\n\ncontinuance of the public hearing for purposes of allowing further opposition to be filed.\n\nThe City took six volumes and more of posthearing written opposition, as shown in the\n\nadministrative record.

In any case, and especially since the reverse\n\nvalidation order was properly granted, this record does not show there was a serious risk\n\nof erroneous deprivation of rights of property owners within the Amendment area, that\n\nwould have justified imposing additional federal procedural due process protections or\n\nsanctions.\n\n       In view of the recent abolition of redevelopment agencies, and for all of the above\n\nreasons, it would serve no purpose for this court to additionally examine the portions of\n\nthe Mathews test that address the \"probable value, if any, of additional or substitute\n\nprocedural safeguards\" and the \"fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or\n\nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail.\" (Mathews, supra, 424 U.S. at p. 335.)\n\n       We conclude that CYAC's asserted interest in property protection against any\n\npotentially unsupported blight designation, by receiving strict CRL compliance, is not a\n\nprotectable property interest for procedural due process purposes.

(42 U.S.C. § 1988; Gov.\n\nCode, § 6259; Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.5.)

Particularly as\n\nto the relief granted to CYAC on the federal due process claim, our reversal of that part\n\nof the judgment removes in large part the legal basis for the attorney fees award against\n\nthe City, insofar as it was based on Title 42 United States Code section 1988.

We address whether the court correctly concluded that fees on CYAC's\n\nPRA claim were specifically authorized by the PRA statute.\n\n\n\n                                             78\n\f       Having given guidance to the trial court in those respects, we shall reverse the\n\norders awarding attorney fees and return those remaining issues to the trial court for its\n\nexercise of discretion in evaluating the factors set out in Code of Civil Procedure section\n\n1021.5 (and the PRA, as to CYAC only).

Discretionary Relief From \"Untimely\" Filing\n\n       To assess the soundness of the relief allowed from late filing of the fees motions,\n\nwe outline the terms of rule 3.1702(a). It states, \"Except as otherwise provided by\n\nstatute, this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney's fees and claims for\n\nattorney's fees provided for in a contract. Subdivisions (b) and (c) of rule 3.1702 apply\n\nwhen the court determines entitlement to the fees, the amount of the fees, or both,\n\nwhether the court makes that determination because the statute or contract refers to\n\n'reasonable' fees, because it requires a determination of the prevailing party, or for other\n\nreasons.\" (Italics added.) Turning to rule 3.1702(b)(1), \"A notice of motion to claim\n\nattorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial\n\ncourt--including attorney's fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment in the trial\n\ncourt--must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules\n\n8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil case . . . .\" (Italics added.) At the outset, it seems\n\nrule 8.104(a)(1)(B) would therefore apply, stating \"Unless a statute or rule 8.108 provides\n\notherwise, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of: [¶] (B) 60 days\n\nafter the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document\n\n                                              79\n\fentitled 'Notice of Entry' of judgment or a file-stamped copy of the judgment,\n\naccompanied by proof of service . . . .\" (Italics added; rule 8.108(a) [would allow an\n\nextension of time only in certain cases not present here, e.g., motion for new trial, etc.].)\n\n       The text of rule 3.1702(d) clearly allows for \"Extensions[:] For good cause, the\n\ntrial judge may extend the time for filing a motion for attorney's fees in the absence of a\n\nstipulation or for a longer period than allowed by stipulation.\"\n\n       As relevant here, major confusion arose from the parallel terms of Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 870, subdivision (b), the Validation Act appeals deadline:\n\n\"(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law including . . . any rule of court, no\n\nappeal shall be allowed from any judgment entered pursuant to this chapter unless a\n\nnotice of appeal is filed within 30 days after the notice of entry of the judgment, or, within\n\n30 days after the entry of the judgment if there is no answering party.\" (Italics added; see\n\nPlanning and Conservation League v.

That\n\npredecessor rule incorporated other stated time periods for filing a notice of appeal and a\n\nfees motion, as shown in Administrative Office of the Courts memoranda. From this\n\nhistory, the appellate court concluded, \"It is therefore clear that . . . rule 870.2 provides\n\ntime limits for motions for attorney fees in all civil cases, and its 60-day time limit\n\ncommences to run at notice of entry of judgment or dismissal.\" (Sanabria, supra, at p.\n\n429.)\n\n        From its rulemaking history materials, of which judicial notice has been taken, the\n\nCity now argues the trial court should not have heard the fees motion of either CYAC or\n\nthe Interested Parties, because they were not filed according to the 30-day deadline of\n\nCode of Civil Procedure section 870, but were filed within 60 days, under the alternative\n\nrule provisions. The City claims that there was no excusable neglect, because the portion\n\nof rule 3.1702(a) referring to \"except as otherwise provided by statute\" should have been\n\neasily interpreted to apply the 30-day deadline of Code of Civil Procedure section 870.\n\n\n\n                                              81\n\f       In its October 2011 opposition to the motion for section 473 relief, the City further\n\nargued it would be prejudiced if such relief were granted, due to its imminent financial\n\nobligations under the recent legislation dissolving all redevelopment agencies and\n\nrequiring the successor agencies to wind down their operations. The City referred to\n\nthen-pending litigation about the legislation, which might affect the City's liability for a\n\nfee award as a judgment.\n\n       In granting relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 and rule 3.1702(d),\n\nthe trial court correctly stated it was empowered to relieve a party from the failure to\n\nmeet a procedural time limit, upon a proper showing, and that the applications were\n\ntimely and accompanied by the proposed pleading. The court ruled that CYAC's counsel,\n\nand by joinder, counsel for the Interested Parties, had shown there was a reasonable and\n\nhonest mistake of law in the late filing, so that the fees applications should be heard on\n\ntheir merits. We agree that this was a proper resolution of these inconsistent rules and\n\nprovisions, and there was no inexcusable neglect by counsel in interpreting them.\n\n       To reach this conclusion, we need not answer the precise question posed by the\n\nappeal and the cross-appeal, of whether the 30- or 60-day deadline properly applies, but\n\ninstead, we rule only that the court was justified in granting relief under Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 473 and rule 3.1702(d), and therefore the fees motions were properly\n\nheard on their merits. We next turn to the legal foundations of the awards themselves.\n\n\n\n\n                                             82\n\f                 B.

Even if that\n\nelement is met, the trial court must also decide the remaining issues about any resulting\n\nenforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, or any significant benefit\n\nconferred in that respect. (Ibid.) If those tests are met, the trial court \"may legitimately\n\nrestrict the award to only that portion of the attorneys' efforts that furthered the litigation\n\nof issues of public importance.\" (Whitley, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 1226.)30\n\n       In this case, we cannot determine what proportion of the existing attorney fee\n\nawards were attributable to the federal due process theories. As CYAC already\n\nrecognized, by deleting its fee requests regarding its unsuccessful state constitutional\n\nclaims, no award on them would be proper. Although all the basic issues were closely\n\nintertwined at trial, the specific statutory claims under the CRL (and as to CYAC, the\n\nlimited PRA issues) were dispositive. The trial court's substantive ruling on the\n\nprocedural due process claims went too far, and accordingly, neither of its attorney fee\n\nawards was fully supported by the applicable legal principles. On remand, \"further\n\n\n\n30      The City's judicial notice request, as granted, included two sets of 2012 bill history\nand veto messages for two pieces of legislation that the Governor vetoed, that would have\nrestored some of the redevelopment powers that were taken away from municipalities in\n2011. The City argues this material shows there was no significant public interest in the\nsubject matter of this lawsuit and no support for any awards of private attorney general\nfees. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.5.) We need not decide that issue and return the entire set\nof attorney fee entitlement issues to the trial court.\n                                              87\n\fconsideration and amplification of reasoning\" will be required to determine the extent to\n\nwhich fees awards are proper regarding the remaining statutory theories, the CRL as to\n\nboth prevailing parties, and the PRA as to CYAC only.
