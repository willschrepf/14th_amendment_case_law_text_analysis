The district court1 concluded that enforcement of the air show rules, which\nis carried out by city police on behalf of Salute, violated the First Amendment. It\nissued a permanent injunction against the city and Salute requiring them to permit\ncertain expressive activities at the annual event. The city does not appeal but Salute\ndoes, arguing that it is not liable as a state actor for its speech restrictions and that the\ninjunction violates its own First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech.\nWe affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n        Since 1993 Salute has staged its annual Memorial Day Weekend Salute to\nVeterans Air Show at the Columbia Regional Airport. Although the airport is owned\nby the city, the city gives Salute control over the tarmac for the show. The two day\nevent is free and open to the public, and tens of thousands of people attend each year.\nIn addition to feats of aerial acrobatics performed by military planes, the event\nfeatures static airplane displays, exhibits by military recruiters, and food on the\nairport's secured tarmac. During the noontime hour each day there is a ceremony to\nhonor fallen veterans at which the national anthem is played, the names of fallen\nBoone County service members are read aloud, and the air show's honored guests are\nintroduced to the crowd. The stated purpose of the air show is \"to honor and\nremember\" service members, past and present.\n\n      A resolution passed by the Columbia city council authorizes the city manager\nto execute a contract with Salute for exclusive control of the airport during the event,\nsubject to the city's right to retake control in the event of an emergency.2 Salute does\n\n\n       1\n      The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri.\n       2\n       The city's resolution and its contract with Salute have remained substantially\nthe same for the past several years.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fnot pay for this use. During the remainder of the year the airport is controlled by the\ncity, and the tarmac is not open to general public access. At the time the city began\nleasing the airport to Salute for its annual event, the Columbia city code provided that\nthe city could \"make no lease or contract with any person...that will impair the City's\ncontrol of [the] airport and its facilities.\" That ordinance was repealed in 2005 after\ncommencement of this litigation.\n\n       Salute is responsible for deciding on the content of the air show, including the\nschedule of events, the list of honored guests, and the exhibits that will be displayed.\nSalute pays for liability insurance, the sound system, and the fees and incidental costs\nassociated with the use of the military air craft. City personnel are responsible for\noperating the airport during Salute's air show, and Salute's president Mary Posner\nconceded that airport manager Bill Boston, a city employee, is \"absolutely essential\"\nto the event's success. In the past few years, he has borne primary responsibility for\ndeveloping the Ground Operations Plan for the air show and has coordinated with the\nFederal Aviation Administration to facilitate the air show's compliance with federal\nregulations. Numerous city officials participate in briefings in preparation for the air\nshow. While Salute receives a variety of services from the city at no charge, as\nauthorized by the city council, it does not receive direct payment of public funds.\n\n        Salute must apply to the Department of Defense (DOD) to secure the\ninvolvement of the federal military aircraft that are displayed at the air show. On its\napplication Salute attests each year that the event is \"officially supported by local\ngovernment,\" one of the requirements for access to the planes. It also states that the\nevent will be open to the public, another DOD condition for use of its planes. City\nManager Raymond Beck signs the application forms on behalf of the city. In 2005 the\ncity listed the air show on its website under sections entitled \"Guide to City Services\"\nand \"Public Works Provided for Residents and Businesses.\" Salute includes a\ndisclaimer in its media releases, stating that the air show is presented solely by Salute\nand should not be referred to as the Columbia Air Show or \"any other designation that\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwould imply it is hosted, organized, or in any way sponsored by the City of\nColumbia.\" The city's contract with Salute also states: \"In no event shall the City and\nthe Corporation be deemed or construed to be joint venturers or partners.\"\n\n       Salute imposes a number of restrictions on behavior at the air show, including\nlimits on expressive activities. Although the list of prohibited conduct differs slightly\nfrom time to time in its precise wording, it has included prohibitions against soliciting,\npetitioning, leafleting, political campaigning, and \"unauthorized\" signs. These rules\nare widely publicized and often appear on Salute's media releases about the air show.\nSalute's restrictions apply within the fenced tarmac area which is accessed through\nseveral gates.\n\n       Columbia police officers provide security at the air show, and it is coordinated\nby Captain Michael Martin. Salute provides no reimbursement to the city for the\nofficers' time. Captain Martin has developed a security plan for the event each year\nwhich incorporates Salute's restrictions on expressive activity. Posner testified in her\ndeposition that she had no personal role in developing the security plan, but that\nSalute gave directions to the police department about which activities were to be\nprohibited. The 2003 version of Martin's security plan stated that \"[n]o protests are\npermitted inside the tarmac fence.\"3 An interoffice memorandum was also circulated\nin 2004 to instruct police officers about their role in enforcing Salute's speech\nrestrictions. It included the following:\n\n      Protesters are likely at the show. . . .Should protesters attempt to enter\n      the premises, officers will immediately advise the Command Center and\n      will stop their forward progress. Officers will advise them of the area\n      being private property and of the restrictions related to carrying signs,\n\n\n      3\n       Captain Martin stated in his deposition that the plan had been approximately\nthe same from year to year until the 2005 air show, during which Salute and the city\nwere required by the preliminary injunction to permit leafleting.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f      seeking signatures to petitions, or demonstrating. Any person who\n      persists in entering will be given a trespass warning prior to arrest. Keep\n      in mind that persons are not restricted from entering, only those who\n      intend to conduct a protest once entry is made.\n\nPolice officers are instructed to have their police identification badges visible at all\ntimes during the event.\n\n       Captain Martin stated in his deposition that the air show was the only event for\nwhich he could recall being asked to enforce a private organization's speech\nrestrictions. He stated that Salute's president Mary Posner was the final arbiter of\nwhat constituted unwanted protest at the event. He testified further that if she were\never to ask him to remove someone on account of that person's race, he would readily\ncomply.\n\n       In 2004 appellee Maureen Doyle attempted to distribute antiwar fliers inside the\nsecured tarmac. A Columbia police officer confronted her and stated that she would\nbe arrested if she continued to hand out leaflets. Soon more officers arrived, and one\ngrabbed leaflets out of her hands. Doyle then left the air show. At that same air show,\nappellee Bill Wickersham attempted to collect signatures inside the fenced tarmac area\non an initiative advocating renewable energy. He was approached by a police officer\nand advised to cease petitioning. When he refused, the police officer took him to the\ndepartment's command post at the air show and issued him a trespass warning. After\nPosner directed that he be arrested for first degree trespassing, the police arrested him\nat the show but he was never prosecuted.\n\n       Wickersham and Doyle brought this action against Salute and the City of\nColumbia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking injunctive relief permitting them to\ndistribute leaflets, circulate petitions, and engage in other expressive activities at\nfuture air shows. They alleged violations of their First Amendment rights to free\nexpression, characterizing the air show as a public forum. They argued that although\n\n                                          -5-\n\fSalute was a private corporation, it was a state actor in its imposition of restrictions\non free speech given the degree of joint participation between Salute and the city in\nstaging the air show and enforcing the restrictions. They also claimed that by granting\nSalute complete discretion to determine who was arrested at the air show, the city had\nceded a public function to Salute.\n\n       During discovery plaintiffs produced evidence about the joint activity of Salute\nand the city in staging the air show. Among the depositions they took were those of\nMary Posner of Salute and Captain Martin. Captain Martin testified that the police\ndepartment was responsible for enforcing Salute's speech restrictions as part of the\ncity's agreement to lease Salute the property, and Posner testified that the police\ndischarged this enforcement responsibility \"on [Salute's] behalf.\"\n\n       On May 18, 2005 the district court granted a temporary injunction permitting\nplaintiffs to distribute leaflets and wear expressive clothing at the 2005 air show, but\nnot allowing them to circulate petitions or engage in other forms of solicitation. It\nfound that Salute was a state actor because of the degree to which the city and Salute\nwere intertwined in the staging of the air show. The court also found that the city had\ndelegated a public function to Salute by giving Posner control over the police during\nthe air show. Subsequent to the court's order and prior to the 2005 air show, Salute\nwrote to the police department disavowing any delegation of police authority and\nstating that Salute \"will play no role in the exercise of authority and discretion by the\nCity Police . . . .\"\n\n      At the 2005 air show, leafleting and expressive clothing were permitted as\nrequired by the temporary injunction; sign carrying was also allowed even though it\nhad not been specifically addressed in the order. At a subsequent deposition, Captain\nMartin testified that no one had tried to circulate petitions at the 2005 event but that\nhe would have stopped anyone who did, not because such activity violated a city\nordinance, but because Salute disapproved it and it was not protected by the temporary\n\n                                          -6-\n\finjunction. A handful of individuals were present inside the secured tarmac at the\n2005 event to hand out leaflets or carry signs. Martin observed no disturbances\ncaused by their presence at the air show. Several members of the public did submit\nwritten complaints to Salute about the presence of \"protestors\" on the tarmac. One\nindividual handed out commercial leaflets advertising a nearby restaurant, and Posner\nlater testified that she was concerned that there would be more commercial leafleting\nat future shows.\n\n       On March 3, 2006, after additional depositions and hearings had occurred and\nevidence about the 2005 air show had been produced, the district court issued a\npermanent injunction. The injunction incorporated its earlier May 18, 2005 order by\nreference. As a predicate to its First Amendment analysis, the district court once again\nfound Salute to be a state actor when it enforced its speech restrictions against\nplaintiffs, because it was entangled with the city in planning the air show and\nmonitoring unwanted expressive activities. It also held the city accountable for the\ndirect role of the police in enforcing the speech restrictions.\n\n        The court concluded that the air show was a non public forum in which Salute\nas a state actor could impose reasonable and neutral regulations without offending the\nFirst Amendment, but that a blanket prohibition on leafleting and sign carrying was\nneither reasonable nor viewpoint neutral. It found that Salute's prohibition on\npetitioning was permissible, however, because it was both reasonable and uniformly\nenforced. The district court ordered Salute and the city to permit leafleting, sign\ncarrying, and the wearing of expressive clothing at future air shows subject to\nreasonable restrictions on time, place, and manner. The court also gave special\nconsideration to Salute's noontime ceremony at the show, ordering that Salute could\nrestrict expressive activities at that daily event and the city could lawfully remove\nindividuals who did not respect those restrictions. The court rejected Salute's\nargument that it had a First Amendment right to exclude all unwanted forms of\nexpression at its air show, questioning whether a state actor like Salute had First\n\n                                          -7-\n\fAmendment rights. Even if it did, the court reasoned, the presence of other messages\non the tarmac would not interfere with such rights.\n\n       Salute appeals from the final judgment, contesting the district court's conclusion\nthat it was a state actor and arguing that the injunction violates its own First\nAmendment rights by forcing it to provide a forum for messages it does not support.\n Although the City of Columbia is also subject to the court's injunction, it has not\nappealed.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      Generally a district court's conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and its\nfindings of fact, for clear error. See Doe v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist., 306\nF.3d 616, 621 (8th Cir. 2002) (en banc). Where the First Amendment is implicated,\nhowever, we make an \"independent examination of the whole record\" in assessing the\nfactual predicates of the free speech claim. Id. (quoting New York Times Co. v.\nSullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 285 (1964)). We nevertheless continue to apply a clear error\nstandard to facts not directly related to the First Amendment issue, see Doe, 306 F.3d\nat 621, including the factual predicates to the state action inquiry. See Howerton v.\nGabica, 708 F.2d 380, 384 (9th Cir. 1983).\n\n      The first Amendment guarantee of free speech guards against abridgment\nthrough state action alone. It does not inhibit private restrictions on speech. Hudgens\nv. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507, 513 (1976). In certain circumstances the government may\nbecome so entangled in private conduct that \"the deed of an ostensibly private\norganization or individual is to be treated . . . as if a State had caused it to be\nperformed.\" Brentwood Acad. v. Tenn. Secondary Sch. Ath. Ass'n, 531 U.S. 288, 295\n(2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f       To ascertain whether there is state action in a case, we examine the record to\ndetermine \"whether the conduct at issue is 'fairly attributable' to the state.\" Montano\nv. Hedgepeth, 120 F.3d 844, 848-849 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lugar v. Edmondson\nOil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982)). We are guided in this inquiry by two additional\nqueries: whether the claimed deprivation \"resulted from the exercise of a right or\nprivilege having its source in state authority\" and whether the party engaging in the\ndeprivation \"may be appropriately characterized as [a] state actor[].\" See Lugar, 547\nU.S. at 939 (internal quotations omitted). Since Salute's authority to impose speech\nrestrictions at its air show derives from the city's grant to it of temporary control over\nthe airport, Lugar's first prerequisite for state action is met. See United Auto Workers\nv. Gaston Festivals, Inc., 43 F.3d 902, 906 n.1 (4th Cir. 1995) (grant of permit to hold\nfestival satisfies first Lugar inquiry). The key issue is whether Salute may\nappropriately be considered a state actor in the circumstances presented. If a party's\nconduct meets the requirements for state action, the same acts also qualify as actions\ntaken \"under color of state law\" for purposes of § 1983. Lugar, 457 U.S. at 935.\n       The Supreme Court has recognized a number of circumstances in which a\nprivate party may be characterized as a state actor, such as where the state has\ndelegated to a private party a power \"traditionally exclusively reserved to the State,\"\nsee Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 352 (1974), where a private actor is\na \"willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents,\" see Adickes v. S.\nH. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 151 (1970), and where there is \"pervasive\nentwinement\" between the private entity and the state, see Brentwood, 531 U.S. at\n291. These particular circumstances are merely examples and not intended to be\nexclusive. See id. at 295.\n\n      Our ultimate conclusion must turn on the particular facts of the case, since\n\"[o]nly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement\nof the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.\" Burton v.\nWilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 722 (1961). The one unyielding\nrequirement is that there be a \"close nexus\" not merely between the state and the\n\n                                           -9-\n\fprivate party, but between the state and the alleged deprivation itself. See Brentwood,\n531 U.S. at 295. No such nexus exists where a private party acts with the mere\napproval or acquiescence of the state, see Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004-05\n(1982), but a private entity may be considered a state actor if it \"has acted together\nwith or has obtained significant aid from state officials\" in furtherance of the\nchallenged action. Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937.\n\n        Salute argues that this case is governed by our decision in Reinhart v. City of\nBrookings, 84 F.3d 1071 (8th Cir. 1996). In Reinhart, we held that the actions of a\nprivate organization in restricting political campaigning at its arts festival could not\nbe attributed to the city, even though the festival took place in a public park. The fact\nthat a city allows a private entity to hold a major event on its property is not sufficient\nto convert the private conduct of event organizers into state action even where the\norganizers impose their own rules on expressive conduct, for the state's \"mere\nacquiescence\" in an alleged deprivation is not enough. Id. at 1073. The degree of\nentanglement between the City of Columbia and Salute goes well beyond the\nrelationship in Reinhart. There, the city had no role in planning, advertising, or\nmanaging the festival, and the organizers were solely responsible for enforcing the\nrestrictions on expressive activity. Id. at 1072-73.\n\n       Here, the city's role was far more than \"mere acquiescence,\" for the city not\nonly provided critical assistance in planning and operating the show, but also played\nan active role in enforcing the particular speech restrictions challenged in this action.\nCity police, not Salute volunteers, enforce the restrictions every year, a role that\nCaptain Martin characterized as part of \"the agreement that's in place\" with Salute.\nThe active and prearranged role of the police in effectuating the event's private speech\npolicies also sets this case apart from Lansing v. City of Memphis, 202 F.3d 821 (6th\nCir. 2000), another case relied on by Salute. In Lansing, the court specifically noted\nthat the City of Memphis had made no attempt to instruct its officers on how to police\nunwanted speech activities on festival grounds. Id. at 833-34.\n\n                                           -10-\n\f      The direct role of the Columbia police in enforcing Salute's speech restrictions\nprovided the critical nexus, absent in other cases, between the challenged conduct and\nthe exercise of state authority.4 See, e.g., Gaston, 43 F.3d at 909 n.4 (appellant\nconceded absence of nexus); see also D'Amario v. Providence Civic Ctr. Auth., 783\nF.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1986) (city officials' enforcement of private speech restriction\nprovides requisite nexus between alleged deprivation and state involvement).\n\n       Salute contends that its contract with the city transformed the airport into its\nown temporary private property,5 over which it had the right to decide who was\nwelcome and who was not and thereafter to seek police assistance in ejecting\ntrespassers. To be sure, the mere invocation of state legal procedures, including police\nassistance, does not convert a private party into a state actor. See Youngblood v.\nHy-Vee Food Stores, Inc., 266 F.3d 851, 855 (8th Cir. 2001) (invoking state\nassistance to apprehend shoplifter).\n\n       The contributions of the Columbia police go beyond the kind of neutral\nassistance that would normally be offered to private citizens in enforcing the law of\ntrespass. In Griffin v. Maryland, the Supreme Court distinguished between a deputy\nsheriff's enforcement of trespass law and his active enforcement of a private park's\nsegregation policy, holding that the latter situation amounted to state action. 378 U.S.\n130, 136-37 (1964). Here, the police department's security plan instructed the officers\nto enforce Salute's rules rather city ordinances, and police took an active role in\nidentifying and intercepting protesters at the air show, including Wickersham and\nDoyle. The city's cooperation with Salute was directed toward effectuating the\nchallenged policy rather than merely keeping the peace. See Howerton v. Gabica, 708\n\n\n\n      4\n       Municipalities are state actors for the purpose of § 1983 claims. Monell v.\nDep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978).\n      5\n       The city's own ordinance prohibited it from ceding control of the airport to\nSalute or any other party until 2005 when the relevant ordinance was repealed.\n                                       -11-\n\fF.2d 380, 385 (9th Cir. 1983) (active and repeated police involvement amounts to\nstate action even though response to citizen's complaint does not).\n\n       When a private entity has acted jointly and intentionally with the police\npursuant to a \"customary plan,\" it is proper to hold that entity accountable for the\nactions which it helped bring about. See Murray v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 874 F.2d 555,\n558-559 (8th Cir. 1989); see also Dossett v. First State Bank, 399 F.3d 940, 950 (8th\nCir. 2005) (applying joint action test for state action to § 1983 action alleging First\nAmendment violation). In making its findings the district court specifically rejected\nthe suggestion that Salute had asked for nothing more from the city than the use of its\nproperty. The record supports the trial court's findings, for it contains evidence of a\nmutual understanding that city police would work to restrict speech activities at the\nair show according to Salute's wishes.\n\n       Although certain changes occurred between the entry of the temporary and\npermanent injunctions, including Posner's statement to the police disclaiming\nauthority to direct their actions at the air show, the overall \"momentum\" of the\ncooperation remained unaltered. See Brentwood, 531 U.S. at 301 (quoting Evans v.\nNewton, 382 U.S. 296, 301 (1966)). In its order granting the permanent injunction the\ndistrict court again found that Salute and the city had acted \"like partners\" with respect\nto the 2005 air show and that their mutual understanding about the city's role in\nenforcing the speech restrictions continued as before.6 In light of the evidence\nshowing a continuing history of cooperation and Captain Martin's admission that he\nwould have enforced Salute's rules at the 2005 air show even where city ordinances\nhad not been violated, we cannot characterize these findings as clearly erroneous.\nEven if the police no longer received directions from Salute at the air show or\nconsulted Salute members about whom to arrest, they nevertheless continued to\n\n\n      6\n       The district court specifically found that \"the City knows, when it enters into\nthe temporary lease of the tarmac, that the Corporation will exclude all unauthorized\nspeech and will seek the assistance of the City to enforce those rules.\"\n                                         -12-\n\frespond to the broader directives of Salute by enforcing its speech restrictions as part\nof their security duties. Cf. Brentwood, 531 U.S. at 301 n.4 (\"underlying reality\" of\nprivate entity's relationship to the state often trumps legal formalities erected in\nattempt to thwart a finding of state action).\n\n      Since Salute and the city were knowingly and pervasively entangled in the\nenforcement of the challenged speech restrictions, we conclude that Salute was a state\nactor when it interfered with appellees' expressive activities. The district court did\ntherefore not err in holding that Salute's curtailment of appellees' freedom of\nexpression constituted state action and was actionable under § 1983.\n\n       Salute next argues that the district court's order requiring it to permit leafleting,\nsign carrying, and expressive clothing at the air show interferes with its own First\nAmendment right to control the expressive content of its event, relying on Hurley v.\nIrish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group, 515 U.S. 557 (1995). In Hurley, a\nstate court had ordered a private association to include a group of gays, lesbians, and\nbisexuals as a marching unit in its St. Patrick's Day Parade in compliance with a state\npublic accommodation law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation. Id. at 562-63. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that application of\nthe state law violated the parade organizer's First Amendment rights since the state\ncannot compel a private entity to disseminate particular views or to alter its message\nto suit the government. Id. at 573. Salute cites Hurley as authority for its argument\nthat the order compelling it to permit other messages at its air show violates its First\nAmendment rights.\n\n       Appellees respond that as a state actor Salute cannot assert rights under the First\nAmendment, echoing the district court's suggestion that state actors do not enjoy the\nsame constitutional rights guaranteed to private entities like the parade organizer in\nHurley. Neither appellees nor the district court cited authority for this proposition.\nAppellees also argue that even if Salute had the full panoply of First Amendment\nrights, the district court's injunction would not violate those rights because Salute is\n                                          -13-\n\fnot being compelled to affirm any message with which it disagrees; rather it is being\nrequired to tolerate the presence of other messages from which it may easily dissociate\nitself.\n\n       Unlike Salute the parade organizer in Hurley was not a state actor, see id. at\n566, and there was no question that the organizer maintained its full rights under the\nFirst Amendment. The Supreme Court concluded that those rights were violated by\nthe presence of unwanted marching units because they would have altered the\norganizer's message which was communicated by the composition of the parade. Id.\nat 576. In contrast Salute has not shown that its message was dependent upon the\ncomposition of the crowd at the air show. The competing expressive interests were\nalso considered in Hurley. The Court pointed out that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual\ngroup could put on a parade of its own to promote its message, see id. at 578, but\nappellees here could not likely organize an event similar to the air show in order to\nadvance their views or secure the kind of privileged access to city property that Salute\nenjoys.\n\n        Whether a private entity like Salute forfeits some of its right to deliver its own\nmessage unimpeded by others when it assumes the role of state actor need not be\ndecided on this record because Salute has not shown that the injunction infringed its\nown ability to deliver its chosen message. The district court's injunction protects\nSalute's daily noontime ceremony in honor and remembrance of veterans from any\ncompeting expressive activities, giving Salute complete control over the message that\nit wants to communicate during this special event. The presence of nondisruptive\nexpressive conduct during the remainder of the air show was not shown to threaten to\nalter Salute's message. There is no evidence that Salute's message was diluted by the\npresence of a small number of sign carriers and leafleters at the 2005 air show, which\nwas attended by over 25,000 people. Appellees sought only to express their own\nviews as spectators at the air show, and their signs and leaflets were \"not likely [to]\nbe identified\" with Salute. See Pruneyard Shopping Ctr. v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 87\n(1980); see also Parks v. City of Columbus, 395 F.3d 643, 651 (6th Cir. 2005). The\n                                          -14-\n\ffact that after the 2005 air show some individuals complained to Salute about the\npresence of \"protesters\" at the event speaks to the public's ability to distinguish\nbetween Salute's message and any others permitted by the court's injunction. See\nRumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 126 S.Ct. 1297, 1310\n(2006).\n\n       Unlike the situation in Hurley, where the sponsor had been unconstitutionally\nrequired to include in its parade a particular message favored by the state, namely\nsupport for the rights of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, see 515 U.S. at 579, here there\nis \"no specific message . . . dictated by the State to be displayed,\" mitigating concerns\nthat the government is coercing affirmance of a particular favored viewpoint. See\nPruneyard, 447 U.S. at 87. If the City of Columbia has shown any preference for a\nparticular message, it has been for Salute's. The present situation involving a large air\nshow, free and open to the public, has more relevant similarities to Pruneyard, where\nthe Supreme Court held that a mall owner's First Amendment rights were not violated\nby a state constitutional requirement that he allow petitioning on his property. Id. at\n88.\n\n       On this record we cannot say that the presence of leafleters and sign carriers\ninterfered with any First Amendment rights Salute might have in the circumstances\nwhere its involvement is that of a state actor. In deciding that Salute could not\nconstitutionally prohibit all sign carrying and leafleting at its air show, the district\ncourt did not hold that Salute could impose no restrictions on those activities. Salute\nremains free to impose reasonable and viewpoint neutral rules related to time, place,\nand manner. The reasonableness of any restrictions are \"assessed in light of the\npurpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances.\" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna\nConsciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 687 (1992) (O'Connor, J., concurring)\n(quoting Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 809\n(1985)). Salute remains free to take reasonable steps to ensure that its air show\nmessage would not be submerged by any alternate forms of speech which prove to be\nunduly intrusive in their timing, place, or manner of expression.\n                                          -15-\n\f                                           III.\n\n       In sum, the speech restrictions imposed at the annual air show involved state\naction on the part of Salute because it was consistently entangled with the city in\neffectuating them, and the district court did not err or abuse its discretion in fashioning\nthe permanent injunction requiring Salute and the city to permit certain expressive\nactivities at this public event. There has been no showing that Salute's constitutional\nrights were violated by the injunction, and Salute is free to return to the district court\nif changed circumstances were to warrant modification of the injunction or any other\naction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                          ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f",

The district court1 concluded that enforcement of the air show rules, which\nis carried out by city police on behalf of Salute, violated the First Amendment. It\nissued a permanent injunction against the city and Salute requiring them to permit\ncertain expressive activities at the annual event. The city does not appeal but Salute\ndoes, arguing that it is not liable as a state actor for its speech restrictions and that the\ninjunction violates its own First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech.\nWe affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n        Since 1993 Salute has staged its annual Memorial Day Weekend Salute to\nVeterans Air Show at the Columbia Regional Airport. Although the airport is owned\nby the city, the city gives Salute control over the tarmac for the show. The two day\nevent is free and open to the public, and tens of thousands of people attend each year.\nIn addition to feats of aerial acrobatics performed by military planes, the event\nfeatures static airplane displays, exhibits by military recruiters, and food on the\nairport's secured tarmac. During the noontime hour each day there is a ceremony to\nhonor fallen veterans at which the national anthem is played, the names of fallen\nBoone County service members are read aloud, and the air show's honored guests are\nintroduced to the crowd. The stated purpose of the air show is \"to honor and\nremember\" service members, past and present.\n\n      A resolution passed by the Columbia city council authorizes the city manager\nto execute a contract with Salute for exclusive control of the airport during the event,\nsubject to the city's right to retake control in the event of an emergency.2 Salute does\n\n\n       1\n      The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri.\n       2\n       The city's resolution and its contract with Salute have remained substantially\nthe same for the past several years.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fnot pay for this use. During the remainder of the year the airport is controlled by the\ncity, and the tarmac is not open to general public access. At the time the city began\nleasing the airport to Salute for its annual event, the Columbia city code provided that\nthe city could \"make no lease or contract with any person...that will impair the City's\ncontrol of [the] airport and its facilities.\" That ordinance was repealed in 2005 after\ncommencement of this litigation.\n\n       Salute is responsible for deciding on the content of the air show, including the\nschedule of events, the list of honored guests, and the exhibits that will be displayed.\nSalute pays for liability insurance, the sound system, and the fees and incidental costs\nassociated with the use of the military air craft. City personnel are responsible for\noperating the airport during Salute's air show, and Salute's president Mary Posner\nconceded that airport manager Bill Boston, a city employee, is \"absolutely essential\"\nto the event's success. In the past few years, he has borne primary responsibility for\ndeveloping the Ground Operations Plan for the air show and has coordinated with the\nFederal Aviation Administration to facilitate the air show's compliance with federal\nregulations. Numerous city officials participate in briefings in preparation for the air\nshow. While Salute receives a variety of services from the city at no charge, as\nauthorized by the city council, it does not receive direct payment of public funds.\n\n        Salute must apply to the Department of Defense (DOD) to secure the\ninvolvement of the federal military aircraft that are displayed at the air show. On its\napplication Salute attests each year that the event is \"officially supported by local\ngovernment,\" one of the requirements for access to the planes. It also states that the\nevent will be open to the public, another DOD condition for use of its planes. City\nManager Raymond Beck signs the application forms on behalf of the city. In 2005 the\ncity listed the air show on its website under sections entitled \"Guide to City Services\"\nand \"Public Works Provided for Residents and Businesses.\" Salute includes a\ndisclaimer in its media releases, stating that the air show is presented solely by Salute\nand should not be referred to as the Columbia Air Show or \"any other designation that\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwould imply it is hosted, organized, or in any way sponsored by the City of\nColumbia.\" The city's contract with Salute also states: \"In no event shall the City and\nthe Corporation be deemed or construed to be joint venturers or partners.\"\n\n       Salute imposes a number of restrictions on behavior at the air show, including\nlimits on expressive activities. Although the list of prohibited conduct differs slightly\nfrom time to time in its precise wording, it has included prohibitions against soliciting,\npetitioning, leafleting, political campaigning, and \"unauthorized\" signs. These rules\nare widely publicized and often appear on Salute's media releases about the air show.\nSalute's restrictions apply within the fenced tarmac area which is accessed through\nseveral gates.\n\n       Columbia police officers provide security at the air show, and it is coordinated\nby Captain Michael Martin. Salute provides no reimbursement to the city for the\nofficers' time. Captain Martin has developed a security plan for the event each year\nwhich incorporates Salute's restrictions on expressive activity. Posner testified in her\ndeposition that she had no personal role in developing the security plan, but that\nSalute gave directions to the police department about which activities were to be\nprohibited. The 2003 version of Martin's security plan stated that \"[n]o protests are\npermitted inside the tarmac fence.\"3 An interoffice memorandum was also circulated\nin 2004 to instruct police officers about their role in enforcing Salute's speech\nrestrictions. It included the following:\n\n      Protesters are likely at the show. . . .Should protesters attempt to enter\n      the premises, officers will immediately advise the Command Center and\n      will stop their forward progress. Officers will advise them of the area\n      being private property and of the restrictions related to carrying signs,\n\n\n      3\n       Captain Martin stated in his deposition that the plan had been approximately\nthe same from year to year until the 2005 air show, during which Salute and the city\nwere required by the preliminary injunction to permit leafleting.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f      seeking signatures to petitions, or demonstrating. Any person who\n      persists in entering will be given a trespass warning prior to arrest. Keep\n      in mind that persons are not restricted from entering, only those who\n      intend to conduct a protest once entry is made.\n\nPolice officers are instructed to have their police identification badges visible at all\ntimes during the event.\n\n       Captain Martin stated in his deposition that the air show was the only event for\nwhich he could recall being asked to enforce a private organization's speech\nrestrictions. He stated that Salute's president Mary Posner was the final arbiter of\nwhat constituted unwanted protest at the event. He testified further that if she were\never to ask him to remove someone on account of that person's race, he would readily\ncomply.\n\n       In 2004 appellee Maureen Doyle attempted to distribute antiwar fliers inside the\nsecured tarmac. A Columbia police officer confronted her and stated that she would\nbe arrested if she continued to hand out leaflets. Soon more officers arrived, and one\ngrabbed leaflets out of her hands. Doyle then left the air show. At that same air show,\nappellee Bill Wickersham attempted to collect signatures inside the fenced tarmac area\non an initiative advocating renewable energy. He was approached by a police officer\nand advised to cease petitioning. When he refused, the police officer took him to the\ndepartment's command post at the air show and issued him a trespass warning. After\nPosner directed that he be arrested for first degree trespassing, the police arrested him\nat the show but he was never prosecuted.\n\n       Wickersham and Doyle brought this action against Salute and the City of\nColumbia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking injunctive relief permitting them to\ndistribute leaflets, circulate petitions, and engage in other expressive activities at\nfuture air shows. They alleged violations of their First Amendment rights to free\nexpression, characterizing the air show as a public forum. They argued that although\n\n                                          -5-\n\fSalute was a private corporation, it was a state actor in its imposition of restrictions\non free speech given the degree of joint participation between Salute and the city in\nstaging the air show and enforcing the restrictions. They also claimed that by granting\nSalute complete discretion to determine who was arrested at the air show, the city had\nceded a public function to Salute.\n\n       During discovery plaintiffs produced evidence about the joint activity of Salute\nand the city in staging the air show. Among the depositions they took were those of\nMary Posner of Salute and Captain Martin. Captain Martin testified that the police\ndepartment was responsible for enforcing Salute's speech restrictions as part of the\ncity's agreement to lease Salute the property, and Posner testified that the police\ndischarged this enforcement responsibility \"on [Salute's] behalf.\"\n\n       On May 18, 2005 the district court granted a temporary injunction permitting\nplaintiffs to distribute leaflets and wear expressive clothing at the 2005 air show, but\nnot allowing them to circulate petitions or engage in other forms of solicitation. It\nfound that Salute was a state actor because of the degree to which the city and Salute\nwere intertwined in the staging of the air show. The court also found that the city had\ndelegated a public function to Salute by giving Posner control over the police during\nthe air show. Subsequent to the court's order and prior to the 2005 air show, Salute\nwrote to the police department disavowing any delegation of police authority and\nstating that Salute \"will play no role in the exercise of authority and discretion by the\nCity Police . . . .\"\n\n      At the 2005 air show, leafleting and expressive clothing were permitted as\nrequired by the temporary injunction; sign carrying was also allowed even though it\nhad not been specifically addressed in the order. At a subsequent deposition, Captain\nMartin testified that no one had tried to circulate petitions at the 2005 event but that\nhe would have stopped anyone who did, not because such activity violated a city\nordinance, but because Salute disapproved it and it was not protected by the temporary\n\n                                          -6-\n\finjunction. A handful of individuals were present inside the secured tarmac at the\n2005 event to hand out leaflets or carry signs. Martin observed no disturbances\ncaused by their presence at the air show. Several members of the public did submit\nwritten complaints to Salute about the presence of \"protestors\" on the tarmac. One\nindividual handed out commercial leaflets advertising a nearby restaurant, and Posner\nlater testified that she was concerned that there would be more commercial leafleting\nat future shows.\n\n       On March 3, 2006, after additional depositions and hearings had occurred and\nevidence about the 2005 air show had been produced, the district court issued a\npermanent injunction. The injunction incorporated its earlier May 18, 2005 order by\nreference. As a predicate to its First Amendment analysis, the district court once again\nfound Salute to be a state actor when it enforced its speech restrictions against\nplaintiffs, because it was entangled with the city in planning the air show and\nmonitoring unwanted expressive activities. It also held the city accountable for the\ndirect role of the police in enforcing the speech restrictions.\n\n        The court concluded that the air show was a non public forum in which Salute\nas a state actor could impose reasonable and neutral regulations without offending the\nFirst Amendment, but that a blanket prohibition on leafleting and sign carrying was\nneither reasonable nor viewpoint neutral. It found that Salute's prohibition on\npetitioning was permissible, however, because it was both reasonable and uniformly\nenforced. The district court ordered Salute and the city to permit leafleting, sign\ncarrying, and the wearing of expressive clothing at future air shows subject to\nreasonable restrictions on time, place, and manner. The court also gave special\nconsideration to Salute's noontime ceremony at the show, ordering that Salute could\nrestrict expressive activities at that daily event and the city could lawfully remove\nindividuals who did not respect those restrictions. The court rejected Salute's\nargument that it had a First Amendment right to exclude all unwanted forms of\nexpression at its air show, questioning whether a state actor like Salute had First\n\n                                          -7-\n\fAmendment rights. Even if it did, the court reasoned, the presence of other messages\non the tarmac would not interfere with such rights.\n\n       Salute appeals from the final judgment, contesting the district court's conclusion\nthat it was a state actor and arguing that the injunction violates its own First\nAmendment rights by forcing it to provide a forum for messages it does not support.\n Although the City of Columbia is also subject to the court's injunction, it has not\nappealed.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      Generally a district court's conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and its\nfindings of fact, for clear error.

We are guided in this inquiry by two additional\nqueries: whether the claimed deprivation \"resulted from the exercise of a right or\nprivilege having its source in state authority\" and whether the party engaging in the\ndeprivation \"may be appropriately characterized as [a] state actor[].\" See Lugar, 547\nU.S. at 939 (internal quotations omitted). Since Salute's authority to impose speech\nrestrictions at its air show derives from the city's grant to it of temporary control over\nthe airport, Lugar's first prerequisite for state action is met.

The key issue is whether Salute may\nappropriately be considered a state actor in the circumstances presented. If a party's\nconduct meets the requirements for state action, the same acts also qualify as actions\ntaken \"under color of state law\" for purposes of § 1983. Lugar, 457 U.S. at 935.\n       The Supreme Court has recognized a number of circumstances in which a\nprivate party may be characterized as a state actor, such as where the state has\ndelegated to a private party a power \"traditionally exclusively reserved to the State,\"\nsee Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109125\"><a href=\"/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352 (1974), where a private actor is\na \"willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents,\" see Adickes v.

These particular circumstances are merely examples and not intended to be\nexclusive. See id. at 295.\n\n      Our ultimate conclusion must turn on the particular facts of the case, since\n\"[o]nly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement\nof the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.\" Burton v.\nWilmington Parking Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106208\"><a href=\"/opinion/106208/burton-v-wilmington-parking-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 722 (1961). The one unyielding\nrequirement is that there be a \"close nexus\" not merely between the state and the\n\n                                           -9-\n\fprivate party, but between the state and the alleged deprivation itself. See Brentwood,\n531 U.S. at 295. No such nexus exists where a private party acts with the mere\napproval or acquiescence of the state, see Blum v. Yaretsky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110768\"><a href=\"/opinion/110768/blum-v-yaretsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1004-05\n(1982), but a private entity may be considered a state actor if it \"has acted together\nwith or has obtained significant aid from state officials\" in furtherance of the\nchallenged action. Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937.\n\n        Salute argues that this case is governed by our decision in Reinhart v. City of\nBrookings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718672\"><a href=\"/opinion/718672/ross-reinhart-v-city-of-brookings-a-south-dakota-municipal-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1071</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1996). In Reinhart, we held that the actions of a\nprivate organization in restricting political campaigning at its arts festival could not\nbe attributed to the city, even though the festival took place in a public park. The fact\nthat a city allows a private entity to hold a major event on its property is not sufficient\nto convert the private conduct of event organizers into state action even where the\norganizers impose their own rules on expressive conduct, for the state's \"mere\nacquiescence\" in an alleged deprivation is not enough. Id. at 1073. The degree of\nentanglement between the City of Columbia and Salute goes well beyond the\nrelationship in Reinhart. There, the city had no role in planning, advertising, or\nmanaging the festival, and the organizers were solely responsible for enforcing the\nrestrictions on expressive activity. Id. at 1072-73.\n\n       Here, the city's role was far more than \"mere acquiescence,\" for the city not\nonly provided critical assistance in planning and operating the show, but also played\nan active role in enforcing the particular speech restrictions challenged in this action.\nCity police, not Salute volunteers, enforce the restrictions every year, a role that\nCaptain Martin characterized as part of \"the agreement that's in place\" with Salute.\nThe active and prearranged role of the police in effectuating the event's private speech\npolicies also sets this case apart from Lansing v. City of Memphis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767512\"><a href=\"/opinion/767512/kenneth-d-lansing-v-city-of-memphis-memphis-park-commission-memphis-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th\nCir. 2000), another case relied on by Salute. In Lansing, the court specifically noted\nthat the City of Memphis had made no attempt to instruct its officers on how to police\nunwanted speech activities on festival grounds. Id. at 833-34.\n\n                                           -10-\n\f      The direct role of the Columbia police in enforcing Salute's speech restrictions\nprovided the critical nexus, absent in other cases, between the challenged conduct and\nthe exercise of state authority.4 See, e.g., Gaston, 43 F.3d at 909 n.4 (appellant\nconceded absence of nexus); see also D'Amario v. Providence Civic Ctr. Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"464695\"><a href=\"/opinion/464695/arthur-damario-iii-v-the-providence-civic-center-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1986) (city officials' enforcement of private speech restriction\nprovides requisite nexus between alleged deprivation and state involvement).\n\n       Salute contends that its contract with the city transformed the airport into its\nown temporary private property,5 over which it had the right to decide who was\nwelcome and who was not and thereafter to seek police assistance in ejecting\ntrespassers. To be sure, the mere invocation of state legal procedures, including police\nassistance, does not convert a private party into a state actor.

In Griffin v. Maryland, the Supreme Court distinguished between a deputy\nsheriff's enforcement of trespass law and his active enforcement of a private park's\nsegregation policy, holding that the latter situation amounted to state action. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106872\"><a href=\"/opinion/106872/griffin-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136-37 (1964). Here, the police department's security plan instructed the officers\nto enforce Salute's rules rather city ordinances, and police took an active role in\nidentifying and intercepting protesters at the air show, including Wickersham and\nDoyle. The city's cooperation with Salute was directed toward effectuating the\nchallenged policy rather than merely keeping the peace. See Howerton v. Gabica, 708\n\n\n\n      4\n       Municipalities are state actors for the purpose of § 1983 claims. Monell v.\nDep't of Soc.

See Murray v. Wal-Mart, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522953\"><a href=\"/opinion/522953/mary-murray-v-wal-mart-inc-earnest-harris-individually-and-as-manager/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n558-559 (8th Cir. 1989); see also Dossett v.

In making its findings the district court specifically rejected\nthe suggestion that Salute had asked for nothing more from the city than the use of its\nproperty. The record supports the trial court's findings, for it contains evidence of a\nmutual understanding that city police would work to restrict speech activities at the\nair show according to Salute's wishes.\n\n       Although certain changes occurred between the entry of the temporary and\npermanent injunctions, including Posner's statement to the police disclaiming\nauthority to direct their actions at the air show, the overall \"momentum\" of the\ncooperation remained unaltered. See Brentwood, 531 U.S. at 301 (quoting Evans v.\nNewton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107137\"><a href=\"/opinion/107137/evans-v-newton/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (1966)). In its order granting the permanent injunction the\ndistrict court again found that Salute and the city had acted \"like partners\" with respect\nto the 2005 air show and that their mutual understanding about the city's role in\nenforcing the speech restrictions continued as before.6 In light of the evidence\nshowing a continuing history of cooperation and Captain Martin's admission that he\nwould have enforced Salute's rules at the 2005 air show even where city ordinances\nhad not been violated, we cannot characterize these findings as clearly erroneous.\nEven if the police no longer received directions from Salute at the air show or\nconsulted Salute members about whom to arrest, they nevertheless continued to\n\n\n      6\n       The district court specifically found that \"the City knows, when it enters into\nthe temporary lease of the tarmac, that the Corporation will exclude all unauthorized\nspeech and will seek the assistance of the City to enforce those rules.\"\n                                         -12-\n\frespond to the broader directives of Salute by enforcing its speech restrictions as part\nof their security duties. Cf. Brentwood, 531 U.S. at 301 n.4 (\"underlying reality\" of\nprivate entity's relationship to the state often trumps legal formalities erected in\nattempt to thwart a finding of state action).\n\n      Since Salute and the city were knowingly and pervasively entangled in the\nenforcement of the challenged speech restrictions, we conclude that Salute was a state\nactor when it interfered with appellees' expressive activities. The district court did\ntherefore not err in holding that Salute's curtailment of appellees' freedom of\nexpression constituted state action and was actionable under § 1983.\n\n       Salute next argues that the district court's order requiring it to permit leafleting,\nsign carrying, and expressive clothing at the air show interferes with its own First\nAmendment right to control the expressive content of its event, relying on Hurley v.\nIrish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117960\"><a href=\"/opinion/117960/hurley-v-irish-american-gay-lesbian-and-bisexual-group-of-boston-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). In Hurley, a\nstate court had ordered a private association to include a group of gays, lesbians, and\nbisexuals as a marching unit in its St. Patrick's Day Parade in compliance with a state\npublic accommodation law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation. Id. at 562-63. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that application of\nthe state law violated the parade organizer's First Amendment rights since the state\ncannot compel a private entity to disseminate particular views or to alter its message\nto suit the government. Id. at 573. Salute cites Hurley as authority for its argument\nthat the order compelling it to permit other messages at its air show violates its First\nAmendment rights.\n\n       Appellees respond that as a state actor Salute cannot assert rights under the First\nAmendment, echoing the district court's suggestion that state actors do not enjoy the\nsame constitutional rights guaranteed to private entities like the parade organizer in\nHurley. Neither appellees nor the district court cited authority for this proposition.\nAppellees also argue that even if Salute had the full panoply of First Amendment\nrights, the district court's injunction would not violate those rights because Salute is\n                                          -13-\n\fnot being compelled to affirm any message with which it disagrees; rather it is being\nrequired to tolerate the presence of other messages from which it may easily dissociate\nitself.\n\n       Unlike Salute the parade organizer in Hurley was not a state actor, see id. at\n566, and there was no question that the organizer maintained its full rights under the\nFirst Amendment. The Supreme Court concluded that those rights were violated by\nthe presence of unwanted marching units because they would have altered the\norganizer's message which was communicated by the composition of the parade. Id.\nat 576. In contrast Salute has not shown that its message was dependent upon the\ncomposition of the crowd at the air show. The competing expressive interests were\nalso considered in Hurley. The Court pointed out that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual\ngroup could put on a parade of its own to promote its message, see id. at 578, but\nappellees here could not likely organize an event similar to the air show in order to\nadvance their views or secure the kind of privileged access to city property that Salute\nenjoys.\n\n        Whether a private entity like Salute forfeits some of its right to deliver its own\nmessage unimpeded by others when it assumes the role of state actor need not be\ndecided on this record because Salute has not shown that the injunction infringed its\nown ability to deliver its chosen message. The district court's injunction protects\nSalute's daily noontime ceremony in honor and remembrance of veterans from any\ncompeting expressive activities, giving Salute complete control over the message that\nit wants to communicate during this special event. The presence of nondisruptive\nexpressive conduct during the remainder of the air show was not shown to threaten to\nalter Salute's message. There is no evidence that Salute's message was diluted by the\npresence of a small number of sign carriers and leafleters at the 2005 air show, which\nwas attended by over 25,000 people. Appellees sought only to express their own\nviews as spectators at the air show, and their signs and leaflets were \"not likely [to]\nbe identified\" with Salute. See Pruneyard Shopping Ctr. v. Robins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110292\"><a href=\"/opinion/110292/pruneyard-shopping-center-v-robins/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87\n(1980); see also Parks v.

See\nRumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-rights-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See\nPruneyard, 447 U.S. at 87. If the City of Columbia has shown any preference for a\nparticular message, it has been for Salute's. The present situation involving a large air\nshow, free and open to the public, has more relevant similarities to Pruneyard, where\nthe Supreme Court held that a mall owner's First Amendment rights were not violated\nby a state constitutional requirement that he allow petitioning on his property. Id. at\n88.\n\n       On this record we cannot say that the presence of leafleters and sign carriers\ninterfered with any First Amendment rights Salute might have in the circumstances\nwhere its involvement is that of a state actor. In deciding that Salute could not\nconstitutionally prohibit all sign carrying and leafleting at its air show, the district\ncourt did not hold that Salute could impose no restrictions on those activities. Salute\nremains free to impose reasonable and viewpoint neutral rules related to time, place,\nand manner.
