SMITH, JR., Circuit Judge:\n\n   This case presents the question whether a Washington state\nlaw providing for convicted sex offenders’ early release into\ncommunity custody creates a liberty interest that is protected\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nWe hold that it does not. We therefore affirm the decision of\nthe district court denying Carver relief in this civil rights\naction.\n\n           Factual and Procedural Background\n\n   In August 1999, Joseph Dale Carver, then 20 years old,\npled guilty to child molestation in the third degree. This con-\nviction followed two prior convictions for child molestation\nin the first degree and a conviction for third-degree assault.\nCarver committed his first sex offense at age 14. He was sen-\ntenced to fifty-four months of confinement in the custody of\nthe Washington State Department of Corrections (“DOC”) for\nhis 1999 conviction. The brief record on appeal indicates Car-\nver committed fifteen disciplinary infractions while incarcer-\nated, including sexual harassment of a prison staff member.\n\n  Washington Revised Code § 9.94A.728(1)(b)(ii)(B)(I) pro-\nhibits early release for those convicted of sex offenses. How-\never, section 9.94A.728(2)(a) provides that sex offenders may\n\f16648                     CARVER v. LEHMAN\nbecome eligible for transfer to community custody in lieu of\nearly release.1 Carver was sentenced to a consecutive thirty-\nsix month period of community custody to begin on his\nadjusted release date.2 Carver’s behavior as a prisoner resulted\nin an adjusted release date of January 13, 2003.\n\n   Before an inmate is eligible for transfer to community cus-\ntody, he must submit an acceptable “release plan.” WASH.\nREV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(c). Carver submitted his proposed\nplan in March 2002. It was denied in April 2002, pursuant to\na DOC policy then in effect which provided for the categori-\ncal denial of release plans of offenders, like Carver, whom the\nDOC determined “appear[ed] to meet the definition of a sexu-\nally violent predator and [who had] been referred for Civil\nCommitment . . . .” DOC Policy Directive 350.200 (May 4,\n2001).3 As a result of the denial of his proposed release plan,\nCarver served his full term of confinement.\n   1\n     “Community custody is the intense monitoring of an offender in the\ncommunity for a period of at least one year after release or transfer from\nconfinement. Although it has other purposes, community custody contin-\nues in the nature of punishment, and is not equivalent to general release.”\nIn re Crowder, 985 P.2d 944, 945 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999) (footnote omit-\nted). Offenders in community custody live in a residence pre-approved by\nthe DOC and are subject to mandatory and discretionary conditions\nimposed by either the DOC or the sentencing court. See, e.g., WASH. REV.\nCODE §§ 9.94A.710(2)-(3), 9.94A.700(4)-(5) (listing mandatory and dis-\ncretionary conditions imposed on offenders subject to community custody\nincluding reporting requirements, payment of supervision fees, and prohi-\nbitions against possession of controlled substances and consumption of\nalcohol).\n   2\n     When an inmate is first transferred to the DOC, the DOC calculates\nthree possible release dates for the inmate. First, the maximum release\ndate is the date the inmate would finish serving the entire sentence\nimposed. Second, the earned early release date is the date the inmate\nwould be released if he earned all available sentence reductions and does\nnot lose time for misbehavior. Third, the adjusted release date is the pro-\njected date on which the inmate would be released if he loses no further\ngood time or earned time credits.\n   3\n     As we explain infra, this policy was subsequently struck down by the\nWashington Court of Appeals in In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d 635, 640 (Wash.\nCt. App. 2002) (holding that “DOC Policy 350.200 . . . violates the gov-\nerning statutes”).\n\f                          CARVER v. LEHMAN                         16649\n   In September 2004, Carver filed a civil rights suit under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, asserting that DOC officials denied him early\nrelease into community custody without affording him due\nprocess of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.4 The district\ncourt, adopting the report and recommendation of the magis-\ntrate judge, granted the DOC officials’ motion for summary\njudgment on two principal grounds: first, that Washington law\ndoes not create a liberty interest in early release into commu-\nnity custody and, therefore, Carver did not have a due process\nright protected by the Fourteenth Amendment; and second,\nthat even if such a right existed, Defendant Lehman was enti-\ntled to qualified immunity. Carver timely appealed.\n\n             Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n   We have jurisdiction to review the district court’s determi-\nnation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we review de novo\nits grant of summary judgment and finding of qualified immu-\nnity. See Mabe v. San Bernardino County, Dep’t of Pub. Soc.\nServs., 237 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2001); Galen v. County\nof Los Angeles, 477 F.3d 652, 658 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n                              Discussion\n\n  [1] The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nprovides that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty,\nor property, without due process of law. . . .” U.S. Const.\namend. XIV, § 1. Our analysis of due process claims proceeds\n  4\n   Carver’s original complaint named as a defendant only Joseph Leh-\nman, secretary of the DOC at the time that Carver’s release plan was\ndenied. In his amended complaint, Carver named two additional defen-\ndants, Kimberley Acker and Victoria Roberts, both DOC officials\ninvolved in making end of sentence review determinations. The district\ncourt adopted the magistrate judge’s finding that Acker and Roberts were\nentitled to summary judgment because Carver failed to show that “these\ndefendants played any part in enacting the policy that precluded [Carver]\nfrom being considered for release.” Carver does not appeal this portion of\nthe judgment below.\n\f16650                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nin two steps. “[T]he first asks whether there exists a liberty or\nproperty interest which has been interfered with by the State;\nthe second examines whether the procedures attendant upon\nthat deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.” Ky. Dep’t of\nCorr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989) (citation omit-\nted).\n\n   [2] “A liberty interest may arise from either of two sources:\nthe due process clause itself or state law.” Toussaint v.\nMcCarthy, 801 F.2d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 1986). Carver con-\ncedes that the Due Process Clause does not create a liberty\ninterest in an inmate’s “conditional[ ] release[ ] before the\nexpiration of a valid sentence.” Greenholtz v. Inmates of the\nNeb. Penal & Corr. Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979). Rather,\nhe argues that Washington’s statutory scheme governing early\nrelease into community custody “uses mandatory language,\n‘creat[ing] a presumption that . . . release will be granted’ . . .\nunless certain designated findings are made, and thereby gives\nrise to a constitutional liberty interest.” McQuillion v. Dun-\ncan, 306 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Greenholtz,\n442 U.S. at 12; citing Bd. of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369,\n377-78 (1987)). As in prior cases, our task here is to apply the\nwell-established mandatory language rule governing state-\ncreated liberty interests set forth by the Supreme Court in\nGreenholtz and Allen to the Washington sex offender statu-\ntory scheme at issue.5 See, e.g., Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison\n   5\n     In his response brief, Lehman argued that Sandin v. Connor, 515 U.S.\n472 (1995), should control our liberty interest inquiry. In Sandin, the\nSupreme Court considered a challenge to a prison regulation imposing\ndisciplinary segregation for misconduct. Id. at 475-77. In holding that the\nregulation did not create a liberty interest, the Court did not apply the\n“mandatory language” framework of Greenholtz and Allen. Id. at 481-86.\nInstead, it focused on whether the challenged restraint arising from the\nregulation “impose[d] atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at 484; see also Wil-\nkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 222-24 (2005) (applying Sandin to deter-\nmine whether Ohio inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding placement\nin a “supermax” prison). As Lehman properly conceded in his supplemen-\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                          16651\nTerms, 461 F.3d 1123, 1127-28 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that\nCalifornia law creates a liberty interest in parole); Biggs v.\nTerhune, 334 F.3d 910, 914 (9th Cir. 2003) (same); McQuil-\nlion, 306 F.3d at 901-902 (same); Bermudez v. Duenas, 936\nF.2d 1064, 1065-66 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that Guam law\ncreates a liberty interest in parole); Baumann v. Ariz. Dep’t of\nCorr., 754 F.2d 841, 843-45 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that Ari-\nzona law does not create a liberty interest in custodial\nrelease); Balla v. Idaho State Bd. of Corr., 869 F.2d 461, 469-\n70 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that Idaho law does not create a\nliberty interest in parole).\n\n   [3] Washington law mandates that an individual convicted\nof a sex offense be sentenced to a term of community custody\nthat “shall begin either upon completion of the term of con-\nfinement or at such time as the offender is transferred to com-\nmunity custody in lieu of earned release.” WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.710(1). Unlike other inmates, then, a convicted sex\noffender who accrues “earned release time . . . for good\nbehavior and good performance” is not entitled to early\nrelease; rather, he is eligible for discretionary transfer into\ncommunity custody at an earlier date if his proposed place-\nment is appropriate. Id. § 9.94A.728(1), (2)(a). The law\nrequires the DOC to develop a suitable program to effectuate\nthe transfer to community custody of such inmates. See id.\n§ 9.94A.728(1). As part of that program, the DOC must “re-\nquire the offender to propose a release plan that includes an\n\ntal submissions to the court, we have since held that Sandin’s holding was\nlimited to “the separate but related question of when due process liberty\ninterests are created by internal prison regulations.” McQuillion, 306 F.3d\nat 902-03 (emphasis added). See also Sass, 461 F.3d at 1127 n.3 (explain-\ning that this court has “consistently rejected th[e] argument” that Sandin\neliminated the “ ‘mandatory language’ approach of Greenholtz and\nAllen”). Accordingly, we continue to apply the “mandatory language” rule\nset forth in Greenholtz and Allen in order to determine whether Washing-\nton’s statutory scheme creates a liberty interest in early release into com-\nmunity custody.\n\f16652                 CARVER v. LEHMAN\napproved residence and living arrangement.” Id.\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(c). The law then describes how the DOC, in\nexercising its broad discretion, should evaluate such release\nplans:\n\n    The department may deny transfer to community\n    custody status in lieu of earned release time pursuant\n    to subsection (1) of this section if the department\n    determines an offender’s release plan, including pro-\n    posed residence location and living arrangements,\n    [1] may violate the conditions of the sentence or\n    conditions of supervision, [2] place the offender at\n    risk to violate the conditions of the sentence, [3]\n    place the offender at risk to reoffend, or [4] present\n    a risk to victim safety or community safety. The\n    department’s authority under this section is indepen-\n    dent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or\n    statutory provision regarding conditions for commu-\n    nity custody or community placement . . . .\n\nId. § 9.94A.728(2)(d) (emphasis added).\n\n   In order to comply with the statute, the DOC promulgated\nPolicy Directive 350.200. Under the version of this policy in\nforce when Carver submitted his release plan, the DOC\ninstructed that release plans of sex offenders be assessed to\ndetermine “the degree of risk for victims and potential victims\nof similar age or circumstances” and to ensure that, subject to\ncertain exceptions, “[s]ex offenders will not return to a resi-\ndence where minor victim(s) or other children of similar age\nare present in the residence.” DOC Policy Directive 350.200\n(May 4, 2001). This Policy Directive specified that a resi-\ndence proposed by an offender within a release plan could be\ndenied if the proposed location would place the offender in\nviolation of court-imposed conditions; at the likely risk to re-\noffend; or in close proximity to the minor victim(s), schools,\nchild care centers, playgrounds, or other facilities where chil-\ndren of similar age and circumstances surrounding the convic-\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                          16653\ntion are present and who may be put at substantial risk of\nharm by the offender residing at that location.6 The DOC’s\npolicy also provided for the categorical denial of release plans\n“if the End of Sentence Review Committee has determined\nthat the offender appears to meet the definition of a sexually\nviolent predator and s/he has been referred for Civil Commit-\nment . . . .”7 This final provision, under which Carver’s\nrelease plan was denied, was subsequently eliminated after\nthe Washington Court of Appeals held that it violated the stat-\nutory requirement that all sex offenders “may become eligi-\nble” for community custody. See Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 638-40.\n\n   Carver argues that this statutory scheme creates a protected\nliberty interest because it requires the DOC to transfer an\ninmate to community custody in lieu of earned release “unless\nany one of the . . . specifically designated reasons are\n  6\n     The last criterion derives from section 72.09.340(3)(a), which provides\nthat the DOC is “authorized to reject a residence location if the proposed\nresidence is within close proximity to schools, child care centers, play-\ngrounds, or other grounds or facilities where children of similar age or cir-\ncumstance as a previous victim are present who the department determines\nmay be put at substantial risk of harm by the sex offender’s residence at\nthat location.” WASH. REV. CODE § 72.09.340(3)(a) (2006).\n   7\n     Washington law defines “sexually violent predator” as “any person\nwho has been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violence and\nwho suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which\nmakes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if\nnot confined in a secure facility.” WASH. REV. CODE § 71.09.020(16)\n(2006). An offender determined to be a sexually violent predator may be\nsubject to civil commitment after his term of confinement. WASH. REV.\nCODE § 71.09.010 (2006). Carver’s criminal record and poor behavior\nwhile incarcerated provide sufficient basis on which the DOC could rea-\nsonably determine that Carver appeared to meet the definition of a sexu-\nally violent predator and that it would be appropriate to refer him to be\ncivilly committed for further custodial treatment after he completed his\ncriminal sentence. The legislature of the State of Washington has enacted\na civil commitment custodial treatment program run by the Department of\nSocial & Health Services in which dangerous sexual predators may be\nsafely held while efforts are made to treat their condition. See WASH. REV.\nCODE § 71.09.010.\n\f16654                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nfound[,]” thereby “creat[ing] a presumption that . . . release\n[into community custody] will be granted, and that this in turn\ncreates a legitimate expectation of release absent the requisite\nfinding that one of the justifications for [denial] exists.”\nGreenholtz, 442 U.S. at 11-12; see also Allen, 482 U.S. at\n377-78. We disagree. [4] In order to create a constitutionally\nprotected liberty interest, a statute must contain “ ‘explicitly\nmandatory language,’ i.e., specific directives to the decision-\nmaker that if the regulations’ substantive predicates are pres-\nent, a particular outcome must follow.” Thompson, 490 U.S.\nat 463 (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 472 (1983)).\nThere is no “explicitly mandatory language” in section\n9.94A.728(2) creating a substantive right to transfer to com-\nmunity custody. The statute, using classically permissive lan-\nguage, states that a “person convicted of a sex offense . . .\nmay become eligible, in accordance with a program devel-\noped by the department, for transfer to community custody\nstatus in lieu of earned release time.” WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(a). The only “explicitly mandatory language”\nin section 9.94A.728(2) concerns a procedural right to an\nindividualized determination based on the merits of a pro-\nposed release plan.8 That language cannot create a “liberty\ninterest” within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause “expectation of receiving process is not, without\nmore, a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause”\n   8\n     Subsection (2)(c) reads: “The department shall, as a part of its program\nfor release to the community in lieu of earned release, require the offender\nto propose a release plan that includes an approved residence and living\narrangement.” As the Washington Court of Appeals in In re Dutcher held,\nthis language, combined with language in subsection (2)(d), mandates that\nthe DOC make an individualized determination “based on the merits of a\nrelease plan.” 60 P.3d at 638. The DOC’s failure to provide such an evalu-\nation rendered unlawful its further detention of sex offenders without an\nindividualized determination, a statutory wrong for which the Washington\nRules of Appellate Procedure provide relief. See Wash. R. App. P. 16.4(a),\n(c)(2) (providing that “the appellate court will grant appropriate relief to\na petitioner if . . . the petitioner’s restraint is unlawful.”). Thus, Dutcher\nstands for the proposition that release plans may not be categorically\ndenied. It does not require that release plans be categorically approved.\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                           16655\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S.\n238, 250-51 n.12 (1983); see also In re Cashaw, 866 P.2d 8,\n12 (Wash. 1994) (“The United States Supreme Court and the\nNinth Circuit have clearly held that procedural laws do not\ncreate liberty interests; only substantive laws can create these\ninterests.”).9\n\n   [5] Pursuant to that procedural mandate, the DOC has no\n“discretion to decide whether or when to consider an offender\nfor transfer to community custody,” In re Liptrap, 60 P.3d\n1227, 1232 (Wash. Ct. App. 2005) (emphasis added). But\nWashington law places no substantive limitation on how the\nDOC is to make that determination. As noted above, section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) enumerates four criteria for evaluating the\ntransfer plan. The statute instructs that the DOC “may deny\ntransfer to community custody if” one or more of those\ncriteria are met. Id. (emphasis added). Far from setting forth\n“substantive predicates” under which the DOC must grant\ntransfer, the statute is silent regarding even precatory criteria\nfor granting transfer to community custody, specifying only\nwhen the DOC “may”—but need not10 — “deny.”\n\n   No particular words are necessary to create a liberty interest.11\nIf the section 9.94A.728(2)(d) criteria for denying transfer\nconstituted an exhaustive list of reasons for denial, the lan-\nguage would be effectively mandatory, giving rise to a pre-\n  9\n    Cashaw, like Dutcher, instead grounded the inmate’s right to challenge\nhis restraint because of procedural error in Washington Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 16.4. Id. at 13-14.\n   10\n      Section 72.09.340(3) contains two narrower circumstances under\nwhich “the department shall not approve a residence location”: if the pro-\nposed residence includes a minor child who might be put at risk, or if it\nis close in proximity to the current residence of the prisoner’s minor vic-\ntim.\n   11\n      In Allen, the Supreme Court “reject[ed] the argument that a statute that\nmandates release ‘unless’ certain findings are made is different from a\nstatute that mandates release ‘if,’ ‘when,’ or ‘subject to’ such findings\nbeing made.” 482 U.S. 369, 378 (1987).\n\f16656                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nsumption of transfer. Nothing in the statute, however,\nindicates that those four criteria are the sole reasons for which\nthe DOC may deny transfer.12 To the contrary: immediately\nfollowing the enumeration, the statute goes on to state that the\nDOC’s “authority under this section is independent of any\ncourt-ordered condition of sentence or statutory provision\nregarding conditions for community custody or community\nplacement.” WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(d). The stat-\nute’s manifest purpose, therefore, is to preserve to the DOC\nthe discretion to deny transfer in the event that it makes one\nof the four determinations, notwithstanding what other legal\nsources might otherwise require.\n\n  To convert this non obstante permissive clause, meant to\npreserve discretion in certain cases, into an expressio unius\nprovision that would limit discretion to all but those cases\nwould be to invert the very purpose for which this statute was\ndrafted.13 These statutes were enacted to protect the commu-\n  12\n      If, for example, the statute stated that DOC “may” deny transfer “only\nif” certain criteria are met or “unless” they are not, that might sufficiently\nlimit the discretion of the DOC to the point it creates an expectation of\nrelease. The distinction between “if” and “only if,” however, is not a mere\nquibble over vocabulary—it goes right to the heart of whether the criteria\nof section 9.94A.728(2)(d) are necessary or sufficient conditions for trans-\nfer, and therefore whether transfer is mandatory or entirely discretionary.\n“May . . . only if” would be effectively identical to “shall . . . unless”;\n“may . . . if” is not.\n   13\n      The canon of construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius stands\nfor the proposition that, when the legislature provides a list of related\nitems, it impliedly means to exclude other items not listed. See Norman\nJ. Singer, 2A Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47:23 (7th\ned. 2007). Such a result will obtain, however, only in the absence of evi-\ndence to the contrary. “The maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius is\nan aid to construction, not a rule of law. It can never override clear and\ncontrary evidences of [legislative] intent.” Neuberger v. Comm’r, 311 U.S.\n83, 88 (1940); see also Wash. State Labor Council v. Reed, 65 P.3d 1203,\n1209 (Wash. 2003) (“[T]he rule of expressio unius est exclusio alterius\nd[oes] not necessarily apply without considering other factors which may\npersuade the court that legislative intent was the opposite of what the stat-\nutory construction rule would require.”). In this case, the statement that\nsex offenders only “may” receive transfer, combined with the final sen-\ntence of the paragraph, make clear the permissive intent of the statute.\n\f                          CARVER v. LEHMAN                         16657\nnity from recidivist offenders whose proclivity to sexually\nabuse children is well-documented and whose anti-social ten-\ndencies are notoriously difficult to remedy through traditional\npenological methods. Carver’s record would cause any rea-\nsonably cautious state official to pause before authorizing\neven closely supervised release to the community. On the\nbasis of his prior record alone—even before this latest\nconviction—a Washington superior court found probable\ncause that Carver was a sexually violent predator. A forensic\npsychological examination had concluded that Carver was, in\nhis own words, “a civil commitment case”—that is, he was\nfound to meet the criteria of a sexually violent predator. Sec-\ntion 9.94A.728(2)(d) reserves discretion for DOC officials\nprecisely so they may deny release plans of prisoners like\nCarver who remain threats to the community.\n\n    [6] Our reading of section 9.94A.728(2)(d) is consistent\nwith the case law of the Washington state courts construing\nit.14 In the text of In re Liptrap, the Washington Court of\nAppeals noted that the statute “stat[es] reasons why the\ndepartment may deny a release plan,” 111 P.3d at 1232, but\nkept those “reasons” in the indefinite: they are just “reasons”\n—not the reasons, let alone the only reasons—for denial. Sim-\nilarly, In re Dutcher held simply that “the statute . . . requires\nDOC to base its community custody eligibility decisions on\nthe merits of the release plan,” 60 P.3d at 638, which is hardly\nto imply that section 9.94A.728(2)(d) provides the sole rubric\nby which those “merits” are to be evaluated.\n\n   [7] It is true that the cases cited above refer to a “limited\nliberty interest” held by prisoners in transfer to community\ncustody. Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231; see also Dutcher, 60 P.3d\nat 636 (describing a “limited but protected liberty interest” in\n  14\n    “Whether a state statute provides such a protectable entitlement\ndepends on the structure and language of the statute, as well as the state\ncourts’ interpretation of the scope of the interest.” Bergen v. Spaulding,\n881 F.2d 719, 721 (9th Cir.1989) (emphasis added).\n\f16658                  CARVER v. LEHMAN\ntransfer); Crowder, 985 P.2d at 945 (“The statutory right to\nearned early release creates a limited liberty interest requiring\nminimal due process.”). We must not be confused, however,\nby those decisions’ use of a Fourteenth Amendment term of\nart: those cases concerned only the procedural right to com-\npliance with individualized consideration on the merits of\nprisoners’ release plans, secured by Washington Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 16.4(a). Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1234; Dut-\ncher, 60 P.3d at 638. To the extent they contain dicta using\nthe same term, “liberty interest,” to refer to both a substantive\nright to transfer and a procedural right to consideration on the\nmerits, the most logical reading is that both derive from\nWashington law, and are hence of the same sub-constitutional\nnature. Regardless, those dicta provide no justification for dis-\nregarding the plain language of the statute.\n\n   Washington appellate courts have been careful to distin-\nguish between the state habeas relief available through per-\nsonal restraint petitions for violations of state law, and\npersonal restraint petitions to redress violations of a constitu-\ntional magnitude. The decisions in Dutcher, Crowder, and\nCashaw are examples of the former. In Cashaw, the Washing-\nton State Supreme Court explicitly rejected the lower court’s\nholding that the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board’s fail-\nure to follow mandatory parole procedures constituted an\ninfringement of Fourteenth Amendment Rights. 866 P.2d at\n12. Though it concluded that “the Board had violated its own\nprocedural rules for parolability hearings,” it specifically held\nit was error to conclude “this violation was of constitutional\nmagnitude.” Id. at 13. The cases that refer to a “limited liberty\ninterest” do not support Judge Reinhardt’s conclusion that\nstate law regarding community custody creates a liberty inter-\nest arising under the Constitution.\n\n   Washington courts have implied only one limit on the sub-\nstance of the DOC’s exercise of discretion: its reasons for\ndenial must be “legitimate.” Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1234; Crow-\nder, 985 P.2d at 946. But there is no indication that a reason\n\f                          CARVER v. LEHMAN                        16659\nmay acquire “legitimacy” only by its enumeration in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d). Indeed, every indication is to the contrary:\nIn re Crowder, the first case to imply a requirement of “legiti-\nmate reasons” for denial of transfer to community custody,\nspecified the petitioner’s “own withdrawal of a suggested\nplacement plan” as one of the “legitimate reasons” for deny-\ning him transfer, 985 P.2d at 946—a reason which certainly\nseems legitimate, but appears nowhere in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d).15 No Washington case has provided a gen-\neral definition for what makes a reason “legitimate,” which\ncould be as broad as “any reason having a rational basis,” or\neven “any reason not otherwise proscribed by law.” This ill-\ndefined “right” to transfer only in the absence of some “legiti-\nmate” reason to deny is hardly a sufficient “substantive predi-\ncate” to produce the “legitimate expectation of release”\nrequired of a protected liberty interest under Greenholtz. 442\nU.S. at 12.\n\n   [8] The analysis employed by the Washington courts in\nparole and community release cases confirms our conclusion\nthat section 9.94A.728(2)(d) does not create a liberty interest.\nDOC officials had legitimate concern that Carver, based on\nhis multiple sex convictions and behavior in prison, had not\npresented an acceptable release plan to alleviate the concern\nfor public safety. The Constitution requires no more.\n\n            Response to Preamble of Concurrence\n\n  We readily acknowledge the self-evident truth of Judge\nReinhardt’s observation that in our judicial system the out-\ncome of important appellate cases can vary based on the com-\nposition of the judicial body or panel deciding those cases. It\nhas been so ever since the founding of the Republic, and will\n  15\n    In re Crowder predated the enactment of section 9.94A.728(2)(d) by\nthree years. There is no indication in subsequent case law, however, that\ncodification of certain reasons in section 9.94A.728(2)(d) has somehow\nnarrowed the range of “legitimacy.”\n\f16660                     CARVER v. LEHMAN\ninevitably be so in the future so long as we are judged by\nhuman beings. We respectfully disagree, however, with much\nof the balance of our concurring friend’s preambular observa-\ntions about this case, and we feel it appropriate to respond.\n\n   We observe first that our concurring colleague saddled his\npoint to a rather weak horse. Releasing a potentially danger-\nous child molester who may readily reoffend does not fit well\nwithin his critical matrix for determining protectable liberty\ninterests, and certainly does not reach any “matters as basic\nas affirmative action, a woman’s right of choice, and the\nnature of religious liberty.” Concurrence at 16667.\n\n   Our colleague states that the “Constitution did not change\nbetween the time of the original panel’s decision and the time\nof the new majority’s opinion. All that changed is the compo-\nsition of the three-judge panel.” Concurrence at 16667. This\nimplies that the previous panel majority unearthed an unal-\nloyed constitutional nugget waiting to be discovered within\nthe primordial crust of the Fourteenth Amendment, but which\nmust now be reinterred and disregarded as a result of the pass-\ning of one of our colleagues. This implication ignores Judge\nReinhardt’s candid admission that “[t]he constitutional ques-\ntion is a close one, and substantial arguments can be made for\neither position.” Concurrence at 16667. It further disregards\nboth the rules of our court and the vicissitudes of life.\n\n   The respective corpora of the opinion and concurrence in\nthis case discuss the disputed nature of the constitutional\nquestion. But whatever the merits of each side’s constitutional\nanalysis, we respectfully disagree with Judge Reinhardt’s con-\ntention that the prior majority’s opinion actually became a\nbinding construction of the Constitution before Judge Fergu-\nson’s death. No opinion of this circuit becomes final until the\nmandate issues, and the opinion issued by the prior majority\nwas only part way through its finalization process.16 Just as\n  16\n    United States v. Ruiz, 935 F.2d 1033 (9th Cir. 1991) clarifies that “no\nexpectation of finality can attach during the period in which either party\n\f                          CARVER v. LEHMAN                          16661\njudges occasionally change their minds post-conference, or\nduring the exchange of draft opinions, the insertion of a new\ncolleague can change a panel’s perspective on an issue. We\nnote also that until the mandate has issued, opinions can be,\nand regularly are, amended or withdrawn, either at the request\nof the parties pursuant to a petition for panel rehearing, or sua\nsponte by the panel itself. For example, in the ninety days\nbetween July 11, 2008, and October 9, 2008, at least ten pub-\nlished opinions were withdrawn17 and at least ten opinions\nwere amended18 in our circuit. Thus, the prior majority’s hold-\n\nmay petition for rehearing.” Id. at 1037 (quoting United States v. Fourmai,\n910 F.2d 617, 620 (9th Cir. 1990)). Thus, until the mandate issues, an\nopinion is not fixed as “settled Ninth Circuit law,” and reliance on the\nopinion is a “gamble.” Id. Moreover, in recognition of the human condi-\ntion, our rules provide that “[i]f a member of a three-judge panel becomes\nunavailable by reason of death, disability, or departure from the court and\nthe case is under submission, the Clerk shall draw a replacement by lot.”\nNinth Circuit General Orders 3.2g.\n   17\n      Granados-Oseguera v.

LEHMAN\ning in this case may or may not have survived until the man-\ndate issued, but it was certainly not yet enshrined as a binding\nconstruction of the Constitution when Judge Ferguson died.\n\n   Our concurring friend also suggests that the only proper\nway to correct an opinion that was in error ab initio is through\nthe en banc process. This suggestion ignores the rules and\nfacts just cited, and also disregards the fact that an opinion,\nlike the one in this case, may not involve issues of a nature\nrequired to merit a rehearing en banc under our rules (e.g.\ndirect conflict with a published, binding opinion, or a “ques-\ntion of exceptional importance,” Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)), and\nyet may still be flawed and wanting correction.\n\n   We readily agree that only published opinions of the court\nare precedential, and that no court is bound by unpublished\ndispositions except when they are “relevant under the doctrine\nof law of the case or rules of claim preclusion or issue preclu-\nsion.” Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3(a). Unpublished dispositions\ncan also be properly cited in our court, whatever their value,\nwhen they were issued on or after January 1, 2007, Fed. R.\nApp. P. 32.1(a), and nothing in our rules prohibits our own\njudges from considering or referring to unpublished disposi-\ntions issued at any point in time, and even relying on them so\nlong as they do not conflict with binding precedential deci-\nsions. Even pre-January 1, 2007, unpublished opinions can be\ncited and considered, for example, in the context of determin-\ning whether the law was established in the context of qualified\nimmunity, Prison Legal News v. Lehman, 397 F.3d 692, 701-\n02 (9th Cir. 2005) (“[i]n determining whether [plaintiff’s]\nrights in this case were clearly established . . . we may look\nat unpublished decisions”); Bahrampour v. Lampert, 356 F.3d\n969, 977 (9th Cir. 2004) (unpublished opinions, “despite their\nlack of binding precedential effect . . . can be considered in\ndetermining whether the law was clearly established” for pur-\nposes of qualified immunity); Sorrels v. McKee, 290 F 3d\n965, 971 (9th Cir. 2002) (unpublished district court opinions\n\f                              CARVER v. LEHMAN                          16663\n“[a]t most . . . show that the law was in the process of becom-\ning established”).\n\n   Nevertheless, we are only to write opinions for publication\nwhen they meet the requirements of Circuit Rule 36-2.19 It is\nalso clear, under Circuit Rule 36-2, that when a disposition\nrelies upon what a panel considers to be well-understood, pre-\nexisting law, and it takes no other action contemplated by Cir-\ncuit Rule 36-2, it should issue an unpublished disposition or\norder, not a published opinion.\n\n   The facts of this case are illustrative of the points dis-\ncussed. The case was docketed on March 2, 2006. On March\n22, 2007, Defendant-Appellant Carver sent a 28(j) letter to\nour panel identifying Chaney v. Lehman, 225 Fed. Appx. 708\n(9th Cir. March 22, 2007) as pertinent authority. Although\nPlaintiff-Appellee sent his own 28(j) letter on April 6, 2007\n  19\n    Ninth Circuit Rule 36-2 reads:\n       A written, reasoned disposition shall be designated as an OPIN-\n       ION only if it:\n         (a)   Establishes, alters, modifies or clarifies a rule of law, or\n         (b) Calls attention to a rule of law which appears to have\n       been generally overlooked, or\n         (c)   Criticizes existing law, or\n          (d) Involves a legal or factual issue of unique interest or sub-\n       stantial public importance, or\n         (e) Is a disposition of a case in which there is a published\n       opinion by a lower court or administrative agency, unless the\n       panel determines that publication is unnecessary for clarifying the\n       panel’s disposition of the case, or\n         (f) Is a disposition of a case following a reversal or remand\n       by the United States Supreme Court, or\n         (g) Is accompanied by a separate concurring or dissenting\n       expression, and the author of such separate expression requests\n       publication of the disposition of the Court and the separate\n       expression.\n\f16664                 CARVER v. LEHMAN\narguing that Chaney was not precedential because it was not\ndesignated “for publication,” he then proceeded to address\nand attempt to refute the merits of Defendant-Appellant’s\nposition regarding the import of Chaney. In deciding that\nclass plaintiffs in Chaney had not established that they held a\nFourteenth Amendment liberty interest to be released into\ncommunity custody on the first eligible release time date, the\npanel majority in Chaney cited Greenholtz v. Inmates of\nNebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1\n(1979); In re Taylor, 95 P.3d 790, 792 (2004); In re Crowder,\n97 Wash.App. 598, 985 P.2d 944, 946 (1999); In re Dutcher,\n60 P.3d 635, 640 (2002); In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d 1227, 1234\n(2005), some of which are also cited by us and Judge Rein-\nhardt.\n\n  Although Chaney was only an unpublished disposition,\nJudge Berzon wrote a vigorous dissent, making some of the\nsame arguments now made by Judge Reinhardt. Interestingly,\nJudge Berzon did not require that the disposition in Chaney\nbe published, as was her right under Circuit Rule 36-2(g).\n\n   The previous panel in this case heard oral argument on\nApril 17, 2007, having been notified by the parties of the doc-\ntrinal relevance of Chaney. Knowing that before the mandate\nissues, a panel may decide to publish its previously unpub-\nlished opinion, grant a motion for panel rehearing, or that the\ncourt may grant a motion for rehearing en banc, the previous\npanel promptly issued an order stating “Submission of this\ncase is vacated pending issuance of the mandate in Chaney v.\nLehman, No. 05-36116.” Had Chaney been published, the\nopinion filed by the original panel in this case would have\nbeen foreclosed because the constitutional issue would have\nbeen decided in the same way as we now decide it, and, more-\nover, as indicated in its order, the previous majority properly\ntook this fact into consideration. The Chaney panel ultimately\nchose not to publish its opinion (perhaps because it felt that\nthe law was well enough understood in Washington State that\nit was unnecessary to do so), and so the previous panel major-\n\f                       CARVER v. LEHMAN                    16665\nity filed its opinion on June 9, 2008, some time after the man-\ndate issued in Chaney. In addition to the Chaney panel, one\nother panel of our court, and two district judges had also con-\nsidered the constitutional issue addressed in this case, and\neach had reached the same conclusion that we do here. See\nDutcher v. Lehman, No. 06-35043, 234 Fed. App’x 631 (9th\nCir. 2007); Duncan v. Lehman, No. C04-5633RBL, 2006 WL\n1548820 (W.D. Wash. June 2, 2006); Garcia v. Lehman, No.\nC04-5893FDB, 2006 WL 827957 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 23,\n2006). Two weeks after the majority opinion was filed in this\ncase, on June 23, 2008, Defendants-Appellants filed a Petition\nfor Rehearing En Banc and Plaintiff-Appellee filed a Petition\nfor Panel Rehearing. Judge Ferguson died two days later, on\nJune 25, 2008, with the petitions for rehearing from all parties\npending, and the mandate in the case unissued. Pursuant to\nGeneral Order 3.2g, the Clerk of the Court drew Judge Tall-\nman as a replacement for Judge Ferguson on the panel, and\nan order to that effect was filed on July 25, 2008. On August\n26, 2008, an order was filed withdrawing the opinion filed on\nJune 9, 2008, and denying Plaintiff-Appellant’s Petition for\nRehearing and Defendants-Appellants’ Petition for Rehearing\nEn Banc as moot, since the new panel had voted to amend the\nprevious opinion.\n\n   [9] By any measure, the prior majority’s opinion purported\nto establish a new constitutional rule of law, because until its\nissuance, no federal or state court had found that Washington\nlaw created a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment mandating that a dangerous sex offender be\nreleased into community custody on the first eligible release\ntime date. The fact that prior rulings were not precedential,\nand thus did not bind other courts, does not change the fact\nthat they still applied the law as then understood. Indeed, we\nsuspect that the vast majority of federal and state statutes have\nnever been construed by courts, and yet they still have the\nforce of law, and are applied and construed by those governed\nby them unless and until a higher court changes or confirms\nthe prior understanding of the law in a precedential opinion.\n\f16666                  CARVER v. LEHMAN\nThus, in that sense, the prior majority’s opinion purported to\nchange existing law, and it is this amended opinion that\nrestores the law to the status quo ante, albeit in a precedential\ndecision that does bind other courts.\n\n                          Conclusion\n\n   [10] Because Washington law does not create a liberty\ninterest in transfer to community custody, we need not\naddress the sufficiency of the procedures given (or denied)\nCarver. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n  Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment\nonly:\n\n   Six months ago, the original panel in this case filed a\nmajority opinion holding that Washington state law creates a\nliberty interest in an inmate’s early release into community\ncustody. We held that the prisoner’s liberty interest is pro-\ntected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and that, accordingly, when an inmate becomes\neligible for a transfer to community custody, the prison\nauthorities may deny his request for a transfer only for one of\nthe reasons specified in the Washington statute — and only if\nhe is afforded a minimal opportunity to present his side of the\nstory before they do so. In short, we held that Washington\nprison authorities must follow Washington law and abide by\nthe United States Constitution. Joining me in that opinion was\nJudge Warren J. Ferguson, who died before we could deny the\npetition for rehearing; dissenting was Judge Milan Smith. As\na result of Judge Ferguson’s death, it was necessary to replace\nhim on this case with another member of this court drawn at\nrandom. There were no intervening decisions that changed the\nlaw between the time Judge Ferguson and I issued our opinion\n\f                        CARVER v. LEHMAN                    16667\nholding that a liberty interest exists that protects the prisoners’\nrights at issue and the time that Judge Smith, joined by our\ncolleague who replaced Judge Ferguson, issued a substitute\nopinion holding that no such liberty interest exists.\n\n   As stated above, it is indisputable that the law did not\nchange and the Constitution did not change between the time\nof the original panel’s decision and the time of the new major-\nity’s opinion. All that changed is the composition of the three-\njudge panel. To those who question whether the results in\nconstitutional and other cases depend on the membership of\nthe panel, or whether the replacement of even a single\nSupreme Court justice can change the fundamental nature of\nthe rights of all Americans with respect to matters as basic as\naffirmative action, a woman’s right of choice, and the nature\nof religious liberty, the result in the case currently before our\npanel is merely a minor illustration of how the judicial system\ncurrently operates. Solely because of fortuity, I am compelled\nto write in strong disagreement with the majority’s constitu-\ntional analysis instead of simply reaffirming an opinion vindi-\ncating the constitutional rights of the petitioner and his fellow\nprisoners in the state of Washington.\n\n   In the case before us, it is not necessary for the new major-\nity to undo the original majority’s constitutional ruling, even\nif it disagrees with it. The constitutional question is a close\none, and substantial arguments can be made for either posi-\ntion. Under these circumstances, the more important consider-\nation, in my view, is maintaining the stability and legitimacy\nof the court’s decisions. We have a procedure for correcting\ndecisions that a majority of the court believes warrant recon-\nsideration. That process is known as a en banc rehearing. It\ncan be invoked if any single judge on the court, including\neither member of the majority, elects to make a call. Relying\non this process would, in my view, be in the better interests\nof the court and the judicial system; increasing the extent to\n\f16668                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nwhich judicial decisions depend on chance and subjectivity is\nnot a wise alternative.1\n\n   Unfortunately, my colleagues, having read the above,\nincluding the footnote, have decided that it is necessary to\nrespond to this rather uncontroversial part of my concurrence.\nThey do so in a manner that misperceives the purpose and\ncontent of the three brief paragraphs.\n\n   It is true as Judge Smith points out that I chose to make my\nobservations in a case that does not involve a “matter[ ] as\nbasic as affirmative action, a woman’s right of choice, and the\nnature of religious liberty.” Maj. Op. at 16660 (quoting Con-\ncurrence at 16667). My choice was deliberate. It was made in\npart to show that judicial determinations of the law are subject\nto such vicissitudes not only in high-visibility cases but in\ncases involving all types of questions. I also chose the case\nbefore us so that our collegial discussion of how courts decide\nwhat the law shall be would be removed from the heat of\nemotional issues that sometimes cause judges to lose their\nobjectivity. To me, for these reasons this appeared to be the\nright case to engage in such a discussion, rather than, as my\ncolleagues believe, an inappropriate one. I can assure them,\nhowever, that I will shortly point to an example of the way\nour law is shaped by the replacement of one panel member by\nanother in a far more controversial case. As to the present\ncase, I remind my colleagues that we are not considering\nreleasing Carver here; he has already been released and is\nsimply suing for damages, which would be denied under my\n  1\n    I am aware that two non-precedential memorandum dispositions of this\ncourt have previously stated, in a cursory fashion, and without analysis,\nthat the Washington statute does not create a liberty interest. Footnote 15\nof the original majority opinion provides a full analysis of those decisions\nand shows clearly that the outcomes were not determined by the composi-\ntion of the panel but by the form and nature of the disposition. Surely, had\nthe members of those panels thought that they were resolving a serious\nconstitutional question they would not have done so in a non-precedential\nmemorandum disposition.\n\f                       CARVER v. LEHMAN                    16669\ntheory of the case as well as theirs. For my colleagues’ bene-\nfit, I should also state that I, of course, do not believe that I\nhave unearthed a “constitutional nugget,” Maj. Op. at 16660,\nalloyed or otherwise. This is simply a case in which Judge\nFerguson and I tried our best to do our job, including the\nmundane task of seeing that prisoners, like all other persons,\nare afforded the rights to which they are entitled under the\nlaw. I recognize that these days there are many who do not\nshare the view that prisoners’ rights deserve judicial protec-\ntion, but neither Judge Ferguson nor I was aware of any con-\nstitutional or statutory provision to that effect, except perhaps\nfor the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, 28\nU.S.C. §§ 2241 et seq.\n\n   Let me also make it clear that I have not suggested, nor do\nI believe, that Judge Smith and Judge Tallman do not have the\nauthority to withdraw the opinion filed by the initial panel and\npublished as the opinion of the court. Of course, they do. Nor\nhave I suggested that the opinion was “final”: I merely stated\nwhat I strongly believe — that it is unwise for a court, once\nit has published an opinion on a constitutional question, to\nchange its mind for so fortuitous and subjective a reason.\nRather, I suggested that a procedure exists under which we\ncould reach a different result through a more objective pro-\ncess in which the merits, not the composition of the panel,\nwould provide the basis for our action. I stated simply that\nproceeding in the latter manner would help to secure the legit-\nimacy of court decisions and, necessarily, to maintain public\nconfidence in the judicial system.\n\n   As to the majority’s lengthy disquisition on memorandum\ndispositions and published opinions, it should not be neces-\nsary for me to restate the obvious: The law is established in\npublished opinions and published opinions only. The Chaney\npanel, which declined to publish an opinion, was well aware\nthat the initial Carver panel was awaiting its decision and that\nwe would abide by its opinion if it chose to issue one. It\ndecided not to do so, thereby rejecting the opportunity to\n\f16670                        CARVER v. LEHMAN\ndefine the applicable law for the circuit. To say as the major-\nity now does, that despite the absence of a single circuit opin-\nion on an issue that has been presented to the court a number\nof times, there was “existing law” that Judge Ferguson and I\n“changed,” and that Judge Smith and Judge Tallman, by now\nreaching the diametrically opposite result are merely restoring\nour circuit law to the “status quo ante” is more than mind-\nboggling. If we were to accept this view, the law in this circuit\nwould no longer be declared in opinions; “existing” circuit\nlaw could be found in whatever sources suited anyone’s whim\nor fancy, including the Sewanee Law Review. What an odd\nlegal system we would be adopting for the Ninth Circuit —\none that would be operative in this court only. Surely my col-\nleagues cannot mean what their opinion states. Say it ain’t so,\nmy friends.2\n\n                        I.     Liberty Interest\n\n   As Judge Ferguson and I previously held, Washington’s\nstatutory scheme creates a protected liberty interest because it\nrequires the Department of Corrections (“DOC”) to transfer\nan inmate to community custody in lieu of earned release “un-\nless any one of the . . . specifically designated reasons are\nfound[,]” thereby “creat[ing] a presumption that . . . release\n[into community custody] will be granted, and . . . in turn\ncreat[ing] a legitimate expectation of release absent the requi-\nsite finding that one of the justifications for [denial] exists.”\nGreenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Corr. Com-\nplex, 442 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1979). See also Bd. of Pardons v.\nAllen, 482 U.S. 369, 377-78 (1987). The majority rejects this\nargument, finding no “ ‘explicitly mandatory language’ . . .\ncreating a substantive right to transfer to community custody”\nunder Washington law. Maj. Op. at 16654 (emphasis omit-\n  2\n    I would remind my colleagues that they are not simply seeking to make\ndebaters’ points here. Theirs is a majority opinion. They are therefore\nestablishing the law for the circuit, including the law with regard to what\nconstitutes controlling law.\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                          16671\nted). For the reasons set forth in our prior majority opinion\nand reiterated below, I believe that the current majority’s\nreading is flawed.\n\n   The Washington statutory scheme uses language that effec-\ntively mandates the transfer to community custody of those\ninmates who have earned release time and who have not been\nfound to meet one of the statutory reasons for denial of a\nrelease plan set forth in Washington Revised Code\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(d). Section 9.94A.710(1) requires that sex\noffenders be sentenced to a term of community custody to\nbegin either when the offender’s term of confinement is com-\nplete or when he is transferred as a result of earned release\ntime. Section 9.94A.728(1) likewise requires the DOC to\ndevelop and promulgate procedures by which a sex offender\nmay become eligible for transfer to community custody in\nlieu of earned release time. The same section then sets forth\nthe limited circumstances under which the Department “may\ndeny” an inmate’s proposed plan for transfer to community\ncustody. WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(d) (listing as legit-\nimate reasons for denial, a DOC determination that the release\nplan may violate the conditions of the sentence or conditions\nof supervision, place the offender at risk to violate the condi-\ntions of the sentence, place the offender at risk to reoffend, or\npresent a risk to victim or community safety). By placing sub-\nstantive limitations on DOC’s discretion to deny release plans\nand, in particular, by requiring that denial of such plans be\nbased on the limited criteria contained in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d), Washington has created a liberty interest in\nearly release into community custody that is protected by the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.3 See\n  3\n    At oral argument, Lehman urged that the presence of more specific\ncriteria for denial of proposed residence locations in section\n72.09.340(3)(a) undermines Carver’s contention that the four criteria listed\nin section 9.94A.728(2)(d) provide the exclusive legitimate bases for\ndenial of a release plan. Lehman is incorrect: the bases for denial of pro-\nposed residence locations contained in section 72.09.340(3)(a) are, in\n\f16672                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nAllen, 482 U.S. at 375-76 (clarifying that a state may grant\n“significant discretion to the decisionmaker” to apply “gen-\neral or broad release criteria” without “depriv[ing] the pris-\noner of the liberty interest in parole[,]” so long as “release is\nrequired after the [decisionmaker] determines (in its broad\ndiscretion) that the necessary prerequisites exist”). See also\nBaumann, 754 F.2d at 844 (noting that “[a] state may create\na constitutionally protected liberty interest by establishing\nregulatory measures that impose substantive limitations on the\nexercise of official discretion”); Bergen v. Spaulding, 881\nF.2d 719, 721 (9th Cir. 1989) (“A board charged with decid-\ning a prisoner’s early release may be delegated significant dis-\ncretion in making its decision, and yet be constrained by legal\n\neffect, specific variations of the same more general formulations set forth\nfor denial of release plans in section 9.94A.728(2)(d). Section\n72.09.340(3)(a) provides:\n    [T]he department shall not approve a residence location if the\n    proposed residence: (I) Includes a minor victim or child of simi-\n    lar age or circumstance (as a previous victim who the department\n    determines may be put at substantial risk of harm by the offend-\n    er’s residence in the household; or (ii) is within close proximity\n    of the current residence of a minor victim, unless the where-\n    abouts of the minor victim cannot be determined or unless such\n    a restriction would impede family reunification efforts ordered by\n    the court or directed by the department of social and health ser-\n    vices. The department is further authorized to reject a residence\n    location if the proposed residence is within close proximity to\n    schools, child care centers, playgrounds, or other grounds or\n    facilities where children of similar age or circumstance as a pre-\n    vious victim are present who the department determines may be\n    put at substantial risk of harm by the sex offender’s residence at\n    that location.\nThese bases for denial of a proposed residence, which take into account\nwhether the residence includes or is near a past or potential victim, are\nsimply more specific examples of the final two criteria that serve as legiti-\nmate bases for denial under § 9.94A.728(2)(d), whether the “proposed res-\nidence location and living arrangements . . . place the offender at risk to\nreoffend, or present a risk to victim safety or community safety.” WASH.\nREV. CODE § 72.09.340(3)(a).\n\f                        CARVER v. LEHMAN                    16673\nstandards in exercising that discretion . . . . that scheme may\ngive rise to a liberty interest in early release.”) (internal cita-\ntion omitted).\n\n   That the Washington statute governing transfer to commu-\nnity custody does not use the more traditional mandatory lan-\nguage formula used in other early release statutes, i.e. stating\nthat the DOC “shall” grant release “unless” certain findings\nare made, does not require a contrary result. See Allen, 482\nU.S. at 378 (rejecting the argument that a statute must contain\nthe “shall/unless” formula in order to create a liberty interest).\nAlthough we have accorded significance to the use of the term\n“shall” in assessing whether early release statutes create a lib-\nerty interest, we have never held that use of this term is\nrequired in order to satisfy the mandatory language rule set\nforth in Greenholtz and Allen. Nor does the majority so hold\ntoday. Maj. Op. at 16654. Despite the absence of the word\n“shall,” I conclude, as the prior majority did, that the language\nof section 9.94A.728(2)(d) is mandatory. Section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) provides that the department “may deny\ntransfer to community custody . . . if” any one of four criteria\nis met. By establishing criteria under which release may be\ndenied, section 9.94A.728(2)(d) creates the presumption that,\nabsent the existence of one of those criteria, release will be\ngranted. The repetition of the criteria, albeit in more specific\nform, in section 72.09.340(3)(a) and in Policy Directive\n350.200 confirms this understanding of the mandatory nature\nof the statute.\n\n   The “may deny . . . if” formula operates in precisely the\nsame manner and has precisely the same effect as a “shall\ngrant . . . unless” clause. Under the “may deny . . . if” for-\nmula, the provision sets forth the conditions under which the\nagency may deny release. Otherwise, it must grant it. This is\ndistinguishable from state statutes that provide that a decision-\nmaker “may grant . . . if” certain criteria are met. Under the\n“may grant . . . if” formula, the agency may only grant release\n\f16674                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nif the relevant criteria are met, but it is not required to do so.4\nTherefore, under the “may deny . . . if” formula, as under a\n“shall grant . . . unless” clause, there is an expectation that\nrelease will be granted unless one of the specified conditions\nexists.\n\n   Judge Smith, who separately concurred in the original\nmajority opinion, remains unconvinced that the language of\nthe statutory scheme is mandatory. My colleague who\nreplaced Judge Ferguson agrees with him. But my reading is\nsupported by that of the Washington state courts. In interpret-\ning the statutory scheme governing early release into commu-\nnity custody, the state Court of Appeals has on two occasions\ndiscussed the mandatory nature of the law. First, in In re Dut-\ncher, an inmate similarly situated to Carver challenged the\nDOC’s failure to review his plan for release into community\ncustody pursuant to the Department’s policy of categorically\ndenying the plans of those offenders who appeared to be sexu-\nally violent predators and who were referred for civil commit-\nment. 60 P.3d 635, 635-36 (Wash. Ct. App. 2002). The court\nheld that the DOC’s policy violated the statutory mandate,\nexplaining that “the statute compels DOC to require offenders\nto develop a release plan, and requires DOC to base its com-\n   4\n     For this reason, courts have routinely held that the “may grant . . . if”\nformulation does not create a liberty interest. See, e.g., Barna v. Travis,\n239 F.3d 169, 171 (2d Cir. 2001) (New York parole statute); Dace v.\nMickelson, 797 F.2d 574, 577 (8th Cir. 1986) (South Dakota parole stat-\nute); Gale v. Moore, 763 F.2d 341, 343 (8th Cir. 1985) (Missouri parole\nstatute); Parker v. Corrothers, 750 F.2d 653, 656-657 (8th Cir. 1984)\n(Arkansas parole statute); Dock v. Latimer, 729 F.2d 1287, 1288 (10th Cir.\n1984) (Utah parole statute); Irving v. Thigpen, 732 F.2d 1215, 1217 (5th\nCir. 1984) (Mississippi parole statute); Candelaria v. Griffin, 641 F.2d\n868, 869-70 (10th Cir. 1981) (New Mexico parole statute); Williams v.\nBriscoe, 641 F.2d 274, 276-77 (5th Cir. 1981) (Texas parole statute);\nSchuemann v. Colo. State Bd. of Adult Parole, 624 F.2d 172, 174 n.2 (10th\nCir. 1980); Boothe v. Hammock, 605 F.2d 661, 664 (2d Cir. 1979) (New\nYork parole statute); Shirley v. Chestnut, 603 F.2d 805, 806-07 (10th Cir.\n1979) (Oklahoma parole statute); Wagner v. Gilligan, 609 F.2d 866, 867\n(6th Cir. 1979) (Ohio parole statute).\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                          16675\nmunity custody eligibility decisions on the merits of the\nrelease plan.” Id. at 638 (emphasis added).\n\n   Second, my conclusion that requiring a decision on the\nmerits of a release plan permits the Department to deny such\na plan only if it finds one of the statutory criteria listed in sec-\ntion 9.94A.728(2)(d) is bolstered by the state court’s interpre-\ntation of the statute in In re Liptrap. In Liptrap, inmates\nchallenged the DOC’s policy of refusing to review release\nplans of sex offenders until a forensic psychological evalua-\ntion had been completed. 111 P.3d 1227, 1229 (Wash. Ct.\nApp. 2005). In finding that the Department’s policy violated\ninmates’ due process rights, the court explained that “[t]he\nprovisions in subsections [9.94A.728(2)] (c) and (d), spell[ ]\nout what is required in a release plan and stat[e] reasons why\nthe department may deny a release[.]” Id. at 1232 (emphasis\nadded). Accordingly, the Liptrap court found that “the depart-\nment [does not have] unlimited discretion to decide whether\nand when to consider an offender for transfer to community\ncustody.” Id. Rather, the DOC’s failure to “state[ ] a legiti-\nmate reason” for the denial of a release plan, the court con-\ncluded, “deprived [the inmates] of earned early release credits\nin violation of due process.” Id. at 1234 (emphasis added).5\nThis holding is consistent with my conclusion that Washing-\nton law requires that the DOC’s denial of a release plan be\nbased on a “legitimate reason,” and that such reasons are enu-\nmerated in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).6\n  5\n     The Liptrap court specifically noted section 72.09.340’s provision for\ndenial of a release plan because the proposed residence is near young chil-\ndren as a “legitimate statutory reason for disapproving a release plan for\na sex offender.” In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1233 & n.6 (citing WASH. REV.\nCODE § 72.09.340(3)). For the reasons set forth in footnote 3, supra, this\nprovision is simply a specific example of the more general bases for denial\nset forth in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n   6\n     This provision goes on to state that “[t]he department’s authority under\nthis section is independent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or\nstatutory provision regarding conditions for community custody or com-\n\f16676                        CARVER v. LEHMAN\n   I conclude, then, as did the original panel majority, that the\nlanguage of the Washington statutory scheme, as supported\nby Washington case law, mandates the transfer to community\ncustody of those inmates who have earned release time and\nwho have not been found to meet one of the statutory reasons\nfor denial of a release, thereby creating a constitutionally-\nprotected liberty interest in the transfer. This conclusion is\nfurther supported by Washington state court decisions finding\na limited liberty interest in transfer to community custody in\nlieu of early release. The Washington Court of Appeals has\nconsistently found a “limited liberty interest in early release\ninto a community custody program . . . .” In re Crowder, 985\nP.2d 944, 944-45 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999) (holding inmate had\nliberty interest in grant or denial of community custody place-\nment upon earning of early release, but that the minimum\nlevel of due process required to protect this interest was pro-\nvided). See also In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 636 (“An inmate’s\ninterest in his earned early release credits is a limited, but pro-\ntected, liberty interest.”); In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231(same).7\n\nmunity placement.” Wash. Rev. Code § 9.94A.728(2)(d). The majority\nargues that this sentence makes it clear that the function of section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) is “to preserve to the DOC the discretion to deny transfer\nin the event that it makes one of the four determinations, notwithstanding\nwhat other legal sources might otherwise require.”\nMaj. Op. at 16656. I do not disagree. The fact that the provision permits\nthe DOC to deny release even where other legal sources would allow for\nit is irrelevant, however, to the question at hand: regardless of other legal\nsources, does the statute itself place substantive limits on the DOC’s exer-\ncise of discretion? As I explained supra, the provision’s preservation to\nthe DOC of discretion to deny transfer only “in the event that it makes one\nof the four determinations[,]” is precisely the type of substantive limitation\nthat gives rise to the liberty interest asserted here.\n   7\n     The majority contends that I read too much into the use of the word\n“liberty interest” in these cases. It first argues that the liberty interest rec-\nognized by the Washington Court of Appeals is merely procedural, rather\nthan substantive, in nature. Maj. Op. at 16658 (“[T]hose cases concerned\nonly the procedural right to compliance with individualized consideration\n\f                            CARVER v. LEHMAN                           16677\n   In sum, I would hold once again that the Washington statu-\ntory scheme governing transfer to community custody of\nthose inmates who have earned early release time creates a\nliberty interest that is protected under the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Having found this liberty\ninterest, I would, like the original panel, go a step beyond the\ncurrent majority and consider “whether the procedures atten-\ndant upon th[e] deprivation [of Carver’s liberty interest] were\nconstitutionally sufficient[.]” Kentucky Dept. of Corrections\nv. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989). Carver’s release plan\nwas denied under a categorical policy that provided him with\nno process at all; it simply rejected all plans of offenders who,\nlike Carver, appeared to fall under the definition of a sexually\nviolent predator and who were referred for civil commitment.\nAccordingly, the complete absence of procedures deprived\n\non the merits of prisoners’ release plans . . . .”). To the contrary, the Wash-\nington court explained: “An inmate’s interest in his earned early release\ncredits is a limited, but protected, liberty interest. Likewise, the depart-\nment’s compliance with requirements of statutes affecting his release is a\nprotected liberty interest.” See In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231 (quoting In\nre Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 636) (emphasis added). As this language makes\nclear, the Washington court recognizes a liberty interest in both the sub-\nstantive right to earned early release (here, in the form of transfer to com-\nmunity custody) and the distinct procedural right to have the DOC comply\nwith the requirements of the statutes governing such release.\n   The majority next suggests that “To the extent [the Washington deci-\nsions] contain dicta using the same term, ‘liberty interest,’ to refer to both\na substantive right to transfer and a procedural right to consideration on\nthe merits, the most logical reading is that both derive from Washington\nlaw, and are hence of the same sub-constitutional nature.” Maj. Op. at\n16658. That the Washington court had the federal Due Process Clause—\nand not a sub-constitutional right—in mind when analyzing section\n9.94A.728(2) is, again, evidenced by the plain language of its decision in\nLiptrap, where the court framed its discussion of the interest at stake in\nthe familiar terms of federal due process jurisprudence. See In re Liptrap,\n111 P.3d at 1231 (explaining that “[d]ue process protects against the depri-\nvation of life, liberty, or property” and finding that “[a]n inmate’s interest\nin his earned early release credits is a limited, but protected, liberty inter-\nest”).\n\f16678                   CARVER v. LEHMAN\nCarver of his liberty interest in transfer to community custody\nwithout due process of law.\n\n   Finally, I would note that the majority’s analysis of whether\nCarver presents a danger to the community is entirely beside\nthe point. That is not a question for this court. Whether the\nprison officials followed the law is. Equally important, the\nfact that the statute creates a liberty interest does not mean\nthat it does not also serve the purpose of protecting the com-\nmunity. The majority states that the purpose of the statute is\nto provide “discretion for DOC officials precisely so they may\ndeny release plans of prisoners like Carver who remain threats\nto the community.” Maj. Op. at 16657. But in establishing a\nliberty interest, the Washington statute did not ignore legiti-\nmate concerns about the safety of the community. Indeed,\namong the four permissible reasons for denying transfer into\ncommunity custody are whether such transfer would “place\nthe offender at risk to reoffend, or present a risk to victim\nsafety or community safety.” WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(d). This threat to the community, however,\nmust be established through a proper procedure in order to\njustify the deprivation of the inmate’s liberty interest; it is not\nsimply left to the unbridled discretion of the DOC. The point,\nthen, is that inmates have a constitutionally-protected liberty\ninterest in release to community custody such that when the\nDOC denies release, it must do so for one of the statutorily-\nenumerated reasons, and it must do so pursuant to proper pro-\ncedures. Here, neither requirement was met. The prison offi-\ncials simply ignored the statutory requirements and\ncategorically denied all prisoners like Carver the release to\nwhich they may have been entitled. Thus, Carver and others\nwere denied their due process rights. Let me make it abso-\nlutely clear, I do not contend that Carver was entitled to\nrelease. He may well not have been. On this record, however,\nwe cannot know. Had the DOC followed the procedures pro-\nvided by statute, and had it found that Carver’s release “pre-\nsent[ed] a risk to community safety,” the prison authorities\ncould well have retained him in custody. Following the law\n\f                        CARVER v. LEHMAN                   16679\nis not that difficult, and we are entitled to expect no less from\nour officials, prison or otherwise.\n\n                  II.   Qualified Immunity\n\n   Although unlike the current majority I conclude that Carver\nwas deprived of a liberty interest, I would as did the original\nmajority affirm the district court’s finding of qualified immu-\nnity and therefore concur in the current majority’s judgment.\n\n   Qualified immunity protects “government officials . . .\nfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does\nnot violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\nof which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). The qualified immunity\nanalysis proceeds in two parts. First, we consider whether\n“the facts alleged show that [Lehman’s] conduct violated a\nconstitutional right[.]” Galen, 477 F.3d at 658-59 (citing Sau-\ncier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200-02 (2001)). For the reasons\ndiscussed above, I would answer this question in the affirma-\ntive. Second, we ask if “the right [Lehman is] alleged to have\nviolated [was] clearly established such that a reasonable [offi-\ncial] would have understood that he was violating that\nright[.]” Id. I conclude that the answer to this question is no.\n\n   In determining whether the right alleged to have been vio-\nlated was clearly established, we must consider the right “in\nlight of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general\nproposition[.]” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201. “ ‘The contours of\nthe right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official\nwould understand that what he is doing violates that right.’ ”\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 202 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU.S. 635, 640 (1987)). Here, because section 9.94A.728(2)(d)\ndoes not use the more common mandatory term “shall,” a rea-\nsonable correctional official might not have understood that\nthe Washington statutory scheme created a liberty interest in\nearly release into community custody. Certainly, the question\nwas highly debatable at the time that Lehman was required to\n\f16680                  CARVER v. LEHMAN\nact. Carver’s plan was denied before the Washington Court of\nAppeals had issued its decisions in Dutcher and Liptrap,\nwhich clarified that not only does a limited liberty interest\nexist under state law, but that the DOC’s discretion to deny\nrelease into community custody is limited to rejection of a\nplan on the basis of the legitimate statutory criteria set forth\nin section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n\n   Because I conclude, as did the original majority, that the\nright at issue here was not sufficiently clear at the time of the\nfacts giving rise to this case such that a reasonable official\nwould understand that denying a release plan without provid-\ning a legitimate statutory reason for that denial would violate\ndue process, I would once again affirm the district court’s\ngrant of qualified immunity.\n\n                       III.   Conclusion\n\n   Washington state law creates a liberty interest in an\ninmate’s early release into community custody that is pro-\ntected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Carver was denied his due process right by the\nstate officials’ refusal to approve his release plan without\nreviewing it on its merits. At the time, however, the due pro-\ncess right arising from the existence of his liberty interest was\nnot sufficiently clearly established to meet the Saucier stan-\ndard. Because I would affirm the district court’s determina-\ntion that Lehman is entitled to qualified immunity, I therefore\nconcur in the majority’s judgment, but I respectfully disagree\nwith its reasoning.\n\f",

SMITH, JR., Circuit Judge:\n\n   This case presents the question whether a Washington state\nlaw providing for convicted sex offenders’ early release into\ncommunity custody creates a liberty interest that is protected\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nWe hold that it does not. We therefore affirm the decision of\nthe district court denying Carver relief in this civil rights\naction.\n\n           Factual and Procedural Background\n\n   In August 1999, Joseph Dale Carver, then 20 years old,\npled guilty to child molestation in the third degree. This con-\nviction followed two prior convictions for child molestation\nin the first degree and a conviction for third-degree assault.\nCarver committed his first sex offense at age 14. He was sen-\ntenced to fifty-four months of confinement in the custody of\nthe Washington State Department of Corrections (“DOC”) for\nhis 1999 conviction. The brief record on appeal indicates Car-\nver committed fifteen disciplinary infractions while incarcer-\nated, including sexual harassment of a prison staff member.\n\n  Washington Revised Code § 9.94A.728(1)(b)(ii)(B)(I) pro-\nhibits early release for those convicted of sex offenses. How-\never, section 9.94A.728(2)(a) provides that sex offenders may\n\f16648                     CARVER v. LEHMAN\nbecome eligible for transfer to community custody in lieu of\nearly release.1 Carver was sentenced to a consecutive thirty-\nsix month period of community custody to begin on his\nadjusted release date.2 Carver’s behavior as a prisoner resulted\nin an adjusted release date of January 13, 2003.\n\n   Before an inmate is eligible for transfer to community cus-\ntody, he must submit an acceptable “release plan.” WASH.\nREV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(c). Carver submitted his proposed\nplan in March 2002. It was denied in April 2002, pursuant to\na DOC policy then in effect which provided for the categori-\ncal denial of release plans of offenders, like Carver, whom the\nDOC determined “appear[ed] to meet the definition of a sexu-\nally violent predator and [who had] been referred for Civil\nCommitment . . . .” DOC Policy Directive 350.200 (May 4,\n2001).3 As a result of the denial of his proposed release plan,\nCarver served his full term of confinement.\n   1\n     “Community custody is the intense monitoring of an offender in the\ncommunity for a period of at least one year after release or transfer from\nconfinement. Although it has other purposes, community custody contin-\nues in the nature of punishment, and is not equivalent to general release.”\nIn re Crowder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1264817\"><a href=\"/opinion/1264817/in-re-crowder/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 945 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999) (footnote omit-\nted). Offenders in community custody live in a residence pre-approved by\nthe DOC and are subject to mandatory and discretionary conditions\nimposed by either the DOC or the sentencing court. See, e.g., WASH. REV.\nCODE §§ 9.94A.710(2)-(3), 9.94A.700(4)-(5) (listing mandatory and dis-\ncretionary conditions imposed on offenders subject to community custody\nincluding reporting requirements, payment of supervision fees, and prohi-\nbitions against possession of controlled substances and consumption of\nalcohol).\n   2\n     When an inmate is first transferred to the DOC, the DOC calculates\nthree possible release dates for the inmate. First, the maximum release\ndate is the date the inmate would finish serving the entire sentence\nimposed. Second, the earned early release date is the date the inmate\nwould be released if he earned all available sentence reductions and does\nnot lose time for misbehavior. Third, the adjusted release date is the pro-\njected date on which the inmate would be released if he loses no further\ngood time or earned time credits.\n   3\n     As we explain infra, this policy was subsequently struck down by the\nWashington Court of Appeals in In re Dutcher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580928\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580928/in-re-dutcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (Wash.\nCt.

LEHMAN                         16649\n   In September 2004, Carver filed a civil rights suit under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, asserting that DOC officials denied him early\nrelease into community custody without affording him due\nprocess of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.4 The district\ncourt, adopting the report and recommendation of the magis-\ntrate judge, granted the DOC officials’ motion for summary\njudgment on two principal grounds: first, that Washington law\ndoes not create a liberty interest in early release into commu-\nnity custody and, therefore, Carver did not have a due process\nright protected by the Fourteenth Amendment; and second,\nthat even if such a right existed, Defendant Lehman was enti-\ntled to qualified immunity. Carver timely appealed.\n\n             Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n   We have jurisdiction to review the district court’s determi-\nnation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we review de novo\nits grant of summary judgment and finding of qualified immu-\nnity.

REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.710(1). Unlike other inmates, then, a convicted sex\noffender who accrues “earned release time . . . for good\nbehavior and good performance” is not entitled to early\nrelease; rather, he is eligible for discretionary transfer into\ncommunity custody at an earlier date if his proposed place-\nment is appropriate. Id. § 9.94A.728(1), (2)(a). The law\nrequires the DOC to develop a suitable program to effectuate\nthe transfer to community custody of such inmates. See id.\n§ 9.94A.728(1). As part of that program, the DOC must “re-\nquire the offender to propose a release plan that includes an\n\ntal submissions to the court, we have since held that Sandin’s holding was\nlimited to “the separate but related question of when due process liberty\ninterests are created by internal prison regulations.” McQuillion, 306 F.3d\nat 902-03 (emphasis added). See also Sass, 461 F.3d at 1127 n.3 (explain-\ning that this court has “consistently rejected th[e] argument” that Sandin\neliminated the “ ‘mandatory language’ approach of Greenholtz and\nAllen”). Accordingly, we continue to apply the “mandatory language” rule\nset forth in Greenholtz and Allen in order to determine whether Washing-\nton’s statutory scheme creates a liberty interest in early release into com-\nmunity custody.\n\f16652                 CARVER v. LEHMAN\napproved residence and living arrangement.” Id.\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(c). The law then describes how the DOC, in\nexercising its broad discretion, should evaluate such release\nplans:\n\n    The department may deny transfer to community\n    custody status in lieu of earned release time pursuant\n    to subsection (1) of this section if the department\n    determines an offender’s release plan, including pro-\n    posed residence location and living arrangements,\n    [1] may violate the conditions of the sentence or\n    conditions of supervision, [2] place the offender at\n    risk to violate the conditions of the sentence, [3]\n    place the offender at risk to reoffend, or [4] present\n    a risk to victim safety or community safety. The\n    department’s authority under this section is indepen-\n    dent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or\n    statutory provision regarding conditions for commu-\n    nity custody or community placement . . . .\n\nId. § 9.94A.728(2)(d) (emphasis added).\n\n   In order to comply with the statute, the DOC promulgated\nPolicy Directive 350.200. Under the version of this policy in\nforce when Carver submitted his release plan, the DOC\ninstructed that release plans of sex offenders be assessed to\ndetermine “the degree of risk for victims and potential victims\nof similar age or circumstances” and to ensure that, subject to\ncertain exceptions, “[s]ex offenders will not return to a resi-\ndence where minor victim(s) or other children of similar age\nare present in the residence.” DOC Policy Directive 350.200\n(May 4, 2001). This Policy Directive specified that a resi-\ndence proposed by an offender within a release plan could be\ndenied if the proposed location would place the offender in\nviolation of court-imposed conditions; at the likely risk to re-\noffend; or in close proximity to the minor victim(s), schools,\nchild care centers, playgrounds, or other facilities where chil-\ndren of similar age and circumstances surrounding the convic-\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                          16653\ntion are present and who may be put at substantial risk of\nharm by the offender residing at that location.6 The DOC’s\npolicy also provided for the categorical denial of release plans\n“if the End of Sentence Review Committee has determined\nthat the offender appears to meet the definition of a sexually\nviolent predator and s/he has been referred for Civil Commit-\nment . . . .”7 This final provision, under which Carver’s\nrelease plan was denied, was subsequently eliminated after\nthe Washington Court of Appeals held that it violated the stat-\nutory requirement that all sex offenders “may become eligi-\nble” for community custody. See Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 638-40.\n\n   Carver argues that this statutory scheme creates a protected\nliberty interest because it requires the DOC to transfer an\ninmate to community custody in lieu of earned release “unless\nany one of the . . . specifically designated reasons are\n  6\n     The last criterion derives from section 72.09.340(3)(a), which provides\nthat the DOC is “authorized to reject a residence location if the proposed\nresidence is within close proximity to schools, child care centers, play-\ngrounds, or other grounds or facilities where children of similar age or cir-\ncumstance as a previous victim are present who the department determines\nmay be put at substantial risk of harm by the sex offender’s residence at\nthat location.” WASH. REV. CODE § 72.09.340(3)(a) (2006).\n   7\n     Washington law defines “sexually violent predator” as “any person\nwho has been convicted of or charged with a crime of sexual violence and\nwho suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which\nmakes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if\nnot confined in a secure facility.” WASH. REV. CODE § 71.09.020(16)\n(2006). An offender determined to be a sexually violent predator may be\nsubject to civil commitment after his term of confinement. WASH. REV.\nCODE § 71.09.010 (2006). Carver’s criminal record and poor behavior\nwhile incarcerated provide sufficient basis on which the DOC could rea-\nsonably determine that Carver appeared to meet the definition of a sexu-\nally violent predator and that it would be appropriate to refer him to be\ncivilly committed for further custodial treatment after he completed his\ncriminal sentence. The legislature of the State of Washington has enacted\na civil commitment custodial treatment program run by the Department of\nSocial & Health Services in which dangerous sexual predators may be\nsafely held while efforts are made to treat their condition. See WASH. REV.\nCODE § 71.09.010.\n\f16654                      CARVER v.

We disagree. [4] In order to create a constitutionally\nprotected liberty interest, a statute must contain “ ‘explicitly\nmandatory language,’ i.e., specific directives to the decision-\nmaker that if the regulations’ substantive predicates are pres-\nent, a particular outcome must follow.” Thompson, 490 U.S.\nat 463 (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (1983)).\nThere is no “explicitly mandatory language” in section\n9.94A.728(2) creating a substantive right to transfer to com-\nmunity custody. The statute, using classically permissive lan-\nguage, states that a “person convicted of a sex offense . . .\nmay become eligible, in accordance with a program devel-\noped by the department, for transfer to community custody\nstatus in lieu of earned release time.” WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(a). The only “explicitly mandatory language”\nin section 9.94A.728(2) concerns a procedural right to an\nindividualized determination based on the merits of a pro-\nposed release plan.8 That language cannot create a “liberty\ninterest” within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause “expectation of receiving process is not, without\nmore, a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause”\n   8\n     Subsection (2)(c) reads: “The department shall, as a part of its program\nfor release to the community in lieu of earned release, require the offender\nto propose a release plan that includes an approved residence and living\narrangement.” As the Washington Court of Appeals in In re Dutcher held,\nthis language, combined with language in subsection (2)(d), mandates that\nthe DOC make an individualized determination “based on the merits of a\nrelease plan.” 60 P.3d at 638. The DOC’s failure to provide such an evalu-\nation rendered unlawful its further detention of sex offenders without an\nindividualized determination, a statutory wrong for which the Washington\nRules of Appellate Procedure provide relief. See Wash. R. App. P. 16.4(a),\n(c)(2) (providing that “the appellate court will grant appropriate relief to\na petitioner if . . . the petitioner’s restraint is unlawful.”). Thus, Dutcher\nstands for the proposition that release plans may not be categorically\ndenied. It does not require that release plans be categorically approved.\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                           16655\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Olim v.

As noted above, section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) enumerates four criteria for evaluating the\ntransfer plan. The statute instructs that the DOC “may deny\ntransfer to community custody if” one or more of those\ncriteria are met. Id. (emphasis added). Far from setting forth\n“substantive predicates” under which the DOC must grant\ntransfer, the statute is silent regarding even precatory criteria\nfor granting transfer to community custody, specifying only\nwhen the DOC “may”—but need not10 — “deny.”\n\n   No particular words are necessary to create a liberty interest.11\nIf the section 9.94A.728(2)(d) criteria for denying transfer\nconstituted an exhaustive list of reasons for denial, the lan-\nguage would be effectively mandatory, giving rise to a pre-\n  9\n    Cashaw, like Dutcher, instead grounded the inmate’s right to challenge\nhis restraint because of procedural error in Washington Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 16.4.

LEHMAN\nsumption of transfer. Nothing in the statute, however,\nindicates that those four criteria are the sole reasons for which\nthe DOC may deny transfer.12 To the contrary: immediately\nfollowing the enumeration, the statute goes on to state that the\nDOC’s “authority under this section is independent of any\ncourt-ordered condition of sentence or statutory provision\nregarding conditions for community custody or community\nplacement.” WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(d). The stat-\nute’s manifest purpose, therefore, is to preserve to the DOC\nthe discretion to deny transfer in the event that it makes one\nof the four determinations, notwithstanding what other legal\nsources might otherwise require.\n\n  To convert this non obstante permissive clause, meant to\npreserve discretion in certain cases, into an expressio unius\nprovision that would limit discretion to all but those cases\nwould be to invert the very purpose for which this statute was\ndrafted.13 These statutes were enacted to protect the commu-\n  12\n      If, for example, the statute stated that DOC “may” deny transfer “only\nif” certain criteria are met or “unless” they are not, that might sufficiently\nlimit the discretion of the DOC to the point it creates an expectation of\nrelease. The distinction between “if” and “only if,” however, is not a mere\nquibble over vocabulary—it goes right to the heart of whether the criteria\nof section 9.94A.728(2)(d) are necessary or sufficient conditions for trans-\nfer, and therefore whether transfer is mandatory or entirely discretionary.\n“May . . . only if” would be effectively identical to “shall . . . unless”;\n“may . . . if” is not.\n   13\n      The canon of construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius stands\nfor the proposition that, when the legislature provides a list of related\nitems, it impliedly means to exclude other items not listed. See Norman\nJ. Singer, 2A Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47:23 (7th\ned. 2007). Such a result will obtain, however, only in the absence of evi-\ndence to the contrary. “The maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius is\nan aid to construction, not a rule of law.

In this case, the statement that\nsex offenders only “may” receive transfer, combined with the final sen-\ntence of the paragraph, make clear the permissive intent of the statute.\n\f                          CARVER v.

Carver’s record would cause any rea-\nsonably cautious state official to pause before authorizing\neven closely supervised release to the community. On the\nbasis of his prior record alone—even before this latest\nconviction—a Washington superior court found probable\ncause that Carver was a sexually violent predator. A forensic\npsychological examination had concluded that Carver was, in\nhis own words, “a civil commitment case”—that is, he was\nfound to meet the criteria of a sexually violent predator. Sec-\ntion 9.94A.728(2)(d) reserves discretion for DOC officials\nprecisely so they may deny release plans of prisoners like\nCarver who remain threats to the community.\n\n    [6] Our reading of section 9.94A.728(2)(d) is consistent\nwith the case law of the Washington state courts construing\nit.14 In the text of In re Liptrap, the Washington Court of\nAppeals noted that the statute “stat[es] reasons why the\ndepartment may deny a release plan,” 111 P.3d at 1232, but\nkept those “reasons” in the indefinite: they are just “reasons”\n—not the reasons, let alone the only reasons—for denial. Sim-\nilarly, In re Dutcher held simply that “the statute . . . requires\nDOC to base its community custody eligibility decisions on\nthe merits of the release plan,” 60 P.3d at 638, which is hardly\nto imply that section 9.94A.728(2)(d) provides the sole rubric\nby which those “merits” are to be evaluated.\n\n   [7] It is true that the cases cited above refer to a “limited\nliberty interest” held by prisoners in transfer to community\ncustody. Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231; see also Dutcher, 60 P.3d\nat 636 (describing a “limited but protected liberty interest” in\n  14\n    “Whether a state statute provides such a protectable entitlement\ndepends on the structure and language of the statute, as well as the state\ncourts’ interpretation of the scope of the interest.” Bergen v.

LEHMAN\ntransfer); Crowder, 985 P.2d at 945 (“The statutory right to\nearned early release creates a limited liberty interest requiring\nminimal due process.”). We must not be confused, however,\nby those decisions’ use of a Fourteenth Amendment term of\nart: those cases concerned only the procedural right to com-\npliance with individualized consideration on the merits of\nprisoners’ release plans, secured by Washington Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 16.4(a). Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1234; Dut-\ncher, 60 P.3d at 638. To the extent they contain dicta using\nthe same term, “liberty interest,” to refer to both a substantive\nright to transfer and a procedural right to consideration on the\nmerits, the most logical reading is that both derive from\nWashington law, and are hence of the same sub-constitutional\nnature. Regardless, those dicta provide no justification for dis-\nregarding the plain language of the statute.\n\n   Washington appellate courts have been careful to distin-\nguish between the state habeas relief available through per-\nsonal restraint petitions for violations of state law, and\npersonal restraint petitions to redress violations of a constitu-\ntional magnitude. The decisions in Dutcher, Crowder, and\nCashaw are examples of the former. In Cashaw, the Washing-\nton State Supreme Court explicitly rejected the lower court’s\nholding that the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board’s fail-\nure to follow mandatory parole procedures constituted an\ninfringement of Fourteenth Amendment Rights. 866 P.2d at\n12. Though it concluded that “the Board had violated its own\nprocedural rules for parolability hearings,” it specifically held\nit was error to conclude “this violation was of constitutional\nmagnitude.” Id. at 13. The cases that refer to a “limited liberty\ninterest” do not support Judge Reinhardt’s conclusion that\nstate law regarding community custody creates a liberty inter-\nest arising under the Constitution.\n\n   Washington courts have implied only one limit on the sub-\nstance of the DOC’s exercise of discretion: its reasons for\ndenial must be “legitimate.” Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1234; Crow-\nder, 985 P.2d at 946. But there is no indication that a reason\n\f                          CARVER v. LEHMAN                        16659\nmay acquire “legitimacy” only by its enumeration in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d). Indeed, every indication is to the contrary:\nIn re Crowder, the first case to imply a requirement of “legiti-\nmate reasons” for denial of transfer to community custody,\nspecified the petitioner’s “own withdrawal of a suggested\nplacement plan” as one of the “legitimate reasons” for deny-\ning him transfer, 985 P.2d at 946—a reason which certainly\nseems legitimate, but appears nowhere in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d).15 No Washington case has provided a gen-\neral definition for what makes a reason “legitimate,” which\ncould be as broad as “any reason having a rational basis,” or\neven “any reason not otherwise proscribed by law.” This ill-\ndefined “right” to transfer only in the absence of some “legiti-\nmate” reason to deny is hardly a sufficient “substantive predi-\ncate” to produce the “legitimate expectation of release”\nrequired of a protected liberty interest under Greenholtz. 442\nU.S. at 12.\n\n   [8] The analysis employed by the Washington courts in\nparole and community release cases confirms our conclusion\nthat section 9.94A.728(2)(d) does not create a liberty interest.\nDOC officials had legitimate concern that Carver, based on\nhis multiple sex convictions and behavior in prison, had not\npresented an acceptable release plan to alleviate the concern\nfor public safety. The Constitution requires no more.\n\n            Response to Preamble of Concurrence\n\n  We readily acknowledge the self-evident truth of Judge\nReinhardt’s observation that in our judicial system the out-\ncome of important appellate cases can vary based on the com-\nposition of the judicial body or panel deciding those cases. It\nhas been so ever since the founding of the Republic, and will\n  15\n    In re Crowder predated the enactment of section 9.94A.728(2)(d) by\nthree years. There is no indication in subsequent case law, however, that\ncodification of certain reasons in section 9.94A.728(2)(d) has somehow\nnarrowed the range of “legitimacy.”\n\f16660                     CARVER v. LEHMAN\ninevitably be so in the future so long as we are judged by\nhuman beings. We respectfully disagree, however, with much\nof the balance of our concurring friend’s preambular observa-\ntions about this case, and we feel it appropriate to respond.\n\n   We observe first that our concurring colleague saddled his\npoint to a rather weak horse. Releasing a potentially danger-\nous child molester who may readily reoffend does not fit well\nwithin his critical matrix for determining protectable liberty\ninterests, and certainly does not reach any “matters as basic\nas affirmative action, a woman’s right of choice, and the\nnature of religious liberty.” Concurrence at 16667.\n\n   Our colleague states that the “Constitution did not change\nbetween the time of the original panel’s decision and the time\nof the new majority’s opinion. All that changed is the compo-\nsition of the three-judge panel.” Concurrence at 16667. This\nimplies that the previous panel majority unearthed an unal-\nloyed constitutional nugget waiting to be discovered within\nthe primordial crust of the Fourteenth Amendment, but which\nmust now be reinterred and disregarded as a result of the pass-\ning of one of our colleagues. This implication ignores Judge\nReinhardt’s candid admission that “[t]he constitutional ques-\ntion is a close one, and substantial arguments can be made for\neither position.” Concurrence at 16667. It further disregards\nboth the rules of our court and the vicissitudes of life.\n\n   The respective corpora of the opinion and concurrence in\nthis case discuss the disputed nature of the constitutional\nquestion. But whatever the merits of each side’s constitutional\nanalysis, we respectfully disagree with Judge Reinhardt’s con-\ntention that the prior majority’s opinion actually became a\nbinding construction of the Constitution before Judge Fergu-\nson’s death. No opinion of this circuit becomes final until the\nmandate issues, and the opinion issued by the prior majority\nwas only part way through its finalization process.16 Just as\n  16\n    United States v.

We\nnote also that until the mandate has issued, opinions can be,\nand regularly are, amended or withdrawn, either at the request\nof the parties pursuant to a petition for panel rehearing, or sua\nsponte by the panel itself. For example, in the ninety days\nbetween July 11, 2008, and October 9, 2008, at least ten pub-\nlished opinions were withdrawn17 and at least ten opinions\nwere amended18 in our circuit.

This suggestion ignores the rules and\nfacts just cited, and also disregards the fact that an opinion,\nlike the one in this case, may not involve issues of a nature\nrequired to merit a rehearing en banc under our rules (e.g.\ndirect conflict with a published, binding opinion, or a “ques-\ntion of exceptional importance,” Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)), and\nyet may still be flawed and wanting correction.\n\n   We readily agree that only published opinions of the court\nare precedential, and that no court is bound by unpublished\ndispositions except when they are “relevant under the doctrine\nof law of the case or rules of claim preclusion or issue preclu-\nsion.” Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3(a). Unpublished dispositions\ncan also be properly cited in our court, whatever their value,\nwhen they were issued on or after January 1, 2007, Fed.

The case was docketed on March 2, 2006. On March\n22, 2007, Defendant-Appellant Carver sent a 28(j) letter to\nour panel identifying Chaney v. Lehman, 225 Fed. Appx. 708\n(9th Cir.

Interestingly,\nJudge Berzon did not require that the disposition in Chaney\nbe published, as was her right under Circuit Rule 36-2(g).\n\n   The previous panel in this case heard oral argument on\nApril 17, 2007, having been notified by the parties of the doc-\ntrinal relevance of Chaney. Knowing that before the mandate\nissues, a panel may decide to publish its previously unpub-\nlished opinion, grant a motion for panel rehearing, or that the\ncourt may grant a motion for rehearing en banc, the previous\npanel promptly issued an order stating “Submission of this\ncase is vacated pending issuance of the mandate in Chaney v.\nLehman, No. 05-36116.” Had Chaney been published, the\nopinion filed by the original panel in this case would have\nbeen foreclosed because the constitutional issue would have\nbeen decided in the same way as we now decide it, and, more-\nover, as indicated in its order, the previous majority properly\ntook this fact into consideration. The Chaney panel ultimately\nchose not to publish its opinion (perhaps because it felt that\nthe law was well enough understood in Washington State that\nit was unnecessary to do so), and so the previous panel major-\n\f                       CARVER v. LEHMAN                    16665\nity filed its opinion on June 9, 2008, some time after the man-\ndate issued in Chaney. In addition to the Chaney panel, one\nother panel of our court, and two district judges had also con-\nsidered the constitutional issue addressed in this case, and\neach had reached the same conclusion that we do here. See\nDutcher v. Lehman, No. 06-35043, 234 Fed. App’x 631 (9th\nCir. 2007); Duncan v.

Wash. Mar. 23,\n2006). Two weeks after the majority opinion was filed in this\ncase, on June 23, 2008, Defendants-Appellants filed a Petition\nfor Rehearing En Banc and Plaintiff-Appellee filed a Petition\nfor Panel Rehearing. Judge Ferguson died two days later, on\nJune 25, 2008, with the petitions for rehearing from all parties\npending, and the mandate in the case unissued. Pursuant to\nGeneral Order 3.2g, the Clerk of the Court drew Judge Tall-\nman as a replacement for Judge Ferguson on the panel, and\nan order to that effect was filed on July 25, 2008. On August\n26, 2008, an order was filed withdrawing the opinion filed on\nJune 9, 2008, and denying Plaintiff-Appellant’s Petition for\nRehearing and Defendants-Appellants’ Petition for Rehearing\nEn Banc as moot, since the new panel had voted to amend the\nprevious opinion.\n\n   [9] By any measure, the prior majority’s opinion purported\nto establish a new constitutional rule of law, because until its\nissuance, no federal or state court had found that Washington\nlaw created a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment mandating that a dangerous sex offender be\nreleased into community custody on the first eligible release\ntime date. The fact that prior rulings were not precedential,\nand thus did not bind other courts, does not change the fact\nthat they still applied the law as then understood. Indeed, we\nsuspect that the vast majority of federal and state statutes have\nnever been construed by courts, and yet they still have the\nforce of law, and are applied and construed by those governed\nby them unless and until a higher court changes or confirms\nthe prior understanding of the law in a precedential opinion.\n\f16666                  CARVER v. LEHMAN\nThus, in that sense, the prior majority’s opinion purported to\nchange existing law, and it is this amended opinion that\nrestores the law to the status quo ante, albeit in a precedential\ndecision that does bind other courts.\n\n                          Conclusion\n\n   [10] Because Washington law does not create a liberty\ninterest in transfer to community custody, we need not\naddress the sufficiency of the procedures given (or denied)\nCarver. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n  Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment\nonly:\n\n   Six months ago, the original panel in this case filed a\nmajority opinion holding that Washington state law creates a\nliberty interest in an inmate’s early release into community\ncustody. We held that the prisoner’s liberty interest is pro-\ntected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and that, accordingly, when an inmate becomes\neligible for a transfer to community custody, the prison\nauthorities may deny his request for a transfer only for one of\nthe reasons specified in the Washington statute — and only if\nhe is afforded a minimal opportunity to present his side of the\nstory before they do so. In short, we held that Washington\nprison authorities must follow Washington law and abide by\nthe United States Constitution. Joining me in that opinion was\nJudge Warren J. Ferguson, who died before we could deny the\npetition for rehearing; dissenting was Judge Milan Smith. As\na result of Judge Ferguson’s death, it was necessary to replace\nhim on this case with another member of this court drawn at\nrandom. There were no intervening decisions that changed the\nlaw between the time Judge Ferguson and I issued our opinion\n\f                        CARVER v. LEHMAN                    16667\nholding that a liberty interest exists that protects the prisoners’\nrights at issue and the time that Judge Smith, joined by our\ncolleague who replaced Judge Ferguson, issued a substitute\nopinion holding that no such liberty interest exists.\n\n   As stated above, it is indisputable that the law did not\nchange and the Constitution did not change between the time\nof the original panel’s decision and the time of the new major-\nity’s opinion. All that changed is the composition of the three-\njudge panel. To those who question whether the results in\nconstitutional and other cases depend on the membership of\nthe panel, or whether the replacement of even a single\nSupreme Court justice can change the fundamental nature of\nthe rights of all Americans with respect to matters as basic as\naffirmative action, a woman’s right of choice, and the nature\nof religious liberty, the result in the case currently before our\npanel is merely a minor illustration of how the judicial system\ncurrently operates. Solely because of fortuity, I am compelled\nto write in strong disagreement with the majority’s constitu-\ntional analysis instead of simply reaffirming an opinion vindi-\ncating the constitutional rights of the petitioner and his fellow\nprisoners in the state of Washington.\n\n   In the case before us, it is not necessary for the new major-\nity to undo the original majority’s constitutional ruling, even\nif it disagrees with it. The constitutional question is a close\none, and substantial arguments can be made for either posi-\ntion. Under these circumstances, the more important consider-\nation, in my view, is maintaining the stability and legitimacy\nof the court’s decisions. We have a procedure for correcting\ndecisions that a majority of the court believes warrant recon-\nsideration. That process is known as a en banc rehearing. It\ncan be invoked if any single judge on the court, including\neither member of the majority, elects to make a call. Relying\non this process would, in my view, be in the better interests\nof the court and the judicial system; increasing the extent to\n\f16668                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nwhich judicial decisions depend on chance and subjectivity is\nnot a wise alternative.1\n\n   Unfortunately, my colleagues, having read the above,\nincluding the footnote, have decided that it is necessary to\nrespond to this rather uncontroversial part of my concurrence.\nThey do so in a manner that misperceives the purpose and\ncontent of the three brief paragraphs.\n\n   It is true as Judge Smith points out that I chose to make my\nobservations in a case that does not involve a “matter[ ] as\nbasic as affirmative action, a woman’s right of choice, and the\nnature of religious liberty.” Maj. Op. at 16660 (quoting Con-\ncurrence at 16667). My choice was deliberate. It was made in\npart to show that judicial determinations of the law are subject\nto such vicissitudes not only in high-visibility cases but in\ncases involving all types of questions. I also chose the case\nbefore us so that our collegial discussion of how courts decide\nwhat the law shall be would be removed from the heat of\nemotional issues that sometimes cause judges to lose their\nobjectivity. To me, for these reasons this appeared to be the\nright case to engage in such a discussion, rather than, as my\ncolleagues believe, an inappropriate one. I can assure them,\nhowever, that I will shortly point to an example of the way\nour law is shaped by the replacement of one panel member by\nanother in a far more controversial case. As to the present\ncase, I remind my colleagues that we are not considering\nreleasing Carver here; he has already been released and is\nsimply suing for damages, which would be denied under my\n  1\n    I am aware that two non-precedential memorandum dispositions of this\ncourt have previously stated, in a cursory fashion, and without analysis,\nthat the Washington statute does not create a liberty interest. Footnote 15\nof the original majority opinion provides a full analysis of those decisions\nand shows clearly that the outcomes were not determined by the composi-\ntion of the panel but by the form and nature of the disposition. Surely, had\nthe members of those panels thought that they were resolving a serious\nconstitutional question they would not have done so in a non-precedential\nmemorandum disposition.\n\f                       CARVER v. LEHMAN                    16669\ntheory of the case as well as theirs. For my colleagues’ bene-\nfit, I should also state that I, of course, do not believe that I\nhave unearthed a “constitutional nugget,” Maj. Op. at 16660,\nalloyed or otherwise. This is simply a case in which Judge\nFerguson and I tried our best to do our job, including the\nmundane task of seeing that prisoners, like all other persons,\nare afforded the rights to which they are entitled under the\nlaw. I recognize that these days there are many who do not\nshare the view that prisoners’ rights deserve judicial protec-\ntion, but neither Judge Ferguson nor I was aware of any con-\nstitutional or statutory provision to that effect, except perhaps\nfor the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, 28\nU.S.C. §§ 2241 et seq.\n\n   Let me also make it clear that I have not suggested, nor do\nI believe, that Judge Smith and Judge Tallman do not have the\nauthority to withdraw the opinion filed by the initial panel and\npublished as the opinion of the court. Of course, they do. Nor\nhave I suggested that the opinion was “final”: I merely stated\nwhat I strongly believe — that it is unwise for a court, once\nit has published an opinion on a constitutional question, to\nchange its mind for so fortuitous and subjective a reason.\nRather, I suggested that a procedure exists under which we\ncould reach a different result through a more objective pro-\ncess in which the merits, not the composition of the panel,\nwould provide the basis for our action. I stated simply that\nproceeding in the latter manner would help to secure the legit-\nimacy of court decisions and, necessarily, to maintain public\nconfidence in the judicial system.\n\n   As to the majority’s lengthy disquisition on memorandum\ndispositions and published opinions, it should not be neces-\nsary for me to restate the obvious: The law is established in\npublished opinions and published opinions only. The Chaney\npanel, which declined to publish an opinion, was well aware\nthat the initial Carver panel was awaiting its decision and that\nwe would abide by its opinion if it chose to issue one. It\ndecided not to do so, thereby rejecting the opportunity to\n\f16670                        CARVER v. LEHMAN\ndefine the applicable law for the circuit. To say as the major-\nity now does, that despite the absence of a single circuit opin-\nion on an issue that has been presented to the court a number\nof times, there was “existing law” that Judge Ferguson and I\n“changed,” and that Judge Smith and Judge Tallman, by now\nreaching the diametrically opposite result are merely restoring\nour circuit law to the “status quo ante” is more than mind-\nboggling. If we were to accept this view, the law in this circuit\nwould no longer be declared in opinions; “existing” circuit\nlaw could be found in whatever sources suited anyone’s whim\nor fancy, including the Sewanee Law Review. What an odd\nlegal system we would be adopting for the Ninth Circuit —\none that would be operative in this court only. Surely my col-\nleagues cannot mean what their opinion states. Say it ain’t so,\nmy friends.2\n\n                        I.     Liberty Interest\n\n   As Judge Ferguson and I previously held, Washington’s\nstatutory scheme creates a protected liberty interest because it\nrequires the Department of Corrections (“DOC”) to transfer\nan inmate to community custody in lieu of earned release “un-\nless any one of the . . . specifically designated reasons are\nfound[,]” thereby “creat[ing] a presumption that . . . release\n[into community custody] will be granted, and . . . in turn\ncreat[ing] a legitimate expectation of release absent the requi-\nsite finding that one of the justifications for [denial] exists.”\nGreenholtz v.

The majority rejects this\nargument, finding no “ ‘explicitly mandatory language’ . . .\ncreating a substantive right to transfer to community custody”\nunder Washington law. Maj. Op. at 16654 (emphasis omit-\n  2\n    I would remind my colleagues that they are not simply seeking to make\ndebaters’ points here. Theirs is a majority opinion. They are therefore\nestablishing the law for the circuit, including the law with regard to what\nconstitutes controlling law.\n\f                           CARVER v. LEHMAN                          16671\nted). For the reasons set forth in our prior majority opinion\nand reiterated below, I believe that the current majority’s\nreading is flawed.\n\n   The Washington statutory scheme uses language that effec-\ntively mandates the transfer to community custody of those\ninmates who have earned release time and who have not been\nfound to meet one of the statutory reasons for denial of a\nrelease plan set forth in Washington Revised Code\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(d). Section 9.94A.710(1) requires that sex\noffenders be sentenced to a term of community custody to\nbegin either when the offender’s term of confinement is com-\nplete or when he is transferred as a result of earned release\ntime. Section 9.94A.728(1) likewise requires the DOC to\ndevelop and promulgate procedures by which a sex offender\nmay become eligible for transfer to community custody in\nlieu of earned release time. The same section then sets forth\nthe limited circumstances under which the Department “may\ndeny” an inmate’s proposed plan for transfer to community\ncustody. WASH. REV. CODE § 9.94A.728(2)(d) (listing as legit-\nimate reasons for denial, a DOC determination that the release\nplan may violate the conditions of the sentence or conditions\nof supervision, place the offender at risk to violate the condi-\ntions of the sentence, place the offender at risk to reoffend, or\npresent a risk to victim or community safety). By placing sub-\nstantive limitations on DOC’s discretion to deny release plans\nand, in particular, by requiring that denial of such plans be\nbased on the limited criteria contained in section\n9.94A.728(2)(d), Washington has created a liberty interest in\nearly release into community custody that is protected by the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.3 See\n  3\n    At oral argument, Lehman urged that the presence of more specific\ncriteria for denial of proposed residence locations in section\n72.09.340(3)(a) undermines Carver’s contention that the four criteria listed\nin section 9.94A.728(2)(d) provide the exclusive legitimate bases for\ndenial of a release plan. Lehman is incorrect: the bases for denial of pro-\nposed residence locations contained in section 72.09.340(3)(a) are, in\n\f16672                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nAllen, 482 U.S. at 375-76 (clarifying that a state may grant\n“significant discretion to the decisionmaker” to apply “gen-\neral or broad release criteria” without “depriv[ing] the pris-\noner of the liberty interest in parole[,]” so long as “release is\nrequired after the [decisionmaker] determines (in its broad\ndiscretion) that the necessary prerequisites exist”). See also\nBaumann, 754 F.2d at 844 (noting that “[a] state may create\na constitutionally protected liberty interest by establishing\nregulatory measures that impose substantive limitations on the\nexercise of official discretion”); Bergen v.

Section\n72.09.340(3)(a) provides:\n    [T]he department shall not approve a residence location if the\n    proposed residence: (I) Includes a minor victim or child of simi-\n    lar age or circumstance (as a previous victim who the department\n    determines may be put at substantial risk of harm by the offend-\n    er’s residence in the household; or (ii) is within close proximity\n    of the current residence of a minor victim, unless the where-\n    abouts of the minor victim cannot be determined or unless such\n    a restriction would impede family reunification efforts ordered by\n    the court or directed by the department of social and health ser-\n    vices.

See Allen, 482\nU.S. at 378 (rejecting the argument that a statute must contain\nthe “shall/unless” formula in order to create a liberty interest).\nAlthough we have accorded significance to the use of the term\n“shall” in assessing whether early release statutes create a lib-\nerty interest, we have never held that use of this term is\nrequired in order to satisfy the mandatory language rule set\nforth in Greenholtz and Allen. Nor does the majority so hold\ntoday. Maj. Op. at 16654. Despite the absence of the word\n“shall,” I conclude, as the prior majority did, that the language\nof section 9.94A.728(2)(d) is mandatory. Section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) provides that the department “may deny\ntransfer to community custody . . . if” any one of four criteria\nis met. By establishing criteria under which release may be\ndenied, section 9.94A.728(2)(d) creates the presumption that,\nabsent the existence of one of those criteria, release will be\ngranted. The repetition of the criteria, albeit in more specific\nform, in section 72.09.340(3)(a) and in Policy Directive\n350.200 confirms this understanding of the mandatory nature\nof the statute.\n\n   The “may deny . . . if” formula operates in precisely the\nsame manner and has precisely the same effect as a “shall\ngrant . . . unless” clause. Under the “may deny . . . if” for-\nmula, the provision sets forth the conditions under which the\nagency may deny release. Otherwise, it must grant it. This is\ndistinguishable from state statutes that provide that a decision-\nmaker “may grant . . . if” certain criteria are met. Under the\n“may grant . . . if” formula, the agency may only grant release\n\f16674                      CARVER v. LEHMAN\nif the relevant criteria are met, but it is not required to do so.4\nTherefore, under the “may deny . . . if” formula, as under a\n“shall grant . . . unless” clause, there is an expectation that\nrelease will be granted unless one of the specified conditions\nexists.\n\n   Judge Smith, who separately concurred in the original\nmajority opinion, remains unconvinced that the language of\nthe statutory scheme is mandatory. My colleague who\nreplaced Judge Ferguson agrees with him. But my reading is\nsupported by that of the Washington state courts. In interpret-\ning the statutory scheme governing early release into commu-\nnity custody, the state Court of Appeals has on two occasions\ndiscussed the mandatory nature of the law. First, in In re Dut-\ncher, an inmate similarly situated to Carver challenged the\nDOC’s failure to review his plan for release into community\ncustody pursuant to the Department’s policy of categorically\ndenying the plans of those offenders who appeared to be sexu-\nally violent predators and who were referred for civil commit-\nment. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580928\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580928/in-re-dutcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635-36 (Wash.

In Liptrap, inmates\nchallenged the DOC’s policy of refusing to review release\nplans of sex offenders until a forensic psychological evalua-\ntion had been completed. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2534090\"><a href=\"/opinion/2534090/in-re-personal-restraint-petition-of-liptrap/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1229 (Wash. Ct.\nApp. 2005). In finding that the Department’s policy violated\ninmates’ due process rights, the court explained that “[t]he\nprovisions in subsections [9.94A.728(2)] (c) and (d), spell[ ]\nout what is required in a release plan and stat[e] reasons why\nthe department may deny a release[.]” Id. at 1232 (emphasis\nadded). Accordingly, the Liptrap court found that “the depart-\nment [does not have] unlimited discretion to decide whether\nand when to consider an offender for transfer to community\ncustody.” Id. Rather, the DOC’s failure to “state[ ] a legiti-\nmate reason” for the denial of a release plan, the court con-\ncluded, “deprived [the inmates] of earned early release credits\nin violation of due process.” Id. at 1234 (emphasis added).5\nThis holding is consistent with my conclusion that Washing-\nton law requires that the DOC’s denial of a release plan be\nbased on a “legitimate reason,” and that such reasons are enu-\nmerated in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).6\n  5\n     The Liptrap court specifically noted section 72.09.340’s provision for\ndenial of a release plan because the proposed residence is near young chil-\ndren as a “legitimate statutory reason for disapproving a release plan for\na sex offender.” In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1233 & n.6 (citing WASH. REV.\nCODE § 72.09.340(3)). For the reasons set forth in footnote 3, supra, this\nprovision is simply a specific example of the more general bases for denial\nset forth in section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n   6\n     This provision goes on to state that “[t]he department’s authority under\nthis section is independent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or\nstatutory provision regarding conditions for community custody or com-\n\f16676                        CARVER v. LEHMAN\n   I conclude, then, as did the original panel majority, that the\nlanguage of the Washington statutory scheme, as supported\nby Washington case law, mandates the transfer to community\ncustody of those inmates who have earned release time and\nwho have not been found to meet one of the statutory reasons\nfor denial of a release, thereby creating a constitutionally-\nprotected liberty interest in the transfer. This conclusion is\nfurther supported by Washington state court decisions finding\na limited liberty interest in transfer to community custody in\nlieu of early release. The Washington Court of Appeals has\nconsistently found a “limited liberty interest in early release\ninto a community custody program . . . .” In re Crowder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1264817\"><a href=\"/opinion/1264817/in-re-crowder/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944-45 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999) (holding inmate had\nliberty interest in grant or denial of community custody place-\nment upon earning of early release, but that the minimum\nlevel of due process required to protect this interest was pro-\nvided). See also In re Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 636 (“An inmate’s\ninterest in his earned early release credits is a limited, but pro-\ntected, liberty interest.”); In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231(same).7\n\nmunity placement.” Wash. Rev. Code § 9.94A.728(2)(d). The majority\nargues that this sentence makes it clear that the function of section\n9.94A.728(2)(d) is “to preserve to the DOC the discretion to deny transfer\nin the event that it makes one of the four determinations, notwithstanding\nwhat other legal sources might otherwise require.”\nMaj. Op. at 16656. I do not disagree. The fact that the provision permits\nthe DOC to deny release even where other legal sources would allow for\nit is irrelevant, however, to the question at hand: regardless of other legal\nsources, does the statute itself place substantive limits on the DOC’s exer-\ncise of discretion? As I explained supra, the provision’s preservation to\nthe DOC of discretion to deny transfer only “in the event that it makes one\nof the four determinations[,]” is precisely the type of substantive limitation\nthat gives rise to the liberty interest asserted here.\n   7\n     The majority contends that I read too much into the use of the word\n“liberty interest” in these cases. It first argues that the liberty interest rec-\nognized by the Washington Court of Appeals is merely procedural, rather\nthan substantive, in nature. Maj. Op. at 16658 (“[T]hose cases concerned\nonly the procedural right to compliance with individualized consideration\n\f                            CARVER v. LEHMAN                           16677\n   In sum, I would hold once again that the Washington statu-\ntory scheme governing transfer to community custody of\nthose inmates who have earned early release time creates a\nliberty interest that is protected under the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Having found this liberty\ninterest, I would, like the original panel, go a step beyond the\ncurrent majority and consider “whether the procedures atten-\ndant upon th[e] deprivation [of Carver’s liberty interest] were\nconstitutionally sufficient[.]” Kentucky Dept. of Corrections\nv. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112260\"><a href=\"/opinion/112260/kentucky-dept-of-corrections-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1989). Carver’s release plan\nwas denied under a categorical policy that provided him with\nno process at all; it simply rejected all plans of offenders who,\nlike Carver, appeared to fall under the definition of a sexually\nviolent predator and who were referred for civil commitment.\nAccordingly, the complete absence of procedures deprived\n\non the merits of prisoners’ release plans . . . .”). To the contrary, the Wash-\nington court explained: “An inmate’s interest in his earned early release\ncredits is a limited, but protected, liberty interest. Likewise, the depart-\nment’s compliance with requirements of statutes affecting his release is a\nprotected liberty interest.” See In re Liptrap, 111 P.3d at 1231 (quoting In\nre Dutcher, 60 P.3d at 636) (emphasis added). As this language makes\nclear, the Washington court recognizes a liberty interest in both the sub-\nstantive right to earned early release (here, in the form of transfer to com-\nmunity custody) and the distinct procedural right to have the DOC comply\nwith the requirements of the statutes governing such release.\n   The majority next suggests that “To the extent [the Washington deci-\nsions] contain dicta using the same term, ‘liberty interest,’ to refer to both\na substantive right to transfer and a procedural right to consideration on\nthe merits, the most logical reading is that both derive from Washington\nlaw, and are hence of the same sub-constitutional nature.” Maj. Op. at\n16658. That the Washington court had the federal Due Process Clause—\nand not a sub-constitutional right—in mind when analyzing section\n9.94A.728(2) is, again, evidenced by the plain language of its decision in\nLiptrap, where the court framed its discussion of the interest at stake in\nthe familiar terms of federal due process jurisprudence. See In re Liptrap,\n111 P.3d at 1231 (explaining that “[d]ue process protects against the depri-\nvation of life, liberty, or property” and finding that “[a]n inmate’s interest\nin his earned early release credits is a limited, but protected, liberty inter-\nest”).\n\f16678                   CARVER v. LEHMAN\nCarver of his liberty interest in transfer to community custody\nwithout due process of law.\n\n   Finally, I would note that the majority’s analysis of whether\nCarver presents a danger to the community is entirely beside\nthe point. That is not a question for this court. Whether the\nprison officials followed the law is. Equally important, the\nfact that the statute creates a liberty interest does not mean\nthat it does not also serve the purpose of protecting the com-\nmunity. The majority states that the purpose of the statute is\nto provide “discretion for DOC officials precisely so they may\ndeny release plans of prisoners like Carver who remain threats\nto the community.” Maj. Op. at 16657. But in establishing a\nliberty interest, the Washington statute did not ignore legiti-\nmate concerns about the safety of the community. Indeed,\namong the four permissible reasons for denying transfer into\ncommunity custody are whether such transfer would “place\nthe offender at risk to reoffend, or present a risk to victim\nsafety or community safety.” WASH. REV. CODE\n§ 9.94A.728(2)(d). This threat to the community, however,\nmust be established through a proper procedure in order to\njustify the deprivation of the inmate’s liberty interest; it is not\nsimply left to the unbridled discretion of the DOC. The point,\nthen, is that inmates have a constitutionally-protected liberty\ninterest in release to community custody such that when the\nDOC denies release, it must do so for one of the statutorily-\nenumerated reasons, and it must do so pursuant to proper pro-\ncedures. Here, neither requirement was met. The prison offi-\ncials simply ignored the statutory requirements and\ncategorically denied all prisoners like Carver the release to\nwhich they may have been entitled. Thus, Carver and others\nwere denied their due process rights. Let me make it abso-\nlutely clear, I do not contend that Carver was entitled to\nrelease. He may well not have been. On this record, however,\nwe cannot know. Had the DOC followed the procedures pro-\nvided by statute, and had it found that Carver’s release “pre-\nsent[ed] a risk to community safety,” the prison authorities\ncould well have retained him in custody. Following the law\n\f                        CARVER v. LEHMAN                   16679\nis not that difficult, and we are entitled to expect no less from\nour officials, prison or otherwise.\n\n                  II.   Qualified Immunity\n\n   Although unlike the current majority I conclude that Carver\nwas deprived of a liberty interest, I would as did the original\nmajority affirm the district court’s finding of qualified immu-\nnity and therefore concur in the current majority’s judgment.\n\n   Qualified immunity protects “government officials . . .\nfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does\nnot violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\nof which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (1982). The qualified immunity\nanalysis proceeds in two parts. First, we consider whether\n“the facts alleged show that [Lehman’s] conduct violated a\nconstitutional right[.]” Galen, 477 F.3d at 658-59 (citing Sau-\ncier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200-02 (2001)). For the reasons\ndiscussed above, I would answer this question in the affirma-\ntive. Second, we ask if “the right [Lehman is] alleged to have\nviolated [was] clearly established such that a reasonable [offi-\ncial] would have understood that he was violating that\nright[.]” Id. I conclude that the answer to this question is no.\n\n   In determining whether the right alleged to have been vio-\nlated was clearly established, we must consider the right “in\nlight of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general\nproposition[.]” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201. “ ‘The contours of\nthe right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official\nwould understand that what he is doing violates that right.’ ”\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 202 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (1987)). Here, because section 9.94A.728(2)(d)\ndoes not use the more common mandatory term “shall,” a rea-\nsonable correctional official might not have understood that\nthe Washington statutory scheme created a liberty interest in\nearly release into community custody. Certainly, the question\nwas highly debatable at the time that Lehman was required to\n\f16680                  CARVER v. LEHMAN\nact. Carver’s plan was denied before the Washington Court of\nAppeals had issued its decisions in Dutcher and Liptrap,\nwhich clarified that not only does a limited liberty interest\nexist under state law, but that the DOC’s discretion to deny\nrelease into community custody is limited to rejection of a\nplan on the basis of the legitimate statutory criteria set forth\nin section 9.94A.728(2)(d).\n\n   Because I conclude, as did the original majority, that the\nright at issue here was not sufficiently clear at the time of the\nfacts giving rise to this case such that a reasonable official\nwould understand that denying a release plan without provid-\ning a legitimate statutory reason for that denial would violate\ndue process, I would once again affirm the district court’s\ngrant of qualified immunity.\n\n                       III.   Conclusion\n\n   Washington state law creates a liberty interest in an\ninmate’s early release into community custody that is pro-\ntected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Carver was denied his due process right by the\nstate officials’ refusal to approve his release plan without\nreviewing it on its merits. At the time, however, the due pro-\ncess right arising from the existence of his liberty interest was\nnot sufficiently clearly established to meet the Saucier stan-\ndard. Because I would affirm the district court’s determina-\ntion that Lehman is entitled to qualified immunity, I therefore\nconcur in the majority’s judgment, but I respectfully disagree\nwith its reasoning.\n\f</pre>",
