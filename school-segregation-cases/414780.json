JONES, Circuit Judge:\n\n          The question posed in this case is whether a tort claim for physical injury based on an unsafe\n\ncondition in an airplane is preempted by § 1305 of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Bound by\n\na previous unpublished opinion of this court, we must hold that it is. Baugh v. Trans World Airlines,\n\nInc., 915 F.2d 693 (1990). The panel believes this is the wrong result and urges en banc review.\n\n          During a flight from the Caribbean to Miami, a fellow passenger opened the overhead\n\ncompartment directly above Frances Hodges, dislodging and spilling a case containing several bottles\n\nof rum. The box fell on Hodges and lacerated her left arm and wrist. Befo Ho dges's profuse\n                                                                        re\n\nbleeding was brought under control, a significant amount of her blood mingled in the aisle with the\n\npuddle of rum and broken glass.\n\n          Hodges filed suit in federal court, complaining that Delta Airlines's negligence caused her\n\ninjury and pain and high medical expenses. Delta argued successfully before the district court that\n\nHodges's claims are preempted by section 1305 of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 49\n\nU.S.C.App. §§ 1301 et seq., and that the ADA contains no implied private right of action. We review\n\nthe district court's consequent granting of a summary judgment de novo. If the panel were to decide\n\nthe issue in the first instance, we would decide that there was no ADA preemption of this bodily\n\ninjury tort case.

City of Chicago, 864 F.2d 463, 471 (7th Cir.1988). More recently,\n\nhowever, the airlines have begun to argue that various state-law tort claims are expressly preempted\n\nby section 1305, especially in the wake of Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 112\n\nS.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992).\n\n        State law is displaced by federal law under the supremacy clause where (1) Congress\n\nexpressly preempts state law;2 (2) congressional intent to preempt is inferred from the existence of\n\na pervasive federal regulatory scheme;3 or (3) state law conflicts with federal law or interferes with\n\nthe achievement of congressional objectives.4 \"[T]he question whether a certain state action is\n\npre-empted by federal law is one of Congressional intent. \"The purpose of Congress is the ultimate\n\n   1\n     In Schwamb v.

We begin with the language of the\n\nstatute.\n\n           In evaluating the scope of § 1305(a) preemption, one must bear in mind its origin in the ADA,\n\nan economic deregulation statute. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FAA), 72 Stat. 731, 49\n\nU.S.C.App. § 1301 et seq. (as amended), conferred on the Civil Aeronautics Board economic\n\nregulatory authority over interstate air transportation. The FAA did not expressly preempt state\n\nregulation of intrastate air transportation. In 1978, Congress amended the FAA after determining that\n\nefficiency, innovation, low prices, variety, and quality would be best furthered by reliance on\n\ncompetitive market forces in the airline industry. Congress enacted the ADA to dismantle the\n\npervasive federal economic regulation of the interstate airline industry. To prevent the states from\n\nfrustrating the goals of federal deregulation by establishing or maintaining economic regulations of\n\ntheir own, Congress included in the ADA section 1305, which preempts the states from enforcing any\n\nlaw \"relating to rates, routes, or services\" of any air carrier. Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at\n\n2034.\n\n           Morales informs but does not squarely resolve this case. In Morales, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat the attempts of several st ate attorneys general to enforce state laws prohibiting deceptive\n\nadvertising by the airlines were preempted by § 1305(a). Morales first drew upon the broad\n\nconstruction of the phrase \"relating to\" in the ERISA cases.6 Thus, the phrase \"relating to\" means\n\n\"to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association\n\nwith or connection with.\" Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2037 (quoti ng Black's Law\n\nDictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)). Consequently, \"state enforcement actions having a connection with\n\n   5\n     Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 45, 107 S.Ct. at 1552 (quoting Allis-Chalmers Corp. v.

White Motor\nCorp., 435 U.S. 497, 504, 98 S.Ct. 1185, 1189, 55 L.Ed.2d 443 (1978) (quoting Retail Clerks\nInt'l Ass'n v.

This language is \"expansive,\" Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux,\n481 U.S. 41, 47, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 1552-53, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987), and \"broadly worded,\"\nIngersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 137-40, 111 S.Ct. 478, 482-83, 112 L.Ed.2d\n474 (1990).\n\for reference to airline \"rates, routes, or services' are preempted\" under section 1305. Id.\n\n        As a necessary consequence of its broad interpretation, the Court rejected the argument that\n\nsection 1305 preempts the states only from actually prescribing rates, routes, or services. --- U.S.\n\nat ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2037-38. The Court also rejected the notions that \"only state laws\n\nspecifically addressed to the airline industry are preempted\" and that \"preemption is inappropriate\n\nwhen state and federal law are consistent.\" Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2038. Laws of\n\ngeneral applicability, even those consistent with federal law, are preempted if they have \"the forbidden\n\nsignificant effect\" on rates, routes or services. --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2039.\n\n        Morales acknowledged, however, that \"[s]ome state actions may affect [airline services] in\n\ntoo tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner\" to have preemptive effect. Morales, --- U.S. at ----,\n\n112 S.Ct. at 2040 (quoting Shaw, 463 U.S. at 100 n. 21, 103 S.Ct. at 2901 n. 21). Refusing to state\n\nexactly where the line would be drawn in a close case, the Court observed that the facts before it\n\npresented no close question of the connection between the regulation and air fares.\n\n        While under Morales the scope of state laws that \"relate to\" services must be broadly\n\ninterpreted, the nature of the \"services\" preempted by § 1305(a) is more narrow than might at first\n\nbe supposed. Hodges contends that \"services\" must be so narrowly interpreted as to preempt no\n\ncommon law tort or negligence cause of action. Delta argues the contrary, citing a dictionary\n\ndefinition of \"services\" as \"useful labor that does not produce a tangible commodity.\" Webster's\n\nNinth New Collegiate Dictionary 1076 (1990). We do not agree completely with either position.\n\n        Considering the definition of \"services\" that is most plausible in light of the ADA's purpose\n\nand historical regulatory antecedents, it appears that \"services\" is not coextensive with airline\n\n\"safety\". Therefore, insofar as state law or regulation imposes liability on airlines for breaching tort\n\nduties related to the safety of persons, it should not be preempted by § 1305(a).7 The intent of this\n\ndistinction is to secure by federal preemption the benefits of economic deregulation of the airline\n\n   7\n    This ruling intimates no opinion concerning the possible preemptive effect of FAA safety\nregulation of aircraft and carriers. See Public Health Trust of Dade Cty., Fla. v. Lake Aircraft,\nInc., 992 F.2d 291 (11th Cir.1993). No such issue has been presented in this case. We also have\nno occasion to decide here whether and to what extent property damage claims are preempted by\n§ 1305.\n\findustry, while maintaining the traditional role of state law in adjudicating bodily injury claims.\n\n         Carefully read, neither Delta's definition of \"services\" nor others in the dictionary are\n\nopen-ended. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1976) adds some of the following\n\ndefinitions:\n\n        An action or use that furthers some purpose; supply of needs [e.g., a vending machine for the\n        service of passersby]; railroads and telephone companies produce services—useful labor that\n        does not produce a good; provision for conducting a public utility [e.g., air freight service\n        ]; regularly scheduled trip on public transportation ( [free air services ] ).\n\n\"Services\" generally represent a bargained-for or anticipated provision of labor from one party to\n\nanother. If the element of bargain or agreement is incorporated in our understanding of services, it\n\nleads to a concern with the contractual arrangement between the airline and the user of the service.\n\nElements of the air carrier service bargain include items such as ticketing, boarding procedures,\n\nprovision of food and drink, and baggage handling, in addition to the transportation itself. These\n\nmatters are all appurtenant and necessarily included with the contract of carriage between the\n\npassenger or shipper and the airline. It is these features of air transportation that we believe Congress\n\nintended to de-regulate as \"services\" and broadly to protect from state regulation.\n\n        This definition of services is consistent with congressional intent regarding the ADA, with the\n\nCAB's understanding of the ADA, and with other sections of the statute. Significantly, neither the\n\nADA nor its legislative history indicates that Congress intended to preempt the application of general\n\ntort law to personal physical injury inflicted by an airline while providing its services, or that Congress\n\neven considered such preemption.8 \"This silence takes on added significance in light of Congress's\n\nfailure to provide any federal remedy for persons injured by such conduct. It is difficult to believe\n\nthat Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by\n\nillegal conduct.\"9\n\n        The CAB's statements implementing the ADA strongly support our view that the ADA was\n\n   8\n    Compare the ADA with ERISA legislation, in which Congress provided several federal causes\nof action to replace the preempted state causes. See Pilot Light, 481 U.S. at 43-44, 107 S.Ct. at\n1551.\n   9\n   Silkwood, 464 U.S. at 251, 104 S.Ct. at 623 (citing United Constr. Workers v. Laburnum\nConstr. Corp., 347 U.S. 656, 663-64, 74 S.Ct. 833, 836-38, 98 L.Ed. 1025 (1954)).\n\fconcerned solely with economic, not safety deregulation. The Board concluded that\n\n          preemption extends to all of the economic factors that go into the provision of the quid pro\n          quo for passenger's [sic] fare, including flight frequency and timing, liability limits, reservation\n          and boarding practices, insurance, smoking rules, meal service, entertainment, [and] bonding\n          and corporate financing.10\n\nFollowing passage of the ADA, the CAB took the position that the states are preempted from\n\nregulating the kinds and amounts of insurance that carriers are required to have,11 but Department\n\nof Transportation regulations continue to require that airlines maintain insurance \"for bodily injury\n\nto or death of a person, or for damage to property of others, resulting from the carrier's operation or\n\nmaintenance of the aircraft in air transportation provided under its authority from the Board.\"12 If\n\nliability for personal injuries were preempted, such insurance would hardly be necessary, because\n\nthere is no federal compensation scheme for injuries to airline passengers.\n\n          That Congress did not intend section 1305 to preempt all state tort claims for personal injury\n\nis bolstered by the continued existence of the preemption saving clause. Section 1506 of the FAA\n\nprovides that \"[n]othing ... in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing\n\nat common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.\" 49\n\nU.S.C.App. § 1506. Before the ADA, this section permitted not only limited economic regulation\n\nof intrastate flights, but also enabled the states to enforce their own general laws against the airlines.13\n\n   10\n        44 Fed.Reg. 9948, 9951 (Feb. 15, 1979). The CAB also opined:\n\n                  [A] state may not interfere with the services that carriers offer in exchange for their\n                  rates and fares. For example, liquidated damages for bumping (denial of\n                  boarding), segregation of smoking passengers, minimum liability for loss, damages\n                  and delayed baggage, and ancillary charges for headsets, alcoholic beverages,\n                  entertainment, and excess baggage would clearly be \"service\" regulation within the\n                  meaning of section 105.\n\n          Id.\n   11\n     Immediately after the promulgation of the ADA, the CAB realized that the transition from\nstate to federal regulation would take time. Liability insurance rules varied among the states. As\nan interim rule the Board adopted as their own the existing state regulations on minimum liability\ninsurance. See id.\n   12\n        14 C.F.R. § 205.5(a) (1992).\n   13\n    See Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 426 U.S. 290, 300, 96 S.Ct. 1978, 1985, 48 L.Ed.2d\n643 (1976).\n\fAfter the passage of the ADA, the preemptive reach of section 1305(a) has curtailed the saving power\n\nof section 1506,14 but since Congress left that section intact, we cannot assume that Congress meant\n\ncompletely to undermine the saving clause.\n\n          Finally, unlike the NAAG Guidelines in Morales, enforcement of tort remedies for personal\n\nphysical injury ordinarily has no \"express reference\" to services as defined above. See Morales, ---\n\nU.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2039. Consequently, enforcement of such tort duties normally will not have\n\n\"the forbidden significant effect\" on airline services. Id. Morales relied in part on the fact that the\n\nstate restrictions on airfare advertising had a significant economic effect on fares. Generally,\n\nhowever, state tort laws concerning safety can be enforced consistently with and distinctly from the\n\nservices that Congress deregulated.\n\n          Unfortunately, the result this panel advocates cannot be squared with a previous unpublished\n\nopinion of our court in Baugh v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 915 F.2d 693 (1990). There, the court\n\naffirmed the dismissal of a passenger's claim that during a flight from Houston to New York, a\n\nstewardess stomped on her foot and injured her. This court reasoned that the manner in which a\n\nflight attendant performs her work \"arises out of the services\" afforded passengers by TWA and is\n\ntherefore preempted by § 1305. Baugh is inconsistent with the present case, because negligently\n\nstomping on a passenger's foot bears on passenger safety but only tenuously relates to the airline's\n\nservices. We are bound by Baugh. This circuit has considered its unpublished opinions to be binding\n\nprecedent, although we discourage their citation. Fifth Circuit Local Rule 47.5.3.\n\n          Even if Baugh did not appear to control this case, our vindication of airline safety claims\n\nunder state law would not extend to all state tort claims. To permit any tort suit to be filed simply\n\nbecause it is plausible under state law could conflict with the deregulation of \"rates, routes and\n\nservices.\" Two examples of preemption will suffice. In O'Carroll v. American Airlines, Inc., 863\n\nF.2d 11 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1106, 109 S.Ct. 3158, 104 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1989), the\n\nplaintiff and his cousin were removed from a commercial airline flight because they were loud,\n\nboisterous, and intoxicated. 863 F.2d at 12. O'Carroll sued, alleging that he was wrongfully evicted\n\n   14\n        See Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2034.\n\ffrom the flight. This court vacated O'Carroll's sizeable jury verdict, holding that his state law claims\n\nwere preempted by section 1305. In O'Carroll, we did not discuss the scope of section 1305 because\n\nthe state law claims arising from the alleged wro ngful exclusion undeniably related to the services\n\nprovided by the airline. Enforcement of O'Carroll's state law claims would result in significant de\n\nfacto regulation of the airlines' boarding practices and, moreover, would interfere with the\n\nimplementation of federal regulations granting the airlines substantial discretion in this matter.\n\n       Similarly, if we applied § 1305 unencumbered by Baugh, the tort and contract claims asserted\n\nby the plaintiff in West v. Northwest Airlines, 995 F.2d 148 (9th Cir.1993) would be preempted under\n\nour interpretation of \"services\". Plaintiff West sued after he was \"bumped\" from the overbooked\n\nairline flight for which he had reserved a seat. After remand for reconsideration in light of Morales,\n\nthe Ninth Circuit held, over a dissent, that West's state law claims were too tenuously connected to\n\n\"rates, routes and services\" to be preempted by § 1305. The majority did find West's punitive damage\n\nclaim preempted. Under either Morales or the analysis we would prefer, it is difficult to see how a\n\nlawsuit for overbooking would not \"relate to\" airline \"services.\"\n\n                                         HODGES' CLAIMS\n\n        Hodges alleged that Delta was negligent in allowing the case of rum to be stowed in the\n\noverhead st orage bin. This tort claim for personal injury has no specific \"reference to\" airline\n\nservices. See Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2039; Shaw, 463 U.S. at 97, 103 S.Ct. at 2900.\n\nNor would enforcement of her claim significantly affect Delta's services, as defined above. As other\n\ncases have recently held, this type of claim does not relate to Delta's services and is not preempted\n\nby section 1305. See Public Health Trust of Dade Cty., Fla., v. Lake Aircraft, Inc., 992 F.2d 291\n\n(11th Cir.1993); Margolis v. United Airlines, Inc., 811 F.Supp. 318 (E.D.Mich.1993).\n\n       Nevertheless, under Baugh, we are compelled to affirm and to suggest en banc review.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\f",

We begin with the language of the\n\nstatute.\n\n           In evaluating the scope of § 1305(a) preemption, one must bear in mind its origin in the ADA,\n\nan economic deregulation statute. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FAA), 72 Stat. 731, 49\n\nU.S.C.App. § 1301 et seq. (as amended), conferred on the Civil Aeronautics Board economic\n\nregulatory authority over interstate air transportation. The FAA did not expressly preempt state\n\nregulation of intrastate air transportation. In 1978, Congress amended the FAA after determining that\n\nefficiency, innovation, low prices, variety, and quality would be best furthered by reliance on\n\ncompetitive market forces in the airline industry. Congress enacted the ADA to dismantle the\n\npervasive federal economic regulation of the interstate airline industry. To prevent the states from\n\nfrustrating the goals of federal deregulation by establishing or maintaining economic regulations of\n\ntheir own, Congress included in the ADA section 1305, which preempts the states from enforcing any\n\nlaw \"relating to rates, routes, or services\" of any air carrier. Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at\n\n2034.\n\n           Morales informs but does not squarely resolve this case. In Morales, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat the attempts of several st ate attorneys general to enforce state laws prohibiting deceptive\n\nadvertising by the airlines were preempted by § 1305(a). Morales first drew upon the broad\n\nconstruction of the phrase \"relating to\" in the ERISA cases.6 Thus, the phrase \"relating to\" means\n\n\"to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association\n\nwith or connection with.\" Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2037 (quoti ng Black's Law\n\nDictionary 1158 (5th ed. 1979)).

Id.\n\n        As a necessary consequence of its broad interpretation, the Court rejected the argument that\n\nsection 1305 preempts the states only from actually prescribing rates, routes, or services. --- U.S.\n\nat ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2037-38. The Court also rejected the notions that \"only state laws\n\nspecifically addressed to the airline industry are preempted\" and that \"preemption is inappropriate\n\nwhen state and federal law are consistent.\" Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2038. Laws of\n\ngeneral applicability, even those consistent with federal law, are preempted if they have \"the forbidden\n\nsignificant effect\" on rates, routes or services. --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2039.\n\n        Morales acknowledged, however, that \"[s]ome state actions may affect [airline services] in\n\ntoo tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner\" to have preemptive effect. Morales, --- U.S. at ----,\n\n112 S.Ct. at 2040 (quoting Shaw, 463 U.S. at 100 n. 21, 103 S.Ct. at 2901 n. 21). Refusing to state\n\nexactly where the line would be drawn in a close case, the Court observed that the facts before it\n\npresented no close question of the connection between the regulation and air fares.\n\n        While under Morales the scope of state laws that \"relate to\" services must be broadly\n\ninterpreted, the nature of the \"services\" preempted by § 1305(a) is more narrow than might at first\n\nbe supposed. Hodges contends that \"services\" must be so narrowly interpreted as to preempt no\n\ncommon law tort or negligence cause of action. Delta argues the contrary, citing a dictionary\n\ndefinition of \"services\" as \"useful labor that does not produce a tangible commodity.\" Webster's\n\nNinth New Collegiate Dictionary 1076 (1990). We do not agree completely with either position.\n\n        Considering the definition of \"services\" that is most plausible in light of the ADA's purpose\n\nand historical regulatory antecedents, it appears that \"services\" is not coextensive with airline\n\n\"safety\". Therefore, insofar as state law or regulation imposes liability on airlines for breaching tort\n\nduties related to the safety of persons, it should not be preempted by § 1305(a).7 The intent of this\n\ndistinction is to secure by federal preemption the benefits of economic deregulation of the airline\n\n   7\n    This ruling intimates no opinion concerning the possible preemptive effect of FAA safety\nregulation of aircraft and carriers. See Public Health Trust of Dade Cty., Fla. v. Lake Aircraft,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605688\"><a href=\"/opinion/605688/the-public-health-trust-of-dade-county-florida-dba-jackson-memorial/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1993). No such issue has been presented in this case. We also have\nno occasion to decide here whether and to what extent property damage claims are preempted by\n§ 1305.\n\findustry, while maintaining the traditional role of state law in adjudicating bodily injury claims.\n\n         Carefully read, neither Delta's definition of \"services\" nor others in the dictionary are\n\nopen-ended. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1976) adds some of the following\n\ndefinitions:\n\n        An action or use that furthers some purpose; supply of needs [e.g., a vending machine for the\n        service of passersby]; railroads and telephone companies produce services—useful labor that\n        does not produce a good; provision for conducting a public utility [e.g., air freight service\n        ]; regularly scheduled trip on public transportation ( [free air services ] ).\n\n\"Services\" generally represent a bargained-for or anticipated provision of labor from one party to\n\nanother. If the element of bargain or agreement is incorporated in our understanding of services, it\n\nleads to a concern with the contractual arrangement between the airline and the user of the service.\n\nElements of the air carrier service bargain include items such as ticketing, boarding procedures,\n\nprovision of food and drink, and baggage handling, in addition to the transportation itself. These\n\nmatters are all appurtenant and necessarily included with the contract of carriage between the\n\npassenger or shipper and the airline. It is these features of air transportation that we believe Congress\n\nintended to de-regulate as \"services\" and broadly to protect from state regulation.\n\n        This definition of services is consistent with congressional intent regarding the ADA, with the\n\nCAB's understanding of the ADA, and with other sections of the statute. Significantly, neither the\n\nADA nor its legislative history indicates that Congress intended to preempt the application of general\n\ntort law to personal physical injury inflicted by an airline while providing its services, or that Congress\n\neven considered such preemption.8 \"This silence takes on added significance in light of Congress's\n\nfailure to provide any federal remedy for persons injured by such conduct. It is difficult to believe\n\nthat Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by\n\nillegal conduct.\"9\n\n        The CAB's statements implementing the ADA strongly support our view that the ADA was\n\n   8\n    Compare the ADA with ERISA legislation, in which Congress provided several federal causes\nof action to replace the preempted state causes.

The Board concluded that\n\n          preemption extends to all of the economic factors that go into the provision of the quid pro\n          quo for passenger's [sic] fare, including flight frequency and timing, liability limits, reservation\n          and boarding practices, insurance, smoking rules, meal service, entertainment, [and] bonding\n          and corporate financing.10\n\nFollowing passage of the ADA, the CAB took the position that the states are preempted from\n\nregulating the kinds and amounts of insurance that carriers are required to have,11 but Department\n\nof Transportation regulations continue to require that airlines maintain insurance \"for bodily injury\n\nto or death of a person, or for damage to property of others, resulting from the carrier's operation or\n\nmaintenance of the aircraft in air transportation provided under its authority from the Board.\"12 If\n\nliability for personal injuries were preempted, such insurance would hardly be necessary, because\n\nthere is no federal compensation scheme for injuries to airline passengers.\n\n          That Congress did not intend section 1305 to preempt all state tort claims for personal injury\n\nis bolstered by the continued existence of the preemption saving clause. Section 1506 of the FAA\n\nprovides that \"[n]othing ... in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing\n\nat common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.\" 49\n\nU.S.C.App. § 1506. Before the ADA, this section permitted not only limited economic regulation\n\nof intrastate flights, but also enabled the states to enforce their own general laws against the airlines.13\n\n   10\n        44 Fed.Reg. 9948, 9951 (Feb. 15, 1979). The CAB also opined:\n\n                  [A] state may not interfere with the services that carriers offer in exchange for their\n                  rates and fares. For example, liquidated damages for bumping (denial of\n                  boarding), segregation of smoking passengers, minimum liability for loss, damages\n                  and delayed baggage, and ancillary charges for headsets, alcoholic beverages,\n                  entertainment, and excess baggage would clearly be \"service\" regulation within the\n                  meaning of section 105.\n\n          Id.\n   11\n     Immediately after the promulgation of the ADA, the CAB realized that the transition from\nstate to federal regulation would take time. Liability insurance rules varied among the states. As\nan interim rule the Board adopted as their own the existing state regulations on minimum liability\ninsurance. See id.\n   12\n        14 C.F.R. § 205.5(a) (1992).\n   13\n    See Nader v.

See Morales, ---\n\nU.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2039. Consequently, enforcement of such tort duties normally will not have\n\n\"the forbidden significant effect\" on airline services. Id. Morales relied in part on the fact that the\n\nstate restrictions on airfare advertising had a significant economic effect on fares. Generally,\n\nhowever, state tort laws concerning safety can be enforced consistently with and distinctly from the\n\nservices that Congress deregulated.\n\n          Unfortunately, the result this panel advocates cannot be squared with a previous unpublished\n\nopinion of our court in Baugh v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990). There, the court\n\naffirmed the dismissal of a passenger's claim that during a flight from Houston to New York, a\n\nstewardess stomped on her foot and injured her. This court reasoned that the manner in which a\n\nflight attendant performs her work \"arises out of the services\" afforded passengers by TWA and is\n\ntherefore preempted by § 1305. Baugh is inconsistent with the present case, because negligently\n\nstomping on a passenger's foot bears on passenger safety but only tenuously relates to the airline's\n\nservices. We are bound by Baugh. This circuit has considered its unpublished opinions to be binding\n\nprecedent, although we discourage their citation. Fifth Circuit Local Rule 47.5.3.\n\n          Even if Baugh did not appear to control this case, our vindication of airline safety claims\n\nunder state law would not extend to all state tort claims. To permit any tort suit to be filed simply\n\nbecause it is plausible under state law could conflict with the deregulation of \"rates, routes and\n\nservices.\" Two examples of preemption will suffice.

American Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515544\"><a href=\"/opinion/515544/melvin-ocarroll-v-american-airlines-inc-chaparral-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

O'Carroll sued, alleging that he was wrongfully evicted\n\n   14\n        See Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2034.\n\ffrom the flight. This court vacated O'Carroll's sizeable jury verdict, holding that his state law claims\n\nwere preempted by section 1305. In O'Carroll, we did not discuss the scope of section 1305 because\n\nthe state law claims arising from the alleged wro ngful exclusion undeniably related to the services\n\nprovided by the airline. Enforcement of O'Carroll's state law claims would result in significant de\n\nfacto regulation of the airlines' boarding practices and, moreover, would interfere with the\n\nimplementation of federal regulations granting the airlines substantial discretion in this matter.\n\n       Similarly, if we applied § 1305 unencumbered by Baugh, the tort and contract claims asserted\n\nby the plaintiff in West v. Northwest Airlines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608199\"><a href=\"/opinion/608199/william-d-west-v-northwest-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.1993) would be preempted under\n\nour interpretation of \"services\". Plaintiff West sued after he was \"bumped\" from the overbooked\n\nairline flight for which he had reserved a seat. After remand for reconsideration in light of Morales,\n\nthe Ninth Circuit held, over a dissent, that West's state law claims were too tenuously connected to\n\n\"rates, routes and services\" to be preempted by § 1305. The majority did find West's punitive damage\n\nclaim preempted. Under either Morales or the analysis we would prefer, it is difficult to see how a\n\nlawsuit for overbooking would not \"relate to\" airline \"services.\"\n\n                                         HODGES' CLAIMS\n\n        Hodges alleged that Delta was negligent in allowing the case of rum to be stowed in the\n\noverhead st orage bin. This tort claim for personal injury has no specific \"reference to\" airline\n\nservices. See Morales, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2039; Shaw, 463 U.S. at 97, 103 S.Ct. at 2900.\n\nNor would enforcement of her claim significantly affect Delta's services, as defined above. As other\n\ncases have recently held, this type of claim does not relate to Delta's services and is not preempted\n\nby section 1305. See Public Health Trust of Dade Cty., Fla., v. Lake Aircraft, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605688\"><a href=\"/opinion/605688/the-public-health-trust-of-dade-county-florida-dba-jackson-memorial/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(11th Cir.1993); Margolis v.
