In this suit, she\nand her parents allege that the School District and the Minnesota Department of\nEducation (“Department”) violated her rights under the Individuals with Disabilities\n\fEducation Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. The district court1 dismissed the\nclaims against the Department and granted                                       in\nfavor of the School District on the remaining claims. The Pachls appeal, and we\naffirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n       Sarah Pachl’s developmental and physical disabilities include epilepsy, Dandy\nWalker syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, scoliosis, and bilateral hearing loss. To\naddress these challenges, she receives occupational and physical therapy, speech\ntherapy, and adaptive physical education services. She also wears hearing aids and\nuses a communication device.\n\n       While Pachl was in elementary school, she was in an integrated mainstream\nclassroom for most of her school day, taking time away only for individual therapy.\nIn the fall of 2003, however, when she entered the sixth grade at Coon Rapids Middle\nSchool, the School District determined that she should spend part of her day in a\ncenter-based Structured Teaching and Related Strategies (“STARS”) special\neducation program. The School District implemented an interim placement under\nwhich Pachl would spend some time in the mainstream classrooms, but most of her\nday in the STARS classroom.\n\n       At her parents’ behest, Pachl was observed by an expert, Dr. Alice Udvari-\nSolner, in the interim setting. Dr. Udvari-Solner then prepared a report suggesting\nthat Sarah Pachl’s educational needs could be met most appropriately by spending the\nmajority of her school day in general education classes with supplementary aids and\nservices. Dr. Udvari-Solner opined that Pachl should not spend any time in the\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Paul A. Magnuson, United States District Judge for the District\nof Minnesota.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fSTARS classroom, believing that it limited “age appropriate interaction and\ncommunication skills,” and that the tasks Sarah Pachl was asked to perform in the\nSTARS setting were “non-functional in nature and of little or no use to future\nfunctioning.” (Appellant’s App. at 65-66). Dr. Udvari-Solner also criticized the\nmainstream time as lacking effective inclusive practices and “characterized by missed\nopportunities for learning new skills, using her present skills, working on her IEP\ngoals, or interacting with her age mates.” (Appellant’s App. at 66-67).\n\n       In March 2004, after input from Dr. Udvari-Solner and from Sarah’s parents,\nthe School District proposed a new Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) that\nincreased her mainstream classroom time to approximately 280 minutes each day and\nlimited the time in the STARS classroom to approximately 120 minutes per day. The\nSchool District also implemented some of Dr. Udvari-Solner’s suggestions for\nintegrating Sarah among her peers, such as providing a more age-appropriate\nschedule book and reading materials and placing her locker nearer to the homeroom\nclassroom.2 The School District, however, declined to follow Dr. Udvari-Solner’s\nrecommendation that Sarah not spend any time in the STARS classroom. Finding\nthat recommendation to be in conflict with the assessments of other experts who had\n\n\n      2\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fobserved Sarah, the IEP team concluded that she “need[s] to have skills presented to\nher in [a] repetitive and structured manner” and that she “has shown progress in\nresponse to these strategies.” (Appellant’s App. at 97).\n\n      Although Pachl’s time in the STARS classroom had been reduced in the new\nIEP, her parents objected to the IEP’s inclusion of any STARS program time and\nargued that it did not provide the “least restrictive environment” for their daughter.\nThe parents and School District also disagreed over the length of time proposed for\nthe Extended School Year program for Sarah, and whether the School District should\npay for tuition in a private summer program. The School District requested an\nadministrative due process hearing to resolve the conflicts.\n\n      At the due process hearing, an administrative hearing officer considered\nevidence, including Dr. Udvari-Solner’s report and the testimony of another expert,\nDr. Robert J. Miller, who had observed Sarah in the classroom. Several professionals\nfrom Sarah’s school also testified. After reviewing the evidence, the hearing officer\nagreed with the School District that the IEP was appropriate and consistent with the\nIDEA’s requirements, and that “[t]he District proved that the program it provided in\nthe March 17 IEP will place the student in the least restrictive environment.”\n(Appellant’s App. at 43). The hearing officer also found that the School District was\nnot required to pay any additional costs for Extended School Year services in a\nprivate setting.\n\n       After the unfavorable administrative decision, the Pachls filed suit against the\nSchool District and the Department, alleging that the IEP implemented by the School\nDistrict is not compliant with the IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A). Addressing\nthe claims against the Department, the district court concluded that the Pachls had not\nalleged any act or omission by the State that could constitute a violation of the IDEA\nand thus granted the Department’s motion to dismiss. In a separate order, the district\ncourt also entered judgment in favor of the School District. Reviewing the evidence\n\n                                         -4-\n\fpresented to the administrative hearing officer and giving due weight to the results\nof those proceedings, the district court concluded that “the hearing officer did not err\nwhen finding that the School District proved that the combination of mainstream and\nSTARS learning environments will provide Sarah a meaningful education in the least\nrestrictive environment.” (Mem. and Order, R. Doc. No. 64, at 16; Appellant’s App.\nat 24). The district court also found that the parties had agreed that the School\nDistrict would pay the tuition portion of Sarah Pachl’s private Extended School Year\nservices for the summer 2004, and rejected the Pachls’ allegations that the hearing\nofficer had committed procedural violations during the administrative hearing.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       On appeal, the Pachls no longer challenge the Extended School Year services\nprovided to their daughter, but maintain that the School District’s IEP violates\nSarah’s right to be educated in the “least restrictive environment,” which, under the\nIDEA, requires that she be educated with non-disabled students to the “maximum\nextent appropriate.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5). As the Pachls note, the IDEA creates\na preference for mainstream education, and a disabled student should be separated\nfrom her peers only if the services that make segregated placement superior cannot\n“be feasibly provided in a non-segregated setting.” Roncker v. Walter, 700 F.2d\n1058, 1063 (6th Cir. 1983). Nevertheless, while endorsing Roncker, we have\nemphasized that the statutory language “significantly qualifies the mainstreaming\nrequirement by stating that it should be implemented ‘to the maximum extent\nappropriate,’ 20 U.S.C. § 1412[a](5) (emphasis added), and that it is inapplicable\nwhere education in a mainstream environment ‘cannot be achieved satisfactorily.’\nId. (emphasis added).” A.W. v. Northwest R-1 Sch. Dist., 813 F.2d 158, 163 (8th Cir.\n1987). Thus, removing a child from the mainstream setting is permissible when “the\nhandicapped child would not benefit from mainstreaming,” when “any marginal\nbenefits received from mainstreaming are far outweighed by the benefits gained from\nservices which could not feasibly be provided in the non-segregated setting,” and\n\n                                          -5-\n\fwhen “the handicapped child is a disruptive force in the non-segregated setting.”\nRoncker, 700 F.2d at 1063.\n\n       When reviewing a school district’s compliance with the IDEA’s requirements\nafter an administrative hearing, the district court should make an “independent\ndecision,” based on a preponderance of the evidence, whether the IDEA was violated.\nNeosho R-V Sch. Dist. v. Clark, 315 F.3d 1022, 1027-28 (8th Cir. 2003). The court\nmust nonetheless give “due weight” to the administrative proceedings and should not\n“substitute [its] own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school\nauthorities” which it is reviewing. Id. at 1028 (quoting Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458\nU.S. 176, 206 (1982)). “Because judges are not trained educators, judicial review\nunder the IDEA is limited.” E.S. v. Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 196, 135 F.3d 566, 569 (8th\nCir. 1998). We review the district court’s findings of fact for clear error and its\nconclusions of law de novo. Neosho, 315 F.3d at 1027.\n\n       The Pachls argue that the district court applied the wrong legal standard to\nSarah’s IEP by inquiring whether the inclusion of STARS time was the most\nappropriate alternative, rather than determining whether there was a way feasibly to\nprovide supplementary services in the regular classroom environment. We disagree.\nThe district court described the correct legal standard in detail and discussed the\nappropriate governing cases, including Roncker. The court’s conclusion – that the\nIEP at issue provides “a meaningful education in the least restrictive environment”\n(Mem. and Order, R. Doc. No. 64, at 16; Appellant’s App. at 24) – also accords with\nthe applicable law. Contrary to the Pachls’ argument, the court considered at length\nwhether Sarah could be educated satisfactorily in a mainstream setting with\nsupplementary aids and services. The Pachls challenge the appropriateness of the\ncourt’s comparison of segregated and integrated settings, but the comparison was\nrelevant to the parties’ dispute over whether Sarah Pachl would benefit from full\ninclusion in the mainstream setting. See Roncker, 700 F.2d at 1063. The Pachls\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdisagree with the conclusion that she would not so benefit, but the district court did\nnot misstate or misapply the relevant legal standards.\n\n       The Pachls also challenge the factual basis for the district court’s decision.\nAlthough the disputed IEP provides for Sarah to spend approximately 70 percent of\nher time in the mainstream environment, the Pachls argue that 100 percent of her day\nshould be spent in the regular classroom setting.3 The district court rejected this\nargument, finding that “[w]ith full inclusion, Sarah would be among her peers, but not\nlearning with them.” (Mem. and Order, R. Doc. No. 64, at 16; Appellant’s App. at\n24). The court believed that “[p]lacing her in a learning environment in which she\nis inundated with lectures and instructions that she does not understand and which\nhave no relevance to the work she is capable of doing is not providing her with a\nmeaningful education.” (Id.). Ultimately, the court concluded that “[t]he proposed\nIEP, with thirty percent of the day in the STARS program and seventy percent in the\nmainstream, provides an appropriate balance so that Sarah will receive meaningful\neducation and will also provide her with the social interaction and connection she\nneeds.” (Id.).\n\n       As support for their contention that Sarah should spend 100 percent of her day\nin the regular classroom, the Pachls point to the hearing officer’s statement that\n“[w]hile the proposed IEP goals and objectives could be implemented in the\nmainstream, [the student’s service providers] believed it would be more appropriate\n\n\n      3\n        During oral argument, the Pachls suggested for the first time that even if Sarah\nPachl cannot be educated in the regular classroom, she should be educated for the\nentire day in a mainstream environment – for example, by receiving one-on-one\ninstruction in the library or in another setting where other students might be present.\nThe briefs filed in this court and the district court argued only that Sarah should be\ninstructed in the “regular class” for 100 percent of the day, and we decline to consider\na different contention raised for the first time at oral argument. See United States v.\nLarison, 432 F.3d 921, 923 n.3 (8th Cir. 2006); Stephenson v. Davenport Cmty. Sch.\nDist., 110 F.3d 1303, 1306 n.3 (8th Cir. 1997).\n                                           -7-\n\ffor the Student if she were provided her education and services in both the center-\nbased and mainstream settings.” (Appellant’s App. at 42). The Pachls believe this\nasserted “finding” by the hearing officer must be followed unless it is clearly\nerroneous.\n\n       We believe the district court properly approved the hearing officer’s\nconclusion. The portion of the hearing officer’s decision cited by the Pachls is within\na section headed “factual background,” and it merely summarizes portions of the\ntestimony received. It is not a “finding” of the hearing officer. The finding that the\nhearing officer did make – that the proposed IEP educated Sarah Pachl “in the least\nrestrictive environment” – was amply supported by the evidence. The educators who\nwork with Sarah reported that structured teaching, which includes “establishing\nroutines, using a visual schedule and work system, and using a visual structure to\nclarify independent work tasks,” was a sound education strategy that was aimed at\nhelping Sarah develop greater independence. (Appellee’s App. at 113). Sarah’s\nservice providers also believed that the functional skills that Sarah would need to\ndevelop personal independence could not be fully addressed in the mainstream\nenvironment, “since many of the functional skills that Sarah should learn cannot be\nperformed in the natural setting of the mainstream with enough frequency to provide\nher the needed practice.” (Appellee’s App. at 116). Dr. Miller similarly opined that\nwhile certain courses like choir and adaptive physical education, and even facts-based\ncourses like health, might be appropriate with a parallel curriculum, additional\nmainstreaming would not benefit Sarah. (Appellee’s App. at 90). Although the\nPachls now argue that Sarah should spend the entire day in the regular classroom,\neven Dr. Udvari-Solner recommended only that Sarah spend “the majority of her\nschool day” in “individually selected general education classes and environments.”\n(Appellant’s App. at 64, 73) (emphasis in original). With so many educators agreeing\nthat the amount of mainstream time proposed in Sarah’s IEP was adequate and\nappropriate, we find no error in the conclusion of the district court, giving due weight\nto the views of the School District on matters of sound educational policy, that the\n\n                                          -8-\n\fIEP provided the least restrictive environment for Sarah’s education within the\nmeaning of the IDEA.4\n\n                                          III.\n\n       The Pachls also argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims\nagainst the state Department of Education. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In their\nview, the district court “mistakenly characterized the relief that [they] sought against\nthe state as liability for hearing officers’ decisions,” while in fact they were basing\ntheir claims on the Department’s “failure to exercise its responsibility for general\nsupervision to assure the provision to Sarah Pachl of a free, appropriate public\neducation in the least restrictive environment.” (Appellant’s Br. at 52, 59). As the\n\n\n      4\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fPachls note, under the IDEA, state educational agencies such as the Department have\naffirmative responsibilities to ensure that the provisions of the IDEA requiring\nplacement in the least restrictive environment are implemented, including a\nresponsibility to “[r]eview the [School District’s] justification for its actions” and\n“[a]ssist in planning and implementing any necessary corrective action.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.556.\n\n       Thus, state educational agencies may be responsible for violations of the IDEA\nwhen the state agency in some way “fail[s] ‘to comply with its duty to assure that the\nIDEA’s substantive requirements are implemented.’” John T. v. Iowa Dep’t of Educ.,\n258 F.3d 860, 864-65 (8th Cir. 2001) (quoting Gadsby v. Grasmick, 109 F.3d 940,\n952 (4th Cir. 1997)). For example, our court has suggested that “systemic violation”\nof the State’s responsibilities under the IDEA might give rise to state liability. See\nReinholdson v. Minnesota, 346 F.3d 847, 851 (8th Cir. 2003). The Fourth Circuit has\nfurther indicated that state agencies may be financially responsible for the costs of\nprivate placement where the applicable local agency was not providing a free and\nappropriate education. See Gadsby, 109 F.3d at 952. The Pachls’ complaint,\nhowever, does not allege any specific facts or circumstances attributable to the\nDepartment that could form the basis of liability under the IDEA. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6). In fact, the only action attributed to the Department is its appointment\nof a hearing officer. Even on appeal, the Pachls fail to articulate a specific manner\nin which they believe the Department has neglected its duties to monitor the school\ndistrict, implement corrective action, or otherwise ensure that IDEA requirements are\nmet. Under these circumstances, we agree with the district court that the Pachls failed\nto state a claim against the Minnesota Department of Education.\n\n      The judgments of the district court are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fHEANEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n      I respectfully dissent. The School District has violated Sarah’s right to be\neducated in the “least restrictive environment,” which, under the IDEA, requires that\nshe be educated with nondisabled students to the maximum extent appropriate. The\nrecord conclusively shows that this has not been the case,5 and that the proposed IEP,\nscheduled to take effect if the School District prevails on this appeal, will do little to\nimprove Sarah’s access to a more fully inclusive education for the reasons set forth\nbelow.\n\n       My concerns with the majority’s opinion are three-fold. First, the majority\ndefers to the administrator’s determination that because Sarah will spend seventy\npercent of her day in general education under the proposed IEP, she will attend school\nin the least restrictive environment to the maximum extent appropriate. I disagree.\nSimply expanding her time in the general education classroom does not satisfy the\nIDEA unless Sarah is provided with the requisite aids and services that would\nenhance her access to rich educational opportunities, in accordance with her IEP,\namidst her nondisabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. Appellants and\ntheir expert have provided ample evidence of the missed opportunities for supporting\nSarah’s inclusion and growth in general education under her current IEP, and the\nmultitude of modifications that could be implemented in general education to better\nserve her educational and social needs, in accordance with an updated IEP, for most\nof her day. The district court erred in failing to adopt the appellants’ expert’s\nrecommendations, which, in my view, would provide her with the education she is\nlegally entitled to.\n\n      5\n       From third grade through fifth grade, Sarah was included in general education\nfor more than seventy percent of her school day. When she was advanced to middle\nschool, the School District advised the Pachls that Sarah would be placed in the\nSTARS program, reducing her time in general education from more than seventy\npercent to less than thirty percent a day. It is unclear from the record which IEP has\nbeen implemented during litigation.\n                                          -11-\n\f       Second, Sarah’s time in general education settings unlawfully subjects her to\nacademic and social isolation. On these occasions, she is segregated from her\nnondisabled peers, precluding Sarah’s participation in the routines of typical school\nand adolescent culture and development of relationships with nondisabled students.\nShe arrives late and leaves class early because she changes classes while the hallways\nare empty, she interacts solely with the paraprofessional while in class, and she\nengages in tasks unrelated to the general education curriculum. In homeroom class,\nthe record shows that Sarah sat at a table along the side of the room because she did\nnot have an assigned desk. While other students worked on teacher appreciation\ncards, Sarah looked at a picture book. During lunch, Sarah ate with the\nparaprofessional at a table in the common lunchroom, but none of her nondisabled\npeers interacted with her. While in social studies class, her nondisabled peers read\na unit about Asia while Sarah colored the top of a Xeroxed calendar. Beyond the IEP\nmeetings, the record demonstrates that little has been done to support Sarah’s\nintegration into a nonsegregated environment. There appears to be little, if any,\ncollaboration between special education and general education teachers in designing\nand implementing lessons that are academically appropriate for Sarah and sufficiently\nrelated to her peers’ curriculum.\n\n       The majority asserts that the School District intends to improve Sarah’s\ninclusion in general education settings by developing an age-appropriate schedule\nbook, training staff how to walk with Sarah down hallways, assigning Sarah to a\nhomeroom class located closer to her locker, and requiring Sarah’s case manager to\nmeet with Sarah’s “education teacher on a weekly basis.” These cursory\nmodifications to Sarah’s IEP fail to improve the overall integrity of her inclusion in\ngeneral education.\n\n      Unfortunately, Sarah’s participation in general education in this school district\nhas deprived her of the benefits of a progressive inclusion program: recognition that\nshe is a valued and visible member of the school community; exposure to age-\n\n                                         -12-\n\fappropriate and varied curriculum and instruction; exposure to positive language and\nbehavioral models of typically developing peers; and the development of social and\nacademic relationships with general education teachers and nondisabled students.\nWhile the IDEA “does not require that a school either maximize a student’s potential\nor provide the best possible education at public expense,” Fort Zumwalt Sch. Dist. v.\nClynes, 119 F.3d 607, 612 (8th Cir. 1997), and discourages courts from substituting\ntheir own notions of educational policy for those of trained educators, Neosho R-V\nSch. Dist., 315 F.3d at 1028, the School District fell far short of its required goal of\nproviding her with the least restrictive environment to the maximum extent\nappropriate. Appellants’ expert, Dr. Udvari-Solner, has expressed a reasonable\nconcern that the School District’s attempt at mainstreaming Sarah was ineffective and\nfailed to meet her IEP goals. The questionable quality of Sarah’s integration into\ngeneral education makes a comparative analysis of the benefits of general education\nand special education difficult, at best.\n\n       With regard to the majority’s suggestion that Dr. Udvari-Solner’s expertise in\nspecial education practices is deficient, the record shows that she teaches graduate\nand undergraduate courses in elementary education, secondary education, and special\neducation at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. (Appellants’ App. Vol. II at\n238.) She has supervised and trained education students who work with autistic\nchildren, and she teaches her students how to lesson plan, implement differentiated\ncurriculum and cooperative learning techniques in special education. (Id. at 239.) She\nalso directly assists teachers in the Madison public schools to serve students with\nautism and severe multiple disabilities. (Id. at 238.) The School District’s expert\nwitness disagreed with Dr. Udvari-Solner’s assessment of Sarah’s IEPs. Given this\nconflicting expert testimony, it was inappropriate to grant summary judgment in favor\nof the School District. Rather, the district court should have “weighed and evaluated\nthe directly contradictory expert testimony”and made its findings of fact. Hoefelman\nv. Conservation Comm’n of the Mo. Dep’t of Conservation, 718 F.2d 281, 285 (8th\nCir. 1983). It failed to do so here.\n\n                                         -13-\n\f       Finally, the record reveals that the STARS program is outdated and in direct\nconflict with best curriculum practices in special education. It appears to offer Sarah\nfewer opportunities to improve her adaptive behavior, self-help, daily living, social,\nand communication skills than a mainstreamed context would. The STARS\nclassroom may be unnecessarily restrictive, in that it limits Sarah’s ability to learn\nrelevant functional skills and independence that a segregated environment is designed\nto address. In the School District’s Response to Report by Dr. Udvari-Solner, the\nSchool District explained that “[a] functional skill is one that provides the student\nwith the opportunity to develop his/her level of personal independence and integrity.”\n(Appellee’s App. at A-114.) Yet, Sarah spends much of her instructional time\nengaged in matching colors, shapes, and patterns, and listening to music and books\nintended for toddlers. The classroom walls are covered with preschool materials that\nhave little to do with the age-appropriate skills she is expected to learn and practice,\nas articulated in her IEP. She sorts toothbrushes and plastic dinosaurs, and helps\n“bake” cupcakes by placing a cupcake wrapper in a tin. She plays duck-duck-goose.\nSuch tasks appear to be unconnected with meaningful activities that are performed\nat home, in school, and in vocational settings. Additionally, during the expert’s two-\nday observation of Sarah in the STARS classroom, only one student spoke to Sarah\nusing a complete sentence, and the staff spoke to the disabled students using an\nexaggerated and unnatural tone of voice. She also noted that Sarah had no\nopportunities to interact with nondisabled peers while in the STARS classroom.\nInstead, Sarah used a locker, a kitchen, sink, and bathroom in the special education\nwing of the school, which is isolated from general education classrooms and\nhallways.\n\n      In light of the fact that the School District insists that Sarah cannot benefit from\ngreater inclusion in general education in spite of appellants’ strenuous objection, and\ngiven Dr. Udvari-Solner’s legitimate concerns regarding the quality of programming\nin STARS and in general education, it was clear error for the district court to hold that\nthe School District complied with the IDEA in developing and implementing the IEP\n\n                                          -14-\n\fproposed to the parents on March 14, 2004 and to grant the School District’s motion\nfor summary judgment on the administrative record.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f",

In this suit, she\nand her parents allege that the School District and the Minnesota Department of\nEducation (“Department”) violated her rights under the Individuals with Disabilities\n\fEducation Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. The district court1 dismissed the\nclaims against the Department and granted                                       in\nfavor of the School District on the remaining claims. The Pachls appeal, and we\naffirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n       Sarah Pachl’s developmental and physical disabilities include epilepsy, Dandy\nWalker syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, scoliosis, and bilateral hearing loss. To\naddress these challenges, she receives occupational and physical therapy, speech\ntherapy, and adaptive physical education services. She also wears hearing aids and\nuses a communication device.\n\n       While Pachl was in elementary school, she was in an integrated mainstream\nclassroom for most of her school day, taking time away only for individual therapy.\nIn the fall of 2003, however, when she entered the sixth grade at Coon Rapids Middle\nSchool, the School District determined that she should spend part of her day in a\ncenter-based Structured Teaching and Related Strategies (“STARS”) special\neducation program. The School District implemented an interim placement under\nwhich Pachl would spend some time in the mainstream classrooms, but most of her\nday in the STARS classroom.\n\n       At her parents’ behest, Pachl was observed by an expert, Dr. Alice Udvari-\nSolner, in the interim setting. Dr. Udvari-Solner then prepared a report suggesting\nthat Sarah Pachl’s educational needs could be met most appropriately by spending the\nmajority of her school day in general education classes with supplementary aids and\nservices. Dr. Udvari-Solner opined that Pachl should not spend any time in the\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Paul A. Magnuson, United States District Judge for the District\nof Minnesota.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fSTARS classroom, believing that it limited “age appropriate interaction and\ncommunication skills,” and that the tasks Sarah Pachl was asked to perform in the\nSTARS setting were “non-functional in nature and of little or no use to future\nfunctioning.” (Appellant’s App. at 65-66). Dr. Udvari-Solner also criticized the\nmainstream time as lacking effective inclusive practices and “characterized by missed\nopportunities for learning new skills, using her present skills, working on her IEP\ngoals, or interacting with her age mates.” (Appellant’s App. at 66-67).\n\n       In March 2004, after input from Dr. Udvari-Solner and from Sarah’s parents,\nthe School District proposed a new Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) that\nincreased her mainstream classroom time to approximately 280 minutes each day and\nlimited the time in the STARS classroom to approximately 120 minutes per day. The\nSchool District also implemented some of Dr. Udvari-Solner’s suggestions for\nintegrating Sarah among her peers, such as providing a more age-appropriate\nschedule book and reading materials and placing her locker nearer to the homeroom\nclassroom.2 The School District, however, declined to follow Dr. Udvari-Solner’s\nrecommendation that Sarah not spend any time in the STARS classroom. Finding\nthat recommendation to be in conflict with the assessments of other experts who had\n\n\n      2\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fobserved Sarah, the IEP team concluded that she “need[s] to have skills presented to\nher in [a] repetitive and structured manner” and that she “has shown progress in\nresponse to these strategies.” (Appellant’s App. at 97).\n\n      Although Pachl’s time in the STARS classroom had been reduced in the new\nIEP, her parents objected to the IEP’s inclusion of any STARS program time and\nargued that it did not provide the “least restrictive environment” for their daughter.\nThe parents and School District also disagreed over the length of time proposed for\nthe Extended School Year program for Sarah, and whether the School District should\npay for tuition in a private summer program. The School District requested an\nadministrative due process hearing to resolve the conflicts.\n\n      At the due process hearing, an administrative hearing officer considered\nevidence, including Dr. Udvari-Solner’s report and the testimony of another expert,\nDr. Robert J. Miller, who had observed Sarah in the classroom. Several professionals\nfrom Sarah’s school also testified. After reviewing the evidence, the hearing officer\nagreed with the School District that the IEP was appropriate and consistent with the\nIDEA’s requirements, and that “[t]he District proved that the program it provided in\nthe March 17 IEP will place the student in the least restrictive environment.”\n(Appellant’s App. at 43). The hearing officer also found that the School District was\nnot required to pay any additional costs for Extended School Year services in a\nprivate setting.\n\n       After the unfavorable administrative decision, the Pachls filed suit against the\nSchool District and the Department, alleging that the IEP implemented by the School\nDistrict is not compliant with the IDEA. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A). Addressing\nthe claims against the Department, the district court concluded that the Pachls had not\nalleged any act or omission by the State that could constitute a violation of the IDEA\nand thus granted the Department’s motion to dismiss. In a separate order, the district\ncourt also entered judgment in favor of the School District. Reviewing the evidence\n\n                                         -4-\n\fpresented to the administrative hearing officer and giving due weight to the results\nof those proceedings, the district court concluded that “the hearing officer did not err\nwhen finding that the School District proved that the combination of mainstream and\nSTARS learning environments will provide Sarah a meaningful education in the least\nrestrictive environment.” (Mem. and Order, R. Doc. No. 64, at 16; Appellant’s App.\nat 24). The district court also found that the parties had agreed that the School\nDistrict would pay the tuition portion of Sarah Pachl’s private Extended School Year\nservices for the summer 2004, and rejected the Pachls’ allegations that the hearing\nofficer had committed procedural violations during the administrative hearing.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       On appeal, the Pachls no longer challenge the Extended School Year services\nprovided to their daughter, but maintain that the School District’s IEP violates\nSarah’s right to be educated in the “least restrictive environment,” which, under the\nIDEA, requires that she be educated with non-disabled students to the “maximum\nextent appropriate.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5). As the Pachls note, the IDEA creates\na preference for mainstream education, and a disabled student should be separated\nfrom her peers only if the services that make segregated placement superior cannot\n“be feasibly provided in a non-segregated setting.” Roncker v. Walter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414480\"><a href=\"/opinion/414480/mary-ann-roncker-on-behalf-of-neill-roncker-individually-and-on-behalf-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1063 (6th Cir. 1983). Nevertheless, while endorsing Roncker, we have\nemphasized that the statutory language “significantly qualifies the mainstreaming\nrequirement by stating that it should be implemented ‘to the maximum extent\nappropriate,’ 20 U.S.C. § 1412[a](5) (emphasis added), and that it is inapplicable\nwhere education in a mainstream environment ‘cannot be achieved satisfactorily.’\nId.

Thus, removing a child from the mainstream setting is permissible when “the\nhandicapped child would not benefit from mainstreaming,” when “any marginal\nbenefits received from mainstreaming are far outweighed by the benefits gained from\nservices which could not feasibly be provided in the non-segregated setting,” and\n\n                                          -5-\n\fwhen “the handicapped child is a disruptive force in the non-segregated setting.”\nRoncker, 700 F.2d at 1063.\n\n       When reviewing a school district’s compliance with the IDEA’s requirements\nafter an administrative hearing, the district court should make an “independent\ndecision,” based on a preponderance of the evidence, whether the IDEA was violated.\nNeosho R-V Sch.

We review the district court’s findings of fact for clear error and its\nconclusions of law de novo. Neosho, 315 F.3d at 1027.\n\n       The Pachls argue that the district court applied the wrong legal standard to\nSarah’s IEP by inquiring whether the inclusion of STARS time was the most\nappropriate alternative, rather than determining whether there was a way feasibly to\nprovide supplementary services in the regular classroom environment. We disagree.\nThe district court described the correct legal standard in detail and discussed the\nappropriate governing cases, including Roncker. The court’s conclusion – that the\nIEP at issue provides “a meaningful education in the least restrictive environment”\n(Mem. and Order, R. Doc. No. 64, at 16; Appellant’s App. at 24) – also accords with\nthe applicable law. Contrary to the Pachls’ argument, the court considered at length\nwhether Sarah could be educated satisfactorily in a mainstream setting with\nsupplementary aids and services. The Pachls challenge the appropriateness of the\ncourt’s comparison of segregated and integrated settings, but the comparison was\nrelevant to the parties’ dispute over whether Sarah Pachl would benefit from full\ninclusion in the mainstream setting. See Roncker, 700 F.2d at 1063. The Pachls\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdisagree with the conclusion that she would not so benefit, but the district court did\nnot misstate or misapply the relevant legal standards.\n\n       The Pachls also challenge the factual basis for the district court’s decision.\nAlthough the disputed IEP provides for Sarah to spend approximately 70 percent of\nher time in the mainstream environment, the Pachls argue that 100 percent of her day\nshould be spent in the regular classroom setting.3 The district court rejected this\nargument, finding that “[w]ith full inclusion, Sarah would be among her peers, but not\nlearning with them.” (Mem. and Order, R. Doc. No. 64, at 16; Appellant’s App. at\n24). The court believed that “[p]lacing her in a learning environment in which she\nis inundated with lectures and instructions that she does not understand and which\nhave no relevance to the work she is capable of doing is not providing her with a\nmeaningful education.” (Id.). Ultimately, the court concluded that “[t]he proposed\nIEP, with thirty percent of the day in the STARS program and seventy percent in the\nmainstream, provides an appropriate balance so that Sarah will receive meaningful\neducation and will also provide her with the social interaction and connection she\nneeds.” (Id.).\n\n       As support for their contention that Sarah should spend 100 percent of her day\nin the regular classroom, the Pachls point to the hearing officer’s statement that\n“[w]hile the proposed IEP goals and objectives could be implemented in the\nmainstream, [the student’s service providers] believed it would be more appropriate\n\n\n      3\n        During oral argument, the Pachls suggested for the first time that even if Sarah\nPachl cannot be educated in the regular classroom, she should be educated for the\nentire day in a mainstream environment – for example, by receiving one-on-one\ninstruction in the library or in another setting where other students might be present.\nThe briefs filed in this court and the district court argued only that Sarah should be\ninstructed in the “regular class” for 100 percent of the day, and we decline to consider\na different contention raised for the first time at oral argument.

The Pachls believe this\nasserted “finding” by the hearing officer must be followed unless it is clearly\nerroneous.\n\n       We believe the district court properly approved the hearing officer’s\nconclusion. The portion of the hearing officer’s decision cited by the Pachls is within\na section headed “factual background,” and it merely summarizes portions of the\ntestimony received. It is not a “finding” of the hearing officer. The finding that the\nhearing officer did make – that the proposed IEP educated Sarah Pachl “in the least\nrestrictive environment” – was amply supported by the evidence. The educators who\nwork with Sarah reported that structured teaching, which includes “establishing\nroutines, using a visual schedule and work system, and using a visual structure to\nclarify independent work tasks,” was a sound education strategy that was aimed at\nhelping Sarah develop greater independence. (Appellee’s App. at 113). Sarah’s\nservice providers also believed that the functional skills that Sarah would need to\ndevelop personal independence could not be fully addressed in the mainstream\nenvironment, “since many of the functional skills that Sarah should learn cannot be\nperformed in the natural setting of the mainstream with enough frequency to provide\nher the needed practice.” (Appellee’s App. at 116). Dr. Miller similarly opined that\nwhile certain courses like choir and adaptive physical education, and even facts-based\ncourses like health, might be appropriate with a parallel curriculum, additional\nmainstreaming would not benefit Sarah. (Appellee’s App. at 90). Although the\nPachls now argue that Sarah should spend the entire day in the regular classroom,\neven Dr. Udvari-Solner recommended only that Sarah spend “the majority of her\nschool day” in “individually selected general education classes and environments.”\n(Appellant’s App. at 64, 73) (emphasis in original). With so many educators agreeing\nthat the amount of mainstream time proposed in Sarah’s IEP was adequate and\nappropriate, we find no error in the conclusion of the district court, giving due weight\nto the views of the School District on matters of sound educational policy, that the\n\n                                          -8-\n\fIEP provided the least restrictive environment for Sarah’s education within the\nmeaning of the IDEA.4\n\n                                          III.\n\n       The Pachls also argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims\nagainst the state Department of Education. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In their\nview, the district court “mistakenly characterized the relief that [they] sought against\nthe state as liability for hearing officers’ decisions,” while in fact they were basing\ntheir claims on the Department’s “failure to exercise its responsibility for general\nsupervision to assure the provision to Sarah Pachl of a free, appropriate public\neducation in the least restrictive environment.” (Appellant’s Br. at 52, 59). As the\n\n\n      4\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fPachls note, under the IDEA, state educational agencies such as the Department have\naffirmative responsibilities to ensure that the provisions of the IDEA requiring\nplacement in the least restrictive environment are implemented, including a\nresponsibility to “[r]eview the [School District’s] justification for its actions” and\n“[a]ssist in planning and implementing any necessary corrective action.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.556.\n\n       Thus, state educational agencies may be responsible for violations of the IDEA\nwhen the state agency in some way “fail[s] ‘to comply with its duty to assure that the\nIDEA’s substantive requirements are implemented.’” John T. v.

For example, our court has suggested that “systemic violation”\nof the State’s responsibilities under the IDEA might give rise to state liability. See\nReinholdson v. Minnesota, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783878\"><a href=\"/opinion/783878/mahesh-reinholdson-plaintiffsappellantscross-v-state-of-minnesota/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 851 (8th Cir. 2003). The Fourth Circuit has\nfurther indicated that state agencies may be financially responsible for the costs of\nprivate placement where the applicable local agency was not providing a free and\nappropriate education. See Gadsby, 109 F.3d at 952. The Pachls’ complaint,\nhowever, does not allege any specific facts or circumstances attributable to the\nDepartment that could form the basis of liability under the IDEA. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 12(b)(6). In fact, the only action attributed to the Department is its appointment\nof a hearing officer. Even on appeal, the Pachls fail to articulate a specific manner\nin which they believe the Department has neglected its duties to monitor the school\ndistrict, implement corrective action, or otherwise ensure that IDEA requirements are\nmet. Under these circumstances, we agree with the district court that the Pachls failed\nto state a claim against the Minnesota Department of Education.\n\n      The judgments of the district court are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fHEANEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n      I respectfully dissent. The School District has violated Sarah’s right to be\neducated in the “least restrictive environment,” which, under the IDEA, requires that\nshe be educated with nondisabled students to the maximum extent appropriate. The\nrecord conclusively shows that this has not been the case,5 and that the proposed IEP,\nscheduled to take effect if the School District prevails on this appeal, will do little to\nimprove Sarah’s access to a more fully inclusive education for the reasons set forth\nbelow.\n\n       My concerns with the majority’s opinion are three-fold. First, the majority\ndefers to the administrator’s determination that because Sarah will spend seventy\npercent of her day in general education under the proposed IEP, she will attend school\nin the least restrictive environment to the maximum extent appropriate. I disagree.\nSimply expanding her time in the general education classroom does not satisfy the\nIDEA unless Sarah is provided with the requisite aids and services that would\nenhance her access to rich educational opportunities, in accordance with her IEP,\namidst her nondisabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. Appellants and\ntheir expert have provided ample evidence of the missed opportunities for supporting\nSarah’s inclusion and growth in general education under her current IEP, and the\nmultitude of modifications that could be implemented in general education to better\nserve her educational and social needs, in accordance with an updated IEP, for most\nof her day. The district court erred in failing to adopt the appellants’ expert’s\nrecommendations, which, in my view, would provide her with the education she is\nlegally entitled to.\n\n      5\n       From third grade through fifth grade, Sarah was included in general education\nfor more than seventy percent of her school day. When she was advanced to middle\nschool, the School District advised the Pachls that Sarah would be placed in the\nSTARS program, reducing her time in general education from more than seventy\npercent to less than thirty percent a day. It is unclear from the record which IEP has\nbeen implemented during litigation.\n                                          -11-\n\f       Second, Sarah’s time in general education settings unlawfully subjects her to\nacademic and social isolation. On these occasions, she is segregated from her\nnondisabled peers, precluding Sarah’s participation in the routines of typical school\nand adolescent culture and development of relationships with nondisabled students.\nShe arrives late and leaves class early because she changes classes while the hallways\nare empty, she interacts solely with the paraprofessional while in class, and she\nengages in tasks unrelated to the general education curriculum. In homeroom class,\nthe record shows that Sarah sat at a table along the side of the room because she did\nnot have an assigned desk. While other students worked on teacher appreciation\ncards, Sarah looked at a picture book. During lunch, Sarah ate with the\nparaprofessional at a table in the common lunchroom, but none of her nondisabled\npeers interacted with her. While in social studies class, her nondisabled peers read\na unit about Asia while Sarah colored the top of a Xeroxed calendar. Beyond the IEP\nmeetings, the record demonstrates that little has been done to support Sarah’s\nintegration into a nonsegregated environment. There appears to be little, if any,\ncollaboration between special education and general education teachers in designing\nand implementing lessons that are academically appropriate for Sarah and sufficiently\nrelated to her peers’ curriculum.\n\n       The majority asserts that the School District intends to improve Sarah’s\ninclusion in general education settings by developing an age-appropriate schedule\nbook, training staff how to walk with Sarah down hallways, assigning Sarah to a\nhomeroom class located closer to her locker, and requiring Sarah’s case manager to\nmeet with Sarah’s “education teacher on a weekly basis.” These cursory\nmodifications to Sarah’s IEP fail to improve the overall integrity of her inclusion in\ngeneral education.\n\n      Unfortunately, Sarah’s participation in general education in this school district\nhas deprived her of the benefits of a progressive inclusion program: recognition that\nshe is a valued and visible member of the school community; exposure to age-\n\n                                         -12-\n\fappropriate and varied curriculum and instruction; exposure to positive language and\nbehavioral models of typically developing peers; and the development of social and\nacademic relationships with general education teachers and nondisabled students.\nWhile the IDEA “does not require that a school either maximize a student’s potential\nor provide the best possible education at public expense,” Fort Zumwalt Sch. Dist. v.\nClynes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744106\"><a href=\"/opinion/744106/fort-zumwalt-school-district-appellantcross-appellee-v-robert-clynes-ann/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612 (8th Cir. 1997), and discourages courts from substituting\ntheir own notions of educational policy for those of trained educators, Neosho R-V\nSch. Dist., 315 F.3d at 1028, the School District fell far short of its required goal of\nproviding her with the least restrictive environment to the maximum extent\nappropriate. Appellants’ expert, Dr. Udvari-Solner, has expressed a reasonable\nconcern that the School District’s attempt at mainstreaming Sarah was ineffective and\nfailed to meet her IEP goals. The questionable quality of Sarah’s integration into\ngeneral education makes a comparative analysis of the benefits of general education\nand special education difficult, at best.\n\n       With regard to the majority’s suggestion that Dr. Udvari-Solner’s expertise in\nspecial education practices is deficient, the record shows that she teaches graduate\nand undergraduate courses in elementary education, secondary education, and special\neducation at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. (Appellants’ App. Vol. II at\n238.) She has supervised and trained education students who work with autistic\nchildren, and she teaches her students how to lesson plan, implement differentiated\ncurriculum and cooperative learning techniques in special education. (Id. at 239.) She\nalso directly assists teachers in the Madison public schools to serve students with\nautism and severe multiple disabilities. (Id. at 238.) The School District’s expert\nwitness disagreed with Dr. Udvari-Solner’s assessment of Sarah’s IEPs. Given this\nconflicting expert testimony, it was inappropriate to grant summary judgment in favor\nof the School District. Rather, the district court should have “weighed and evaluated\nthe directly contradictory expert testimony”and made its findings of fact. Hoefelman\nv. Conservation Comm’n of the Mo.

It failed to do so here.\n\n                                         -13-\n\f       Finally, the record reveals that the STARS program is outdated and in direct\nconflict with best curriculum practices in special education. It appears to offer Sarah\nfewer opportunities to improve her adaptive behavior, self-help, daily living, social,\nand communication skills than a mainstreamed context would. The STARS\nclassroom may be unnecessarily restrictive, in that it limits Sarah’s ability to learn\nrelevant functional skills and independence that a segregated environment is designed\nto address. In the School District’s Response to Report by Dr. Udvari-Solner, the\nSchool District explained that “[a] functional skill is one that provides the student\nwith the opportunity to develop his/her level of personal independence and integrity.”\n(Appellee’s App. at A-114.) Yet, Sarah spends much of her instructional time\nengaged in matching colors, shapes, and patterns, and listening to music and books\nintended for toddlers. The classroom walls are covered with preschool materials that\nhave little to do with the age-appropriate skills she is expected to learn and practice,\nas articulated in her IEP. She sorts toothbrushes and plastic dinosaurs, and helps\n“bake” cupcakes by placing a cupcake wrapper in a tin. She plays duck-duck-goose.\nSuch tasks appear to be unconnected with meaningful activities that are performed\nat home, in school, and in vocational settings. Additionally, during the expert’s two-\nday observation of Sarah in the STARS classroom, only one student spoke to Sarah\nusing a complete sentence, and the staff spoke to the disabled students using an\nexaggerated and unnatural tone of voice. She also noted that Sarah had no\nopportunities to interact with nondisabled peers while in the STARS classroom.\nInstead, Sarah used a locker, a kitchen, sink, and bathroom in the special education\nwing of the school, which is isolated from general education classrooms and\nhallways.\n\n      In light of the fact that the School District insists that Sarah cannot benefit from\ngreater inclusion in general education in spite of appellants’ strenuous objection, and\ngiven Dr. Udvari-Solner’s legitimate concerns regarding the quality of programming\nin STARS and in general education, it was clear error for the district court to hold that\nthe School District complied with the IDEA in developing and implementing the IEP\n\n                                          -14-\n\fproposed to the parents on March 14, 2004 and to grant the School District’s motion\nfor summary judgment on the administrative record.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f</pre>",
