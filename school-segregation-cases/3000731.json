Londrigan,\n             Defendants-Appellants.                ) Judge Presiding.\n____________________________________________________________\n\n              PRESIDING JUSTICE APPLETON delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n              Provena Hospitals (Provena) brought an action for administrative review\n\nof a decision by the Director of the Illinois Department of Revenue (Department) that\n\nProvena's property, Provena Covenant Medical Center (Covenant) in Urbana, Illinois,\n\ndid not qualify for an exemption from property taxes. The circuit court reversed the\n\nDirector's decision, holding that Covenant was used primarily for charitable and\n\nreligious purposes and, therefore, was exempt under sections 15-65(a) and 15-40(a)(1)\n\nof the Property Tax Code (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a), 15-40(a)(1) (West 2002)). We reverse\n\nthe circuit court's judgment because we find no clear error in the Director's decision.\n\n                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\n              Covenant is a not-for-profit, full-service, general acute-care hospital. As a\n\nnoncorporate subdivision of Provena, Covenant has no separate legal identity of its own.\n\nCovenant is the property, and Provena is the owner. According to an organizational\n\nchart in the record (applicant's exhibit No. 153), Provena owns five other hospitals\n\fbesides Covenant, but those other hospitals are not at issue in this case.\n\n              Provena applied to the Champaign County Board of Review to exempt\n\nCovenant from property taxes for 2002 on the ground that Covenant was used primarily\n\nfor charitable purposes (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a) (West 2002)). (Actually, Covenant was\n\nnominally the applicant, but because Covenant is not a legal \"person,\" we consider\n\nProvena to be the real applicant.) The board of review recommended denying the\n\napplication, and in February 2004, the Director followed that recommendation.\n\n              Provena paid $1.1 million in property taxes under protest and requested an\n\nadministrative hearing. In the hearing before the Department's administrative law\n\njudge (ALJ), Provena raised an additional ground for exemption besides charitable\n\npurposes (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a) (West 2002)): it claimed that as a health-care ministry\n\nof the Roman Catholic Church, Covenant was used primarily for religious purposes (35\n\nILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West 2002)). The ALJ submitted to the Director a decision\n\nrecommending an exemption on the sole grounds that Provena was a charitable\n\ninstitution and its property, Covenant, was used primarily for charitable purposes. The\n\nALJ did not reach the issue of whether Covenant was used primarily for religious\n\npurposes as well.\n\n              The Director disagreed with the ALJ's recommendation and denied an\n\nexemption for charitable uses. The primary reason for his decision was that in 2002, the\n\ntax year in question, Covenant devoted only 0.7% of its total revenue to charity care. Of\n\n110,000 admissions in 2002, Covenant gave free care to only 196 patients and dis-\n\ncounted care to only 106 patients; and Covenant hired collection agencies to recover the\n\nremaining balances from 64 of the patients to whom it had given discounts. Without\n\n                                           -2-\n\fexplanation, the Director also denied an exemption for religious uses.\n\n              Provena filed a complaint for administrative review. It argued to the\n\ncircuit court that under the supreme court's decisions, charities were not defined by\n\npercentages and that, in any event, Covenant dispensed an ample amount of charity to\n\nthe community in forms other than charity care. Covenant had a charity-care policy\n\nbased on federal poverty guidelines, and it advertised the availability of \"financial\n\nassistance.\" According to Provena, Covenant gave this financial assistance to every\n\npatient who needed and requested it, and the number of indigent people who walked in\n\nthrough the door and availed themselves of the charity-care policy simply was beyond\n\nCovenant's control. Also, Provena argued, considering the meager rates of reimburse-\n\nment the government paid, treating Medicare and Medicaid patients was itself an act of\n\ncharity. Provena further argued--indeed, the parties had stipulated--that Covenant was\n\na faith-based institution founded, organized, owned, and operated as an apostolic\n\nmission and health-care ministry of the Catholic Church. The circuit court concluded\n\nthat Covenant was entitled to both a charitable and religious exemption, and it reversed\n\nthe Director's decision.\n\n              This appeal followed.\n\n                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\n                                  A. Standard of Review\n\n              We review the Department's decision, not the circuit court's decision.\n\nCalvary Baptist Church of Tilton v. Department of Revenue, 349 Ill. App. 3d 325, 330,\n\n812 N.E.2d 1, 4 (2004). The parties disagree on our standard of review. The Depart-\n\nment argues we should review its decision for clear error. Provena argues we should\n\n                                            -3-\n\freview the Department's decision de novo. It is crucial, at the outset, to identify the\n\napplicable standards of review, for they often determine the results on appeal--indeed, a\n\nreviewing court does not even have the means of deciding an issue until it first identifies\n\nthe standard of review.\n\n              Formerly, the rule was that \"[if] facts [were] undisputed, *** a determina-\n\ntion of whether property [was] exempt from taxation [was] a question of law.\" Chicago\n\nPatrolmen's Ass'n v. Department of Revenue, 171 Ill. 2d 263, 271, 664 N.E.2d 52, 56\n\n(1996); see also City of Chicago v. Illinois Department of Revenue, 147 Ill. 2d 484, 491,\n\n590 N.E.2d 478, 481 (1992); Harrisburg-Raleigh Airport Authority v. Department of\n\nRevenue, 126 Ill. 2d 326, 331, 533 N.E.2d 1072, 1073 (1989). To the extent the facts\n\nwere disputed, courts decided whether the Department's factual findings were against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence. Branson v. Department of Revenue, 168 Ill. 2d 247,\n\n264, 659 N.E.2d 961, 969-70 (1995). Thus, on administrative review of the Depart-\n\nment's decision to grant or deny an exemption, any given issue fell into either the\n\ncategory of fact or the category of law.\n\n              In City of Belvidere v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 181 Ill. 2d 191,\n\n205, 692 N.E.2d 295, 302 (1998), the supreme court identified, for the first time, a third\n\ntype of question a court could ask on administrative review: a question that was neither\n\npurely factual nor purely legal but one of fact and law mixed together. The supreme\n\ncourt decided that because the case required \"an examination of the legal effect of a\n\ngiven set of facts, it [presented] a mixed question of fact and law\" and the supreme court\n\nwould review the agency's decision for clear error (City of Belvidere, 181 Ill. 2d at 205,\n\n692 N.E.2d at 302)--not de novo, as the supreme court previously had held.\n\n                                            -4-\n\f              Later, in Eden Retirement Center, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, 213 Ill.\n\n2d 273, 284, 821 N.E.2d 240, 246 (2004), the supreme court seemed to revert to the\n\nformer rule: it prescribed a de novo standard of review when the facts were undisputed\n\nand the only issue was whether the property was exempt. The supreme court stated:\n\n\"[T]he Department's decision as to whether [the] plaintiff's property is exempt from\n\ntaxation depends solely on the application of the appropriate legal standard to the\n\nundisputed facts, which is a question of law.\" Accordingly, in a recent property-tax\n\nexemption case, we dutifully echoed the supreme court: \" '[T]he Department's decision\n\nas to whether [the] plaintiff's property is exempt from taxation depends solely on the\n\napplication of the appropriate legal standard to the undisputed facts, which is a question\n\nof law.' \" Faith Builders Church, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, 378 Ill. App. 3d 1037,\n\n1043, 882 N.E.2d 1256, 1261 (2008), appeal denied, 228 Ill. 2d 531, 889 N.E.2d 1115\n\n(2008), quoting Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 284, 821 N.E.2d at 246.\n\n              Soon after our decision in Faith Builders, the supreme court issued a\n\ndecision in which it reaffirmed the three different standards of review in administrative-\n\nreview cases: manifest weight of the evidence for questions of fact, de novo for ques-\n\ntions of law, and clear error for questions of fact and law mixed together. Cinkus v.\n\nVillage of Stickney Municipal Officers Electoral Board, 228 Ill. 2d 200, 210-11, 886\n\nN.E.2d 1011, 1018 (2008). In the third type of question--a question that was simulta-\n\nneously legal and factual--\" ' \"the historical facts [were] admitted or established, the rule\n\nof law [was] undisputed, and the issue [was] whether the facts satisf[ied] the statutory\n\nstandard, or[,] to put it another way, whether the rule of law as applied to the estab-\n\nlished facts [was] or [was] not violated.\" ' \" Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 211, 886 N.E.2d at\n\n                                            -5-\n\f1018, quoting American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, Council 31\n\nv. State Labor Relations Board, 216 Ill. 2d 569, 577, 839 N.E.2d 479, 485 (2005),\n\nquoting Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 289 n.19, 72 L. Ed. 2d 66, 80 n.19,\n\n102 S. Ct. 1781, 1790 n.19 (1982). Manifest weight of the evidence would be an insuffi-\n\ncient concept to bring to such a hybrid question, for evidence relates only to facts and\n\nthe question is one of law as much as fact. Also, the legal aspect of the question calls for\n\nsomewhat less deference than if the question were purely factual. Carpetland U.S.A.,\n\nInc. v. Illinois Department of Employment Security, 201 Ill. 2d 351, 369, 776 N.E.2d 166,\n\n177 (2002). On a continuum of deference, clear error is located between manifest\n\nweight and de novo. Carpetland U.S.A., 201 Ill. 2d at 369, 776 N.E.2d at 177; see also Du\n\nPage County Board of Review v. Department of Revenue, 339 Ill. App. 3d 230, 234, 790\n\nN.E.2d 918, 922 (2003) (remarking that, in practice, the difference between these\n\ndegrees of deference can be subtle). \"[A]n administrative agency's decision is deemed\n\n'clearly erroneous' when the reviewing court is left with the ' \"definite and firm convic-\n\ntion that a mistake has been committed.\" ' \" Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 211, 886 N.E.2d at\n\n1018, quoting AFM Messenger Service, Inc. v. Department of Employment Security, 198\n\nIll. 2d 380, 395, 763 N.E.2d 272, 282 (2001), quoting United States v. United States\n\nGypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 92 L. Ed. 746, 766, 68 S. Ct. 525, 542 (1948).\n\n              The supreme court acknowledged, in Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 211, 886 N.E.2d\n\nat 1019, that the distinction between these three different standards of review \"ha[d] not\n\nalways been apparent in [its] case law\"; and--significantly for our purposes--the\n\nsupreme court cited Eden Retirement Center as an example of a case in which the\n\ndistinction was not apparent (Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 211, 886 N.E.2d at 1019). It follows\n\n                                            -6-\n\fthat Eden Retirement Center, on which Provena relies and on which we relied in Faith\n\nBuilders, no longer is sound authority with respect to the standard of review in\n\nadministrative-review cases in which the facts are undisputed and the law is to be\n\napplied to those facts. (Of course, since we upheld the Department's decision in Faith\n\nBuilders, the same result would have followed in that case under the more deferential\n\nclear-error standard of review.)\n\n               The facts in the present case are undisputed, and the question before us is\n\nwhether those facts entitle Covenant to an exemption under section 15-65(a) or 15-\n\n40(a)(1) (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a), 15-40(a)(1) (West 2002)). We conclude, from Cinkus,\n\nthat we should review the Department's decision for clear error. See also Calvary\n\nBaptist Church of Tilton, 349 Ill. App. 3d at 330, 812 N.E.2d at 5; Three Angels Broad-\n\ncasting Network, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, 381 Ill. App. 3d 679, 693, 885 N.E.2d\n\n554, 567 (2008); Illinois Beta House Fund Corp. v. Department of Revenue, 382 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 426, 429, 887 N.E.2d 847, 849-50 (2008); Du Page County Airport Authority v.\n\nDepartment of Revenue, 358 Ill. App. 3d 476, 484, 831 N.E.2d 30, 38 (2005).\n\n              Of course, we can apply more than one standard of review in an appeal,\n\ndepending on the issue under consideration. Insomuch as the parties disagree on the\n\nmeaning of legislation or case law, we resolve the disagreement de novo. See Cinkus,\n\n228 Ill. 2d at 210, 886 N.E.2d at 1018; City of Belvidere, 181 Ill. 2d at 205, 692 N.E.2d at\n\n302. The cases make an exception for ambiguous statutes that the agency administers:\n\nwe defer to the agency's interpretation of the ambiguous statute if the interpretation is\n\nreasonable. Illinois Bell Telephone Co. v. Illinois Commerce Comm'n, 362 Ill. App. 3d\n\n652, 657, 840 N.E.2d 704, 709 (2005).\n\n                                            -7-\n\f                        B. The Exemption for Charitable Purposes\n\n                     1. Ownership By an Institution of Public Charity\n\n              Provena had the burden of proving, \" 'clearly and conclusively,' \" its\n\nentitlement to the claimed exemptions (Illini Media Co. v. Department of Revenue, 279\n\nIll. App. 3d 432, 435, 664 N.E.2d 706, 709 (1996), quoting Chicago Bar Ass'n v. Depart-\n\nment of Revenue, 163 Ill. 2d 290, 300, 644 N.E.2d 1166, 1171 (1994)), and the Director\n\nhas to resolve all debatable questions in favor of taxation without giving an \" ' \"unrea-\n\nsonably narrow\" ' \" construction to the statute (see Illini Media, 279 Ill. App. 3d at 435,\n\n664 N.E.2d at 709, quoting People ex rel. Goodman v. University of Illinois Foundation,\n\n388 Ill. 363, 370, 58 N.E.2d 33, 37 (1944), quoting People ex rel. Pearsall v. Catholic\n\nBishop of Chicago, 311 Ill. 11, 16, 142 N.E. 520, 522 (1924)). One of the reasons why the\n\nDirector denied an exemption under section 15-65(a) (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a) (West\n\n2002)) was Provena's failure to prove, clearly and conclusively, that it was a charitable\n\ninstitution. Section 15-65(a) requires that the property in question--in this case,\n\nCovenant--be the \"property of\" an \"institution of public charity.\" 35 ILCS 200/15-65(a)\n\n(West 2002). The statute provides:\n\n                     \"All property of the following is exempt when actually\n\n              and exclusively used for charitable or beneficent purposes[]\n\n              and not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit:\n\n                            (a) Institutions of public charity.\" 35\n\n                     ILCS 200/15-65(a) (West 2002).\n\n              By contrast, section 6 of article IX of the Illinois Constitution, on its face,\n\ndoes not require ownership by a charitable organization; it merely requires that the\n\n                                             -8-\n\fproperty be \"used exclusively for *** charitable purposes.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, §6.\n\nIt provides:\n\n                      \"The General Assembly by law may exempt from\n\n               taxation only the property of the [s]tate, units of local gov-\n\n               ernment and school districts[,] and property used exclusively\n\n               for agricultural and horticultural societies[] and for school,\n\n               religious, cemetery[,] and charitable purposes. The General\n\n               Assembly by law may grant homestead exemptions or rent\n\n               credits.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, §6.\n\n               While section 6 of article IX gives the General Assembly a choice whether\n\nto exempt the classes of property listed therein (saying the General Assembly \"may\" do\n\nso), it permits the General Assembly to exempt \"only\" those classes of property. Ill.\n\nConst. 1970, art. IX, §6. Thus, the General Assembly may not broaden or add to the\n\nexemptions that section 6 of article IX allows. International College of Surgeons v.\n\nBrenza, 8 Ill. 2d 141, 145-46, 133 N.E.2d 269, 272 (1956). Because the General Assem-\n\nbly, however, may decline to grant exemptions altogether, the General Assembly, by\n\ncorollary, may restrict or limit any exemption over and above the restrictions or\n\nlimitations in section 6 of article IX. North Shore Post No. 21 of the American Legion v.\n\nKorzen, 38 Ill. 2d 231, 233, 230 N.E.2d 833, 835 (1967). (North Shore Post No. 21\n\npredates the 1970 Illinois Constitution. Nevertheless, section 6 of article IX of the 1970\n\nIllinois Constitution is merely a rephrasing of the corresponding provision, section 3 of\n\narticle IX, of the 1870 Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1870, art. IX, §3), and cases\n\ninterpreting the provision in the 1870 constitution continue to be relevant. Eden\n\n                                              -9-\n\fRetirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 286, 821 N.E.2d at 247.)\n\n              Thus, in addition to the constitutional requirement that the property be\n\nused exclusively for charitable purposes, the General Assembly has set down a further\n\nrequirement for the exemption: the property must be owned by an \"institution[] of\n\npublic charity.\" 35 ILCS 200/15-65(a) (West 2002); Chicago Patrolmen's Ass'n v.\n\nDepartment of Revenue, 171 Ill. 2d 263, 270, 664 N.E.2d 52, 55-56 (1996); Most\n\nWorshipful Grand Lodge of Ancient Free & Accepted Masons of the State of Illinois v.\n\nDepartment of Revenue, 378 Ill. App. 3d 1069, 1075, 884 N.E.2d 1168, 1173 (2007).\n\nUnder section 15-65(a), it will not suffice that the property is \"exclusively used for\n\ncharitable or beneficent purposes\" (\"beneficent\" is synonymous with \"charitable\"\n\n(People ex rel. Nelson v. Rockford Lodge No. 64, Benevolent & Protective Order of Elks,\n\n348 Ill. 528, 531, 181 N.E. 432, 433 (1932)); the owner of the property must be a\n\ncharitable organization. Chicago Patrolmen's Ass'n, 171 Ill. 2d at 270, 664 N.E.2d at 55-\n\n56).\n\n              In Methodist Old Peoples Home v. Korzen, 39 Ill. 2d 149, 157, 233 N.E.2d\n\n537, 541-42 (1968), the supreme court listed six \"distinctive characteristics of a charita-\n\nble institution\": (1) the institution bestows benefits upon an indefinite number of\n\npersons for their general welfare, or the benefits in some way reduce the burdens on\n\ngovernment; (2) the institution has no capital, capital stock, or shareholders and does\n\nnot profit from the enterprise; (3) the funds of the institution are derived mainly from\n\nprivate and public charity and are held in trust for the purposes expressed in the\n\ncharter; (4) charity is dispensed to all who need it and apply for it; (5) the institution\n\nputs no obstacles in the way of those seeking the charitable benefits; and (6) the primary\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\fuse of the property is for charitable purposes. See also Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill.\n\n2d at 287, 821 N.E.2d at 248 (deriving those six factors from Methodist Old Peoples\n\nHome); Most Worshipful Grand Lodge, 378 Ill. App. 3d at 1075, 884 N.E.2d at 1173\n\n(same).\n\n              Courts also have applied the six factors to the issue of charitable use, i.e.,\n\nwhether the property was \"exclusively used for charitable or beneficent purposes\" (35\n\nILCS 200/15-65(a) (West 2006)). Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 287, 821\n\nN.E.2d at 248; Most Worshipful Grand Lodge, 378 Ill. App. 3d at 1075, 884 N.E.2d at\n\n1173; Lutheran General Health Care System v. Department of Revenue, 231 Ill. App. 3d\n\n652, 657, 595 N.E.2d 1214, 1218 (1992). The factors lend themselves more readily to\n\nassessing the charitable nature of the owner--indeed, the supreme court originally\n\ndescribed the factors as the \"distinctive characteristics of a charitable institution\"\n\n(Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at 157, 233 N.E.2d at 541). Applying the six\n\nfactors to the question of charitable use can be awkward if only because the sixth factor\n\nsquarely poses the question of charitable use (Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at\n\n287, 821 N.E.2d at 248 (\"(6) *** exclusive, i.e., primary, use of the property is for\n\ncharitable purposes\")), suggesting that the preceding five factors address some other\n\nquestion. Nevertheless, some of the factors do describe how property is used for\n\ncharitable purposes, i.e., bestowing benefits upon an indefinite number of persons,\n\nlessening the burdens on government, dispensing charity to all who need it and apply\n\nfor it, and putting no obstacles in their way (Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at\n\n157, 233 N.E.2d at 541-42).\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 11 -\n\f              Part of the difficulty with the factors in Methodist Old Peoples Home (and,\n\nfor that matter, with any set of factors) is discerning how important any one factor is\n\ncompared to another. The First District has said that \"[t]he factors outlined by the\n\nsupreme court in [Methodist Old Peoples Home] are guidelines rather than definitive\n\nrequirements.\" Arts Club of Chicago v. Department of Revenue, 334 Ill. App. 3d 235,\n\n243, 777 N.E.2d 700, 707 (2002). That cannot be correct. Some of the factors are more\n\nthan guidelines. The sixth factor is that the property be used exclusively for charitable\n\npurposes, and under the constitution and statute, exclusive use for charitable purposes\n\nis the sine qua non of the exemption (Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, §6; 35 ILCS 200/15-65(a)\n\n(West 2006)). The supreme court has called the factors \"guidelines or criteria.\" Eden\n\nRetirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 287, 821 N.E.2d at 248. Apparently, the only way of\n\ntelling which factors are guidelines and which are essential criteria is to see how they are\n\ntreated in case law. The factors are old--Methodist Old Peoples Home dates from 1968,\n\nand it relied on cases going back 75 years (Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at\n\n156-57, 233 N.E.2d at 541-42)--and it appears that one of the factors at issue, namely,\n\ncharitable funding of the institution (Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 287, 821\n\nN.E.2d at 248), has waned in importance. But the other factors, or at least the ones at\n\nissue in this appeal, still seem to be in force.\n\n              If we credit the Department's argument, it would not matter that some of\n\nthe factors had grown obsolete, for, according to the Department, Provena satisfies only\n\none of the six factors: it has no capital, capital stock, or shareholders, and, as a corpora-\n\ntion, it does not profit from the enterprise (see Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d\n\nat 157, 233 N.E.2d at 541). Clearly, not-for-profit status alone does not confer an\n\n                                             - 12 -\n\fexemption under section 15-65(a). Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 290, 821\n\nN.E.2d at 250; People ex rel. County Collector v. Hopedale Medical Foundation, 46 Ill.\n\n2d 450, 464, 264 N.E.2d 4, 11 (1970). We will consider the remaining five factors in\n\nturn.\n\n                a. Benefits to an Indefinite Number of People for Their\n             General Welfare So as To Reduce the Burdens on Government\n\n              The first factor from Methodist Old Peoples Home is that \"the benefits\n\nderived are for an indefinite number of persons for their general welfare or [they] in\n\nsome way reduc[e] the burdens on government.\" Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at\n\n287, 821 N.E.2d at 248. This factor is more than a guideline; it describes what a charity\n\nessentially is. \"The fundamental ground upon which all exemptions in favor of charita-\n\nble institutions are based is the benefit conferred upon the public by them and a\n\nconsequent relief, to some extent, of the burden upon the State to care for[,] and\n\nadvance the interests of[,] its citizens.\" School of Domestic Arts & Science v. Carr, 322\n\nIll. 562, 569, 153 N.E. 669, 671 (1926); see also In re Estate of Graves, 242 Ill. 23, 28, 89\n\nN.E. 672, 674 (1909) (\"It would clearly be within the province of the park commission-\n\ners to erect drinking fountains or basins for horses\" such as the one the testator pro-\n\nvided for by charitable bequest). To be for a charitable use or purpose, the gift must be a\n\npublic, rather than a private, gift (14 C.J.S. Charities §10, at 182 (2006); Restatement\n\n(Second) of Trusts §§375, 376, (1959)); it must be \"'general benevolence'\" rather than\n\n\" 'personal bounty to particular individuals' \" (Saltonstall v. Sanders, 93 Mass. (11 Allen)\n\n446, 466 (1865), quoting Attorney General v. Comber, 2 Sim. & Stu. 93 (1824)). For\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 13 -\n\fexample, \"[a] gift to poor relations or for their benefit is a private gift, although it would\n\nprevent their becoming a public charge.\" 14 C.J.S. Charities §13, at 185 (2006).\n\n              Obviously, Provena--basically, a conglomerate of hospitals--was not\n\nformed to bestow a private gift upon particular individuals, such as \"poor relations.\" It\n\nis far from obvious, however, that Provena is a gift to the public. As we will discuss at\n\ngreater length below, it is unclear to what extent Provena exercises \"general benevo-\n\nlence\" as opposed to doing what a for-profit hospital does: selling medical services.\n\nProvena argues it lessens the burdens of government because if not for the existence of\n\nCovenant, Champaign County would have to build a hospital. The supreme court has\n\nheld, however, that \"services extended *** for value received *** do not relieve the\n\n[s]tate of its burden.\" Willows v. Munson, 43 Ill. 2d 203, 208, 251 N.E.2d 249, 252\n\n(1969). See also People ex rel. Nordlund v. Ass'n of the Winnebago Home for the Aged,\n\n40 Ill. 2d 91, 101, 237 N.E.2d 533, 539 (1968); 14 C.J.S. Charities §3, at 177 (2006)\n\n(\"Whatever is gratuitously done for the advancement of the public good is a public\n\ncharity\"); D. Hyman, The Conundrum of Charitability: Reassessing Tax Exemption for\n\nHospitals, 16 Am. J.L. & Med. 327, 378 (1990) (\"Reduced to its elements, one must\n\nsimply be in the hospital 'business' and not distribute any profit in order to meet the\n\nliberal test [for exemption]. This is rather curious because *** for-profit hospitals are\n\nalso in the hospital business. The inurement constraint alone is not sufficient reason to\n\ngrant favorable tax treatment to one institution and not the other\").\n\n                b. Funds Derived Mainly From Private and Public Charity\n\n              The third factor from Methodist Old Peoples Home (again, the second\n\nfactor is not at issue) is that \"funds are derived mainly from private and public charity[]\n\n                                            - 14 -\n\fand the funds are held in trust for the objects and purposes expressed in the organiza-\n\ntion's charter.\" Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 287, 821 N.E.2d at 248.\n\nThe Director stated in his decision:\n\n                     \"[I]f we look at the financial picture of Covenant's\n\n              parent, we see that for Provena Hospital's year end[ing]\n\n              December 31, 2002, [the] 'Consolidated Statement of Opera-\n\n              tions Information' shows other revenue of $25,382,000,\n\n              which is 3.4% of total revenue of $739,293,000. It is impos-\n\n              sible to tell how much of the 3.4% of other revenue [was]\n\n              derived from public and private charity because there is no\n\n              further breakdown of this amount in the statement. [Cita-\n\n              tion to record.] As discussed previously, the record in this\n\n              case is very limited in evidence concerning how Provena\n\n              Hospitals, the owner of the property, qualifies as a charitable\n\n              organization. If the entire 3.4% of 'other revenue' in Provena\n\n              Hospital's statement was derived from public and private\n\n              charity, I still would not be able to conclude that Provena\n\n              Hospitals meets the [Methodist Old Peoples Home] guide-\n\n              line that it derives its funds mainly from public and private\n\n              charity.\"\n\n              In American College of Surgeons v. Korzen, 36 Ill. 2d 340, 348, 224\n\nN.E.2d 7, 11 (1967), overruled on other grounds by Christian Action Ministry v. Depart-\n\nment of Local Government Affairs, 74 Ill. 2d 51, 57, 383 N.E.2d 958, 961 (1978), the\n\n                                           - 15 -\n\ftaxing authority argued that the college was not a charitable organization because\n\napproximately half of its funds came from members' dues. The supreme court held:\n\n                     \"A careful reading of the cases indicates that while the\n\n              source of funds is listed as a characteristic of a charitable\n\n              organization, each [case] concerns itself primarily with\n\n              discovery of the facts relative to the use to which the funds\n\n              are put. *** [W]here it is established that the funds and\n\n              property are devoted to public purposes, the source of the\n\n              funds is not the sole determinant factor.\" American College,\n\n              36 Ill. 2d at 348, 224 N.E.2d at 11.\n\nIt appears that funding by charitable donations can help to establish the identity of an\n\ninstitution as charitable (Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 287, 821 N.E.2d at 248;\n\nJ. Colombo, Hospital Property Tax Exemption in Illinois: Exploring the Policy Gaps, 37\n\nLoy. U. Chi. L.J. 493, 519 (2006)) but such funding is not essential (American College,\n\n36 Ill. 2d at 348, 224 N.E.2d at 11). \"Recent data shows that, overall, nonprofit hospitals\n\nreceive less than 2% of their revenues from private philanthropy.\" 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at\n\n520. Making the absence of such funding dispositive would effectively end the charita-\n\nble exemption for nonprofit hospitals. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 520. In Sisters of the\n\nThird Order of St. Francis v. Board of Review, 231 Ill. 317, 321, 83 N.E. 272, 273 (1907),\n\nthe supreme court seemed to approve of a hospital's practice of subsidizing the medical\n\ncare of the poor by charging patients who were able to pay. But see M. Bloche, Health\n\nPolicy Below the Waterline: Medical Care and the Charitable Exemption, 80 Minn. L.\n\nRev. 299, 355 (1995) (\"the imagery of charity rings hollow when it comes to hospitals.\n\n                                            - 16 -\n\fMost obviously, the free care provided by nonprofit hospitals is financed largely by\n\nprivate payers, who are hardly inspired by donative benevolence\"); 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J.\n\nat 519 (theoretically, \"donations are an excellent 'signal' that the public views a particu-\n\nlar entity as undertaking charitable activities,\" and, therefore, \"an excellent conceptual\n\nreason exists to use donations as a measure of an entity's 'charitable-ness' \"). Thus,\n\nhaving an operating income derived almost entirely from contractual charges goes\n\nagainst a charitable identity (Small v. Pangle, 60 Ill. 2d 510, 517, 328 N.E.2d 285, 288-\n\n89 (1975)), but this factor, by itself, is not dispositive (American College, 36 Ill. 2d at\n\n348, 224 N.E.2d at 11).\n\n               c. Providing Charity to All Who Need It and Apply for It and\n               Refraining from Interposing Any Obstacles to Such Charity\n\n              The fourth factor from Methodist Old Peoples Home is that \"charity is\n\ndispensed to all who need [it] and apply for it,\" and the fifth factor, closely related to the\n\npreceding one, is that \"no obstacles are placed in the way of those seeking the benefits.\"\n\nEden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 287, 821 N.E.2d at 248. The Director found as\n\nfollows:\n\n                      \"*** I find that the record contains no information as\n\n              to Provena Hospital's charitable expenditures in 2002.\n\n              According to the ALJ in her Recommendation for Disposi-\n\n              tion, '[t]he testimony indicated, and the advertisements,\n\n              collection practices, and other documents support the find-\n\n              ing[,] that Covenant's policies and practices are the same as\n\n              those of the owner of the property,' Provena Hospitals.\n\n\n\n                                             - 17 -\n\f              [Citation to ALJ's recommended decision.] Without infor-\n\n              mation about Provena's expenditures for charitable care in\n\n              2002, it is not possible to conclude that the true owner of the\n\n              property is a charitable institution[,] as required by Illinois\n\n              law.\"\n\n              A charity dispenses charity and does not obstruct the path to its charitable\n\nbenefits. Eden Retirement Center, 213 Ill. 2d at 287, 821 N.E.2d at 248. Provena and\n\nthe amici curiae disagree with the Department on the meaning of \" 'charity.' \" As one of\n\nthe amici curiae, the Illinois Hospital Association, observes, \"charity\" can have different\n\nmeanings depending on whether an article precedes it: a charity is an organization,\n\nwhereas charity is what the organization dispenses. Quoting Methodist Old Peoples\n\nHome, 39 Ill. 2d at 156, 233 N.E.2d at 541, the Department argues that \"charity is a gift\"\n\nand unless we know how much charity care Provena provides through its six hospitals,\n\nwe cannot make a valid generalization that Provena is a charitable institution. The\n\nIllinois Hospital Association argues the Department is distorting the meaning of\n\nMethodist Old Peoples Home by omitting, from its quotation of that case, the indefinite\n\narticle that precedes \"charity\": the supreme court said, in Methodist Old Peoples Home,\n\n39 Ill. 2d at 156, 233 N.E.2d at 541, that \"a charity is a gift\" (emphasis added). The\n\nphrase comes ultimately from a Massachusetts case, which the supreme court first\n\nquoted in Crerar v. Williams, 145 Ill. 625, 34 N.E. 467 (1893), as follows:\n\n                      \"A comprehensive legal definition of a charity, or\n\n              charitable use, is given by Gray, J., in Jackson v. Phillips, 14\n\n              Allen, 556 (approved by Perry in his work on Trusts, vol. 2,\n\n                                            - 18 -\n\f              sec. 697) as follows: 'A charity, in [the] legal sense, may be\n\n              more fully defined as a gift, to be applied consistently with\n\n              existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of\n\n              persons, either by bringing their *** hearts under the influ-\n\n              ence of education or religion[;] by relieving their bodies from\n\n              disease, suffering[,] or constraint[;] by assisting them to\n\n              establish themselves [in] life[;] or by erecting or maintaining\n\n              public buildings or works[] or otherwise lessening the\n\n              burthens of government. It is immaterial whether the pur-\n\n              pose is called charitable in the gift itself, if it is so described\n\n              as to show that it is charitable in its nature.' \" (Emphases\n\n              added.) Crerar, 145 Ill. at 643, 34 N.E. at 470, quoting Jack-\n\n              son v. Phillips, 96 Mass. (14 Allen) 539, 556 (1867).\n\n              According to the Illinois Hospital Association, the phrase \"a charity is a\n\ngift\" has to do solely with how a charitable organization comes into existence--by some\n\nperson or group of persons making a charitable gift to the community for the purpose of\n\nestablishing a hospital--and does not require that the charity, after its inception, give\n\nanything away. Provena argues it is a charitable organization because it provides\n\nmedical care, which, according to Crerar, is a charitable purpose--\" 'relieving *** bodies\n\nfrom disease, suffering[,] or constraint.' \" Crerar, 145 Ill. at 643, 34 N.E. at 470, quoting\n\nJackson, 96 Mass. (14 Allen) at 556.\n\n              By the logic of Provena and the Illinois Hospital Association, the only\n\ngiving that matters, for purposes of charity, is the gift by which the founders established\n\n                                             - 19 -\n\fthe hospital, whenever that occurred. A hospital thereafter could practice economic\n\npredation and nevertheless maintain its charitable status. It seems to us that confining\n\nthe gift to the establishment of the hospital would make the gift dubious. If a patient,\n\nlike virtually all the other patients, must agree to pay for his or her medical care, the\n\npatient receives a gift only in the rarefied form of an opportunity to purchase medical\n\ncare locally. A new Wal-Mart would be a gift in a comparable sense--with the added\n\nbonus that it would pay property taxes. And if the medical bill includes a charge for the\n\ndepreciation of assets, the gift becomes even more tenuous. Unlike Wal-Mart, a not-for-\n\nprofit hospital would plow any profits back into the hospital, becoming bigger and better\n\nequipped. But, again, from the perspective of paying patients, the gift merely would be\n\nthe enhanced opportunities to enter into increasingly expensive contractual relation-\n\nships with the hospital and its physicians. In Crerar, 145 Ill. at 643-44, 34 N.E. at 470, a\n\ncase Provena cites for the proposition that relieving bodies from suffering is, per se,\n\ncharity, the testator made \"a gift 'for the erection, creation, maintenance[,] and endow-\n\nment of a free public library.' \" (Emphasis added.)\n\n              If medical care, free or not, were charity in and of itself, the only difference\n\nbetween a charitable hospital and a for-profit hospital would be the \"inurement con-\n\nstraint\" (16 Am. J.L. & Med. at 378), and the supreme court made clear in Hopedale\n\nMedical Foundation, 46 Ill. 2d at 464, 264 N.E.2d at 11 (discussing federal and state\n\nexemptions based on inurement), that the inurement constraint implicit in the exemp-\n\ntion from federal and state income taxation alone will not exempt a hospital from\n\nproperty taxation. One commentator asks rhetorically, \"Would one ever allow a dry\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 20 -\n\fcleaner or shoe store with an inurement prohibition to qualify for tax exemption?\" 16\n\nAm. J.L. & Med. at 378.\n\n              By holding medical care to be, in and of itself, charity, we effectively would\n\nexcuse charitable hospitals from their ongoing mission of giving. We would hold that a\n\nhospital is being charitable, for instance, when it sends an impoverished patient a bill\n\nthat the patient could never hope to pay. That holding not only would create a deafen-\n\ning cognitive dissonance, but it would ignore the supreme court's repeated rationale in\n\ncases involving charitable hospitals. If, as Provena claims, charity did not entail treating\n\npatients for free, a case the supreme court decided only a year after Sisters of the Third\n\nOrder would make no sense. In German Hospital of Chicago v. Board of Review, 233 Ill.\n\n246, 248-50, 84 N.E. 215, 216 (1908), the supreme court emphasized the number of\n\npatients the hospital treated for free or at reduced rates and, on that basis, held Sisters\n\nof the Third Order to be directly on point and the hospital to be a public charity exempt\n\nfrom taxation.\n\n              Provena interprets Sisters of the Third Order as meaning that the number\n\nof charity care patients does not matter. We do not read the case that way. In Sisters of\n\nthe Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 273-74, the Board of Review of Peoria County\n\nargued that St. Francis Hospital was not an institution of public charity because of \"the\n\ngreat disparity between the number of charity patients and those who pay for the care\n\nand attention they receive at this institution.\" If Provena were correct--if all a charitable\n\nhospital had to do was provide medical care because medical care was, ipso facto,\n\ncharity--the supreme court surely would have answered the board of review's argument\n\nby saying it did not matter how many patients St. Francis Hospital treated for free\n\n                                            - 21 -\n\fbecause all medical care, compensated or not, was charity. But that is not what the\n\nsupreme court said. Rather, it said: \"This objection seems to us without merit, so long\n\nas charity was dispensed to all those who needed it and who applied therefor ***.\"\n\nSisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 274. Clearly, in this context,\n\n\"charity\" does not mean compensated medical care; it means uncompensated medical\n\ncare. Further, the corollary seems to be that if St. Francis Hospital had failed to provide\n\nfree treatment to those who needed it and applied for it, the board of review's objection\n\nwould have had merit: the hospital would not have been an institution of public charity.\n\n              In Winnebago Home, the unsuccessful applicant for exemption was, like\n\nProvena, in the business of relieving bodies from disease, suffering, and constraint.\n\n\"Upon accepting a resident, the association obligate[d] itself to provide him with a\n\nhome, medical care, food, and, according to the testimony of one witness, a 'Christian\n\nburial.' \" Winnebago Home, 40 Ill. 2d at 97-98, 237 N.E.2d at 537. If Provena were\n\ncorrect--if relieving bodies from disease, suffering, and constraint qualified as charity\n\neven though the relieving resulted in a bill for the persons getting relieved--the defen-\n\ndant in Winnebago Home would have received an exemption. But that is not what\n\nhappened. The supreme court held:\n\n                     \"[The] [d]efendant's insistence upon the payment of a\n\n              sizable admission fee, the assignment by a resident of his\n\n              assets[,] and the health requirements imposed[] constitute\n\n              an even more serious impediment to the tax exempt status it\n\n              seeks. We find that these provisions cannot be reconciled\n\n              with our requirements of the application of benefits to an\n\n                                            - 22 -\n\f              indefinite number of people, dispensing charity to all who\n\n              need and apply for it[,] and not appearing to place obstacles\n\n              of any character in the way of those who need and would\n\n              avail themselves of the benefits defendant provides.\"\n\n              Winnebago Home, 40 Ill. 2d at 101, 237 N.E.2d at 539.\n\nLike Provena, the defendant in Winnebago Home, 40 Ill. 2d at 101-02, 237 N.E.2d at\n\n539, compared itself to St. Francis Hospital in Sisters of the Third Order and Southern\n\nIllinois Hospital in People ex rel. Cannon v. Southern Illinois Hospital Corp., 404 Ill. 66,\n\n88 N.E.2d 20 (1949). But the supreme court rejected the comparison precisely because\n\n\"in the case of the hospitals[,] many impoverished persons were readily admitted and\n\ncared for without charge.\" (Emphasis added.) Winnebago Home, 40 Ill. 2d at 102, 237\n\nN.E.2d at 539. These words do not leave us with the impression that the supreme court\n\nis indifferent about the number of impoverished persons an allegedly charitable\n\norganization serves free of charge. If, as Provena and the Illinois Association of Hospi-\n\ntals maintain, medical care is, per se, charity and the medical care does not have to be\n\nfree because the only gift that matters is the gift establishing the hospital, the supreme\n\ncourt would not have distinguished Sisters of the Third Order and Cannon by observing\n\nthat in those cases, \"many\" patients were \"cared for without charge.\" See also Willows,\n\n43 Ill. 2d at 208, 251 N.E.2d at 252 (contrasting \"dispensing charity\" with selling\n\nservices). Also, the supreme court would not have minded that the defendant in\n\nWinnebago Home had \"allocated from its sizable holdings only sufficient funds to\n\nprovide for one needy applicant.\" Winnebago Home, 40 Ill. 2d at 102, 237 N.E.2d at\n\n539-40.\n\n                                           - 23 -\n\f              We conclude that not only is a charity a gift (Quad Cities Open, Inc. v. City\n\nof Silvis, 208 Ill. 2d 498, 510-11, 804 N.E.2d 499, 507 (2004)) but that charity is a gift\n\n(People ex rel. Ryan v. World Church of the Creator, 198 Ill. 2d 115, 128, 760 N.E.2d 953,\n\n961 (2001); Ould v. Washington Hospital for Foundlings, 95 U.S. 303, 311, 24 L. Ed.\n\n450, 451 (1877)). \"Charity\" is an act of kindness or benevolence. Graves, 242 Ill. at 27,\n\n89 N.E. at 673. There is nothing particularly kind or benevolent about selling somebody\n\nsomething. \"Charity\" is \"generosity and helpfulness[,] esp[ecially] toward the needy or\n\nsuffering\" (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 192 (10th ed. 2000))--not merely\n\nhelpfulness, note, but generosity. \"Generosity\" means \"liber[ality] in giving.\" Merriam-\n\nWebster's Collegiate Dictionary 484 (10th ed. 2000). To be charitable, an institution\n\nmust give liberally. Removing giving from charity would debase the meaning of charity,\n\nand we resist such an assault upon language. See C. Borek, Decoupling Tax Exemption\n\nfor Charitable Organizations, 31 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 183, 187 (2004) (\"the 'legal'\n\nmeaning [of 'charitable'] has so stretched the term beyond its etymological boundaries\n\nas to render the concept vacant, unoccupied by any useful legal notion of what 'charita-\n\nble' means\"). The fourth and fifth factors in Methodist Old Peoples Home--dispensing\n\ncharity to all who need it and apply for it and placing no obstacles in their way--are\n\nmore than guidelines; they are essential criteria; they go to the heart of what it means to\n\nbe a charitable institution.\n\n              As the Director observed, the record appears to contain no evidence of the\n\namount of charity that Provena dispensed in 2002. Insomuch as the Director found this\n\ndeficiency of proof to be fatal to Provena's status as a charitable institution, we are not\n\nleft with a definite and firm conviction that he was mistaken.\n\n                                            - 24 -\n\f                2. \"Exclusive\" Use of the Property for Charitable Purposes\n\n         a. The Impossibility of Making a Gift, and Thereby Performing Charity,\n                  Without Foregoing Compensation for the Thing Given\n\n              Provena admits that \"charity is a 'gift.' \" (Provena puts the word in\n\nquotation marks.) But Provena contends that \"[the] 'gift' is not limited, as the Depart-\n\nment claims, to free goods or services.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n\n              On the contrary, a gift is, by definition, free goods or services: \"something\n\nvoluntarily transferred by one person to another without compensation\" (Merriam-\n\nWebster's Collegiate Dictionary 491 (10th ed. 2000)). Defining \"gift\" in any other way\n\nwould do violence to the meaning of the word. One can make a gift by charging nothing\n\nat all. Or one can make a gift by undercharging a person, that is, charging less than\n\none's cost (using cost as a baseline prevents the creation of an artificial gift through\n\ninflation of prices (37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511-12)), and in that case, part of the goods or\n\nservices is given without compensation. See German Hospital, 233 Ill. at 248, 84 N.E. at\n\n216 (\"a large proportion of the entire number of patients received are treated either free\n\nor at less than actual cost\").\n\n              Provena quotes People v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n of Chicago, 365 Ill.\n\n118, 122, 6 N.E.2d 166, 169 (1936): \"'Charity,' in law, is not confined *** to mere\n\nalmsgiving.\" That is true. But it is confined to giving. Charity is a gift, and one can give\n\na gift to a rich person as well as to a poor person, the object being \"the improvement and\n\npromotion of the happiness of man.\" Congregational Sunday School & Publishing\n\nSociety v. Board of Review, 290 Ill. 108, 113, 125 N.E. 7, 9-10 (1919). For example, out of\n\nkindness and benevolence, one could build a water fountain in a park, and rich and poor\n\n\n\n                                            - 25 -\n\falike could come and drink. But the designation of \"charity\" would be problematic if the\n\nwater fountain were coin-operated. Regardless of whether the recipient of the goods or\n\nservices is rich or poor or somewhere in between, it is nonsensical to say one has given a\n\ngift to that person, or that one has been charitable, by billing that person for the full cost\n\nof the goods or services--whether the goods or services be medical or otherwise. For a\n\ngift (and, therefore, charity) to occur, something of value must be given for free.\n\n              In the cases on which Provena relies--Young Men's Christian Ass'n; Quad\n\nCities Open; Cannon; and Sisters of the Third Order--the institutions claiming a tax\n\nexemption charged fees as a means of financing charity care and other charitable gifts,\n\nor they charged fees no higher than the poor could afford. In Young Men's Christian\n\nAss'n, 365 Ill. at 123-24, 6 N.E.2d at 170, the supreme court said:\n\n              \"The rates [the Young Men's Christian Association of Chi-\n\n              cago] charged for its rooms are not based, alone, on the cost\n\n              of the service rendered, but the object of the appellee is to\n\n              furnish wholesome living conditions to young men at a price\n\n              they can afford to pay and thereby correct the social evils\n\n              that surround men who would otherwise be compelled to live\n\n              in cheap rooming houses, amid sordid environments.\"\n\nThe record appears to contain no evidence that, in 2002, Covenant billed its patients\n\nonly as much as they could afford to pay or that Covenant was, financially or otherwise,\n\na kinder and gentler alternative to for-profit hospitals. See J. Colombo, The Role of\n\nAccess in Charitable Tax Exemption, 82 Wash. U. L.Q. 343, 344 (2004) (\"a number of\n\nempirical studies *** generally have found that *** private nonprofit, tax-exempt\n\n                                            - 26 -\n\fhospitals do not operate much differently from for-profit counterparts in similar\n\ngeographic areas. These studies confirm that the levels of 'uncompensated care' differ\n\nlittle between exempt and for-profit providers; that the range of services provided by\n\nboth are similar; and that under current measures of quality assessment[,] there is little\n\ndifference between the two\").\n\n              In Quad Cities Open, 208 Ill. 2d at 501, 804 N.E.2d at 501, a not-for-profit\n\ncorporation operated an annual golf tournament. The corporation sold admission\n\ntickets for the tournament, and the proceeds from the tickets, less overhead, went to\n\ncharities such as American Red Cross and Special Olympics. Quad Cities Open, 208 Ill.\n\n2d at 501, 804 N.E.2d at 501. \"Charitable events often demand[ed] that a portion of the\n\nrevenue be devoted to overhead costs in order to make the event possible.\" Quad Cities\n\nOpen, 208 Ill. 2d at 516, 804 N.E.2d at 510. For example, to hold a tournament, prize\n\nmoney was needed for golfers, and funds were needed for cart paths, grandstands,\n\nconcession stands, scoreboards, and water wells. Quad Cities Open, 208 Ill. 2d at 502-\n\n03, 804 N.E.2d at 502. Although only 7% of the corporation's revenue between 1998\n\nand 2000 went to charity, it was plausible that the corporation had to incur 93% of\n\noverhead in order to generate the 7% of profit for charity. Quad Cities Open, 208 Ill. 2d\n\nat 515-16, 804 N.E.2d at 509-10. As the supreme court said, \"[a] charity is not defined\n\nby percentages.\" Quad Cities Open, 208 Ill. 2d at 516, 804 N.E.2d at 509. But it does\n\nnot follow that percentages are irrelevant. The disparity between overhead and charita-\n\nble expenditures can be so extreme that it would be disingenuous to maintain that such\n\na vast amount of overhead was incurred for the purpose of generating such a minuscule\n\namount of charity. See Winnebago Home, 40 Ill. 2d at 102, 237 N.E.2d at 539-40. The\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\fDirector could be skeptical that Covenant's raison d'etre was the 0.7% of its revenue that\n\nit devoted to charity care.\n\n              The other two cases, Cannon and Sisters of the Third Order, at least\n\ninvolve hospitals, but they are distinguishable because all patients who were unable to\n\npay received charity: \" 'charity was dispensed to all those who needed it' \" (Cannon, 404\n\nIll. at 72, 88 N.E.2d at 23, quoting Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at\n\n274). In Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 320, 83 N.E. at 273, \"[t]hose who [were]\n\nwithout money or property [were] cared for without charge,\" and \"[t]hose who [were]\n\nable to pay [were] charged from $8 to $25 per week\" so as to finance the care of the 5%\n\nof the patients who were unable to pay (Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 320, 83\n\nN.E. at 273). Because Provena's charity care program in 2002 considered only the\n\npatient's income relative to the federal poverty guidelines without considering the\n\namount of the medical bill or the patient's other liabilities and Covenant devoted only\n\n0.7% of its revenue to charity care, the Director could regard the program merely as a\n\npretense of charity, a pro forma procedure that was not calculated to make a serious\n\nevaluation of need. Although Provena proved that it turned no patient away, it did not\n\nprove that \"[t]hose who [were] without money or property [were] cared for without\n\ncharge\" (Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 320, 83 N.E. at 273)--or so the Director\n\nreasonably could have found.\n\n               b. The Relevance of Percentages, Despite the Impossibility\n                       of an Across-the-Board \"Quantitative Test\"\n\n              In denying an exemption under section 15-65(a) (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a)\n\n(West 2002)), the Director stated as follows:\n\n\n\n                                            - 28 -\n\f             \"The primary basis of my conclusion is simple: Covenant\n\n             admitted that its 2002 revenues exceeded $113,000,000 and\n\n             that its charitable activities cost it only $831,724, or about\n\n             0.7% of total revenue. The property tax exemption it re-\n\n             quested was worth over $1,100,000. *** [T]o obtain the\n\n             exemption, Covenant was required to prove that its primary\n\n             purpose was charitable care. These financial figures fall\n\n             short of meeting the primary purpose standard.\"\n\nProvena argues as follows:\n\n             \"[T]he Department's insistence on a quantitative test is\n\n             simply indefensible. No [s]upreme [c]ourt decision adopts a\n\n             quantitative approach. No quantitative element appears\n\n             anywhere in the [Methodist Old Peoples Home] analysis.\n\n             And the [s]upreme [c]ourt has never pinned entitlement to a\n\n             charitable exemption on how much free care (or free any-\n\n             thing) an organization provides. On the contrary, the [c]ourt\n\n             has rejected such a quantitative test of charity at every op-\n\n             portunity. See, e.g., Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at\n\n             320, 322[,] [83 N.E.2d at 273-74] (rejecting the claim that\n\n             5% free patient care was too insubstantial to justify exemp-\n\n             tion); Quad Cities Open ***, 208 Ill. 2d [at] 515-516[,] [804\n\n             N.E.2d at 509] (same result for claim that 7% was insuffi-\n\n             cient to qualify as a charity).\" (Emphasis in original.)\n\n                                           - 29 -\n\f              Section 6 of article IX does not speak of percentages; it speaks of \"exclu-\n\nsive use\" (Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, §6), which courts have interpreted as \"primary use,\"\n\nand the primary use of property is quintessentially a factual question. Whether property\n\nis exempt from taxation is highly dependent on the facts of each case. Lawrenceville v.\n\nMaxwell, 6 Ill. 2d 42, 48, 126 N.E.2d 671, 675 (1955). The Illinois Hospital Association\n\nsays: \"[T]he Department does not disclose the percentage that is required, only that\n\nProvena's is not enough.\" The point is valid, but the \"percentage that is required\" was\n\nnot strictly necessary to the Director's decision, any more than it was necessary to the\n\nsupreme court's decision when it criticized the defendant in Winnebago Home, 40 Ill.\n\n2d at 102, 237 N.E.2d at 539-40, for allocating \"only sufficient funds to provide for one\n\nneedy applicant.\"\n\n              A scholar criticizes the uncertainty Illinois law causes by its failure to\n\nmandate a particular percentage of charity care. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 514. But coming\n\nup with a fixed percentage, applicable to all charitable hospitals, would be problematic.\n\nAs the supreme court long has held, a charitable institution may charge a fee to those\n\nwho are able to pay. Winnebago Home, 40 Ill. 2d at 101, 237 N.E.2d at 539. For most\n\nhospitals, charging patients who are able to pay is, as a practical matter, a necessity.\n\nGiven the permissibility and necessity of charging those who are able to pay, the amount\n\nof charity care a hospital provides may depend on how many impoverished people seek\n\ntreatment. Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 274 (\"The institution\n\ncould not extend its benefactions to those who did not need them or to those who did\n\nnot seek admission\"). As the Illinois Hospital Association explains, how many impover-\n\nished people seek treatment in turn would depend on a number of highly variable\n\n                                            - 30 -\n\ffactors, to which an across-the-board, fixed percentage would be unsuitable, e.g., the\n\ntype of hospital, local demographics, public health, the economy, the cost of medical\n\ncare, and the cost and availability of medical insurance.\n\n              Thus, in Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 273-74, the\n\n\"great disparity\" between the patients who paid and the patients who were treated for\n\nfree did not necessarily negate the primary purpose of charity. It was conceivable that\n\nonly 11% of the patients who sought admission were unable to pay (5% of which the\n\nhospital treated for free and the other 6% of which the hospital treated at the county's\n\nexpense (Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 320, 83 N.E. at 273)).\n\n              The wide variability of need from one community to another did not\n\nprevent the supreme court from considering percentages or numbers in Sisters of the\n\nThird Order, 231 Ill. at 320, 83 N.E. at 273, and German Hospital, 233 Ill. at 248-49, 84\n\nN.E. at 216. In the latter case especially, the supreme court discussed at great length\n\n\"the facts found and certified in tabular form by the board of review as to the number of\n\npatients received each year during the past five years, the number treated free, [and] the\n\nnumber treated [at various discounted rates],\" and the supreme court observed that \"a\n\nlarge proportion of the entire number of patients received are treated either free or at\n\nless than actual cost.\" German Hospital, 233 Ill. at 248, 84 N.E. at 216.\n\n              Common sense suggests that the number of charity patients a hospital\n\nactually serves has direct relevance to one of the factors in Methodist Old Peoples\n\nHomes, 39 Ill. 2d at 157, 233 N.E.2d at 542, namely, whether the hospital \"dispenses\n\ncharity to all who need and apply for it.\" Charity is more than rhetoric. The term\n\n\"charitable purpose\" signifies \"concrete, practical, objective charity, manifested by\n\n                                           - 31 -\n\fthings actually done for the relief of the unfortunate and the alleviation of suffering or in\n\nsome work of practical philanthropy.\" In re Estate of Schureman, 8 Ill. 2d 125, 132-133,\n\n133 N.E.2d 7, 11 (1956).\n\n              As the millions of Americans who cannot afford health insurance would\n\nattest, hospitals afford ample opportunities for \"some work of practical philanthropy\"--\n\nand nothing is more practical than numbers. Medical care has become ruinously\n\nexpensive. The cost of a hospital stay has been outpacing inflation for many years.\n\n\"Between 1971 and 1981, the cost of a hospital day increased 15[%] annually.\" J. Lane,\n\nThe Impact of the Medicare Prospective Payment System and Recommendations for\n\nChange, 7 Yale J. on Reg. 499, 501 (1990). \"Estimated health care costs for 2005 exceed\n\n$1.9 trillion, a 48% increase over the $1.3 trillion spent in 2000. These costs are nearly\n\n4.3 times higher than our national defense spending and have been rising at least 50%\n\nfaster than the rate of inflation. Further, inpatient hospital costs have increased almost\n\n50% in the last decade ***.\" Fifth Annual Health Law & Policy Colloquium: Provider\n\nResponse to Cost Containment: An Insider Perspective, 15 Annals Health L. 387, 388\n\n(2006). In 2001, 1,458,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy, and according to a recent\n\nstudy, \"about half of these filings had a medical debt cause, meaning that about 729,000\n\nbankruptcy filings were caused by medical debt.\" J.

Rev. 121, 132 (2004)), and, according to one of the\n\namici, the American Hospital Association, the figure now is 47 million.\n\n              Against that backdrop of familiar facts, the Director found that in 2002,\n\nCovenant spent only 0.7% of its revenue on charity care. The Director could have drawn\n\neither of two inferences from that percentage. He could have inferred that in 2002,\n\nmedical care in Champaign County was so affordable, and the citizenry so prosperous,\n\nthat there simply was no occasion for Covenant to spend more than 0.7% of its revenues\n\non charity care; a higher percentage would have required Covenant to \"manufacture\n\npatients in need,\" as Provena puts it. Alternatively, the Director could have inferred that\n\nCovenant did not dispense charity to all who needed it and that Covenant, therefore, was\n\nnot used \"exclusively\" for \"charitable purposes.\" The Director chose the latter inference,\n\nand we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that he thereby made a mistake.\n\nIf, in Winnebago Home, 40 Ill. 2d at 102, 237 N.E.2d at 540, the supreme court could\n\ndraw an adverse inference from the trivial amount of resources the defendant had\n\nallocated for charity care, we do not see why the Director is precluded from drawing a\n\ncomparable inference in the present case.\n\n                            c. Covenant's Charity Care Policy\n\n              Applicant exhibit No. 29 is Covenant's \"Charity Care Policy\" that was in\n\neffect in 2002. The policy was approved on May 10, 1994. According to this policy,\n\n\"[t]he provision of necessary services by St. Mary's Hospital shall not be withheld based\n\nupon an individual's ability to satisfy the related financial requirements.\" (Covenant\n\nused to be St. Mary's Hospital.) In the case of a patient who did not obtain an advance\n\ndetermination of his or her eligibility for charity care, Covenant would follow \"normal\n\n                                            - 33 -\n\fcollection practices,\" and \"[a]t any time during the collection process,\" the patient could\n\napply for charity care by contacting the patient accounting office. Persons whose family\n\nincome was above, but less than double, the poverty income guidelines set by the federal\n\ngovernment and whose assets other than a principal residence were $5,000 or less were\n\neligible for charity care. Those who qualified for charity care on the basis of their\n\nincome and whose equity in a principal residence was $10,000 and whose other assets\n\nwere $5,000 or less would be eligible for charity care after a determination of insurance\n\nbenefits.\n\n              Specifically, those whose income was less than the guidelines would be\n\neligible for a 100% reduction of the patient portion of the billed charges. Those whose\n\nincome was greater than the guidelines but not more than 1 1/4 times the guidelines\n\nwould be eligible for a 75% reduction. Those whose income was greater than the\n\nguidelines but not more than 1 1/2 times the guidelines would be eligible for a 50%\n\nreduction. Those whose income was greater than 1 1/2 times the guidelines but less\n\nthan double the guidelines would be eligible for a 25% reduction.\n\n              The poverty income guidelines for 2000 were as follows:\n\n              \"Size of family unit         Poverty Guidelines\n\n                     1                     $ 8,350\n\n                     2                      11,250\n\n                     3                      14,150\n\n                     4                      17,050\n\n                     5                      19,950\n\n                     6                      22,850\n\n                                           - 34 -\n\f                     7                       25,750\n\n                     8                       28,650\n\n              For family units with more than 8 members[,] add $2,900\n\n              for each additional member.\"\n\nThose who qualified for charity care on the basis of income but who had assets above the\n\naforementioned levels would become eligible for charity care to the extent that collec-\n\ntions of charges for services rendered reduced assets below the $5,000 and $10,000\n\nthresholds.\n\n              In his decision, the Director found that Covenant's charity care policy that\n\nwas in effect in 2002 \"fail[ed] to dispense charity according to the [Methodist Old\n\nPeoples Home] factors\" because the policy \"ignore[d] completely the financial burden\n\nincurred by the patients or families for the medical services rendered.\" The Director\n\ngave the following example:\n\n              \"[A] patient whose portion of billed charges was $50,000[]\n\n              and whose income was at a level allowing for a 50% waiver of\n\n              charges would be left with a $25,000 bill after application of\n\n              the sliding scale. It is unlikely that the patient or the pa-\n\n              tient's family[,] in this situation[,] would ever be able to pay\n\n              off this bill, considering the level of income. A patient at the\n\n              same level on the poverty income scale with billed charges of\n\n              $1,000 would be left with an outstanding bill of only $500\n\n              after the sliding scale is applied. As the illustration demon-\n\n              strates, application of Covenant's charitable policy would\n\n                                            - 35 -\n\f              result in an impoverished patient's family being faced with\n\n              an unpaid bill 50 times higher than a patient at the same\n\n              level of poverty income[,] simply because of the billed\n\n              amount for the medical services rendered. A true charitable\n\n              care policy would be more meaningful and would result in a\n\n              fair evaluation of a patient's ability to pay.\n\n                     Put differently, it is clear that the patient whose billed\n\n              medical charges are $50,000 is much more in need of a\n\n              greater level of assistance from Covenant than the patient\n\n              whose billed charges are $1,000. Yet Covenant applies the\n\n              same 50% reduction in charges to both patients, having the\n\n              reduction only on the level of poverty income.\n\n                     Moreover, during 2002, Provena Covenant referred\n\n              patients with unpaid charges to collection agencies, even\n\n              when a portion of the patient's charges had been reduced\n\n              pursuant to the Charity Care Policy.\"\n\n              This critique of Covenant's charity care policy strikes us as reasonable. In\n\nits disregard of liabilities, the charity care policy could have posed an obstacle to the\n\ndispensation of charity to the needy. See Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at 157,\n\n233 N.E.2d at 542. Basically, the charity care policy lacked nuance. In simple terms of\n\nthe dollar amount of assets, an elderly retired person might have the means of paying\n\nfor a medical procedure, but he might have to liquidate his house and the investments\n\nupon which he depends for basic survival. See B. Cohen, The Controversy Over Hospital\n\n                                            - 36 -\n\fCharges to the Uninsured--No Villains, No Heroes, 51 Vill. L. Rev. 95, 102 (2006).\n\nApparently, such a person would be ineligible for charity care at Covenant.\n\n              Although Covenant had a policy of admitting everyone regardless of their\n\nability to pay, we will not assume that everyone availed themselves of that policy\n\nregardless of their ability to pay. The prospect of a crushing financial liability could well\n\nhave been an obstacle in some people's minds; it could have deterred them from\n\nundergoing medical treatment.\n\n              In its brief, Provena argues it is undisputed that Covenant's charity care\n\npolicy \"is only a guide[] and is not mechanically applied\" and that \"a patient's eligibility\n\nfor free care is always open to reassessment, even if a patient were originally determined\n\nto be financially able to pay.\" But the record does not seem to reveal how often Cove-\n\nnant departed from the guidelines of its charity care policy, how often a reassessment\n\nwas done, what the reassessment considered, and how often a reassessment made any\n\ndifference (not often, one might infer, if out of 110,000 admissions, Covenant gave free\n\nor discounted care to only 302 patients--and then hired a collection agency to contact 64\n\nof those 302 charity care patients).\n\n           d. The Illusory Nature of Much of Covenant's \"Charity Care Costs\"\n\n              The dollar amount of charity care can be measured in either of two ways:\n\n(1) the cost to the hospital or (2) the amount the hospital charged. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at\n\n511. If cost is used, it can be either average cost, which includes overhead, or it can be\n\nmarginal cost. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511. Section 20(3) of the Community Benefits Act\n\nrequires hospitals to report their charity care as measured by average cost: the \"actual\n\ncost of services provided, based on the total cost[-]to[-]charge ratio derived from the\n\n                                            - 37 -\n\fhospital's Medicare cost report.\" 210 ILCS 76/20(3) (West 2006). Marginal cost is the\n\nexcess cost of treating an additional patient. See 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511 n.111. For\n\nexample, if treating 10 patients costs the hospital $10,000 but treating 11 patients costs\n\nthe hospital $10,500, the marginal cost of treating the eleventh patient is $500. The\n\naverage cost of treating all 11 patients is $10,500 divided by 11, or about $954. See 37\n\nLoy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511 n.111. Measuring charity care by charges yields a higher dollar\n\nfigure than measuring by cost; and measuring by average cost yields a higher dollar\n\nfigure than measuring by marginal cost. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511.\n\n              A scholar lays out the case for average costs as follows:\n\n                     \"[A]s a matter of theory, using charges to measure\n\n              charity care is patently ridiculous. In this regard, hospitals\n\n              operate akin to hotels, which have a 'rack rate' for their\n\n              rooms. Like the rack rate on hotel rooms, virtually no one\n\n              actually pays the hospital's 'rack rate' for services; instead,\n\n              hospitals negotiate discounted reimbursement rates with\n\n              insurance companies, or such rates are set by the govern-\n\n              ment as part of the Medicare and Medicaid program. Using\n\n              charges as the measure of charity care, therefore, would\n\n              simply let hospitals inflate their charity care 'numbers' by\n\n              setting higher prices for services that they know will never be\n\n              collected, or if collected at all, are charged only to uninsured\n\n              patients. ***\n\n                     As between average and marginal cost measures, a\n\n                                            - 38 -\n\f             good case can be made for either. The argument for mar-\n\n             ginal costs is that in the short run, filling empty beds with\n\n             charity patients or taking a few extra x-rays with a machine\n\n             already paid for costs very little[] and hospitals should not be\n\n             'credited[,]' in the charity care ledger[,] with part of their\n\n             overhead and capital investment in providing these services,\n\n             since those investments would have to be made anyway for\n\n             paying patients. Over time, however, nonpaying patients\n\n             represent a more or less permanent burden on a hospital and\n\n             will eventually require replacement of assets sooner than\n\n             would have been the case if the charity patients had not been\n\n             served. Thus, average costs (e.g., including overhead and\n\n             depreciation in the cost number) represent a better 'true'\n\n             measure of charity care in the long run. Average costs, in\n\n             fact, are the measure that most academics use in measuring\n\n             the value of charity care. Also, average costs are the measure\n\n             used by a number of states in legislation relating to charity\n\n             care reporting, including the recently enacted Community\n\n             Benefits Act in Illinois [(210 ILCS 76/1 through 99 (West\n\n             2006))] (although states have also used the marginal cost\n\n             measure in some circumstances).\" 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at\n\n             511-13.\n\nWe find this reasoning to be persuasive. In addition, we note that in German Hospital,\n\n                                           - 39 -\n\f233 Ill. at 248, 84 N.E. at 216, the supreme court seemed to quantify charity care by its\n\ncost (\"a large proportion of the entire number of patients received are treated either free\n\nor at less than actual cost\"). And, again, in section 20(3) of the Community Benefits Act\n\n(210 ILCS 76/20(3) (West 2006)), the legislature designated average cost as the\n\nmeasure of charity care.\n\n              In 2002, pursuant to its charity care policy, Covenant treated some\n\npatients for free and discounted its bills for other patients. Apparently, in calculating\n\nthe amount of its charity care, Covenant used the average cost of the discounted\n\nportions of the bills. The Director stated:\n\n              \"The applicant has asserted in several different contexts that\n\n              the cost of waiving charges pursuant to its charity care policy\n\n              in 2002 was $831,724 [citations to record] while the revenue\n\n              it waived amounted to $1,758,940 [citations to record]. To\n\n              obtain the cost figure, the [a]pplicant took the total cost of\n\n              providing care in the hospital and the total billed amounts\n\n              and developed a cost[-]to[-]charge ratio. The ratio was\n\n              applied to the charges generated. [Citations to record.]\n\n              $1,758,940 divided by $831,724 equals 2.1148.\"\n\n              As the Director explained, in the case of a patient whose bill Covenant\n\ndiscounted by 50%, the markup inherent in the remaining 50% more than consumed\n\nthe charity care in the 50% discount, if charity care were measured by average cost. The\n\nDirector reasoned as follows:\n\n                     \" [A] patient entitled to a 50% waiver based upon her\n\n                                              - 40 -\n\f              level on the poverty income scale[] and who received a\n\n              $50,000 bill would be left with a $25,000 balance after\n\n              application of the sliding scale reduction. This $25,000\n\n              outstanding bill, if paid by the patient, actually would have\n\n              generated an average mark[]up of $1,358 for Covenant.\n\n              ($50,000 divided by 2.1148 equals $23,642. The difference\n\n              of $1[,]358, based upon Covenant's formula, apparently\n\n              would have been the margin above its costs for the preferred\n\n              service.) It is impossible to conclude that this policy truly is\n\n              charity as contemplated by the [Methodist Old Peoples\n\n              Homes] guidelines. Thus, *** the Department's counsel\n\n              would appear to be correct in characterizing this practice as\n\n              'the illusion of charity.'\"\n\nThus, it would appear that in the case of the patients whose bills Covenant discounted by\n\n50% or 25%, Covenant actually came out ahead (at least, in terms of what the patients\n\nowed) and, therefore, extended no charity at all to those patients. The figure of\n\n$831,724, small as it is relative to Covenant's total revenues, appears to be an exaggera-\n\ntion.\n\n                          e. Shortfalls in Medicare and Medicaid\n\n              Applicant exhibit No. 64 is entitled \"Provena Covenant Medical Center\n\nCharitable Contributions [in] 2002,\" and it lists the following two items, among others:\n\n                                                         \"Cost\n\n              2.

One\n\ncommentator disagrees with these decisions. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 513. He maintains\n\nthat Medicaid reimbursements (and, presumably, also Medicare reimbursements) that\n\n\"fail to fully cover average costs\" \"probably should count as charity care because this\n\nrepresents a net cash outflow.\" 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 512. He reasons as follows:\n\n              \"One can certainly sympathize with the view that from the\n\n              standpoint of the patient, being accepted for treatment with\n\n              an up-front guarantee that the hospital will not seek pay-\n\n              ment is better than being billed for treatment and hounded\n\n              by collection efforts, even if the ultimate result (no payment)\n\n              is the same. But from the standpoint of the hospital, both\n\n              scenarios result in a lack of payment that the hospital must\n\n              make up for elsewhere to stay financially viable, and there is\n\n              little doubt that a significant portion of bad debt is in fact\n\n              related to the patient's financial inability to pay ***. *** At\n\n              some point, if government keeps piling on uncompensated\n\n              care obligations without some kind of offsetting revenue\n\n              enhancement, the hospital will simply no longer be able to\n\n                                            - 42 -\n\f              operate. Thus, an absolute rule that bad debts do not 'count'\n\n              as part of the justification for exemption also seems wrong\n\n              despite the courts' conclusions.\" 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 513.\n\n              Initially, we note that \"treatment of Medicare and Medicaid patients [is] a\n\nvirtual requirement\" for exemption from the federal income tax (37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at\n\n498, citing IHC Health Plans, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 325 F.3d 1188,\n\n1197-98 (10th Cir. 2003)), as the American Hospital Association candidly admits.\n\nFurther, from a legal point of view, we disagree with the reasoning that just because the\n\nend result of bad debt and charity is the same (lack of payment to the hospital), bad debt\n\nshould be considered charity. If an organization could acquire a tax exemption for\n\ngiving up on collecting from deadbeat customers, nearly every business in Illinois would\n\nbe tax-exempt.\n\n              As we have explained, charity from one person to another is a gift.\n\nPerhaps it is possible to give someone a gift in the form of forgiveness of debt, but to\n\naccomplish that gift, one surely would have to do more than write off the debt. Writing\n\noff a patient's bad debt involves only the hospital and its databases. Vis-a-vis the\n\nhospital and the patient, the relationship of creditor and debtor remains intact--and,\n\npresumably, the patient will conduct his affairs accordingly; he might forego opportuni-\n\nties, and, generally, he will live under a cloud, assuming that everything he owns and\n\nacquires could eventually be subject to execution. See 51 Vill. L. Rev. at 102. In fact, the\n\nALJ found that \"[i]f a patient [paid] an amount on an account that was included in\n\n[Covenant's] bad debt expense, then the payment [was] recorded as a recovery to bad\n\ndebt.\" And so nothing really has changed between the patient and the hospital. The\n\n                                           - 43 -\n\fhospital merely has decided, for its own accounting purposes, that trying to enforce the\n\ndebt would be futile or economically unrewarding--hardly a decision that exudes the\n\n\"warmth and spontaneity indicative of [a] charitable impulse\" (Willows, 43 Ill. 2d at\n\n208, 251 N.E.2d at 252).\n\n              Because a gift is, as we have explained, an uncompensated transfer, the\n\nhospital cannot be someone's creditor with respect to a certain sum and simultaneously\n\nbe the person's charitable benefactor with respect to that same sum. A decision about\n\nthe futility of collection that a creditor makes in the privacy of his office does not vitiate\n\nthe contractual relationship between the creditor and debtor. Like any other gift, a gift\n\nin the form of forgiveness of debt requires some kind of delivery. Berry v. Berry, 238 Ill.\n\nApp. 507, 510 (1925); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§274, 277(1), at 366, 370\n\n(1981); 38 Am. Jur. 2d Gifts §45 (2008). Further, the supreme court has held:\n\n\"[W]here there is no proof of consideration for the forgiveness of a debt, an attempt to\n\nforgive a debt is ineffective either as a gift or as an executory contract.\" Ermold v. Bear,\n\n358 Ill. 233, 238, 193 N.E. 184, 186 (1934); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\n§273, at 364 (1981). It appears that once a hospital enters into a contract with a patient\n\nwhereby the patient agrees to pay for services, transforming that patient into a charita-\n\nble beneficiary is somewhat more complicated, legally, than simply making a notation in\n\nthe hospital's accounts. Provena has not explained how, from a legal point of view, this\n\ntransformation would have come about. See A. Noble & A. Hyams, Charitable Hospital\n\nAccountability: A Review and Analysis of Legal and Policy Initiatives, 26 J.L. Med. &\n\nEthics 116, 119 n.66 (1998) (\"American Association of Certified Public Accountants\n\nissued updated health care audit guidelines in 1990,\" under which \"hospitals must now\n\n                                            - 44 -\n\fsegregate bad debt from charity care on their financial statements. Bad debt is now\n\nreported as an expense. Charity care, considered services provided without expectation\n\nof payment, is reported as a footnote on the financial statement\").\n\n             We understand that probably half the time, the reason for default is that\n\nthe patient simply cannot pay. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 513 (\"Some academic studies have\n\nshown that roughly 50% of hospital bad debt is likely due to inability to pay, rather than\n\nsimply debt avoidance or poor management\"). According to the ALJ's findings,\n\napproximately 60% of Covenant's inpatient admissions originate through the emergency\n\nroom--probably not an ideal place for a careful and methodical assessment of someone's\n\nfinancial situation. We can envision an argument that referral to a collection agency is\n\npart of the procedure of charity care. Through the services of the collection agency,\n\nCovenant assesses the extent of the patient's financial need, and once the collection\n\nagency validates the patient as an impoverished person, Covenant writes off the debt,\n\nand the write-off is charity. Setting aside the obstacle posed by Ermold, the main\n\nproblem with this argument is that Covenant continued to accept payments on what\n\nCovenant had designated, purely in its accounts, as bad debt.\n\n             We do not mean to put Covenant in a bad light simply because it uses\n\ncollection agencies. There is nothing wrong, per se, with a charitable organization using\n\ncollection agencies and even lawsuits to collect what is owed to it. As we have discussed,\n\ncharitable organizations may enter into contracts with those who are able to pay. It\n\nwould be illogical to say, on the one hand, that a charitable organization may enter into\n\na contract and, on the other hand, to forbid the charitable organization from insisting on\n\nthe performance of the contract. The resources of a charitable organization are finite,\n\n                                          - 45 -\n\fand those who fail to pay, even though they could pay without suffering economic\n\nhardship, effectively use resources that otherwise might have gone to the poor. In our\n\nmind, the only relevance of Covenant's sending accounts to collection agencies is the\n\nnegation of a charitable relationship with respect to the balances in those accounts. In\n\n2002, Covenant sent 10,085 accounts to collection agencies but gave charity care to only\n\n302 patients. Not all those 10,085 accounts, or maybe not even most of them, origi-\n\nnated from 2002, but the vast disparity between those numbers could strike a reason-\n\nable trier of fact as significant. As Provena says in its brief, there could be a variety of\n\nreasons for patients' failure to pay. One of the foremost reasons, however, surely would\n\nbe an inability to pay. The Director could reasonably infer that a lot of patients were not\n\nreceiving charity care who needed it.\n\n                           f. The Significance of the Stipulations\n\n              Provena argues that because the Department stipulated that Covenant\n\n\"dispenses health care to all who apply for it,\" \"regardless of their ability or inability to\n\npay for the service,\" it is established, as a matter of law, that Covenant provides charity\n\nto all who are in need. See In re Marriage of Sanborn, 78 Ill. App. 3d 146, 149, 396\n\nN.E.2d 1192, 1195 (1979) (\"[p]arties are bound by their stipulations\"). This is a non\n\nsequitur. Just because Covenant never turns a patient away because of the patient's\n\ninability to pay, it does not follow that Covenant thereby provides charity. If, despite the\n\npatient's inability to pay, the patient is contractually liable to reimburse Covenant for\n\nthe medical treatment, Covenant has extended no charity to that patient.\n\n                                      g.

App. 3d 939, 957, 711 N.E.2d 381, 393 (1999) (exemp-\n\ntion depends on activities \"on the property\"); Congregational Sunday School, 290 Ill. at\n\n118, 125 N.E. at 11 (\"It is not the use to be made of the profits but the nature of the\n\nbusiness done that is to be considered in deciding the question of liability to taxation\").\n\nIn this respect, the Illinois standard for exemption from property taxes is different from\n\nthe more diffuse \"community benefit\" standard for exemption from the federal income\n\ntax. See Rev. Rul. 69-545, 1969-2 C.B. 117-18; 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 497-98.\n\n              The ambulance service (item No. 7), for example, undoubtedly benefits the\n\ncommunity, and, therefore, we assume it counts for purposes of the federal income-tax\n\nexemption. But Illinois law scrutinizes the use of the subject property, and we do not\n\nknow where the ambulances are garaged. Do they depart from Covenant and bring\n\npatients back, or are they dispatched from a separate address? The Department\n\nsuggests, with citations to the record, that the majority of people transported by the\n\nambulances appear to be covered by third-party payers such as Blue Cross, the Civilian\n\nHealth and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), and health\n\nmaintenance organizations. Provena does not disagree. It is unclear to what extent the\n\n$888,091 for this item consists of the \"shortfall\" resulting from the discounted rates that\n\ninsurers paid. Such discounts would not be charitable. See Riverside Medical Center,\n\n342 Ill. App. 3d at 610, 795 N.E.2d at 367.\n\n                         C. The Exemption for Religious Purposes\n\n                      1. The Constitutional and Statutory Provisions\n\n              Section 6 of article IX of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 allows the\n\n                                            - 48 -\n\fGeneral Assembly to exempt \"property used exclusively for religious *** purposes.\" Ill.\n\nConst. 1970, art. IX, §6. Section 15-40 of the Property Tax Code provides as follows:\n\n                    \"(a) Property used exclusively for:\n\n                           (1) religious purposes ***\n\n                                          ***\n\n             qualifies for exemption as long as it is not used with a view to\n\n             profit.\" 35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West 2002).\n\n                                      2. Forfeiture\n\n             In the application for exemption that it filed in December 2002, Provena\n\nnever claimed an exemption for religious purposes (35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West\n\n2002)); it claimed an exemption only for charitable purposes (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a)\n\n(West 2002)). Because the county board of review never had an opportunity to consider\n\nwhether Covenant qualified for an exemption for religious purposes, the Department\n\nargues that Provena failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and is barred from\n\ninvoking section 15-40(a)(1) on appeal. See In re Application of County Collector of Du\n\nPage County, 157 Ill. App. 3d 355, 361, 510 N.E.2d 1240, 1244 (1987). Provena responds\n\nthat the Department has forfeited the defense of failure to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies, because the Department failed to raise that defense in circuit court. See In re\n\nApplication of Aurand, 90 Ill. App. 3d 560, 565, 413 N.E.2d 161, 165 (1980). We agree\n\nwith Provena. We further note that in his decision, the Director addressed the substan-\n\ntive merits of Provena's claim of an exemption for religious purposes.\n\n                             3. The Effect of the Stipulations\n\n             In the administrative proceedings, the Department stipulated that\n\n                                          - 49 -\n\f\"Covenant's stated and ongoing mission is to serve as the Catholic health[-]care ministry\n\nand charitable hospital in the Champaign/Urbana area and to build communities of\n\nhealing and hope by compassionately responding to human need in the spirit of Jesus\n\nChrist\" and that Covenant was \"founded, organized, owned[,] and operated as an\n\napostolic mission and health[-]care ministry of the Catholic Church.\"\n\n              According to Provena, these stipulations compel a determination that\n\nCovenant is exempt under section 15-40(a)(1) (35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West 2002)).\n\nWe disagree. It is Covenant's actual practice, not merely its mission, which determines\n\nthe right to exemption. See Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at 157, 233 N.E.2d\n\nat 542. The issue is not whether Covenant is operated as an \"apostolic mission and\n\nhealth care ministry of the Catholic Church\" but whether it is \"used exclusively for ***\n\nreligious purposes\" as case law defines that phrase. See 35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West\n\n2002). The stipulations do not squarely address that issue.\n\n              If \"religious purpose\" meant whatever one did in the name of religion, it\n\nwould be an unlimited and amorphous concept. Exemption would be the rule, and\n\ntaxation the exception. \"In a sense, everything a deeply devout person does has a\n\nreligious purpose.\" Faith Builders, 378 Ill. App. 3d at 1046, 882 N.E.2d at 1264. In\n\nFairview Haven v. Department of Revenue, 153 Ill. App. 3d 763, 768-69, 506 N.E.2d\n\n341, 345 (1987), we were unpersuaded by the reasoning that a nursing home had a\n\nreligious purpose because taking care of the elderly was a way of \"tying preaching to\n\naction.\" \"Religious purpose\" within the meaning of section 15-40(a)(1) (35 ILCS\n\n200/15-40(a)(1) (West 2002)) has to be narrower than \"Christian service,\" or else\n\n\"religious purpose\" would mean everything (and, therefore, nothing). In People ex rel.\n\n                                          - 50 -\n\fMcCullough v. Deutsche Gemeinde, 249 Ill. 132, 136-37, 94 N.E. 162, 164 (1911), the\n\nsupreme court stated: \"[A] religious purpose means a use of such property by a religious\n\nsociety or body of persons as a stated place for public worship, Sunday schools[,] and\n\nreligious instruction.\" In People ex rel. Carson v. Muldoon, 306 Ill. 234, 238, 137 N.E.\n\n863, 864 (1922), overruled in part on other grounds by McKenzie v. Johnson, 98 Ill. 2d\n\n87, 100, 456 N.E.2d 73, 79 (1983), the supreme court said, with reference to the quoted\n\npassage from Deutsche Gemeinde: \"This was not stated as inclusive of everything that\n\nmight in the future be regarded as a use for religious purposes but as illustrative of the\n\nnature of such use.\" If, as Muldoon said, public worship, Sunday schools, and religious\n\ninstruction are \"illustrative of the nature of [religious] use,\" it must follow that \"religious\n\nuse\" has a determinable nature and that to be a religious use, the activity must somehow\n\nresemble the activities listed in Deutsche Gemeinde. We do not see how medical care\n\nresembles public worship, Sunday schools, or religious instruction. Cf. Calvary Baptist,\n\n349 Ill. App. 3d at 327, 812 N.E.2d at 2 (throughout the year, the property was used for\n\nBible study classes, teen ministry events and meetings, and devotional activities, with\n\noccasional and incidental secular events).\n\n                                    4. Primacy of the Use\n\n              Provena had to prove that the religious use of the property was primary\n\nand that any secular use was incidental. See Fairview Haven, 153 Ill. App. 3d at 774, 506\n\nN.E.2d at 349. If the operation of the property is businesslike and more characteristic of\n\na place of commerce than a facility used primarily for religious purposes, the property is\n\nnot exempt from taxation under section 15-40(a)(1) (35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West\n\n2002)). Faith Builders, 378 Ill. App. 3d at 1046, 882 N.E.2d at 1264. In 2002, more\n\n                                             - 51 -\n\fthan 99.99% of Covenant's patients entered into contracts to pay for their medical\n\ntreatment. Almost all of Covenant's $115 million in revenue came from insurance\n\ncompanies, persons paying for their own treatment, and other contractual sources.\n\nDonations totaled only $6,938. See Cook Communications Ministries v. Department of\n\nRevenue, 345 Ill. App. 3d 753, 762, 803 N.E.2d 524, 530 (2004). Covenant sent 10,085\n\naccounts to collection agencies in 2002. The record does not appear to reveal how often\n\ntheological instruction was given during the 110,000 admissions that year, but Covenant\n\nspent $813,694 on advertising. Covenant more resembles a business with religious\n\novertones than property used primarily for religious purposes. See Cook Communica-\n\ntions Ministries, 345 Ill. App. 3d at 758, 803 N.E.2d at 527; Fairview Haven, 153 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 775, 506 N.E.2d at 349; Faith Builders, 378 Ill. App. 3d at 1046, 882 N.E.2d\n\n1264.\n\n                            D. Considerations of Public Policy\n\n              The amici warn that adverse social consequences will follow if we reverse\n\nthe circuit court's judgment and affirm the Director's decision. They say that with the\n\nnumber of uninsured Americans increasing and governmental programs failing to keep\n\nup with the rising cost of health care, not-for-profit hospitals already operate on thin\n\nmargins. The loss of the tax exemption would make these hospitals less attractive to\n\nlenders and would create a perverse economic incentive for the hospitals to shift\n\nresources away from community needs other than free or discounted medical care.\n\nBecause not-for-profit hospitals have no funds to spare, they would have no choice but\n\nto pass on to patients and commercial insurers the added cost of property taxes, and to\n\nthe extent they were unable to do so, they would have to cut services or even close their\n\n                                           - 52 -\n\fdoors, swelling the ranks of the uninsured and burdening the state with the indigent\n\npatients whom the hospitals formerly served, to the detriment of their bottom line.\n\n              These are arguments of public policy, and it is the legislature's job, not\n\nours, to make public policy. Board of Education of Dolton School District 149 v. Miller,\n\n349 Ill. App. 3d 806, 811, 812 N.E.2d 688, 693 (2004). Instead, we strive to be faithful\n\nto the meaning of legislation and case law; and if these authorities, correctly interpreted,\n\ndo not readily apply to the modern polycorporate hospital, so be it. Just because the test\n\nfor exemption is, in some respects, \"anachronistic, a reflection of a time without\n\nthird[-]party pay[e]rs and sophisticated medical care[,] *** it does not necessarily follow\n\nthat the changed circumstances still merit a tax exemption. Instead, perhaps the\n\nexemption is as anachronistic as the reasons that originally gave rise to it. Things that\n\nwere once tax-exempt can become taxable if circumstances change.\" 16 Am. J.L. & Med.\n\nat 379.\n\n              In several jurisdictions, the decisions of which the American Hospital\n\nAssociation cites, the concept of \"charity\" has become so amorphous and so tractable as\n\nto be virtually devoid of meaning. \"A word that comes to mean everything in effect\n\nmeans nothing[ at all].\" 31 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. at 211. The term \"charity\" has become\n\nmagical gibberish to sanctify any socially beneficial use of property that a court deems\n\nworthy of subsidy. But our constitution already enumerates the uses of property that\n\nare categorically worthy of exemption--e.g., schools, cemeteries, agricultural and\n\nhorticultural societies--and hospitals are not among them. Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, §6.\n\nIf, under section 6 of article IX, property used for \"charitable purposes\" is simply\n\nproperty that is put to some publicly beneficial purpose, why would it be necessary to\n\n                                           - 53 -\n\fseparately list schools, for instance, and agricultural societies, which obviously use\n\nproperty in a publicly beneficial way by defeating ignorance and hunger? The way the\n\nconstitutional provision is phrased, it does not list schools and agricultural societies as\n\nexamples of charitable purposes ( by saying \"and other charitable purposes\" or words to\n\nthat effect).\n\n                As one commentator explains, the slippage of the meaning of \"charity\"\n\nbegan long ago, when the Statute of Charitable Uses (43 Eliz. 4 (1601)), codifying\n\ndevelopments in the English common law, expanded the meaning of \"charity\" beyond its\n\n\"commonly understood definition of economic relief for the poor,\" \"to encompass\n\nvirtually anything deemed to be in the public interest.\" 31 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. at 191-\n\n93. Because the Statute of Charitable Uses became part of Illinois common law (Conti-\n\nnental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Harris, 359 Ill. 86, 90, 194 N.E. 250, 252\n\n(1934); 5 ILCS 50/1 (West 2006)), the supreme court has held that \" '[c]harity,' in the\n\nlegal sense, is not confined to mere alms[]giving or the relief of poverty and distress but\n\nhas a wider signification, which embraces the improvement and promotion of the\n\nhappiness of man\" (Harris, 359 Ill. at 92, 194 N.E. at 253). But it is impossible to miss\n\nthe recurrent theme of charity care in the supreme court's decisions on the exemption of\n\nhospitals from taxation. It is as if the supreme court decided, early on, to resist any\n\nfurther dilution of the meaning of \"charity,\" by holding that improving and promoting\n\nthe happiness of man entailed dispensing charity care as needed. See Sisters of the\n\nThird Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 274 (\"so long as charity was dispensed to all those\n\nwho needed it and who applied therefor\").\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 54 -\n\f              The language we use in the State of Illinois to determine whether real\n\nproperty is used for a charitable purpose has its genesis in our 1870 constitution. It is\n\nobvious that such language may be difficult to apply to the modern face of our nation's\n\nhealthcare delivery systems. Even the seminal case in Illinois, Methodist Old Peoples\n\nHome v.

The circuit court reversed the\n\nDirector's decision, holding that Covenant was used primarily for charitable and\n\nreligious purposes and, therefore, was exempt under sections 15-65(a) and 15-40(a)(1)\n\nof the Property Tax Code (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a), 15-40(a)(1) (West 2002)). We reverse\n\nthe circuit court's judgment because we find no clear error in the Director's decision.\n\n                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\n              Covenant is a not-for-profit, full-service, general acute-care hospital. As a\n\nnoncorporate subdivision of Provena, Covenant has no separate legal identity of its own.\n\nCovenant is the property, and Provena is the owner. According to an organizational\n\nchart in the record (applicant's exhibit No. 153), Provena owns five other hospitals\n\fbesides Covenant, but those other hospitals are not at issue in this case.\n\n              Provena applied to the Champaign County Board of Review to exempt\n\nCovenant from property taxes for 2002 on the ground that Covenant was used primarily\n\nfor charitable purposes (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a) (West 2002)). (Actually, Covenant was\n\nnominally the applicant, but because Covenant is not a legal \"person,\" we consider\n\nProvena to be the real applicant.) The board of review recommended denying the\n\napplication, and in February 2004, the Director followed that recommendation.\n\n              Provena paid $1.1 million in property taxes under protest and requested an\n\nadministrative hearing. In the hearing before the Department's administrative law\n\njudge (ALJ), Provena raised an additional ground for exemption besides charitable\n\npurposes (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a) (West 2002)): it claimed that as a health-care ministry\n\nof the Roman Catholic Church, Covenant was used primarily for religious purposes (35\n\nILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West 2002)). The ALJ submitted to the Director a decision\n\nrecommending an exemption on the sole grounds that Provena was a charitable\n\ninstitution and its property, Covenant, was used primarily for charitable purposes. The\n\nALJ did not reach the issue of whether Covenant was used primarily for religious\n\npurposes as well.\n\n              The Director disagreed with the ALJ's recommendation and denied an\n\nexemption for charitable uses. The primary reason for his decision was that in 2002, the\n\ntax year in question, Covenant devoted only 0.7% of its total revenue to charity care. Of\n\n110,000 admissions in 2002, Covenant gave free care to only 196 patients and dis-\n\ncounted care to only 106 patients; and Covenant hired collection agencies to recover the\n\nremaining balances from 64 of the patients to whom it had given discounts. Without\n\n                                           -2-\n\fexplanation, the Director also denied an exemption for religious uses.\n\n              Provena filed a complaint for administrative review. It argued to the\n\ncircuit court that under the supreme court's decisions, charities were not defined by\n\npercentages and that, in any event, Covenant dispensed an ample amount of charity to\n\nthe community in forms other than charity care. Covenant had a charity-care policy\n\nbased on federal poverty guidelines, and it advertised the availability of \"financial\n\nassistance.\" According to Provena, Covenant gave this financial assistance to every\n\npatient who needed and requested it, and the number of indigent people who walked in\n\nthrough the door and availed themselves of the charity-care policy simply was beyond\n\nCovenant's control. Also, Provena argued, considering the meager rates of reimburse-\n\nment the government paid, treating Medicare and Medicaid patients was itself an act of\n\ncharity. Provena further argued--indeed, the parties had stipulated--that Covenant was\n\na faith-based institution founded, organized, owned, and operated as an apostolic\n\nmission and health-care ministry of the Catholic Church. The circuit court concluded\n\nthat Covenant was entitled to both a charitable and religious exemption, and it reversed\n\nthe Director's decision.\n\n              This appeal followed.\n\n                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\n                                  A. Standard of Review\n\n              We review the Department's decision, not the circuit court's decision.\n\nCalvary Baptist Church of Tilton v.

One of the reasons why the\n\nDirector denied an exemption under section 15-65(a) (35 ILCS 200/15-65(a) (West\n\n2002)) was Provena's failure to prove, clearly and conclusively, that it was a charitable\n\ninstitution.

Applying the six\n\nfactors to the question of charitable use can be awkward if only because the sixth factor\n\nsquarely poses the question of charitable use (Eden Retirement Center, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n\n287, 821 N.E.2d at 248 (\"(6) *** exclusive, i.e., primary, use of the property is for\n\ncharitable purposes\")), suggesting that the preceding five factors address some other\n\nquestion. Nevertheless, some of the factors do describe how property is used for\n\ncharitable purposes, i.e., bestowing benefits upon an indefinite number of persons,\n\nlessening the burdens on government, dispensing charity to all who need it and apply\n\nfor it, and putting no obstacles in their way (Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at\n\n157, 233 N.E.2d at 541-42).\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 11 -\n\f              Part of the difficulty with the factors in Methodist Old Peoples Home (and,\n\nfor that matter, with any set of factors) is discerning how important any one factor is\n\ncompared to another. The First District has said that \"[t]he factors outlined by the\n\nsupreme court in [Methodist Old Peoples Home] are guidelines rather than definitive\n\nrequirements.\" Arts Club of Chicago v.

Apparently, the only way of\n\ntelling which factors are guidelines and which are essential criteria is to see how they are\n\ntreated in case law. The factors are old--Methodist Old Peoples Home dates from 1968,\n\nand it relied on cases going back 75 years (Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at\n\n156-57, 233 N.E.2d at 541-42)--and it appears that one of the factors at issue, namely,\n\ncharitable funding of the institution (Eden Retirement Center, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 287, 821\n\nN.E.2d at 248), has waned in importance.

Provena and\n\nthe amici curiae disagree with the Department on the meaning of \" 'charity.' \" As one of\n\nthe amici curiae, the Illinois Hospital Association, observes, \"charity\" can have different\n\nmeanings depending on whether an article precedes it: a charity is an organization,\n\nwhereas charity is what the organization dispenses.

Phillips, 14\n\n              Allen, 556 (approved by Perry in his work on Trusts, vol. 2,\n\n                                            - 18 -\n\f              sec. 697) as follows: 'A charity, in [the] legal sense, may be\n\n              more fully defined as a gift, to be applied consistently with\n\n              existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of\n\n              persons, either by bringing their *** hearts under the influ-\n\n              ence of education or religion[;] by relieving their bodies from\n\n              disease, suffering[,] or constraint[;] by assisting them to\n\n              establish themselves [in] life[;] or by erecting or maintaining\n\n              public buildings or works[] or otherwise lessening the\n\n              burthens of government. It is immaterial whether the pur-\n\n              pose is called charitable in the gift itself, if it is so described\n\n              as to show that it is charitable in its nature.' \" (Emphases\n\n              added.) Crerar, 145 Ill. at 643, 34 N.E. at 470, quoting Jack-\n\n              son v. Phillips, 96 Mass. (14 Allen) 539, 556 (1867).\n\n              According to the Illinois Hospital Association, the phrase \"a charity is a\n\ngift\" has to do solely with how a charitable organization comes into existence--by some\n\nperson or group of persons making a charitable gift to the community for the purpose of\n\nestablishing a hospital--and does not require that the charity, after its inception, give\n\nanything away. Provena argues it is a charitable organization because it provides\n\nmedical care, which, according to Crerar, is a charitable purpose--\" 'relieving *** bodies\n\nfrom disease, suffering[,] or constraint.' \" Crerar, 145 Ill. at 643, 34 N.E. at 470, quoting\n\nJackson, 96 Mass. (14 Allen) at 556.\n\n              By the logic of Provena and the Illinois Hospital Association, the only\n\ngiving that matters, for purposes of charity, is the gift by which the founders established\n\n                                             - 19 -\n\fthe hospital, whenever that occurred. A hospital thereafter could practice economic\n\npredation and nevertheless maintain its charitable status. It seems to us that confining\n\nthe gift to the establishment of the hospital would make the gift dubious. If a patient,\n\nlike virtually all the other patients, must agree to pay for his or her medical care, the\n\npatient receives a gift only in the rarefied form of an opportunity to purchase medical\n\ncare locally. A new Wal-Mart would be a gift in a comparable sense--with the added\n\nbonus that it would pay property taxes. And if the medical bill includes a charge for the\n\ndepreciation of assets, the gift becomes even more tenuous. Unlike Wal-Mart, a not-for-\n\nprofit hospital would plow any profits back into the hospital, becoming bigger and better\n\nequipped. But, again, from the perspective of paying patients, the gift merely would be\n\nthe enhanced opportunities to enter into increasingly expensive contractual relation-\n\nships with the hospital and its physicians. In Crerar, 145 Ill. at 643-44, 34 N.E. at 470, a\n\ncase Provena cites for the proposition that relieving bodies from suffering is, per se,\n\ncharity, the testator made \"a gift 'for the erection, creation, maintenance[,] and endow-\n\nment of a free public library.' \" (Emphasis added.)\n\n              If medical care, free or not, were charity in and of itself, the only difference\n\nbetween a charitable hospital and a for-profit hospital would be the \"inurement con-\n\nstraint\" (16 Am. J.L. & Med. at 378), and the supreme court made clear in Hopedale\n\nMedical Foundation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 464, 264 N.E.2d at 11 (discussing federal and state\n\nexemptions based on inurement), that the inurement constraint implicit in the exemp-\n\ntion from federal and state income taxation alone will not exempt a hospital from\n\nproperty taxation. One commentator asks rhetorically, \"Would one ever allow a dry\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 20 -\n\fcleaner or shoe store with an inurement prohibition to qualify for tax exemption?\" 16\n\nAm. J.L. & Med. at 378.\n\n              By holding medical care to be, in and of itself, charity, we effectively would\n\nexcuse charitable hospitals from their ongoing mission of giving. We would hold that a\n\nhospital is being charitable, for instance, when it sends an impoverished patient a bill\n\nthat the patient could never hope to pay. That holding not only would create a deafen-\n\ning cognitive dissonance, but it would ignore the supreme court's repeated rationale in\n\ncases involving charitable hospitals. If, as Provena claims, charity did not entail treating\n\npatients for free, a case the supreme court decided only a year after Sisters of the Third\n\nOrder would make no sense. In German Hospital of Chicago v. Board of Review, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248-50, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 216 (1908), the supreme court emphasized the number of\n\npatients the hospital treated for free or at reduced rates and, on that basis, held Sisters\n\nof the Third Order to be directly on point and the hospital to be a public charity exempt\n\nfrom taxation.\n\n              Provena interprets Sisters of the Third Order as meaning that the number\n\nof charity care patients does not matter. We do not read the case that way. In Sisters of\n\nthe Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 273-74, the Board of Review of Peoria County\n\nargued that St. Francis Hospital was not an institution of public charity because of \"the\n\ngreat disparity between the number of charity patients and those who pay for the care\n\nand attention they receive at this institution.\" If Provena were correct--if all a charitable\n\nhospital had to do was provide medical care because medical care was, ipso facto,\n\ncharity--the supreme court surely would have answered the board of review's argument\n\nby saying it did not matter how many patients St. Francis Hospital treated for free\n\n                                            - 21 -\n\fbecause all medical care, compensated or not, was charity. But that is not what the\n\nsupreme court said. Rather, it said: \"This objection seems to us without merit, so long\n\nas charity was dispensed to all those who needed it and who applied therefor ***.\"\n\nSisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 274. Clearly, in this context,\n\n\"charity\" does not mean compensated medical care; it means uncompensated medical\n\ncare. Further, the corollary seems to be that if St. Francis Hospital had failed to provide\n\nfree treatment to those who needed it and applied for it, the board of review's objection\n\nwould have had merit: the hospital would not have been an institution of public charity.\n\n              In Winnebago Home, the unsuccessful applicant for exemption was, like\n\nProvena, in the business of relieving bodies from disease, suffering, and constraint.\n\n\"Upon accepting a resident, the association obligate[d] itself to provide him with a\n\nhome, medical care, food, and, according to the testimony of one witness, a 'Christian\n\nburial.' \" Winnebago Home, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 97-98, 237 N.E.2d at 537. If Provena were\n\ncorrect--if relieving bodies from disease, suffering, and constraint qualified as charity\n\neven though the relieving resulted in a bill for the persons getting relieved--the defen-\n\ndant in Winnebago Home would have received an exemption. But that is not what\n\nhappened. The supreme court held:\n\n                     \"[The] [d]efendant's insistence upon the payment of a\n\n              sizable admission fee, the assignment by a resident of his\n\n              assets[,] and the health requirements imposed[] constitute\n\n              an even more serious impediment to the tax exempt status it\n\n              seeks.

There is nothing particularly kind or benevolent about selling somebody\n\nsomething. \"Charity\" is \"generosity and helpfulness[,] esp[ecially] toward the needy or\n\nsuffering\" (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 192 (10th ed. 2000))--not merely\n\nhelpfulness, note, but generosity. \"Generosity\" means \"liber[ality] in giving.\" Merriam-\n\nWebster's Collegiate Dictionary 484 (10th ed. 2000). To be charitable, an institution\n\nmust give liberally. Removing giving from charity would debase the meaning of charity,\n\nand we resist such an assault upon language. See C. Borek, Decoupling Tax Exemption\n\nfor Charitable Organizations, 31 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 183, 187 (2004) (\"the 'legal'\n\nmeaning [of 'charitable'] has so stretched the term beyond its etymological boundaries\n\nas to render the concept vacant, unoccupied by any useful legal notion of what 'charita-\n\nble' means\"). The fourth and fifth factors in Methodist Old Peoples Home--dispensing\n\ncharity to all who need it and apply for it and placing no obstacles in their way--are\n\nmore than guidelines; they are essential criteria; they go to the heart of what it means to\n\nbe a charitable institution.\n\n              As the Director observed, the record appears to contain no evidence of the\n\namount of charity that Provena dispensed in 2002. Insomuch as the Director found this\n\ndeficiency of proof to be fatal to Provena's status as a charitable institution, we are not\n\nleft with a definite and firm conviction that he was mistaken.\n\n                                            - 24 -\n\f                2. \"Exclusive\" Use of the Property for Charitable Purposes\n\n         a.

But Provena contends that \"[the] 'gift' is not limited, as the Depart-\n\nment claims, to free goods or services.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n\n              On the contrary, a gift is, by definition, free goods or services: \"something\n\nvoluntarily transferred by one person to another without compensation\" (Merriam-\n\nWebster's Collegiate Dictionary 491 (10th ed. 2000)). Defining \"gift\" in any other way\n\nwould do violence to the meaning of the word. One can make a gift by charging nothing\n\nat all. Or one can make a gift by undercharging a person, that is, charging less than\n\none's cost (using cost as a baseline prevents the creation of an artificial gift through\n\ninflation of prices (37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511-12)), and in that case, part of the goods or\n\nservices is given without compensation.

But the designation of \"charity\" would be problematic if the\n\nwater fountain were coin-operated. Regardless of whether the recipient of the goods or\n\nservices is rich or poor or somewhere in between, it is nonsensical to say one has given a\n\ngift to that person, or that one has been charitable, by billing that person for the full cost\n\nof the goods or services--whether the goods or services be medical or otherwise. For a\n\ngift (and, therefore, charity) to occur, something of value must be given for free.\n\n              In the cases on which Provena relies--Young Men's Christian Ass'n; Quad\n\nCities Open; Cannon; and Sisters of the Third Order--the institutions claiming a tax\n\nexemption charged fees as a means of financing charity care and other charitable gifts,\n\nor they charged fees no higher than the poor could afford. In Young Men's Christian\n\nAss'n, 365 Ill. at 123-24, 6 N.E.2d at 170, the supreme court said:\n\n              \"The rates [the Young Men's Christian Association of Chi-\n\n              cago] charged for its rooms are not based, alone, on the cost\n\n              of the service rendered, but the object of the appellee is to\n\n              furnish wholesome living conditions to young men at a price\n\n              they can afford to pay and thereby correct the social evils\n\n              that surround men who would otherwise be compelled to live\n\n              in cheap rooming houses, amid sordid environments.\"\n\nThe record appears to contain no evidence that, in 2002, Covenant billed its patients\n\nonly as much as they could afford to pay or that Covenant was, financially or otherwise,\n\na kinder and gentler alternative to for-profit hospitals.

Although Provena proved that it turned no patient away, it did not\n\nprove that \"[t]hose who [were] without money or property [were] cared for without\n\ncharge\" (Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 320, 83 N.E. at 273)--or so the Director\n\nreasonably could have found.\n\n               b.

For most\n\nhospitals, charging patients who are able to pay is, as a practical matter, a necessity.\n\nGiven the permissibility and necessity of charging those who are able to pay, the amount\n\nof charity care a hospital provides may depend on how many impoverished people seek\n\ntreatment. Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 274 (\"The institution\n\ncould not extend its benefactions to those who did not need them or to those who did\n\nnot seek admission\"). As the Illinois Hospital Association explains, how many impover-\n\nished people seek treatment in turn would depend on a number of highly variable\n\n                                            - 30 -\n\ffactors, to which an across-the-board, fixed percentage would be unsuitable, e.g., the\n\ntype of hospital, local demographics, public health, the economy, the cost of medical\n\ncare, and the cost and availability of medical insurance.\n\n              Thus, in Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 273-74, the\n\n\"great disparity\" between the patients who paid and the patients who were treated for\n\nfree did not necessarily negate the primary purpose of charity. It was conceivable that\n\nonly 11% of the patients who sought admission were unable to pay (5% of which the\n\nhospital treated for free and the other 6% of which the hospital treated at the county's\n\nexpense (Sisters of the Third Order, 231 Ill. at 320, 83 N.E. at 273)).\n\n              The wide variability of need from one community to another did not\n\nprevent the supreme court from considering percentages or numbers in Sisters of the\n\nThird Order, 231 Ill. at 320, 83 N.E. at 273, and German Hospital, 233 Ill. at 248-49, 84\n\nN.E. at 216. In the latter case especially, the supreme court discussed at great length\n\n\"the facts found and certified in tabular form by the board of review as to the number of\n\npatients received each year during the past five years, the number treated free, [and] the\n\nnumber treated [at various discounted rates],\" and the supreme court observed that \"a\n\nlarge proportion of the entire number of patients received are treated either free or at\n\nless than actual cost.\" German Hospital, 233 Ill. at 248, 84 N.E. at 216.\n\n              Common sense suggests that the number of charity patients a hospital\n\nactually serves has direct relevance to one of the factors in Methodist Old Peoples\n\nHomes, 39 Ill. 2d at 157, 233 N.E.2d at 542, namely, whether the hospital \"dispenses\n\ncharity to all who need and apply for it.\" Charity is more than rhetoric.

The Director could have drawn\n\neither of two inferences from that percentage. He could have inferred that in 2002,\n\nmedical care in Champaign County was so affordable, and the citizenry so prosperous,\n\nthat there simply was no occasion for Covenant to spend more than 0.7% of its revenues\n\non charity care; a higher percentage would have required Covenant to \"manufacture\n\npatients in need,\" as Provena puts it. Alternatively, the Director could have inferred that\n\nCovenant did not dispense charity to all who needed it and that Covenant, therefore, was\n\nnot used \"exclusively\" for \"charitable purposes.\" The Director chose the latter inference,\n\nand we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that he thereby made a mistake.\n\nIf, in Winnebago Home, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 102, 237 N.E.2d at 540, the supreme court could\n\ndraw an adverse inference from the trivial amount of resources the defendant had\n\nallocated for charity care, we do not see why the Director is precluded from drawing a\n\ncomparable inference in the present case.\n\n                            c. Covenant's Charity Care Policy\n\n              Applicant exhibit No. 29 is Covenant's \"Charity Care Policy\" that was in\n\neffect in 2002. The policy was approved on May 10, 1994. According to this policy,\n\n\"[t]he provision of necessary services by St. Mary's Hospital shall not be withheld based\n\nupon an individual's ability to satisfy the related financial requirements.\" (Covenant\n\nused to be St. Mary's Hospital.) In the case of a patient who did not obtain an advance\n\ndetermination of his or her eligibility for charity care, Covenant would follow \"normal\n\n                                            - 33 -\n\fcollection practices,\" and \"[a]t any time during the collection process,\" the patient could\n\napply for charity care by contacting the patient accounting office. Persons whose family\n\nincome was above, but less than double, the poverty income guidelines set by the federal\n\ngovernment and whose assets other than a principal residence were $5,000 or less were\n\neligible for charity care. Those who qualified for charity care on the basis of their\n\nincome and whose equity in a principal residence was $10,000 and whose other assets\n\nwere $5,000 or less would be eligible for charity care after a determination of insurance\n\nbenefits.\n\n              Specifically, those whose income was less than the guidelines would be\n\neligible for a 100% reduction of the patient portion of the billed charges. Those whose\n\nincome was greater than the guidelines but not more than 1 1/4 times the guidelines\n\nwould be eligible for a 75% reduction. Those whose income was greater than the\n\nguidelines but not more than 1 1/2 times the guidelines would be eligible for a 50%\n\nreduction. Those whose income was greater than 1 1/2 times the guidelines but less\n\nthan double the guidelines would be eligible for a 25% reduction.\n\n              The poverty income guidelines for 2000 were as follows:\n\n              \"Size of family unit         Poverty Guidelines\n\n                     1                     $ 8,350\n\n                     2                      11,250\n\n                     3                      14,150\n\n                     4                      17,050\n\n                     5                      19,950\n\n                     6                      22,850\n\n                                           - 34 -\n\f                     7                       25,750\n\n                     8                       28,650\n\n              For family units with more than 8 members[,] add $2,900\n\n              for each additional member.\"\n\nThose who qualified for charity care on the basis of income but who had assets above the\n\naforementioned levels would become eligible for charity care to the extent that collec-\n\ntions of charges for services rendered reduced assets below the $5,000 and $10,000\n\nthresholds.\n\n              In his decision, the Director found that Covenant's charity care policy that\n\nwas in effect in 2002 \"fail[ed] to dispense charity according to the [Methodist Old\n\nPeoples Home] factors\" because the policy \"ignore[d] completely the financial burden\n\nincurred by the patients or families for the medical services rendered.\" The Director\n\ngave the following example:\n\n              \"[A] patient whose portion of billed charges was $50,000[]\n\n              and whose income was at a level allowing for a 50% waiver of\n\n              charges would be left with a $25,000 bill after application of\n\n              the sliding scale. It is unlikely that the patient or the pa-\n\n              tient's family[,] in this situation[,] would ever be able to pay\n\n              off this bill, considering the level of income. A patient at the\n\n              same level on the poverty income scale with billed charges of\n\n              $1,000 would be left with an outstanding bill of only $500\n\n              after the sliding scale is applied. As the illustration demon-\n\n              strates, application of Covenant's charitable policy would\n\n                                            - 35 -\n\f              result in an impoverished patient's family being faced with\n\n              an unpaid bill 50 times higher than a patient at the same\n\n              level of poverty income[,] simply because of the billed\n\n              amount for the medical services rendered. A true charitable\n\n              care policy would be more meaningful and would result in a\n\n              fair evaluation of a patient's ability to pay.\n\n                     Put differently, it is clear that the patient whose billed\n\n              medical charges are $50,000 is much more in need of a\n\n              greater level of assistance from Covenant than the patient\n\n              whose billed charges are $1,000. Yet Covenant applies the\n\n              same 50% reduction in charges to both patients, having the\n\n              reduction only on the level of poverty income.\n\n                     Moreover, during 2002, Provena Covenant referred\n\n              patients with unpaid charges to collection agencies, even\n\n              when a portion of the patient's charges had been reduced\n\n              pursuant to the Charity Care Policy.\"\n\n              This critique of Covenant's charity care policy strikes us as reasonable. In\n\nits disregard of liabilities, the charity care policy could have posed an obstacle to the\n\ndispensation of charity to the needy. See Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at 157,\n\n233 N.E.2d at 542. Basically, the charity care policy lacked nuance. In simple terms of\n\nthe dollar amount of assets, an elderly retired person might have the means of paying\n\nfor a medical procedure, but he might have to liquidate his house and the investments\n\nupon which he depends for basic survival. See B. Cohen, The Controversy Over Hospital\n\n                                            - 36 -\n\fCharges to the Uninsured--No Villains, No Heroes, 51 Vill. L. Rev. 95, 102 (2006).\n\nApparently, such a person would be ineligible for charity care at Covenant.\n\n              Although Covenant had a policy of admitting everyone regardless of their\n\nability to pay, we will not assume that everyone availed themselves of that policy\n\nregardless of their ability to pay. The prospect of a crushing financial liability could well\n\nhave been an obstacle in some people's minds; it could have deterred them from\n\nundergoing medical treatment.\n\n              In its brief, Provena argues it is undisputed that Covenant's charity care\n\npolicy \"is only a guide[] and is not mechanically applied\" and that \"a patient's eligibility\n\nfor free care is always open to reassessment, even if a patient were originally determined\n\nto be financially able to pay.\" But the record does not seem to reveal how often Cove-\n\nnant departed from the guidelines of its charity care policy, how often a reassessment\n\nwas done, what the reassessment considered, and how often a reassessment made any\n\ndifference (not often, one might infer, if out of 110,000 admissions, Covenant gave free\n\nor discounted care to only 302 patients--and then hired a collection agency to contact 64\n\nof those 302 charity care patients).\n\n           d. The Illusory Nature of Much of Covenant's \"Charity Care Costs\"\n\n              The dollar amount of charity care can be measured in either of two ways:\n\n(1) the cost to the hospital or (2) the amount the hospital charged. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at\n\n511. If cost is used, it can be either average cost, which includes overhead, or it can be\n\nmarginal cost. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511. Section 20(3) of the Community Benefits Act\n\nrequires hospitals to report their charity care as measured by average cost: the \"actual\n\ncost of services provided, based on the total cost[-]to[-]charge ratio derived from the\n\n                                            - 37 -\n\fhospital's Medicare cost report.\" 210 ILCS 76/20(3) (West 2006). Marginal cost is the\n\nexcess cost of treating an additional patient. See 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511 n.111. For\n\nexample, if treating 10 patients costs the hospital $10,000 but treating 11 patients costs\n\nthe hospital $10,500, the marginal cost of treating the eleventh patient is $500. The\n\naverage cost of treating all 11 patients is $10,500 divided by 11, or about $954. See 37\n\nLoy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511 n.111. Measuring charity care by charges yields a higher dollar\n\nfigure than measuring by cost; and measuring by average cost yields a higher dollar\n\nfigure than measuring by marginal cost. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 511.\n\n              A scholar lays out the case for average costs as follows:\n\n                     \"[A]s a matter of theory, using charges to measure\n\n              charity care is patently ridiculous. In this regard, hospitals\n\n              operate akin to hotels, which have a 'rack rate' for their\n\n              rooms. Like the rack rate on hotel rooms, virtually no one\n\n              actually pays the hospital's 'rack rate' for services; instead,\n\n              hospitals negotiate discounted reimbursement rates with\n\n              insurance companies, or such rates are set by the govern-\n\n              ment as part of the Medicare and Medicaid program. Using\n\n              charges as the measure of charity care, therefore, would\n\n              simply let hospitals inflate their charity care 'numbers' by\n\n              setting higher prices for services that they know will never be\n\n              collected, or if collected at all, are charged only to uninsured\n\n              patients. ***\n\n                     As between average and marginal cost measures, a\n\n                                            - 38 -\n\f             good case can be made for either. The argument for mar-\n\n             ginal costs is that in the short run, filling empty beds with\n\n             charity patients or taking a few extra x-rays with a machine\n\n             already paid for costs very little[] and hospitals should not be\n\n             'credited[,]' in the charity care ledger[,] with part of their\n\n             overhead and capital investment in providing these services,\n\n             since those investments would have to be made anyway for\n\n             paying patients. Over time, however, nonpaying patients\n\n             represent a more or less permanent burden on a hospital and\n\n             will eventually require replacement of assets sooner than\n\n             would have been the case if the charity patients had not been\n\n             served. Thus, average costs (e.g., including overhead and\n\n             depreciation in the cost number) represent a better 'true'\n\n             measure of charity care in the long run. Average costs, in\n\n             fact, are the measure that most academics use in measuring\n\n             the value of charity care. Also, average costs are the measure\n\n             used by a number of states in legislation relating to charity\n\n             care reporting, including the recently enacted Community\n\n             Benefits Act in Illinois [(210 ILCS 76/1 through 99 (West\n\n             2006))] (although states have also used the marginal cost\n\n             measure in some circumstances).\" 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at\n\n             511-13.\n\nWe find this reasoning to be persuasive. In addition, we note that in German Hospital,\n\n                                           - 39 -\n\f233 Ill. at 248, 84 N.E. at 216, the supreme court seemed to quantify charity care by its\n\ncost (\"a large proportion of the entire number of patients received are treated either free\n\nor at less than actual cost\"). And, again, in section 20(3) of the Community Benefits Act\n\n(210 ILCS 76/20(3) (West 2006)), the legislature designated average cost as the\n\nmeasure of charity care.\n\n              In 2002, pursuant to its charity care policy, Covenant treated some\n\npatients for free and discounted its bills for other patients. Apparently, in calculating\n\nthe amount of its charity care, Covenant used the average cost of the discounted\n\nportions of the bills. The Director stated:\n\n              \"The applicant has asserted in several different contexts that\n\n              the cost of waiving charges pursuant to its charity care policy\n\n              in 2002 was $831,724 [citations to record] while the revenue\n\n              it waived amounted to $1,758,940 [citations to record]. To\n\n              obtain the cost figure, the [a]pplicant took the total cost of\n\n              providing care in the hospital and the total billed amounts\n\n              and developed a cost[-]to[-]charge ratio. The ratio was\n\n              applied to the charges generated. [Citations to record.]\n\n              $1,758,940 divided by $831,724 equals 2.1148.\"\n\n              As the Director explained, in the case of a patient whose bill Covenant\n\ndiscounted by 50%, the markup inherent in the remaining 50% more than consumed\n\nthe charity care in the 50% discount, if charity care were measured by average cost. The\n\nDirector reasoned as follows:\n\n                     \" [A] patient entitled to a 50% waiver based upon her\n\n                                              - 40 -\n\f              level on the poverty income scale[] and who received a\n\n              $50,000 bill would be left with a $25,000 balance after\n\n              application of the sliding scale reduction. This $25,000\n\n              outstanding bill, if paid by the patient, actually would have\n\n              generated an average mark[]up of $1,358 for Covenant.\n\n              ($50,000 divided by 2.1148 equals $23,642. The difference\n\n              of $1[,]358, based upon Covenant's formula, apparently\n\n              would have been the margin above its costs for the preferred\n\n              service.) It is impossible to conclude that this policy truly is\n\n              charity as contemplated by the [Methodist Old Peoples\n\n              Homes] guidelines. Thus, *** the Department's counsel\n\n              would appear to be correct in characterizing this practice as\n\n              'the illusion of charity.'\"\n\nThus, it would appear that in the case of the patients whose bills Covenant discounted by\n\n50% or 25%, Covenant actually came out ahead (at least, in terms of what the patients\n\nowed) and, therefore, extended no charity at all to those patients. The figure of\n\n$831,724, small as it is relative to Covenant's total revenues, appears to be an exaggera-\n\ntion.\n\n                          e.

One\n\ncommentator disagrees with these decisions. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 513. He maintains\n\nthat Medicaid reimbursements (and, presumably, also Medicare reimbursements) that\n\n\"fail to fully cover average costs\" \"probably should count as charity care because this\n\nrepresents a net cash outflow.\" 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 512. He reasons as follows:\n\n              \"One can certainly sympathize with the view that from the\n\n              standpoint of the patient, being accepted for treatment with\n\n              an up-front guarantee that the hospital will not seek pay-\n\n              ment is better than being billed for treatment and hounded\n\n              by collection efforts, even if the ultimate result (no payment)\n\n              is the same. But from the standpoint of the hospital, both\n\n              scenarios result in a lack of payment that the hospital must\n\n              make up for elsewhere to stay financially viable, and there is\n\n              little doubt that a significant portion of bad debt is in fact\n\n              related to the patient's financial inability to pay ***. *** At\n\n              some point, if government keeps piling on uncompensated\n\n              care obligations without some kind of offsetting revenue\n\n              enhancement, the hospital will simply no longer be able to\n\n                                            - 42 -\n\f              operate. Thus, an absolute rule that bad debts do not 'count'\n\n              as part of the justification for exemption also seems wrong\n\n              despite the courts' conclusions.\" 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 513.\n\n              Initially, we note that \"treatment of Medicare and Medicaid patients [is] a\n\nvirtual requirement\" for exemption from the federal income tax (37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at\n\n498, citing IHC Health Plans, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163334\"><a href=\"/opinion/163334/ihc-health-plans-v-cir/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1197-98 (10th Cir. 2003)), as the American Hospital Association candidly admits.\n\nFurther, from a legal point of view, we disagree with the reasoning that just because the\n\nend result of bad debt and charity is the same (lack of payment to the hospital), bad debt\n\nshould be considered charity. If an organization could acquire a tax exemption for\n\ngiving up on collecting from deadbeat customers, nearly every business in Illinois would\n\nbe tax-exempt.\n\n              As we have explained, charity from one person to another is a gift.\n\nPerhaps it is possible to give someone a gift in the form of forgiveness of debt, but to\n\naccomplish that gift, one surely would have to do more than write off the debt. Writing\n\noff a patient's bad debt involves only the hospital and its databases. Vis-a-vis the\n\nhospital and the patient, the relationship of creditor and debtor remains intact--and,\n\npresumably, the patient will conduct his affairs accordingly; he might forego opportuni-\n\nties, and, generally, he will live under a cloud, assuming that everything he owns and\n\nacquires could eventually be subject to execution. See 51 Vill. L. Rev. at 102. In fact, the\n\nALJ found that \"[i]f a patient [paid] an amount on an account that was included in\n\n[Covenant's] bad debt expense, then the payment [was] recorded as a recovery to bad\n\ndebt.\" And so nothing really has changed between the patient and the hospital. The\n\n                                           - 43 -\n\fhospital merely has decided, for its own accounting purposes, that trying to enforce the\n\ndebt would be futile or economically unrewarding--hardly a decision that exudes the\n\n\"warmth and spontaneity indicative of [a] charitable impulse\" (Willows, 43 Ill. 2d at\n\n208, 251 N.E.2d at 252).\n\n              Because a gift is, as we have explained, an uncompensated transfer, the\n\nhospital cannot be someone's creditor with respect to a certain sum and simultaneously\n\nbe the person's charitable benefactor with respect to that same sum. A decision about\n\nthe futility of collection that a creditor makes in the privacy of his office does not vitiate\n\nthe contractual relationship between the creditor and debtor. Like any other gift, a gift\n\nin the form of forgiveness of debt requires some kind of delivery. Berry v. Berry, 238 Ill.\n\nApp. 507, 510 (1925); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§274, 277(1), at 366, 370\n\n(1981); 38 Am. Jur. 2d Gifts §45 (2008). Further, the supreme court has held:\n\n\"[W]here there is no proof of consideration for the forgiveness of a debt, an attempt to\n\nforgive a debt is ineffective either as a gift or as an executory contract.\" Ermold v. Bear,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3416342\"><a href=\"/opinion/3419877/ermold-v-bear/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3416342\"><a href=\"/opinion/3419877/ermold-v-bear/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186 (1934); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\n§273, at 364 (1981). It appears that once a hospital enters into a contract with a patient\n\nwhereby the patient agrees to pay for services, transforming that patient into a charita-\n\nble beneficiary is somewhat more complicated, legally, than simply making a notation in\n\nthe hospital's accounts. Provena has not explained how, from a legal point of view, this\n\ntransformation would have come about. See A. Noble & A. Hyams, Charitable Hospital\n\nAccountability: A Review and Analysis of Legal and Policy Initiatives, 26 J.L. Med. &\n\nEthics 116, 119 n.66 (1998) (\"American Association of Certified Public Accountants\n\nissued updated health care audit guidelines in 1990,\" under which \"hospitals must now\n\n                                            - 44 -\n\fsegregate bad debt from charity care on their financial statements. Bad debt is now\n\nreported as an expense. Charity care, considered services provided without expectation\n\nof payment, is reported as a footnote on the financial statement\").\n\n             We understand that probably half the time, the reason for default is that\n\nthe patient simply cannot pay. 37 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 513 (\"Some academic studies have\n\nshown that roughly 50% of hospital bad debt is likely due to inability to pay, rather than\n\nsimply debt avoidance or poor management\"). According to the ALJ's findings,\n\napproximately 60% of Covenant's inpatient admissions originate through the emergency\n\nroom--probably not an ideal place for a careful and methodical assessment of someone's\n\nfinancial situation. We can envision an argument that referral to a collection agency is\n\npart of the procedure of charity care. Through the services of the collection agency,\n\nCovenant assesses the extent of the patient's financial need, and once the collection\n\nagency validates the patient as an impoverished person, Covenant writes off the debt,\n\nand the write-off is charity. Setting aside the obstacle posed by Ermold, the main\n\nproblem with this argument is that Covenant continued to accept payments on what\n\nCovenant had designated, purely in its accounts, as bad debt.\n\n             We do not mean to put Covenant in a bad light simply because it uses\n\ncollection agencies. There is nothing wrong, per se, with a charitable organization using\n\ncollection agencies and even lawsuits to collect what is owed to it. As we have discussed,\n\ncharitable organizations may enter into contracts with those who are able to pay. It\n\nwould be illogical to say, on the one hand, that a charitable organization may enter into\n\na contract and, on the other hand, to forbid the charitable organization from insisting on\n\nthe performance of the contract. The resources of a charitable organization are finite,\n\n                                          - 45 -\n\fand those who fail to pay, even though they could pay without suffering economic\n\nhardship, effectively use resources that otherwise might have gone to the poor. In our\n\nmind, the only relevance of Covenant's sending accounts to collection agencies is the\n\nnegation of a charitable relationship with respect to the balances in those accounts. In\n\n2002, Covenant sent 10,085 accounts to collection agencies but gave charity care to only\n\n302 patients. Not all those 10,085 accounts, or maybe not even most of them, origi-\n\nnated from 2002, but the vast disparity between those numbers could strike a reason-\n\nable trier of fact as significant. As Provena says in its brief, there could be a variety of\n\nreasons for patients' failure to pay. One of the foremost reasons, however, surely would\n\nbe an inability to pay. The Director could reasonably infer that a lot of patients were not\n\nreceiving charity care who needed it.\n\n                           f. The Significance of the Stipulations\n\n              Provena argues that because the Department stipulated that Covenant\n\n\"dispenses health care to all who apply for it,\" \"regardless of their ability or inability to\n\npay for the service,\" it is established, as a matter of law, that Covenant provides charity\n\nto all who are in need. See In re Marriage of Sanborn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240426\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240426/in-re-marriage-of-sanborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

This is a non\n\nsequitur. Just because Covenant never turns a patient away because of the patient's\n\ninability to pay, it does not follow that Covenant thereby provides charity. If, despite the\n\npatient's inability to pay, the patient is contractually liable to reimburse Covenant for\n\nthe medical treatment, Covenant has extended no charity to that patient.\n\n                                      g.

See Rev. Rul. 69-545, 1969-2 C.B. 117-18; 37 Loy. U. Chi.

Do they depart from Covenant and bring\n\npatients back, or are they dispatched from a separate address? The Department\n\nsuggests, with citations to the record, that the majority of people transported by the\n\nambulances appear to be covered by third-party payers such as Blue Cross, the Civilian\n\nHealth and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), and health\n\nmaintenance organizations. Provena does not disagree. It is unclear to what extent the\n\n$888,091 for this item consists of the \"shortfall\" resulting from the discounted rates that\n\ninsurers paid. Such discounts would not be charitable. See Riverside Medical Center,\n\n342 Ill. App. 3d at 610, 795 N.E.2d at 367.\n\n                         C.

The Constitutional and Statutory Provisions\n\n              Section 6 of article IX of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 allows the\n\n                                            - 48 -\n\fGeneral Assembly to exempt \"property used exclusively for religious *** purposes.\" Ill.\n\nConst. 1970, art.

Because the county board of review never had an opportunity to consider\n\nwhether Covenant qualified for an exemption for religious purposes, the Department\n\nargues that Provena failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and is barred from\n\ninvoking section 15-40(a)(1) on appeal.

We agree\n\nwith Provena. We further note that in his decision, the Director addressed the substan-\n\ntive merits of Provena's claim of an exemption for religious purposes.\n\n                             3. The Effect of the Stipulations\n\n             In the administrative proceedings, the Department stipulated that\n\n                                          - 49 -\n\f\"Covenant's stated and ongoing mission is to serve as the Catholic health[-]care ministry\n\nand charitable hospital in the Champaign/Urbana area and to build communities of\n\nhealing and hope by compassionately responding to human need in the spirit of Jesus\n\nChrist\" and that Covenant was \"founded, organized, owned[,] and operated as an\n\napostolic mission and health[-]care ministry of the Catholic Church.\"\n\n              According to Provena, these stipulations compel a determination that\n\nCovenant is exempt under section 15-40(a)(1) (35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West 2002)).\n\nWe disagree. It is Covenant's actual practice, not merely its mission, which determines\n\nthe right to exemption. See Methodist Old Peoples Home, 39 Ill. 2d at 157, 233 N.E.2d\n\nat 542. The issue is not whether Covenant is operated as an \"apostolic mission and\n\nhealth care ministry of the Catholic Church\" but whether it is \"used exclusively for ***\n\nreligious purposes\" as case law defines that phrase. See 35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West\n\n2002). The stipulations do not squarely address that issue.\n\n              If \"religious purpose\" meant whatever one did in the name of religion, it\n\nwould be an unlimited and amorphous concept. Exemption would be the rule, and\n\ntaxation the exception. \"In a sense, everything a deeply devout person does has a\n\nreligious purpose.\" Faith Builders, 378 Ill.

We do not see how medical care\n\nresembles public worship, Sunday schools, or religious instruction. Cf. Calvary Baptist,\n\n349 Ill.

If the operation of the property is businesslike and more characteristic of\n\na place of commerce than a facility used primarily for religious purposes, the property is\n\nnot exempt from taxation under section 15-40(a)(1) (35 ILCS 200/15-40(a)(1) (West\n\n2002)).

Considerations of Public Policy\n\n              The amici warn that adverse social consequences will follow if we reverse\n\nthe circuit court's judgment and affirm the Director's decision. They say that with the\n\nnumber of uninsured Americans increasing and governmental programs failing to keep\n\nup with the rising cost of health care, not-for-profit hospitals already operate on thin\n\nmargins. The loss of the tax exemption would make these hospitals less attractive to\n\nlenders and would create a perverse economic incentive for the hospitals to shift\n\nresources away from community needs other than free or discounted medical care.\n\nBecause not-for-profit hospitals have no funds to spare, they would have no choice but\n\nto pass on to patients and commercial insurers the added cost of property taxes, and to\n\nthe extent they were unable to do so, they would have to cut services or even close their\n\n                                           - 52 -\n\fdoors, swelling the ranks of the uninsured and burdening the state with the indigent\n\npatients whom the hospitals formerly served, to the detriment of their bottom line.\n\n              These are arguments of public policy, and it is the legislature's job, not\n\nours, to make public policy. Board of Education of Dolton School District 149 v. Miller,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Instead, we strive to be faithful\n\nto the meaning of legislation and case law; and if these authorities, correctly interpreted,\n\ndo not readily apply to the modern polycorporate hospital, so be it. Just because the test\n\nfor exemption is, in some respects, \"anachronistic, a reflection of a time without\n\nthird[-]party pay[e]rs and sophisticated medical care[,] *** it does not necessarily follow\n\nthat the changed circumstances still merit a tax exemption. Instead, perhaps the\n\nexemption is as anachronistic as the reasons that originally gave rise to it. Things that\n\nwere once tax-exempt can become taxable if circumstances change.\" 16 Am. J.L. & Med.\n\nat 379.\n\n              In several jurisdictions, the decisions of which the American Hospital\n\nAssociation cites, the concept of \"charity\" has become so amorphous and so tractable as\n\nto be virtually devoid of meaning. \"A word that comes to mean everything in effect\n\nmeans nothing[ at all].\" 31 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. at 211. The term \"charity\" has become\n\nmagical gibberish to sanctify any socially beneficial use of property that a court deems\n\nworthy of subsidy. But our constitution already enumerates the uses of property that\n\nare categorically worthy of exemption--e.g., schools, cemeteries, agricultural and\n\nhorticultural societies--and hospitals are not among them. Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, §6.\n\nIf, under section 6 of article IX, property used for \"charitable purposes\" is simply\n\nproperty that is put to some publicly beneficial purpose, why would it be necessary to\n\n                                           - 53 -\n\fseparately list schools, for instance, and agricultural societies, which obviously use\n\nproperty in a publicly beneficial way by defeating ignorance and hunger? The way the\n\nconstitutional provision is phrased, it does not list schools and agricultural societies as\n\nexamples of charitable purposes ( by saying \"and other charitable purposes\" or words to\n\nthat effect).\n\n                As one commentator explains, the slippage of the meaning of \"charity\"\n\nbegan long ago, when the Statute of Charitable Uses (43 Eliz. 4 (1601)), codifying\n\ndevelopments in the English common law, expanded the meaning of \"charity\" beyond its\n\n\"commonly understood definition of economic relief for the poor,\" \"to encompass\n\nvirtually anything deemed to be in the public interest.\" 31 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. at 191-\n\n93. Because the Statute of Charitable Uses became part of Illinois common law (Conti-\n\nnental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3416920\"><a href=\"/opinion/3420408/continental-illinois-bank-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3416920\"><a href=\"/opinion/3420408/continental-illinois-bank-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252\n\n(1934); 5 ILCS 50/1 (West 2006)), the supreme court has held that \" '[c]harity,' in the\n\nlegal sense, is not confined to mere alms[]giving or the relief of poverty and distress but\n\nhas a wider signification, which embraces the improvement and promotion of the\n\nhappiness of man\" (Harris, 359 Ill. at 92, 194 N.E. at 253). But it is impossible to miss\n\nthe recurrent theme of charity care in the supreme court's decisions on the exemption of\n\nhospitals from taxation. It is as if the supreme court decided, early on, to resist any\n\nfurther dilution of the meaning of \"charity,\" by holding that improving and promoting\n\nthe happiness of man entailed dispensing charity care as needed. See Sisters of the\n\nThird Order, 231 Ill. at 322, 83 N.E. at 274 (\"so long as charity was dispensed to all those\n\nwho needed it and who applied therefor\").\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 54 -\n\f              The language we use in the State of Illinois to determine whether real\n\nproperty is used for a charitable purpose has its genesis in our 1870 constitution. It is\n\nobvious that such language may be difficult to apply to the modern face of our nation's\n\nhealthcare delivery systems. Even the seminal case in Illinois, Methodist Old Peoples\n\nHome v. Korzen, was decided when Medicare was in its infancy and Medicaid did not\n\nyet exist. The capital needs of a properly equipped modern hospital were not even\n\nimaginable in 1965. It is of obvious public benefit for any community to have available\n\none or more modern hospitals, but until such time as the legislature sees fit to either\n\nchange or make definite the formula for the determination of the medical/charitable use\n\nof real property, Provena cannot, on the record before us here, prevail in its attempt to\n\nexempt itself from real estate taxation.\n\n                                    III. CONCLUSION\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the circuit court's judgment.\n\n              Reversed.\n\n              McCULLOUGH and KNECHT, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 55 -\n\f</pre>",
