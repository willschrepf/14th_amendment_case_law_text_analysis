Davis, appellant, pleaded not guilty to aggravated robbery.  The jury\r\nfound him guilty and assessed punishment at 35 years’ confinement.  In three points\r\nof error, appellant contends that (1) the evidence is legally insufficient to support his\r\nconviction; (2) the trial court erred in excluding the complainant’s civil court\r\npleading; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion by denying him a mistrial</span></span><span><span>.  </span><span>We\r\naffirm.<span></span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>                                                                  </span></span></span></span><span><span><span>BACKGROUND</span><span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>             </span></span>Jeffrey Dailey, complainant,<span> </span>planned to spend one week at the beginning of\r\nMay 2002 at the Western Inn Motel as he prepared for his final examinations at the\r\nUniversity of Houston Law School.  On May 4, 2002, Dailey permitted an unknown\r\nfemale to enter his motel room after she asked to use his telephone.  While in the\r\nroom, the female telephoned someone and waited in complainant’s room until this\r\nperson arrived.</span></span><span><span>  After Dailey</span></span><span><span> released the door chain and answered the door</span></span><span>, five to\r\nseven people entered the room.  This group of people punched Dailey, kicked him,\r\nthrew him on the bed, cut the telephone line in his room, and threatened to kill him\r\nwith a knife.  Dailey</span><span> later testified that someone smoked crack cocaine during the\r\nrobbery and that his assailants stole his car, college ring, watch, wallet, and money\r\nfrom his bank account after he gave them his PIN number.  Soon, all of his assailants\r\nexcept appellant left Dailey’s motel room.  Appellant held <span>a</span></span><span> pocket knife to Dailey’s\r\nthroat and told him not to move. </span><span> Appellant was masturbating and wearing a condom. \r\nAfter appellant fell asleep, <span>Dailey</span></span><span> quietly escaped the motel room and called 911\r\nfrom the motel lobby.</span><span>  On May 5, 2002, at 1:52 a.m., Officer M. Romero responded\r\nto a robbery in progress.  Romero met Dailey in the lobby.  After Dailey told Romero\r\nhis room number, Romero went to Dailey’s motel room and found appellant sleeping \r\nwith a knife in his hand. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>Appellant testified that while he was at the motel, he heard a male voice crying\r\nfor help.  Appellant saw Dailey lying naked and flat on his back on the floor of\r\nDailey’s motel room.  Appellant told Dailey that he would stay with him while\r\nsomeone else left to call 911.  Appellant testified that as he placed Dailey on the bed,\r\nappellant became exhausted.  Appellant testified that because he had not taken his\r\nsecond insulin shot that day, he passed out because of a glucose reaction.  The first\r\nmemory appellant has after passing out is being awakened by Officer Romero. </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>Legal Sufficiency </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>of the Evidence</span></span><span>In his first point of error, appellant asserts that the evidence was legally\r\ninsufficient to support his conviction.  Specifically, appellant contends that the State\r\nfailed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the offense of\r\naggravated robbery.  </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>          </span>To establish the offense of aggravated robbery, the State had to prove that\r\nappellant</span></span><span> (1) in the course of committing theft, (2) with intent to obtain and maintain\r\ncontrol of property, (3) knowingly and intentionally, (4) threatened or placed another\r\nin fear of imminent bodily injury or death, and (5) then and there used or exhibited\r\na deadly weapon.<span>  Tex</span>. <span>Pen</span>. <span>Code Ann</span>. §29.03(a) (Vernon 2003).</span></span><span><span><span>  A legal-sufficiency challenge requires us to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, any rational trier of fact could have found the\r\nessential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  <i>King v. State</i>, 29\r\nS.W.3d 556, 562 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000); <i>Howley v. State</i>, 943 S.W.2d 152, 155\r\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no pet.).  As the </span></span></span><span><span><span>exclusive judges of the facts,\r\nthe jurors may believe or disbelieve all or any part of a witness’s testimony. \r\n<i>Penagraph v. State</i>, 623 S.W.2d 341, 343 (Tex. Crim. App. 1981).  </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>          </span>Appellant contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to prove that he\r\ncommitted the offense of aggravated robbery because (1) appellant testified that he\r\ndid not rob Dailey and had no information about the robbery; (2) Dailey is not\r\ncredible because he filed a civil lawsuit against the Western Inn Motel;</span></span></span><span><span> (3) evidence\r\nsuggests that Dailey may have invented the robbery to hide his own questionable\r\nactivity; and (4) </span></span><span><span>Officer Romero testified that he did not find a “crack pipe” or any\r\ncondoms in the motel room.</span></span><span><span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>Appellant’s first three complaints ask us to circumvent the jury verdict by\r\nfinding appellant more credible than Dailey.  The jury, which heard testimony from\r\nappellant and Dailey, was in the best position to determine who was more credible\r\nbased on their testimony and demeanor in court, and, on appeal, we will defer to the\r\njury’s assessment of credibility under these circumstances<i>.  See Cain v. State</i>, 958\r\nS.W.2d 404, 408-09 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997).  </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span><span>At trial, the State presented the testimony of Jeffrey Dailey, the complainant,\r\nthe only witness to the offense. </span><span> Dailey testified that one of his assailants pulled out\r\na knife with a three- to five-inch blade.  Dailey testified that, upon pulling out the\r\nknife, “they told me they were going to kill me.”  He also testified that, after they\r\nthreatened to kill him with the knife, they stole his car, college ring, watch, and\r\nwallet.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>Dailey identified appellant in court as part of the group of men and women who\r\nattacked </span></span><span><span>and robbed him in his motel room.  Dailey testified that appellant was in his\r\nmotel room from the </span><span>beginning of the attack.  </span></span><span><span>Dailey also testified that after the other\r\nassailants left, appellant stayed in the room and kept Dailey at knifepoint, telling him\r\nnot to move.  When asked whether he was sure the person who did this was appellant,\r\nDailey responded, “Yeah, it’s him.  I know that for a fact.” </span></span><span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>          </span>Appellant’s fourth complaint asserts that Dailey is not credible because the\r\nphysical evidence is inconsistent with his testimony.  </span></span><span><span><span>Dailey</span></span><span> testified that someone\r\nsmoked crack during the robbery, that appellant was masturbating after the other\r\nassailants left the room, and that appellant was wearing a condom.  Although </span>Officer\r\nRomero did not find a crack pipe or a condom in the motel room, Officer Romero\r\ntestified that he did not conduct an extensive search of the motel room.  To convict\r\nappellant for aggravated robbery, the State was not required to prove that appellant\r\nsmoked crack, masturbated, or wore a condom.  <span></span><span><i>See</i><span> Tex</span>. <span>Pen</span>. <span>Code Ann</span>. §29.03(a)\r\n(Vernon 2003).</span>  Any inconsistencies between Dailey’s testimony and Romero’s\r\ntestimony would not render </span><span>the evidence legally insufficient.</span><span><span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>It is well established that a conviction may be based on the testimony of a\r\nsingle eyewitness.  <i>Aguilar v. State</i>, 468 S.W.2d 75, 77 (Tex. Crim. App. 1971);\r\n<i>Lewis v. State</i>, 126 S.W.3d 572, 575 (Tex. App.<span>—</span>Texarkana 2004, pet. ref’d).  The\r\ndetermination of what weight to give testimonial evidence is within the sole province\r\nof the jury, as it turns on an evaluation of credibility and demeanor.  <i><span>Cain</span></i><span>, 958\r\nS.W.2d at </span>408-09.  The jury is free to believe or disbelieve all or any part of the\r\nState’s witnesses’ testimony.  <i>Id</i>.  A court of appeals must show deference to such a\r\njury finding.  <i>Id</i>. at 409. </span><span><span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier\r\nof fact could have found that appellant committed robbery while </span><span>using or exhibiting\r\na deadly weapon.  Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was legally sufficient to\r\nsupport appellant’s </span><span>conviction for aggravated robbery. <span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>We overrule appellant’s first point of error. <span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>Admissibility of Complainant’s Petition</span><span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>             </span></span></span>In his second point of error, appellant contends </span><span>the trial court abused its\r\n</span><span>discretion by refusing to admit into evidence Dailey’s civil pleading filed in his civil\r\nlawsuit against the motel where the offense occurred.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span><span>  Appellant argues that he could\r\nnot cross-examine </span>Dailey</span><span><span> about any inconsistencies between the civil pleading and\r\nhis in-court testimony in the criminal case at bar</span></span><span><span>.  Appellant argues that </span></span><span>Dailey</span><span><span>’s\r\npleading, which was made by </span>Dailey<span>’s attorney with </span><span>Dailey</span><span>’s authorization, </span></span><span><span>is\r\nadmissible as </span></span><span><span>an admission of a party opponent </span></span><span><span>under Texas Rule of Evidence\r\n801(e)(2)(c).  <i>See </i><span>Tex.

App.<span><span>—</span></span>Houston [1st Dist.] 2000,\r\npet. ref’d). <span> The trial court has wide discretion in determining the admissibility of\r\nevidence and its ruling will not be disturbed as long as it is “within the zone of\r\nreasonable disagreement.”  </span></span><i><span>Montgomery</span></i><span>, 810 S.W.2d at 391.  <span>A trial court’s ruling\r\nwill be upheld if reasonably supported by the record and correct on any theory of law\r\napplicable to the case.  <i>See Willover v.

State</i>, 129 S.W.3d 116, 124 (Tex. Crim.

The trial\r\ncourt twice sustained the State’s objections that the statements in the pleadings were\r\nhearsay because they were not the complaining witness’s statements.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span><span>  Appellant later\r\nmade an </span></span><span><span>oral offer </span><span>of proof concerning the testimony to which appellant anticipated\r\n</span></span><span>Dailey</span><span><span> would provide in response to questions </span></span><span><span>regarding possible inconsistencies\r\nwith his trial testimony and the pleading.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span><span>  After his offer of proof, appellant\r\nattempted to introduce the complainant’s pleading as non-hearsay statements made\r\nby an agent or a person authorized by a party-opponent under Texas Rule of Evidence\r\n801(e)(2)(c) and (d), but the trial court denied appellant’s request.  </span></span><span><span><span>Tex.

When dealing with admissions, the concern is not\r\nabout the reliability and trustworthiness of an out-of-court statement.  <i>Bell v. State</i>,\r\n877 S.W.2d 21, 24 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, pet. ref’d).  Admissions are admitted\r\nbecause a party should not be allowed to exclude his own statement on the ground\r\nthat what he said is untrustworthy.  <i>Id</i>. at 24.  When a party’s own out-of-court\r\nstatement is offered against him, “it would be most incongruous to permit him to\r\nobject to it by claiming that it is untrustworthy and should not be received because\r\nit was not given under oath, in the presence of the trier of fact, and subject to\r\ncross-examination.”  <i>Godwin v. State</i>, 899 S.W.2d 387, 390 (Tex.

App.—El Paso 1995, pet. ref’d).</span></span><span><span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span></span><span><span>The threshold issue is whether a complaining witness for the State can be a\r\n“party-opponent” in a criminal case under Texas Rule of Evidence 801(e)(2)(c).  In\r\n<i>Willover v. State</i>, this Court held that statements of a complainant were admissions\r\nby a “party-opponent” in a criminal case and, as such, not hearsay.  38 S.W.3d 672,\r\n676 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st. Dist.] 2000), <i>rev’d on other grounds</i>, 70 S.W.3d 841\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2002)</span></span><span><span><i>.</i>  The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed this Court’s\r\nopinion on other grounds and found it “need not address the Court of </span></span><span><span>Appeals holding\r\nthat ‘when [Rule 801(e)(2)] uses the term ‘admission by party-opponent,’ it includes\r\nthose of the defendant and the complaining witness.’”  <i>Willover</i>, 70 S.W.3d  at 848\r\nn.10.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>This Court’s holding in <i>Willover</i> has been criticized on the ground that the\r\nState, not the victim, is the party-opponent of the accused in a criminal proceeding. \r\n<i>See, e.g., Logan v. State</i>, 71 S.W.3d 865, 869 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2002, pet.\r\nref’d)</span></span><span><span>.  Since <i>Willover</i>, the Second Court of Appeals </span></span><span><span>held in <i>Logan v. State</i>, contrary\r\nto this Court’s holding in <i>Willover</i>, that a statement by a victim or complainant in a\r\ncriminal case is <i>not</i> admissible under rule 801(e)(2) as an admission by a party\r\nopponent.  <i>Id</i>.  </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span></span><span><span>A complaining witness is a crime victim who has no control over what charges\r\nthe State brings against an accused, who the State charges, and when the State brings\r\nthe charges.  Perhaps more importantly, the complainant has no authority over the\r\ndisposition of the offense, whether charges are dismissed or pursued, or what\r\nsentence a defendant ultimately receives.  The State may bring charges against a\r\ndefendant even though the complaining witness declines to pursue the charges,\r\nrefuses to testify at trial, or testifies on behalf of the defendant at trial.  Similarly, a\r\ncomplaining witness’s desire that charges against a defendant be dropped has no legal\r\neffect on the State’s charges against a defendant.  It is axiomatic that a party has the\r\nauthority to pursue or not to pursue charges, and to resolve the charges with or\r\nwithout a trial.

Specifically, he alleges that the\r\ntrial court improperly commented on the weight of the evidence in the presence of the\r\njury.  Appellant argues that the trial judge took an adversarial position against\r\nappellant in the presence of the jury</span><span> and implied that appellant was engaging in\r\nunethical or illegal conduct when he told appellant, “You can’t do that,” after\r\nappellant asked a witness a question.<span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>            </span></span>The standard of review for a trial court’s denial of a motion for mistrial is abuse\r\nof discretion.  <i>Ladd v.

A mistrial\r\nis a device used to halt trial proceedings when error is so prejudicial that expenditure\r\nof further time and expense would be wasteful and futile.  <i>See Sewell v. State</i>, 696\r\nS.W.2d 559, 560 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983)</span><span>.  Thus, a trial court may properly exercise\r\nits discretion to declare a mistrial if a verdict of conviction could be reached, but\r\nwould have to be reversed on appeal due to an obvious procedural error in the trial. \r\n<i>Id.</i>  The determination of whether a given error necessitates a mistrial must be made\r\nby examining the particular </span><span>facts of the case.  <i>Hernandez v.

The objection will be sufficient to preserve error for appellate review if the\r\nobjection communicates to the trial judge what the objecting party wants, why the\r\nobjecting party thinks himself or herself entitled to relief, and does so in a manner\r\nclear enough for the judge to understand the objection and request at a time when the\r\ntrial court is in a position to do something about it.  <i>Lankston v.

In three points\r\nof error, appellant contends that (1) the evidence is legally insufficient to support his\r\nconviction; (2) the trial court erred in excluding the complainant’s civil court\r\npleading; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion by denying him a mistrial</span></span><span><span>.  </span><span>We\r\naffirm.<span></span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>                                                                  </span></span></span></span><span><span><span>BACKGROUND</span><span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>             </span></span>Jeffrey Dailey, complainant,<span> </span>planned to spend one week at the beginning of\r\nMay 2002 at the Western Inn Motel as he prepared for his final examinations at the\r\nUniversity of Houston Law School.  On May 4, 2002, Dailey permitted an unknown\r\nfemale to enter his motel room after she asked to use his telephone.  While in the\r\nroom, the female telephoned someone and waited in complainant’s room until this\r\nperson arrived.</span></span><span><span>  After Dailey</span></span><span><span> released the door chain and answered the door</span></span><span>, five to\r\nseven people entered the room.  This group of people punched Dailey, kicked him,\r\nthrew him on the bed, cut the telephone line in his room, and threatened to kill him\r\nwith a knife.  Dailey</span><span> later testified that someone smoked crack cocaine during the\r\nrobbery and that his assailants stole his car, college ring, watch, wallet, and money\r\nfrom his bank account after he gave them his PIN number.  Soon, all of his assailants\r\nexcept appellant left Dailey’s motel room.  Appellant held <span>a</span></span><span> pocket knife to Dailey’s\r\nthroat and told him not to move. </span><span> Appellant was masturbating and wearing a condom. \r\nAfter appellant fell asleep, <span>Dailey</span></span><span> quietly escaped the motel room and called 911\r\nfrom the motel lobby.</span><span>  On May 5, 2002, at 1:52 a.m., Officer M. Romero responded\r\nto a robbery in progress.  Romero met Dailey in the lobby.  After Dailey told Romero\r\nhis room number, Romero went to Dailey’s motel room and found appellant sleeping \r\nwith a knife in his hand. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>Appellant testified that while he was at the motel, he heard a male voice crying\r\nfor help.  Appellant saw Dailey lying naked and flat on his back on the floor of\r\nDailey’s motel room.  Appellant told Dailey that he would stay with him while\r\nsomeone else left to call 911.  Appellant testified that as he placed Dailey on the bed,\r\nappellant became exhausted.  Appellant testified that because he had not taken his\r\nsecond insulin shot that day, he passed out because of a glucose reaction.  The first\r\nmemory appellant has after passing out is being awakened by Officer Romero. </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>Legal Sufficiency </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>of the Evidence</span></span><span>In his first point of error, appellant asserts that the evidence was legally\r\ninsufficient to support his conviction.

Perhaps more importantly, the complainant has no authority over the\r\ndisposition of the offense, whether charges are dismissed or pursued, or what\r\nsentence a defendant ultimately receives.  The State may bring charges against a\r\ndefendant even though the complaining witness declines to pursue the charges,\r\nrefuses to testify at trial, or testifies on behalf of the defendant at trial.  Similarly, a\r\ncomplaining witness’s desire that charges against a defendant be dropped has no legal\r\neffect on the State’s charges against a defendant.  It is axiomatic that a party has the\r\nauthority to pursue or not to pursue charges, and to resolve the charges with or\r\nwithout a trial.  The party here is the State of Texas, not the complaining witness.  </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span></span></span><span><span>We now conclude that the complainant in a criminal prosecution is not a party\r\nwithin the meaning of rule 801(e)(2) and that we erred by holding to the contrary in\r\n<i>Willover</i>.  </span></span><span><span>We overrule <i>Willover</i>’s holding that a complaining witness is a party\r\nopponent.  <i>See Willover</i>, 38 S.W.3d at 676</span></span><span><span>.  Because a statement by a complainant in\r\na criminal case is not admissible under rule 801(e)(2), then a statement made by a\r\nperson authorized by complainant to make a </span></span><span><span>statement is not admissible under rule\r\n801(e)(2)(c). </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>We hold that </span></span><span><span>the trial court properly sustained the State’s objection to\r\nappellant’s offer of Dailey’s civil pleading</span></span><span><span> because the petition was not an admission\r\nof a party opponent under rule 801(e)(2)(c).</span></span><span><span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>Because we find that Dailey’s civil pleading would contain inadmissible\r\nhearsay, we do not reach the issue of whether admission of the pleading would also\r\nbe barred by the attorney-client privilege under rule 503.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>We overrule appellant’s second point of error. <span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>Motion for Mistrial</span><span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>          </span>In his third point of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its\r\n</span><span>discretion by denying appellant’s motion for mistrial.  Specifically, he alleges that the\r\ntrial court improperly commented on the weight of the evidence in the presence of the\r\njury.  Appellant argues that the trial judge took an adversarial position against\r\nappellant in the presence of the jury</span><span> and implied that appellant was engaging in\r\nunethical or illegal conduct when he told appellant, “You can’t do that,” after\r\nappellant asked a witness a question.<span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>            </span></span>The standard of review for a trial court’s denial of a motion for mistrial is abuse\r\nof discretion.  <i>Ladd v.
