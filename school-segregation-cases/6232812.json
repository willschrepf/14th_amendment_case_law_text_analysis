Parent, Jr. (Parent), and\nA.J. Parent Company, Inc., which is otherwise known as America’s Printer (America’s\nPrinter), of which Parent is also the president, sole shareholder and director. The plaintiff\nemployees alleged wage and hour claims under the Labor Code and the Fair Labor\nStandards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.) (FLSA), claims under the unfair\ncompetition law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200), and a claim under the Labor Code Private\n                                                                        1\nAttorneys General Act of 2004 (PAGA) (Lab. Code, § 2699 et seq.).\n                The plaintiffs challenge four rulings: The denial of their revised motion to\ncompel further responses to a set of document requests; the concomitant issuance of\n\n\n1\n    All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n                                               2\n\fdiscovery sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel; an order only partially granting plaintiffs’\nmotion to certify a class action; and the trial court’s statement of decision determining\nthat Parent and America’s Printer were not Koji’s alter egos and Parent was not liable to\nplaintiffs as a joint employer with regard to their state law claims.\n               We resolve doubts about our appellate jurisdiction by exercising our\ndiscretion to treat plaintiffs’ appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate. We grant writ\nrelief with regard to each challenged ruling and hold:\n               1. The trial court erred by granting the motion to certify a class as to\nplaintiffs’ claims against only Koji’s because the court applied improper criteria in\ndetermining Parent’s potential liability as a joint employer on a class-wide basis.\n               2. The trial court prejudicially erred by denying plaintiffs’ revised motion\nto compel further responses to a set of document requests, and also by sanctioning\nplaintiffs’ counsel.\n               3. Because, as set forth in the disposition, we direct the trial court to vacate\nits order denying the revised motion to compel further responses to discovery on alter ego\nissues, we direct the court to also vacate its findings that Parent and America’s Printer\nwere not Koji’s alter egos. Even if we did not direct the trial court to vacate its alter ego\nfindings because of the court’s error in denying the revised motion compel, we would\nnevertheless order the court to vacate those findings because the court applied incorrect\nlegal standards for alter ego liability.\n               4. Although the court’s statement of decision correctly cites Martinez v.\nCombs (2010) 49 Cal.4th 35 (Martinez) as setting forth the three alternative definitions of\n“employer” applied in analyzing certain violations of the Labor Code and the Industrial\nWelfare Commission’s (IWC) wage orders, the statement of decision misapplied those\ndefinitions. In addition, the trial court failed to address whether Parent might be a joint\nemployer under the definitions of the term “employer” applicable to plaintiffs’ claims\nunder the unfair competition law, the tip misappropriation statute, and PAGA.\n\n                                               3\n\f                                      BACKGROUND\n               In 2000, Koji’s was incorporated by Parent and, at all times relevant to this\ncase, Parent has been Koji’s president, sole shareholder, and director. Koji’s owned one\nsushi and shabu-shabu restaurant in Hollywood, and another such restaurant in Orange\nCounty. Each individually named plaintiff was employed by Koji’s and worked at one or\nboth of its restaurants at some point during November 2006 through February 2012.\nKoji’s was not a profitable business and, by early 2012, had closed both restaurants.\n                                              I.\n    PLAINTIFFS INITIATE THIS ACTION; PLAINTIFFS FILE THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT.\n               In November 2010, Amanda Quiles, Heather Turman, and Kimberly Dang\n(plaintiffs), as individuals and “on behalf of all others similarly situated, and on behalf of\nthe general public,” filed a proposed class action against, inter alia, Koji’s and Parent,\nasserting several state and federal wage and hour claims, and violation of California’s\nunfair competition law. (Quiles v. Koji’s Japan (Apr. 3, 2015, G049238) [nonpub.\nopn.].)\n               In December 2012, plaintiffs filed their “third amended class and collective\naction complaint for damages, restitution and injunctive relief” against Koji’s and Parent,\n                              2\nand added America’s Printer as a defendant. The third amended complaint contained\nclaims for (1) failure to pay overtime wages in violation of sections 510, 1194, and 1198,\nand IWC wage order No. 5-2001 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 11050) (IWC wage order No.\n5-2001) (first cause of action); (2) failure to pay earned wages upon discharge and\nwaiting time penalties in violation of sections 201 through 203 (second cause of action);\n(3) failure to provide timely, accurate, and itemized wage statements in violation of\nsection 226 (third cause of action); (4) failure to provide rest breaks and meal periods in\n\n2\n America’s Printer was incorporated by Parent in 1998 and is in the business of providing\nprinting services. As is the case with Koji’s, Parent is America’s Printer’s sole\nshareholder, president, and director.\n\n                                              4\n\fviolation of IWC wage order No. 5-2001, and sections 226.7 and 512 (fourth cause of\naction); (5) failure to compensate for all hours worked in violation of sections 221 and\n223 and IWC wage order No. 5-2001 (fifth cause of action); (6) misappropriation of tips\nby the employer and the employer’s agents in violation of section 351 and Business and\nProfessions Code section 17200 (sixth cause of action); (7) failure to pay the minimum\nwage in violation of sections 1182.11, 1182.12, 1182.13, 1194, and 1997, and “the\nCalifornia Minimum Wage Order, MW-2001” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 11000) (seventh\ncause of action); (8) violation of the FLSA (29 U.S.C. §§ 206, 207, 216) (eighth cause of\naction); (9) violation of the unfair competition law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200) (ninth\ncause of action); and (10) recovery of civil penalties pursuant to PAGA (twelfth cause of\n           3\naction).\n               The third amended complaint alleged Parent was a joint employer of\nplaintiffs and putative class members, and alleged Parent’s involvement in Koji’s\noperations as its president and sole shareholder by which Parent directly or indirectly\nemployed or exercised control over wages, hours, and working conditions and “suffered\nand/or permitted” employment. The third amended complaint also alleged facts\nsupporting its assertion Parent and America’s Printer were alter egos of Koji’s.\n                                     II.\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRANTS PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION ONLY AS TO\n             KOJI’S BUT NOT AS TO PARENT OR AMERICA’S PRINTER.\n               In January 2013, plaintiffs filed an amended notice of motion for class\ncertification seeking an order that the case proceed as a class action under section 382 of\nthe Code of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs sought certification of the following class: “All\n\n3\n  The third amended complaint also contained as the tenth and eleventh causes of action\nindividual claims for retaliation for engaging in protected activity in violation of section\n98.6 and in violation of the FLSA (29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3)), and for retaliation for filing a\nFLSA complaint. Those two causes of action were solely applicable to plaintiff Quiles,\nwere separately adjudicated, and are not at issue in this case. During the pendency of this\nappeal, Quiles was dismissed as an appellant.\n\n                                             5\n\fpersons who were employed by Defendants as servers, hosts/hostesses, floor managers,\nsushi chefs, assistant general managers, bussers, dishwashers, bartenders, kitchen helpers,\nand ‘barbacks,’ at any time from November 16, 2006, to the date of the final disposition\nof this case.” Plaintiff also sought certification of a tip misappropriation subclass: “All\npersons who were employed by Defendants as servers, hosts/hostesses, floor managers,\nassistant general managers, bussers, dishwashers, bartenders, and ‘barbacks,’ at any time\nfrom November 16, 2006, through the date of the final disposition of this action.”\n              In February 2013, the trial court certified the class as to “Koji’s . . . only as\nemployer of the class and only as to those causes of action derivative of the alleged meal\nand rest violations,” namely the first through fifth, ninth, and twelfth causes of action. A\nclass was not certified as to the seventh or eighth causes of action for violation of the\nwage order setting the minimum wage or for violation of the FLSA. The court also\ncertified a tip-pooling subclass defined as “[a]ll persons who were employed by\nDefendant Koji’s as servers, hosts/hostesses, bussers, bartenders, and ‘barbacks,’ at any\ntime from November 16, 2006, through the date of the final disposition in this action.”\n              The court explained its reasoning for partially denying the motion for class\ncertification in a minute order dated February 22, 2013: “The Plaintiffs have stated that\ntheir only employer was Koji’s, not Mr. Parent, and based on that and the fact that no\ncause of action is stated against Mr. Parent for joint employer liability the Motion for\nClass Certification is only granted as to Koji’s. The Motion only establishes a basis for\nclass certification concerning the issues of meal and rest breaks and tip-pooling and does\nnot address the other claims or Causes of Action asserted by the Plaintiffs and therefore\nthe Motion is only granted as to those issues, and the derivat[iv]e claims arising from\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthem. There is insufficient evidence to establish that a tip-pooling claim can be pursued\n                                                                           4\nby employees other than servers, and so, a sub-class will be certified.”\n              Following the court’s ruling on the motion for class certification, only the\nnamed plaintiffs’ individual claims against Parent (as a joint employer or alter ego of\nKoji’s) and against America’s Printer (as an alter ego of Koji’s) survived.\n                                       III.\n      THE TRIAL COURT DENIES PLAINTIFFS’ REVISED MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER\n    RESPONSES TO DOCUMENT REQUESTS AND ALSO SANCTIONS PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL.\n              The trial court stayed discovery relating to the class action claims, but\npermitted discovery on the discrete issue of alter ego liability. Plaintiffs filed a motion\nfor an order compelling further responses from Parent regarding their request for\nproduction of documents.\n              At the hearing on the motion to compel, the trial court and the parties’\ncounsel discussed the court’s tentative decision to deny the motion to compel on the\nground its supporting separate statement was incomplete. The court found the separate\nstatement procedurally defective because it set forth the factual and legal reasons for\ngranting the motion in one place instead of stating the factual and legal reasons following\neach request and response. The court also noted that no meet and confer process\nappeared to have taken place after plaintiffs received Parent’s supplemental responses\nand document production.\n              Plaintiffs’ counsel described the parties’ extensive meet and confer efforts\nleading up to the plaintiffs’ receipt of what they considered inadequate and incomplete\nresponses. Plaintiffs’ counsel also explained the short time frame between receiving\n\n\n4\n In a minute order dated May 6, 2013, the trial court made corrections to its February 22,\n2013 minute order nunc pro tunc that are not at issue in this appeal. In the May 6 minute\norder, the court confirmed that accuracy of the statement of the court’s reasoning for\npartially denying the motion for class certification set forth in the February 22 minute\norder.\n\n                                              7\n\fthose responses and the deadline to file the motion to compel. The trial court stated that\nthe motion to compel would be denied “without prejudice” because if counsel provided a\nseparate statement that reiterated the legal and factual analysis for each request, it “might\nproduce a different result.” After confirming the futility of further meet and confer\nefforts with counsel for the parties, the trial court stated it was “not going to require you\nto further meet and confer, let’s put it that way, if somebody wants to bring a motion”\nand reiterated that the order denying the motion to compel would say “without\nprejudice.”\n              Notwithstanding the trial court’s assurances, it appears the court signed its\ntentative order without stating that no further meet and confer efforts would be required\nand that the motion would be denied without prejudice. Plaintiffs revised their separate\nstatement and filed a revised motion the same day as the hearing on the original motion to\ncompel.\n              Before the hearing on the revised motion to compel, the case was assigned\nto a new trial judge. In a January 2014 minute order, the court denied the revised motion\nto compel and awarded defendants $960 in sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel “for\nbringing this Motion which again fails to meet the requirements of the Discovery Act and\nthis Court’s prior Order.” Noting that the trial court had denied the original motion to\ncompel on the ground plaintiffs and their counsel failed to provide a complete and proper\nseparate statement in support of that motion and failed to meet and confer with regard to\nthe supplemental responses, the court denied the revised motion on the ground it\n“contains no evidence that such meet and confer process has taken place. It therefore\nmust be denied again. In fact, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this Motion the very same day the\nCourt made its prior ruling, December 6, 2013, showing a complete disregard for this\nCourt’s prior Order.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f                                       IV.\n    FOLLOWING A BENCH TRIAL ON THE ISSUES OF JOINT EMPLOYER AND ALTER EGO\n LIABILITY, THE TRIAL COURT ISSUES A STATEMENT OF DECISION CONCLUDING PARENT\n IS A JOINT EMPLOYER ONLY AS TO PLAINTIFFS’ INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS UNDER THE FLSA\n   AND THAT NEITHER PARENT NOR AMERICA’S PRINTER IS AN ALTER EGO OF KOJI’S.\n\n              The parties agreed to a bench trial on the issues of whether Parent and\nAmerica’s Printer were potentially liable as alter egos of Koji’s and whether Parent was\npotentially liable as a joint employer with Koji’s. Plaintiffs’ counsel remarked, “there’s\nreally no case to pursue if there is—if it’s only the corporate entity [Koji’s]. I mean, it’s\na dead case. There’s no solvent entity.” Defendants’ counsel agreed, stating: “If Mr.\nParent is in the case, [plaintiffs’ counsel] can proceed profitably for his clients, for the\nclass members. If Mr. Parent is not in the case, it’s going to go nowhere because the\ncorporate defendant Koji’s has no assets and it’s not in business.”\n              A bench trial on the issues of alter ego and joint employer status was held\nin January and February 2015. The trial court issued a tentative ruling and plaintiffs\nrequested a statement of decision with 147 requests. Plaintiffs filed 154 objections to the\ncourt’s proposed statement of decision. In April 2015, the trial court issued its “statement\nof decision regarding the trial on issues of alter ego and joint employment.”\n              In the final statement of decision, the court noted it was not required to\nrespond point-by-point to the issues posed by plaintiffs but must disclose the court’s\ndetermination as to the ultimate facts and material issues in the case. In the statement of\ndecision, the court ruled: (1) neither Parent nor America’s Printer was liable as an alter\nego of Koji’s; (2) Parent was not liable as a joint employer as to the causes of action\nbrought under state law; and (3) Parent was a joint employer for purposes of the FLSA\ncause of action.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f          PARENT AND AMERICA’S PRINTER’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL\n                        DISMISSAL OF APPEAL\n              Parent and America’s Printer filed a motion requesting that we dismiss\nportions of this appeal they contend are not ripe. They argue the only issue that is ripe\nfor appeal is “the severable portion” of the trial court’s decision that America’s Printer is\nnot the alter ego of Koji’s, as that determination takes America’s Printer out of the case.\nThey therefore request the dismissal of plaintiffs’ appeal as to whether Parent is a joint\nemployer for purposes of state wage claims and is Koji’s alter ego, as Parent is still in the\ncase as a defendant with regard to the violation of the FLSA claim. They also request\ndismissal of the appeal as to the court’s order partially granting the motion for class\ncertification and the order denying plaintiffs’ revised motion to compel further responses\nand issuing sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel.\n              In their opposition, plaintiffs argue that the trial court’s rulings up through\nits determination that Parent was a joint employer and Parent and America’s Printer were\nnot Koji’s alter egos trigger the so-called death knell doctrine, thereby making all the\nsubject rulings appealable because the putative class members will not be able, as a\npractical matter, to pursue their claims given Koji’s insolvent status. Plaintiffs argue, in\nthe alternative, that this court may treat the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate.\n              We may treat an improper appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate in\nunusual circumstances. (Olson v. Cory (1983) 35 Cal.3d 390, 400-401.) It is appropriate\nto treat an appeal from a nonappealable judgment as a petition for extraordinary writ\nwhen requiring the parties to wait for entry of final judgment might lead to unnecessary\ntrial proceedings, the briefs and the record include the necessary elements for a writ of\nmandate, there is no indication the trial court would appear as a party in the writ\nproceeding, the appealability of the order was not clear, and all parties urge the court to\ndecide the issue rather than dismiss the appeal. (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f              Here, the briefs and the record include the necessary elements for a writ of\nmandate and there is no indication the trial court would appear in a writ proceeding. The\nparties’ counsel have agreed on the record that the trial court rulings have in effect\nresulted in preventing a class action from going forward because the remaining certified\nclass claims are against a single entity (Koji’s) which is insolvent. Requiring the parties\nto wait for final judgment following litigation of the remaining issues might lead to\nunnecessary trial proceedings. Although defendants would like us to dismiss portions of\nthe appeal for lack of jurisdiction, on balance the circumstances justify treating plaintiffs’\nappeal as a petition for a writ of mandate. Therefore, we deny defendants’ motion for\npartial dismissal of this appeal.\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                       I.\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY PARTIALLY GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO\n                                CERTIFY A CLASS.\n              The trial court certified a class action as to all of the claims contained in the\nthird amended complaint except plaintiffs’ claims for violation of the FLSA and violation\nof the minimum wage order and Quiles’s individual claims for wrongful termination and\nretaliation. Plaintiffs do not challenge the court’s class certification order with regard to\nthe claims that were and were not certified for class action treatment. Rather, plaintiffs\ncontend the court erred by granting their motion to certify claims against Koji’s only and\nthus not including those claims alleged against Parent on a theory of joint employer\nliability.\n                                              A.\n                 General Class Action Principles and Standard of Review\n              “Code of Civil Procedure section 382 authorizes class actions ‘when the\nquestion is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fnumerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court . . . .’ The party\nseeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable\nclass and a well-defined community of interest among class members. [Citations.] The\n‘community of interest’ requirement embodies three factors: (1) predominant common\nquestions of law or fact; (2) class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the\nclass; and (3) class representatives who can adequately represent the class. [Citation.]”\n(Sav-On Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 34 Cal.4th 319, 326 (Sav-On ).)\n              The question of class certification is essentially procedural and does not\ninvolve the legal or factual merits of the action. (Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 326.)\nThe ultimate question in ruling on a class certification motion is whether the issues which\nmay be adjudicated as a class, when compared with the issues which must be adjudicated\nindividually, are sufficiently numerous or substantial to make a class action advantageous\nto both the litigants and the judicial process. (Ibid.)\n              Trial courts have discretion in granting or denying motions for class\ncertification because they are well situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities\nof permitting a class action. (Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 326.) Despite this grant of\ndiscretion, appellate review of orders denying class certification differs from ordinary\nappellate review. Generally, we do not address the trial court’s reasoning and consider\nonly whether the result was correct. (Kaldenbach v. Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co.\n(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 843 (Kaldenbach).) But when denying class certification,\nthe trial court must state its reasons, and we must review those reasons for correctness.\n(Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435-436.) We may only consider the\nreasons stated by the trial court and must ignore any unexpressed reason that might\nsupport the ruling. (Id.; Kaldenbach, supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at p. 844; see also Bufil v.\nDollar Financial Group, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1205.)\n              We will affirm an order denying class certification if any of the trial court’s\nstated reasons was valid and sufficient to justify the order, and is supported by substantial\n\n                                              12\n\fevidence. (Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp. 326–327; see also Kaldenbach, supra, 178\nCal.App.4th at p. 844 [“We may not reverse, however, simply because some of the\ncourt’s reasoning was faulty, so long as any of the stated reasons are sufficient to justify\nthe order”].) We must reverse an order denying class certification if the trial court used\nimproper criteria or made erroneous legal assumptions, even if substantial evidence\nsupported the order. (Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp. 326–327; Linder v. Thrifty Oil\nCo., supra, 23 Cal.4th at pp. 435–436.) A trial court’s decision that rests on an error of\nlaw is an abuse of discretion. (In re Tobacco II Cases (2009) 46 Cal.4th 298, 311; Pfizer\nInc. v. Superior Court (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 622, 629.)\n                                           B.\n    The Trial Court’s Stated Reason for Denying Class Certification of Claims Alleged\n                   Against Parent as a Joint Employer Was Improper.\n              Here, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class as to state\nlaw claims against Koji’s only, although the same claims were alleged in the third\n                                                             5\namended complaint against Parent and America’s Printer, also. In certifying the class,\nthe court was required to have found plaintiffs established the existence of both an\nascertainable class and a well-defined community of interest among class members. In\nreviewing the court’s decision to deny class certification of these claims as against Parent\non a theory of joint employer liability, based on the authorities discussed ante, we must\nconsider the reasons stated by the trial court and ignore any unexpressed reason that\nmight support the ruling.\n              Citing Knapp v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 932,\n939, plaintiffs contend the trial court committed reversible error by failing to state in the\norder its reasons for denying the motion for class certification against Parent. To the\ncontrary, in Knapp a panel of this court stated: “The trial court was not required to state\n\n\n5\n  Plaintiffs do not challenge the trial court’s ruling on the motion to certify a class with\nregard to claims alleged against America’s Printer.\n\n                                              13\n\fits reasons in the order denying the motion. Instead, we review the entire record to\ndetermine whether the trial court’s reasons were expressed.” (Ibid.)\n              In any event, here the trial court, in its February 22, 2013 minute order, did\nexpress its reason for declining to certify the class action claims against Parent: “The\nPlaintiffs have stated that their only employer was Koji’s, not Mr. Parent, and based on\nthat and the fact that no cause of action is stated against Mr. Parent for joint employer\nliability the Motion for Class Certification is only granted as to Koji’s.”\n              The third amended complaint asserts plaintiffs’ claims against all\ndefendants and specifically incorporates allegations that Parent was liable as a joint\nemployer into each cause of action. Although it is true the individual plaintiffs’ and\nputative class members’ declarations filed in support of the motion for class certification\neach began with a statement that each had been employed by Koji’s, that statement is not\ninconsistent with plaintiffs’ position that Parent was also liable as a joint employer with\nregard to some or all of their claims. The record does not show the trial court refused to\ncertify claims alleged against Parent because the court concluded such claims could not\nbe proved or disproved through common facts and law. Indeed, if proven to be a joint\nemployer, for example, Parent would have had a duty to ensure that all his employees\nwere being paid properly and provided required rest and meal periods and, like Koji’s, he\nwould be liable to the class for wage and hour violations. (See Benton v. Telecom\nNetwork Specialists, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 701, 730-731.)\n              In their appellate brief, defendants argue: “In this case, the totality of the\nrecord demonstrates the lower court did not abuse its discretion. The various minute\norders . . . the transcript of the February 22, 2013 [hearing] . . . , the references by the\nlower court to the Defendant’s authority in both the objection and the demurrers, all point\nto the Court denying the Appellants’ motion for certification on the basis that it failed to\nprove a community of interest as to the issue of Mr. Parent as ‘joint employer.’ Thus,\nAppellants’ claim that the lower court committed reversible error because the lower court\n\n                                               14\n\fdid not prove a particularized analysis of its ruling is both factually and legally\nincorrect.”\n              We have reviewed the portions of the record cited by defendants and do not\nagree that they show the trial court’s reason for denying class certification of claims\nagainst Parent included a determination that plaintiffs failed to prove a community of\ninterest as to the issue of Parent’s liability as plaintiffs’ joint employer. The trial court\nstated its reason for its ruling on the motion for class certification in its February 22, 2013\nminute order quoted ante—and then reaffirmed that reasoning a few weeks later in its\nMay 6, 2013 order. The court’s stated reasons did not include any reference to any\nfailure by plaintiffs to prove a community of interest. To the contrary, the court’s stated\nreason for partially denying the motion for class certification was because the putative\nclass members’ declarations uniformly identified Koji’s as their employer. The appellate\nrecord, including the transcript of the February 22, 2013 hearing, does not show the trial\ncourt’s ruling was based on any other reason. In fact, the court granted class certification\nof claims as alleged against Koji’s, thereby impliedly finding the existence of both an\nascertainable class and a well-defined community of interest among class members. We\nmay only review the trial court’s expressed reasons for partially denying the motion;\nbecause that reasoning was erroneous, we must grant the petition.\n              We therefore grant the petition for a writ of mandate as to this issue and\ndirect the court to vacate its order partially denying the motion for class certification as to\nParent.\n                                    II.\n  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING PLAINTIFFS’ REVISED MOTION TO COMPEL\n  FURTHER RESPONSES ON THE GROUND PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER\nMEET AND CONFER EFFORTS AND ALSO BY SANCTIONING PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL FOR THE\n                              SAME REASON.\n              Plaintiffs argue the trial court “abused its discretion in denying a motion to\ncompel for failure to meet and confer, after a different judge of the court ordered that no\n\n\n                                               15\n\fadditional meet and confer was required.” (Boldface and capitalization omitted.) We\nagree the trial court erred by denying the revised motion to compel and by sanctioning\ncounsel.\n              At a status conference in May 2013, the trial court stayed discovery relating\nto the class action claims, but permitted discovery on the discrete issue of alter ego\nliability. In October 2013, plaintiffs filed a motion for an order “compelling complete,\nun-redacted, and un-excerpted responses” to several requests in plaintiffs’ third set of\nrequests for production of documents. Plaintiffs also sought sanctions against defendants\nand their counsel. The motion was accompanied by plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration\nsummarizing, inter alia, meet and confer efforts leading up to defendants’ counsel’s\nagreement to produce supplemental responses relating to plaintiffs’ alter ego claims.\nWhen those supplemental responses were received by counsel, they were found to be\nincomplete notwithstanding the parties’ “extensive meet and confer efforts.”\n              At the hearing on the motion to compel in December 2013, the trial court\ndirected the parties’ counsel to the court’s tentative decision to deny the motion and the\nrequest for sanctions. That tentative order stated: “The Separate Statement is incomplete\nas it does not set forth a statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further\nresponses and production as to each request. [¶] No meet and confer process took place\nafter the supplemental responses and documents were provided. The process was\ntherefore, incomplete and not ripe for this Motion. For this reason sanctions are denied to\nDefendant. As to Plaintiffs, sanctions are also denied due to lack of any statement in the\nNotice of Motion.”\n              In response to the tentative decision, plaintiffs’ counsel stated: “Your\nhonor, as the motion described, . . . we had 16 back-and-forth communications between\nJune and October about the discovery requests, concluding with one in which we said:\nWell, our understanding is you are going to send us stuff by October 10th, and that you\nhave given us until October 31st to have filed our motion, if we still think it’s incomplete.\n\n                                             16\n\fAnd that’s how we proceeded after that. [¶] And I understood the court’s tentative to be\nsaying that we should have met and conferred further after receiving their supplemental\nresponse. And as such, that the motion was unripe.”\n                The trial court responded, “Well, that’s true as to the sanctions part. But\nthe court was unable to address the motion due to the separate statement. So with a\nproper separate statement, the court could have evaluated what exactly was going on. I\njust wasn’t able to—so that sort of spilled over into the sanctions area.”\n                Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged that in their separate statement, they had\n“sort of consolidated the arguments into conceptual—here’s the first type of thing we are\narguing about; here is the second type of thing,” instead of reiterating the factual and\nlegal basis for the motion to compel separately after each request. The court responded,\n“Right. The conceptual approach just isn’t going to work. Even though there’s\nredundancies involved, we need to have it done separately because the court would be\nruling on each and every individual component of the discovery request. So I will add\nthe phrase ‘without prejudice’ to the ruling since, obviously, a different separate\nstatement might produce a different result.”\n                Plaintiffs’ counsel asked, “would your honor anticipate that there would be\nfurther meeting and conferring at this point that would be required? I do want to add that\nsince the tentative . . . we sent communication to opposing counsel indicating . . . we are\nwilling to meet and confer further if you have an intention of producing more to respond\nto the concerns we have raised. And the response was that there is—‘there’s no curing\nyour failure to follow procedure. You will not get a second bite at the apple. [¶] So I\nwanted to be clear whether or not we need to continue that process. It does not seen to be\nvery fruitful. Or, if we can resubmit with a correct separate statement?”\n                The court asked defendants’ counsel, “are you of the opinion that the meet-\nand-confer process has reached its final process, and there is nothing to be disclosed in\nthat regard?”\n\n                                               17\n\f               Defendants’ counsel responded: “The way the request was structured, yes,\nwe have produced everything responsive to the requests as they were drawn up.” The\ncourt and counsel engaged in the following colloquy:\n               “The Court: All right. I really can’t comment on the quality of the meet-\nand-confer process. It’s important—I don’t think the meet-and-confer process is going to\nprevent the matter from being heard; it just affects the sanctions part.\n               “So I really can’t give you any more advice than that. I’m not going to\nrequire you to further meet and confer, let’s put it that way, if somebody wants to bring a\nmotion.\n               “Yes, I do have an order in chambers, so I’ll go ahead and sign and file that\ntoday. Plaintiff to give notice. Anything else?\n               “[Defendants’ counsel]: No, I think we are done, your honor. Thank you.\n               “[Plaintiffs’ counsel]: No, your honor. I guess, just to be clear, it will say\nit’s without prejudice to refile it.\n               “The Court: That is correct. It will say ‘without prejudice.’”\n               It appears the trial court signed its tentative order without adding the court’s\ncomments that no further meet and confer efforts would be required or the court’s ruling\nthat the denial of the motion was “without prejudice.” The same day as that hearing,\nplaintiffs filed a revised motion to compel which was accompanied by a separate\nstatement that included a statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further\nresponses required by rule 3.1345(c)(3) of the California Rules of Court as to each\nrequest for which plaintiffs sought further responses. Plaintiffs also submitted a\ntranscript of the December 6, 2013 hearing in support of the reply brief supporting their\nmotion.\n               Before the hearing on the revised motion, the case was assigned to a new\ntrial judge. In a January 31, 2014 minute order, the court denied the revised motion and\nawarded defendants $960 in sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel “for bringing this\n\n                                              18\n\fMotion which again fails to meet the requirements of the Discovery Act and this Court’s\nprior Order.” The minute order further stated, “Court finds that on December 6, 2013 this\nCourt denied the prior Motion to Compel based on the fact that Plaintiffs and their\ncounsel failed to provide a complete and proper Separate Statement in support of that\nMotion and failed to meet and confer with regard to the Supplemental Responses\nreceived with regard to the subject discovery. [¶] This second Motion contains no\nevidence that such meet and confer process has taken place. It therefore must be denied\nagain. In fact, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this Motion the very same day the Court made its\nprior ruling, December 6, 2013, showing a complete disregard for this Court’s prior\nOrder. [¶] This is not a motion for compliance under CCP Section 2031.320, as it\ncontinues to argue regarding the responses themselves and the objections. The objections\nare sustained, as no valid motion has been made challenging them. And, Defendant has\nnot failed to comply with his Responses.”\n              Apparently, the trial court was unaware of the prior trial judge’s statements\nto counsel at the hearing on the original motion to compel in December 2013 that no\nfurther meet and confer efforts would be required to support a revised motion to compel\nand solely relied on the trial court’s minute order that failed to reflect those statements\n(although a transcript of that hearing was submitted to the court along with plaintiffs’\nreply brief filed in support of the revised motion to compel). Therefore, the trial court’s\nruling denying the revised motion and sanctioning plaintiffs’ counsel on the ground\nplaintiffs failed to show further meet and confer efforts was in error.\n              In their brief on appeal, defendants do not address the trial court’s stated\nreason for denying the revised motion to compel and for sanctioning plaintiffs’ counsel.\nInstead, they argue “there was another reason for the denial of the discovery motion:\nAppellants attempted to file the motion after the statutory 45 day time limit permitted to\nfile such motion” set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c).\nIn other words, defendants argue that once plaintiffs’ original motion to compel was\n\n                                              19\n\fdenied on the procedural ground that the separate statement did not place the factual and\nlegal analyses supporting further responses after each individual response, plaintiffs were\nprecluded from compelling further responses. Defendants reason that even if plaintiffs\nfiled a revised motion the same day as the hearing on the original motion, as plaintiffs did\nhere, such a revised motion was filed more than 45 days after plaintiffs received\ndefendants’ supplemental responses the previous October.\n              The appellate record does not show the original trial judge intended such a\nresult, as the court denied the original motion to compel without prejudice for refiling and\nwith the assurance that no further meet and confer efforts would be necessary.\nFurthermore, the trial judge who denied the revised motion did so on the ground there\nwere no further meet and confer efforts, and not on the ground such a motion was time-\nbarred.\n              We construe plaintiffs’ revised motion to compel to constitute the same\nmotion as their original motion to compel and conclude it is not time-barred under section\n2031.310, subdivision (c) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs suffered prejudice as\na result of the court’s order denying the revised motion to compel not only because their\ncounsel was sanctioned but also because the order deprived them of a ruling on the merits\nas to their revised motion seeking further discovery on the alter ego issue—an issue at the\nheart of plaintiffs’ case. We direct the court to vacate its order denying the revised\nmotion to compel and sanctioning plaintiffs’ counsel.\n                                     III.\n    THE TRIAL COURT’S ALTER EGO FINDINGS MUST BE VACATED IN LIGHT OF OUR\n         RULING ON THE REVISED MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES.\n              Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by concluding after the bench trial that\nParent and America’s Printer were not alter egos of Koji’s. We do not reach the merits of\nplaintiffs’ argument regarding alter ego liability in light of our reversal of the trial court’s\norder denying the revised motion to compel further responses to plaintiffs’ request for the\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\fproduction of documents. That set of document requests was focused on the alter ego\nissue and we do not know whether additional information on that issue might be\nproduced after the revised motion to compel is reconsidered on remand. We therefore\ndirect the trial court on remand to vacate its alter ego findings.\n              Plaintiffs argue on appeal that, aside from the discovery issue, the trial\ncourt applied the wrong legal standard for resolving the alter ego issues at trial. Our\nreview of the appellate record reveals the trial court’s misunderstanding of the applicable\nlaw on alter ego.\n              “Ordinarily, a corporation is regarded as a legal entity, separate and distinct\nfrom its stockholders, officers and directors, with separate and distinct liabilities and\nobligations. [Citations.] A corporate identity may be disregarded—the ‘corporate veil’\npierced—where an abuse of the corporate privilege justifies holding the equitable\nownership of a corporation liable for the actions of the corporation. [Citation.] Under\nthe alter ego doctrine, then, when the corporate form is used to perpetrate a fraud,\ncircumvent a statute, or accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose, the\ncourts will ignore the corporate entity and deem the corporation’s acts to be those of the\npersons or organizations actually controlling the corporation, in most instances the\nequitable owners. [Citations.]” (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83\nCal.App.4th 523, 538 (Sonora), italics added.)\n              Two requirements must be met to invoke the alter ego doctrine:\n(1) “[T]here must be such a unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and\nits equitable owner that the separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder\ndo not in reality exist”; and (2) “there must be an inequitable result if the acts in question\nare treated as those of the corporation alone.” (Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 538,\n                  6\nitalics added.)\n6\n Among the factors to be considered in applying the alter ego doctrine are\n(1) commingling of funds and other assets, (2) the holding out by one entity that it is\n\n                                              21\n\f              In its statement of decision, the trial court found plaintiffs failed to prove\nthe second requirement: “[P]laintiffs must establish that failure to disregard the corporate\nentity would sanction a fraud or promote injustice. It is this aspect of the alter ego\ndoctrine that plaintiff has failed to prove both as regards Mr. Parent and A.J. Parent\nCompany, Inc.” Later in its statement of decision, the court stated, “Koji’s was a real\nbusiness with real purpose and assets and not a sham corporate entity formed for the\npurpose of committing a fraud or other misdeeds.” (Italics added.) The trial court’s\nstatements suggest a misunderstanding of the applicable law. Therefore, on remand at\nthe retrial, we direct the court to make findings on alter ego liability according to the\nrequirements set forth in Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at page 538, as quoted ante.\n              At oral argument on appeal, plaintiffs argued that retrial was unnecessary\nbecause they proved Parent’s and America’s Printer’s alter ego liability as a matter of\nlaw. We decline plaintiffs’ invitation to conclude Parent and/or America’s Printer were\nKoji’s alter egos as a matter of law. To do so would require our assessing credibility and\nweighing the extensive and conflicting testimony and documentary evidence presented at\ntrial regarding the factors set forth above, instead of reviewing this issue through the lens\nof the applicable standard of review. (See Baize v. Eastridge Companies LLC (2006) 142\nCal.App.4th 293, 302 [a trial court’s alter ego findings are reviewed for substantial\nevidence].)\n\n\n\n\nliable for the debts of the other, (3) identical equitable ownership in the two entities,\n(4) use of the same offices and employees, (5) use of one entity as a mere shell or conduit\nfor the affairs of the other, (6) inadequate capitalization, (7) disregard of corporate\nformalities, (8) lack of segregation of corporate records, and (9) identical directors and\nofficers. (Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at pp. 538-539.) “No one characteristic\ngoverns, but the courts must look at all the circumstances to determine whether the\ndoctrine should be applied.” (Id. at p. 539.)\n\n                                              22\n\f                                    IV.\n    THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING PARENT WAS NOT LIABLE AS A JOINT\n           EMPLOYER WITH RESPECT TO PLAINTIFFS’ STATE LAW CLAIMS\n              Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by concluding Parent was not liable as a\njoint employer with respect to plaintiffs’ state law claims. For the reasons we will\nexplain, we agree the trial court erred and direct the court to vacate its findings with\nregard to Parent’s joint employer liability on plaintiffs’ state law claims.\n                                            A.\n               Definition of Employer in IWC Wage Order No. 5-2001 and\n                              Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th 35.\n              IWC wage order No. 5-2001, which applies to the restaurant industry and\nthus to plaintiffs as former employees in that industry, defines “Employer” as any person\n“who directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, employs or exercises\ncontrol over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any person.” (Cal. Code Regs.,\ntit. 8, § 11050, subd. 2(H).) That wage order further states the term “employ” means “to\nengage, suffer, or permit to work.” (Id., § 11050, subd. 2(E).)\n              In Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at page 64, the California Supreme Court\nheld that the definition of employer contained in IWC wage orders applies to actions\nseeking recovery of unpaid minimum wages under section 1194. After analyzing the\nhistory of the wage orders and their language, and applying the rules of statutory\ninterpretation, the Supreme Court articulated the following definition to determine who\nmight have liability as an employer for unpaid minimum wages under the Labor Code:\n“To employ, then, under the IWC’s definition, has three alternative definitions. It means:\n(a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions, or (b) to suffer or\npermit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a common law employment\nrelationship.” (Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 64.)\n              The Supreme Court stated the alternative definitions of employer are\nsufficiently broad to encompass a proprietor who employs a worker by contract, permits\n\n\n                                              23\n\fwork by acquiescence, or suffers work to be performed by a failure to hinder. (Martinez,\nsupra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 69.) Furthermore, “[a] proprietor who knows that persons are\nworking in his or her business without having been formally hired, or while being paid\nless than the minimum wage, clearly suffers or permits that work by failing to prevent it,\nwhile having the power to do so.” (Ibid.)\n              Plaintiffs’ first, fourth, fifth, and seventh causes of action involve alleged\nviolations of the IWC wage order No. 5-2001 and section 1194, to which, under\nMartinez, the three alternative definitions of “employer” discussed ante would apply.\n                                          B.\n The Statement of Decision Explains the Trial Court’s Reasoning in Finding Parent Not\n        Liable as a Joint Employer with Regard to Plaintiffs’ State Law Claims.\n              In the statement of decision, the trial court concluded Parent was not liable\nas a joint employer under any of plaintiffs’ claims brought pursuant to state law, but was\nliable as a joint employer under the FLSA. The court reasoned as follows:\n              “Here, plaintiffs contend that since Mr. Parent was sole shareholder, a\ndirector of Koji’s, and president he exercised significant control over plaintiffs. Indeed,\nplaintiffs argue that since Mr. Parent hired and fired non-exempt managers of Koji’s,\ninstructed his managers to ‘get rid of’ Quiles when she filed this action and she was\nthereafter fired, and ultimately laid off all employees when the restaurants closed, he\nexercised actual control over the employees of Koji’s.\n              “Plaintiffs assert that the Court in Martinez held that under California law,\nin wage and hour actions, the Industrial Wage Commission’s definition of employer\napplies. That definition provides that any person is an employer who is authorized to:\n              “1. suffer or permit another to work;\n              “2. control wages, hours and working conditions; or\n              “3. engage employees.\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f              “Plaintiffs argue that since Mr. Parent had all of these attributes, he should\nbe considered a joint employer with plaintiffs’ direct employer, Koji’s.\n              “The problem with plaintiffs’ theory in this regard is similar to the problem\nwith their alter ego theory. If Mr. Parent is an ‘employer’ by virtue of his control as sole\nshareholder and president of Koji’s, then all owners of all closely held corporations\nwould suffer the same fate. They all have ultimate control of the corporation, whether\nthey delegate that control to managers o[r] not. It would mean that in every wage and\nhour case against a closely held corporation, the individual shareholder(s) would be liable\nas a joint employer. In this set of cases, limited liability would become the rule, not the\nexception.\n              “While Martinez did hold that IWC’s definition applies to wage and hour\ncases brought under the Labor Code, the facts of that case were different than the facts of\nthis case. In Martinez, plaintiffs were not seeking to inculpate corporate officers, board\nmembers or shareholders. Rather, plaintiffs sought to invoke the joint employer doctrine\nagainst separate companies, merchants who purchased produce from plaintiffs’ direct\nemployer. Parenthetically, the Court in Martinez affirmed the granting of summary\njudgment in defendants’ favor, finding that even under the IWC’s broad definition of\nemployer, defendants were not liable.\n              “More appropriate authority controlling our case is found in Reynolds v.\n[Bement] (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1075, a case cited with approval in Martinez. In that case\nPlaintiffs sought to enforce labor code violations against officers, shareholders, directors\nand managers of a closely held corporation. On demurrer, the Court in Reynolds held\nthat ‘under the common law corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency are\nnot personally liable for the corporate employer’s failure to pay its employees . . . Had\nthe legislature meant in section 1194 to expose to personal civil liability any corporate\nagent who “exercises control” over an employee’s wages, hours, or working conditions, it\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fwould have manifested its intent more clearly than by mere silence after the IWC’s\npromulgation of Wage Order No. 9.’ [Citations.]\n              “For these reasons, the court finds that Mr. Parent was not an employer\nunder California state law.”\n                                         C.\n The Trial Court’s Determination that Parent Was Not Liable as a Joint Employer with\n  Regard to Plaintiffs’ State Law Claims Was Based on a Misapplication of the Law.\n              Although the trial court correctly identified the Supreme Court’s decision in\nMartinez as controlling authority, it appears from the court’s comments in its statement of\ndecision that the court concluded Martinez is factually distinguishable from the instant\ncase and therefore its three alternative definitions of employer are inapplicable here. The\ncourt ultimately concluded the determination of the definition of the term employer set\nforth in Reynolds v. Bement (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1075 (Reynolds) is more apt; applying that\ndefinition, the court determined Parent was not liable as a joint employer on plaintiffs’\nstate law claims.\n              In Martinez, the Supreme Court analyzed and significantly limited its\nholding in Reynolds: “Against this background we consider the significance of Reynolds,\nsupra, 36 Cal.4th 1075, and whether that decision governs this case. In Reynolds we\nlooked to the common law rather than the applicable wage order to define employment in\nan action under section 1194 seeking to hold a corporation’s directors and officers\npersonally liable for its employees’ unpaid overtime compensation. [Citation.] We\nconclude Reynolds does not govern this case. Wage Order No. 14, and not the common\nlaw, properly defines the employment relationship in this action under section 1194.”\n(Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 62.)\n              In Reynolds, supra, 36 Cal.4th at page 1082, the plaintiff worked for a\ncorporation that owned and operated automobile painting shops. The plaintiff sued to\nrecover unpaid overtime compensation under section 1194 and the IWC’s applicable\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fwage order. (Reynolds, supra, at p. 1083.) The plaintiff sued, inter alia, eight of his\nemployer’s officers and directors in their individual capacities. (Id. at pp. 1082-1083.)\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the order sustaining a demurrer to the claims against the\nofficers and directors on the ground plaintiff failed to state a cause of action against them.\n(Id. at pp. 1083, 1087-1088.)\n              The Supreme Court in Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pages 62 to 63,\nacknowledged that in Reynolds, it had held that the common law rather than the\napplicable wage order defined the employment relationship for purposes of a claim under\nsection 1194—a holding the court expressly disavowed in Martinez. The Martinez court\nstated: “Were we to define employment exclusively according to the common law in\ncivil actions for unpaid wages we would render the commission’s definitions effectively\nmeaningless.” (Martinez, supra, at p. 65.)\n              The Martinez court, however, added: “This is not to say the common law\nplays no role in the IWC’s definition of the employment relationship. In fact, the IWC’s\ndefinition of employment incorporates the common law definition as one alternative. As\ndefined in the wage orders, ‘“[e]mployer” means any person . . . who . . . employs or\nexercises control over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any person,’ and\n‘“[e]mploy” means to engage, suffer, or permit to work.’ [Citation.] The verbs “to\nsuffer” and “to permit,” as we have seen, are terms of art in employment law. . . . In\ncontrast, the verb ‘to engage’ has no other apparent meaning in the present context than\nits plain, ordinary sense of ‘to employ,’ that is, to create a common law employment\nrelationship. This conclusion makes sense because the IWC, even while extending its\nregulatory protection to workers whose employment status the common law did not\nrecognize, could not have intended to withhold protection from the regularly hired\nemployees who undoubtedly comprise the vast majority of the state’s workforce. To\nemploy, then, under the IWC’s definition, has three alternative definitions. It means: (a)\nto exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions, or (b) to suffer or permit\n\n                                             27\n\fto work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a common law employment relationship.”\n(Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 64, fn. omitted.)\n              The Supreme Court in Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at page 66, concluded:\n“In sum, we hold that the applicable wage order’s definitions of the employment\nrelationship do apply in actions under section 1194. The opinion in Reynolds, supra, 36\nCal.4th 1075, properly holds that the IWC’s definition of ‘employer’ does not impose\nliability on individual corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency.\n[Citation.] The opinion should not be read more broadly than that.”\n              Here, in its statement of decision, the trial court expressed concern that if\nParent were held liable by virtue of his control as sole shareholder and president of\nKoji’s, then all owners of all closely held corporations would suffer the same fate. But\nParent’s status as sole shareholder and president of Koji’s cannot insulate him, or any\nother sole owner of a closely held corporation, from liability as a joint employer if his\nactions meet any one of the three definitions set forth in Martinez. (See Castaneda v.\nEnsign Group, Inc. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1015, 1017-1018 [“A corporation with no\nemployees owns a corporation with employees. If the corporation with no employees\nexercises some control over the corporation with employees, it also may be the employer\nof the employees of the corporation it owns”]; Guerrero v. Superior Court (2013) 213\nCal.App.4th 912, 950 [an entity that controls the business enterprise may be an employer\neven if it did not “directly hire, fire or supervise” the employees].)\n              Parent was not a remote sole shareholder and president who was never\ninvolved in Koji’s operations. In the statement of decision, in support of its finding that\nplaintiffs had proven the first prong of the alter ego doctrine and thereby showed Parent\n“dominated or controlled” Koji’s, the trial court noted Parent was the “big boss” to Koji’s\nemployees and “had the ability to control [Koji’s and America’s Printer], whether he\nchose to delegate that responsibility to managers or not.” The court acknowledged\nplaintiffs’ contentions that “since Mr. Parent hired and fired non-exempt managers of\n\n                                              28\n\fKoji’s, instructed his managers to ‘get rid of’ Quiles when she filed this action and she\nwas thereafter fired, and ultimately laid off all employees when the restaurants closed, he\nexercised actual control over the employees of Koji’s.”\n              The trial court did not suggest it disbelieved the evidence of Parent’s\ninvolvement in Koji’s beyond that of remote sole shareholder and president.\nNevertheless it failed to apply the Martinez three-part definition of “employer” to\ndetermine whether such evidence proved joint employer liability. Instead, solely relying\non Reynolds, supra, 36 Cal.4th 1075, the court concluded Parent was immune from such\nliability notwithstanding such activity, because he was simply a corporate agent acting\nwithin the scope of his agency. If that were the rule, no sole shareholder and officer of a\nclosely-held corporation would ever be liable as a joint employer for wage violations,\neven if he or she suffered or permitted another to work, controlled wages, hours and\nworking conditions, or engaged employees.\n              The trial court found Parent had joint employer liability as to plaintiffs’\nfederal claims under the FLSA: “The definition of employer is broader under federal\nlabor law than under California law. Indeed, under the FLSA it has been held that under\ncertain circumstances a shareholder/officer of a closely held corporation can be liable for\nviolations along with the corporate employer. [Citation.] Under the FLSA, an employer\nincludes ‘any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation\n                    7\nto an employee.’”\n              The determination of liability for violations of the FLSA for failure to pay\nwages depends on whether there is an employer-employee relationship under the so-\ncalled “‘economic reality test.’” (Futrell v. Payday California, Inc. (2010) 190\n\n\n7\n  See Guerrero v. Superior Court, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 945 (“Martinez rejected\nthe defendants’ contention that the narrower federal standard governed the definition of\nemployer”). But see Bonnette v. California Health & Welfare Agency (9th Cir. 1983)\n704 F.2d 1465, 1470 (referring to “the FLSA’s liberal definition of ‘employer’”).\n\n                                             29\n\fCal.App.4th 1419, 1435.) The FLSA’s test, though distinct from the IWC’s wage orders’\ndefinition of the term ‘“employ”’ (Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 59-60), ordinarily\ninvolves the consideration of similar factors (Futrell v. Payday, Inc., supra, p. 1435). In\napplying the FLSA’s test, courts “evaluate ‘“the economic realit[y] of the work\nrelationship”’ . . . ‘“whether the alleged employer (1) had the power to hire and fire the\nemployees, (2) supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of\nemployment, (3) determined the rate and method of payment, and (4) maintained\nemployment records.”’” (Guerrero v. Superior Court, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at pp.\n928-929.) Our concern that the trial court misapplied state law in determining Parent’s\njoint employer liability deepens given the similar factors applicable to determining\nfederal joint employer liability, notwithstanding the separate definitions of the term\nemployer under state and federal law.\n              We therefore direct the trial court to vacate its finding that Parent was not\nliable as a joint employer with regard to plaintiffs’ claims involving violations of section\n1194 and IWC wage order No. 5-2001, and, on retrial, reconsider this issue by applying\neach of the three alternative definitions set forth in Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pages\n59 to 60, to the evidence presented in this case.\n                                           D.\n     The Statement of Decision Does Not Address the Legal Standard Applicable to\nDetermining Joint Employer Liability as to Plaintiffs’ Sixth, Ninth, and Twelfth Causes of\n                                        Action.\n              Although raised by plaintiffs in their objections to the proposed statement\nof decision, plaintiffs argue and we agree the statement of decision fails to address the\nlegal standard applicable to joint employer liability for plaintiffs’ claims not involving an\nalleged violation of section 1194 and/or IWC wage order No. 5-2001, namely plaintiffs’\nsixth, ninth, and twelfth causes of action. We therefore direct the court on remand to\naddress the applicable legal standards for joint employer liability with regard to these\nclaims.\n\n                                             30\n\f                   The sixth cause of action alleges defendants violated section 351, which\nprohibits an employer or agent from collecting, taking, or receiving a gratuity left for an\nemployee by a patron, and based on that statutory violation, also alleges a violation of the\nunfair competition law. Section 350, subdivision (a) provides its own definition of the\nterm employer: “[E]very person engaged in any business or enterprise in this state that\nhas one or more persons in service under any appointment, contract of hire, or\napprenticeship, express or implied, oral or written, irrespective of whether the person is\nthe owner of the business or is operating on a concessionaire or other basis.”\n                   The ninth cause of action alleges a separate violation of the unfair\ncompetition law, which provides that “an owner or officer of a corporation may be\nindividually liable under the [UCL] if he or she actively and directly participates in the\nunfair business practice.” (Bradstreet v. Wong (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1458.)\n                   The twelfth cause of action is brought pursuant to PAGA which plaintiff\nargues authorizes recovery of penalties under section 558, subdivision (a), which\nprovides: “Any employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer who violates,\nor causes to be violated, a section of this chapter or any provision regulating hours and\ndays of work in any order of the Industrial Welfare Commission shall be subject to a civil\npenalty . . . .”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f                                       DISPOSITION\n              The petition for a writ of mandate is granted. Let a writ of mandate issue\ndirecting the trial court to vacate its orders (1) granting plaintiffs’ motion for class\ncertification as to Koji’s only, (2) denying plaintiffs’ revised motion to compel further\ndiscovery responses, (3) issuing sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel in connection with\nthe filing of plaintiffs’ revised motion to compel further discovery responses, (4)\nconcluding neither Parent nor America’s Printer were alter egos of Koji’s, and (5)\nconcluding Parent cannot be held liable as a joint employer with regard to plaintiffs’ state\nlaw claims.

We grant writ\nrelief with regard to each challenged ruling and hold:\n               1. The trial court erred by granting the motion to certify a class as to\nplaintiffs’ claims against only Koji’s because the court applied improper criteria in\ndetermining Parent’s potential liability as a joint employer on a class-wide basis.\n               2. The trial court prejudicially erred by denying plaintiffs’ revised motion\nto compel further responses to a set of document requests, and also by sanctioning\nplaintiffs’ counsel.\n               3. Because, as set forth in the disposition, we direct the trial court to vacate\nits order denying the revised motion to compel further responses to discovery on alter ego\nissues, we direct the court to also vacate its findings that Parent and America’s Printer\nwere not Koji’s alter egos. Even if we did not direct the trial court to vacate its alter ego\nfindings because of the court’s error in denying the revised motion compel, we would\nnevertheless order the court to vacate those findings because the court applied incorrect\nlegal standards for alter ego liability.\n               4.

In addition, the trial court failed to address whether Parent might be a joint\nemployer under the definitions of the term “employer” applicable to plaintiffs’ claims\nunder the unfair competition law, the tip misappropriation statute, and PAGA.\n\n                                               3\n\f                                      BACKGROUND\n               In 2000, Koji’s was incorporated by Parent and, at all times relevant to this\ncase, Parent has been Koji’s president, sole shareholder, and director. Koji’s owned one\nsushi and shabu-shabu restaurant in Hollywood, and another such restaurant in Orange\nCounty. Each individually named plaintiff was employed by Koji’s and worked at one or\nboth of its restaurants at some point during November 2006 through February 2012.\nKoji’s was not a profitable business and, by early 2012, had closed both restaurants.\n                                              I.\n    PLAINTIFFS INITIATE THIS ACTION; PLAINTIFFS FILE THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT.\n               In November 2010, Amanda Quiles, Heather Turman, and Kimberly Dang\n(plaintiffs), as individuals and “on behalf of all others similarly situated, and on behalf of\nthe general public,” filed a proposed class action against, inter alia, Koji’s and Parent,\nasserting several state and federal wage and hour claims, and violation of California’s\nunfair competition law. (Quiles v. Koji’s Japan (Apr. 3, 2015, G049238) [nonpub.\nopn.].)\n               In December 2012, plaintiffs filed their “third amended class and collective\naction complaint for damages, restitution and injunctive relief” against Koji’s and Parent,\n                              2\nand added America’s Printer as a defendant. The third amended complaint contained\nclaims for (1) failure to pay overtime wages in violation of sections 510, 1194, and 1198,\nand IWC wage order No. 5-2001 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 11050) (IWC wage order No.\n5-2001) (first cause of action); (2) failure to pay earned wages upon discharge and\nwaiting time penalties in violation of sections 201 through 203 (second cause of action);\n(3) failure to provide timely, accurate, and itemized wage statements in violation of\nsection 226 (third cause of action); (4) failure to provide rest breaks and meal periods in\n\n2\n America’s Printer was incorporated by Parent in 1998 and is in the business of providing\nprinting services. As is the case with Koji’s, Parent is America’s Printer’s sole\nshareholder, president, and director.\n\n                                              4\n\fviolation of IWC wage order No. 5-2001, and sections 226.7 and 512 (fourth cause of\naction); (5) failure to compensate for all hours worked in violation of sections 221 and\n223 and IWC wage order No. 5-2001 (fifth cause of action); (6) misappropriation of tips\nby the employer and the employer’s agents in violation of section 351 and Business and\nProfessions Code section 17200 (sixth cause of action); (7) failure to pay the minimum\nwage in violation of sections 1182.11, 1182.12, 1182.13, 1194, and 1997, and “the\nCalifornia Minimum Wage Order, MW-2001” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 11000) (seventh\ncause of action); (8) violation of the FLSA (29 U.S.C. §§ 206, 207, 216) (eighth cause of\naction); (9) violation of the unfair competition law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200) (ninth\ncause of action); and (10) recovery of civil penalties pursuant to PAGA (twelfth cause of\n           3\naction).\n               The third amended complaint alleged Parent was a joint employer of\nplaintiffs and putative class members, and alleged Parent’s involvement in Koji’s\noperations as its president and sole shareholder by which Parent directly or indirectly\nemployed or exercised control over wages, hours, and working conditions and “suffered\nand/or permitted” employment. The third amended complaint also alleged facts\nsupporting its assertion Parent and America’s Printer were alter egos of Koji’s.\n                                     II.\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRANTS PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION ONLY AS TO\n             KOJI’S BUT NOT AS TO PARENT OR AMERICA’S PRINTER.\n               In January 2013, plaintiffs filed an amended notice of motion for class\ncertification seeking an order that the case proceed as a class action under section 382 of\nthe Code of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs sought certification of the following class: “All\n\n3\n  The third amended complaint also contained as the tenth and eleventh causes of action\nindividual claims for retaliation for engaging in protected activity in violation of section\n98.6 and in violation of the FLSA (29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3)), and for retaliation for filing a\nFLSA complaint. Those two causes of action were solely applicable to plaintiff Quiles,\nwere separately adjudicated, and are not at issue in this case. During the pendency of this\nappeal, Quiles was dismissed as an appellant.\n\n                                             5\n\fpersons who were employed by Defendants as servers, hosts/hostesses, floor managers,\nsushi chefs, assistant general managers, bussers, dishwashers, bartenders, kitchen helpers,\nand ‘barbacks,’ at any time from November 16, 2006, to the date of the final disposition\nof this case.” Plaintiff also sought certification of a tip misappropriation subclass: “All\npersons who were employed by Defendants as servers, hosts/hostesses, floor managers,\nassistant general managers, bussers, dishwashers, bartenders, and ‘barbacks,’ at any time\nfrom November 16, 2006, through the date of the final disposition of this action.”\n              In February 2013, the trial court certified the class as to “Koji’s . . . only as\nemployer of the class and only as to those causes of action derivative of the alleged meal\nand rest violations,” namely the first through fifth, ninth, and twelfth causes of action. A\nclass was not certified as to the seventh or eighth causes of action for violation of the\nwage order setting the minimum wage or for violation of the FLSA. The court also\ncertified a tip-pooling subclass defined as “[a]ll persons who were employed by\nDefendant Koji’s as servers, hosts/hostesses, bussers, bartenders, and ‘barbacks,’ at any\ntime from November 16, 2006, through the date of the final disposition in this action.”\n              The court explained its reasoning for partially denying the motion for class\ncertification in a minute order dated February 22, 2013: “The Plaintiffs have stated that\ntheir only employer was Koji’s, not Mr. Parent, and based on that and the fact that no\ncause of action is stated against Mr. Parent for joint employer liability the Motion for\nClass Certification is only granted as to Koji’s. The Motion only establishes a basis for\nclass certification concerning the issues of meal and rest breaks and tip-pooling and does\nnot address the other claims or Causes of Action asserted by the Plaintiffs and therefore\nthe Motion is only granted as to those issues, and the derivat[iv]e claims arising from\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthem. There is insufficient evidence to establish that a tip-pooling claim can be pursued\n                                                                           4\nby employees other than servers, and so, a sub-class will be certified.”\n              Following the court’s ruling on the motion for class certification, only the\nnamed plaintiffs’ individual claims against Parent (as a joint employer or alter ego of\nKoji’s) and against America’s Printer (as an alter ego of Koji’s) survived.\n                                       III.\n      THE TRIAL COURT DENIES PLAINTIFFS’ REVISED MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER\n    RESPONSES TO DOCUMENT REQUESTS AND ALSO SANCTIONS PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL.\n              The trial court stayed discovery relating to the class action claims, but\npermitted discovery on the discrete issue of alter ego liability. Plaintiffs filed a motion\nfor an order compelling further responses from Parent regarding their request for\nproduction of documents.\n              At the hearing on the motion to compel, the trial court and the parties’\ncounsel discussed the court’s tentative decision to deny the motion to compel on the\nground its supporting separate statement was incomplete. The court found the separate\nstatement procedurally defective because it set forth the factual and legal reasons for\ngranting the motion in one place instead of stating the factual and legal reasons following\neach request and response. The court also noted that no meet and confer process\nappeared to have taken place after plaintiffs received Parent’s supplemental responses\nand document production.\n              Plaintiffs’ counsel described the parties’ extensive meet and confer efforts\nleading up to the plaintiffs’ receipt of what they considered inadequate and incomplete\nresponses. Plaintiffs’ counsel also explained the short time frame between receiving\n\n\n4\n In a minute order dated May 6, 2013, the trial court made corrections to its February 22,\n2013 minute order nunc pro tunc that are not at issue in this appeal. In the May 6 minute\norder, the court confirmed that accuracy of the statement of the court’s reasoning for\npartially denying the motion for class certification set forth in the February 22 minute\norder.\n\n                                              7\n\fthose responses and the deadline to file the motion to compel. The trial court stated that\nthe motion to compel would be denied “without prejudice” because if counsel provided a\nseparate statement that reiterated the legal and factual analysis for each request, it “might\nproduce a different result.” After confirming the futility of further meet and confer\nefforts with counsel for the parties, the trial court stated it was “not going to require you\nto further meet and confer, let’s put it that way, if somebody wants to bring a motion”\nand reiterated that the order denying the motion to compel would say “without\nprejudice.”\n              Notwithstanding the trial court’s assurances, it appears the court signed its\ntentative order without stating that no further meet and confer efforts would be required\nand that the motion would be denied without prejudice. Plaintiffs revised their separate\nstatement and filed a revised motion the same day as the hearing on the original motion to\ncompel.\n              Before the hearing on the revised motion to compel, the case was assigned\nto a new trial judge. In a January 2014 minute order, the court denied the revised motion\nto compel and awarded defendants $960 in sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel “for\nbringing this Motion which again fails to meet the requirements of the Discovery Act and\nthis Court’s prior Order.” Noting that the trial court had denied the original motion to\ncompel on the ground plaintiffs and their counsel failed to provide a complete and proper\nseparate statement in support of that motion and failed to meet and confer with regard to\nthe supplemental responses, the court denied the revised motion on the ground it\n“contains no evidence that such meet and confer process has taken place. It therefore\nmust be denied again. In fact, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this Motion the very same day the\nCourt made its prior ruling, December 6, 2013, showing a complete disregard for this\nCourt’s prior Order.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f                                       IV.\n    FOLLOWING A BENCH TRIAL ON THE ISSUES OF JOINT EMPLOYER AND ALTER EGO\n LIABILITY, THE TRIAL COURT ISSUES A STATEMENT OF DECISION CONCLUDING PARENT\n IS A JOINT EMPLOYER ONLY AS TO PLAINTIFFS’ INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS UNDER THE FLSA\n   AND THAT NEITHER PARENT NOR AMERICA’S PRINTER IS AN ALTER EGO OF KOJI’S.\n\n              The parties agreed to a bench trial on the issues of whether Parent and\nAmerica’s Printer were potentially liable as alter egos of Koji’s and whether Parent was\npotentially liable as a joint employer with Koji’s. Plaintiffs’ counsel remarked, “there’s\nreally no case to pursue if there is—if it’s only the corporate entity [Koji’s]. I mean, it’s\na dead case. There’s no solvent entity.” Defendants’ counsel agreed, stating: “If Mr.\nParent is in the case, [plaintiffs’ counsel] can proceed profitably for his clients, for the\nclass members. If Mr. Parent is not in the case, it’s going to go nowhere because the\ncorporate defendant Koji’s has no assets and it’s not in business.”\n              A bench trial on the issues of alter ego and joint employer status was held\nin January and February 2015. The trial court issued a tentative ruling and plaintiffs\nrequested a statement of decision with 147 requests. Plaintiffs filed 154 objections to the\ncourt’s proposed statement of decision. In April 2015, the trial court issued its “statement\nof decision regarding the trial on issues of alter ego and joint employment.”\n              In the final statement of decision, the court noted it was not required to\nrespond point-by-point to the issues posed by plaintiffs but must disclose the court’s\ndetermination as to the ultimate facts and material issues in the case. In the statement of\ndecision, the court ruled: (1) neither Parent nor America’s Printer was liable as an alter\nego of Koji’s; (2) Parent was not liable as a joint employer as to the causes of action\nbrought under state law; and (3) Parent was a joint employer for purposes of the FLSA\ncause of action.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f          PARENT AND AMERICA’S PRINTER’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL\n                        DISMISSAL OF APPEAL\n              Parent and America’s Printer filed a motion requesting that we dismiss\nportions of this appeal they contend are not ripe. They argue the only issue that is ripe\nfor appeal is “the severable portion” of the trial court’s decision that America’s Printer is\nnot the alter ego of Koji’s, as that determination takes America’s Printer out of the case.\nThey therefore request the dismissal of plaintiffs’ appeal as to whether Parent is a joint\nemployer for purposes of state wage claims and is Koji’s alter ego, as Parent is still in the\ncase as a defendant with regard to the violation of the FLSA claim. They also request\ndismissal of the appeal as to the court’s order partially granting the motion for class\ncertification and the order denying plaintiffs’ revised motion to compel further responses\nand issuing sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel.\n              In their opposition, plaintiffs argue that the trial court’s rulings up through\nits determination that Parent was a joint employer and Parent and America’s Printer were\nnot Koji’s alter egos trigger the so-called death knell doctrine, thereby making all the\nsubject rulings appealable because the putative class members will not be able, as a\npractical matter, to pursue their claims given Koji’s insolvent status. Plaintiffs argue, in\nthe alternative, that this court may treat the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate.\n              We may treat an improper appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate in\nunusual circumstances. (Olson v. Cory (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1259865\"><a href=\"/opinion/1259865/olson-v-cory/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 400-401.) It is appropriate\nto treat an appeal from a nonappealable judgment as a petition for extraordinary writ\nwhen requiring the parties to wait for entry of final judgment might lead to unnecessary\ntrial proceedings, the briefs and the record include the necessary elements for a writ of\nmandate, there is no indication the trial court would appear as a party in the writ\nproceeding, the appealability of the order was not clear, and all parties urge the court to\ndecide the issue rather than dismiss the appeal.

The\nparties’ counsel have agreed on the record that the trial court rulings have in effect\nresulted in preventing a class action from going forward because the remaining certified\nclass claims are against a single entity (Koji’s) which is insolvent. Requiring the parties\nto wait for final judgment following litigation of the remaining issues might lead to\nunnecessary trial proceedings. Although defendants would like us to dismiss portions of\nthe appeal for lack of jurisdiction, on balance the circumstances justify treating plaintiffs’\nappeal as a petition for a writ of mandate. Therefore, we deny defendants’ motion for\npartial dismissal of this appeal.\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                       I.\n       THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY PARTIALLY GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO\n                                CERTIFY A CLASS.\n              The trial court certified a class action as to all of the claims contained in the\nthird amended complaint except plaintiffs’ claims for violation of the FLSA and violation\nof the minimum wage order and Quiles’s individual claims for wrongful termination and\nretaliation. Plaintiffs do not challenge the court’s class certification order with regard to\nthe claims that were and were not certified for class action treatment. Rather, plaintiffs\ncontend the court erred by granting their motion to certify claims against Koji’s only and\nthus not including those claims alleged against Parent on a theory of joint employer\nliability.\n                                              A.\n                 General Class Action Principles and Standard of Review\n              “Code of Civil Procedure section 382 authorizes class actions ‘when the\nquestion is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fnumerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court . . . .’ The party\nseeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable\nclass and a well-defined community of interest among class members.

(Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 326.)\nThe ultimate question in ruling on a class certification motion is whether the issues which\nmay be adjudicated as a class, when compared with the issues which must be adjudicated\nindividually, are sufficiently numerous or substantial to make a class action advantageous\nto both the litigants and the judicial process. (Ibid.)\n              Trial courts have discretion in granting or denying motions for class\ncertification because they are well situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities\nof permitting a class action. (Sav-On, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 326.) Despite this grant of\ndiscretion, appellate review of orders denying class certification differs from ordinary\nappellate review.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n939, plaintiffs contend the trial court committed reversible error by failing to state in the\norder its reasons for denying the motion for class certification against Parent. To the\ncontrary, in Knapp a panel of this court stated: “The trial court was not required to state\n\n\n5\n  Plaintiffs do not challenge the trial court’s ruling on the motion to certify a class with\nregard to claims alleged against America’s Printer.\n\n                                              13\n\fits reasons in the order denying the motion. Instead, we review the entire record to\ndetermine whether the trial court’s reasons were expressed.” (Ibid.)\n              In any event, here the trial court, in its February 22, 2013 minute order, did\nexpress its reason for declining to certify the class action claims against Parent: “The\nPlaintiffs have stated that their only employer was Koji’s, not Mr. Parent, and based on\nthat and the fact that no cause of action is stated against Mr. Parent for joint employer\nliability the Motion for Class Certification is only granted as to Koji’s.”\n              The third amended complaint asserts plaintiffs’ claims against all\ndefendants and specifically incorporates allegations that Parent was liable as a joint\nemployer into each cause of action. Although it is true the individual plaintiffs’ and\nputative class members’ declarations filed in support of the motion for class certification\neach began with a statement that each had been employed by Koji’s, that statement is not\ninconsistent with plaintiffs’ position that Parent was also liable as a joint employer with\nregard to some or all of their claims. The record does not show the trial court refused to\ncertify claims alleged against Parent because the court concluded such claims could not\nbe proved or disproved through common facts and law. Indeed, if proven to be a joint\nemployer, for example, Parent would have had a duty to ensure that all his employees\nwere being paid properly and provided required rest and meal periods and, like Koji’s, he\nwould be liable to the class for wage and hour violations. (See Benton v. Telecom\nNetwork Specialists, Inc. (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730-731.)\n              In their appellate brief, defendants argue: “In this case, the totality of the\nrecord demonstrates the lower court did not abuse its discretion. The various minute\norders . . . the transcript of the February 22, 2013 [hearing] . . . , the references by the\nlower court to the Defendant’s authority in both the objection and the demurrers, all point\nto the Court denying the Appellants’ motion for certification on the basis that it failed to\nprove a community of interest as to the issue of Mr. Parent as ‘joint employer.’ Thus,\nAppellants’ claim that the lower court committed reversible error because the lower court\n\n                                               14\n\fdid not prove a particularized analysis of its ruling is both factually and legally\nincorrect.”\n              We have reviewed the portions of the record cited by defendants and do not\nagree that they show the trial court’s reason for denying class certification of claims\nagainst Parent included a determination that plaintiffs failed to prove a community of\ninterest as to the issue of Parent’s liability as plaintiffs’ joint employer. The trial court\nstated its reason for its ruling on the motion for class certification in its February 22, 2013\nminute order quoted ante—and then reaffirmed that reasoning a few weeks later in its\nMay 6, 2013 order. The court’s stated reasons did not include any reference to any\nfailure by plaintiffs to prove a community of interest. To the contrary, the court’s stated\nreason for partially denying the motion for class certification was because the putative\nclass members’ declarations uniformly identified Koji’s as their employer. The appellate\nrecord, including the transcript of the February 22, 2013 hearing, does not show the trial\ncourt’s ruling was based on any other reason. In fact, the court granted class certification\nof claims as alleged against Koji’s, thereby impliedly finding the existence of both an\nascertainable class and a well-defined community of interest among class members. We\nmay only review the trial court’s expressed reasons for partially denying the motion;\nbecause that reasoning was erroneous, we must grant the petition.\n              We therefore grant the petition for a writ of mandate as to this issue and\ndirect the court to vacate its order partially denying the motion for class certification as to\nParent.\n                                    II.\n  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING PLAINTIFFS’ REVISED MOTION TO COMPEL\n  FURTHER RESPONSES ON THE GROUND PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER\nMEET AND CONFER EFFORTS AND ALSO BY SANCTIONING PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL FOR THE\n                              SAME REASON.\n              Plaintiffs argue the trial court “abused its discretion in denying a motion to\ncompel for failure to meet and confer, after a different judge of the court ordered that no\n\n\n                                               15\n\fadditional meet and confer was required.” (Boldface and capitalization omitted.) We\nagree the trial court erred by denying the revised motion to compel and by sanctioning\ncounsel.\n              At a status conference in May 2013, the trial court stayed discovery relating\nto the class action claims, but permitted discovery on the discrete issue of alter ego\nliability. In October 2013, plaintiffs filed a motion for an order “compelling complete,\nun-redacted, and un-excerpted responses” to several requests in plaintiffs’ third set of\nrequests for production of documents. Plaintiffs also sought sanctions against defendants\nand their counsel. The motion was accompanied by plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration\nsummarizing, inter alia, meet and confer efforts leading up to defendants’ counsel’s\nagreement to produce supplemental responses relating to plaintiffs’ alter ego claims.\nWhen those supplemental responses were received by counsel, they were found to be\nincomplete notwithstanding the parties’ “extensive meet and confer efforts.”\n              At the hearing on the motion to compel in December 2013, the trial court\ndirected the parties’ counsel to the court’s tentative decision to deny the motion and the\nrequest for sanctions. That tentative order stated: “The Separate Statement is incomplete\nas it does not set forth a statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further\nresponses and production as to each request. [¶] No meet and confer process took place\nafter the supplemental responses and documents were provided. The process was\ntherefore, incomplete and not ripe for this Motion. For this reason sanctions are denied to\nDefendant. As to Plaintiffs, sanctions are also denied due to lack of any statement in the\nNotice of Motion.”\n              In response to the tentative decision, plaintiffs’ counsel stated: “Your\nhonor, as the motion described, . . . we had 16 back-and-forth communications between\nJune and October about the discovery requests, concluding with one in which we said:\nWell, our understanding is you are going to send us stuff by October 10th, and that you\nhave given us until October 31st to have filed our motion, if we still think it’s incomplete.\n\n                                             16\n\fAnd that’s how we proceeded after that. [¶] And I understood the court’s tentative to be\nsaying that we should have met and conferred further after receiving their supplemental\nresponse. And as such, that the motion was unripe.”\n                The trial court responded, “Well, that’s true as to the sanctions part. But\nthe court was unable to address the motion due to the separate statement. So with a\nproper separate statement, the court could have evaluated what exactly was going on. I\njust wasn’t able to—so that sort of spilled over into the sanctions area.”\n                Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged that in their separate statement, they had\n“sort of consolidated the arguments into conceptual—here’s the first type of thing we are\narguing about; here is the second type of thing,” instead of reiterating the factual and\nlegal basis for the motion to compel separately after each request. The court responded,\n“Right. The conceptual approach just isn’t going to work. Even though there’s\nredundancies involved, we need to have it done separately because the court would be\nruling on each and every individual component of the discovery request. So I will add\nthe phrase ‘without prejudice’ to the ruling since, obviously, a different separate\nstatement might produce a different result.”\n                Plaintiffs’ counsel asked, “would your honor anticipate that there would be\nfurther meeting and conferring at this point that would be required? I do want to add that\nsince the tentative . . . we sent communication to opposing counsel indicating . . . we are\nwilling to meet and confer further if you have an intention of producing more to respond\nto the concerns we have raised. And the response was that there is—‘there’s no curing\nyour failure to follow procedure. You will not get a second bite at the apple. [¶] So I\nwanted to be clear whether or not we need to continue that process. It does not seen to be\nvery fruitful. Or, if we can resubmit with a correct separate statement?”\n                The court asked defendants’ counsel, “are you of the opinion that the meet-\nand-confer process has reached its final process, and there is nothing to be disclosed in\nthat regard?”\n\n                                               17\n\f               Defendants’ counsel responded: “The way the request was structured, yes,\nwe have produced everything responsive to the requests as they were drawn up.” The\ncourt and counsel engaged in the following colloquy:\n               “The Court: All right. I really can’t comment on the quality of the meet-\nand-confer process. It’s important—I don’t think the meet-and-confer process is going to\nprevent the matter from being heard; it just affects the sanctions part.\n               “So I really can’t give you any more advice than that. I’m not going to\nrequire you to further meet and confer, let’s put it that way, if somebody wants to bring a\nmotion.\n               “Yes, I do have an order in chambers, so I’ll go ahead and sign and file that\ntoday. Plaintiff to give notice. Anything else?\n               “[Defendants’ counsel]: No, I think we are done, your honor. Thank you.\n               “[Plaintiffs’ counsel]: No, your honor. I guess, just to be clear, it will say\nit’s without prejudice to refile it.\n               “The Court: That is correct. It will say ‘without prejudice.’”\n               It appears the trial court signed its tentative order without adding the court’s\ncomments that no further meet and confer efforts would be required or the court’s ruling\nthat the denial of the motion was “without prejudice.” The same day as that hearing,\nplaintiffs filed a revised motion to compel which was accompanied by a separate\nstatement that included a statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further\nresponses required by rule 3.1345(c)(3) of the California Rules of Court as to each\nrequest for which plaintiffs sought further responses. Plaintiffs also submitted a\ntranscript of the December 6, 2013 hearing in support of the reply brief supporting their\nmotion.\n               Before the hearing on the revised motion, the case was assigned to a new\ntrial judge. In a January 31, 2014 minute order, the court denied the revised motion and\nawarded defendants $960 in sanctions against plaintiffs’ counsel “for bringing this\n\n                                              18\n\fMotion which again fails to meet the requirements of the Discovery Act and this Court’s\nprior Order.” The minute order further stated, “Court finds that on December 6, 2013 this\nCourt denied the prior Motion to Compel based on the fact that Plaintiffs and their\ncounsel failed to provide a complete and proper Separate Statement in support of that\nMotion and failed to meet and confer with regard to the Supplemental Responses\nreceived with regard to the subject discovery. [¶] This second Motion contains no\nevidence that such meet and confer process has taken place. It therefore must be denied\nagain. In fact, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this Motion the very same day the Court made its\nprior ruling, December 6, 2013, showing a complete disregard for this Court’s prior\nOrder. [¶] This is not a motion for compliance under CCP Section 2031.320, as it\ncontinues to argue regarding the responses themselves and the objections. The objections\nare sustained, as no valid motion has been made challenging them. And, Defendant has\nnot failed to comply with his Responses.”\n              Apparently, the trial court was unaware of the prior trial judge’s statements\nto counsel at the hearing on the original motion to compel in December 2013 that no\nfurther meet and confer efforts would be required to support a revised motion to compel\nand solely relied on the trial court’s minute order that failed to reflect those statements\n(although a transcript of that hearing was submitted to the court along with plaintiffs’\nreply brief filed in support of the revised motion to compel). Therefore, the trial court’s\nruling denying the revised motion and sanctioning plaintiffs’ counsel on the ground\nplaintiffs failed to show further meet and confer efforts was in error.\n              In their brief on appeal, defendants do not address the trial court’s stated\nreason for denying the revised motion to compel and for sanctioning plaintiffs’ counsel.\nInstead, they argue “there was another reason for the denial of the discovery motion:\nAppellants attempted to file the motion after the statutory 45 day time limit permitted to\nfile such motion” set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c).\nIn other words, defendants argue that once plaintiffs’ original motion to compel was\n\n                                              19\n\fdenied on the procedural ground that the separate statement did not place the factual and\nlegal analyses supporting further responses after each individual response, plaintiffs were\nprecluded from compelling further responses. Defendants reason that even if plaintiffs\nfiled a revised motion the same day as the hearing on the original motion, as plaintiffs did\nhere, such a revised motion was filed more than 45 days after plaintiffs received\ndefendants’ supplemental responses the previous October.\n              The appellate record does not show the original trial judge intended such a\nresult, as the court denied the original motion to compel without prejudice for refiling and\nwith the assurance that no further meet and confer efforts would be necessary.\nFurthermore, the trial judge who denied the revised motion did so on the ground there\nwere no further meet and confer efforts, and not on the ground such a motion was time-\nbarred.\n              We construe plaintiffs’ revised motion to compel to constitute the same\nmotion as their original motion to compel and conclude it is not time-barred under section\n2031.310, subdivision (c) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs suffered prejudice as\na result of the court’s order denying the revised motion to compel not only because their\ncounsel was sanctioned but also because the order deprived them of a ruling on the merits\nas to their revised motion seeking further discovery on the alter ego issue—an issue at the\nheart of plaintiffs’ case. We direct the court to vacate its order denying the revised\nmotion to compel and sanctioning plaintiffs’ counsel.\n                                     III.\n    THE TRIAL COURT’S ALTER EGO FINDINGS MUST BE VACATED IN LIGHT OF OUR\n         RULING ON THE REVISED MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES.\n              Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by concluding after the bench trial that\nParent and America’s Printer were not alter egos of Koji’s. We do not reach the merits of\nplaintiffs’ argument regarding alter ego liability in light of our reversal of the trial court’s\norder denying the revised motion to compel further responses to plaintiffs’ request for the\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\fproduction of documents. That set of document requests was focused on the alter ego\nissue and we do not know whether additional information on that issue might be\nproduced after the revised motion to compel is reconsidered on remand. We therefore\ndirect the trial court on remand to vacate its alter ego findings.\n              Plaintiffs argue on appeal that, aside from the discovery issue, the trial\ncourt applied the wrong legal standard for resolving the alter ego issues at trial. Our\nreview of the appellate record reveals the trial court’s misunderstanding of the applicable\nlaw on alter ego.\n              “Ordinarily, a corporation is regarded as a legal entity, separate and distinct\nfrom its stockholders, officers and directors, with separate and distinct liabilities and\nobligations. [Citations.] A corporate identity may be disregarded—the ‘corporate veil’\npierced—where an abuse of the corporate privilege justifies holding the equitable\nownership of a corporation liable for the actions of the corporation. [Citation.] Under\nthe alter ego doctrine, then, when the corporate form is used to perpetrate a fraud,\ncircumvent a statute, or accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose, the\ncourts will ignore the corporate entity and deem the corporation’s acts to be those of the\npersons or organizations actually controlling the corporation, in most instances the\nequitable owners. [Citations.]” (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

It is this aspect of the alter ego\ndoctrine that plaintiff has failed to prove both as regards Mr. Parent and A.J. Parent\nCompany, Inc.” Later in its statement of decision, the court stated, “Koji’s was a real\nbusiness with real purpose and assets and not a sham corporate entity formed for the\npurpose of committing a fraud or other misdeeds.” (Italics added.) The trial court’s\nstatements suggest a misunderstanding of the applicable law. Therefore, on remand at\nthe retrial, we direct the court to make findings on alter ego liability according to the\nrequirements set forth in Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at page 538, as quoted ante.\n              At oral argument on appeal, plaintiffs argued that retrial was unnecessary\nbecause they proved Parent’s and America’s Printer’s alter ego liability as a matter of\nlaw. We decline plaintiffs’ invitation to conclude Parent and/or America’s Printer were\nKoji’s alter egos as a matter of law. To do so would require our assessing credibility and\nweighing the extensive and conflicting testimony and documentary evidence presented at\ntrial regarding the factors set forth above, instead of reviewing this issue through the lens\nof the applicable standard of review.

Code Regs.,\ntit. 8, § 11050, subd. 2(H).) That wage order further states the term “employ” means “to\nengage, suffer, or permit to work.” (Id., § 11050, subd. 2(E).)\n              In Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at page 64, the California Supreme Court\nheld that the definition of employer contained in IWC wage orders applies to actions\nseeking recovery of unpaid minimum wages under section 1194. After analyzing the\nhistory of the wage orders and their language, and applying the rules of statutory\ninterpretation, the Supreme Court articulated the following definition to determine who\nmight have liability as an employer for unpaid minimum wages under the Labor Code:\n“To employ, then, under the IWC’s definition, has three alternative definitions. It means:\n(a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions, or (b) to suffer or\npermit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a common law employment\nrelationship.” (Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 64.)\n              The Supreme Court stated the alternative definitions of employer are\nsufficiently broad to encompass a proprietor who employs a worker by contract, permits\n\n\n                                              23\n\fwork by acquiescence, or suffers work to be performed by a failure to hinder. (Martinez,\nsupra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 69.) Furthermore, “[a] proprietor who knows that persons are\nworking in his or her business without having been formally hired, or while being paid\nless than the minimum wage, clearly suffers or permits that work by failing to prevent it,\nwhile having the power to do so.” (Ibid.)\n              Plaintiffs’ first, fourth, fifth, and seventh causes of action involve alleged\nviolations of the IWC wage order No. 5-2001 and section 1194, to which, under\nMartinez, the three alternative definitions of “employer” discussed ante would apply.\n                                          B.\n The Statement of Decision Explains the Trial Court’s Reasoning in Finding Parent Not\n        Liable as a Joint Employer with Regard to Plaintiffs’ State Law Claims.\n              In the statement of decision, the trial court concluded Parent was not liable\nas a joint employer under any of plaintiffs’ claims brought pursuant to state law, but was\nliable as a joint employer under the FLSA. The court reasoned as follows:\n              “Here, plaintiffs contend that since Mr. Parent was sole shareholder, a\ndirector of Koji’s, and president he exercised significant control over plaintiffs. Indeed,\nplaintiffs argue that since Mr. Parent hired and fired non-exempt managers of Koji’s,\ninstructed his managers to ‘get rid of’ Quiles when she filed this action and she was\nthereafter fired, and ultimately laid off all employees when the restaurants closed, he\nexercised actual control over the employees of Koji’s.\n              “Plaintiffs assert that the Court in Martinez held that under California law,\nin wage and hour actions, the Industrial Wage Commission’s definition of employer\napplies. That definition provides that any person is an employer who is authorized to:\n              “1. suffer or permit another to work;\n              “2. control wages, hours and working conditions; or\n              “3. engage employees.\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f              “Plaintiffs argue that since Mr. Parent had all of these attributes, he should\nbe considered a joint employer with plaintiffs’ direct employer, Koji’s.\n              “The problem with plaintiffs’ theory in this regard is similar to the problem\nwith their alter ego theory. If Mr. Parent is an ‘employer’ by virtue of his control as sole\nshareholder and president of Koji’s, then all owners of all closely held corporations\nwould suffer the same fate. They all have ultimate control of the corporation, whether\nthey delegate that control to managers o[r] not. It would mean that in every wage and\nhour case against a closely held corporation, the individual shareholder(s) would be liable\nas a joint employer. In this set of cases, limited liability would become the rule, not the\nexception.\n              “While Martinez did hold that IWC’s definition applies to wage and hour\ncases brought under the Labor Code, the facts of that case were different than the facts of\nthis case. In Martinez, plaintiffs were not seeking to inculpate corporate officers, board\nmembers or shareholders. Rather, plaintiffs sought to invoke the joint employer doctrine\nagainst separate companies, merchants who purchased produce from plaintiffs’ direct\nemployer. Parenthetically, the Court in Martinez affirmed the granting of summary\njudgment in defendants’ favor, finding that even under the IWC’s broad definition of\nemployer, defendants were not liable.\n              “More appropriate authority controlling our case is found in Reynolds v.\n[Bement] (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567023\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567023/reynolds-v-bement/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a case cited with approval in Martinez. In that case\nPlaintiffs sought to enforce labor code violations against officers, shareholders, directors\nand managers of a closely held corporation. On demurrer, the Court in Reynolds held\nthat ‘under the common law corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency are\nnot personally liable for the corporate employer’s failure to pay its employees . . . Had\nthe legislature meant in section 1194 to expose to personal civil liability any corporate\nagent who “exercises control” over an employee’s wages, hours, or working conditions, it\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fwould have manifested its intent more clearly than by mere silence after the IWC’s\npromulgation of Wage Order No. 9.’ [Citations.]\n              “For these reasons, the court finds that Mr. Parent was not an employer\nunder California state law.”\n                                         C.\n The Trial Court’s Determination that Parent Was Not Liable as a Joint Employer with\n  Regard to Plaintiffs’ State Law Claims Was Based on a Misapplication of the Law.\n              Although the trial court correctly identified the Supreme Court’s decision in\nMartinez as controlling authority, it appears from the court’s comments in its statement of\ndecision that the court concluded Martinez is factually distinguishable from the instant\ncase and therefore its three alternative definitions of employer are inapplicable here.

In Reynolds we\nlooked to the common law rather than the applicable wage order to define employment in\nan action under section 1194 seeking to hold a corporation’s directors and officers\npersonally liable for its employees’ unpaid overtime compensation. [Citation.] We\nconclude Reynolds does not govern this case. Wage Order No. 14, and not the common\nlaw, properly defines the employment relationship in this action under section 1194.”\n(Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 62.)\n              In Reynolds, supra, 36 Cal.4th at page 1082, the plaintiff worked for a\ncorporation that owned and operated automobile painting shops. The plaintiff sued to\nrecover unpaid overtime compensation under section 1194 and the IWC’s applicable\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fwage order. (Reynolds, supra, at p. 1083.) The plaintiff sued, inter alia, eight of his\nemployer’s officers and directors in their individual capacities. (Id. at pp. 1082-1083.)\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the order sustaining a demurrer to the claims against the\nofficers and directors on the ground plaintiff failed to state a cause of action against them.\n(Id. at pp. 1083, 1087-1088.)\n              The Supreme Court in Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pages 62 to 63,\nacknowledged that in Reynolds, it had held that the common law rather than the\napplicable wage order defined the employment relationship for purposes of a claim under\nsection 1194—a holding the court expressly disavowed in Martinez. The Martinez court\nstated: “Were we to define employment exclusively according to the common law in\ncivil actions for unpaid wages we would render the commission’s definitions effectively\nmeaningless.” (Martinez, supra, at p. 65.)\n              The Martinez court, however, added: “This is not to say the common law\nplays no role in the IWC’s definition of the employment relationship. In fact, the IWC’s\ndefinition of employment incorporates the common law definition as one alternative. As\ndefined in the wage orders, ‘“[e]mployer” means any person . . . who . . . employs or\nexercises control over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any person,’ and\n‘“[e]mploy” means to engage, suffer, or permit to work.’ [Citation.] The verbs “to\nsuffer” and “to permit,” as we have seen, are terms of art in employment law. . . . In\ncontrast, the verb ‘to engage’ has no other apparent meaning in the present context than\nits plain, ordinary sense of ‘to employ,’ that is, to create a common law employment\nrelationship. This conclusion makes sense because the IWC, even while extending its\nregulatory protection to workers whose employment status the common law did not\nrecognize, could not have intended to withhold protection from the regularly hired\nemployees who undoubtedly comprise the vast majority of the state’s workforce. To\nemploy, then, under the IWC’s definition, has three alternative definitions. It means: (a)\nto exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions, or (b) to suffer or permit\n\n                                             27\n\fto work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a common law employment relationship.”\n(Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 64, fn. omitted.)\n              The Supreme Court in Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at page 66, concluded:\n“In sum, we hold that the applicable wage order’s definitions of the employment\nrelationship do apply in actions under section 1194.

But\nParent’s status as sole shareholder and president of Koji’s cannot insulate him, or any\nother sole owner of a closely held corporation, from liability as a joint employer if his\nactions meet any one of the three definitions set forth in Martinez.

In the statement of decision, in support of its finding that\nplaintiffs had proven the first prong of the alter ego doctrine and thereby showed Parent\n“dominated or controlled” Koji’s, the trial court noted Parent was the “big boss” to Koji’s\nemployees and “had the ability to control [Koji’s and America’s Printer], whether he\nchose to delegate that responsibility to managers or not.” The court acknowledged\nplaintiffs’ contentions that “since Mr. Parent hired and fired non-exempt managers of\n\n                                              28\n\fKoji’s, instructed his managers to ‘get rid of’ Quiles when she filed this action and she\nwas thereafter fired, and ultimately laid off all employees when the restaurants closed, he\nexercised actual control over the employees of Koji’s.”\n              The trial court did not suggest it disbelieved the evidence of Parent’s\ninvolvement in Koji’s beyond that of remote sole shareholder and president.\nNevertheless it failed to apply the Martinez three-part definition of “employer” to\ndetermine whether such evidence proved joint employer liability. Instead, solely relying\non Reynolds, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567023\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567023/reynolds-v-bement/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court concluded Parent was immune from such\nliability notwithstanding such activity, because he was simply a corporate agent acting\nwithin the scope of his agency. If that were the rule, no sole shareholder and officer of a\nclosely-held corporation would ever be liable as a joint employer for wage violations,\neven if he or she suffered or permitted another to work, controlled wages, hours and\nworking conditions, or engaged employees.\n              The trial court found Parent had joint employer liability as to plaintiffs’\nfederal claims under the FLSA: “The definition of employer is broader under federal\nlabor law than under California law. Indeed, under the FLSA it has been held that under\ncertain circumstances a shareholder/officer of a closely held corporation can be liable for\nviolations along with the corporate employer. [Citation.] Under the FLSA, an employer\nincludes ‘any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation\n                    7\nto an employee.’”\n              The determination of liability for violations of the FLSA for failure to pay\nwages depends on whether there is an employer-employee relationship under the so-\ncalled “‘economic reality test.’” (Futrell v. Payday California, Inc. (2010) 190\n\n\n7\n  See Guerrero v. Superior Court, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 945 (“Martinez rejected\nthe defendants’ contention that the narrower federal standard governed the definition of\nemployer”). But see Bonnette v. California Health & Welfare Agency (9th Cir. 1983)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416892\"><a href=\"/opinion/416892/eleanor-bonnette-faye-pryor-vickie-young-joanne-r-cardone-wai-jin-wong/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1470 (referring to “the FLSA’s liberal definition of ‘employer’”).\n\n                                             </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The FLSA’s test, though distinct from the IWC’s wage orders’\ndefinition of the term ‘“employ”’ (Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 59-60), ordinarily\ninvolves the consideration of similar factors (Futrell v. Payday, Inc., supra, p. 1435). In\napplying the FLSA’s test, courts “evaluate ‘“the economic realit[y] of the work\nrelationship”’ . . . ‘“whether the alleged employer (1) had the power to hire and fire the\nemployees, (2) supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of\nemployment, (3) determined the rate and method of payment, and (4) maintained\nemployment records.”’” (Guerrero v. Superior Court, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at pp.\n928-929.) Our concern that the trial court misapplied state law in determining Parent’s\njoint employer liability deepens given the similar factors applicable to determining\nfederal joint employer liability, notwithstanding the separate definitions of the term\nemployer under state and federal law.\n              We therefore direct the trial court to vacate its finding that Parent was not\nliable as a joint employer with regard to plaintiffs’ claims involving violations of section\n1194 and IWC wage order No. 5-2001, and, on retrial, reconsider this issue by applying\neach of the three alternative definitions set forth in Martinez, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pages\n59 to 60, to the evidence presented in this case.\n                                           D.\n     The Statement of Decision Does Not Address the Legal Standard Applicable to\nDetermining Joint Employer Liability as to Plaintiffs’ Sixth, Ninth, and Twelfth Causes of\n                                        Action.\n              Although raised by plaintiffs in their objections to the proposed statement\nof decision, plaintiffs argue and we agree the statement of decision fails to address the\nlegal standard applicable to joint employer liability for plaintiffs’ claims not involving an\nalleged violation of section 1194 and/or IWC wage order No. 5-2001, namely plaintiffs’\nsixth, ninth, and twelfth causes of action. We therefore direct the court on remand to\naddress the applicable legal standards for joint employer liability with regard to these\nclaims.\n\n                                             30\n\f                   The sixth cause of action alleges defendants violated section 351, which\nprohibits an employer or agent from collecting, taking, or receiving a gratuity left for an\nemployee by a patron, and based on that statutory violation, also alleges a violation of the\nunfair competition law. Section 350, subdivision (a) provides its own definition of the\nterm employer: “[E]very person engaged in any business or enterprise in this state that\nhas one or more persons in service under any appointment, contract of hire, or\napprenticeship, express or implied, oral or written, irrespective of whether the person is\nthe owner of the business or is operating on a concessionaire or other basis.”\n                   The ninth cause of action alleges a separate violation of the unfair\ncompetition law, which provides that “an owner or officer of a corporation may be\nindividually liable under the [UCL] if he or she actively and directly participates in the\nunfair business practice.” (Bradstreet v.
