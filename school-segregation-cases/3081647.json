Hughes sued Appellee Tom Green County alleging breach of a\n\n1994 agreement, the Mutual Partial Assignments [Appendix2]. Hughes\n\ncomplains that the County breached the Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA)\n\nby failing to name the County’s library in honor of Hughes’ family. He seeks\n\ndamages in the amount of at least $3,000,000 plus attorney's fees.\n\n[Appendix3]\n\n      The MPA was executed during the course of prior litigation (the SMU\n\nlitigation). Defendant's Exhibit 1 (CR3:4) contains a copy of every pleading\n\nand any other document filed in the SMU litigation. (RR2:10)\n\n      Because this is an appeal from the grant of a plea to the jurisdiction, the\n\ninitial focus is on the facts pleaded by Hughes. His pleading is attached as\n\nAppendix3. Hughes pleads:\n\n      *that the will of Hughes’ late uncle devised the residuary of the\n\n      uncle’s estate to the County.\n\n      *that in 1994 SMU filed suit seeking release of the will’s\n\n      restrictions on the use of a gift made to it by the uncle’s will.\n\n                                        7\n\f       *that the County intervened in the SMU litigation and sought a\n\n       declaration that the residue of such gift to SMU (the amount not\n\n       needed to satisfy the purpose of the gift) belonged to the County.\n\n       *that Hughes and others (the Hughes group) thereafter intervened\n\n       in the SMU litigation and sought a declaration that the residuary\n\n       gift to the County had lapsed and that, as a consequence, the\n\n       residue of the gift to SMU belonged to the uncle’s heirs.1\n\n       *that the SMU litigation court ordered the parties to mediation.\n\n       Prior to mediation, the MPA was executed.2 Hughes pleads that the\n\nsignatories to the MPA were authorized to sign by all required authorities.\n\n(CR:808) SMU was not a party to the MPA.\n\n       By the MPA, the Hughes group assigned to the County \"50% of the net\n\nproceeds they actually receive from [the SMU litigation].\" Likewise, the\n\n\n       1\n         Hughes was one of at least three heirs participating in the SMU litigation. In the current\nlitigation, Hughes is the lone plaintiff. Thus, for the sake of simplicity the argument will in some\nrespects ignore other heirs.\n       2\n        Hughes’ brief asserts that the MPA was signed at mediation. (Brief:3) Although the\ntiming does not seem to have any significance, the record does not support the brief’s assertion.\nThe MPA is not dated. However, Hughes pleads, “Prior to mediation, Tom Green County and the\nHeirs-at-Law entered an agreement titled Mutual Partial Assignments . . . .” (CR:808) Hughes\nacknowledges that the MPA was signed before the other agreements. (Brief:14-15)\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fCounty thereby assigned to the Hughes group \"50% of the net proceeds it\n\nactually receives from [the SMU litigation].\" Similarly, the MPA provides\n\nthat “[t]hese mutual assignments are irrevocable and are intended to be a\n\nmutual exchange of 50% of the respective interests of the parties hereto in\n\nany recovery under said cause against SMU and any other adverse parties\n\nwho may be joined in the cause by mutual agreement of the parties hereto.”\n\n      The MPA expressly disavows any intent to extinguish claims. It\n\nprovides in relevant part: \"[T]his document is in no way intended to eliminate\n\nor reduce in any fashion the cause of action, claims, or rights held by the\n\nheirs-at-law or the County.\" (emphasis added).\n\n      The MPA also includes the following: \"In further consideration of this\n\nmatter, the County agrees to name the main county library, in honor of\n\nDuwain E. Hughes, Jr., and/or Frances Crews Hughes, if the commissioners\n\nconsider the County's ultimate recovery in the cause to be substantial enough\n\nfor such recognition.\" Duwain and Frances Hughes are herein referenced as\n\n“the Hughes family.”\n\n      Thereafter, during mediation, the parties executed a document\n\ncaptioned Settlement Agreement. [Appendix4] The Settlement Agreement\n\n                                       9\n\fprovided: that SMU would pay $1,000,000 to the County and the other\n\nparties to the suit (excepting one party); that SMU would obtain appropriate\n\nrelief as to the uncle’s will; and that all parties would dismiss their claims\n\nwith prejudice.\n\n      Thereafter, the parties executed a document captioned Compromise and\n\nSettlement and Release of All Claims (the Compromise Agreement).\n\n(CR:671) The Compromise Agreement [Appendix5] provides that the\n\nSettlement Agreement is “further reduced to writing in this agreement.”\n\n      The County disputes Hughes’ assertion that the Compromise\n\nAgreement “does not provide for any releases between the County and the\n\nHughes heirs.” (Brief:4) The Compromise Agreement summarizes the claims\n\nasserted by SMU, the County, and the Hughes group and provides that by the\n\nSettlement Agreement the parties agreed to a “complete and final\n\ncompromise and settlement of such suit and all of such disputes.” Similarly,\n\nthe trial court signed a Final Judgment [Appendix6] which recites that “all\n\nmatters in controversy between the parties which is the subject matter of this\n\nsuit have been fully and finally agreed to and settled.”\n\n      The Settlement Agreement, the Compromise Agreement, and the Final\n\n                                        10\n\fJudgment make no mention of the MPA. Hughes pleads that the County and\n\nthe Hughes group evenly split (50-50) the $1,000,000 paid by SMU.\n\n(CR:809)\n\n      Hughes pleads that he accepted the SMU settlement during mediation\n\nbecause the County’s representatives had stated that “the County’s portion of\n\nthe SMU’s offer would be substantial enough to warrant naming the Central\n\nLibrary as contemplated in the [MPA].”\n\n      Hughes further pleads that the County’s commissioners court met in\n\nopen session on July 9, 1994 and “considered the ultimate recovery in the\n\nlawsuit to be substantial enough and ratified the [MPA].” (CR:809) He also\n\npleads that the commissioners court ratified “the separate agreement settling\n\nclaims against SMU and dismissing the lawsuit.” (CR:809)\n\n      Hughes pleads that the County’s commissioners court met on March 1,\n\n2011 and passed a resolution which named the library the “Stephens Central\n\nLibrary” and which expressly provided that the County’s recovery in the\n\nSMU litigation is not substantial enough to name the library in honor of the\n\nHughes family. (CR:610)\n\n      Hughes sued the County, asserting three causes of action: (1) breach of\n\n                                      11\n\fthe MPA (by failing to name the library in honor of Hughes' family)\n\n(CR:812); (2) an equitable claim captioned \"money had and received,\"\n\nalleging that the County accepted the benefits of the MPA and unjustly\n\nretains the SMU settlement funds (CR:813); and (3) a declaratory judgment\n\naction asserting a violation of the Open Meetings Act and seeking to have the\n\nMarch 11, 2011 resolution naming the library declared void and\n\nunenforceable (CR:811).\n\n      The trial court granted the County’s plea to the jurisdiction and\n\ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the claims arising out of or\n\npertaining to the MPA. (CR:833)\n\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\f                    SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      Appellant Hughes sued the County seeking damages for breach of the\n\nlibrary naming provision set out in the Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA).\n\nHughes and the County executed the MPA during the course of prior\n\nlitigation, being the SMU litigation.\n\n      There is a dispute over performance of the library naming provision.\n\nThe MPA provides that the County will name the County’s library in honor\n\nof the Hughes family - if the County’s commissioners determine that the\n\nCounty’s recovery in prior litigation, the SMU litigation, is substantial\n\nenough to name the library in honor of the Hughes family. The County\n\ncontends that even had the 1994 commissioners court determined that the\n\nrecovery was substantial enough to name the library for the Hughes family\n\n(disputed), the 2011 commissioners court nevertheless had discretion to make\n\nits own determination (a contrary determination) when it named the new\n\nlibrary in honor of the Stephens family.\n\n      In an effort to avoid the expense of trial, the County pleaded\n\ngovernmental immunity. The trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction\n\nand dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the claims arising out of\n\n                                        13\n\for pertaining to the MPA.\n\n       Hughes argues that he pleaded two grounds for waiver of immunity\n\nfrom suit: waiver of immunity for breach of a settlement agreement under\n\napplication of the Lawson case and waiver of immunity by conduct.\n\n       Hughes failed to demonstrate that immunity was waived under\n\napplication of the Lawson case. In Lawson, a Supreme Court plurality\n\nopined: “[W]hen a governmental entity is exposed to suit because of a waiver\n\nof immunity, it cannot nullify that waiver by settling the claim with an\n\nagreement on which it cannot be sued.”\n\n       Thus, the Lawson rule provides that immunity is waived on a breach of\n\ncontract claim if three elements are satisfied:\n\n1- a claim was asserted against the governmental entity;\n\n2- the entity was thereby exposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity;\n\nand,\n\n3-the claim was settled by the agreement made the basis of suit.\n\n       Hughes argues that the County was “exposed to suit” (County lacked\n\nimmunity) in the SMU litigation because it voluntarily intervened in the\n\nSMU litigation. Hughes would thereby invoke the Reata case’s voluntary\n\n                                       14\n\flitigation exception to immunity.\n\n      However, in A. I. Divestitures this Court recognized that the judicially\n\npromulgated Reata immunity exception has no application to Lawson\n\nimmunity waiver. The Lawson waiver rule applies only to agreements which\n\nsettle claims as to which immunity has been statutorily waived.\n\n      In any event, the record does not support an application of Reata -\n\nbecause the County sought no damages in the SMU litigation. Likewise,\n\nReata has no application because vis-a-vis Hughes the County’s claims were\n\nmerely defensive. Hughes intervened after the County intervened.\n\n      Additionally, the Lawson immunity waiver can have no application\n\nbecause the MPA did not settle any claim - much less a claim asserted by\n\nHughes against the County. In the SMU litigation Hughes asserted no claim\n\nagainst the County.\n\n      Additionally, even if Reata's judicially implemented limitation on the\n\ncontours of immunity were engrafted onto the Lawson waiver rule, and even\n\nif Lawson otherwise had application, then logic and equity weigh in favor of\n\nlikewise engrafting and applying Reata's limited scope of jurisdiction. If the\n\nCounty's voluntary intervention in the SMU litigation, or its conduct,\n\n                                      15\n\ftriggered a waiver of immunity (disputed), then the trial court did not\n\nthereby acquire jurisdiction over Hughes' claim for monetary relief against\n\nthe County in excess of an amount sufficient to offset the County's recovery\n\n(if any). Alternatively, the 2002 Lawson plurality’s immunity waiver should\n\nnot be applied to a contract signed in 1994.\n\n      Hughes failed to demonstrate that the County waived immunity by its\n\nconduct. Hughes relies on alleged representations which as a matter of law\n\ncannot be considered.\n\n      Even if such allegations could be considered, this court has repeatedly\n\ndeclined to apply a waiver by conduct exception to immunity. Even if the\n\nwaiver by conduct theory were viable, the facts pleaded by Hughes do not\n\nsupport an equitable waiver of immunity.\n\n      The County is not alleged to have made any representations to Hughes\n\nconcerning immunity. Hughes may have presumed that the County was\n\nobligated to name the new library in honor of his family. However, a\n\nmisunderstanding of the law does not justify an equitable waiver of\n\nimmunity.\n\n      Here, the County asserts immunity in an effort to avoid the expense of\n\n                                      16\n\ftrial. The pleaded facts do not demonstrate that the County made promises\n\nwhich it intended to break.\n\n      Here, there is a good-faith dispute over performance of the library\n\nnaming provision: whether the 1994 commissioners court found that the\n\nSMU litigation recovery was substantial enough to name the library in honor\n\nof Hughes' family (disputed); and, even if it had, whether in the course of\n\nnaming the new library the 2011 commissioners court is somehow precluded\n\nfrom making its own determination (a contrary determination).\n\n      There is no showing that Hughes exercised his statutory remedy:\n\nseeking legislative authority to sue the County. For that additional reason,\n\nthere is no basis for an equitable waiver of the County’s governmental\n\nimmunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f                               ARGUMENT\n\n                                Background\n\n     There is a dispute over performance of the library naming provision set\n\nout in the Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA). The County denies that the\n\n1994 commissioners court determined that the SMU litigation recovery was\n\nsubstantial enough to name the library in honor of Hughes’ family. (CR:616)\n\nEven if the 1994 commissioners court had made such a determination, the\n\n2011 commissioners court was not thereby precluded from making its own\n\ndetermination (a contrary determination) when naming the new library.\n\n     In this regard, the issue is not whether the SMU litigation recovery was\n\nsubstantial enough to name the library in honor the Hughes’ family. The\n\nissue is whether the County’s commissioners court considers the recovery\n\nsubstantial enough to name the library for the Hughes family. The contract\n\nwhich Hughes claims to have been breached, the MPA [Appendix2],\n\nprovides that “the County agrees to name the main county library, in honor of\n\nDuwain E. Hughes, Jr., and/or Frances Crews Hughes, if the commissioners\n\nconsider the County's ultimate recovery in the cause to be substantial enough\n\nfor such recognition.\" (emphasis added).\n\n                                     18\n\f      The County contends that the 2011 commissioners court had authority\n\nto determine the issue of whether the recovery was substantial enough to\n\nname the library in honor of Hughes' family. See Catalina Dev., Inc. v.\n\nCounty of El Paso, 121 S.W.3d 704, 706 (Tex. 2003) (commissioners court\n\nnot bound by policy decisions of their predecessors); TXU Energy Retail Co.\n\nL.L.C. v.

Neal, 2011\n\nWL 1744966, at *5 (Tex.App.–Austin 2011, pet. denied) (rejecting doctrine\n\nof equitable estoppel).\n\n      Hughes alleges that the 2011 commissioners court made its\n\ndetermination in violation of the Open Meetings Act. However, even if the\n\n2011 determination were set aside, the commissioners court can make a new\n\ndetermination.\n\n      In an effort to avoid the expense of trial, the County pleaded immunity\n\nfrom liability and immunity from suit (CR:612) and filed a plea to the\n\njurisdiction (CR:651-677). The trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction\n\nand dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the claims arising out of\n\nor pertaining to the MPA.

Rusk State Hosp. v. Black, 392 S.W.3d 88, 94 (Tex.\n\n2012).

Dist. v.\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 555 (Tex. 2000).\n\n      Whether a pleader has alleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate a\n\ntrial court's subject matter jurisdiction, or whether undisputed evidence of\n\njurisdictional facts establishes a trial court's jurisdiction, is a question of law\n\nreviewed de novo. City of Carrollton v. Singer, 232 S.W.3d 790, 794 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Fort Worth 2007, pet. denied). If the pleadings affirmatively negate the\n\nexistence of jurisdiction, the plea may be granted without giving the claimant\n\nan opportunity to amend. City of McKinney v. Hank's Rest. Group, L.P., 412\n\nS.W.3d 102, 110 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2013, no pet.).\n\n      In a jurisdictional challenge, the court is bound neither by the legal\n\nconclusions nor by any illogical factual conclusions that Plaintiffs draw from\n\n                                         20\n\fthe facts pleaded.

(in review of ruling on a plea to the\n\njurisdiction, we are not bound by legal conclusions nor by any illogical\n\nfactual conclusions drawn from the facts pled).\n\n      A trial court is not required to deny an otherwise meritorious plea to the\n\njurisdiction or a motion for summary judgment based on a jurisdictional\n\nchallenge concerning some claims because the trial court has jurisdiction\n\nover other claims.

County of El Paso, 121 S.W.3d 704, 706 (Tex.\n\n2003); see Texas Nat. Res. Conservation Com'n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849,\n\n854 (Tex. 2002) (sovereign immunity ensures that current policymakers are\n\nneither bound by, nor held accountable for, policies underlying their\n\npredecessors' long-term contracts). Although sovereign immunity furthers\n\nimportant public policy goals, the courts need not justify its application.\n\n            In this Court's second Term, we acknowledged the\n      common-law rule that “no state can be sued in her own courts\n      without her consent, and then only in the manner indicated by\n      that consent.” We gave no basis for this principle of sovereign\n      immunity, perhaps because a rule then more than six centuries\n      old which the United States Supreme Court would describe as\n      “an established principle of jurisprudence in all civilized nations”\n      required no justification, or perhaps because the reasons given for\n      the rule had evolved over the centuries, from “the king can do no\n      wrong”, to preserving the dignity of the state, to protecting state\n      resources. The rule remains firmly established, and as it has come\n      to be applied to the various governmental entities in this State, an\n      important purpose is pragmatic: to shield the public from the\n\n                                       23\n\f      costs and consequences of improvident actions of their\n      governments.\n\nTooke v. City of Mexia, 197 S.W.3d 325, 331-32 (Tex. 2006) (footnotes\n\nomitted).\n\n      Technically, Texas counties enjoy the benefit of governmental\n\nimmunity - not sovereign immunity.\n\n             Courts often use the terms sovereign immunity and\n      governmental immunity interchangeably. However, they involve\n      two distinct concepts. Sovereign immunity refers to the State's\n      immunity from suit and liability. In addition to protecting the\n      State from liability, it also protects the various divisions of state\n      government, including agencies, boards, hospitals, and\n      universities. Governmental immunity, on the other hand, protects\n      political subdivisions of the State, including counties, cities, and\n      school districts.\n\nWichita Falls State Hosp. v. Taylor, 106 S.W.3d 692, 694 (Tex. 2003)\n\n(authority omitted).\n\n      For purposes of this case, there is no meaningful distinction between\n\ngovernmental immunity and sovereign immunity. Cases construing sovereign\n\nimmunity are equally relevant to governmental immunity. “Governmental\n\nimmunity operates like sovereign immunity to afford similar protection to\n\nsubdivisions of the State, including counties . . . .” Harris County v. Sykes,\n\n\n                                       24\n\f136 S.W.3d 635, 638 (Tex. 2004).\n\n      Like sovereign immunity, governmental immunity encompasses both\n\nimmunity from suit and immunity from liability. Immunity from suit can be\n\nchallenged by a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n             Referred to as governmental immunity when applied to the\n      state's political subdivisions, Travis Cent. Appraisal Dist. v.\n      Norman, 342 S.W.3d 54, 57-58 (Tex. 2011), sovereign immunity\n      encompasses both immunity from suit and immunity from\n      liability, Reata Constr. Corp., 197 S.W.3d at 374. Immunity from\n      liability is an affirmative defense that bars enforcement of a\n      judgment against a governmental entity, while immunity from\n      suit bars suit against the entity altogether and may be raised in a\n      plea to the jurisdiction. State v. Lueck, 290 S.W.3d 876, 880\n      (Tex. 2009); Wichita Falls State Hosp. v. Taylor, 106 S.W.3d\n      692, 696 (Tex. 2003).\n\nBrown & Gay Eng'g, Inc. v. Olivares, 461 S.W.3d 117, 121 (Tex. 2015).\n\n         Waiver of Governmental Immunity - Legislative Control\n\n      The courts consistently hold that only the Legislature can waive a\n\ncounty’s immunity from suit for breach of contract. The waiver must be\n\nevidenced by statute or resolution and must be expressed by clear and\n\nunambiguous language.\n\n      Express consent is required to show that immunity from suit has\n      been waived. Thus in this case [involving a contract claim],\n      Pelzel must establish consent to sue Travis County. Absent\n\n                                       25\n\f      consent, the trial court lacks jurisdiction.\n\n            A party may establish consent by statute or legislative\n      resolution.

(waiver of a county's immunity from\n\nsuit for a claimed breach of contract requires a clear and unambiguous\n\nexpression of the Legislature, either by statute or resolution).\n\n      The requirement that a statutory waiver of immunity be clear and\n\nunambiguous has been preserved by the legislature. Consider the following:\n\n             In order to preserve the legislature's interest in managing\n      state fiscal matters through the appropriations process, a statute\n      shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity unless\n      the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language. In a\n      statute, the use of “person,” as defined by Section 311.005 to\n      include governmental entities, does not indicate legislative intent\n      to waive sovereign immunity unless the context of the statute\n      indicates no other reasonable construction.

Indeed, in the Code\n      Construction Act, the Legislature expressed its desire to maintain\n      control over sovereign immunity [i]n order to preserve [its]\n      interest in managing state fiscal matters through the\n      appropriations process....; See Tex. Gov't Code § 311.034.\n      Subjecting the government to liability may hamper governmental\n      functions by shifting tax resources away from their intended\n      purposes toward defending lawsuits and paying judgments.\n      Accordingly, the Legislature is better suited than the courts to\n      weigh the conflicting public policies associated with waiving\n      immunity and exposing the government to increased liability, the\n      burden of which the general public must ultimately bear.\n\n                                        27\n\fTexas Nat.

Moreover, legislative control ensures\n      that current policymakers are neither bound by, nor held\n      accountable for, policies underlying their predecessors' long-term\n      contracts.\n\nTexas Nat. Res. Conservation Com'n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 854 (Tex.\n\n2002) (authority omitted).\n\n      Reasons for deferring to the Legislature in deciding whether to waive\n\nsovereign immunity for contract claims have been summarized as follows:\n\n      the handling of contract claims against the government involves\n      policy choices more complex than simply waiver of immunity,\n      including whether to rely on administrative processes and what\n      remedies to allow;\n\n      the government should not be kept from responding to changing\n      conditions for the public welfare by prior policy decisions\n      reflected in long-term or ill-considered obligations;\n\n      the claims process is tied to the appropriations process, and the\n      priorities that guide the latter should also inform the former; and,\n\n                                       28\n\f      the Legislature is able to deal not only with these policy concerns\n      but also with individual situations in deciding whether to waive\n      immunity by resolution, cases by case, or by statute.\n\nTexas A & M Univ.-Kingsville v. Lawson, 87 S.W.3d 518, 522 (Tex. 2002)\n\n(plurality) (footnotes omitted).\n\n      Because waiver of immunity is a matter committed to the legislature,\n\nthe courts have been reluctant to apply a waiver-by-conduct theory: being\n\nwaiver based on the notion that a governmental entity can unilaterally waive\n\nits governmental immunity through its own actions. This court has repeatedly\n\ndeclined to apply such a theory, as is demonstrated by the following:\n\n      Carowest's notion that the City can unilaterally waive its\n      governmental immunity through its own actions traces back to\n      the Texas Supreme Court's now-infamous footnote in Federal\n      Sign v. Texas Southern University intimating that \"[T]here may\n      be . . . circumstances where the State may waive its immunity by\n      conduct other than simply executing a contract so that it is not\n      always immune from suit when it contracts.\" But in the years\n      since it decided Federal Sign, the [Texas Supreme Court] has\n      clarified—and repeatedly emphasized—that it defers to the\n      Legislature, not the actions of individual governmental units, to\n      determine whether, when, and how sovereign or governmental\n      immunity should be waived. In so doing, moreover, it has\n      squarely rejected the notion that a governmental entity with\n      authority to enter contracts, or an agent acting on its behalf, can\n      contractually waive immunity from suit, as Carowest insists\n      occurred here. It has similarly declined repeated requests to\n      recognize a \"waiver by conduct,\" and has never gone further than\n\n                                      29\n\f      its suggestion in Federal Sign that such a waiver might\n      conceivably occur under some set of facts it has not yet seen.\n      Similarly, in the absence of further guidance from the supreme\n      court, this Court (at least in recent years) has consistently rejected\n      requests that we recognize \"waivers by conduct\" under a variety\n      of factual scenarios.\n\nCity of New Braunfels v. Carowest Land, Ltd., 432 S.W.3d 501, 521\n\n(Tex.App.–Austin 2014, no pet.) (emphasis added).\n\n      Legislative control over the waiver of immunity from suit does not\n\nmean that the State can freely breach contracts with private parties, or that the\n\nState can use sovereign immunity as a shield to avoid paying for benefits the\n\nState accepts under a contract. Texas Nat. Res. Conservation Com'n v.\n\nIT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 854 (Tex. 2002). There is a statutory remedy. If a\n\nparty who contracts with the State feels aggrieved, the party can seek redress\n\nby asking the Legislature to waive immunity from suit. Id., citing Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code §107.001-.005.\n\n      Although the commissioners court has authority to enter into contracts\n\non behalf of a county, it does not have authority to waive the county’s\n\nimmunity from suit. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 858 (even though the TNRCC's\n\nexecutive director had the authority to enter into the contract with IT-Davy\n\n\n                                       30\n\fon the TNRCC's behalf, he did not have authority to, and thus did not, waive\n\nthe TNRCC's immunity from suit); Labrado v. Univ. of Texas at El Paso,\n\n2012 WL 43385, at *3 (Tex.App.–Austin 2012, no pet.) (only the\n\nLegislature, not contracting parties, may waive a governmental unit's\n\nimmunity).\n\n      A county does not waive its immunity by accepting the benefits of a\n\ncontract. See Texas A&M Univ. Sys. v. Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d 835, 840 (Tex.\n\n2007) (the State does not waive its immunity from a breach-of-contract\n\naction by accepting the benefits of a contract).\n\n      Likewise, a county does not waive immunity by seeking to comply\n\nwith the terms of a contract - even if the scope of performance required by\n\nthe contract is disputed. Pelzel, 77 S.W.3d at 252 (when a governmental unit\n\nadjusts a contract price according to the contract's express terms, it does not,\n\nby its conduct, waive immunity from suit, even if the propriety of that\n\nadjustment is disputed).\n\n\n\n\n                                       31\n\f                     Waiver of Governmental Immunity -\n                      The Lawson Plurality Exception\n\n                         Lawson Issues Summarized\n\n     Hughes observes that he pleaded two grounds for waiver of immunity\n\nfrom suit: waiver of immunity for breach of a settlement agreement under\n\napplication of the Lawson case and waiver of immunity by conduct. (Brief:7)\n\nHe argues: “The issue facing this Court is whether the County waived\n\nimmunity from suit for its breach of the Agreement – either by breaching a\n\nsettlement agreement under Lawson or by its conduct in breaching the\n\nAgreement.” (Brief: 8) By “Agreement,” Hughes refers to the Mutual Partial\n\nAssignments (MPA) which contains the library naming provision. (Brief:3)\n\n     This section will address the first issue (Lawson): waiver of immunity\n\nfor breach of a settlement agreement. Following that, the County will address\n\nwaiver by conduct.\n\n     Hughes relies on an immunity waiver theory applied by a plurality of\n\nthe Supreme Court in Texas A&M University-Kingsville v. Lawson, 87\n\nS.W.3d 518 (Tex. 2002). In Lawson, the state university entered into an\n\nagreement which settled Mr. Lawson’s Whistleblower claim - being a claim\n\n\n                                     32\n\fas to which immunity had been statutorily waived. Mr. Lawson brought suit\n\nfor breach of the agreement.\n\n      Four judges (a plurality) concluded that the breach of contract claim\n\nwas not barred by immunity, ruling that the university had waived immunity\n\nby entering into the settlement agreement. The Lawson plurality opined:\n\n“[W]hen a governmental entity is exposed to suit because of a waiver of\n\nimmunity, it cannot nullify that waiver by settling the claim with an\n\nagreement on which it cannot be sued.” Lawson, 87 S.W.3d at 521.\n\n      Hughes contends that the Mutual Partial Assignments (the source of the\n\nlibrary naming provision) settled a claim as to which immunity from suit had\n\nbeen waived. In this regard, he argues that the County lost its immunity from\n\nsuit by voluntarily intervening in the SMU litigation (the Reata exception to\n\nimmunity). Hughes further contends that, under application of Lawson,\n\nimmunity from suit is as a consequence waived on his suit for breach of the\n\nMutual Partial Assignments (failure to name the library in honor of the\n\nHughes family).\n\n      The Lawson plurality’s theory of immunity waiver (Lawson waiver) is\n\nnot binding authority and should not be adopted. Even if adopted, the Court\n\n                                      33\n\fcan determine the scope of the Lawson waiver.\n\n      Even if the Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA) settled a claim on\n\nwhich immunity did not apply (disputed), the nature of the claim settled by\n\nthe MPA is not the sort of claim which falls within the scope of Lawson\n\nwaiver (Lawson waiver applying to claims as to which immunity has been\n\nstatutorily waived).\n\n      Even if otherwise applicable, the scope of Lawson waiver should be\n\nlimited to allow suit for an offset (against any monetary recovery obtained by\n\nthe County) because that is the scope of the immunity exception applicable to\n\nHughes’ voluntary intervention theory (being the Reata exception to\n\nimmunity). Alternatively Lawson should not be applied to a contract\n\nexecuted in 1994.\n\n      Immunity is the default position (it is presumed). It is the application of\n\nan exception to immunity which must be justified. Neal, 2011 WL 1744966,\n\nat *4 (the legislature has not waived immunity from suit over settlement\n\nagreements generally). The application of immunity to settlement agreements\n\nneed not be justified. Cf. Tooke v. City of Mexia, 197 S.W.3d 325, 331-32\n\n(Tex. 2006) (observing that sovereign immunity has long been recognized\n\n                                       34\n\fand, as such, needs no justification - although it serves important purposes).\n\n                    Court Not Required to Adopt Lawson\n\n      The Lawson plurality’s theory of immunity waiver is not binding\n\nauthority and should not be adopted. This Court is free to adopt or reject\n\nLawson waiver and, if adopted, is free to determine the scope of the waiver.\n\nBecause Lawson was decided by a plurality, and because the Lawson\n\nexception has never been expressly adopted by a Supreme Court majority, the\n\nLawson exception to immunity has no precedential value. See Neal, 2011 WL\n\n1744966, at *3 (Lawson is a plurality decision lacking precedential value).\n\n      This Court has applied Lawson. However, it is not clear whether the\n\nCourt applied Lawson because the Lawson rationale went unchallenged or\n\nwhether the court deemed itself bound to apply the rationale. See e.g. Travis\n\nCounty v. Rogers, 2015 WL 4718726, at *5 n.1 (Tex.App.–Austin 2015, no\n\npet.). (Pemberton, J., concurring) (observing that the issue was not raised, but\n\nCourt of Appeals might be bound to apply Lawson).\n\n      The fact that the Supreme Court has remanded cases for courts to\n\nconsider the Lawson exception does not necessarily signal the Supreme\n\nCourt’s approval of the exception. It may simply signal a desire that the\n\n                                       35\n\fcourts of appeal have the first opportunity to determine whether, and the\n\nextent to which, the exception should be applied.\n\n      The Lawson exception to immunity judicially intrudes into an area\n\nwhich is delegated to the Legislature - waiver of sovereign immunity. See\n\nTexas Nat. Res. Conservation Com'n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 854 (Tex.\n\n2002) (we have consistently deferred to the Legislature to waive sovereign\n\nimmunity from suit).\n\n      This is nothing more than an ordinary contract dispute. Unless\n      waived, the State retains its immunity from suit on a contract,\n      whether the contract is for goods and services or a settlement\n      agreement. We have repeatedly held that sovereign immunity in\n      ordinary contract claims is an area best left to legislative\n      judgment. See York, 871 S.W.2d at 177 (“[T]he waiver of\n      governmental immunity is a matter addressed to the\n      Legislature.”). Deference to the Legislature to determine\n      sovereign immunity in ordinary breach-of-contract cases\n      claiming waiver by conduct is founded on sound policy. See Fed.\n      Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 413 (Hecht, J., concurring) (“There are\n      compelling reasons for this Court to continue to defer to the\n      Legislature.”). Yet today the plurality overrides those compelling\n      reasons and concludes that although the Legislature has not\n      chosen to waive sovereign immunity for this breach-of-contract\n      claim, the University simply “may not” claim immunity in this\n      case.\n\nLawson, 87 S.W.3d at 525-26 (Rodriguez, J., dissent).\n\n      In this regard, the question is not whether the Lawson exception\n\n                                      36\n\fadvances equitable or otherwise beneficial policy. The question is whether\n\nthe policy choices should be made by the courts or by the Legislature. Cf.\n\nReata Const. Corp. v. City of Dallas, 197 S.W.3d 371, 375 (Tex. 2006) (there\n\nis tension between the concept of a governmental entity waiving its immunity\n\nfrom suit by some action independent from the Legislature's waiving\n\nimmunity and the principle that only the Legislature can waive sovereign\n\nimmunity).\n\n      The Lawson exception to immunity also ignores established law that a\n\nsuit for breach of a settlement agreement is independent of the settled claim.\n\n      The plurality concedes that the Legislature has not waived\n      immunity for Lawson's breach-of-contract claim. Nevertheless,\n      the plurality sidesteps recent precedent concerning sovereign\n      immunity in breach-of-contract suits, wholly ignores established\n      law that a suit for breach of a settlement agreement is\n      independent of the settled claim, and erroneously concludes that\n      the University may not assert immunity.\n\n                                     ***\n\n             [T]he issue here is whether the State may assert sovereign\n      immunity in an ordinary breach-of-contract case, and the answer\n      to that question is decidedly “yes.” Lawson asserted a\n      breach-of-contract claim against the University, and the State has\n      sovereign immunity on that claim. When Lawson settled, he\n      traded in his wrongful termination claims for a settlement\n      contract, and, in addition to accepting $62,000, he accepted the\n\n                                      37\n\f      risk that the State could assert immunity if it breached the\n      contract, just as all people who contract with the State accept that\n      risk. Although such a risk might discourage some parties from\n      contracting with the State, that risk has not daunted the Court\n      before. See Pelzel, 77 S.W.3d at 252; IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at\n      856; Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 408. Moreover, those who settle\n      for cash and receive payment before dismissing their suit take no\n      risk that the State will assert immunity. Thus, contrary to the\n      plurality's fears, only a handful of settlements in which the\n      private party insists on executory provisions rather than only a\n      cash settlement would be discouraged.\n\nLawson, 87 S.W.3d at 524-25 (Rodriguez, J., dissent).\n\n                       Reata Limitation on Immunity\n                  Has No Application to Lawson Exception\n\n      Even if the Lawson rationale is adopted, this Court can determine the\n\nscope of the Lawson waiver. In order to apply Lawson waiver to Hughes’\n\nclaim, the Court would need to expand the waiver beyond the narrow scope\n\nto which it was applied by the Lawson plurality.\n\n      The Lawson plurality opined: “[W]hen a governmental entity is\n\nexposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity, it cannot nullify that waiver\n\nby settling the claim with an agreement on which it cannot be sued.” Lawson,\n\n87 S.W.3d at 521 (plurality).\n\n      Thus, the Lawson rule provides that immunity is waived on a breach of\n\n\n                                       38\n\fcontract claim if three elements are satisfied:\n\n1- a claim was asserted against the governmental entity;\n\n2- the entity was thereby exposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity;\n\nand,\n\n3-the claim was settled by the agreement made the basis of suit.\n\n       Even assuming that Hughes met the other two elements (disputed),\n\nHughes has not demonstrated that in the SMU litigation the County was\n\nexposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity. Here, in an effort to\n\nestablish that immunity was waived on a claim allegedly settled by the MPA,\n\nHughes relies on Reata’s judicially created voluntary litigation exception to\n\nimmunity.\n\n       However, this Court has declined to extend the Lawson waiver in the\n\nmanner advocated by Hughes. See A.I. Divestitures, Inc. v. Texas Comm'n on\n\nEnvtl. Quality, 2016 WL 3136850, at *8 (Tex.App.–Austin 2016, no. pet. h.)\n\n(rejecting argument that the Reata exception to immunity will support an\n\napplication of Lawson waiver). A judicially created exception to immunity\n\nwill not support an application of Lawson.\n\n       The Lawson exception has no application - because even if the Mutual\n\n                                       39\n\fPartial Assignments (MPA) settled a claim, it did not settle a claim for which\n\nthe legislature had waived immunity. See A.I. Divestitures, 2016 WL\n\n3136850, at *8 (Lawson waiver is not implicated when there has been no\n\nlegislative waiver of the State's immunity). In Neal, this Court likewise\n\ndistinguished Lawson, holding as follows: “[T]he present case differs from\n\nLawson in a crucial respect: Lawson had a statutorily recognized claim (i.e .,\n\na claim for which the State had waived immunity) pending in the trial court\n\nwhen he settled with the State.” 2011 WL 1744966, at *4.\n\n      The voluntary litigation theory (the Reata rule) relied on by Hughes\n\ndoes not give rise to a statutory waiver of immunity. Instead, the voluntary\n\nlitigation theory gives rise to a limited judicial exception to immunity and, as\n\nsuch, will not support application of a Lawson waiver.\n\n      Hughes argues that the County “voluntarily intervened in the SMU\n\nlitigation and had no grounds for asserting sovereign immunity as to Hughes’\n\nclaim in the SMU Litigation.” (Brief:8,10,14). He provides neither argument\n\nnor authority. (CR:806).\n\n      However, voluntary litigation gives rise to a very limited exception to\n\nimmunity. See Employees Ret. Sys. of Texas v. Putnam, LLC, 294 S.W.3d\n\n                                       40\n\f309, 325 (Tex.App.–Austin 2009, no pet.). In Putnam, this Court observed:\n\n      In Reata, the court held that when a governmental entity files a\n      lawsuit or otherwise seeks affirmative relief, it waives immunity\n      for connected, germane, and properly defensive counterclaims,\n      but only to the extent those counterclaims offset the claims of the\n      government entity. 197 S.W.3d at 377 (“Absent the Legislature's\n      waiver of the City's immunity from suit, ... the trial court did not\n      acquire jurisdiction over a claim for damages against the City in\n      excess of damages sufficient to offset the City's recovery, if\n      any.”).\n\nPutnam, 294 S.W.3d at 324-25.\n\n      Technically, the Reata rule is not a rule of waiver - it is a judicially\n\nimplemented limitation on the contours of immunity (the extent to which\n\nimmunity will be applied). This distinction is illustrated by the following:\n\n            Although litigation actions of governmental entities\n      underlay our decisions in Reata and similar cases, we did not\n      hold that those actions effected waivers of immunity; rather, they\n      were factors we considered in defining the contours of immunity.\n      In other words, we have not, in Reata or other decisions, altered\n      the principles that (1) the boundaries of sovereign immunity are\n      determined by the judiciary, and (2) waivers of sovereign\n      immunity or consent to sue governmental entities must generally\n      be found in actions of the Legislature.\n\nCity of Dallas v. Albert, 354 S.W.3d 368, 374 (Tex. 2011) (authority\n\nomitted).\n\n      Because the Reata rule gives rise to a judicially implemented limitation\n\n                                        41\n\fon the contours of immunity, its application to Lawson waiver is\n\ninappropriate because, as noted, Lawson waiver is justified (if at all) by its\n\napplication to statutorily recognized claims (claims as to which the legislature\n\nhas waived immunity).\n\n      This Court recently held that the Reata voluntary litigation rule has no\n\napplication to Lawson waiver, holding as follows:\n\n      Relying on Reata Construction Corporation v. City of Dallas,\n      A.I. asserts that by filing suit against A.I., the Commission\n      waived immunity concerning any and all of A.I.'s potential\n      defenses and potential offsets. See Reata Constr. Corp. v. City of\n      Dallas, 197 S.W.3d 371, 374 (Tex.2006). Relying further on\n      Texas A & M University–Kingsville v. Lawson, A.I. maintains\n      that because the Commission agreed to settle the enforcement\n      action, for which according to A.I. it had waived its immunity, it\n      could not claim immunity from a suit alleging that it breached\n      that settlement agreement. See Texas A & M Univ.-Kingsville v.\n      Lawson, 87 S.W.3d 518, 520–23 (Tex.2002) (holding exception\n      to sovereign immunity exists when suit alleges breach of\n      agreement settling claim for which Legislature has waived State's\n      immunity).\n\n                                      ***\n\n      In this case there is no legislative waiver of the Commission's\n      immunity such that applying immunity to A.I.'s suit for breach of\n      an agreement settling the enforcement action would thwart the\n      Legislature's policy judgments in waiving immunity in the first\n      place. See Lawson, 87 S.W.3d at 521 (“[W]hen a governmental\n      entity is exposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity, it\n\n                                       42\n\f      cannot nullify that waiver by settling the claim with an agreement\n      on which it cannot be sued ... without defeating the purpose of\n      the waiver in the first place.”). The Lawson exception to\n      sovereign immunity is simply not implicated when there has been\n      no legislative waiver of the State's immunity. A.I.'s breach of\n      contract claim was barred by sovereign immunity, and the district\n      court properly granted the Commission's plea to the jurisdiction\n      as to that claim.\n\nA. I. Divestitures, 2016 WL 3136850, at *8.\n\n      The Supreme Court has recognized that the Lawson rule creates a\n\n“narrow exception.” See Texas A & M Univ. Sys. v. Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d\n\n835, 838 (Tex. 2007) (pleadings against Texas A & M did not fit the narrow\n\nexception suggested by the plurality in Lawson). The Lawson exception\n\npermits immunity to be disregarded only if the agreement settled a claim as to\n\nwhich immunity is statutorily waived.\n\n      The rationale underlying Lawson provides that the legislature has\n\nwaived immunity on the claim so enforcement of an agreement settling the\n\nclaim preserves and perpetuates the statutory waiver. This court has\n\nrecognized that the Lawson plurality “found a waiver of immunity in the\n\nsituation at bar only because it concluded that the Legislature intended one.”\n\nNeal, 2011 WL 1744966, *13 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                        43\n\f      The key distinction - the Lawson plurality determined that immunity\n\nwas waived by the legislature and not by the courts. See Lawson, 87 S.W.3d\n\nat 522 (once the Legislature has decided to waive immunity for a class of\n\nclaims, the inclusion of settlements within the waiver is consistent with that\n\ndecision); Tex. A&M Univ. Sys. v. Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d 835, 840 (Tex.\n\n2007) (in Lawson, a plurality of this Court held a plaintiff's claim for breach\n\nof an agreement settling his underlying Whistleblower Act claim was\n\nencompassed within the Legislature's decision to waive immunity for\n\nWhistleblower Act claims).\n\n      Both the Lawson plurality and dissent recognized the need to give\n\ndeference to the legislature’s role in waiving sovereign immunity. The\n\nLawson four-judge dissent opined that the plurality exception failed to give\n\ndue deference to the Legislature, as follows:\n\n      We have repeatedly held that sovereign immunity in ordinary\n      contract claims is an area best left to legislative judgment. See\n      York, 871 S.W.2d at 177 (\"The waiver of governmental\n      immunity is a matter addressed to the Legislature.\"). Deference to\n      the Legislature to determine sovereign immunity in ordinary\n      breach-of-contract cases claiming waiver by conduct is founded\n      on sound policy. See Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 413 (Hecht, J.,\n      concurring) (\"There are compelling reasons for this Court to\n      continue to defer to the Legislature.\"). Yet today the plurality\n\n                                       44\n\f      overrides those compelling reasons and concludes that although\n      the Legislature has not chosen to waive sovereign immunity for\n      this breach-of-contract claim, the University simply \"may not\"\n      claim immunity in this case.\n\nId. at 525 (Rodriguez, J., dissent).\n\n      The Lawson plurality recognized that the Legislature was due\n\ndeference but concluded that such deference was not abridged - because the\n\nLawson exception gives effect to a statutorily recognized claim, as follows:\n\n             Allowing suit against the government for breach of an\n      agreement settling a claim for which immunity has been waived\n      does not interfere with the Legislature's policy choices. On the\n      contrary, having determined to allow suits on such claims and\n      prescribed the available remedies, the Legislature must surely\n      have considered -- indeed, hoped -- that claims would often be\n      settled. If anything, for the government to be immune from the\n      enforcement of such settlements would impair the purposes of the\n      waiver by limiting its effectiveness in cases not tried to a final\n      judgment.\n\n                                       ***\n\n      Once the Legislature has decided to waive immunity for a class\n      of claims, the inclusion of settlements within the waiver is\n      consistent with that decision.\n\n                                       ***\n\n      In resolving this issue, we have concluded that the dissent's rigid\n      view of immunity from suit for breach of contract would impair\n      the effectiveness of the legislative waiver of immunity expressed\n\n                                       45\n\f      in the Whistleblower Act by pressuring the government and some\n      claimants to remain in litigation rather than settle.\n\nLawson, id. at 522-23 (plurality, emphasis added).\n\n      Enforcing settlements of claims which have not been statutorily\n\nauthorized denies due legislative deference and is inconsistent with the\n\npolicies recognized by both the Lawson plurality and the Lawson dissent. As\n\nnoted, this court has recognized that the Lawson plurality “found a waiver of\n\nimmunity in the situation at bar only because it concluded that the\n\nLegislature intended one.” Neal, 2011 WL 1744966, *13 (emphasis added).\n\n      The following underscores the fact that Lawson’s application is limited\n\nto claims on which immunity has been statutorily waived.\n\n      Where the Legislature has chosen to waive immunity as to a\n      cause of action against government, government settles the\n      claim, and then government allegedly breaches the settlement\n      agreement and tries to invoke immunity as a bar to any claims for\n      breach, Lawson holds that the immunity that would ordinarily bar\n      the claims for breach (aside from some sort of independent\n      legislative waiver) does not apply.\n\nRogers, 2015 WL 4718726, at *5 (Pemberton, J., concurring) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n      The Legislature is better suited than the courts to weigh the conflicting\n\n\n                                      46\n\fpublic policies associated with waiving immunity and exposing the\n\ngovernment to increased liability, the burden of which the general public\n\nmust ultimately bear. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 854; City of New Braunfels v.\n\nCarowest Land, Ltd., 432 S.W.3d 501, 521 (Tex.App.–Austin 2014, no pet.)\n\n(the Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that it defers to the\n\nLegislature to determine whether, when, and how sovereign or governmental\n\nimmunity should be waived).\n\n      Hughes relies on City of Carrollton v. Singer, 232 S.W.3d 790\n\n(Tex.App.–Fort Worth 2007, pet. den.). However, Singer is consistent with\n\nLawson's application to statutorily authorized claims.\n\n      In Singer, the court applied Lawson to an agreement settling an\n\neminent domain proceeding - in which proceeding the Singers asserted a\n\nclaim against the City alleging inadequate compensation for the City's\n\nacquisition of their property, and for which the City would not be immune.\n\nSinger, 232 S.W.3d at 800 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 2007, pet. denied). The\n\nSinger court observed that condemnation is a process created entirely by\n\nstatute. Id. at 797. The court held that the landowners settled a claim for\n\nwhich the governmental entity's immunity is statutorily waived and that\n\n                                       47\n\fenforcement of that settlement necessarily is included within that initial\n\nwaiver. Id. at 799-800.\n\n      Thus Singer is consistent with Lawson's limited application, being\n\napplication to the settlement of statutorily authorized claims. Because the\n\nMPA did not settle a statutorily authorized claim, Lawson waiver should not\n\nbe applied.\n\n                                Any Recovery\n                     Should Be Limited To A Reata Offset\n\n      Reata applies retrospectively. See Putnam, 294 S.W.3d at 325-26\n\n(given that the Texas Supreme Court has seen fit to apply its decision in\n\nReata retrospectively, including to those cases pending on appeal at the time\n\nReata was issued, we see no reason not to do so in the present case as well).\n\nThe principles underlying Reata date back to at least 1943. See Reata, 197\n\nS.W.3d at 377 (observing that Reata court merely applies principles\n\npromulgated as early as 1943 in the Humble Oil case); cf. Federal Sign v.\n\nTSU., 951 S.W.2d 401, 408 (Tex. 1997) (the three times this Court\n\nconsidered sovereign immunity in the breach of contract context, we held that\n\nthe State is immune from suit arising from breach of contract suits).\n\n\n                                       48\n\f      If Reata’s judicially implemented limitation on the contours of\n\nimmunity is engrafted onto the Lawson waiver rule, then logic weighs in\n\nfavor of likewise engrafting and applying Reata’s limited scope of\n\njurisdiction: the trial court would not thereby acquire jurisdiction over a\n\nclaim for monetary relief against the governmental entity in excess of\n\ndamages sufficient to offset the governmental entity’s recovery, if any.\n\n      This Court has recognized the limited scope of jurisdiction imparted by\n\nReata:\n\n      In Reata, the court held that when a governmental entity files a\n      lawsuit or otherwise seeks affirmative relief, it waives immunity\n      for connected, germane, and properly defensive counterclaims,\n      but only to the extent those counterclaims offset the claims of the\n      government entity. 197 S.W.3d at 377 (“Absent the Legislature's\n      waiver of the City's immunity from suit, ... the trial court did not\n      acquire jurisdiction over a claim for damages against the City in\n      excess of damages sufficient to offset the City's recovery, if\n      any.”).\n\nPutnam 294 S.W.3d at 324-25.\n\n      A contrary rule (applying an unlimited waiver of immunity) would\n\nraise a disincentive for governmental entities to settle claims. If in the\n\nabsence of settlement governmental entities are (under operation of Reata)\n\nexposed to a limited waiver of immunity (damages limited to an offset), but\n\n                                        49\n\fby settling are exposed (under operation of Lawson) to an unlimited waiver\n\n(and unlimited damages), then governmental entities are not likely to settle\n\nclaims. Fewer settlements means more litigation.\n\n       Hughes seeks damages in the amount of at least $3,000,000 plus\n\nattorney’s fees. [Appendix3] If the County’s voluntary intervention in the\n\nSMU litigation, or its conduct, triggered a waiver of immunity (disputed),\n\nthen the trial court did not thereby acquire jurisdiction over Hughes’ claim\n\nfor monetary relief against the County in excess of an amount sufficient to\n\noffset the County’s recovery (if any).\n\n                 Alternatively Lawson Should Not Be Applied\n                       To A Contract Executed in 1994\n\n      If it should be determined that Reata's judicially implemented\n\nlimitation on the contours of immunity (jurisdiction limited to an offset) is\n\ninapplicable, then it would be contrary to public policy to apply the Lawson\n\nwaiver rule to the MPA. See Putnam, 294 S.W.3d at 325 (although Texas\n\nSupreme Court decisions usually apply retrospectively, exceptions may be\n\nrecognized when considerations of fairness and policy dictate prospective\n\neffect only).\n\n\n                                         50\n\f        The contract herein made the subject of suit, the MPA, was executed in\n\n1994. The Lawson rule was not announced until 2002 and even then it was\n\nsupported only by a plurality. The rule is yet to be applied by a majority of\n\nthe Supreme Court.\n\n        The Lawson plurality supported its immunity waiver by entertaining a\n\npresumption that a governmental entity calculates risk when entering into a\n\nsettlement agreement. The plurality observed that the governmental entity\n\ntrades unknowns for knowns, “being obligations that are more accurately\n\nassessable.” Lawson, 87 S.W.3d at 522 ) (plurality). However, here, it cannot\n\nbe said that the risk (a Lawson immunity waiver) was known to the County in\n\n1994.\n\n                  Record Does Not Support A Lawson Waiver\n\n        As was demonstrated, the Lawson rule provides that immunity is\n\nwaived on a breach of contract claim if three elements are satisfied:\n\n1- a claim was asserted against the governmental entity;\n\n2- the entity was thereby exposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity;\n\nand,\n\n3-the claim was settled by the agreement made the basis of suit.\n\n                                       51\n\f      Hughes argues that the County lost its immunity on SMU litigation\n\nclaims by voluntarily intervening in the SMU litigation (being the Reata\n\nimmunity exception). Hughes reasons that the Mutual Partial Assignments\n\n(the source of the library naming provision) as a consequence settled a claim\n\nas to which the County had no immunity (the Lawson immunity waiver).\n\n      However, even if this co-mingling of theories (Reata and Lawson) had\n\nmerit, the pleaded facts do not fit the theories. The County’s intervention in\n\nthe SMU litigation did not implicate the Reata immunity exception. Even if it\n\nhad, Lawson waiver would not be implicated because: (1) Hughes asserted no\n\nclaim against the County (as contrasted with a claim against SMU); and, (2)\n\nthe Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA) did not settle a claim.\n\n      The record does not implicate the Reata immunity exception. The\n\nCounty’s intervention in the SMU litigation did not implicate the Reata\n\nimmunity exception (being the second Lawson element - “exposed to suit\n\nbecause of waiver”).\n\n      The Reata exception has application only if the governmental entity\n\nasserts a claim for damages. The Reata court held: \"Once it asserts\n\naffirmative claims for monetary recovery, the City must participate in the\n\n                                       52\n\flitigation process as an ordinary litigant, save for the limitation that the City\n\ncontinues to have immunity from affirmative damage claims against it for\n\nmonetary relief exceeding amounts necessary to offset the City's claims.\"\n\nReata, 197 S.W.3d at 377.\n\n         In contrast, a governmental entity's affirmative claim for declaratory\n\nrelief does not have any effect on the entity's immunity. City of McKinney v.\n\nHank's Rest. Group, L.P., 412 S.W.3d 102, 116 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2013, no\n\npet.).\n\n         Here, Hughes pleads that the County sought declaratory relief (“sought\n\na declaration”). (CR:807) Hughes thereby negated the claimed waiver of\n\nimmunity. The County’s intervention did not waive the County’s immunity\n\nas to claims asserted against the County by Hughes (if any).\n\n         Additionally, the County’s intervention in the SMU litigation did not\n\nimplicate the Reata immunity exception because, as between the County and\n\nHughes, the County's SMU litigation claim was defensive. The Reata goal is\n\nto provide the party sued an opportunity to assert defensive claims. See\n\nReata, 197 S.W.3d at 374 (where a state voluntarily files a suit and submits\n\nits rights for judicial determination, the defense will be entitled to plead and\n\n                                         53\n\fprove all matters properly defensive). The Reata court held that “it would be\n\nfundamentally unfair to allow a governmental entity to assert affirmative\n\nclaims against a party while claiming it had immunity as to the party's claims\n\nagainst it.” Reata, 197 S.W.3d at 375-76 (emphasis added).\n\n      Here however, as between the County and Hughes, in the SMU\n\nlitigation it was the County which stood in the defendant’s shoes. In this\n\nregard, the County did not initiate litigation with Hughes. The County sued\n\nSMU (by intervening in the pending suit).\n\n      If the County is deemed to have asserted a claim against Hughes\n\n(disputed), the claim is defensive in nature and as such would not trigger the\n\nReata exception to immunity. Cf. Smith v. Lutz, 149 S.W.3d 752, 758\n\n(Tex.App.–Austin 2004, no pet.) (since IT-Davy, this Court has only\n\nrecognized a waiver of immunity in contract cases when the State has first\n\nsued the contracting party).\n\n      Hughes pleads that he intervened after the County had intervened.\n\n(CR:808-809) Hughes thereby negated application of a waiver based on\n\nvoluntary litigation. As between the County and Hughes it was Hughes who\n\nstood in the plaintiff’s shoes and, consequently, Hughes cannot invoke the\n\n                                      54\n\fbenefit of a voluntary litigation doctrine which is designed to afford fairness\n\nto a defendant.\n\n      The record does not implicate the Lawson immunity waiver. Even if\n\nHughes had satisfied the second Lawson element (exposed to suit because of\n\nwaiver), under the facts pleaded the Lawson immunity exception would not\n\nbe implicated because Hughes failed to satisfy the first and third elements.\n\nElement One: In the SMU litigation Hughes asserted no claim against the\n\nCounty (as contrasted with a claim against SMU) and thus had no claim\n\nagainst the County that could be deemed settled by the Mutual Partial\n\nAssignments (MPA). Element Three: the MPA did not settle a claim - it was\n\nthe post-MPA agreement and judgment which settled claims.\n\n      The trial court found that the MPA is a “mutual settlement agreement.”\n\n(CR:833) The meaning and intent of this finding is not clear. The trial court\n\nerred as a matter of law if it thereby determined that the MPA settled a claim\n\nasserted by Hughes against the County - the record conclusively negates such\n\na conclusion. The fact that the trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction\n\nimplies that the court did not assign such a construction to the MPA.\n\n      In the SMU litigation Hughes asserted no claim against the County (as\n\n                                        55\n\fcontrasted with a claim against SMU) and thus had no claim against the\n\nCounty that could be deemed settled by the MPA. In such litigation, Hughes\n\nand the County each sought to establish ownership of assets which were\n\nbeing enjoyed by SMU. Neither Hughes nor the County therein asserted a\n\nclaim against the other.\n\n      In this regard, Hughes pleads that the County sought “a declaration that\n\nthe residue of the gift to SMU belonged to the County Library.” (CR:807)\n\nHughes pleads that Hughes sought “a declaration that because of the lapse in\n\nthe gift of the residue to Tom Green County, the residue of the gift to SMU\n\nbelonged to [the uncle’s] heirs at law [the Hughes group].” (CR:808 -\n\nemphasis added) Although the relief sought by Hughes and the County\n\nconflicted in the sense that relief for one precluded relief for the other, the\n\nclaims were asserted against SMU.\n\n      Additionally, the MPA did not settle a claim. It was the post-MPA\n\nagreements and judgment which settled claims. The MPA merely altered the\n\nownership structure of the claims asserted by Hughes and the County against\n\nSMU.\n\n      By the MPA, the Hughes group assigned to the County \"50% of the net\n\n                                        56\n\fproceeds they actually receive from [the SMU litigation].\" (CR:662-663)\n\nLikewise, by the MPA the County assigned to the Hughes group \"50% of the\n\nnet proceeds it actually receives from [the SMU litigation].\"(CR:662-663)\n\nSimilarly, the MPA provides that “[t]hese mutual assignments are irrevocable\n\nand are intended to be a mutual exchange of 50% of the respective interests\n\nof the parties hereto in any recovery under said cause against SMU and any\n\nother adverse parties who may be joined in the cause by mutual agreement of\n\nthe parties hereto.” (CR:664)\n\n      In this manner, the MPA merely transfers an interest in net proceeds.\n\nThe MPA expressly disavows any intent to extinguish claims, providing in\n\nrelevant part as follows: \"[T]his document is in no way intended to eliminate\n\nor reduce in any fashion the cause of action, claims, or rights held by the\n\nheirs-at-law or the County.\" [Appendix2] (emphasis added).\n\n      Hughes reasons that any claim asserted by Hughes against the County\n\nin the SMU litigation would still be viable if the MPA did not settle that\n\nclaim. However, as noted, Hughes did not assert a claim against the County.\n\n      In any event, the post-MPA agreements and judgment (not the MPA)\n\nsettled claims. The County disputes Hughes’ assertion that one of these post-\n\n                                       57\n\fMPA agreements, the Compromise Agreement [Appendix 5], “does not\n\nprovide for any releases between the County and the Hughes heirs.” (Brief:4)\n\n      The SMU litigation claims were settled by the Settlement Agreement,\n\nthe Compromise Agreement, and the Final Judgment. The Compromise\n\nAgreement [Appendix 5] summarizes the claims asserted by SMU, the\n\nCounty, and the Hughes group and provides that by the Settlement\n\nAgreement [Appendix 4] (another post-MPA agreement) the parties agreed to\n\na “complete and final compromise and settlement of such suit and all of such\n\ndisputes.” Similarly, the trial court signed a Final Judgment [Appendix 6]\n\nwhich recites that “all matters in controversy between the parties which is the\n\nsubject matter of this suit have been fully and finally agreed to and settled.”\n\n\n\n\n                                       58\n\f             Waiver of Governmental Immunity - By Conduct\n\n      Hughes observes that he pleaded two grounds for waiver of immunity\n\nfrom suit: (1) waiver of immunity for breach of a settlement agreement under\n\napplication of the Lawson case and (2) waiver of immunity by conduct.\n\n(Brief:7) He argues: “The issue facing this Court is whether the County\n\nwaived immunity from suit for its breach of the Agreement – either by\n\nbreaching a settlement agreement under Lawson or by its conduct in\n\nbreaching the Agreement.” (Brief: 8) By “Agreement,” he refers to the\n\nMutual Partial Assignments (MPA) which contains the library naming\n\nprovision. (Brief:3)\n\n      This section will address the second issue: waiver of immunity by\n\nconduct. This ground for waiver of immunity has special relevance to\n\nHughes’ equitable claim captioned \"money had and received,\" alleging that\n\nthe County accepted the benefits of the MPA and unjustly retained SMU’s\n\nsettlement payment. (CR:813)\n\n      Hughes’ pleadings do not support a waiver of immunity by conduct.\n\nHughes pleads: “Tom Green County has waived sovereign immunity from\n\nsuit as a result of its conduct in entering into and then breaching the Mutual\n\n                                       59\n\fPartial Assignments between Hughes and the County.” (CR:806)\n\n      Hughes pleads the following facts in support of waiver by conduct\n\nexception to immunity:\n\n      18. At the time that the $1,000,000 settlement offer was made,\n      and although he was already delegated authority, Timothy\n      Weatherby contacted the other County Commissioners, and they\n      all agreed that the County's $500,000 share was \"significant\" (as\n      it constituted the largest single cash donation the County had ever\n      received), should be accepted, and warranted naming the Central\n      Tom Green County Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or\n      Frances Hughes Crews, as set forth in the Agreement. Id.\n\n      19. Because the Tom Green County representatives at the\n      mediation stated that the County's portion of SMU's offer would\n      be substantial enough to warrant naming the Central Library as\n      contemplated in the Assignment Agreement, the Heirs-at-Law\n      agreed to go along with Tom Green County and accepted SMU's\n      offer. Id. Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement, the\n      Heirs-at-Law and Tom Green County split those proceeds 50/50.\n      Id.\n\n(CR:808)\n\n      These statements alleged to have been made at mediation should not be\n\nconsidered for any purpose. Use of the statements is barred by the mediation\n\nprivilege, being Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 154.073. This statute\n\nprovides that, subject to exceptions not shown applicable by the record,\n\n      a communication relating to the subject matter of any civil or\n\n                                      60\n\f      criminal dispute made by a participant in an alternative dispute\n      resolution procedure, whether before or after the institution of\n      formal judicial proceedings, is confidential, is not subject to\n      disclosure, and may not be used as evidence against the\n      participant in any judicial or administrative proceeding.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 154.073 (West).\n\n      Because the statute indicates such privileged information cannot be\n\ndisclosed or considered, it therefore follows it is a substantive defect that\n\ncannot be waived by failing to obtain a ruling from the trial court.\n\nHydroscience Techs., Inc. v. Hydroscience, Inc., 401 S.W.3d 783, 793\n\n(Tex.App.–Dallas 2013, pet. denied). Moreover, the County pleaded the\n\nstatute in bar of such representations. (CR:614)\n\n      The Hydroscience court observed that “[p]arties must not be allowed to\n\nuse evidence from mediation to dispute terms of a settlement agreement,\n\nparticularly years later.” 401 S.W.3d at 796. Here, the MPA [Appendix2]\n\n(executed in 1994) expressly provides that the commissioners court will have\n\ndiscretion to determine whether the recovery is substantial enough to name\n\nthe library in honor of the Hughes family. Hughes would use statements\n\nallegedly made in mediation to establish that the County’s commissioners\n\ncourt had no such discretion, notwithstanding the fact that Hughes pleads that\n\n                                        61\n\fthe 1994 commissioners court subsequently (after the statements were made)\n\nratified the MPA. (CR:809)\n\n      Additionally, statements made by commissioners outside the context of\n\nan official meeting should not be considered. The County is not bound by\n\nany such representations. See Tarrant County v. Smith, 81 S.W.2d 537, 538\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.–Fort Worth 1935, writ ref'd) (the commissioners' court does\n\nnot act by the statement of one member thereof at the local drug store and\n\nanother at the county victuals emporium - they meet as a court and transact\n\nthe county business in open session); cf. Labrado, 2012 WL 43385, at *3\n\n(only the Legislature, not contracting parties, may waive a governmental\n\nunit's immunity).\n\n      In any event, this court has repeatedly declined to apply a waiver by\n\nconduct exception to immunity, as is demonstrated by the following:\n\n              Carowest's notion that the City can unilaterally waive its\n      governmental immunity through its own actions traces back to\n      the Texas Supreme Court's now-infamous footnote in Federal\n      Sign v. Texas Southern University intimating that \"[T]here may\n      be . . . circumstances where the State may waive its immunity by\n      conduct other than simply executing a contract so that it is not\n      always immune from suit when it contracts.\" But in the years\n      since it decided Federal Sign, the [Texas Supreme Court] has\n      clarified—and repeatedly emphasized—that it defers to the\n\n                                      62\n\f      Legislature, not the actions of individual governmental units, to\n      determine whether, when, and how sovereign or governmental\n      immunity should be waived. In so doing, moreover, it has\n      squarely rejected the notion that a governmental entity with\n      authority to enter contracts, or an agent acting on its behalf, can\n      contractually waive immunity from suit, as Carowest insists\n      occurred here. It has similarly declined repeated requests to\n      recognize a \"waiver by conduct,\" and has never gone further than\n      its suggestion in Federal Sign that such a waiver might\n      conceivably occur under some set of facts it has not yet seen.\n      Similarly, in the absence of further guidance from the supreme\n      court, this Court (at least in recent years) has consistently rejected\n      requests that we recognize \"waivers by conduct\" under a variety\n      of factual scenarios.\n\nCity of New Braunfels v. Carowest Land, Ltd., 432 S.W.3d 501, 521\n\n(Tex.App.–Austin 2014, no pet.).\n\n      Hughes cites Texas Southern University v. State Street Bank & Trust\n\nCo., 212 S.W.3d 893 (Tex.App.-Hou. [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).\n\nHowever, this Court has expressly rejected application of State Street. See\n\nLabrado, 2012 WL 43385, at *3 (court does not have discretion to recognize\n\nState Street’s waiver by conduct exception to sovereign immunity in the\n\nabsence of Supreme Court authority).\n\n      Other courts have likewise criticized State Street. See e.g. City of\n\nMcKinney v. Hank's Rest. Group, L.P., 412 S.W.3d 102, 114\n\n\n                                       63\n\f(Tex.App.–Dallas 2013, no pet.) (the amorphous nature of State Street’s\n\nwaiver-by-conduct doctrine weighs against its adoption); Leach v. Texas\n\nTech Univ., 335 S.W.3d 386, 401 (Tex.App.–Amarillo 2011, pet. denied)\n\n(State Street contradicts the Supreme Court's statements about the only\n\navenue for redress being through the Texas Legislature).\n\n      Some courts have distinguished State Street on the ground that the\n\nState Street case involved an egregious set of facts. It appears that no court\n\nhas applied State Street to find a waiver of immunity.\n\n      Before this Court expressly rejected any application of State Street, this\n\nCourt distinguished State Street in Smith v. City of Blanco, 2009 WL\n\n3230836 (Tex.App.–Austin 2009, no pet.). The Court observed that in State\n\nStreet TSU’s attorney had given false assurances of the validity and\n\nenforceability of the contract to lure CMS into the contract, then TSU\n\nreneged on its agreement, and tried to hide behind the cloak of immunity.\n\n2009 WL 3230836, at *4. In Blanco, this Court failed to find such egregious\n\nconduct - stressing that the city had made no representations to plaintiff\n\nconcerning immunity. Id. The court held that the plaintiff’s potential\n\nmisunderstanding of the law was not enough to justify an equitable waiver of\n\n                                       64\n\fimmunity against the City. Id.\n\n      As in Blanco, the County is not alleged to have made any\n\nrepresentations to Hughes concerning immunity. Even if Hughes presumed\n\nthat the County was obligated to name the library in honor of his family, a\n\nmisunderstanding of the law does not justify an equitable waiver of\n\nimmunity.\n\n      In Jonah Water Special Util. Dist. v. White, 2009 WL 2837649\n\n(Tex.App.–Austin 2009, pet. struck), this Court failed to find the\n\n“extraordinary factual circumstances” presented in State Street where the\n\nrecord did not indicate that the defendant had procured a contract with\n\npromises it intended to break and the lawsuit appeared to have grown out of\n\nwhat was initially a good-faith disagreement over performance under the\n\ncontract. 2009 WL 2837649, at *3.\n\n      Here, the County asserts immunity in an effort to avoid the expense of\n\ntrial. The pleaded facts do not demonstrate that the County made promises\n\nwhich it intended to break.\n\n      Here, there is a good-faith dispute over performance of the library\n\nnaming provision: whether the 1994 commissioners court found that the\n\n                                      65\n\fSMU litigation recovery was substantial enough to name the library in honor\n\nof Hughes’ family (disputed); and, even if it had, whether in the course of\n\nnaming the new library the 2011 commissioners court is somehow precluded\n\nfrom making its own determination (a contrary determination). This issue\n\nwas previously discussed.\n\n      Finally Hughes, having waived his statutory remedy, has shown no\n\nright to equitable relief. Hughes could have sought legislative consent to sue.\n\nSee IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 854 (if a party who contracts with the State feels\n\naggrieved, it can seek redress by asking the Legislature to waive immunity\n\nfrom suit). Hughes does not plead that he even sought, much less obtained,\n\nlegislative consent. Hughes has not pleaded a basis for waiver of immunity\n\nby conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                      66\n\f                                  PRAYER\n\n      Appellee Tom Green County prays:\n\n1.

Hughes files this Third Amended Petition to Enforce a Settlement\n\nAgreement he entered with Tom Green County to resolve claims the underlying lawsuit.\n\nI.        Related Case\n\n          1.        This action is being filed to enforce a settlement agreement entered in Cause No.\n\nCV91-0426-A; In re the Will of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr., in the 51st Judicial District Court of Tom\n\nGreen County.\n\nII.       Discovery\n\n          2.        Discovery in this action should be governed by the Level III scheduling order entered\n\nin this matter.\n\nIII.      Parties\n\n          3.        Plaintiff Charles J. Hughes is a resident of Tom Green County.\n\n          4.        Defendant Tom Green County is a county located in Texas. Tom Green County has\n\nanswered and appeared in this suit.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action             Page 1\n\n                                                            805\n\fIV.       Venue and Jurisdiction\n\n          5.        Venue is mandatory in Tom Green County. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 15.015.\n\n          6.        This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Tom Green County because this action\n\narises from a settlement agreement entered between parties to an action initiated, in part, by Tom\n\nGreen County, and Tom Green County thereby waived sovereign immunity. Kinnear v. Tex.\n\nComm’n on Human Rights ex rel. Hale, 14 S.W. 299, 300 (Tex. 2000)(holding the state waives\n\nimmunity from suit when it files suit); Tex. A&M Univ.–Kingsville v. Lawson, 87 S.W.3d 518, 521\n\n(Tex. 2002)(holding where the state has waived sovereign immunity, and then enters an agreement\n\nsettling the claims subject to that waiver, the state cannot assert sovereign immunity as a basis to\n\navoid enforcement of the settlement). Further, Tom Green County has waived sovereign immunity\n\nfrom suit as a result of its conduct in entering into and then breaching the Mutual Partial\n\nAssignments between Hughes and the County.\n\n          7.        In addition, Hughes files a declaratory judgement action seeks to invalidate and set\n\naside a March 1, 2011 motion and resolution of the Tom Green County Commissioners' Court made\n\nin violation of the Texas Open Meeting Act. Texas courts have repeatedly held that the State has\n\nwaived sovereign immunity for alleged violations of the Texas Open Meetings Act. See, e.g., Riley\n\nv. Comm'rs Ct., 413 S.W.3d 774, 776 - 77 (Tex. App. - Austin 2013, no pet.). Moreover, this action\n\nseeks recovery of amounts in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n          7.        In addition to declaratory relief, Hughes seeks monetary relief of over $1,000,000.00.\n\nV.        Facts\n\n          8.        Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. was the uncle of Charles J. Hughes. Duwain Hughes lived\n\nin San Angelo and taught English for many years. Following Duwain Hughes’s death, The Will\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 2\n\n                                                            806\n\fof Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. (the “Will”) was probated in the County Court of Tom Green County,\n\nTexas, on April 6, 1965.\n\n          9.        Under the terms of the Will, Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. left his then new home, collection\n\nof rare books, and his music collection to the Tom Green County Library board, to establish an\n\nadjunct library in his name. Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. also left the residue of his estate to the Tom\n\nGreen County Library Board to pay down the mortgage on the home and for the upkeep and\n\nmaintenance of his home. At that time, this residual gift included a significant mineral estate that\n\nwas worth several million dollars.\n\n          10.       Inexplicably, instead of honoring Duwain E. Hughes, Jr.’s wishes and maintaining\n\nhis home as a library, the County chose to sell the home at a steep discount. This allowed the\n\nresiduary gift of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr.’s estate to arguably lapse to Southern Methodist University\n\n(“SMU”), which also received gift of specific mineral interests under the Will.\n\n          11.       On April 9, 1991, Southern Methodist University filed a lawsuit styled In re: The Will\n\nof Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. in the 51st Judicial District Court of Tom Green County under Cause No.\n\nCV91-0426-A (the “Underlying Suit”). In the Underlying Suit, SMU requested that the court\n\nrelease a restriction on the use of a gift made to it under the Will for the endowment of a Chair of\n\nEnglish for SMU, so that the excess value of that gift could otherwise be used to support and\n\nmaintain the English Department for SMU. At that time, the value of the mineral estate that SMU\n\nhad received exceeded the maximum amount necessary to endow a Chair for the Department of\n\nEnglish by approximately $4,000,000.\n\n          12.       On May 3, 1991, Tom Green County intervened in the Underlying Suit on behalf of\n\nthe Tom Green County Library, and sought a declaration that the residue of the gift to SMU\n\nbelonged to the County Library.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            807\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 3\n\f          13.       On March 30, 1993, Charles J. Hughes intervened and sought a declaration that\n\nbecause of the lapse in the gift of the residue to Tom Green County, the residue of the gift to SMU\n\nbelonged to Duwain E. Hughes, Jr.’s heirs-at-law – Charles J. Hughes, Carol Crews Carter, and Joan\n\nCrews Hoyt (the “Heirs-at-Law”).\n\n          14.       The Court ordered the parties to mediation of the SMU Lawsuit on May 26, 1994.\n\nPrior to mediation, Tom Green County and the Heirs-at-Law entered an agreement titled Mutual\n\nPartial Assignments (hereafter the “Agreement”), attached hereto as Exhibit A, by which the parties\n\nirrevocably assigned and divided the proceeds of any recovery in the lawsuit 50% to the Heirs-at-\n\nLaw, and 50% to Tom Green County. The signatories to the Agreement were authorized to sign\n\nby all required authorities.\n\n          15.       Specifically, under the terms of the Agreement Tom Green County promised to name\n\nits Central Tom Green County Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or Frances Hughes Crews,\n\n“if the commissioners consider the County’s ultimate recovery to be substantial enough for such\n\nrecognition.” Exhibit A, p. 4.\n\n          16.       The Tom Green County Commissioner’s Court authorized Timothy Weatherby, one\n\nof the Commissioners at the time, to serve as the County’s representative for the mediation. Exhibit\n\nB, Affidavit of Timothy Weatherby. Mr. Weatherby was fully aware that a settlement and\n\nsubstantial recovery from SMU would trigger the naming obligation under the Assignment\n\nAgreement. Id. Counsel for the County, Phil Lane, and the County Attorney, Tom Goff, also\n\nparticipated in the mediation. Pursuant to the Agreement, Hughes and the Heirs at Law aligned with\n\nthe County at mediation and joined forces against SMU. After the initial separate offers to the\n\nCounty and to the Heirs at Law, the County representatives and the Heirs at Law moved into the\n\nsame room and began negotiating for joint offers from SMU.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            808\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 4\n\f          17.       SMU offered to pay the Heirs-at-Law and Tom Green County $1,000,000 in\n\nsettlement for their claims. Id.\n\n          18.       At the time that the $1,000,000 settlement offer was made, and although he was\n\nalready delegated authority, Timothy Weatherby contacted the other County Commissioners, and\n\nthey all agreed that the County’s $500,000 share was “significant” (as it constituted the largest single\n\ncash donation the County had ever received), should be accepted, and warranted naming the Central\n\nTom Green County Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or Frances Hughes Crews, as set forth\n\nin the Agreement. Id.\n\n          19.       Because the Tom Green County representatives at the mediation stated that the\n\nCounty’s portion of SMU’s offer would be substantial enough to warrant naming the Central Library\n\nas contemplated in the Assignment Agreement, the Heirs-at-Law agreed to go along with Tom\n\nGreen County and accepted SMU’s offer. Id. Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement, the\n\nHeirs-at-Law and Tom Green County split those proceeds 50/50. Id.\n\n          20.       On July 6, 1994, Tom Green County Commissioner’s Court met in open session.\n\nDuring this session, the Commissioners considered the ultimate recovery in the lawsuit to be\n\nsubstantial enough and ratified the Agreement with Hughes and the Heirs at Law.\n\n          21.       After ratifying the Agreement and the separate agreement settling claims against\n\nSMU and dismissing the lawsuit, Tom Green County deposited the settlement proceeds it received\n\ninto a segregated bank account called the Hughes Library Fund. Exhibit B.\n\n          22.       Tom Green County used a part of the Hughes Library Fund to hire an architect to\n\nevaluate potential new locations for the central library, and also utilized a portion of the funds to hire\n\na grant consulting firm to assist the Library Board with grant applications. Id.\n\n          23.       The planning and preparation for the new library location was interrupted, however,\n\nwhen financial difficulties caused by bad investments and criminal cover ups by a previous County\n\n\n                                                            809\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 5\n\fTreasurer made it necessary to utilize a portion of the Hughes Library Fund to assist Tom Green\n\nCounty in meeting its financial shortfalls. Id.\n\n          24.       The Tom Green County Commissioners discussed the use of the Hughes Library\n\nFund to assist with the County’s financial burdens with Charles Hughes, who agreed to allow the\n\nfund to be used in such a manner, so long as the County fulfilled its obligation to name the new\n\nCentral Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or Frances Hughes Crews, whenever it was built.\n\nId. The County agreed to this stipulation. Id.\n\n          25.       Charles Hughes met and spoke with County Judge Mike Brown and Timothy\n\nWeatherby on a number of occasions to discuss the County’s plans regarding the naming of the\n\nCentral Library, and was repeatedly informed that the issue would be addressed when the location\n\nfor the new central library was chosen, and it was an appropriate occasion for giving it a name.\n\n          26.       The Tom Green County Central Library remained unnamed until March 1, 2011,\n\nwhen the Tom Green County Commissioners met to vote on naming portions of the new Tom Green\n\nCounty Central Library, which had just been constructed by remodeling the former Hemphill-Wells\n\nBuilding. Exhibit C, Excerpt of Minutes of County Commissioners Meeting. Notwithstanding the\n\nCounty’s agreement with Mr. Charles Hughes, and the donations made by his uncle Duwain E.\n\nHughes, Jr. —which had the County retained would have had a value of more than $12,000,000—\n\nthe County Commissioners read a pre-written \"motion\" and “voted” unanimously to name the library\n\nthe “Stephens Central Library,” in recognition of a recent $3,000,000 donation from Pollyanna and\n\nSteve Stephens. Id.\n\n        27.       In addition to a blank for the Commissioners to fill in with “Stephens Central Library,”\n\nthe pre-written motion provided that \"Tom Green County's ultimate recovery in [the Underlying\n\nLawsuit] is not substantial enough to name Tom Green County's main library in honor of Duwain\n\nE. Hughes Jr. [or] in honor of Frances Hughes Crews . . . .\" See Exhibit C (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                                            810\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 6\n\f        28.       On information and belief, the County Commissioners came to a final decision on this\n\nmatter and pre-drafted the accompanying motion in a private meeting prior to the public hearing - a\n\nmeeting at which neither Plaintiff nor any other members of the public were present. The pointed\n\nreference to the language of the Assignment Agreement clearly indicates the County Commissioners\n\nwere aware of the County’s prior obligation to the Hughes family, and entered the March 1, 2011\n\nhearing with a settled intent to disregard that obligation, regardless of the Commissioners Court’s\n\ndecision on July 6, 1994. Thus, the naming decision was a foregone conclusion, and the County's\n\npurported deliberations and \"vote\" at the hearing were simply a sham. The pre-written motion only\n\nannounced the County’s pre-determined decision, and was orchestrated to present an appearance of\n\ndue process and facial compliance with the Open Meetings Act.\n\nVI.     Causes of Action\n\n        29.       The foregoing facts are fully incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.\n\n        A.        Declaratory Judgment\n\n        30.       Section 551.102 of the Texas Open Meetings Act (the \"Act\") provides that \"[a] final\n\naction, decision, or vote on a matter deliberated in a closed meeting under this chapter may only be\n\nmade in an open meeting that is held in compliance with the notice provisions of this chapter.\"\n\n        31.       The March 1, 2011 motion was pre-determined and pre-written by the Commissioners\n\nprior to the public hearing. Upon information and belief, the official \"vote\" taken in open session was\n\nmerely an announcement of the actual decision, which was made by the Commissioners in private,\n\noutside of the open meeting. Neither Plaintiff nor any other member of the public received any notice\n\nof, or were given any opportunity to participate in, these private deliberations.\n\n        32.       Such actions constitute a direct violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act and the\n\nMarch 1, 2011 resolution should therefore be declared invalid and set aside. See TEX. GOV'T CODE\n\nANN. § 551.141 (\"An action taken by a governmental body in violation of this chapter is voidable\");\n\n\n                                                            811\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 7\n\fSee Lower Colorado River Auth. v. City of San Marcos, 523 S.W.2d 641, 646 (Tex. 1975)\n\n(recognizing the courts' inherent authority to invalidate and set aside government decisions made in\n\nviolation of the Act).\n\n        33.       Violations of the Texas Open Meetings Act may be addressed through a number of\n\nremedies available under the Act and separate statutory authorities. One such remedy is found in\n\nSection 551.142 of the Act, which allows any \"interested person\" to \"bring an action by mandamus\n\nor injunction to stop, prevent, or reverse a violation or threatened violation of this chapter by\n\nmembers of a governmental body.\" In lieu of a writ of mandamus or injunction, an \"interested\n\nperson\" authorized under Section 551.142 may also seek a declaratory judgment to invalidate the\n\nunlawful act under Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. See Bd. of Trs. v. Cox\n\nEnters., Inc., 679 S.W.2d 86, 88 (Tex. App. - Texarkana 1984) (recognizing declaratory judgment\n\naction as an additional option to challenge violations of the Act); see also TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 37.003 (authorizing a court to declare the \"rights, duties, and other legal relations\" of\n\ncitizens and public officials).\n\n        B.        Breach of Settlement Agreement\n\n        34.       The Agreement constituted a valid and enforceable settlement agreement between\n\nTom Green County and the Heirs-at-Law, including Charles Hughes.\n\n        35.       Tom Green County waived sovereign immunity with respect to those claims by\n\nintervening in the Underlying Lawsuit filed by SMU.\n\n        36.       Tom Green County accepted the proceeds from the settlement reached with SMU and\n\nthe Heirs-at-Law, including Charles Hughes, thus Charles Hughes and the other Heirs-at-Law fully\n\nperformed their obligations under the settlement agreement. Further, on July 6, 1994, Tom Green\n\nCounty ratified the Agreements.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            812\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 8\n\f         37.      Tom Green County, however, has materially breached the Agreement by failing and\n\nrefusing to name the Tom Green County Central Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or\n\nFrances Hughes Crews. At the time of the County’s breach on March 1, 2011, the value of the\n\nnaming obligation was $3,000,000.00. As a result of the County’s breach, Hughes suffered damages\n\nin the amount of the lost value of the naming obligation – $3,000,000.00.\n\n         38.      Further, and in the alternative, because Tom Green County has materially breached\n\nthe agreement, it is liable for the $500,000 in settlement proceeds it received, plus pre-judgment and\n\npost judgment interest.\n\n         C.       Action for Money Had and Received\n\n         39.      Tom Green County accepted the benefits of the Assignment Agreement, and the\n\nsubsequent settlement reached with SMU and the Heirs-at-Law. By accepting those benefits, Tom\n\nGreen County enjoyed the savings of significantly limiting the scope and risk associated with the\n\nUnderlying Lawsuit as it approached mediation, and then benefitted from its use of the $500,000 in\n\nsettlement proceeds for many years.\n\n         40.      Tom Green County received this benefit on the basis of false promises that it would\n\nname the Tom Green County Central Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or Frances Hughes\n\nCrews.\n\n         41.      Tom Green County has failed and refused to do equity, by returning the $500,000 it\n\nhas unjustly received, in exchange for its promise to name the Central Library.\n\n         42.      Tom Green County has instead named the Central Library the “Stephens Central\n\nLibrary,” and continues to retain, or has otherwise appropriated the $500,000 it received and that in\n\nequity, justice, or in law belongs to Hughes.\n\n         43.      Therefore, Tom Green County is obligated to return the $500,000 to the Charles\n\nHughes as is equitable and just.\n\n\n                                                            813\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 9\n\fVII.     Conditions Precedent\n\n         44.       All conditions precedent to the relief sought by Charles Hughes have been fulfilled\n\nor have occurred.\n\nVIII. Attorney’s Fees\n\n         45.       Charles Hughes seeks reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees for Tom Green\n\nCounty’s breach of contract pursuant to Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code Section 38.001(8)\n\nand seeks such attorneys’ fees as are equitable and just pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code Section 37.009.\n\nIX.      Damages\n\n         46.        As a result of Tom Green County’s breach of the Agreement, Hughes suffered the loss\n\nof the value of the naming obligation, which at the time of the County’s breach was valued at\n\n$3,000,000.00.\n\n         47.       Alternatively, as a result of Tom Green County’s breach of the Agreement, Hughes\n\nsuffered the loss of his share of $500,000 by his reliance on the County’s Agreement.\n\n         48.       Further, and in the alternative, Tom Green County was unjustly enriched in the amount\n\nof $500,000.00 in funds that it received and that amount should be returned to Hughes.\n\nIX.      Prayer\n\n         Wherefore, Plaintiff Charles J. Hughes respectfully requests that upon trial of this matter the\n\nCourt enter judgment for Hughes against Tom Green County, invalidate and set aside the March 1,\n\n2011 Resolution made in violation of the Texas Opening Meetings Act, order the County to pay\n\nCharles J. Hughes the amount of damages sought herein, plus pre-judgment interest, costs, attorney\n\nfees, post judgment interest, and grant Charles J. Hughes such other and further relief, at law or in\n\nequity, to which he is justly entitled.\n\n\n                                                             814\n Plaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 10\n\f                                                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                          DAVIS, GERALD & CREMER\n                                                          A Professional Corporation\n                                                          400 W.

Hughes sued Appellee Tom Green County alleging breach of a\n\n1994 agreement, the Mutual Partial Assignments [Appendix2]. Hughes\n\ncomplains that the County breached the Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA)\n\nby failing to name the County’s library in honor of Hughes’ family. He seeks\n\ndamages in the amount of at least $3,000,000 plus attorney's fees.\n\n[Appendix3]\n\n      The MPA was executed during the course of prior litigation (the SMU\n\nlitigation). Defendant's Exhibit 1 (CR3:4) contains a copy of every pleading\n\nand any other document filed in the SMU litigation. (RR2:10)\n\n      Because this is an appeal from the grant of a plea to the jurisdiction, the\n\ninitial focus is on the facts pleaded by Hughes. His pleading is attached as\n\nAppendix3. Hughes pleads:\n\n      *that the will of Hughes’ late uncle devised the residuary of the\n\n      uncle’s estate to the County.\n\n      *that in 1994 SMU filed suit seeking release of the will’s\n\n      restrictions on the use of a gift made to it by the uncle’s will.\n\n                                        7\n\f       *that the County intervened in the SMU litigation and sought a\n\n       declaration that the residue of such gift to SMU (the amount not\n\n       needed to satisfy the purpose of the gift) belonged to the County.\n\n       *that Hughes and others (the Hughes group) thereafter intervened\n\n       in the SMU litigation and sought a declaration that the residuary\n\n       gift to the County had lapsed and that, as a consequence, the\n\n       residue of the gift to SMU belonged to the uncle’s heirs.1\n\n       *that the SMU litigation court ordered the parties to mediation.\n\n       Prior to mediation, the MPA was executed.2 Hughes pleads that the\n\nsignatories to the MPA were authorized to sign by all required authorities.\n\n(CR:808) SMU was not a party to the MPA.\n\n       By the MPA, the Hughes group assigned to the County \"50% of the net\n\nproceeds they actually receive from [the SMU litigation].\" Likewise, the\n\n\n       1\n         Hughes was one of at least three heirs participating in the SMU litigation. In the current\nlitigation, Hughes is the lone plaintiff. Thus, for the sake of simplicity the argument will in some\nrespects ignore other heirs.\n       2\n        Hughes’ brief asserts that the MPA was signed at mediation. (Brief:3) Although the\ntiming does not seem to have any significance, the record does not support the brief’s assertion.\nThe MPA is not dated. However, Hughes pleads, “Prior to mediation, Tom Green County and the\nHeirs-at-Law entered an agreement titled Mutual Partial Assignments . . . .” (CR:808) Hughes\nacknowledges that the MPA was signed before the other agreements. (Brief:14-15)\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fCounty thereby assigned to the Hughes group \"50% of the net proceeds it\n\nactually receives from [the SMU litigation].\" Similarly, the MPA provides\n\nthat “[t]hese mutual assignments are irrevocable and are intended to be a\n\nmutual exchange of 50% of the respective interests of the parties hereto in\n\nany recovery under said cause against SMU and any other adverse parties\n\nwho may be joined in the cause by mutual agreement of the parties hereto.”\n\n      The MPA expressly disavows any intent to extinguish claims. It\n\nprovides in relevant part: \"[T]his document is in no way intended to eliminate\n\nor reduce in any fashion the cause of action, claims, or rights held by the\n\nheirs-at-law or the County.\" (emphasis added).\n\n      The MPA also includes the following: \"In further consideration of this\n\nmatter, the County agrees to name the main county library, in honor of\n\nDuwain E. Hughes, Jr., and/or Frances Crews Hughes, if the commissioners\n\nconsider the County's ultimate recovery in the cause to be substantial enough\n\nfor such recognition.\" Duwain and Frances Hughes are herein referenced as\n\n“the Hughes family.”\n\n      Thereafter, during mediation, the parties executed a document\n\ncaptioned Settlement Agreement. [Appendix4] The Settlement Agreement\n\n                                       9\n\fprovided: that SMU would pay $1,000,000 to the County and the other\n\nparties to the suit (excepting one party); that SMU would obtain appropriate\n\nrelief as to the uncle’s will; and that all parties would dismiss their claims\n\nwith prejudice.\n\n      Thereafter, the parties executed a document captioned Compromise and\n\nSettlement and Release of All Claims (the Compromise Agreement).\n\n(CR:671) The Compromise Agreement [Appendix5] provides that the\n\nSettlement Agreement is “further reduced to writing in this agreement.”\n\n      The County disputes Hughes’ assertion that the Compromise\n\nAgreement “does not provide for any releases between the County and the\n\nHughes heirs.” (Brief:4) The Compromise Agreement summarizes the claims\n\nasserted by SMU, the County, and the Hughes group and provides that by the\n\nSettlement Agreement the parties agreed to a “complete and final\n\ncompromise and settlement of such suit and all of such disputes.” Similarly,\n\nthe trial court signed a Final Judgment [Appendix6] which recites that “all\n\nmatters in controversy between the parties which is the subject matter of this\n\nsuit have been fully and finally agreed to and settled.”\n\n      The Settlement Agreement, the Compromise Agreement, and the Final\n\n                                        10\n\fJudgment make no mention of the MPA. Hughes pleads that the County and\n\nthe Hughes group evenly split (50-50) the $1,000,000 paid by SMU.\n\n(CR:809)\n\n      Hughes pleads that he accepted the SMU settlement during mediation\n\nbecause the County’s representatives had stated that “the County’s portion of\n\nthe SMU’s offer would be substantial enough to warrant naming the Central\n\nLibrary as contemplated in the [MPA].”\n\n      Hughes further pleads that the County’s commissioners court met in\n\nopen session on July 9, 1994 and “considered the ultimate recovery in the\n\nlawsuit to be substantial enough and ratified the [MPA].” (CR:809) He also\n\npleads that the commissioners court ratified “the separate agreement settling\n\nclaims against SMU and dismissing the lawsuit.” (CR:809)\n\n      Hughes pleads that the County’s commissioners court met on March 1,\n\n2011 and passed a resolution which named the library the “Stephens Central\n\nLibrary” and which expressly provided that the County’s recovery in the\n\nSMU litigation is not substantial enough to name the library in honor of the\n\nHughes family. (CR:610)\n\n      Hughes sued the County, asserting three causes of action: (1) breach of\n\n                                      11\n\fthe MPA (by failing to name the library in honor of Hughes' family)\n\n(CR:812); (2) an equitable claim captioned \"money had and received,\"\n\nalleging that the County accepted the benefits of the MPA and unjustly\n\nretains the SMU settlement funds (CR:813); and (3) a declaratory judgment\n\naction asserting a violation of the Open Meetings Act and seeking to have the\n\nMarch 11, 2011 resolution naming the library declared void and\n\nunenforceable (CR:811).\n\n      The trial court granted the County’s plea to the jurisdiction and\n\ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the claims arising out of or\n\npertaining to the MPA. (CR:833)\n\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\f                    SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      Appellant Hughes sued the County seeking damages for breach of the\n\nlibrary naming provision set out in the Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA).\n\nHughes and the County executed the MPA during the course of prior\n\nlitigation, being the SMU litigation.\n\n      There is a dispute over performance of the library naming provision.\n\nThe MPA provides that the County will name the County’s library in honor\n\nof the Hughes family - if the County’s commissioners determine that the\n\nCounty’s recovery in prior litigation, the SMU litigation, is substantial\n\nenough to name the library in honor of the Hughes family. The County\n\ncontends that even had the 1994 commissioners court determined that the\n\nrecovery was substantial enough to name the library for the Hughes family\n\n(disputed), the 2011 commissioners court nevertheless had discretion to make\n\nits own determination (a contrary determination) when it named the new\n\nlibrary in honor of the Stephens family.\n\n      In an effort to avoid the expense of trial, the County pleaded\n\ngovernmental immunity. The trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction\n\nand dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the claims arising out of\n\n                                        13\n\for pertaining to the MPA.\n\n       Hughes argues that he pleaded two grounds for waiver of immunity\n\nfrom suit: waiver of immunity for breach of a settlement agreement under\n\napplication of the Lawson case and waiver of immunity by conduct.\n\n       Hughes failed to demonstrate that immunity was waived under\n\napplication of the Lawson case. In Lawson, a Supreme Court plurality\n\nopined: “[W]hen a governmental entity is exposed to suit because of a waiver\n\nof immunity, it cannot nullify that waiver by settling the claim with an\n\nagreement on which it cannot be sued.”\n\n       Thus, the Lawson rule provides that immunity is waived on a breach of\n\ncontract claim if three elements are satisfied:\n\n1- a claim was asserted against the governmental entity;\n\n2- the entity was thereby exposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity;\n\nand,\n\n3-the claim was settled by the agreement made the basis of suit.\n\n       Hughes argues that the County was “exposed to suit” (County lacked\n\nimmunity) in the SMU litigation because it voluntarily intervened in the\n\nSMU litigation. Hughes would thereby invoke the Reata case’s voluntary\n\n                                       14\n\flitigation exception to immunity.\n\n      However, in A. I. Divestitures this Court recognized that the judicially\n\npromulgated Reata immunity exception has no application to Lawson\n\nimmunity waiver. The Lawson waiver rule applies only to agreements which\n\nsettle claims as to which immunity has been statutorily waived.\n\n      In any event, the record does not support an application of Reata -\n\nbecause the County sought no damages in the SMU litigation. Likewise,\n\nReata has no application because vis-a-vis Hughes the County’s claims were\n\nmerely defensive. Hughes intervened after the County intervened.\n\n      Additionally, the Lawson immunity waiver can have no application\n\nbecause the MPA did not settle any claim - much less a claim asserted by\n\nHughes against the County. In the SMU litigation Hughes asserted no claim\n\nagainst the County.\n\n      Additionally, even if Reata's judicially implemented limitation on the\n\ncontours of immunity were engrafted onto the Lawson waiver rule, and even\n\nif Lawson otherwise had application, then logic and equity weigh in favor of\n\nlikewise engrafting and applying Reata's limited scope of jurisdiction. If the\n\nCounty's voluntary intervention in the SMU litigation, or its conduct,\n\n                                      15\n\ftriggered a waiver of immunity (disputed), then the trial court did not\n\nthereby acquire jurisdiction over Hughes' claim for monetary relief against\n\nthe County in excess of an amount sufficient to offset the County's recovery\n\n(if any). Alternatively, the 2002 Lawson plurality’s immunity waiver should\n\nnot be applied to a contract signed in 1994.\n\n      Hughes failed to demonstrate that the County waived immunity by its\n\nconduct. Hughes relies on alleged representations which as a matter of law\n\ncannot be considered.\n\n      Even if such allegations could be considered, this court has repeatedly\n\ndeclined to apply a waiver by conduct exception to immunity. Even if the\n\nwaiver by conduct theory were viable, the facts pleaded by Hughes do not\n\nsupport an equitable waiver of immunity.\n\n      The County is not alleged to have made any representations to Hughes\n\nconcerning immunity. Hughes may have presumed that the County was\n\nobligated to name the new library in honor of his family. However, a\n\nmisunderstanding of the law does not justify an equitable waiver of\n\nimmunity.\n\n      Here, the County asserts immunity in an effort to avoid the expense of\n\n                                      16\n\ftrial. The pleaded facts do not demonstrate that the County made promises\n\nwhich it intended to break.\n\n      Here, there is a good-faith dispute over performance of the library\n\nnaming provision: whether the 1994 commissioners court found that the\n\nSMU litigation recovery was substantial enough to name the library in honor\n\nof Hughes' family (disputed); and, even if it had, whether in the course of\n\nnaming the new library the 2011 commissioners court is somehow precluded\n\nfrom making its own determination (a contrary determination).\n\n      There is no showing that Hughes exercised his statutory remedy:\n\nseeking legislative authority to sue the County. For that additional reason,\n\nthere is no basis for an equitable waiver of the County’s governmental\n\nimmunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f                               ARGUMENT\n\n                                Background\n\n     There is a dispute over performance of the library naming provision set\n\nout in the Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA). The County denies that the\n\n1994 commissioners court determined that the SMU litigation recovery was\n\nsubstantial enough to name the library in honor of Hughes’ family. (CR:616)\n\nEven if the 1994 commissioners court had made such a determination, the\n\n2011 commissioners court was not thereby precluded from making its own\n\ndetermination (a contrary determination) when naming the new library.\n\n     In this regard, the issue is not whether the SMU litigation recovery was\n\nsubstantial enough to name the library in honor the Hughes’ family. The\n\nissue is whether the County’s commissioners court considers the recovery\n\nsubstantial enough to name the library for the Hughes family. The contract\n\nwhich Hughes claims to have been breached, the MPA [Appendix2],\n\nprovides that “the County agrees to name the main county library, in honor of\n\nDuwain E. Hughes, Jr., and/or Frances Crews Hughes, if the commissioners\n\nconsider the County's ultimate recovery in the cause to be substantial enough\n\nfor such recognition.\" (emphasis added).\n\n                                     18\n\f      The County contends that the 2011 commissioners court had authority\n\nto determine the issue of whether the recovery was substantial enough to\n\nname the library in honor of Hughes' family.

(Brief:3)\n\n     This section will address the first issue (Lawson): waiver of immunity\n\nfor breach of a settlement agreement. Following that, the County will address\n\nwaiver by conduct.\n\n     Hughes relies on an immunity waiver theory applied by a plurality of\n\nthe Supreme Court in Texas A&M University-Kingsville v.

In Lawson, the state university entered into an\n\nagreement which settled Mr. Lawson’s Whistleblower claim - being a claim\n\n\n                                     32\n\fas to which immunity had been statutorily waived. Mr. Lawson brought suit\n\nfor breach of the agreement.\n\n      Four judges (a plurality) concluded that the breach of contract claim\n\nwas not barred by immunity, ruling that the university had waived immunity\n\nby entering into the settlement agreement. The Lawson plurality opined:\n\n“[W]hen a governmental entity is exposed to suit because of a waiver of\n\nimmunity, it cannot nullify that waiver by settling the claim with an\n\nagreement on which it cannot be sued.” Lawson, 87 S.W.3d at 521.\n\n      Hughes contends that the Mutual Partial Assignments (the source of the\n\nlibrary naming provision) settled a claim as to which immunity from suit had\n\nbeen waived. In this regard, he argues that the County lost its immunity from\n\nsuit by voluntarily intervening in the SMU litigation (the Reata exception to\n\nimmunity). Hughes further contends that, under application of Lawson,\n\nimmunity from suit is as a consequence waived on his suit for breach of the\n\nMutual Partial Assignments (failure to name the library in honor of the\n\nHughes family).\n\n      The Lawson plurality’s theory of immunity waiver (Lawson waiver) is\n\nnot binding authority and should not be adopted. Even if adopted, the Court\n\n                                      33\n\fcan determine the scope of the Lawson waiver.\n\n      Even if the Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA) settled a claim on\n\nwhich immunity did not apply (disputed), the nature of the claim settled by\n\nthe MPA is not the sort of claim which falls within the scope of Lawson\n\nwaiver (Lawson waiver applying to claims as to which immunity has been\n\nstatutorily waived).\n\n      Even if otherwise applicable, the scope of Lawson waiver should be\n\nlimited to allow suit for an offset (against any monetary recovery obtained by\n\nthe County) because that is the scope of the immunity exception applicable to\n\nHughes’ voluntary intervention theory (being the Reata exception to\n\nimmunity). Alternatively Lawson should not be applied to a contract\n\nexecuted in 1994.\n\n      Immunity is the default position (it is presumed).

Unless\n      waived, the State retains its immunity from suit on a contract,\n      whether the contract is for goods and services or a settlement\n      agreement. We have repeatedly held that sovereign immunity in\n      ordinary contract claims is an area best left to legislative\n      judgment. See York, 871 S.W.2d at 177 (“[T]he waiver of\n      governmental immunity is a matter addressed to the\n      Legislature.”). Deference to the Legislature to determine\n      sovereign immunity in ordinary breach-of-contract cases\n      claiming waiver by conduct is founded on sound policy.

Yet today the plurality overrides those compelling\n      reasons and concludes that although the Legislature has not\n      chosen to waive sovereign immunity for this breach-of-contract\n      claim, the University simply “may not” claim immunity in this\n      case.\n\nLawson, 87 S.W.3d at 525-26 (Rodriguez, J., dissent).\n\n      In this regard, the question is not whether the Lawson exception\n\n                                      36\n\fadvances equitable or otherwise beneficial policy.

Nevertheless,\n      the plurality sidesteps recent precedent concerning sovereign\n      immunity in breach-of-contract suits, wholly ignores established\n      law that a suit for breach of a settlement agreement is\n      independent of the settled claim, and erroneously concludes that\n      the University may not assert immunity.\n\n                                     ***\n\n             [T]he issue here is whether the State may assert sovereign\n      immunity in an ordinary breach-of-contract case, and the answer\n      to that question is decidedly “yes.” Lawson asserted a\n      breach-of-contract claim against the University, and the State has\n      sovereign immunity on that claim. When Lawson settled, he\n      traded in his wrongful termination claims for a settlement\n      contract, and, in addition to accepting $62,000, he accepted the\n\n                                      37\n\f      risk that the State could assert immunity if it breached the\n      contract, just as all people who contract with the State accept that\n      risk. Although such a risk might discourage some parties from\n      contracting with the State, that risk has not daunted the Court\n      before.

Moreover, those who settle\n      for cash and receive payment before dismissing their suit take no\n      risk that the State will assert immunity. Thus, contrary to the\n      plurality's fears, only a handful of settlements in which the\n      private party insists on executory provisions rather than only a\n      cash settlement would be discouraged.\n\nLawson, 87 S.W.3d at 524-25 (Rodriguez, J., dissent).\n\n                       Reata Limitation on Immunity\n                  Has No Application to Lawson Exception\n\n      Even if the Lawson rationale is adopted, this Court can determine the\n\nscope of the Lawson waiver. In order to apply Lawson waiver to Hughes’\n\nclaim, the Court would need to expand the waiver beyond the narrow scope\n\nto which it was applied by the Lawson plurality.\n\n      The Lawson plurality opined: “[W]hen a governmental entity is\n\nexposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity, it cannot nullify that waiver\n\nby settling the claim with an agreement on which it cannot be sued.” Lawson,\n\n87 S.W.3d at 521 (plurality).\n\n      Thus, the Lawson rule provides that immunity is waived on a breach of\n\n\n                                       38\n\fcontract claim if three elements are satisfied:\n\n1- a claim was asserted against the governmental entity;\n\n2- the entity was thereby exposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity;\n\nand,\n\n3-the claim was settled by the agreement made the basis of suit.\n\n       Even assuming that Hughes met the other two elements (disputed),\n\nHughes has not demonstrated that in the SMU litigation the County was\n\nexposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity. Here, in an effort to\n\nestablish that immunity was waived on a claim allegedly settled by the MPA,\n\nHughes relies on Reata’s judicially created voluntary litigation exception to\n\nimmunity.\n\n       However, this Court has declined to extend the Lawson waiver in the\n\nmanner advocated by Hughes.

Instead, the voluntary\n\nlitigation theory gives rise to a limited judicial exception to immunity and, as\n\nsuch, will not support application of a Lawson waiver.\n\n      Hughes argues that the County “voluntarily intervened in the SMU\n\nlitigation and had no grounds for asserting sovereign immunity as to Hughes’\n\nclaim in the SMU Litigation.” (Brief:8,10,14). He provides neither argument\n\nnor authority. (CR:806).\n\n      However, voluntary litigation gives rise to a very limited exception to\n\nimmunity. See Employees Ret. Sys. of Texas v.

In Putnam, this Court observed:\n\n      In Reata, the court held that when a governmental entity files a\n      lawsuit or otherwise seeks affirmative relief, it waives immunity\n      for connected, germane, and properly defensive counterclaims,\n      but only to the extent those counterclaims offset the claims of the\n      government entity. 197 S.W.3d at 377 (“Absent the Legislature's\n      waiver of the City's immunity from suit, ... the trial court did not\n      acquire jurisdiction over a claim for damages against the City in\n      excess of damages sufficient to offset the City's recovery, if\n      any.”).\n\nPutnam, 294 S.W.3d at 324-25.\n\n      Technically, the Reata rule is not a rule of waiver - it is a judicially\n\nimplemented limitation on the contours of immunity (the extent to which\n\nimmunity will be applied). This distinction is illustrated by the following:\n\n            Although litigation actions of governmental entities\n      underlay our decisions in Reata and similar cases, we did not\n      hold that those actions effected waivers of immunity; rather, they\n      were factors we considered in defining the contours of immunity.\n      In other words, we have not, in Reata or other decisions, altered\n      the principles that (1) the boundaries of sovereign immunity are\n      determined by the judiciary, and (2) waivers of sovereign\n      immunity or consent to sue governmental entities must generally\n      be found in actions of the Legislature.\n\nCity of Dallas v.

[Appendix3] If the County’s voluntary intervention in the\n\nSMU litigation, or its conduct, triggered a waiver of immunity (disputed),\n\nthen the trial court did not thereby acquire jurisdiction over Hughes’ claim\n\nfor monetary relief against the County in excess of an amount sufficient to\n\noffset the County’s recovery (if any).\n\n                 Alternatively Lawson Should Not Be Applied\n                       To A Contract Executed in 1994\n\n      If it should be determined that Reata's judicially implemented\n\nlimitation on the contours of immunity (jurisdiction limited to an offset) is\n\ninapplicable, then it would be contrary to public policy to apply the Lawson\n\nwaiver rule to the MPA. See Putnam, 294 S.W.3d at 325 (although Texas\n\nSupreme Court decisions usually apply retrospectively, exceptions may be\n\nrecognized when considerations of fairness and policy dictate prospective\n\neffect only).\n\n\n                                         50\n\f        The contract herein made the subject of suit, the MPA, was executed in\n\n1994. The Lawson rule was not announced until 2002 and even then it was\n\nsupported only by a plurality. The rule is yet to be applied by a majority of\n\nthe Supreme Court.\n\n        The Lawson plurality supported its immunity waiver by entertaining a\n\npresumption that a governmental entity calculates risk when entering into a\n\nsettlement agreement. The plurality observed that the governmental entity\n\ntrades unknowns for knowns, “being obligations that are more accurately\n\nassessable.” Lawson, 87 S.W.3d at 522 ) (plurality). However, here, it cannot\n\nbe said that the risk (a Lawson immunity waiver) was known to the County in\n\n1994.\n\n                  Record Does Not Support A Lawson Waiver\n\n        As was demonstrated, the Lawson rule provides that immunity is\n\nwaived on a breach of contract claim if three elements are satisfied:\n\n1- a claim was asserted against the governmental entity;\n\n2- the entity was thereby exposed to suit because of a waiver of immunity;\n\nand,\n\n3-the claim was settled by the agreement made the basis of suit.\n\n                                       51\n\f      Hughes argues that the County lost its immunity on SMU litigation\n\nclaims by voluntarily intervening in the SMU litigation (being the Reata\n\nimmunity exception). Hughes reasons that the Mutual Partial Assignments\n\n(the source of the library naming provision) as a consequence settled a claim\n\nas to which the County had no immunity (the Lawson immunity waiver).\n\n      However, even if this co-mingling of theories (Reata and Lawson) had\n\nmerit, the pleaded facts do not fit the theories. The County’s intervention in\n\nthe SMU litigation did not implicate the Reata immunity exception. Even if it\n\nhad, Lawson waiver would not be implicated because: (1) Hughes asserted no\n\nclaim against the County (as contrasted with a claim against SMU); and, (2)\n\nthe Mutual Partial Assignments (MPA) did not settle a claim.\n\n      The record does not implicate the Reata immunity exception. The\n\nCounty’s intervention in the SMU litigation did not implicate the Reata\n\nimmunity exception (being the second Lawson element - “exposed to suit\n\nbecause of waiver”).\n\n      The Reata exception has application only if the governmental entity\n\nasserts a claim for damages. The Reata court held: \"Once it asserts\n\naffirmative claims for monetary recovery, the City must participate in the\n\n                                       52\n\flitigation process as an ordinary litigant, save for the limitation that the City\n\ncontinues to have immunity from affirmative damage claims against it for\n\nmonetary relief exceeding amounts necessary to offset the City's claims.\"\n\nReata, 197 S.W.3d at 377.\n\n         In contrast, a governmental entity's affirmative claim for declaratory\n\nrelief does not have any effect on the entity's immunity.

(CR:807) Hughes thereby negated the claimed waiver of\n\nimmunity. The County’s intervention did not waive the County’s immunity\n\nas to claims asserted against the County by Hughes (if any).\n\n         Additionally, the County’s intervention in the SMU litigation did not\n\nimplicate the Reata immunity exception because, as between the County and\n\nHughes, the County's SMU litigation claim was defensive. The Reata goal is\n\nto provide the party sued an opportunity to assert defensive claims. See\n\nReata, 197 S.W.3d at 374 (where a state voluntarily files a suit and submits\n\nits rights for judicial determination, the defense will be entitled to plead and\n\n                                         53\n\fprove all matters properly defensive). The Reata court held that “it would be\n\nfundamentally unfair to allow a governmental entity to assert affirmative\n\nclaims against a party while claiming it had immunity as to the party's claims\n\nagainst it.” Reata, 197 S.W.3d at 375-76 (emphasis added).\n\n      Here however, as between the County and Hughes, in the SMU\n\nlitigation it was the County which stood in the defendant’s shoes. In this\n\nregard, the County did not initiate litigation with Hughes. The County sued\n\nSMU (by intervening in the pending suit).\n\n      If the County is deemed to have asserted a claim against Hughes\n\n(disputed), the claim is defensive in nature and as such would not trigger the\n\nReata exception to immunity.

As between the County and Hughes it was Hughes who\n\nstood in the plaintiff’s shoes and, consequently, Hughes cannot invoke the\n\n                                      54\n\fbenefit of a voluntary litigation doctrine which is designed to afford fairness\n\nto a defendant.\n\n      The record does not implicate the Lawson immunity waiver. Even if\n\nHughes had satisfied the second Lawson element (exposed to suit because of\n\nwaiver), under the facts pleaded the Lawson immunity exception would not\n\nbe implicated because Hughes failed to satisfy the first and third elements.\n\nElement One: In the SMU litigation Hughes asserted no claim against the\n\nCounty (as contrasted with a claim against SMU) and thus had no claim\n\nagainst the County that could be deemed settled by the Mutual Partial\n\nAssignments (MPA). Element Three: the MPA did not settle a claim - it was\n\nthe post-MPA agreement and judgment which settled claims.\n\n      The trial court found that the MPA is a “mutual settlement agreement.”\n\n(CR:833) The meaning and intent of this finding is not clear. The trial court\n\nerred as a matter of law if it thereby determined that the MPA settled a claim\n\nasserted by Hughes against the County - the record conclusively negates such\n\na conclusion. The fact that the trial court granted the plea to the jurisdiction\n\nimplies that the court did not assign such a construction to the MPA.\n\n      In the SMU litigation Hughes asserted no claim against the County (as\n\n                                        55\n\fcontrasted with a claim against SMU) and thus had no claim against the\n\nCounty that could be deemed settled by the MPA. In such litigation, Hughes\n\nand the County each sought to establish ownership of assets which were\n\nbeing enjoyed by SMU. Neither Hughes nor the County therein asserted a\n\nclaim against the other.\n\n      In this regard, Hughes pleads that the County sought “a declaration that\n\nthe residue of the gift to SMU belonged to the County Library.” (CR:807)\n\nHughes pleads that Hughes sought “a declaration that because of the lapse in\n\nthe gift of the residue to Tom Green County, the residue of the gift to SMU\n\nbelonged to [the uncle’s] heirs at law [the Hughes group].” (CR:808 -\n\nemphasis added) Although the relief sought by Hughes and the County\n\nconflicted in the sense that relief for one precluded relief for the other, the\n\nclaims were asserted against SMU.\n\n      Additionally, the MPA did not settle a claim. It was the post-MPA\n\nagreements and judgment which settled claims. The MPA merely altered the\n\nownership structure of the claims asserted by Hughes and the County against\n\nSMU.\n\n      By the MPA, the Hughes group assigned to the County \"50% of the net\n\n                                        56\n\fproceeds they actually receive from [the SMU litigation].\" (CR:662-663)\n\nLikewise, by the MPA the County assigned to the Hughes group \"50% of the\n\nnet proceeds it actually receives from [the SMU litigation].\"(CR:662-663)\n\nSimilarly, the MPA provides that “[t]hese mutual assignments are irrevocable\n\nand are intended to be a mutual exchange of 50% of the respective interests\n\nof the parties hereto in any recovery under said cause against SMU and any\n\nother adverse parties who may be joined in the cause by mutual agreement of\n\nthe parties hereto.” (CR:664)\n\n      In this manner, the MPA merely transfers an interest in net proceeds.\n\nThe MPA expressly disavows any intent to extinguish claims, providing in\n\nrelevant part as follows: \"[T]his document is in no way intended to eliminate\n\nor reduce in any fashion the cause of action, claims, or rights held by the\n\nheirs-at-law or the County.\" [Appendix2] (emphasis added).\n\n      Hughes reasons that any claim asserted by Hughes against the County\n\nin the SMU litigation would still be viable if the MPA did not settle that\n\nclaim. However, as noted, Hughes did not assert a claim against the County.\n\n      In any event, the post-MPA agreements and judgment (not the MPA)\n\nsettled claims. The County disputes Hughes’ assertion that one of these post-\n\n                                       57\n\fMPA agreements, the Compromise Agreement [Appendix 5], “does not\n\nprovide for any releases between the County and the Hughes heirs.” (Brief:4)\n\n      The SMU litigation claims were settled by the Settlement Agreement,\n\nthe Compromise Agreement, and the Final Judgment. The Compromise\n\nAgreement [Appendix 5] summarizes the claims asserted by SMU, the\n\nCounty, and the Hughes group and provides that by the Settlement\n\nAgreement [Appendix 4] (another post-MPA agreement) the parties agreed to\n\na “complete and final compromise and settlement of such suit and all of such\n\ndisputes.” Similarly, the trial court signed a Final Judgment [Appendix 6]\n\nwhich recites that “all matters in controversy between the parties which is the\n\nsubject matter of this suit have been fully and finally agreed to and settled.”\n\n\n\n\n                                       58\n\f             Waiver of Governmental Immunity - By Conduct\n\n      Hughes observes that he pleaded two grounds for waiver of immunity\n\nfrom suit: (1) waiver of immunity for breach of a settlement agreement under\n\napplication of the Lawson case and (2) waiver of immunity by conduct.\n\n(Brief:7) He argues: “The issue facing this Court is whether the County\n\nwaived immunity from suit for its breach of the Agreement – either by\n\nbreaching a settlement agreement under Lawson or by its conduct in\n\nbreaching the Agreement.” (Brief: 8) By “Agreement,” he refers to the\n\nMutual Partial Assignments (MPA) which contains the library naming\n\nprovision. (Brief:3)\n\n      This section will address the second issue: waiver of immunity by\n\nconduct. This ground for waiver of immunity has special relevance to\n\nHughes’ equitable claim captioned \"money had and received,\" alleging that\n\nthe County accepted the benefits of the MPA and unjustly retained SMU’s\n\nsettlement payment. (CR:813)\n\n      Hughes’ pleadings do not support a waiver of immunity by conduct.\n\nHughes pleads: “Tom Green County has waived sovereign immunity from\n\nsuit as a result of its conduct in entering into and then breaching the Mutual\n\n                                       59\n\fPartial Assignments between Hughes and the County.” (CR:806)\n\n      Hughes pleads the following facts in support of waiver by conduct\n\nexception to immunity:\n\n      18. At the time that the $1,000,000 settlement offer was made,\n      and although he was already delegated authority, Timothy\n      Weatherby contacted the other County Commissioners, and they\n      all agreed that the County's $500,000 share was \"significant\" (as\n      it constituted the largest single cash donation the County had ever\n      received), should be accepted, and warranted naming the Central\n      Tom Green County Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or\n      Frances Hughes Crews, as set forth in the Agreement. Id.\n\n      19. Because the Tom Green County representatives at the\n      mediation stated that the County's portion of SMU's offer would\n      be substantial enough to warrant naming the Central Library as\n      contemplated in the Assignment Agreement, the Heirs-at-Law\n      agreed to go along with Tom Green County and accepted SMU's\n      offer. Id. Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement, the\n      Heirs-at-Law and Tom Green County split those proceeds 50/50.\n      Id.\n\n(CR:808)\n\n      These statements alleged to have been made at mediation should not be\n\nconsidered for any purpose. Use of the statements is barred by the mediation\n\nprivilege, being Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 154.073.

White, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2837649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Tex.App.–Austin 2009, pet. struck), this Court failed to find the\n\n“extraordinary factual circumstances” presented in State Street where the\n\nrecord did not indicate that the defendant had procured a contract with\n\npromises it intended to break and the lawsuit appeared to have grown out of\n\nwhat was initially a good-faith disagreement over performance under the\n\ncontract. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2837649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3.\n\n      Here, the County asserts immunity in an effort to avoid the expense of\n\ntrial. The pleaded facts do not demonstrate that the County made promises\n\nwhich it intended to break.\n\n      Here, there is a good-faith dispute over performance of the library\n\nnaming provision: whether the 1994 commissioners court found that the\n\n                                      65\n\fSMU litigation recovery was substantial enough to name the library in honor\n\nof Hughes’ family (disputed); and, even if it had, whether in the course of\n\nnaming the new library the 2011 commissioners court is somehow precluded\n\nfrom making its own determination (a contrary determination). This issue\n\nwas previously discussed.\n\n      Finally Hughes, having waived his statutory remedy, has shown no\n\nright to equitable relief. Hughes could have sought legislative consent to sue.\n\nSee IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d at 854 (if a party who contracts with the State feels\n\naggrieved, it can seek redress by asking the Legislature to waive immunity\n\nfrom suit). Hughes does not plead that he even sought, much less obtained,\n\nlegislative consent. Hughes has not pleaded a basis for waiver of immunity\n\nby conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                      66\n\f                                  PRAYER\n\n      Appellee Tom Green County prays:\n\n1.

Hughes files this Third Amended Petition to Enforce a Settlement\n\nAgreement he entered with Tom Green County to resolve claims the underlying lawsuit.\n\nI.        Related Case\n\n          1.        This action is being filed to enforce a settlement agreement entered in Cause No.\n\nCV91-0426-A; In re the Will of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr., in the 51st Judicial District Court of Tom\n\nGreen County.\n\nII.       Discovery\n\n          2.        Discovery in this action should be governed by the Level III scheduling order entered\n\nin this matter.\n\nIII.      Parties\n\n          3.        Plaintiff Charles J. Hughes is a resident of Tom Green County.\n\n          4.        Defendant Tom Green County is a county located in Texas.

In addition, Hughes files a declaratory judgement action seeks to invalidate and set\n\naside a March 1, 2011 motion and resolution of the Tom Green County Commissioners' Court made\n\nin violation of the Texas Open Meeting Act.

In addition to declaratory relief, Hughes seeks monetary relief of over $1,000,000.00.\n\nV.        Facts\n\n          8.        Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. was the uncle of Charles J. Hughes. Duwain Hughes lived\n\nin San Angelo and taught English for many years. Following Duwain Hughes’s death, The Will\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 2\n\n                                                            806\n\fof Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. (the “Will”) was probated in the County Court of Tom Green County,\n\nTexas, on April 6, 1965.\n\n          9.        Under the terms of the Will, Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. left his then new home, collection\n\nof rare books, and his music collection to the Tom Green County Library board, to establish an\n\nadjunct library in his name. Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. also left the residue of his estate to the Tom\n\nGreen County Library Board to pay down the mortgage on the home and for the upkeep and\n\nmaintenance of his home. At that time, this residual gift included a significant mineral estate that\n\nwas worth several million dollars.\n\n          10.       Inexplicably, instead of honoring Duwain E. Hughes, Jr.’s wishes and maintaining\n\nhis home as a library, the County chose to sell the home at a steep discount. This allowed the\n\nresiduary gift of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr.’s estate to arguably lapse to Southern Methodist University\n\n(“SMU”), which also received gift of specific mineral interests under the Will.\n\n          11.       On April 9, 1991, Southern Methodist University filed a lawsuit styled In re: The Will\n\nof Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. in the 51st Judicial District Court of Tom Green County under Cause No.\n\nCV91-0426-A (the “Underlying Suit”). In the Underlying Suit, SMU requested that the court\n\nrelease a restriction on the use of a gift made to it under the Will for the endowment of a Chair of\n\nEnglish for SMU, so that the excess value of that gift could otherwise be used to support and\n\nmaintain the English Department for SMU. At that time, the value of the mineral estate that SMU\n\nhad received exceeded the maximum amount necessary to endow a Chair for the Department of\n\nEnglish by approximately $4,000,000.\n\n          12.       On May 3, 1991, Tom Green County intervened in the Underlying Suit on behalf of\n\nthe Tom Green County Library, and sought a declaration that the residue of the gift to SMU\n\nbelonged to the County Library.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            807\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 3\n\f          13.       On March 30, 1993, Charles J. Hughes intervened and sought a declaration that\n\nbecause of the lapse in the gift of the residue to Tom Green County, the residue of the gift to SMU\n\nbelonged to Duwain E. Hughes, Jr.’s heirs-at-law – Charles J. Hughes, Carol Crews Carter, and Joan\n\nCrews Hoyt (the “Heirs-at-Law”).\n\n          14.       The Court ordered the parties to mediation of the SMU Lawsuit on May 26, 1994.\n\nPrior to mediation, Tom Green County and the Heirs-at-Law entered an agreement titled Mutual\n\nPartial Assignments (hereafter the “Agreement”), attached hereto as Exhibit A, by which the parties\n\nirrevocably assigned and divided the proceeds of any recovery in the lawsuit 50% to the Heirs-at-\n\nLaw, and 50% to Tom Green County. The signatories to the Agreement were authorized to sign\n\nby all required authorities.\n\n          15.       Specifically, under the terms of the Agreement Tom Green County promised to name\n\nits Central Tom Green County Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or Frances Hughes Crews,\n\n“if the commissioners consider the County’s ultimate recovery to be substantial enough for such\n\nrecognition.” Exhibit A, p. 4.\n\n          16.       The Tom Green County Commissioner’s Court authorized Timothy Weatherby, one\n\nof the Commissioners at the time, to serve as the County’s representative for the mediation. Exhibit\n\nB, Affidavit of Timothy Weatherby. Mr. Weatherby was fully aware that a settlement and\n\nsubstantial recovery from SMU would trigger the naming obligation under the Assignment\n\nAgreement. Id. Counsel for the County, Phil Lane, and the County Attorney, Tom Goff, also\n\nparticipated in the mediation. Pursuant to the Agreement, Hughes and the Heirs at Law aligned with\n\nthe County at mediation and joined forces against SMU. After the initial separate offers to the\n\nCounty and to the Heirs at Law, the County representatives and the Heirs at Law moved into the\n\nsame room and began negotiating for joint offers from SMU.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            808\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 4\n\f          17.       SMU offered to pay the Heirs-at-Law and Tom Green County $1,000,000 in\n\nsettlement for their claims. Id.\n\n          18.       At the time that the $1,000,000 settlement offer was made, and although he was\n\nalready delegated authority, Timothy Weatherby contacted the other County Commissioners, and\n\nthey all agreed that the County’s $500,000 share was “significant” (as it constituted the largest single\n\ncash donation the County had ever received), should be accepted, and warranted naming the Central\n\nTom Green County Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or Frances Hughes Crews, as set forth\n\nin the Agreement. Id.\n\n          19.       Because the Tom Green County representatives at the mediation stated that the\n\nCounty’s portion of SMU’s offer would be substantial enough to warrant naming the Central Library\n\nas contemplated in the Assignment Agreement, the Heirs-at-Law agreed to go along with Tom\n\nGreen County and accepted SMU’s offer. Id. Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement, the\n\nHeirs-at-Law and Tom Green County split those proceeds 50/50. Id.\n\n          20.       On July 6, 1994, Tom Green County Commissioner’s Court met in open session.\n\nDuring this session, the Commissioners considered the ultimate recovery in the lawsuit to be\n\nsubstantial enough and ratified the Agreement with Hughes and the Heirs at Law.\n\n          21.       After ratifying the Agreement and the separate agreement settling claims against\n\nSMU and dismissing the lawsuit, Tom Green County deposited the settlement proceeds it received\n\ninto a segregated bank account called the Hughes Library Fund. Exhibit B.\n\n          22.       Tom Green County used a part of the Hughes Library Fund to hire an architect to\n\nevaluate potential new locations for the central library, and also utilized a portion of the funds to hire\n\na grant consulting firm to assist the Library Board with grant applications. Id.\n\n          23.       The planning and preparation for the new library location was interrupted, however,\n\nwhen financial difficulties caused by bad investments and criminal cover ups by a previous County\n\n\n                                                            809\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 5\n\fTreasurer made it necessary to utilize a portion of the Hughes Library Fund to assist Tom Green\n\nCounty in meeting its financial shortfalls. Id.\n\n          24.       The Tom Green County Commissioners discussed the use of the Hughes Library\n\nFund to assist with the County’s financial burdens with Charles Hughes, who agreed to allow the\n\nfund to be used in such a manner, so long as the County fulfilled its obligation to name the new\n\nCentral Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or Frances Hughes Crews, whenever it was built.\n\nId. The County agreed to this stipulation. Id.\n\n          25.       Charles Hughes met and spoke with County Judge Mike Brown and Timothy\n\nWeatherby on a number of occasions to discuss the County’s plans regarding the naming of the\n\nCentral Library, and was repeatedly informed that the issue would be addressed when the location\n\nfor the new central library was chosen, and it was an appropriate occasion for giving it a name.\n\n          26.       The Tom Green County Central Library remained unnamed until March 1, 2011,\n\nwhen the Tom Green County Commissioners met to vote on naming portions of the new Tom Green\n\nCounty Central Library, which had just been constructed by remodeling the former Hemphill-Wells\n\nBuilding. Exhibit C, Excerpt of Minutes of County Commissioners Meeting. Notwithstanding the\n\nCounty’s agreement with Mr. Charles Hughes, and the donations made by his uncle Duwain E.\n\nHughes, Jr. —which had the County retained would have had a value of more than $12,000,000—\n\nthe County Commissioners read a pre-written \"motion\" and “voted” unanimously to name the library\n\nthe “Stephens Central Library,” in recognition of a recent $3,000,000 donation from Pollyanna and\n\nSteve Stephens. Id.\n\n        27.       In addition to a blank for the Commissioners to fill in with “Stephens Central Library,”\n\nthe pre-written motion provided that \"Tom Green County's ultimate recovery in [the Underlying\n\nLawsuit] is not substantial enough to name Tom Green County's main library in honor of Duwain\n\nE. Hughes Jr. [or] in honor of Frances Hughes Crews . . . .\" See Exhibit C (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                                            810\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 6\n\f        28.       On information and belief, the County Commissioners came to a final decision on this\n\nmatter and pre-drafted the accompanying motion in a private meeting prior to the public hearing - a\n\nmeeting at which neither Plaintiff nor any other members of the public were present. The pointed\n\nreference to the language of the Assignment Agreement clearly indicates the County Commissioners\n\nwere aware of the County’s prior obligation to the Hughes family, and entered the March 1, 2011\n\nhearing with a settled intent to disregard that obligation, regardless of the Commissioners Court’s\n\ndecision on July 6, 1994. Thus, the naming decision was a foregone conclusion, and the County's\n\npurported deliberations and \"vote\" at the hearing were simply a sham. The pre-written motion only\n\nannounced the County’s pre-determined decision, and was orchestrated to present an appearance of\n\ndue process and facial compliance with the Open Meetings Act.\n\nVI.     Causes of Action\n\n        29.       The foregoing facts are fully incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.\n\n        A.        Declaratory Judgment\n\n        30.       Section 551.102 of the Texas Open Meetings Act (the \"Act\") provides that \"[a] final\n\naction, decision, or vote on a matter deliberated in a closed meeting under this chapter may only be\n\nmade in an open meeting that is held in compliance with the notice provisions of this chapter.\"\n\n        31.       The March 1, 2011 motion was pre-determined and pre-written by the Commissioners\n\nprior to the public hearing. Upon information and belief, the official \"vote\" taken in open session was\n\nmerely an announcement of the actual decision, which was made by the Commissioners in private,\n\noutside of the open meeting. Neither Plaintiff nor any other member of the public received any notice\n\nof, or were given any opportunity to participate in, these private deliberations.\n\n        32.       Such actions constitute a direct violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act and the\n\nMarch 1, 2011 resolution should therefore be declared invalid and set aside. See TEX. GOV'T CODE\n\nANN. § 551.141 (\"An action taken by a governmental body in violation of this chapter is voidable\");\n\n\n                                                            811\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 7\n\fSee Lower Colorado River Auth. v.

Violations of the Texas Open Meetings Act may be addressed through a number of\n\nremedies available under the Act and separate statutory authorities. One such remedy is found in\n\nSection 551.142 of the Act, which allows any \"interested person\" to \"bring an action by mandamus\n\nor injunction to stop, prevent, or reverse a violation or threatened violation of this chapter by\n\nmembers of a governmental body.\" In lieu of a writ of mandamus or injunction, an \"interested\n\nperson\" authorized under Section 551.142 may also seek a declaratory judgment to invalidate the\n\nunlawful act under Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.

PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 37.003 (authorizing a court to declare the \"rights, duties, and other legal relations\" of\n\ncitizens and public officials).\n\n        B.        Breach of Settlement Agreement\n\n        34.       The Agreement constituted a valid and enforceable settlement agreement between\n\nTom Green County and the Heirs-at-Law, including Charles Hughes.\n\n        35.       Tom Green County waived sovereign immunity with respect to those claims by\n\nintervening in the Underlying Lawsuit filed by SMU.\n\n        36.       Tom Green County accepted the proceeds from the settlement reached with SMU and\n\nthe Heirs-at-Law, including Charles Hughes, thus Charles Hughes and the other Heirs-at-Law fully\n\nperformed their obligations under the settlement agreement. Further, on July 6, 1994, Tom Green\n\nCounty ratified the Agreements.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            812\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 8\n\f         37.      Tom Green County, however, has materially breached the Agreement by failing and\n\nrefusing to name the Tom Green County Central Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or\n\nFrances Hughes Crews. At the time of the County’s breach on March 1, 2011, the value of the\n\nnaming obligation was $3,000,000.00. As a result of the County’s breach, Hughes suffered damages\n\nin the amount of the lost value of the naming obligation – $3,000,000.00.\n\n         38.      Further, and in the alternative, because Tom Green County has materially breached\n\nthe agreement, it is liable for the $500,000 in settlement proceeds it received, plus pre-judgment and\n\npost judgment interest.\n\n         C.       Action for Money Had and Received\n\n         39.      Tom Green County accepted the benefits of the Assignment Agreement, and the\n\nsubsequent settlement reached with SMU and the Heirs-at-Law. By accepting those benefits, Tom\n\nGreen County enjoyed the savings of significantly limiting the scope and risk associated with the\n\nUnderlying Lawsuit as it approached mediation, and then benefitted from its use of the $500,000 in\n\nsettlement proceeds for many years.\n\n         40.      Tom Green County received this benefit on the basis of false promises that it would\n\nname the Tom Green County Central Library in honor of Duwain E. Hughes, Jr. or Frances Hughes\n\nCrews.\n\n         41.      Tom Green County has failed and refused to do equity, by returning the $500,000 it\n\nhas unjustly received, in exchange for its promise to name the Central Library.\n\n         42.      Tom Green County has instead named the Central Library the “Stephens Central\n\nLibrary,” and continues to retain, or has otherwise appropriated the $500,000 it received and that in\n\nequity, justice, or in law belongs to Hughes.\n\n         43.      Therefore, Tom Green County is obligated to return the $500,000 to the Charles\n\nHughes as is equitable and just.\n\n\n                                                            813\nPlaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 9\n\fVII.     Conditions Precedent\n\n         44.       All conditions precedent to the relief sought by Charles Hughes have been fulfilled\n\nor have occurred.\n\nVIII. Attorney’s Fees\n\n         45.       Charles Hughes seeks reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees for Tom Green\n\nCounty’s breach of contract pursuant to Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code Section 38.001(8)\n\nand seeks such attorneys’ fees as are equitable and just pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code Section 37.009.\n\nIX.      Damages\n\n         46.        As a result of Tom Green County’s breach of the Agreement, Hughes suffered the loss\n\nof the value of the naming obligation, which at the time of the County’s breach was valued at\n\n$3,000,000.00.\n\n         47.       Alternatively, as a result of Tom Green County’s breach of the Agreement, Hughes\n\nsuffered the loss of his share of $500,000 by his reliance on the County’s Agreement.\n\n         48.       Further, and in the alternative, Tom Green County was unjustly enriched in the amount\n\nof $500,000.00 in funds that it received and that amount should be returned to Hughes.\n\nIX.      Prayer\n\n         Wherefore, Plaintiff Charles J. Hughes respectfully requests that upon trial of this matter the\n\nCourt enter judgment for Hughes against Tom Green County, invalidate and set aside the March 1,\n\n2011 Resolution made in violation of the Texas Opening Meetings Act, order the County to pay\n\nCharles J. Hughes the amount of damages sought herein, plus pre-judgment interest, costs, attorney\n\nfees, post judgment interest, and grant Charles J. Hughes such other and further relief, at law or in\n\nequity, to which he is justly entitled.\n\n\n                                                             814\n Plaintiff's Third Amended Petition to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Declaratory Judgment Action   Page 10\n\f                                                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                          DAVIS, GERALD & CREMER\n                                                          A Professional Corporation\n                                                          400 W.
