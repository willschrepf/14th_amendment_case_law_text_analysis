We affirm the jury’s verdict.\n\n                      PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUD\n\n¶2       Lester E. Ammondson (Ammondson), Sherwood Christensen (Christensen),\n\nW. Stephen Dee (Dee), Charles Gilder (Gilder), John A. Lahr (Lahr), Edmond Magone\n\n(Magone), Elmer Meldahl (Meldahl), John S. Miller (Miller), Roger L. Rawls (Rawls),\n\nC. Daniel Regan (Regan), Allen T. Smith (Smith), George A. Thorson (Thorson), John B.\n\nVan Gelder (Van Gelder), Wilhelmus C. Verbael (Verbael), and James Couture\n\n(Couture)1 (collectively Retirees), were all former employees of the Montana Power\n\nCompany (MPC), a Montana-based public utility company. These individuals had been\n\nemployed with MPC for periods ranging from 3 to 40 years. Each of these plaintiffs left\n\nMPC after entering into separate agreements with MPC which provided them monthly\n\npayments to supplement their regular retirement plans. The agreements were known as\n\n“Top Hat Contracts,” a term derived from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\n1\n    Catherine Couture, the surviving spouse of James Couture, represented him in this suit.\n\n                                                  3\n\fThe combined value of these individual Top Hat Contracts was approximately $2.9\n\nmillion dollars.\n\n¶3     Northwestern is a Delaware corporation that currently operates as a public utility\n\nin Montana. In 2002, Northwestern purchased MPC’s transmission and distribution\n\nassets. Northwestern hired the law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, LLP (Paul\n\nHastings) to facilitate the purchase. In the course of its purchase of MPC, Northwestern\n\nassumed responsibility for the Top Hat Contracts in a unit purchase agreement (UPA),\n\nwhich specifically stated that Northwestern would maintain and be responsible for all\n\ncurrent and future obligations of MPC as they related to any supplemental pension\n\nbenefit or benefit replacement restoration plan, program, or individual agreement which\n\nhad been maintained by MPC.\n\n¶4     In September 2003, Northwestern filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in United\n\nStates Bankruptcy Court in the Federal District of Delaware. The Paul Hastings law firm\n\ncontinued to provide Northwestern with legal representation during this time. When it\n\nfiled for bankruptcy, Northwestern had several thousand potential creditors.            In\n\nbankruptcy proceedings, Northwestern reviewed the contracts held by these creditors to\n\ndetermine if it would assume or reject them. If the contracts were assumed, their terms\n\nwould be honored; if they were rejected, then the holders of those contracts would\n\nbecome general unsecured creditors and likely receive general, unsecured stock in the\n\nreorganized Northwestern. Northwestern did not provide notice to the holders of the Top\n\nHat Contracts that it would reject their contracts during bankruptcy and seek to treat them\n\nas general, unsecured creditors. Instead, Northwestern continued to pay the Retirees\n\n\n                                            4\n\funder the terms of the Top Hat Contracts throughout bankruptcy proceedings in\n\nDelaware.\n\n¶5     On October 19, 2004, the bankruptcy court confirmed Northwestern’s Chapter 11\n\nbankruptcy reorganization plan (Plan). The effective date of the Plan was November 1,\n\n2004, at which time Northwestern officially emerged from bankruptcy as a reorganized\n\nentity. On December 30, 2004, Northwestern filed a notice of substantial confirmation of\n\nthe Plan in Federal District Court in Delaware.\n\n¶6     On January 1, 2005, Northwestern, without giving any prior notice to any of the\n\nRetirees, ceased making payments to them under the Top Hat Contracts.2 Although some\n\nof the Retirees immediately contacted Northwestern in an attempt to discover why their\n\npayments had stopped, Northwestern failed to provide them with any answers.                On\n\nJanuary 26, 2005, Kovash, who was Northwestern’s director of benefits, informed the\n\nRetirees in writing that it had discontinued payment under their Top Hat Contracts in\n\nconnection with its plan of reorganization.        Furthermore, Northwestern advised the\n\nRetirees that it anticipated filing a motion in bankruptcy court to terminate the Top Hat\n\nContracts and that upon receipt of the motion, the Retirees should contact a legal advisor.\n\n¶7     On January 31, 2005, Northwestern filed a motion to terminate the Top Hat\n\nContracts in bankruptcy court in the Federal District of Delaware. After the filing of the\n\nmotion in bankruptcy court, the Retirees were able to obtain Montana counsel, the\n\nEdwards Law Firm of Billings, to represent them in this matter. The Edwards Law Firm\n\n2\n  Of all the plaintiffs in this case, only Van Gelder was listed in bankruptcy proceedings as a\nparty to an executory contract. However, Van Gelder, like all the other plaintiffs, was never\ngiven any notice that Northwestern intended to terminate his Top Hat Contract.\n\n                                              5\n\fin turn hired local counsel in Delaware to represent the Retirees in federal bankruptcy\n\ncourt.     On March 31, 2005, the Retirees filed an objection and response to\n\nNorthwestern’s motion to terminate the Top Hat Contracts. The Retirees sought to have\n\nNorthwestern’s motion dismissed on the grounds that the bankruptcy court did not have\n\njurisdiction to entertain the motion since none of the Retirees had been listed as secured\n\nor unsecured creditors prior to Northwestern’s reorganization during bankruptcy\n\nproceedings. Additionally, the Retirees counterclaimed against Northwestern for breach\n\nof contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and abuse of process.\n\n¶8       On March 31, 2005, the Retirees also filed a claim for compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages against Northwestern, Drook, Hanson, Schrum, Kovash, and Kliewer in the\n\nSecond Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County.         This state complaint was later\n\namended to add Paul Hastings as a defendant based on its actions in advising\n\nNorthwestern in federal bankruptcy court proceedings against the Retirees. In the state\n\ncomplaint, the Retirees alleged that these defendants had committed breach of contract,\n\nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with contracts,\n\nabuse of process, and fraudulent conduct, by virtue of their actions in stopping payment\n\nunder the Top Hat Contracts without notice, and then filing a motion to terminate those\n\ncontracts in bankruptcy court after Northwestern had already finalized its reorganization\n\nunder Chapter 11. The day prior to filing the state complaint, counsel for the Retirees\n\nnotified Northwestern’s counsel in writing as to the contents of the complaint and its\n\nintent to file suit in Montana, but also stated that he would hold off on serving the\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fcomplaint on Northwestern until the bankruptcy court in Delaware had an opportunity to\n\nrule on the Retirees’ response to Northwestern’s motion to terminate.\n\n¶9    On April 25, 2005, Northwestern filed a complaint against the Retirees in federal\n\nbankruptcy court in Delaware. In the complaint, Northwestern named itself as a plaintiff,\n\nand each of the Retirees as defendants. Contemporaneously, Northwestern also filed a\n\nmotion for an order to show cause against the Retirees, and sought a preliminary\n\ninjunction against their action in state court in Montana. Pursuant to Northwestern’s\n\nmotion, the Delaware federal bankruptcy court, Hon. John L. Peterson presiding, issued\n\nan order to show cause against the Retirees, and stayed all state court proceedings until\n\nthe bankruptcy court could rule on the matter.\n\n¶10   On May 3, 2005, Judge Peterson held a hearing on the pending motions and\n\ncomplaint before the bankruptcy court.       Both Northwestern and the Retirees were\n\nrepresented by counsel, with some of the Retirees flying from Montana to attend the\n\nproceedings. The next day, Judge Peterson issued his ruling, dismissing Northwestern’s\n\nmotion to terminate and concluding that the bankruptcy court was without jurisdiction to\n\nentertain Northwestern’s motion. In his written order, Judge Peterson noted that on\n\nDecember 30, 2004, Northwestern had filed a notice with the bankruptcy court of\n\n“substantial consummation of the Plan, meaning all matters required to be done under the\n\nPlan, and pursuant to the Plan, had been accomplished. Nowhere are the claims of the\n\n[Retirees] recognized as affecting consummation or implementation of the Plan.” Judge\n\nPeterson further observed that specific language in the confirmed Plan contemplated that\n\nany disputes relating to issues concerning contractual and fiduciary duties owed by\n\n\n                                            7\n\fNorthwestern to other parties (such as the Top Hat Contracts and corresponding duties\n\nowed to the Retirees by Northwestern) would be resolved in a forum outside of federal\n\nbankruptcy court. Third, Judge Peterson noted that under the Plan Northwestern was\n\nrequired to make appropriate filings in bankruptcy court if it wished to reject any\n\nexecutory contracts during bankruptcy proceedings—a             provision    with     which\n\nNorthwestern obviously failed to comply since it did not give any notice to the Retirees\n\nuntil after it emerged from Chapter 11 as a reorganized entity. Reflecting on this fact,\n\nJudge Peterson then held as follows:\n\n              The single fact of the matter is quite significant. None of the\n      [Retirees] were afforded due process, in that none were served with\n      rejection notices of their executory contracts in accordance with\n      [Northwestern’s] Plan, even though, alarmingly, [Northwestern], in its\n      Motion to terminate the pension benefits, acknowledged the MPC purchase\n      agreement . . . as to the pension agreements “constitutes a legal, valid and\n      binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms of MPC” that\n      [Northwestern] “shall maintain and shall be responsible for . . . all current\n      and future obligations of MPC . . . under any supplemental pension benefit\n      or benefit replacement or restoration plan, program or individual\n      agreement maintained by MPC . . . .” The Motion then correctly asserts\n      that “no individual who is a party to an MPC agreement has filed a proof\n      of claim against the Debtor.” Yet, [Northwestern] now wants to reject\n      each individual agreement that it assumed and became liable to pay, at this\n      late date, beyond the bar date [Northwestern] established in the Plan, as an\n      executory contract, where, absolutely no notice or pleading was ever\n      served upon any of the [Retirees] prior to confirmation. . . .\n              Simply stated, these [Retirees] have not been afforded due process,\n      by notice, or any other form in the [Northwestern] Plan reorganization\n      effort. To now cast upon each of the [Retirees] a jurisdictional premise\n      before this Court in light of the above is simply beyond any standard of\n      timely fairness and notice, which this Court cannot tolerate or condone.\n\n¶11   Taking notice of the fact that the Retirees had filed a complaint in state District\n\nCourt, Judge Peterson held there was no jurisdiction over the Top Hat Contracts in\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\ffederal bankruptcy court, and deemed that in the interests of justice the bankruptcy court\n\nwould abstain in favor of the state court action in Montana. Northwestern subsequently\n\nfiled an appeal from Judge Peterson’s ruling, but then voluntarily dismissed that appeal at\n\na later date.\n\n¶12    Once the matter was returned to the Second Judicial District Court, the Retirees\n\nsought a jury trial on their claims and the parties went through an extensive motion\n\npractice prior to trial. In November 2005, Northwestern resumed paying the Retirees\n\npursuant to their Top Hat Contracts, and paid them back payments due with interest.\n\nPrior to trial, Paul Hastings settled with the Retirees for an undisclosed amount and was\n\nsubsequently dismissed from the suit.\n\n¶13    Prior to and during trial, the District Court issued rulings related to the availability\n\nof certain defenses to Northwestern, the admissibility of evidence, Northwestern’s\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law on some of the Retirees’ claims, and the jury\n\ninstructions. As necessary, we will discuss the District Court’s rulings on these issues\n\nbelow. The jury trial began on February 12, 2007, and concluded with a jury verdict in\n\nthe Retirees’ favor on February 22, 2007. During the course of the trial, the jury heard\n\nfrom the Retirees, as well as Catherine Couture, testifying about their involvement in\n\nthese events and how they were emotionally and mentally impacted by the actions of the\n\nDefendants. The jury also heard, either through live testimony or deposition, from the\n\nindividually named defendants, Paul Hastings’ attorneys, Ford Elsaesser (Elsaesser), a\n\nqualified expert on bankruptcy law, Wade Dahood (Dahood), a Montana attorney who\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fwas qualified to render an expert opinion on the Defendants’ and Paul Hastings’ conduct,\n\nand an economist presented by the Retirees in support of their claims for damages.\n\n¶14      Through the testimony of these various witnesses and numerous documents\n\n(including many of the internal communications among Northwestern, Paul Hastings, and\n\ntheir agents, employees, and officers), the jury was presented with two different versions\n\nof the events surrounding the termination of the Top Hat Contracts and the initiation of\n\nproceedings against the Retirees in federal bankruptcy court. The Retirees portrayed the\n\nDefendants’ actions as a course of illegal and malicious conduct directed against them.\n\nThey asserted that Northwestern’s general counsel, Thomas Knapp (Knapp), ordered the\n\ntermination of the contracts and filings in bankruptcy court against the legal advice of\n\nPaul Hastings, whose attorneys had opined that this course of action was not legally\n\nsupportable. The Retirees claimed that Northwestern and its counsel knew that the Top\n\nHat Contracts were valid and binding, yet went on to represent to the federal bankruptcy\n\ncourt the opposite. Furthermore, the Retirees argued that the economic cost of the Top\n\nHat Contracts was to be borne by the rate payers, and not Northwestern directly, and that\n\nit was disingenuous for Northwestern to represent to the bankruptcy court that\n\nterminating the contracts was in the best interests of the corporation; yet, in the face of\n\nthis evidence, Knapp, Northwestern, and its officers and agents, moved to terminate the\n\nTop Hat Contracts and initiate proceedings against the Retirees in federal bankruptcy\n\ncourt.\n\n¶15      In this connection, the Retirees presented testimony from Dahood and Elsaesser to\n\nsupport their argument that the bankruptcy proceedings and related actions were without\n\n\n                                             10\n\flegal basis. Dahood also testified about the costs incurred by the Retirees in defending\n\nagainst the Defendants’ claims. Elsaesser opined that an affidavit signed by Kovash,\n\nwherein he represented to the bankruptcy court that the Top Hat Contracts were not valid,\n\nlegal, or binding agreements, was a false and misleading statement made to the\n\nbankruptcy court. Additionally, Elsaesser testified that a sworn declaration filed by\n\nKliewer, Northwestern’s controller, wherein he claimed that the Retirees were unsecured\n\ncreditors, was an absolutely false statement and another misrepresentation to the\n\nbankruptcy court.\n\n¶16   As to the corporate decision to terminate the Top Hat Contracts and commence\n\nlitigation in bankruptcy court, the Retirees presented evidence and argument to support\n\ntheir claims that these actions were tortious in nature as well. They argued that the\n\nbankruptcy court filings and other actions taken by Northwestern against the Retirees,\n\nwere done with the intent to make them accept a settlement more favorable to\n\nNorthwestern. The Retirees argued that Northwestern sought to leverage them into\n\ngiving up their legitimate claims under their contracts and instead accept shares of stock\n\nin the newly reorganized Northwestern corporation—an action which none of the\n\nRetirees wished to take. In this connection, the Retirees presented evidence concerning\n\nthe participation of Drook, Hanson and Schrum in the corporate decisions to terminate\n\nthe Top Hat Contracts and initiate what the Retirees term Northwestern’s “malicious\n\nlawsuit” in bankruptcy court. The Retirees claim that these decisions, and the acts of the\n\nindividual defendants in performing them, constituted tortious conduct for which both\n\nNorthwestern, and the individual defendants, could be held liable.\n\n\n                                           11\n\f¶17   The Defendants, by contrast, painted these events as actions taken in the best\n\ninterests of Northwestern without any malice or tortious intent towards the Retirees.\n\nNorthwestern claimed that the Top Hat Contracts were among many other non-qualified\n\nbenefit plans that its financial and legal advisors reviewed during bankruptcy in order to\n\nevaluate their administrative costs and value to the corporation. Northwestern admits that\n\nit terminated the Top Hat Contracts without timely notice to the Retirees, but asserted\n\nthat this action, and the subsequent related proceedings in bankruptcy court, did not\n\namount to tortious conduct against the Retirees. Instead, it basically argued that its\n\nmistake was in the timing of its decision to terminate the contracts, and its failure to\n\nprovide proper notice. Northwestern further pointed out that it resumed payments to the\n\nRetirees in November 2005, and paid them back payments with interest. Through the\n\ntestimony of Judge Peterson, counsel for Paul Hastings, Knapp, Kovash, and Kliewer, the\n\nDefendants presented this defense against the Retirees’ claims.\n\n¶18   In its verdict rendered on February 22, 2007, the jury found Northwestern liable\n\nfor breach of contract, the tort of bad faith breach of contract, abuse of process, and\n\nmalicious prosecution. It also found Northwestern liable for punitive damages. With\n\nrespect to the individual defendants Drook, Hanson, Schrum, Kovash, and Kliewer, the\n\njury found them liable only for abuse of process and malicious prosecution, and not liable\n\nfor punitive damages. The jury further found the Defendants collectively not liable on\n\nthe tortious interference of contract claims. As a result of the verdict, the jury awarded\n\nthe Retirees as a whole approximately $17.5 million dollars in compensatory damages,\n\nwith individual amounts apportioned to each individual Retiree. The following day the\n\n\n                                           12\n\fpunitive damages phase of the trial was held, and the same jury returned a verdict of\n\n$4 million dollars in punitive damages against Northwestern.\n\n¶19    Judgment was entered by the District Court on March 5, 2007.               After the\n\njudgment, the Defendants filed various post-trial motions seeking to offset the damages\n\nagainst the pre-trial settlement entered into by Paul Hastings, and also seeking to reduce\n\nthe judgment by the amount of the ongoing payments Northwestern was still making to\n\nthe Retirees. These motions were denied by the District Court.\n\n¶20    The Defendants now appeal the jury’s verdict, as well as various rulings of the\n\nDistrict Court before, during, and after trial. We state the issues presented by their appeal\n\nas follows:\n\n¶21    Issue One:      Were the Retirees’ claims completely preempted by federal\n\nbankruptcy law and did the District Court lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider\n\nthose claims?\n\n¶22    Issue Two: Did the District Court err by denying the Defendants the opportunity\n\nto present an advice-of-counsel defense to the Retirees’ claims?\n\n¶23    Issue Three: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on the Retirees’ abuse of process claim?\n\n¶24    Issue Four: Should the judgment on the Retirees’ bad faith claim be reversed?\n\n¶25    Issue Five: Did the District Court commit reversible error in allowing the jury to\n\nconsider the Retirees’ claims for emotional distress and instructing them on those\n\nclaims?\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f¶26    Issue Six: Was the jury’s verdict awarding tort damages supported by substantial\n\ncredible evidence?\n\n¶27    Issue Seven: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ motions for\n\ndismissal and judgment as a matter of law as to defendants Drook, Hanson, Schrum,\n\nKovash, and Kliewer?\n\n¶28    Issue Eight: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ post-trial\n\nmotion to offset the judgment against the amount of the Retirees’ pre-trial settlement with\n\nPaul Hastings?\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶29    We review a district court’s conclusions on questions of law to determine if those\n\nconclusions are correct.

Although this\n\nissue has not been previously raised or pled as an affirmative defense during the course of\n\nthese proceedings, the Defendants nonetheless argue that it merits consideration because\n\nchallenges to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including for the first\n\ntime on appeal.\n\n¶35      While we agree with the Defendants that challenges to subject matter jurisdiction\n\nmay be considered for the first time on appeal, see Stanley v. Lemire, 2006 MT 304,\n\n¶¶ 29-32, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643, given the procedural posture of this case and the\n\nprevious rulings by the federal bankruptcy court, we find this argument wholly devoid of\n\nmerit.    Judge Peterson specifically found that the federal bankruptcy court lacked\n\n\n                                            15\n\fjurisdiction under federal bankruptcy laws over Northwestern’s motion to terminate since\n\nNorthwestern’s bankruptcy plan had already been consummated. In fact, Judge Peterson\n\nwent so far as to characterize Northwestern’s attempt to invoke the federal jurisdiction of\n\nthe bankruptcy court as “simply beyond any standard of timely fairness and notice, which\n\nthis Court cannot tolerate or condone.”\n\n¶36    Northwestern initially appealed this ruling, but then apparently dismissed its\n\nappeal of its own accord. Now, several years later, the Defendants ask this Court to\n\nreturn jurisdiction to the very federal court which has already determined that it lacked\n\njurisdiction, thus leaving the Retirees’ claims in a legal limbo with federal and state\n\ncourts both refusing to exercise jurisdiction over these claims. The implications of this\n\nargument defy common sense and logic, and are nothing short of Kafkaesque.\n\n¶37    Additionally, it is patently obvious that Northwestern is collaterally estopped from\n\nasserting a federal jurisdiction argument at this stage in the proceedings since the issue of\n\nfederal jurisdiction was already decided by Judge Peterson, and Northwestern was party\n\nto this prior, final adjudication. See Auto Parts of Bozeman v. Employment Relations Div.\n\nUnderinsured Employers’ Fund, 2001 MT 72, ¶¶ 29-30, 305 Mont. 40, 23 P.3d 193.\n\nThus, we reject this argument.\n\n¶38    Issue Two: Did the District Court err by denying the Defendants the opportunity\n       to present an advice-of-counsel defense to the Retirees’ claims?\n\n¶39    Throughout bankruptcy proceedings and the decision-making process on whether\n\nto file a motion to terminate the Top Hat Contracts in bankruptcy court, Northwestern\n\nwas represented by the law firm of Paul Hastings. In the Retirees’ complaint, they\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\falleged that Defendants’ actions were done with the assent and assistance of\n\nNorthwestern’s agent Paul Hastings, and resulted in the commission of various torts\n\nagainst the Retirees.\n\n¶40    In its response to these claims, the Defendants presented a general denial, but did\n\nnot plead advice of counsel as an affirmative defense. Prior to trial, the Defendants\n\nproposed the following jury instruction:\n\n              Montana law provides that reliance upon the advice of counsel,\n        provided in good faith and based upon a full and fair statement of the facts\n        by the client, is a complete affirmative defense to an action for malicious\n        prosecution.\n\n¶41    On the morning of trial, the Retirees orally presented to the District Court a\n\nmotion in limine seeking to preclude Northwestern from presenting the affirmative\n\ndefense of reliance on advice of counsel at trial.3            The Retirees argued that the\n\nDefendants could not present such a defense since they did not affirmatively plead it in\n\ntheir responsive pleadings. The Defendants argued against the Retirees’ motion. The\n\nDistrict Court did not make a definitive ruling on the motion at that time.\n\n¶42    On February 16, 2007, during the Retirees’ case-in-chief, but before the\n\nDefendants presented their defense, the District Court entertained further argument on the\n\nRetirees’ motion. The Retirees argued that the Defendants could not present this defense\n3\n  In a previous motion for summary judgment, the Retirees had sought to preclude the\nDefendants from raising any affirmative defenses based on the propriety of Paul Hastings’\nconduct in federal bankruptcy court. The Retirees asserted that Judge Peterson had essentially\nruled on the propriety of Paul Hastings’ conduct in the bankruptcy action when it dismissed that\naction and returned jurisdiction over the Retirees’ claims to state court in Montana. The District\nCourt denied the motion at the time, holding that there remained genuine issues of material fact\non Paul Hastings’ conduct in bankruptcy proceedings as it related to the Retirees’ claims.\nHowever, the District Court had not previously ruled on the extent to which the Defendants\ncould rely upon Paul Hastings’ conduct as an affirmative defense to the claims against them.\n\n                                               17\n\fdue to their failure to plead it, and because they had already conceded that they would not\n\nbe able to assert an “empty chair” defense against Paul Hastings. The Retirees noted that\n\nthe Defendants had never filed a cross-claim against Paul Hastings at any point in the\n\nproceedings.    In response, the Defendants asserted that they had not waived the\n\naffirmative defense of advice of counsel under the authority of McGuire v. Armitage, 184\n\nMont. 407, 603 P.2d 253 (1979). They asserted that under McGuire, the affirmative\n\ndefense of advice of counsel does not need to be affirmatively pleaded, but instead can be\n\nraised in a general denial. The Defendants further asserted that that their reliance on the\n\nadvice of Paul Hastings was relevant to the issue of causation and intent.\n\n¶43    The District Court issued a ruling that same day, denying in part and granting in\n\npart the Retirees’ motion. In its written order, the District Court held that the Defendants\n\ncould not argue to the jury that their reliance on the advice of counsel constituted a valid\n\ndefense to the Retirees’ causes of action, but allowed the Defendants to present evidence\n\nas to the substance of Paul Hastings’ legal advice. The District Court advanced two\n\ngrounds for its decision. First, it concluded that the Defendants had failed to raise advice\n\nof counsel as an affirmative defense in their response to the complaint as required by the\n\nMontana Rules of Civil Procedure.         Second, it concluded that Northwestern, as a\n\ncorporate entity, is held vicariously liable through the acts of its directors, officers,\n\nemployees and agents, and that it simply could not, as a matter of law, rely on advice of\n\ncounsel as an affirmative defense, given it is ultimately responsible for the actions of its\n\ncounsel as an agent of the corporation.\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\f¶44    The District Court did conclude that the presentation of evidence as to the\n\nsubstance of Paul Hastings’ communication and advice would be permitted as it would\n\ngo to the heart of the causation and intent elements involved in the tort claims raised by\n\nthe Retirees. As an example, the District Court noted that claims for punitive damages\n\nand malicious prosecution require a showing from the plaintiff that the defendant acted\n\nwith either actual malice or actual fraud (in the case of punitive damages claims), or that\n\nthe defendant was motivated by malice (in the case of malicious prosecution). The\n\nsubstance and advice of Paul Hastings’ legal counsel would be relevant in helping the\n\njury to assess whether Northwestern or its agents met these mental state requirements.\n\nAs stated by the District Court,\n\n               The Court concludes that the substance of counsel’s\n       communications and advice to the Northwestern Defendants concerning\n       their legal relationship with the Plaintiffs is relevant to the issue of whether\n       the Defendants acted with actual malice or actual fraud in causing harm to\n       the Plaintiffs. The Court also notes that the Plaintiffs’ bankruptcy expert\n       witness [Elsaesser] already has testified that he could not find any evidence\n       in the corporate communications where any of the bankruptcy attorneys\n       advised the Northwestern Defendants to stop the supplemental benefit\n       payments to the Plaintiffs. Should communications or advice to the\n       contrary exist, such evidence would go to the credibility of witnesses.\n\n¶45    Furthermore, the District Court noted that it would ultimately instruct the jury that\n\na corporation acts through, and is responsible for, the conduct of its officers, employees,\n\nand agents, and that evidence as to the advice of counsel under these circumstances\n\nwould go towards evaluating Defendants’ intent in engaging in the conduct at issue when\n\nthey acted against the Retirees.\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f¶46    During the settling of jury instructions, the District Court refused the Defendants’\n\ninstruction on advice of counsel as an affirmative defense on the grounds in its ruling on\n\nthe Retirees’ motion in limine.\n\n¶47    The Defendants now argue that these rulings from the District Court were in error\n\nand should be reversed. Relying primarily upon McGuire, and Stephens v. Conley, 48\n\nMont. 352, 138 P. 189 (1914), as well as the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, the\n\nDefendants assert that advice of counsel may be raised by a general denial, as was done\n\nin this case, and then later be asserted as a complete and affirmative defense. The\n\nDefendants argue that the District Court’s failure to allow this affirmative defense\n\nsubstantially prejudiced them at trial. When combined with the jury instruction that\n\nNorthwestern was responsible for the acts of its legal counsel, the Defendants argue that\n\nthe District Court’s rulings effectively amounted to a directed verdict for the Retirees.\n\nFurthermore, Northwestern asserts that the evidence it presented supports the argument\n\nthat it acted in good faith and reliance upon Paul Hastings’ advice in filing its motions in\n\nbankruptcy court. For these reasons, the Defendants argue that the judgment against\n\nthem must be reversed and a new trial ordered since the jury was denied the opportunity\n\nto consider this defense.\n\n¶48    In response, the Retirees begin by asserting that Northwestern waived the right to\n\npresent this affirmative defense. They also argue that at the hearing on the motion in\n\nlimine as well as during the trial, Northwestern basically conceded to the District Court\n\nthat, under principles of agency law, it would be responsible for the actions of Paul\n\nHastings. In the final pretrial order, Northwestern in fact conceded it could not assert an\n\n\n                                            20\n\f“empty chair” defense against Paul Hastings, and that Paul Hastings’ actions would be\n\nprobative on the issue of causation for the Retirees’ damages. The Retirees also maintain\n\nthat Northwestern’s failure to object to the District Court’s jury instruction that it is\n\n“responsible for the actions of its directors, officers, employees and agents” further\n\nprecludes Northwestern from arguing advice of counsel as an affirmative defense under\n\nthe facts of this case. Finally, the Retirees assert that Northwestern’s advice-of-counsel\n\ndefense was simply not supported by the record, and that Northwestern and the individual\n\ndefendants in fact disregarded Paul Hastings’ legal advice when they took action against\n\nthe Retirees.\n\n¶49    The Defendants’ appeal of this issue presents two separate questions:           first,\n\nwhether the District Court abused its discretion in its order on the Retirees’ motion in\n\nlimine; and second, whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying the\n\nproposed jury instruction on the advice-of-counsel defense.\n\n¶50    In McGuire, the case relied upon by the Defendants, we stated the following\n\nconcerning the advice-of-counsel defense:\n\n              Reliance upon the advice of counsel, provided it is given in good\n       faith and is based upon a full and fair statement of the facts by the client,\n       may afford the latter a complete defense to an action for malicious\n       prosecution. But it is an affirmative defense. It may be shown under a\n       general denial in the answer, but the burden of establishing it is upon the\n       defendant.\n\nMcGuire, 184 Mont. at 412-13, 603 P.2d at 256 (emphasis in original, quotation and\n\nalterations omitted). Contrary to the Defendants’ characterization of McGuire, this case\n\ndid not state unequivocally that advice of counsel is an absolute defense to a claim of\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fmalicious prosecution. Instead, McGuire recognized that advice of counsel may afford a\n\ncomplete defense, provided the defendant satisfies its burden of establishing it.\n\n¶51    In its ruling on the motion in limine, the District Court held that Northwestern was\n\nunable to present advice of counsel as an affirmative defense due to its failure to raise it\n\nas such in its responsive pleadings as required under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). See e.g. Winslow\n\nv. Mont. Rail Link, Inc., 2005 MT 217, ¶ 38, 328 Mont. 260, 121 P.3d 506. There is\n\nsimply no question that reliance upon advice of counsel is a matter of avoidance, and this\n\nbeing so, it clearly falls under the clear provisions of M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) (“In pleading to a\n\npreceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively . . . any other matter constituting\n\nan avoidance or affirmative defense.”).\n\n¶52    In this case, the Defendants did not concede at any point in the litigation that the\n\nRetirees may have an otherwise viable cause of action for malicious prosecution—to be\n\naverted by the affirmative defense of advice of counsel—as is typical of the classic\n\naffirmative defense situation. Rather, they responded in their answer and throughout the\n\nlitigation with an assertion that they had acted in good faith at all times. Thus, in\n\nprohibiting advice of counsel as an affirmative defense, the District Court did not gut the\n\nDefendants’ case at all, as it permitted the Defendants to fully argue that they acted in\n\ngood faith and without malice. In other words, the District Court’s ruling allowed the\n\nDefendants to refute the malicious prosecution claim consistent with the response in their\n\nanswer—i.e., their general denial of the allegations of malice. See Stephens, 48 Mont. at\n\n369-71, 138 P. at 193-94 (discussing the ability of a defendant to rebut a claim of\n\nmalicious prosecution via general denial); see also McGuire, 184 Mont. at 412-13, 603\n\n\n                                             22\n\fP.2d at 256. Because the Defendants were permitted to present all available evidence\n\nshowing that they had acted in good faith without malice, including evidence of the\n\nsubstance of Paul Hastings’ advice and their actions in relying (or not relying) upon it,\n\nthey were not at all powerless to defend themselves. Moreover, we agree with the\n\nRetirees that the Defendants’ concession that they could not assert an “empty chair”\n\ndefense against Paul Hastings, further undermines their ability to turn around and assert\n\nadvice-of-counsel as an affirmative defense at trial. Under these circumstances, we\n\ntherefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in its ruling on the\n\nmotion in limine.\n\n¶53    In the settling of jury instructions, the District Court rejected the advice-of-counsel\n\njury instruction on the same grounds expressed in its ruling on the motion in limine. The\n\ndenial of this jury instruction did not constitute an abuse of discretion, both in light of the\n\nanalysis above and because the jury instructions as a whole fairly and full apprised the\n\njury of the applicable law. English, ¶ 39. The jury was instructed that in order to prove\n\nmalicious prosecution, the Retirees had to show, among other things, that the Defendants\n\nacted with malice, and that there was no probable cause for their actions. The jury heard\n\nthe Defendants’ evidence and argument that they acted in good faith, but apparently did\n\nnot find this evidence and argument credible, and concluded that the Retirees had in fact\n\nestablished their claims for malicious prosecution.4\n\n\n4\n  In this regard, it is worth noting that the Defendants were not prohibited from seeking a jury\ninstruction to expressly inform the jury that a showing of good faith by the Defendants would\ndefeat a claim for malicious prosecution. The Defendants presented evidence and argument that\ntheir conduct was in good faith, but did not seek a corresponding jury instruction. Instead, they\n\n                                               23\n\f¶54    Given the circumstances here presented, we conclude that the District Court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying the Defendants’ proposed instruction on its advice-of-\n\ncounsel defense, or in its pre-trial and trial rulings related to this defense in the context of\n\nthe Retirees’ claims.\n\n¶55    Additionally, we take this opportunity to prospectively declare that advice-of-\n\ncounsel, when used as an affirmative defense at trial, must be pled as such under the\n\nrequirements of M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). In its order, the District Court, citing to Brown v.\n\nEhlert, 255 Mont. 140, 841 P.2d 510 (1992), noted that the essence of an affirmative\n\ndefense is the concession by the defendant that while a plaintiff may have a viable cause\n\nof action, liability may be nonetheless avoided by the defendant based on some statute or\n\nrule. See Brown, 255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514. As the Court stated in Brown,\n\n       The rationale for requiring that these defenses be affirmatively pleaded is\n       simple: the same principles of fairness and notice which require a plaintiff\n       to set forth the basis of the claim require a defendant to shoulder a\n       corresponding duty to set out not merely general denials as appropriate,\n       but also those specific defenses not raised by general denials by which a\n       defendant seeks to avoid liability, rather than merely to controvert\n       plaintiff’s factual allegations.\n\nBrown, 255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514; accord, Burns v. A Cash Const. Lien Bond,\n\n2000 MT 233, ¶ 29, 301 Mont. 304, 8 P.3d 795.\n\n¶56    In challenging the District Court’s decision, the Defendants argue that an advice-\n\nof-counsel defense can be invoked to positively avoid a claim for malicious prosecution,\n\neven if it is not affirmatively pled as required under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). The legal basis\n\n\n\nsought only a blanket jury instruction on advice-of-counsel as a complete, affirmative defense\nthat would apply equally both to Northwestern and the individually-named defendants.\n\n                                              24\n\ffor this argument obviously derives from the language in McGuire cited above. Opinion,\n\n¶ 50.    While a surface reading of this language would suggest that the normal\n\nrequirements of affirmative defenses under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) are somehow suspended in\n\nthe context of malicious prosecution claims, an examination of the authority from which\n\nthis language in McGuire derives demonstrates that this statement is actually a vestige\n\nfrom the days of code pleading, and simply does not trump the well-settled requirements\n\nof M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) and controlling case law. McGuire relies upon a 1958 case from\n\nCalifornia, Masterson v. Pig’n Whistle Corp., 326 P.2d 918, 929 (Cal. 1958). The\n\nauthority for this proposition in Masterson finds its ultimate origin in the 1870 case of\n\nLevy v. Brannan, 39 Cal. 485 (Cal. 1870) as well as Stephens, which was decided in\n\n1914.5 Rule 8(c), and the requirement to affirmatively plead avoidance defenses were\n\nadopted in Montana in 1964. Of necessity, M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) would supersede any\n\nprevious rule of practice from an earlier era which would allow a defendant to invoke a\n\nmatter of avoidance such as advice-of-counsel as an affirmative defense without pleading\n\nit as such.\n\n¶57     We therefore hold that advice-of-counsel, when used as an affirmative defense,\n\nmust be pled in accordance with M. R. Civ. P 8(c). We therefore expressly overrule\n\nMcGuire to the extent it can be read to the contrary. This rule will apply prospectively to\n\nall situations in which a party wishes to rely upon this defense.\n\n¶58     Issue Three: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ motion for\n        judgment as a matter of law on the Retirees’ abuse of process claim?\n\n5\n Masterson relies upon Walker v. Jensen, 212 P.2d 569 (Cal. App. 3 Dist 1949), which relies on\nLevy and a few other cases, all of which ultimately derive their authority from Levy.\n\n                                             25\n\f¶59    During trial, the Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law on the\n\nRetirees’ abuse of process claims, arguing that the Retirees failed to satisfy the elements\n\nof this tort insofar as they presented no evidence that the Defendants used legal process to\n\naccomplish some collateral goal. As the Defendants correctly observe, abuse of process\n\nrequires the plaintiff show both “(1) an ulterior purpose and (2) a willful act in the use of\n\nprocess not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding.” Hughes v. Lynch, 2007 MT\n\n177, ¶ 21, 338 Mont. 214, 164 P.3d 913 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, in order to\n\nsupport an abuse of process claim, the plaintiff must show that there was “an attempt by\n\nthe plaintiff to use process to coerce the defendant to do some collateral thing which he\n\ncould not be legally and regularly compelled to do.” Lynch, ¶ 21 (quotation omitted).\n\nHere, the Defendants claim that such evidence was wholly lacking, and that there was no\n\nevidence presented showing that the bankruptcy proceedings were used for any purpose\n\nother than to adjudicate the resolution of the Retirees’ Top Hat Contracts in bankruptcy\n\ncourt. Accordingly, the Defendants argue there was insufficient evidence to submit this\n\nclaim to the jury and that their motion for judgment as a matter of law on this claim\n\nshould have been granted.\n\n¶60    Additionally, the Defendants maintain that the District Court erred in giving the\n\nfollowing jury instruction relative to the abuse of process claim: “The filing of a lawsuit\n\nin a forum which the party knows to be wrong constitutes an abuse of process.” The\n\nDefendants assert that this jury instruction is a misstatement of the law, and that it\n\nprejudiced them, practically amounting to a directed verdict, by allowing the jury to find\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fthem liable based solely on the fact that the bankruptcy court decided to transfer the\n\nRetirees’ claims back to Montana.\n\n¶61   The Retirees maintain that the District Court did not err in denying this motion or\n\nin giving its jury instruction on this claim. With respect to the jury instruction, the\n\nRetirees maintain that it was adopted verbatim from Leasing, Inc. v. Discovery Ski Corp.,\n\n235 Mont. 133, 765 P.2d 176 (1988), and that it has not been disturbed by subsequent\n\ndecisions. With respect to the evidence on this claim in general, the Retirees maintain\n\nthat they provided sufficient evidence to support it.      First, they point to evidence\n\npresented at trial that Paul Hastings had advised Northwestern that the bankruptcy\n\nmotions were “legally weak,” and that the Top Hat Contracts should have been honored.\n\nSecond, they assert that Northwestern did in fact use the bankruptcy proceedings in an\n\neffort to obtain a collateral advantage against them. In this connection they point to\n\ninternal communications among Northwestern, its agents, and Paul Hastings obtained\n\nduring discovery indicating that the bankruptcy motions were devised by Northwestern to\n\ngain a tactical advantage over the Retirees, compelling them to be more willing to give up\n\ntheir claims against Northwestern. The Retirees also point out that Judge Peterson found\n\nNorthwestern’s various filings to be wholly without merit, and questioned their\n\nlegitimacy.\n\n¶62   In order to prevail on a motion for judgment as a matter of law on the abuse of\n\nprocess claim, the Defendants must show “a complete absence of any evidence which\n\nwould justify submitting an issue to a jury.” Vader, ¶ 20. The Defendants have failed to\n\ncarry this burden. The jury was presented with more than sufficient evidence, including\n\n\n                                           27\n\finternal emails and corporate communications, as well as the testimony of Paul Hastings’\n\nattorneys, Northwestern’s corporate executive agents, and Judge Peterson himself, upon\n\nwhich to decide the abuse of process claims. While the jury was certainly not required to\n\nbelieve such evidence and testimony, the quantum and quality of such evidence was more\n\nthan sufficient to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n¶63    Turning to the challenged jury instruction, we conclude that the District Court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in giving it. First, we agree with the Retirees that this instruction\n\nwas an accurate statement of the law under Leasing, Inc., wherein we held that filing a\n\ncomplaint in a forum which a party knows to be improper constitutes an abuse of process.\n\nSee Leasing, Inc., 235 Mont. at 136, 765 P.2d at 177-78. In that case, one party to a\n\ncontract dispute filed suit in Granite County which was clearly improper under the plain\n\nterms of the contract which required that any contract disputes be handled in Lewis and\n\nClark County. Leasing, Inc., 235 Mont. at 135-36, 765 P.2d at 177-78. Under those\n\ncircumstances, attempting to resolve the dispute in Granite County constituted an abuse\n\nof process.\n\n¶64    In subsequent decisions such as Lynch and Seltzer v. Morton, 2007 MT 62, 336\n\nMont. 225, 154 P.3d 561, we have discussed in greater detail the elements and\n\nrequirements for an abuse of process claim. However, we have never explicitly overruled\n\nor abrogated our decision in Leasing, Inc. More importantly, both Seltzer and Lynch\n\nwere decided after the jury proceedings had concluded in this case. Thus, we cannot say\n\nit was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to rely upon Leasing, Inc. at the time it\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fsettled jury instructions in this case. Thus, we affirm the District Court on this issue as\n\nwell.\n\n¶65     Issue Four: Should the judgment on the Retirees’ bad faith claim be reversed?\n\n¶66     The jury found that Northwestern breached the Retirees’ contracts in bad faith. As\n\nwe stated in Story v. City of Bozeman, 242 Mont. 436, 791 P.2d 767 (1990), the tort of\n\nbad faith breach of contract applies in “exceptional circumstances.” In order to state a\n\nclaim for bad faith breach of contract in the absence of specific statutory provisions, the\n\nplaintiff must show that the parties are in a “special relationship” to one another. To\n\ndelineate those special relationships, courts are to consider the following elements:\n\n               (1) the contract must be such that the parties are in inherently\n        unequal bargaining positions; [and] (2) the motivation for entering the\n        contract must be a non-profit motivation, i.e., to secure peace of mind,\n        security, future protection; [and] (3) ordinary contract damages are not\n        adequate because (a) they do not require the party in the superior position\n        to account for its actions, and (b) they do not make the inferior party\n        “whole”; [and] (4) one party is especially vulnerable because of the type of\n        harm it may suffer and of necessity places trust in the other party to\n        perform; and (5) the other party is aware of this vulnerability.\n\nStory, 242 Mont. at 451, 719 P.2d at 776 (quotation omitted, alterations in original).\n\n¶67     Prior to trial, Northwestern filed a motion to dismiss this claim, arguing that the\n\nRetirees had failed to establish a “special relationship” between themselves and\n\nNorthwestern. The District Court denied the motion, and ultimately instructed the jury\n\non the required elements under Story.         Northwestern did not object to this jury\n\ninstruction, move for judgment as a matter of law on this claim, or otherwise seek a new\n\ntrial based on a failure of evidence to support this claim. Nonetheless, on appeal\n\nNorthwestern relies upon Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, 1999 MT 288, 297 Mont.\n\n\n                                            29\n\f33, 991 P.2d 915, and asks this Court to exercise de novo review and conclude that the\n\nRetirees presented insufficient evidence to support the finding of a special relationship in\n\nthis case.\n\n¶68    The Retirees urge us not to consider this argument, since other than filing a\n\npretrial motion to dismiss this claim, Northwestern failed to preserve this issue in the\n\nDistrict Court, either during or after trial. We generally refuse to address issues raised for\n\nthe first time on appeal because it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for\n\nfailing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given an opportunity to consider. See In\n\nre A.C., 2004 MT 320, ¶ 16, 324 Mont. 58, 101 P.3d 761. Moreover, we have repeatedly\n\nheld that failure to object to jury instructions or a verdict form results in a waiver of the\n\nright to challenge them on appeal. Vader, ¶ 16 (citing Turk v. Turk, 2008 MT 45, ¶ 16,\n\n341 Mont. 386, 177 P.3d 1013). Since Northwestern failed to object to jury instructions\n\non the bad faith claim, and did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence for this claim\n\nat the trial level or in post-trial proceedings, we decline to consider this issue now on\n\nappeal.\n\n¶69    Issue Five: Did the District Court commit reversible error in allowing the jury to\n       consider the Retirees’ claims for emotional distress and instructing them on those\n       claims?\n\n¶70    In their complaint, the Retirees sought damages based on emotional distress\n\ncaused by the Defendants’ actions. The Defendants responded by moving for summary\n\njudgment on those claims.       The Defendants argued under Sacco v. High Country\n\nIndependent Press, Inc., 271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411 (1995), that the Retirees were\n\nrequired to make a showing of “serious or severe emotional distress” in order to recover\n\n\n                                             30\n\ffor emotional distress, and that they had failed to do so. The District Court ultimately\n\ndenied the motion, holding that the Defendants’ reliance on Sacco was misplaced because\n\nthe Sacco standard applied only to independent, stand-alone causes of action for\n\nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress. In this case, the Retirees presented\n\nseveral tort claims and sought recovery for emotional distress as an element of damages\n\narising from those claims. Accordingly, instead of relying on Sacco, the District Court\n\nrelied upon Johnson v. Supersave Markets, Inc., 211 Mont. 465, 686 P.2d 209 (1984) and\n\nthe 2003 edition of the Montana Pattern Jury Instructions (MPJI) to hold that the proper\n\nstandard for the emotional distress claims was whether Northwestern’s conduct resulted\n\nin a substantial invasion of a legally protected interest and caused a significant impact\n\nupon the person of the plaintiffs. The District Court therefore denied Northwestern’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on the emotional distress claims.\n\n¶71    During trial, Northwestern also moved for judgment as a matter of law on the\n\nRetirees’ emotional distress claims, advancing arguments nearly identical to those set\n\nforth in its summary judgment motion. The District Court denied this motion as well.\n\n¶72    During the settling of jury instructions, the District Court rejected several\n\nproposed jury instructions which would have required the Retirees to show “serious” or\n\n“severe” emotional distress pursuant to Sacco in order to prevail on their claims for\n\nemotional distress. Instead the District Court gave the following instruction:\n\n             Your award should include reasonable compensation for any mental\n       and emotional suffering and distress experienced by plaintiff and\n       reasonably probable to be experienced in the future.\n             Mental and emotional suffering and distress passes under various\n       names, such as mental anguish, nervous shock, or the like. It includes all\n\n\n                                            31\n\f       highly unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame,\n       humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, and\n       nausea.\n              The law does not set a definite standard by which to calculate\n       compensation for mental and emotional suffering and distress. Neither is\n       there any requirement that any witness express an opinion about the amount\n       of compensation that is appropriate for this kind of loss. The law does\n       require, however, that when making an award for mental and emotional\n       suffering and distress, you shall exercise calm and reasonable judgment.\n       The compensation must be just and reasonable.\n\n¶73    The Defendants argue the District Court erred in denying its various motions and\n\ninstructing the jury on the Retirees’ claims for mental and emotional suffering. The\n\nDefendants assert that under Sacco, the Retirees were required to prove that their\n\nemotional distress was “serious” or “severe” in order to present these claims to the jury.\n\nNorthwestern further argues that under First Bank (N.A.)—Billings v. Clark, 236 Mont.\n\n195, 771 P.2d 84 (1989), even derivative emotional distress claims must be severe, and\n\nthat the Retirees failed to meet this threshold. Northwestern argues that this “severe”\n\nstandard as articulated in First Bank remains relevant, and has been recently affirmed in\n\nMaloney v. Home and Inv. Ctr., Inc., 2000 MT 34, 298 Mont. 213, 994 P.2d 1124. The\n\nDefendants then recite the evidence relative to each of the Retirees adduced at trial, to\n\ndemonstrate that the evidence did not meet this threshold.          With the exception of\n\nChristensen and Van Gelder, the Defendants argue that the remaining Retirees mainly\n\npresented evidence of transient and trivial distress typical in the world of business\n\ntransactions, insufficient to support a claim for mental or emotional distress.\n\n¶74    The Retirees argue that they did in fact meet their evidentiary burden to present\n\nthese claims to the jury.     First, they argue that the Sacco standard applies only to\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\findependent negligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, and not to the\n\nderivative claims presented in their complaint, and that the District Court gave the correct\n\nMPJI on this issue.     Additionally, the Retirees argue that under Seltzer, this Court\n\naddressed the identical issue and held that the Sacco standard applies only to independent\n\nclaims of negligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, and not to the derivative\n\nclaims they have presented. Further, the Retirees maintain that they did present evidence\n\nof emotional distress suffered by each of them sufficient to support their claims.\n\n¶75    In reply, Northwestern argues that the Retirees’ reliance on Seltzer is misplaced,\n\nthat the MPJIs are not themselves the law, and that proper legal authority compels the\n\nconclusion that the jury was wrongly instructed.\n\n¶76    We recently addressed this very issue in Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co, 2009 MT\n\n248, 351 Mont. 464, ___ P.3d ___, in which we held that the MPJI properly state the\n\nthreshold required for derivative or parasitic (as opposed to stand-alone) emotional\n\ndistress claims.   Jacobsen, ¶ 66.    We stated that “the ‘serious or severe’ standard\n\nannounced in Sacco applies only to independent claims of negligent or intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.” Jacobsen, ¶ 66. Furthermore, we explicitly adopted the\n\nstandards set forth in the MPJIs at issue in the instant case for emotional distress claims\n\nas an element of damage of an underlying tort claim (i.e., parasitic emotional distress\n\ndamages). Jacobsen, ¶ 66.\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f¶77       Pursuant to our holding in Jacobsen,6 we conclude that the Retirees did present\n\nsufficient evidence to send their emotional distress claims to the jury and that the District\n\nCourt did not err in giving its instruction on these claims. While it is true that the\n\nRetirees suffered varying degrees of emotional distress as a result of the Defendants’\n\nactions, the quantum of proof as set forth under the MPJI on this claim was satisfied by\n\nthe evidence they presented. Therefore, we affirm on this issue.\n\n¶78       Issue Six: Was the jury’s verdict awarding tort damages supported by substantial\n          credible evidence?’\n\n¶79       As noted above, the jury awarded the Retirees approximately $17.5 million dollars\n\nin compensatory damages for the Defendants’ tortious conduct. When the jury retired for\n\ndeliberations, it was given separate verdict forms for each individual plaintiff. Each\n\nverdict form had seven questions.          Question 1 asked if Northwestern breached the\n\nparticular retiree’s contract. Question 2 inquired whether Northwestern breached that\n\ncontract in bad faith.       Question 3 asked whether any of the individual defendants\n\ntortiously interfered with that particular retiree’s contract. Question 4 inquired whether\n\nany of the Defendants committed an abuse of process against that particular retiree.\n\nQuestion 5 asked whether any of the Defendants committed malicious prosecution\n\nagainst that particular retiree. If the jury answered yes to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it was\n\nto determine an amount of money to award that particular retiree for damages caused by\n\nthe Defendants in Question 6. Question 7 then asked if any of the Defendants were liable\n\nfor punitive damages to that particular retiree. In other words, the verdict form did not\n\n\n6\n    Jacobson overruled both First Bank and Johnson regarding this issue.\n\n                                                 34\n\fsegregate damages based on each of the individual claims against the individual\n\ndefendants and Northwestern.\n\n¶80    Notably, the Defendants did not object to the verdict form, nor did they seek to\n\nhave damages apportioned by the jury based on each cause of action or claim. Given that\n\nthe Retirees presented claims for breach of contract, the tort of bad faith breach of\n\ncontract, tortious interference with contract, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution,\n\nit is simply impossible in retrospect for the Court to determine how or if the jury\n\napportioned damages among those various claims.\n\n¶81    As the Retirees note, we faced a nearly identical situation in Seltzer. In that case,\n\na plaintiff brought claims for the torts of malicious prosecution and abuse of process\n\nagainst an out-of-state law firm and other individuals. Seltzer, ¶ 1. During trial, the\n\nplaintiff presented evidence of emotional distress, harm to his personal and professional\n\nreputation, and damages for the expenses he incurred in defending himself. Seltzer, ¶ 97.\n\nThe jury ultimately rendered a multi-million dollar award in his favor.           Like the\n\nDefendants here, the defendants in Seltzer did not request a verdict form which\n\nspecifically apportioned damages based on the various claims. Nonetheless, on appeal\n\nthe Seltzer defendants challenged whether the jury’s award of compensatory damages\n\nwas supported by substantial credible evidence, and urged the Court to conclude that the\n\njury’s award simply represented compensation for emotional distress. Seltzer, ¶ 97. In\n\nconsidering this claim, we stated the following:\n\n       The jury’s verdict did not designate a separate amount of compensation\n       awarded for each of these three elements of damage; it merely listed one\n       amount rendered for all compensatory damages. Thus, it is impossible to\n\n\n                                            35\n\f       know how the jury apportioned the compensatory award with respect to\n       the three elements of damage, and we certainly will not speculate in this\n       regard. Accordingly, we reject the Defendants’ assertion that the\n       compensatory award represents compensation solely for emotional\n       distress.\n\nSeltzer, ¶ 97 (footnote omitted).\n\n¶82    In the case at bar, we similarly refuse to engage in speculation concerning how the\n\njury apportioned damages, and conclude that the jury’s award of compensatory damages\n\nwas supported by substantial credible evidence.\n\n¶83 Issue Seven: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ motions for\ndismissal and judgment as a matter of law as to defendants Drook, Hanson, Schrum,\nKovash, and Kliewer?\n\n¶84    Prior to trial, the Defendants moved to dismiss Drook, Schrum, Hanson, Kovash,\n\nand Kliewer, arguing that the individual defendants, acting as employees and officers of\n\nNorthwestern, could not be held personally liable for the acts of Northwestern\n\nCorporation. Citing to § 28-10-702(3), MCA, the Defendants asserted that personal\n\nliability for these defendants would lie only if they were found personally negligent or the\n\njury concluded that their actions were tortious in nature. The Defendants asserted that the\n\nRetirees failed to produce any evidence that the actions of the individual defendants met\n\nthis standard. Furthermore, the Defendants argued that the individual employees were\n\nacting within the course and scope of their employment and could not be held personally\n\nliable. The District Court denied the motion.\n\n¶85    During trial, the Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law with respect to\n\nthese defendants. The Defendants argued that the Retirees failed to produce any evidence\n\nthat Drook or Hanson took any action with respect to the Retirees or was involved in the\n\n\n                                            36\n\ffiling of any motions against them. Additionally, the Defendants asserted that while\n\nSchrum, Kliewer, and Kovash were involved in the corporate decision-making process\n\nwith respect to the Top Hat Contracts and bankruptcy litigation, they did nothing outside\n\nthe course and scope of their employment and did nothing malicious or untoward to any\n\nof the Retirees.\n\n¶86    After hearing a response and summary of the evidence from the Retirees, the\n\nDistrict Court denied the motion. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the\n\nRetirees, the District Court concluded that judgment as a matter of law would be\n\nimproper because the District Court did hear evidence concerning the presence of three of\n\nthe defendants at board meetings where issues related to the termination of the Top Hat\n\nContracts were discussed, and also heard evidence with respect to declarations that were\n\nfiled by the two other individually-named defendants. See Opinion, ¶ 15.\n\n¶87    The Defendants now appeal the denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. Relying upon Kuhns v. Scott, 259 Mont. 68, 853 P.2d 1200 (1993), and Bottrell v.\n\nAmerican Bank, 237 Mont. 1, 773 P.2d 694 (1989), the Defendants assert that in order to\n\nsustain individual liability against the defendants, there must be substantial credible\n\nevidence that each acted for his own pecuniary benefit and against the best interests of\n\nthe corporation, or that each acted outside the scope of his employment. Here, the\n\nDefendants assert that the Retirees failed to meet this burden.\n\n¶88    Northwestern argues that the key piece of evidence presented against Drook,\n\nHanson, and Schrum, was that the three of them attended a March 2004 meeting when\n\nNorthwestern’s board of directors voted to recommend rejection of all but one of the\n\n\n                                            37\n\fnon-qualified benefit plans. Northwestern asserts that the District Court relied on their\n\npresence at this meeting in denying the Defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. However, the individual defendants assert that their attendance at this meeting could\n\nnot have given rise to personal liability, because their participation in that meeting was\n\ndone in the best interest of the company and was not tortious in nature. Additionally, the\n\nDefendants argue that Drook and Hanson both testified that they were not actively\n\ninvolved in terminating the Top Hat Contracts. Similarly, the Defendants assert that\n\nSchrum was acting consistent with the interests of the corporation when he concurred in\n\nthe decision not to notify the Retirees about the board’s decision to terminate the Top Hat\n\nContracts until after the Plan had been filed in bankruptcy court, and that he relied on the\n\nlegal advice of Paul Hastings in agreeing to this decision.\n\n¶89    The Defendants also assert that Kovash and Kliewer were only named in the\n\nlawsuit because of documents they signed on behalf of Northwestern in the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings. The Defendants argue that this level of participation alone was insufficient\n\nto give rise to personal liability since they were acting upon legal advice consistent with\n\nthe best interests of Northwestern. Accordingly, the Defendants argue there was no\n\nevidence showing that any of these individual defendants acted for their own benefit, at\n\nodds with Northwestern’s interests, or with an intent to harm the Retirees.\n\n¶90    The Retirees assert that the motion for judgment as a matter of law was properly\n\ndenied by the District Court. Citing to Poulsen v. Treasure State Industries, Inc., 192\n\nMont. 69, 626 P.2d 822 (1981), and Crystal Springs Trout Co. v. First State Bank of\n\nFroid, 225 Mont. 122, 732 P.2d 819 (1987), the Retirees maintain that the proper\n\n\n                                             38\n\fquestion in this case is not whether the individual defendants were acting within the\n\ncourse of their agency, but whether they personally participated in tortious conduct.\n\nBecause the jury found all the individual defendants liable for both malicious prosecution\n\nand abuse of process, the Retirees argue that the District Court did not err in denying\n\ntheir motion for judgment as a matter of law on this claim.\n\n¶91    Contrary to the Defendants’ characterization of the record, the Retirees assert that\n\nDrook, Hanson, and Schrum all personally oversaw the efforts to illegally terminate the\n\nTop Hat Contracts and pursue litigation against the Retirees in bankruptcy court. The\n\nRetirees argue that the malicious intent of these individuals was established based on\n\ntheir participation in Northwestern’s decision to terminate the Top Hat Contracts without\n\ngiving them notice. Additionally, the Retirees argue that Kliewer and Kovash committed\n\nperjury by signing false declarations in bankruptcy court, with Kliewer specifically\n\nverifying the bankruptcy court complaint.          Finally, the Retirees maintain that these\n\ndefendants received “bonuses” for their misconduct from Northwestern. The Defendants\n\nreply by disputing the applicability of Poulsen, and arguing that under Phillips v. Mont.\n\nEduc. Assn., 187 Mont. 419, 610 P.2d 154 (1980), these individuals were shielded from\n\nliability if they were acting in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation.\n\n¶92    As we stated in Phillips,\n\n              Corporate officers or directors are privileged to interfere with or\n       induce breach of the corporation’s contracts or business relations with\n       others as long as their actions are in good faith and for the best interests of\n       the corporation. Where an officer or director acts against the best interests\n       of the corporation, acts for his own pecuniary benefit, or with the intent to\n       harm the plaintiff, he is personally liable.\n\n\n\n                                              39\n\fPhillips, 187 Mont. at 425, 610 P.2d at 158 (citations omitted); accord Bottrell, 237\n\nMont. at 25, 773 P.2d at 708-09. Similarly, in Crystal Springs Trout Co., we held that\n\ncorporate agents could be held personally liable if they were personally negligent or their\n\nactions were tortious in nature. Crystal Springs Trout Co., 225 Mont. at 129, 732 P.2d at\n\n823. “The personal nature of the agent’s actions forms the narrow exception to the\n\ngeneral policy that officers and agents of a corporation must be shielded from personal\n\nliability for acts taken on behalf of the corporation.” Crystal Springs Trout Co., 225\n\nMont. at 129, 732 P.2d at 823 (citing Little v. Grizzly Mfg., 195 Mont. 419, 636 P.2d 839,\n\n842 (1981)).\n\n¶93    Because this is an appeal from the District Court’s denial of judgment as a matter\n\nof law, our inquiry is whether there was a complete absence of any evidence which would\n\njustify submitting this issue to a jury. Vader, ¶ 20. Our role is not to pass judgment on\n\nwhich side’s evidence was more persuasive, or to otherwise place ourselves in the role of\n\nthe fact finder, as that is the province of the jury. Here, our review of the record\n\ndemonstrates that there was sufficient evidence to submit the Retirees’ tortious\n\ninterference with contract, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution claims against the\n\nindividual defendants to the jury. The jury was presented with testimony and evidence\n\narguably supporting the Retirees’ claims that the acts of the individual defendants were in\n\nbad faith or tortious in nature. The Retirees argued to the jury that the individually-\n\nnamed defendants were personally involved in the termination of the Top Hat Contracts\n\nand argued this conduct was tortious based on: (1) the fact the individual defendants\n\nratified a decision to wait until after bankruptcy proceedings had been initiated to inform\n\n\n                                            40\n\fthe Retirees of their intention to terminate the Top Hat Contracts; (2) the assertions that\n\nthis decision was not based on a cost-benefit analysis with respect to Northwestern; (3)\n\nthe manner in which those proceedings were initiated in bankruptcy court; and (4) the\n\nallegations that the termination of these Top Hat Contracts was clearly contrary to the\n\nterms of the UPA just negotiated by Northwestern and therefore contrary to law and\n\nwithout probable cause. Furthermore, the Retirees argued that the individually-named\n\ndefendants were “rewarded” for their actions by receiving large bonuses after\n\nreorganization, while the Top Hat Contracts were terminated.\n\n¶94   We conclude that the evidence before the court was sufficient to sustain the claims\n\nagainst the individually-named defendants, and that the District Court did not err in\n\ndenying the Defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law. From this evidence, the\n\njury could have concluded that the individual defendants conduct was tortious in nature\n\nand directed at the Retirees, or it could have concluded that this evidence did not support\n\nsuch a conclusion. In any event, this evidence was sufficient to survive a motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Moreover, the fact that the jury found these individual\n\ndefendants not liable for tortious interference with contracts or punitive damages, but did\n\nfind them liable for malicious prosecution and abuse of process, demonstrates that the\n\njury did not simply lump these individual defendants in with the acts of the corporate\n\ndefendant Northwestern, but instead individually considered their actions in relation to\n\neach claim based on the evidence before it.\n\n¶95   In his dissent, Justice Rice is critical of our resolution of this issue, which he\n\nargues “extensively broadens our law regarding the personal liability of corporate\n\n\n                                              41\n\femployees in order to affirm the imposition of personal liability here.” Dissent, ¶ 105.\n\nJustice Rice’s dissent raises valid concerns on the issue of when an agent is shielded from\n\npersonal liability for acts done in an official capacity and taken on behalf of a\n\ncorporation.      Our caselaw does not draw a bright line between tortious conduct\n\ncommitted by a corporate agent which subjects him to personal liability, and conduct\n\nwhich may cause another party damage, but is nonetheless not actionable in a personal\n\nsense due to the corporate presence. It is not our intent to broaden the law in this area in\n\nany regard. Instead, our holding here is simply based on the quantum of evidence\n\npresented to the jury and whether it was sufficient for the jury to infer tortious conduct on\n\nbehalf of the individual defendants. In this regard, we note that the Defendants never\n\nrequested a jury instruction to clarify for the jury the difference between conduct which is\n\ntortious in nature and gives rise to personal liability, and that which is taken on behalf of\n\na corporation and exempted from such liability. We leave any final pronouncements\n\nregarding this issue to a case in which these issues are fully and squarely before the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n¶96    Issue Eight: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ post-trial\n       motion to offset the judgment against the amount of the Retirees’ pre-trial\n       settlement with Paul Hastings?\n\n¶97    After judgment was entered in this case, the Defendants moved to offset the award\n\nof compensatory damages based on Paul Hastings’ pre-trial settlement with the Retirees.\n\nThe District Court denied both a motion to reveal the confidential settlement and to grant\n\nthe offset. In its order, the District Court explained that an offset was unavailable under\n\nMontana law because Northwestern and the individual defendants were found liable for\n\n\n                                             42\n\fintentional torts, and offsets are available under Montana law only in cases of\n\ncomparative negligence. Moreover, the District Court noted that the Defendants had\n\nagreed to a verdict form which did not lend itself to a precise comparison of the injuries\n\nthe jury found were apportioned among the Defendants and Paul Hastings, thus leaving\n\nunanswered whether the concerted action of the Defendants and Paul Hastings caused a\n\nsingle, indivisible harm to each of the Retirees.\n\n¶98    The Defendants now appeal the denial of their post-trial motion to offset the award\n\nof compensatory damages. They argue that they are entitled to a pro tanto offset against\n\nthe amount of the pre-trial settlement with Paul Hastings under Montana law. We\n\ndisagree. As a practical matter, it is virtually impossible for this Court to determine the\n\nextent to which Paul Hastings bears any liability for the tortious conduct which the jury\n\nfound was committed by the Defendants. As noted by the District Court, the verdict form\n\ndoes not apportion liability among the Defendants and Paul Hastings, or provide any\n\nguidance as to whether the conduct of Paul Hastings resulted in any harm to the Retirees,\n\nmuch less a single, indivisible harm. Yet, as the Defendants themselves note, a pro tanto\n\noffset such as they are now seeking is permitted only if they can show that Paul Hastings,\n\nas a concurrent or joint tortfeasor, caused the Retirees a single “indivisible harm” in\n\nconcert with the Defendants. See Schuff v. A.T. Klemens & Son, 2000 MT 357, ¶ 104,\n\n303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002.\n\n¶99    Even further, the verdict form gives no indication as to how or if the jury\n\napportioned damages among the claims for breach of contract, and the torts of bad faith\n\nbreach of contract, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process; thus, we would have to\n\n\n                                             43\n\fengage in gross speculation were we to assess how the award of damages corresponds to\n\nthe jury’s finding of liability on each of the Retiree’s claims, and what percentage of\n\nthose damages should be theoretically attributed to the actions of Paul Hastings. In short,\n\nthe Defendants ask this Court to untangle and dissect the jury’s verdict without any\n\nfactual basis upon which to do so. Because the verdict form was used without objection,\n\nwe cannot and will not now second guess the jury’s allocation of damages.\n\n¶100 Finally, we note that in Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of the United\n\nStates, 276 Mont. 1, 914 P.2d 976 (1996), we held that there is no statutory basis in\n\nMontana for an offset of damages arising from the commission of intentional torts. See\n\nCartwright, 276 Mont. at 36, 914 P.2d at 998. Therefore, we decline to disturb the\n\nDistrict Court’s denial of the post-trial motion.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶101 We affirm the jury’s verdict and the various rulings of the District Court before,\n\nduring and after trial. However, we grant the request made by the Defendants to remand\n\nthe judgment in this case to the District Court so that it can be reduced by the amount of\n\npayments Northwestern has been making to the Retirees under the terms of their Top Hat\n\nContracts since the judgment in this matter was originally entered.         Affirmed and\n\nremanded.\n\n\n                                                       /S/ PATRICIA O. COTTER\n\n\n\n\n                                             44\n\fWe concur:\n\n/S/ KATHERINE M. IRIGOIN\nDistrict Court Judge Katherine M. Irigoin\nsitting for Chief Justice Mike McGrath\n\n/S/ W. WILLIAM LEAPHART\n\n\n/S/ JAMES C. NELSON\n\n/S/ JULIE MACEK\nDistrict Court Judge Julie Macek\nsitting for Justice Brian Morris\n\n\n\n\nJustice Jim Rice, dissenting.\n\n¶102 I dissent from the Court’s resolution of Issues 2 and 7, and would remand for a\n\nnew trial.\n\n¶103 Under Issue 2, the Court announces a new rule—that “advice-of-counsel, when\n\nused as an affirmative defense at trial, must be pled as such under the requirements of M.\n\nR. Civ. P. 8(c).” Opinion, ¶ 54. Thus, the Court has overruled McGuire’s holding that\n\nthe advice-of-counsel defense “may be shown under a general denial in the answer.”\n\nMcGuire, 184 Mont. at 413, 603 P.2d at 256 (quoting Materson v. Pig’n Whistle Corp.,\n\n326 P.2d 918, 929 (Cal. App. 1958)). While I concur with this conclusion, I believe it is\n\nunfair to Northwestern to change a previously clear rule which was in effect and upon\n\nwhich it relied during the litigation. Under McGuire, the District Court incorrectly ruled\n\n\n                                            45\n\fthat Northwestern had waived the defense and was not entitled to so instruct the jury. I\n\nbelieve Northwestern was prejudiced thereby. The Court reasons that Northwestern was\n\nnot harmed because the District Court allowed Northwestern to present evidence\n\nconcerning its reliance upon its counsel’s advice to defend against the allegation it acted\n\nin bad faith. However, such evidence must be admitted in any event in support of a\n\ngeneral denial of the claim. The definition of probable cause we have adopted from the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 675 (1977) for malicious prosecution cases is satisfied\n\nwhen a defendant reasonably believes that the claim he pursued was valid under\n\napplicable law “in reliance upon the advice of counsel.” Hughes v. Lynch, 2007 MT 177,\n\n¶ 16, 338 Mont. 214, 164 P.3d 913. Thus, such evidence must be admitted in the course\n\nof proving or denying the proof of a malicious prosecution claim.\n\n¶104 Northwestern wanted, and I believe was entitled to, more—an instruction that\n\nreliance upon advice of counsel could be a complete defense to the claim. Indeed, the\n\nRetirees used the counsel defense as a basis to both request that Hastings be added as a\n\ndefendant and to seek discovery of privileged documents. As a result, the District Court\n\ngranted Retirees’ motion to amend the complaint and also granted their motion to compel\n\ndiscovery of materials that would otherwise be protected by the attorney-client and work-\n\nproduct privileges. The privileged documents sought by Retirees were certainly relevant\n\nto their malicious prosecution claim, as they had to prove that Northwestern lacked\n\nprobable cause to file the bankruptcy action. However, after permitting the additional\n\nclaim and the discovery to support the additional claim, the District Court barred\n\nNorthwestern from raising the actual defense—which Northwestern was not required to\n\n\n                                            46\n\faffirmatively plead under McGuire. I believe Northwestern was unfairly constrained in\n\nthe ability to defend itself and would order a new trial.\n\n¶105 I also dissent with the Court’s resolution of Issue 7, which I believe extensively\n\nbroadens our law regarding the personal liability of corporate employees in order to\n\naffirm the imposition of personal liability here.       Our cases illustrate, and we have\n\ninstructed, that “[t]he personal nature of the agent’s actions forms the narrow exception\n\nto the general policy that officers and agents of a corporation must be shielded from\n\npersonal liability for acts taken on behalf of the corporation.” Crystal Springs Trout Co.\n\nv. First St. Bank, 225 Mont. 122, 129, 732 P.2d 819, 823 (1987) (emphasis added) (citing\n\nLittle v. Grizzly Mfg., 195 Mont. 419, 636 P.2d 839 (1981)). The corporate officers’\n\nactions in this case did not exceed the scope of their employment, and did not trigger this\n\nnarrow exception.\n\n¶106 In Bottrell v. Am. Bank, 237 Mont. 1, 12-14, 773 P.2d 694, 701-02 (1989), the\n\nbank, under the direction of its officers, wrongfully exercised its right to setoff of a note\n\nnot yet due and payable, before making any demand of the borrower for payment, as\n\nrequired under the terms of the note. The plaintiffs suffered lost profits as a result of the\n\nbank’s actions. Bottrell, 273 Mont. at 22, 773 P.2d at 707. We held the officers could\n\nnot be held personally liable for these obvious errors, explaining:\n\n       [T]he actions of officers Beaton and Derrig were not on behalf of\n       themselves as individuals or for their own pecuniary benefit, nor were their\n       actions against the best interests of the corporation for which they were\n       employed. They acted within the scope of their employment, and in\n       furtherance of corporate interest. As such, they are entitled to the\n       protection of the corporate shield from personal liability.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\fBottrell, 237 Mont. at 25, 773 P.2d at 708.\n\n¶107 Likewise, in Kuhns v. Scott, 259 Mont. 68, 74, 853 P.2d 1200, 1204 (1993), the\n\nplaintiffs contended the CEO of First Interstate Bancsystem of Montana, Inc., (FIBM)\n\nmaliciously caused FIBM to breach its duties under the stock purchase agreement\n\nbetween the parties. We rejected plaintiffs’ assertions that the CEO had failed to increase\n\nFIBM’s capital and obtain the FIBM Board’s approval of the stock purchase for the\n\nreason that his personal interest in the bank’s ownership would have been diluted by\n\ndoing so. Kuhns, 237 Mont. at 74, 853 P.2d at 1204. We held that in order to establish a\n\nclaim against the CEO, the plaintiffs “would have to show that [the CEO] had acted for\n\nhis own pecuniary benefit and against the best interests of the corporation (FIBM); or that\n\nhe had acted outside the scope of his employment.” Kuhns, 259 Mont. at 74-75, 853 P.2d\n\nat 1204 (citing Bottrell, 237 Mont. at 25, 773 P.2d at 708). We reasoned that plaintiffs’\n\nassertions about the CEO’s ownership interest were speculative and the lack of evidence\n\nabout a personal benefit or that he had acted against FIBM’s best interests warranted the\n\nentry of summary judgment. Kuhns, 259 Mont. at 75, 853 P.2d at 1204-05.\n\n¶108 In cases where we have reached the opposite result, our decisions turned on\n\nsubstantial evidence demonstrating the employees had knowingly made false and\n\nmisleading statements or taken fraudulent actions. As the Court notes, it is the “personal\n\nnature” of these agents’ actions that permitted the agents to be held personally liable for\n\nthe actions they took on behalf of the corporation. Opinion, ¶ 91. In Crystal Springs\n\nTrout Co., 225 Mont. at 128, 732 P.2d at 822, 823, the president and primary shareholder\n\nof the First State Bank repeatedly lied about filing a loan application with the FmHA,\n\n\n                                              48\n\fabout banks he had contacted, and about the status of plaintiffs’ financing. We described\n\nthe officer’s conduct as “intentional and very personal,” citing the conclusion of the trial\n\ncourt:\n\n         The conduct of defendant [bank president], acting at all times as agent of\n         the First State Bank of Froid and with the acquiescence and tacit approval\n         of the directors of the bank, constituted willful and wanton misconduct\n         consisting of conscious breach of trust and fiduciary duty, intentional\n         deception, flagrant breach of the ethical cannons [sic] of both the legal and\n         banking profession, a studied and extended course of fraudulent\n         misrepresentation and knowing betrayal of a lifetime friendship, all with\n         reckless disregard for the rights and interest of the plaintiffs herein,\n         unjustified by any circumstance and “malicious” and “oppressive” within\n         the meaning of those terms as applied in the law of torts.\n\nCrystal Springs Trout Co., 225 Mont. at 129, 732 P.2d at 823.\n\n¶109 In Poulsen v. Treasure St. Indus., 192 Mont. 69, 72, 75, 626 P.2d 822, 824-25\n\n(1981), the president of Treasure State Industries, Inc., made clearly untruthful statements\n\nabout the company’s compliance with health regulations to plaintiffs, who were looking\n\nto purchase the concrete block plant operated by the company, and thereby induced\n\nplaintiffs to purchase the plant. We held that the president was personally liable because\n\nhis individual acts were fraudulent, meeting all of the elements of actual fraud. Poulsen,\n\n192 Mont. at 79, 82, 626 P.2d at 828-29.\n\n¶110 The Retirees’ allegations that the individual defendants tortiously a participated in\n\nthe termination of the Top Hat Contracts during the bankruptcy court process are directed\n\nto actions clearly within the scope of the defendant’s employment.             There is no\n\nsubstantial evidence, as in Crystal Springs and Poulsen, that these corporate officers\n\nmade false statements, acted fraudulently, or acted in pursuit of personal gain. The jury\n\n\n\n                                              49\n\ffound that the officers were not liable for tortious interference with the contracts.\n\nFurther, there is no evidence that the bonuses, which the Retirees assert is proof of the\n\nofficers’ personal pecuniary gain, were linked to the decision to terminate the contracts.\n\nThe bonuses were provided to the officers for their role in guiding Northwestern through\n\nits reorganization and emergence as a new entity, in accordance with common business\n\npractices.   Perhaps in the times we now live such common corporate practices are\n\npopularly thought to be inappropriate. Nonetheless, without more, these bonuses do not\n\nconstitute a basis for personal liability under our precedent. The evidence is that these\n\nrewards were given for the officers’ actions on behalf of the company. Thus, Retirees’\n\ntheory that the officers personally benefitted directly from the Top Hat situation requires\n\nthe same sort of speculation we rejected as insufficient in Kuhns. The evidence does not\n\ndemonstrate that Retirees’ claims fit within the “narrow exception” to the general rule\n\nagainst personal liability. Crystal Springs Trout Co., 225 Mont. at 129, 732 P.2d at 823.\n\nNothing close to what we condemned at length in Crystal Springs Trout Co. occurred\n\nhere.\n\n¶111 I would enter judgment in favor of the individual defendants on the claim of\n\npersonal liability and remand for a new trial.\n\n\n                                                  /S/ JIM RICE\n\nJustice John Warner joins the dissent of Justice Jim Rice.\n\n\n                                                  /S/ JOHN WARNER\n\n\n\n\n                                             50\n\f",

We affirm the jury’s verdict.\n\n                      PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUD\n\n¶2       Lester E. Ammondson (Ammondson), Sherwood Christensen (Christensen),\n\nW.

Daniel Regan (Regan), Allen T. Smith (Smith), George A. Thorson (Thorson), John B.\n\nVan Gelder (Van Gelder), Wilhelmus C. Verbael (Verbael), and James Couture\n\n(Couture)1 (collectively Retirees), were all former employees of the Montana Power\n\nCompany (MPC), a Montana-based public utility company. These individuals had been\n\nemployed with MPC for periods ranging from 3 to 40 years. Each of these plaintiffs left\n\nMPC after entering into separate agreements with MPC which provided them monthly\n\npayments to supplement their regular retirement plans. The agreements were known as\n\n“Top Hat Contracts,” a term derived from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\n1\n    Catherine Couture, the surviving spouse of James Couture, represented him in this suit.\n\n                                                  3\n\fThe combined value of these individual Top Hat Contracts was approximately $2.9\n\nmillion dollars.\n\n¶3     Northwestern is a Delaware corporation that currently operates as a public utility\n\nin Montana. In 2002, Northwestern purchased MPC’s transmission and distribution\n\nassets. Northwestern hired the law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, LLP (Paul\n\nHastings) to facilitate the purchase. In the course of its purchase of MPC, Northwestern\n\nassumed responsibility for the Top Hat Contracts in a unit purchase agreement (UPA),\n\nwhich specifically stated that Northwestern would maintain and be responsible for all\n\ncurrent and future obligations of MPC as they related to any supplemental pension\n\nbenefit or benefit replacement restoration plan, program, or individual agreement which\n\nhad been maintained by MPC.\n\n¶4     In September 2003, Northwestern filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in United\n\nStates Bankruptcy Court in the Federal District of Delaware. The Paul Hastings law firm\n\ncontinued to provide Northwestern with legal representation during this time. When it\n\nfiled for bankruptcy, Northwestern had several thousand potential creditors.            In\n\nbankruptcy proceedings, Northwestern reviewed the contracts held by these creditors to\n\ndetermine if it would assume or reject them. If the contracts were assumed, their terms\n\nwould be honored; if they were rejected, then the holders of those contracts would\n\nbecome general unsecured creditors and likely receive general, unsecured stock in the\n\nreorganized Northwestern. Northwestern did not provide notice to the holders of the Top\n\nHat Contracts that it would reject their contracts during bankruptcy and seek to treat them\n\nas general, unsecured creditors. Instead, Northwestern continued to pay the Retirees\n\n\n                                            4\n\funder the terms of the Top Hat Contracts throughout bankruptcy proceedings in\n\nDelaware.\n\n¶5     On October 19, 2004, the bankruptcy court confirmed Northwestern’s Chapter 11\n\nbankruptcy reorganization plan (Plan). The effective date of the Plan was November 1,\n\n2004, at which time Northwestern officially emerged from bankruptcy as a reorganized\n\nentity. On December 30, 2004, Northwestern filed a notice of substantial confirmation of\n\nthe Plan in Federal District Court in Delaware.\n\n¶6     On January 1, 2005, Northwestern, without giving any prior notice to any of the\n\nRetirees, ceased making payments to them under the Top Hat Contracts.2 Although some\n\nof the Retirees immediately contacted Northwestern in an attempt to discover why their\n\npayments had stopped, Northwestern failed to provide them with any answers.                On\n\nJanuary 26, 2005, Kovash, who was Northwestern’s director of benefits, informed the\n\nRetirees in writing that it had discontinued payment under their Top Hat Contracts in\n\nconnection with its plan of reorganization.        Furthermore, Northwestern advised the\n\nRetirees that it anticipated filing a motion in bankruptcy court to terminate the Top Hat\n\nContracts and that upon receipt of the motion, the Retirees should contact a legal advisor.\n\n¶7     On January 31, 2005, Northwestern filed a motion to terminate the Top Hat\n\nContracts in bankruptcy court in the Federal District of Delaware. After the filing of the\n\nmotion in bankruptcy court, the Retirees were able to obtain Montana counsel, the\n\nEdwards Law Firm of Billings, to represent them in this matter. The Edwards Law Firm\n\n2\n  Of all the plaintiffs in this case, only Van Gelder was listed in bankruptcy proceedings as a\nparty to an executory contract. However, Van Gelder, like all the other plaintiffs, was never\ngiven any notice that Northwestern intended to terminate his Top Hat Contract.\n\n                                              5\n\fin turn hired local counsel in Delaware to represent the Retirees in federal bankruptcy\n\ncourt.     On March 31, 2005, the Retirees filed an objection and response to\n\nNorthwestern’s motion to terminate the Top Hat Contracts. The Retirees sought to have\n\nNorthwestern’s motion dismissed on the grounds that the bankruptcy court did not have\n\njurisdiction to entertain the motion since none of the Retirees had been listed as secured\n\nor unsecured creditors prior to Northwestern’s reorganization during bankruptcy\n\nproceedings. Additionally, the Retirees counterclaimed against Northwestern for breach\n\nof contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and abuse of process.\n\n¶8       On March 31, 2005, the Retirees also filed a claim for compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages against Northwestern, Drook, Hanson, Schrum, Kovash, and Kliewer in the\n\nSecond Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County.         This state complaint was later\n\namended to add Paul Hastings as a defendant based on its actions in advising\n\nNorthwestern in federal bankruptcy court proceedings against the Retirees. In the state\n\ncomplaint, the Retirees alleged that these defendants had committed breach of contract,\n\nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with contracts,\n\nabuse of process, and fraudulent conduct, by virtue of their actions in stopping payment\n\nunder the Top Hat Contracts without notice, and then filing a motion to terminate those\n\ncontracts in bankruptcy court after Northwestern had already finalized its reorganization\n\nunder Chapter 11. The day prior to filing the state complaint, counsel for the Retirees\n\nnotified Northwestern’s counsel in writing as to the contents of the complaint and its\n\nintent to file suit in Montana, but also stated that he would hold off on serving the\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fcomplaint on Northwestern until the bankruptcy court in Delaware had an opportunity to\n\nrule on the Retirees’ response to Northwestern’s motion to terminate.\n\n¶9    On April 25, 2005, Northwestern filed a complaint against the Retirees in federal\n\nbankruptcy court in Delaware. In the complaint, Northwestern named itself as a plaintiff,\n\nand each of the Retirees as defendants. Contemporaneously, Northwestern also filed a\n\nmotion for an order to show cause against the Retirees, and sought a preliminary\n\ninjunction against their action in state court in Montana. Pursuant to Northwestern’s\n\nmotion, the Delaware federal bankruptcy court, Hon. John L. Peterson presiding, issued\n\nan order to show cause against the Retirees, and stayed all state court proceedings until\n\nthe bankruptcy court could rule on the matter.\n\n¶10   On May 3, 2005, Judge Peterson held a hearing on the pending motions and\n\ncomplaint before the bankruptcy court.       Both Northwestern and the Retirees were\n\nrepresented by counsel, with some of the Retirees flying from Montana to attend the\n\nproceedings. The next day, Judge Peterson issued his ruling, dismissing Northwestern’s\n\nmotion to terminate and concluding that the bankruptcy court was without jurisdiction to\n\nentertain Northwestern’s motion. In his written order, Judge Peterson noted that on\n\nDecember 30, 2004, Northwestern had filed a notice with the bankruptcy court of\n\n“substantial consummation of the Plan, meaning all matters required to be done under the\n\nPlan, and pursuant to the Plan, had been accomplished. Nowhere are the claims of the\n\n[Retirees] recognized as affecting consummation or implementation of the Plan.” Judge\n\nPeterson further observed that specific language in the confirmed Plan contemplated that\n\nany disputes relating to issues concerning contractual and fiduciary duties owed by\n\n\n                                            7\n\fNorthwestern to other parties (such as the Top Hat Contracts and corresponding duties\n\nowed to the Retirees by Northwestern) would be resolved in a forum outside of federal\n\nbankruptcy court. Third, Judge Peterson noted that under the Plan Northwestern was\n\nrequired to make appropriate filings in bankruptcy court if it wished to reject any\n\nexecutory contracts during bankruptcy proceedings—a             provision    with     which\n\nNorthwestern obviously failed to comply since it did not give any notice to the Retirees\n\nuntil after it emerged from Chapter 11 as a reorganized entity. Reflecting on this fact,\n\nJudge Peterson then held as follows:\n\n              The single fact of the matter is quite significant. None of the\n      [Retirees] were afforded due process, in that none were served with\n      rejection notices of their executory contracts in accordance with\n      [Northwestern’s] Plan, even though, alarmingly, [Northwestern], in its\n      Motion to terminate the pension benefits, acknowledged the MPC purchase\n      agreement . . . as to the pension agreements “constitutes a legal, valid and\n      binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms of MPC” that\n      [Northwestern] “shall maintain and shall be responsible for . . . all current\n      and future obligations of MPC . . . under any supplemental pension benefit\n      or benefit replacement or restoration plan, program or individual\n      agreement maintained by MPC . . . .” The Motion then correctly asserts\n      that “no individual who is a party to an MPC agreement has filed a proof\n      of claim against the Debtor.” Yet, [Northwestern] now wants to reject\n      each individual agreement that it assumed and became liable to pay, at this\n      late date, beyond the bar date [Northwestern] established in the Plan, as an\n      executory contract, where, absolutely no notice or pleading was ever\n      served upon any of the [Retirees] prior to confirmation. . . .\n              Simply stated, these [Retirees] have not been afforded due process,\n      by notice, or any other form in the [Northwestern] Plan reorganization\n      effort. To now cast upon each of the [Retirees] a jurisdictional premise\n      before this Court in light of the above is simply beyond any standard of\n      timely fairness and notice, which this Court cannot tolerate or condone.\n\n¶11   Taking notice of the fact that the Retirees had filed a complaint in state District\n\nCourt, Judge Peterson held there was no jurisdiction over the Top Hat Contracts in\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\ffederal bankruptcy court, and deemed that in the interests of justice the bankruptcy court\n\nwould abstain in favor of the state court action in Montana. Northwestern subsequently\n\nfiled an appeal from Judge Peterson’s ruling, but then voluntarily dismissed that appeal at\n\na later date.\n\n¶12    Once the matter was returned to the Second Judicial District Court, the Retirees\n\nsought a jury trial on their claims and the parties went through an extensive motion\n\npractice prior to trial. In November 2005, Northwestern resumed paying the Retirees\n\npursuant to their Top Hat Contracts, and paid them back payments due with interest.\n\nPrior to trial, Paul Hastings settled with the Retirees for an undisclosed amount and was\n\nsubsequently dismissed from the suit.\n\n¶13    Prior to and during trial, the District Court issued rulings related to the availability\n\nof certain defenses to Northwestern, the admissibility of evidence, Northwestern’s\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law on some of the Retirees’ claims, and the jury\n\ninstructions. As necessary, we will discuss the District Court’s rulings on these issues\n\nbelow. The jury trial began on February 12, 2007, and concluded with a jury verdict in\n\nthe Retirees’ favor on February 22, 2007. During the course of the trial, the jury heard\n\nfrom the Retirees, as well as Catherine Couture, testifying about their involvement in\n\nthese events and how they were emotionally and mentally impacted by the actions of the\n\nDefendants. The jury also heard, either through live testimony or deposition, from the\n\nindividually named defendants, Paul Hastings’ attorneys, Ford Elsaesser (Elsaesser), a\n\nqualified expert on bankruptcy law, Wade Dahood (Dahood), a Montana attorney who\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fwas qualified to render an expert opinion on the Defendants’ and Paul Hastings’ conduct,\n\nand an economist presented by the Retirees in support of their claims for damages.\n\n¶14      Through the testimony of these various witnesses and numerous documents\n\n(including many of the internal communications among Northwestern, Paul Hastings, and\n\ntheir agents, employees, and officers), the jury was presented with two different versions\n\nof the events surrounding the termination of the Top Hat Contracts and the initiation of\n\nproceedings against the Retirees in federal bankruptcy court. The Retirees portrayed the\n\nDefendants’ actions as a course of illegal and malicious conduct directed against them.\n\nThey asserted that Northwestern’s general counsel, Thomas Knapp (Knapp), ordered the\n\ntermination of the contracts and filings in bankruptcy court against the legal advice of\n\nPaul Hastings, whose attorneys had opined that this course of action was not legally\n\nsupportable. The Retirees claimed that Northwestern and its counsel knew that the Top\n\nHat Contracts were valid and binding, yet went on to represent to the federal bankruptcy\n\ncourt the opposite. Furthermore, the Retirees argued that the economic cost of the Top\n\nHat Contracts was to be borne by the rate payers, and not Northwestern directly, and that\n\nit was disingenuous for Northwestern to represent to the bankruptcy court that\n\nterminating the contracts was in the best interests of the corporation; yet, in the face of\n\nthis evidence, Knapp, Northwestern, and its officers and agents, moved to terminate the\n\nTop Hat Contracts and initiate proceedings against the Retirees in federal bankruptcy\n\ncourt.\n\n¶15      In this connection, the Retirees presented testimony from Dahood and Elsaesser to\n\nsupport their argument that the bankruptcy proceedings and related actions were without\n\n\n                                             10\n\flegal basis. Dahood also testified about the costs incurred by the Retirees in defending\n\nagainst the Defendants’ claims. Elsaesser opined that an affidavit signed by Kovash,\n\nwherein he represented to the bankruptcy court that the Top Hat Contracts were not valid,\n\nlegal, or binding agreements, was a false and misleading statement made to the\n\nbankruptcy court. Additionally, Elsaesser testified that a sworn declaration filed by\n\nKliewer, Northwestern’s controller, wherein he claimed that the Retirees were unsecured\n\ncreditors, was an absolutely false statement and another misrepresentation to the\n\nbankruptcy court.\n\n¶16   As to the corporate decision to terminate the Top Hat Contracts and commence\n\nlitigation in bankruptcy court, the Retirees presented evidence and argument to support\n\ntheir claims that these actions were tortious in nature as well. They argued that the\n\nbankruptcy court filings and other actions taken by Northwestern against the Retirees,\n\nwere done with the intent to make them accept a settlement more favorable to\n\nNorthwestern. The Retirees argued that Northwestern sought to leverage them into\n\ngiving up their legitimate claims under their contracts and instead accept shares of stock\n\nin the newly reorganized Northwestern corporation—an action which none of the\n\nRetirees wished to take. In this connection, the Retirees presented evidence concerning\n\nthe participation of Drook, Hanson and Schrum in the corporate decisions to terminate\n\nthe Top Hat Contracts and initiate what the Retirees term Northwestern’s “malicious\n\nlawsuit” in bankruptcy court. The Retirees claim that these decisions, and the acts of the\n\nindividual defendants in performing them, constituted tortious conduct for which both\n\nNorthwestern, and the individual defendants, could be held liable.\n\n\n                                           11\n\f¶17   The Defendants, by contrast, painted these events as actions taken in the best\n\ninterests of Northwestern without any malice or tortious intent towards the Retirees.\n\nNorthwestern claimed that the Top Hat Contracts were among many other non-qualified\n\nbenefit plans that its financial and legal advisors reviewed during bankruptcy in order to\n\nevaluate their administrative costs and value to the corporation. Northwestern admits that\n\nit terminated the Top Hat Contracts without timely notice to the Retirees, but asserted\n\nthat this action, and the subsequent related proceedings in bankruptcy court, did not\n\namount to tortious conduct against the Retirees. Instead, it basically argued that its\n\nmistake was in the timing of its decision to terminate the contracts, and its failure to\n\nprovide proper notice. Northwestern further pointed out that it resumed payments to the\n\nRetirees in November 2005, and paid them back payments with interest. Through the\n\ntestimony of Judge Peterson, counsel for Paul Hastings, Knapp, Kovash, and Kliewer, the\n\nDefendants presented this defense against the Retirees’ claims.\n\n¶18   In its verdict rendered on February 22, 2007, the jury found Northwestern liable\n\nfor breach of contract, the tort of bad faith breach of contract, abuse of process, and\n\nmalicious prosecution. It also found Northwestern liable for punitive damages. With\n\nrespect to the individual defendants Drook, Hanson, Schrum, Kovash, and Kliewer, the\n\njury found them liable only for abuse of process and malicious prosecution, and not liable\n\nfor punitive damages. The jury further found the Defendants collectively not liable on\n\nthe tortious interference of contract claims. As a result of the verdict, the jury awarded\n\nthe Retirees as a whole approximately $17.5 million dollars in compensatory damages,\n\nwith individual amounts apportioned to each individual Retiree. The following day the\n\n\n                                           12\n\fpunitive damages phase of the trial was held, and the same jury returned a verdict of\n\n$4 million dollars in punitive damages against Northwestern.\n\n¶19    Judgment was entered by the District Court on March 5, 2007.               After the\n\njudgment, the Defendants filed various post-trial motions seeking to offset the damages\n\nagainst the pre-trial settlement entered into by Paul Hastings, and also seeking to reduce\n\nthe judgment by the amount of the ongoing payments Northwestern was still making to\n\nthe Retirees. These motions were denied by the District Court.\n\n¶20    The Defendants now appeal the jury’s verdict, as well as various rulings of the\n\nDistrict Court before, during, and after trial. We state the issues presented by their appeal\n\nas follows:\n\n¶21    Issue One:      Were the Retirees’ claims completely preempted by federal\n\nbankruptcy law and did the District Court lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider\n\nthose claims?\n\n¶22    Issue Two: Did the District Court err by denying the Defendants the opportunity\n\nto present an advice-of-counsel defense to the Retirees’ claims?\n\n¶23    Issue Three: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on the Retirees’ abuse of process claim?\n\n¶24    Issue Four: Should the judgment on the Retirees’ bad faith claim be reversed?\n\n¶25    Issue Five: Did the District Court commit reversible error in allowing the jury to\n\nconsider the Retirees’ claims for emotional distress and instructing them on those\n\nclaims?\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f¶26    Issue Six: Was the jury’s verdict awarding tort damages supported by substantial\n\ncredible evidence?\n\n¶27    Issue Seven: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ motions for\n\ndismissal and judgment as a matter of law as to defendants Drook, Hanson, Schrum,\n\nKovash, and Kliewer?\n\n¶28    Issue Eight: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ post-trial\n\nmotion to offset the judgment against the amount of the Retirees’ pre-trial settlement with\n\nPaul Hastings?\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶29    We review a district court’s conclusions on questions of law to determine if those\n\nconclusions are correct.

Although this\n\nissue has not been previously raised or pled as an affirmative defense during the course of\n\nthese proceedings, the Defendants nonetheless argue that it merits consideration because\n\nchallenges to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including for the first\n\ntime on appeal.\n\n¶35      While we agree with the Defendants that challenges to subject matter jurisdiction\n\nmay be considered for the first time on appeal, see Stanley v. Lemire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"887469\"><a href=\"/opinion/887469/stanley-v-lemire/\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n¶¶ 29-32, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, given the procedural posture of this case and the\n\nprevious rulings by the federal bankruptcy court, we find this argument wholly devoid of\n\nmerit.    Judge Peterson specifically found that the federal bankruptcy court lacked\n\n\n                                            15\n\fjurisdiction under federal bankruptcy laws over Northwestern’s motion to terminate since\n\nNorthwestern’s bankruptcy plan had already been consummated. In fact, Judge Peterson\n\nwent so far as to characterize Northwestern’s attempt to invoke the federal jurisdiction of\n\nthe bankruptcy court as “simply beyond any standard of timely fairness and notice, which\n\nthis Court cannot tolerate or condone.”\n\n¶36    Northwestern initially appealed this ruling, but then apparently dismissed its\n\nappeal of its own accord. Now, several years later, the Defendants ask this Court to\n\nreturn jurisdiction to the very federal court which has already determined that it lacked\n\njurisdiction, thus leaving the Retirees’ claims in a legal limbo with federal and state\n\ncourts both refusing to exercise jurisdiction over these claims. The implications of this\n\nargument defy common sense and logic, and are nothing short of Kafkaesque.\n\n¶37    Additionally, it is patently obvious that Northwestern is collaterally estopped from\n\nasserting a federal jurisdiction argument at this stage in the proceedings since the issue of\n\nfederal jurisdiction was already decided by Judge Peterson, and Northwestern was party\n\nto this prior, final adjudication.

In the Retirees’ complaint, they\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\falleged that Defendants’ actions were done with the assent and assistance of\n\nNorthwestern’s agent Paul Hastings, and resulted in the commission of various torts\n\nagainst the Retirees.\n\n¶40    In its response to these claims, the Defendants presented a general denial, but did\n\nnot plead advice of counsel as an affirmative defense. Prior to trial, the Defendants\n\nproposed the following jury instruction:\n\n              Montana law provides that reliance upon the advice of counsel,\n        provided in good faith and based upon a full and fair statement of the facts\n        by the client, is a complete affirmative defense to an action for malicious\n        prosecution.\n\n¶41    On the morning of trial, the Retirees orally presented to the District Court a\n\nmotion in limine seeking to preclude Northwestern from presenting the affirmative\n\ndefense of reliance on advice of counsel at trial.3            The Retirees argued that the\n\nDefendants could not present such a defense since they did not affirmatively plead it in\n\ntheir responsive pleadings. The Defendants argued against the Retirees’ motion. The\n\nDistrict Court did not make a definitive ruling on the motion at that time.\n\n¶42    On February 16, 2007, during the Retirees’ case-in-chief, but before the\n\nDefendants presented their defense, the District Court entertained further argument on the\n\nRetirees’ motion. The Retirees argued that the Defendants could not present this defense\n3\n  In a previous motion for summary judgment, the Retirees had sought to preclude the\nDefendants from raising any affirmative defenses based on the propriety of Paul Hastings’\nconduct in federal bankruptcy court. The Retirees asserted that Judge Peterson had essentially\nruled on the propriety of Paul Hastings’ conduct in the bankruptcy action when it dismissed that\naction and returned jurisdiction over the Retirees’ claims to state court in Montana. The District\nCourt denied the motion at the time, holding that there remained genuine issues of material fact\non Paul Hastings’ conduct in bankruptcy proceedings as it related to the Retirees’ claims.\nHowever, the District Court had not previously ruled on the extent to which the Defendants\ncould rely upon Paul Hastings’ conduct as an affirmative defense to the claims against them.\n\n                                               17\n\fdue to their failure to plead it, and because they had already conceded that they would not\n\nbe able to assert an “empty chair” defense against Paul Hastings. The Retirees noted that\n\nthe Defendants had never filed a cross-claim against Paul Hastings at any point in the\n\nproceedings.    In response, the Defendants asserted that they had not waived the\n\naffirmative defense of advice of counsel under the authority of McGuire v. Armitage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"876804\"><a href=\"/opinion/876804/mcguire-v-armitage/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979). They asserted that under McGuire, the affirmative\n\ndefense of advice of counsel does not need to be affirmatively pleaded, but instead can be\n\nraised in a general denial. The Defendants further asserted that that their reliance on the\n\nadvice of Paul Hastings was relevant to the issue of causation and intent.\n\n¶43    The District Court issued a ruling that same day, denying in part and granting in\n\npart the Retirees’ motion. In its written order, the District Court held that the Defendants\n\ncould not argue to the jury that their reliance on the advice of counsel constituted a valid\n\ndefense to the Retirees’ causes of action, but allowed the Defendants to present evidence\n\nas to the substance of Paul Hastings’ legal advice. The District Court advanced two\n\ngrounds for its decision. First, it concluded that the Defendants had failed to raise advice\n\nof counsel as an affirmative defense in their response to the complaint as required by the\n\nMontana Rules of Civil Procedure.         Second, it concluded that Northwestern, as a\n\ncorporate entity, is held vicariously liable through the acts of its directors, officers,\n\nemployees and agents, and that it simply could not, as a matter of law, rely on advice of\n\ncounsel as an affirmative defense, given it is ultimately responsible for the actions of its\n\ncounsel as an agent of the corporation.\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\f¶44    The District Court did conclude that the presentation of evidence as to the\n\nsubstance of Paul Hastings’ communication and advice would be permitted as it would\n\ngo to the heart of the causation and intent elements involved in the tort claims raised by\n\nthe Retirees. As an example, the District Court noted that claims for punitive damages\n\nand malicious prosecution require a showing from the plaintiff that the defendant acted\n\nwith either actual malice or actual fraud (in the case of punitive damages claims), or that\n\nthe defendant was motivated by malice (in the case of malicious prosecution). The\n\nsubstance and advice of Paul Hastings’ legal counsel would be relevant in helping the\n\njury to assess whether Northwestern or its agents met these mental state requirements.\n\nAs stated by the District Court,\n\n               The Court concludes that the substance of counsel’s\n       communications and advice to the Northwestern Defendants concerning\n       their legal relationship with the Plaintiffs is relevant to the issue of whether\n       the Defendants acted with actual malice or actual fraud in causing harm to\n       the Plaintiffs. The Court also notes that the Plaintiffs’ bankruptcy expert\n       witness [Elsaesser] already has testified that he could not find any evidence\n       in the corporate communications where any of the bankruptcy attorneys\n       advised the Northwestern Defendants to stop the supplemental benefit\n       payments to the Plaintiffs. Should communications or advice to the\n       contrary exist, such evidence would go to the credibility of witnesses.\n\n¶45    Furthermore, the District Court noted that it would ultimately instruct the jury that\n\na corporation acts through, and is responsible for, the conduct of its officers, employees,\n\nand agents, and that evidence as to the advice of counsel under these circumstances\n\nwould go towards evaluating Defendants’ intent in engaging in the conduct at issue when\n\nthey acted against the Retirees.\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f¶46    During the settling of jury instructions, the District Court refused the Defendants’\n\ninstruction on advice of counsel as an affirmative defense on the grounds in its ruling on\n\nthe Retirees’ motion in limine.\n\n¶47    The Defendants now argue that these rulings from the District Court were in error\n\nand should be reversed. Relying primarily upon McGuire, and Stephens v. Conley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1914), as well as the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, the\n\nDefendants assert that advice of counsel may be raised by a general denial, as was done\n\nin this case, and then later be asserted as a complete and affirmative defense. The\n\nDefendants argue that the District Court’s failure to allow this affirmative defense\n\nsubstantially prejudiced them at trial. When combined with the jury instruction that\n\nNorthwestern was responsible for the acts of its legal counsel, the Defendants argue that\n\nthe District Court’s rulings effectively amounted to a directed verdict for the Retirees.\n\nFurthermore, Northwestern asserts that the evidence it presented supports the argument\n\nthat it acted in good faith and reliance upon Paul Hastings’ advice in filing its motions in\n\nbankruptcy court. For these reasons, the Defendants argue that the judgment against\n\nthem must be reversed and a new trial ordered since the jury was denied the opportunity\n\nto consider this defense.\n\n¶48    In response, the Retirees begin by asserting that Northwestern waived the right to\n\npresent this affirmative defense. They also argue that at the hearing on the motion in\n\nlimine as well as during the trial, Northwestern basically conceded to the District Court\n\nthat, under principles of agency law, it would be responsible for the actions of Paul\n\nHastings. In the final pretrial order, Northwestern in fact conceded it could not assert an\n\n\n                                            20\n\f“empty chair” defense against Paul Hastings, and that Paul Hastings’ actions would be\n\nprobative on the issue of causation for the Retirees’ damages. The Retirees also maintain\n\nthat Northwestern’s failure to object to the District Court’s jury instruction that it is\n\n“responsible for the actions of its directors, officers, employees and agents” further\n\nprecludes Northwestern from arguing advice of counsel as an affirmative defense under\n\nthe facts of this case. Finally, the Retirees assert that Northwestern’s advice-of-counsel\n\ndefense was simply not supported by the record, and that Northwestern and the individual\n\ndefendants in fact disregarded Paul Hastings’ legal advice when they took action against\n\nthe Retirees.\n\n¶49    The Defendants’ appeal of this issue presents two separate questions:           first,\n\nwhether the District Court abused its discretion in its order on the Retirees’ motion in\n\nlimine; and second, whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying the\n\nproposed jury instruction on the advice-of-counsel defense.\n\n¶50    In McGuire, the case relied upon by the Defendants, we stated the following\n\nconcerning the advice-of-counsel defense:\n\n              Reliance upon the advice of counsel, provided it is given in good\n       faith and is based upon a full and fair statement of the facts by the client,\n       may afford the latter a complete defense to an action for malicious\n       prosecution. But it is an affirmative defense. It may be shown under a\n       general denial in the answer, but the burden of establishing it is upon the\n       defendant.\n\nMcGuire, 184 Mont. at 412-13, 603 P.2d at 256 (emphasis in original, quotation and\n\nalterations omitted). Contrary to the Defendants’ characterization of McGuire, this case\n\ndid not state unequivocally that advice of counsel is an absolute defense to a claim of\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fmalicious prosecution. Instead, McGuire recognized that advice of counsel may afford a\n\ncomplete defense, provided the defendant satisfies its burden of establishing it.\n\n¶51    In its ruling on the motion in limine, the District Court held that Northwestern was\n\nunable to present advice of counsel as an affirmative defense due to its failure to raise it\n\nas such in its responsive pleadings as required under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). See e.g. Winslow\n\nv. Mont. Rail Link, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"887189\"><a href=\"/opinion/887189/winslow-v-montana-rail-link-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 38, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There is\n\nsimply no question that reliance upon advice of counsel is a matter of avoidance, and this\n\nbeing so, it clearly falls under the clear provisions of M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) (“In pleading to a\n\npreceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively . . . any other matter constituting\n\nan avoidance or affirmative defense.”).\n\n¶52    In this case, the Defendants did not concede at any point in the litigation that the\n\nRetirees may have an otherwise viable cause of action for malicious prosecution—to be\n\naverted by the affirmative defense of advice of counsel—as is typical of the classic\n\naffirmative defense situation. Rather, they responded in their answer and throughout the\n\nlitigation with an assertion that they had acted in good faith at all times. Thus, in\n\nprohibiting advice of counsel as an affirmative defense, the District Court did not gut the\n\nDefendants’ case at all, as it permitted the Defendants to fully argue that they acted in\n\ngood faith and without malice. In other words, the District Court’s ruling allowed the\n\nDefendants to refute the malicious prosecution claim consistent with the response in their\n\nanswer—i.e., their general denial of the allegations of malice. See Stephens, 48 Mont. at\n\n369-71, 138 P. at 193-94 (discussing the ability of a defendant to rebut a claim of\n\nmalicious prosecution via general denial); see also McGuire, 184 Mont. at 412-13, 603\n\n\n                                             22\n\fP.2d at 256. Because the Defendants were permitted to present all available evidence\n\nshowing that they had acted in good faith without malice, including evidence of the\n\nsubstance of Paul Hastings’ advice and their actions in relying (or not relying) upon it,\n\nthey were not at all powerless to defend themselves. Moreover, we agree with the\n\nRetirees that the Defendants’ concession that they could not assert an “empty chair”\n\ndefense against Paul Hastings, further undermines their ability to turn around and assert\n\nadvice-of-counsel as an affirmative defense at trial. Under these circumstances, we\n\ntherefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in its ruling on the\n\nmotion in limine.\n\n¶53    In the settling of jury instructions, the District Court rejected the advice-of-counsel\n\njury instruction on the same grounds expressed in its ruling on the motion in limine. The\n\ndenial of this jury instruction did not constitute an abuse of discretion, both in light of the\n\nanalysis above and because the jury instructions as a whole fairly and full apprised the\n\njury of the applicable law. English, ¶ 39. The jury was instructed that in order to prove\n\nmalicious prosecution, the Retirees had to show, among other things, that the Defendants\n\nacted with malice, and that there was no probable cause for their actions. The jury heard\n\nthe Defendants’ evidence and argument that they acted in good faith, but apparently did\n\nnot find this evidence and argument credible, and concluded that the Retirees had in fact\n\nestablished their claims for malicious prosecution.4\n\n\n4\n  In this regard, it is worth noting that the Defendants were not prohibited from seeking a jury\ninstruction to expressly inform the jury that a showing of good faith by the Defendants would\ndefeat a claim for malicious prosecution. The Defendants presented evidence and argument that\ntheir conduct was in good faith, but did not seek a corresponding jury instruction. Instead, they\n\n                                               23\n\f¶54    Given the circumstances here presented, we conclude that the District Court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying the Defendants’ proposed instruction on its advice-of-\n\ncounsel defense, or in its pre-trial and trial rulings related to this defense in the context of\n\nthe Retirees’ claims.\n\n¶55    Additionally, we take this opportunity to prospectively declare that advice-of-\n\ncounsel, when used as an affirmative defense at trial, must be pled as such under the\n\nrequirements of M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). In its order, the District Court, citing to Brown v.\n\nEhlert, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"882374\"><a href=\"/opinion/882374/brown-v-ehlert/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), noted that the essence of an affirmative\n\ndefense is the concession by the defendant that while a plaintiff may have a viable cause\n\nof action, liability may be nonetheless avoided by the defendant based on some statute or\n\nrule. See Brown, 255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514. As the Court stated in Brown,\n\n       The rationale for requiring that these defenses be affirmatively pleaded is\n       simple: the same principles of fairness and notice which require a plaintiff\n       to set forth the basis of the claim require a defendant to shoulder a\n       corresponding duty to set out not merely general denials as appropriate,\n       but also those specific defenses not raised by general denials by which a\n       defendant seeks to avoid liability, rather than merely to controvert\n       plaintiff’s factual allegations.\n\nBrown, 255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514; accord, Burns v.

R. Civ. P. 8(c). The legal basis\n\n\n\nsought only a blanket jury instruction on advice-of-counsel as a complete, affirmative defense\nthat would apply equally both to Northwestern and the individually-named defendants.\n\n                                              24\n\ffor this argument obviously derives from the language in McGuire cited above. Opinion,\n\n¶ 50.    While a surface reading of this language would suggest that the normal\n\nrequirements of affirmative defenses under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) are somehow suspended in\n\nthe context of malicious prosecution claims, an examination of the authority from which\n\nthis language in McGuire derives demonstrates that this statement is actually a vestige\n\nfrom the days of code pleading, and simply does not trump the well-settled requirements\n\nof M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) and controlling case law. McGuire relies upon a 1958 case from\n\nCalifornia, Masterson v. Pig’n Whistle Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 929 (Cal. 1958). The\n\nauthority for this proposition in Masterson finds its ultimate origin in the 1870 case of\n\nLevy v. Brannan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 1870) as well as Stephens, which was decided in\n\n1914.5 Rule 8(c), and the requirement to affirmatively plead avoidance defenses were\n\nadopted in Montana in 1964. Of necessity, M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) would supersede any\n\nprevious rule of practice from an earlier era which would allow a defendant to invoke a\n\nmatter of avoidance such as advice-of-counsel as an affirmative defense without pleading\n\nit as such.\n\n¶57     We therefore hold that advice-of-counsel, when used as an affirmative defense,\n\nmust be pled in accordance with M. R. Civ. P 8(c). We therefore expressly overrule\n\nMcGuire to the extent it can be read to the contrary. This rule will apply prospectively to\n\nall situations in which a party wishes to rely upon this defense.\n\n¶58     Issue Three: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ motion for\n        judgment as a matter of law on the Retirees’ abuse of process claim?\n\n5\n Masterson relies upon Walker v.

As the Defendants correctly observe, abuse of process\n\nrequires the plaintiff show both “(1) an ulterior purpose and (2) a willful act in the use of\n\nprocess not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding.” Hughes v. Lynch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"887967\"><a href=\"/opinion/887967/hughes-v-lynch/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 21, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quotation omitted). Furthermore, in order to\n\nsupport an abuse of process claim, the plaintiff must show that there was “an attempt by\n\nthe plaintiff to use process to coerce the defendant to do some collateral thing which he\n\ncould not be legally and regularly compelled to do.” Lynch, ¶ 21 (quotation omitted).\n\nHere, the Defendants claim that such evidence was wholly lacking, and that there was no\n\nevidence presented showing that the bankruptcy proceedings were used for any purpose\n\nother than to adjudicate the resolution of the Retirees’ Top Hat Contracts in bankruptcy\n\ncourt. Accordingly, the Defendants argue there was insufficient evidence to submit this\n\nclaim to the jury and that their motion for judgment as a matter of law on this claim\n\nshould have been granted.\n\n¶60    Additionally, the Defendants maintain that the District Court erred in giving the\n\nfollowing jury instruction relative to the abuse of process claim: “The filing of a lawsuit\n\nin a forum which the party knows to be wrong constitutes an abuse of process.” The\n\nDefendants assert that this jury instruction is a misstatement of the law, and that it\n\nprejudiced them, practically amounting to a directed verdict, by allowing the jury to find\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fthem liable based solely on the fact that the bankruptcy court decided to transfer the\n\nRetirees’ claims back to Montana.\n\n¶61   The Retirees maintain that the District Court did not err in denying this motion or\n\nin giving its jury instruction on this claim. With respect to the jury instruction, the\n\nRetirees maintain that it was adopted verbatim from Leasing, Inc. v. Discovery Ski Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988), and that it has not been disturbed by subsequent\n\ndecisions. With respect to the evidence on this claim in general, the Retirees maintain\n\nthat they provided sufficient evidence to support it.      First, they point to evidence\n\npresented at trial that Paul Hastings had advised Northwestern that the bankruptcy\n\nmotions were “legally weak,” and that the Top Hat Contracts should have been honored.\n\nSecond, they assert that Northwestern did in fact use the bankruptcy proceedings in an\n\neffort to obtain a collateral advantage against them. In this connection they point to\n\ninternal communications among Northwestern, its agents, and Paul Hastings obtained\n\nduring discovery indicating that the bankruptcy motions were devised by Northwestern to\n\ngain a tactical advantage over the Retirees, compelling them to be more willing to give up\n\ntheir claims against Northwestern. The Retirees also point out that Judge Peterson found\n\nNorthwestern’s various filings to be wholly without merit, and questioned their\n\nlegitimacy.\n\n¶62   In order to prevail on a motion for judgment as a matter of law on the abuse of\n\nprocess claim, the Defendants must show “a complete absence of any evidence which\n\nwould justify submitting an issue to a jury.” Vader, ¶ 20. The Defendants have failed to\n\ncarry this burden. The jury was presented with more than sufficient evidence, including\n\n\n                                           27\n\finternal emails and corporate communications, as well as the testimony of Paul Hastings’\n\nattorneys, Northwestern’s corporate executive agents, and Judge Peterson himself, upon\n\nwhich to decide the abuse of process claims. While the jury was certainly not required to\n\nbelieve such evidence and testimony, the quantum and quality of such evidence was more\n\nthan sufficient to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n¶63    Turning to the challenged jury instruction, we conclude that the District Court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in giving it. First, we agree with the Retirees that this instruction\n\nwas an accurate statement of the law under Leasing, Inc., wherein we held that filing a\n\ncomplaint in a forum which a party knows to be improper constitutes an abuse of process.\n\nSee Leasing, Inc., 235 Mont. at 136, 765 P.2d at 177-78. In that case, one party to a\n\ncontract dispute filed suit in Granite County which was clearly improper under the plain\n\nterms of the contract which required that any contract disputes be handled in Lewis and\n\nClark County. Leasing, Inc., 235 Mont. at 135-36, 765 P.2d at 177-78. Under those\n\ncircumstances, attempting to resolve the dispute in Granite County constituted an abuse\n\nof process.\n\n¶64    In subsequent decisions such as Lynch and Seltzer v. Morton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888090\"><a href=\"/opinion/888090/seltzer-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888090\"><a href=\"/opinion/888090/seltzer-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we have discussed in greater detail the elements and\n\nrequirements for an abuse of process claim. However, we have never explicitly overruled\n\nor abrogated our decision in Leasing, Inc. More importantly, both Seltzer and Lynch\n\nwere decided after the jury proceedings had concluded in this case. Thus, we cannot say\n\nit was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to rely upon Leasing, Inc. at the time it\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fsettled jury instructions in this case. Thus, we affirm the District Court on this issue as\n\nwell.\n\n¶65     Issue Four: Should the judgment on the Retirees’ bad faith claim be reversed?\n\n¶66     The jury found that Northwestern breached the Retirees’ contracts in bad faith.

To\n\ndelineate those special relationships, courts are to consider the following elements:\n\n               (1) the contract must be such that the parties are in inherently\n        unequal bargaining positions; [and] (2) the motivation for entering the\n        contract must be a non-profit motivation, i.e., to secure peace of mind,\n        security, future protection; [and] (3) ordinary contract damages are not\n        adequate because (a) they do not require the party in the superior position\n        to account for its actions, and (b) they do not make the inferior party\n        “whole”; [and] (4) one party is especially vulnerable because of the type of\n        harm it may suffer and of necessity places trust in the other party to\n        perform; and (5) the other party is aware of this vulnerability.\n\nStory, 242 Mont. at 451, 719 P.2d at 776 (quotation omitted, alterations in original).\n\n¶67     Prior to trial, Northwestern filed a motion to dismiss this claim, arguing that the\n\nRetirees had failed to establish a “special relationship” between themselves and\n\nNorthwestern.

The Defendants responded by moving for summary\n\njudgment on those claims.       The Defendants argued under Sacco v. High Country\n\nIndependent Press, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"883677\"><a href=\"/opinion/883677/sacco-v-high-country-independent-press/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), that the Retirees were\n\nrequired to make a showing of “serious or severe emotional distress” in order to recover\n\n\n                                             30\n\ffor emotional distress, and that they had failed to do so. The District Court ultimately\n\ndenied the motion, holding that the Defendants’ reliance on Sacco was misplaced because\n\nthe Sacco standard applied only to independent, stand-alone causes of action for\n\nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress. In this case, the Retirees presented\n\nseveral tort claims and sought recovery for emotional distress as an element of damages\n\narising from those claims. Accordingly, instead of relying on Sacco, the District Court\n\nrelied upon Johnson v. Supersave Markets, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"878435\"><a href=\"/opinion/878435/johnson-v-supersave-markets-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984) and\n\nthe 2003 edition of the Montana Pattern Jury Instructions (MPJI) to hold that the proper\n\nstandard for the emotional distress claims was whether Northwestern’s conduct resulted\n\nin a substantial invasion of a legally protected interest and caused a significant impact\n\nupon the person of the plaintiffs. The District Court therefore denied Northwestern’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on the emotional distress claims.\n\n¶71    During trial, Northwestern also moved for judgment as a matter of law on the\n\nRetirees’ emotional distress claims, advancing arguments nearly identical to those set\n\nforth in its summary judgment motion. The District Court denied this motion as well.\n\n¶72    During the settling of jury instructions, the District Court rejected several\n\nproposed jury instructions which would have required the Retirees to show “serious” or\n\n“severe” emotional distress pursuant to Sacco in order to prevail on their claims for\n\nemotional distress. Instead the District Court gave the following instruction:\n\n             Your award should include reasonable compensation for any mental\n       and emotional suffering and distress experienced by plaintiff and\n       reasonably probable to be experienced in the future.\n             Mental and emotional suffering and distress passes under various\n       names, such as mental anguish, nervous shock, or the like. It includes all\n\n\n                                            31\n\f       highly unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame,\n       humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, and\n       nausea.\n              The law does not set a definite standard by which to calculate\n       compensation for mental and emotional suffering and distress. Neither is\n       there any requirement that any witness express an opinion about the amount\n       of compensation that is appropriate for this kind of loss. The law does\n       require, however, that when making an award for mental and emotional\n       suffering and distress, you shall exercise calm and reasonable judgment.\n       The compensation must be just and reasonable.\n\n¶73    The Defendants argue the District Court erred in denying its various motions and\n\ninstructing the jury on the Retirees’ claims for mental and emotional suffering. The\n\nDefendants assert that under Sacco, the Retirees were required to prove that their\n\nemotional distress was “serious” or “severe” in order to present these claims to the jury.\n\nNorthwestern further argues that under First Bank (N.A.)—Billings v. Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"880536\"><a href=\"/opinion/880536/first-bank-na-billings-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), even derivative emotional distress claims must be severe, and\n\nthat the Retirees failed to meet this threshold. Northwestern argues that this “severe”\n\nstandard as articulated in First Bank remains relevant, and has been recently affirmed in\n\nMaloney v. Home and Inv. Ctr., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"885553\"><a href=\"/opinion/885553/maloney-v-home-and-investment-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"885553\"><a href=\"/opinion/885553/maloney-v-home-and-investment-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The\n\nDefendants then recite the evidence relative to each of the Retirees adduced at trial, to\n\ndemonstrate that the evidence did not meet this threshold.          With the exception of\n\nChristensen and Van Gelder, the Defendants argue that the remaining Retirees mainly\n\npresented evidence of transient and trivial distress typical in the world of business\n\ntransactions, insufficient to support a claim for mental or emotional distress.\n\n¶74    The Retirees argue that they did in fact meet their evidentiary burden to present\n\nthese claims to the jury.     First, they argue that the Sacco standard applies only to\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\findependent negligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, and not to the\n\nderivative claims presented in their complaint, and that the District Court gave the correct\n\nMPJI on this issue.     Additionally, the Retirees argue that under Seltzer, this Court\n\naddressed the identical issue and held that the Sacco standard applies only to independent\n\nclaims of negligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, and not to the derivative\n\nclaims they have presented. Further, the Retirees maintain that they did present evidence\n\nof emotional distress suffered by each of them sufficient to support their claims.\n\n¶75    In reply, Northwestern argues that the Retirees’ reliance on Seltzer is misplaced,\n\nthat the MPJIs are not themselves the law, and that proper legal authority compels the\n\nconclusion that the jury was wrongly instructed.\n\n¶76    We recently addressed this very issue in Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888928\"><a href=\"/opinion/888928/jacobsen-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888928\"><a href=\"/opinion/888928/jacobsen-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ___ P.3d ___, in which we held that the MPJI properly state the\n\nthreshold required for derivative or parasitic (as opposed to stand-alone) emotional\n\ndistress claims.   Jacobsen, ¶ 66.    We stated that “the ‘serious or severe’ standard\n\nannounced in Sacco applies only to independent claims of negligent or intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.” Jacobsen, ¶ 66. Furthermore, we explicitly adopted the\n\nstandards set forth in the MPJIs at issue in the instant case for emotional distress claims\n\nas an element of damage of an underlying tort claim (i.e., parasitic emotional distress\n\ndamages). Jacobsen, ¶ 66.\n\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f¶77       Pursuant to our holding in Jacobsen,6 we conclude that the Retirees did present\n\nsufficient evidence to send their emotional distress claims to the jury and that the District\n\nCourt did not err in giving its instruction on these claims. While it is true that the\n\nRetirees suffered varying degrees of emotional distress as a result of the Defendants’\n\nactions, the quantum of proof as set forth under the MPJI on this claim was satisfied by\n\nthe evidence they presented. Therefore, we affirm on this issue.\n\n¶78       Issue Six: Was the jury’s verdict awarding tort damages supported by substantial\n          credible evidence?’\n\n¶79       As noted above, the jury awarded the Retirees approximately $17.5 million dollars\n\nin compensatory damages for the Defendants’ tortious conduct. When the jury retired for\n\ndeliberations, it was given separate verdict forms for each individual plaintiff. Each\n\nverdict form had seven questions.          Question 1 asked if Northwestern breached the\n\nparticular retiree’s contract. Question 2 inquired whether Northwestern breached that\n\ncontract in bad faith.       Question 3 asked whether any of the individual defendants\n\ntortiously interfered with that particular retiree’s contract. Question 4 inquired whether\n\nany of the Defendants committed an abuse of process against that particular retiree.\n\nQuestion 5 asked whether any of the Defendants committed malicious prosecution\n\nagainst that particular retiree. If the jury answered yes to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it was\n\nto determine an amount of money to award that particular retiree for damages caused by\n\nthe Defendants in Question 6. Question 7 then asked if any of the Defendants were liable\n\nfor punitive damages to that particular retiree. In other words, the verdict form did not\n\n\n6\n    Jacobson overruled both First Bank and Johnson regarding this issue.\n\n                                                 34\n\fsegregate damages based on each of the individual claims against the individual\n\ndefendants and Northwestern.\n\n¶80    Notably, the Defendants did not object to the verdict form, nor did they seek to\n\nhave damages apportioned by the jury based on each cause of action or claim. Given that\n\nthe Retirees presented claims for breach of contract, the tort of bad faith breach of\n\ncontract, tortious interference with contract, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution,\n\nit is simply impossible in retrospect for the Court to determine how or if the jury\n\napportioned damages among those various claims.\n\n¶81    As the Retirees note, we faced a nearly identical situation in Seltzer. In that case,\n\na plaintiff brought claims for the torts of malicious prosecution and abuse of process\n\nagainst an out-of-state law firm and other individuals. Seltzer, ¶ 1. During trial, the\n\nplaintiff presented evidence of emotional distress, harm to his personal and professional\n\nreputation, and damages for the expenses he incurred in defending himself. Seltzer, ¶ 97.\n\nThe jury ultimately rendered a multi-million dollar award in his favor.           Like the\n\nDefendants here, the defendants in Seltzer did not request a verdict form which\n\nspecifically apportioned damages based on the various claims. Nonetheless, on appeal\n\nthe Seltzer defendants challenged whether the jury’s award of compensatory damages\n\nwas supported by substantial credible evidence, and urged the Court to conclude that the\n\njury’s award simply represented compensation for emotional distress. Seltzer, ¶ 97. In\n\nconsidering this claim, we stated the following:\n\n       The jury’s verdict did not designate a separate amount of compensation\n       awarded for each of these three elements of damage; it merely listed one\n       amount rendered for all compensatory damages. Thus, it is impossible to\n\n\n                                            35\n\f       know how the jury apportioned the compensatory award with respect to\n       the three elements of damage, and we certainly will not speculate in this\n       regard. Accordingly, we reject the Defendants’ assertion that the\n       compensatory award represents compensation solely for emotional\n       distress.\n\nSeltzer, ¶ 97 (footnote omitted).\n\n¶82    In the case at bar, we similarly refuse to engage in speculation concerning how the\n\njury apportioned damages, and conclude that the jury’s award of compensatory damages\n\nwas supported by substantial credible evidence.\n\n¶83 Issue Seven: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ motions for\ndismissal and judgment as a matter of law as to defendants Drook, Hanson, Schrum,\nKovash, and Kliewer?\n\n¶84    Prior to trial, the Defendants moved to dismiss Drook, Schrum, Hanson, Kovash,\n\nand Kliewer, arguing that the individual defendants, acting as employees and officers of\n\nNorthwestern, could not be held personally liable for the acts of Northwestern\n\nCorporation. Citing to § 28-10-702(3), MCA, the Defendants asserted that personal\n\nliability for these defendants would lie only if they were found personally negligent or the\n\njury concluded that their actions were tortious in nature. The Defendants asserted that the\n\nRetirees failed to produce any evidence that the actions of the individual defendants met\n\nthis standard. Furthermore, the Defendants argued that the individual employees were\n\nacting within the course and scope of their employment and could not be held personally\n\nliable. The District Court denied the motion.\n\n¶85    During trial, the Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law with respect to\n\nthese defendants. The Defendants argued that the Retirees failed to produce any evidence\n\nthat Drook or Hanson took any action with respect to the Retirees or was involved in the\n\n\n                                            36\n\ffiling of any motions against them. Additionally, the Defendants asserted that while\n\nSchrum, Kliewer, and Kovash were involved in the corporate decision-making process\n\nwith respect to the Top Hat Contracts and bankruptcy litigation, they did nothing outside\n\nthe course and scope of their employment and did nothing malicious or untoward to any\n\nof the Retirees.\n\n¶86    After hearing a response and summary of the evidence from the Retirees, the\n\nDistrict Court denied the motion. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the\n\nRetirees, the District Court concluded that judgment as a matter of law would be\n\nimproper because the District Court did hear evidence concerning the presence of three of\n\nthe defendants at board meetings where issues related to the termination of the Top Hat\n\nContracts were discussed, and also heard evidence with respect to declarations that were\n\nfiled by the two other individually-named defendants.

Here, the\n\nDefendants assert that the Retirees failed to meet this burden.\n\n¶88    Northwestern argues that the key piece of evidence presented against Drook,\n\nHanson, and Schrum, was that the three of them attended a March 2004 meeting when\n\nNorthwestern’s board of directors voted to recommend rejection of all but one of the\n\n\n                                            37\n\fnon-qualified benefit plans. Northwestern asserts that the District Court relied on their\n\npresence at this meeting in denying the Defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. However, the individual defendants assert that their attendance at this meeting could\n\nnot have given rise to personal liability, because their participation in that meeting was\n\ndone in the best interest of the company and was not tortious in nature. Additionally, the\n\nDefendants argue that Drook and Hanson both testified that they were not actively\n\ninvolved in terminating the Top Hat Contracts. Similarly, the Defendants assert that\n\nSchrum was acting consistent with the interests of the corporation when he concurred in\n\nthe decision not to notify the Retirees about the board’s decision to terminate the Top Hat\n\nContracts until after the Plan had been filed in bankruptcy court, and that he relied on the\n\nlegal advice of Paul Hastings in agreeing to this decision.\n\n¶89    The Defendants also assert that Kovash and Kliewer were only named in the\n\nlawsuit because of documents they signed on behalf of Northwestern in the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings. The Defendants argue that this level of participation alone was insufficient\n\nto give rise to personal liability since they were acting upon legal advice consistent with\n\nthe best interests of Northwestern. Accordingly, the Defendants argue there was no\n\nevidence showing that any of these individual defendants acted for their own benefit, at\n\nodds with Northwestern’s interests, or with an intent to harm the Retirees.\n\n¶90    The Retirees assert that the motion for judgment as a matter of law was properly\n\ndenied by the District Court.

Vader, ¶ 20. Our role is not to pass judgment on\n\nwhich side’s evidence was more persuasive, or to otherwise place ourselves in the role of\n\nthe fact finder, as that is the province of the jury. Here, our review of the record\n\ndemonstrates that there was sufficient evidence to submit the Retirees’ tortious\n\ninterference with contract, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution claims against the\n\nindividual defendants to the jury. The jury was presented with testimony and evidence\n\narguably supporting the Retirees’ claims that the acts of the individual defendants were in\n\nbad faith or tortious in nature. The Retirees argued to the jury that the individually-\n\nnamed defendants were personally involved in the termination of the Top Hat Contracts\n\nand argued this conduct was tortious based on: (1) the fact the individual defendants\n\nratified a decision to wait until after bankruptcy proceedings had been initiated to inform\n\n\n                                            40\n\fthe Retirees of their intention to terminate the Top Hat Contracts; (2) the assertions that\n\nthis decision was not based on a cost-benefit analysis with respect to Northwestern; (3)\n\nthe manner in which those proceedings were initiated in bankruptcy court; and (4) the\n\nallegations that the termination of these Top Hat Contracts was clearly contrary to the\n\nterms of the UPA just negotiated by Northwestern and therefore contrary to law and\n\nwithout probable cause. Furthermore, the Retirees argued that the individually-named\n\ndefendants were “rewarded” for their actions by receiving large bonuses after\n\nreorganization, while the Top Hat Contracts were terminated.\n\n¶94   We conclude that the evidence before the court was sufficient to sustain the claims\n\nagainst the individually-named defendants, and that the District Court did not err in\n\ndenying the Defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law. From this evidence, the\n\njury could have concluded that the individual defendants conduct was tortious in nature\n\nand directed at the Retirees, or it could have concluded that this evidence did not support\n\nsuch a conclusion. In any event, this evidence was sufficient to survive a motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Moreover, the fact that the jury found these individual\n\ndefendants not liable for tortious interference with contracts or punitive damages, but did\n\nfind them liable for malicious prosecution and abuse of process, demonstrates that the\n\njury did not simply lump these individual defendants in with the acts of the corporate\n\ndefendant Northwestern, but instead individually considered their actions in relation to\n\neach claim based on the evidence before it.\n\n¶95   In his dissent, Justice Rice is critical of our resolution of this issue, which he\n\nargues “extensively broadens our law regarding the personal liability of corporate\n\n\n                                              41\n\femployees in order to affirm the imposition of personal liability here.” Dissent, ¶ 105.\n\nJustice Rice’s dissent raises valid concerns on the issue of when an agent is shielded from\n\npersonal liability for acts done in an official capacity and taken on behalf of a\n\ncorporation.      Our caselaw does not draw a bright line between tortious conduct\n\ncommitted by a corporate agent which subjects him to personal liability, and conduct\n\nwhich may cause another party damage, but is nonetheless not actionable in a personal\n\nsense due to the corporate presence. It is not our intent to broaden the law in this area in\n\nany regard. Instead, our holding here is simply based on the quantum of evidence\n\npresented to the jury and whether it was sufficient for the jury to infer tortious conduct on\n\nbehalf of the individual defendants. In this regard, we note that the Defendants never\n\nrequested a jury instruction to clarify for the jury the difference between conduct which is\n\ntortious in nature and gives rise to personal liability, and that which is taken on behalf of\n\na corporation and exempted from such liability. We leave any final pronouncements\n\nregarding this issue to a case in which these issues are fully and squarely before the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n¶96    Issue Eight: Did the District Court err in denying the Defendants’ post-trial\n       motion to offset the judgment against the amount of the Retirees’ pre-trial\n       settlement with Paul Hastings?\n\n¶97    After judgment was entered in this case, the Defendants moved to offset the award\n\nof compensatory damages based on Paul Hastings’ pre-trial settlement with the Retirees.\n\nThe District Court denied both a motion to reveal the confidential settlement and to grant\n\nthe offset. In its order, the District Court explained that an offset was unavailable under\n\nMontana law because Northwestern and the individual defendants were found liable for\n\n\n                                             42\n\fintentional torts, and offsets are available under Montana law only in cases of\n\ncomparative negligence. Moreover, the District Court noted that the Defendants had\n\nagreed to a verdict form which did not lend itself to a precise comparison of the injuries\n\nthe jury found were apportioned among the Defendants and Paul Hastings, thus leaving\n\nunanswered whether the concerted action of the Defendants and Paul Hastings caused a\n\nsingle, indivisible harm to each of the Retirees.\n\n¶98    The Defendants now appeal the denial of their post-trial motion to offset the award\n\nof compensatory damages. They argue that they are entitled to a pro tanto offset against\n\nthe amount of the pre-trial settlement with Paul Hastings under Montana law. We\n\ndisagree. As a practical matter, it is virtually impossible for this Court to determine the\n\nextent to which Paul Hastings bears any liability for the tortious conduct which the jury\n\nfound was committed by the Defendants. As noted by the District Court, the verdict form\n\ndoes not apportion liability among the Defendants and Paul Hastings, or provide any\n\nguidance as to whether the conduct of Paul Hastings resulted in any harm to the Retirees,\n\nmuch less a single, indivisible harm. Yet, as the Defendants themselves note, a pro tanto\n\noffset such as they are now seeking is permitted only if they can show that Paul Hastings,\n\nas a concurrent or joint tortfeasor, caused the Retirees a single “indivisible harm” in\n\nconcert with the Defendants.

In short,\n\nthe Defendants ask this Court to untangle and dissect the jury’s verdict without any\n\nfactual basis upon which to do so. Because the verdict form was used without objection,\n\nwe cannot and will not now second guess the jury’s allocation of damages.\n\n¶100 Finally, we note that in Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assur.

Therefore, we decline to disturb the\n\nDistrict Court’s denial of the post-trial motion.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶101 We affirm the jury’s verdict and the various rulings of the District Court before,\n\nduring and after trial. However, we grant the request made by the Defendants to remand\n\nthe judgment in this case to the District Court so that it can be reduced by the amount of\n\npayments Northwestern has been making to the Retirees under the terms of their Top Hat\n\nContracts since the judgment in this matter was originally entered.

NELSON\n\n/S/ JULIE MACEK\nDistrict Court Judge Julie Macek\nsitting for Justice Brian Morris\n\n\n\n\nJustice Jim Rice, dissenting.\n\n¶102 I dissent from the Court’s resolution of Issues 2 and 7, and would remand for a\n\nnew trial.\n\n¶103 Under Issue 2, the Court announces a new rule—that “advice-of-counsel, when\n\nused as an affirmative defense at trial, must be pled as such under the requirements of M.\n\nR. Civ. P. 8(c).” Opinion, ¶ 54. Thus, the Court has overruled McGuire’s holding that\n\nthe advice-of-counsel defense “may be shown under a general denial in the answer.”\n\nMcGuire, 184 Mont. at 413, 603 P.2d at 256 (quoting Materson v. Pig’n Whistle Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 929 (Cal. App. 1958)). While I concur with this conclusion, I believe it is\n\nunfair to Northwestern to change a previously clear rule which was in effect and upon\n\nwhich it relied during the litigation. Under McGuire, the District Court incorrectly ruled\n\n\n                                            45\n\fthat Northwestern had waived the defense and was not entitled to so instruct the jury. I\n\nbelieve Northwestern was prejudiced thereby. The Court reasons that Northwestern was\n\nnot harmed because the District Court allowed Northwestern to present evidence\n\nconcerning its reliance upon its counsel’s advice to defend against the allegation it acted\n\nin bad faith. However, such evidence must be admitted in any event in support of a\n\ngeneral denial of the claim. The definition of probable cause we have adopted from the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 675 (1977) for malicious prosecution cases is satisfied\n\nwhen a defendant reasonably believes that the claim he pursued was valid under\n\napplicable law “in reliance upon the advice of counsel.” Hughes v. Lynch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"887967\"><a href=\"/opinion/887967/hughes-v-lynch/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n¶ 16, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Thus, such evidence must be admitted in the course\n\nof proving or denying the proof of a malicious prosecution claim.\n\n¶104 Northwestern wanted, and I believe was entitled to, more—an instruction that\n\nreliance upon advice of counsel could be a complete defense to the claim. Indeed, the\n\nRetirees used the counsel defense as a basis to both request that Hastings be added as a\n\ndefendant and to seek discovery of privileged documents. As a result, the District Court\n\ngranted Retirees’ motion to amend the complaint and also granted their motion to compel\n\ndiscovery of materials that would otherwise be protected by the attorney-client and work-\n\nproduct privileges. The privileged documents sought by Retirees were certainly relevant\n\nto their malicious prosecution claim, as they had to prove that Northwestern lacked\n\nprobable cause to file the bankruptcy action. However, after permitting the additional\n\nclaim and the discovery to support the additional claim, the District Court barred\n\nNorthwestern from raising the actual defense—which Northwestern was not required to\n\n\n                                            46\n\faffirmatively plead under McGuire. I believe Northwestern was unfairly constrained in\n\nthe ability to defend itself and would order a new trial.\n\n¶105 I also dissent with the Court’s resolution of Issue 7, which I believe extensively\n\nbroadens our law regarding the personal liability of corporate employees in order to\n\naffirm the imposition of personal liability here.       Our cases illustrate, and we have\n\ninstructed, that “[t]he personal nature of the agent’s actions forms the narrow exception\n\nto the general policy that officers and agents of a corporation must be shielded from\n\npersonal liability for acts taken on behalf of the corporation.” Crystal Springs Trout Co.\n\nv.

We rejected plaintiffs’ assertions that the CEO had failed to increase\n\nFIBM’s capital and obtain the FIBM Board’s approval of the stock purchase for the\n\nreason that his personal interest in the bank’s ownership would have been diluted by\n\ndoing so. Kuhns, 237 Mont. at 74, 853 P.2d at 1204. We held that in order to establish a\n\nclaim against the CEO, the plaintiffs “would have to show that [the CEO] had acted for\n\nhis own pecuniary benefit and against the best interests of the corporation (FIBM); or that\n\nhe had acted outside the scope of his employment.” Kuhns, 259 Mont. at 74-75, 853 P.2d\n\nat 1204 (citing Bottrell, 237 Mont. at 25, 773 P.2d at 708).

There is no\n\nsubstantial evidence, as in Crystal Springs and Poulsen, that these corporate officers\n\nmade false statements, acted fraudulently, or acted in pursuit of personal gain. The jury\n\n\n\n                                              49\n\ffound that the officers were not liable for tortious interference with the contracts.\n\nFurther, there is no evidence that the bonuses, which the Retirees assert is proof of the\n\nofficers’ personal pecuniary gain, were linked to the decision to terminate the contracts.\n\nThe bonuses were provided to the officers for their role in guiding Northwestern through\n\nits reorganization and emergence as a new entity, in accordance with common business\n\npractices.   Perhaps in the times we now live such common corporate practices are\n\npopularly thought to be inappropriate. Nonetheless, without more, these bonuses do not\n\nconstitute a basis for personal liability under our precedent. The evidence is that these\n\nrewards were given for the officers’ actions on behalf of the company. Thus, Retirees’\n\ntheory that the officers personally benefitted directly from the Top Hat situation requires\n\nthe same sort of speculation we rejected as insufficient in Kuhns. The evidence does not\n\ndemonstrate that Retirees’ claims fit within the “narrow exception” to the general rule\n\nagainst personal liability.
