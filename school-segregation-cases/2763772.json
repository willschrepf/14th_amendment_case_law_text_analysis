A jury awarded Nexstar\r\n$1 in nominal damages from Gray on the breach of contract claim, and $2,000 in actual\r\ndamages from KTBS on the tortious interference with the contract claim.  The trial court\r\ngranted Gray a declaratory judgment, ruling that a liquidated damages provision in the\r\ncontract was an unenforceable penalty as a matter of law.  The trial court ruled that Nexstar\r\nwas not entitled to attorney's fees and awarded attorney's fees to Gray.  The court granted\r\nKTBS's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that there was no\r\nevidence of damages and rendered judgment that Nexstar take nothing from KTBS.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar asserts eight issues for appellate review.  KTBS raises a cross-point attacking\r\nthe sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding of $2,000 in damages.  <em>See </em>Tex.\r\nR. Civ. P. 324(c).  We reverse the trial court's judgment.  The cause is remanded for a new\r\ntrial.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Background</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGray was originally hired by Nexstar as a reporter in 2003 and signed an employment\r\ncontract.  In 2004, Gray signed another contract with Nexstar as an on-air performer for a\r\nterm of employment from April 11, 2004, to May 31, 2006.  The contract contained a\r\nprovision titled \"Remedies and Procedure for Remedying Disputes,\" which stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tIn the event Employee elects to breach this Agreement and leave\r\nemployment prior to the conclusion of the term, the Company may accept as\r\nliquidated damages for said breach the amount of $10,000.  In the event the\r\nCompany determines that the liquidated damages amount described above is\r\ninsufficient to cover all of its damages, the Company may seek to obtain\r\nadditional compensatory and consequential damages by pursuing an action\r\nunder paragraph 7(a) herein.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn February 2005, Gray gave notice that she would be resigning from her position. \r\nNexstar sent her a letter reminding her of her continuing obligations under the contract.  The\r\nletter informed Gray she would have to pay $10,000 if she left her employment.  Nexstar\r\nlearned that KTBS was interested in hiring Gray and sent KTBS a letter stating that Gray was\r\nstill under contract.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGray stopped appearing as an on-air performer for Nexstar in March 2005.  Within\r\ntwo weeks of Gray's departure, she began working for KTBS.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The Declaratory Judgment and Attorney's Fees</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar's lawsuit against Gray sought \"liquidated damages from Gray and/or all actual\r\nand consequential damages proximately caused by her breach of contract.\"  Gray filed a\r\ncounterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that the liquidated damages provision in the\r\ncontract was an unenforceable penalty as a matter of law.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court found that the liquidated damages provision in the employment contract\r\nwas an unenforceable penalty.  The jury awarded Nexstar $1.00 in nominal damages from\r\nGray for the breach of contract.  Nexstar and Gray stipulated to the amount of reasonable\r\nattorney's fees, but not to entitlement to attorney's fees.  The trial court awarded Gray\r\nattorney's fees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue one, Nexstar argues the trial court erred in granting the declaratory judgment,\r\nbecause Gray had simply re-asserted an affirmative defense as a request for declaratory\r\njudgment.  In issue six, Nexstar contends the trial court erred in awarding Gray attorney's\r\nfees because Gray asserted the declaratory judgment counterclaim merely to recover\r\nattorney's fees that were otherwise not recoverable.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act is to \"settle and to afford relief from\r\nuncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations[.]\"  Tex.\r\nCiv. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 37.002(b) (Vernon 1997).  A declaratory judgment is\r\nappropriate only if there is a justiciable controversy and the declaration sought will resolve\r\nthe controversy.  <em>Bonham State Bank v. Beadle,</em> 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex. 1995).  The Act\r\nis not available to settle disputes already pending before the court.  <em>BHP Petroleum Co. v.\r\nMillard</em>, 800 S.W.2d 838, 841 (Tex. 1990).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court may allow a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment if it is more\r\nthan a mere denial of the plaintiff's cause of action and has greater ramifications than the\r\noriginal lawsuit.  <em>See id. </em>at 842.  Generally, a counterclaim will have greater ramifications\r\nthan the original claim if it would have the effect of settling future disputes between the\r\nparties.  <em>See, e.g., id.</em>  (allowing declaratory judgment counterclaim that defined the parties'\r\nobligations under an ongoing contract for the foreseeable future); <em>Winslow v. Acker</em>, 781\r\nS.W.2d 322, 328 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1989, writ denied) (holding trial court did not err\r\nin allowing declaratory judgment counterclaim that would settle all future disputes regarding\r\nroyalties under deed).  The counterclaim must seek affirmative relief and allege that the\r\ndefendant has a cause of action, independent of the plaintiff's claim, on which the defendant\r\ncould recover benefits, compensation, or relief.  <em>Millard</em>, 800 S.W.2d at 841; <em>HECI\r\nExploration Co. v. Clajon Gas Co.</em>, 843 S.W.2d 622, 638-39 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, writ\r\ndenied).  A counterclaim that presents no new controversy may not be asserted simply to\r\nrecover attorney's fees.  <em>Hitchcock Props. Inc. v. Levering</em>, 776 S.W.2d 236, 239 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, writ denied).  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGray sought a declaration that the remedies provision in the contract was an\r\nunenforceable penalty and void as a matter of law.  This requested declaration is essentially\r\na restatement of the \"penalty\" affirmative defense asserted in Gray's answer.  <em>See Phillips\r\nv. Phillips</em>, 820 S.W.2d 785, 789 (Tex. 1991) (noting that \"penalty\" is an affirmative defense\r\nto an award of damages under a liquidated damages provision).  She sought no greater relief\r\nin her counterclaim than she asserted in her affirmative defense; Gray denied Nexstar's\r\nentitlement to liquidated damages.  <em>See Millard,</em> 800 S.W.2d at 842.  Gray and Nexstar have\r\nno ongoing relationship.  <em>See HECI Exploration Co.,</em> 843 S.W.2d at 639.  Gray's declaratory\r\njudgment counterclaim presented no new controversy.  Under the circumstances, the award\r\nof attorney's fees to Gray under the Declaratory Judgments Act was unauthorized.  <em>See\r\nHitchcock Props.</em>, 776 S.W.2d at 239.  We sustain issues one and six.<sup> (1)</sup></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>Liquidated Damages</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue two, Nexstar argues the trial court erred in failing to award liquidated\r\ndamages because Nexstar prevailed on the breach of contract claim, and the contract\r\nprovision was enforceable as a matter of law.  Nexstar argues that liquidated damages are\r\nappropriate because damages were difficult or incapable of estimation at the time the contract\r\nwas signed, and $10,000 was a reasonable forecast of just compensation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or\r\nan unenforceable penalty is a question of law[.]\"  <em>Phillips</em>, 820 S.W.2d at 788.  A liquidated\r\ndamages provision may be enforceable if the harm caused by the breach is difficult to\r\nestimate and the amount of liquidated damages is a reasonable forecast of just compensation. \r\n<em>Id.</em>  Evidence that the harm caused is difficult to estimate, and that the amount of liquidated\r\ndamages is a reasonable forecast, must be viewed as of the time the parties executed the\r\ncontract. <em> Baker v. Int'l Record Syndicate, Inc.</em>, 812 S.W.2d 53, 55 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1991,\r\nno writ).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGenerally, a contractual provision that does not exclude further liability for actual\r\ndamages is not a reasonable forecast of just compensation and is an unenforceable penalty. \r\n<em>Robert G. Beneke &amp; Co., v. Cole</em>, 550 S.W.2d 321, 322 (Tex. Civ. App.--Dallas 1977, no\r\nwrit).  The provision must make clear that the amount of liquidated damages will be in lieu\r\nof other damages.  <em>Birdwell v. Ferrell</em>, 746 S.W.2d 338, 340 (Tex. App.--Austin 1988, no\r\nwrit).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe provision in this case provided for $10,000 as liquidated damages, but also stated\r\nthat \"[i]n the event the Company determines that the liquidated damages amount described\r\nabove is insufficient to cover all of its damages, the Company may seek to obtain additional\r\ncompensatory and consequential damages by pursuing an action under paragraph 7(a)\r\nherein.\"  This provision does not limit Nexstar's recovery to liquidated damages or make\r\nclear that liquidated damages will be recovered in lieu of actual damages; under the\r\nprovision,  Nexstar could claim the \"liquidated\" damages and then claim any additional\r\ndamages by taking the dispute to an arbitrator under paragraph 7(a).  The trial court did not\r\nerr in failing to award $10,000 as \"liquidated\" damages.  Issue two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Actual Damages</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>In issue three, Nexstar asserts the evidence conclusively established that Nexstar\r\nsuffered damages in excess of the $1 awarded by the jury.  Nexstar argues it provided\r\nundisputed evidence that it incurred $14,615.49 in actual damages; we understand Nexstar\r\nto argue in issue three that it proved $14,615.49 in damages as a matter of law.  In the\r\nalternative, Nexstar argues in issue four that the jury's finding of $1 in actual damages is\r\nagainst the overwhelming weight of the evidence.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue eight, Nexstar argues the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's finding\r\non damages against KTBS for tortious interference with the contract.  A judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict is proper when no evidence supports the jury's finding. <em>\r\nMancorp</em>, <em>Inc. v. Culpepper, </em>802 S.W.2d 226, 227 (Tex. 1990).  Nexstar contends the\r\nevidence supported a finding of at least $2,000 in damages, the amount found by the jury. \r\nKTBS argues by cross-point that the $2,000 finding is unsupported by the evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA party attacking the legal sufficiency of evidence concerning an adverse finding on\r\nan issue on which it has the burden of proof must demonstrate that the evidence conclusively\r\nestablished all vital facts in support of the issue.  <em>Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis,</em> 46 S.W.3d 237,\r\n241 (Tex. 2001). If the proposition contrary to the verdict is established as a matter of law,\r\nan appellate court must render judgment for that proposition. <em> Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a factual sufficiency review, the appellate court considers and weighs all of the\r\nevidence and will set aside a verdict only if the evidence is so weak or if the finding is so\r\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and\r\nunjust.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar points out the jury instructions on damages for interference with the contract\r\nand breach of the contract were the same: \"out of pocket\" damages.  The jury found $2,000\r\nin \"out of pocket\" damages resulted from the interference with contract, but $1 in damages\r\nresulted from the breach of contract.  Nexstar argued in a post-judgment pleading that it was\r\nentitled to contract damages, at the least, in \"the same $2,000 awarded against Defendant\r\nKTBS.\"  In its claim against Gray, Nexstar argues on appeal \"it is clear that the jury\r\nimproperly failed to consider the undisputed evidence regarding Nexstar being 'out of\r\npocket' $2,000 for the speech pathologist/talent coach because it found Nexstar was 'out of\r\npocket' this amount in its answer to the damages question against KTBS.\"<sup> (2)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar also contends it paid $7,000 to promote a new morning show format that\r\nfeatured Gray as a meteorologist.  The news director testified regarding this expense as\r\nfollows:</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Plaintiff's Counsel]: And how much was that total cost?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[News Director]: I need to look.  I'm not positive off the top of my head.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Q]: Well, just give me your best estimate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[A]: I believe it ran about $7,000.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Q]: Okay.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Nexstar did not show that it promoted the morning show format only because of Gray.  At\r\nthe time of trial, Nexstar still aired the morning show with the same format.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar also argues that it is entitled to the $146.31 in makeup expenses it paid to\r\nGray.  The employment contract states that Gray would be reimbursed for makeup expenses\r\nfor up to $50 per month.  Nexstar presented two checks spent in makeup reimbursements:\r\n$73.61 paid in November 2004; and $73.70 paid on April 20, 2004.  KBTV's news director\r\ntestified that Gray used the makeup while she worked for Nexstar.  Nexstar would have paid\r\nthese expenses even had Gray fully performed under the contract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar asserts that it reimbursed Gray $3,110.07 for her meteorology school tuition. \r\nGray acknowledged that Nexstar paid for her to attend meteorology school.  KBTV's news\r\ndirector testified that Nexstar did not normally pay for meteorology school but agreed to pay\r\nGray's tuition because she had \"great potential.\"  The trial court admitted into evidence the\r\nchecks issued by Nexstar for Gray's tuition: $1,431.50 paid on January 16, 2004; $1,194.07\r\npaid on June 1, 2004; and $484.50 paid on July 28, 2004.  The last two tuition checks, for\r\n$1,194.07 and $484.50, were paid during the term of employment under the March 2004\r\ncontract.  However, Nexstar was not required to reimburse Gray for her meteorology school\r\ntuition expenses under the March 2004 contract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Nexstar argues that it paid $2,000 to a speech pathologist, or talent coach, who\r\nprovided Gray with voice training.  The talent coach trained all of the on-air performers. \r\nKBTV's news director would set a day planner for the coach and would allocate how much\r\ntime each individual would spend with the coach.  The time an individual would spend with\r\nthe coach varied according to how long the individual worked with the station and how much\r\npotential they had.  KBTV's general manager testified that when Gray first started working\r\nwith the station, the coach spent more time with Gray to improve her voice.  However,\r\nNexstar did not present evidence showing how much time Gray spent with the coach, nor did\r\nit segregate Gray's time with the coach from the time the other on-air performers trained with\r\nthe coach.  The record does not show whether the training occurred when Gray was first\r\nhired under the original contract, or during the term of the second contract. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Nexstar also contends it incurred costs in hiring Gray's replacement and paid\r\nfor an on-air performer to fill in for Gray.  While Nexstar sought candidates to replace Gray,\r\nGray's meteorology duties were covered by the station's chief and weekend meteorologists. \r\nNexstar paid Gray's meteorology replacement $191.30 in traveling expenses, $750 in moving\r\nexpenses, and $607.81 for a plane ticket.  Nexstar also paid $810 to a freelance reporter who\r\ncovered some of Gray's reporting duties.  KTBS argues Nexstar would have been required\r\nto replace Gray at the end of her contract in any event and would have incurred the costs even\r\nwithout the alleged interference.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The Jury's Findings</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe findings by the jury, that Nexstar suffered $1 in out of pocket damages as a result\r\nof Gray's breach and $2,000 in out of pocket damages as a result of KTBS's tortious\r\ninterference, address the same material fact.  The measure of damages under the interference\r\nwith contract claim is the same as that under the breach of contract claim in this case.  <em>See\r\nAm. Nat'l Petroleum Co. &amp; Oil Invs., Ltd. v.  Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp.</em>, 798 S.W.2d\r\n274, 278 (Tex. 1990).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial judge found no evidence to support the $2,000 damage finding and signed\r\na judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  There is legally sufficient evidence in this record\r\nof some damages, however.  Though this record may not support an award of all of the costs\r\nof finding a replacement, the jury could reasonably conclude some of the costs incurred in\r\ncovering Gray's job duties, hiring a freelance reporter, and finding a replacement on short\r\nnotice could have been avoided if KTBS had not interfered with the contract.  <em>See</em> <em>Guevara\r\nv. Ferrer, </em>247 S.W.3d 662, 670 (Tex. 2007) (\"[W]hen there is evidence to support some\r\ndamages it is not appropriate to render judgment.\").  But the jury made conflicting jury\r\nfindings on conflicting evidence concerning the same material fact.  The jury also found the\r\nsame evidence did not support more than $1 in damages for the breach of contract.  On this\r\nrecord, a coherent judgment cannot be rendered.  A new trial is required.<sup> (3)</sup></span><span></span><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center></center>\r\n\t\t<center>Conclusion</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court's judgment is reversed.

A jury awarded Nexstar\r\n$1 in nominal damages from Gray on the breach of contract claim, and $2,000 in actual\r\ndamages from KTBS on the tortious interference with the contract claim.  The trial court\r\ngranted Gray a declaratory judgment, ruling that a liquidated damages provision in the\r\ncontract was an unenforceable penalty as a matter of law.  The trial court ruled that Nexstar\r\nwas not entitled to attorney's fees and awarded attorney's fees to Gray.  The court granted\r\nKTBS's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that there was no\r\nevidence of damages and rendered judgment that Nexstar take nothing from KTBS.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar asserts eight issues for appellate review.  KTBS raises a cross-point attacking\r\nthe sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding of $2,000 in damages.  <em>See </em>Tex.\r\nR. Civ. P. 324(c).  We reverse the trial court's judgment.  The cause is remanded for a new\r\ntrial.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Background</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGray was originally hired by Nexstar as a reporter in 2003 and signed an employment\r\ncontract.  In 2004, Gray signed another contract with Nexstar as an on-air performer for a\r\nterm of employment from April 11, 2004, to May 31, 2006.  The contract contained a\r\nprovision titled \"Remedies and Procedure for Remedying Disputes,\" which stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tIn the event Employee elects to breach this Agreement and leave\r\nemployment prior to the conclusion of the term, the Company may accept as\r\nliquidated damages for said breach the amount of $10,000.  In the event the\r\nCompany determines that the liquidated damages amount described above is\r\ninsufficient to cover all of its damages, the Company may seek to obtain\r\nadditional compensatory and consequential damages by pursuing an action\r\nunder paragraph 7(a) herein.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn February 2005, Gray gave notice that she would be resigning from her position. \r\nNexstar sent her a letter reminding her of her continuing obligations under the contract.  The\r\nletter informed Gray she would have to pay $10,000 if she left her employment.  Nexstar\r\nlearned that KTBS was interested in hiring Gray and sent KTBS a letter stating that Gray was\r\nstill under contract.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGray stopped appearing as an on-air performer for Nexstar in March 2005.  Within\r\ntwo weeks of Gray's departure, she began working for KTBS.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The Declaratory Judgment and Attorney's Fees</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar's lawsuit against Gray sought \"liquidated damages from Gray and/or all actual\r\nand consequential damages proximately caused by her breach of contract.\"  Gray filed a\r\ncounterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that the liquidated damages provision in the\r\ncontract was an unenforceable penalty as a matter of law.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court found that the liquidated damages provision in the employment contract\r\nwas an unenforceable penalty.  The jury awarded Nexstar $1.00 in nominal damages from\r\nGray for the breach of contract.  Nexstar and Gray stipulated to the amount of reasonable\r\nattorney's fees, but not to entitlement to attorney's fees.  The trial court awarded Gray\r\nattorney's fees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue one, Nexstar argues the trial court erred in granting the declaratory judgment,\r\nbecause Gray had simply re-asserted an affirmative defense as a request for declaratory\r\njudgment.  In issue six, Nexstar contends the trial court erred in awarding Gray attorney's\r\nfees because Gray asserted the declaratory judgment counterclaim merely to recover\r\nattorney's fees that were otherwise not recoverable.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act is to \"settle and to afford relief from\r\nuncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations[.]\"  Tex.\r\nCiv. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. ยง 37.002(b) (Vernon 1997).  A declaratory judgment is\r\nappropriate only if there is a justiciable controversy and the declaration sought will resolve\r\nthe controversy.  <em>Bonham State Bank v.

Generally, a counterclaim will have greater ramifications\r\nthan the original claim if it would have the effect of settling future disputes between the\r\nparties.  <em>See, e.g., id.</em>  (allowing declaratory judgment counterclaim that defined the parties'\r\nobligations under an ongoing contract for the foreseeable future); <em>Winslow v.

The counterclaim must seek affirmative relief and allege that the\r\ndefendant has a cause of action, independent of the plaintiff's claim, on which the defendant\r\ncould recover benefits, compensation, or relief.  <em>Millard</em>, 800 S.W.2d at 841; <em>HECI\r\nExploration Co. v.

This requested declaration is essentially\r\na restatement of the \"penalty\" affirmative defense asserted in Gray's answer.  <em>See Phillips\r\nv.

Gray and Nexstar have\r\nno ongoing relationship.  <em>See HECI Exploration Co.,</em> 843 S.W.2d at 639.  Gray's declaratory\r\njudgment counterclaim presented no new controversy.  Under the circumstances, the award\r\nof attorney's fees to Gray under the Declaratory Judgments Act was unauthorized.  <em>See\r\nHitchcock Props.</em>, 776 S.W.2d at 239.

Nexstar argues that liquidated damages are\r\nappropriate because damages were difficult or incapable of estimation at the time the contract\r\nwas signed, and $10,000 was a reasonable forecast of just compensation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Whether a contractual provision is an enforceable liquidated damages provision or\r\nan unenforceable penalty is a question of law[.]\"  <em>Phillips</em>, 820 S.W.2d at 788.  A liquidated\r\ndamages provision may be enforceable if the harm caused by the breach is difficult to\r\nestimate and the amount of liquidated damages is a reasonable forecast of just compensation. \r\n<em>Id.</em>  Evidence that the harm caused is difficult to estimate, and that the amount of liquidated\r\ndamages is a reasonable forecast, must be viewed as of the time the parties executed the\r\ncontract. <em> Baker v.

App.--Dallas 1991,\r\nno writ).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGenerally, a contractual provision that does not exclude further liability for actual\r\ndamages is not a reasonable forecast of just compensation and is an unenforceable penalty. \r\n<em>Robert G. Beneke &amp; Co., v.

Civ. App.--Dallas 1977, no\r\nwrit).  The provision must make clear that the amount of liquidated damages will be in lieu\r\nof other damages.  <em>Birdwell v. Ferrell</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1521192\"><a href=\"/opinion/1521192/birdwell-v-ferrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 340 (Tex. App.--Austin 1988, no\r\nwrit).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe provision in this case provided for $10,000 as liquidated damages, but also stated\r\nthat \"[i]n the event the Company determines that the liquidated damages amount described\r\nabove is insufficient to cover all of its damages, the Company may seek to obtain additional\r\ncompensatory and consequential damages by pursuing an action under paragraph 7(a)\r\nherein.\"  This provision does not limit Nexstar's recovery to liquidated damages or make\r\nclear that liquidated damages will be recovered in lieu of actual damages; under the\r\nprovision,  Nexstar could claim the \"liquidated\" damages and then claim any additional\r\ndamages by taking the dispute to an arbitrator under paragraph 7(a).  The trial court did not\r\nerr in failing to award $10,000 as \"liquidated\" damages.  Issue two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Actual Damages</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>In issue three, Nexstar asserts the evidence conclusively established that Nexstar\r\nsuffered damages in excess of the $1 awarded by the jury.  Nexstar argues it provided\r\nundisputed evidence that it incurred $14,615.49 in actual damages; we understand Nexstar\r\nto argue in issue three that it proved $14,615.49 in damages as a matter of law.  In the\r\nalternative, Nexstar argues in issue four that the jury's finding of $1 in actual damages is\r\nagainst the overwhelming weight of the evidence.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue eight, Nexstar argues the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's finding\r\non damages against KTBS for tortious interference with the contract.  A judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict is proper when no evidence supports the jury's finding. <em>\r\nMancorp</em>, <em>Inc. v.

Nexstar contends the\r\nevidence supported a finding of at least $2,000 in damages, the amount found by the jury. \r\nKTBS argues by cross-point that the $2,000 finding is unsupported by the evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA party attacking the legal sufficiency of evidence concerning an adverse finding on\r\nan issue on which it has the burden of proof must demonstrate that the evidence conclusively\r\nestablished all vital facts in support of the issue.  <em>Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis,</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560611\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560611/dow-chemical-co-v-francis/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>,\r\n241 (Tex. 2001). If the proposition contrary to the verdict is established as a matter of law,\r\nan appellate court must render judgment for that proposition. <em> Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a factual sufficiency review, the appellate court considers and weighs all of the\r\nevidence and will set aside a verdict only if the evidence is so weak or if the finding is so\r\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and\r\nunjust.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar points out the jury instructions on damages for interference with the contract\r\nand breach of the contract were the same: \"out of pocket\" damages.  The jury found $2,000\r\nin \"out of pocket\" damages resulted from the interference with contract, but $1 in damages\r\nresulted from the breach of contract.  Nexstar argued in a post-judgment pleading that it was\r\nentitled to contract damages, at the least, in \"the same $2,000 awarded against Defendant\r\nKTBS.\"  In its claim against Gray, Nexstar argues on appeal \"it is clear that the jury\r\nimproperly failed to consider the undisputed evidence regarding Nexstar being 'out of\r\npocket' $2,000 for the speech pathologist/talent coach because it found Nexstar was 'out of\r\npocket' this amount in its answer to the damages question against KTBS.\"<sup> (2)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar also contends it paid $7,000 to promote a new morning show format that\r\nfeatured Gray as a meteorologist.  The news director testified regarding this expense as\r\nfollows:</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Plaintiff's Counsel]: And how much was that total cost?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[News Director]: I need to look.  I'm not positive off the top of my head.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Q]: Well, just give me your best estimate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[A]: I believe it ran about $7,000.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Q]: Okay.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Nexstar did not show that it promoted the morning show format only because of Gray.  At\r\nthe time of trial, Nexstar still aired the morning show with the same format.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar also argues that it is entitled to the $146.31 in makeup expenses it paid to\r\nGray.  The employment contract states that Gray would be reimbursed for makeup expenses\r\nfor up to $50 per month.  Nexstar presented two checks spent in makeup reimbursements:\r\n$73.61 paid in November 2004; and $73.70 paid on April 20, 2004.  KBTV's news director\r\ntestified that Gray used the makeup while she worked for Nexstar.  Nexstar would have paid\r\nthese expenses even had Gray fully performed under the contract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNexstar asserts that it reimbursed Gray $3,110.07 for her meteorology school tuition. \r\nGray acknowledged that Nexstar paid for her to attend meteorology school.  KBTV's news\r\ndirector testified that Nexstar did not normally pay for meteorology school but agreed to pay\r\nGray's tuition because she had \"great potential.\"  The trial court admitted into evidence the\r\nchecks issued by Nexstar for Gray's tuition: $1,431.50 paid on January 16, 2004; $1,194.07\r\npaid on June 1, 2004; and $484.50 paid on July 28, 2004.  The last two tuition checks, for\r\n$1,194.07 and $484.50, were paid during the term of employment under the March 2004\r\ncontract.  However, Nexstar was not required to reimburse Gray for her meteorology school\r\ntuition expenses under the March 2004 contract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>Nexstar argues that it paid $2,000 to a speech pathologist, or talent coach, who\r\nprovided Gray with voice training.  The talent coach trained all of the on-air performers. \r\nKBTV's news director would set a day planner for the coach and would allocate how much\r\ntime each individual would spend with the coach.  The time an individual would spend with\r\nthe coach varied according to how long the individual worked with the station and how much\r\npotential they had.  KBTV's general manager testified that when Gray first started working\r\nwith the station, the coach spent more time with Gray to improve her voice.  However,\r\nNexstar did not present evidence showing how much time Gray spent with the coach, nor did\r\nit segregate Gray's time with the coach from the time the other on-air performers trained with\r\nthe coach.  The record does not show whether the training occurred when Gray was first\r\nhired under the original contract, or during the term of the second contract. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Nexstar also contends it incurred costs in hiring Gray's replacement and paid\r\nfor an on-air performer to fill in for Gray.  While Nexstar sought candidates to replace Gray,\r\nGray's meteorology duties were covered by the station's chief and weekend meteorologists. \r\nNexstar paid Gray's meteorology replacement $191.30 in traveling expenses, $750 in moving\r\nexpenses, and $607.81 for a plane ticket.  Nexstar also paid $810 to a freelance reporter who\r\ncovered some of Gray's reporting duties.  KTBS argues Nexstar would have been required\r\nto replace Gray at the end of her contract in any event and would have incurred the costs even\r\nwithout the alleged interference.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The Jury's Findings</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe findings by the jury, that Nexstar suffered $1 in out of pocket damages as a result\r\nof Gray's breach and $2,000 in out of pocket damages as a result of KTBS's tortious\r\ninterference, address the same material fact.  The measure of damages under the interference\r\nwith contract claim is the same as that under the breach of contract claim in this case.  <em>See\r\nAm. Nat'l Petroleum Co. &amp; Oil Invs., Ltd. v.

There is legally sufficient evidence in this record\r\nof some damages, however.  Though this record may not support an award of all of the costs\r\nof finding a replacement, the jury could reasonably conclude some of the costs incurred in\r\ncovering Gray's job duties, hiring a freelance reporter, and finding a replacement on short\r\nnotice could have been avoided if KTBS had not interfered with the contract.  <em>See</em> <em>Guevara\r\nv.

But the jury made conflicting jury\r\nfindings on conflicting evidence concerning the same material fact.
