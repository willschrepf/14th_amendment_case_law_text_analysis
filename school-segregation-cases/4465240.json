HANSON FAILS TO IDENTIFY ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE\n      SHINGLES WERE IN A SATISFACTORY STATE BEFORE THE\n      STORM.\n      Hanson claims that her testimony that a home inspector “did not find any\n\ndamage to the home at all that was not cosmetic” establishes that the shingles were\n\nin a satisfactory state at the time she purchased the home in 2011. Appellee’s Brief\n\nat 4. However, nothing shows he climbed onto the roof and inspected the shingles.\n\n3:34-35. She also relies on the seller’s disclosure from the 2011 purchase in an\n\nattempt to show that the shingles were not damaged.          Appellee’s Brief at 4.\n\nHowever, as Hanson acknowledges, that shows at best that the seller was simply\n\nnot aware of any unsealed shingles. Appellee’s Brief at 4.\n\n      Finally, she contends that an underwriting report that State Farm prepared\n\napproximately 11 months before the purported storm “did not reflect any concerns\n\nabout the roof at all.” Appellee’s Brief at 4. However, there is no evidence anyone\n\nclimbed up on the roof to examine the shingles.         One cannot determine the\n\npresence of unsealed shingles from the ground. 6:71-72. Nor can overdriven\n\nstaples be seen from the ground. 5:254. The only way to detect them is to lift the\n\ncorners of shingles and look at the staples. 5:254.\n\nII.   HANSON FAILS TO IDENTIFY ANY PROBATIVE EVIDENCE\n      THAT THE WIND CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE SHINGLES.\n      Hanson cites Kimmel’s testimony that the wind lifted unsealed shingles and\n\npulled them through the staples. Appellant’s Brief at 6-10. However, Kimmel’s\n\n                                          1\n\fconclusions are not probative evidence because they do not exclude construction\n\ndefects as a cause of the damage.\n\n      Kimmel repeatedly states that shingles were pulled through the staples, but\n\nnever states how he differentiates the damage from that caused by overdriven\n\nstaples. For example, he states,\n\n      “Now in this exhibit if you see that fastener just pulled with it. The\n      nail came completely out. Okay. And that’s not what’s happening\n      here. It’s actually pulling through the staple. There’s a staple on the\n      roof and it’s pulled through the staple.”\n\n3:178-79. He continued, “In this instance, in her roof, it’s pulled through that\n\nfastener so it’s actually torn right there at the fastener. So it is damage, it’s got\n\nactual direct physical loss.” 3:179. The mere fact that the shingles were unsealed\n\nwas what Kimmel based his conclusions on: “And the depiction – the shingles are\n\nlifting up, just like I told you, so that tells me that these fasteners are pulled . . . .”\n\n3:180. But he never ruled out that the unsealed shingles were torn at the fastener\n\nbecause the staples were overdriven. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, 313\n\nS.W.3d 837, 838 (Tex. 2010). He did not state how he could differentiate between\n\npull through damage and overdriven-staple damage.               Nor did he show that\n\nunsealed shingles could not have been torn by overdriven staples.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fIII.   HANSON FAILS TO IDENTIFY EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT THE\n       SHINGLES CHANGED FROM A SATISFACTORY STATE TO AN\n       UNSATISFACTORY STATE ON JUNE 1, 2012.\n       Hanson attempts to deflect attention from the lack of evidence showing that\n\nthe shingles became unsealed on June 1, 2012 by relying on evidence that trees fell\n\nover on a golf course. Appellee’s Brief at 15. Even if that were evidence of high\n\nwinds at Hanson’s house, it is not evidence that any supposed damage to the\n\nshingles occurred that day.\n\n       Hanson also relies on evidence that other neighbors were having work\n\nperformed on their roofs. Appellee’s Brief at 16. But nothing shows that those\n\nroofs were not in a condition similar to Hanson’s. Unsealed shingles are common\n\non roofs over five years old. 5:240. That other roofs in her neighborhood were\n\nbeing worked on is not evidence that wind caused pull through shingle damage or\n\ncaused the shingles to unseal on June 1, 2012.\n\nIV.    FREEMAN DID NOT RULE OUT OVERDRIVEN STAPLES AS THE\n       CAUSE OF THE PULL THROUGH DAMAGE.\n       Hanson contends Freeman ruled out overdriven staples as a cause of damage\n\nto the shingles. Appellee’s Brief at 12. However, Freeman limited his testimony\n\nto only the most severe type of overdriven staple. He considered a staple to be\n\noverdriven if it penetrated the plywood decking:\n\n       A.    Typically when it’s overdriven in my experience it will go\n             down into the decking.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f      Q.    What will?\n\n      A.    The fastener.\n\n4:11-12.\n\n      The undisputed evidence showed that a staple was overdriven if it merely\n\npenetrated the top layer of shingles. 5:252. A properly driven staple is flush with\n\nthe surface of the top layer of shingles. 5:252. The roof had numerous staples that\n\nwere flush with the top surface of the bottom layer indicating they were overdriven\n\nthrough the top layer. 5:252. A staple can also be overdriven when it does not\n\ncompletely penetrate the top layer. 5:248. Freemen never ruled out these other\n\ntypes of overdriven staples as alternate causes of the damage. Kimmel did not rule\n\nout any kind of overdriven staple as a cause of the damage. Consequently, their\n\ntestimony was not probative evidence. See Merrell, 313 S.W.3d at 838.\n\nV.    HANSON HAS NOT SHOWN SHE WAS EXCUSED FROM\n      SATISFYING THE POLICY’S CONDITION PRECEDENT\n      REQUIRING HER TO REPAIR THE SUPPOSED DAMAGE IN\n      ORDER TO BE ENTITLED TO REPLACEMENT COST BENEFITS.\n      Hanson can only muster one opinion in which a court held that the insured\n\ncould recover replacement cost benefits without first repairing the damage.\n\nAppellee’s Brief at 20. Hanson contends that the opinion in Saitchick v. American\n\nMotorists Insurance Co., 554 F.Supp. 209 (S.D. N.Y.), supports her recovery of\n\nreplacement cost benefits. There, the insurer asserted that the insureds had not\n\nsatisfied the condition precedent for recovery. Id. at 216. The insureds asserted\n\n                                        4\n\fthat “various equitable axioms,” including estoppel, precluded the insurer from\n\nrelying on the condition precedent. Id. The court based its conclusion that the\n\ninsureds were entitled to replace cost benefits based on “equitable considerations”\n\nand case law.    Id. at 217 (stating, “I find that both case law and equitable\n\nconsiderations render replacement cost the appropriate method of valuing\n\nplaintiffs’ damages.”). Here, Hanson never asserted estoppel as an affirmative\n\ndefense to her required satisfaction of the condition precedent. In fact, she never\n\nasserted or pled that she was not required to satisfy the condition precedent.\n\nAdditionally, Hanson failed to show that she could not recover replacement cost\n\nbenefits under the policy after recovering the proceeds of a judgment for actual\n\ncash value and performing the repairs.\n\nVI.   HANSON FAILS TO IDENTIFY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO\n      ESTABLISH THAT SHE SEGREGATED THE CLAIMED\n      ATTORNEY’S FEES.\n      In order to support her deficient attempt to comply with the lodestar method\n\nfor proving attorney’s fees, Hanson is forced to reduce the requirements in Long\n\nand El Apple to “at least some indication of the time spent on various parts of the\n\ncase.” Appellee’s Brief at 25. But both require much more. “To establish the\n\nnumber of hours reasonably spent on the case, the fee application and record must\n\ninclude proof documenting the performance of specific tasks, the time required for\n\nthose tasks, the person who performed the work, and his or her specific rate.” El\n\n\n                                         5\n\fApple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 765 (Tex. 2012). “[G]eneralities about\n\ntasks performed provide insufficient information for the fact finder to meaningfully\n\nreview whether the tasks and hours were reasonable and necessary under the\n\nlodestar method.” Long v. Griffin, 442 S.W.3d 253, 255 (Tex. 2014).\n\n      While she claims that the evidence here is “vastly different” from that in\n\nLong and El Apple, that is not the standard. Hanson fails to show how the notation\n\n“preparation for trial” permits the trial court to determine whether the time\n\nexpended was reasonable and necessary. Appellee’s Brief at 25. Plainly, it does\n\nnot. It does not even identify what was done to prepare for trial. Because it does\n\nnot document the performance of “specific tasks,” but gives only a general\n\ncategory of work it is insufficient.\n\n      Moreover, she fails to show how entries giving the total time expended for a\n\nday, but listing four tasks permits a meaningful review of whether the time spent\n\non each was reasonable and necessary. Obviously, the trial court has no way of\n\ndetermining reasonableness and necessity without knowing the amount of time\n\nexpended on each task.\n\nVII   HANSON HAS FAILED TO SHOW THAT RULE 167 DOES NOT\n      PRECLUDE HER RECOVERY OF DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY’S\n      FEES THAT ACCRUED AFTER DECEMBER 4, 2013.\n      Hanson states that the “language” of rule 167 “makes it clear that the\n\n$15,000 attorney’s fee award must be included in the equation” determining\n\n\n                                         6\n\fwhether Hanson recovered 80 percent of State Farm’s offer. Appellee’s Brief at\n\n27. Conspicuously absent is any reference to any such language. Nor does\n\nHanson establish that an attorney’s fee award is a “monetary claim.”\n\n       The statute provides, \"If a settlement offer made under this rule is rejected,\n\nand the judgment to be awarded on the monetary claims covered by the offer is\n\nsignificantly less favorable to the offeree than was the offer, the court must award\n\nthe offeror litigation costs against the offeree from the time the offer was rejected\n\nto the time of judgment.\"      Rule 167.4(a).   Here, the judgment awarded only\n\n$12,878 for breach of contract, the monetary claim. Attorney’s fees are simply an\n\nadd on amount and their recovery is entirely dependent on a successful breach of\n\ncontract claim. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 38.001 (stating “A person may\n\nrecover reasonable attorney’s fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to\n\nthe amount of a valid claim . . . .” (emphasis added)); Ashford Partners, Ltd. v.\n\nECO Resources, Inc., 401 S.W.3d 35, 40 (Tex. 2012). “A judgment award on\n\nmonetary claims is significantly less favorable than an offer to settle those claims\n\nif: (1) the offeree is a claimant and the judgment would be less than 80 percent of\n\nthe offer. . . .”   Rule 167(b).   The $12,878 award on the breach of contract\n\nmonetary claim is only 43 percent of State Farm’s $30,000 offer on that claim. CR\n\n1541. Consequently, the rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fVIII. HANSON FAILS TO SHOW THAT SHE PROPERLY SEGREGATED\n      RECOVERABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES FROM THOSE THAT ARE\n      NOT RECOVERABLE.\n      Hanson fails to offer any basis for her expert’s opinion that only five percent\n\nof the fees incurred were for claims for which they were not recoverable. She cites\n\nno testimony showing how he arrived at that percentage. She states, “Segregated\n\nattorney’s fees can be established with evidence of unsegregated fees and a rough\n\npercentage of the amount attributable to the covered vs. non-covered claims.”\n\nAppellee’s Brief at 29. But her expert’s five percent figure does not even rise to\n\nthe level of a rough percentage.\n\n      Hanson complains that the way the attorney applied a percentage to\n\nsegregate attorney’s fees in Citizens Nat’l Bank v. NXS Constr., Inc., 387 S.W.3d\n\n74, 88 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.), is not the standard for\n\nsegregation. But Hanson’s expert offered no methodology for coming up with the\n\nfive percent that he applied to determine what fees were incurred on claims for\n\nwhich they were not recoverable:\n\n            A. Chapa is a case that basically says when you have different\n      causes of action -- like here we've got a breach of contract cause of\n      action and we've got a bad faith cause of action. And it says you need\n      to apportion your time to each in case you're not successful on one of\n      them.\n\n            But what basically happens is in this case we're trying to get a\n      new roof. So 95 percent of the time that we spend on this case is\n      towards that. And that -- so in other words, the breach of -- the work\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      you do for breach of contract and bad faith is inextricably intertwined.\n      That's the terminology they use.\n\n             I would estimate that 5 percent of the time that we've spent was\n      spent solely on bad faith issues.\n\n5:18-19. He provided nothing showing how he arrived at the five percent estimate.\n\nHe did not identify the amount of time that was spent on the extra contractual\n\nclaims. He did not identify the amount of time expended on the claims against\n\nTraise whom Hanson had nonsuited. In short, the five percent segregation is based\n\non nothing more than the ipse dixit of the expert and is nothing but a bare\n\nconclusion that is not probative evidence.\n\n      Nor do the authorities on which Hanson relies show that an unsupported\n\npercentage is probative evidence of segregation. She relies on dicta in a footnote\n\nin Flagship Hotel, Ltd. v. City of Galveston, 117 S.W.3d 552, 565 n.7 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 2003, pet. denied), that a “rough percentage” of the amount\n\nattributable to a breach of contract claim can be sufficient to segregate. However,\n\nsegregation by a percentage was not an issue in the case. The court never held that\n\nan unsupported percentage was sufficient evidence of segregation.         Again, in\n\nStewart Title Guaranty Co. v. Aiello, 941 S.W.2d 68, 73 (Tex. 1997), the\n\npercentage based segregation was not challenged and the court did not address\n\nwhether it was sufficient. In Alief Independent School District v. Perry, 440\n\nS.W.3d 228, 246 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. denied), the\n\n                                         9\n\fdefendant never challenged how the plaintiff’s expert arrived at the percentage he\n\napplied for segregation. Here, State Farm has. In Schenck v. Ebby Halliday Real\n\nEstate, Inc., 803 S.W.2d 361, 369 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1990, no writ), the\n\npercentage that was applied was not challenged as lacking support. The court did\n\nnot hold that an expert witness can simply declare that a certain percentage should\n\napply without showing what he based the percentage on.\n\n      In the end, the only courts that have addressed the sufficiency of a\n\npercentage based segregation in the cases the parties have cited were the ones in\n\nFarmers Group Ins., Inc. v. Poteet, 434 S.W.3d 316, 332 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2014, pet. denied), and Citizens Nat’l Bank v. NXS Construction, Inc., 387\n\nS.W.3d 74, 88 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.). In Poteet, the\n\ncourt held that applying a blanket percentage to the total amount of attorney’s fees\n\nclaimed was not evidence of segregation. 434 S.W.3d at 332, 333. That is what\n\nHanson’s expert did here. 5:18-19. In NXS Construction, the percentage was\n\nbased on the attorney deducting fees attributable to claims for which they were not\n\nrecoverable. 387 S.W.3d at 87-88. Hanson’s expert did not do that. 5:18-19.\n\nIX.   HANSON HAS FAILED TO SHOW THAT THE ATTORNEY’S FEE\n      AWARD IS NOT EXCESSIVE.\n      The appellants spill a lot of ink trying to rebut the supreme court’s assertion\n\nthat “the degree of the plaintiff’s overall success goes to the reasonableness of a\n\nfee award” and “‘the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a\n                                        10\n\ffee award is the degree of success obtained.’”                 Smith v. Patrick W.Y. Tam\n\nTrust, 296 S.W.3d 545, 548 (Tex. 2009) (quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S.\n\n103 (1992)). Appellee’s Brief at 33-36. They imply that that is only true in civil\n\nrights cases. Appellee’s Brief at 33-36. However, Smith was not a civil rights\n\ncase. Id. at 546.\n\n       There, the plaintiffs sought damages for breach of a commercial lease. Id.\n\nThe plaintiff sought $200,000 in damages, but the jury awarded only $65,000. The\n\nsupreme court concluded that the $62,438.75 fee sought “was unreasonable in light\n\nof the amount involved and the results obtained, and in the absence of evidence\n\nthat such fees were warranted due to circumstances unique to this case.” 1 Id. at\n\n548. Thus, the court’s statements quoted above were neither limited nor applied to\n\ncivil rights cases.\n\n       Other courts also recognize that the degree of success is the most critical\n\nfactor in determining the reasonableness of an attorney’s fee award. In Ware v.\n\nUnited Lloyd’s, 2013 WL 1932812, *3 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2013, no pet.), the\n\nonly factor the court applied was the degree of success obtained. It affirmed the\n\ntrial court’s refusal to award attorney’s fees where the plaintiff recovered $7833.01\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Nor did State Farm heavily rely on the holding in Farrar as appellants incorrectly assert.\nAppellee’s Brief at 35. State Farm referred to Farrar only once in Appellant’s Brief (stating in a\nparenthetical to the citation to Smith, “(quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 (1992))).”\n\n                                               11\n\fin damages and sought $133,947 in attorney’s fees. Id. at *3. See also Brasel v.\n\nManhattan Homeowners Ass’n, 2014 WL 2809816 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2014, no pet.), and Farmers Group Ins. Inc. v. Poteet, 434 S.W.3d 316 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2014, pet. denied) (both recognizing “the most critical factor in\n\ndetermining the reasonableness of a fee award is the degree of success obtained.”).\n\n      Hanson also cites a long list of cases that have supposedly “held fee awards\n\nreasonable even when the amount of fees far surpasses the amount of actual\n\ndamages.” Appellee’s Brief at 38. Here, the fees surpass the damages by a ratio of\n\nnearly six to one. Only two cases on which Hanson relies involved that type of\n\nfees to damages ratio. However, in Flint & Assocs. v. Intercontinental Pipe &\n\nSteel, Inc., 739 S.W.2d 622, 626 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1987, writ denied), the fees\n\nwere not excessive because trial lasted four weeks. Here, trial lasted four days.\n\nThe case does not establish that the fees here were not excessive. In USAA County\n\nMutual Insurance Company v. Cook, 241 S.W.3d 93, 102-03 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.), the plaintiff recovered $23,310 in fees and $1926.56 in\n\ndamages. However, the amount originally demanded was $2126.56, so the degree\n\nof success was 90 percent. See id. at 103. Here, the degree of success was only\n\nabout 33 percent based of Hanson’s demand during trial and about 25 percent of\n\nwhat she sought before trial. CR 1541. Cook does not establish that the attorney’s\n\nfee award here is not excessive.\n\n                                        12\n\f                                CONCLUSION\n      State Farm respectfully requests the Court to grant the relief sought in\n\nAppellant’s Brief.\n\n                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                               MARTIN, DISIERE, JEFFERSON & WISDOM, L.L.P.\n\n\n                               By: /s/ Bruce E.

HANSON FAILS TO IDENTIFY ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE\n      SHINGLES WERE IN A SATISFACTORY STATE BEFORE THE\n      STORM.\n      Hanson claims that her testimony that a home inspector “did not find any\n\ndamage to the home at all that was not cosmetic” establishes that the shingles were\n\nin a satisfactory state at the time she purchased the home in 2011. Appellee’s Brief\n\nat 4. However, nothing shows he climbed onto the roof and inspected the shingles.\n\n3:34-35. She also relies on the seller’s disclosure from the 2011 purchase in an\n\nattempt to show that the shingles were not damaged.          Appellee’s Brief at 4.\n\nHowever, as Hanson acknowledges, that shows at best that the seller was simply\n\nnot aware of any unsealed shingles. Appellee’s Brief at 4.\n\n      Finally, she contends that an underwriting report that State Farm prepared\n\napproximately 11 months before the purported storm “did not reflect any concerns\n\nabout the roof at all.” Appellee’s Brief at 4. However, there is no evidence anyone\n\nclimbed up on the roof to examine the shingles.         One cannot determine the\n\npresence of unsealed shingles from the ground. 6:71-72. Nor can overdriven\n\nstaples be seen from the ground. 5:254. The only way to detect them is to lift the\n\ncorners of shingles and look at the staples. 5:254.\n\nII.   HANSON FAILS TO IDENTIFY ANY PROBATIVE EVIDENCE\n      THAT THE WIND CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE SHINGLES.\n      Hanson cites Kimmel’s testimony that the wind lifted unsealed shingles and\n\npulled them through the staples. Appellant’s Brief at 6-10. However, Kimmel’s\n\n                                          1\n\fconclusions are not probative evidence because they do not exclude construction\n\ndefects as a cause of the damage.\n\n      Kimmel repeatedly states that shingles were pulled through the staples, but\n\nnever states how he differentiates the damage from that caused by overdriven\n\nstaples. For example, he states,\n\n      “Now in this exhibit if you see that fastener just pulled with it. The\n      nail came completely out. Okay. And that’s not what’s happening\n      here. It’s actually pulling through the staple. There’s a staple on the\n      roof and it’s pulled through the staple.”\n\n3:178-79. He continued, “In this instance, in her roof, it’s pulled through that\n\nfastener so it’s actually torn right there at the fastener. So it is damage, it’s got\n\nactual direct physical loss.” 3:179. The mere fact that the shingles were unsealed\n\nwas what Kimmel based his conclusions on: “And the depiction – the shingles are\n\nlifting up, just like I told you, so that tells me that these fasteners are pulled . . . .”\n\n3:180. But he never ruled out that the unsealed shingles were torn at the fastener\n\nbecause the staples were overdriven. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895238\"><a href=\"/opinion/895238/wal-mart-stores-inc-v-merrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 838 (Tex. 2010). He did not state how he could differentiate between\n\npull through damage and overdriven-staple damage.               Nor did he show that\n\nunsealed shingles could not have been torn by overdriven staples.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fIII.   HANSON FAILS TO IDENTIFY EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT THE\n       SHINGLES CHANGED FROM A SATISFACTORY STATE TO AN\n       UNSATISFACTORY STATE ON JUNE 1, 2012.\n       Hanson attempts to deflect attention from the lack of evidence showing that\n\nthe shingles became unsealed on June 1, 2012 by relying on evidence that trees fell\n\nover on a golf course. Appellee’s Brief at 15. Even if that were evidence of high\n\nwinds at Hanson’s house, it is not evidence that any supposed damage to the\n\nshingles occurred that day.\n\n       Hanson also relies on evidence that other neighbors were having work\n\nperformed on their roofs. Appellee’s Brief at 16. But nothing shows that those\n\nroofs were not in a condition similar to Hanson’s. Unsealed shingles are common\n\non roofs over five years old. 5:240. That other roofs in her neighborhood were\n\nbeing worked on is not evidence that wind caused pull through shingle damage or\n\ncaused the shingles to unseal on June 1, 2012.\n\nIV.    FREEMAN DID NOT RULE OUT OVERDRIVEN STAPLES AS THE\n       CAUSE OF THE PULL THROUGH DAMAGE.\n       Hanson contends Freeman ruled out overdriven staples as a cause of damage\n\nto the shingles. Appellee’s Brief at 12. However, Freeman limited his testimony\n\nto only the most severe type of overdriven staple. He considered a staple to be\n\noverdriven if it penetrated the plywood decking:\n\n       A.    Typically when it’s overdriven in my experience it will go\n             down into the decking.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f      Q.    What will?\n\n      A.    The fastener.\n\n4:11-12.\n\n      The undisputed evidence showed that a staple was overdriven if it merely\n\npenetrated the top layer of shingles. 5:252. A properly driven staple is flush with\n\nthe surface of the top layer of shingles. 5:252. The roof had numerous staples that\n\nwere flush with the top surface of the bottom layer indicating they were overdriven\n\nthrough the top layer. 5:252. A staple can also be overdriven when it does not\n\ncompletely penetrate the top layer. 5:248. Freemen never ruled out these other\n\ntypes of overdriven staples as alternate causes of the damage. Kimmel did not rule\n\nout any kind of overdriven staple as a cause of the damage. Consequently, their\n\ntestimony was not probative evidence. See Merrell, 313 S.W.3d at 838.\n\nV.    HANSON HAS NOT SHOWN SHE WAS EXCUSED FROM\n      SATISFYING THE POLICY’S CONDITION PRECEDENT\n      REQUIRING HER TO REPAIR THE SUPPOSED DAMAGE IN\n      ORDER TO BE ENTITLED TO REPLACEMENT COST BENEFITS.\n      Hanson can only muster one opinion in which a court held that the insured\n\ncould recover replacement cost benefits without first repairing the damage.\n\nAppellee’s Brief at 20. Hanson contends that the opinion in Saitchick v. American\n\nMotorists Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1630102\"><a href=\"/opinion/1630102/zaitchick-v-american-motorists-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D. N.Y.), supports her recovery of\n\nreplacement cost benefits. There, the insurer asserted that the insureds had not\n\nsatisfied the condition precedent for recovery. Id. at 216. The insureds asserted\n\n                                        4\n\fthat “various equitable axioms,” including estoppel, precluded the insurer from\n\nrelying on the condition precedent. Id. The court based its conclusion that the\n\ninsureds were entitled to replace cost benefits based on “equitable considerations”\n\nand case law.    Id. at 217 (stating, “I find that both case law and equitable\n\nconsiderations render replacement cost the appropriate method of valuing\n\nplaintiffs’ damages.”). Here, Hanson never asserted estoppel as an affirmative\n\ndefense to her required satisfaction of the condition precedent. In fact, she never\n\nasserted or pled that she was not required to satisfy the condition precedent.\n\nAdditionally, Hanson failed to show that she could not recover replacement cost\n\nbenefits under the policy after recovering the proceeds of a judgment for actual\n\ncash value and performing the repairs.\n\nVI.   HANSON FAILS TO IDENTIFY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO\n      ESTABLISH THAT SHE SEGREGATED THE CLAIMED\n      ATTORNEY’S FEES.\n      In order to support her deficient attempt to comply with the lodestar method\n\nfor proving attorney’s fees, Hanson is forced to reduce the requirements in Long\n\nand El Apple to “at least some indication of the time spent on various parts of the\n\ncase.” Appellee’s Brief at 25. But both require much more. “To establish the\n\nnumber of hours reasonably spent on the case, the fee application and record must\n\ninclude proof documenting the performance of specific tasks, the time required for\n\nthose tasks, the person who performed the work, and his or her specific rate.” El\n\n\n                                         5\n\fApple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765 (Tex. 2012). “[G]eneralities about\n\ntasks performed provide insufficient information for the fact finder to meaningfully\n\nreview whether the tasks and hours were reasonable and necessary under the\n\nlodestar method.” Long v. Griffin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (Tex. 2014).\n\n      While she claims that the evidence here is “vastly different” from that in\n\nLong and El Apple, that is not the standard. Hanson fails to show how the notation\n\n“preparation for trial” permits the trial court to determine whether the time\n\nexpended was reasonable and necessary. Appellee’s Brief at 25. Plainly, it does\n\nnot. It does not even identify what was done to prepare for trial. Because it does\n\nnot document the performance of “specific tasks,” but gives only a general\n\ncategory of work it is insufficient.\n\n      Moreover, she fails to show how entries giving the total time expended for a\n\nday, but listing four tasks permits a meaningful review of whether the time spent\n\non each was reasonable and necessary. Obviously, the trial court has no way of\n\ndetermining reasonableness and necessity without knowing the amount of time\n\nexpended on each task.\n\nVII   HANSON HAS FAILED TO SHOW THAT RULE 167 DOES NOT\n      PRECLUDE HER RECOVERY OF DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY’S\n      FEES THAT ACCRUED AFTER DECEMBER 4, 2013.\n      Hanson states that the “language” of rule 167 “makes it clear that the\n\n$15,000 attorney’s fee award must be included in the equation” determining\n\n\n                                         6\n\fwhether Hanson recovered 80 percent of State Farm’s offer. Appellee’s Brief at\n\n27. Conspicuously absent is any reference to any such language. Nor does\n\nHanson establish that an attorney’s fee award is a “monetary claim.”\n\n       The statute provides, \"If a settlement offer made under this rule is rejected,\n\nand the judgment to be awarded on the monetary claims covered by the offer is\n\nsignificantly less favorable to the offeree than was the offer, the court must award\n\nthe offeror litigation costs against the offeree from the time the offer was rejected\n\nto the time of judgment.\"      Rule 167.4(a).   Here, the judgment awarded only\n\n$12,878 for breach of contract, the monetary claim. Attorney’s fees are simply an\n\nadd on amount and their recovery is entirely dependent on a successful breach of\n\ncontract claim. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 38.001 (stating “A person may\n\nrecover reasonable attorney’s fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to\n\nthe amount of a valid claim . . . .” (emphasis added)); Ashford Partners, Ltd. v.\n\nECO Resources, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (Tex. 2012). “A judgment award on\n\nmonetary claims is significantly less favorable than an offer to settle those claims\n\nif: (1) the offeree is a claimant and the judgment would be less than 80 percent of\n\nthe offer. . . .”   Rule 167(b).   The $12,878 award on the breach of contract\n\nmonetary claim is only 43 percent of State Farm’s $30,000 offer on that claim. CR\n\n1541. Consequently, the rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fVIII. HANSON FAILS TO SHOW THAT SHE PROPERLY SEGREGATED\n      RECOVERABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES FROM THOSE THAT ARE\n      NOT RECOVERABLE.\n      Hanson fails to offer any basis for her expert’s opinion that only five percent\n\nof the fees incurred were for claims for which they were not recoverable. She cites\n\nno testimony showing how he arrived at that percentage. She states, “Segregated\n\nattorney’s fees can be established with evidence of unsegregated fees and a rough\n\npercentage of the amount attributable to the covered vs. non-covered claims.”\n\nAppellee’s Brief at 29. But her expert’s five percent figure does not even rise to\n\nthe level of a rough percentage.\n\n      Hanson complains that the way the attorney applied a percentage to\n\nsegregate attorney’s fees in Citizens Nat’l Bank v. NXS Constr., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.), is not the standard for\n\nsegregation. But Hanson’s expert offered no methodology for coming up with the\n\nfive percent that he applied to determine what fees were incurred on claims for\n\nwhich they were not recoverable:\n\n            A. Chapa is a case that basically says when you have different\n      causes of action -- like here we've got a breach of contract cause of\n      action and we've got a bad faith cause of action. And it says you need\n      to apportion your time to each in case you're not successful on one of\n      them.\n\n            But what basically happens is in this case we're trying to get a\n      new roof. So 95 percent of the time that we spend on this case is\n      towards that. And that -- so in other words, the breach of -- the work\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      you do for breach of contract and bad faith is inextricably intertwined.\n      That's the terminology they use.\n\n             I would estimate that 5 percent of the time that we've spent was\n      spent solely on bad faith issues.\n\n5:18-19. He provided nothing showing how he arrived at the five percent estimate.\n\nHe did not identify the amount of time that was spent on the extra contractual\n\nclaims. He did not identify the amount of time expended on the claims against\n\nTraise whom Hanson had nonsuited. In short, the five percent segregation is based\n\non nothing more than the ipse dixit of the expert and is nothing but a bare\n\nconclusion that is not probative evidence.\n\n      Nor do the authorities on which Hanson relies show that an unsupported\n\npercentage is probative evidence of segregation. She relies on dicta in a footnote\n\nin Flagship Hotel, Ltd. v. City of Galveston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1426779\"><a href=\"/opinion/1426779/flagship-hotel-ltd-v-city-of-galveston/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565 n.7 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 2003, pet. denied), that a “rough percentage” of the amount\n\nattributable to a breach of contract claim can be sufficient to segregate. However,\n\nsegregation by a percentage was not an issue in the case. The court never held that\n\nan unsupported percentage was sufficient evidence of segregation.         Again, in\n\nStewart Title Guaranty Co. v. Aiello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1780829\"><a href=\"/opinion/1780829/stewart-title-guar-co-v-aiello/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (Tex. 1997), the\n\npercentage based segregation was not challenged and the court did not address\n\nwhether it was sufficient. In Alief Independent School District v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246 (Tex.

Here, State Farm has. In Schenck v. Ebby Halliday Real\n\nEstate, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1717907\"><a href=\"/opinion/1717907/schenck-v-ebby-halliday-real-estate-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1990, no writ), the\n\npercentage that was applied was not challenged as lacking support. The court did\n\nnot hold that an expert witness can simply declare that a certain percentage should\n\napply without showing what he based the percentage on.\n\n      In the end, the only courts that have addressed the sufficiency of a\n\npercentage based segregation in the cases the parties have cited were the ones in\n\nFarmers Group Ins., Inc. v. Poteet, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 (Tex.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.). In Poteet, the\n\ncourt held that applying a blanket percentage to the total amount of attorney’s fees\n\nclaimed was not evidence of segregation. 434 S.W.3d at 332, 333. That is what\n\nHanson’s expert did here. 5:18-19. In NXS Construction, the percentage was\n\nbased on the attorney deducting fees attributable to claims for which they were not\n\nrecoverable. 387 S.W.3d at 87-88. Hanson’s expert did not do that. 5:18-19.\n\nIX.   HANSON HAS FAILED TO SHOW THAT THE ATTORNEY’S FEE\n      AWARD IS NOT EXCESSIVE.\n      The appellants spill a lot of ink trying to rebut the supreme court’s assertion\n\nthat “the degree of the plaintiff’s overall success goes to the reasonableness of a\n\nfee award” and “‘the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a\n                                        10\n\ffee award is the degree of success obtained.’”                 Smith v.

Appellee’s Brief at 33-36. They imply that that is only true in civil\n\nrights cases. Appellee’s Brief at 33-36. However, Smith was not a civil rights\n\ncase. Id. at 546.\n\n       There, the plaintiffs sought damages for breach of a commercial lease. Id.\n\nThe plaintiff sought $200,000 in damages, but the jury awarded only $65,000. The\n\nsupreme court concluded that the $62,438.75 fee sought “was unreasonable in light\n\nof the amount involved and the results obtained, and in the absence of evidence\n\nthat such fees were warranted due to circumstances unique to this case.” 1 Id. at\n\n548. Thus, the court’s statements quoted above were neither limited nor applied to\n\ncivil rights cases.\n\n       Other courts also recognize that the degree of success is the most critical\n\nfactor in determining the reasonableness of an attorney’s fee award.

It affirmed the\n\ntrial court’s refusal to award attorney’s fees where the plaintiff recovered $7833.01\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Nor did State Farm heavily rely on the holding in Farrar as appellants incorrectly assert.\nAppellee’s Brief at 35. State Farm referred to Farrar only once in Appellant’s Brief (stating in a\nparenthetical to the citation to Smith, “(quoting Farrar v.

Here, the fees surpass the damages by a ratio of\n\nnearly six to one. Only two cases on which Hanson relies involved that type of\n\nfees to damages ratio. However, in Flint & Assocs. v.

However, the amount originally demanded was $2126.56, so the degree\n\nof success was 90 percent. See id. at 103. Here, the degree of success was only\n\nabout 33 percent based of Hanson’s demand during trial and about 25 percent of\n\nwhat she sought before trial. CR 1541.
