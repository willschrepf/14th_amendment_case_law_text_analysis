Kevin Stephens: Appellee herein, and Third Party Defendant in the\n             court below (hereinafter “Appellee Stephens” or “Stephens”: or\n             “K.S.”).\n\nCollectively, hereinafter Circle Ridge and Stephens are referred to as “Appellee’s”.\n“Other parties to the court below, who are not parties to this appeal are as follows:\n      1.     Joseph B. Loftis, Defendant below (hereinafter sometimes either\n             “Loftis” or “Joe Loftis”).\n\n      2.    Ronald J. Abercrombie, Defendant in the trial court (hereinafter\nsometimes either “Abercrombie” or “R.J.A.”).\n\n\n      Further, for reference, the reporter’s record of the proceedings is hereinafter\n\nreferred to as “R.R.” and the clerk’s record or transcript is “C.R.”.\n\n             This central beginning point of this case is a sale occurring on\n\nSeptember 11, 2012 in which Great Northern Energy, Inc., (“Appellant”)\n\npurchased oil gas and mineral and lease hold interest from two parties, Circle\n\nRidge Production, Inc., and Kevin Stephens, (“Appellees”). The consideration\n\ngiven was $200,000 cash and a $700,000 installment note (“$700K note”), and\n                                     Page 11 of 93\n\fDeed of Trust in which Circle Ridge Production, Inc. and Kevin Stephens were\n\nnamed the beneficiaries. The interests which were the subject of the sale are called\n\nthe “OBENCO” leases, which cover approximately 1100 to 1200 acres in the\n\nWaskom, Texas area in Harrison County, Texas. Shortly after Great Northern\n\nEnergy acquired these properties, it purposed to include them in a package to be\n\nresold to a company called Rangeford Resources. Shortly after September 11,\n\n2012, one of the payees, Kevin Stephens, determined to participate with his interest\n\nin the transaction in the Rangeford Resources transfer. To that end, he transferred\n\nand assigned his interest in the note and Deed of Trust to Great Northern Energy.\n\naround December 1, 2012 and before the first installment on the purchase note was\n\ndue and payable. Subsequently, Circle Ridge Production, the remaining party of\n\n“Circle Ridge Production and Kevin Stephens” attempted to collect on only the\n\n“Circle Ridge” portion of the note, and determined to foreclose. It conducted a\n\nforeclosure sale on November 5, 2013. On December 26, 2013, simultaneously\n\nwith recording the Trustees Deed from the November 5, 2013 sale, it claimed it\n\n“acquired” the remaining interest in the $700K note through a purported\n\nassignment from “Kevin Stephens”.\n\n      Following this muddled state of affairs, Great Northern filed suit in Dallas\n\nCounty, Texas, in Cause No.14-04993, against Circle Ridge Production, Kevin\n\nStephens and Bill Briscoe, Circle Ridge Production’s President, and principal\n\n                                     Page 12 of 93\n\fshareholder. It alleged, causes of action for slander of title, breach of contract,\n\nunjust enrichment, and breach of implied covenant of good faith in fair dealing,\n\nnegligent misrepresentation, fraud, and torturous interference with contact with\n\nclaims for attorney’s fees. Circle Ridge Production and Bill Briscoe responded by\n\nfiling a Motion to Transfer Venue to Harrison County, and separately, filed suit in\n\nCause No. 2014-0460, alleging, that Great Northern had filed a notice of its\n\nassignment from Kevin Stephens of his rights with respect to his interest in the\n\n$700K note, and his liens and property rights with respect to the OBENCO leases.\n\n(which it alleged to be a forgery). Circle Ridge claimed that that “forged”\n\nassignment from Stephens to Great Northern clouded Circle Ridge’s title. The\n\nvenue in these actions was subsequently transferred to Harrison County, Texas,\n\nand the causes consolidated into Cause No.14-0460.\n\n      By the time of trial in October, 2015, Circle Ridge had filed its Fifth\n\nAmended Petition and Second Amended Answer, in which it asserted causes of\n\naction against Defendant Great Northern for possession of property (under a\n\nTrespass to Try Title) theory, removal of a cloud on title, (attributable to the note\n\nassignment, (from Stephens), breach of contract, for non-payment of the $700K\n\nnote). The Fifth Amended Petition also included claims against Joe Loftis and\n\nRonald J. Abercrombie for alleged violations of the Texas Civil Conspiracy and\n\nViolation of the Texas Theft Liability Act, and negligence. Great Northern had\n\n                                      Page 13 of 93\n\fexpanded the claims of which it presented in its trial petition as follows: against\n\nKevin Stephens for Breach of Contract, Unjust Enrichment, and failure to deliver\n\npurchased equipment, Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair\n\nDealing, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and tortuous interference with\n\ncontract, to remove cloud on Great Northern’s title, and for wrongful foreclosure\n\nagainst all Defendants including Briscoe, Circle Ridge and Kevin Stephens, for\n\nattorney’s fees and costs.\n\n      After midnight on October 20th and on October 21, 2015, Circle Ridge\n\nProduction filed its Notice of Non-Suit in which non-suited all claims Joe Loftis\n\nand Ronald J. Abercrombie individually, including its claims of civil conspiracy\n\nand violation of the Texas Theft Liability Act.\n\n      Trial in this matter was conducted before a jury commencing October 19,\n\n2015 after 3 ½ days of proceedings, the Court refused to allow Great Northern\n\nEnergy to submit any of its issues except wrongful foreclosure to the jury, granting\n\ndirected verdicts to Circle Ridge Production on all of Great Northern’s other\n\nclaims. The Court also ruled in favor of Circle Ridge with respect to removal of\n\nclaims as cloud of title, liability of Defendant Great Northern for Breach of\n\nContract, and for claims by third party Kevin Stephens for Breach of Contract by\n\nGreat Northern Energy. The Court further found that Great Northern owed Circle\n\nRidge Production the sum of $637,611.93 under terms of the $700K note. The only\n                                     Page 14 of 93\n\fissue submitted to the jury was with regard to Great Northern Energy’s claims that\n\nCircle Ridge had wrongfully foreclosed the lien and the Deed of Trust sale on\n\nNovember 5, 2013. The jury found adversely to Great Northern Energy with\n\nrespect to those issues submitted.\n\n      Based upon its directed verdict rulings, the Court entered Judgment for\n\nCircle Ridge Production against Great Northern Energy on Circle Ridge\n\nProductions claims against Great Northern Energy, and denied either liability or\n\nrecovery against Bill Briscoe, Kevin Stephens or Circle Ridge Production with\n\nrespect to all of Great Northern Energy’s claims. The Court entered its Judgment\n\non December 7, 2015. Further, on February 22, 2016, the Court overruled Great\n\nNorthern’s Motion for Judgment NOV and Motion for New Trial, presenting\n\nmany, if not all, of the issues presented by Appellants in this appeal.\n\n      From these preceding circumstances, Great Northern Energy brings this\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 15 of 93\n\f                    REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n\n\n      Appellant Great Northern Energy, Inc., has previously filed its Notice of\nAppeal in the Court from the \"Orders\" of the said 71\" District Court, Harrison\nCounty, Texas, dated March 30 & 31, 2016, which is pending herein as Cause\n#06-2016-15-CA, styled, Great Northern Energy, Incorporated, Appellant vs.\nCircle Ridge Production, Inc., Appellee.\n\n The Court should grant oral argument for the following reasons:\n\n       a.   Oral argument would give the Court a more complete\n            understanding of the facts presented in this appeal. See Tex. R.\n            App. P. 39.l (c).\n\n       b.   Oral argument would significantly aid the Court in deciding this\n            case. See Tex. R.\n            App. P. 38.l (e), 39.i (d).\n\n\n\n\n                                   Page 16 of 93\n\f                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      From Voir Dire, through ruling on Defendants’ Motions for New Trial and\n\nMotion for Directed Verdict, the record is filled with errors committed by the trial\n\ncourt. Certain rulings by the trial court arise from and relate to its refusal to allow\n\nDefendants to present factual evidence establishing the bases for their defenses,\n\ncounter-claims, and third party claims. All these erroneous rulings underlie, are\n\ncommon to, and result in various reversible rulings by the trial court. These\n\nevidentiary errors are presented as initial issues. Further they are incorporated into\n\nthe subsequent erroneous rulings of the Court in withdrawing Defendants’ rights to\n\nobtain proper jury findings and rulings in this case. Specifically, subsequent\n\nerroneous filings with respect to withdrawal of issues from the jury are specified,\n\nmany of which incorporate the evidentiary exclusions. From Appellants\n\nperspective, the errors are so numerous and glaring that it is impossible to submit\n\nthem in conformance with the ideal Rule of Presentation of only (3) areas. For\n\npurposes of clarity, and hopefully simplicity, the errors are organized within seven\n\neleven (11) groups or areas of wrongful conduct by the trial court; however, each\n\nissue is specified separately within the various groups. These areas are organized\n\nchronologically within the progress of the trial proceeding.\n\n      1. Errors in Voir Dire:\n\n          1-1. The Court erred in permitting counsel for 3d party Defendant\n\n\n                                      Page 17 of 93\n\f      Kevin Stephens to improperly attempt to bolster his evidentiary\n\n      contentions and prejudice Defendants through using his questions to\n\n      venire persons to support his contentions, over Defendants’\n\n      objections and to grant Defendants’ Motion for Mistrial following its\n\n      overruling of them.\n\n2.

Great Northern is entitled to judgment that Circle Ridge take\n\nnothing, with respect to its claims for Trespass to Try Title, because\n\nthere is no sufficient legal evidence which supports such\n\ndetermination.\n\n\n\n\n                          Page 28 of 93\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      One of America’s great trial lawyers, Abraham Lincoln learned to read\n\nin front of the fireplace in his log cabin. Among his early reading text was\n\nAESOP’S Fables. Lincoln loved recounting the stories he first read there.\n\nAmong his favorites was that of the “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing”, a story in\n\nwhich a lamb, seeking the wisdom and protection of its mother bounded up a\n\nhill to a figure apparently clad in a sheep’s skin. However, upon arrival, sadly\n\nthe lamb realized it encountered the wolf covered in its mother’s wool. Sadly\n\nit was devoured. Unfortunately, Appellants would liken the lamb’s experience\n\nto theirs in seeking justice and protection of the law in this case. Sadly, from\n\nthe commencement of voir dire through the Court’s ruling on Appellant’s Post\n\nJudgment Motions, they felt deceived at every turn and ultimately devoured\n\nby their trial court experience.\n\n      From the viewpoint of Appellant, Great Northern Energy, this lawsuit is the\n\neffort of Appellees Circle Ridge Production and Kevin Stephens to avoid the\n\nconsequences of the unauthorized foreclosure of a Deed of Trust lien and its\n\nattempt to enforce the liability of Appellant Great Northern Energy as first\n\nestablished in a promissory note in the principal sum of $700,000.00 (“$700K\n\nnote”) on September 11, 2012 and a deed of trust given as security therefore on\n\nthat date. The payees in the note and beneficiaries in the deed of trust were “Circle\n\n\n                                     Page 29 of 93\n\fRidge Production and Kevin Stephens”.

[page 8 of D.T.] As\n\nspecified the Uniform Commercial Code and in Texas case law ( as described in\n\nArgument and Authorities section III below) the proper enforcement of rights\n\ngranted in both the $700K note and deed of trust must be enforced in the name of\n\nboth, ”Circle Ridge Production and Kevin Stephens” and neither of those parties\n\ncan act alone in enforcement. However, in this case joint action never existed in\n\nconnection with enforcement or foreclosure, and legally it never could have\n\nexisted. Nevertheless, Circle Ridge Production attempted to and did conduct a\n\npurported foreclosure sale on November 5, 2013, (CR: 1085-1106), (RR: 3:134:9-\n\n1316:15) and asserts it right to enforce the $700K note in this lawsuit. Circle\n\nRidge’s efforts began in its Original Petition filed on June 18, 2014, (CR: 10) with\n\nits claim to own oil and gas interests in Harrison County, Texas. It further alleged\n\nthat the defendant Great Northern Energy had alleged it owned rights and titles\n\nwith respect to the liens, leases, and promissory note of September 11, 2012\n\nthrough an “assignment and bill of sale of oil and gas leases OBENCO purportedly\n\nsigned by Kevin Stephens as grantor purporting to convey all of Kevin Stephens’\n\nright title and interest to Great Northern.” (CR: 11) It further claimed that such\n\n\n                                     Page 30 of 93\n\fassignment was a forgery, “thereby rendering said Assignment and Bill of Sale\n\ninvalid and in no force and affect.” (CR: 11, 12) Its requested relief was that the\n\nCourt declare the Assignment and Bill of Sale from Stephens to Great Northern\n\ninvalid and unenforceable and ordering it removed from the title of property of\n\nsubject litigation and quieting title. (CR:13) Simply stated, Circle Ridge centered\n\nits claims upon the proposition that Great Northern had forged and assignment of\n\nKevin Stephens’ interest in and to $700K note from Kevin Stephens to Great\n\nNorthern Energy. Throughout the discovery and pretrial process Circle Ridge\n\nProduction maintained these positions, refining and expanding them through four\n\namendments to its Original Petition, including but not limited to its 5th Amended\n\nPetition upon which it based its prosecution in this trial. (CR: 1066-1125)\n\nCommencing in its First Amended Original Petition filed January 5, 2014, (CR:97)\n\nCircle Ridge expanded its claims of forgery of the Assignment from Kevin\n\nStephens to Great Northern and claims the principals of Great Northern Energy,\n\nJoe Loftis and R.J. Abercrombie has conspired to violate the Texas Civil\n\nConspiracy and Texas Theft Liability Acts in securing and recording the forged\n\nAssignment and Bill of Sale from Kevin Stephens to great Northern Energy. (Cr:\n\n101-102) These allegations continued throughout the pretrial period in successive\n\npleadings, Plaintiff 2nd Amended Petition filed on October 10, 2014 (CR: 680, 683-\n\n685), Plaintiff’s 3rd Amended Petition filed August 28, 2015 (Cr: 839, 845-847),\n\n\n                                     Page 31 of 93\n\fand in Plaintiff’s 5th Amended Petition, filed October 13, 2015 (CR: 1066, 1069-\n\n1074). However, apparently realizing its inability to establish the “forgery”\n\nallegations through competent evidence in trial, (see Statement of Facts, pages 29-\n\n30 herein). Circle Ridge surreptitiously abandoned its claims of allegations of\n\nforgery shortly after midnight, on the 2nd day of testimony, to-wit: around midnight\n\non October 20, 2015 at 12:32 a.m., (CR: 1237), in which it Non-suited all claims\n\nregarding, Non-suiting all claims against Loftis and Abercrombie, individually for\n\nviolation of civil conspiracy or of the Texas Theft Liability Act, (CR: 1238) and\n\nalso any other claims against Loftis or Abercrombie individually. Thus, when it\n\ncame time to put up or shut up, concerning Circle Ridges allegations that the\n\nAssignment of Kevin Stephens was a forged document, Circle Ridge tucked its tail\n\nand ran from any effort to prove the veracity of those allegations through\n\ncompetent evidence. Further, being unable to establish that the assignment of\n\nKevin Stephens’ interest in the $700K note and deed of trust to Great Northern in\n\nDecember 2012 was not legitimate, (CR:1238), Circle Ridge proceeded to attempt\n\nto cover its tracks for its unauthorized acts in conducting the foreclosure sale of\n\nNovember 5, 2013 (Cr:1238), RR: 3:230:14-237:20) or attempting to enforce\n\ncollection on the $700K note (CR: 1066,1075-1077, 1078-1079) (RR: 3:99:1-\n\n100:25), by enlisting the assistance of the trial Court. It’s assistance was in\n\nexcluding virtually all evidence tending to establish that neither it, nor its\n\n\n                                      Page 32 of 93\n\fdesignated Trustee Dean Searle, failed to act with proper authority in foreclosing\n\non November 5, 2013 ( RR:3:145:17-146:9, 3:146:15-149:10), or filing suit to\n\nenforce collection of the note.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 33 of 93\n\f                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n\n\n      As stated in the statement of facts, the overarching and underlying legal\n\nrelationships in this cause arise through a note of September 11, 2012 and Deed of\n\nTrust contemporaneously executed to secure its payment. The designated payee\n\nand beneficiaries in both instruments are “Circle Ridge Production, Inc., and\n\nKevin Stephens”. Because of this designation, under law, the consent of both\n\nparties, acting together, is necessary in any enforcement or collection efforts. All\n\narguments and authorities supporting those propositions are set forth in Section II\n\nArgument and Authorities.\n\n      Because Circle Ridge had conducted a wrongful foreclosure sale, acting\n\nwithout the proper authority of its remaining joint tenant Kevin Stephens, or his\n\nsuccessor in interest Great Northern Energy, Inc., Appellees initially attempted to\n\ncover their omission by claiming that as assignment of Stephens’ interest in the\n\nnote and Deed of Trust to Great Northern Energy was “forged”. All evidence, both\n\ndocumentary and testimony, that Kevin Stephens had assigned his interest to Great\n\nNorthern Energy before any foreclosure attempts or enforcement action by Circle\n\nRidge Production occurred. Notwithstanding that mountain of evidence, the court\n\nimproper allowed Kevin Stephens to testify that he gave permission to Circle\n\nRidge Production to foreclose on Great Northern, almost 10 to 11 months after he\n\n\n                                     Page 34 of 93\n\fhad assigned his interest away to Great Northern. That testimony was admitted and\n\npresented to the jury although Great Northern Energy was not allowed to present\n\nits rebuttal evidence. (See Section IV, Argument and Authorities). The testimony\n\nexcluded was not of a single witness, but rather that of 5 witnesses, including\n\nadmissions by Kevin Stephens to the effect that Great Northern had purchased\n\nKevin Stephens’ interest in the note long before any foreclosure was attempted.\n\n(See Section IV, Argument and Authorities).\n\n      The court further compounded these errors by improperly overruling\n\nAppellants counsels attempts to have the court declare a mistrial, both at the outset\n\nduring voir dire, when counsel for Kevin Stephens attempted to illegally inject\n\nevidence into the minds of the jury pool, and at the conclusion because of the\n\nmassive evidentiary exclusions.\n\n      (See Sections 6 and 7 below Argument and Authorities )\n\n      The court further compounded its errors in excluding testimony, by ruling\n\nagainst Great Northern Energy in numerous instances because it ruled that no\n\nevidence appeared of record to support submission of issues to the jury. However,\n\nthe court had excluded that evidence which was offered on a bill. Both those\n\nprocedures are improper as outlined in Section_4__ below, Argument and\n\nAuthorities. The court further compounded it errors by improperly shifting the\n\nburden of proof from Circle Ridge to Great Northern regarding the wrongful\n\n\n                                     Page 35 of 93\n\fforeclosure issues insofar as they affected Appellees claims that Great Northern\n\nwas trespassing against its title. And avoiding the burden of proof on Great\n\nNorthern with respect to which party had responsibility to establish that the\n\nforeclosure sale of November 5, 2013 was properly authorized. The court further\n\nallow improper argument by counsel for Appellees in support of the answers to\n\njury issues. (All is more particularly specified in Section 7, Argument and\n\nAuthorities).\n\n      Finally, the court committed error in overruling Great Northern Energys\n\nMotion for New Trial and Motion for Judgment NOV, insofar as it granted Circle\n\nRidges Trespass to Try Title judgment on the basis of a wholly insufficient legal\n\nbasis because evidence of title and third parties was introduced into the record and\n\nnegated and because Circle Ridge impleaded the parties into the cause who later\n\nfiled answers, to wit: the United States Government with an Internal Revenue\n\nService lien, without establishing a proper evidentiary basis to exclude that lien.\n\nFinally, it improperly ruled that Circle Ridge had the right to collect the $700K\n\nnote proceeds from Great Northern Energy, when in fact, in law, there has never\n\nbeen any proper enforcement of the note.\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 36 of 93\n\f                        ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n\n                                    I.\n                            STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n Because different standards of review apply to the various issues presented as\n\nerrors in this brief, each standard is separately stated within the specific areas to\n\nwhich it applies.\n\n                                          II.\n\n                    September 11, 2012 Note and Deed of Trust\n\n        As previously described in the Statement of Facts, central events in this\n\n dispute arise from the enforcement attempts and foreclosure by Circle Ridge\n\n Production of a Promissory note in the original principal sum of $700,000.00,\n\n together with a Deed of Trust securing same, and both made to “Circle Ridge\n\n Production, Inc. and Kevin Stephens”, as payees in the note, (CR1107-1111)\n\n and_(RR3:98:1-98:24) and beneficiaries in the Deed of Trust. (CR1084:1106) (RR\n\n Ex.9). These designations, created a joint tenancy, and, in this case, requires that\n\n both Circle Ridge Production, Inc., and Kevin Stephens must act to enforce the\n\n note, §3.3110 (d), Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. (2016), or authorize the trustee to\n\n foreclose the deed of trust lien indeed, the Deed of Trust itself designates “Circle\n\n Ridge Inc., and Kevin Stephens” as “Beneficiary”.(CR 1085)(RR Ex 9, page 1.)\n\n Further, in article 3, “Defaults & Remedies”, the Deed of Trust provides at\n                                        Page 37 of 93\n\fparagraph 3.2 “remedies”…”Beneficiary may…do any one or more of the\n\nfollowing to the extent permitted by applicable law: (c)…Foreclosure…request the\n\ntrustee to proceed with foreclosure. (CR 1092, Ex 9, (Everbank v. Seedergy\n\nVentures, Inc., 2016 Tex.App. LEXIS 7319 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2016), But, in this case, no such joint action occurred, nor was it ever possible at\n\nany time after January 1, 2013, because in December, 2012, Kevin Stephens\n\nassigned all of his right, title and interest in the note and liens to Great Northern\n\nEnergy, (RR3:98:1-98:24); and Great Northern Energy paid the consideration of\n\napproximately $60,000.000, to Kevin Stephens’ family members, (RR3:227:8-\n\n230:13), as directed by Kevin Stephens, (RR3:227:8-230:13). There is enormous\n\nsignificance in the impact of the word “and” in this designation.\n\n      Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, Texas Business and Commerce\n\nCode adaption of the UCC, controls enforcement of rights arising pursuant to\n\npromissory notes and negotiable instruments. The relevant statutory provision is\n\n§3.110, “Identification of the Person to Who Instrument is Payable” Tex. Bus. &\n\nCom. Code Ann.§3.3110 (West 2015). Specifically, subsection (d) of §3.3110\n\nprovides in relevant part, “…(i)f an instrument is payable to two or more persons\n\nnot alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged,\n\nor enforced only by all of them.” Id. at §3.3110(d). The Comment 4 attached to\n\n(and part of) this Code section discusses subsection (d) with this explanation:\n\n\n                                      Page 38 of 93\n\f        “…If an instrument is payable to X and Y, neither X nor Y acting\n        alone can be the holder of the instrument. The instrument is ‘payable to\n        an identified person.’ The ‘identified person’ is X and Y acting jointly.\n        Section 3-109(b) and 1-102(5)(a). Thus,…X or Y acting alone, cannot be\n        the holder or person entitled to enforce or negotiate the instrument because\n        either, acting alone, cannot be the holder or the person entitled to enforce,\n        or negotiate the instrument because neither, acting alone, is the identified\n        person stated in the instrument.”\n\n        Thus, Circle Ridge, acting alone does not have the power to enforce or\n\nforeclose on the liens securing payment thereof. See Johnson v. Cox, 630 S.W.2d\n\n492 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi, 1982, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n        Section 3.201 of the Texas UCC (Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. §3.201\n\n (West 2015), governs “Negotiation”. Although the specific statutory language of\n\n that section does not squarely address the issue presented here, a statement in the\n\n “Commentary” following that section does, see Comment 5 to §3.203, and\n\n Commentary, “No Partial Negotiation or Transfer” and “Distinction between\n\n right to enforce instrument and ownership of instrument, “Anderson, Bartlett &\n\n East’s Texas Uniform Commercial Code Annotated(2007 Edition-West\n\n Publishing)i.d. A paragraph of the Commentary section is entitled, “Effect of\n\n attempted partial negotiation” states:\n\n        “Negotiation is all or nothing. Subsection 3.203(d) and Comment 5\n        make it clear that the cause of action on an instrument cannot be split.\n        An indorsement and delivery purporting to transfer less than the entire\n        Instrument cannot be a negotiation. It may, however, be a partial\n        Assignment as recognized in the last sentence of §3.203(d). …”\n\n\n                                      Page 39 of 93\n\f          Further, Section 3.203. “Transfer of Instrument” (Tex. Bus. & Com. Code\n\nAnn.§3.203 (West 2015), specifies in its subsection (b), “transfer of an instrument,\n\nwhether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the\n\ntransferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course.\n\n“… Comment 5 to §3.203, provides in relevant part, “…(t)he cause of action to\nenforce an instrument cannot be split. Any indorsement which purports to convey\nto any party less than the entire amount of the instrument is not effective for\nnegotiation. …An indorsement purporting to convey less than the entire\ninstrument does, however, operate as a partial assignment of the cause of action…..\nA partial assignee of an instrument has rights only to the extent the applicable law\ngive rights, either at law or in equity, to a partial assignee.”\n\n\nAmong the most recent declaration of those rights which may be assigned was set\n\nforth in Federal Financial Co. v. Delgado, 1 S.W.3d 181, 185, where the Court\n\nstated, “a transferee of an instrument receives whatever rights his transferor has.”\n\nIn this case, the relevant language in the transfer instrument from Stephens to GNE\n\nstates:\n\n       “IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND UNDERSTOOD, FOR AND IN\nCONSIDERATION OF ONE DOLLAR AND OTHER GOOD AND\nVALUABLE CONSIDERATION, IN HAND PAID BY THE PARTIES HERETO\nAND ACKNOWLEDGE BY THEM AS SUFFICIENT, that Kevin Stephens,\nIndividually and as any or no portion of ownership in Circle Ridge Production,\nInc., (hereinafter called KS) does hereby sell, transfer, bargain, let, provide\npossession and domain over and otherwise gives unto Great Northern Energy, Inc.\n(hereinafter GNE) all of KS right, title and interest in and to that certain debt\ninstrument wherein KS is lender unto GNE under and note, and according to the\nherein state terms and conditions: to wit: KS does hereby, effective December 1st,\n2013, sell and grant his undivided portion, whatever such portion may be, but not\nless than 50% of, that certain note due from GNE unto KS and Circle Ridge\n\n\n                                      Page 40 of 93\n\fProduction, Inc., jointly, and that certain Deed of Trust attached thereto, and\nsubject in and to the OBENCO leases and wells, as shown ….”\n\n      …Kevin Stephens is assigning this debt in whole and as part of the original\ncontract and debt instrument and …Kevin Stephen transfers (sic) his rights, in any\nform or manner, under those agreement…”(RR Ex GN 18,4:310-11-\n311:22,4:325:20-25,3:210:3-213:25)\n\n      Further, the identified beneficiaries or beneficiary of the Deed of Trust as\n\nstated on its face is Circle Production and Kevin Stephens. Texas is jurisdiction\n\nin which the lien follows the note. In other words, enforcement of the lien must\n\ncomply with the terms of the note. There can be no greater or separate right for\n\nenforcement of the lien beyond the authority of the note it secures. (Case\n\ncitation). Campbell v.

(RR 2:124:\n\n13-2:126-24, and specifically: asking about the quality of wells as being “only\n\nstripper wells” (RR 2:128 17-129:24), again, over Defendants attorneys objection,\n\nManass also conducted improper voir dire with venire person Williams concerning\n\npsychological tendencies of persons, aimed at discrediting Joe Loftis (RR 2:128\n\n10-129-23). As stated, these questions were submitted with an idea to planting\n\npreconceived opinions of the Defendants as can be further seen below.\n\nIt, impacted one of the jurors who was selected and deliberated. The test for the\n\nCourts rulings on Defendants objections to voir dire is an abuse of discretion.\n\nCortez v. HCCI-SAN ANTONIO INC., 159 S.W. 3d, 87(Tex. 2005).

(CR1085-1111)(RR3:99:1-100:25), (Ex.8)) In trial, Circle\n\nRidge attempted to convince the jury that is could proceed in its collection and\n\nenforcement efforts, acting alone because it had been authorized to do so by\n\nKevin Stephens in behalf of Kevin Stephens and Circle Ridge Production, Inc.\n\nBill Briscoe testified Kevin Stephens gave him oral permission to foreclose in\n\nNovember, 2013, (RR 3:104: 17-109:24). Kevin Stephens testified that he gave\n                                     Page 43 of 93\n\fBill Briscoe permission to foreclose on his interest in the $700K note and Deed\n\nof Trust, (RR3:200:19-202:19), Circle Ridge Production argued that fact to the\n\nCourt (RR 5:14”23-18:3) (RR 3:200:19-202:19). However, the Court wholly and\n\ncompletely to refused to allow Defendants to offer testimony through either the\n\ncross examination of Kevin Stephens (RR3:210:3-213:25), the direct testimony\n\nof Joe Loftis (RR4:38:6-4:39:11), the direct testimony of Michael Stephens\n\n(RR4:292:17-305:11), that Kevin Stephens had assigned his interest in the\n\npromissory note, as permitted by Section 3:201, (TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE\n\nANN.) (LEXIS NEXIS 2016 ).\n\n      However, specific testimony as set forth below was offered by Joe Loftis,\n\nof the negotiation, and execution and delivery of the note and Deed of Trust lien\n\nassignment by Kevin Stephens (RR4:38:6-4:39:11,4:141:127-151:4), as well as\n\nthe payment of the sum of $10,000 to Michael Stephens (RR4:141:17-151:4) and\n\n$50,000 Kevin Stephens father Bobby Stephens (RR4:141:17-151:4) at Kevin\n\nStephens direction, (Michael Stephens testimony)(RR4:303:13-305:11). That\n\ntestimony was supported by both Joe Loftis and Kevin Stephens, and the\n\nadmission of Kevin Stephens under oath in cross examination under Defendants\n\nbill of exceptions, that he had executed contracts assigning such note and its\n\nattached liens to Circle Ridge in December 2012, (RR3:210:3-213:25). Further,\n\nMichael Stephens testified that he had personally informed Bill Briscoe,\n\n                                     Page 44 of 93\n\fPresident of Circle Ridge Production, Inc., all of the Stephens family’s\n\nassignments to Great Northern,(RR4:298:20-299:1), relevant and material to the\n\njury determination of the issues presented to it, namely: whether the foreclosure\n\nof November 5, 2013 was properly conducted. It would not be properly\n\nconducted if the trustee conducting that sale did not have proper authority to do\n\nso. As set forth in Sec. II, page 35-39, above, it is axiomatic that Circle Ridge\n\nacting alone, did not have the authority to enforce the note. (Subsection D),\n\n(Section 3.3110, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code.) (West 2015).\n\n      The court erred in its refusal to allow the testimony of Lofts, that Kevin\n\nStephens sold and assigned his interest in the underlying note and liens to Circle\n\nRidge as (RR4:38:6-39:11-Bill of Exceptions) (and through Exhibits 16, 17, 18,\n\n20, and 21) the testimony of Kevin Stephens acknowledging that he signed such\n\ndocuments (and sold his interest) (RR3:210:3-213:25, and Exhibits 16,17,and 18)\n\nthe testimony of his brother Michael Stephens that such transaction occurred, and\n\nthe testimony of Kayla Marrs, impeaching Kevin Stephens insofar as he denied\n\nexecuting one of the contracts (Kayla Marrs being the notary before whom he\n\nappeared to acknowledge his execution) (RR3:216:9-219:5). Four separate\n\nwitnesses testified that Kevin Stephens assigned his rights in and to the $700K\n\nnote and its underlying liens to Great Northern Energy, yet the Court wholly\n\nexcluded, blocked and prevented the jury from having any knowledge\n\n                                     Page 45 of 93\n\fwhatsoever of such occurrence. The reason initially given by the Court for\n\nexcluding such evidence was that the assignment instrument offered by\n\nAppellants, was excluded by the statute of frauds objections of Circle Ridge;\n\nhowever, when Defendants counsel pointed out on the morning of the 2nd day of\n\ntrial, that statute of frauds did not apply because it did not apply to an assignment\n\nof mortgage, and the contract was a performed contract, nevertheless, the Court\n\npersisted in excluding Defendants attempts to offer defensive testimony as just\n\noutlined, saying that “I just don’t think you can block a foreclosure by buying\n\n1% of a note.” (RR4:311:24-322:17) That comment by the Court indicates three\n\nareas of bias or prejudice and prejudgment of this case. First, it is not reflective\n\nof any of the testimony of the case, because there is no evidence that anyone\n\nbought or attempted to buy only 1% of a note to block a foreclosure. Rather, the\n\nevidence in this case (albeit offered through the Bill of Exception) conclusively\n\nestablishes that the transaction to purchase Kevin Stephens interest occurred\n\nDecember 2012, almost a year before the foreclosure.(RR3:210:3-213:25). There\n\nwas no discussion of foreclosure at the time the Defendant Great Northern\n\nEnergy purchased the note. Second, the Courts application of that ruling is\n\ncompletely contrary to the applicable standards of both the uniform commercial\n\ncode, of the express language of the Deed of Trust, and of joint tenancy rules\n\nwhich require the action of both parties who then own the note at the time of the\n\n\n                                      Page 46 of 93\n\fforeclosure to proceed with enforcement. Through its exclusion of evidence, the\n\nCourt left the jury with the impression that Kevin Stephens owned an interest in\n\nthe note and had the right to grant his consent in November 2013, when he had\n\nparted with his ownership interest in and to the note in December 2012. Finally,\n\nthe Court substitutes its preference for outcome i.e. that Appellants cannot\n\ncontest foreclosure actions without giving the jury the opportunity to fully weigh\n\nall relevant evidence.\n\n      Insofar as the Court refused to admit Appellants Exhibits #16 (the Rojo\n\nBurro contract wherein Kevin Stephens agrees to assign interest in and to the\n\nnote and liens to Great Northern), #17 (additional Rojo Burro contract\n\nacknowledging before Kayla Marrs), #18 (note and lien assignment from Kevin\n\nStephens to Great Northern (#GN12, exhibit Defendant #12) as offered,\n\nRR3:196:2-199:1, 3:200-19-209:18,3:220:1-223:1, GN Ex. 16 & 18, it prevented\n\nAppellants from proving their defenses, rebutting Appellees testimony regarding\n\nits authority to foreclose, and from proving their affirmative claims.\n\n(RR:4:239:5-241:8). Clearly all of this testimony is relevant and material, as the\n\nTexas Supreme Court indicated in its ruling in Anderson v. Gilbert, 897 S.W.2d,\n\n783, 784-785, per curiam, overruling the 5th Court of Appeals in Dallas for its\n\nfailure to properly evaluate claims as to whether only one of the joint tenants in a\n\nnote in which …”Gilbert and Gideon” were joint payees of the note and joint\n\n                                     Page 47 of 93\n\fbeneficiaries of the Deed of Trust id. at 784 had properly acted through only one\n\nof the joint tenants in causing a foreclosure sale to be executed and sue for a\n\ndeficiency. id.at 785. The Texas Supreme Court reversed the Dallas Court of\n\nAppeals for failing to evaluate whether only one joint tenant (in an “and” note\n\nand Deed of Trust situation) had received a proper assignment of the interest\n\nfrom the remaining joint tenant of their rights under the note before conducting\n\nthe foreclosure or engaging in enforcement. id at 785. It ordered the Appellate\n\nCourt to consider and evaluate the claims of a note payee that no proper\n\nassignment of the interest of Gideon or his widow had occurred before Gilbert\n\nacted alone to…cause a foreclosure sale to be executed and sue Anderson for\n\ndeficiency. i.d. at 785. This analysis is precisely in point in this case. If a Court\n\nof Appeals must evaluate whether one joint tenant has properly assignment\n\ninterest to a second joint tenant, before the second commences foreclosure or\n\nnote enforcement actions, clearly the trial court must allow the admission of such\n\nevidence. Further, these facts were identified in the testimony of Nate Moran\n\n(RR:220:9-222:1), documentary evidence of the contract by Kevin Stephens to\n\nassign his interest in the note and liens, the actual assignment,(Exhibits GN 16,\n\n17, 18, & RR 4:310:11-311:22, 4:325:225), and the testimony of Nate Moran,\n\nthat he had calculated payments to Circle Ridge Productions only, in calculating\n\nthe amounts due on the note (RR: 4:239:5-241:8). Thus, the only party with\n\n\n                                       Page 48 of 93\n\fwhom Mr. Moran dealt in representing Great Northern, was Dean Searle, who\n\nacted in behalf of Circle Ridge Production, solely.\n\n      Similarly, the Court erred in excluding the testimony of Michael Stephens,\n\nthat the Rojo Burro transaction was a part of the sale and assignment of the\n\nKevin Stephens interest in the $700K note to Great Northern (RR:4:248:13-\n\n250:251).\n\n      The Court systematically excluded either oral testimony and/or documentary\n\nevidence offered through oral testimony, relating to any attempt by Great Northern\n\nto establish before the jury that Kevin Stephens had assigned his interest in the\n\nnote and Deed of Trust of September 11, 2012, to Great Northern Energy before\n\nthe foreclosure on November 5, 2013. Further, it excluded evidence that the\n\nPresident of Circle Ridge Production, Bill Briscoe, had notice of that assignment\n\nbefore he attempted any foreclosure as did his attorney, Dean Searle, who was the\n\ntrustee conducting the foreclosure sale on November 5, 2013.(RR3:145:17-146:9)\n\nThe Court excluded the testimony of 5 separate witnesses regarding events\n\nconnected to the assignment, or collection or enforcement of the $700K note, as set\n\nforth below. No testimony or exhibits relating to the assignment from Kevin\n\nStephens to Great Northern were admitted before the jury. The Court wholly\n\nexcluded and prohibited the jury from knowledge of any such relevant and material\n\nevidence. However, all of such testimony was introduced in Bills of Exception by\n\n                                     Page 49 of 93\n\fAppellants. Simply stated, the Court refused to allow Appellants to introduce\n\nmaterial and relevant evidence supporting their claims and defenses before the\n\njury, on a systematic and intentional basis. The following specific testimony which\n\nDefendants attempted to offer through the individuals identified, was excluded and\n\nappears on a Bill as hereafter indicated:\n\n      a.     Errors in excluding Kevin Stephens’ testimony and exhibits:\n\n      b.     Errors in excluding testimony and exhibits offered through Bill of\n\n             Exceptions testimony of Kevin Stephens:\n\nThe Court allowed Bill Briscoe to testify that he obtained “oral” permission to\n\nforeclose his lien from Kevin Stephens, (RR 3:105: 17-109:24). He further claimed\n\nthat after the foreclosure sale he purchased Kevin Stephens’ interest in the note,\n\n(CRP Ex 11, assignment from Kevin Stephens to Circle Ridge Production dated\n\nDecember 11, 2013) (RR 3:112:10-113:24, CRP Ex 11). Bill Briscoe did\n\nacknowledge that all documents including the promissory note and Deed of Trust\n\nwere made jointly payable to Circle Production and Kevin Stephens and that both\n\nCircle Ridge Production and Kevin Stephens were the designated beneficiaries of\n\nthe Deed of Trust.(RR3:134:9-136:15). He further acknowledged that the\n\nforeclosure demand (CRP Ex 15)(RR3:136:15-138:22), states it is only in behalf of\n\nCircle Ridge Production interest in the note, (RR 3:138:20-140:10). Briscoe further\n\nacknowledged that the demand letter of July 2013 and the October demand letter of\n\n\n                                     Page 50 of 93\n\fforeclosure (CRP Ex 14), were in behalf of Circle Ridge Production (RR 3:143:10-\n\n145:14). Briscoe further acknowledged that Kevin Stephens had told him he had\n\nparticipated with Great Northern in the Rangeford Resources transaction, (RR\n\n3:145:17-146:9). However, the Court refused to allow Great Northerns attorney to\n\ncross examine Mr. Briscoe when he attempted to specifically obtain Mr. Briscoe’s\n\nadmission that it had prior notice before the foreclosure, (RR 3:146:15-149:10). It\n\nfurther excluded evidence which Appellants counsel attempted to offer that Circle\n\nRidge Production did not own Kevin Stephens interest on November 5, 2013,\n\nwhen it foreclosed, (RR 3:151:22-153:6). It further refused to allow the\n\nintroduction of correspondence with Nate Moran, (CRP Ex 20), establishing the\n\namount of $171, 000 as a payoff amount on Circle Ridges portion of the note in\n\ncorrespondence between Dean Searle and Great Northern, a payoff sheet from\n\nDean Searle, acting as attorney for Circle Ridge (RR 3:158:4-162:9).\n\nNotwithstanding these refusals to permit cross-examination by Great Northerns’\n\ncounsel, it allowed Kevin Stephens’ attorney to examine and introduce into\n\nevidence through Bill Briscoe, Bill Briscoe’s claim that he had no notice that\n\nKevin Stephens had assigned his interest in the $700K note before he received his\n\nassignment of Kevin Stephens’ interest on December 13, 2013.(RR 3:146:15-\n\n149:10).\n\n      The Court allowed testimony from Kevin Stephens that he gave Bill Briscoe\n\n\n                                    Page 51 of 93\n\fpermission to foreclose his interest on the $700K note and Deed of Trust (RR\n\n3:201:8-13, 200:19-202:19). Inexplicably, it refused to allow Great Northerns\n\nattorney to cross-examine Kevin Stephens to dispute the fact that he had any\n\nownership interest in either the note or the Deed of Trust lien at the time he sold\n\nhis interest to Briscoe in December 2013.(RR3:210:3-213:25, 3:220:1-223:13)or\n\n(RR 3:200:19-201:13, 3:203 25-209:18). Instead, the Court only allowed Great\n\nNorthern Energy’s attorney to present its cross-examination of Kevin Stephens in a\n\nBill of Exceptions: (RR 3:210:3-252:17 and 4:31:22). During the course of Kevin\n\nStephens’s testimony, taken during the Bill of Exceptions by Appellants attorney,\n\nKevin Stephens testified among other facts as follows:\n\n             1. That he admitted he signed the document introduced as GN Ex 16,\n\naround December 1, 2012 (RR 3:210:3-213-:25), in which he assigned his interest\n\nin the note and Deed of Trust and Lien (GN Ex 18)(RR3:210:3-213:25, 4:310:11-\n\n311:22,325:20-25) accompanying the note to Great Northern in order to participate\n\nproposed transaction wherein the “OBENCO” package would be included in the\n\nRangeford Resources transaction. He denied that he had signed a similar contract\n\n(GN Ex 17) Rojo Burro to Great Northern Energy contract before an independent\n\nnotary, Kayla Marrs, around October 24, 2012, (RR3:215:4-216:25), and\n\nequivocating as to whether his signature appeared on the document (RR 3:216:9-\n\n219:25). Although he denied the validity or genuineness of his signature on GN 17\n\n\n                                     Page 52 of 93\n\fbefore Kayla Marrs, an independent notary, he did acknowledge signing the\n\nagreements which were (GN Ex 16 & 18), the original Rojo Burro contract he\n\nadmitted signing and the actual assignment of all of his right title and interest,\n\nincluding (GN Ex 18), which is a purchase of note and financial instrument Kevin\n\nStephens into Great Northern Energy, Inc., “OBENCO” properties. Kevin\n\nStephens acknowledged executing that document on that date. Kevin Stephens\n\nfurther acknowledged that Great Northern tendered the sum of $10,000 to his\n\nbrother Michael Stephens and $50,000 to his dad Bobby Stephens in satisfaction of\n\nits obligations under Ex 16 and 18 in December, 2012 (RR 3:227:8-230-13).\n\nB. The Court erred in refusing to allow Joe Loftis, President of Great Northern\n\nEnergy, Inc., to testify concerning Kevin Stephens assignments of his interests.\n\n      The Court erred in excluding the testimony of Joe Loftis, President of Great\n\nNorthern Energy, Inc., (offered on a Bill of Exceptions) (RR:4:141:17-151:4), that\n\nGreat Northern entered into a contract with Kevin Stephens and Michael Stephens\n\nfor the acquisition of Kevin Stephens interests in the $700K promissory note and\n\nDeed of Trust, through (GN Ex 16, 17,) (RR4:141:17:144:11). It excluded\n\ntestimony explaining Kevin Stephens’ election to take $62,500 initially and\n\n$62,500 on one year after December 1, 2012, to wit: December 1, 2013 (RR\n\n4:144:2-17.) Further, Loftis testified on the Bill of Exceptions that Kevin Stephens\n\nassigned the document to Great Northern in GN Ex 18(RR: 144:18-145:24). He\n\n\n                                      Page 53 of 93\n\ffurther testified that the $62,500 was paid in the form of $10,000 to Michael\n\nStephens, $50,000 to Kevin Stephens’ father, Bobby Stephens, (RR 150:15). Loftis\n\nfurther testified on the Bill of Exception that Bill Briscoe knew of the transactions\n\nbetween Great Northern and Kevin Stephens by virtue of having come to Great\n\nNortherns office to discuss those transactions (RR 4:150:19-151:5).\n\nC. The Court erred in exclusion of Kayla Marrs testimonies as offered on the\n\nBill of Exceptions. Kayla Marrs, is a notary public who acknowledged GN Ex17\n\n(RR 4:206 :22-207-15). She verified that her acknowledgement on GN Ex 17 was\n\nvalid and impeached Kevin Stephens testimony that he had executed and\n\nacknowledged the same, as he did that before her and in her presence (RR\n\n4:207:16-209:5).\n\nD. The Court erred in excluding the testimony of Nathaniel Moran, as offered on\n\nhis Bill of Exceptions, (RR 4:239:5-241:8) to the effect that the only party against\n\nwhom Dean Searle represented he was attempting to enforce the $700K note was\n\nin behalf Circle Ridge Production, and not Circle Ridge Productions and Kevin\n\nStephens, in the summer and fall of 2013. The Court further erred in failing to\n\nadmit GN Ex 12, tendered with that testimony and Ex D12(RR:4:220:9-221:1) and\n\nEx D15(RR:4:218:14-220:8) regarding payment by Great Northern on the $700K\n\nnote. (GN Ex 15, letter of October 11 from Dean Searle, Demand, (RR4:218:14-\n\n220:8).\n\n\n                                     Page 54 of 93\n\f                 Errors excluding Michael Stephens’ testimony:\n\nE. The Court erred in refusing to admit GN Ex 15 offered with the testimony of\n\nMichael Stephens explaining the substance of the Great Northern transaction\n\nwhich included assignment of all interests in the $700K note formally owned by\n\nKevin Stephens (RR4: 296:1-298:4). The Court erred in excluding Michael\n\nStephens testimony that he personally delivered notice to Mr. Briscoe of the\n\nStephens families decision to participate with Great Northern in the Rangeford\n\nResources transaction and to assign its interest in the $700K note to Great Northern\n\ntogether with all liens, in the fall of 2012 (RR 4: 298:5-299:1): The court erred in\n\nexcluding Michael Stephens identification of GN Ex 16 & 18 (the assignment) and\n\nexplaining the terms of payment and the payment of same: for $62,500 (RR4:299\n\n9-302:3) and expressing (RR: 4:300:14-302:12). The Court erred in excluding the\n\ntestimony Michael Stephens acknowledging the receipt of the checks for $10,000\n\nand $50,000 in December of 2012 in satisfaction of the obligations established in\n\nthe Rojo Burro contracts GN Ex16, 17 & 18 (RR 4:303:13-305:11). Further, the\n\nCourt erred in excluding the testimony of Michael Stephens, as offered in the Bill\n\nof Exceptions regarding the financial and business relationships between Kevin\n\nStephens and Chad Hamilton (RR4:305:12-307:13). The Court erred in excluding\n\nthe testimony offered in the Bill of Exceptions of Michael Stephens regarding\n\nKevin Stephens role in the disappearance of equipment sold to Great Northern for\n\n\n                                     Page 55 of 93\n\fuse on the leases and that is(RR:4:307:25-309:2)\n\n\n\n\n                     Standard of Review – Evidence Exclusion\n\n      Each and all of the evidentiary exclusions, standards for review and\n\nrestrictions on Appellants counsel’s ability to conduct cross-examination or present\n\ntheir case, constitutes the greatest restrictions on the ability of parties to present\n\nAppellants’ case. Approximately 80% of the evidentiary offers by Appellants were\n\nexcluded. While certain evidentiary exclusions or rulings may not be reversible\n\nerror, clearly these were. The improper exclusion of competent and relevant\n\nevidence to material injury of the complaining party should result in reversal. See:\n\nAnderson v. Gilbert, supra, Modine Mfg.Co. the North E. Ind. School District, 503\n\nS.W. 2d, 833(Tex.Civ.App-Beaumont 1973, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Appellants recognize\n\nthat the standard of valuation of whether or not the trial court committed reversible\n\nerror is an abuse of discretion, by the trial Court. However, the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has said that the harmfulness of evidentiary rulings is determined by\n\nexamining the entire record to see whether a judgment was controlled by the\n\ntestimony in question. Mancorp, Inc. v. Culpepper, 802 S.W. 2d, 226, 230 (Tex.\n\n1990). Jamail v. Anchor Mort. Services, Inc., 809 S.W. 2d 221, 223(Tex.1991),\n\nreh’g of writ of error overruled, June 19, 1991). However, no specific test for\n\n\n                                       Page 56 of 93\n\fdetermining whether an improper exclusion of evidence was reasonably calculated\n\nto cause and probably did cause the rendition of an improper judgment: McCraw v.\n\nMaris, 828, S.W. 2d, 756, 758(Tex.1992). In fact, in response to Appellants\n\nattorney’s objections regarding the exclusion of Appellants evidence, the Court\n\nacknowledged understanding Appellants attorney’s objections, but responded, that\n\nhe did not believe that the Appellant could “block” a foreclosure by buying 1% of\n\nthe note. (RR4:316:25-317:8). Clearly, this comment indicates the Judge’s bias,\n\nprejudice or pre-judgment of this case. Further, in the issues submitted to the jury\n\nthe specific inquiry into question number one was “requesting whether “Great\n\nNorthern Energy established a defect in the foreclosure sale of November 5, 2013.”\n\nA defect would be a foreclosure sale (CR 1254) would be one that was conducted\n\nwithout proper authorization. However, in all of the evidence recited above in\n\nitems the Court blocked Great Northerns attempts to introduce any evidence\n\nsubstantiating its claims that there was never any proper authority to conduct such\n\nsale in behalf of only Circle Ridge Production by Dean Searle. Instead, the\n\nevidence before the jury was that “Kevin Stephens had authorized Bill Briscoe to\n\nact for Kevin Stephens’ interest in the foreclosure sale in November 2013.”\n\n(RR:3:200:19-202:19). Clearly the absence of this evidence affected the jury’s\n\ndecisions, and the Courts entry of judgment that Great Northern had not “proved”\n\nits wrongful foreclosure allegations. This testimony was should be controlling on a\n\n\n                                     Page 57 of 93\n\fmaterial issue dispositive in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                           V.\n\n  COURT ERROR IN EITHER GRANTING INSTRUCTED VERDICTS\n  AGAINST GNE AND/OR REFUSING TO SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING\n            ISSUES TO THE JURY FOR DECISION.\n\n\n      1. Standard of review: insofar as Appellants present issues relating to the\n\ntrial courts granting Plaintiffs Motions for Directed Verdict or refusing to submit\n\nAppellants issues, to the jury and granting an instructed verdict in favor of\n\nPlaintiffs, the exclusion of the evidence as argued in Section IV, pages 43-58\n\nabove, becomes relevant and important. The evaluation standard for this Court in\n\ndetermining the propriety of the trial court’s action in granting Motions for\n\nDirected Verdict or removing matters from consideration from the jury to grant a\n\nDirected Verdict, is whether the party opposing the granting of the Directed\n\nVerdict or removal of issues from the jury has presented any evidence of probative\n\nworth, raising a material fact issue and establishing a claim or defense, while\n\nviewing such evidence in the light most favorable to, in the case Appellants. Ojeda\n\nv. Walmart Stores, 956 S.W. 2d 704, 706-707 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1997, pet.\n\ndenied). Further, insofar as the Appellant present issues regarding the trial Courts\n\nexclusion of oral and documentary evidence, which would establish Appellants\n\n\n                                      Page 58 of 93\n\fdefenses and claims against Plaintiff Circle Ridge Production and Third Party\n\nDefendant Kevin Stephens, Appellants submit that the standard is whether the\n\nevidence excluded was calculated to and probably did cause the rendition of an\n\nimproper judgment as the Supreme Court has announced is prohibited in McCraw\n\nv. Maris, 828, S.W. 2d, 756, 758(Tex.1992), supra, 758, and Anderson v. Gilbert,\n\nsupra, at 784-85\n\n      In evaluating whether Appellants submitted sufficient evidence of probative\n\nworth, raising a material fact issue and establishing a claim or defense, the\n\nevidence described in Section IV. 43-58 above, must be viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to Appellants; however, the Court excluded that evidence, but it was\n\nbefore the Court through the Bills of Exception recited previously and offered by\n\nAppellants.\n\n      The prejudicial and apparently intentional nature and extent of the Courts\n\nactions in excluding the evidence recited in Section IV 43-58 above, is apparent.\n\nSimply stated, the Court refused to allow evidence in support of Appellees claims\n\nand defenses as indicated below and then rendered its judgment because contrary\n\nevidence did not appear on the record. Since these issues were never presented to\n\nthe jury, it is essentially immaterial whether the unsupporting evidentiary matters\n\nwere formally admitted into evidence.\n\n      The following issues are those which the Court erred in connection with the\n\n\n                                     Page 59 of 93\n\fentry of a Directed Verdict or overruling Appellants claims, to wit:\n\n\n5-1. The Court erred in granting Circle Ridges’ motion that Great Northern\nbreached the $700K promissory note and owed the sum of $637,114.15 to Circle\nRidge Production as liability on such note.\n\n      Many of the statutes and case authorities relating to this issue have been set\n\nforth above in Section II of this Argument of Authorities portion. Those arguments\n\nare incorporated into this section by reference as though set forth verbatim herein.\n\n\n      The central issue is determining liability on the note, is whether any liability\n\non the note at this point can be properly enforced. Extensive testimony was\n\noffered to the effect that Bill Briscoe attempted to act alone. All demands (RR\n\n4:222:18-223:6) were made by Searle in behalf of only the Circle Ridge portion of\n\nthe note. Nate Moran testified in the Bill of Exceptions that all his negotiations\n\nwith Dean Searle were conducted with Searle acting only in behalf of Circle Ridge\n\nProduction (RR4:213:9-218:13). Joe Loftis, Michael Stephens testified, and even\n\nKevin Stephens acknowledged through testimony offered in Bills of Exception that\n\nin December, 2012, Kevin Stephens interest in the note was assigned to Great\n\nNorthern Energy. This lawsuit, including any actions to enforce liability on the\n\nnote by Circle Ridge Production was not filed until June 18, 2014 (CR:10-45).\n\nClearly, the assignment of Kevin Stephens’s interest in and to the 700K note to\n\nGreat Northern, occurred prior to June 18, 2014. As stated above, this evidence\n\n\n                                     Page 60 of 93\n\fmust be viewed in the light most favorable to Appellants. As specified in Leavings\n\nv. Mills, supra, (310). Texas is a state were “enforcement follows the note”. It is\n\nelementary that Kevin Stephens had the right to assign his interest in the note and\n\nliens to Great Northern. (§3.203(d), comment 5, Tex. Bus. And Comm. Code\n\nrecognizing the effectiveness of partial assignments in note ownership. The Court\n\ncompletely refused to recognize or honor Great Northern’s ownership interest in\n\nthe note, following Kevin Stephen’s assignment, or its failure to authorize Bill\n\nBriscoe, President of Circle Ridge, to proceed with enforcement of the note. Those\n\nadmissions are errors by the Court. As the Texas Supreme Court stated the\n\nconsiderations which were necessary in evaluating whether proper authority to\n\nproceed in an, “x and y” foreclosure of deed of trust, and note enforcement,\n\nexisted, it should include factual evaluation of whether only one joint tenant acting\n\nalone had received a proper assignment of rights from a successor interest owner.\n\nHere there is no evidence of a proper assignment. Anderson v Gilbert, supra, 784-\n\n785. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons and does not provide that it\n\nis payable to them in alternative, it can only be enforced by all payees, and all co-\n\npayees should be joined in the action. Page Airways, Inc., v. the Associated Radio\n\nService Co., 545 184, 189-190(Tex. Civ. App.-San Antonio, 1976, writ ref’d.\n\nn.r.e.) Further, the fact that the interest of Kevin Stephens was assigned, to GNE\n\nmaybe be established by proving the transaction through which it acquired the\n\n\n                                     Page 61 of 93\n\finterest of Stephens, Sections 3.201(c), comment C, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code. See\n\nalso Lawson v. Finance America Private Brands, 537 S.W.2d 483, 485(Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.-El Paso, 1976, no writ). Once the transactions established however, the\n\ntransferee acquires the same rights as the transferor had under the instrument (Tex.\n\nBus. & Com .Code Section 3.201(a)). Clearly, evidence exists that Great Northern\n\nowned Kevin Stephens’ interest. The Court’s refusal to acknowledge this evidence\n\nmuch less admit it, is construed, and constitutes a reversible error, because the\n\nCourt failed to consider the ocean of evidence supporting Appellants position. In\n\nfact, there is not one scintilla of evidence in the trial that indicates or evidences the\n\nfact that Briscoe acted with permission of the proper parties. Evidence of the fact\n\nthat he had no evidence or basis to establish that Kevin Stephens owned any\n\ninterest in the note or that he acted in his behalf. Clearly he did not act in behalf of\n\nGreat Northern Energy with respect to the subsequently acquire interest in the\n\nSeptember 11, 2012 note from Kevin Stephens. In short, the proper parties\n\nPlaintiff, have never prosecuted this note, and no liability can exist,\n\nnotwithstanding the Court’s attempts to enter its Directed Judgment at the\n\nconclusion of the trial, in the Final Judgment submitted.\n\n\n      Further, insofar as Appellees may argue that Appellants had stipulated to\n\nany amount owed under terms of the note, any and all of such stipulations are\n\nconditional, and apply only in the event that “Circle Ridge Production owns 100%\n\n                                       Page 62 of 93\n\fof the note and GNE does not own undivided ½ interest as assignee of Kevin\n\nStephens. There is abundance evidence in the record to suggest the assignment of\n\ninterest from Kevin Stephens to GNE, it has been excluded by the Court, and is\n\ncontrary to the presumption that it should have been presented to the jury. Clearly\n\nthe granting of these Directed Verdicts was an error by the Court.\n\n\nV-2. The Court erred in granting Kevin Stephens take nothing Judgment with\n\nrespect to Great Northern’s Breach of Contract claims against him.\n\n\n      The elements of a Breach of Contract claim are as follows:\n\n\n             1. there is a valid, enforceable contract;\n\n\n             2. Plaintiff is the proper party to sue for Breach of Contract;\n\n\n             3. Plaintiff tendered performance of its contractual obligations;\n\n\n             4. the Defendant breach the contract;\n\n\n             5. the Defendant breach caused Plaintiff injury.\n\n\n      The elements of a contract are specified in the following cases:\n\n\n             Foley v. Daniel, 346, S.W.3d, 687,690(Tex. App. –El Paso 2009,\n                no pet.)(elements 1, 3-5), Marquis Acquisitions, Inc, v Steadfast\nIns., 409 S.W. 3d, 808, 813-14(Tex.

Further, Kevin Stephens acknowledged that he had a\n\ncontractual agreement to furnish pipe and supplies to Great Northern\n\n(RR:4:305:12-309:2). This evidence establishes the existence of an agreement.\n\nFurther, the testimony of Joe Loftis that the equipment was removed, and\n\n(RR:4:29:6-31:22), and that of Michael Stephens that he felt entitled to remove the\n\nequipment (RR:4:39:13-46:4, establishes the basis for submission of a Breach of\n\nContract issued. Further, the testimony as to the amount of money paid establishes\n\nthe loss (RR:4:39:13-46:4). Thus, Great Northern has satisfied its requirements to\n\npresent testimony sufficient to meet his burden of proof for submission of the\n\nBreach of Contract issued to the jury; however, the Court refused to present this\n\nmatter to the jury, ruling that no evidence existed. Of course no evidence existed,\n\nthe Court prevented the evidence from being introduced. The presumption exist\n\nthat this testimony, viewed most favorably in Great Northern Energy’s perspective,\n\nshould have been presented. The Court erred in failing to do so and Great Northern\n\nis entitled to submit these issues to a proper trier of facts.\n                                       Page 64 of 93\n\fV.3 Great Northern submits the Court erred in granting the motions of Bill Briscoe\nand Kevin Stephens for Directed Verdict against Great Northern with respect to\nGreat Northerns claims for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair\nDealing.\n\n      In determining whether a cause of action can be characterized as a Breach of\n\nContract, a Tort or both, the Courts consider (1) the source of Defendants duty to\n\nact and (2) the nature of the remedy or damages sought by the Plaintiff. See:\n\nForemost Plastics Corp, USA v. Presidio Engineering Contractors, Inc., 960 S.W.\n\n2d, 41, 45(Tex. 1998); Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v.

In order to determine whether any individual action, constitutes a breach of\n\ncontract or a breach of legal duty imposed by law, the Court must determine\n\nwhether the remedy lies in an action for breach of contract, or where general\n\ndamages are incurred and create an “independent injury”. DeWitt County Elec. Co-\n\nop v. Parks, 1 S.W.3d, 96105(Tex. 1999), Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Kinder Morgan\n\nOperating, LP, 192 S.W. 3d, 120,126-127(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no\n\npet.).

Further, although there is no\n\ngeneral duty of good faith and fair dealing in all contractual relationships, the duty\n\nmay arise when the contract creates or governs a special relationship between the\n\nparties. See T.F.W. Management v. Westwood Shores Property Owners Assoc., 79\n\nS.W. 3d 712, 719(Tex.App.-Houston[14th Dist.] 2002 pet. denied). To impose a\n\nTort duty on the parties to a contract, the Court must find a special relationship\n\nbetween them. Farah v. Mafrige & Cornmanik, PC, 927 S.W.2d, 663,\n\n675(Tex.App.-Houston[1st Dist.] 1996 no writ.

Thus, and independent duty in Tort\n\narises, and violates the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.\n\n                             VI. Refusal to Grant Mistrial\n\n      The Court erred in failing to grant Great Northern Energy,\nIncorporated, Ronald J. Abercrombie, and Joseph B. Loftis’ Motion for\nMistrial prior to the submission of this cause to the Jury.\n\n      Before this cause was submitted to the jury, counsel for appellants moved\n\nthe Court to grant and order a mistrial in this cause. (RR 5:11:14-21) It was the\n\nsecond time such a motion had been presented. At the outset of the trial, during\n\nthe voir dire presentation of Kevin Stephens’ counsel, a similar Motion had also\n\n\n                                      Page 67 of 93\n\fbeen presented. (RR2:128:2-9), see, “Improper Voir Dire” Section III, pages 41-\n\n43 above, and now incorporated herein by reference). This subsequent Motion for\n\nMistrial was presented after the Court’s evidentiary rulings had excluded over 75%\n\nof the evidence Appellants offered for their defenses and counter-claims, and over\n\n80% of the documents they attempted to offer in support of their claims and\n\ndefenses. From appellants’ view, simply stated, they had been denied the\n\nopportunity to fairly present their evidence of their well plead claims and defenses\n\nbecause of wholly erroneous evidentiary rulings by the Court excluding that\n\nevidence, and because of the prejudicial and improper conduct of voir dire, and\n\nbecause, cumulatively, the error was so enormous it was impossible for any jury to\n\nfairly evaluate the truth and credibility of their claims and defenses. The legal\n\nauthority supporting Appellants Motion for Mistrial are set forth in Section III,\n\npages 41-43 above, and in the authorities and arguments presented in Section III__,\n\npages 41-43 below, applicable to cumulative error, are applicable to the evaluation\n\nof whether the trial court erred in failing to grant Appellants Motion for Mistrial\n\npresented prior to jury submission.. All of such arguments and authorities are\n\nincorporated into this Section 4, and re-urged here:\n\n             VII.- Errors Related to Jury Submission & Argument\n\n             A. Errors with respect to Jury Questions and Answers:\n\n            VII-1. the Court erred in improperly submitting the jury issues to the\n         jury as submitted because it improperly shifted the burden of proof to\n                                     Page 68 of 93\n\f   Great Northern.\n       VII-2. the Court erred in awarding judgment based upon the findings\n   of the jury that the Courts answers to questions 1 and 2 were immaterial\n   because the evidence proves conclusively as a matter of law, that the\n   foreclosure sale on November 5, 2013 was improperly conducted.\n\n\n   B. the Court erred in allowing counsel for Circle Ridge to make the\n   following improper jury arguments;\n\n       VII-3. With respect to question number 1, insofar as counsel for\n   Circle Ridge asserts the burden of proof was on Defendant to disprove\n   the that the foreclosure sale of November 5, 2013, was properly\n   conducted, the burden was not upon Great Northern Energy, but rather\n   upon Circle Ridge.\n       VII-4. the Court erred in allowing counsel for Circle Ridge\n   Production to make an improper and prejudicial argument, insofar as it\n   allowed such counsel to read a stipulation to the jury that Great Northern\n   owed Circle Ridge $637,114.15 under terms of the note when such\n   representation was in fact a misrepresentation known to all parties and\n   submitted over Great Northerns objections.\n\n   Because the trial court’s errors relating to the submission of issues and\n\n   instructions to the jury, relating to arguments improperly allowed to be\n\n   presented to the jury by Circle Ridge’s and Third Party Defendant’s\n\n   counsel, and relating to the trial court’s entry of judgment for Appellees\n\n   based on the jury’s answers to the questions submitted, are related and\n\n exemplify the “intertwined” totality of the trial court’s “errors” in this\n\n cause, Appellant’s argument and authorities with respect to points of error\n\n#VII-1-VIII-A above, are combined in this response. The standard for\n\nreview of the trial court’s rulings complained of is abuse of discretion; In re\n\n\n                              Page 69 of 93\n\fEstate of Boren, 268 S.W.3d 841, 846 (Tex.App.---Texarkana, 2008, pet. denied)\n\n(citing Cire v.

Jean-\n\nPaul Budinger, Inc., 724 S.W.2d 931, 939 (Tex.App.—Austin 1987, no writ)\n\nhowever, if a court’s ruling is contrary to clearly established law, it is an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. In re Estate of Boren, 268 S.W.3d 841, 846 (Tex.App.---Texarkana,\n\n2008, pet. denied) (citing Cire v. Cummings, 134 S.W.3d 835, 838-39 (Tex. 2004),\n\nLandon v. Jean-Paul Budinger, Inc., 724 S.W.2d 931, 939 (Tex.App.—Austin\n\n1987, no writ)\n\nFurther, even if there exists a contention that some factual evidence exists to\n\nsupport the trial court’s ruling under attack, if such evidence is otherwise legally\n\ninsufficient, a “no evidence” resolution is required. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d\n\n833, 839 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding)..\n\n\n             In evaluating the trial court’s approach and submission of its charge\n\n          and questions to the jury, the only issues submitted to the jury were two\n\n          questions, (CR1254 and 1255), which inquired whether 1) that Great\n\n          Northern had “established” there was a defect in the foreclosure sale of\n\n          November 5, 2013, proceedings, as conducted by Dean Searle, Trustee.\n\n          (CR 1254); and the second was whether Great Northern had established\n\n          that there was a grossly inadequate sales price…in the foreclosure\n\n          sale…on November 5, 2013,(CR 1255). No issues were submitted\n\n                                      Page 70 of 93\n\fplacing the burden of proof upon Circle Ridge Production, Inc. to\n\nestablish the validity of the disputed foreclosure sale of November 5,\n\n2013, through which it claimed to have derived its title.\n\nThis submission process completely miscasts the burden of proof. In a\n\ntrespass to try title case, the burden is always on the Plaintiff to establish\n\ngood title, is the Plaintiff’s responsibility, and a plaintiff cannot prevail\n\nbased on the failure of opposing parties to establish good title in the\n\nopposing party. In this case, however, although the Trial Court did not\n\ngrant Circle Ridges Production’s request for Directed Verdict,\n\n(RR5:14:23-18:04,5:19:19-25), implying that there were fact issues for\n\njury evaluation, it shifted the Proof of Burden to Great Northern. Dillon\n\nv. Hodges, 804 F.2d 1384 (5thCir. 1984), Texas Co. v. Lee, 157 S.W.2d\n\n628, 183 Tex. 167 (Tex. 1942), Chapman v. Moser, 532 F.2d 1358 (5th\n\nCir. 1976) (***-better pg. ref.), Ragsdale v. Griffin, 380 S.W.2d 164\n\n(Tex. Civ. App ****-1964). Here, however, over the objections of\n\nAppellants’ counsel, (CR 1240-1246, RR 5:137:3-24), the Court,\n\nsubmitted the issues, miscasting the burden of proof upon Great Northern\n\nEnergy to prove that Circle Ridge had not conducted a proper\n\nforeclosure. The burden of proof in a trespass to try title action does not\n\nshift to the defendant, it remains with the Plaintiff, in this case Circle\n\n\n                            Page 71 of 93\n\fRidge to establish the valid conduct of the foreclosure sale. Hart v.\n\nEason, 321 S.W.2d 574, 159 Tex.375 (Tex. 1959), get more specific\n\ninfo) Appellants submitted a proper issue, (CR 1243), but the Court\n\nrefused to submit it, relying, instead on Circle Ridge’s insistence that the\n\nburden rested on Defendants. That is an improper shifting of the burden\n\nof proof, and an improper jury submission, contrary to established law;\n\nand thus, an abuse of discretion.\n\n   Additionally, the Court permitted the counsel for Circle Ridge to\n\nargue before the jury that Great Northern had stipulated that it owed\n\n$637,114.15 (RR 5:22:4-30:4 ). In fact, Appellants attorney only\n\nstipulated that such sum would be a proper calculation in the event Great\n\nNorthern had not purchased Kevin Stephen’s one half interest in the note\n\n(RR 5:25:4-26:22, and in the event the note was properly enforced in the\n\nname of “Circle Ridge Production, Inc. and Great Northern Energy,\n\nIncorporated, successor in interest to Kevin Stephens”. (RR 5:22:3-\n\n30:4). Of course, the court would not permit that stipulation, as stated, to\n\nbe used in jury argument, because it had excluded all evidence of such\n\nassignment of interest (see, Section II & IV above). Appellant’s attorney\n\nstipulated that Defendant’s counsel might argue same, subject however,\n\nto Appellants objection, which the Court overruled. (RR 5:22:13-30:14).\n\n\n                           Page 72 of 93\n\fThus, Circle Ridge’s counsel improperly argued to the jury that Great\n\nNorthern had stipulated it owed the sum of $637,114.15. That erroneous\n\nstatement of evidence was prejudicial and likely caused error in the jury’s\n\ndeliberations. (Add cite-prejudicial argument). Further, counsel for\n\nboth Circle Ridge and Kevin Stephens argued that the burden of proof\n\nwas on Great Northern to establish that Dean Searle had not properly\n\nconducted the November 5, 2012, foreclosure sale. (CT 125_; RR\n\n5:14:23-18:3, 5:28:10-29:16). Among other arguments, both counsel\n\nrecited that Kevin Stephens had given Circle Ridge the authorization to\n\nforeclose, insofar as the Kevin Stephens ownership interest in the note\n\nmade payable to “Circle Ridge Production, Inc., and Kevin Stephens”\n\nwas concerned (RR5:14:23-18:3).\n\nAt no time, were Appellants allowed to argue before the jury that Kevin\n\nStephens had sold, assigned, and transferred his interest in the note\n\nprevious to the foreclosure sale to Great Northern, that Bill Briscoe had\n\nprior notice of that assignment, or that Dean Searle acted without the\n\nauthority of anyone but Circle Ridge Production, Inc., in conducting the\n\nforeclosure sale on November 5, 2012, because he did not have authority\n\nfrom any other legal interest owner in the note on November 5, 2012.\n\n(see Section II, above).\n\n\n                           Page 73 of 93\n\f   Finally, counsel for Kevin Stephens argued that the value of the\n\nleasehold interest was much less than experts (whose testimony was also\n\nexcluded) regarding the value of the interest foreclosed on versus the\n\npurchase consideration established at the foreclosure sale of $150,000.00\n\n(RR 5:098:15-105:13, 108:23-1218). Here, the adverse effect of Josh\n\nManess’s improper injection of evidence into voir dire, through his\n\nquestioning of venireman Williams becomes important because Mr.\n\nWilliams was selected as a juror, and Maness had represented that he\n\ncould use his prior experience as “common sense.” (RR 2:124:13-126:24\n\nand 2:128:10-129:24). Thus Maness injected an improper basis for the\n\njury to use in evaluating the testimony in this case in deliberations. The\n\nharm is manifest.\n\n                        VIII.- Cumulative Error\n\nThe Court erred in all respects in this trial and its denial that a new\ntrial should be granted herein and all matters re-tried. This case\nshould be reversed and remanded for an entire new trial, because the\ncumulative error of the Court was so great that that is the sole\nremedy can effectively address the errors in the prior trial.\n\nFew cases present a sufficient number and quality of errors to justify the\n\nreversal of the trial court’s judgment because of cumulative errors.\n\nHowever, Texas courts recognize that when all the errors are considered\n\ntogether, in light of the whole record, an appellate court may find that the\n\n\n                           Page 74 of 93\n\faccumulation of those errors was reasonably calculated to and probably\n\ndid cause the rendition of an improper judgment, requiring a reversal of\n\nthe trial court’s judgment.

Reidel,\n\n425 S.W.2d 665 (tex.Civ.App.—Eastland 1969, no writ);\n\n   Appellants submit that the number and quality of errors committed by\n\nthe trial court in this case more than satisfy the standard required for\n\nreversal for cumulative error. As recited above, by itemization, there are\n\na minimum of 54 erroneous rulings all against appellants in allowing\n\nimproper voir dire, in excluding virtually all of Appellants’ otherwise\n\nadmissible evidence in support of Appellants defenses and counterclaims,\n\nin erroneously granting Appellees requests for directed verdicts on 3 of\n\nAppellants claims, after excluding the supporting evidence offered by\n\nAppellants, in overruling Appellants motion for mistrial at the conclusion\n\nof evidence presentation, in erroneously submitting questions and a\n\ncharge to the jury which wrongly shifted the burden of proof on Circle\n\nRidge’s issue of proper foreclosure sale authorization, in failing to\n\nrequire proper documentation and proof for awarding attorneys fees to\n\nAppellees, in overruling Appellants Motion for New Trial 54 points of\n\n\n                            Page 75 of 93\n\f         error), and in failing to grant Appellants Motion for Judgment NOV (3\n\n         issues). In the introduction to these arguments and authorities, Appellants\n\n         likened their experience to the Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing experience\n\n         described in the Aesop’s Fable story often recited by Abraham Lincoln.\n\n         Appellants submit that the foregoing argument and authorities more than\n\n         substantiates that analogy to this trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                        IX.\n\n      The Court erred in awarding Circle Ridge’s attorney’s fees against\n\nGreat Northern in the amount of $150,873.37\n\n      Following the conclusion of the jury portion of the trial, Appellee’s\n\nattorneys submitted their claims for attorneys fees to the Court. In its “Judgment”\n\nentered on December 7, 2015, the Court awarded $150,873.37 to Plaintiff’s\n\nattorneys. However, as Appellants’ attorney asserted in his reply and opposition\n\n(CT 1330-1337), the Court was incorrect in awarding any attorneys fees, or,\n\nalternatively, awarding the sum of $150,873.37 for the following reasons:\n\n      IX-1. Appellant completely failed to sustain its burden of proof on any basis\n\nauthorizing the award of attorneys fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                      Page 76 of 93\n\fAll of the arguments by Circle Ridge in support of its Motion for Attorneys’\n\nFees are founded and based upon the legal position that it is authorized and\n\nempowered to attempt collection and enforcement efforts because of its\n\nattempts to collect, foreclose, etc. in behalf of the interest of Circle Ridge\n\nproduction under the note of September 11, 2012, in the principal amount of\n\n$700,000.00.(the “$700K note”); however, as was extensively argued during\n\nthe trial, any such collection attempts were, and are, wholly unauthorized\n\nand illegal. Under §§3.201, 3.203, et seq., Tex. Bus. & Com. Code (2013),\n\nany attempt to enforce or collect the note without the joinder of both parties,\n\ni.e.¸ both Circle Ridge and Great Northern (the then legal owner and holder\n\nof the rights formerly owned by Kevin Stephens) were wholly improper.\n\nSee, Comment 5 to §3.203, and Commentary, “No Partial Negotiation or\n\nTransfer” and “Distinction between right to enforce instrument and\n\nownership of instrument,” Anderson, Bartlett & East’s Texas Uniform\n\nCommercial Code Annotated (2007 Edition-West Publishing). At the time\n\nthe demands attached to Plaintiffs’ MfAF were prepared and served, the\n\nrecord owners and holders of the note were Circle Ridge Production, Inc.\n\nand Great Northern Energy, Inc., and Dean Searle, acting as agent for Circle\n\nRidge Production, was not authorized to so act for the holders thereof. Thus\n\nhis actions were completely improper, not properly submitted, nor properly\n\n\n                               Page 77 of 93\n\fconducted, and thus cannot form the basis for the award of any attorneys’\n\nfees herein, nor can any award be made to any attorney representing only\n\nCircle Ridge herein because such action seeks to enforce only the interest of\n\nCircle Ridge in the note.\n\n      IX-2. Similarly, any efforts to collect attorneys fees for violations of\n\nany of the provisions of, or pursuant to the terms of the Deed of Trust dated\n\nSeptember 11, 2012, are improper, and must fail because Appellee has\n\nnever properly conducted or attempted any proper enforcement of the Deed\n\nof Trust, because it has always acted alone and never jointly with the\n\nremaining interest owner “Great Northern Energy, Incorporated, as\n\nsuccessor to Kevin Stephens, in the Deed of Trust in which the originally\n\ndesignated Beneficiaries or “Beneficiary” were “Circle Ridge Production,\n\nInc. and Kevin Stephens”. Again, the arguments set forth in Section II,\n\npages 37-40 are incorporated into this point of error as though set forth\n\nverbatim.\n\nIX-3: Texas Civil Remedies and Procedures, Code 18.001, requires that\n\napplications for attorney’s fees must be submitted, at a minimum and based\n\nupon a proper evidentiary affidavit, El Apple1, Ltd. V. Olivas, 370 S.W. 3d\n\n757 (Texas 2012). He should properly identify and segregate claims which\n\nallowed recovery for such fees. Stewart Title Guaranty Company v Sterling,\n\n\n                              Page 78 of 93\n\f822 S.W. 2d 1(Texas 1992), notwithstanding the ruling of Tony Gullo\n\nMotors v Chapa, 212 S.W. 3d 299 (Texas 2006), the Texas Supreme Court\n\nhas still directed that applications for legal fees must focus on analysis of the\n\nfactors (facts) underlying multiple claims. Block billing may not support the\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees. As the Plaintiff argues, this case involved not\n\nonly trespass to try title, breach of contract, wrongful foreclosure, forgery,\n\nlack of sufficient acknowledgement in suit to quiet title.\n\n1. The Affidavit of Ronan Searle in behalf of Searle and Searle is legally\n\n   insufficient to support the award of attorneys’ fees. Specifically, the\n\n   affidavit of Ronan Searle incorporates the “contemporaneous billing\n\n   records of the firm Searle and Searle. There is no independent Affidavit\n\n   of Dean Searle, who apparently performed many of the services for\n\n   which billing is attributable by virtue of the initials “DS” on many of the\n\n   billing records in Appendix “A”, stating that such services were\n\n   reasonable and necessary. Further, Ronan Searle, also a member of the\n\n   firm performed services; however, no segregation of services performed\n\n   by either Ronan or Dean Searle is specified, either in the Affidavit of\n\n   Ronan Searle, or in any portion of Appendix A.(CR1330-1337).\n\n   Among insufficiencies frowned upon in establishing the basis for\n\n   attorneys’ fees recovery are unnecessary duplication of billing for\n\n\n                               Page 79 of 93\n\f  services by partners or associates. Here, Plaintiff specifies in its MFAF\n\n  that “(a) as shown on Appendix, two separate law firms had to be hired\n\n  by Plaintiff in order to take this case through trial.” (CR1330-1337). The\n\n  billing submitted in both Appendices “A” and “B” (CR1268, 1278-1301),\n\n  is so insufficient that it is impossible to determine what duplication\n\n  occurred. Courts do not and should not award attorneys” fees for hours\n\n  spent in duplicative activity or spent in a passive role of an observer\n\n  while other attorneys perform, and are generally not recoverable.\n\n  Chaves, Douglas E., “Attorney’s Fees Update, 36th State Bar of Tex.\n\n  Prof. Dev. Program, 36th Annual Advanced Civil Trial Course Chap. 26,\n\n  p 9 (2013 ). Neither can any such segregation be made based on the\n\n  Affidavit of Michael Runyan submitted. Neither is there any evidence\n\n  that any “billing judgment” has been exercised in this case, which\n\n  omission is also a serious flaw in applications for payment of attorneys’\n\n  fees.\n\n\n\n2. The time records submitted in Appendices A & B (CR1278-1301) are\n\n  further insufficient insofar as they fail to specify which issues or claims\n\n  apply to any distinct issues. Issues relating to Plaintiffs “forgery” claims\n\n  were never submitted, and further, Plaintiff nonsuited its claims relating\n\n\n                              Page 80 of 93\n\fto recovery for alleged violations by the individual Defendants Loftis and\n\nAbercrombie for Plaintiff’s originally plead claims of “negligence,”\n\n“civil conspiracy” and violation of the “Texas Civil Theft Liability Act”-\n\nthus legally abandoning such claims against all Defendants.\n\nNevertheless, Plaintiff’s claims for recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs\n\nclearly include claims for service time and costs attributable to “forgery”\n\nissues-specifically, as marked on Exhibit “4” to this Response (see page\n\n4, “telephone conference with handwriting expert”, (CR1281),p.5,\n\n“preparing documentation to expert”(CR1282), p,.7, $900 paid to\n\nhandwriting expert,(CR1299). Clearly there is no recovery for such\n\nclaims, and in fact, no proper basis for any recovery exists because of the\n\nviolations of the requirements of §§3.201 and 3.203, Tex.Bus.& Com.\n\nCode (2013), as specified above in Response #1. Again, any claims of\n\nadmission of liability with respect to any performance, either payment of\n\nsums due or any other obligation contained in the Deed of Trust, are\n\nexpressly denied by all Defendants, as any admission of any liability\n\nwhatsoever, is specifically conditioned on the language contained in the\n\nstipulation “in the event Defendant Great Northern Energy in did not own\n\nthe interests of Kevin Stephens in the $700K note.” Any such stipulation\n\n\n\n\n                           Page 81 of 93\n\f        is conditional only. In this connection, see, Steward Title Guaranty Co.\n\n        V. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1 (Texas 1992), Chaves, supra, at p.7.\n\n                                             X.\n\n        The Court erred in failing to grant Great Northern Energy’s Motion\n        for Judgment NOV with regard to its contentions that is has no\n        liability with regard to the Circle Ridge Production note, as asserted\n        by Circle Ridge Production in the trial, because there is neither now\n        or has there ever been any proper presentation of Circle Ridge’s\n        demands insofar as there is no proper assertion of Great Northerns\n        liability under the $700K note because Circle Ridge does not have\n        the authority, acting alone, to enforce, or even attempt enforcement\n        of liability on such note, nor has it ever attempted to enforce the note\n        in accordance with the law, or in awarding any claim that Great\n        Northern Energy pay any attorneys fees for the collection activities\n        related to Circle Ridge Production’s collection efforts in such\n        connection.\n\n      Appellants re-urge the argument and authorities set forth in pages 37-41\n\nSection II above relating to the improper efforts to foreclose the Deed of Trust\n\nlien, or to enforce collection of the September 11, 2012, $700K note, without\n\nproper participation by both parties, and in the name of both parties jointly. In\n\nthis case, the Court should disregard all the jury findings and sign a judgment in\n\nfavor of Great Northern Energy, Inc. because no evidence was introduced by\n\nCircle Ridge to establish that the proper party authorized, noticed, or conducted\n\nthe foreclosure sale in controversy on November 5, 2013. In fact, the only\n\nevidence that both “X and Y” participated in or noticed or conducted the\n\nforeclosure was the testimony of Bill Briscoe, President of Circle Ridge\n\n\n                                   Page 82 of 93\n\fProduction, that he got Kevin Stephen’s permission to foreclose before he\n\ninitiated the foreclosure proceedings in Circle Ridge’s name. However, that\n\ntestimony, even as taken to be wholly true and accurate in inadequate to meet the\n\nburden of proof demanded of Circle Ridge. Specifically that testimony is\n\ncontradicted by Stephen’s admission against interest (offered in the Bill of\n\nExceptions) that he had sold his interest in the $700K note to Great Northern\n\nEnergy before January 1, 2013, and this foreclosure did not occur until\n\nNovember 5, 2013. Further, the relevant foreclosure or note collection procedures\n\nwere not commenced by Circle Ridge until after February 1, 2013. Thus, Kevin\n\nStephens did not have any authority to “authorize” any foreclosure proceedings\n\nor to transfer any interest in and to the $700K note or Deed of Trust lien after\n\nDecember, 2012. Clearly, no proper entity ever authorized Circle Ridge to\n\nproceed with any foreclosure or collection procedures of any kind or character.\n\nBecause there is no evidence that any foreclosure was properly conducted, Great\n\nNorthern is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\n\n\n                                      XI.\n\n\n        Great Northern is entitled to judgment that Circle Ridge take\n        nothing, with respect to its claims for Trespass to Try Title, because\n        there is no sufficient legal evidence which supports such\n        determination.\n\n    An action in trespass to try title is a suit to recover the possession of land\n\n                                    Page 83 of 93\n\funlawfully withheld from an owner who has a right to immediate possession\n\nStandard Oil Co. of Tex.

Standolind Oil & Gas Co. v State, 136 Tex. 5, 133\n\nS.W. 2d 767, 770 (1939). The action is purely statutory Tx. Prop. Code, 22.001-\n\n22.022 and is governed by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure [T.R.C.P. 783-809].\n\n       To bring an action in trespass to try title, Circle Ridge Production is\n\nrequired to file a formal petition in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure [T.R.C.P. 783-809]. The petition must state: the real names of the\n\nparties and their residences, if known; (2) a legally sufficient description of the\n\npremises; (3) the interest which the plaintiff claims in the premises; (4) that the\n\nplaintiff was in possession of the premises or entitled to such possession; (5) that\n\nthe defendant unlawfully entered upon and dispossessed the plaintiff of the\n\npremises and withholds possession; (6) facts showing rents, profits, or damages if\n\nclaimed; and (7) a prayer for the relief sought T.R.C.P. 783; see Marshall v\n\nGarcia, 514 S.W.2d 513, 518-519 (Civ. App.—Corpus Christi 1974, ref. n.r.e.)\n\n      The petition must state the nature and extent of the interest which the\n\nplaintiff claims in the premises, such as fee simple or other estate. If an undivided\n\ninterest is claimed, the petition must state the nature and amount of that interest\n\nT.R.C.P. 783. The purpose of this rule is to put the defendant on notice of how\n\n\n                                      Page 84 of 93\n\fmuch of the land or of the title to the land was in issue Hicks v Southwestern\n\nSettlement & Devlop. Corp., 188 S.W. 2d 915, 929 (Tex. App. –Beaumont 1945,\n\nref, w.o.m.)\n\n       Since the plaintiff must recover out of the strength of his or her own title and\n\nnot on the weakness of the title of the adversary party, the burden of proof remains\n\non the plaintiff throughout the action Fritsche v Niechoy, 197 S.W. 1017, 1018-\n\n1019 (Civ. App.—Galveston 1917, dis.); see Dames v Strong, 659 S.W.2d 127, 129\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston[14th Dist.] 1983, no writ) – burden on plaintiff to prove\n\nprima facie right of title and possession]. When the plaintiff’s title is controverted,\n\nthe burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish a superior title by an affirmative\n\nshowing, regardless of whether the claim of title rests in law or in equity see Doria\n\nv Suchowolski, 531, S.W. 2d 360, 362 (Civ. App.—San Antonio 1975 ref. n.r.e.).\n\nThe plaintiff’s case must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence see D.T.\n\nCarroll Corp. v Carroll, 256 S.W. 2d 429, 432 (Civ. App.—San Antonio 1953 ref.\n\nn.r.e.), and if the plaintiff fails to satisfy the burden of proof of superior title, the\n\ndefendant is entitled to judgment without proving any right of title or possession\n\nsee Heil v Wirth, 161 Tex. 609, 343 S.W. 2d 226, 226-230 (1961).\n\n       Circle Ridge Production wholly failed to satisfy its burden of proof in this\n\nconnection. First, in its petition, it has cited additional parties owning interests (an\n\nadmission against interest. (CR1066-1126). Further, it introduced into evidence\n\n\n                                        Page 85 of 93\n\fitself, Circle Ridge claimed and attempts to claim through the judgment entered\n\nherein ownership of 100% of the working interest in and to the OBENCO Leases\n\n(CT:1068,1069,1497-1508). However, Circle Ridge itself introduced evidence of\n\noutstanding ownership in third parties, to-wit: Wayne Johnson, WJ South Waskom\n\n(RR:4:104:4-105:7), (Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 13). Further, it is clear that this\n\nassignment, effective from its date of assignment by Great Northern, pre-dates the\n\ndate of the granting of the Deed of Trust and it is not foreclosed by any apparent\n\nforeclosure of the Deed of Trust and is contrary to Circle Ridges claims of 100%\n\nownership. And therefore is not foreclosed under the Deed of Trust. (RR:3:210:3-\n\n213:25). Thus, the lien interest of the United States, as evidenced by pleading of\n\nthe United States, (CR:1649) and the identification of these lien hold interests by\n\nCircle Ridge in its Fifth Amended Petition prevent Circle Ridge from owning title.\n\nFurther, there was no evidence introduced by Circle Ridge in trial to evidence the\n\nfact that it had properly excluded any Internal Revenue Service tax liens upon the\n\nproperty as required by 26 U.S.C.§7425(b)(1)(c)(1)(Internal Revenue Code).\n\nSimply stated, the record is filled with claims of title besides that of Circle Ridge,\n\npursuant to Circle Ridge’s own proof. As stated, the Plaintiff in an action in\n\ntrespass to try title must recover, if at all, on strength of his or her own title and\n\nmay not rely on the weakness of the defendant’s title see Reinhardt v North, 507\n\nS.W. 2d 589,591, (Civ. App. –Waco 1974, ref. n.r.e). Gray v Joyce, 485 S.W. 2d\n\n\n                                       Page 86 of 93\n\f311, 313 (Civ. App. –Tyler 1972, ref. n.r.e.).\n\n   In its Trespass to Try Title action, Circle Ridge Production sought confirmation\n\n of its ownership, and rights to possession of an undivided 100% leasehold or\n\n working interest in and to the OBENCO leases. Insofar as Circle Ridge claims\n\n entitlement to a judgment of ownership of one hundred percent of the working\n\n interest in and to the OBENCO leases, (described in Exhibit “A: attached thereto)\n\n it failed to establish its claims “against all of the world” in the lawsuit. In fact, it\n\n plead there were outstanding liens in favor of Topcat Well Service and the\n\n Internal Revenue Service,(CR 1068, 1069-1072). Further, it itemized outstanding\n\n working interest ownership of forty-two percent (42%) in WJ South\n\n Waskom,(CR 1070-71, and RR:4:104:4-105:7, CRP Ex. 13), and introduced\n\n evidence of that outstanding interest; however, it never introduced any evidence\n\n of resolution of that claim lien as required by 26 USC, Section 7425(b)(1) and\n\n (c)(1). In the event Circle Ridge attempts to claim that it can rely on the so-called\n\n Abstract of Title which it filed only one week before trial, that document is not\n\n timely filed. Additionally, Defendants did not demand that Plaintiff Circle Ridge\n\n file any abstract pursuant to Rule 791, et seq., Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n Clearly, as a matter of law, Plaintiff has failed to meet the required burden of\n\n proof to establish its title against all other claims. Therefore, Circle Ridge\n\n Production failed to establish its claims to the extent that it is entitled to a\n\n\n                                       Page 87 of 93\n\fjudgement granting it an undivided one hundred percent title to the working\n\ninterest in and to the OBENCO leases, even assuming arguendo¸ that it\n\nestablished that its foreclosure sale on November 5, 2013 was legal. Of course,\n\nas set forth in paragraphs 2-19, that sale was not legal. Further, neither the\n\nAbstract, nor any instrument designated within it were introduced into evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                  Page 88 of 93\n\f                                      PRAYER\n\n      Appellants pray that the court reverse the trial court and render judgment in\n\nfavor of Appellants that Appellant Great Northern Energy take nothing by virtue\n\nof its claims with respect to any liability on the part of Appellees with respect to\n\nany sums allegedly owed under the September 11, 2012 note, that its claims of\n\ntitle under its Trespass to Try Title action be set aside and denied in all things, and\n\nthat it reverse the trial court’s rulings insofar as it denied Great Northern Energy\n\nthe opportunity for a new trial with regard to Great Northern Energy’s claims of\n\nwrongful foreclosure, interference with contractual relations and breach of the\n\nCovenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing and Breach of Contractual obligations\n\nwith respect to the equipment sales from Kevin Stephens to Great Northern\n\nEnergy, and that it reverse the Courts award of attorney’s fees in favor of Circle\n\nRidge Production as against Great Northern Energy.\n\n      Alternatively, Great Northern Energy request that all matters tried before the\n\ntrial court be reversed and set aside, and that a new trial be ordered on all matters\n\npled in Circle Ridge Productions 5th Amended Original Petition and Great\n\nNorthern Energy’s 3rd Amended Original Answer and Counter-Claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n                                        /s/William J.

Great Northern Energy, Inc.: Appellant, Defendant and Counter-\n             Plaintiff in the trial court (hereinafter sometimes either “Appellant” or\n             “Great Northern”) or: (“GNE”).\n\n      2.     Circle Ridge Production, Inc.: Appellee herein, Plaintiff and Counter\n             Defendant in the trial court action (hereinafter sometimes either\n             “Appellee” or “Circle Ridge” or “C.R.P.”).\n\n      3.     Kevin Stephens: Appellee herein, and Third Party Defendant in the\n             court below (hereinafter “Appellee Stephens” or “Stephens”: or\n             “K.S.”).\n\nCollectively, hereinafter Circle Ridge and Stephens are referred to as “Appellee’s”.\n“Other parties to the court below, who are not parties to this appeal are as follows:\n      1.     Joseph B. Loftis, Defendant below (hereinafter sometimes either\n             “Loftis” or “Joe Loftis”).\n\n      2.    Ronald J. Abercrombie, Defendant in the trial court (hereinafter\nsometimes either “Abercrombie” or “R.J.A.”).\n\n\n      Further, for reference, the reporter’s record of the proceedings is hereinafter\n\nreferred to as “R.R.” and the clerk’s record or transcript is “C.R.”.\n\n             This central beginning point of this case is a sale occurring on\n\nSeptember 11, 2012 in which Great Northern Energy, Inc., (“Appellant”)\n\npurchased oil gas and mineral and lease hold interest from two parties, Circle\n\nRidge Production, Inc., and Kevin Stephens, (“Appellees”). The consideration\n\ngiven was $200,000 cash and a $700,000 installment note (“$700K note”), and\n                                     Page 11 of 93\n\fDeed of Trust in which Circle Ridge Production, Inc. and Kevin Stephens were\n\nnamed the beneficiaries. The interests which were the subject of the sale are called\n\nthe “OBENCO” leases, which cover approximately 1100 to 1200 acres in the\n\nWaskom, Texas area in Harrison County, Texas. Shortly after Great Northern\n\nEnergy acquired these properties, it purposed to include them in a package to be\n\nresold to a company called Rangeford Resources. Shortly after September 11,\n\n2012, one of the payees, Kevin Stephens, determined to participate with his interest\n\nin the transaction in the Rangeford Resources transfer. To that end, he transferred\n\nand assigned his interest in the note and Deed of Trust to Great Northern Energy.\n\naround December 1, 2012 and before the first installment on the purchase note was\n\ndue and payable. Subsequently, Circle Ridge Production, the remaining party of\n\n“Circle Ridge Production and Kevin Stephens” attempted to collect on only the\n\n“Circle Ridge” portion of the note, and determined to foreclose. It conducted a\n\nforeclosure sale on November 5, 2013. On December 26, 2013, simultaneously\n\nwith recording the Trustees Deed from the November 5, 2013 sale, it claimed it\n\n“acquired” the remaining interest in the $700K note through a purported\n\nassignment from “Kevin Stephens”.\n\n      Following this muddled state of affairs, Great Northern filed suit in Dallas\n\nCounty, Texas, in Cause No.14-04993, against Circle Ridge Production, Kevin\n\nStephens and Bill Briscoe, Circle Ridge Production’s President, and principal\n\n                                     Page 12 of 93\n\fshareholder. It alleged, causes of action for slander of title, breach of contract,\n\nunjust enrichment, and breach of implied covenant of good faith in fair dealing,\n\nnegligent misrepresentation, fraud, and torturous interference with contact with\n\nclaims for attorney’s fees. Circle Ridge Production and Bill Briscoe responded by\n\nfiling a Motion to Transfer Venue to Harrison County, and separately, filed suit in\n\nCause No. 2014-0460, alleging, that Great Northern had filed a notice of its\n\nassignment from Kevin Stephens of his rights with respect to his interest in the\n\n$700K note, and his liens and property rights with respect to the OBENCO leases.\n\n(which it alleged to be a forgery). Circle Ridge claimed that that “forged”\n\nassignment from Stephens to Great Northern clouded Circle Ridge’s title. The\n\nvenue in these actions was subsequently transferred to Harrison County, Texas,\n\nand the causes consolidated into Cause No.14-0460.\n\n      By the time of trial in October, 2015, Circle Ridge had filed its Fifth\n\nAmended Petition and Second Amended Answer, in which it asserted causes of\n\naction against Defendant Great Northern for possession of property (under a\n\nTrespass to Try Title) theory, removal of a cloud on title, (attributable to the note\n\nassignment, (from Stephens), breach of contract, for non-payment of the $700K\n\nnote). The Fifth Amended Petition also included claims against Joe Loftis and\n\nRonald J. Abercrombie for alleged violations of the Texas Civil Conspiracy and\n\nViolation of the Texas Theft Liability Act, and negligence. Great Northern had\n\n                                      Page 13 of 93\n\fexpanded the claims of which it presented in its trial petition as follows: against\n\nKevin Stephens for Breach of Contract, Unjust Enrichment, and failure to deliver\n\npurchased equipment, Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair\n\nDealing, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and tortuous interference with\n\ncontract, to remove cloud on Great Northern’s title, and for wrongful foreclosure\n\nagainst all Defendants including Briscoe, Circle Ridge and Kevin Stephens, for\n\nattorney’s fees and costs.\n\n      After midnight on October 20th and on October 21, 2015, Circle Ridge\n\nProduction filed its Notice of Non-Suit in which non-suited all claims Joe Loftis\n\nand Ronald J. Abercrombie individually, including its claims of civil conspiracy\n\nand violation of the Texas Theft Liability Act.\n\n      Trial in this matter was conducted before a jury commencing October 19,\n\n2015 after 3 ½ days of proceedings, the Court refused to allow Great Northern\n\nEnergy to submit any of its issues except wrongful foreclosure to the jury, granting\n\ndirected verdicts to Circle Ridge Production on all of Great Northern’s other\n\nclaims. The Court also ruled in favor of Circle Ridge with respect to removal of\n\nclaims as cloud of title, liability of Defendant Great Northern for Breach of\n\nContract, and for claims by third party Kevin Stephens for Breach of Contract by\n\nGreat Northern Energy. The Court further found that Great Northern owed Circle\n\nRidge Production the sum of $637,611.93 under terms of the $700K note. The only\n                                     Page 14 of 93\n\fissue submitted to the jury was with regard to Great Northern Energy’s claims that\n\nCircle Ridge had wrongfully foreclosed the lien and the Deed of Trust sale on\n\nNovember 5, 2013. The jury found adversely to Great Northern Energy with\n\nrespect to those issues submitted.\n\n      Based upon its directed verdict rulings, the Court entered Judgment for\n\nCircle Ridge Production against Great Northern Energy on Circle Ridge\n\nProductions claims against Great Northern Energy, and denied either liability or\n\nrecovery against Bill Briscoe, Kevin Stephens or Circle Ridge Production with\n\nrespect to all of Great Northern Energy’s claims. The Court entered its Judgment\n\non December 7, 2015. Further, on February 22, 2016, the Court overruled Great\n\nNorthern’s Motion for Judgment NOV and Motion for New Trial, presenting\n\nmany, if not all, of the issues presented by Appellants in this appeal.\n\n      From these preceding circumstances, Great Northern Energy brings this\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 15 of 93\n\f                    REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n\n\n      Appellant Great Northern Energy, Inc., has previously filed its Notice of\nAppeal in the Court from the \"Orders\" of the said 71\" District Court, Harrison\nCounty, Texas, dated March 30 & 31, 2016, which is pending herein as Cause\n#06-2016-15-CA, styled, Great Northern Energy, Incorporated, Appellant vs.\nCircle Ridge Production, Inc., Appellee.\n\n The Court should grant oral argument for the following reasons:\n\n       a.   Oral argument would give the Court a more complete\n            understanding of the facts presented in this appeal. See Tex. R.\n            App. P. 39.l (c).\n\n       b.   Oral argument would significantly aid the Court in deciding this\n            case. See Tex. R.\n            App. P. 38.l (e), 39.i (d).\n\n\n\n\n                                   Page 16 of 93\n\f                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      From Voir Dire, through ruling on Defendants’ Motions for New Trial and\n\nMotion for Directed Verdict, the record is filled with errors committed by the trial\n\ncourt. Certain rulings by the trial court arise from and relate to its refusal to allow\n\nDefendants to present factual evidence establishing the bases for their defenses,\n\ncounter-claims, and third party claims. All these erroneous rulings underlie, are\n\ncommon to, and result in various reversible rulings by the trial court. These\n\nevidentiary errors are presented as initial issues. Further they are incorporated into\n\nthe subsequent erroneous rulings of the Court in withdrawing Defendants’ rights to\n\nobtain proper jury findings and rulings in this case. Specifically, subsequent\n\nerroneous filings with respect to withdrawal of issues from the jury are specified,\n\nmany of which incorporate the evidentiary exclusions. From Appellants\n\nperspective, the errors are so numerous and glaring that it is impossible to submit\n\nthem in conformance with the ideal Rule of Presentation of only (3) areas. For\n\npurposes of clarity, and hopefully simplicity, the errors are organized within seven\n\neleven (11) groups or areas of wrongful conduct by the trial court; however, each\n\nissue is specified separately within the various groups. These areas are organized\n\nchronologically within the progress of the trial proceeding.\n\n      1. Errors in Voir Dire:\n\n          1-1. The Court erred in permitting counsel for 3d party Defendant\n\n\n                                      Page 17 of 93\n\f      Kevin Stephens to improperly attempt to bolster his evidentiary\n\n      contentions and prejudice Defendants through using his questions to\n\n      venire persons to support his contentions, over Defendants’\n\n      objections and to grant Defendants’ Motion for Mistrial following its\n\n      overruling of them.\n\n2. Errors in Excluding Practically All of the Testimony and Evidence\n\noffered by Defendants to support their defenses, counterclaims and\n\nthird party claims;\n\n      Errors in excluding Kevin Stephen’s testimony & exhibits:\n\n      2-1.

Great Northern is entitled to judgment that Circle Ridge take\n\nnothing, with respect to its claims for Trespass to Try Title, because\n\nthere is no sufficient legal evidence which supports such\n\ndetermination.\n\n\n\n\n                          Page 28 of 93\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      One of America’s great trial lawyers, Abraham Lincoln learned to read\n\nin front of the fireplace in his log cabin. Among his early reading text was\n\nAESOP’S Fables. Lincoln loved recounting the stories he first read there.\n\nAmong his favorites was that of the “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing”, a story in\n\nwhich a lamb, seeking the wisdom and protection of its mother bounded up a\n\nhill to a figure apparently clad in a sheep’s skin. However, upon arrival, sadly\n\nthe lamb realized it encountered the wolf covered in its mother’s wool. Sadly\n\nit was devoured. Unfortunately, Appellants would liken the lamb’s experience\n\nto theirs in seeking justice and protection of the law in this case. Sadly, from\n\nthe commencement of voir dire through the Court’s ruling on Appellant’s Post\n\nJudgment Motions, they felt deceived at every turn and ultimately devoured\n\nby their trial court experience.\n\n      From the viewpoint of Appellant, Great Northern Energy, this lawsuit is the\n\neffort of Appellees Circle Ridge Production and Kevin Stephens to avoid the\n\nconsequences of the unauthorized foreclosure of a Deed of Trust lien and its\n\nattempt to enforce the liability of Appellant Great Northern Energy as first\n\nestablished in a promissory note in the principal sum of $700,000.00 (“$700K\n\nnote”) on September 11, 2012 and a deed of trust given as security therefore on\n\nthat date. The payees in the note and beneficiaries in the deed of trust were “Circle\n\n\n                                     Page 29 of 93\n\fRidge Production and Kevin Stephens”. (CR: 3:134:9-136:15) Indeed, the Deed\n\nof Trust, designating both as “Beneficiary” (Cr: 1085, RR: 3:99:1-100:25) (Ex. 8)\n\nexpressly provides the “Beneficiary” “… may request the Trustee to proceed with\n\nforeclosure and other remedies.” Article 3, 3.1(c) CR: 1092. [page 8 of D.T.] As\n\nspecified the Uniform Commercial Code and in Texas case law ( as described in\n\nArgument and Authorities section III below) the proper enforcement of rights\n\ngranted in both the $700K note and deed of trust must be enforced in the name of\n\nboth, ”Circle Ridge Production and Kevin Stephens” and neither of those parties\n\ncan act alone in enforcement. However, in this case joint action never existed in\n\nconnection with enforcement or foreclosure, and legally it never could have\n\nexisted. Nevertheless, Circle Ridge Production attempted to and did conduct a\n\npurported foreclosure sale on November 5, 2013, (CR: 1085-1106), (RR: 3:134:9-\n\n1316:15) and asserts it right to enforce the $700K note in this lawsuit. Circle\n\nRidge’s efforts began in its Original Petition filed on June 18, 2014, (CR: 10) with\n\nits claim to own oil and gas interests in Harrison County, Texas. It further alleged\n\nthat the defendant Great Northern Energy had alleged it owned rights and titles\n\nwith respect to the liens, leases, and promissory note of September 11, 2012\n\nthrough an “assignment and bill of sale of oil and gas leases OBENCO purportedly\n\nsigned by Kevin Stephens as grantor purporting to convey all of Kevin Stephens’\n\nright title and interest to Great Northern.” (CR: 11) It further claimed that such\n\n\n                                     Page 30 of 93\n\fassignment was a forgery, “thereby rendering said Assignment and Bill of Sale\n\ninvalid and in no force and affect.” (CR: 11, 12) Its requested relief was that the\n\nCourt declare the Assignment and Bill of Sale from Stephens to Great Northern\n\ninvalid and unenforceable and ordering it removed from the title of property of\n\nsubject litigation and quieting title. (CR:13) Simply stated, Circle Ridge centered\n\nits claims upon the proposition that Great Northern had forged and assignment of\n\nKevin Stephens’ interest in and to $700K note from Kevin Stephens to Great\n\nNorthern Energy. Throughout the discovery and pretrial process Circle Ridge\n\nProduction maintained these positions, refining and expanding them through four\n\namendments to its Original Petition, including but not limited to its 5th Amended\n\nPetition upon which it based its prosecution in this trial. (CR: 1066-1125)\n\nCommencing in its First Amended Original Petition filed January 5, 2014, (CR:97)\n\nCircle Ridge expanded its claims of forgery of the Assignment from Kevin\n\nStephens to Great Northern and claims the principals of Great Northern Energy,\n\nJoe Loftis and R.J. Abercrombie has conspired to violate the Texas Civil\n\nConspiracy and Texas Theft Liability Acts in securing and recording the forged\n\nAssignment and Bill of Sale from Kevin Stephens to great Northern Energy. (Cr:\n\n101-102) These allegations continued throughout the pretrial period in successive\n\npleadings, Plaintiff 2nd Amended Petition filed on October 10, 2014 (CR: 680, 683-\n\n685), Plaintiff’s 3rd Amended Petition filed August 28, 2015 (Cr: 839, 845-847),\n\n\n                                     Page 31 of 93\n\fand in Plaintiff’s 5th Amended Petition, filed October 13, 2015 (CR: 1066, 1069-\n\n1074). However, apparently realizing its inability to establish the “forgery”\n\nallegations through competent evidence in trial, (see Statement of Facts, pages 29-\n\n30 herein). Circle Ridge surreptitiously abandoned its claims of allegations of\n\nforgery shortly after midnight, on the 2nd day of testimony, to-wit: around midnight\n\non October 20, 2015 at 12:32 a.m., (CR: 1237), in which it Non-suited all claims\n\nregarding, Non-suiting all claims against Loftis and Abercrombie, individually for\n\nviolation of civil conspiracy or of the Texas Theft Liability Act, (CR: 1238) and\n\nalso any other claims against Loftis or Abercrombie individually. Thus, when it\n\ncame time to put up or shut up, concerning Circle Ridges allegations that the\n\nAssignment of Kevin Stephens was a forged document, Circle Ridge tucked its tail\n\nand ran from any effort to prove the veracity of those allegations through\n\ncompetent evidence. Further, being unable to establish that the assignment of\n\nKevin Stephens’ interest in the $700K note and deed of trust to Great Northern in\n\nDecember 2012 was not legitimate, (CR:1238), Circle Ridge proceeded to attempt\n\nto cover its tracks for its unauthorized acts in conducting the foreclosure sale of\n\nNovember 5, 2013 (Cr:1238), RR: 3:230:14-237:20) or attempting to enforce\n\ncollection on the $700K note (CR: 1066,1075-1077, 1078-1079) (RR: 3:99:1-\n\n100:25), by enlisting the assistance of the trial Court. It’s assistance was in\n\nexcluding virtually all evidence tending to establish that neither it, nor its\n\n\n                                      Page 32 of 93\n\fdesignated Trustee Dean Searle, failed to act with proper authority in foreclosing\n\non November 5, 2013 ( RR:3:145:17-146:9, 3:146:15-149:10), or filing suit to\n\nenforce collection of the note.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 33 of 93\n\f                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n\n\n      As stated in the statement of facts, the overarching and underlying legal\n\nrelationships in this cause arise through a note of September 11, 2012 and Deed of\n\nTrust contemporaneously executed to secure its payment. The designated payee\n\nand beneficiaries in both instruments are “Circle Ridge Production, Inc., and\n\nKevin Stephens”. Because of this designation, under law, the consent of both\n\nparties, acting together, is necessary in any enforcement or collection efforts. All\n\narguments and authorities supporting those propositions are set forth in Section II\n\nArgument and Authorities.\n\n      Because Circle Ridge had conducted a wrongful foreclosure sale, acting\n\nwithout the proper authority of its remaining joint tenant Kevin Stephens, or his\n\nsuccessor in interest Great Northern Energy, Inc., Appellees initially attempted to\n\ncover their omission by claiming that as assignment of Stephens’ interest in the\n\nnote and Deed of Trust to Great Northern Energy was “forged”. All evidence, both\n\ndocumentary and testimony, that Kevin Stephens had assigned his interest to Great\n\nNorthern Energy before any foreclosure attempts or enforcement action by Circle\n\nRidge Production occurred. Notwithstanding that mountain of evidence, the court\n\nimproper allowed Kevin Stephens to testify that he gave permission to Circle\n\nRidge Production to foreclose on Great Northern, almost 10 to 11 months after he\n\n\n                                     Page 34 of 93\n\fhad assigned his interest away to Great Northern. That testimony was admitted and\n\npresented to the jury although Great Northern Energy was not allowed to present\n\nits rebuttal evidence. (See Section IV, Argument and Authorities). The testimony\n\nexcluded was not of a single witness, but rather that of 5 witnesses, including\n\nadmissions by Kevin Stephens to the effect that Great Northern had purchased\n\nKevin Stephens’ interest in the note long before any foreclosure was attempted.\n\n(See Section IV, Argument and Authorities).\n\n      The court further compounded these errors by improperly overruling\n\nAppellants counsels attempts to have the court declare a mistrial, both at the outset\n\nduring voir dire, when counsel for Kevin Stephens attempted to illegally inject\n\nevidence into the minds of the jury pool, and at the conclusion because of the\n\nmassive evidentiary exclusions.\n\n      (See Sections 6 and 7 below Argument and Authorities )\n\n      The court further compounded its errors in excluding testimony, by ruling\n\nagainst Great Northern Energy in numerous instances because it ruled that no\n\nevidence appeared of record to support submission of issues to the jury. However,\n\nthe court had excluded that evidence which was offered on a bill. Both those\n\nprocedures are improper as outlined in Section_4__ below, Argument and\n\nAuthorities. The court further compounded it errors by improperly shifting the\n\nburden of proof from Circle Ridge to Great Northern regarding the wrongful\n\n\n                                     Page 35 of 93\n\fforeclosure issues insofar as they affected Appellees claims that Great Northern\n\nwas trespassing against its title. And avoiding the burden of proof on Great\n\nNorthern with respect to which party had responsibility to establish that the\n\nforeclosure sale of November 5, 2013 was properly authorized. The court further\n\nallow improper argument by counsel for Appellees in support of the answers to\n\njury issues. (All is more particularly specified in Section 7, Argument and\n\nAuthorities).\n\n      Finally, the court committed error in overruling Great Northern Energys\n\nMotion for New Trial and Motion for Judgment NOV, insofar as it granted Circle\n\nRidges Trespass to Try Title judgment on the basis of a wholly insufficient legal\n\nbasis because evidence of title and third parties was introduced into the record and\n\nnegated and because Circle Ridge impleaded the parties into the cause who later\n\nfiled answers, to wit: the United States Government with an Internal Revenue\n\nService lien, without establishing a proper evidentiary basis to exclude that lien.\n\nFinally, it improperly ruled that Circle Ridge had the right to collect the $700K\n\nnote proceeds from Great Northern Energy, when in fact, in law, there has never\n\nbeen any proper enforcement of the note.\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 36 of 93\n\f                        ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n\n                                    I.\n                            STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n Because different standards of review apply to the various issues presented as\n\nerrors in this brief, each standard is separately stated within the specific areas to\n\nwhich it applies.\n\n                                          II.\n\n                    September 11, 2012 Note and Deed of Trust\n\n        As previously described in the Statement of Facts, central events in this\n\n dispute arise from the enforcement attempts and foreclosure by Circle Ridge\n\n Production of a Promissory note in the original principal sum of $700,000.00,\n\n together with a Deed of Trust securing same, and both made to “Circle Ridge\n\n Production, Inc. and Kevin Stephens”, as payees in the note, (CR1107-1111)\n\n and_(RR3:98:1-98:24) and beneficiaries in the Deed of Trust. (CR1084:1106) (RR\n\n Ex.9). These designations, created a joint tenancy, and, in this case, requires that\n\n both Circle Ridge Production, Inc., and Kevin Stephens must act to enforce the\n\n note, §3.3110 (d), Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. (2016), or authorize the trustee to\n\n foreclose the deed of trust lien indeed, the Deed of Trust itself designates “Circle\n\n Ridge Inc., and Kevin Stephens” as “Beneficiary”.(CR 1085)(RR Ex 9, page 1.)\n\n Further, in article 3, “Defaults & Remedies”, the Deed of Trust provides at\n                                        Page 37 of 93\n\fparagraph 3.2 “remedies”…”Beneficiary may…do any one or more of the\n\nfollowing to the extent permitted by applicable law: (c)…Foreclosure…request the\n\ntrustee to proceed with foreclosure. (CR 1092, Ex 9, (Everbank v. Seedergy\n\nVentures, Inc., 2016 Tex.App. LEXIS 7319 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2016), But, in this case, no such joint action occurred, nor was it ever possible at\n\nany time after January 1, 2013, because in December, 2012, Kevin Stephens\n\nassigned all of his right, title and interest in the note and liens to Great Northern\n\nEnergy, (RR3:98:1-98:24); and Great Northern Energy paid the consideration of\n\napproximately $60,000.000, to Kevin Stephens’ family members, (RR3:227:8-\n\n230:13), as directed by Kevin Stephens, (RR3:227:8-230:13). There is enormous\n\nsignificance in the impact of the word “and” in this designation.\n\n      Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, Texas Business and Commerce\n\nCode adaption of the UCC, controls enforcement of rights arising pursuant to\n\npromissory notes and negotiable instruments. The relevant statutory provision is\n\n§3.110, “Identification of the Person to Who Instrument is Payable” Tex. Bus. &\n\nCom. Code Ann.§3.3110 (West 2015). Specifically, subsection (d) of §3.3110\n\nprovides in relevant part, “…(i)f an instrument is payable to two or more persons\n\nnot alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged,\n\nor enforced only by all of them.” Id. at §3.3110(d). The Comment 4 attached to\n\n(and part of) this Code section discusses subsection (d) with this explanation:\n\n\n                                      Page 38 of 93\n\f        “…If an instrument is payable to X and Y, neither X nor Y acting\n        alone can be the holder of the instrument. The instrument is ‘payable to\n        an identified person.’ The ‘identified person’ is X and Y acting jointly.\n        Section 3-109(b) and 1-102(5)(a). Thus,…X or Y acting alone, cannot be\n        the holder or person entitled to enforce or negotiate the instrument because\n        either, acting alone, cannot be the holder or the person entitled to enforce,\n        or negotiate the instrument because neither, acting alone, is the identified\n        person stated in the instrument.”\n\n        Thus, Circle Ridge, acting alone does not have the power to enforce or\n\nforeclose on the liens securing payment thereof.

(CR1085-1111)(RR3:99:1-100:25), (Ex.8)) In trial, Circle\n\nRidge attempted to convince the jury that is could proceed in its collection and\n\nenforcement efforts, acting alone because it had been authorized to do so by\n\nKevin Stephens in behalf of Kevin Stephens and Circle Ridge Production, Inc.\n\nBill Briscoe testified Kevin Stephens gave him oral permission to foreclose in\n\nNovember, 2013, (RR 3:104: 17-109:24). Kevin Stephens testified that he gave\n                                     Page 43 of 93\n\fBill Briscoe permission to foreclose on his interest in the $700K note and Deed\n\nof Trust, (RR3:200:19-202:19), Circle Ridge Production argued that fact to the\n\nCourt (RR 5:14”23-18:3) (RR 3:200:19-202:19). However, the Court wholly and\n\ncompletely to refused to allow Defendants to offer testimony through either the\n\ncross examination of Kevin Stephens (RR3:210:3-213:25), the direct testimony\n\nof Joe Loftis (RR4:38:6-4:39:11), the direct testimony of Michael Stephens\n\n(RR4:292:17-305:11), that Kevin Stephens had assigned his interest in the\n\npromissory note, as permitted by Section 3:201, (TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE\n\nANN.) (LEXIS NEXIS 2016 ).\n\n      However, specific testimony as set forth below was offered by Joe Loftis,\n\nof the negotiation, and execution and delivery of the note and Deed of Trust lien\n\nassignment by Kevin Stephens (RR4:38:6-4:39:11,4:141:127-151:4), as well as\n\nthe payment of the sum of $10,000 to Michael Stephens (RR4:141:17-151:4) and\n\n$50,000 Kevin Stephens father Bobby Stephens (RR4:141:17-151:4) at Kevin\n\nStephens direction, (Michael Stephens testimony)(RR4:303:13-305:11). That\n\ntestimony was supported by both Joe Loftis and Kevin Stephens, and the\n\nadmission of Kevin Stephens under oath in cross examination under Defendants\n\nbill of exceptions, that he had executed contracts assigning such note and its\n\nattached liens to Circle Ridge in December 2012, (RR3:210:3-213:25). Further,\n\nMichael Stephens testified that he had personally informed Bill Briscoe,\n\n                                     Page 44 of 93\n\fPresident of Circle Ridge Production, Inc., all of the Stephens family’s\n\nassignments to Great Northern,(RR4:298:20-299:1), relevant and material to the\n\njury determination of the issues presented to it, namely: whether the foreclosure\n\nof November 5, 2013 was properly conducted. It would not be properly\n\nconducted if the trustee conducting that sale did not have proper authority to do\n\nso. As set forth in Sec. II, page 35-39, above, it is axiomatic that Circle Ridge\n\nacting alone, did not have the authority to enforce the note. (Subsection D),\n\n(Section 3.3110, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code.) (West 2015).\n\n      The court erred in its refusal to allow the testimony of Lofts, that Kevin\n\nStephens sold and assigned his interest in the underlying note and liens to Circle\n\nRidge as (RR4:38:6-39:11-Bill of Exceptions) (and through Exhibits 16, 17, 18,\n\n20, and 21) the testimony of Kevin Stephens acknowledging that he signed such\n\ndocuments (and sold his interest) (RR3:210:3-213:25, and Exhibits 16,17,and 18)\n\nthe testimony of his brother Michael Stephens that such transaction occurred, and\n\nthe testimony of Kayla Marrs, impeaching Kevin Stephens insofar as he denied\n\nexecuting one of the contracts (Kayla Marrs being the notary before whom he\n\nappeared to acknowledge his execution) (RR3:216:9-219:5). Four separate\n\nwitnesses testified that Kevin Stephens assigned his rights in and to the $700K\n\nnote and its underlying liens to Great Northern Energy, yet the Court wholly\n\nexcluded, blocked and prevented the jury from having any knowledge\n\n                                     Page 45 of 93\n\fwhatsoever of such occurrence. The reason initially given by the Court for\n\nexcluding such evidence was that the assignment instrument offered by\n\nAppellants, was excluded by the statute of frauds objections of Circle Ridge;\n\nhowever, when Defendants counsel pointed out on the morning of the 2nd day of\n\ntrial, that statute of frauds did not apply because it did not apply to an assignment\n\nof mortgage, and the contract was a performed contract, nevertheless, the Court\n\npersisted in excluding Defendants attempts to offer defensive testimony as just\n\noutlined, saying that “I just don’t think you can block a foreclosure by buying\n\n1% of a note.” (RR4:311:24-322:17) That comment by the Court indicates three\n\nareas of bias or prejudice and prejudgment of this case. First, it is not reflective\n\nof any of the testimony of the case, because there is no evidence that anyone\n\nbought or attempted to buy only 1% of a note to block a foreclosure. Rather, the\n\nevidence in this case (albeit offered through the Bill of Exception) conclusively\n\nestablishes that the transaction to purchase Kevin Stephens interest occurred\n\nDecember 2012, almost a year before the foreclosure.(RR3:210:3-213:25). There\n\nwas no discussion of foreclosure at the time the Defendant Great Northern\n\nEnergy purchased the note. Second, the Courts application of that ruling is\n\ncompletely contrary to the applicable standards of both the uniform commercial\n\ncode, of the express language of the Deed of Trust, and of joint tenancy rules\n\nwhich require the action of both parties who then own the note at the time of the\n\n\n                                      Page 46 of 93\n\fforeclosure to proceed with enforcement. Through its exclusion of evidence, the\n\nCourt left the jury with the impression that Kevin Stephens owned an interest in\n\nthe note and had the right to grant his consent in November 2013, when he had\n\nparted with his ownership interest in and to the note in December 2012. Finally,\n\nthe Court substitutes its preference for outcome i.e. that Appellants cannot\n\ncontest foreclosure actions without giving the jury the opportunity to fully weigh\n\nall relevant evidence.\n\n      Insofar as the Court refused to admit Appellants Exhibits #16 (the Rojo\n\nBurro contract wherein Kevin Stephens agrees to assign interest in and to the\n\nnote and liens to Great Northern), #17 (additional Rojo Burro contract\n\nacknowledging before Kayla Marrs), #18 (note and lien assignment from Kevin\n\nStephens to Great Northern (#GN12, exhibit Defendant #12) as offered,\n\nRR3:196:2-199:1, 3:200-19-209:18,3:220:1-223:1, GN Ex. 16 & 18, it prevented\n\nAppellants from proving their defenses, rebutting Appellees testimony regarding\n\nits authority to foreclose, and from proving their affirmative claims.\n\n(RR:4:239:5-241:8). Clearly all of this testimony is relevant and material, as the\n\nTexas Supreme Court indicated in its ruling in Anderson v. Gilbert, 897 S.W.2d,\n\n783, 784-785, per curiam, overruling the 5th Court of Appeals in Dallas for its\n\nfailure to properly evaluate claims as to whether only one of the joint tenants in a\n\nnote in which …”Gilbert and Gideon” were joint payees of the note and joint\n\n                                     Page 47 of 93\n\fbeneficiaries of the Deed of Trust id. at 784 had properly acted through only one\n\nof the joint tenants in causing a foreclosure sale to be executed and sue for a\n\ndeficiency. id.at 785. The Texas Supreme Court reversed the Dallas Court of\n\nAppeals for failing to evaluate whether only one joint tenant (in an “and” note\n\nand Deed of Trust situation) had received a proper assignment of the interest\n\nfrom the remaining joint tenant of their rights under the note before conducting\n\nthe foreclosure or engaging in enforcement. id at 785. It ordered the Appellate\n\nCourt to consider and evaluate the claims of a note payee that no proper\n\nassignment of the interest of Gideon or his widow had occurred before Gilbert\n\nacted alone to…cause a foreclosure sale to be executed and sue Anderson for\n\ndeficiency. i.d. at 785. This analysis is precisely in point in this case. If a Court\n\nof Appeals must evaluate whether one joint tenant has properly assignment\n\ninterest to a second joint tenant, before the second commences foreclosure or\n\nnote enforcement actions, clearly the trial court must allow the admission of such\n\nevidence. Further, these facts were identified in the testimony of Nate Moran\n\n(RR:220:9-222:1), documentary evidence of the contract by Kevin Stephens to\n\nassign his interest in the note and liens, the actual assignment,(Exhibits GN 16,\n\n17, 18, & RR 4:310:11-311:22, 4:325:225), and the testimony of Nate Moran,\n\nthat he had calculated payments to Circle Ridge Productions only, in calculating\n\nthe amounts due on the note (RR: 4:239:5-241:8). Thus, the only party with\n\n\n                                       Page 48 of 93\n\fwhom Mr. Moran dealt in representing Great Northern, was Dean Searle, who\n\nacted in behalf of Circle Ridge Production, solely.\n\n      Similarly, the Court erred in excluding the testimony of Michael Stephens,\n\nthat the Rojo Burro transaction was a part of the sale and assignment of the\n\nKevin Stephens interest in the $700K note to Great Northern (RR:4:248:13-\n\n250:251).\n\n      The Court systematically excluded either oral testimony and/or documentary\n\nevidence offered through oral testimony, relating to any attempt by Great Northern\n\nto establish before the jury that Kevin Stephens had assigned his interest in the\n\nnote and Deed of Trust of September 11, 2012, to Great Northern Energy before\n\nthe foreclosure on November 5, 2013. Further, it excluded evidence that the\n\nPresident of Circle Ridge Production, Bill Briscoe, had notice of that assignment\n\nbefore he attempted any foreclosure as did his attorney, Dean Searle, who was the\n\ntrustee conducting the foreclosure sale on November 5, 2013.(RR3:145:17-146:9)\n\nThe Court excluded the testimony of 5 separate witnesses regarding events\n\nconnected to the assignment, or collection or enforcement of the $700K note, as set\n\nforth below. No testimony or exhibits relating to the assignment from Kevin\n\nStephens to Great Northern were admitted before the jury. The Court wholly\n\nexcluded and prohibited the jury from knowledge of any such relevant and material\n\nevidence. However, all of such testimony was introduced in Bills of Exception by\n\n                                     Page 49 of 93\n\fAppellants. Simply stated, the Court refused to allow Appellants to introduce\n\nmaterial and relevant evidence supporting their claims and defenses before the\n\njury, on a systematic and intentional basis. The following specific testimony which\n\nDefendants attempted to offer through the individuals identified, was excluded and\n\nappears on a Bill as hereafter indicated:\n\n      a.     Errors in excluding Kevin Stephens’ testimony and exhibits:\n\n      b.     Errors in excluding testimony and exhibits offered through Bill of\n\n             Exceptions testimony of Kevin Stephens:\n\nThe Court allowed Bill Briscoe to testify that he obtained “oral” permission to\n\nforeclose his lien from Kevin Stephens, (RR 3:105: 17-109:24). He further claimed\n\nthat after the foreclosure sale he purchased Kevin Stephens’ interest in the note,\n\n(CRP Ex 11, assignment from Kevin Stephens to Circle Ridge Production dated\n\nDecember 11, 2013) (RR 3:112:10-113:24, CRP Ex 11). Bill Briscoe did\n\nacknowledge that all documents including the promissory note and Deed of Trust\n\nwere made jointly payable to Circle Production and Kevin Stephens and that both\n\nCircle Ridge Production and Kevin Stephens were the designated beneficiaries of\n\nthe Deed of Trust.(RR3:134:9-136:15). He further acknowledged that the\n\nforeclosure demand (CRP Ex 15)(RR3:136:15-138:22), states it is only in behalf of\n\nCircle Ridge Production interest in the note, (RR 3:138:20-140:10). Briscoe further\n\nacknowledged that the demand letter of July 2013 and the October demand letter of\n\n\n                                     Page 50 of 93\n\fforeclosure (CRP Ex 14), were in behalf of Circle Ridge Production (RR 3:143:10-\n\n145:14). Briscoe further acknowledged that Kevin Stephens had told him he had\n\nparticipated with Great Northern in the Rangeford Resources transaction, (RR\n\n3:145:17-146:9). However, the Court refused to allow Great Northerns attorney to\n\ncross examine Mr. Briscoe when he attempted to specifically obtain Mr. Briscoe’s\n\nadmission that it had prior notice before the foreclosure, (RR 3:146:15-149:10). It\n\nfurther excluded evidence which Appellants counsel attempted to offer that Circle\n\nRidge Production did not own Kevin Stephens interest on November 5, 2013,\n\nwhen it foreclosed, (RR 3:151:22-153:6). It further refused to allow the\n\nintroduction of correspondence with Nate Moran, (CRP Ex 20), establishing the\n\namount of $171, 000 as a payoff amount on Circle Ridges portion of the note in\n\ncorrespondence between Dean Searle and Great Northern, a payoff sheet from\n\nDean Searle, acting as attorney for Circle Ridge (RR 3:158:4-162:9).\n\nNotwithstanding these refusals to permit cross-examination by Great Northerns’\n\ncounsel, it allowed Kevin Stephens’ attorney to examine and introduce into\n\nevidence through Bill Briscoe, Bill Briscoe’s claim that he had no notice that\n\nKevin Stephens had assigned his interest in the $700K note before he received his\n\nassignment of Kevin Stephens’ interest on December 13, 2013.(RR 3:146:15-\n\n149:10).\n\n      The Court allowed testimony from Kevin Stephens that he gave Bill Briscoe\n\n\n                                    Page 51 of 93\n\fpermission to foreclose his interest on the $700K note and Deed of Trust (RR\n\n3:201:8-13, 200:19-202:19). Inexplicably, it refused to allow Great Northerns\n\nattorney to cross-examine Kevin Stephens to dispute the fact that he had any\n\nownership interest in either the note or the Deed of Trust lien at the time he sold\n\nhis interest to Briscoe in December 2013.(RR3:210:3-213:25, 3:220:1-223:13)or\n\n(RR 3:200:19-201:13, 3:203 25-209:18). Instead, the Court only allowed Great\n\nNorthern Energy’s attorney to present its cross-examination of Kevin Stephens in a\n\nBill of Exceptions: (RR 3:210:3-252:17 and 4:31:22). During the course of Kevin\n\nStephens’s testimony, taken during the Bill of Exceptions by Appellants attorney,\n\nKevin Stephens testified among other facts as follows:\n\n             1. That he admitted he signed the document introduced as GN Ex 16,\n\naround December 1, 2012 (RR 3:210:3-213-:25), in which he assigned his interest\n\nin the note and Deed of Trust and Lien (GN Ex 18)(RR3:210:3-213:25, 4:310:11-\n\n311:22,325:20-25) accompanying the note to Great Northern in order to participate\n\nproposed transaction wherein the “OBENCO” package would be included in the\n\nRangeford Resources transaction. He denied that he had signed a similar contract\n\n(GN Ex 17) Rojo Burro to Great Northern Energy contract before an independent\n\nnotary, Kayla Marrs, around October 24, 2012, (RR3:215:4-216:25), and\n\nequivocating as to whether his signature appeared on the document (RR 3:216:9-\n\n219:25). Although he denied the validity or genuineness of his signature on GN 17\n\n\n                                     Page 52 of 93\n\fbefore Kayla Marrs, an independent notary, he did acknowledge signing the\n\nagreements which were (GN Ex 16 & 18), the original Rojo Burro contract he\n\nadmitted signing and the actual assignment of all of his right title and interest,\n\nincluding (GN Ex 18), which is a purchase of note and financial instrument Kevin\n\nStephens into Great Northern Energy, Inc., “OBENCO” properties. Kevin\n\nStephens acknowledged executing that document on that date. Kevin Stephens\n\nfurther acknowledged that Great Northern tendered the sum of $10,000 to his\n\nbrother Michael Stephens and $50,000 to his dad Bobby Stephens in satisfaction of\n\nits obligations under Ex 16 and 18 in December, 2012 (RR 3:227:8-230-13).\n\nB. The Court erred in refusing to allow Joe Loftis, President of Great Northern\n\nEnergy, Inc., to testify concerning Kevin Stephens assignments of his interests.\n\n      The Court erred in excluding the testimony of Joe Loftis, President of Great\n\nNorthern Energy, Inc., (offered on a Bill of Exceptions) (RR:4:141:17-151:4), that\n\nGreat Northern entered into a contract with Kevin Stephens and Michael Stephens\n\nfor the acquisition of Kevin Stephens interests in the $700K promissory note and\n\nDeed of Trust, through (GN Ex 16, 17,) (RR4:141:17:144:11). It excluded\n\ntestimony explaining Kevin Stephens’ election to take $62,500 initially and\n\n$62,500 on one year after December 1, 2012, to wit: December 1, 2013 (RR\n\n4:144:2-17.) Further, Loftis testified on the Bill of Exceptions that Kevin Stephens\n\nassigned the document to Great Northern in GN Ex 18(RR: 144:18-145:24).

The Court erred in exclusion of Kayla Marrs testimonies as offered on the\n\nBill of Exceptions. Kayla Marrs, is a notary public who acknowledged GN Ex17\n\n(RR 4:206 :22-207-15). She verified that her acknowledgement on GN Ex 17 was\n\nvalid and impeached Kevin Stephens testimony that he had executed and\n\nacknowledged the same, as he did that before her and in her presence (RR\n\n4:207:16-209:5).\n\nD.

The Court erred in excluding Michael\n\nStephens testimony that he personally delivered notice to Mr. Briscoe of the\n\nStephens families decision to participate with Great Northern in the Rangeford\n\nResources transaction and to assign its interest in the $700K note to Great Northern\n\ntogether with all liens, in the fall of 2012 (RR 4: 298:5-299:1): The court erred in\n\nexcluding Michael Stephens identification of GN Ex 16 & 18 (the assignment) and\n\nexplaining the terms of payment and the payment of same: for $62,500 (RR4:299\n\n9-302:3) and expressing (RR: 4:300:14-302:12).

Approximately 80% of the evidentiary offers by Appellants were\n\nexcluded. While certain evidentiary exclusions or rulings may not be reversible\n\nerror, clearly these were. The improper exclusion of competent and relevant\n\nevidence to material injury of the complaining party should result in reversal. See:\n\nAnderson v. Gilbert, supra, Modine Mfg.Co. the North E.

In fact, in response to Appellants\n\nattorney’s objections regarding the exclusion of Appellants evidence, the Court\n\nacknowledged understanding Appellants attorney’s objections, but responded, that\n\nhe did not believe that the Appellant could “block” a foreclosure by buying 1% of\n\nthe note. (RR4:316:25-317:8). Clearly, this comment indicates the Judge’s bias,\n\nprejudice or pre-judgment of this case. Further, in the issues submitted to the jury\n\nthe specific inquiry into question number one was “requesting whether “Great\n\nNorthern Energy established a defect in the foreclosure sale of November 5, 2013.”\n\nA defect would be a foreclosure sale (CR 1254) would be one that was conducted\n\nwithout proper authorization. However, in all of the evidence recited above in\n\nitems the Court blocked Great Northerns attempts to introduce any evidence\n\nsubstantiating its claims that there was never any proper authority to conduct such\n\nsale in behalf of only Circle Ridge Production by Dean Searle. Instead, the\n\nevidence before the jury was that “Kevin Stephens had authorized Bill Briscoe to\n\nact for Kevin Stephens’ interest in the foreclosure sale in November 2013.”\n\n(RR:3:200:19-202:19). Clearly the absence of this evidence affected the jury’s\n\ndecisions, and the Courts entry of judgment that Great Northern had not “proved”\n\nits wrongful foreclosure allegations.

The evaluation standard for this Court in\n\ndetermining the propriety of the trial court’s action in granting Motions for\n\nDirected Verdict or removing matters from consideration from the jury to grant a\n\nDirected Verdict, is whether the party opposing the granting of the Directed\n\nVerdict or removal of issues from the jury has presented any evidence of probative\n\nworth, raising a material fact issue and establishing a claim or defense, while\n\nviewing such evidence in the light most favorable to, in the case Appellants.

Maris, 828, S.W. 2d, 756, 758(Tex.1992), supra, 758, and Anderson v. Gilbert,\n\nsupra, at 784-85\n\n      In evaluating whether Appellants submitted sufficient evidence of probative\n\nworth, raising a material fact issue and establishing a claim or defense, the\n\nevidence described in Section IV. 43-58 above, must be viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to Appellants; however, the Court excluded that evidence, but it was\n\nbefore the Court through the Bills of Exception recited previously and offered by\n\nAppellants.\n\n      The prejudicial and apparently intentional nature and extent of the Courts\n\nactions in excluding the evidence recited in Section IV 43-58 above, is apparent.\n\nSimply stated, the Court refused to allow evidence in support of Appellees claims\n\nand defenses as indicated below and then rendered its judgment because contrary\n\nevidence did not appear on the record. Since these issues were never presented to\n\nthe jury, it is essentially immaterial whether the unsupporting evidentiary matters\n\nwere formally admitted into evidence.\n\n      The following issues are those which the Court erred in connection with the\n\n\n                                     Page 59 of 93\n\fentry of a Directed Verdict or overruling Appellants claims, to wit:\n\n\n5-1. The Court erred in granting Circle Ridges’ motion that Great Northern\nbreached the $700K promissory note and owed the sum of $637,114.15 to Circle\nRidge Production as liability on such note.\n\n      Many of the statutes and case authorities relating to this issue have been set\n\nforth above in Section II of this Argument of Authorities portion. Those arguments\n\nare incorporated into this section by reference as though set forth verbatim herein.\n\n\n      The central issue is determining liability on the note, is whether any liability\n\non the note at this point can be properly enforced. Extensive testimony was\n\noffered to the effect that Bill Briscoe attempted to act alone. All demands (RR\n\n4:222:18-223:6) were made by Searle in behalf of only the Circle Ridge portion of\n\nthe note. Nate Moran testified in the Bill of Exceptions that all his negotiations\n\nwith Dean Searle were conducted with Searle acting only in behalf of Circle Ridge\n\nProduction (RR4:213:9-218:13). Joe Loftis, Michael Stephens testified, and even\n\nKevin Stephens acknowledged through testimony offered in Bills of Exception that\n\nin December, 2012, Kevin Stephens interest in the note was assigned to Great\n\nNorthern Energy. This lawsuit, including any actions to enforce liability on the\n\nnote by Circle Ridge Production was not filed until June 18, 2014 (CR:10-45).\n\nClearly, the assignment of Kevin Stephens’s interest in and to the 700K note to\n\nGreat Northern, occurred prior to June 18, 2014. As stated above, this evidence\n\n\n                                     Page 60 of 93\n\fmust be viewed in the light most favorable to Appellants. As specified in Leavings\n\nv. Mills, supra, (310). Texas is a state were “enforcement follows the note”. It is\n\nelementary that Kevin Stephens had the right to assign his interest in the note and\n\nliens to Great Northern. (§3.203(d), comment 5, Tex. Bus. And Comm. Code\n\nrecognizing the effectiveness of partial assignments in note ownership. The Court\n\ncompletely refused to recognize or honor Great Northern’s ownership interest in\n\nthe note, following Kevin Stephen’s assignment, or its failure to authorize Bill\n\nBriscoe, President of Circle Ridge, to proceed with enforcement of the note. Those\n\nadmissions are errors by the Court. As the Texas Supreme Court stated the\n\nconsiderations which were necessary in evaluating whether proper authority to\n\nproceed in an, “x and y” foreclosure of deed of trust, and note enforcement,\n\nexisted, it should include factual evaluation of whether only one joint tenant acting\n\nalone had received a proper assignment of rights from a successor interest owner.\n\nHere there is no evidence of a proper assignment. Anderson v Gilbert, supra, 784-\n\n785. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons and does not provide that it\n\nis payable to them in alternative, it can only be enforced by all payees, and all co-\n\npayees should be joined in the action. Page Airways, Inc., v. the Associated Radio\n\nService Co., 545 184, 189-190(Tex. Civ. App.-San Antonio, 1976, writ ref’d.\n\nn.r.e.) Further, the fact that the interest of Kevin Stephens was assigned, to GNE\n\nmaybe be established by proving the transaction through which it acquired the\n\n\n                                     Page 61 of 93\n\finterest of Stephens, Sections 3.201(c), comment C, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code. See\n\nalso Lawson v. Finance America Private Brands, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1778300\"><a href=\"/opinion/1778300/lawson-v-finance-america-private-brands/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485(Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.-El Paso, 1976, no writ). Once the transactions established however, the\n\ntransferee acquires the same rights as the transferor had under the instrument (Tex.\n\nBus. & Com .Code Section 3.201(a)). Clearly, evidence exists that Great Northern\n\nowned Kevin Stephens’ interest. The Court’s refusal to acknowledge this evidence\n\nmuch less admit it, is construed, and constitutes a reversible error, because the\n\nCourt failed to consider the ocean of evidence supporting Appellants position. In\n\nfact, there is not one scintilla of evidence in the trial that indicates or evidences the\n\nfact that Briscoe acted with permission of the proper parties. Evidence of the fact\n\nthat he had no evidence or basis to establish that Kevin Stephens owned any\n\ninterest in the note or that he acted in his behalf. Clearly he did not act in behalf of\n\nGreat Northern Energy with respect to the subsequently acquire interest in the\n\nSeptember 11, 2012 note from Kevin Stephens. In short, the proper parties\n\nPlaintiff, have never prosecuted this note, and no liability can exist,\n\nnotwithstanding the Court’s attempts to enter its Directed Judgment at the\n\nconclusion of the trial, in the Final Judgment submitted.\n\n\n      Further, insofar as Appellees may argue that Appellants had stipulated to\n\nany amount owed under terms of the note, any and all of such stipulations are\n\nconditional, and apply only in the event that “Circle Ridge Production owns 100%\n\n                                       Page 62 of 93\n\fof the note and GNE does not own undivided ½ interest as assignee of Kevin\n\nStephens. There is abundance evidence in the record to suggest the assignment of\n\ninterest from Kevin Stephens to GNE, it has been excluded by the Court, and is\n\ncontrary to the presumption that it should have been presented to the jury. Clearly\n\nthe granting of these Directed Verdicts was an error by the Court.\n\n\nV-2.

Further, Kevin Stephens acknowledged that he had a\n\ncontractual agreement to furnish pipe and supplies to Great Northern\n\n(RR:4:305:12-309:2). This evidence establishes the existence of an agreement.\n\nFurther, the testimony of Joe Loftis that the equipment was removed, and\n\n(RR:4:29:6-31:22), and that of Michael Stephens that he felt entitled to remove the\n\nequipment (RR:4:39:13-46:4, establishes the basis for submission of a Breach of\n\nContract issued. Further, the testimony as to the amount of money paid establishes\n\nthe loss (RR:4:39:13-46:4). Thus, Great Northern has satisfied its requirements to\n\npresent testimony sufficient to meet his burden of proof for submission of the\n\nBreach of Contract issued to the jury; however, the Court refused to present this\n\nmatter to the jury, ruling that no evidence existed. Of course no evidence existed,\n\nthe Court prevented the evidence from being introduced. The presumption exist\n\nthat this testimony, viewed most favorably in Great Northern Energy’s perspective,\n\nshould have been presented. The Court erred in failing to do so and Great Northern\n\nis entitled to submit these issues to a proper trier of facts.\n                                       Page 64 of 93\n\fV.3 Great Northern submits the Court erred in granting the motions of Bill Briscoe\nand Kevin Stephens for Directed Verdict against Great Northern with respect to\nGreat Northerns claims for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair\nDealing.\n\n      In determining whether a cause of action can be characterized as a Breach of\n\nContract, a Tort or both, the Courts consider (1) the source of Defendants duty to\n\nact and (2) the nature of the remedy or damages sought by the Plaintiff.

Specifically, the actions\n\nof Stephens and Briscoe, interfered with Great Northerns ability to prosecute its\n\nefforts in developing the subject property as testified by Loftis, (RR:4:53:13-87:5.\n\nBriscoes’ claims to purchase the interest, which he already knew were sold, are\n\nalso an interference as further outlined below. Thus, and independent duty in Tort\n\narises, and violates the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.\n\n                             VI. Refusal to Grant Mistrial\n\n      The Court erred in failing to grant Great Northern Energy,\nIncorporated, Ronald J. Abercrombie, and Joseph B. Loftis’ Motion for\nMistrial prior to the submission of this cause to the Jury.\n\n      Before this cause was submitted to the jury, counsel for appellants moved\n\nthe Court to grant and order a mistrial in this cause. (RR 5:11:14-21) It was the\n\nsecond time such a motion had been presented. At the outset of the trial, during\n\nthe voir dire presentation of Kevin Stephens’ counsel, a similar Motion had also\n\n\n                                      Page 67 of 93\n\fbeen presented. (RR2:128:2-9), see, “Improper Voir Dire” Section III, pages 41-\n\n43 above, and now incorporated herein by reference). This subsequent Motion for\n\nMistrial was presented after the Court’s evidentiary rulings had excluded over 75%\n\nof the evidence Appellants offered for their defenses and counter-claims, and over\n\n80% of the documents they attempted to offer in support of their claims and\n\ndefenses. From appellants’ view, simply stated, they had been denied the\n\nopportunity to fairly present their evidence of their well plead claims and defenses\n\nbecause of wholly erroneous evidentiary rulings by the Court excluding that\n\nevidence, and because of the prejudicial and improper conduct of voir dire, and\n\nbecause, cumulatively, the error was so enormous it was impossible for any jury to\n\nfairly evaluate the truth and credibility of their claims and defenses. The legal\n\nauthority supporting Appellants Motion for Mistrial are set forth in Section III,\n\npages 41-43 above, and in the authorities and arguments presented in Section III__,\n\npages 41-43 below, applicable to cumulative error, are applicable to the evaluation\n\nof whether the trial court erred in failing to grant Appellants Motion for Mistrial\n\npresented prior to jury submission.. All of such arguments and authorities are\n\nincorporated into this Section 4, and re-urged here:\n\n             VII.- Errors Related to Jury Submission & Argument\n\n             A. Errors with respect to Jury Questions and Answers:\n\n            VII-1. the Court erred in improperly submitting the jury issues to the\n         jury as submitted because it improperly shifted the burden of proof to\n                                     Page 68 of 93\n\f   Great Northern.\n       VII-2. the Court erred in awarding judgment based upon the findings\n   of the jury that the Courts answers to questions 1 and 2 were immaterial\n   because the evidence proves conclusively as a matter of law, that the\n   foreclosure sale on November 5, 2013 was improperly conducted.\n\n\n   B. the Court erred in allowing counsel for Circle Ridge to make the\n   following improper jury arguments;\n\n       VII-3. With respect to question number 1, insofar as counsel for\n   Circle Ridge asserts the burden of proof was on Defendant to disprove\n   the that the foreclosure sale of November 5, 2013, was properly\n   conducted, the burden was not upon Great Northern Energy, but rather\n   upon Circle Ridge.\n       VII-4. the Court erred in allowing counsel for Circle Ridge\n   Production to make an improper and prejudicial argument, insofar as it\n   allowed such counsel to read a stipulation to the jury that Great Northern\n   owed Circle Ridge $637,114.15 under terms of the note when such\n   representation was in fact a misrepresentation known to all parties and\n   submitted over Great Northerns objections.\n\n   Because the trial court’s errors relating to the submission of issues and\n\n   instructions to the jury, relating to arguments improperly allowed to be\n\n   presented to the jury by Circle Ridge’s and Third Party Defendant’s\n\n   counsel, and relating to the trial court’s entry of judgment for Appellees\n\n   based on the jury’s answers to the questions submitted, are related and\n\n exemplify the “intertwined” totality of the trial court’s “errors” in this\n\n cause, Appellant’s argument and authorities with respect to points of error\n\n#VII-1-VIII-A above, are combined in this response.

In a\n\ntrespass to try title case, the burden is always on the Plaintiff to establish\n\ngood title, is the Plaintiff’s responsibility, and a plaintiff cannot prevail\n\nbased on the failure of opposing parties to establish good title in the\n\nopposing party. In this case, however, although the Trial Court did not\n\ngrant Circle Ridges Production’s request for Directed Verdict,\n\n(RR5:14:23-18:04,5:19:19-25), implying that there were fact issues for\n\njury evaluation, it shifted the Proof of Burden to Great Northern.

The burden of proof in a trespass to try title action does not\n\nshift to the defendant, it remains with the Plaintiff, in this case Circle\n\n\n                            Page 71 of 93\n\fRidge to establish the valid conduct of the foreclosure sale.

That is an improper shifting of the burden\n\nof proof, and an improper jury submission, contrary to established law;\n\nand thus, an abuse of discretion.\n\n   Additionally, the Court permitted the counsel for Circle Ridge to\n\nargue before the jury that Great Northern had stipulated that it owed\n\n$637,114.15 (RR 5:22:4-30:4 ). In fact, Appellants attorney only\n\nstipulated that such sum would be a proper calculation in the event Great\n\nNorthern had not purchased Kevin Stephen’s one half interest in the note\n\n(RR 5:25:4-26:22, and in the event the note was properly enforced in the\n\nname of “Circle Ridge Production, Inc. and Great Northern Energy,\n\nIncorporated, successor in interest to Kevin Stephens”. (RR 5:22:3-\n\n30:4). Of course, the court would not permit that stipulation, as stated, to\n\nbe used in jury argument, because it had excluded all evidence of such\n\nassignment of interest (see, Section II & IV above). Appellant’s attorney\n\nstipulated that Defendant’s counsel might argue same, subject however,\n\nto Appellants objection, which the Court overruled. (RR 5:22:13-30:14).\n\n\n                           Page 72 of 93\n\fThus, Circle Ridge’s counsel improperly argued to the jury that Great\n\nNorthern had stipulated it owed the sum of $637,114.15. That erroneous\n\nstatement of evidence was prejudicial and likely caused error in the jury’s\n\ndeliberations. (Add cite-prejudicial argument). Further, counsel for\n\nboth Circle Ridge and Kevin Stephens argued that the burden of proof\n\nwas on Great Northern to establish that Dean Searle had not properly\n\nconducted the November 5, 2012, foreclosure sale. (CT 125_; RR\n\n5:14:23-18:3, 5:28:10-29:16). Among other arguments, both counsel\n\nrecited that Kevin Stephens had given Circle Ridge the authorization to\n\nforeclose, insofar as the Kevin Stephens ownership interest in the note\n\nmade payable to “Circle Ridge Production, Inc., and Kevin Stephens”\n\nwas concerned (RR5:14:23-18:3).\n\nAt no time, were Appellants allowed to argue before the jury that Kevin\n\nStephens had sold, assigned, and transferred his interest in the note\n\nprevious to the foreclosure sale to Great Northern, that Bill Briscoe had\n\nprior notice of that assignment, or that Dean Searle acted without the\n\nauthority of anyone but Circle Ridge Production, Inc., in conducting the\n\nforeclosure sale on November 5, 2012, because he did not have authority\n\nfrom any other legal interest owner in the note on November 5, 2012.\n\n(see Section II, above).\n\n\n                           Page 73 of 93\n\f   Finally, counsel for Kevin Stephens argued that the value of the\n\nleasehold interest was much less than experts (whose testimony was also\n\nexcluded) regarding the value of the interest foreclosed on versus the\n\npurchase consideration established at the foreclosure sale of $150,000.00\n\n(RR 5:098:15-105:13, 108:23-1218). Here, the adverse effect of Josh\n\nManess’s improper injection of evidence into voir dire, through his\n\nquestioning of venireman Williams becomes important because Mr.\n\nWilliams was selected as a juror, and Maness had represented that he\n\ncould use his prior experience as “common sense.” (RR 2:124:13-126:24\n\nand 2:128:10-129:24). Thus Maness injected an improper basis for the\n\njury to use in evaluating the testimony in this case in deliberations. The\n\nharm is manifest.\n\n                        VIII.- Cumulative Error\n\nThe Court erred in all respects in this trial and its denial that a new\ntrial should be granted herein and all matters re-tried. This case\nshould be reversed and remanded for an entire new trial, because the\ncumulative error of the Court was so great that that is the sole\nremedy can effectively address the errors in the prior trial.\n\nFew cases present a sufficient number and quality of errors to justify the\n\nreversal of the trial court’s judgment because of cumulative errors.\n\nHowever, Texas courts recognize that when all the errors are considered\n\ntogether, in light of the whole record, an appellate court may find that the\n\n\n                           Page 74 of 93\n\faccumulation of those errors was reasonably calculated to and probably\n\ndid cause the rendition of an improper judgment, requiring a reversal of\n\nthe trial court’s judgment.

However, as Appellants’ attorney asserted in his reply and opposition\n\n(CT 1330-1337), the Court was incorrect in awarding any attorneys fees, or,\n\nalternatively, awarding the sum of $150,873.37 for the following reasons:\n\n      IX-1. Appellant completely failed to sustain its burden of proof on any basis\n\nauthorizing the award of attorneys fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                      Page 76 of 93\n\fAll of the arguments by Circle Ridge in support of its Motion for Attorneys’\n\nFees are founded and based upon the legal position that it is authorized and\n\nempowered to attempt collection and enforcement efforts because of its\n\nattempts to collect, foreclose, etc. in behalf of the interest of Circle Ridge\n\nproduction under the note of September 11, 2012, in the principal amount of\n\n$700,000.00.(the “$700K note”); however, as was extensively argued during\n\nthe trial, any such collection attempts were, and are, wholly unauthorized\n\nand illegal. Under §§3.201, 3.203, et seq., Tex. Bus. & Com. Code (2013),\n\nany attempt to enforce or collect the note without the joinder of both parties,\n\ni.e.¸ both Circle Ridge and Great Northern (the then legal owner and holder\n\nof the rights formerly owned by Kevin Stephens) were wholly improper.\n\nSee, Comment 5 to §3.203, and Commentary, “No Partial Negotiation or\n\nTransfer” and “Distinction between right to enforce instrument and\n\nownership of instrument,” Anderson, Bartlett & East’s Texas Uniform\n\nCommercial Code Annotated (2007 Edition-West Publishing). At the time\n\nthe demands attached to Plaintiffs’ MfAF were prepared and served, the\n\nrecord owners and holders of the note were Circle Ridge Production, Inc.\n\nand Great Northern Energy, Inc., and Dean Searle, acting as agent for Circle\n\nRidge Production, was not authorized to so act for the holders thereof. Thus\n\nhis actions were completely improper, not properly submitted, nor properly\n\n\n                               Page 77 of 93\n\fconducted, and thus cannot form the basis for the award of any attorneys’\n\nfees herein, nor can any award be made to any attorney representing only\n\nCircle Ridge herein because such action seeks to enforce only the interest of\n\nCircle Ridge in the note.\n\n      IX-2. Similarly, any efforts to collect attorneys fees for violations of\n\nany of the provisions of, or pursuant to the terms of the Deed of Trust dated\n\nSeptember 11, 2012, are improper, and must fail because Appellee has\n\nnever properly conducted or attempted any proper enforcement of the Deed\n\nof Trust, because it has always acted alone and never jointly with the\n\nremaining interest owner “Great Northern Energy, Incorporated, as\n\nsuccessor to Kevin Stephens, in the Deed of Trust in which the originally\n\ndesignated Beneficiaries or “Beneficiary” were “Circle Ridge Production,\n\nInc. and Kevin Stephens”.

Block billing may not support the\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees. As the Plaintiff argues, this case involved not\n\nonly trespass to try title, breach of contract, wrongful foreclosure, forgery,\n\nlack of sufficient acknowledgement in suit to quiet title.\n\n1. The Affidavit of Ronan Searle in behalf of Searle and Searle is legally\n\n   insufficient to support the award of attorneys’ fees. Specifically, the\n\n   affidavit of Ronan Searle incorporates the “contemporaneous billing\n\n   records of the firm Searle and Searle. There is no independent Affidavit\n\n   of Dean Searle, who apparently performed many of the services for\n\n   which billing is attributable by virtue of the initials “DS” on many of the\n\n   billing records in Appendix “A”, stating that such services were\n\n   reasonable and necessary. Further, Ronan Searle, also a member of the\n\n   firm performed services; however, no segregation of services performed\n\n   by either Ronan or Dean Searle is specified, either in the Affidavit of\n\n   Ronan Searle, or in any portion of Appendix A.(CR1330-1337).\n\n   Among insufficiencies frowned upon in establishing the basis for\n\n   attorneys’ fees recovery are unnecessary duplication of billing for\n\n\n                               Page 79 of 93\n\f  services by partners or associates. Here, Plaintiff specifies in its MFAF\n\n  that “(a) as shown on Appendix, two separate law firms had to be hired\n\n  by Plaintiff in order to take this case through trial.” (CR1330-1337). The\n\n  billing submitted in both Appendices “A” and “B” (CR1268, 1278-1301),\n\n  is so insufficient that it is impossible to determine what duplication\n\n  occurred. Courts do not and should not award attorneys” fees for hours\n\n  spent in duplicative activity or spent in a passive role of an observer\n\n  while other attorneys perform, and are generally not recoverable.\n\n  Chaves, Douglas E., “Attorney’s Fees Update, 36th State Bar of Tex.\n\n  Prof. Dev. Program, 36th Annual Advanced Civil Trial Course Chap. 26,\n\n  p 9 (2013 ). Neither can any such segregation be made based on the\n\n  Affidavit of Michael Runyan submitted. Neither is there any evidence\n\n  that any “billing judgment” has been exercised in this case, which\n\n  omission is also a serious flaw in applications for payment of attorneys’\n\n  fees.\n\n\n\n2. The time records submitted in Appendices A & B (CR1278-1301) are\n\n  further insufficient insofar as they fail to specify which issues or claims\n\n  apply to any distinct issues. Issues relating to Plaintiffs “forgery” claims\n\n  were never submitted, and further, Plaintiff nonsuited its claims relating\n\n\n                              Page 80 of 93\n\fto recovery for alleged violations by the individual Defendants Loftis and\n\nAbercrombie for Plaintiff’s originally plead claims of “negligence,”\n\n“civil conspiracy” and violation of the “Texas Civil Theft Liability Act”-\n\nthus legally abandoning such claims against all Defendants.\n\nNevertheless, Plaintiff’s claims for recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs\n\nclearly include claims for service time and costs attributable to “forgery”\n\nissues-specifically, as marked on Exhibit “4” to this Response (see page\n\n4, “telephone conference with handwriting expert”, (CR1281),p.5,\n\n“preparing documentation to expert”(CR1282), p,.7, $900 paid to\n\nhandwriting expert,(CR1299). Clearly there is no recovery for such\n\nclaims, and in fact, no proper basis for any recovery exists because of the\n\nviolations of the requirements of §§3.201 and 3.203, Tex.Bus.& Com.\n\nCode (2013), as specified above in Response #1. Again, any claims of\n\nadmission of liability with respect to any performance, either payment of\n\nsums due or any other obligation contained in the Deed of Trust, are\n\nexpressly denied by all Defendants, as any admission of any liability\n\nwhatsoever, is specifically conditioned on the language contained in the\n\nstipulation “in the event Defendant Great Northern Energy in did not own\n\nthe interests of Kevin Stephens in the $700K note.” Any such stipulation\n\n\n\n\n                           Page 81 of 93\n\f        is conditional only.

In\n\nthis case, the Court should disregard all the jury findings and sign a judgment in\n\nfavor of Great Northern Energy, Inc. because no evidence was introduced by\n\nCircle Ridge to establish that the proper party authorized, noticed, or conducted\n\nthe foreclosure sale in controversy on November 5, 2013. In fact, the only\n\nevidence that both “X and Y” participated in or noticed or conducted the\n\nforeclosure was the testimony of Bill Briscoe, President of Circle Ridge\n\n\n                                   Page 82 of 93\n\fProduction, that he got Kevin Stephen’s permission to foreclose before he\n\ninitiated the foreclosure proceedings in Circle Ridge’s name. However, that\n\ntestimony, even as taken to be wholly true and accurate in inadequate to meet the\n\nburden of proof demanded of Circle Ridge. Specifically that testimony is\n\ncontradicted by Stephen’s admission against interest (offered in the Bill of\n\nExceptions) that he had sold his interest in the $700K note to Great Northern\n\nEnergy before January 1, 2013, and this foreclosure did not occur until\n\nNovember 5, 2013. Further, the relevant foreclosure or note collection procedures\n\nwere not commenced by Circle Ridge until after February 1, 2013. Thus, Kevin\n\nStephens did not have any authority to “authorize” any foreclosure proceedings\n\nor to transfer any interest in and to the $700K note or Deed of Trust lien after\n\nDecember, 2012. Clearly, no proper entity ever authorized Circle Ridge to\n\nproceed with any foreclosure or collection procedures of any kind or character.\n\nBecause there is no evidence that any foreclosure was properly conducted, Great\n\nNorthern is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\n\n\n                                      XI.\n\n\n        Great Northern is entitled to judgment that Circle Ridge take\n        nothing, with respect to its claims for Trespass to Try Title, because\n        there is no sufficient legal evidence which supports such\n        determination.\n\n    An action in trespass to try title is a suit to recover the possession of land\n\n                                    Page 83 of 93\n\funlawfully withheld from an owner who has a right to immediate possession\n\nStandard Oil Co. of Tex.

First, in its petition, it has cited additional parties owning interests (an\n\nadmission against interest. (CR1066-1126). Further, it introduced into evidence\n\n\n                                        Page 85 of 93\n\fitself, Circle Ridge claimed and attempts to claim through the judgment entered\n\nherein ownership of 100% of the working interest in and to the OBENCO Leases\n\n(CT:1068,1069,1497-1508). However, Circle Ridge itself introduced evidence of\n\noutstanding ownership in third parties, to-wit: Wayne Johnson, WJ South Waskom\n\n(RR:4:104:4-105:7), (Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 13). Further, it is clear that this\n\nassignment, effective from its date of assignment by Great Northern, pre-dates the\n\ndate of the granting of the Deed of Trust and it is not foreclosed by any apparent\n\nforeclosure of the Deed of Trust and is contrary to Circle Ridges claims of 100%\n\nownership. And therefore is not foreclosed under the Deed of Trust. (RR:3:210:3-\n\n213:25). Thus, the lien interest of the United States, as evidenced by pleading of\n\nthe United States, (CR:1649) and the identification of these lien hold interests by\n\nCircle Ridge in its Fifth Amended Petition prevent Circle Ridge from owning title.\n\nFurther, there was no evidence introduced by Circle Ridge in trial to evidence the\n\nfact that it had properly excluded any Internal Revenue Service tax liens upon the\n\nproperty as required by 26 U.S.C.§7425(b)(1)(c)(1)(Internal Revenue Code).\n\nSimply stated, the record is filled with claims of title besides that of Circle Ridge,\n\npursuant to Circle Ridge’s own proof. As stated, the Plaintiff in an action in\n\ntrespass to try title must recover, if at all, on strength of his or her own title and\n\nmay not rely on the weakness of the defendant’s title see Reinhardt v North, 507\n\nS.W. 2d 589,591, (Civ. App. –Waco 1974, ref. n.r.e). Gray v Joyce, 485 S.W. 2d\n\n\n                                       Page 86 of 93\n\f311, 313 (Civ. App. –Tyler 1972, ref. n.r.e.).\n\n   In its Trespass to Try Title action, Circle Ridge Production sought confirmation\n\n of its ownership, and rights to possession of an undivided 100% leasehold or\n\n working interest in and to the OBENCO leases. Insofar as Circle Ridge claims\n\n entitlement to a judgment of ownership of one hundred percent of the working\n\n interest in and to the OBENCO leases, (described in Exhibit “A: attached thereto)\n\n it failed to establish its claims “against all of the world” in the lawsuit. In fact, it\n\n plead there were outstanding liens in favor of Topcat Well Service and the\n\n Internal Revenue Service,(CR 1068, 1069-1072). Further, it itemized outstanding\n\n working interest ownership of forty-two percent (42%) in WJ South\n\n Waskom,(CR 1070-71, and RR:4:104:4-105:7, CRP Ex. 13), and introduced\n\n evidence of that outstanding interest; however, it never introduced any evidence\n\n of resolution of that claim lien as required by 26 USC, Section 7425(b)(1) and\n\n (c)(1). In the event Circle Ridge attempts to claim that it can rely on the so-called\n\n Abstract of Title which it filed only one week before trial, that document is not\n\n timely filed. Additionally, Defendants did not demand that Plaintiff Circle Ridge\n\n file any abstract pursuant to Rule 791, et seq., Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n Clearly, as a matter of law, Plaintiff has failed to meet the required burden of\n\n proof to establish its title against all other claims. Therefore, Circle Ridge\n\n Production failed to establish its claims to the extent that it is entitled to a\n\n\n                                       Page 87 of 93\n\fjudgement granting it an undivided one hundred percent title to the working\n\ninterest in and to the OBENCO leases, even assuming arguendo¸ that it\n\nestablished that its foreclosure sale on November 5, 2013 was legal. Of course,\n\nas set forth in paragraphs 2-19, that sale was not legal. Further, neither the\n\nAbstract, nor any instrument designated within it were introduced into evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                  Page 88 of 93\n\f                                      PRAYER\n\n      Appellants pray that the court reverse the trial court and render judgment in\n\nfavor of Appellants that Appellant Great Northern Energy take nothing by virtue\n\nof its claims with respect to any liability on the part of Appellees with respect to\n\nany sums allegedly owed under the September 11, 2012 note, that its claims of\n\ntitle under its Trespass to Try Title action be set aside and denied in all things, and\n\nthat it reverse the trial court’s rulings insofar as it denied Great Northern Energy\n\nthe opportunity for a new trial with regard to Great Northern Energy’s claims of\n\nwrongful foreclosure, interference with contractual relations and breach of the\n\nCovenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing and Breach of Contractual obligations\n\nwith respect to the equipment sales from Kevin Stephens to Great Northern\n\nEnergy, and that it reverse the Courts award of attorney’s fees in favor of Circle\n\nRidge Production as against Great Northern Energy.\n\n      Alternatively, Great Northern Energy request that all matters tried before the\n\ntrial court be reversed and set aside, and that a new trial be ordered on all matters\n\npled in Circle Ridge Productions 5th Amended Original Petition and Great\n\nNorthern Energy’s 3rd Amended Original Answer and Counter-Claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n                                        /s/William J.
