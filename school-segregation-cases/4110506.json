JULES,\n\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         Defendant Bridgette St. Jules appeals from an order redesignating her felony\nburglary offense as a misdemeanor under Penal Code section 1170.18.1 She contends\nthat the trial court erred in requiring her to follow the petitioning procedures of\nsection 1170.18 to obtain resentencing. Instead, she argues, the court should have simply\nrecharacterized her offense under Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct (the Act)2 without the necessity of her filing a petition. Defendant further asserts\nerror in the court’s failure to resentence her after it redesignated the burglary as a\nmisdemeanor. We agree with defendant’s second point and must therefore reverse for\nthat reason alone.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n         2\n        Section 1170.18, part of the “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,” was enacted\nby the voters on November 4, 2014 in passing Proposition 47. (Proposition 47, as\napproved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014).\n\f                                        Background\n        On July 17, 2012, defendant pleaded no contest to second degree burglary as part\nof a negotiated disposition (§§459; 460, subd. (b)). In exchange, she was promised no\nprison time, and an additional charge, petty theft with three or more prior convictions of\nburglary (§ 666, subd. (a)), was dismissed. The court suspended imposition of sentence\nand imposed three years’ formal probation, conditioned on service of 90 days in county\njail.\n        On April 10, 2014, probation was revoked. According to the probation officer,\ndefendant had failed to comply with several conditions of probation, including those\nrequiring substance abuse treatment and testing. In addition, by her own admission, she\nhad ingested cocaine the previous month.\n        On November 5, 2014, section 1170.18 became effective following the passage of\nProposition 47 by the voters the previous day. Proposition 47 reclassified certain drug\nand theft-related offenses as misdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony\nmisdemeanors. It also set forth procedures for defendants seeking to have a felony\nconviction resentenced or designated as a misdemeanor.\n        On November 20, 2014, defendant filed an “Application for Misdemeanor\nDesignation/Petition for Resentencing.” Defendant alleged that she had suffered no\ndisqualifying convictions and that she was “still serving a sentence” on the burglary\nconviction. Defendant’s attorney also filed written argument asserting that the\npetitioning procedures of section 1170.18, subdivision (a), were inapplicable to\nprobationers because they were not “currently serving a sentence” within the meaning of\nthe statute; rather, they were entitled “by operation of law” to retroactive application of\nProposition 47 to resentencing without the necessity of a petition.\n        A hearing took place five days later, at which defendant admitted violating\nprobation. The court reinstated probation and continued the matter for resolution of the\nProposition 47 petition.\n\n                                                2\n\f       At the continued hearing on December 19, 2014, the parties and the court\ndiscussed “what it means to be currently serving a sentence under . . . [section 1170.18],”\nas applied to several defendants then before the court. Defense counsel argued that only\nthose who have had “actual pronouncement of judgment” can be said to be “currently\nserving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18. Defense counsel argued that\nthere had to be an entry of final judgment for the filing of a petition to be required; by\ncontrast, an order granting probation with imposition or execution of sentence suspended\nwas not a “final judgment of conviction.” The probationer therefore should not be\nviewed as “currently serving a sentence” and should be entitled automatically to a\nreduced sentence without the necessity of a petition. The People maintained, however,\nthat probation, as commonly understood, should be viewed as a sentence and thus was\nsubject to the petitioning procedures set forth in section 1170.18.\n       The trial court rejected the argument that a probationer should benefit from the\nredesignation by operation of law without being required to submit to the procedures set\nforth in section 1170.18. On December 23, 2014, and again in a January 20, 2015\namended order, the court ruled that “[n]othing in the express language of Proposition 47\nsuggests it should be applied only to persons who are denied probation and formally\nsentenced, or only to those granted probation whose sentence is imposed but execution\nsuspended. Instead, the expressed statutory intent strongly indicates [that] the provisions\nof section 1170.18(a) apply to all persons ‘sentenced’ as that term is commonly and\ncolloquially understood—and as any voter would likely understand this term.” The\ndefense view was “contrary to the voters’ intent and overly restrictive, and inconsistent\nwith the rule of lenity.” Accordingly, the court concluded, “in order for these defendants\nto now receive the benefits of Proposition 47, they must proceed by petition for recall of\nsentence under section 1170.18(a) and be subject to the requirements of subdivision (b).”\nThe court limited its ruling to those probationers for whom imposition of sentence was\nsuspended.\n\n                                                3\n\f       On January 21, 2015, the court granted defendant’s petition, redesignating the\nburglary as a misdemeanor but retaining her revoked probation status. Defendant then\nfiled this timely appeal and obtained a certificate of probable cause.\n                                         Discussion\n1. Applicability of Petitioning Procedure in Section 1170.18, subd. (a)\n       As noted earlier, Proposition 47 included a provision reclassifying certain drug\nand theft-related offenses as misdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony\nmisdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a); People v. Shabazz (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303,\n308.) As relevant to theft-related offenses, subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 states:\n“A person currently serving a sentence for a conviction . . . of a felony . . . who would\nhave been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (‘this act’) had\nthis act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence\nbefore the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request\nresentencing in accordance with . . . Section 459.5 [shoplifting], 473 [forgery], 476a\n[passing a bad check], 490.2 [petty theft], 496 [receiving stolen property], or 666 [petty\ntheft with theft prior] . . . as those sections have been amended or added by this act.”\n       The procedure set forth in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), applies to a defendant\nwho is “currently serving a sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been\nguilty of a misdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the\noffense. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) Such a defendant may petition for a recall\nof his or her sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the amended statute\nthat reclassified the defendant’s offense as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) If the petitioner meets\nthe statutory criteria, “the petitioner’s felony sentence shall be recalled and the petitioner\nresentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Id., subd. (b).)\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       On appeal, defendant contends that she should not have been required to follow\nthe procedure set forth in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), by petitioning for a recall of\nsentence because, as a probationer whose imposition of sentence was suspended, she was\nnot “currently serving a sentence” within the meaning of subdivision (a). Instead, she\nargues, the trial court was required to apply retroactively the Act’s reclassification of her\nfelony offense as a misdemeanor and automatically designate her felony conviction a\nmisdemeanor.\n       “No part of [the Penal Code] is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” (§ 3.)\nSection 3 “provides the default rule” regarding retroactivity, “codifying ‘the\ntime-honored principle . . . that in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a\nstatute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that\nthe Legislature [or electorate] . . . must have intended a retroactive application.’\n[Citations.]” (People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319 (Brown).)\n       A “qualification” to the prospective-only presumption regarding statutory\namendments was evident in In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 (Estrada). (Brown,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 323.) “When the Legislature [or electorate] has amended a statute\nto reduce the punishment for a particular criminal offense, we will assume, absent\nevidence to the contrary, that the Legislature [or electorate] intended the amended statute\nto apply to all defendants whose judgments are not yet final on the statute’s operative\ndate. [Citation.]” (Ibid., fn. omitted.) As the Estrada court explained: “When the\nLegislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment[,] it has obviously expressly\ndetermined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper\nas punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that\nthe Legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty\nnow deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it constitutionally could\napply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be applied\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fconstitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment convicting\nthe defendant of the act is not final.” (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       In In re May (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 165 (May), the appellate court addressed the\napplication of Estrada and the issue of when a judgment is final for a defendant placed\non probation. In May, the “proceedings in the case were suspended and [the defendant]\nwas placed on probation” for a drug offense. (Id. at p. 167.) A statutory amendment\nsubsequently reduced the offense from a felony to a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) In the\ndefendant’s case, however, the trial court continued to treat the offense as a felony when\nthe defendant was later found in violation of probation. (Id. at pp. 167-168.) The\nappellate court determined that, “[s]ince the proceedings were suspended, no final\njudgment was entered for the purposes of this case. [Citations.] Thus, the rationale of\nEstrada applie[d] to this case because the amendatory statute became effective after the\ncommission of the act but before the judgment of conviction was final.” (Id. at p. 169.)\nThe appellate court therefore concluded that the defendant’s offense should be designated\nand treated as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.)\n       “The rule in Estrada, of course, is not implicated where the Legislature clearly\nsignals its intent to make the amendment prospective, by the inclusion of either an\nexpress saving clause or its equivalent.” (People v. Nasalga (1996) 12 Cal.4th 784, 793,\nfn. omitted (Nasalga) (plur. opn. of Werdegar, J.); see Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747\n[“where there is an express or implied saving clause,” the prior statute “should continue\nto operate as to past acts”].) If there is no express saving clause, one will be implied if\nthe Legislature or electorate has “demonstrate[d] its intention with sufficient clarity that a\nreviewing court can discern and effectuate it.” (In re Pedro T. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1041,\n1049 (Pedro T.).)\n       For example, the “functional equivalent of a saving clause” was included in\nProposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act) (Prop. 36, as\napproved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012). (People v. Yearwood (2013) 213\n\n                                                6\n\fCal.App.4th 161, 172 (Yearwood).) The Reform Act “change[d] the requirements for\nsentencing a third strike offender” by authorizing life sentences only in certain cases.\n(Yearwood, supra, at p. 167.) The Reform Act also enacted a new statute,\nsection 1170.126, which “created a postconviction release proceeding whereby [an\neligible] prisoner . . . may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second\nstrike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety. [Citation.]” (Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.)\n       The Yearwood defendant was sentenced as a third strike offender prior to the\nReform Act. (Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167.) Had he been sentenced after\nthe Reform Act, he would not have been sentenced to an indeterminate life term.\n(Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.) The appellate court considered whether it could issue an\norder that he be resentenced, or whether his remedy was “limited to filing a petition for a\nrecall of his sentence in compliance with section 1170.126.” (Ibid.)\n       The Yearwood defendant argued that the Reform Act should apply retroactively,\nbased on Estrada, because the Reform Act reduced the punishment for his offense. The\nYearwood court disagreed, finding that “[t]he Estrada rule does not apply to the [Reform]\nAct because section 1170.126 operates as the functional equivalent of a saving clause.”\n(Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 172.) The court examined the language of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (b), which provides, “Any person serving an indeterminate\nterm of life imprisonment” imposed for a third strike conviction “may file a petition for a\nrecall of sentence.” The court found this phrase was “not ambiguous” and that\nsection 1170.126 “is correctly interpreted to apply to all prisoners serving an\nindeterminate life sentence imposed under the former three strikes law.” (Yearwood,\nsupra, at p. 175.)\n       Defendant contends that, as a probationer whose imposition of sentence had been\nsuspended, she was entitled to “automatically receive the benefit of ameliorative changes\nin the law” which were created by legislation passed after the grant of probation. She\n\n                                                7\n\fmaintains that because “the court had not pronounced a judgment of conviction . . . there\nwas nothing to prevent the court . . . from merely correcting its records ‘to show\npetitioner’s conviction therein as a misdemeanor.’ (See May, supra, 62 Cal.App.3d at p.\n169.”\n        The question of whether retroactive application of Proposition 47’s reduced\npenalty provisions is required under Estrada requires a determination of the intent of the\nelectorate (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 744), which may be signaled by the inclusion\nof “either an express saving clause or its equivalent” (Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at\np. 793; see Estrada, supra, at p. 747). Here, defendant argues that there is no saving\nclause, express or implicit, that prevents the benefits of Proposition 47 from applying to\nprobationers like her. Because she cannot be said either to be “currently serving a\nsentence for a conviction” or to have “completed . . . her sentence for a conviction,”\n(§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (f)), the electorate cannot be said to have manifested an intent that\nprobationers not benefit from the law “or that their benefits should be subject to the\nprocedures in section 1170.18.”\n        We determine that although Proposition 47 does not have an express saving\nclause, it did create section 1170.18, which is functionally equivalent to a saving clause.\n(See Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 793; Pedro T., supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 1049; Estrada,\nsupra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747.) In enacting Proposition 47, the electorate drew distinctions\nbetween three categories of defendants: those who had not yet been sentenced, those\nwho were “currently serving” sentences (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), and those who had\ncompleted their sentences (id., subd. (f))—and it provided procedures for those latter two\ncategories of defendants who sought to benefit from the ameliorative provisions provided\nby Proposition 47. In particular, under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a defendant who\nis “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” may petition for a recall of sentence and\nresentencing. Like the resentencing petition process created by the Reform Act, the\nresentencing petition process contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), expressly\n\n                                                8\n\fapplies to defendants who are “currently serving a sentence” for a crime that would have\nbeen a misdemeanor after the passage of Proposition 47. (Cf. § 1170.126, subd. (b);\ncf. Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 173.) By setting forth a specific procedure\nfor those defendants who were “currently serving a sentence” at the time the initiative\ntook effect (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), the electorate effectively “demonstrate[d] its intention”\nthat such defendants follow those procedures set forth in section 1170.18 before being\nresentenced (Pedro T., supra, at p. 1049).3\n       We therefore turn to the question of whether defendant is “currently serving a\nsentence” (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), such that the recall and resentencing procedure set forth\nin section 1170.18 applies to her. (See, e.g., id., subds. (a)-(d).)\n       “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, [1] “we turn first to the language of the statute,\ngiving the words their ordinary meaning.” [Citation.] [2] The statutory language must\nalso be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme\n[in light of the electorate’s intent]. [Citation.] [3] When the language is ambiguous,\n“we refer to other indicia of the voters’ intent, particularly the analyses and arguments\ncontained in the official ballot pamphlet.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.] [¶] In other words,\nour ‘task is simply to interpret and apply the initiative’s language so as to effectuate the\nelectorate’s intent.’ [Citation.]” (Robert L. v. Superior Court (2003) 30 Cal.4th 894,\n900-901.)\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          In People v. Davis (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 127 (Davis), petition for review\npending, petition filed May 6, 2016, S234324, the appellate court similarly concluded\nthat, for defendants who were currently serving a sentence or who had completed a\nsentence for a felony covered by Proposition 47, “the electorate made clear its intent as to\nthe nature and extent of the retroactive application of the amendments. For those\npersons, there is no need, and no place, for inferences about retroactive application, and\ntherefore no basis for invoking Estrada.” (Davis, supra, at p. 137.)\n\n                                                 9\n\f       In People v. Garcia (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 555 (Garcia), we determined that the\nphrase “currently serving a sentence” in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), “appl[ies] to all\nthose with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who otherwise meet\nthe conditions specified in the statutory scheme.” (Garcia, supra, at p. 559.) In Garcia,\nas in the instant case, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed the\ndefendant on probation for felony possession of a controlled substance (former Health &\nSaf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)). (Garcia, supra, at p. 557.) The People conceded, and we\nagreed, that the electorate intended to include felony probation as a sentence subject to\nthe petition provisions of section 1170.18. We observed that “there is nothing in either\nthe ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to limit the phrase ‘currently\nserving a sentence for a conviction’ to those serving a term of imprisonment.” (Garcia,\nsupra, at p. 558.) Moreover, “granting probation is in some contexts a ‘sentencing\nchoice’ (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.405(6) [‘ “Sentence choice” means the\nselection of any disposition of the case that does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or\ngrant of a new trial.’]). (Cf. People v. Howard (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1081, 1084 [referring to\ncourt’s authority ‘at time of sentencing’ either to suspend imposition of sentence or\nimpose sentence and suspend its execution]; In re DeLong (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 562,\n571 [‘an order granting probation and suspending imposition of sentence is a form of\nsentencing’].)” (Ibid.) Indeed, “the language of another voter initiative, Proposition 36,\nthe Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000, used the language ‘sentenced to\nprobation.’ (See People v. Mendoza (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1034 [quoting ballot\npamphlet to distinguish conviction from sentence and referring to ‘sentence of\nprobation’].)” (Ibid.)\n       We explained in Garcia that “[t]he ballot materials for Proposition 47 likewise\nindicate that the voters regarded probation as one of the options within a sentencing\nprocedure; the legislative analysis refers to offenders who are ‘sentenced’ to supervision\nby a county probation officer while indicating that both jail time for eligible offenders\n\n                                               10\n\fand the caseloads of probation officers would be reduced by including felony probation\nas a disposition eligible for resentencing under section 1170.18. (See People v. Shabazz\n(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303, 310 [discussing Prop. 47 mechanism for resentencing after\nbeing ‘sentenced or placed on probation’].) The Legislative Analyst discussed these\noptions under the heading of ‘Misdemeanor Sentencing’ and generally noted the fiscal\nconsequences of ‘the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies\nthat are changed to misdemeanors.’ (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative,\nthe legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\nprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a ‘felony sentence’ and\nallows the petitioner to request ‘resentencing’ in Health and Safety Code section 11377\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) . . . Proposition 47 was intended to reach those with\n‘nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,’ which would encompass many\nwho were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide, supra, text of Prop. 47, § 3,\np. 70.) To deprive those defendants of the benefit of the reduced penalty for their\noffenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either anticipated or\napproved.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, fns. omitted.)\n       Defendant fails to convince us that Garcia is distinguishable or that it should not\nbe followed.4 We accordingly conclude that defendant was “currently serving a\nsentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a) at the time she was on\nprobation. It was therefore proper for the court to accept defendant’s petition for\nresentencing.\n\n\n       4\n         In Davis, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th 127, the appellate court similarly concluded\nthat probationers fall within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n\n                                                11\n\f2. Failure to Resentence Defendant\n       As noted earlier, in granting defendant’s petition the trial court redesignated the\nburglary count as a misdemeanor. It did not resentence her, however, but only stated, “In\nthis matter then, probation remains revoked. Count 1 redesignated as a misdemeanor.\nThank you.” The clerk’s minutes likewise reflect only the redesignation of count 1under\nProposition 47 without further action.5 Defendant contends that the court was obligated\nto “reinstate probation, discharge probation, or sentence [defendant] on the\nmisdemeanor.” The People respond that defendant forfeited the argument. They further\nattempt to distinguish People v. Sem (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1192-1193 (Sem), on\nwhich defendant relies. Neither of the People’s points is well taken. The court was not\nauthorized to order a term in which defendant’s probation was revoked for an indefinite\nperiod. Section 1170.18, subdivision (b), itself directs the court, upon determining that\nthe petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a), to resentence the petitioner in\naccordance with the specified statutes unless resentencing the petitioner “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety”—that is, “an unreasonable risk that the\npetitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\nsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” (§ 1170.18,\nsubds. (b), (c).) Here, as in Sem, supra, at p. 1192, the court “exercised none of its\nstatutory options,” whether by reinstating probation, modifying it, or terminating it\n\n\n       5\n          Neither party questions the court’s failure to designate the Penal Code section\nthat now applies to defendant’s offense. Neither even mentioned the statute that appeared\nto govern the offense under the new law. Proposition 47 does not permit a redesignation\nof a burglary to misdemeanor burglary. (People v. Chen (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 322,\n326.) If the circumstances fit, a second degree burglary may, under section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (b), be resentenced as shoplifting, a misdemeanor, under the newly created\nstatute, section 459.5. For purposes of this appeal only, we will assume that the court\nintended to redesignate defendant’s offense under section 459.5, as the record indicates\nthat the property she stole from Walmart amounted to less than $950. The court will\nhave the opportunity to clarify its intent upon remand.\n\n                                                 12\n\faltogether. In effect, then, like the trial court in Sem, the court “created a status of\nperpetual revocation,” even though that was evidently not its intent. (Ibid.) This\nincomplete disposition, however, can be remedied upon remand.\n                                          Disposition\n       The order of January 21, 2015 is reversed. Upon remand, the court shall specify\nthe misdemeanor defendant is now deemed to have committed and resentence her in\naccordance with section 1170.18, subdivisions (b)-(e).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                                  _________________________________\n                                  ELIA, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nRUSHING, P.

Instead, she argues, the court should have simply\nrecharacterized her offense under Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct (the Act)2 without the necessity of her filing a petition. Defendant further asserts\nerror in the court’s failure to resentence her after it redesignated the burglary as a\nmisdemeanor. We agree with defendant’s second point and must therefore reverse for\nthat reason alone.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n         2\n        Section 1170.18, part of the “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,” was enacted\nby the voters on November 4, 2014 in passing Proposition 47. (Proposition 47, as\napproved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014).\n\f                                        Background\n        On July 17, 2012, defendant pleaded no contest to second degree burglary as part\nof a negotiated disposition (§§459; 460, subd. (b)). In exchange, she was promised no\nprison time, and an additional charge, petty theft with three or more prior convictions of\nburglary (§ 666, subd. (a)), was dismissed. The court suspended imposition of sentence\nand imposed three years’ formal probation, conditioned on service of 90 days in county\njail.\n        On April 10, 2014, probation was revoked. According to the probation officer,\ndefendant had failed to comply with several conditions of probation, including those\nrequiring substance abuse treatment and testing. In addition, by her own admission, she\nhad ingested cocaine the previous month.\n        On November 5, 2014, section 1170.18 became effective following the passage of\nProposition 47 by the voters the previous day. Proposition 47 reclassified certain drug\nand theft-related offenses as misdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony\nmisdemeanors. It also set forth procedures for defendants seeking to have a felony\nconviction resentenced or designated as a misdemeanor.\n        On November 20, 2014, defendant filed an “Application for Misdemeanor\nDesignation/Petition for Resentencing.” Defendant alleged that she had suffered no\ndisqualifying convictions and that she was “still serving a sentence” on the burglary\nconviction. Defendant’s attorney also filed written argument asserting that the\npetitioning procedures of section 1170.18, subdivision (a), were inapplicable to\nprobationers because they were not “currently serving a sentence” within the meaning of\nthe statute; rather, they were entitled “by operation of law” to retroactive application of\nProposition 47 to resentencing without the necessity of a petition.\n        A hearing took place five days later, at which defendant admitted violating\nprobation. The court reinstated probation and continued the matter for resolution of the\nProposition 47 petition.\n\n                                                2\n\f       At the continued hearing on December 19, 2014, the parties and the court\ndiscussed “what it means to be currently serving a sentence under . . . [section 1170.18],”\nas applied to several defendants then before the court. Defense counsel argued that only\nthose who have had “actual pronouncement of judgment” can be said to be “currently\nserving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18. Defense counsel argued that\nthere had to be an entry of final judgment for the filing of a petition to be required; by\ncontrast, an order granting probation with imposition or execution of sentence suspended\nwas not a “final judgment of conviction.” The probationer therefore should not be\nviewed as “currently serving a sentence” and should be entitled automatically to a\nreduced sentence without the necessity of a petition. The People maintained, however,\nthat probation, as commonly understood, should be viewed as a sentence and thus was\nsubject to the petitioning procedures set forth in section 1170.18.\n       The trial court rejected the argument that a probationer should benefit from the\nredesignation by operation of law without being required to submit to the procedures set\nforth in section 1170.18. On December 23, 2014, and again in a January 20, 2015\namended order, the court ruled that “[n]othing in the express language of Proposition 47\nsuggests it should be applied only to persons who are denied probation and formally\nsentenced, or only to those granted probation whose sentence is imposed but execution\nsuspended. Instead, the expressed statutory intent strongly indicates [that] the provisions\nof section 1170.18(a) apply to all persons ‘sentenced’ as that term is commonly and\ncolloquially understood—and as any voter would likely understand this term.” The\ndefense view was “contrary to the voters’ intent and overly restrictive, and inconsistent\nwith the rule of lenity.” Accordingly, the court concluded, “in order for these defendants\nto now receive the benefits of Proposition 47, they must proceed by petition for recall of\nsentence under section 1170.18(a) and be subject to the requirements of subdivision (b).”\nThe court limited its ruling to those probationers for whom imposition of sentence was\nsuspended.\n\n                                                3\n\f       On January 21, 2015, the court granted defendant’s petition, redesignating the\nburglary as a misdemeanor but retaining her revoked probation status. Defendant then\nfiled this timely appeal and obtained a certificate of probable cause.\n                                         Discussion\n1. Applicability of Petitioning Procedure in Section 1170.18, subd. (a)\n       As noted earlier, Proposition 47 included a provision reclassifying certain drug\nand theft-related offenses as misdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony\nmisdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a); People v. Shabazz (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n308.) As relevant to theft-related offenses, subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 states:\n“A person currently serving a sentence for a conviction . . . of a felony . . . who would\nhave been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (‘this act’) had\nthis act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence\nbefore the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to request\nresentencing in accordance with . . . Section 459.5 [shoplifting], 473 [forgery], 476a\n[passing a bad check], 490.2 [petty theft], 496 [receiving stolen property], or 666 [petty\ntheft with theft prior] . . . as those sections have been amended or added by this act.”\n       The procedure set forth in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), applies to a defendant\nwho is “currently serving a sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been\nguilty of a misdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the\noffense. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) Such a defendant may petition for a recall\nof his or her sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the amended statute\nthat reclassified the defendant’s offense as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) If the petitioner meets\nthe statutory criteria, “the petitioner’s felony sentence shall be recalled and the petitioner\nresentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Id., subd. (b).)\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       On appeal, defendant contends that she should not have been required to follow\nthe procedure set forth in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), by petitioning for a recall of\nsentence because, as a probationer whose imposition of sentence was suspended, she was\nnot “currently serving a sentence” within the meaning of subdivision (a). Instead, she\nargues, the trial court was required to apply retroactively the Act’s reclassification of her\nfelony offense as a misdemeanor and automatically designate her felony conviction a\nmisdemeanor.\n       “No part of [the Penal Code] is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” (§ 3.)\nSection 3 “provides the default rule” regarding retroactivity, “codifying ‘the\ntime-honored principle . . . that in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a\nstatute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that\nthe Legislature [or electorate] . . . must have intended a retroactive application.’\n[Citations.]” (People v.

(Brown,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 323.) “When the Legislature [or electorate] has amended a statute\nto reduce the punishment for a particular criminal offense, we will assume, absent\nevidence to the contrary, that the Legislature [or electorate] intended the amended statute\nto apply to all defendants whose judgments are not yet final on the statute’s operative\ndate. [Citation.]” (Ibid., fn. omitted.) As the Estrada court explained: “When the\nLegislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment[,] it has obviously expressly\ndetermined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper\nas punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that\nthe Legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty\nnow deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it constitutionally could\napply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be applied\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fconstitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment convicting\nthe defendant of the act is not final.” (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       In In re May (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106564\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106564/in-re-may/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (May), the appellate court addressed the\napplication of Estrada and the issue of when a judgment is final for a defendant placed\non probation. In May, the “proceedings in the case were suspended and [the defendant]\nwas placed on probation” for a drug offense. (Id. at p. 167.) A statutory amendment\nsubsequently reduced the offense from a felony to a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) In the\ndefendant’s case, however, the trial court continued to treat the offense as a felony when\nthe defendant was later found in violation of probation. (Id. at pp. 167-168.) The\nappellate court determined that, “[s]ince the proceedings were suspended, no final\njudgment was entered for the purposes of this case. [Citations.] Thus, the rationale of\nEstrada applie[d] to this case because the amendatory statute became effective after the\ncommission of the act but before the judgment of conviction was final.” (Id. at p. 169.)\nThe appellate court therefore concluded that the defendant’s offense should be designated\nand treated as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.)\n       “The rule in Estrada, of course, is not implicated where the Legislature clearly\nsignals its intent to make the amendment prospective, by the inclusion of either an\nexpress saving clause or its equivalent.” (People v.

If there is no express saving clause, one will be implied if\nthe Legislature or electorate has “demonstrate[d] its intention with sufficient clarity that a\nreviewing court can discern and effectuate it.” (In re Pedro T.

Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012). (People v.

The Reform Act “change[d] the requirements for\nsentencing a third strike offender” by authorizing life sentences only in certain cases.\n(Yearwood, supra, at p. 167.) The Reform Act also enacted a new statute,\nsection 1170.126, which “created a postconviction release proceeding whereby [an\neligible] prisoner . . . may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second\nstrike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety. [Citation.]” (Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.)\n       The Yearwood defendant was sentenced as a third strike offender prior to the\nReform Act. (Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167.) Had he been sentenced after\nthe Reform Act, he would not have been sentenced to an indeterminate life term.\n(Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.) The appellate court considered whether it could issue an\norder that he be resentenced, or whether his remedy was “limited to filing a petition for a\nrecall of his sentence in compliance with section 1170.126.” (Ibid.)\n       The Yearwood defendant argued that the Reform Act should apply retroactively,\nbased on Estrada, because the Reform Act reduced the punishment for his offense. The\nYearwood court disagreed, finding that “[t]he Estrada rule does not apply to the [Reform]\nAct because section 1170.126 operates as the functional equivalent of a saving clause.”\n(Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 172.) The court examined the language of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (b), which provides, “Any person serving an indeterminate\nterm of life imprisonment” imposed for a third strike conviction “may file a petition for a\nrecall of sentence.” The court found this phrase was “not ambiguous” and that\nsection 1170.126 “is correctly interpreted to apply to all prisoners serving an\nindeterminate life sentence imposed under the former three strikes law.” (Yearwood,\nsupra, at p. 175.)\n       Defendant contends that, as a probationer whose imposition of sentence had been\nsuspended, she was entitled to “automatically receive the benefit of ameliorative changes\nin the law” which were created by legislation passed after the grant of probation. She\n\n                                                7\n\fmaintains that because “the court had not pronounced a judgment of conviction . . . there\nwas nothing to prevent the court . . . from merely correcting its records ‘to show\npetitioner’s conviction therein as a misdemeanor.’ (See May, supra, 62 Cal.App.3d at p.\n169.”\n        The question of whether retroactive application of Proposition 47’s reduced\npenalty provisions is required under Estrada requires a determination of the intent of the\nelectorate (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 744), which may be signaled by the inclusion\nof “either an express saving clause or its equivalent” (Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at\np. 793; see Estrada, supra, at p. 747). Here, defendant argues that there is no saving\nclause, express or implicit, that prevents the benefits of Proposition 47 from applying to\nprobationers like her. Because she cannot be said either to be “currently serving a\nsentence for a conviction” or to have “completed . . . her sentence for a conviction,”\n(§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (f)), the electorate cannot be said to have manifested an intent that\nprobationers not benefit from the law “or that their benefits should be subject to the\nprocedures in section 1170.18.”\n        We determine that although Proposition 47 does not have an express saving\nclause, it did create section 1170.18, which is functionally equivalent to a saving clause.\n(See Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 793; Pedro T., supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 1049; Estrada,\nsupra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747.) In enacting Proposition 47, the electorate drew distinctions\nbetween three categories of defendants: those who had not yet been sentenced, those\nwho were “currently serving” sentences (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), and those who had\ncompleted their sentences (id., subd. (f))—and it provided procedures for those latter two\ncategories of defendants who sought to benefit from the ameliorative provisions provided\nby Proposition 47. In particular, under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a defendant who\nis “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” may petition for a recall of sentence and\nresentencing. Like the resentencing petition process created by the Reform Act, the\nresentencing petition process contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), expressly\n\n                                                8\n\fapplies to defendants who are “currently serving a sentence” for a crime that would have\nbeen a misdemeanor after the passage of Proposition 47. (Cf. § 1170.126, subd. (b);\ncf. Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 173.) By setting forth a specific procedure\nfor those defendants who were “currently serving a sentence” at the time the initiative\ntook effect (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), the electorate effectively “demonstrate[d] its intention”\nthat such defendants follow those procedures set forth in section 1170.18 before being\nresentenced (Pedro T., supra, at p. 1049).3\n       We therefore turn to the question of whether defendant is “currently serving a\nsentence” (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), such that the recall and resentencing procedure set forth\nin section 1170.18 applies to her. (See, e.g., id., subds. (a)-(d).)\n       “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, [1] “we turn first to the language of the statute,\ngiving the words their ordinary meaning.” [Citation.] [2] The statutory language must\nalso be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme\n[in light of the electorate’s intent].

For those\npersons, there is no need, and no place, for inferences about retroactive application, and\ntherefore no basis for invoking Estrada.” (Davis, supra, at p. 137.)\n\n                                                 9\n\f       In People v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Garcia), we determined that the\nphrase “currently serving a sentence” in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), “appl[ies] to all\nthose with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who otherwise meet\nthe conditions specified in the statutory scheme.” (Garcia, supra, at p. 559.) In Garcia,\nas in the instant case, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed the\ndefendant on probation for felony possession of a controlled substance (former Health &\nSaf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)). (Garcia, supra, at p. 557.) The People conceded, and we\nagreed, that the electorate intended to include felony probation as a sentence subject to\nthe petition provisions of section 1170.18. We observed that “there is nothing in either\nthe ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to limit the phrase ‘currently\nserving a sentence for a conviction’ to those serving a term of imprisonment.” (Garcia,\nsupra, at p. 558.) Moreover, “granting probation is in some contexts a ‘sentencing\nchoice’ (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.405(6) [‘ “Sentence choice” means the\nselection of any disposition of the case that does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or\ngrant of a new trial.’]). (Cf. People v.

Indeed, “the language of another voter initiative, Proposition 36,\nthe Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000, used the language ‘sentenced to\nprobation.’ (See People v. Mendoza (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2261163\"><a href=\"/opinion/2261163/people-v-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(See People v. Shabazz\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 [discussing Prop. 47 mechanism for resentencing after\nbeing ‘sentenced or placed on probation’].) The Legislative Analyst discussed these\noptions under the heading of ‘Misdemeanor Sentencing’ and generally noted the fiscal\nconsequences of ‘the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies\nthat are changed to misdemeanors.’ (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative,\nthe legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\nprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a ‘felony sentence’ and\nallows the petitioner to request ‘resentencing’ in Health and Safety Code section 11377\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) . . . Proposition 47 was intended to reach those with\n‘nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,’ which would encompass many\nwho were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide, supra, text of Prop. 47, § 3,\np. 70.) To deprive those defendants of the benefit of the reduced penalty for their\noffenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either anticipated or\napproved.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, fns. omitted.)\n       Defendant fails to convince us that Garcia is distinguishable or that it should not\nbe followed.4 We accordingly conclude that defendant was “currently serving a\nsentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a) at the time she was on\nprobation. It was therefore proper for the court to accept defendant’s petition for\nresentencing.\n\n\n       4\n         In Davis, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the appellate court similarly concluded\nthat probationers fall within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n\n                                                11\n\f2. Failure to Resentence Defendant\n       As noted earlier, in granting defendant’s petition the trial court redesignated the\nburglary count as a misdemeanor. It did not resentence her, however, but only stated, “In\nthis matter then, probation remains revoked. Count 1 redesignated as a misdemeanor.\nThank you.” The clerk’s minutes likewise reflect only the redesignation of count 1under\nProposition 47 without further action.5 Defendant contends that the court was obligated\nto “reinstate probation, discharge probation, or sentence [defendant] on the\nmisdemeanor.” The People respond that defendant forfeited the argument. They further\nattempt to distinguish People v. Sem (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1192-1193 (Sem), on\nwhich defendant relies. Neither of the People’s points is well taken. The court was not\nauthorized to order a term in which defendant’s probation was revoked for an indefinite\nperiod. Section 1170.18, subdivision (b), itself directs the court, upon determining that\nthe petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a), to resentence the petitioner in\naccordance with the specified statutes unless resentencing the petitioner “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety”—that is, “an unreasonable risk that the\npetitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\nsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” (§ 1170.18,\nsubds. (b), (c).) Here, as in Sem, supra, at p. 1192, the court “exercised none of its\nstatutory options,” whether by reinstating probation, modifying it, or terminating it\n\n\n       5\n          Neither party questions the court’s failure to designate the Penal Code section\nthat now applies to defendant’s offense. Neither even mentioned the statute that appeared\nto govern the offense under the new law. Proposition 47 does not permit a redesignation\nof a burglary to misdemeanor burglary. (People v. Chen (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n326.) If the circumstances fit, a second degree burglary may, under section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (b), be resentenced as shoplifting, a misdemeanor, under the newly created\nstatute, section 459.5. For purposes of this appeal only, we will assume that the court\nintended to redesignate defendant’s offense under section 459.5, as the record indicates\nthat the property she stole from Walmart amounted to less than $950. The court will\nhave the opportunity to clarify its intent upon remand.\n\n                                                 12\n\faltogether. In effect, then, like the trial court in Sem, the court “created a status of\nperpetual revocation,” even though that was evidently not its intent. (Ibid.) This\nincomplete disposition, however, can be remedied upon remand.\n                                          Disposition\n       The order of January 21, 2015 is reversed. Upon remand, the court shall specify\nthe misdemeanor defendant is now deemed to have committed and resentence her in\naccordance with section 1170.18, subdivisions (b)-(e).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                                  _________________________________\n                                  ELIA, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nRUSHING, P.
