Introduction\n\n        On January 27, 2010, Philip and Barbara Tetlock (“petitioners”) filed a petition under the\nNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (“Vaccine Act” or “the Program”),2 42 U.S.C. §\n300aa-10 et seq. (2012), as the administrators of the estate of J.T., deceased. Petitioners alleged that\nas a result of receiving her third Human Papillomavirus (“HPV” or “Gardasil”) vaccine on March 1,\n2007, J.T. died on March 15, 2009. Petition at Preamble, ¶¶ 13, 14.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Because this decision contains a reasoned explanation for my action in this case, I intend to post\nthis ruling on the website of the United States Court of Federal Claims, in accordance with the E-\nGovernment Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. § 3501 note (2012)(Federal Management and Promotion of\nElectronic Government Services). As provided by Vaccine Rule 18(b), each party has 14 days\nwithin which to request redaction “of any information furnished by that party: (1) that is a trade\nsecret or commercial or financial in substance and is privileged or confidential; or (2) that includes\nmedical files or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted\ninvasion of privacy.” Vaccine Rule 18(b).\n2\n The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is set forth in Part 2 of the National\nChildhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3755, codified as amended,\n42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa-10 to -34 (2012). All citations in this decision to individual sections of the\nVaccine Act are to 42 U.S.C. § 300aa.\n\n                                                   1\n\f       As their theory of causation, petitioners specifically assert that the HPV vaccination J.T.\nreceived on March 1, 2007, caused her to develop acute disseminated encephalomyelitis\n(“ADEM”), which in turn triggered her development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”),\nwhich led to her eventual death on March 15, 2009. Respondent argued against awarding\ncompensation, stating that petitioners failed to provide preponderant evidence that J.T.’s ALS\nand/or her subsequent death were caused by the HPV vaccine. Respondent also argued that J.T.’s\ndeath was caused by the FUS P525L mutation.\n\n        Petitioners have faced great personal tragedy in the loss of their daughter, for which I extend\nmy deepest sympathy. However, after carefully analyzing and weighing all of the evidence and\ntestimony presented in this case in accordance with the applicable legal standards, I find that\npetitioners have not met their legal burden and are not entitled to compensation. Petitioners have\nfailed to provide preponderant evidence that the vaccination J.T. received on March 1, 2007, caused\nher ALS and subsequent death. Therefore, this case must be dismissed.\n\n   II.     Procedural History\n\n        Petitioners alleged that J.T. “suffered and died from the residual effects of the third and final\nseries of the Gardasil vaccination that she received on March 1, 2007.” Petition at ¶ 14. The\npetition further alleged that J.T. suffered from an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”)-like lower\nmotor neuron disease, caused by her vaccination. Id. at Preamble. Based on records subsequently\nfiled, petitioners thereafter revised their allegations and contended that J.T.’s March 1, 2007\nGardasil vaccination caused ADEM which “eventually triggered her ALS-like condition,” and that\nher death on March 15, 2009, was “due to respiratory failure resulting from her condition.” Pet.\nPrehearing Submission (“Sub.”) at 9, 12, 16. Respondent filed his Rule 4(c) Report on June 21,\n2010, recommending against compensation. Respondent’s Report (“Resp. Rept.”) dated Jun. 21,\n2010 (ECF No. 11) at 2.\n\n        On April 18, 2011, petitioners filed a case study involving J.T. indicating that a genetic\ndisorder caused her symptoms. Pet. Status Report (“Rep.”) dated Apr. 18, 2011 (ECF No. 20); Pet.\nEx. 9. On July 20, 2011, petitioners filed a letter from Dr. Eric J. Huang, the author of the case\nstudy, describing the scope of the study. Pet. Ex. 11. Petitioners filed genetic testing records on\nDecember 27, 2011, and April 5, 2012, and respondent filed additional genetic testing records on\nOctober 22, 2012. Pet. Exs. 12, 13; Resp. Ex. C.\n\n        On March 25, 2013, petitioners filed the expert report of Dr. Lawrence Steinman, a\nneurologist and immunologist, and a supplemental report from him on March 27, 2013. Pet. Exs.\n14, 17. Respondent filed expert reports from Dr. Gerald Raymond, a pediatric neurologist, and Dr.\nArun Venkatesan, a neuroimmunologist, on July 23, 2013. Resp. Exs. D, E. On December 17,\n2013, petitioners filed responsive expert reports from Dr. Steinman and Dr. Paul Utz, an\nimmunologist and rheumatologist. Pet. Exs. 20, 21. Respondent filed supplemental reports from\nDr. Raymond and Dr. Venkatesan on May 30, 2014. Resp. Exs. F, G.\n\n       Petitioners filed a second supplemental report from Dr. Steinman on November 4, 2014.\nPet. Ex. 31. Respondent filed second supplemental reports from Dr. Raymond and Dr. Venkatesan\non March 6, 2015. Resp. Exs. H, I. Petitioners filed a third supplemental report from Dr. Steinman\non February 2, 2016. See Pet. Ex. 33. Respondent filed a third supplemental report from Dr.\nRaymond on February 27, 2017. Resp. Ex. S. On May 16, 2017, respondent filed additional\n                                                   2\n\fsupplemental reports from Drs. Venkatesan and Raymond. See Resp. Exs. T, U. Both parties filed\nextensive medical literature referenced by their respective experts.\n\n       The parties discussed settlement of this matter but were unable to resolve the case\ninformally. See, e.g., Resp. Status Rep. dated May 29, 2013 (ECF No. 64); Resp. Status Rep. dated\nApr. 21, 2014 (ECF No. 89); Resp. Status Rep. dated June 30, 2014 (ECF No. 93).\n\n        The parties filed a joint stipulation of facts on December 19, 2014, in which they stated that\nall experts agreed that J.T. had the P525L FUS mutation but disagreed as to the significance of this\nmutation with regard to her alleged vaccine injury. Joint Stipulation of Facts (“Joint Stip.”) dated\nDecember 19, 2014 (ECF No. 109) at 1. The parties further stipulated that J.T.’s genetic testing\nwas completed on November 5, 2009, as Sample ID RB14162, and that the results show “c.1574\nC>T mutation in FUS gene predicts substitution of amino acid leucine at position 525 for the\nnormal amino acid proline.” Id. at 2.\n\n         An entitlement hearing was initially scheduled for February 2014 but was cancelled to allow\nfor the filing of additional expert reports. Prehearing Order dated May 29, 2013 (ECF No. 65). The\nhearing was rescheduled several times thereafter to accommodate the availability of the parties’\nexperts. An entitlement hearing was held on January 25-26, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Drs.\nSteinman and Utz testified on behalf of petitioners, and Drs. Raymond and Venkatesan testified on\nbehalf of respondent. The hearing resumed on March 10, 2017, where Drs. Steinman and Utz again\ntestified on behalf of petitioners. After the hearing, both parties continued to file additional exhibits\nand expert reports until the record was closed on May 25, 2017. See Order dated May 25, 2017\n(ECF No. 164).\n\n          This matter is now ripe for adjudication.\n\n   III.      Issues to be Decided\n\n    The parties dispute two issues: J.T.’s diagnosis and whether the condition was caused by the\nHPV vaccination she received on March 1, 2007. Joint Prehearing Submission (“Joint Sub.”) dated\nApril 4, 2016 (ECF No. 135) at 1-2. Petitioners maintain that the HPV vaccine administered on\nMarch 1, 2007, caused J.T. to develop ADEM. Id. Respondent disagrees that J.T. had ADEM. The\nparties agree that J.T. had a genetic mutation, FUS P525L, which is associated with the\ndevelopment of juvenile ALS (“JALS”).\n\n    The parties also dispute causation. Petitioners assert that J.T.’s HPV vaccination caused her to\nsuffer ADEM. They further assert that “J.T.’s ADEM caused her ALS.” Joint Sub. at 2.\nRespondent disagrees that J.T. had ADEM, or that ADEM played any role in the etiology or clinical\ncourse of J.T.’s ALS. Instead, respondent asserts that J.T.’s ALS was caused by her genetic\nmutation.\n\n   IV.       Medical Summary\n\n             a. Summary of Relevant Facts\n\n       J.T. was born on January 12, 1994. Pet. Ex. 1 at 222. She received the first two doses of the\nGardasil vaccine from her primary care physician, Dr. Cuthbertson, on September 1, 2006, and\n                                                      3\n\fNovember 1, 2006, respectively. Pet. Ex. 1 at 7-9. She received the third dose of the vaccine on\nMarch 1, 2007. Id. at 9.\n\n         On May 24, 2007, J.T., age 13, fell while attempting to jump a hurdle during physical\neducation class. Pet. Ex. 1 at 193. In July 2007, she continued to develop weakness and pain in her\nleft leg and was walking with a limp. Id. By August 2007, she began experiencing right arm\nweakness. Id.\n\n        On August 28, 2007, J.T. saw an orthopedist, Dr. Scott Hoffinger. Pet. Ex. 7 at 40. She had\npain in the anterior and lateral thigh but “no neurological signs or symptoms.” Id. at 39. She had a\n“much harder time getting around with limping,” during the month of August. Id. She was referred\nto physical therapy, but returned to Dr. Hoffinger on October 9, 2007, because she was not better\nand “possibly a little bit worse,” after physical therapy. Id. At that time, Dr. Hoffinger noted that\nshe was weaker, her limp was significantly worse, and her leg muscles had some atrophy. Id. A\nbone scan of J.T.’s spine, pelvis, and lower extremities and MRI of her cervical, thoracic, and\nlumbar spine showed no gross abnormalities. Id. at 33. J.T. returned to Dr. Hoffinger on November\n13, 2007, for a routine follow-up, and on examination he noted that she had some bilateral wasting\nof her hands, with the left hand greater than the right. Pet. Ex. 7 at 33. He also noted decreased\nreflexes in her left lower extremity, and gross muscle atrophy of the left quadriceps and calf\nmuscles. Id. His assessment was “systemic polyneuropathy with gross muscle wasting,” and he\nreferred her to a pediatric neurologist and rheumatologist. Id.\n\n        On November 21, 2007, J.T. presented to pediatric neurologist Dr. Jonathan Strober. Pet.\nEx. 1 at 222-23. Dr. Strober noted that J.T. suffered from “left lower and right upper extremity\nweakness and atrophy with some mild weakness of the right lower extremity.” Id. at 223. EMG\nand nerve conduction studies showed “mixed demyelinative and axonal findings,” and Dr. Strober\nordered a lumbar puncture “to rule out autoimmune conditions such as chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy (“CIDP”).” Id. at 224.\n\n        On December 10, 2007, J.T. presented to Dr. Richard Finkel, a neurologist at the Children’s\nHospital of Philadelphia (“CHOP”). Pet. Ex. 3 at 1. She was admitted to CHOP for further\nevaluation and treatment. By that point, she was “unable to walk consistently around school and\nha[d] required a wheelchair for approximately the past [one] week.” Pet. Ex. 3 at 10. J.T. was\ndischarged December 15, 2007, with a diagnosis of CIDP/multifocal motor neuropathy. Id. at 10.\nShe underwent five doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”) therapy. Id. at 11.\n\n        On January 2, 2008, J.T. saw Dr. Strober again, and his records show that her condition had\nfurther deteriorated. Pet. Ex. 1 at 201. She underwent another round of IVIG but showed no\nimprovement. Id. at 197. By the date of her follow up with Dr. Strober on January 16, 2008, she\nwas unable to walk up the stairs and used a scooter to get around at school. Id. Due to her\nworsening condition despite repeated IVIG treatments, Dr. Strober prescribed a course of oral\nsteroids. Id. at 199.\n\n       J.T. was hospitalized at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital from February 4 through 17,\n2008. Pet. Ex. 2 at 822. During this admission, she was thought to have an autoimmune motor\nneuropathy and/or a possible motor neuron disease. Id. EMG testing indicated “pure motor\nneurogenic disorder with axonal features predominating.” Id. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed\nno signs of inflammation, oligoclonal bands and a normal IgG index. Id. at 823, 846, 864. An MRI\n                                                 4\n\fof her spine showed “loss of the cervical and lumbar enlargements and abnormal P2 signal, most\npredominantly below T8 in the spinal cord,” but no enlargement of the roots. Id. at 823, 835. She\nwas treated with five days of Solu-Medrol IV and three days of plasmapheresis. Id. A right-sided\nquadriceps muscle and sural nerve biopsy was “consistent with a neurogenic muscular pathology\nshowing some group atrophy with compensatory hypertrophy.” Pet. Ex. 2 at 737, 826- 27. During\nthe admission, Dr. Lawrence Steinman, petitioner’s expert, testified that he saw J.T. as a\nconsultant.3 Tr. 108.\n\n        On March 14, 2008, J.T. presented to Dr. Wang complaining of progressive weakness over\nthe past few days, which rendered her unable to stand, even with a walker. Pet. Ex. 1 at 182. J.T.\nwas then admitted to the hospital for a more aggressive regimen of Solu-Medrol and\nplasmapheresis. Id. at 183. On the third day of her hospitalization, J.T. suffered from a seizure.\nPet. Ex. 2 at 683. The attending neurologist noted her diagnosis as “motor neuropathy of unknown\ncause,” and the differential diagnosis could include a possible form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(“ALS”).4 Pet. Ex. 3 at 684. J.T. had another seizure on March 20, 2008. Pet. Ex. 2 at 698. The\nattending rheumatologist ordered continued IVIG, plasmapheresis, “metabolic/genetic/mitochondria\nevaluation STAT,” and consultation with expert Dr. Bob Miller to rule out ALS. Pet. Ex. 2 at 701.\nDr. Miller reluctantly concluded that J.T. had “a pure lower motor neuron syndrome, or progressive\nmuscular atrophy.” Tr. 314-15. He noted that “evidence for an autoimmune dysfunction or\ndemyelinating condition … [was] not convincing.” Id. at 314.\n\n       On April 5, 2008, J.T. saw Dr. Wang and Dr. Frankvich for a follow-up appointment. J.T.\ncontinued to have progressive weakness, and she was undergoing experimental treatment for\nprimary muscular atrophy with lithium and planned to start Riluzole, a drug used to slow the\nprocess of ALS, in one to two weeks’ time. Pet. Ex. 1 at 169-72.\n\n        J.T. saw Dr. Frankovich at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital for a follow-up in the\nPediatric Rheumatology Clinic on April 17, 2008. Dr. Frankovich noted that J.T.’s strength and\nendurance had continued to deteriorate to the point that she was experiencing difficulty feeding\nherself, rolling over at night, and maintaining an upright position. Pet. Ex. 1 at 162. Dr. Frankovich\nnoted that the lab tests did not confirm or refute an underlying autoimmune process. Id. at 165. Dr.\nFrankovich gave J.T. a steroid taper to further decrease her dosage of Prednisone. Id.\n\n        On April 29, 2008, J.T. presented to Dr. Wang for follow-up treatment. At that visit, Dr.\nWang noted that J.T. had previously received the Gardasil vaccination. Dr. Wang wrote, “[I]t is\nuncertain whether this vaccine may have played a role in her motor neuron degeneration.” Pet. Ex.\n1 at 160.\n\n        J.T. saw an ALS specialist, Dr. Catherine Lomen-Hoerth, on April 30, 2008. Pet. Ex. 1 at\n126. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth opined that J.T. had evidence of a “pure lower motor neuron syndrome\nwith the exception of crossed adductor reflexes.” Id. at 128 (parentheticals omitted). She noted that\nJ.T.’s “extensive work-up for a mitochondrial disorder” was negative. Id. Due to her diaphragm\n\n\n3\n While Dr. Steinman testified that he consulted in J.T.’s case during her hospitalization, he did not\nmake or create any medical records, or sign any of J.T.’s records. Tr. 12.\n4\n    See Section IV(e) for a detailed explanation of ALS.\n                                                     5\n\finvolvement, Dr. Lomen-Hoerth suggested that J.T. use a bilevel positive airway pressure\n(“BiPAP”) machine to help her breathe, which she began using on June 6, 2008. Id.\n\n        J.T. returned to Dr. Lomen-Hoerth on August 11, 2008. Her condition had failed to improve\ndespite a “variety of alternative medications and traditional treatments for ALS.” Pet. Ex. 1 at 67.\nHer prognosis was “difficult to determine since in some ways she resemble[d] [spinal muscular\natrophy] patients which may have a better prognosis.” Pet. Ex. 1 at 68. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth ordered\nhospice care for J.T. the same day. Id. at 69.\n\n       On March 9, 2009, J.T. was admitted to the University of California San Francisco Medical\ncenter with respiratory failure, and she subsequently died on March 15, 2009, of an “atypical\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)–like motor neuron disease.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 2. Subsequent\ngenetic testing on J.T. reported on November 5, 2009, by Dr. Robert Brown, Professor and Chair of\nthe Department of Neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, revealed that J.T.\nhad a P525L mutation in FUS exon 15 (“FUS P525L”). Resp. Ex. C at 1-2; Tr. 254.\n\n           b. Autopsy\n\n       On March 16, 2009, an autopsy was conducted by Drs. Lomen-Hoerth, Maurice S. Zwass,\nBradley A. Stohr, and neuropathologist Eric J. Huang, at the University of California San Francisco.\nThey concluded that J.T. died “from an atypical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like lower\nmotor neuron disease leading to respiratory failure.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 1.\n\n         There were three principle neuropathological findings: (1) extensive “macrophage5\ninfiltrates, lymphocytic6 infiltrates, and severe astrogliosis7 in the affected regions of the spinal\ncord,” attributed to “an extensive demyelinating8 process involving the anterior and lateral columns9\n\n5\n Macrophages are mononuclear phagocytes, which kill and ingest particulate matter and\nmicroorganisms. They also play a role in the “digestion and presentation of T and B lymphocytes.”\nDorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary (“Dorland’s”), 32nd Ed. (2012) at 1093, 1423.\n6\n Lymphocytes are mononuclear leukocytes, which make up the body’s immune cells, and are\ndivided into two classes: T and B lymphocytes. Dorland’s at 1084.\n7\n Astrogliosis, or gliosis, is an “excess of astroglia [astrocytes are collectively referred to as\nastroglia] in damaged areas of the central nervous system.” Dorland’s at 784. Astrocytes are\nneuroglial cells, which make up the supporting structure of nervous tissue. Id. at 1265.\n8\n Myelin is “the substance of the cell membrane of Schwann cells that coils to form the myelin\nsheath,” which is made up of proteins and acts as an “electrical insulator.” Dorland’s at 1218. The\nprocess of demyelination occurs when the myelin sheath is destroyed. Id.\n9\n  The anterior column of the spinal cord is “the anterior portion of the gray substance of the spinal\ncord; it contains neurons that innervate the skeletal muscles of the neck, trunk, and limbs. In\ntransverse section it is seen as a horn.” Dorland’s at 390. The lateral column is the intermediate\ncolumn of the spinal cord; it is “the lateral portion of the gray matter of the spinal cord, extending\nfrom the second thoracic to the first lumbar segment of the spinal cord; in transverse section it is\nseen as a horn.” Id.\n                                                     6\n\fat all levels of the spinal cord;” (2) “severe loss of motor neurons,”10 at all levels of the spinal cord;\nand (3) cytoplasmic inclusions11 in scattered neurons in the cortex, medulla oblongata and spinal\ncord. Pet. Ex. 6 at 7.\n\n       In addition to the three principle findings, the neuropathologist also wrote a lengthy\ndescription of the findings related to the spinal cord, stating in pertinent part:\n\n        The principal findings in the spinal cord are extensive demyelination involving the\n        anterior column, lateral column and anterior horn. There are macrophage infiltrates,\n        lymphocytic infiltrates and severe astrogliosis in the affected regions of the spinal\n        cord. Many of the inflammatory infiltrates are identified around blood vessels.\n        These findings are present at all levels of the spinal cord. Although the\n        demyelination does not appear to involve the posterior column, scattered\n        macrophages and lymphocytes are also identified in the posterior column. The\n        anterior horn of the spinal cord at all levels shows a severe loss of motor neurons.\n        Furthermore, all anterior nerve roots emanating from the ventral aspect of the spinal\n        cord show extensive loss of axons and marked demyelination. All of the lesions in\n        the spinal cord appear to be the same age.\n\nPet. Ex. 6 at 7.\n\n         In addition, the pathologists suggest that the progressive neurological disease was “mediated\nby immune responses leading to extensive demyelination in the spinal cord.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 8. They\ndescribe two examples of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases that had some of the\nneuropathological features seen in the autopsy, including ADEM and multiple sclerosis (“MS”). Id.\nHowever, they note that MS rarely presents in patients younger than age 15, and that ADEM affects\nadolescents. As for ADEM they stated, “Due to the rapid progressive nature of ADEM, the\npathological features are typically of the same age, and are frequently characterized by perivascular\ncuffing of macrophages, diffuse demyelination, and macrophage and lymphocytic infiltrates.\nAstrogliosis can be detected in ADEM, but [it is] usually not as robust as that seen in chronic MS\nlesions.” Id. at 9. The pathologists did not, however, conclude that J.T. had either MS or ADEM.\nJ.T.’s final diagnosis was “atypical progressive lower motor neuron disease,” or “atypical ALS.”\nId.\n\n        A list of references was included in the autopsy. Some of these references discussed\nneuropathological findings seen in motor neuron diseases (ALS) and demyelinating diseases\n(principally MS). Greenfield’s Neuropathology Text describes the findings seen in J.T.’s autopsy\nas consistent with motor neuron diseases (ALS). ALS is characterized by loss of motor neurons and\nsurviving neurons may contain inclusion bodies. Pet. Ex. 69 at 959. As for myelin abnormalities\n\n10\n  Neurons are “any of the conducting cells of the nervous system. A typical neuron consists of a\ncell body, containing the nucleus and the surrounding cytoplasm (perikaryon); several short\nradiating processes (dendrites); and one long process (the axon), which terminates in twig-like\nbranches [ ] and may have branches [ ] projecting along its course.” Dorland’s at 1267.\n11\n  Cell inclusions are “usually lifeless, often temporary, constituent[s] of the cytoplasm of a cell,\nsuch as an accumulation of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, pigments, secretory granules, crystals, or\nother insoluble components.” Dorland’s at 928.\n                                                   7\n\fseen in ALS, Greenfield’s explains, “white matter of the spinal cord shows myelin loss in the\ncorticospinal tracts associated with astrocytic gliosis and accumulation of microglial macrophages.”\nId.\n\n        Similar findings are also described in demyelinating conditions, specifically MS. In the\nTextbook of Neuropathology, Raine explains that MS is characterized by “selective loss of myelin\nwith relative sparing of axons.” Pet. Ex. 68 at 627. Acute MS is characterized by myelin pallor,\nlesions that are “intensely inflammatory with small mononuclear cells,” perivascular cuffing,\nmacrophages, and T cell involvement in lesions. Id. at 669.\n\n         c.    Dr. Eric J. Huang’s Article12\n\n        Approximately one year after J.T.’s death, Dr. Huang and colleagues presented J.T.’s case,\nalong with one other case, in an article entitled “Extensive FUS-Immunoreactive Pathology in\nJuvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Basophilic Inclusions.” Pet. Ex. 9 at 1. The autopsies\nfrom both cases revealed a severe loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Many of the remaining\nneurons contained “intra-cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions.” Id. at 3. Immunohistochemistry\nstaining revealed that these “basophilic inclusions were strongly positive for FUS.” Id. Basophilic\ninclusions were also found in parts of the cerebral cortex and medullar oblongata. Id. The\n“abnormal FUS protein accumulations” (basophilic inclusions) were noted to be “the most striking\nfinding,” underscoring “the critical role of abnormal FUS protein accumulations in [JALS].” Id.\n\n       As for the white matter13 pathology, the authors suggested it may be “a manifestation of the\ndisease process in rapidly progressive ALS.” Id. at 8. They stated that future studies are needed to\ndetermine the significance of the “white matter pathology” in FUS/ALS patients. Id. Unlike J.T.’s\nautopsy report, in the article there is no suggestion of an immune-mediated response or reference to\nADEM or MS.\n\n         d.    Dr. Huang’s Letter, July 2, 2011\n\n        More than two years after J.T.’s death, and in response to an apparent inquiry from\npetitioner’s counsel, Dr. Huang wrote the following letter, dated July 2, 2011, to Mr. Cohan:\n\n       This letter is in response to your request to opine on whether the case study entitled\n       “Extensive FUS-Immunoreactive Pathology in Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral\n       Sclerosis with Basophilic Inclusions” analyzed whether Gardasil was a contributing\n       factor in causing [J.T.]’s juvenile ALS.\n\n       To answer your inquiry, while our study did initially consider Gardasil as a potential\n       contributing factor in causing [J.T.]’s juvenile ALS, we were unable to reach any\n       definitive conclusion on that issue. The hypothesis that Gardasil may have\n\n12\n  Huang, Eric J., Extensive FUS-Immunoreactive Pathology in Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral\nSclerosis with Basophilic Inclusions, 20 BRAIN PATHOLOGY 1 (2010) [Pet. Ex. 9].\n13\n   White matter is “the white nervous tissue, constituting the conducting portion of the brain and\nspinal cord; it is composed mostly of myelinated nerve fibers arranged in anterior, posterior, and\nlater funiculi in the spinal cord and in a number of named fasciculi in the brain.” Dorland’s at 1793.\n                                                   8\n\f        contributed in some way to [J.T.]’s disease was based on a number of case reports on\n        the adverse effects of Gardasil in the central nervous system and, in [J.T.]’s case, the\n        temporal relationship of the onset of juvenile ALS after the administration of the\n        Gardasil vaccination. Due to the difficulty to establish a direct cause-effect\n        relationship, however, we decided to focus our study on the neuropathological\n        features of [J.T.]’s disease. In my opinion, Gardasil may still have a plausible role in\n        the initiation and/or progression of [J.T.’s] condition, but it was not within the\n        purview of our study to examine whether such a mechanism may have contributed to\n        [J.T.]’s juvenile ALS. Nonetheless, it was our determination that the causal and/or\n        contributing role of Gardasil in juvenile ALS should be examined in additional\n        studies.\n\nPet. Ex. 11 at 1.\n\n          e.    ALS\n\n        There is no disagreement about whether J.T. suffered from ALS, and indeed, the parties\nstipulate to that fact. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a “devastating and universally\nfatal neurodegenerative disorder,” that “primarily affects motor neurons (“MNs”) and has no\neffective treatment.” Pet. Ex. 62 at 1. ALS is a “progressive degenerative disease of the motor\nsystems.” Resp. Ex. F4 at 1. The disease is characterized by a “progressive loss of motor neurons,”\nand ultimately leads to paralysis. Tr. 19, 243. Upper motor neurons are those “in [the] brain or\nbrain stem that feed to [ ] other motor neurons and both excite and inhibit them. Id. at 244. Lower\nmotor neurons are those in “the spinal cord that actually project right out to the muscles\nthemselves.” Id. ALS results in death or degeneration of these motor neurons. Id. There can be\nboth upper and lower motor neuron involvement. Resp. Ex. F4 at 271. The disease typically\npresents as muscle atrophy which progresses to upper motor neuron involvement and respiratory\ninsufficiency. Id. at 274.\n\n        There is no cure for ALS, and while disease progression can be slowed, patients eventually\nsuccumb to respiratory failure. Resp. Ex. F4 at 274-75. Fifty percent of patients die within three\nyears of diagnosis, though the time frame may be altered based on age of onset. Id. at 271. While\nthe disease is typically seen in older individuals, ALS which occurs prior to age 25 is defined as\n“juvenile ALS,” or “JALS.” Tr. 244. There is no specific laboratory test for ALS, which makes\ndiagnosis challenging, especially early in the disease course. Resp. Ex. F4 at 272. Typically,\ndenervation and decreased response to nerve stimuli are seen in patients with ALS. Id.\nAdditionally, many patients present with wasting of the hand muscles. Id.\n\n        Approximately ten percent of ALS is associated with genetic mutations. Tr. 257. One of\nthese mutations is the fused in sarcoma (“FUS”) mutation. This mutation was first identified\nthrough its association with cancer, specifically sarcoma, where it escalates growth of cancer cells.\nId. at 255. The mutation is now found in a variety of diseases. Resp. Ex. D at 4. As it relates to\nALS, FUS mutations cause protein to build up in the cytoplasm of cells, instead of being properly\nlocalized in the nucleus. Tr. 257. The protein that builds up in the cytoplasm is believed to\nadversely impact protein synthesis. Id. at 246-48.\n\n       With regard to JALS, over 50 mutations have been found to be associated with the disease.\nOne of these is FUS P525L, the mutation identified in J.T. Tr. 263-64; 260-61. This specific\n                                                   9\n\fmutation and its association with JALS was first referenced in the literature in 2009. See Resp. Ex.\nD6;14 Resp. Ex. E6.15 “Patients with the FUS P525L mutation, most of whom are female,\nreportedly display a specific ALS phenotype characterized by a severe course, early disease onset,\nrapid disease onset, rapid disease progression, multiple system degeneration and the presence of\nbasophilic inclusions.” Pet. Ex. 62 at 7. In the P525L mutation, the 525th amino acid, a proline, is\nchanged to a leucine due to an altered base pair. Resp. Ex. D at 4. This causes the FUS protein to\nmisfold and mislocalize. Tr. at 107. Rather than being in the nucleus, it is instead found in the\ncytoplasm of a cell. Id. It has been hypothesized that the misfolded FUS proteins “inhibit normal\nRNA and protein synthesis and thereby suppress[] neuronal functions and survival,” resulting in\nneuron cell death, which is characteristic of the disease. Resp. Ex. F at 8; Tr. 107.\n\n         f.    ADEM\n\n        In contrast, “[a]cute disseminated encephalomyelitis (“ADEM”) is an immune-mediated\ninflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, which is typically transitory and self-limited.”\nResp. Ex. F at 3. “It is characterized by an acute or subacute encephalopathy … and MRI evidence\nof widespread demyelination that predominantly involves the white matter of the brain and spinal\ncord. It is presumed to be secondary to an immune response following a viral infection or\nvaccination.” Id. Initial findings of ADEM usually begin within two days to four weeks after the\nexposure to the inciting event. Id. “It often presents with systemic symptoms such as fever,\nmalaise, headache, and vomiting which occur shortly before the appearance of neurological\nsymptoms and signs. The clinical course is rapidly progressive, developing maximum deficits\nwithin a few days (mean 4.5 days).” Id. “A wide variety of neurological deficits have been\ndescribed in children with ADEM including obtundation and depressed consciousness; long tract\nsigns; ataxia;16 spinal cord involvement; visual involvement; [and] speech impairment or aphasia.\nFocal motor seizures have been reported.” Id. MRI is the most sensitive marker of acute\ndemyelination, showing lesions. Id.\n\n    Recovery from ADEM is usually complete, especially in children. Resp. Ex. F at 4. The\nclinical criteria for the diagnosis of ADEM are: (1) an acute or subacute encephalopathy with\npolyfocal deficits and widespread hyperintense lesions (seen on MRI) affecting the CNS white\nmatter; (2) “no evidence of previous destructive white matter changes … present on MRI[;]” and (3)\n“no history of a previous clinical episode with features of a demyelinating event.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n Caroline Vance, et al., Mutation in FUS, an RNA Processing Protein, Cause Familial\n14\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Type 6, 323 SCI 1208 (2009) [Resp.

Expert Qualifications\n\n           a. Petitioners’ Experts\n\n                   i. Dr. Lawrence Steinman\n\n        Dr. Steinman is a board certified neurologist and serves as a professor of neurology and\npediatrics at Stanford University, where he has been an attending physician and neurologist for the\npast 33 years. Pet. Exs. 20 at 1; Pet. Ex. 14 at 3. Dr. Steinman received his M.D. from Harvard\nUniversity and completed his residency at Stanford University Hospital. Pet. Ex. 48 at 1. He\nserved as the chair of the interdepartmental program in neuro-immunology at Stanford from 2002 to\n2011 and has been awarded numerous accolades and patents related to his work in neurology. Pet.\nEx. 14 at 3. Additionally, Dr. Steinman works as an editor for multiple journals in addition to\npublishing extensively on his work. Pet. Ex. 48 at 3-45. Dr. Steinman currently sees both adult and\npediatric patients in his practice. Pet. Ex. 14 at 3. Dr. Steinman has seen many patients with\nADEM and ALS, though he did not specify how many. Tr. 9.\n\n                  ii. Dr. Paul Utz\n\n       Dr. Utz is a professor of medicine at Stanford University and is board certified in both\nimmunology and rheumatology. Pet. Ex. 21 at 1. He obtained his M.D. from Stanford University\nand completed his residency at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Prior to\nteaching at Stanford, Dr. Utz also taught at Harvard Medical School. Id. He served as the director\nof Stanford’s Center for Clinical Immunology from June 2007 until November 2008. Pet. Ex. 49 at\n2. Dr. Utz received a grant from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to study the immune\nsystem’s response to the influenza vaccine. Pet. Ex. 21 at 2. He was involved in vaccine\ndevelopment for both multiple sclerosis and juvenile arthritis and is well-published in the areas of\nimmunology and rheumatology. Id. at 1-2. Dr. Utz routinely sees patients with a variety of\nneuroinfectious and neuroimmunological diseases, and he has cared for patients with ADEM and\nADEM-like illnesses. Resp. Ex. E at 1; Tr. 147. Because Dr. Utz specializes in immunology and\nrheumatology, he is very familiar with the diagnosis of ALS, as he often rules it out as a diagnosis\nfrom other systemic rheumatic diseases. Tr. 147. While he typically does not treat patients for\nALS, he has seen patients who have the disease.\n\n         b.    Respondent’s Experts\n\n                   i. Dr. Gerald Raymond\n\n        Dr. Gerald Raymond is a pediatric neurologist who specializes in neuropathology and\ngenetics. He attended medical school at the University of Connecticut. Resp. Ex. O at 1. After\nmedical school, Dr. Raymond completed residencies in pediatrics and neurology fellowships in\ndevelopmental neuropathology, genetics and teratology. Id. Dr. Raymond is board-certified in\npediatrics, clinical genetics, and neurology, with special competency in child neurology. Id. at 15.\nHe has taught at numerous institutions including Université Catholique de Louvain in Brussels,\nBelgium, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, and is currently a professor of\nneurology at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine. Id. at 2 and 14. Dr. Raymond has\nserved as a peer reviewer and published numerous articles in these fields as well. See id. at 2–9 and\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f16. He has treated over 100 patients with ADEM over the course of his professional career, and he\nhas also seen patients with ALS. Tr. 241.\n\n                   ii. Dr. Arun Venkatesan\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan completed both a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology and an M.D. at\nthe University of California, Los Angeles. Resp. Ex. E at 1. His residency in neurology was\ncompleted at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where he joined the teaching staff\nat the medical school. Id.

In the last five or six years, Dr. Venkatesan has seen over 100\npatients with ADEM, and he also sees and diagnoses patients with ALS and other motor neuron\ndisorders. Tr. 382-83.\n\n   VI. Discussion\n\n         a.    Standards for Adjudication\n\n       The Vaccine Act was established to compensate vaccine-related injuries and deaths.\n§300aa-10(a). “Congress designed the Vaccine Program to supplement the state law civil tort\nsystem as a simple, fair and expeditious means for compensating vaccine-related injured persons.\nThe Program was established to award ‘vaccine-injured persons quickly, easily, and with certainty\nand generosity.’” Rooks v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 35 Fed. Cl. 1, 7 (1996) (quoting H.R.\nRep. No. 908 at 3, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6287, 6344).\n\n        Petitioners’ burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence. §300aa-13(a)(1). The\npreponderance standard requires a petitioner to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the\nvaccine at issue caused the injury. Moberly v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 592 F.3d 1315,\n1322 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Proof of medical certainty is not required. Bunting v. Sec’y of Health &\nHuman Servs., 931 F.2d 867, 873 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In particular, petitioners must prove that that\nthe vaccine was “not only [the] but-for cause of the injury but also a substantial factor in bringing\nabout the injury.” Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1321 (quoting Shyface v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs.,\n165 F.3d 1344, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 1999)); Pafford v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 451 F.3d\n1352, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2006). A petitioner who satisfies this burden is entitled to compensation\nunless respondent can prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the vaccinee’s injury is “due\nto factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine.” §300aa-13(a)(1)(B).\n\n         b.    Legal Framework\n\n       To receive compensation under the Program, petitioners must prove either: (1) that J.T.\nsuffered a “Table Injury”—i.e., an injury listed on the Vaccine Injury Table— corresponding to a\nvaccine that she received, or (2) that J.T. suffered an injury that was actually caused by a\nvaccination. See§§ 300aa-13(a)(1)(A) and 11(c)(1); Capizzano v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs.,\n440 F.3d 1317, 1319-20 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Petitioners must show that the vaccine was “not only a\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fbut-for cause of the injury but also a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.” Moberly, 592\nF.3d at 1321 (quoting Shyface, 165 F.3d at 1352-53).\n\n        Because petitioners do not allege that J.T. suffered a Table injury, they must prove that the\nvaccine J.T. received caused her death. To do so, they must establish, by preponderant evidence:\n(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccine and her injury (“Althen Prong One”); (2) a\nlogical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccine was the reason for her injury (“Althen\nProng Two”); and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccine and her\ninjury (“Althen Prong Three”). §300aa–13(a)(1); Althen v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 418\nF.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2005).\n\n        The causation theory must relate to the injury alleged. Thus, petitioners must provide a\nreputable medical or scientific explanation that pertains specifically to this case, although the\nexplanation need only be “legally probable, not medically or scientifically certain.” Knudsen v.\nSec’y of Health & Human Servs., 35 F.3d 543, 548-49 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Petitioners cannot\nestablish entitlement to compensation based solely on their assertions. Rather, a vaccine claim must\nbe supported either by medical records or by the opinion of a medical doctor. § 300aa-13(a)(1). In\ndetermining whether petitioners are entitled to compensation, the special master shall consider all\nmaterial contained in the record, including “any . . . conclusion, [or] medical judgment . . . which is\ncontained in the record regarding . . . causation.” § 300aa-13(b)(1)(A). The undersigned must\nweigh the submitted evidence and the testimony of the parties’ offered experts and rule in\npetitioners’ favor when the evidence weighs in their favor. See Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1325-26\n(“Finders of fact are entitled—indeed, expected—to make determinations as to the reliability of the\nevidence presented to them and, if appropriate, as to the credibility of the persons presenting that\nevidence”); Althen, 418 F.3d at 1280 (“close calls” are resolved in petitioner’s favor).\n\n         Another important aspect of the causation-in-fact case law under the Vaccine Act concerns\nthe factors that a special master should consider in evaluating the reliability of expert testimony and\nother scientific evidence relating to causation issues. In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509\nU.S. 579 (1993), the United States Supreme Court listed certain factors that federal trial courts\nshould utilize in evaluating proposed expert testimony concerning scientific issues. In Terran v.\nSec’y of Health & Human Servs., 195 F.3d 1302, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the Federal Circuit ruled\nthat it is appropriate for special masters to utilize Daubert’s factors as a framework for evaluating\nthe reliability of causation-in-fact theories actually presented in Program cases.\n\n        The Daubert factors for analyzing the reliability of testimony are: (1) whether a theory or\ntechnique can be (and has been) tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to\npeer review and publication; (3) whether there is a known or potential rate of error and whether\nthere are standards for controlling the error; and (4) whether the theory or technique enjoys general\nacceptance within a relevant scientific community.” Terran, 195 F.3d at 1316, n.2 (citing Daubert,\n509 U.S. at 592-95). In addition, where both sides offer expert testimony, a special master’s\ndecision may be “based on the credibility of the experts and the relative persuasiveness of their\ncompeting theories.” Broekelschen v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 618 F.3d 1339, 1347 (Fed.\nCir. 2010) (citing Lampe v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 219 F.3d 1357, 1362 (Fed.Cir. 2000)).\nHowever, nothing requires the acceptance of an expert's conclusion “connected to existing data only\nby the ipse dixit of the expert,” especially if “there is simply too great an analytical gap between the\ndata and the opinion proffered.” Snyder v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 88 Fed. Cl. 706,\n743 (quoting Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 146 (1997)).\n                                                  13\n\f           c.    Expert Opinions\n\n                     i. Petitioners’ Expert, Dr. Lawrence Steinman\n\n                           1. Diagnosis\n\n        Dr. Steinman emphasized that an immune response in the form of widespread inflammation\nin J.T.’s spinal cord was found outside of the areas that ALS affects, placing the pathology outside\nof ALS alone and indicating the presence of a secondary condition, ADEM. Pet. Ex. 20 at 1, 14.\nHe opined, “ALS does not explain how lymphocytes infiltrated far outside the boundaries seen in\nALS. The mutation does not explain why the pathologists … considered … ADEM as the leading\n[diagnosis].” Id. at 15. For these reasons, Dr. Steinman believes that J.T.’s correct diagnosis is\nboth ADEM and ALS.\n\n                                   a. Autopsy\n\n        Dr. Steinman’s opinion, in large part, turns on the neuropathology findings consistent with\ninflammation, and the comparison to ADEM, an immune-mediated condition. More specifically,\nDr. Steinman opined that the finding of “macrophage infiltrates, lymphocytic infiltrates, and severe\nastrogliosis,” as well as lesions appearing to be the same age, is “hallmark” for ADEM. Tr. 32\n(citing Pet. Ex. 6 at 7). Dr. Steinman agrees that the loss of neurons and basophilic inclusions\ndescribed in the autopsy report are due to the FUS P525L mutation and not ADEM. Tr. 129\n\n                                   b. Clinical Course\n\n        Dr. Steinman was a consultant on the team of doctors who cared for J.T. during her\nhospitalization in February 2008. Tr. 12-14. At that time, the physicians believed that J.T. had a\nneuroinflammatory disease, an inflammatory neuropathy, and possibly a motor neuron disease like\nALS.17 Tr. 100. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (“CIDP”) was considered as\na differential diagnosis. Id. at 23-24. Although a neuroinflammatory disease was also considered,\nDr. Steinman conceded that no one ever diagnosed J.T. with ADEM at any time during her hospital\ncourse. In fact, Dr. Steinman agreed that no one diagnosed J.T. with ADEM while she was alive.\nId. at 25. The only encephalopathic manifestation that J.T. had was a seizure. Tr. 83-84. Dr.\nSteinman did not attribute J.T.’s seizure to inflammation. Id. at 24. Moreover, J.T.’s seizure (or\nseizures) did not lead her physicians to a differential diagnosis of ADEM. Id. at 84. Instead, she\nwas diagnosed with ALS. Id. at 25.\n\n        As for diagnostic tests, Dr. Steinman conceded that J.T.’s EMG did not reveal findings\nconsistent with ADEM, but it did show motor and axonal involvement consistent with ALS. Tr.\n101-03. Similarly, J.T.’s cerebrospinal fluid did not show increased protein, which could be seen in\nADEM, and thus, the results were more consistent with ALS. Id. 105. MRIs of J.T.’s brain and\nspine were also consistent with ALS, and not ADEM. Id. at 105-06; 110-11. Moreover, J.T. did\nnot have the response to steroids, IVIG, or plasmapheresis Dr. Steinman would have anticipated if\nshe had ADEM; he would have expected a better response with improvement in her condition. Id.\nat 112-14.\n\n17\n     The attending physician during this admission was Dr. Ching Wang. Tr. 101.\n\n                                                 14\n\f                           2. Causation Theory\n\n        Dr. Steinman proposed a causation theory best explained in several steps.18 First, he opined\nthat the HPV vaccine triggered J.T.’s ADEM via the mechanism of molecular mimicry. Pet. Ex. 20\nat 1, 30; Tr. 16, 19. The description of the lesions being the same age indicates a “thunderclap”\nevent, or trigger, which Dr. Steinman believed to be the vaccine. Tr. 32-33.\n\n        The second part of Dr. Steinman’s theory relates to how ADEM caused J.T.’s ALS, and he\nalso discussed the role of the FUS mutation in causing ALS. Dr. Steinman testified that J.T.’s FUS\nmutation “made her motor neurons vulnerable to injury.” Tr. 469. He opined that the Gardasil\nvaccine likely caused damage to the motor neurons, which were already vulnerable from the FUS\nmutation. Tr. 469-71. The ADEM in turn triggered J.T.’s “fulminant course” of ALS. Pet. Ex. 20\nat 1; Tr. 16. According to Dr. Steinman, this theory is supported both by the medical literature and\nby J.T.’s autopsy report. Pet. Ex. 20 at 1. Scientific literature has “strong support … for how [HPV\nvaccine] can induce ADEM.” Id.\n\n       Dr. Steinman also testified regarding the temporal association between J.T.’s receipt of the\nGardasil vaccination and her subsequent alleged development of ADEM and then ALS.\n\n                                  a. Gardasil Vaccination Triggered ADEM via Molecular\n                                     Mimicry\n\n         Molecular mimicry occurs when there is structural similarity between a self-protein and a\nforeign-protein triggering an immune response that attacks the body’s own cells. Pet. Ex. 14 at 6-7;\nTr. 39. This structural similarity is due to homologous amino acid sequences located at the binding\nsite of the protein, the portion of the protein that triggers T-cell recognition. Pet. Ex. 14 at 6, 9.\nForeign proteins, “presented by the [human leukocyte antigen] molecules21 of the immune system,”\n“provoke[] the T cells to attack body tissues that contain the self-antigens. Pet. Ex. 18C at 109.22\nSpecifically, Dr. Steinman asserts that the HPV vaccine has been shown to have structural similarity\nto myelin basic protein (“MBP”) as well as aquaporin type 4 (“AQP4”). Pet. Ex. 14 at 9 and 13.\n\n                                           i. Myelin Basic Protein (“MBP”)\n\n       Dr. Steinman opines that there is sufficient homology between the Gardasil vaccine and “the\nmain constituents of the myelin sheath [i.e. MBP] to trigger a neuroinflammatory condition like\n\n\n18\n  Dr. Steinman briefly testified as to a possible second theory, that the aluminum adjuvant in the\nvaccine “stirred up” J.T.’s immune system and “push[ed] things over the edge.” Tr. 472. This\npotential theory was not well developed by petitioners. To the extent that petitioners offer this as\nanother causal theory, I find it unsupported by preponderant evidence.\n21\n  Leukocyte antigens are “a group of glycoproteins, antigenically similar but of different molecular\nweights, found on B cells, T cells, thymocytes, and leukopoietic cells.” Dorland’s at 105.\n22\n  For a more detailed explanation of the theory of molecular mimicry, see Pet. Ex. 32G and Resp.\nEx. R.\n\n                                                  15\n\fADEM.” Tr. 17. He cites an article by Wucherpfennig et al.23 showing that HPV, like many other\nviruses, shares “molecular similarities” with MBP between amino acids 82 and 98. Pet. Ex. 20 at 5.\nThe study demonstrates that MBP shares an amino acid sequence with HPV types 7 and 13.24 Pet.\nEx. 14 at 10-11.\n\n        Dr. Steinman also described alleged key sequences of MBP and HPV type 11 that have\nhomologies. Pet. Ex. 31 at 6. Within a 12 amino acid sequence, there is a three sequential amino\nacid homology and two isolated single amino acid homologies. Id. For HPV type 18, Dr. Steinman\nasserted “there are two matches, one with [three] amino acids and a second region with [three]\nconsecutive amino acids.” Id. at 7. In comparison, there is only a two amino acid homology,\nphenylalanine and lysine, between MBP and the L1 protein of HPV type 16. Pet. Ex. 20 at 7-8.\nBut, Dr. Steinman explains, these amino acids are “the key anchors to the HLA molecule and to the\nT cell receptors.” Id. at 8; Pet. Ex. 18B.\n\n        While Wucherpfennig examined the amino acid sequence necessary to cause antibodies to\nattack the brain, not the spinal cord, Dr. Steinman hypothesized that the process would work\nidentically in the spinal cord. Tr. 41. Other studies cited by Dr. Steinman demonstrate that five or\nsix amino acids were adequate to induce the animal model of ADEM in mice.27 Dr. Steinman\nconcedes, however, that no one can “say with absolute certainty… that the vaccine has enough\n[homology] to cause ADEM in a human.” Id.\n\n        Because of the cross-reactivity shown in his submitted literature, Dr. Steinman believes\n“[a]n immunization to Gardasil could thus… trigger brain inflammation.” Pet. Ex. 20 at 6. He also\nintroduced a study by Pohl-Kappe et al.28 describing “immunity to myelin basic protein in ADEM.”\nPet. Ex. 20 at 13. He opined that “[m]olecular mimicry is the scientific concept that best explains\nhow Gardasil can trigger ADEM.” Pet. Ex. 20 at 9.\n\n                                         ii. Aquaporin Type 4 (“AQP4”)\n\n       AQP4 is a water channel found in the astrocytes of the blood-brain barrier (“BBB”). Pet.\nEx. 14 at 13; Pet. Ex. 18G at 1991. Dr. Steinman opines that changes to astrocytes and the BBB are\n\n23\n   Kai W.

Dr. Steinman believes\nthat homology to the self-proteins in AQP4 “trigger[ed] a neuroinflammatory condition.” Tr. 17.\n\n        In support of this opinion, Dr. Steinman cited a study performed by Menge et al29 showing\nthree homologous amino acid sequences between AQP4 and HPV types 16 and 18. Pet. Ex. 14 at\n13 (citing Pet. Ex. 18H). Dr. Steinman believes there is “striking cross-reactivity” between AQP4\nand the protein in HPV type 16. Pet. Ex. 20 at 12.\n\n        Dr. Steinman cited another study, performed by Bataveljic et al.,30 in support of the\nsignificance of AQP4 in ALS. Pet. Ex. 14 at 18. The study found that there was increased\nexpression of AQP4 in the brainstem and cortex of rats with the SOD1 gene mutation31 model of\nALS. Pet. Ex. 18G at 1991. The authors of the study hypothesized that the changes in AQP4\nchannels could affect the BBB “disturbing the neuronal microenvironment, and causing motor\nneuronal dysfunction and death.” Id. However, the authors did not discuss homology between\nHPV, or the HPV vaccine, and AQP4, or draw any conclusions about whether impairment in the\nBBB may contribute to the cause of ALS. Moreover, they cautioned against attributing too much\nsignificance to AQP4 alone in the impairment of the BBB. Pet. Ex. 18G at 2001.\n\n        Dr. Steinman testified about his concern that Dr. Huang, the neuropathologist for J.T.’s\nautopsy, never addressed the autopsy findings consistent with ADEM in the paper he later\npublished. 32 Tr. 51. The suggestion of an immune-mediated condition referenced in J.T.’s autopsy\nis not discussed in Dr. Huang’s article. Id. 51-52. Instead, Dr. Huang’s article focuses on the\nfinding of basophilic inclusions. Id. at 52. Dr. Steinman believes that the ADEM findings are too\nimportant to be ignored in any discussion of J.T.’s pathology. Id. at 55. He also believes it is\nsignificant that no other paper that discusses FUS/ALS mentions ADEM-like pathological findings.\nId. at 50, 56-57. He argues that since the literature regarding juvenile ALS in the context of FUS\nP525L gene mutations does not discuss ADEM-like findings, the pathology in J.T.’s case is even\n“more unusual.” For these reasons he is persuaded that “[J.T.] suffered from a two-hit scenario …\ninvolving ADEM and ALS.” Pet. Ex. 31 at 2.\n\n\n                                  b. J.T.’s ADEM Triggered Her ALS\n\n       Dr. Steinman opined that ADEM “was the trigger” that “either provoked or worsened the\ncourse of [J.T.’s] ALS.” Pet. Ex. 20 at 1. He posited that “ALS was triggered from an autoimmune\n\n29\n Til Menge et al., Neuromyelitis optica following human papillomavirus vaccination, 79\nNEUROLOGY 285 (2012) [Pet.

In mounting a response\nto the Gardasil vaccine, Dr. Steinman testified that a “cascade of events” occurred in J.T.’s immune\nsystem which led to “the immune destruction of [J.T.’s] motor neuron system.” Id. at 2. He also\nopined that “[t]here is striking cross-reactivity between AQP4 and the L1 protein of HPV type 16,”\nwhich is found in the Gardasil vaccine. Id. at 12. He thus posited that “Vaccination with Gardasil\ntriggered immunity to … AQP4 and this led to the triggering of ALS and ADEM…” Id.\n\n        Dr. Steinman testified that “Aquaporin-4 is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS.” Pet. Ex.\n14 at 18. He cited studies by Appel, Gussoni, and Panzara,33 which suggest evidence of adaptive\nimmunity in the spinal cord fluid of patients with ALS. While those findings suggest that\nimmunological processes may play a role in the etiology or progression of ALS, they fail to provide\npersuasive evidence that the HPV vaccine or ADEM, either alone, or in concert, cause ALS or\nworsen its course. See Pet. Ex. 20 at 14-15.\n\n        For example, in Panzara, a study cited by Dr. Steinman which describes autopsies of patients\nwho succumbed to ALS, the authors found inflammatory infiltrates in the spinal cord, raising the\npossibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration. Pet. Ex. 18A at 392. But\nthe authors drew no conclusions, instead recommending further studies to determine the role of\nautoimmunity in the pathogenesis of ALS. Id. at 403.\n\n                                 c.

Tr. 72. And while he opined that the HPV vaccine triggered J.T.’s ALS, he did not offer\nan opinion on whether J.T. would have lived longer had she not been vaccinated. Id. at 77-78.\nRather, he “explicitly [doesn’t] know whether it hastened her course or not.” Id. at 88. He cited a\ncase by Sproviero34 describing a patient with the P525L FUS mutation who did not develop ALS\nuntil age 44, after a battle with MS. Id. at 476. He opined that other patients with the P525L FUS\nmutation may have had a trigger for their ALS, but he suggests that since the articles describing\nthem were mainly focused on the mutation itself, a trigger was never discussed. Id. at 478. Dr.\nSteinman also testified that insufficient numbers of people have been tested to determine whether a\nperson can have the FUS mutation and not have ALS. Id. at 59-60. He would prefer to see genetic\ntest results from “a few million people” to feel comfortable definitively concluding that the FUS\nP525L mutation will always cause ALS. Tr. 483-84. He dismissed the fact that the mutation has\nnever been found in a healthy individual. Id. at 482-83. Dr. Steinman ultimately conceded,\nhowever, that there is no evidence to date that FUS is present in healthy people. Id. at 77.\n\n33\n  Nathan P. Staff & Stanley H.

He did introduce articles by Graves et al.35 and Hooten et al.,36\nshowing the presence of neuroinflammation in patients with ALS. Pet. Ex. 14 at 14-15 (citing Pet.\nEx. 18K). While the presence of neuroinflammation is not debated, Dr. Steinman agreed it was\nunclear from the current medical literature whether the inflammation initiates or is a consequence of\nneuron death seen in ALS. Tr. 108.\n\n         In Graves, the authors noted inflammation in the spinal cord and brain, suggesting mediation\nby activated macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. Citing Hayashi, 37 the authors suggest that\n“macrophages, present in ALS tissue [may] function as [ ] phagocytes,38 removing myelin debris,\nleft as axons degenerate…” Pet. Ex. 36 at 335. They conclude that “[f]urther studies are needed to\ninvestigate the initiating cause of inflammation.” Id. at 336.\n\n         Hooten and colleagues suggested that there are two stages of neuroinflammation in ALS, the\nfirst being protective and the second neurotoxic. Pet. Ex. 39. A more recent article by Staff and\nAppel39 summarized the consensus of the literature regarding neuroinflammation in ALS. The\nauthors stated that “It is unclear at this point how and when the immune system impacts the course\nof disease in ALS patients.” Pet. Ex. 37 at 335.\n\n        Dr. Steinman also submitted evidence of the innate immune system’s response to the\nGardasil vaccine. Pet. Ex. 14 at 14-15. After vaccination with Gardasil, participants in a study\ndemonstrated increased expression of immune system receptors. Id. at 14 (citing Pet. Ex. 18I).\nThis increased expression is the desired effect since it means the immune system is creating\nantibodies to defend against HPV. Id. Dr. Steinman believes that innate immune system activation\nis notable because it has been shown in patients with ALS. Id. (citing Pet. Exs. 18A, 18J).\nHowever, Dr. Steinman did not cite or submit any literature to support the idea that the FUS P525L\nmutation can be triggered by an immune stimulus.

Tr. 75. The time frame from J.T.’s first symptom of\nALS until her death was 22 months. Id. at 77. Finally, Dr. Steinman conceded that J.T.’s FUS\nP525L mutation could have caused her ALS without any vaccine trigger, and that J.T. would have\neventually had ALS, although he could not say when.

Onset\n\n        Dr. Steinman opined that the temporal interval between J.T.’s vaccination, on March 1,\n2007, and the onset of motor weakness nearly three months after vaccination, when she had a\nhurdling injury on May 24, 2007, is appropriate. Pet. Ex. 14 at 16; Pet Ex. 33 at 1. While it can be\ndifficult to cite the specific onset of “something you’re born with,” Dr. Steinman stated that J.T.’s\ntrack accident was an appropriate indicator for both the onset of ADEM and ALS. Tr. 80-81, 83.\n\n       Dr. Steinman referenced an article by Menge et al.41 describing three cases in which\nneuromyelitis optica (“NMO”)42 occurred between four and five months after HPV vaccination.\nPet. Ex. 33 at 2. Thus, a three month interval, as seen in J.T.’s case, would be well within the time\nframe for the onset of a CNS degenerative disorder after vaccination. Pet.

Diagnosis\n\n         Similar to Dr. Steinman, Dr. Utz opined that J.T. suffered from two neurological diseases:\n(1) a sudden onset autoimmune demyelinating syndrome43 and (2) an inherited form of ALS. Pet.\nEx. 21 at 2. Dr. Utz believes J.T. had an autoimmune demyelinating condition for two reasons.\nFirst, J.T. had a previous history of another autoimmune disorder, pityriasis,44 which increased her\nrisk of developing another autoimmune disease. Pet. Ex. 21 at 6. Second, Dr. Utz stated that that\nJ.T.’s autopsy results indicate an autoimmune demyelinating event, specifically with regard to the\n\n\n40\n  Dr. Steinman later testified, however, that he did not believe J.T.’s ALS would have occurred\nwithout a “second-hit.” Tr. 476.\n\n Til Menge et al., Neuromyelitis Optica Following Human Papillomavirus Vaccination, 79\n41\n\nNEUROLOGY 285 [Pet. Ex. 18h; Resp. Ex. F22].\n42\n   Menge explains, however, that NMO is an autoimmune demyelinating condition, like ADEM.\nSee Pet. Ex. 18H at 287. However, ALS is a motor neuron disorder, not a demyelinating disorder\nlike NMO.\n43\n  Unlike Dr. Steinman, Dr. Utz did not specify which specific autoimmune inflammatory condition\nhe believed J.T. had but testified that these conditions include “ADEM, CIDP, vasculitis, transverse\nmyelitis,” and others. Tr. 158. He conceded there was no reference to ADEM in J.T.’s medical\nrecord. Id. at 163.\n44\n   Pityriasis is a skin disease that is characterized by the formation of fine, branny scales. Dorland’s\nat 1451. “Branny” means “resembling bran; rough, scaly, dry.” Id. at 248.\n\n                                                  20\n\flesions of the same age and the evidence of widespread involvement of the CNS. Id. Dr. Utz based\nhis opinions in part on test results and autopsy findings.\n\n                                    a. Test Results\n\n        Dr. Utz testified that J.T. had low titer antinuclear antibodies45 (“ANA”) with a speckled\npattern, a positive antiphospholipid test,46 and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate47 (“ESR”),\nall of which indicate an autoimmune/inflammatory condition. Pet. Ex. 21 at 10. Specifically, the\nANA, while only “weakly positive,” was “more consistent with diseases caused by inflammation,”\nand “often seen in autoimmune diseases.” Tr. 161. Dr. Utz also testified that J.T.’s\nantiphospholipid test was positive at least twice, and possibly three times, in the “moderately\nabnormal range.” Id. at 162. He noted that while the ESR is a “relatively nonspecific test that’s\nelevated when there is inflammation in general,” it was elevated even while J.T. was receiving\nimmunosuppressive drugs that should have decreased any inflammation. Id. at 159-60, 162. Dr.\nUtz opined that the physicians who treated J.T. concluded from the test results that she had an\ninflammatory condition, which Dr. Utz testified is consistent with his proposition. Id. at 159. Since\nthe only trigger he could find in her records was the Gardasil vaccine, he concluded that the vaccine\nwas the triggering event of the demyelinating disease that eventually resulted in J.T.’s death. Pet.\nEx. 21 at 11.\n\n                                    b. Autopsy Results\n\n       Dr. Utz testified that J.T.’s autopsy further supports his opinion because it indicated that she\nsuffered from an autoimmune demyelinating disorder while also showing “many inconsistencies…\nfor FUS-related ALS.” Tr. 164. In his opinion, the fact that the lesions visualized were all of the\nsame age indicated a “discrete, single, inciting event…much more typical for ADEM… [and] not\ndescribed in… FUS/ALS.” Pet. Ex. 21 at 7; Tr. 167.\n\n       Additionally, T-cell infiltration seen in J.T.’s autopsy has been shown in animal models to\ncause destruction of the myelin surrounding axon sheaths. Pet. Ex. 21 at 7. Dr. Utz agreed,\nhowever, that lymphocytes are found in the central nervous system (“CNS”) in both ADEM and\nALS. Tr. 164-65. The fact that the pathologists did a second stain to differentiate between T cells\n\n45\n     Antinuclear antibodies are “antibodies directed against nuclear antigens.” Dorland’s at 101.\n46\n  An antiphospholipid test is used to detect the presence of antiphospholipid autoantibodies, which\nare “primary markers for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [and] are linked to increase risk of\nthrombosis … [and] thrombocytopenia.” Julius M. Cruse & Robert E. Lewis, Illustrated Dictionary\nof Immunology, (3rd Ed. (2009)), at 572. The autoantibodies include “those specific for cardiolipin,\nphosphatidylserine, and lupus,” and they are “present in individuals with antiphospholipid antibody\nsyndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, drug-induced disorders, and infectious and\nneurological diseases.” Id.\n47\n  ESR is the “rate at which erythrocytes precipitate out from a well-mixed specimen of venous\nblood, measured by the distance the top of the column of erythrocytes falls in a given time interval\nunder specified conditions; an increase in rate is usually due to elevated levels of plasma proteins\n…. It is increased in … active inflammatory disease.” Dorland’s at 1594.\n\n                                                   21\n\fand B cells, however, suggested to Dr. Utz that the pathologists saw something “abnormal” and\n“atypical for ALS.” Id. at 165. Dr. Utz also found significant the macrophagic and lymphocytic\ninfiltrates surrounding blood vessels (perivascular cuffing). Id. at 166. He testified that these are\nareas where the infiltrates are leaving the blood vessels and crossing the BBB to enter the CNS,\nindicates a process usually associated with ADEM. Id. at 166-67. He further testified that there is\nno mention of perivascular cuffing in any other FUS-related ALS case. Id. at 167.\n\n                             2. Causation Theory\n\n                                     a. Molecular Mimicry and Stress48\n\n        Dr. Utz posited a two-part theory based on molecular mimicry and stress. He testified that\nself-antigens activated by the Gardasil vaccine triggered ADEM and also targeted the motor\nneurons affected in ALS. Tr. 205-06. The Gardasil vaccine “activate[d] preexisting autoreactive T\nand B cells through a process of molecular mimicry.” Id. at 512. Those T and B cells became\ninflammatory and crossed the blood-brain barrier to reach the CNS. Id. Once in the CNS, they\ncaused ADEM while also attacking the myelin sheath of neurons. Id. at 512-13. J.T.’s existing\nFUS mutation “stressed” her neurons, making them “poised to be pushed over the edge to develop\nALS.” Id. at 514. As the myelin containing cells were attacked by the self-antigens, the myelin\nwas destroyed. Id. at 216. This demyelination killed the axons being protected by the myelin, and\nthis axon death was “the ALS part of it.” Tr. 216. Dr. Utz acknowledged that there is no literature\nto support his stress theory,49 which is “speculative.” Id. at 211. He opined that even without\npreviously stressed cells, ADEM can still trigger ALS. Id. at 211-32. Dr. Utz believes the vaccine\nand subsequent ADEM caused J.T. to develop ALS sooner than she would have otherwise, if she\neven developed it at all. Id. at 220, 228.\n\n       As support for the theory that inflammation can trigger ALS, Dr. Utz cited three studies:\nPanzara et al., Casula et al., and Zhao et al.50 Tr. 222-23; 228-29. These studies generally discuss\nevidence that an “inflammatory responses could play a critical role in the pathogenesis of motor\nneuron injuries in [ALS].” Pet. Ex. 18J at 233. In Zhao, however, the authors note that\nneuroinflammation is “[a] prominent pathological finding in ALS,” and that “[t]he key question,” is\nwhether “neuroinflammation is a consequence of motor neuron injury,” or causes it. Pet. Ex. 38 at\n890. The authors’ findings suggest a dynamic immune response designed to “promote\nneuroprotection or neurotoxicity at different stages of disease.” Id. In the early stages of ALS, the\nimmune system reacts to “signals from injured motor neurons to rescue and repair damaged tissue.”\nId. As the disease progresses, “a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses … to deleterious\n\n\n48\n  Dr. Utz also testified that it is possible that the adjuvant in the vaccine opened the BBB allowing\nharmful cells to enter the CNS and cause ADEM. Tr. 204. As he stated that this theory was only\npossible, and not probable, I do not find preponderant evidence to support it.\n49\n     Dr. Utz also referred to “stress bodies or stress granules.” See Tr. 231.\n50\n   Panzara et al., 6 NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE 392 [Pet. Ex. 18A], discussed earlier; M. Casula et\nal., Toll-Like Receptor Signaling in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Spinal Cord Tissue, 179\nNEUROSCI. 233 (2011) [Pet. Ex. 18J]; Zhao et al., 8 J. NEUROIMMUNO. PHARMACOLOGY 888 [Pet\nEx. 38].\n\n                                                     22\n\fimmune responses.” Id. While “activation of immune pathways may contribute to the progression\nof inflammation, resulting in motor neuron injury … future studies … will be important to achieve a\nbetter understanding.” Pet. Ex. 18J at 233.\n\n       In addition to molecular mimicry to MBP and AQP4, Dr. Utz opined that the HPV vaccine\nmight also have triggered cross reactions with other myelin constituents. Pet. Ex. 21 at 7. While he\nbelieves that there is sufficient homology between AQP4 and HPV16 to “represent biologically-\nrelevant T cell epitopes,51 he admitted that there is no evidence of auto-reactivity to MBP or AQP4.\nPet. Ex. 21 at 10.\n\n        Dr. Utz also posited that the disease may have been triggered by HPV antigens produced as\na result of J.T.’s prior vaccinations. Pet. Ex. 21 at 7. He noted that J.T. had a history of warts\nwhich, while caused by a different HPV strain, may have enough protein similarities to components\nof Gardasil to allow the pre-existing antigens to react. Id. at 7-8.\n\n       Lastly, Dr. Utz opined that adjuvants “activate[d] toll-like receptors, … [which] are [ ]\ninflammatory.” Tr. 182. Dr. Utz conceded, however, that his opinion as to adjuvants was derived\nfrom animal studies that tested Freund’s adjuvant52 and not the “proprietary alum[inum]-based\nadjuvant[s]” in Gardasil. Id. at 202.\n\n                                  b. The Role of the FUS Mutation\n\n        While Dr. Utz agreed that J.T. had the FUS P525L mutation, he believes that her ALS\ndeveloped as a response to her immune reaction to Gardasil. Pet. Ex. 21 at 9; Tr. 158. He pointed\nout that it is unknown whether there are individuals with this specific FUS mutation living normal\nlives. Pet. Ex. 21 at 11. He conceded that none of the other FUS cases described in the literature\ndiscussed another patient receiving the Gardasil vaccine prior to developing ALS, nor did they\ndiscuss a trigger for the disease. Tr. 169. He pointed out, however, that the lesions noted on\nautopsy were of the same age, “strongly” indicating “an inciting event,” since typical ALS lesions\nare of differing ages. Pet. Ex. 21 at 9. He also disagreed with the assertion of respondent’s expert,\nDr. Raymond, that the basophilic inclusions examined on autopsy were in fact FUS proteins. Id.\nDr. Utz believed this claim was invalid since the Huang study never tested for FUS proteins when\nexamining the inclusions.53 Id.\n\n\n51\n   An epitope is an “antigenic determinant,” and is “the simplest form or smallest structural area on\na complex antigen molecule that can combine with an antibody or form the major histocompatibility\ncomplex (MHC)-binding peptide recognized by T lymphocyte receptors.” Illustrated Dictionary of\nImmunology at 253. “T cell epitopes are comprised of a complex of antigenic peptide linked to\neither MHC class I or class II molecules.” Id.\n52\n  In the context of immunology, an adjuvant is “a nonspecific stimulator of the immune response.”\nDorland’s at 32. Freund’s adjuvant is “a water in oil emulsion incorporating antigen, in the aqueous\nphase, into lightweight paraffin oil with the aid of an emulsifying agent. On injection, this mixture\ninduces strong persistent antibody formation.” Id. at 32-33.\n53\n  Dr. Utz appears to be incorrect, as Huang et al. did stain the inclusions for FUS, and they had\n“intense positive staining.” Pet. Ex. 9 at 3.\n                                                  23\n\f        Dr. Utz further contended that the FUS mutation may not have significantly influenced the\ncourse of the disease because a study by Vance et al.54 shows diffuse ubiquitination in the neurons,\nwhile J.T. had only rare ubiquitination.55 Pet. Ex. 21 at 8. Additionally, other FUS patients did not\ndisplay perivascular inflammation as was seen in J.T. Pet. Ex. 21 at 9. Dr. Utz also introduced\nevidence of two autoimmune diseases that are known to be associated with genetic mutations and\nactivated by environmental triggers: systemic lupus erythematosus56 and rheumatoid arthritis.57 Tr.\n509-10.\n\n        Dr. Utz does not believe that the FUS P525L mutation alone was sufficient to have caused\nJ.T.’s ALS, or, at least, he believes it is unknown if J.T. “would have gone on to develop ALS from\nthe mutation alone.” Tr. 173, 497.58 He noted that there are individuals with other FUS mutations\nwho are living healthy, normal lives though he does concede that has not yet been observed with the\nP525L mutation. Id. at 173, 498. He also mentioned a study performed by Sharma et al.59 in which\nthe FUS gene was “knocked out” in mice but the animals neither died nor developed any ALS-like\ndisease. Dr. Utz, like Dr. Steinman, concluded that an insufficient number of healthy individuals\nhave been tested to conclude that P525L is a disease-causing mutation. Id. at 498. Lastly, Dr. Utz\nmentioned that there are mutations in other genes that have been associated with other diseases but\nnot everyone with the mutation goes on to develop the disease. Id. at 498-99.\n\n54\n     Vance et al., 23 SCI. 1208 [Resp. Ex. D6].\n55\n   Ubiquitination occurs when an ubiquitin protein is attached to another protein during\n“intracellular proteolysis,” which is “the splitting of proteins by hydrolysis of the peptide bonds\nwith formation of smaller polypeptides.” Dorland’s at 1535, 1997. J.T.’s autopsy showed “very\nrare neurons stained for ubiquitin.” One of the subjects in the Vance paper had “diffuse ubiquitin\npositivity in nuclei in the patient’s tissue but not control tissue, suggesting that one or more nuclear\nproteins are misfolded.” Pet. Ex. 21 at 8. Although Dr. Utz points out that J.T. had rare\nubiquitination, he does not explain the significance of this finding, except to contrast it with the\nfindings in Vance. Even if significant, however, petitioners have not provided preponderant\nevidence to show that rare ubiquitination alone would change the outcome of my decision.\n56\n  Systemic lupus erythematosus is a systemic disease of the connective tissue which predominantly\naffects women. Tr. 509. According to Dr. Utz, a number of known genetic mutations, as well as\nenvironmental triggers, are associated with the disease. Id. at 509-10.\n57\n   Rheumatoid arthritis is a “chronic systemic disease primarily of the joints, usually polyarticular,\nmarked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures and by muscle\natrophy and rarefaction of the bones.” Dorland’s at 157. “Rarefaction” means “diminution in\ndensity and weight.” Id. at 1593.\n58\n  Dr. Utz gave inconsistent testimony on this point. Elsewhere, he testified that more likely than\nnot, J.T. would have had ALS even if she had not received the vaccine. Tr. 218. Later, he changed\nhis opinion, testifying that this was an unknown. See id. at 497-98, 505.\n59\n   Aarti Sharma, et al., ALS-associated mutant FUS Induces Selective Motor Neuron Degeneration\nThrough Toxic Gain of Function, 7 NATURE COMMC’NS, No. 10465 (2016) [Resp. Ex. K]. The\nSharma article actually states, “These findings demonstrate that FUS-dependent motor degeneration\nis not due to loss of FUS function, but to the gain of toxic properties conferred by ALS mutations.”\nResp. Ex K at 10465. This is in agreement with the finding of misfolded FUS proteins on autopsy.\n                                                   24\n\f         Overall, while J.T.’s ALS was particularly aggressive, Dr. Utz testified that the literature\ndoes not support the supposition that her FUS P525L mutation caused her ALS. Tr. 179. Dr. Utz\nlisted a series of papers to support his conclusion that the FUS mutation alone could not have\ncaused the specific case of J.T.’s ALS, including Fecto & Siddique, Brown et al., Yan et al.,\nSproviero et al., Ito et al., Chio et al., and Mochizuki et al.60 Id. at 501-02, 506. Dr. Utz opined that\nJ.T.’s pathologic presentation of the disease was not consistent with others who had the same\nmutation. Id. at 179.\n\n         Fecto and Siddique reviewed publications assessing the various genes at play in the etiology\nof ALS and compared how these different genetic mutations lead to similar ALS symptoms and\ndisease progression. Pet. Ex. 50 at 644. The authors observed that FUS mutations make up\napproximately four to five percent of ALS cases, and that the FUS mutation has been linked to\nearlier disease onset. Id. at 666-67. They note that “[a]t least three other reports have described\nFUS mutations in patients with rapidly progressive sporadic or familial [juvenile] ALS with\nbasophilic inclusions, suggesting that basophilia due to nucleic acid accumulation is a hallmark of\npathology in FUS-linked [juvenile] ALS.” Id. at 666. While additional studies are needed to better\nunderstand the causative role of FUS mutations in the etiology of ALS, Fecto and Siddique report\nthat several studies have observed that FUS mutations are involved in the development of ALS. Id.\n\n         Yan et al. studied the array of FUS mutations present in patients with familial ALS by\nsequencing the exons of the FUS gene of 476 patients with familial ALS and 726 control patients\nwithout ALS. Pet. Ex. 61 at 807. The results of the study identified 17 different FUS mutations\nwhich occurred in 22 different families. Id. Yan also observed that “[p]atients with FUS mutations\nappeared to have earlier symptom onset, a higher rate of bulbar onset, and shorter duration of\nsymptoms that those with SOD1 mutations.” Id. Patients with the mutation make up 4.79 percent\nof all cases of familial ALS, suggesting that “FUS mutations may be a globally distributed genetic\ncause of familial ALS in patients of different genetic backgrounds.” Id. at 812. Yan et al. further\nposited that other factors, including environmental exposure and/or genetic background, could\naffect the clinical course of the disease. Id.\n\n       Chio et al. studied 52 Italian patients with familial ALS and 280 matched controls and\nperformed mutational screening of the FUS gene, finding two distinct mutations associated with\n\n60\n   Faisal Fecto & Teepu Siddique, Making Connections: Pathology and Genetics Link Amyotrophic\nLateral Sclerosis with Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia, 45 J.

The researchers also found a second, similar mutation in the FUS gene, also\nlocated in exon 15, known as the PR514S mutation. Id. at 2. The patient with the FUS P525L\nmutation was 21 years old and had a three month history of rapidly progressive bulbar dysfunction.\nId. at 3. The patient died within one year of her diagnosis. Id. Although it was not possible for\nChio et al. to analyze DNA from any of the patient’s family members, the researchers note that “the\n[FUS] mutations were not found in 280 control samples.” Id. at 2.\n\n         Finally, Dr. Utz cites the Mochizuki et al. study in support of his assertion that the FUS\nP525L mutation alone could not have caused J.T.’s development of ALS. The researchers stated\nthat “much is unknown about the clinicopathology of ALS with the FUS P525L mutation.” Pet. Ex.\n54 at 85. However, the authors performed autopsies on two Japanese sisters, both of whom suffered\nfrom familial ALS, and were able to map disease progression by comparing the sisters’ clinical\ncourses and genetic makeup. The elder sister had an FUS P525L mutation with an onset of ALS at\nage 13 in the form of right and left leg weakness and eventual quadriparesis. Id. at 86. The initial\nclinical feature was a possible polyneuropathy. Id. With the assistance of a mechanical ventilator,\nshe survived to the age of 40, over 26 years after her diagnosis. Id. Her younger sister began\nexhibiting symptoms of ALS at age 25, began using a mechanical ventilator approximately one year\nlater, and died of pneumonia at age 27. Id. Their mother died at age 35 within six months of her\ndiagnosis of progressive bulbar palsy. Id. While the eldest sibling was found to have P525L\nmutation, neither the DNA of the younger sibling nor their mother was analyzed. Id. at 89.\n\n        Mochizuki et al. noted that “All three patients in the family … developed limb weakness\nfollowed by bulbar palsy at a young age with very rapid progression …. [I]t seems likely that they\nhad the same FUS mutation.” Pet. Ex. 54 at 89. Notably, the elder sister, who had the FUS P525L\nmutation, like J.T., had a similar age of onset and disease manifestation as J.T. Pet. Ex. 1 at 193.\nAnd like J.T., the eldest sister in the Mochizuki study was thought to have a type of polyneuropathy\nprior to being diagnosed with ALS. Pet. Ex. 7 at 33.\n\n         Contrary to the testimony of Dr. Utz, these articles demonstrate that patients with ALS have\nbeen found to have similar mutations in the FUS gene and that certain mutations on the FUS gene,\nincluding P525L, are associated with a rapid onset of ALS symptoms at a young age. See Pet. Ex.\n59 at 3.\n\n                                  c. Onset\n\n        Dr. Utz opined that the timeline from vaccination to initial symptoms presented in the\nmedical records is consistent with an immune-mediated condition. Tr. 180. Due to the nature of\nthese types of diseases, he believes the disease process began earlier than the accident J.T. had at\nthe track but did not outwardly present itself until that time. Id. at 180-81.\n\n                  iii. Respondent’s Expert, Dr. Gerald Raymond\n\n                           1. Diagnosis\n\n       Dr. Raymond opined that J.T. suffered only from ALS, eventually resulting in her death.\nResp. Ex. D at 6. He opined that J.T.’s symptoms were consistent with JALS, which unlike adult\nonset ALS typically has either greater upper or lower motor neuron issues rather than both equally.\n                                                  26\n\fResp. Ex. H at 5. In ALS, it is common to see symptoms begin in one limb before involving others.\nId. J.T. never responded to immunosuppressants. While ALS has some amount of immune\ninvolvement, immunosuppressants have not been shown to be effective in treatment. Id. J.T.’s\nmanner of death, respiratory failure, is also consistent with ALS. Id.\n\n        Dr. Raymond testified that the FUS P525L mutation which J.T. had alters protein function\nand occurs in a region of known essential function. Tr. 260-61. Further, it is not observed in\ncontrolled populations. J.T.’s mutation was de novo, meaning it was not present in her parents. Id.\nat 261. It has been identified in multiple patients with juvenile onset ALS. Id.\n\n       Dr. Raymond summarized several case studies of P525L mutation, where patients had rapid\nprogression of disease. In Conte,61 an eleven year old girl with the P525L mutation and ALS had\nprogressive limb weakness with active and chronic denervation. Tr. 280-81; Resp. Ex. F13. The\nauthors concluded that “this mutation is consistently associated with a specific phenotype\ncharacterized by juvenile onset, [and] severe course.” Resp. Ex. D9 at 73. In Zou, 62 the authors\ndescribed a young woman with progressive muscle atrophy and weakness with acute and chronic\nneurogenic changes. Tr. 286; Resp. Ex. E11. Finally, in Ozoguz,63 the authors described a 14 year\nold boy with a de novo P525L mutation who had a rapid onset and progression of the disease. Tr.\n291; Resp. Ex. H1. In Baumer,64 two patients with a de novo P525L mutation had “a more\naggressive earl[y] onset.” Tr. 277-79. Both patients had lower motor neuron signs and progressive\nmuscle weakness similar to J.T. Id. at 278-79.\n\n       Dr. Raymond also cited Baumer to describe neuropathological autopsy findings specific to\nP525L FUS mutation in ALS patients.65 Tr. 294. The authors concluded that JALS “with\nbasophilic inclusions is a form of ALS characterized by protein deposits in motor neurons that are\nmorphologically and tinctorially distinct from those of classic sporadic ALS.” Resp. Ex.

Tr. 292. Based on my review of the\nsubmitted literature, Dr. Raymond’s testimony on the number of reported autopsies in P525L\nmutations appears to be more accurate. See id. at 292-300.\n\n                                                27\n\fas ALS-FUS. Id. at 612. The autopsies showed cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions and\ncorticospinal tract but not dorsal column degeneration. Id. Dr. Raymond opined that these findings\nare consistent with J.T.’s autopsy results. Tr. 296.\n\n        Dr. Raymond opined that J.T. did not meet the clinical criteria for ADEM because she did\nnot have encephalopathy, her MRI was not consistent with a demyelinating condition, and she did\nnot respond to immunosuppressants. Resp. Ex. F at 5; Tr. 312-13. J.T.’s MRIs did not show any\nindication of ADEM lesions, and her EMGs showed only a motor neuron disease. Tr. 309.\nAdditionally, Dr. Raymond emphasized that none of J.T.’s treating physicians ever suggested the\ndiagnosis of ADEM, a fact which Dr. Steinman also conceded. Resp. Ex. F at 5.\n\n        Dr. Raymond summarized the juvenile FUS P525L/ALS cases cited in the literature by\nreferencing the following table from Zou et al. Resp. Ex. E11 at 1312.e6.

E11 at 1312.e7.\n\n        Of these eleven patients, eight were female, age range eleven to 22, with disease duration of\nsix to 24 months. Id. Dr. Raymond testified that J.T.’s onset was typical of other P525L patients,\nand that her 22 month clinical course was consistent, but perhaps a little longer, than others. Tr.\n330.\n\n       Moreover, Dr. Raymond believes J.T.’s autopsy was consistent with ALS, and he offered\nreasonable explanations for any perceived inconsistent findings. Tr. 318-20. He explained that\n\n                                                 28\n\frelatively little information is known about J.T.’s type of genetically mediated ALS. Resp. Ex. F at\n6. The genetic test revealing the P525L mutation was not completed until after the autopsy, leaving\nthe pathologists with incomplete information at the time of autopsy. Id. at 5.\n\n        As for inflammatory changes and demyelination described on J.T.’s autopsy, Dr. Raymond\nopined that in “ALS, the spinal cord shows secondary loss of myelin due to the loss of neuronal\naxons,” and that “[t]hese changes are associated with variable astrocytic gliosis and the\naccumulation of macrophages and lymphocytes.” Resp. Ex. F at 2. Loss of neurons in the motor\ncortex leads to “severe myelin loss [which] can be traced up through the brainstem into the cerebral\nhemispheres.” Id. This caused the “characteristic pallor” that can be seen on cross-sections of the\nspinal cord. Id.\n\n         Dr. Raymond explained that due to the progression of the disease, most motor neuron\ndamage in ALS is typically seen in the corticospinal and other motor pathways. Resp. Ex. F at 2.\nHowever, in familial and genetic ALS, demyelination has also been demonstrated in other tracts.\nId. Dr. Raymond referenced studies done by Hirano et al. and Tandan and Bradley, 66 which show\ndemyelination in the posterior columns, spinocerebellar tracts, and Clarke’s nucleus67 of patients\nwith familial ALS. Resp. Ex. F at 2. Respondent also cited other studies about neuroinflammation\nin ALS.68 Dr. Raymond further explained that “evidence of inflammation is seen in both sporadic\nand familial ALS with the presences of macrophages, T cells, and B cells.” Id. at 3. Macrophages\nare “presumed to be involved in the phagocytosis, or ‘cleaning up’ of the dying motor neurons,\naxons, and myelination debris. Lymphocytes are also seen[,] and there is often perivascular\ninfiltration.” Id.\n\n       In support of his opinions, Dr. Raymond also cited Troost et al.,69 wherein the authors\nstudied “the prevalence and extent of lymphocytic infiltration” by examining spinal cords from 48\n\n66\n  Asao Hirano et al., Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Subgroup Characterized by\nPosterior and Spinocerebellar Tract Involvement and Hyaline Inclusions in the Anterior Horn\nCells, 16 ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY 232 (1967) [Resp.

Dorland’s at 1296.\n68\n   For example, in Philips & Robberecht, the authors discuss reactive microglial cells, and\nneuroinflammatory reactions in neurodegenerative diseases like ALS. Thomas Philip & Wim\nRobberecht, Neuroinflammation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Role of Glial Activation in\nMotor Neuron Disease, 10 LANCET NEUROL. 253 (2011) [Resp. Ex. E8]. The authors conclude that\nthe “inflammatory reaction, which is supposed to combat the precipitating factor, is believed to turn\ninto a hazardous process and contribute to neuronal damage.” Id. at 254.\n69\n  D. Troost et al., Lymphocytic infiltration in the spinal cord of patients with amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis, 8 CLINICAL NEUROPATHOLOGY 289 (1989) [Resp. Ex. F27]. Petitioners cited a number of\nmore recent studies, including Graves (2003) [Pet. Ex. 36], Hooten (2015) [Pet. Ex. 32]; and Staff\n& Appel (2016) [Pet. Ex. 37], all of which support Dr. Raymond’s opinion that macrophages and\nlymphocytic infiltrations may provide a “cleaning up” function, or have immunoprotective,\nfollowed by neurotoxic, roles.\n\n                                                    29\n\fcases of ALS. Resp. Ex. F27 at 289. They found lymphocytic infiltration in 44 percent (21 cases),\nand the “infiltrates were localized as small cuffs around the blood vessels.” Id. at 292. Further,\n“lymphocytic infiltration … was not restricted to the damaged parts of the pyramidal tracts …. [but\nwas also] observed in [ ] normal areas of the brain stem.” Id.\n\n        Dr. Raymond believes that the autopsy finding that “[a]ll of the lesions in the spinal cord\nappear to be the same age,” means that the disease was so far progressed that the motor neurons had\ndied and thus the pathology was “at an end stage.” Tr. 320. The analogy he gave was an empty\ncup; there is “no information about when I drank the water in the cup or when these neurons died.\nThey’re now all gone.” Id. The “severe loss of motor neurons,” caused “loss of exons [and] …\ndemyelination.” Id at 321. He stated that there is no evidence J.T. suffered that loss of neurons at\none specific time. Instead, “[J.T.’s] disease became evident, and then [became] progressively worse\nuntil her death.” Id. at 322. Additionally, the autopsy noted “rare cortical neurons with amorphous\ncytoplasmic inclusions” in the right frontal lobe and midbrain. Id. at 329. This finding indicates\n“early stage” neuronal loss in that section of the brain. This finding suggests that the pathology at\nissue did not occur at “one point in time.” Id. Moreover, J.T.’s progressive course does not support\nthe conclusion that she had complete loss of her neurons in her spinal cord at one time. Tr. 322.\n\n       In summary, Dr. Raymond believes that J.T.’s “symptoms, entire clinical picture, and\npathology are all consistent with a genetically mediated ALS.” Resp. Ex. F at 5; Tr. 331.\n\n                          2. Causation Theory\n\n        Dr. Raymond opined that J.T. had a “serious alteration in the FUS gene that resulted in\njuvenile ALS and was the direct and sole cause of her disease and death.” Resp. Ex. D at 6. “There\nis no evidence that this was caused or aggravated by the vaccine she received.” Id. Dr. Raymond\nemphasized that the P525L mutation has not been seen in normal individuals, as supported by the\nemails Dr. Steinman received from Drs. Sapp and Brown.70 Resp. Ex. F at 7-8. Dr. Raymond\nattached significance to their assertion that “[t]his is certainly the most aggressive form of ALS any\nof us here have seen – aggressive both in age of onset and in rate of progression.” Id. at 8. Dr.\nRaymond believes that the P525L mutation is “a disease causing mutation that presents early and is\nclinically aggressive.” Id. at 9.\n\n\n\n\n70\n   On January 30, 2014, petitioners filed Dr. Steinman’s emails from Dr. Robert Brown and Dr.\nPeter Sapp as Exhibits 25 and 26. Dr. Steinman testified that Dr. Brown is “one of the foremost\nexperts in ALS.” Tr. 73-74. Dr. Brown is a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical\nSchool and a co-discoverer of the FUS mutation. Id. at 59-60. He was also an author of the Huang\narticle (Pet. Ex. 9). Id. at 63. In an email from Dr. Brown to Dr. Steinman dated April 11, 2013,\nDr. Brown stated that “[w]e have seen the P525L mutation [ ] in at least three early onset (juvenile)\ncases …. More generally, others have described FUS mutations (including P525L) in juvenile ALS\nas well – often basophilic inclusions, of uncertain significance.” Pet. Ex. 25 at 1. In an email dated\nApril 12, 2013, Dr. Sapp reported to Dr. Steinman that the P525L mutation is not seen “in\ncontrols[,] and the ALS online database … does not report any instances from other\npublication[s]…” Pet. Ex. 26 at 1.\n\n                                                  30\n\f       Dr. Raymond references a paper written by Niu et al. 71 in which researchers demonstrated\nthat mutations in the FUS protein interfered with its ability to be transported from the cytoplasm\nback into the nucleus. Tr. 261-62. This mislocalization interfered with transcription and RNA\nprocessing. Id. at 257. He also pointed out that this mutation is present from the moment of\nconception, and that it is always present and active in an affected individual. Id. at 265. Dr.\nRaymond testified that the Sharma article demonstrates that any affected individual will eventually\ndevelop motor neuron loss.72 Id. at 267-69. In fact, mice affected with a P525L mutation analog\nwere more quickly and severely affected than mice with another FUS mutation. Id. at 268.\nAdditionally, the mice required no environmental trigger for the motor neuron loss to begin; it\noccurred solely as a result of the mutation. Id. at 269. Dr. Raymond also introduced a paper\nauthored by Jackel et al.,73 in which a fruit fly model with the P525L mutation was found to have\ncytoplasmic accumulation of the FUS protein, nervous system changes, and local motor activity\nchanges. Tr. 275-76.\n\n        In surveying the literature submitted by both petitioners and respondent, Dr. Raymond found\nmore than 2,000 control patients, not one of which had the P525L mutation, supporting his opinion\nthat the mutation is found only in affected individuals. Tr. 272-74.\n\n        Dr. Raymond rejected petitioners’ theory of molecular mimicry as applied to the facts here.\nDr. Steinman stated that T cells could recognize both HPV and MBP, because HPV has homology\nwith a region of MBP and is therefore able to cross-react, basing his opinion largely on the\nWucherfennig paper. However, Wucherfennig warned that the paper did not find cross reactivity in\nthe HPV types found in Gardasil. Resp. Ex. F at 8 (ref. Pet. Ex. 24H). Wucherfennig stated that the\nepitope required a region of 13-15 proteins, and that the critical conserved region was FFK, not\nsimply FK. Cross-reactivity with HPV was strain-specific to types 7 and 13. Id. Gardasil contains\ntypes 6, 11, 16, and 18. Id. Dr. Raymond also disagreed with Dr. Steinman’s revised opinion to\nrequire FK with three other amino acids, in which case, almost any exposure could have been a\ntrigger. Resp. Ex. H at 2. Dr. Steinman provided no evidence that the HFFK-like motif in HPV is a\ncomponent of Gardasil, a recombinant vaccine. Id.\n\n        Dr. Raymond also disagreed with Dr. Steinman’s assertions regarding cross reactivity\nbetween AQP4 and HPV, which were based on the Menge article, a report of four cases of NMO in\nthe VAERS database following HPV immunization. Resp. Ex. F at 9. While the authors question\nthe role of HPV, this does not establish a pathogenic link. Id. In addition, the link between AQP4\nand ALS is not clear. There is no evidence that AQP4 interacts with FUS. Resp. Ex. D at 4.\nFurther, there is no evidence that J.T. ever developed an antibody to AQP4 or had NMO.

There is\nno evidence that HPV vaccine can result in widespread alterations of DNA and no evidence that it\ninteracts in any way with the FUS protein.” Resp. Ex. D at 4.\n\n       Lastly, Dr. Raymond cited to the discussion of mechanistic evidence from the Institute of\nMedicine (“IOM”), in relation to the Huang study, quoted in pertinent part as follows: “Based on\nthe genetic analysis and neuropathology, the authors [of Huang] did not attribute the rapidly\nprogressive form of [JALS] in the patient to vaccination against HPV.” Resp. Ex. L at 4. A\nfootnote attributed the above quoted information to a “personal communication with Dr. Lomen-\nHoerth, ALS Center, University of California, San Francisco.” Id., note 1. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth is\nthe specialist in ALS who treated J.T. from April 2008 until her death in March 2009; she also\nperformed her autopsy. Tr. 545, 547.\n\n                  iv. Respondent’s Expert, Dr. Arun Venkatesan\n\n                          1. Diagnosis\n\n                                  a. ALS is the Correct Diagnosis\n\n       Dr. Venkatesan opined that J.T. “suffered from juvenile-onset ALS caused by the FUS\nP525L gene mutation,” unrelated to the Gardasil vaccine. Resp. Ex. E at 3. He based this\nconclusion on J.T.’s clinical course and diagnostic tests, which were all consistent with FUS P525L\nALS. Tr. 386-88.\n\n        While petitioners propose that there was “an inciting autoimmune component” (i.e. vaccine-\ntriggered ADEM), to J.T.’s ALS, Dr. Venkatesan does not believe that there is any evidence to\nsupport this position. Resp. Ex. E at 3. As support for his opinion, he referenced the fact that\nimmunosuppressants had little benefit in treating J.T., nor have they been successful in other trials\nfor the treatment of ALS. Id. Rather, he stated that in ALS, “the observed inflammatory response\nis predominantly a reaction to the degeneration of neurons and axons.” Id. He cited studies\nperformed by Hosmane et al., Viviana et al., and Philips and Robberecht.74 Id.; Tr. 412-13. In\nparticular, Philips and Robberecht explain that both inflammation and T cells are commonly seen in\nALS. Id. at 413; Resp. Ex. E8. As the disease stage progresses, increased numbers of activated\nmicroglia and astrocytes are seen indicating an “activation of these immune cells.” Tr. 414. Dr.\nVenkatesan concluded that as immunosuppressants have largely been proven ineffective at treating\nALS, the inflammation is likely a result, and not a cause, of the disease.

Did Not Have ADEM\n\n                                          i. Clinical Course\n\n         Dr. Venkatesan does not believe that J.T. ever had ADEM, as she did not exhibit any of the\ncriteria for the condition. Resp. Ex. G at 1. He referenced a book chapter written by Silvia N.\nTenembaum detailing the symptoms and diagnostic criteria for ADEM.75 Tr. 387, 394; Resp. Ex.\nF6 at 1253. “Rapid onset encephalopathy (behavioral change or altered consciousness)” is a\ncentral feature of ADEM. Id. at 1254. Patients generally develop symptoms rapidly, with the most\nsevere symptoms occurring one to two weeks after initial presentation. Id. at 392. After that time,\npatients usually begin to improve. Id. Dr. Venkatesan noted that J.T. did not “have any signs or\nsymptoms of encephalopathy at the onset of her neurologic presentation,” and her initial symptom\nwas exclusively leg weakness. Resp. Ex. G at 1..\n\n        In ADEM, MRI is “the most sensitive paraclinical marker of acute demyelination,” showing\nmultiple white matter lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Resp. Ex. F6 at 1254. J.T. did not have\nan MRI or a lumbar puncture during her initial presentation, two tests essential to diagnose ADEM.\nResp. Ex. G at 1. During the acute phase, ADEM appears on MRI as “multiple areas of signal\nabnormality,” representing “dissemination of inflammatory lesions in the nervous system.” Tr. 393.\nEven months later, after a patient is no longer symptomatic, the MRI will still show “evidence that\nthere had been a prior injury to the nervous system.” Id. An MRI performed approximately one\nyear after J.T.’s initial symptoms showed no evidence that she ever had ADEM. Id. at 396-97.\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan also disagreed with Dr. Utz’s assertion that J.T.’s lab tests demonstrated\nevidence of ADEM. Dr. Utz cited a weakly positive ANA, elevated ESR, and positive\nantiphospholipid antibodies as evidence that J.T. had ADEM. Tr. 400-01. Dr. Venkatesan\ndisagreed with this conclusion. Id. at 401. Because comparison tests were not performed prior to\nvaccine administration, Dr. Venkatesan testified that there is no way to conclude those results were\nrelated to the vaccine. Id. He also does not believe those results were specific to or conclusive of\nADEM, nor “[did] they point to any evidence for inflammation in the nervous system.” Id.\n\n                                         ii. Autopsy\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan asserted that because ADEM is a clinical syndrome, it can be diagnosed\nonly clinically, when the patient is alive. Tr. 397-98. Pathology seen on autopsy may be used to\nsupport the diagnosis, but ADEM cannot be diagnosed based on pathology after death. Id. He\nopined that the spinal cord inflammation observed on J.T.’s autopsy is not indicative of ADEM\ndespite the assertions of Drs. Steinman and Utz. Resp. Ex. G at 1. While ADEM does cause\ninflammation, it is a monophasic disease, meaning that the inflammation is acute and resolves in a\nfew weeks. Id. Additionally, Dr. Venkatesan opined that ALS can cause inflammation, and he\ncited an article authored by Philips and Robberecht76 summarizing the “state of understanding of\ninflammation in ALS.” Tr. 411-12. He also cited articles by Panzara et al., Casula et al., and Zhao\n\n75\n Silvia N. Tenembaum, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, in 112 HANDBOOK OF CLINICAL\nNEUROLOGY: PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY PART II (O. Dulac et al., eds., 3rd series 2013) [Resp. Ex. F6].\n76\n     Philips & Robberecht, 10 LANCET NEUROLOGY 253 [Resp. Ex. E8].\n\n                                                 33\n\fet al. 77 (also cited by Dr. Utz) as evidence that ALS caused inflammation. Id. at 416-20. As noted\nearlier, taken as a whole, these articles emphasize that inflammation is present in ALS, but “there is\nno data to suggest that inflammation can propagate ALS.” Id. at 417.\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan also noted other issues on J.T.’s autopsy that precluded the diagnosis of\nADEM. Tr. at 398. On autopsy, J.T. had “demyelination in the anterior and lateral columns of the\nspinal cord with what appears to be sparing of the posterior columns.” Tr. 399. Dr. Venkatesan\nstated that it was difficult to imagine “a situation in which one would have ADEM… where there is\nextensive demyelination that is only along the motor tracts, but does not involve the sensory tracts,\nthe dorsal columns.” Id. Dr. Vankatesan emphasized that “the inflammatory cells were almost\nexclusively found in the anterior portion of the [spinal] cord, corresponding to areas that degenerate\nin ALS. This pattern is consistent with ALS,” and not ADEM. Resp. Ex. T at 1. He further opined\nthat the location of J.T.’s lesions was not “compatible” with ADEM. Tr. 399. Also, if the lesions\nall occurred at the same time, as Dr. Steinman hypothesized, Dr. Venkatesan opined that J.T. would\nhave been “neurologically devastated…. reflected in extreme weakness, potentially paralysis,”\naffecting not just one leg but rather her whole body at the time of initial presentation. Id. at 400.\nDr. Venkatesan would also have expected to see evidence of such devastation on her MRIs. Id.\n\n                           2. Causation Theory\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan opined that J.T.’s juvenile ALS was caused by the FUS P525L mutation,\nand he cited multiple case studies in support of his opinion. Articles by Vance et al. and\nKwiatkowski et al.78 show that FUS mutations are causally related to ALS. Resp. Ex. E at 5.\nAdditional studies by Conte et al., Mackenzie et al., and Baumer et al.79 demonstrate an association\nbetween the FUS P525L mutation with “juvenile onset, an aggressive clinical course, and\npredominantly a lower motor neuron disorder.” Id. Dr. Venkatesan stated that J.T. was “described\nas having a ‘pure lower motor neuron syndrome.’” Id. Zou et al. report the age of onset for\ngenetically-mediated JALS is 11 to 22 years of age and the duration of illness is six months to two\nyears.80 Id. J.T.’s age of onset, 13 years old, and the duration of her illness, 22 months, fall within\nthese ranges. Id. Additionally, Dr. Venkatesan noted that in his study, Dr. Huang concluded that\nJ.T. had “‘rapidly progressive juvenile ALS.’” Id.\n\n\n\n77\n Panzara et al., 6 NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE 392 [Pet.

Resp. Ex. E at 3. Additionally,\nDr. Venkatesan disagreed with Dr. Steinman’s reliance on the Menge et al.81 article demonstrating\nincreased AQP4 mRNA expression in SOD1 rats as proof for the involvement of AQP4 in ALS.\nId.; Tr. 402-03. Dr. Venkatesan stated that an increase in mRNA does not necessarily mean an\nincrease in the protein, nor does it explicitly indicate a role in ALS. Resp. Ex. E at 3. Furthermore,\nthe SOD1 rate has not been proven to be a reliable representation of the FUS P525L mutation, or\neven FUS mutations in general. Id. Nor did Dr. Venkatesan believe that cross-reactivity has been\ndemonstrated between HPV proteins and AQP4, as Dr. Steinman asserts. Id.; Tr. 402-03.\n\n         Dr. Venkatesan opined that the proposed mechanism of molecular mimicry between HPV\nproteins and MBP is tenuous. Resp. Ex. I at 1. He stated that the argument for molecular mimicry\nbetween HPV proteins and MBP “rests on limited sequence homology and a substantial reliance on\ndegeneracy[,] and Dr. Steinman has not produced evidence that this proposed sequence can actually\ninduce mimicry.” Id. Dr. Venkatesan referenced a study performed by Silvanovich et al.,82 in\nwhich researchers examined the odds of two molecules having a similar amino acid sequence. Tr.\n407-10. Using the math demonstrated in that article, Dr. Venkatesan opined that there is actually a\none in five chance that MBP has the HFF amino acid sequence that Dr. Steinman testified is so\ncritical. Id. at 408-09. Thus, “when one is looking for evidence of similarity [ ] between amino\nacids,” it is important to remember that it “can occur just by random chance.” Id. at 406.\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan also disagreed with Dr. Utz’s opinion that ADEM resulted in stress bodies\nor stress granules which may have played a causal role in J.T.’s ALS. Dr. Venkatesan emphasized\nthat Dr. Utz’s opinion as to ADEM, stress granules, and ALS is “quite tenuous and not supported by\nreliable evidence.” Resp. Ex. T at 1. Citing a paper by Dr. Wang, Dr. Venkatesan explained that\n“while stress granules have been observed in ALS,” it is not known whether they play a role in\n“disease pathogenesis” or if they serve “a protective function.” Id. at 2 (referencing Resp. Ex. T1).\n\n        While on the longer side of what is acceptable, Dr. Venkatesan agrees with Dr. Steinman\nthat the time period between vaccination and clinical presentation of symptoms is reasonable for an\nautoimmune response. Tr. 446; Resp. Ex. E at 4. However, Dr. Venkatesan believes J.T.’s ALS\nwas caused by the FUS P525L mutation and not the Gardasil vaccine. Resp. Ex. I at 2.\n\n      VII.   Analysis\n\n        Petitioners must establish that J.T. had the alleged diagnosis of ADEM, as “identifying the\ninjury is a prerequisite to the analysis” of causation. Broekelschen v. Sec’y of Health & Human\nServs., 618 F.3d 1339, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The Federal Circuit has made clear that it is a\npetitioner’s burden “to make a showing of at least one defined and recognized injury.” Lombardi v.\nSec’y of Health & Human Servs., 656 F.3d 1343, 1353 (Fed.

Broekelschen, 618 F.3d at 1346. However, it is not necessary\nto diagnose an exact condition. In Lombardi, the Federal Circuit explained, “The function of a\nspecial master is not to ‘diagnose’ vaccine-related injuries, but instead to determine ‘based on the\nrecord evidence as a whole and the totality of the case, whether it has been shown by a\npreponderance of the evidence that a vaccine caused the petitioner’s injury.’” Lombardi v. Sec’y of\nHealth & Human Servs., 656 F.3d 1343, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citing Andreu v. Sec’y of Health &\nHuman Servs., 569 F.3d 1367, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).\n\n        In deciding the issues in this case, I have considered the record as a whole. § 13(a)(1). I\nreviewed and relied on statements in the medical records, as medical records are generally viewed\nas trustworthy evidence, since they are created contemporaneously with the treatment of the\nvaccinee. Cucuras v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 993 F.2d 1525, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In\naddition, the treating physicians’ opinions are “quite probative,” as treating physicians are in the\n“best position” to evaluate the vaccinee’s condition. Capizzano v.

Cl. 344 (2011).\n\n           a. J.T.’s Correct Diagnosis is ALS\n\n        The parties stipulated that J.T. had the P525L mutation and ALS, and thus her diagnosis of\nALS is not in question. Therefore, I must decide whether J.T. had ADEM. I find that respondent’s\nexperts are more persuasive in concluding that J.T. did not suffer ADEM and that she suffered only\nfrom ALS. My reasons for this finding include that her clinical course was consistent with ALS but\ninconsistent with ADEM; her EMG and other diagnostic testing was consistent with a motor neuron\ndisease and inconsistent with ADEM; she did not respond to immunosuppresive therapy; none of\nher treating doctors ever diagnosed her with ADEM; and the findings on autopsy were inconsistent\nwith ADEM but consistent with ALS. Moreover, J.T.’s course is consistent with current medical\nknowledge of the FUS P525L mutation. Each of these reasons is discussed more fully below.\n\n         J.T.’s clinical course was not consistent with a monophasic illness such as ADEM but was\ninstead consistent with a rapidly progressive, aggressive motor neuron condition like ALS. The\ninitial manifestation of her illness occurred on May 24, 2007, when she fell while attempting to\njump a hurdle. By June 2007, she had weakness and pain in her left leg, and by August 2007, she\nwas walking with a limp. She was referred to physical therapy, but returned to the orthopedist in\nOctober 2007, due to the worsening of her condition. At that time, the orthopedist noted that J.T.’s\nlimp was significantly worse and the muscles in her legs had atrophied. By November 2007, she\nhad wasting of her hands and atrophy of the muscles in her thigh and calf. She was referred to a\npediatric neurologist. On November 13, 2007, the orthopedist described asymmetric muscle\nweakness and wasting of her limbs. Pet. Ex. 7 at 33. The duration of J.T.’s illness was\n                                                 36\n\fapproximately 22 months. As described by Dr. Raymond, J.T.’s aggressive course and her\nsymptoms are consistent with ALS, not ADEM. Tr. 304-07.\n\n       J.T.’s EMG testing was not consistent with ADEM, but it was consistent with motor neuron\ndisease, or ALS. EMGs performed in November 2007 showed acute and chronic denervation of the\nmotor system with sparing of the sensory system, suggesting a motor neuron disease. While\nhospitalized, EMG revealed “pure motor neurogenic disorder with axonal features predominating.”\nPet. Ex. 2 at 822.\n\n        Moreover, J.T.’s diagnostic testing was not consistent with ADEM, but was consistent with\nALS. The classic diagnostic test for ADEM is the MRI of the brain. Dr. Steinman agreed that\nJ.T.’s MRI did not show ADEM-like demyelinating lesions, and therefore, it was not consistent\nwith ADEM. Tr. 105, 308. Dr. Steinman testified that the MRI of J.T.’s spine showed a loss of\ncervical and lumbar enlargements, evidence of degenerative changes consistent with ALS, not\nADEM. Id. at 106, 110-11. Dr. Steinman also testified that J.T.’s EMG showed motor and axonal\ninvolvement and injury to the anterior horn cells, which is consistent with ALS. Id. at 103. He\nfurther stated that the EMG did not reveal any findings consistent with ADEM. Id. at 101.\n\n       Dr. Steinman also testified that J.T.’s CSF did not show increased protein, which would\nhave been expected in ADEM, and thus was more consistent with ALS. Tr. 105. She also tested\nnegative for oligoclonal bands, which would be expected with multiple sclerosis, and her muscle\nand nerve biopsy was also consistent with neurogenic muscular pathology. Id. at 308.\n\n        J.T.’s illness did not respond to immunosuppressive medication or treatment such as IVIG,\nsteroids, or plasmapheresis, which are generally effective against neuroinflammatory and immune-\nmediated conditions like ADEM. Even Dr. Steinman agreed that he would have expected a better\nresponse to IVIG if J.T. had ADEM. Tr. 112.\n\n        Further, none of J.T.’s treating physicians ever diagnosed her with ADEM. See Tr. 24-25.\nWhile her initial diagnosis was unclear, after her disease progressed and she was seen by an ALS\nspecialist, she was diagnosed with a motor neuron disease (ALS). Dr. Steinman testified that he and\nthe other physicians who saw J.T. during her hospitalization in February 2008 thought she had an\n“inflammatory neuropathy,” such as CIDP, but they did not consider ADEM as a differential\ndiagnosis. Id. at 22-24. During her February 2008 admission at Lucile Packard Children’s\nHospital, J.T. was diagnosed with a possible motor neuron disease. By March 2008, J.T.’s\nneurologist diagnosed her with a motor neuropathy of unknown cause, and the differential diagnosis\nincluded ALS. In April 2008, Dr. Lomen-Hoerth opined that J.T. had a lower motor neuron\nsyndrome. Pet. Ex. 1 at 128. J.T. died on March 15, 2009, of “atypical [ ] ALS-like motor neuron\ndisease.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 1.\n\n        The findings in J.T.’s autopsy also provide evidence to support the diagnosis of ALS and not\nADEM. There were three principle findings: extensive macrophage and lymphocytic infiltrates\nand severe astrogliosis of the spinal cord, severe loss of motor neurons, and cytoplasmic inclusions\nin neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The pathologists attributed the loss of motor neurons and\nthe cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions to ALS. At the time of J.T.’s autopsy, severe loss of motor\nneurons and cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions had been reported in juvenile ALS in several case\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\fstudies.83 That finding was not questioned by the pathologists or disputed by the parties. However,\nthe significance of the findings of extensive demyelination and the extensive macrophage and\nlymphocytic infiltrates are strongly contested. The disagreement has its origins in the discussion\nportion of the autopsy report, where the pathologists question the “histological feature of the\ndemyelination” which “appeared to be of the same age,” and the suggestion that J.T. had a\n“progressive neurological disease [] mediated by immune responses leading to extensive\ndemyelination in the spinal cord.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 8. MS and ADEM are cited as two examples of\nsuch conditions. But the pathologists did not diagnose J.T. with either MS or ADEM. Instead, they\ndistinguish J.T.’s clinical course from that of MS, because MS is rarely seen in patients under 15\nyears of age and most MS patients have a “remitting-relapsing” clinical course, not a progressively\nworsening course like J.T. As for ADEM, the pathologists note that while “astrogliosis can be\ndetected in ADEM…[it is] usually not as robust as that seen in chronic MS lesions.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 9.\n\n        In contrast, Dr. Raymond cited to literature which described evidence of demyelination in\nALS cases, characterized as lymphocytic infiltration of the spinal cord. Troost examined 48 ALS\nspinal cords, and described myelin pallor, macrophages, and lymphocytic infiltration in 21 of the\npatients (44%). Resp. Ex. F27 at 291. The lymphocytic infiltrates “were localized as small cuffs\naround the blood vessels (perivascular cuffing).” Id. at 292. The lymphocytic infiltration was seen\nin damaged areas, as well as “histologically normal areas of the brain stem, particularly in the\npyramidal tract.” Id. Troost concluded that lymphocytic infiltration is a common phenomenon in\nALS patients. Id. Dr. Raymond also cited literature detailing the findings of myelin pallor and\n“[l]oss of myelin from the cerebrospinal tracts and posterior columns…particularly in familial\ncases.” Resp. Ex. F30 at 382. Thus, based on all of the literature referenced by the pathologists\nwho performed the autopsy, as well as the experts for both parties, there appear to be pathological\nfindings common to both ADEM and ALS.\n\n        What was meant by the pathologists and Dr. Huang, the neuropathologist, when they wrote\nin the autopsy report that “the histological features of the demyelination appeared to be of the same\nage” is not entirely clear. Dr. Steinman and Dr. Raymond debated the meaning of this reference at\nlength. For Dr. Steinman, the reference to the lesions being the same age is fundamental to his\nopinion that J.T. had ADEM. He testified that this finding signified a “thunderclap” event, a\nhallmark for ADEM. Dr. Raymond disagreed, testifying that it meant the lesions were at an end-\nstage. He argued that if the lesions had occurred at one time, J.T. would have been paralyzed,\ninconsistent with her progressive decline as described in the records. While I cannot resolve this\ndebate, it does not alter the fact that J.T.’s autopsy findings are consistent with pathology seen in\nALS cases, and specifically FUS P525L ALS cases reported in the literature.\n\n       Juvenile ALS is a rare disease. In 2007 when J.T. first became ill, her mutation was not\neven known, and it was not reported in the literature until 2009. J.T.’s presentation and diagnosis\nmay not have been clear until her condition worsened and she was seen by ALS specialists.\nFurther, because ALS is a terrible and fatal condition, the physicians appear to have been reluctant\nto make the diagnosis. While initially J.T.’s condition may have been attributed to an inflammatory\n\n83\n  In 1992, Matsumoto and others reported two cases of juvenile ALS with basophilic inclusions. S.\nMatsumoto et al., Basophilic Inclusions in Sporadic Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: An\nImmunocytochemical and Ultrastructural Study, 83 ACTA NEUROPATHOL. 579 (1992) [Resp. Ex.\nD2]. In 2009, Kwiatkowski (one case) and Vance (three cases) both reported report cytoplasmic\ninclusions in postmortem studies of cases with FUS ALS. Resp. Ex. D5; Resp. Ex. E9.\n                                                38\n\fneuropathy, when she had diagnostic testing and was seen by ALS specialists, she was diagnosed\nwith ALS and only ALS. Her clinical course and the timeline of her diagnosis reflect the growing\nbody of knowledge about the geneotype-phenotype of FUS P525L ALS.\n\n         Based on J.T.’s clinical course, the opinions and diagnoses of her treating physicians, her\nautopsy results, and the current body of medical knowledge as described by the experts and set forth\nin their respective medical literature, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that J.T. did not\nhave ADEM and that she had only ALS.\n\n           b. Althen Analysis\n\n                   i. Althen Prong One: Petitioners’ Medical Theory\n\n        Under Althen Prong One, petitioners must set forth a medical theory explaining how the\nHPV could have caused J.T.’s ALS, leading to her eventual death. Andreu v. Sec’y of Health &\nHuman Servs., 569 F.3d 1367, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pafford, 451 F.3d at 1355-56. Petitioners’\ntheory of causation must be informed by a “sound and reliable medical or scientific explanation.”\nKnudsen, 35 F.3d at 548; see also Veryzer v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 98 Fed. Cl. 214, 223\n(2011) (noting that special masters are bound by both § 300aa- 13(b)(1) and Vaccine Rule 8(b)(1) to\nconsider only evidence that is both “relevant” and “reliable”). If petitioners rely upon a medical\nopinion to support their theory, the basis for the opinion and the reliability of that basis must be\nconsidered in the determination of how much weight to afford the offered opinion. See\nBroekelschen, 618 F.3d at 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“The special master’s decision often times is\nbased on the credibility of the experts and the relative persuasiveness of their competing theories.”);\nPerreira v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 33 F.3d 1375, 1377 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (stating that\nan “expert opinion is no better than the soundness of the reasons supporting it.”) (citing Fehrs v.\nUnited States, 620 F.2d 255, 265 (Ct. Cl. 1980)).\n\n                          1. Evaluation of the Evidence\n\n        I find that petitioners have failed to show preponderant evidence of Althen Prong One for\nfour reasons. First, petitioners’ causal theory is built on the assumption that J.T. had ADEM. Both\nDrs. Steinman and Utz opined that the first step of their theories is that the HPV vaccine caused J.T.\nto develop ADEM. Since I do not find that J.T. ever had ADEM, there is no longer a foundational\npremise for their mechanistic theory.\n\n        Second, assuming that petitioners are alleging that HPV caused J.T.’s ALS (even if she did\nnot have ADEM), they failed to provide preponderant evidence. Dr. Utz opined that the self-\nantigens activated by the HPV vaccine also targeted motor neurons affected in ALS. While\npetitioners did provide some evidence of homology between the HPV vaccine, MPB, and AQP4,\nthey did not provide preponderant evidence of homology between HPV and motor neurons, the\ndestruction of which causes ALS.\n\n        Similarly, petitioners did not explain or provide evidence to support Dr. Steinman’s theory\nthat the HPV vaccine damaged motor neurons which were already vulnerable due to the FUS\nmutation. Dr. Steinman suggested that the HPV vaccine, via homology with AQP4, resulted in\nchanges to the BBB, which disturbed the neuronal microenvironment, contributing to the death of\nmotor neurons. The premise for this theory appears to come from the Bataveljic article. However,\n                                                  39\n\fthe authors of that article did not discuss homology between HPV and AQP4 or draw any\nconclusions about whether impairment in the BBB may contribute to the cause of ALS. Moreover,\nthey cautioned against attributing too much significance to AQP4 alone with regard to impairment\nof the BBB. See Pet. Ex. 18G at 2001.\n\n       Dr. Steinman cited studies by Appel, Gossoni, and Panzara,84 which suggest evidence of\nadaptive immunity in the spinal cord fluid of patients with ALS. Pet. Ex. 20 at 14-15. While those\nfindings suggest that immunological processes may play a role in the etiology or progression of\nALS, they fail to provide persuasive evidence that the HPV vaccine or ADEM, either alone, or in\nconcert, cause ALS, or worsen its course.\n\n         Third, petitioners emphasize the finding of neuroinflammation on autopsy and the references\nto ADEM and MS in the autopsy report as evidence of an immune-mediated condition related to\nHPV. Dr. Steinman introduced evidence showing the presence of neuroinflammation in patients\nwith ALS. Pet. Ex. 14 at 14-15 (citing Pet. Ex. 18K). But while the presence of neuroinflammation\nis not debated, Dr. Steinman conceded it was unclear from the current medical literature whether the\ninflammation initiates or is a consequence of neuron death seen in ALS. Tr. 108. In Panzara,85 a\nstudy examining autopsies of patients who succumbed to ALS, the authors found inflammatory\ninfiltrates in the spinal cord, raising the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron\ndegeneration. Pet. Ex. 18A at 392. But they drew no conclusions, instead recommending further\nstudies to determine the role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of ALS. Id. at 404. Similarly, in\nGraves,86 the authors concluded that “[f]urther studies are needed to investigate the initiating cause\nof [ ] inflammation.” Pet. Ex. 36 at 6. I find the literature and Dr. Raymond’s testimony to be most\npersuasive on the significance of the inflammation. As best summarized by Staff and Appel, it is\n“unclear at this point how and when the immune system impacts the course of disease in ALS\npatients.” Pet. Ex. 37 at 335.\n\n        Fourth, I find petitioners’ theories regarding stress and vaccine adjuvants to be speculative.\nDr. Utz acknowledged that his theory that J.T.’s existing FUS mutation stressed her neurons,\nmaking them susceptible to ALS was speculative. While he did not concede that his theory based\non adjuvants was speculative, Dr. Utz’s testimony about this theory during the hearing was not\npersuasive. Moreover, this theory assumes that adjuvants activate toll-like receptors, which cause\ninflammation. Again, the role of inflammation in the etiology of ALS is simply unknown at this\ntime, and thus, I do not find any theory based on this premise to be persuasive.\n\n                   ii. Althen Prong Two: Logical Sequence of Cause and Effect\n\n        Under Althen Prong Two, petitioners must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\nthere is a “logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the\n\n84\n   Staff & Appel, 26 NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS 335 [Pet.

Evaluation of the Evidence\n\n         I find that petitioners failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the vaccine was the “but\nfor” cause of J.T.’s ALS for the following reasons. Petitioners agreed and both of their experts\nconceded that J.T. had ALS and was born with the FUS P525L mutation. However, petitioners’\nexperts were equivocal and gave contradictory evidence about whether J.T. would have developed\nALS if she had not received the vaccine. Initially, Dr. Steinman testified that J.T.’s mutation could\nhave caused her ALS without any vaccine trigger. However, later during the hearing, he recanted\nhis earlier testimony and testified that he did not believe that her ALS would have developed\nwithout a trigger, such as the vaccine. Similarly, Dr. Utz initially testified that more likely than not,\nJ.T. would have had ALS even if she had not received the vaccine. Tr. 218. However, he later\ntestified that it was unknown whether J.T. would have developed ALS if she had not received the\nvaccine. Id. at 497-98, 505. In contrast, respondent’s experts put forth a persuasive explanation\nthat J.T.’s serious genetic mutation caused her ALS and death and that the vaccine played no role in\nthe development or progression of her disease. Further, Dr. Lomen-Hoerth, an ALS specialist and\nJ.T.’s treating physician, did not attribute J.T.’s ALS to the HPV vaccine. I find the equivocation\nby petitioners’ experts to be telling, and Dr. Loemen-Hoerth and respondent’s experts to be more\npersuasive on this point.\n\n        I also find that petitioners failed to establish by preponderant evidence that the HPV vaccine\nmay have worsened J.T.’s condition or that it otherwise affected the course of her illness.\nPetitioners put forth no evidence to support their position on this issue. In contrast, Dr. Raymond\nprovided literature showing the reported cases of FUS P525L ALS, and these cases illustrate that\nJ.T.’s age at onset, clinical course, duration of illness, and severity of illness were consistent with\nthe reported cases. Further, there are no known instances of disease free individuals who have the\nP525L mutation. For these reasons, I find that petitioners failed to provide preponderant evidence\nof Althen Prong Two.\n\n                  iii. Althen Prong Three: Proximate Temporal Relationship\n\n        Under Althen Prong Three, petitioners must provide “preponderant proof that the onset of\nsymptoms occurred within a timeframe for which, given the understanding of the disorder’s\netiology, it is medically acceptable to infer causation-in-fact.” De Bazan, 539 F.3d at 1352. The\nacceptable temporal association will vary according to the particular medical theory advanced in the\ncase. See Pafford, 451 F.3d at 1358. A temporal relationship between a vaccine and an injury,\nstanding alone, does not constitute preponderant evidence of vaccine causation. See, e.g., Veryzer\nv. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 100 Fed. Cl. 344, 356 (2011) (explaining that “a temporal\nrelationship alone will not demonstrate the requisite causal link and that petitioner must posit a\nmedical theory causally connecting the vaccine and injury”).\n\n                           1. Evaluation of the Evidence\n\n       Petitioners’ experts opined that the temporal interval between J.T.’s vaccinations on March\n1, 2007, and the onset of motor weakness evidenced by her fall when jumping a hurdle on May 24,\n                                                   41\n\f2007, (84-85 days) is appropriate. Respondent’s expert, Dr. Venkatesan, testified that this time\nframe is “a little long” for onset given an immune response or molecular mimicry mechanism. Tr.\n446. However, Dr. Venkatesan stated that it was very difficult to say when J.T.’s symptoms began,\nand that it was “very likely” that her symptoms started earlier than the hurdle event.\n\n        Dr. Steinman testified that the onset of both J.T.’s alleged ADEM and her ALS occurred on\nMay 24, 2007, the day of her track accident, and he also testified that J.T.’s alleged ADEM in turn\ntriggered her ALS. Tr. 80-81, 83. Generally, cause and effect takes time to develop. For example,\nwhen a person is exposed to a virus, there is a time period between exposure and the development\nof symptoms, also known as the “incubation period.”89 In other words, symptom manifestation is\nnot instantaneous following exposure. Petitioners state in their prehearing submission that J.T.’s\nalleged ADEM “eventually triggered her ALS-like condition.” Pet. Prehearing Sub. at 16. Dr.\nSteinman’s testimony as to the onset of ADEM and ALS is thus inconsistent. Moreover, Dr.\nSteinman did not provide a plausible explanation of how or why the initial manifestation of both the\nalleged ADEM and the ALS occurred at the same time, in light of his theory that ADEM caused\nALS.90\n\n        Even assuming, arguendo, that petitioners could satisfy Althen Prong Three by\npreponderantly proving a medically appropriate onset, a temporal relationship alone does not\nconstitute preponderant evidence of vaccine causation. Petitioners failed to establish Althen Prongs\nOne and Two by preponderant evidence, and therefore, they failed to meet their burden of proof as\nto causation.\n\n           c. Alternative Causation\n\n        Because petitioners did not meet their burden of proof on causation, respondent does not\nhave the burden of establishing that a factor unrelated to the vaccination caused J.T.’s injuries. See\nDoe v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 601 F.3d 1349, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“[petitioner] Doe\nnever established a prima facie case, so the burden (and attendant restrictions on what ‘factors\nunrelated’ the government could argue) never shifted”). Nevertheless, respondent has identified an\nalternative cause of J.T.’s injuries: the FUS P525L ALS gene mutation. Pursuant to the Vaccine\nAct, compensation shall be awarded where the petitioner demonstrates the requirements set forth\nunder the Act by a preponderance of the evidence, and “there is not a preponderance of the evidence\nthat the . . . injury . . . is due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine.” § 300aa-\n13(a)(1)(A)-(B). The Vaccine Act provides that “factors unrelated to the administration of the\nvaccine,” are those “which are shown to have been the agent . . . principally responsible for causing\nthe petitioner’s illness, disability, injury, condition or death.” Id. § 13(a)(2)(B).\n\n      Thus, even if petitioners had established their case by a preponderance of the evidence, their\narguments fail because respondent has proven by preponderant evidence that the FUS P525L ALS\n\n\n89\n  “Incubation period” is defined as “the interval between receipt of infection … and the first\nsymptoms of illness.” Dorland’s at 1415.\n90\n  In Sproviero, a case relied on by Dr. Steinman, the patient had MS and at some later date\ndeveloped ALS. Pet. Ex. 53. Thus, Sproviero does not support Dr. Steinman’s opinion that the\nonset of ADEM and ALS occurred at the same time.\n                                                 42\n\fmutation—a factor unrelated to the administration of the vaccine—is responsible for causing J.T.’s\nJALS and her death.\n\n                   i. Althen Prong One: Respondent’s Medical Theory\n\n        To prove Althen Prong One establishing alternative causation, respondent is required to set\nforth a medical theory explaining how a factor unrelated to the vaccine caused the injury at issue.\nRespondent’s expert, Dr. Raymond, explained the causal theory underlying FUS P525L ALS, as\nfollows: “FUS is a nucleoprotein that functions in DNA and RNA metabolism, including DNA\nrepair, and the regulation of transcription, RNA splicing, and export to the cytoplasm.” Resp. Ex. D\nat 3. “In neurons, FUS is predominantly localized to the nucleus. []Neuropathological analysis of\nbrain and spinal cord of ALS patients carrying FUS mutations show[] cytoplasmic retention and the\nformation of FUS…aggregates.” Resp. Ex. H at 3. The P525L mutation has been “identified as a\ndisease causing mutation …. seen primarily in sporadic cases of juvenile ALS .... [I]ndividuals with\n[this] mutation have an earlier age of onset and a rapid progression” than seen in other types of\nALS.” Id.\n\n        While it is not exactly clear how the FUS P525L mutation causes neuronal degeneration or\nwhy it affects younger patients, literature cited by respondent reveals “mislocalization of mutant\nFUS proteins in neuronal cytoplasm with abnormal FUS protein aggregates that are associated with\nmarkedly disorganize[d] intracellular organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum and\nmitochondria,” which has led to the hypothesis that “mutant FUS proteins [] inhibit normal RNA\nand protein synthesis, thereby suppressing neuronal functions and survival.” Resp. Ex. F at 7.\n\n        Dr. Raymond cites an article by Blokhuis91 in support of this theory. In Blokhuis, the\nauthors discuss “ALS causing gene defects,” including the FUS mutation. Resp. Ex. D8 at 777.\n“FUS mediates a wide range of cellular processes including DNA repair, transcription, splicing and\nmRNA processing. The protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm to function in the\ntransport of mRNA.” Id. at 782. The authors suggests several molecular mechanisms whereby\nprotein aggregation, which occurs due to the mutation, affects neuronal function and causes disease.\nWhile the mechanism is not clear,92 the authors agree that “the fact that mutations in the genes\nencoding these proteins [FUS] segregate with disease in [familial ALS] supports the idea that their\ndysfunction is linked to motor neuron degeneration and disease pathogenesis.” Id. at 788.\n\n       Thus, although the exact mechanism is not understood, there appears to be a consensus by\nthose who have studied the FUS mutation and its association with ALS that FUS mutations\nadversely affect motor neurons and lead to ALS. More specifically, the FUS P525L mutation has\nbeen associated with neuropathological abnormalities, basophilic inclusions and FUS protein\naggregates, which have been linked to motor neuron degeneration. Therefore, I find by a\npreponderance of the evidence that respondent has satisfied Althen Prong One.\n\n\n91\n Anna M. Blokhius et al., Protein Aggregation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 125 ACTA\nNEUROPATHOL. 777 (2013) [Resp. Ex. D8].\n92\n  In an animal study published in 2015, Sharma and colleagues demonstrated that “FUS-dependent\nmotor degeneration [was] not due to loss of FUS function, but to the gain of toxic properties\nconferred by ALS mutations.” Resp. Ex. K at 1.\n\n                                                43\n\f                   ii. Althen Prong Two: A Logical Sequence of Cause and Effect\n\n        The second prong of Althen requires proof of a “logical sequence of cause and effect,”\nshowing that factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine are responsible for causing\nJ.T.’s JALS and subsequent death.\n\n        Dr. Raymond set forth a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the FUS P525L\nmutation caused J.T.’s juvenile ALS. First, J.T.’s clinical course was consistent with ALS and the\nrapid and aggressive course of P525L FUS described in other cases. Resp. Ex. H at 4. J.T. had a\nrapidly progressive decline, characterized by muscular weakness and wasting in her limbs, which is\nconsistent with ALS. She did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy. EMGs and nerve\nconduction tests showed findings consistent with ALS, and J.T. was diagnosed with ALS. J.T.’s\nautopsy showed neuropathological findings consistent with and specific to FUS P525L ALS.\nGenetic testing revealed that she had the FUS-P525L genetic mutation. This mutation has not been\nseen in healthy individuals. J.T. had the genotype-phenotype consistent with other case reports. Dr.\nRaymond testified that it is not necessary to invoke the vaccination as a trigger to explain J.T.’s\ncondition. I agree and find by a preponderance of the evidence that respondent has satisfied Althen\nProng Two.\n\n                  iii. Althen Prong Three: Timing\n\n        The last element of causation is proof of a proximate temporal relationship between the gene\nmutation and the injury. Althen, 418 F. 3d at 1278. The initial manifestation of J.T.’s ALS was age\n13. The age range for juvenile cases of FUS P525L includes children as young as 11 up to age 22.\nJ.T.’s onset occurred at age 13, within this age range. Resp. Ex. H at 4. The duration of her illness,\napproximately 22 months, was also consistent with FUS P525L ALS. Therefore, I find that\nrespondent has satisfied Althen Prong Three.\n\n   VIII. Conclusion\n\n        It is clear from the medical records that petitioners have greatly suffered as a result of their\ndaughter’s illness and tragic death, and I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to petitioners for the\nloss of their child. However, I cannot decide this case based upon my sympathy for petitioners but\nrather by my analysis of the evidence.\n\n        For all of the reasons discussed above, I find that petitioners have not established\nentitlement to compensation and their petition must be dismissed. In the absence of a timely filed\nmotion for review pursuant to Vaccine Rule 23, the Clerk of the Court SHALL ENTER\nJUDGMENT in accordance with this Decision.\n\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n                                            s/Nora Beth Dorsey\n                                            Nora Beth Dorsey\n                                            Chief Special Master\n\n\n\n                                                   44\n\f",

Introduction\n\n        On January 27, 2010, Philip and Barbara Tetlock (“petitioners”) filed a petition under the\nNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (“Vaccine Act” or “the Program”),2 42 U.S.C. §\n300aa-10 et seq. (2012), as the administrators of the estate of J.T., deceased. Petitioners alleged that\nas a result of receiving her third Human Papillomavirus (“HPV” or “Gardasil”) vaccine on March 1,\n2007, J.T. died on March 15, 2009. Petition at Preamble, ¶¶ 13, 14.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Because this decision contains a reasoned explanation for my action in this case, I intend to post\nthis ruling on the website of the United States Court of Federal Claims, in accordance with the E-\nGovernment Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. § 3501 note (2012)(Federal Management and Promotion of\nElectronic Government Services). As provided by Vaccine Rule 18(b), each party has 14 days\nwithin which to request redaction “of any information furnished by that party: (1) that is a trade\nsecret or commercial or financial in substance and is privileged or confidential; or (2) that includes\nmedical files or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted\ninvasion of privacy.” Vaccine Rule 18(b).\n2\n The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is set forth in Part 2 of the National\nChildhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3755, codified as amended,\n42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa-10 to -34 (2012). All citations in this decision to individual sections of the\nVaccine Act are to 42 U.S.C. § 300aa.\n\n                                                   1\n\f       As their theory of causation, petitioners specifically assert that the HPV vaccination J.T.\nreceived on March 1, 2007, caused her to develop acute disseminated encephalomyelitis\n(“ADEM”), which in turn triggered her development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”),\nwhich led to her eventual death on March 15, 2009. Respondent argued against awarding\ncompensation, stating that petitioners failed to provide preponderant evidence that J.T.’s ALS\nand/or her subsequent death were caused by the HPV vaccine. Respondent also argued that J.T.’s\ndeath was caused by the FUS P525L mutation.\n\n        Petitioners have faced great personal tragedy in the loss of their daughter, for which I extend\nmy deepest sympathy. However, after carefully analyzing and weighing all of the evidence and\ntestimony presented in this case in accordance with the applicable legal standards, I find that\npetitioners have not met their legal burden and are not entitled to compensation. Petitioners have\nfailed to provide preponderant evidence that the vaccination J.T. received on March 1, 2007, caused\nher ALS and subsequent death. Therefore, this case must be dismissed.\n\n   II.     Procedural History\n\n        Petitioners alleged that J.T. “suffered and died from the residual effects of the third and final\nseries of the Gardasil vaccination that she received on March 1, 2007.” Petition at ¶ 14. The\npetition further alleged that J.T. suffered from an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”)-like lower\nmotor neuron disease, caused by her vaccination. Id. at Preamble. Based on records subsequently\nfiled, petitioners thereafter revised their allegations and contended that J.T.’s March 1, 2007\nGardasil vaccination caused ADEM which “eventually triggered her ALS-like condition,” and that\nher death on March 15, 2009, was “due to respiratory failure resulting from her condition.” Pet.\nPrehearing Submission (“Sub.”) at 9, 12, 16. Respondent filed his Rule 4(c) Report on June 21,\n2010, recommending against compensation. Respondent’s Report (“Resp. Rept.”) dated Jun. 21,\n2010 (ECF No. 11) at 2.\n\n        On April 18, 2011, petitioners filed a case study involving J.T. indicating that a genetic\ndisorder caused her symptoms. Pet. Status Report (“Rep.”) dated Apr. 18, 2011 (ECF No. 20); Pet.\nEx. 9. On July 20, 2011, petitioners filed a letter from Dr. Eric J. Huang, the author of the case\nstudy, describing the scope of the study. Pet. Ex. 11. Petitioners filed genetic testing records on\nDecember 27, 2011, and April 5, 2012, and respondent filed additional genetic testing records on\nOctober 22, 2012. Pet. Exs. 12, 13; Resp. Ex. C.\n\n        On March 25, 2013, petitioners filed the expert report of Dr. Lawrence Steinman, a\nneurologist and immunologist, and a supplemental report from him on March 27, 2013. Pet. Exs.\n14, 17. Respondent filed expert reports from Dr. Gerald Raymond, a pediatric neurologist, and Dr.\nArun Venkatesan, a neuroimmunologist, on July 23, 2013. Resp. Exs. D, E. On December 17,\n2013, petitioners filed responsive expert reports from Dr. Steinman and Dr. Paul Utz, an\nimmunologist and rheumatologist. Pet. Exs. 20, 21. Respondent filed supplemental reports from\nDr. Raymond and Dr. Venkatesan on May 30, 2014. Resp. Exs. F, G.\n\n       Petitioners filed a second supplemental report from Dr. Steinman on November 4, 2014.\nPet. Ex. 31. Respondent filed second supplemental reports from Dr. Raymond and Dr. Venkatesan\non March 6, 2015. Resp. Exs. H, I. Petitioners filed a third supplemental report from Dr. Steinman\non February 2, 2016. See Pet. Ex. 33. Respondent filed a third supplemental report from Dr.\nRaymond on February 27, 2017. Resp. Ex. S. On May 16, 2017, respondent filed additional\n                                                   2\n\fsupplemental reports from Drs. Venkatesan and Raymond. See Resp. Exs. T, U. Both parties filed\nextensive medical literature referenced by their respective experts.\n\n       The parties discussed settlement of this matter but were unable to resolve the case\ninformally. See, e.g., Resp. Status Rep. dated May 29, 2013 (ECF No. 64); Resp. Status Rep. dated\nApr. 21, 2014 (ECF No. 89); Resp. Status Rep. dated June 30, 2014 (ECF No. 93).\n\n        The parties filed a joint stipulation of facts on December 19, 2014, in which they stated that\nall experts agreed that J.T. had the P525L FUS mutation but disagreed as to the significance of this\nmutation with regard to her alleged vaccine injury. Joint Stipulation of Facts (“Joint Stip.”) dated\nDecember 19, 2014 (ECF No. 109) at 1. The parties further stipulated that J.T.’s genetic testing\nwas completed on November 5, 2009, as Sample ID RB14162, and that the results show “c.1574\nC>T mutation in FUS gene predicts substitution of amino acid leucine at position 525 for the\nnormal amino acid proline.” Id. at 2.\n\n         An entitlement hearing was initially scheduled for February 2014 but was cancelled to allow\nfor the filing of additional expert reports. Prehearing Order dated May 29, 2013 (ECF No. 65). The\nhearing was rescheduled several times thereafter to accommodate the availability of the parties’\nexperts. An entitlement hearing was held on January 25-26, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Drs.\nSteinman and Utz testified on behalf of petitioners, and Drs. Raymond and Venkatesan testified on\nbehalf of respondent. The hearing resumed on March 10, 2017, where Drs. Steinman and Utz again\ntestified on behalf of petitioners. After the hearing, both parties continued to file additional exhibits\nand expert reports until the record was closed on May 25, 2017. See Order dated May 25, 2017\n(ECF No. 164).\n\n          This matter is now ripe for adjudication.\n\n   III.      Issues to be Decided\n\n    The parties dispute two issues: J.T.’s diagnosis and whether the condition was caused by the\nHPV vaccination she received on March 1, 2007. Joint Prehearing Submission (“Joint Sub.”) dated\nApril 4, 2016 (ECF No. 135) at 1-2. Petitioners maintain that the HPV vaccine administered on\nMarch 1, 2007, caused J.T. to develop ADEM. Id. Respondent disagrees that J.T. had ADEM. The\nparties agree that J.T. had a genetic mutation, FUS P525L, which is associated with the\ndevelopment of juvenile ALS (“JALS”).\n\n    The parties also dispute causation. Petitioners assert that J.T.’s HPV vaccination caused her to\nsuffer ADEM. They further assert that “J.T.’s ADEM caused her ALS.” Joint Sub. at 2.\nRespondent disagrees that J.T. had ADEM, or that ADEM played any role in the etiology or clinical\ncourse of J.T.’s ALS. Instead, respondent asserts that J.T.’s ALS was caused by her genetic\nmutation.\n\n   IV.       Medical Summary\n\n             a. Summary of Relevant Facts\n\n       J.T. was born on January 12, 1994. Pet. Ex. 1 at 222. She received the first two doses of the\nGardasil vaccine from her primary care physician, Dr. Cuthbertson, on September 1, 2006, and\n                                                      3\n\fNovember 1, 2006, respectively. Pet. Ex. 1 at 7-9. She received the third dose of the vaccine on\nMarch 1, 2007. Id. at 9.\n\n         On May 24, 2007, J.T., age 13, fell while attempting to jump a hurdle during physical\neducation class. Pet. Ex. 1 at 193. In July 2007, she continued to develop weakness and pain in her\nleft leg and was walking with a limp. Id. By August 2007, she began experiencing right arm\nweakness. Id.\n\n        On August 28, 2007, J.T. saw an orthopedist, Dr. Scott Hoffinger. Pet. Ex. 7 at 40. She had\npain in the anterior and lateral thigh but “no neurological signs or symptoms.” Id. at 39. She had a\n“much harder time getting around with limping,” during the month of August. Id. She was referred\nto physical therapy, but returned to Dr. Hoffinger on October 9, 2007, because she was not better\nand “possibly a little bit worse,” after physical therapy. Id. At that time, Dr. Hoffinger noted that\nshe was weaker, her limp was significantly worse, and her leg muscles had some atrophy. Id. A\nbone scan of J.T.’s spine, pelvis, and lower extremities and MRI of her cervical, thoracic, and\nlumbar spine showed no gross abnormalities. Id. at 33. J.T. returned to Dr. Hoffinger on November\n13, 2007, for a routine follow-up, and on examination he noted that she had some bilateral wasting\nof her hands, with the left hand greater than the right. Pet. Ex. 7 at 33. He also noted decreased\nreflexes in her left lower extremity, and gross muscle atrophy of the left quadriceps and calf\nmuscles. Id. His assessment was “systemic polyneuropathy with gross muscle wasting,” and he\nreferred her to a pediatric neurologist and rheumatologist. Id.\n\n        On November 21, 2007, J.T. presented to pediatric neurologist Dr. Jonathan Strober. Pet.\nEx. 1 at 222-23. Dr. Strober noted that J.T. suffered from “left lower and right upper extremity\nweakness and atrophy with some mild weakness of the right lower extremity.” Id. at 223. EMG\nand nerve conduction studies showed “mixed demyelinative and axonal findings,” and Dr. Strober\nordered a lumbar puncture “to rule out autoimmune conditions such as chronic inflammatory\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy (“CIDP”).” Id. at 224.\n\n        On December 10, 2007, J.T. presented to Dr. Richard Finkel, a neurologist at the Children’s\nHospital of Philadelphia (“CHOP”). Pet. Ex. 3 at 1. She was admitted to CHOP for further\nevaluation and treatment. By that point, she was “unable to walk consistently around school and\nha[d] required a wheelchair for approximately the past [one] week.” Pet. Ex. 3 at 10. J.T. was\ndischarged December 15, 2007, with a diagnosis of CIDP/multifocal motor neuropathy. Id. at 10.\nShe underwent five doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”) therapy. Id. at 11.\n\n        On January 2, 2008, J.T. saw Dr. Strober again, and his records show that her condition had\nfurther deteriorated. Pet. Ex. 1 at 201. She underwent another round of IVIG but showed no\nimprovement. Id. at 197. By the date of her follow up with Dr. Strober on January 16, 2008, she\nwas unable to walk up the stairs and used a scooter to get around at school. Id. Due to her\nworsening condition despite repeated IVIG treatments, Dr. Strober prescribed a course of oral\nsteroids. Id. at 199.\n\n       J.T. was hospitalized at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital from February 4 through 17,\n2008. Pet. Ex. 2 at 822. During this admission, she was thought to have an autoimmune motor\nneuropathy and/or a possible motor neuron disease. Id. EMG testing indicated “pure motor\nneurogenic disorder with axonal features predominating.” Id. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showed\nno signs of inflammation, oligoclonal bands and a normal IgG index. Id. at 823, 846, 864. An MRI\n                                                 4\n\fof her spine showed “loss of the cervical and lumbar enlargements and abnormal P2 signal, most\npredominantly below T8 in the spinal cord,” but no enlargement of the roots. Id. at 823, 835. She\nwas treated with five days of Solu-Medrol IV and three days of plasmapheresis. Id. A right-sided\nquadriceps muscle and sural nerve biopsy was “consistent with a neurogenic muscular pathology\nshowing some group atrophy with compensatory hypertrophy.” Pet. Ex. 2 at 737, 826- 27. During\nthe admission, Dr. Lawrence Steinman, petitioner’s expert, testified that he saw J.T. as a\nconsultant.3 Tr. 108.\n\n        On March 14, 2008, J.T. presented to Dr. Wang complaining of progressive weakness over\nthe past few days, which rendered her unable to stand, even with a walker. Pet. Ex. 1 at 182. J.T.\nwas then admitted to the hospital for a more aggressive regimen of Solu-Medrol and\nplasmapheresis. Id. at 183. On the third day of her hospitalization, J.T. suffered from a seizure.\nPet. Ex. 2 at 683. The attending neurologist noted her diagnosis as “motor neuropathy of unknown\ncause,” and the differential diagnosis could include a possible form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(“ALS”).4 Pet. Ex. 3 at 684. J.T. had another seizure on March 20, 2008. Pet. Ex. 2 at 698. The\nattending rheumatologist ordered continued IVIG, plasmapheresis, “metabolic/genetic/mitochondria\nevaluation STAT,” and consultation with expert Dr. Bob Miller to rule out ALS. Pet. Ex. 2 at 701.\nDr. Miller reluctantly concluded that J.T. had “a pure lower motor neuron syndrome, or progressive\nmuscular atrophy.” Tr. 314-15. He noted that “evidence for an autoimmune dysfunction or\ndemyelinating condition … [was] not convincing.” Id. at 314.\n\n       On April 5, 2008, J.T. saw Dr. Wang and Dr. Frankvich for a follow-up appointment. J.T.\ncontinued to have progressive weakness, and she was undergoing experimental treatment for\nprimary muscular atrophy with lithium and planned to start Riluzole, a drug used to slow the\nprocess of ALS, in one to two weeks’ time. Pet. Ex. 1 at 169-72.\n\n        J.T. saw Dr. Frankovich at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital for a follow-up in the\nPediatric Rheumatology Clinic on April 17, 2008. Dr. Frankovich noted that J.T.’s strength and\nendurance had continued to deteriorate to the point that she was experiencing difficulty feeding\nherself, rolling over at night, and maintaining an upright position. Pet. Ex. 1 at 162. Dr. Frankovich\nnoted that the lab tests did not confirm or refute an underlying autoimmune process. Id. at 165. Dr.\nFrankovich gave J.T. a steroid taper to further decrease her dosage of Prednisone. Id.\n\n        On April 29, 2008, J.T. presented to Dr. Wang for follow-up treatment. At that visit, Dr.\nWang noted that J.T. had previously received the Gardasil vaccination. Dr. Wang wrote, “[I]t is\nuncertain whether this vaccine may have played a role in her motor neuron degeneration.” Pet. Ex.\n1 at 160.\n\n        J.T. saw an ALS specialist, Dr. Catherine Lomen-Hoerth, on April 30, 2008. Pet. Ex. 1 at\n126. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth opined that J.T. had evidence of a “pure lower motor neuron syndrome\nwith the exception of crossed adductor reflexes.” Id. at 128 (parentheticals omitted). She noted that\nJ.T.’s “extensive work-up for a mitochondrial disorder” was negative. Id. Due to her diaphragm\n\n\n3\n While Dr. Steinman testified that he consulted in J.T.’s case during her hospitalization, he did not\nmake or create any medical records, or sign any of J.T.’s records. Tr. 12.\n4\n    See Section IV(e) for a detailed explanation of ALS.\n                                                     5\n\finvolvement, Dr. Lomen-Hoerth suggested that J.T. use a bilevel positive airway pressure\n(“BiPAP”) machine to help her breathe, which she began using on June 6, 2008. Id.\n\n        J.T. returned to Dr. Lomen-Hoerth on August 11, 2008. Her condition had failed to improve\ndespite a “variety of alternative medications and traditional treatments for ALS.” Pet. Ex. 1 at 67.\nHer prognosis was “difficult to determine since in some ways she resemble[d] [spinal muscular\natrophy] patients which may have a better prognosis.” Pet. Ex. 1 at 68. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth ordered\nhospice care for J.T. the same day. Id. at 69.\n\n       On March 9, 2009, J.T. was admitted to the University of California San Francisco Medical\ncenter with respiratory failure, and she subsequently died on March 15, 2009, of an “atypical\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)–like motor neuron disease.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 2. Subsequent\ngenetic testing on J.T. reported on November 5, 2009, by Dr. Robert Brown, Professor and Chair of\nthe Department of Neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, revealed that J.T.\nhad a P525L mutation in FUS exon 15 (“FUS P525L”). Resp. Ex. C at 1-2; Tr. 254.\n\n           b. Autopsy\n\n       On March 16, 2009, an autopsy was conducted by Drs. Lomen-Hoerth, Maurice S. Zwass,\nBradley A. Stohr, and neuropathologist Eric J. Huang, at the University of California San Francisco.\nThey concluded that J.T. died “from an atypical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like lower\nmotor neuron disease leading to respiratory failure.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 1.\n\n         There were three principle neuropathological findings: (1) extensive “macrophage5\ninfiltrates, lymphocytic6 infiltrates, and severe astrogliosis7 in the affected regions of the spinal\ncord,” attributed to “an extensive demyelinating8 process involving the anterior and lateral columns9\n\n5\n Macrophages are mononuclear phagocytes, which kill and ingest particulate matter and\nmicroorganisms. They also play a role in the “digestion and presentation of T and B lymphocytes.”\nDorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary (“Dorland’s”), 32nd Ed. (2012) at 1093, 1423.\n6\n Lymphocytes are mononuclear leukocytes, which make up the body’s immune cells, and are\ndivided into two classes: T and B lymphocytes. Dorland’s at 1084.\n7\n Astrogliosis, or gliosis, is an “excess of astroglia [astrocytes are collectively referred to as\nastroglia] in damaged areas of the central nervous system.” Dorland’s at 784. Astrocytes are\nneuroglial cells, which make up the supporting structure of nervous tissue. Id. at 1265.\n8\n Myelin is “the substance of the cell membrane of Schwann cells that coils to form the myelin\nsheath,” which is made up of proteins and acts as an “electrical insulator.” Dorland’s at 1218. The\nprocess of demyelination occurs when the myelin sheath is destroyed. Id.\n9\n  The anterior column of the spinal cord is “the anterior portion of the gray substance of the spinal\ncord; it contains neurons that innervate the skeletal muscles of the neck, trunk, and limbs. In\ntransverse section it is seen as a horn.” Dorland’s at 390. The lateral column is the intermediate\ncolumn of the spinal cord; it is “the lateral portion of the gray matter of the spinal cord, extending\nfrom the second thoracic to the first lumbar segment of the spinal cord; in transverse section it is\nseen as a horn.” Id.\n                                                     6\n\fat all levels of the spinal cord;” (2) “severe loss of motor neurons,”10 at all levels of the spinal cord;\nand (3) cytoplasmic inclusions11 in scattered neurons in the cortex, medulla oblongata and spinal\ncord. Pet. Ex. 6 at 7.\n\n       In addition to the three principle findings, the neuropathologist also wrote a lengthy\ndescription of the findings related to the spinal cord, stating in pertinent part:\n\n        The principal findings in the spinal cord are extensive demyelination involving the\n        anterior column, lateral column and anterior horn. There are macrophage infiltrates,\n        lymphocytic infiltrates and severe astrogliosis in the affected regions of the spinal\n        cord. Many of the inflammatory infiltrates are identified around blood vessels.\n        These findings are present at all levels of the spinal cord. Although the\n        demyelination does not appear to involve the posterior column, scattered\n        macrophages and lymphocytes are also identified in the posterior column. The\n        anterior horn of the spinal cord at all levels shows a severe loss of motor neurons.\n        Furthermore, all anterior nerve roots emanating from the ventral aspect of the spinal\n        cord show extensive loss of axons and marked demyelination. All of the lesions in\n        the spinal cord appear to be the same age.\n\nPet. Ex. 6 at 7.\n\n         In addition, the pathologists suggest that the progressive neurological disease was “mediated\nby immune responses leading to extensive demyelination in the spinal cord.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 8. They\ndescribe two examples of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases that had some of the\nneuropathological features seen in the autopsy, including ADEM and multiple sclerosis (“MS”). Id.\nHowever, they note that MS rarely presents in patients younger than age 15, and that ADEM affects\nadolescents. As for ADEM they stated, “Due to the rapid progressive nature of ADEM, the\npathological features are typically of the same age, and are frequently characterized by perivascular\ncuffing of macrophages, diffuse demyelination, and macrophage and lymphocytic infiltrates.\nAstrogliosis can be detected in ADEM, but [it is] usually not as robust as that seen in chronic MS\nlesions.” Id. at 9. The pathologists did not, however, conclude that J.T. had either MS or ADEM.\nJ.T.’s final diagnosis was “atypical progressive lower motor neuron disease,” or “atypical ALS.”\nId.\n\n        A list of references was included in the autopsy. Some of these references discussed\nneuropathological findings seen in motor neuron diseases (ALS) and demyelinating diseases\n(principally MS). Greenfield’s Neuropathology Text describes the findings seen in J.T.’s autopsy\nas consistent with motor neuron diseases (ALS). ALS is characterized by loss of motor neurons and\nsurviving neurons may contain inclusion bodies. Pet. Ex. 69 at 959. As for myelin abnormalities\n\n10\n  Neurons are “any of the conducting cells of the nervous system. A typical neuron consists of a\ncell body, containing the nucleus and the surrounding cytoplasm (perikaryon); several short\nradiating processes (dendrites); and one long process (the axon), which terminates in twig-like\nbranches [ ] and may have branches [ ] projecting along its course.” Dorland’s at 1267.\n11\n  Cell inclusions are “usually lifeless, often temporary, constituent[s] of the cytoplasm of a cell,\nsuch as an accumulation of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, pigments, secretory granules, crystals, or\nother insoluble components.” Dorland’s at 928.\n                                                   7\n\fseen in ALS, Greenfield’s explains, “white matter of the spinal cord shows myelin loss in the\ncorticospinal tracts associated with astrocytic gliosis and accumulation of microglial macrophages.”\nId.\n\n        Similar findings are also described in demyelinating conditions, specifically MS. In the\nTextbook of Neuropathology, Raine explains that MS is characterized by “selective loss of myelin\nwith relative sparing of axons.” Pet. Ex. 68 at 627. Acute MS is characterized by myelin pallor,\nlesions that are “intensely inflammatory with small mononuclear cells,” perivascular cuffing,\nmacrophages, and T cell involvement in lesions. Id. at 669.\n\n         c.    Dr. Eric J. Huang’s Article12\n\n        Approximately one year after J.T.’s death, Dr. Huang and colleagues presented J.T.’s case,\nalong with one other case, in an article entitled “Extensive FUS-Immunoreactive Pathology in\nJuvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Basophilic Inclusions.” Pet. Ex. 9 at 1. The autopsies\nfrom both cases revealed a severe loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Many of the remaining\nneurons contained “intra-cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions.” Id. at 3. Immunohistochemistry\nstaining revealed that these “basophilic inclusions were strongly positive for FUS.” Id. Basophilic\ninclusions were also found in parts of the cerebral cortex and medullar oblongata. Id. The\n“abnormal FUS protein accumulations” (basophilic inclusions) were noted to be “the most striking\nfinding,” underscoring “the critical role of abnormal FUS protein accumulations in [JALS].” Id.\n\n       As for the white matter13 pathology, the authors suggested it may be “a manifestation of the\ndisease process in rapidly progressive ALS.” Id. at 8. They stated that future studies are needed to\ndetermine the significance of the “white matter pathology” in FUS/ALS patients. Id. Unlike J.T.’s\nautopsy report, in the article there is no suggestion of an immune-mediated response or reference to\nADEM or MS.\n\n         d.    Dr. Huang’s Letter, July 2, 2011\n\n        More than two years after J.T.’s death, and in response to an apparent inquiry from\npetitioner’s counsel, Dr. Huang wrote the following letter, dated July 2, 2011, to Mr. Cohan:\n\n       This letter is in response to your request to opine on whether the case study entitled\n       “Extensive FUS-Immunoreactive Pathology in Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral\n       Sclerosis with Basophilic Inclusions” analyzed whether Gardasil was a contributing\n       factor in causing [J.T.]’s juvenile ALS.\n\n       To answer your inquiry, while our study did initially consider Gardasil as a potential\n       contributing factor in causing [J.T.]’s juvenile ALS, we were unable to reach any\n       definitive conclusion on that issue. The hypothesis that Gardasil may have\n\n12\n  Huang, Eric J., Extensive FUS-Immunoreactive Pathology in Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral\nSclerosis with Basophilic Inclusions, 20 BRAIN PATHOLOGY 1 (2010) [Pet. Ex. 9].\n13\n   White matter is “the white nervous tissue, constituting the conducting portion of the brain and\nspinal cord; it is composed mostly of myelinated nerve fibers arranged in anterior, posterior, and\nlater funiculi in the spinal cord and in a number of named fasciculi in the brain.” Dorland’s at 1793.\n                                                   8\n\f        contributed in some way to [J.T.]’s disease was based on a number of case reports on\n        the adverse effects of Gardasil in the central nervous system and, in [J.T.]’s case, the\n        temporal relationship of the onset of juvenile ALS after the administration of the\n        Gardasil vaccination. Due to the difficulty to establish a direct cause-effect\n        relationship, however, we decided to focus our study on the neuropathological\n        features of [J.T.]’s disease. In my opinion, Gardasil may still have a plausible role in\n        the initiation and/or progression of [J.T.’s] condition, but it was not within the\n        purview of our study to examine whether such a mechanism may have contributed to\n        [J.T.]’s juvenile ALS. Nonetheless, it was our determination that the causal and/or\n        contributing role of Gardasil in juvenile ALS should be examined in additional\n        studies.\n\nPet. Ex. 11 at 1.\n\n          e.    ALS\n\n        There is no disagreement about whether J.T. suffered from ALS, and indeed, the parties\nstipulate to that fact. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a “devastating and universally\nfatal neurodegenerative disorder,” that “primarily affects motor neurons (“MNs”) and has no\neffective treatment.” Pet. Ex. 62 at 1. ALS is a “progressive degenerative disease of the motor\nsystems.” Resp. Ex. F4 at 1. The disease is characterized by a “progressive loss of motor neurons,”\nand ultimately leads to paralysis. Tr. 19, 243. Upper motor neurons are those “in [the] brain or\nbrain stem that feed to [ ] other motor neurons and both excite and inhibit them. Id. at 244. Lower\nmotor neurons are those in “the spinal cord that actually project right out to the muscles\nthemselves.” Id. ALS results in death or degeneration of these motor neurons. Id. There can be\nboth upper and lower motor neuron involvement. Resp. Ex. F4 at 271. The disease typically\npresents as muscle atrophy which progresses to upper motor neuron involvement and respiratory\ninsufficiency. Id. at 274.\n\n        There is no cure for ALS, and while disease progression can be slowed, patients eventually\nsuccumb to respiratory failure. Resp. Ex. F4 at 274-75. Fifty percent of patients die within three\nyears of diagnosis, though the time frame may be altered based on age of onset. Id. at 271. While\nthe disease is typically seen in older individuals, ALS which occurs prior to age 25 is defined as\n“juvenile ALS,” or “JALS.” Tr. 244. There is no specific laboratory test for ALS, which makes\ndiagnosis challenging, especially early in the disease course. Resp. Ex. F4 at 272. Typically,\ndenervation and decreased response to nerve stimuli are seen in patients with ALS. Id.\nAdditionally, many patients present with wasting of the hand muscles. Id.\n\n        Approximately ten percent of ALS is associated with genetic mutations. Tr. 257. One of\nthese mutations is the fused in sarcoma (“FUS”) mutation. This mutation was first identified\nthrough its association with cancer, specifically sarcoma, where it escalates growth of cancer cells.\nId. at 255. The mutation is now found in a variety of diseases. Resp. Ex. D at 4. As it relates to\nALS, FUS mutations cause protein to build up in the cytoplasm of cells, instead of being properly\nlocalized in the nucleus. Tr. 257. The protein that builds up in the cytoplasm is believed to\nadversely impact protein synthesis. Id. at 246-48.\n\n       With regard to JALS, over 50 mutations have been found to be associated with the disease.\nOne of these is FUS P525L, the mutation identified in J.T. Tr. 263-64; 260-61. This specific\n                                                   9\n\fmutation and its association with JALS was first referenced in the literature in 2009. See Resp. Ex.\nD6;14 Resp. Ex. E6.15 “Patients with the FUS P525L mutation, most of whom are female,\nreportedly display a specific ALS phenotype characterized by a severe course, early disease onset,\nrapid disease onset, rapid disease progression, multiple system degeneration and the presence of\nbasophilic inclusions.” Pet. Ex. 62 at 7. In the P525L mutation, the 525th amino acid, a proline, is\nchanged to a leucine due to an altered base pair. Resp. Ex. D at 4. This causes the FUS protein to\nmisfold and mislocalize. Tr. at 107. Rather than being in the nucleus, it is instead found in the\ncytoplasm of a cell. Id. It has been hypothesized that the misfolded FUS proteins “inhibit normal\nRNA and protein synthesis and thereby suppress[] neuronal functions and survival,” resulting in\nneuron cell death, which is characteristic of the disease. Resp. Ex. F at 8; Tr. 107.\n\n         f.    ADEM\n\n        In contrast, “[a]cute disseminated encephalomyelitis (“ADEM”) is an immune-mediated\ninflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, which is typically transitory and self-limited.”\nResp. Ex. F at 3. “It is characterized by an acute or subacute encephalopathy … and MRI evidence\nof widespread demyelination that predominantly involves the white matter of the brain and spinal\ncord. It is presumed to be secondary to an immune response following a viral infection or\nvaccination.” Id. Initial findings of ADEM usually begin within two days to four weeks after the\nexposure to the inciting event. Id. “It often presents with systemic symptoms such as fever,\nmalaise, headache, and vomiting which occur shortly before the appearance of neurological\nsymptoms and signs. The clinical course is rapidly progressive, developing maximum deficits\nwithin a few days (mean 4.5 days).” Id. “A wide variety of neurological deficits have been\ndescribed in children with ADEM including obtundation and depressed consciousness; long tract\nsigns; ataxia;16 spinal cord involvement; visual involvement; [and] speech impairment or aphasia.\nFocal motor seizures have been reported.” Id. MRI is the most sensitive marker of acute\ndemyelination, showing lesions. Id.\n\n    Recovery from ADEM is usually complete, especially in children. Resp. Ex. F at 4. The\nclinical criteria for the diagnosis of ADEM are: (1) an acute or subacute encephalopathy with\npolyfocal deficits and widespread hyperintense lesions (seen on MRI) affecting the CNS white\nmatter; (2) “no evidence of previous destructive white matter changes … present on MRI[;]” and (3)\n“no history of a previous clinical episode with features of a demyelinating event.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n Caroline Vance, et al., Mutation in FUS, an RNA Processing Protein, Cause Familial\n14\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Type 6, 323 SCI 1208 (2009) [Resp.

He obtained his M.D. from Stanford University\nand completed his residency at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Prior to\nteaching at Stanford, Dr. Utz also taught at Harvard Medical School. Id. He served as the director\nof Stanford’s Center for Clinical Immunology from June 2007 until November 2008. Pet. Ex. 49 at\n2. Dr. Utz received a grant from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to study the immune\nsystem’s response to the influenza vaccine. Pet. Ex. 21 at 2. He was involved in vaccine\ndevelopment for both multiple sclerosis and juvenile arthritis and is well-published in the areas of\nimmunology and rheumatology. Id. at 1-2. Dr. Utz routinely sees patients with a variety of\nneuroinfectious and neuroimmunological diseases, and he has cared for patients with ADEM and\nADEM-like illnesses. Resp. Ex. E at 1; Tr. 147. Because Dr. Utz specializes in immunology and\nrheumatology, he is very familiar with the diagnosis of ALS, as he often rules it out as a diagnosis\nfrom other systemic rheumatic diseases. Tr. 147. While he typically does not treat patients for\nALS, he has seen patients who have the disease.\n\n         b.    Respondent’s Experts\n\n                   i.

To do so, they must establish, by preponderant evidence:\n(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccine and her injury (“Althen Prong One”); (2) a\nlogical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccine was the reason for her injury (“Althen\nProng Two”); and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between the vaccine and her\ninjury (“Althen Prong Three”). §300aa–13(a)(1); Althen v.

Expert Opinions\n\n                     i. Petitioners’ Expert, Dr. Lawrence Steinman\n\n                           1. Diagnosis\n\n        Dr. Steinman emphasized that an immune response in the form of widespread inflammation\nin J.T.’s spinal cord was found outside of the areas that ALS affects, placing the pathology outside\nof ALS alone and indicating the presence of a secondary condition, ADEM. Pet. Ex. 20 at 1, 14.\nHe opined, “ALS does not explain how lymphocytes infiltrated far outside the boundaries seen in\nALS. The mutation does not explain why the pathologists … considered … ADEM as the leading\n[diagnosis].” Id. at 15. For these reasons, Dr. Steinman believes that J.T.’s correct diagnosis is\nboth ADEM and ALS.\n\n                                   a. Autopsy\n\n        Dr. Steinman’s opinion, in large part, turns on the neuropathology findings consistent with\ninflammation, and the comparison to ADEM, an immune-mediated condition. More specifically,\nDr. Steinman opined that the finding of “macrophage infiltrates, lymphocytic infiltrates, and severe\nastrogliosis,” as well as lesions appearing to be the same age, is “hallmark” for ADEM. Tr. 32\n(citing Pet. Ex. 6 at 7). Dr. Steinman agrees that the loss of neurons and basophilic inclusions\ndescribed in the autopsy report are due to the FUS P525L mutation and not ADEM. Tr. 129\n\n                                   b. Clinical Course\n\n        Dr. Steinman was a consultant on the team of doctors who cared for J.T. during her\nhospitalization in February 2008. Tr. 12-14. At that time, the physicians believed that J.T. had a\nneuroinflammatory disease, an inflammatory neuropathy, and possibly a motor neuron disease like\nALS.17 Tr. 100. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (“CIDP”) was considered as\na differential diagnosis. Id. at 23-24. Although a neuroinflammatory disease was also considered,\nDr. Steinman conceded that no one ever diagnosed J.T. with ADEM at any time during her hospital\ncourse. In fact, Dr. Steinman agreed that no one diagnosed J.T. with ADEM while she was alive.\nId. at 25. The only encephalopathic manifestation that J.T. had was a seizure. Tr. 83-84. Dr.\nSteinman did not attribute J.T.’s seizure to inflammation. Id. at 24. Moreover, J.T.’s seizure (or\nseizures) did not lead her physicians to a differential diagnosis of ADEM. Id. at 84. Instead, she\nwas diagnosed with ALS. Id. at 25.\n\n        As for diagnostic tests, Dr. Steinman conceded that J.T.’s EMG did not reveal findings\nconsistent with ADEM, but it did show motor and axonal involvement consistent with ALS. Tr.\n101-03. Similarly, J.T.’s cerebrospinal fluid did not show increased protein, which could be seen in\nADEM, and thus, the results were more consistent with ALS. Id. 105. MRIs of J.T.’s brain and\nspine were also consistent with ALS, and not ADEM. Id. at 105-06; 110-11. Moreover, J.T. did\nnot have the response to steroids, IVIG, or plasmapheresis Dr. Steinman would have anticipated if\nshe had ADEM; he would have expected a better response with improvement in her condition. Id.\nat 112-14.\n\n17\n     The attending physician during this admission was Dr. Ching Wang. Tr. 101.\n\n                                                 14\n\f                           2. Causation Theory\n\n        Dr. Steinman proposed a causation theory best explained in several steps.18 First, he opined\nthat the HPV vaccine triggered J.T.’s ADEM via the mechanism of molecular mimicry. Pet. Ex. 20\nat 1, 30; Tr. 16, 19. The description of the lesions being the same age indicates a “thunderclap”\nevent, or trigger, which Dr. Steinman believed to be the vaccine. Tr. 32-33.\n\n        The second part of Dr. Steinman’s theory relates to how ADEM caused J.T.’s ALS, and he\nalso discussed the role of the FUS mutation in causing ALS. Dr. Steinman testified that J.T.’s FUS\nmutation “made her motor neurons vulnerable to injury.” Tr. 469. He opined that the Gardasil\nvaccine likely caused damage to the motor neurons, which were already vulnerable from the FUS\nmutation. Tr. 469-71. The ADEM in turn triggered J.T.’s “fulminant course” of ALS. Pet. Ex. 20\nat 1; Tr. 16. According to Dr. Steinman, this theory is supported both by the medical literature and\nby J.T.’s autopsy report. Pet. Ex. 20 at 1. Scientific literature has “strong support … for how [HPV\nvaccine] can induce ADEM.” Id.\n\n       Dr. Steinman also testified regarding the temporal association between J.T.’s receipt of the\nGardasil vaccination and her subsequent alleged development of ADEM and then ALS.\n\n                                  a. Gardasil Vaccination Triggered ADEM via Molecular\n                                     Mimicry\n\n         Molecular mimicry occurs when there is structural similarity between a self-protein and a\nforeign-protein triggering an immune response that attacks the body’s own cells. Pet. Ex. 14 at 6-7;\nTr. 39. This structural similarity is due to homologous amino acid sequences located at the binding\nsite of the protein, the portion of the protein that triggers T-cell recognition. Pet. Ex. 14 at 6, 9.\nForeign proteins, “presented by the [human leukocyte antigen] molecules21 of the immune system,”\n“provoke[] the T cells to attack body tissues that contain the self-antigens. Pet. Ex. 18C at 109.22\nSpecifically, Dr. Steinman asserts that the HPV vaccine has been shown to have structural similarity\nto myelin basic protein (“MBP”) as well as aquaporin type 4 (“AQP4”). Pet. Ex. 14 at 9 and 13.\n\n                                           i. Myelin Basic Protein (“MBP”)\n\n       Dr. Steinman opines that there is sufficient homology between the Gardasil vaccine and “the\nmain constituents of the myelin sheath [i.e. MBP] to trigger a neuroinflammatory condition like\n\n\n18\n  Dr. Steinman briefly testified as to a possible second theory, that the aluminum adjuvant in the\nvaccine “stirred up” J.T.’s immune system and “push[ed] things over the edge.” Tr. 472. This\npotential theory was not well developed by petitioners. To the extent that petitioners offer this as\nanother causal theory, I find it unsupported by preponderant evidence.\n21\n  Leukocyte antigens are “a group of glycoproteins, antigenically similar but of different molecular\nweights, found on B cells, T cells, thymocytes, and leukopoietic cells.” Dorland’s at 105.\n22\n  For a more detailed explanation of the theory of molecular mimicry, see Pet. Ex. 32G and Resp.\nEx. R.\n\n                                                  15\n\fADEM.” Tr. 17. He cites an article by Wucherpfennig et al.23 showing that HPV, like many other\nviruses, shares “molecular similarities” with MBP between amino acids 82 and 98. Pet. Ex. 20 at 5.\nThe study demonstrates that MBP shares an amino acid sequence with HPV types 7 and 13.24 Pet.\nEx. 14 at 10-11.\n\n        Dr. Steinman also described alleged key sequences of MBP and HPV type 11 that have\nhomologies. Pet. Ex. 31 at 6. Within a 12 amino acid sequence, there is a three sequential amino\nacid homology and two isolated single amino acid homologies. Id. For HPV type 18, Dr. Steinman\nasserted “there are two matches, one with [three] amino acids and a second region with [three]\nconsecutive amino acids.” Id. at 7. In comparison, there is only a two amino acid homology,\nphenylalanine and lysine, between MBP and the L1 protein of HPV type 16. Pet. Ex. 20 at 7-8.\nBut, Dr. Steinman explains, these amino acids are “the key anchors to the HLA molecule and to the\nT cell receptors.” Id. at 8; Pet. Ex. 18B.\n\n        While Wucherpfennig examined the amino acid sequence necessary to cause antibodies to\nattack the brain, not the spinal cord, Dr. Steinman hypothesized that the process would work\nidentically in the spinal cord. Tr. 41. Other studies cited by Dr. Steinman demonstrate that five or\nsix amino acids were adequate to induce the animal model of ADEM in mice.27 Dr. Steinman\nconcedes, however, that no one can “say with absolute certainty… that the vaccine has enough\n[homology] to cause ADEM in a human.” Id.\n\n        Because of the cross-reactivity shown in his submitted literature, Dr. Steinman believes\n“[a]n immunization to Gardasil could thus… trigger brain inflammation.” Pet. Ex. 20 at 6. He also\nintroduced a study by Pohl-Kappe et al.28 describing “immunity to myelin basic protein in ADEM.”\nPet. Ex. 20 at 13. He opined that “[m]olecular mimicry is the scientific concept that best explains\nhow Gardasil can trigger ADEM.” Pet. Ex. 20 at 9.\n\n                                         ii. Aquaporin Type 4 (“AQP4”)\n\n       AQP4 is a water channel found in the astrocytes of the blood-brain barrier (“BBB”). Pet.\nEx. 14 at 13; Pet. Ex. 18G at 1991. Dr. Steinman opines that changes to astrocytes and the BBB are\n\n23\n   Kai W.

Dr. Steinman believes\nthat homology to the self-proteins in AQP4 “trigger[ed] a neuroinflammatory condition.” Tr. 17.\n\n        In support of this opinion, Dr. Steinman cited a study performed by Menge et al29 showing\nthree homologous amino acid sequences between AQP4 and HPV types 16 and 18. Pet. Ex. 14 at\n13 (citing Pet. Ex. 18H). Dr. Steinman believes there is “striking cross-reactivity” between AQP4\nand the protein in HPV type 16. Pet. Ex. 20 at 12.\n\n        Dr. Steinman cited another study, performed by Bataveljic et al.,30 in support of the\nsignificance of AQP4 in ALS. Pet. Ex. 14 at 18. The study found that there was increased\nexpression of AQP4 in the brainstem and cortex of rats with the SOD1 gene mutation31 model of\nALS. Pet. Ex. 18G at 1991. The authors of the study hypothesized that the changes in AQP4\nchannels could affect the BBB “disturbing the neuronal microenvironment, and causing motor\nneuronal dysfunction and death.” Id. However, the authors did not discuss homology between\nHPV, or the HPV vaccine, and AQP4, or draw any conclusions about whether impairment in the\nBBB may contribute to the cause of ALS. Moreover, they cautioned against attributing too much\nsignificance to AQP4 alone in the impairment of the BBB. Pet. Ex. 18G at 2001.\n\n        Dr. Steinman testified about his concern that Dr. Huang, the neuropathologist for J.T.’s\nautopsy, never addressed the autopsy findings consistent with ADEM in the paper he later\npublished. 32 Tr. 51. The suggestion of an immune-mediated condition referenced in J.T.’s autopsy\nis not discussed in Dr. Huang’s article. Id. 51-52. Instead, Dr. Huang’s article focuses on the\nfinding of basophilic inclusions. Id. at 52. Dr. Steinman believes that the ADEM findings are too\nimportant to be ignored in any discussion of J.T.’s pathology. Id. at 55. He also believes it is\nsignificant that no other paper that discusses FUS/ALS mentions ADEM-like pathological findings.\nId. at 50, 56-57. He argues that since the literature regarding juvenile ALS in the context of FUS\nP525L gene mutations does not discuss ADEM-like findings, the pathology in J.T.’s case is even\n“more unusual.” For these reasons he is persuaded that “[J.T.] suffered from a two-hit scenario …\ninvolving ADEM and ALS.” Pet. Ex. 31 at 2.\n\n\n                                  b. J.T.’s ADEM Triggered Her ALS\n\n       Dr. Steinman opined that ADEM “was the trigger” that “either provoked or worsened the\ncourse of [J.T.’s] ALS.” Pet. Ex. 20 at 1. He posited that “ALS was triggered from an autoimmune\n\n29\n Til Menge et al., Neuromyelitis optica following human papillomavirus vaccination, 79\nNEUROLOGY 285 (2012) [Pet.

In mounting a response\nto the Gardasil vaccine, Dr. Steinman testified that a “cascade of events” occurred in J.T.’s immune\nsystem which led to “the immune destruction of [J.T.’s] motor neuron system.” Id. at 2. He also\nopined that “[t]here is striking cross-reactivity between AQP4 and the L1 protein of HPV type 16,”\nwhich is found in the Gardasil vaccine. Id. at 12. He thus posited that “Vaccination with Gardasil\ntriggered immunity to … AQP4 and this led to the triggering of ALS and ADEM…” Id.\n\n        Dr. Steinman testified that “Aquaporin-4 is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS.” Pet. Ex.\n14 at 18. He cited studies by Appel, Gussoni, and Panzara,33 which suggest evidence of adaptive\nimmunity in the spinal cord fluid of patients with ALS. While those findings suggest that\nimmunological processes may play a role in the etiology or progression of ALS, they fail to provide\npersuasive evidence that the HPV vaccine or ADEM, either alone, or in concert, cause ALS or\nworsen its course. See Pet. Ex. 20 at 14-15.\n\n        For example, in Panzara, a study cited by Dr. Steinman which describes autopsies of patients\nwho succumbed to ALS, the authors found inflammatory infiltrates in the spinal cord, raising the\npossibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron degeneration. Pet. Ex. 18A at 392. But\nthe authors drew no conclusions, instead recommending further studies to determine the role of\nautoimmunity in the pathogenesis of ALS. Id. at 403.\n\n                                 c. The Role of the FUS Mutation in J.T.’s Development of\n                                    ALS\n\n        Dr. Steinman readily conceded that J.T. had ALS and that she was born with the FUS P525L\nmutation. Tr. 72. And while he opined that the HPV vaccine triggered J.T.’s ALS, he did not offer\nan opinion on whether J.T. would have lived longer had she not been vaccinated. Id. at 77-78.\nRather, he “explicitly [doesn’t] know whether it hastened her course or not.” Id. at 88. He cited a\ncase by Sproviero34 describing a patient with the P525L FUS mutation who did not develop ALS\nuntil age 44, after a battle with MS. Id. at 476. He opined that other patients with the P525L FUS\nmutation may have had a trigger for their ALS, but he suggests that since the articles describing\nthem were mainly focused on the mutation itself, a trigger was never discussed. Id. at 478. Dr.\nSteinman also testified that insufficient numbers of people have been tested to determine whether a\nperson can have the FUS mutation and not have ALS. Id. at 59-60. He would prefer to see genetic\ntest results from “a few million people” to feel comfortable definitively concluding that the FUS\nP525L mutation will always cause ALS. Tr. 483-84. He dismissed the fact that the mutation has\nnever been found in a healthy individual. Id. at 482-83. Dr. Steinman ultimately conceded,\nhowever, that there is no evidence to date that FUS is present in healthy people. Id. at 77.\n\n33\n  Nathan P. Staff & Stanley H.

While the presence of neuroinflammation is not debated, Dr. Steinman agreed it was\nunclear from the current medical literature whether the inflammation initiates or is a consequence of\nneuron death seen in ALS. Tr. 108.\n\n         In Graves, the authors noted inflammation in the spinal cord and brain, suggesting mediation\nby activated macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. Citing Hayashi, 37 the authors suggest that\n“macrophages, present in ALS tissue [may] function as [ ] phagocytes,38 removing myelin debris,\nleft as axons degenerate…” Pet. Ex. 36 at 335. They conclude that “[f]urther studies are needed to\ninvestigate the initiating cause of inflammation.” Id. at 336.\n\n         Hooten and colleagues suggested that there are two stages of neuroinflammation in ALS, the\nfirst being protective and the second neurotoxic. Pet. Ex. 39. A more recent article by Staff and\nAppel39 summarized the consensus of the literature regarding neuroinflammation in ALS. The\nauthors stated that “It is unclear at this point how and when the immune system impacts the course\nof disease in ALS patients.” Pet. Ex. 37 at 335.\n\n        Dr. Steinman also submitted evidence of the innate immune system’s response to the\nGardasil vaccine. Pet. Ex. 14 at 14-15. After vaccination with Gardasil, participants in a study\ndemonstrated increased expression of immune system receptors. Id. at 14 (citing Pet. Ex. 18I).\nThis increased expression is the desired effect since it means the immune system is creating\nantibodies to defend against HPV. Id. Dr. Steinman believes that innate immune system activation\nis notable because it has been shown in patients with ALS. Id. (citing Pet. Exs. 18A, 18J).\nHowever, Dr. Steinman did not cite or submit any literature to support the idea that the FUS P525L\nmutation can be triggered by an immune stimulus.

Tr. 75. The time frame from J.T.’s first symptom of\nALS until her death was 22 months. Id. at 77. Finally, Dr. Steinman conceded that J.T.’s FUS\nP525L mutation could have caused her ALS without any vaccine trigger, and that J.T. would have\neventually had ALS, although he could not say when. Id. at 140-41.40\n\n                                   d. Onset\n\n        Dr. Steinman opined that the temporal interval between J.T.’s vaccination, on March 1,\n2007, and the onset of motor weakness nearly three months after vaccination, when she had a\nhurdling injury on May 24, 2007, is appropriate. Pet. Ex. 14 at 16; Pet Ex. 33 at 1. While it can be\ndifficult to cite the specific onset of “something you’re born with,” Dr. Steinman stated that J.T.’s\ntrack accident was an appropriate indicator for both the onset of ADEM and ALS. Tr. 80-81, 83.\n\n       Dr. Steinman referenced an article by Menge et al.41 describing three cases in which\nneuromyelitis optica (“NMO”)42 occurred between four and five months after HPV vaccination.\nPet. Ex. 33 at 2. Thus, a three month interval, as seen in J.T.’s case, would be well within the time\nframe for the onset of a CNS degenerative disorder after vaccination. Pet. Ex. 33 at 2.\n\n                   ii. Petitioners’ Expert, Dr. Paul Utz\n\n                           1. Diagnosis\n\n         Similar to Dr. Steinman, Dr. Utz opined that J.T. suffered from two neurological diseases:\n(1) a sudden onset autoimmune demyelinating syndrome43 and (2) an inherited form of ALS. Pet.\nEx. 21 at 2. Dr. Utz believes J.T. had an autoimmune demyelinating condition for two reasons.\nFirst, J.T. had a previous history of another autoimmune disorder, pityriasis,44 which increased her\nrisk of developing another autoimmune disease. Pet. Ex. 21 at 6. Second, Dr. Utz stated that that\nJ.T.’s autopsy results indicate an autoimmune demyelinating event, specifically with regard to the\n\n\n40\n  Dr. Steinman later testified, however, that he did not believe J.T.’s ALS would have occurred\nwithout a “second-hit.” Tr. 476.\n\n Til Menge et al., Neuromyelitis Optica Following Human Papillomavirus Vaccination, 79\n41\n\nNEUROLOGY 285 [Pet. Ex. 18h; Resp. Ex. F22].\n42\n   Menge explains, however, that NMO is an autoimmune demyelinating condition, like ADEM.\nSee Pet. Ex. 18H at 287. However, ALS is a motor neuron disorder, not a demyelinating disorder\nlike NMO.\n43\n  Unlike Dr. Steinman, Dr. Utz did not specify which specific autoimmune inflammatory condition\nhe believed J.T. had but testified that these conditions include “ADEM, CIDP, vasculitis, transverse\nmyelitis,” and others. Tr. 158. He conceded there was no reference to ADEM in J.T.’s medical\nrecord. Id. at 163.\n44\n   Pityriasis is a skin disease that is characterized by the formation of fine, branny scales. Dorland’s\nat 1451. “Branny” means “resembling bran; rough, scaly, dry.” Id. at 248.\n\n                                                  20\n\flesions of the same age and the evidence of widespread involvement of the CNS. Id. Dr. Utz based\nhis opinions in part on test results and autopsy findings.\n\n                                    a. Test Results\n\n        Dr. Utz testified that J.T. had low titer antinuclear antibodies45 (“ANA”) with a speckled\npattern, a positive antiphospholipid test,46 and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate47 (“ESR”),\nall of which indicate an autoimmune/inflammatory condition. Pet. Ex. 21 at 10. Specifically, the\nANA, while only “weakly positive,” was “more consistent with diseases caused by inflammation,”\nand “often seen in autoimmune diseases.” Tr. 161. Dr. Utz also testified that J.T.’s\nantiphospholipid test was positive at least twice, and possibly three times, in the “moderately\nabnormal range.” Id. at 162. He noted that while the ESR is a “relatively nonspecific test that’s\nelevated when there is inflammation in general,” it was elevated even while J.T. was receiving\nimmunosuppressive drugs that should have decreased any inflammation. Id. at 159-60, 162. Dr.\nUtz opined that the physicians who treated J.T. concluded from the test results that she had an\ninflammatory condition, which Dr. Utz testified is consistent with his proposition. Id. at 159. Since\nthe only trigger he could find in her records was the Gardasil vaccine, he concluded that the vaccine\nwas the triggering event of the demyelinating disease that eventually resulted in J.T.’s death. Pet.\nEx. 21 at 11.\n\n                                    b. Autopsy Results\n\n       Dr. Utz testified that J.T.’s autopsy further supports his opinion because it indicated that she\nsuffered from an autoimmune demyelinating disorder while also showing “many inconsistencies…\nfor FUS-related ALS.” Tr. 164. In his opinion, the fact that the lesions visualized were all of the\nsame age indicated a “discrete, single, inciting event…much more typical for ADEM… [and] not\ndescribed in… FUS/ALS.” Pet. Ex. 21 at 7; Tr. 167.\n\n       Additionally, T-cell infiltration seen in J.T.’s autopsy has been shown in animal models to\ncause destruction of the myelin surrounding axon sheaths. Pet. Ex. 21 at 7. Dr. Utz agreed,\nhowever, that lymphocytes are found in the central nervous system (“CNS”) in both ADEM and\nALS. Tr. 164-65. The fact that the pathologists did a second stain to differentiate between T cells\n\n45\n     Antinuclear antibodies are “antibodies directed against nuclear antigens.” Dorland’s at 101.\n46\n  An antiphospholipid test is used to detect the presence of antiphospholipid autoantibodies, which\nare “primary markers for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [and] are linked to increase risk of\nthrombosis … [and] thrombocytopenia.” Julius M. Cruse & Robert E. Lewis, Illustrated Dictionary\nof Immunology, (3rd Ed. (2009)), at 572. The autoantibodies include “those specific for cardiolipin,\nphosphatidylserine, and lupus,” and they are “present in individuals with antiphospholipid antibody\nsyndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, drug-induced disorders, and infectious and\nneurological diseases.” Id.\n47\n  ESR is the “rate at which erythrocytes precipitate out from a well-mixed specimen of venous\nblood, measured by the distance the top of the column of erythrocytes falls in a given time interval\nunder specified conditions; an increase in rate is usually due to elevated levels of plasma proteins\n…. It is increased in … active inflammatory disease.” Dorland’s at 1594.\n\n                                                   21\n\fand B cells, however, suggested to Dr. Utz that the pathologists saw something “abnormal” and\n“atypical for ALS.” Id. at 165. Dr. Utz also found significant the macrophagic and lymphocytic\ninfiltrates surrounding blood vessels (perivascular cuffing). Id. at 166. He testified that these are\nareas where the infiltrates are leaving the blood vessels and crossing the BBB to enter the CNS,\nindicates a process usually associated with ADEM. Id. at 166-67. He further testified that there is\nno mention of perivascular cuffing in any other FUS-related ALS case. Id. at 167.\n\n                             2. Causation Theory\n\n                                     a. Molecular Mimicry and Stress48\n\n        Dr. Utz posited a two-part theory based on molecular mimicry and stress. He testified that\nself-antigens activated by the Gardasil vaccine triggered ADEM and also targeted the motor\nneurons affected in ALS. Tr. 205-06. The Gardasil vaccine “activate[d] preexisting autoreactive T\nand B cells through a process of molecular mimicry.” Id. at 512. Those T and B cells became\ninflammatory and crossed the blood-brain barrier to reach the CNS. Id. Once in the CNS, they\ncaused ADEM while also attacking the myelin sheath of neurons. Id. at 512-13. J.T.’s existing\nFUS mutation “stressed” her neurons, making them “poised to be pushed over the edge to develop\nALS.” Id. at 514. As the myelin containing cells were attacked by the self-antigens, the myelin\nwas destroyed. Id. at 216. This demyelination killed the axons being protected by the myelin, and\nthis axon death was “the ALS part of it.” Tr. 216. Dr. Utz acknowledged that there is no literature\nto support his stress theory,49 which is “speculative.” Id. at 211. He opined that even without\npreviously stressed cells, ADEM can still trigger ALS. Id. at 211-32. Dr. Utz believes the vaccine\nand subsequent ADEM caused J.T. to develop ALS sooner than she would have otherwise, if she\neven developed it at all. Id. at 220, 228.\n\n       As support for the theory that inflammation can trigger ALS, Dr. Utz cited three studies:\nPanzara et al., Casula et al., and Zhao et al.50 Tr. 222-23; 228-29. These studies generally discuss\nevidence that an “inflammatory responses could play a critical role in the pathogenesis of motor\nneuron injuries in [ALS].” Pet. Ex. 18J at 233. In Zhao, however, the authors note that\nneuroinflammation is “[a] prominent pathological finding in ALS,” and that “[t]he key question,” is\nwhether “neuroinflammation is a consequence of motor neuron injury,” or causes it. Pet. Ex. 38 at\n890. The authors’ findings suggest a dynamic immune response designed to “promote\nneuroprotection or neurotoxicity at different stages of disease.” Id. In the early stages of ALS, the\nimmune system reacts to “signals from injured motor neurons to rescue and repair damaged tissue.”\nId. As the disease progresses, “a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses … to deleterious\n\n\n48\n  Dr. Utz also testified that it is possible that the adjuvant in the vaccine opened the BBB allowing\nharmful cells to enter the CNS and cause ADEM. Tr. 204. As he stated that this theory was only\npossible, and not probable, I do not find preponderant evidence to support it.\n49\n     Dr. Utz also referred to “stress bodies or stress granules.” See Tr. 231.\n50\n   Panzara et al., 6 NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE 392 [Pet. Ex. 18A], discussed earlier; M. Casula et\nal., Toll-Like Receptor Signaling in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Spinal Cord Tissue, 179\nNEUROSCI. 233 (2011) [Pet. Ex. 18J]; Zhao et al., 8 J. NEUROIMMUNO. PHARMACOLOGY 888 [Pet\nEx. 38].\n\n                                                     22\n\fimmune responses.” Id. While “activation of immune pathways may contribute to the progression\nof inflammation, resulting in motor neuron injury … future studies … will be important to achieve a\nbetter understanding.” Pet. Ex. 18J at 233.\n\n       In addition to molecular mimicry to MBP and AQP4, Dr. Utz opined that the HPV vaccine\nmight also have triggered cross reactions with other myelin constituents. Pet. Ex. 21 at 7. While he\nbelieves that there is sufficient homology between AQP4 and HPV16 to “represent biologically-\nrelevant T cell epitopes,51 he admitted that there is no evidence of auto-reactivity to MBP or AQP4.\nPet. Ex. 21 at 10.\n\n        Dr. Utz also posited that the disease may have been triggered by HPV antigens produced as\na result of J.T.’s prior vaccinations. Pet. Ex. 21 at 7. He noted that J.T. had a history of warts\nwhich, while caused by a different HPV strain, may have enough protein similarities to components\nof Gardasil to allow the pre-existing antigens to react. Id. at 7-8.\n\n       Lastly, Dr. Utz opined that adjuvants “activate[d] toll-like receptors, … [which] are [ ]\ninflammatory.” Tr. 182. Dr. Utz conceded, however, that his opinion as to adjuvants was derived\nfrom animal studies that tested Freund’s adjuvant52 and not the “proprietary alum[inum]-based\nadjuvant[s]” in Gardasil. Id. at 202.\n\n                                  b. The Role of the FUS Mutation\n\n        While Dr. Utz agreed that J.T. had the FUS P525L mutation, he believes that her ALS\ndeveloped as a response to her immune reaction to Gardasil. Pet. Ex. 21 at 9; Tr. 158. He pointed\nout that it is unknown whether there are individuals with this specific FUS mutation living normal\nlives. Pet. Ex. 21 at 11. He conceded that none of the other FUS cases described in the literature\ndiscussed another patient receiving the Gardasil vaccine prior to developing ALS, nor did they\ndiscuss a trigger for the disease. Tr. 169. He pointed out, however, that the lesions noted on\nautopsy were of the same age, “strongly” indicating “an inciting event,” since typical ALS lesions\nare of differing ages. Pet. Ex. 21 at 9. He also disagreed with the assertion of respondent’s expert,\nDr. Raymond, that the basophilic inclusions examined on autopsy were in fact FUS proteins. Id.\nDr. Utz believed this claim was invalid since the Huang study never tested for FUS proteins when\nexamining the inclusions.53 Id.\n\n\n51\n   An epitope is an “antigenic determinant,” and is “the simplest form or smallest structural area on\na complex antigen molecule that can combine with an antibody or form the major histocompatibility\ncomplex (MHC)-binding peptide recognized by T lymphocyte receptors.” Illustrated Dictionary of\nImmunology at 253. “T cell epitopes are comprised of a complex of antigenic peptide linked to\neither MHC class I or class II molecules.” Id.\n52\n  In the context of immunology, an adjuvant is “a nonspecific stimulator of the immune response.”\nDorland’s at 32. Freund’s adjuvant is “a water in oil emulsion incorporating antigen, in the aqueous\nphase, into lightweight paraffin oil with the aid of an emulsifying agent. On injection, this mixture\ninduces strong persistent antibody formation.” Id. at 32-33.\n53\n  Dr. Utz appears to be incorrect, as Huang et al. did stain the inclusions for FUS, and they had\n“intense positive staining.” Pet. Ex. 9 at 3.\n                                                  23\n\f        Dr. Utz further contended that the FUS mutation may not have significantly influenced the\ncourse of the disease because a study by Vance et al.54 shows diffuse ubiquitination in the neurons,\nwhile J.T. had only rare ubiquitination.55 Pet. Ex. 21 at 8. Additionally, other FUS patients did not\ndisplay perivascular inflammation as was seen in J.T. Pet. Ex. 21 at 9. Dr. Utz also introduced\nevidence of two autoimmune diseases that are known to be associated with genetic mutations and\nactivated by environmental triggers: systemic lupus erythematosus56 and rheumatoid arthritis.57 Tr.\n509-10.\n\n        Dr. Utz does not believe that the FUS P525L mutation alone was sufficient to have caused\nJ.T.’s ALS, or, at least, he believes it is unknown if J.T. “would have gone on to develop ALS from\nthe mutation alone.” Tr. 173, 497.58 He noted that there are individuals with other FUS mutations\nwho are living healthy, normal lives though he does concede that has not yet been observed with the\nP525L mutation. Id. at 173, 498. He also mentioned a study performed by Sharma et al.59 in which\nthe FUS gene was “knocked out” in mice but the animals neither died nor developed any ALS-like\ndisease. Dr. Utz, like Dr. Steinman, concluded that an insufficient number of healthy individuals\nhave been tested to conclude that P525L is a disease-causing mutation. Id. at 498. Lastly, Dr. Utz\nmentioned that there are mutations in other genes that have been associated with other diseases but\nnot everyone with the mutation goes on to develop the disease. Id. at 498-99.\n\n54\n     Vance et al., 23 SCI. 1208 [Resp. Ex. D6].\n55\n   Ubiquitination occurs when an ubiquitin protein is attached to another protein during\n“intracellular proteolysis,” which is “the splitting of proteins by hydrolysis of the peptide bonds\nwith formation of smaller polypeptides.” Dorland’s at 1535, 1997. J.T.’s autopsy showed “very\nrare neurons stained for ubiquitin.” One of the subjects in the Vance paper had “diffuse ubiquitin\npositivity in nuclei in the patient’s tissue but not control tissue, suggesting that one or more nuclear\nproteins are misfolded.” Pet. Ex. 21 at 8. Although Dr. Utz points out that J.T. had rare\nubiquitination, he does not explain the significance of this finding, except to contrast it with the\nfindings in Vance. Even if significant, however, petitioners have not provided preponderant\nevidence to show that rare ubiquitination alone would change the outcome of my decision.\n56\n  Systemic lupus erythematosus is a systemic disease of the connective tissue which predominantly\naffects women. Tr. 509. According to Dr. Utz, a number of known genetic mutations, as well as\nenvironmental triggers, are associated with the disease. Id. at 509-10.\n57\n   Rheumatoid arthritis is a “chronic systemic disease primarily of the joints, usually polyarticular,\nmarked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures and by muscle\natrophy and rarefaction of the bones.” Dorland’s at 157. “Rarefaction” means “diminution in\ndensity and weight.” Id. at 1593.\n58\n  Dr. Utz gave inconsistent testimony on this point. Elsewhere, he testified that more likely than\nnot, J.T. would have had ALS even if she had not received the vaccine. Tr. 218. Later, he changed\nhis opinion, testifying that this was an unknown. See id. at 497-98, 505.\n59\n   Aarti Sharma, et al., ALS-associated mutant FUS Induces Selective Motor Neuron Degeneration\nThrough Toxic Gain of Function, 7 NATURE COMMC’NS, No. 10465 (2016) [Resp. Ex. K]. The\nSharma article actually states, “These findings demonstrate that FUS-dependent motor degeneration\nis not due to loss of FUS function, but to the gain of toxic properties conferred by ALS mutations.”\nResp. Ex K at 10465. This is in agreement with the finding of misfolded FUS proteins on autopsy.\n                                                   24\n\f         Overall, while J.T.’s ALS was particularly aggressive, Dr. Utz testified that the literature\ndoes not support the supposition that her FUS P525L mutation caused her ALS. Tr. 179. Dr. Utz\nlisted a series of papers to support his conclusion that the FUS mutation alone could not have\ncaused the specific case of J.T.’s ALS, including Fecto & Siddique, Brown et al., Yan et al.,\nSproviero et al., Ito et al., Chio et al., and Mochizuki et al.60 Id. at 501-02, 506. Dr. Utz opined that\nJ.T.’s pathologic presentation of the disease was not consistent with others who had the same\nmutation. Id. at 179.\n\n         Fecto and Siddique reviewed publications assessing the various genes at play in the etiology\nof ALS and compared how these different genetic mutations lead to similar ALS symptoms and\ndisease progression. Pet. Ex. 50 at 644. The authors observed that FUS mutations make up\napproximately four to five percent of ALS cases, and that the FUS mutation has been linked to\nearlier disease onset. Id. at 666-67. They note that “[a]t least three other reports have described\nFUS mutations in patients with rapidly progressive sporadic or familial [juvenile] ALS with\nbasophilic inclusions, suggesting that basophilia due to nucleic acid accumulation is a hallmark of\npathology in FUS-linked [juvenile] ALS.” Id. at 666. While additional studies are needed to better\nunderstand the causative role of FUS mutations in the etiology of ALS, Fecto and Siddique report\nthat several studies have observed that FUS mutations are involved in the development of ALS. Id.\n\n         Yan et al. studied the array of FUS mutations present in patients with familial ALS by\nsequencing the exons of the FUS gene of 476 patients with familial ALS and 726 control patients\nwithout ALS. Pet. Ex. 61 at 807. The results of the study identified 17 different FUS mutations\nwhich occurred in 22 different families. Id. Yan also observed that “[p]atients with FUS mutations\nappeared to have earlier symptom onset, a higher rate of bulbar onset, and shorter duration of\nsymptoms that those with SOD1 mutations.” Id. Patients with the mutation make up 4.79 percent\nof all cases of familial ALS, suggesting that “FUS mutations may be a globally distributed genetic\ncause of familial ALS in patients of different genetic backgrounds.” Id. at 812. Yan et al. further\nposited that other factors, including environmental exposure and/or genetic background, could\naffect the clinical course of the disease. Id.\n\n       Chio et al. studied 52 Italian patients with familial ALS and 280 matched controls and\nperformed mutational screening of the FUS gene, finding two distinct mutations associated with\n\n60\n   Faisal Fecto & Teepu Siddique, Making Connections: Pathology and Genetics Link Amyotrophic\nLateral Sclerosis with Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia, 45 J.

Although it was not possible for\nChio et al. to analyze DNA from any of the patient’s family members, the researchers note that “the\n[FUS] mutations were not found in 280 control samples.” Id. at 2.\n\n         Finally, Dr. Utz cites the Mochizuki et al. study in support of his assertion that the FUS\nP525L mutation alone could not have caused J.T.’s development of ALS. The researchers stated\nthat “much is unknown about the clinicopathology of ALS with the FUS P525L mutation.” Pet. Ex.\n54 at 85. However, the authors performed autopsies on two Japanese sisters, both of whom suffered\nfrom familial ALS, and were able to map disease progression by comparing the sisters’ clinical\ncourses and genetic makeup. The elder sister had an FUS P525L mutation with an onset of ALS at\nage 13 in the form of right and left leg weakness and eventual quadriparesis. Id. at 86. The initial\nclinical feature was a possible polyneuropathy. Id. With the assistance of a mechanical ventilator,\nshe survived to the age of 40, over 26 years after her diagnosis. Id. Her younger sister began\nexhibiting symptoms of ALS at age 25, began using a mechanical ventilator approximately one year\nlater, and died of pneumonia at age 27. Id. Their mother died at age 35 within six months of her\ndiagnosis of progressive bulbar palsy. Id. While the eldest sibling was found to have P525L\nmutation, neither the DNA of the younger sibling nor their mother was analyzed. Id. at 89.\n\n        Mochizuki et al. noted that “All three patients in the family … developed limb weakness\nfollowed by bulbar palsy at a young age with very rapid progression …. [I]t seems likely that they\nhad the same FUS mutation.” Pet. Ex. 54 at 89. Notably, the elder sister, who had the FUS P525L\nmutation, like J.T., had a similar age of onset and disease manifestation as J.T. Pet. Ex. 1 at 193.\nAnd like J.T., the eldest sister in the Mochizuki study was thought to have a type of polyneuropathy\nprior to being diagnosed with ALS. Pet. Ex. 7 at 33.\n\n         Contrary to the testimony of Dr. Utz, these articles demonstrate that patients with ALS have\nbeen found to have similar mutations in the FUS gene and that certain mutations on the FUS gene,\nincluding P525L, are associated with a rapid onset of ALS symptoms at a young age. See Pet. Ex.\n59 at 3.\n\n                                  c. Onset\n\n        Dr. Utz opined that the timeline from vaccination to initial symptoms presented in the\nmedical records is consistent with an immune-mediated condition. Tr. 180. Due to the nature of\nthese types of diseases, he believes the disease process began earlier than the accident J.T. had at\nthe track but did not outwardly present itself until that time. Id. at 180-81.\n\n                  iii. Respondent’s Expert, Dr. Gerald Raymond\n\n                           1. Diagnosis\n\n       Dr. Raymond opined that J.T. suffered only from ALS, eventually resulting in her death.\nResp. Ex. D at 6. He opined that J.T.’s symptoms were consistent with JALS, which unlike adult\nonset ALS typically has either greater upper or lower motor neuron issues rather than both equally.\n                                                  26\n\fResp. Ex. H at 5. In ALS, it is common to see symptoms begin in one limb before involving others.\nId. J.T. never responded to immunosuppressants. While ALS has some amount of immune\ninvolvement, immunosuppressants have not been shown to be effective in treatment. Id. J.T.’s\nmanner of death, respiratory failure, is also consistent with ALS. Id.\n\n        Dr. Raymond testified that the FUS P525L mutation which J.T. had alters protein function\nand occurs in a region of known essential function. Tr. 260-61. Further, it is not observed in\ncontrolled populations. J.T.’s mutation was de novo, meaning it was not present in her parents. Id.\nat 261. It has been identified in multiple patients with juvenile onset ALS. Id.\n\n       Dr. Raymond summarized several case studies of P525L mutation, where patients had rapid\nprogression of disease. In Conte,61 an eleven year old girl with the P525L mutation and ALS had\nprogressive limb weakness with active and chronic denervation. Tr. 280-81; Resp. Ex. F13. The\nauthors concluded that “this mutation is consistently associated with a specific phenotype\ncharacterized by juvenile onset, [and] severe course.” Resp. Ex. D9 at 73. In Zou, 62 the authors\ndescribed a young woman with progressive muscle atrophy and weakness with acute and chronic\nneurogenic changes. Tr. 286; Resp. Ex. E11. Finally, in Ozoguz,63 the authors described a 14 year\nold boy with a de novo P525L mutation who had a rapid onset and progression of the disease. Tr.\n291; Resp. Ex. H1. In Baumer,64 two patients with a de novo P525L mutation had “a more\naggressive earl[y] onset.” Tr. 277-79. Both patients had lower motor neuron signs and progressive\nmuscle weakness similar to J.T. Id. at 278-79.\n\n       Dr. Raymond also cited Baumer to describe neuropathological autopsy findings specific to\nP525L FUS mutation in ALS patients.65 Tr. 294. The authors concluded that JALS “with\nbasophilic inclusions is a form of ALS characterized by protein deposits in motor neurons that are\nmorphologically and tinctorially distinct from those of classic sporadic ALS.” Resp. Ex. D3 at 611.\nThey identified these cases as “rapidly progressive FUS proteinopathy,” which should be classified\n\n61\n  Amelia Conte, et al., P525L FUS Mutation is Consistently Associated with a Severe Form of\nJuvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 21 NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS 73 (2012) [Resp.

E2 and D3]. Dr. Raymond testified that the\nliterature discusses autopsies in probably three P525L mutation cases, disagreeing with Dr. Utz’s\ntestimony that there were 18 such reported autopsies. Tr. 292. Based on my review of the\nsubmitted literature, Dr. Raymond’s testimony on the number of reported autopsies in P525L\nmutations appears to be more accurate. See id. at 292-300.\n\n                                                27\n\fas ALS-FUS. Id. at 612. The autopsies showed cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions and\ncorticospinal tract but not dorsal column degeneration. Id. Dr. Raymond opined that these findings\nare consistent with J.T.’s autopsy results. Tr. 296.\n\n        Dr. Raymond opined that J.T. did not meet the clinical criteria for ADEM because she did\nnot have encephalopathy, her MRI was not consistent with a demyelinating condition, and she did\nnot respond to immunosuppressants. Resp. Ex. F at 5; Tr. 312-13. J.T.’s MRIs did not show any\nindication of ADEM lesions, and her EMGs showed only a motor neuron disease. Tr. 309.\nAdditionally, Dr. Raymond emphasized that none of J.T.’s treating physicians ever suggested the\ndiagnosis of ADEM, a fact which Dr. Steinman also conceded. Resp. Ex. F at 5.\n\n        Dr. Raymond summarized the juvenile FUS P525L/ALS cases cited in the literature by\nreferencing the following table from Zou et al. Resp. Ex. E11 at 1312.e6. The highlighted cases at\nthe bottom of the table are the P525L cases.\n\n\n\n\nResp. Ex. E11 at 1312.e7.\n\n        Of these eleven patients, eight were female, age range eleven to 22, with disease duration of\nsix to 24 months. Id. Dr. Raymond testified that J.T.’s onset was typical of other P525L patients,\nand that her 22 month clinical course was consistent, but perhaps a little longer, than others. Tr.\n330.\n\n       Moreover, Dr. Raymond believes J.T.’s autopsy was consistent with ALS, and he offered\nreasonable explanations for any perceived inconsistent findings. Tr. 318-20. He explained that\n\n                                                 28\n\frelatively little information is known about J.T.’s type of genetically mediated ALS. Resp. Ex. F at\n6. The genetic test revealing the P525L mutation was not completed until after the autopsy, leaving\nthe pathologists with incomplete information at the time of autopsy. Id. at 5.\n\n        As for inflammatory changes and demyelination described on J.T.’s autopsy, Dr. Raymond\nopined that in “ALS, the spinal cord shows secondary loss of myelin due to the loss of neuronal\naxons,” and that “[t]hese changes are associated with variable astrocytic gliosis and the\naccumulation of macrophages and lymphocytes.” Resp. Ex. F at 2. Loss of neurons in the motor\ncortex leads to “severe myelin loss [which] can be traced up through the brainstem into the cerebral\nhemispheres.” Id. This caused the “characteristic pallor” that can be seen on cross-sections of the\nspinal cord. Id.\n\n         Dr. Raymond explained that due to the progression of the disease, most motor neuron\ndamage in ALS is typically seen in the corticospinal and other motor pathways. Resp. Ex. F at 2.\nHowever, in familial and genetic ALS, demyelination has also been demonstrated in other tracts.\nId. Dr. Raymond referenced studies done by Hirano et al. and Tandan and Bradley, 66 which show\ndemyelination in the posterior columns, spinocerebellar tracts, and Clarke’s nucleus67 of patients\nwith familial ALS. Resp. Ex. F at 2. Respondent also cited other studies about neuroinflammation\nin ALS.68 Dr. Raymond further explained that “evidence of inflammation is seen in both sporadic\nand familial ALS with the presences of macrophages, T cells, and B cells.” Id. at 3. Macrophages\nare “presumed to be involved in the phagocytosis, or ‘cleaning up’ of the dying motor neurons,\naxons, and myelination debris. Lymphocytes are also seen[,] and there is often perivascular\ninfiltration.” Id.\n\n       In support of his opinions, Dr. Raymond also cited Troost et al.,69 wherein the authors\nstudied “the prevalence and extent of lymphocytic infiltration” by examining spinal cords from 48\n\n66\n  Asao Hirano et al., Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Subgroup Characterized by\nPosterior and Spinocerebellar Tract Involvement and Hyaline Inclusions in the Anterior Horn\nCells, 16 ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY 232 (1967) [Resp.

F4].\n67\n     Clarke’s nucleus is another name for the posterior thoracic nucleus. Dorland’s at 1296.\n68\n   For example, in Philips & Robberecht, the authors discuss reactive microglial cells, and\nneuroinflammatory reactions in neurodegenerative diseases like ALS. Thomas Philip & Wim\nRobberecht, Neuroinflammation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Role of Glial Activation in\nMotor Neuron Disease, 10 LANCET NEUROL. 253 (2011) [Resp. Ex. E8]. The authors conclude that\nthe “inflammatory reaction, which is supposed to combat the precipitating factor, is believed to turn\ninto a hazardous process and contribute to neuronal damage.” Id. at 254.\n69\n  D. Troost et al., Lymphocytic infiltration in the spinal cord of patients with amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis, 8 CLINICAL NEUROPATHOLOGY 289 (1989) [Resp. Ex. F27]. Petitioners cited a number of\nmore recent studies, including Graves (2003) [Pet. Ex. 36], Hooten (2015) [Pet. Ex. 32]; and Staff\n& Appel (2016) [Pet. Ex. 37], all of which support Dr. Raymond’s opinion that macrophages and\nlymphocytic infiltrations may provide a “cleaning up” function, or have immunoprotective,\nfollowed by neurotoxic, roles.\n\n                                                    29\n\fcases of ALS. Resp. Ex. F27 at 289. They found lymphocytic infiltration in 44 percent (21 cases),\nand the “infiltrates were localized as small cuffs around the blood vessels.” Id. at 292. Further,\n“lymphocytic infiltration … was not restricted to the damaged parts of the pyramidal tracts …. [but\nwas also] observed in [ ] normal areas of the brain stem.” Id.\n\n        Dr. Raymond believes that the autopsy finding that “[a]ll of the lesions in the spinal cord\nappear to be the same age,” means that the disease was so far progressed that the motor neurons had\ndied and thus the pathology was “at an end stage.” Tr. 320. The analogy he gave was an empty\ncup; there is “no information about when I drank the water in the cup or when these neurons died.\nThey’re now all gone.” Id. The “severe loss of motor neurons,” caused “loss of exons [and] …\ndemyelination.” Id at 321. He stated that there is no evidence J.T. suffered that loss of neurons at\none specific time. Instead, “[J.T.’s] disease became evident, and then [became] progressively worse\nuntil her death.” Id. at 322. Additionally, the autopsy noted “rare cortical neurons with amorphous\ncytoplasmic inclusions” in the right frontal lobe and midbrain. Id. at 329. This finding indicates\n“early stage” neuronal loss in that section of the brain. This finding suggests that the pathology at\nissue did not occur at “one point in time.” Id. Moreover, J.T.’s progressive course does not support\nthe conclusion that she had complete loss of her neurons in her spinal cord at one time. Tr. 322.\n\n       In summary, Dr. Raymond believes that J.T.’s “symptoms, entire clinical picture, and\npathology are all consistent with a genetically mediated ALS.” Resp. Ex. F at 5; Tr. 331.\n\n                          2. Causation Theory\n\n        Dr. Raymond opined that J.T. had a “serious alteration in the FUS gene that resulted in\njuvenile ALS and was the direct and sole cause of her disease and death.” Resp. Ex. D at 6. “There\nis no evidence that this was caused or aggravated by the vaccine she received.” Id. Dr. Raymond\nemphasized that the P525L mutation has not been seen in normal individuals, as supported by the\nemails Dr. Steinman received from Drs. Sapp and Brown.70 Resp. Ex. F at 7-8. Dr. Raymond\nattached significance to their assertion that “[t]his is certainly the most aggressive form of ALS any\nof us here have seen – aggressive both in age of onset and in rate of progression.” Id. at 8. Dr.\nRaymond believes that the P525L mutation is “a disease causing mutation that presents early and is\nclinically aggressive.” Id. at 9.\n\n\n\n\n70\n   On January 30, 2014, petitioners filed Dr. Steinman’s emails from Dr. Robert Brown and Dr.\nPeter Sapp as Exhibits 25 and 26. Dr. Steinman testified that Dr. Brown is “one of the foremost\nexperts in ALS.” Tr. 73-74. Dr. Brown is a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical\nSchool and a co-discoverer of the FUS mutation. Id. at 59-60. He was also an author of the Huang\narticle (Pet. Ex. 9). Id. at 63. In an email from Dr. Brown to Dr. Steinman dated April 11, 2013,\nDr. Brown stated that “[w]e have seen the P525L mutation [ ] in at least three early onset (juvenile)\ncases …. More generally, others have described FUS mutations (including P525L) in juvenile ALS\nas well – often basophilic inclusions, of uncertain significance.” Pet. Ex. 25 at 1. In an email dated\nApril 12, 2013, Dr. Sapp reported to Dr. Steinman that the P525L mutation is not seen “in\ncontrols[,] and the ALS online database … does not report any instances from other\npublication[s]…” Pet. Ex. 26 at 1.\n\n                                                  30\n\f       Dr. Raymond references a paper written by Niu et al. 71 in which researchers demonstrated\nthat mutations in the FUS protein interfered with its ability to be transported from the cytoplasm\nback into the nucleus. Tr. 261-62. This mislocalization interfered with transcription and RNA\nprocessing. Id. at 257. He also pointed out that this mutation is present from the moment of\nconception, and that it is always present and active in an affected individual. Id. at 265. Dr.\nRaymond testified that the Sharma article demonstrates that any affected individual will eventually\ndevelop motor neuron loss.72 Id. at 267-69. In fact, mice affected with a P525L mutation analog\nwere more quickly and severely affected than mice with another FUS mutation. Id. at 268.\nAdditionally, the mice required no environmental trigger for the motor neuron loss to begin; it\noccurred solely as a result of the mutation. Id. at 269. Dr. Raymond also introduced a paper\nauthored by Jackel et al.,73 in which a fruit fly model with the P525L mutation was found to have\ncytoplasmic accumulation of the FUS protein, nervous system changes, and local motor activity\nchanges. Tr. 275-76.\n\n        In surveying the literature submitted by both petitioners and respondent, Dr. Raymond found\nmore than 2,000 control patients, not one of which had the P525L mutation, supporting his opinion\nthat the mutation is found only in affected individuals. Tr. 272-74.\n\n        Dr. Raymond rejected petitioners’ theory of molecular mimicry as applied to the facts here.\nDr. Steinman stated that T cells could recognize both HPV and MBP, because HPV has homology\nwith a region of MBP and is therefore able to cross-react, basing his opinion largely on the\nWucherfennig paper. However, Wucherfennig warned that the paper did not find cross reactivity in\nthe HPV types found in Gardasil. Resp. Ex. F at 8 (ref. Pet. Ex. 24H). Wucherfennig stated that the\nepitope required a region of 13-15 proteins, and that the critical conserved region was FFK, not\nsimply FK. Cross-reactivity with HPV was strain-specific to types 7 and 13. Id. Gardasil contains\ntypes 6, 11, 16, and 18. Id. Dr. Raymond also disagreed with Dr. Steinman’s revised opinion to\nrequire FK with three other amino acids, in which case, almost any exposure could have been a\ntrigger. Resp. Ex. H at 2. Dr. Steinman provided no evidence that the HFFK-like motif in HPV is a\ncomponent of Gardasil, a recombinant vaccine. Id.\n\n        Dr. Raymond also disagreed with Dr. Steinman’s assertions regarding cross reactivity\nbetween AQP4 and HPV, which were based on the Menge article, a report of four cases of NMO in\nthe VAERS database following HPV immunization. Resp. Ex. F at 9. While the authors question\nthe role of HPV, this does not establish a pathogenic link. Id. In addition, the link between AQP4\nand ALS is not clear. There is no evidence that AQP4 interacts with FUS. Resp. Ex. D at 4.\nFurther, there is no evidence that J.T. ever developed an antibody to AQP4 or had NMO.

There is\nno evidence that HPV vaccine can result in widespread alterations of DNA and no evidence that it\ninteracts in any way with the FUS protein.” Resp. Ex. D at 4.\n\n       Lastly, Dr. Raymond cited to the discussion of mechanistic evidence from the Institute of\nMedicine (“IOM”), in relation to the Huang study, quoted in pertinent part as follows: “Based on\nthe genetic analysis and neuropathology, the authors [of Huang] did not attribute the rapidly\nprogressive form of [JALS] in the patient to vaccination against HPV.” Resp. Ex. L at 4. A\nfootnote attributed the above quoted information to a “personal communication with Dr. Lomen-\nHoerth, ALS Center, University of California, San Francisco.” Id., note 1. Dr. Lomen-Hoerth is\nthe specialist in ALS who treated J.T. from April 2008 until her death in March 2009; she also\nperformed her autopsy. Tr. 545, 547.\n\n                  iv. Respondent’s Expert, Dr. Arun Venkatesan\n\n                          1. Diagnosis\n\n                                  a. ALS is the Correct Diagnosis\n\n       Dr. Venkatesan opined that J.T. “suffered from juvenile-onset ALS caused by the FUS\nP525L gene mutation,” unrelated to the Gardasil vaccine. Resp. Ex. E at 3. He based this\nconclusion on J.T.’s clinical course and diagnostic tests, which were all consistent with FUS P525L\nALS. Tr. 386-88.\n\n        While petitioners propose that there was “an inciting autoimmune component” (i.e. vaccine-\ntriggered ADEM), to J.T.’s ALS, Dr. Venkatesan does not believe that there is any evidence to\nsupport this position. Resp. Ex. E at 3. As support for his opinion, he referenced the fact that\nimmunosuppressants had little benefit in treating J.T., nor have they been successful in other trials\nfor the treatment of ALS. Id. Rather, he stated that in ALS, “the observed inflammatory response\nis predominantly a reaction to the degeneration of neurons and axons.” Id. He cited studies\nperformed by Hosmane et al., Viviana et al., and Philips and Robberecht.74 Id.; Tr. 412-13. In\nparticular, Philips and Robberecht explain that both inflammation and T cells are commonly seen in\nALS. Id. at 413; Resp. Ex. E8. As the disease stage progresses, increased numbers of activated\nmicroglia and astrocytes are seen indicating an “activation of these immune cells.” Tr. 414. Dr.\nVenkatesan concluded that as immunosuppressants have largely been proven ineffective at treating\nALS, the inflammation is likely a result, and not a cause, of the disease.

Did Not Have ADEM\n\n                                          i. Clinical Course\n\n         Dr. Venkatesan does not believe that J.T. ever had ADEM, as she did not exhibit any of the\ncriteria for the condition. Resp. Ex. G at 1. He referenced a book chapter written by Silvia N.\nTenembaum detailing the symptoms and diagnostic criteria for ADEM.75 Tr. 387, 394; Resp. Ex.\nF6 at 1253. “Rapid onset encephalopathy (behavioral change or altered consciousness)” is a\ncentral feature of ADEM. Id. at 1254. Patients generally develop symptoms rapidly, with the most\nsevere symptoms occurring one to two weeks after initial presentation. Id. at 392. After that time,\npatients usually begin to improve. Id. Dr. Venkatesan noted that J.T. did not “have any signs or\nsymptoms of encephalopathy at the onset of her neurologic presentation,” and her initial symptom\nwas exclusively leg weakness. Resp. Ex. G at 1..\n\n        In ADEM, MRI is “the most sensitive paraclinical marker of acute demyelination,” showing\nmultiple white matter lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Resp. Ex. F6 at 1254. J.T. did not have\nan MRI or a lumbar puncture during her initial presentation, two tests essential to diagnose ADEM.\nResp. Ex. G at 1. During the acute phase, ADEM appears on MRI as “multiple areas of signal\nabnormality,” representing “dissemination of inflammatory lesions in the nervous system.” Tr. 393.\nEven months later, after a patient is no longer symptomatic, the MRI will still show “evidence that\nthere had been a prior injury to the nervous system.” Id. An MRI performed approximately one\nyear after J.T.’s initial symptoms showed no evidence that she ever had ADEM. Id. at 396-97.\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan also disagreed with Dr. Utz’s assertion that J.T.’s lab tests demonstrated\nevidence of ADEM. Dr. Utz cited a weakly positive ANA, elevated ESR, and positive\nantiphospholipid antibodies as evidence that J.T. had ADEM. Tr. 400-01. Dr. Venkatesan\ndisagreed with this conclusion. Id. at 401. Because comparison tests were not performed prior to\nvaccine administration, Dr. Venkatesan testified that there is no way to conclude those results were\nrelated to the vaccine. Id. He also does not believe those results were specific to or conclusive of\nADEM, nor “[did] they point to any evidence for inflammation in the nervous system.” Id.\n\n                                         ii. Autopsy\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan asserted that because ADEM is a clinical syndrome, it can be diagnosed\nonly clinically, when the patient is alive. Tr. 397-98. Pathology seen on autopsy may be used to\nsupport the diagnosis, but ADEM cannot be diagnosed based on pathology after death. Id. He\nopined that the spinal cord inflammation observed on J.T.’s autopsy is not indicative of ADEM\ndespite the assertions of Drs. Steinman and Utz. Resp. Ex. G at 1. While ADEM does cause\ninflammation, it is a monophasic disease, meaning that the inflammation is acute and resolves in a\nfew weeks. Id. Additionally, Dr. Venkatesan opined that ALS can cause inflammation, and he\ncited an article authored by Philips and Robberecht76 summarizing the “state of understanding of\ninflammation in ALS.” Tr. 411-12. He also cited articles by Panzara et al., Casula et al., and Zhao\n\n75\n Silvia N. Tenembaum, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, in 112 HANDBOOK OF CLINICAL\nNEUROLOGY: PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY PART II (O. Dulac et al., eds., 3rd series 2013) [Resp. Ex.

As noted\nearlier, taken as a whole, these articles emphasize that inflammation is present in ALS, but “there is\nno data to suggest that inflammation can propagate ALS.” Id. at 417.\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan also noted other issues on J.T.’s autopsy that precluded the diagnosis of\nADEM. Tr. at 398. On autopsy, J.T. had “demyelination in the anterior and lateral columns of the\nspinal cord with what appears to be sparing of the posterior columns.” Tr. 399. Dr. Venkatesan\nstated that it was difficult to imagine “a situation in which one would have ADEM… where there is\nextensive demyelination that is only along the motor tracts, but does not involve the sensory tracts,\nthe dorsal columns.” Id. Dr. Vankatesan emphasized that “the inflammatory cells were almost\nexclusively found in the anterior portion of the [spinal] cord, corresponding to areas that degenerate\nin ALS. This pattern is consistent with ALS,” and not ADEM. Resp. Ex. T at 1. He further opined\nthat the location of J.T.’s lesions was not “compatible” with ADEM. Tr. 399. Also, if the lesions\nall occurred at the same time, as Dr. Steinman hypothesized, Dr. Venkatesan opined that J.T. would\nhave been “neurologically devastated…. reflected in extreme weakness, potentially paralysis,”\naffecting not just one leg but rather her whole body at the time of initial presentation. Id. at 400.\nDr. Venkatesan would also have expected to see evidence of such devastation on her MRIs. Id.\n\n                           2. Causation Theory\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan opined that J.T.’s juvenile ALS was caused by the FUS P525L mutation,\nand he cited multiple case studies in support of his opinion. Articles by Vance et al. and\nKwiatkowski et al.78 show that FUS mutations are causally related to ALS. Resp. Ex. E at 5.\nAdditional studies by Conte et al., Mackenzie et al., and Baumer et al.79 demonstrate an association\nbetween the FUS P525L mutation with “juvenile onset, an aggressive clinical course, and\npredominantly a lower motor neuron disorder.” Id. Dr. Venkatesan stated that J.T. was “described\nas having a ‘pure lower motor neuron syndrome.’” Id. Zou et al. report the age of onset for\ngenetically-mediated JALS is 11 to 22 years of age and the duration of illness is six months to two\nyears.80 Id. J.T.’s age of onset, 13 years old, and the duration of her illness, 22 months, fall within\nthese ranges. Id. Additionally, Dr. Venkatesan noted that in his study, Dr. Huang concluded that\nJ.T. had “‘rapidly progressive juvenile ALS.’” Id.\n\n\n\n77\n Panzara et al., 6 NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE 392 [Pet.

Resp. Ex. E at 3. Additionally,\nDr. Venkatesan disagreed with Dr. Steinman’s reliance on the Menge et al.81 article demonstrating\nincreased AQP4 mRNA expression in SOD1 rats as proof for the involvement of AQP4 in ALS.\nId.; Tr. 402-03. Dr. Venkatesan stated that an increase in mRNA does not necessarily mean an\nincrease in the protein, nor does it explicitly indicate a role in ALS. Resp. Ex. E at 3. Furthermore,\nthe SOD1 rate has not been proven to be a reliable representation of the FUS P525L mutation, or\neven FUS mutations in general. Id. Nor did Dr. Venkatesan believe that cross-reactivity has been\ndemonstrated between HPV proteins and AQP4, as Dr. Steinman asserts. Id.; Tr. 402-03.\n\n         Dr. Venkatesan opined that the proposed mechanism of molecular mimicry between HPV\nproteins and MBP is tenuous. Resp. Ex. I at 1. He stated that the argument for molecular mimicry\nbetween HPV proteins and MBP “rests on limited sequence homology and a substantial reliance on\ndegeneracy[,] and Dr. Steinman has not produced evidence that this proposed sequence can actually\ninduce mimicry.” Id. Dr. Venkatesan referenced a study performed by Silvanovich et al.,82 in\nwhich researchers examined the odds of two molecules having a similar amino acid sequence. Tr.\n407-10. Using the math demonstrated in that article, Dr. Venkatesan opined that there is actually a\none in five chance that MBP has the HFF amino acid sequence that Dr. Steinman testified is so\ncritical. Id. at 408-09. Thus, “when one is looking for evidence of similarity [ ] between amino\nacids,” it is important to remember that it “can occur just by random chance.” Id. at 406.\n\n        Dr. Venkatesan also disagreed with Dr. Utz’s opinion that ADEM resulted in stress bodies\nor stress granules which may have played a causal role in J.T.’s ALS. Dr. Venkatesan emphasized\nthat Dr. Utz’s opinion as to ADEM, stress granules, and ALS is “quite tenuous and not supported by\nreliable evidence.” Resp. Ex. T at 1. Citing a paper by Dr. Wang, Dr. Venkatesan explained that\n“while stress granules have been observed in ALS,” it is not known whether they play a role in\n“disease pathogenesis” or if they serve “a protective function.” Id. at 2 (referencing Resp. Ex. T1).\n\n        While on the longer side of what is acceptable, Dr. Venkatesan agrees with Dr. Steinman\nthat the time period between vaccination and clinical presentation of symptoms is reasonable for an\nautoimmune response. Tr. 446; Resp. Ex. E at 4. However, Dr. Venkatesan believes J.T.’s ALS\nwas caused by the FUS P525L mutation and not the Gardasil vaccine. Resp. Ex. I at 2.\n\n      VII.

J.T.’s Correct Diagnosis is ALS\n\n        The parties stipulated that J.T. had the P525L mutation and ALS, and thus her diagnosis of\nALS is not in question. Therefore, I must decide whether J.T. had ADEM. I find that respondent’s\nexperts are more persuasive in concluding that J.T. did not suffer ADEM and that she suffered only\nfrom ALS. My reasons for this finding include that her clinical course was consistent with ALS but\ninconsistent with ADEM; her EMG and other diagnostic testing was consistent with a motor neuron\ndisease and inconsistent with ADEM; she did not respond to immunosuppresive therapy; none of\nher treating doctors ever diagnosed her with ADEM; and the findings on autopsy were inconsistent\nwith ADEM but consistent with ALS. Moreover, J.T.’s course is consistent with current medical\nknowledge of the FUS P525L mutation. Each of these reasons is discussed more fully below.\n\n         J.T.’s clinical course was not consistent with a monophasic illness such as ADEM but was\ninstead consistent with a rapidly progressive, aggressive motor neuron condition like ALS. The\ninitial manifestation of her illness occurred on May 24, 2007, when she fell while attempting to\njump a hurdle. By June 2007, she had weakness and pain in her left leg, and by August 2007, she\nwas walking with a limp. She was referred to physical therapy, but returned to the orthopedist in\nOctober 2007, due to the worsening of her condition. At that time, the orthopedist noted that J.T.’s\nlimp was significantly worse and the muscles in her legs had atrophied. By November 2007, she\nhad wasting of her hands and atrophy of the muscles in her thigh and calf. She was referred to a\npediatric neurologist. On November 13, 2007, the orthopedist described asymmetric muscle\nweakness and wasting of her limbs. Pet. Ex. 7 at 33. The duration of J.T.’s illness was\n                                                 36\n\fapproximately 22 months. As described by Dr. Raymond, J.T.’s aggressive course and her\nsymptoms are consistent with ALS, not ADEM. Tr. 304-07.\n\n       J.T.’s EMG testing was not consistent with ADEM, but it was consistent with motor neuron\ndisease, or ALS. EMGs performed in November 2007 showed acute and chronic denervation of the\nmotor system with sparing of the sensory system, suggesting a motor neuron disease. While\nhospitalized, EMG revealed “pure motor neurogenic disorder with axonal features predominating.”\nPet. Ex. 2 at 822.\n\n        Moreover, J.T.’s diagnostic testing was not consistent with ADEM, but was consistent with\nALS. The classic diagnostic test for ADEM is the MRI of the brain. Dr. Steinman agreed that\nJ.T.’s MRI did not show ADEM-like demyelinating lesions, and therefore, it was not consistent\nwith ADEM. Tr. 105, 308. Dr. Steinman testified that the MRI of J.T.’s spine showed a loss of\ncervical and lumbar enlargements, evidence of degenerative changes consistent with ALS, not\nADEM. Id. at 106, 110-11. Dr. Steinman also testified that J.T.’s EMG showed motor and axonal\ninvolvement and injury to the anterior horn cells, which is consistent with ALS. Id. at 103. He\nfurther stated that the EMG did not reveal any findings consistent with ADEM. Id. at 101.\n\n       Dr. Steinman also testified that J.T.’s CSF did not show increased protein, which would\nhave been expected in ADEM, and thus was more consistent with ALS. Tr. 105. She also tested\nnegative for oligoclonal bands, which would be expected with multiple sclerosis, and her muscle\nand nerve biopsy was also consistent with neurogenic muscular pathology. Id. at 308.\n\n        J.T.’s illness did not respond to immunosuppressive medication or treatment such as IVIG,\nsteroids, or plasmapheresis, which are generally effective against neuroinflammatory and immune-\nmediated conditions like ADEM. Even Dr. Steinman agreed that he would have expected a better\nresponse to IVIG if J.T. had ADEM. Tr. 112.\n\n        Further, none of J.T.’s treating physicians ever diagnosed her with ADEM. See Tr. 24-25.\nWhile her initial diagnosis was unclear, after her disease progressed and she was seen by an ALS\nspecialist, she was diagnosed with a motor neuron disease (ALS). Dr. Steinman testified that he and\nthe other physicians who saw J.T. during her hospitalization in February 2008 thought she had an\n“inflammatory neuropathy,” such as CIDP, but they did not consider ADEM as a differential\ndiagnosis. Id. at 22-24. During her February 2008 admission at Lucile Packard Children’s\nHospital, J.T. was diagnosed with a possible motor neuron disease. By March 2008, J.T.’s\nneurologist diagnosed her with a motor neuropathy of unknown cause, and the differential diagnosis\nincluded ALS. In April 2008, Dr. Lomen-Hoerth opined that J.T. had a lower motor neuron\nsyndrome. Pet. Ex. 1 at 128. J.T. died on March 15, 2009, of “atypical [ ] ALS-like motor neuron\ndisease.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 1.\n\n        The findings in J.T.’s autopsy also provide evidence to support the diagnosis of ALS and not\nADEM. There were three principle findings: extensive macrophage and lymphocytic infiltrates\nand severe astrogliosis of the spinal cord, severe loss of motor neurons, and cytoplasmic inclusions\nin neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The pathologists attributed the loss of motor neurons and\nthe cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions to ALS. At the time of J.T.’s autopsy, severe loss of motor\nneurons and cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions had been reported in juvenile ALS in several case\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\fstudies.83 That finding was not questioned by the pathologists or disputed by the parties. However,\nthe significance of the findings of extensive demyelination and the extensive macrophage and\nlymphocytic infiltrates are strongly contested. The disagreement has its origins in the discussion\nportion of the autopsy report, where the pathologists question the “histological feature of the\ndemyelination” which “appeared to be of the same age,” and the suggestion that J.T. had a\n“progressive neurological disease [] mediated by immune responses leading to extensive\ndemyelination in the spinal cord.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 8. MS and ADEM are cited as two examples of\nsuch conditions. But the pathologists did not diagnose J.T. with either MS or ADEM. Instead, they\ndistinguish J.T.’s clinical course from that of MS, because MS is rarely seen in patients under 15\nyears of age and most MS patients have a “remitting-relapsing” clinical course, not a progressively\nworsening course like J.T. As for ADEM, the pathologists note that while “astrogliosis can be\ndetected in ADEM…[it is] usually not as robust as that seen in chronic MS lesions.” Pet. Ex. 6 at 9.\n\n        In contrast, Dr. Raymond cited to literature which described evidence of demyelination in\nALS cases, characterized as lymphocytic infiltration of the spinal cord. Troost examined 48 ALS\nspinal cords, and described myelin pallor, macrophages, and lymphocytic infiltration in 21 of the\npatients (44%). Resp. Ex. F27 at 291. The lymphocytic infiltrates “were localized as small cuffs\naround the blood vessels (perivascular cuffing).” Id. at 292. The lymphocytic infiltration was seen\nin damaged areas, as well as “histologically normal areas of the brain stem, particularly in the\npyramidal tract.” Id. Troost concluded that lymphocytic infiltration is a common phenomenon in\nALS patients. Id. Dr. Raymond also cited literature detailing the findings of myelin pallor and\n“[l]oss of myelin from the cerebrospinal tracts and posterior columns…particularly in familial\ncases.” Resp. Ex. F30 at 382. Thus, based on all of the literature referenced by the pathologists\nwho performed the autopsy, as well as the experts for both parties, there appear to be pathological\nfindings common to both ADEM and ALS.\n\n        What was meant by the pathologists and Dr. Huang, the neuropathologist, when they wrote\nin the autopsy report that “the histological features of the demyelination appeared to be of the same\nage” is not entirely clear. Dr. Steinman and Dr. Raymond debated the meaning of this reference at\nlength. For Dr. Steinman, the reference to the lesions being the same age is fundamental to his\nopinion that J.T. had ADEM. He testified that this finding signified a “thunderclap” event, a\nhallmark for ADEM. Dr. Raymond disagreed, testifying that it meant the lesions were at an end-\nstage. He argued that if the lesions had occurred at one time, J.T. would have been paralyzed,\ninconsistent with her progressive decline as described in the records. While I cannot resolve this\ndebate, it does not alter the fact that J.T.’s autopsy findings are consistent with pathology seen in\nALS cases, and specifically FUS P525L ALS cases reported in the literature.\n\n       Juvenile ALS is a rare disease. In 2007 when J.T. first became ill, her mutation was not\neven known, and it was not reported in the literature until 2009. J.T.’s presentation and diagnosis\nmay not have been clear until her condition worsened and she was seen by ALS specialists.\nFurther, because ALS is a terrible and fatal condition, the physicians appear to have been reluctant\nto make the diagnosis. While initially J.T.’s condition may have been attributed to an inflammatory\n\n83\n  In 1992, Matsumoto and others reported two cases of juvenile ALS with basophilic inclusions. S.\nMatsumoto et al., Basophilic Inclusions in Sporadic Juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: An\nImmunocytochemical and Ultrastructural Study, 83 ACTA NEUROPATHOL. 579 (1992) [Resp. Ex.\nD2]. In 2009, Kwiatkowski (one case) and Vance (three cases) both reported report cytoplasmic\ninclusions in postmortem studies of cases with FUS ALS. Resp. Ex. D5; Resp. Ex. E9.\n                                                38\n\fneuropathy, when she had diagnostic testing and was seen by ALS specialists, she was diagnosed\nwith ALS and only ALS. Her clinical course and the timeline of her diagnosis reflect the growing\nbody of knowledge about the geneotype-phenotype of FUS P525L ALS.\n\n         Based on J.T.’s clinical course, the opinions and diagnoses of her treating physicians, her\nautopsy results, and the current body of medical knowledge as described by the experts and set forth\nin their respective medical literature, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that J.T. did not\nhave ADEM and that she had only ALS.\n\n           b.

First, petitioners’ causal theory is built on the assumption that J.T. had ADEM. Both\nDrs. Steinman and Utz opined that the first step of their theories is that the HPV vaccine caused J.T.\nto develop ADEM. Since I do not find that J.T. ever had ADEM, there is no longer a foundational\npremise for their mechanistic theory.\n\n        Second, assuming that petitioners are alleging that HPV caused J.T.’s ALS (even if she did\nnot have ADEM), they failed to provide preponderant evidence. Dr. Utz opined that the self-\nantigens activated by the HPV vaccine also targeted motor neurons affected in ALS. While\npetitioners did provide some evidence of homology between the HPV vaccine, MPB, and AQP4,\nthey did not provide preponderant evidence of homology between HPV and motor neurons, the\ndestruction of which causes ALS.\n\n        Similarly, petitioners did not explain or provide evidence to support Dr. Steinman’s theory\nthat the HPV vaccine damaged motor neurons which were already vulnerable due to the FUS\nmutation. Dr. Steinman suggested that the HPV vaccine, via homology with AQP4, resulted in\nchanges to the BBB, which disturbed the neuronal microenvironment, contributing to the death of\nmotor neurons. The premise for this theory appears to come from the Bataveljic article. However,\n                                                  39\n\fthe authors of that article did not discuss homology between HPV and AQP4 or draw any\nconclusions about whether impairment in the BBB may contribute to the cause of ALS. Moreover,\nthey cautioned against attributing too much significance to AQP4 alone with regard to impairment\nof the BBB. See Pet. Ex. 18G at 2001.\n\n       Dr. Steinman cited studies by Appel, Gossoni, and Panzara,84 which suggest evidence of\nadaptive immunity in the spinal cord fluid of patients with ALS. Pet. Ex. 20 at 14-15. While those\nfindings suggest that immunological processes may play a role in the etiology or progression of\nALS, they fail to provide persuasive evidence that the HPV vaccine or ADEM, either alone, or in\nconcert, cause ALS, or worsen its course.\n\n         Third, petitioners emphasize the finding of neuroinflammation on autopsy and the references\nto ADEM and MS in the autopsy report as evidence of an immune-mediated condition related to\nHPV. Dr. Steinman introduced evidence showing the presence of neuroinflammation in patients\nwith ALS. Pet. Ex. 14 at 14-15 (citing Pet. Ex. 18K). But while the presence of neuroinflammation\nis not debated, Dr. Steinman conceded it was unclear from the current medical literature whether the\ninflammation initiates or is a consequence of neuron death seen in ALS. Tr. 108. In Panzara,85 a\nstudy examining autopsies of patients who succumbed to ALS, the authors found inflammatory\ninfiltrates in the spinal cord, raising the possibility of an immune-mediated process in motor neuron\ndegeneration. Pet. Ex. 18A at 392. But they drew no conclusions, instead recommending further\nstudies to determine the role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of ALS. Id. at 404. Similarly, in\nGraves,86 the authors concluded that “[f]urther studies are needed to investigate the initiating cause\nof [ ] inflammation.” Pet. Ex. 36 at 6. I find the literature and Dr. Raymond’s testimony to be most\npersuasive on the significance of the inflammation. As best summarized by Staff and Appel, it is\n“unclear at this point how and when the immune system impacts the course of disease in ALS\npatients.” Pet. Ex. 37 at 335.\n\n        Fourth, I find petitioners’ theories regarding stress and vaccine adjuvants to be speculative.\nDr. Utz acknowledged that his theory that J.T.’s existing FUS mutation stressed her neurons,\nmaking them susceptible to ALS was speculative. While he did not concede that his theory based\non adjuvants was speculative, Dr. Utz’s testimony about this theory during the hearing was not\npersuasive. Moreover, this theory assumes that adjuvants activate toll-like receptors, which cause\ninflammation. Again, the role of inflammation in the etiology of ALS is simply unknown at this\ntime, and thus, I do not find any theory based on this premise to be persuasive.\n\n                   ii. Althen Prong Two: Logical Sequence of Cause and Effect\n\n        Under Althen Prong Two, petitioners must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\nthere is a “logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the\n\n84\n   Staff & Appel, 26 NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS 335 [Pet.

Evaluation of the Evidence\n\n         I find that petitioners failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the vaccine was the “but\nfor” cause of J.T.’s ALS for the following reasons. Petitioners agreed and both of their experts\nconceded that J.T. had ALS and was born with the FUS P525L mutation. However, petitioners’\nexperts were equivocal and gave contradictory evidence about whether J.T. would have developed\nALS if she had not received the vaccine. Initially, Dr. Steinman testified that J.T.’s mutation could\nhave caused her ALS without any vaccine trigger. However, later during the hearing, he recanted\nhis earlier testimony and testified that he did not believe that her ALS would have developed\nwithout a trigger, such as the vaccine. Similarly, Dr. Utz initially testified that more likely than not,\nJ.T. would have had ALS even if she had not received the vaccine. Tr. 218. However, he later\ntestified that it was unknown whether J.T. would have developed ALS if she had not received the\nvaccine. Id. at 497-98, 505. In contrast, respondent’s experts put forth a persuasive explanation\nthat J.T.’s serious genetic mutation caused her ALS and death and that the vaccine played no role in\nthe development or progression of her disease. Further, Dr. Lomen-Hoerth, an ALS specialist and\nJ.T.’s treating physician, did not attribute J.T.’s ALS to the HPV vaccine. I find the equivocation\nby petitioners’ experts to be telling, and Dr. Loemen-Hoerth and respondent’s experts to be more\npersuasive on this point.\n\n        I also find that petitioners failed to establish by preponderant evidence that the HPV vaccine\nmay have worsened J.T.’s condition or that it otherwise affected the course of her illness.\nPetitioners put forth no evidence to support their position on this issue. In contrast, Dr. Raymond\nprovided literature showing the reported cases of FUS P525L ALS, and these cases illustrate that\nJ.T.’s age at onset, clinical course, duration of illness, and severity of illness were consistent with\nthe reported cases. Further, there are no known instances of disease free individuals who have the\nP525L mutation. For these reasons, I find that petitioners failed to provide preponderant evidence\nof Althen Prong Two.\n\n                  iii. Althen Prong Three: Proximate Temporal Relationship\n\n        Under Althen Prong Three, petitioners must provide “preponderant proof that the onset of\nsymptoms occurred within a timeframe for which, given the understanding of the disorder’s\netiology, it is medically acceptable to infer causation-in-fact.” De Bazan, 539 F.3d at 1352. The\nacceptable temporal association will vary according to the particular medical theory advanced in the\ncase. See Pafford, 451 F.3d at 1358. A temporal relationship between a vaccine and an injury,\nstanding alone, does not constitute preponderant evidence of vaccine causation. See, e.g., Veryzer\nv. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 (2011) (explaining that “a temporal\nrelationship alone will not demonstrate the requisite causal link and that petitioner must posit a\nmedical theory causally connecting the vaccine and injury”).\n\n                           1. Evaluation of the Evidence\n\n       Petitioners’ experts opined that the temporal interval between J.T.’s vaccinations on March\n1, 2007, and the onset of motor weakness evidenced by her fall when jumping a hurdle on May 24,\n                                                   41\n\f2007, (84-85 days) is appropriate. Respondent’s expert, Dr. Venkatesan, testified that this time\nframe is “a little long” for onset given an immune response or molecular mimicry mechanism. Tr.\n446. However, Dr. Venkatesan stated that it was very difficult to say when J.T.’s symptoms began,\nand that it was “very likely” that her symptoms started earlier than the hurdle event.\n\n        Dr. Steinman testified that the onset of both J.T.’s alleged ADEM and her ALS occurred on\nMay 24, 2007, the day of her track accident, and he also testified that J.T.’s alleged ADEM in turn\ntriggered her ALS. Tr. 80-81, 83. Generally, cause and effect takes time to develop. For example,\nwhen a person is exposed to a virus, there is a time period between exposure and the development\nof symptoms, also known as the “incubation period.”89 In other words, symptom manifestation is\nnot instantaneous following exposure. Petitioners state in their prehearing submission that J.T.’s\nalleged ADEM “eventually triggered her ALS-like condition.” Pet. Prehearing Sub. at 16. Dr.\nSteinman’s testimony as to the onset of ADEM and ALS is thus inconsistent. Moreover, Dr.\nSteinman did not provide a plausible explanation of how or why the initial manifestation of both the\nalleged ADEM and the ALS occurred at the same time, in light of his theory that ADEM caused\nALS.90\n\n        Even assuming, arguendo, that petitioners could satisfy Althen Prong Three by\npreponderantly proving a medically appropriate onset, a temporal relationship alone does not\nconstitute preponderant evidence of vaccine causation. Petitioners failed to establish Althen Prongs\nOne and Two by preponderant evidence, and therefore, they failed to meet their burden of proof as\nto causation.\n\n           c. Alternative Causation\n\n        Because petitioners did not meet their burden of proof on causation, respondent does not\nhave the burden of establishing that a factor unrelated to the vaccination caused J.T.’s injuries. See\nDoe v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1673\"><a href=\"/opinion/1673/doe-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“[petitioner] Doe\nnever established a prima facie case, so the burden (and attendant restrictions on what ‘factors\nunrelated’ the government could argue) never shifted”). Nevertheless, respondent has identified an\nalternative cause of J.T.’s injuries: the FUS P525L ALS gene mutation. Pursuant to the Vaccine\nAct, compensation shall be awarded where the petitioner demonstrates the requirements set forth\nunder the Act by a preponderance of the evidence, and “there is not a preponderance of the evidence\nthat the . . . injury . . . is due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine.” § 300aa-\n13(a)(1)(A)-(B). The Vaccine Act provides that “factors unrelated to the administration of the\nvaccine,” are those “which are shown to have been the agent . . . principally responsible for causing\nthe petitioner’s illness, disability, injury, condition or death.” Id. § 13(a)(2)(B).\n\n      Thus, even if petitioners had established their case by a preponderance of the evidence, their\narguments fail because respondent has proven by preponderant evidence that the FUS P525L ALS\n\n\n89\n  “Incubation period” is defined as “the interval between receipt of infection … and the first\nsymptoms of illness.” Dorland’s at 1415.\n90\n  In Sproviero, a case relied on by Dr. Steinman, the patient had MS and at some later date\ndeveloped ALS. Pet. Ex. 53. Thus, Sproviero does not support Dr. Steinman’s opinion that the\nonset of ADEM and ALS occurred at the same time.\n                                                 42\n\fmutation—a factor unrelated to the administration of the vaccine—is responsible for causing J.T.’s\nJALS and her death.\n\n                   i. Althen Prong One: Respondent’s Medical Theory\n\n        To prove Althen Prong One establishing alternative causation, respondent is required to set\nforth a medical theory explaining how a factor unrelated to the vaccine caused the injury at issue.\nRespondent’s expert, Dr. Raymond, explained the causal theory underlying FUS P525L ALS, as\nfollows: “FUS is a nucleoprotein that functions in DNA and RNA metabolism, including DNA\nrepair, and the regulation of transcription, RNA splicing, and export to the cytoplasm.” Resp. Ex. D\nat 3. “In neurons, FUS is predominantly localized to the nucleus. []Neuropathological analysis of\nbrain and spinal cord of ALS patients carrying FUS mutations show[] cytoplasmic retention and the\nformation of FUS…aggregates.” Resp. Ex. H at 3. The P525L mutation has been “identified as a\ndisease causing mutation …. seen primarily in sporadic cases of juvenile ALS .... [I]ndividuals with\n[this] mutation have an earlier age of onset and a rapid progression” than seen in other types of\nALS.” Id.\n\n        While it is not exactly clear how the FUS P525L mutation causes neuronal degeneration or\nwhy it affects younger patients, literature cited by respondent reveals “mislocalization of mutant\nFUS proteins in neuronal cytoplasm with abnormal FUS protein aggregates that are associated with\nmarkedly disorganize[d] intracellular organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum and\nmitochondria,” which has led to the hypothesis that “mutant FUS proteins [] inhibit normal RNA\nand protein synthesis, thereby suppressing neuronal functions and survival.” Resp. Ex. F at 7.\n\n        Dr. Raymond cites an article by Blokhuis91 in support of this theory. In Blokhuis, the\nauthors discuss “ALS causing gene defects,” including the FUS mutation. Resp. Ex. D8 at 777.\n“FUS mediates a wide range of cellular processes including DNA repair, transcription, splicing and\nmRNA processing. The protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm to function in the\ntransport of mRNA.” Id. at 782. The authors suggests several molecular mechanisms whereby\nprotein aggregation, which occurs due to the mutation, affects neuronal function and causes disease.\nWhile the mechanism is not clear,92 the authors agree that “the fact that mutations in the genes\nencoding these proteins [FUS] segregate with disease in [familial ALS] supports the idea that their\ndysfunction is linked to motor neuron degeneration and disease pathogenesis.” Id. at 788.\n\n       Thus, although the exact mechanism is not understood, there appears to be a consensus by\nthose who have studied the FUS mutation and its association with ALS that FUS mutations\nadversely affect motor neurons and lead to ALS. More specifically, the FUS P525L mutation has\nbeen associated with neuropathological abnormalities, basophilic inclusions and FUS protein\naggregates, which have been linked to motor neuron degeneration. Therefore, I find by a\npreponderance of the evidence that respondent has satisfied Althen Prong One.\n\n\n91\n Anna M. Blokhius et al., Protein Aggregation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 125 ACTA\nNEUROPATHOL. 777 (2013) [Resp. Ex. D8].\n92\n  In an animal study published in 2015, Sharma and colleagues demonstrated that “FUS-dependent\nmotor degeneration [was] not due to loss of FUS function, but to the gain of toxic properties\nconferred by ALS mutations.” Resp. Ex. K at 1.\n\n                                                43\n\f                   ii. Althen Prong Two: A Logical Sequence of Cause and Effect\n\n        The second prong of Althen requires proof of a “logical sequence of cause and effect,”\nshowing that factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine are responsible for causing\nJ.T.’s JALS and subsequent death.\n\n        Dr. Raymond set forth a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the FUS P525L\nmutation caused J.T.’s juvenile ALS. First, J.T.’s clinical course was consistent with ALS and the\nrapid and aggressive course of P525L FUS described in other cases. Resp. Ex. H at 4. J.T. had a\nrapidly progressive decline, characterized by muscular weakness and wasting in her limbs, which is\nconsistent with ALS. She did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy. EMGs and nerve\nconduction tests showed findings consistent with ALS, and J.T. was diagnosed with ALS. J.T.’s\nautopsy showed neuropathological findings consistent with and specific to FUS P525L ALS.\nGenetic testing revealed that she had the FUS-P525L genetic mutation. This mutation has not been\nseen in healthy individuals. J.T. had the genotype-phenotype consistent with other case reports. Dr.\nRaymond testified that it is not necessary to invoke the vaccination as a trigger to explain J.T.’s\ncondition. I agree and find by a preponderance of the evidence that respondent has satisfied Althen\nProng Two.\n\n                  iii. Althen Prong Three: Timing\n\n        The last element of causation is proof of a proximate temporal relationship between the gene\nmutation and the injury. Althen, 418 F. 3d at 1278. The initial manifestation of J.T.’s ALS was age\n13. The age range for juvenile cases of FUS P525L includes children as young as 11 up to age 22.\nJ.T.’s onset occurred at age 13, within this age range. Resp. Ex. H at 4. The duration of her illness,\napproximately 22 months, was also consistent with FUS P525L ALS. Therefore, I find that\nrespondent has satisfied Althen Prong Three.\n\n   VIII. Conclusion\n\n        It is clear from the medical records that petitioners have greatly suffered as a result of their\ndaughter’s illness and tragic death, and I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to petitioners for the\nloss of their child. However, I cannot decide this case based upon my sympathy for petitioners but\nrather by my analysis of the evidence.\n\n        For all of the reasons discussed above, I find that petitioners have not established\nentitlement to compensation and their petition must be dismissed. In the absence of a timely filed\nmotion for review pursuant to Vaccine Rule 23, the Clerk of the Court SHALL ENTER\nJUDGMENT in accordance with this Decision.\n\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n                                            s/Nora Beth Dorsey\n                                            Nora Beth Dorsey\n                                            Chief Special Master\n\n\n\n                                                   44\n\f</pre>",
