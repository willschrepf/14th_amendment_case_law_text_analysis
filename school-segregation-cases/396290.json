Civil Action No. 13-420 (JEB)\nKAYA HENDERSON, Chancellor of the\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools, et al.,\n\n       Defendants.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        A perusal of any newspaper reveals an indisputable truth: People hold strong and\n\ndivergent views regarding the future of public education. Today’s headlines capture rampant\n\ndebates about everything from teachers’ unions to charter schools to the new “Common Core”\n\nState Standards. Conversations about these issues are playing out in legislatures and local\n\ngovernments throughout the country. This fall in the District of Columbia, in fact, voters will\n\nconsider many of these same questions when they head to the polls to elect their city’s leaders,\n\nparticularly since the new mayor will appoint the next D.C. Public Schools Chancellor.\n\n       Plaintiffs in this case – like most parents – care deeply about their children’s education.\n\nTheir sons, daughters, and grandchildren are unhappy about the recent closure of their\n\nneighborhood schools. And Plaintiffs and their children understandably want their old schools\n\nand familiar teachers back. Seeking some avenue by which they might reopen their\n\nneighborhood institutions, these parents and guardians turned to the courts. They sued the\n\nDistrict and its officials, alleging that the closings were discriminatory; that they had a disparate\n\nimpact on poor and minority children; and that reforms like charter schools and performance pay\n\n\n                                                  1\n\ffor teachers will ultimately harm black students in the District. Linking the closures to D.C.’s\n\ntroubled history of segregated and underperforming schools, these parents cry foul. They want\n\nthe reforms to end.\n\n       The core problem here is that the parents’ fight is one for the ballot box – not the courts.\n\nAlthough Plaintiffs dislike charter schools, performance pay, and the increasing number of D.C.\n\nschool closures, there is simply no real evidence that these policies are discriminatory. As a\n\nresult, federal courts have no authority to intervene in these sensitive policy choices, and judges\n\nshould not be the ones to render the final verdict on charter schools, school turnarounds, and\n\nteacher evaluations. Instead, those decisions must be made by the policymakers and experts who\n\nhave, for better or worse, always controlled public education. The Court, consequently, will\n\ngrant the District’s Motion for Summary Judgment and dismiss this case.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Plaintiffs’ case has a history before this Court. Prior to the instant Motion, the Court\n\nevaluated their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, see Smith v. Henderson (Smith I), 944 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 89 (D.D.C. 2013), and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. See Smith v. Henderson (Smith\n\nII), 982 F. Supp. 2d 32 (D.D.C. 2013). Although those Opinions outline some of the basic facts\n\nof this case, Plaintiffs’ evidence has evolved over the course of discovery, and the standard for\n\nsummary judgment, of course, is different. The Court, therefore, revisits the relevant details of\n\nthe school closures.\n\n       A. D.C. Schools and Desegregation\n\n       Plaintiffs’ tale begins at the very beginning: with the city’s earliest school-desegregation\n\nefforts. As a result, the Court will (briefly) survey the history of desegregation, race, and D.C.\n\nPublic Schools.\n\n                                                 2\n\f        Until the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954),\n\nD.C. schools were segregated by law. After Bolling, school desegregation proceeded “slowly\n\nbut steadily” throughout the 1950’s. See Judith Denton Jones, Six School Complex: A\n\nSuccessful Innovation in Washington, D.C.’s Public Schools (1987) (cited frequently by\n\nPlaintiffs).\n\n        In 1967, a D.C. District Court handed down a broad mandate to hasten desegregation in\n\nHobson v. Hansen, 269 F. Supp. 401 (D.D.C. 1967). There, the court found that – even after\n\nBolling – per-pupil expenditures in D.C. were significantly lower for black students; that there\n\nwas a sizable achievement gap between black and white students; and that black students were\n\ndisproportionately “tracked” into low-level classes. Id. at 406. As a result, the court ordered the\n\nschool system to end tracking and to begin busing students from black neighborhoods to white\n\nschools. Id. at 517.\n\n        At the time Hobson was issued, the District had already experienced a wave of white\n\nflight to the suburbs. Id. at 410. By 1967, most white families that remained lived west of Rock\n\nCreek Park in the northwestern quadrant of the city. Id. Their children were concentrated in a\n\nbundle of schools in that same region. Id. at 411-12. The attrition of D.C.’s white population\n\ncontinued over the 1960’s, leading to the closure of many schools in white neighborhoods. See\n\nJones, supra, at 18 (“many white families took their children out of public schools in response to\n\ndesegregation”); id. at 21 (“Schools were being closed all over the city; several in Georgetown\n\nhad already been closed . . . .”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that, during the aftermath of white flight, underpopulated white schools\n\nwere treated more charitably than low-enrollment black schools have been today. In the early\n\n1970’s, schools in Ward 3, which is west of the Park, had largely been depopulated. Id. at 21-22.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fThe city’s solution of busing students in from Anacostia, which is east of the Park, was about to\n\ncome to an end. Id. at 24. Several schools in the area had closed or were about to close. Id. at\n\n21 (schools closing in Georgetown); id. at 26-27 (Western High School phased out, Gordon\n\nJunior High School closed). Parents at six small elementary schools, fearing closure, banded\n\ntogether in an attempt to keep their schools open. In the end, they came up with a plan that\n\ninvolved the closing of two schools and their conversion into a middle school and a resource\n\ncenter, respectively. Id. at 37-38. Four of the original six schools were able to remain open. Id.\n\n       With the end of massive busing programs, however, city schools largely resegregated.\n\nPartially, this is because few white children enroll in D.C. public schools. Today, according to\n\nPlaintiffs’ expert, only about 11% of DCPS students are white. See Opp., Exh. B (Updated\n\nAffidavit of Mary Levy), ¶ 13. The vast majority are students of color – especially east of the\n\nPark. See Parents United for the D.C. Public Schools, Separate and Unequal: The State of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools Fifty Years After Brown and Bolling 8 (2005), available at\n\nhttp://goo.gl/o1XO08.\n\n       To this day, D.C. also suffers from a yawning achievement gap. In 2011, for example,\n\n“D.C. public schools ha[d] the largest achievement gap between black and white students among\n\nthe nation’s major urban school systems.” Lyndsey Layton, D.C. Schools Have Largest Black-\n\nWhite Achievement Gap in Federal Study, Wash. Post, Dec. 7, 2011, available at\n\nhttp://goo.gl/U6Byan.\n\n       B. School Reform\n\n       In 2007, then-Mayor Adrian Fenty brought in Michelle Rhee to lead DCPS, promising to\n\nturn around the school system. See Harry Jaffe, Can Michelle Rhee Save DC Schools?,\n\nWashingtonian, Sept. 2007, available at http://goo.gl/wIIxzk. While schools had previously been\n\n                                                4\n\frun by an elected school board, Rhee was DCPS’s first Chancellor, appointed by the Mayor to\n\ntake the helm of D.C. public education. Id.; D.C. Code § 38-174(a). In her time at DCPS, Rhee\n\nengineered a teacher-evaluation system that focused on student achievement and arranged for\n\ncommensurate performance bonuses for teachers. See Stephanie Simon, Radical Washington\n\nD.C. Teacher-Evaluation Plan Worked, Study Says, Politico, Oct. 17, 2013, available at\n\nhttp://goo.gl/Mn9Tup. She also closed 23 under-enrolled neighborhood schools as the\n\nproportion of students in charter schools – which are publicly funded but privately run schools of\n\nchoice – rose to about 40%. See Sarah Childress, After Michelle Rhee: What Happened Next in\n\nD.C.’s Schools, Frontline, Jan. 8, 2013, available at http://goo.gl/HCPeSL. Rhee’s tenure in\n\nD.C. was undoubtedly controversial. When she left office after Fenty’s defeat at the polls, she\n\nwas considered a scourge of D.C. public education by some and a hero by many others. See id.\n\nThe current Chancellor, Kaya Henderson, was Rhee’s deputy and has continued many of her\n\npolicies, much to Plaintiffs’ chagrin. See id. This includes the use of rigorous teacher\n\nevaluations and performance bonuses, as well as a cooperative attitude toward charter schools.\n\n       C. Current School Closings\n\n       Partially as a result of changing demographics and partially due to the rise of charter\n\nschools, Chancellor Henderson inherited several schools that were under-enrolled. She also\n\nknew that several schools lacked the academic programming that she believed all D.C. students\n\nshould receive. For instance, Henderson hoped all elementary schools could offer students 45\n\nminutes per week of art, music, physical education, library, and a foreign language, but not all\n\nschools provided those offerings. Mot., Exh. B (Deposition of Kaya Henderson) at 134:16-\n\n135:5. The funding simply was not there.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       Henderson thus sought advice from consulting companies and from her staff on how to\n\nuse District resources more efficiently. When the consultants recommended closing schools, the\n\nChancellor convened a working group to determine which, if any, to close. That group\n\nconsidered several criteria, including “student enrollment” in each school, “building capacity,”\n\n“whether the facility itself has been recently renovated or modernized,” and “programming” at\n\nschools “in that area.” Mot., Exh. D (Deposition of Lisa Ruda) at 22:12-23:12.\n\n       In the end, Henderson proposed closing twenty DCPS buildings over the course of the\n\n2013-14 and 2014-15 school years. See ECF No. 18-2 (Office of Chancellor, DCPS, DCPS\n\nProposed Consolidations and Reorganization: Better Schools for All Students (“Proposed\n\nConsolidation Plan”) (Nov. 15, 2012)) at 16. The majority of the schools slated to be closed\n\noperated at half capacity, and five schools were under 25% full. See id. at 17-22. DCPS\n\nexplained that closing these under-enrolled schools would allow it to spend less money per pupil\n\non overhead, while putting more students in modern facilities and giving them access to\n\nprograms and staff that can be justified only for large schools. See id. at 11-14.\n\n       All of the schools to be closed sat in majority-minority, lower-income neighborhoods east\n\nof Rock Creek Park, in Wards 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. See id. at 16. Some of those schools had been\n\ndrained of their students by the increasing popularity of charter schools. For example, around\n\n50% of children attend charter schools in Wards 1, 5, and 7, and about 40% attend charters in\n\nWards 4, 6, and 8. Id. at 8. Henderson’s proposal suggested no school closings in Ward 3,\n\nwhich is more white, more affluent, and west of the Park, or in Ward 1, which also contains\n\nseveral whiter, wealthier neighborhoods. See id. at 23. The District claimed that this was\n\nbecause facilities were being used efficiently in those Wards, with the building-utilization rate at\n\n74% in Ward 1 and 109% in Ward 3. Id. at 23.\n\n                                                 6\n\f       To gather feedback on its proposal, DCPS (i) convened community meetings throughout\n\nthe city regarding the proposal, drawing 780 participants; (ii) called and held office hours with\n\nAdvisory Neighborhood Commissioners; and (iii) launched an online forum for those who could\n\nnot make the meetings. See id. at 27-28; Office of Chancellor, DCPS, Better Schools for All\n\nStudents: DCPS’ Consolidation and Reorganization Plan (“Final Consolidation Plan”) 2-3 (Jan.\n\n2013), available at http://goo.gl/XA8VSy. The City Council also held two hearings on the\n\nclosures. See Final Consolidation Plan at 2-3.\n\n       In the end, DCPS made various changes to its initial plan based on community feedback,\n\nincluding keeping open five schools originally proposed for closure. See id. at 4-5. Plaintiffs\n\nclaim in their brief that the five schools DCPS preserved contained more white students than the\n\nschools that were closed, although they provide no citation to support that proposition. See Opp.\n\nat 29 (DCPS “intentionally removed from the initial closure list the only two schools with\n\nsignificant numbers of white students.”); id. at 9 n.8 (providing statistics but no source).\n\n       DCPS estimated that savings from the revised proposal would total $8.5 million and\n\nanticipated that those funds would be re-invested in schools throughout the city. See Final\n\nConsolidation Plan at 6. Plaintiffs argue that similar benefits projected from Rhee’s closures in\n\n2008 never materialized and that the projected benefits from this proposal would thus likely turn\n\nout to be overblown. See Opp., Exh. F (Office of the D.C. Auditor, Audit of the Closure and\n\nConsolidation of 23 D.C. Public Schools (Sept. 6, 2012)) at 4. Nevertheless, Chancellor\n\nHenderson confirms that cost savings from the closures did indeed materialize and that the extra\n\nfunding has been used to “ensur[e] a consistent level of . . . programmatic offers at all our\n\nelementary schools,” so that each school now has a librarian as well as art, music, gym, and\n\nforeign languages. Henderson Depo. at 134:16-135:5.\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\f       DCPS also published proposals for how the empty school buildings might be used. The\n\nDistrict estimated that most schools would be retained in DCPS inventory, but suggested that\n\nsome might be used by charter schools. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 26. Plaintiffs thus\n\nclaim that the closings were undertaken to open up space for charter schools, rather than for the\n\nbenefit of DCPS students. See, e.g., Opp. at 4.\n\n       All fifteen schools on the final closure list lie east of the Park, meaning the students are\n\ndisproportionately black and Latino. In DCPS schools as a whole, according to Plaintiffs’\n\nexpert, 69% of students are black; 16% are Hispanic; 4% are Asian, other, or unknown; and 11%\n\nare white. See Levy Aff., ¶ 13. In the closed schools, by contrast, 93% of students were black;\n\n6.6% were Hispanic; and fewer than 0.2% (six students) were white. Id.\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that this disparity is intentional, either because it is stark enough to be\n\ninexplicable on grounds other than race, or because it was motivated by discriminatory animus.\n\n       D. Procedural Background\n\n       Five Plaintiffs originally filed this suit against Chancellor Henderson, Mayor Vincent\n\nGray, and the District of Columbia as Defendants. The case was removed from Superior Court\n\nin April 2013, and Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction was denied in May of that\n\nyear. See Smith I, 944 F. Supp. 2d 89. Two of the original Plaintiffs – Karlene Armstead and\n\nEricka Black – and two Plaintiffs who were later added to the Complaint – Keith Kone and\n\nPhomika “Pho” Palmer – were ANC Commissioners. The other three original Plaintiffs –\n\nShannon Smith, Marlece Turner, and Brenda Williams – are parents or guardians of children\n\nwho attended closed schools. See id. at 95. All of the guardians’ children are black or Hispanic\n\nand live east of the Park. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       In their original Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that the District violated D.C. statutes\n\nrequiring notice to ANC Commissioners of the school closures, the D.C. Sunshine Amendment,\n\nthe Constitution’s equal-protection guarantee (asserted under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct, the Rehabilitation Act, and the D.C. Human Rights Act. See id. In their Amended\n\nComplaint, Plaintiffs added two additional state-law claims. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 103-09.\n\n       The Court ruled on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in October 2013, ultimately\n\ndismissing the ANC Commissioners as Plaintiffs and the lion’s share of Plaintiffs’ claims. See\n\nSmith II, 982 F. Supp. 2d 32. What remains are Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection, Title VI, and\n\nDCHRA claims alleging discrimination. Defendants now move for summary judgment,\n\ncontending that there is no evidence that they discriminated against Plaintiffs and their children.\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n       A. Summary Judgment\n\n       Summary judgment may be granted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986); Holcomb v.\n\nPowell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). A fact is “material” if it is capable of affecting the\n\nsubstantive outcome of the litigation. See Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248; Holcomb, 433 F.3d at\n\n895. A dispute is “genuine” if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict\n\nfor the nonmoving party. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007); Liberty Lobby, 477\n\nU.S. at 248; Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 895. “A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely\n\ndisputed must support the assertion” by “citing to particular parts of materials in the record” or\n\n“showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute,\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\for that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c)(1).\n\n       When a motion for summary judgment is under consideration, “[t]he evidence of the non-\n\nmovant[s] is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [their] favor.”\n\nLiberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255; see also Mastro v. PEPCO, 447 F.3d 843, 850 (D.C. Cir. 2006);\n\nAka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc). On a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the Court must “eschew making credibility determinations or weighing the\n\nevidence.” Czekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d 360, 363 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n       The nonmoving party’s opposition, however, must consist of more than mere\n\nunsupported allegations or denials and must be supported by affidavits, declarations, or other\n\ncompetent evidence, setting forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986). The nonmovant is\n\nrequired to provide evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find in its favor. See\n\nLaningham v. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\n       B. Motion to Strike\n\n        Although courts typically view evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\nparty, Defendants here argue that some of Plaintiffs’ evidence should not be considered at all.\n\nThat is because the evidence was not disclosed during discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c).\n\nBroadly speaking, this evidence falls into three categories: (i) affidavits from experts and other\n\nwitnesses whose identities were not disclosed; (ii) publicly available reports from policy groups;\n\nand (iii) some updated affidavits from Plaintiffs’ witness Mary Levy.\n\n       According to the Federal Rules, “If a party fails to provide information or identify a\n\nwitness as required by [the Rules], the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to\n\n                                                 10\n\fsupply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially\n\njustified or is harmless.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Local rules echo that requirement. See\n\nLCvR 26.2(a) (“A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information . . . or\n\nto amend a prior response to discovery . . . , is not, unless such failure is harmless, permitted to\n\nuse as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information not so\n\ndisclosed.”). Here, Plaintiffs appear to admit that they did not timely identify several witnesses\n\nand that they never furnished the District with the relevant reports. See Opp. to Mot. to Strike\n\nat 13.\n\n         For the Court to consider the evidence at issue, then, Plaintiffs must show that the failure\n\n“was substantially justified” or “harmless.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Generally, “[t]he harm\n\nfrom the failure to disclose a witness flows from the unfair surprise hindering the prejudiced\n\nparty’s ability to examine and contest that witness’ evidence.” Elion v. Jackson, 544 F. Supp.\n\n2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2008). “If the court” accepts “eleventh-hour declarations,” then the District\n\n“would effectively be deprived of the opportunity to depose [Plaintiffs’] new witnesses.”\n\nUnited States ex rel. Purcell v. MWI Corp., 824 F. Supp. 2d 12, 19 (D.D.C. 2011). The District\n\nwould also have to unexpectedly gather rebuttal evidence at a moment’s notice, which could\n\ncause substantial harm to its case. Id.\n\n         Considering first the affidavits supplied by “surprise” witnesses and experts, the Court\n\nfinds that their late disclosure was neither “substantially justified” nor “harmless.” Plaintiffs\n\nclaim that their slew of additional experts is justified because they just now “learned that\n\nDefendants’ ‘only’” purported “purpose[] for closing the schools w[as] ‘improving DCPS\n\nresource allocation and . . . educational experiences for DCPS students.” Opp. to Mot. to Strike\n\nat 10. Put plainly, this statement is absurd. Improving efficiency and programming has always\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f been the District’s stated reason for closing schools. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 5-15.\n\n Plaintiffs’ new expert testimony, moreover, is not “harmless,” since Plaintiffs have robbed the\n\n District of the opportunity to depose or otherwise rebut the new evidence prior to summary\n\n judgment. To be sure, DCPS would not be severely prejudiced if the affidavits were admitted,\n\n since the Court would reach the same decision even if it considered the experts’ arguments. But\n\n in the interest of fairness, the Court will exclude those affidavits, except for one that was\n\n proffered earlier in this litigation. See Opp., Exhs. C, W, X; but see Opp., Exh. S (same\n\n affidavit submitted to Court in ECF No. 8-19).\n\n       Moving to the next two categories of materials, the Court finds that these yield a different\n\n result. The reports to which Defendants object are publicly available and hence could easily be\n\n the subject of judicial notice. See Kaempe v. Myers, 367 F.3d 958, 965 (D.C. Cir. 2004)\n\n (public documents subject to notice); Opp., Exhs. E, G, H, K, T, U (public reports); but see\n\n Opp., Exh. V (not obviously publicly available and hence excluded). Considering them would,\n\n therefore, be harmless. Similarly, regarding the updated Levy affidavits, DCPS already knew\n\n that she would be testifying at trial and had the chance to depose her. The new information\n\n contained in those affidavits appears largely to incorporate updated statistics that the District\n\n itself only recently made available. See Opp., Exhs. B, R. The integration of this information\n\n into updated or additional affidavits is therefore both justified and harmless.\n\n       Having resolved that question, the Court proceeds to the merits.\n\nIII.   Analysis\n\n       To support what remains of their case of discrimination, the parents advance a number of\n\n theories. First, they claim that under-enrolled schools in white neighborhoods have never been\n\n closed – or, at least, that the District made a greater effort to save those schools back in the\n\n                                                  12\n\f1970’s. Next, they maintain that the reasons given for the closures are a façade. Instead of\n\nwanting to improve the resources allocated to all DCPS schools, as Henderson and her staff\n\nclaimed, Plaintiffs contend that schools were closed to meet two objectives: to fund teacher\n\nbonuses – which disproportionately go to whiter schools – and to make room for more charters.\n\nBoth of these initiatives, the parents assert, are discriminatory and impermissible.\n\n       In analyzing Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court begins by considering its authority to resolve\n\ncertain policy disputes raised by the parents and then proceeds to separate analyses of Plaintiffs’\n\nfederal and local causes of action.\n\n       A. Policy Questions\n\n       As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that many of Plaintiffs’ arguments cannot be\n\nproperly addressed or resolved by a federal judge. That is because the contentions are political\n\nrather than legal. For example, portions of the briefing boil down to the following syllogism:\n\n(1) Charter schools and performance pay for teachers are bad policies that Plaintiffs dislike; (2)\n\nThe District “illigetimate[ly]” closed neighborhood schools to support charter schools and\n\nperformance pay; (3) Therefore, the closures should not be allowed. Opp. at 40. Taking another\n\ntack, Plaintiffs also contend that school closures are generally bad for kids and do not really save\n\nmoney; therefore, they say, the Court should re-open the closed schools.\n\n       As a matter of policy, there is sharp disagreement on those issues. Some studies tend to\n\nshow that charter schools, if well managed, can be incredibly successful, and many major urban\n\ndistricts have embraced this reform. See, e.g., The Boston Foundation, Informing the Debate:\n\nComparing Boston’s Charter, Pilot and Traditional Schools 9 (Jan. 2009) (Boston charter schools\n\nproduce positive results); CREDO, National Charter School Study 36-37 (2013) (charter schools\n\nhave positive impact for children living in poverty); Christina Clark Tuttle, et al., Student\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fCharacteristics and Achievement in 22 KIPP Middle Schools at xi (2010) (KIPP schools had\n\nsignificant, positive impact on student achievement). Other studies cast doubt on the efficacy of\n\ncharters. See Diane Ravitch, The Myth of Charter Schools, N.Y. Rev. of Books, Nov. 11, 2010,\n\navailable at http://goo.gl/lDYktL (among charter schools “17 percent were superior to a matched\n\ntraditional public school; 37 percent were worse than the public school; and the remaining 46\n\npercent had academic gains no different from that of a similar public school”). The same is true\n\nof performance pay correlated to student achievement. Compare Victor Lavy, Performance Pay\n\nand Teachers’ Effort, Productivity, and Grading Ethics, Am. Econ. Rev. 3-4, Dec. 2009,\n\n(performance pay works), with Steven Glazerman & Allison Seifullah, An Evaluation of the\n\nChicago Teacher Advancement Program (Chicago TAP) After Four Years xiv (Mar. 2012)\n\n(bonuses do not necessarily impact achievement). School closures, too, receive mixed reviews.\n\nThey have been embraced, for example, by the federal Department of Education as one of four\n\n“turnaround” models for failing schools. See School Improvement Grants, 75 Fed. Reg. 66,363,\n\n66,366 (Oct. 28, 2010). They have also been panned by certain critics. See Opp., Exh. U\n\n(CReATE, Research Brief on School Closures (Mar. 2013)) at 1 (school closures cause lower\n\ntest scores and higher dropout rates).\n\n       For any policymaker, whether to embrace these reforms is a difficult question that\n\nrequires expert judgment. For courts, it is simply an impossible – indeed, an impermissible –\n\nquestion to answer. “[C]ontroversies which revolve around policy choices and value\n\ndeterminations,” are, after all, generally “committed” to the people’s representatives “for\n\nresolution.” Japan Whaling Ass’n v. Am. Cetacean Soc., 478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986). Judges are\n\n“particularly ill suited to make such decisions, as ‘courts are fundamentally underequipped to\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fformulate . . . policies or develop standards for matters not legal in nature.’” Id. (quoting United\n\nStates ex rel. Joseph v. Cannon, 642 F.2d 1373, 1379 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).\n\n         Whether charter schools, performance pay, and school turnarounds are worthwhile policy\n\ntools is a question for school superintendents and state legislatures. There is no governable legal\n\nstandard for assessing the promise of those reforms. Careers in the education sector will likely\n\nbe launched and shattered on the success or failure of those movements. It is not for courts to\n\nsay whether, in the faraway future, researchers will finally concur on whether these initiatives\n\nsucceeded or failed. Instead, the only question for the Court to address is whether these reforms\n\nare illegal – in other words, are they inherently discriminatory or discriminatory as applied to\n\nPlaintiffs’ children? Answering that question, as it turns out, is a tough hill for Plaintiffs to\n\nclimb.\n\n         B. Equal Protection and Title VI\n\n         Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that the District’s school\n\nclosures discriminated against their children on the basis of disability, residence, and race in\n\nviolation of the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment. See Am. Compl., ¶ 95;\n\nBolling, 347 U.S. 497. Plaintiffs’ briefing, however, advances only claims of racial\n\ndiscrimination, so the Court will treat the disability and residence arguments as conceded.\n\nPlaintiffs also brought suit under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects against\n\ndiscrimination based on race, color, and national origin in District schools. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000d (“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin,\n\nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination\n\nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f       Both Equal Protection and Title VI claims require a showing of intentional\n\ndiscrimination. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-65\n\n(1977) (“[O]fficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially\n\ndisproportionate impact. . . . Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to\n\nshow a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.”); Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 280\n\n(2001) (“[I]t is similarly beyond dispute – and no party disagrees – that [42 U.S.C. § 2000d]\n\nprohibits only intentional discrimination.”). Proving intentional discrimination is notoriously\n\ndifficult, absent direct evidence of a discriminatory rationale. After all, discriminatory intent\n\n“implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the\n\ndecisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because\n\nof,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Pers. Adm’r of\n\nMass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979) (citation omitted); see also Arlington Heights, 429\n\nU.S. at 265-66 (discriminatory intent need be only a “motivating factor in the decision”). Run-\n\nof-the-mill disparate impact – that is, the fact that a policy disproportionately hurts a certain\n\ngroup – does not clear this hurdle. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 264-65.\n\n       Because the school-closure plan is race neutral on its face, Plaintiffs must prove either\n\nthat the District’s plan has been applied differently depending on students’ race, see Yick Wo. v.\n\nHopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-74 (1886), or that it was actually motivated by discriminatory\n\nanimus and has achieved its discriminatory goal. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265-66;\n\nGomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 346-47 (1960).\n\n       To repeat, the parents advance three main arguments as to why the closings were, in fact,\n\ndiscriminatory. First, they assert that, since the 1970’s, the District’s school-closure policy has\n\nbeen applied differently to white schools, which have been kept open, than to black schools,\n\n                                                  16\n\fwhich have been closed when under-enrolled. Second, they contend that the school closures\n\nwere intended to fund performance bonuses for teachers in disproportionately white schools, and\n\nhence the closings themselves were discriminatory. Third, they posit that the closings were\n\nundertaken to create more room for charter schools, which they also view as discriminatory. The\n\nCourt addresses each theory in turn.\n\n                       1. Discriminatory Application of Closures\n\n       Plaintiffs first argue that the District has applied its school-closure policy in a\n\ndiscriminatory manner. That is, even if DCPS does have a policy of closing under-enrolled\n\nschools, that policy is only actually applied to black schools. Black students, as a result, are\n\nintentionally made to suffer as white students escape unscathed. According to Plaintiffs, “DCPS\n\nhas historically protected schools west of the Park,” which are disproportionately white. Opp. at\n\n8. The parents claim that “no Ward 3 school was closed” in the 1970’s, even when schools were\n\nseverely under-enrolled. Id. By contrast, Chancellor Rhee recently closed 23 schools east of the\n\nPark, and Chancellor Henderson has now closed 15 additional schools in those same\n\nneighborhoods. Clearly, Plaintiffs state, this shows a consistent pattern of discrimination from\n\nthe 1970’s to today.\n\n       The problems with this argument are manifold. To begin with, comparing District\n\ngovernance in the 1970’s with the state of DCPS today is not a terribly productive exercise.\n\nKaya Henderson – the relevant decisionmaker in this case – was so young in the early 1970’s\n\nthat she was not yet eligible to attend public school, let alone run a district. More importantly, at\n\nthat time, DCPS was overseen by an elected school board and did not even have a Chancellor,\n\nwho is appointed by the Mayor. Cf., e.g., Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2629\n\n(2013) (criticizing the use of “40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day” in\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fthe civil-rights context); Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,\n\n551 U.S. 701, 736-37 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.) (observing the difference between\n\npolicies in place during desegregation and today’s thorny policy problems of de facto\n\nsegregation). Plaintiffs, moreover, present no evidence of any actual policy – formal or informal\n\n– that began in the 1970’s and somehow survived to this day. Today’s school-closure criteria\n\nmay well differ from whatever rubric was applied in the 1970’s. On this record, no reasonable\n\njury could find any useful connection between the events of the 1970’s and today’s school\n\nclosings.\n\n       Even if the 1970’s closures could meaningfully be linked those closures in 2013, the\n\nDistrict’s actions cannot be construed as intentionally discriminatory. To make out an Equal\n\nProtection case, Plaintiffs need to show “a clear pattern” of discrimination, “unexplainable on\n\ngrounds other than race.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266. This they cannot do. Comparison\n\nto the relevant Supreme Court opinions outlining intentionally discriminatory treatment\n\nillustrates the point. In Yick Wo, “uncontradicted” evidence “show[ed] that all Chinese\n\napplications” to lawfully run urban laundromats were “in fact, denied, and those of Caucasians”\n\n– who operated exactly the same sort of laundries – were “granted.” 118 U.S. at 361. Thus,\n\nwhites were free to pursue their livelihood unmolested, while Asians in the same profession were\n\narrested and harassed. In Gomillion, a city’s boundaries were redrawn “to remove from the city\n\nall save only four or five of its 400 Negro voters while not removing a single white voter or\n\nresident.” 364 U.S. at 341. The inference of discrimination thus was inescapable.\n\n       In the District, by contrast, it appears that significant numbers of both white and black\n\nschools have been closed when their facilities were under-utilized. Although Plaintiffs claim that\n\n“no Ward 3 school was closed” in the 1970’s, their own historical sources flatly contradict this\n\n                                                18\n\faccount. Ward 3 parents banded together in the 1970’s, after all, precisely because “‘[s]chools\n\nwere being closed all over the city’” – including in Ward 3 – “‘and several in Georgetown had\n\nalready been closed.’” Jones, supra, at 21. And of the six schools with which white parents\n\nwere most concerned, two were actually shuttered. Id. at 37-38. The historic treatment of white\n\nschools and the current treatment of black schools, in other words, is not so different.\n\n        No one is denying that the racial disparities in the recent closings are striking. In the\n\nclosed schools, after all, a startling 93% of students were black and fewer than 0.2% (six\n\nstudents) were white. See Levy Aff., ¶ 13. But here, the disparity appears to be caused by the\n\nlocation of the under-enrolled schools, not by intentional discrimination. In the 1970’s, there\n\nwere many under-enrolled schools west of the Park, in whiter neighborhoods; now, they lie to\n\nthe east. There is no evidence that schools west of the Park would be treated differently if they\n\nonce again became under-enrolled. While it is indeed regrettable that our city schools have\n\nbecome so segregated, it is residential segregation, along with changing population patterns, that\n\nis largely to blame for the disparities in the closures.\n\n        Similarly, in Yick Wo and Gomillion “no reason for” the disparate treatment “was\n\nshown, and the conclusion” could not “be resisted, that no reason for it exist[ed] except hostility\n\nto” race. Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 374. Here, by contrast, the record is replete with compelling,\n\nrace-neutral reasons for the District’s actions. As DCPS noted when it announced the closures,\n\n“Too many of our schools are under-enrolled. As a result, we spend too much on maintaining\n\nsmall schools rather than investing in quality programs for students.” Final Consolidation Plan\n\nat 1. A majority of the schools slated for closure were between 9% and 55% full. See Proposed\n\nConsolidation Plan at 17-22. In determining which schools to close, the District looked at four\n\nfactors: “1. Student enrollment and population changes in the community; 2. Building utilization\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\frates; 3. The building condition and its modernization status; and 4. The availability of ‘receiving\n\nschools’ to offer students an improved experience.” Final Consolidation Plan at 1. None of\n\nthose factors deals with race, and each makes sense in the context of increasing efficiency and\n\nproviding all DCPS students with an improved educational experience. Plaintiffs, moreover,\n\noffer no evidence that the schools slated for closure failed to meet these criteria, or that any Ward\n\n3 school would have fit the bill better. In fact, overall, Ward 3 schools – which are\n\ndisproportionately white – are now over-enrolled. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 23.\n\nViewing the closure criteria as a pretext for discrimination is therefore implausible as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n       On top of that, now that the schools have closed, the District has indeed used the money\n\nsaved to meet at least one of its stated goals: ensuring that “[a]ll schools can offer robust\n\nprogramming.” Final Consolidation Plan at 1. Although Plaintiffs feared that these closings –\n\nlike the last round of closures – would save no money at all, that does not appear to be the case.\n\nAccording to Henderson, some of the savings have been used to guarantee “that every\n\nelementary school is offering the four core subject areas, social studies, science, math and\n\nEnglish language arts, and at least 45 minutes a week of art, music, P.E., library, and foreign\n\nlanguage instruction.” Henderson Depo. at 134:19-135:5. No reasonable jury would view those\n\nchanges as a threadbare façade for racial discrimination.\n\n       In its last Opinion, the Court wondered if Plaintiffs’ theory of differential treatment\n\nwould prove “too slender a reed on which to hang” its case. See Smith II, 982 F. Supp. 2d at 50.\n\nGiven the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence produced by the District showing that its\n\ndecision was race neutral, the thin reed supporting Plaintiffs’ case has indeed snapped. On the\n\ncurrent record, no reasonable jury could infer intentional discrimination in the school closures.\n\n                                                 20\n\f                          2. Performance Pay and Other Resources\n\n        Perhaps sensing the weakness of their argument-in-chief, Plaintiffs rally around another\n\ntheory in their most recent filings. They now claim that the schools were closed to help fund\n\nperformance bonuses for highly effective teachers. Because those bonuses are disproportionately\n\nawarded to teachers at white schools, Plaintiffs contend that the closings were discriminatory.\n\nSee Opp., Exh. R (Second Affidavit of Mary Levy), ¶ 21. This is a convoluted argument, to say\n\nthe least.\n\n        To begin with, the proposition that schools were closed to fund teacher bonuses is not\n\nsupported by any evidence properly on the record. 1 Even if the Court were to look to the one\n\n(now-stricken) affidavit touching on this theory, it alleges only that closures were discussed in\n\n2009-10 as one possible method for funding performance incentives. See Opp., Exh. W\n\n(Affidavit of Marni Barron), ¶ 12. The witness does not and cannot say that, several years later\n\nand with an entirely different Chancellor, the District actually closed schools for this purpose.\n\n        In any event, even if schools were closed to fund teacher bonuses, Plaintiffs would still\n\nnot prevail. Despite the fact that performance bonuses are disproportionately awarded to\n\nteachers at white schools, Plaintiffs have not shown that this is a result of intentional\n\ndiscrimination. By all accounts, these bonuses are awarded to teachers based on race-neutral\n\nperformance metrics. See, e.g., DCPS, IMPACTplus for Teachers 1-5, available at\n\nhttp://goo.gl/pqiyZf. This is not to say that the District should be proud of the fact that its best\n\nteachers work mostly in whiter, more affluent schools. Still, Plaintiffs’ argument relies entirely\n\non disparate impact, which is not enough to make out an Equal Protection claim. See Arlington\n\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 264-65. Indeed, this claim piggybacks disparate impact – in terms of\n\n\n        1\n          Plaintiffs cite, by Bates-stamp, one e-mail on the subject sent by DCPS employee Peter Weber. But that\ne-mail was not submitted as an exhibit to their Opposition, and the Court cannot locate it.\n\n                                                       21\n\fperformance pay – on top of disparate impact – in terms of the school closures. No reasonable\n\njury could find intentional discrimination based on that attenuated logic.\n\n       Along the same lines, Plaintiffs contend that other resources – like traditionally certified\n\nteachers and upgraded facilities – are also disproportionately concentrated west of the Park. See,\n\ne.g., Opp., Exh. T (Dep’t of Educ., Data Snapshot: Teacher Equity (Mar. 2014)) at 12; Exh. G\n\n(21st Century School Fund, DCPS Overall Spending on New and Completely Modernized\n\nSchools (Jan. 2011)) at 1-2. This, they say, has driven students out of schools east of the Park,\n\nresulting in school closures. Again, this is a disparate-impact argument. Plaintiffs present no\n\nlink between decisions to spend money renovating schools and racial animus – as opposed to\n\nbasing those determinations on, say, the age of the facilities. Similarly, alternative-certification\n\nteachers, like Teach For America corps members, may be disproportionately drawn to low-\n\nincome schools east of the Park, pursuant to TFA’s mission to close the achievement gap.\n\nFinally, the lawsuit challenges the closings as discriminatory, not the conditions that led to the\n\nclosings. In sum, as Plaintiffs proffer no link to intentional discrimination, their claims cannot\n\nproceed.\n\n                       3. Charter Schools\n\n       Plaintiffs next claim that their neighborhood schools were closed to make room for\n\ncharters. They offer no explanation as to why the expansion of charter schools is discriminatory,\n\nexcept to say that it seems sinister that there are no charters in the whiter, more affluent Ward 3.\n\nSee Opp. at 11. To be sure, the population of charter schools in D.C. is disproportionately black.\n\nSee D.C. Public Charter School Board, Facts About D.C. PCSB and Charter Schools 2 (Oct.\n\n2013), available at http://tinyurl.com/onwvjtc. But students who attend charters choose to go to\n\ncharters. And they do so because, on average, charters are higher performing than DCPS\n\n                                                 22\n\fschools. Id. at 3-4. To argue that helping charters – which are, in D.C., higher-achieving schools\n\nof choice – is somehow nefarious and discriminatory beggars belief. That is not to say that most\n\nparents, given the choice, would not pick a high-performing school next door over a high-\n\nperforming charter halfway across the city. It is simply to acknowledge that the District cannot\n\nbe discriminating by attempting to provide all children with access to higher-achieving schools.\n\nOn top of that, Plaintiffs offer no real evidence that their schools were actually closed to make\n\nway for charters – other than, somewhat ironically, complaints from charter schools that the\n\nDistrict was not providing them with enough space. See Opp., Exh. O (E-mail from De’Shawn\n\nWright, D.C. Mayor’s Office, to Terry Golden, Bailey Capital (July 11, 2012)). Based on this\n\nevidence, no reasonable jury could find an Equal Protection or Title VI violation here.\n\n                       4. Other Arguments\n\n       Plaintiffs offer a smattering of other arguments, including a stray remark by former\n\nChancellor Rhee and a host of contentions about how school closures harm rather than help\n\nstudents. The stray remark, as Defendants point out, is double hearsay: a report in a city paper\n\nabout an “anonymous” government official who allegedly heard Rhee offer to make more seats\n\navailable for white students. See Opp. at 12. As such, it is inadmissible. See Fed. R. Evid. 802.\n\nIn terms of the impact of school closures, no one doubts that having their neighborhood school\n\nshuttered and their favorite teachers dispersed can be traumatic for students. The parents and\n\ngrandparents here have outlined in detail the negative impact that the closures have had on their\n\nkids. See, e.g., Opp., Exh. I (Affidavit of Marlece Turner); Exh. J (Affidavit of Shannon Marie\n\nSmith). Sensitive to this plight, the Court would simply note that overhauling a school system –\n\nand D.C.’s has traditionally been one of the worst in the country – involves hard choices. The\n\nChancellor has judged that some short-term discomfort for students in the closed schools is\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fnecessary to provide a better education for D.C. children overall. That decision is hers to make,\n\nas long as it is not based on race. The Court must yield to the District’s non-discriminatory\n\npolicy choices.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs dredge up a litany of precedents addressing the immediate aftermath of\n\nde jure segregation, suggesting that the Court treat D.C. schools today like the Supreme Court\n\ntreated districts in the wake of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).\n\nSee, e.g., Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218 (1964); Swann\n\nv. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 20-21 (1971). No one doubts that the pre-\n\nBolling period of forced segregation has left long-lasting scars on the city and its schools. But\n\nwhat policymakers are grappling with here is the current state of de facto segregation in the city.\n\nAs a result, different standards apply. See Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs., 551 U.S. at 735-36\n\n(explaining the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation); Spurlock v. Fox, 716 F.3d\n\n383, 386 (6th Cir. 2013) (same). In addition, as the Court noted in its prior Opinion, it highly\n\ndoubts that Brown and its progeny could properly be stretched to prevent the closure of highly\n\nsegregated, largely deserted, under-performing schools and to keep minority children from being\n\ntransferred to higher-performing, less segregated schools nearby. See Smith I, 944 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n102-03. As a result, the appeal to Brown-era cases cannot save Plaintiffs’ cause.\n\n       C. D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n       The D.C. Human Rights Act, like Title VI and Equal Protection, guards against racial\n\ndiscrimination. It also prohibits discrimination based on residence, among other things. The\n\nDCHRA states in part: “Except as otherwise provided for by District law or when otherwise\n\nlawfully and reasonably permitted, it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for a District\n\ngovernment agency or office to limit or refuse to provide any facility, service, program, or\n\n                                                24\n\fbenefit to any individual on the basis of an individual’s actual or perceived: race, . . .\n\ndisability, . . . or place of residence . . . .” D.C. Code § 2-1402.73. The Act’s “effects clause”\n\nprohibits unjustified disparate impact, in addition to intentional discrimination: “Any practice\n\nwhich has the effect or consequence of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be\n\ndeemed to be an unlawful discriminatory practice.” D.C. Code § 2-1402.68; see also Gay Rights\n\nCoal. of Georgetown Univ. Law Ctr. v. Georgetown Univ., 536 A.2d 1, 29 (D.C. 1987) (en banc)\n\n(“despite the absence of any intention to discriminate, practices are unlawful if they bear\n\ndisproportionately on a protected class and are not independently justified for some\n\nnondiscriminatory reason”). A defendant may protect against such a disparate-impact claim by\n\nshowing that her decision was justified by a neutral, nondiscriminatory reason, as outlined in\n\nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971). See Gay Rights Coal., 536 A.2d at 29.\n\n       According to Plaintiffs’ Complaint, the effect of the school closings constitutes\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, disability, and residency. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 59-67. In\n\ntheir Opposition, however, they do not attempt to defend their claims based on disability,\n\nchoosing instead to move forward with only race- and residence-based charges. Assuming that\n\nthe school transfers have led to the denial of benefits and services, the numbers bear out\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim of disparate impact: Black and Hispanic students make up 85% of the overall\n\nschool district, but 99.6% of students in the schools to be closed. See Levy Aff., ¶ 13. And\n\nbecause school assignments depend on a child’s home address, the school closings\n\ndisproportionately affect people who reside in specific areas of the city. The school closings,\n\ntherefore, obviously bear disproportionately on students of color and students who reside east of\n\nthe Park.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\f       The District thus wisely relies on the argument that its actions were “independently\n\njustified for some nondiscriminatory reason.” Gay Rights Coal., 536 A.2d at 29. In other words,\n\nDCPS closed these schools to save much-needed money, which could then be spent to improve\n\neducation for all District students. Closing under-enrolled schools, moreover, was necessary to\n\nfree up funding so that elementary schools could uniformly be equipped with the same basic\n\nprogrammatic offerings. As discussed above, see supra, III.B.1, the District’s evidence on this\n\npoint is clear, compelling, and uncontroverted. This is fairly remarkable, given that DCPS threw\n\nopen its records to Plaintiffs and allowed them to depose some of its highest-ranking officials.\n\nThe District answered “25 Interrogatories, 21 Requests for Admission, and 20 Requests for\n\nProduction of Documents,” which yielded “almost 20,000 pages of documents, including the\n\nChancellor’s hand-written notes from meetings.” Mot. at 3. Plaintiffs questioned “DCPS Chief\n\nFinancial Officer Deloras Shepherd . . .; DCPS Chief of Strategy Peter Weber; DCPS Chief of\n\nStaff Lisa Ruda; and DCPS Chancellor Kaya Henderson.” Id. Despite all that, Plaintiffs came\n\nup empty handed. Nothing in the record points to discrimination based on race or residence.\n\nEverything, instead, points to a neutral determination undertaken for the legitimate purpose of\n\nincreasing efficiency and improving education for all students. As a result, no reasonable jury\n\ncould find for Plaintiffs under the DCHRA.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, the Court will GRANT Defendants’ Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day.\n\n                                                     /s/ James E.

Civil Action No. 13-420 (JEB)\nKAYA HENDERSON, Chancellor of the\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools, et al.,\n\n       Defendants.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        A perusal of any newspaper reveals an indisputable truth: People hold strong and\n\ndivergent views regarding the future of public education. Today’s headlines capture rampant\n\ndebates about everything from teachers’ unions to charter schools to the new “Common Core”\n\nState Standards. Conversations about these issues are playing out in legislatures and local\n\ngovernments throughout the country. This fall in the District of Columbia, in fact, voters will\n\nconsider many of these same questions when they head to the polls to elect their city’s leaders,\n\nparticularly since the new mayor will appoint the next D.C. Public Schools Chancellor.\n\n       Plaintiffs in this case – like most parents – care deeply about their children’s education.\n\nTheir sons, daughters, and grandchildren are unhappy about the recent closure of their\n\nneighborhood schools. And Plaintiffs and their children understandably want their old schools\n\nand familiar teachers back. Seeking some avenue by which they might reopen their\n\nneighborhood institutions, these parents and guardians turned to the courts. They sued the\n\nDistrict and its officials, alleging that the closings were discriminatory; that they had a disparate\n\nimpact on poor and minority children; and that reforms like charter schools and performance pay\n\n\n                                                  1\n\ffor teachers will ultimately harm black students in the District. Linking the closures to D.C.’s\n\ntroubled history of segregated and underperforming schools, these parents cry foul. They want\n\nthe reforms to end.\n\n       The core problem here is that the parents’ fight is one for the ballot box – not the courts.\n\nAlthough Plaintiffs dislike charter schools, performance pay, and the increasing number of D.C.\n\nschool closures, there is simply no real evidence that these policies are discriminatory. As a\n\nresult, federal courts have no authority to intervene in these sensitive policy choices, and judges\n\nshould not be the ones to render the final verdict on charter schools, school turnarounds, and\n\nteacher evaluations. Instead, those decisions must be made by the policymakers and experts who\n\nhave, for better or worse, always controlled public education. The Court, consequently, will\n\ngrant the District’s Motion for Summary Judgment and dismiss this case.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Plaintiffs’ case has a history before this Court. Prior to the instant Motion, the Court\n\nevaluated their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, see Smith v. Henderson (Smith I), 944 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 89 (D.D.C. 2013), and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. See Smith v. Henderson (Smith\n\nII), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2013). Although those Opinions outline some of the basic facts\n\nof this case, Plaintiffs’ evidence has evolved over the course of discovery, and the standard for\n\nsummary judgment, of course, is different. The Court, therefore, revisits the relevant details of\n\nthe school closures.\n\n       A. D.C. Schools and Desegregation\n\n       Plaintiffs’ tale begins at the very beginning: with the city’s earliest school-desegregation\n\nefforts. As a result, the Court will (briefly) survey the history of desegregation, race, and D.C.\n\nPublic Schools.\n\n                                                 2\n\f        Until the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Bolling v. Sharpe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954),\n\nD.C. schools were segregated by law. After Bolling, school desegregation proceeded “slowly\n\nbut steadily” throughout the 1950’s. See Judith Denton Jones, Six School Complex: A\n\nSuccessful Innovation in Washington, D.C.’s Public Schools (1987) (cited frequently by\n\nPlaintiffs).\n\n        In 1967, a D.C. District Court handed down a broad mandate to hasten desegregation in\n\nHobson v. Hansen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1800940\"><a href=\"/opinion/1800940/hobson-v-hansen/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 1967). There, the court found that – even after\n\nBolling – per-pupil expenditures in D.C. were significantly lower for black students; that there\n\nwas a sizable achievement gap between black and white students; and that black students were\n\ndisproportionately “tracked” into low-level classes. Id. at 406. As a result, the court ordered the\n\nschool system to end tracking and to begin busing students from black neighborhoods to white\n\nschools. Id. at 517.\n\n        At the time Hobson was issued, the District had already experienced a wave of white\n\nflight to the suburbs. Id. at 410. By 1967, most white families that remained lived west of Rock\n\nCreek Park in the northwestern quadrant of the city. Id. Their children were concentrated in a\n\nbundle of schools in that same region. Id. at 411-12. The attrition of D.C.’s white population\n\ncontinued over the 1960’s, leading to the closure of many schools in white neighborhoods. See\n\nJones, supra, at 18 (“many white families took their children out of public schools in response to\n\ndesegregation”); id. at 21 (“Schools were being closed all over the city; several in Georgetown\n\nhad already been closed . . . .”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that, during the aftermath of white flight, underpopulated white schools\n\nwere treated more charitably than low-enrollment black schools have been today. In the early\n\n1970’s, schools in Ward 3, which is west of the Park, had largely been depopulated. Id. at 21-22.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fThe city’s solution of busing students in from Anacostia, which is east of the Park, was about to\n\ncome to an end. Id. at 24. Several schools in the area had closed or were about to close. Id. at\n\n21 (schools closing in Georgetown); id. at 26-27 (Western High School phased out, Gordon\n\nJunior High School closed). Parents at six small elementary schools, fearing closure, banded\n\ntogether in an attempt to keep their schools open. In the end, they came up with a plan that\n\ninvolved the closing of two schools and their conversion into a middle school and a resource\n\ncenter, respectively. Id. at 37-38. Four of the original six schools were able to remain open. Id.\n\n       With the end of massive busing programs, however, city schools largely resegregated.\n\nPartially, this is because few white children enroll in D.C. public schools. Today, according to\n\nPlaintiffs’ expert, only about 11% of DCPS students are white. See Opp., Exh. B (Updated\n\nAffidavit of Mary Levy), ¶ 13. The vast majority are students of color – especially east of the\n\nPark. See Parents United for the D.C. Public Schools, Separate and Unequal: The State of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools Fifty Years After Brown and Bolling 8 (2005), available at\n\nhttp://goo.gl/o1XO08.\n\n       To this day, D.C. also suffers from a yawning achievement gap. In 2011, for example,\n\n“D.C. public schools ha[d] the largest achievement gap between black and white students among\n\nthe nation’s major urban school systems.” Lyndsey Layton, D.C. Schools Have Largest Black-\n\nWhite Achievement Gap in Federal Study, Wash. Post, Dec. 7, 2011, available at\n\nhttp://goo.gl/U6Byan.\n\n       B. School Reform\n\n       In 2007, then-Mayor Adrian Fenty brought in Michelle Rhee to lead DCPS, promising to\n\nturn around the school system. See Harry Jaffe, Can Michelle Rhee Save DC Schools?,\n\nWashingtonian, Sept. 2007, available at http://goo.gl/wIIxzk. While schools had previously been\n\n                                                4\n\frun by an elected school board, Rhee was DCPS’s first Chancellor, appointed by the Mayor to\n\ntake the helm of D.C. public education. Id.; D.C. Code § 38-174(a). In her time at DCPS, Rhee\n\nengineered a teacher-evaluation system that focused on student achievement and arranged for\n\ncommensurate performance bonuses for teachers. See Stephanie Simon, Radical Washington\n\nD.C. Teacher-Evaluation Plan Worked, Study Says, Politico, Oct. 17, 2013, available at\n\nhttp://goo.gl/Mn9Tup. She also closed 23 under-enrolled neighborhood schools as the\n\nproportion of students in charter schools – which are publicly funded but privately run schools of\n\nchoice – rose to about 40%. See Sarah Childress, After Michelle Rhee: What Happened Next in\n\nD.C.’s Schools, Frontline, Jan. 8, 2013, available at http://goo.gl/HCPeSL. Rhee’s tenure in\n\nD.C. was undoubtedly controversial. When she left office after Fenty’s defeat at the polls, she\n\nwas considered a scourge of D.C. public education by some and a hero by many others. See id.\n\nThe current Chancellor, Kaya Henderson, was Rhee’s deputy and has continued many of her\n\npolicies, much to Plaintiffs’ chagrin. See id. This includes the use of rigorous teacher\n\nevaluations and performance bonuses, as well as a cooperative attitude toward charter schools.\n\n       C. Current School Closings\n\n       Partially as a result of changing demographics and partially due to the rise of charter\n\nschools, Chancellor Henderson inherited several schools that were under-enrolled. She also\n\nknew that several schools lacked the academic programming that she believed all D.C. students\n\nshould receive. For instance, Henderson hoped all elementary schools could offer students 45\n\nminutes per week of art, music, physical education, library, and a foreign language, but not all\n\nschools provided those offerings. Mot., Exh. B (Deposition of Kaya Henderson) at 134:16-\n\n135:5. The funding simply was not there.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       Henderson thus sought advice from consulting companies and from her staff on how to\n\nuse District resources more efficiently. When the consultants recommended closing schools, the\n\nChancellor convened a working group to determine which, if any, to close. That group\n\nconsidered several criteria, including “student enrollment” in each school, “building capacity,”\n\n“whether the facility itself has been recently renovated or modernized,” and “programming” at\n\nschools “in that area.” Mot., Exh. D (Deposition of Lisa Ruda) at 22:12-23:12.\n\n       In the end, Henderson proposed closing twenty DCPS buildings over the course of the\n\n2013-14 and 2014-15 school years. See ECF No. 18-2 (Office of Chancellor, DCPS, DCPS\n\nProposed Consolidations and Reorganization: Better Schools for All Students (“Proposed\n\nConsolidation Plan”) (Nov. 15, 2012)) at 16. The majority of the schools slated to be closed\n\noperated at half capacity, and five schools were under 25% full. See id. at 17-22. DCPS\n\nexplained that closing these under-enrolled schools would allow it to spend less money per pupil\n\non overhead, while putting more students in modern facilities and giving them access to\n\nprograms and staff that can be justified only for large schools. See id. at 11-14.\n\n       All of the schools to be closed sat in majority-minority, lower-income neighborhoods east\n\nof Rock Creek Park, in Wards 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. See id. at 16. Some of those schools had been\n\ndrained of their students by the increasing popularity of charter schools. For example, around\n\n50% of children attend charter schools in Wards 1, 5, and 7, and about 40% attend charters in\n\nWards 4, 6, and 8. Id. at 8. Henderson’s proposal suggested no school closings in Ward 3,\n\nwhich is more white, more affluent, and west of the Park, or in Ward 1, which also contains\n\nseveral whiter, wealthier neighborhoods. See id. at 23. The District claimed that this was\n\nbecause facilities were being used efficiently in those Wards, with the building-utilization rate at\n\n74% in Ward 1 and 109% in Ward 3. Id. at 23.\n\n                                                 6\n\f       To gather feedback on its proposal, DCPS (i) convened community meetings throughout\n\nthe city regarding the proposal, drawing 780 participants; (ii) called and held office hours with\n\nAdvisory Neighborhood Commissioners; and (iii) launched an online forum for those who could\n\nnot make the meetings. See id. at 27-28; Office of Chancellor, DCPS, Better Schools for All\n\nStudents: DCPS’ Consolidation and Reorganization Plan (“Final Consolidation Plan”) 2-3 (Jan.\n\n2013), available at http://goo.gl/XA8VSy. The City Council also held two hearings on the\n\nclosures. See Final Consolidation Plan at 2-3.\n\n       In the end, DCPS made various changes to its initial plan based on community feedback,\n\nincluding keeping open five schools originally proposed for closure. See id. at 4-5. Plaintiffs\n\nclaim in their brief that the five schools DCPS preserved contained more white students than the\n\nschools that were closed, although they provide no citation to support that proposition. See Opp.\n\nat 29 (DCPS “intentionally removed from the initial closure list the only two schools with\n\nsignificant numbers of white students.”); id. at 9 n.8 (providing statistics but no source).\n\n       DCPS estimated that savings from the revised proposal would total $8.5 million and\n\nanticipated that those funds would be re-invested in schools throughout the city. See Final\n\nConsolidation Plan at 6. Plaintiffs argue that similar benefits projected from Rhee’s closures in\n\n2008 never materialized and that the projected benefits from this proposal would thus likely turn\n\nout to be overblown. See Opp., Exh. F (Office of the D.C. Auditor, Audit of the Closure and\n\nConsolidation of 23 D.C. Public Schools (Sept. 6, 2012)) at 4. Nevertheless, Chancellor\n\nHenderson confirms that cost savings from the closures did indeed materialize and that the extra\n\nfunding has been used to “ensur[e] a consistent level of . . . programmatic offers at all our\n\nelementary schools,” so that each school now has a librarian as well as art, music, gym, and\n\nforeign languages. Henderson Depo. at 134:16-135:5.\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\f       DCPS also published proposals for how the empty school buildings might be used. The\n\nDistrict estimated that most schools would be retained in DCPS inventory, but suggested that\n\nsome might be used by charter schools. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 26. Plaintiffs thus\n\nclaim that the closings were undertaken to open up space for charter schools, rather than for the\n\nbenefit of DCPS students. See, e.g., Opp. at 4.\n\n       All fifteen schools on the final closure list lie east of the Park, meaning the students are\n\ndisproportionately black and Latino. In DCPS schools as a whole, according to Plaintiffs’\n\nexpert, 69% of students are black; 16% are Hispanic; 4% are Asian, other, or unknown; and 11%\n\nare white. See Levy Aff., ¶ 13. In the closed schools, by contrast, 93% of students were black;\n\n6.6% were Hispanic; and fewer than 0.2% (six students) were white. Id.\n\n       Plaintiffs claim that this disparity is intentional, either because it is stark enough to be\n\ninexplicable on grounds other than race, or because it was motivated by discriminatory animus.\n\n       D. Procedural Background\n\n       Five Plaintiffs originally filed this suit against Chancellor Henderson, Mayor Vincent\n\nGray, and the District of Columbia as Defendants. The case was removed from Superior Court\n\nin April 2013, and Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction was denied in May of that\n\nyear. See Smith I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Two of the original Plaintiffs – Karlene Armstead and\n\nEricka Black – and two Plaintiffs who were later added to the Complaint – Keith Kone and\n\nPhomika “Pho” Palmer – were ANC Commissioners. The other three original Plaintiffs –\n\nShannon Smith, Marlece Turner, and Brenda Williams – are parents or guardians of children\n\nwho attended closed schools. See id. at 95. All of the guardians’ children are black or Hispanic\n\nand live east of the Park. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       In their original Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that the District violated D.C. statutes\n\nrequiring notice to ANC Commissioners of the school closures, the D.C. Sunshine Amendment,\n\nthe Constitution’s equal-protection guarantee (asserted under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct, the Rehabilitation Act, and the D.C. Human Rights Act. See id. In their Amended\n\nComplaint, Plaintiffs added two additional state-law claims. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 103-09.\n\n       The Court ruled on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in October 2013, ultimately\n\ndismissing the ANC Commissioners as Plaintiffs and the lion’s share of Plaintiffs’ claims.

What remains are Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection, Title VI, and\n\nDCHRA claims alleging discrimination.

Cir. 1987).\n\n       B. Motion to Strike\n\n        Although courts typically view evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\nparty, Defendants here argue that some of Plaintiffs’ evidence should not be considered at all.\n\nThat is because the evidence was not disclosed during discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c).\n\nBroadly speaking, this evidence falls into three categories: (i) affidavits from experts and other\n\nwitnesses whose identities were not disclosed; (ii) publicly available reports from policy groups;\n\nand (iii) some updated affidavits from Plaintiffs’ witness Mary Levy.\n\n       According to the Federal Rules, “If a party fails to provide information or identify a\n\nwitness as required by [the Rules], the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to\n\n                                                 10\n\fsupply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially\n\njustified or is harmless.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Local rules echo that requirement. See\n\nLCvR 26.2(a) (“A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information . . . or\n\nto amend a prior response to discovery . . . , is not, unless such failure is harmless, permitted to\n\nuse as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information not so\n\ndisclosed.”). Here, Plaintiffs appear to admit that they did not timely identify several witnesses\n\nand that they never furnished the District with the relevant reports. See Opp. to Mot. to Strike\n\nat 13.\n\n         For the Court to consider the evidence at issue, then, Plaintiffs must show that the failure\n\n“was substantially justified” or “harmless.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Generally, “[t]he harm\n\nfrom the failure to disclose a witness flows from the unfair surprise hindering the prejudiced\n\nparty’s ability to examine and contest that witness’ evidence.” Elion v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1687139\"><a href=\"/opinion/1687139/elion-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2008). “If the court” accepts “eleventh-hour declarations,” then the District\n\n“would effectively be deprived of the opportunity to depose [Plaintiffs’] new witnesses.”\n\nUnited States ex rel. Purcell v. MWI Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2113645\"><a href=\"/opinion/2113645/us-ex-rel-purcell-v-mwi-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (D.D.C. 2011). The District\n\nwould also have to unexpectedly gather rebuttal evidence at a moment’s notice, which could\n\ncause substantial harm to its case. Id.\n\n         Considering first the affidavits supplied by “surprise” witnesses and experts, the Court\n\nfinds that their late disclosure was neither “substantially justified” nor “harmless.” Plaintiffs\n\nclaim that their slew of additional experts is justified because they just now “learned that\n\nDefendants’ ‘only’” purported “purpose[] for closing the schools w[as] ‘improving DCPS\n\nresource allocation and . . . educational experiences for DCPS students.” Opp. to Mot. to Strike\n\nat 10. Put plainly, this statement is absurd. Improving efficiency and programming has always\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f been the District’s stated reason for closing schools. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 5-15.\n\n Plaintiffs’ new expert testimony, moreover, is not “harmless,” since Plaintiffs have robbed the\n\n District of the opportunity to depose or otherwise rebut the new evidence prior to summary\n\n judgment. To be sure, DCPS would not be severely prejudiced if the affidavits were admitted,\n\n since the Court would reach the same decision even if it considered the experts’ arguments. But\n\n in the interest of fairness, the Court will exclude those affidavits, except for one that was\n\n proffered earlier in this litigation. See Opp., Exhs. C, W, X; but see Opp., Exh. S (same\n\n affidavit submitted to Court in ECF No. 8-19).\n\n       Moving to the next two categories of materials, the Court finds that these yield a different\n\n result. The reports to which Defendants object are publicly available and hence could easily be\n\n the subject of judicial notice. See Kaempe v. Myers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186196\"><a href=\"/opinion/186196/kaempe-staffan-v-myers-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 965 (D.C. Cir. 2004)\n\n (public documents subject to notice); Opp., Exhs. E, G, H, K, T, U (public reports); but see\n\n Opp., Exh. V (not obviously publicly available and hence excluded). Considering them would,\n\n therefore, be harmless. Similarly, regarding the updated Levy affidavits, DCPS already knew\n\n that she would be testifying at trial and had the chance to depose her. The new information\n\n contained in those affidavits appears largely to incorporate updated statistics that the District\n\n itself only recently made available. See Opp., Exhs. B, R. The integration of this information\n\n into updated or additional affidavits is therefore both justified and harmless.\n\n       Having resolved that question, the Court proceeds to the merits.\n\nIII.   Analysis\n\n       To support what remains of their case of discrimination, the parents advance a number of\n\n theories. First, they claim that under-enrolled schools in white neighborhoods have never been\n\n closed – or, at least, that the District made a greater effort to save those schools back in the\n\n                                                  12\n\f1970’s. Next, they maintain that the reasons given for the closures are a façade. Instead of\n\nwanting to improve the resources allocated to all DCPS schools, as Henderson and her staff\n\nclaimed, Plaintiffs contend that schools were closed to meet two objectives: to fund teacher\n\nbonuses – which disproportionately go to whiter schools – and to make room for more charters.\n\nBoth of these initiatives, the parents assert, are discriminatory and impermissible.\n\n       In analyzing Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court begins by considering its authority to resolve\n\ncertain policy disputes raised by the parents and then proceeds to separate analyses of Plaintiffs’\n\nfederal and local causes of action.\n\n       A. Policy Questions\n\n       As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that many of Plaintiffs’ arguments cannot be\n\nproperly addressed or resolved by a federal judge. That is because the contentions are political\n\nrather than legal. For example, portions of the briefing boil down to the following syllogism:\n\n(1) Charter schools and performance pay for teachers are bad policies that Plaintiffs dislike; (2)\n\nThe District “illigetimate[ly]” closed neighborhood schools to support charter schools and\n\nperformance pay; (3) Therefore, the closures should not be allowed. Opp. at 40. Taking another\n\ntack, Plaintiffs also contend that school closures are generally bad for kids and do not really save\n\nmoney; therefore, they say, the Court should re-open the closed schools.\n\n       As a matter of policy, there is sharp disagreement on those issues. Some studies tend to\n\nshow that charter schools, if well managed, can be incredibly successful, and many major urban\n\ndistricts have embraced this reform. See, e.g., The Boston Foundation, Informing the Debate:\n\nComparing Boston’s Charter, Pilot and Traditional Schools 9 (Jan. 2009) (Boston charter schools\n\nproduce positive results); CREDO, National Charter School Study 36-37 (2013) (charter schools\n\nhave positive impact for children living in poverty); Christina Clark Tuttle, et al., Student\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fCharacteristics and Achievement in 22 KIPP Middle Schools at xi (2010) (KIPP schools had\n\nsignificant, positive impact on student achievement). Other studies cast doubt on the efficacy of\n\ncharters. See Diane Ravitch, The Myth of Charter Schools, N.Y. Rev. of Books, Nov. 11, 2010,\n\navailable at http://goo.gl/lDYktL (among charter schools “17 percent were superior to a matched\n\ntraditional public school; 37 percent were worse than the public school; and the remaining 46\n\npercent had academic gains no different from that of a similar public school”). The same is true\n\nof performance pay correlated to student achievement. Compare Victor Lavy, Performance Pay\n\nand Teachers’ Effort, Productivity, and Grading Ethics, Am. Econ. Rev. 3-4, Dec. 2009,\n\n(performance pay works), with Steven Glazerman & Allison Seifullah, An Evaluation of the\n\nChicago Teacher Advancement Program (Chicago TAP) After Four Years xiv (Mar. 2012)\n\n(bonuses do not necessarily impact achievement). School closures, too, receive mixed reviews.\n\nThey have been embraced, for example, by the federal Department of Education as one of four\n\n“turnaround” models for failing schools. See School Improvement Grants, 75 Fed. Reg. 66,363,\n\n66,366 (Oct. 28, 2010). They have also been panned by certain critics. See Opp., Exh. U\n\n(CReATE, Research Brief on School Closures (Mar. 2013)) at 1 (school closures cause lower\n\ntest scores and higher dropout rates).\n\n       For any policymaker, whether to embrace these reforms is a difficult question that\n\nrequires expert judgment. For courts, it is simply an impossible – indeed, an impermissible –\n\nquestion to answer. “[C]ontroversies which revolve around policy choices and value\n\ndeterminations,” are, after all, generally “committed” to the people’s representatives “for\n\nresolution.” Japan Whaling Ass’n v.

Cir. 1981)).\n\n         Whether charter schools, performance pay, and school turnarounds are worthwhile policy\n\ntools is a question for school superintendents and state legislatures. There is no governable legal\n\nstandard for assessing the promise of those reforms. Careers in the education sector will likely\n\nbe launched and shattered on the success or failure of those movements. It is not for courts to\n\nsay whether, in the faraway future, researchers will finally concur on whether these initiatives\n\nsucceeded or failed. Instead, the only question for the Court to address is whether these reforms\n\nare illegal – in other words, are they inherently discriminatory or discriminatory as applied to\n\nPlaintiffs’ children? Answering that question, as it turns out, is a tough hill for Plaintiffs to\n\nclimb.\n\n         B. Equal Protection and Title VI\n\n         Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that the District’s school\n\nclosures discriminated against their children on the basis of disability, residence, and race in\n\nviolation of the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment. See Am. Compl., ¶ 95;\n\nBolling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Plaintiffs’ briefing, however, advances only claims of racial\n\ndiscrimination, so the Court will treat the disability and residence arguments as conceded.\n\nPlaintiffs also brought suit under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects against\n\ndiscrimination based on race, color, and national origin in District schools. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000d (“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin,\n\nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination\n\nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f       Both Equal Protection and Title VI claims require a showing of intentional\n\ndiscrimination.

After all, discriminatory intent\n\n“implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.

First, they assert that, since the 1970’s, the District’s school-closure policy has\n\nbeen applied differently to white schools, which have been kept open, than to black schools,\n\n                                                  16\n\fwhich have been closed when under-enrolled. Second, they contend that the school closures\n\nwere intended to fund performance bonuses for teachers in disproportionately white schools, and\n\nhence the closings themselves were discriminatory. Third, they posit that the closings were\n\nundertaken to create more room for charter schools, which they also view as discriminatory. The\n\nCourt addresses each theory in turn.\n\n                       1. Discriminatory Application of Closures\n\n       Plaintiffs first argue that the District has applied its school-closure policy in a\n\ndiscriminatory manner. That is, even if DCPS does have a policy of closing under-enrolled\n\nschools, that policy is only actually applied to black schools. Black students, as a result, are\n\nintentionally made to suffer as white students escape unscathed. According to Plaintiffs, “DCPS\n\nhas historically protected schools west of the Park,” which are disproportionately white. Opp. at\n\n8. The parents claim that “no Ward 3 school was closed” in the 1970’s, even when schools were\n\nseverely under-enrolled. Id. By contrast, Chancellor Rhee recently closed 23 schools east of the\n\nPark, and Chancellor Henderson has now closed 15 additional schools in those same\n\nneighborhoods. Clearly, Plaintiffs state, this shows a consistent pattern of discrimination from\n\nthe 1970’s to today.\n\n       The problems with this argument are manifold. To begin with, comparing District\n\ngovernance in the 1970’s with the state of DCPS today is not a terribly productive exercise.\n\nKaya Henderson – the relevant decisionmaker in this case – was so young in the early 1970’s\n\nthat she was not yet eligible to attend public school, let alone run a district. More importantly, at\n\nthat time, DCPS was overseen by an elected school board and did not even have a Chancellor,\n\nwho is appointed by the Mayor. Cf., e.g., Shelby County v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"931614\"><a href=\"/opinion/931614/shelby-county-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(observing the difference between\n\npolicies in place during desegregation and today’s thorny policy problems of de facto\n\nsegregation). Plaintiffs, moreover, present no evidence of any actual policy – formal or informal\n\n– that began in the 1970’s and somehow survived to this day. Today’s school-closure criteria\n\nmay well differ from whatever rubric was applied in the 1970’s. On this record, no reasonable\n\njury could find any useful connection between the events of the 1970’s and today’s school\n\nclosings.\n\n       Even if the 1970’s closures could meaningfully be linked those closures in 2013, the\n\nDistrict’s actions cannot be construed as intentionally discriminatory. To make out an Equal\n\nProtection case, Plaintiffs need to show “a clear pattern” of discrimination, “unexplainable on\n\ngrounds other than race.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266. This they cannot do. Comparison\n\nto the relevant Supreme Court opinions outlining intentionally discriminatory treatment\n\nillustrates the point. In Yick Wo, “uncontradicted” evidence “show[ed] that all Chinese\n\napplications” to lawfully run urban laundromats were “in fact, denied, and those of Caucasians”\n\n– who operated exactly the same sort of laundries – were “granted.” 118 U.S. at 361. Thus,\n\nwhites were free to pursue their livelihood unmolested, while Asians in the same profession were\n\narrested and harassed. In Gomillion, a city’s boundaries were redrawn “to remove from the city\n\nall save only four or five of its 400 Negro voters while not removing a single white voter or\n\nresident.” 364 U.S. at 341. The inference of discrimination thus was inescapable.\n\n       In the District, by contrast, it appears that significant numbers of both white and black\n\nschools have been closed when their facilities were under-utilized. Although Plaintiffs claim that\n\n“no Ward 3 school was closed” in the 1970’s, their own historical sources flatly contradict this\n\n                                                18\n\faccount. Ward 3 parents banded together in the 1970’s, after all, precisely because “‘[s]chools\n\nwere being closed all over the city’” – including in Ward 3 – “‘and several in Georgetown had\n\nalready been closed.’” Jones, supra, at 21. And of the six schools with which white parents\n\nwere most concerned, two were actually shuttered. Id. at 37-38. The historic treatment of white\n\nschools and the current treatment of black schools, in other words, is not so different.\n\n        No one is denying that the racial disparities in the recent closings are striking. In the\n\nclosed schools, after all, a startling 93% of students were black and fewer than 0.2% (six\n\nstudents) were white. See Levy Aff., ¶ 13. But here, the disparity appears to be caused by the\n\nlocation of the under-enrolled schools, not by intentional discrimination. In the 1970’s, there\n\nwere many under-enrolled schools west of the Park, in whiter neighborhoods; now, they lie to\n\nthe east. There is no evidence that schools west of the Park would be treated differently if they\n\nonce again became under-enrolled. While it is indeed regrettable that our city schools have\n\nbecome so segregated, it is residential segregation, along with changing population patterns, that\n\nis largely to blame for the disparities in the closures.\n\n        Similarly, in Yick Wo and Gomillion “no reason for” the disparate treatment “was\n\nshown, and the conclusion” could not “be resisted, that no reason for it exist[ed] except hostility\n\nto” race. Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 374. Here, by contrast, the record is replete with compelling,\n\nrace-neutral reasons for the District’s actions. As DCPS noted when it announced the closures,\n\n“Too many of our schools are under-enrolled. As a result, we spend too much on maintaining\n\nsmall schools rather than investing in quality programs for students.” Final Consolidation Plan\n\nat 1. A majority of the schools slated for closure were between 9% and 55% full. See Proposed\n\nConsolidation Plan at 17-22. In determining which schools to close, the District looked at four\n\nfactors: “1. Student enrollment and population changes in the community; 2. Building utilization\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\frates; 3. The building condition and its modernization status; and 4. The availability of ‘receiving\n\nschools’ to offer students an improved experience.” Final Consolidation Plan at 1. None of\n\nthose factors deals with race, and each makes sense in the context of increasing efficiency and\n\nproviding all DCPS students with an improved educational experience. Plaintiffs, moreover,\n\noffer no evidence that the schools slated for closure failed to meet these criteria, or that any Ward\n\n3 school would have fit the bill better. In fact, overall, Ward 3 schools – which are\n\ndisproportionately white – are now over-enrolled. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 23.\n\nViewing the closure criteria as a pretext for discrimination is therefore implausible as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n       On top of that, now that the schools have closed, the District has indeed used the money\n\nsaved to meet at least one of its stated goals: ensuring that “[a]ll schools can offer robust\n\nprogramming.” Final Consolidation Plan at 1. Although Plaintiffs feared that these closings –\n\nlike the last round of closures – would save no money at all, that does not appear to be the case.\n\nAccording to Henderson, some of the savings have been used to guarantee “that every\n\nelementary school is offering the four core subject areas, social studies, science, math and\n\nEnglish language arts, and at least 45 minutes a week of art, music, P.E., library, and foreign\n\nlanguage instruction.” Henderson Depo. at 134:19-135:5. No reasonable jury would view those\n\nchanges as a threadbare façade for racial discrimination.\n\n       In its last Opinion, the Court wondered if Plaintiffs’ theory of differential treatment\n\nwould prove “too slender a reed on which to hang” its case. See Smith II, 982 F. Supp. 2d at 50.\n\nGiven the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence produced by the District showing that its\n\ndecision was race neutral, the thin reed supporting Plaintiffs’ case has indeed snapped. On the\n\ncurrent record, no reasonable jury could infer intentional discrimination in the school closures.\n\n                                                 20\n\f                          2. Performance Pay and Other Resources\n\n        Perhaps sensing the weakness of their argument-in-chief, Plaintiffs rally around another\n\ntheory in their most recent filings. They now claim that the schools were closed to help fund\n\nperformance bonuses for highly effective teachers. Because those bonuses are disproportionately\n\nawarded to teachers at white schools, Plaintiffs contend that the closings were discriminatory.\n\nSee Opp., Exh. R (Second Affidavit of Mary Levy), ¶ 21. This is a convoluted argument, to say\n\nthe least.\n\n        To begin with, the proposition that schools were closed to fund teacher bonuses is not\n\nsupported by any evidence properly on the record. 1 Even if the Court were to look to the one\n\n(now-stricken) affidavit touching on this theory, it alleges only that closures were discussed in\n\n2009-10 as one possible method for funding performance incentives. See Opp., Exh. W\n\n(Affidavit of Marni Barron), ¶ 12. The witness does not and cannot say that, several years later\n\nand with an entirely different Chancellor, the District actually closed schools for this purpose.\n\n        In any event, even if schools were closed to fund teacher bonuses, Plaintiffs would still\n\nnot prevail. Despite the fact that performance bonuses are disproportionately awarded to\n\nteachers at white schools, Plaintiffs have not shown that this is a result of intentional\n\ndiscrimination. By all accounts, these bonuses are awarded to teachers based on race-neutral\n\nperformance metrics. See, e.g., DCPS, IMPACTplus for Teachers 1-5, available at\n\nhttp://goo.gl/pqiyZf. This is not to say that the District should be proud of the fact that its best\n\nteachers work mostly in whiter, more affluent schools. Still, Plaintiffs’ argument relies entirely\n\non disparate impact, which is not enough to make out an Equal Protection claim. See Arlington\n\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 264-65. Indeed, this claim piggybacks disparate impact – in terms of\n\n\n        1\n          Plaintiffs cite, by Bates-stamp, one e-mail on the subject sent by DCPS employee Peter Weber. But that\ne-mail was not submitted as an exhibit to their Opposition, and the Court cannot locate it.\n\n                                                       21\n\fperformance pay – on top of disparate impact – in terms of the school closures. No reasonable\n\njury could find intentional discrimination based on that attenuated logic.\n\n       Along the same lines, Plaintiffs contend that other resources – like traditionally certified\n\nteachers and upgraded facilities – are also disproportionately concentrated west of the Park. See,\n\ne.g., Opp., Exh. T (Dep’t of Educ., Data Snapshot: Teacher Equity (Mar. 2014)) at 12; Exh. G\n\n(21st Century School Fund, DCPS Overall Spending on New and Completely Modernized\n\nSchools (Jan. 2011)) at 1-2. This, they say, has driven students out of schools east of the Park,\n\nresulting in school closures. Again, this is a disparate-impact argument. Plaintiffs present no\n\nlink between decisions to spend money renovating schools and racial animus – as opposed to\n\nbasing those determinations on, say, the age of the facilities. Similarly, alternative-certification\n\nteachers, like Teach For America corps members, may be disproportionately drawn to low-\n\nincome schools east of the Park, pursuant to TFA’s mission to close the achievement gap.\n\nFinally, the lawsuit challenges the closings as discriminatory, not the conditions that led to the\n\nclosings. In sum, as Plaintiffs proffer no link to intentional discrimination, their claims cannot\n\nproceed.\n\n                       3. Charter Schools\n\n       Plaintiffs next claim that their neighborhood schools were closed to make room for\n\ncharters. They offer no explanation as to why the expansion of charter schools is discriminatory,\n\nexcept to say that it seems sinister that there are no charters in the whiter, more affluent Ward 3.\n\nSee Opp. at 11. To be sure, the population of charter schools in D.C. is disproportionately black.\n\nSee D.C. Public Charter School Board, Facts About D.C. PCSB and Charter Schools 2 (Oct.\n\n2013), available at http://tinyurl.com/onwvjtc. But students who attend charters choose to go to\n\ncharters. And they do so because, on average, charters are higher performing than DCPS\n\n                                                 22\n\fschools. Id. at 3-4. To argue that helping charters – which are, in D.C., higher-achieving schools\n\nof choice – is somehow nefarious and discriminatory beggars belief. That is not to say that most\n\nparents, given the choice, would not pick a high-performing school next door over a high-\n\nperforming charter halfway across the city. It is simply to acknowledge that the District cannot\n\nbe discriminating by attempting to provide all children with access to higher-achieving schools.\n\nOn top of that, Plaintiffs offer no real evidence that their schools were actually closed to make\n\nway for charters – other than, somewhat ironically, complaints from charter schools that the\n\nDistrict was not providing them with enough space. See Opp., Exh. O (E-mail from De’Shawn\n\nWright, D.C. Mayor’s Office, to Terry Golden, Bailey Capital (July 11, 2012)). Based on this\n\nevidence, no reasonable jury could find an Equal Protection or Title VI violation here.\n\n                       4. Other Arguments\n\n       Plaintiffs offer a smattering of other arguments, including a stray remark by former\n\nChancellor Rhee and a host of contentions about how school closures harm rather than help\n\nstudents. The stray remark, as Defendants point out, is double hearsay: a report in a city paper\n\nabout an “anonymous” government official who allegedly heard Rhee offer to make more seats\n\navailable for white students. See Opp. at 12. As such, it is inadmissible. See Fed. R. Evid. 802.\n\nIn terms of the impact of school closures, no one doubts that having their neighborhood school\n\nshuttered and their favorite teachers dispersed can be traumatic for students. The parents and\n\ngrandparents here have outlined in detail the negative impact that the closures have had on their\n\nkids. See, e.g., Opp., Exh. I (Affidavit of Marlece Turner); Exh. J (Affidavit of Shannon Marie\n\nSmith). Sensitive to this plight, the Court would simply note that overhauling a school system –\n\nand D.C.’s has traditionally been one of the worst in the country – involves hard choices. The\n\nChancellor has judged that some short-term discomfort for students in the closed schools is\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fnecessary to provide a better education for D.C. children overall. That decision is hers to make,\n\nas long as it is not based on race. The Court must yield to the District’s non-discriminatory\n\npolicy choices.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs dredge up a litany of precedents addressing the immediate aftermath of\n\nde jure segregation, suggesting that the Court treat D.C. schools today like the Supreme Court\n\ntreated districts in the wake of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954).\n\nSee, e.g., Griffin v.

No one doubts that the pre-\n\nBolling period of forced segregation has left long-lasting scars on the city and its schools. But\n\nwhat policymakers are grappling with here is the current state of de facto segregation in the city.\n\nAs a result, different standards apply. See Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs., 551 U.S. at 735-36\n\n(explaining the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation); Spurlock v. Fox, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">383</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386 (6th Cir. 2013) (same). In addition, as the Court noted in its prior Opinion, it highly\n\ndoubts that Brown and its progeny could properly be stretched to prevent the closure of highly\n\nsegregated, largely deserted, under-performing schools and to keep minority children from being\n\ntransferred to higher-performing, less segregated schools nearby. See Smith I, 944 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n102-03. As a result, the appeal to Brown-era cases cannot save Plaintiffs’ cause.\n\n       C. D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n       The D.C. Human Rights Act, like Title VI and Equal Protection, guards against racial\n\ndiscrimination. It also prohibits discrimination based on residence, among other things. The\n\nDCHRA states in part: “Except as otherwise provided for by District law or when otherwise\n\nlawfully and reasonably permitted, it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for a District\n\ngovernment agency or office to limit or refuse to provide any facility, service, program, or\n\n                                                24\n\fbenefit to any individual on the basis of an individual’s actual or perceived: race, . . .\n\ndisability, . . . or place of residence . . . .” D.C. Code § 2-1402.73. The Act’s “effects clause”\n\nprohibits unjustified disparate impact, in addition to intentional discrimination: “Any practice\n\nwhich has the effect or consequence of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be\n\ndeemed to be an unlawful discriminatory practice.” D.C. Code § 2-1402.68; see also Gay Rights\n\nCoal. of Georgetown Univ. Law Ctr. v. Georgetown Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (D.C. 1987) (en banc)\n\n(“despite the absence of any intention to discriminate, practices are unlawful if they bear\n\ndisproportionately on a protected class and are not independently justified for some\n\nnondiscriminatory reason”). A defendant may protect against such a disparate-impact claim by\n\nshowing that her decision was justified by a neutral, nondiscriminatory reason, as outlined in\n\nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108284\"><a href=\"/opinion/108284/griggs-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971). See Gay Rights Coal., 536 A.2d at 29.\n\n       According to Plaintiffs’ Complaint, the effect of the school closings constitutes\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, disability, and residency. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 59-67. In\n\ntheir Opposition, however, they do not attempt to defend their claims based on disability,\n\nchoosing instead to move forward with only race- and residence-based charges. Assuming that\n\nthe school transfers have led to the denial of benefits and services, the numbers bear out\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim of disparate impact: Black and Hispanic students make up 85% of the overall\n\nschool district, but 99.6% of students in the schools to be closed. See Levy Aff., ¶ 13. And\n\nbecause school assignments depend on a child’s home address, the school closings\n\ndisproportionately affect people who reside in specific areas of the city. The school closings,\n\ntherefore, obviously bear disproportionately on students of color and students who reside east of\n\nthe Park.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\f       The District thus wisely relies on the argument that its actions were “independently\n\njustified for some nondiscriminatory reason.” Gay Rights Coal., 536 A.2d at 29. In other words,\n\nDCPS closed these schools to save much-needed money, which could then be spent to improve\n\neducation for all District students. Closing under-enrolled schools, moreover, was necessary to\n\nfree up funding so that elementary schools could uniformly be equipped with the same basic\n\nprogrammatic offerings. As discussed above, see supra, III.B.1, the District’s evidence on this\n\npoint is clear, compelling, and uncontroverted. This is fairly remarkable, given that DCPS threw\n\nopen its records to Plaintiffs and allowed them to depose some of its highest-ranking officials.\n\nThe District answered “25 Interrogatories, 21 Requests for Admission, and 20 Requests for\n\nProduction of Documents,” which yielded “almost 20,000 pages of documents, including the\n\nChancellor’s hand-written notes from meetings.” Mot. at 3. Plaintiffs questioned “DCPS Chief\n\nFinancial Officer Deloras Shepherd . . .; DCPS Chief of Strategy Peter Weber; DCPS Chief of\n\nStaff Lisa Ruda; and DCPS Chancellor Kaya Henderson.” Id. Despite all that, Plaintiffs came\n\nup empty handed. Nothing in the record points to discrimination based on race or residence.\n\nEverything, instead, points to a neutral determination undertaken for the legitimate purpose of\n\nincreasing efficiency and improving education for all students. As a result, no reasonable jury\n\ncould find for Plaintiffs under the DCHRA.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, the Court will GRANT Defendants’ Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day.\n\n                                                     /s/ James E.
