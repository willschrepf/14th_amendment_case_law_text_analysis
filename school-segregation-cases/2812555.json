Scott Loras to reimburse his former wife, Susan Mitchell,\r\nfor expenses she incurred to send their son to an outdoor therapeutic program and then to a\r\nresidential treatment facility, both of which were for the purpose of addressing his mental-health and\r\nbehavioral issues.  On appeal, Loras asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the\r\nchild-support enforcement order because (1) the evidence is insufficient to establish that the\r\nexpenses are \"health-care\" expenses within the meaning of the parties' amended divorce decree or\r\nas contemplated by the Texas Family Code, (2) the expenses were incurred in a non-emergency\r\nsituation without his consent, and (3) he is entitled to an offset for other child support he paid to\r\nMitchell during the time their son was enrolled in the treatment programs.  We will affirm.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLoras and Mitchell were divorced in 1997.  Their final divorce decree appointed both\r\nparents as joint managing conservators for their son, A.L.  Among other things, the decree specified\r\nthat both parents retained the right to (1) consent to medical treatment during an emergency\r\ninvolving an immediate danger to the health and safety of the child and (2) consent on behalf of the\r\nchild to medical treatment involving psychiatric and psychological treatment.  The decree also\r\nincluded fairly restrictive provisions regarding reimbursement of uninsured health-care expenses\r\nincurred on A.L.'s behalf for psychiatric and psychological treatment.  Those provisions required\r\neach party to pay 50% of such expenses for A.L. for three months after the date of the divorce\r\ndecree; thereafter, each parent was to pay 100% of the expenses for psychiatric and psychological\r\ntreatment authorized by that parent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn May 2007, however, following A.L.'s inpatient treatment at a Texas-based\r\nresidential treatment facility for psychological issues, Loras and Mitchell executed an agreed order\r\nthat modified the health-care provisions in the divorce decree (\"Agreed Order\").  The Agreed Order\r\nincluded the following relevant provisions:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t1.\tDefinitions--</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\"Reasonable and necessary health-care expenses not paid by insurance\r\nand incurred by or on behalf of a child\" include, without limitation . . . mental\r\nhealth-care services.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t5.\tCompliance with Insurance Company Requirements-- . . . Each party shall\r\nattempt to use \"preferred providers,\" or services within the health\r\nmaintenance organization, if applicable; however, this provision shall not\r\napply if emergency care is required or agreement between the parties. \r\nDisallowance of the bill by a health insurer shall not excuse the obligation of\r\neither party to make payment as allocated herein.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t8.\tHealth-Care Expenses Not Paid by Insurance--Subject to the provisions in\r\nparagraph 5, immediately above, IT IS ORDERED that, if health-care\r\nexpenses are incurred for the child, [Loras] and [Mitchell] shall pay all\r\nreasonable and necessary health-care expenses not paid by insurance and\r\nincurred by or on behalf of the child in the following portions:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\ta.\tIf the health-care expenses are incurred by using a HMO\r\nor PPO plan, in an emergency, or with the written\r\nagreement of the other party, [Loras] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent.\t</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\tb.\tExcept in an emergency or if the other parent agreed in\r\nwriting, if a party incurs health-care expenses for the child by\r\nusing the services of health-care providers not employed by\r\nthe HMO or approved by the PPO, [Loras] is ORDERED to\r\npay fifty (50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent.<sup> (1)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The Agreed Order further specified that the \"reasonableness of the charges for health-care expenses\r\nshall be presumed when a party is furnished with the applicable documents for the charges.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn November 2007, after A.L. exhibited violent and destructive behavior and made\r\nan outcry for assistance, Mitchell informed Loras, via email, that A.L.'s condition was rapidly\r\ndeteriorating.  Loras responded that A.L. needed to leave his mother's home \"ASAP.\"  Loras was\r\napparently unable or unwilling to take custody of A.L. at that time, however, and Mitchell's husband\r\ninformed Loras that they would keep him posted on \"when, where, and what\" they would do with\r\nA.L.  About ten days after Mitchell's initial communication with Loras, she enrolled A.L. in Outback\r\nTherapeutic Expeditions, a nine-week outdoor therapeutic camp in Utah, which Loras concedes on\r\nappeal was an \"intensely therapeutic\" program with \"well-defined health care elements.\"  Loras\r\nparticipated in A.L.'s therapy sessions at Outback--both in person and by telephone--and never\r\nsought to withdraw him from the program or requested that he be withdrawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tUpon completion of the Outback wilderness program in January 2008, A.L.'s\r\ntherapist informed Mitchell that A.L. should not return home and should instead be enrolled in a\r\nresidential treatment facility.  Mitchell communicated this information to Loras, along with a list of\r\nsix prospective facilities, as Loras had previously communicated a willingness to consider placing\r\nA.L. in a boarding school.  Loras was invited to join Mitchell in visiting the treatment centers, but\r\nhe did not respond to Mitchell's email.  She subsequently informed him that A.L. had been accepted\r\nat Discovery Ranch, a residential treatment facility in Utah.  While A.L. was being treated at\r\nDiscovery Ranch from January 2008 until he graduated high school in December 2008, Loras\r\nparticipated in A.L.'s therapy sessions--both in person and by telephone--and never sought to\r\nwithdraw him from the program or requested that he be withdrawn.  In addition, it is undisputed that\r\nLoras repeatedly encouraged A.L. to stay at Discovery Ranch for several months after he attained\r\nthe age of majority and could have withdrawn himself from the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAlthough Mitchell regularly submitted invoices to Loras and requested that he\r\nreimburse her for 50% of the expenses, Loras never reimbursed Mitchell for any expenses incurred\r\nfor A.L.'s treatment at Outback or Discovery Ranch.  As a result, in April 2009, Mitchell initiated\r\nthe underlying post-divorce enforcement action regarding expenses incurred for their son's\r\nenrollment in these programs.  After a bench trial, the trial court granted Mitchell's request for\r\nenforcement of the Agreed Order and rendered judgment against Loras for $78,659.75 in health-care\r\nrelated, child-support arrearages and $11,312.87 in attorney's fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tOn appeal, Loras presents five issues in which he asserts that the trial court abused\r\nits discretion in rendering judgment against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\"'A court's order of child support will not be disturbed on appeal unless the\r\ncomplaining party can show a clear abuse of discretion.'\"  <em>Iliff v. Iliff</em>, 339 S.W.3d 74, 78 (Tex. 2011)\r\n(quoting <em>Worford v. Stamper</em>, 801 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam)).  \"A trial court abuses\r\nits discretion when it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, without reference to guiding rules or\r\nprinciples.\"  <em>Id</em>.  \"A trial court also abuses its discretion by failing to analyze or apply the law\r\ncorrectly.\" <em> Id</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tUnder an abuse-of-discretion standard, legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\r\nare relevant factors in assessing whether the trial court abused its discretion, but they are not\r\nindependent grounds of error.  <em>Iliff v. Iliff</em>, 339 S.W.3d 126, 134 (Tex. App.--Austin 2009), <em>aff'd</em>,\r\n339 S.W.3d 74 (Tex. 2011).  Accordingly, in determining whether the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in this case, we apply a two-pronged analysis.  <em>See id</em>.  First, we must consider whether\r\nthe trial court had sufficient information on which to exercise its discretion.  <em>Id.</em>  Second, we must\r\ndetermine whether, based on the evidence, the trial court's decision was reasonable.  <em>Id</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn determining whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support a finding under\r\nreview, we examine the record for evidence and inferences that support the challenged finding,\r\nconsidering evidence favorable to the finding if a reasonable factfinder could and disregarding\r\nevidence contrary to the finding unless a reasonable factfinder could not.  <em>City of Keller v. Wilson</em>,\r\n168 S.W.3d 802, 827-28 (Tex. 2005).  Evidence is legally insufficient only when (1) the record\r\ndiscloses a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of\r\nevidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence\r\noffered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes\r\nconclusively the opposite of a vital fact.  <em>Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez</em>, 977 S.W.2d 328,\r\n334 (Tex. 1998).  We will not substitute our judgment for that of the factfinder if the evidence falls\r\nwithin the zone of reasonable disagreement. <em> City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 822.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tEvidence is factually insufficient only if the evidence adverse to the finding at issue\r\npreponderates so overwhelmingly against the challenged finding that the finding is clearly wrong and\r\nmanifestly unjust.  <em>See Cain v. Bain</em>, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAs the factfinder in this case, the trial court is the \"sole judge of the credibility of the\r\nwitnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.\"  <em>McGalliard v. Kuhlmann</em>, 722 S.W.2d 694,\r\n696 (Tex. 1986).  There is no abuse of discretion if some probative and substantive evidence\r\nsupports the trial court's order.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Zeifman v. Michels</em>, 212 S.W.3d 582, 587 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 2006, pet. denied).</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Health-Care Expenses</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his first and fifth issues, Loras asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in\r\nconcluding that the entire cost for Outback and Discovery Ranch qualifies as a health-care expense. \r\nHe contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the expenses incurred on A.L.'s\r\nbehalf at Discovery Ranch were health-care expenses because the invoices from Discovery Ranch\r\nrefer to \"tuition\" and do not include itemized medical-care expenses.  Loras contends that Discovery\r\nRanch is a \"boarding school\" and that neither the Agreed Order nor the Texas Family Code requires\r\nthe court to charge boarding school tuition as a medical support obligation.  In the alternative, he\r\ncontends that there is insufficient evidence to determine what portion of the expenses incurred at\r\nOutback and Discovery Ranch are health-care expenses because the total cost of care for A.L.\r\nincluded non-health-care components, such as tuition, room and board, and other educational costs,\r\nthat were not segregated from legitimate health-care expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tUnder the Agreed Order, \"mental health-care services\" are included within the\r\ndefinition of reimbursable health-care expenses.  In <em>Rambo v. Rambo</em>, we previously held that\r\nexpenses for an outdoor therapeutic program and a residential treatment center for a troubled teen\r\nwere health-care expenses.  No. 03-01-00257-CV, 2002 WL 24033, at *3 (Tex. App.--Austin\r\nJan. 10, 2002, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (holding that sufficient evidence\r\nsupported finding that outdoor therapy program and residential treatment expenses were health-care\r\nexpenses not covered by insurance, for which father was required to pay 50% pursuant to\r\ndivorce decree).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe factual circumstances in <em>Rambo</em> are similar to those in the present case regarding\r\nthe child's need for the services and the types of services rendered.  As in <em>Rambo</em>, there is undisputed\r\ntestimony that A.L. was an emotionally troubled teen.  At age seventeen, A.L. was combative,\r\nbehaving violently, and using drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.  He had previously been diagnosed with\r\nintermittent rage disorder, severe depression, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Even after\r\na previous stint in residential treatment in the spring of 2007, A.L.'s problems persisted and\r\nescalated to the point that his mother and stepfather were fearful that A.L. would harm them.  There\r\nwas undisputed evidence that A.L. had destroyed property, had a 10-inch military knife hidden in\r\nhis room, had injured his stepfather by throwing a rock at his head, had beaten his mother with a\r\nbroomstick, had threatened his grandmother with a dowel rod, and had previously thrown a butcher\r\nknife at his stepfather.  There were other disturbing incidents.  Mitchell was so fearful of her\r\nson's erratic behavior that she hired an off-duty sheriff's deputy to stay at her home when her\r\nhusband traveled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tDuring this time, A.L. was attending outpatient therapy, and his psychiatrist and\r\npsychologist recommended that A.L. be enrolled in a residential treatment facility.  A.L.'s\r\npsychologist contacted Loras several times to discuss this option, but Mitchell testified that, as far\r\nas she knew, Loras never met with A.L.'s psychologist to discuss the matter.  However, Loras\r\ninformed Mitchell on several occasions that he was having financial difficulties, that he wanted\r\nto reduce counseling expenditures for his son, and that his consent was required for A.L.'s\r\nhealth-care treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tOn November 3, 2007, A.L. was particularly out of control, destroying property and\r\nchoking Mitchell.  Mitchell promptly informed Loras of these circumstances by email and told him\r\nthat A.L. had begged her for help, stating \"Mom, please help me . . . I'm losing my mind . . . mom,\r\nI'm absolutely losing my mind.\"  Loras quickly responded via email that A.L. needed to leave his\r\nmother's home \"ASAP.\"  Loras testified that he intended for A.L. to come live with him. However,\r\nhe never came to collect his son, and other evidence admitted at trial indicates that Loras expressed\r\nan inability or unwillingness to take custody of A.L. for several months, if then.  Consequently,\r\nMitchell and her husband testified that they were left to seek alternative placements for A.L. \r\nMitchell's husband specifically informed Loras via email that they would be looking into other\r\nplacements and would let Loras know where A.L. would be placed.  Loras did not respond.  On\r\nNovember 13, 2007, A.L. was enrolled in Outback to address the immediate crisis and to facilitate\r\nhis later enrollment in a residential treatment facility.  On the same day, the Mitchells informed\r\nLoras of this enrollment, and Loras did not communicate any objections or reservations to them at\r\nthat time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe record reflects that, at Outback, A.L. received medical and psychological services\r\nunder the direction of a physician--including a psychological evaluation, regular counseling, lab\r\nwork, drug screening, physical assessments, and prescription medications--and engaged in intensive\r\ntherapeutic activities.  Loras participated in A.L.'s therapy sessions at Outback and at no time sought\r\nto withdraw him from the program or requested that he be withdrawn.  Shortly before A.L.'s\r\ndischarge from Outback in January 2008, however, Loras informed Mitchell via email that he would\r\nnot pay for any expenses incurred for A.L.'s enrollment at Outback because she had not obtained his\r\nprior approval and consent.  Loras now concedes that at the time A.L. was enrolled at Outback, he\r\nneeded acute care in a highly controlled environment, at least for a short while.  Loras acknowledges\r\nthat A.L.'s treatment at Outback included significant health-care components, in addition to\r\nschooling and room and board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tPrior to A.L.'s discharge from Outback, his therapists advised that further intensive\r\ntreatment was essential to his recovery.  His psychologist stated that he had \"no business\" returning\r\nhome and \"under no circumstances\" should he return home at that time.  It was recommended that\r\nA.L. be placed in a residential treatment center.  Mitchell and Loras exchanged various emails\r\nregarding further placements for A.L., and Mitchell forwarded Loras a list of potential placements. \r\nShe later informed him that only three of the treatment centers would accept A.L. and invited Loras\r\nto participate in the selection process.  Loras failed to respond to Mitchell and did not offer any input\r\non the available opportunities.  Although Loras testified that he suggested that A.L. could live with\r\nhim and go to school in Austin, the documentary evidence introduced at trial indicates that this offer\r\nwas made before A.L.'s enrollment at Outback, and there is no evidence that Loras renewed this\r\noffer when A.L.'s post-Outback placement was being considered, suggested any other placements\r\nfor A.L., or made any effort to investigate the possibility of A.L.'s enrollment elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter receiving no response from Loras, Mitchell informed Loras that A.L. had been\r\naccepted into Discovery Ranch and would be enrolled there upon his discharge from Outback. \r\nDespite Loras's characterization of Discovery Ranch as a \"boarding school,\" the evidence\r\nestablished that Discovery Ranch was a licensed residential treatment facility that provided regular\r\ncounseling to A.L. (individual, group, and family counseling) and a comprehensive therapeutic\r\nenvironment.  Loras regularly participated in A.L.'s therapy sessions, and he neither attempted to\r\nwithdraw him from the program nor asked that he be withdrawn.  Indeed, it is undisputed that Loras\r\nencouraged A.L. to remain enrolled at Discovery Ranch when A.L. suggested withdrawing from the\r\nprogram.  Loras testified that he availed himself of the psychological services offered at Discovery\r\nRanch and was amenable to A.L.'s treatment there but did not want to pay for it because he believed\r\nthe costs to be beyond his financial means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tFollowing his discharge from Discovery Ranch, A.L. was successfully enrolled in\r\ncollege and now lives with his father when he is not in school.  Mitchell testified that she believes\r\nher son would likely have ended up in jail had he not received treatment at Outback and Discovery\r\nRanch.  Mitchell's husband testified that A.L. would likely have ended up in jail or a state home for\r\npsychiatric care.  Loras testified that he had harbored doubts about whether A.L. could become a\r\nproductive adult if he was unable to control his anger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThere is sufficient evidence in the record that Outback and Discovery Ranch are\r\nintensive, inpatient therapeutic programs that provided mental health-care services to A.L., including\r\nregular counseling and therapy sessions and an environment fully integrating therapeutic goals for\r\nA.L.  Moreover, there is no evidence that the expenses were incurred for any purpose other than to\r\naddress A.L.'s mental-health issues.  Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in determining that the expenses for these services qualify as health-care expenses,\r\nregardless of whether there are distinct elements of care that, standing in isolation, might not\r\notherwise independently qualify as mental health-care services.  <em>Cf. Rambo</em>, 2002 WL 24033, at *2\r\n(rejecting father's argument that evidence was insufficient to establish that residential treatment\r\ncenter provided psychological, physical or health-care services rather than private school).  We\r\noverrule Loras's first and fifth issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Requirement of Consent to Treatment or Emergency Circumstances</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his second and third issues, Loras contends that, even if the expenses incurred at\r\nOutback and Discovery Ranch qualify as reimbursable health-care expenses, he is not responsible\r\nfor his proportionate share of the expenses because the divorce decree requires the parents' joint\r\nconsent to any medical treatment and the Agreed Order requires the use of providers covered by\r\ninsurance, except in emergency circumstances or by agreement of the parties.  It is undisputed that\r\nMitchell failed to use insurance-approved providers, and Loras contends that he did not consent to\r\nA.L.'s treatment and that the evidence is insufficient to establish that an \"emergency\" existed. \r\nBecause we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that Loras effectively\r\nconsented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch, we do not reach the issue of whether\r\nthe circumstances present an \"emergency\" within the meaning of the Agreed Order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLoras contends that his consent to treatment is required based on (1) two related\r\nprovisions in the Agreed Order--paragraph 5 and subparagraph 8(b)--and (2) the provisions in the\r\ndivorce decree appointing both parents as joint managing conservators with the right to consent to\r\nA.L.'s medical treatment and to consent on A.L.'s behalf to medical treatment involving psychiatric\r\nand psychological treatment.<sup> (2)</sup>\r\n</p><p>  Paragraph 5 of the Agreed Order provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t5.  Compliance with Insurance Company Requirements-- . . . Each party shall\r\n<em>attempt</em> to use 'preferred providers,' or services within the health maintenance\r\norganization, if applicable; however <em>this provision shall not apply if emergency care\r\nis required or agreement between the parties</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>(Emphases added.)  The trial court determined that the use of the word \"attempt\" in this paragraph\r\nmade the use of \"preferred providers\" or providers employed by a health maintenance organization\r\ndiscretionary.  We hold that the trial court's interpretation of this provision is not unreasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tEven if the requirement were not discretionary, however, the trial court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in concluding that the exception based on the parties' agreement was satisfied because\r\nLoras implicitly or explicitly consented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch.  There\r\nis sufficient evidence in the record that Loras (1) was informed that A.L. needed immediate\r\nintervention, (2) agreed with A.L.'s removal from his home and did not suggest an immediate\r\nalternative placement, (3) was promptly advised about A.L.'s placement at Outback and was\r\nprovided information about the program, (4) was advised of A.L.'s prospective enrollment at\r\nDiscovery Ranch and actual enrollment, (5) did not withdraw or seek to withdraw A.L. from either\r\nprogram or ask that he be withdrawn from either program, and (6) participated in both programs with\r\nA.L. and repeatedly encouraged A.L. not to withdraw from Discovery Ranch.  Whether characterized\r\nas consent, ratification, or estoppel from denying lack of consent, the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in concluding that Loras consented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch\r\nto the extent consent is required under paragraph 5 of the Agreed Order or the final divorce decree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLoras also contends that we must construe subparagraph 8(b) of the Agreed Order to\r\nrequire an emergency or written agreement before he is obligated to pay 50% of A.L.'s health-care\r\nexpenses.  He asserts that any other construction would render subparagraph 8(b)'s provisions\r\nmeaningless when that subparagraph is construed together with subparagraph 8(a).  In essence, Loras\r\ncontends that because both subparagraphs (a) and (b) require a 50/50 apportionment of expenses,\r\nthose paragraphs would lack distinctive meaning unless subparagraph (b) is read to require an\r\nemergency or a written agreement as a condition to his obligation to contribute.  We disagree.  Aside\r\nfrom the fact that subparagraph 8(b) explicitly applies without regard to an emergency or agreement\r\nof the parties, the paragraphs apply to different situations and thus have meaning without adding the\r\nlimitations Loras suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tParagraph 8 of the Agreed Order provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t8.\tHealth-Care Expenses Not Paid by Insurance--Subject to the provisions in\r\nparagraph 5, immediately above, IT IS ORDERED that, if health-care\r\nexpenses are incurred for the child, [Loras] and [Mitchell] shall pay all\r\nreasonable and necessary health-care expenses not paid by insurance and\r\nincurred by or on behalf of the child in the following portions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\ta.\tIf the health-care expenses are incurred by using a HMO or\r\nPPO plan, in an emergency, or with the written agreement of\r\nthe other party, [Loras] is ORDERED to pay fifty\r\n(50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tb.\tExcept in an emergency or if the other parent agreed in\r\nwriting, if a party incurs health-care expenses for the child by\r\nusing the services of health-care providers not employed by\r\nthe HMO or approved by the PPO, [Loras] is ORDERED to\r\npay fifty (50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tc.\tIf [Loras] provides health insurance for the child through an\r\nHMO or a PPO that does not provide coverage for the child\r\nwhere the child resides or have network providers in the area\r\nwhere the child resides,[Loras] is ORDERED to pay fifty\r\n(50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay fifty\r\n(50%) percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\td.\tIf the child is enrolled in a health-care plan that is not an\r\nHMO or a PPO, [Loras] is ORDERED to pay fifty (50%)\r\npercent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay fifty\r\n(50%) percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\te.\tIf the child was enrolled in a medical assistance program\r\n[under state law] and is no longer eligible for coverage in that\r\nplan or program, [Loras] is ORDERED to pay fifty (50%)\r\npercent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay fifty (50%)\r\npercent until health insurance is provided for the child or the\r\nchild is again eligible for enrollment [in the applicable state\r\nhealth-care plans].</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Subparagraph (a) requires a 50/50 split if non-covered health-care expenses are incurred using\r\ncovered providers, in an emergency, or with the parties' written agreement.  Subparagraph (b)\r\nrequires a 50/50 split if non-covered health-care expenses are incurred because the parties used a\r\nprovider not covered by the plan.  We do not perceive an ambiguity or irreconcilable conflict in these\r\nprovisions merely because they would effectively require a 50/50 split of health-care expenses in\r\nmost, if not all, cases and because there might be some overlap in their application.  The clear intent\r\nof paragraph 8 is to provide equal apportionment of health-care expenses not covered by insurance\r\nin most, if not all, scenarios.  This is evidenced not only by the breadth of subparagraphs (a) and (b)\r\nbut also by the inclusion of subparagraphs (c), (d), and (e), which similarly provide for an equal\r\napportionment of non-covered expenses.  An unambiguous contract is construed according to the\r\nplain meaning of its express wording.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Feiss v. State Farm Lloyds</em>, 202 S.W.3d 744, 753\r\n(Tex. 2006) (\"[W]here the language is plain and unambiguous, courts must enforce the contract as\r\nmade by the parties, and cannot make a new contract for them, nor change that which they have\r\nmade under the guise of construction.\").  The Agreed Order does not require written consent as a\r\nprerequisite to apportionment of expenses under subparagraph 8(b).  Indeed, the existence of a\r\nwritten agreement between the parties is an <em>exception</em> to the application of subparagraph 8(b).  And\r\nto the extent consent is required under paragraph 5, to which the apportionment provisions are\r\nsubject, we have already concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that\r\nLoras consented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch.  Loras's second and third\r\nissues are therefore overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Offset for Non-Health-Care Child-Support Payments</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his fourth issue, Loras contends that the trial court abused its discretion by failing\r\nto offset the amounts Loras paid to Mitchell for child support while A.L. was being treated at\r\nOutback and Discovery Ranch.  Loras did not plead offset, however.  \"The right of offset is an\r\naffirmative defense.  The burden of pleading offset and of proving facts necessary to support it are\r\non the party making the assertion.\"  <em>Brown v. American Transfer &amp; Storage Co.</em>, 601 S.W.2d 931,\r\n936 (Tex. 1980);<em> see also</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 157.008(d) (West 2008) (\"An obligor who has\r\nprovided actual support to the child during a time subject to an affirmative defense under this section\r\nmay request reimbursement for that support as a counterclaim or offset against the claim of the\r\nobligee.\"); Tex. R. Civ. P. 94 (\"[A] party shall set forth affirmatively . . . any . . . matter constituting\r\nan avoidance or affirmative defense.\").  Loras failed to plead offset as a defense in the underlying\r\naction; therefore, the point is waived.  We overrule Loras's fourth issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that (1) the\r\nexpenses incurred on A.L.'s behalf at Outback and Discovery Ranch are fully reimbursable\r\nhealth-care expenses, (2) use of covered providers is discretionary under the terms of the Agreed\r\nOrder, (3) Loras tacitly or explicitly consented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch,\r\nand (4) Loras waived his claim for an offset.

Scott Loras to reimburse his former wife, Susan Mitchell,\r\nfor expenses she incurred to send their son to an outdoor therapeutic program and then to a\r\nresidential treatment facility, both of which were for the purpose of addressing his mental-health and\r\nbehavioral issues.  On appeal, Loras asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the\r\nchild-support enforcement order because (1) the evidence is insufficient to establish that the\r\nexpenses are \"health-care\" expenses within the meaning of the parties' amended divorce decree or\r\nas contemplated by the Texas Family Code, (2) the expenses were incurred in a non-emergency\r\nsituation without his consent, and (3) he is entitled to an offset for other child support he paid to\r\nMitchell during the time their son was enrolled in the treatment programs.  We will affirm.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLoras and Mitchell were divorced in 1997.  Their final divorce decree appointed both\r\nparents as joint managing conservators for their son, A.L.  Among other things, the decree specified\r\nthat both parents retained the right to (1) consent to medical treatment during an emergency\r\ninvolving an immediate danger to the health and safety of the child and (2) consent on behalf of the\r\nchild to medical treatment involving psychiatric and psychological treatment.  The decree also\r\nincluded fairly restrictive provisions regarding reimbursement of uninsured health-care expenses\r\nincurred on A.L.'s behalf for psychiatric and psychological treatment.  Those provisions required\r\neach party to pay 50% of such expenses for A.L. for three months after the date of the divorce\r\ndecree; thereafter, each parent was to pay 100% of the expenses for psychiatric and psychological\r\ntreatment authorized by that parent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn May 2007, however, following A.L.'s inpatient treatment at a Texas-based\r\nresidential treatment facility for psychological issues, Loras and Mitchell executed an agreed order\r\nthat modified the health-care provisions in the divorce decree (\"Agreed Order\").  The Agreed Order\r\nincluded the following relevant provisions:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t1.\tDefinitions--</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\"Reasonable and necessary health-care expenses not paid by insurance\r\nand incurred by or on behalf of a child\" include, without limitation . . . mental\r\nhealth-care services.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t5.\tCompliance with Insurance Company Requirements-- . . . Each party shall\r\nattempt to use \"preferred providers,\" or services within the health\r\nmaintenance organization, if applicable; however, this provision shall not\r\napply if emergency care is required or agreement between the parties. \r\nDisallowance of the bill by a health insurer shall not excuse the obligation of\r\neither party to make payment as allocated herein.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t. . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t8.\tHealth-Care Expenses Not Paid by Insurance--Subject to the provisions in\r\nparagraph 5, immediately above, IT IS ORDERED that, if health-care\r\nexpenses are incurred for the child, [Loras] and [Mitchell] shall pay all\r\nreasonable and necessary health-care expenses not paid by insurance and\r\nincurred by or on behalf of the child in the following portions:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\ta.\tIf the health-care expenses are incurred by using a HMO\r\nor PPO plan, in an emergency, or with the written\r\nagreement of the other party, [Loras] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent.\t</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\tb.\tExcept in an emergency or if the other parent agreed in\r\nwriting, if a party incurs health-care expenses for the child by\r\nusing the services of health-care providers not employed by\r\nthe HMO or approved by the PPO, [Loras] is ORDERED to\r\npay fifty (50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent.<sup> (1)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The Agreed Order further specified that the \"reasonableness of the charges for health-care expenses\r\nshall be presumed when a party is furnished with the applicable documents for the charges.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn November 2007, after A.L. exhibited violent and destructive behavior and made\r\nan outcry for assistance, Mitchell informed Loras, via email, that A.L.'s condition was rapidly\r\ndeteriorating.  Loras responded that A.L. needed to leave his mother's home \"ASAP.\"  Loras was\r\napparently unable or unwilling to take custody of A.L. at that time, however, and Mitchell's husband\r\ninformed Loras that they would keep him posted on \"when, where, and what\" they would do with\r\nA.L.  About ten days after Mitchell's initial communication with Loras, she enrolled A.L. in Outback\r\nTherapeutic Expeditions, a nine-week outdoor therapeutic camp in Utah, which Loras concedes on\r\nappeal was an \"intensely therapeutic\" program with \"well-defined health care elements.\"  Loras\r\nparticipated in A.L.'s therapy sessions at Outback--both in person and by telephone--and never\r\nsought to withdraw him from the program or requested that he be withdrawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tUpon completion of the Outback wilderness program in January 2008, A.L.'s\r\ntherapist informed Mitchell that A.L. should not return home and should instead be enrolled in a\r\nresidential treatment facility.  Mitchell communicated this information to Loras, along with a list of\r\nsix prospective facilities, as Loras had previously communicated a willingness to consider placing\r\nA.L. in a boarding school.  Loras was invited to join Mitchell in visiting the treatment centers, but\r\nhe did not respond to Mitchell's email.  She subsequently informed him that A.L. had been accepted\r\nat Discovery Ranch, a residential treatment facility in Utah.  While A.L. was being treated at\r\nDiscovery Ranch from January 2008 until he graduated high school in December 2008, Loras\r\nparticipated in A.L.'s therapy sessions--both in person and by telephone--and never sought to\r\nwithdraw him from the program or requested that he be withdrawn.  In addition, it is undisputed that\r\nLoras repeatedly encouraged A.L. to stay at Discovery Ranch for several months after he attained\r\nthe age of majority and could have withdrawn himself from the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAlthough Mitchell regularly submitted invoices to Loras and requested that he\r\nreimburse her for 50% of the expenses, Loras never reimbursed Mitchell for any expenses incurred\r\nfor A.L.'s treatment at Outback or Discovery Ranch.  As a result, in April 2009, Mitchell initiated\r\nthe underlying post-divorce enforcement action regarding expenses incurred for their son's\r\nenrollment in these programs.  After a bench trial, the trial court granted Mitchell's request for\r\nenforcement of the Agreed Order and rendered judgment against Loras for $78,659.75 in health-care\r\nrelated, child-support arrearages and $11,312.87 in attorney's fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tOn appeal, Loras presents five issues in which he asserts that the trial court abused\r\nits discretion in rendering judgment against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\"'A court's order of child support will not be disturbed on appeal unless the\r\ncomplaining party can show a clear abuse of discretion.'\"  <em>Iliff v.

Accordingly, in determining whether the trial court abused its\r\ndiscretion in this case, we apply a two-pronged analysis.  <em>See id</em>.

Loras contends that Discovery\r\nRanch is a \"boarding school\" and that neither the Agreed Order nor the Texas Family Code requires\r\nthe court to charge boarding school tuition as a medical support obligation.  In the alternative, he\r\ncontends that there is insufficient evidence to determine what portion of the expenses incurred at\r\nOutback and Discovery Ranch are health-care expenses because the total cost of care for A.L.\r\nincluded non-health-care components, such as tuition, room and board, and other educational costs,\r\nthat were not segregated from legitimate health-care expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tUnder the Agreed Order, \"mental health-care services\" are included within the\r\ndefinition of reimbursable health-care expenses.

(mem. op., not designated for publication) (holding that sufficient evidence\r\nsupported finding that outdoor therapy program and residential treatment expenses were health-care\r\nexpenses not covered by insurance, for which father was required to pay 50% pursuant to\r\ndivorce decree).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe factual circumstances in <em>Rambo</em> are similar to those in the present case regarding\r\nthe child's need for the services and the types of services rendered.  As in <em>Rambo</em>, there is undisputed\r\ntestimony that A.L. was an emotionally troubled teen.  At age seventeen, A.L. was combative,\r\nbehaving violently, and using drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.  He had previously been diagnosed with\r\nintermittent rage disorder, severe depression, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Even after\r\na previous stint in residential treatment in the spring of 2007, A.L.'s problems persisted and\r\nescalated to the point that his mother and stepfather were fearful that A.L. would harm them.  There\r\nwas undisputed evidence that A.L. had destroyed property, had a 10-inch military knife hidden in\r\nhis room, had injured his stepfather by throwing a rock at his head, had beaten his mother with a\r\nbroomstick, had threatened his grandmother with a dowel rod, and had previously thrown a butcher\r\nknife at his stepfather.  There were other disturbing incidents.  Mitchell was so fearful of her\r\nson's erratic behavior that she hired an off-duty sheriff's deputy to stay at her home when her\r\nhusband traveled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tDuring this time, A.L. was attending outpatient therapy, and his psychiatrist and\r\npsychologist recommended that A.L. be enrolled in a residential treatment facility.  A.L.'s\r\npsychologist contacted Loras several times to discuss this option, but Mitchell testified that, as far\r\nas she knew, Loras never met with A.L.'s psychologist to discuss the matter.  However, Loras\r\ninformed Mitchell on several occasions that he was having financial difficulties, that he wanted\r\nto reduce counseling expenditures for his son, and that his consent was required for A.L.'s\r\nhealth-care treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tOn November 3, 2007, A.L. was particularly out of control, destroying property and\r\nchoking Mitchell.  Mitchell promptly informed Loras of these circumstances by email and told him\r\nthat A.L. had begged her for help, stating \"Mom, please help me . . . I'm losing my mind . . . mom,\r\nI'm absolutely losing my mind.\"  Loras quickly responded via email that A.L. needed to leave his\r\nmother's home \"ASAP.\"  Loras testified that he intended for A.L. to come live with him. However,\r\nhe never came to collect his son, and other evidence admitted at trial indicates that Loras expressed\r\nan inability or unwillingness to take custody of A.L. for several months, if then.  Consequently,\r\nMitchell and her husband testified that they were left to seek alternative placements for A.L. \r\nMitchell's husband specifically informed Loras via email that they would be looking into other\r\nplacements and would let Loras know where A.L. would be placed.  Loras did not respond.  On\r\nNovember 13, 2007, A.L. was enrolled in Outback to address the immediate crisis and to facilitate\r\nhis later enrollment in a residential treatment facility.  On the same day, the Mitchells informed\r\nLoras of this enrollment, and Loras did not communicate any objections or reservations to them at\r\nthat time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe record reflects that, at Outback, A.L. received medical and psychological services\r\nunder the direction of a physician--including a psychological evaluation, regular counseling, lab\r\nwork, drug screening, physical assessments, and prescription medications--and engaged in intensive\r\ntherapeutic activities.  Loras participated in A.L.'s therapy sessions at Outback and at no time sought\r\nto withdraw him from the program or requested that he be withdrawn.  Shortly before A.L.'s\r\ndischarge from Outback in January 2008, however, Loras informed Mitchell via email that he would\r\nnot pay for any expenses incurred for A.L.'s enrollment at Outback because she had not obtained his\r\nprior approval and consent.  Loras now concedes that at the time A.L. was enrolled at Outback, he\r\nneeded acute care in a highly controlled environment, at least for a short while.  Loras acknowledges\r\nthat A.L.'s treatment at Outback included significant health-care components, in addition to\r\nschooling and room and board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tPrior to A.L.'s discharge from Outback, his therapists advised that further intensive\r\ntreatment was essential to his recovery.  His psychologist stated that he had \"no business\" returning\r\nhome and \"under no circumstances\" should he return home at that time.  It was recommended that\r\nA.L. be placed in a residential treatment center.  Mitchell and Loras exchanged various emails\r\nregarding further placements for A.L., and Mitchell forwarded Loras a list of potential placements. \r\nShe later informed him that only three of the treatment centers would accept A.L. and invited Loras\r\nto participate in the selection process.  Loras failed to respond to Mitchell and did not offer any input\r\non the available opportunities.  Although Loras testified that he suggested that A.L. could live with\r\nhim and go to school in Austin, the documentary evidence introduced at trial indicates that this offer\r\nwas made before A.L.'s enrollment at Outback, and there is no evidence that Loras renewed this\r\noffer when A.L.'s post-Outback placement was being considered, suggested any other placements\r\nfor A.L., or made any effort to investigate the possibility of A.L.'s enrollment elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter receiving no response from Loras, Mitchell informed Loras that A.L. had been\r\naccepted into Discovery Ranch and would be enrolled there upon his discharge from Outback. \r\nDespite Loras's characterization of Discovery Ranch as a \"boarding school,\" the evidence\r\nestablished that Discovery Ranch was a licensed residential treatment facility that provided regular\r\ncounseling to A.L. (individual, group, and family counseling) and a comprehensive therapeutic\r\nenvironment.  Loras regularly participated in A.L.'s therapy sessions, and he neither attempted to\r\nwithdraw him from the program nor asked that he be withdrawn.  Indeed, it is undisputed that Loras\r\nencouraged A.L. to remain enrolled at Discovery Ranch when A.L. suggested withdrawing from the\r\nprogram.  Loras testified that he availed himself of the psychological services offered at Discovery\r\nRanch and was amenable to A.L.'s treatment there but did not want to pay for it because he believed\r\nthe costs to be beyond his financial means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tFollowing his discharge from Discovery Ranch, A.L. was successfully enrolled in\r\ncollege and now lives with his father when he is not in school.  Mitchell testified that she believes\r\nher son would likely have ended up in jail had he not received treatment at Outback and Discovery\r\nRanch.  Mitchell's husband testified that A.L. would likely have ended up in jail or a state home for\r\npsychiatric care.  Loras testified that he had harbored doubts about whether A.L. could become a\r\nproductive adult if he was unable to control his anger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThere is sufficient evidence in the record that Outback and Discovery Ranch are\r\nintensive, inpatient therapeutic programs that provided mental health-care services to A.L., including\r\nregular counseling and therapy sessions and an environment fully integrating therapeutic goals for\r\nA.L.  Moreover, there is no evidence that the expenses were incurred for any purpose other than to\r\naddress A.L.'s mental-health issues.  Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in determining that the expenses for these services qualify as health-care expenses,\r\nregardless of whether there are distinct elements of care that, standing in isolation, might not\r\notherwise independently qualify as mental health-care services.  <em>Cf. Rambo</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">24033</span></span>, at *2\r\n(rejecting father's argument that evidence was insufficient to establish that residential treatment\r\ncenter provided psychological, physical or health-care services rather than private school).  We\r\noverrule Loras's first and fifth issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Requirement of Consent to Treatment or Emergency Circumstances</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his second and third issues, Loras contends that, even if the expenses incurred at\r\nOutback and Discovery Ranch qualify as reimbursable health-care expenses, he is not responsible\r\nfor his proportionate share of the expenses because the divorce decree requires the parents' joint\r\nconsent to any medical treatment and the Agreed Order requires the use of providers covered by\r\ninsurance, except in emergency circumstances or by agreement of the parties.  It is undisputed that\r\nMitchell failed to use insurance-approved providers, and Loras contends that he did not consent to\r\nA.L.'s treatment and that the evidence is insufficient to establish that an \"emergency\" existed. \r\nBecause we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that Loras effectively\r\nconsented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch, we do not reach the issue of whether\r\nthe circumstances present an \"emergency\" within the meaning of the Agreed Order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLoras contends that his consent to treatment is required based on (1) two related\r\nprovisions in the Agreed Order--paragraph 5 and subparagraph 8(b)--and (2) the provisions in the\r\ndivorce decree appointing both parents as joint managing conservators with the right to consent to\r\nA.L.'s medical treatment and to consent on A.L.'s behalf to medical treatment involving psychiatric\r\nand psychological treatment.<sup> (2)</sup>\r\n</p><p>  Paragraph 5 of the Agreed Order provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t5.  Compliance with Insurance Company Requirements-- . . . Each party shall\r\n<em>attempt</em> to use 'preferred providers,' or services within the health maintenance\r\norganization, if applicable; however <em>this provision shall not apply if emergency care\r\nis required or agreement between the parties</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>(Emphases added.)  The trial court determined that the use of the word \"attempt\" in this paragraph\r\nmade the use of \"preferred providers\" or providers employed by a health maintenance organization\r\ndiscretionary.  We hold that the trial court's interpretation of this provision is not unreasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tEven if the requirement were not discretionary, however, the trial court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in concluding that the exception based on the parties' agreement was satisfied because\r\nLoras implicitly or explicitly consented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch.  There\r\nis sufficient evidence in the record that Loras (1) was informed that A.L. needed immediate\r\nintervention, (2) agreed with A.L.'s removal from his home and did not suggest an immediate\r\nalternative placement, (3) was promptly advised about A.L.'s placement at Outback and was\r\nprovided information about the program, (4) was advised of A.L.'s prospective enrollment at\r\nDiscovery Ranch and actual enrollment, (5) did not withdraw or seek to withdraw A.L. from either\r\nprogram or ask that he be withdrawn from either program, and (6) participated in both programs with\r\nA.L. and repeatedly encouraged A.L. not to withdraw from Discovery Ranch.  Whether characterized\r\nas consent, ratification, or estoppel from denying lack of consent, the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in concluding that Loras consented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch\r\nto the extent consent is required under paragraph 5 of the Agreed Order or the final divorce decree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLoras also contends that we must construe subparagraph 8(b) of the Agreed Order to\r\nrequire an emergency or written agreement before he is obligated to pay 50% of A.L.'s health-care\r\nexpenses.  He asserts that any other construction would render subparagraph 8(b)'s provisions\r\nmeaningless when that subparagraph is construed together with subparagraph 8(a).  In essence, Loras\r\ncontends that because both subparagraphs (a) and (b) require a 50/50 apportionment of expenses,\r\nthose paragraphs would lack distinctive meaning unless subparagraph (b) is read to require an\r\nemergency or a written agreement as a condition to his obligation to contribute.  We disagree.  Aside\r\nfrom the fact that subparagraph 8(b) explicitly applies without regard to an emergency or agreement\r\nof the parties, the paragraphs apply to different situations and thus have meaning without adding the\r\nlimitations Loras suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tParagraph 8 of the Agreed Order provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t8.\tHealth-Care Expenses Not Paid by Insurance--Subject to the provisions in\r\nparagraph 5, immediately above, IT IS ORDERED that, if health-care\r\nexpenses are incurred for the child, [Loras] and [Mitchell] shall pay all\r\nreasonable and necessary health-care expenses not paid by insurance and\r\nincurred by or on behalf of the child in the following portions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\ta.\tIf the health-care expenses are incurred by using a HMO or\r\nPPO plan, in an emergency, or with the written agreement of\r\nthe other party, [Loras] is ORDERED to pay fifty\r\n(50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tb.\tExcept in an emergency or if the other parent agreed in\r\nwriting, if a party incurs health-care expenses for the child by\r\nusing the services of health-care providers not employed by\r\nthe HMO or approved by the PPO, [Loras] is ORDERED to\r\npay fifty (50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay\r\nfifty (50%) percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tc.\tIf [Loras] provides health insurance for the child through an\r\nHMO or a PPO that does not provide coverage for the child\r\nwhere the child resides or have network providers in the area\r\nwhere the child resides,[Loras] is ORDERED to pay fifty\r\n(50%) percent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay fifty\r\n(50%) percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\td.\tIf the child is enrolled in a health-care plan that is not an\r\nHMO or a PPO, [Loras] is ORDERED to pay fifty (50%)\r\npercent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay fifty\r\n(50%) percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\te.\tIf the child was enrolled in a medical assistance program\r\n[under state law] and is no longer eligible for coverage in that\r\nplan or program, [Loras] is ORDERED to pay fifty (50%)\r\npercent and [Mitchell] is ORDERED to pay fifty (50%)\r\npercent until health insurance is provided for the child or the\r\nchild is again eligible for enrollment [in the applicable state\r\nhealth-care plans].</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Subparagraph (a) requires a 50/50 split if non-covered health-care expenses are incurred using\r\ncovered providers, in an emergency, or with the parties' written agreement.  Subparagraph (b)\r\nrequires a 50/50 split if non-covered health-care expenses are incurred because the parties used a\r\nprovider not covered by the plan.  We do not perceive an ambiguity or irreconcilable conflict in these\r\nprovisions merely because they would effectively require a 50/50 split of health-care expenses in\r\nmost, if not all, cases and because there might be some overlap in their application.  The clear intent\r\nof paragraph 8 is to provide equal apportionment of health-care expenses not covered by insurance\r\nin most, if not all, scenarios.  This is evidenced not only by the breadth of subparagraphs (a) and (b)\r\nbut also by the inclusion of subparagraphs (c), (d), and (e), which similarly provide for an equal\r\napportionment of non-covered expenses.  An unambiguous contract is construed according to the\r\nplain meaning of its express wording.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Feiss v. State Farm Lloyds</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894775\"><a href=\"/opinion/894775/fiess-v-state-farm-lloyds/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span>, 753\r\n(Tex. 2006) (\"[W]here the language is plain and unambiguous, courts must enforce the contract as\r\nmade by the parties, and cannot make a new contract for them, nor change that which they have\r\nmade under the guise of construction.\").  The Agreed Order does not require written consent as a\r\nprerequisite to apportionment of expenses under subparagraph 8(b).  Indeed, the existence of a\r\nwritten agreement between the parties is an <em>exception</em> to the application of subparagraph 8(b).  And\r\nto the extent consent is required under paragraph 5, to which the apportionment provisions are\r\nsubject, we have already concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that\r\nLoras consented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch.  Loras's second and third\r\nissues are therefore overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Offset for Non-Health-Care Child-Support Payments</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn his fourth issue, Loras contends that the trial court abused its discretion by failing\r\nto offset the amounts Loras paid to Mitchell for child support while A.L. was being treated at\r\nOutback and Discovery Ranch.  Loras did not plead offset, however.  \"The right of offset is an\r\naffirmative defense.  The burden of pleading offset and of proving facts necessary to support it are\r\non the party making the assertion.\"  <em>Brown v. American Transfer &amp; Storage Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1514858\"><a href=\"/opinion/1514858/brown-v-american-transfer-storage-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>,\r\n936 (Tex. 1980);<em> see also</em> Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 157.008(d) (West 2008) (\"An obligor who has\r\nprovided actual support to the child during a time subject to an affirmative defense under this section\r\nmay request reimbursement for that support as a counterclaim or offset against the claim of the\r\nobligee.\"); Tex. R. Civ. P. 94 (\"[A] party shall set forth affirmatively . . . any . . . matter constituting\r\nan avoidance or affirmative defense.\").  Loras failed to plead offset as a defense in the underlying\r\naction; therefore, the point is waived.  We overrule Loras's fourth issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that (1) the\r\nexpenses incurred on A.L.'s behalf at Outback and Discovery Ranch are fully reimbursable\r\nhealth-care expenses, (2) use of covered providers is discretionary under the terms of the Agreed\r\nOrder, (3) Loras tacitly or explicitly consented to A.L.'s treatment at Outback and Discovery Ranch,\r\nand (4) Loras waived his claim for an offset.  For these reasons, the trial court's judgment is\r\naffirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t_________________________________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tJ.

Paragraph 8 of the Agreed Order specified three additional scenarios in which health-care\r\nexpenses not covered by insurance must be apportioned between the parties, none of which is alleged\r\nto be applicable in this case and all of which similarly require a 50/50 split between Loras\r\nand Mitchell.\r\n</p><p>2.
