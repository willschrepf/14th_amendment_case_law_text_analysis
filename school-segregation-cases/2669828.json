Williams, of MORRIS JAMES LLP, Wilmington, Delaware; Attorney for\nAppellant.\n\nJeffrey M. Weiner, of the LAW OFFICE OF JEFFREY M. WEINER, P.A.,\nWilmington, Delaware; Attorney for Appellee.\n\nGLASSCOCK, Vice Chancellor\n\f      Employers and employees typically agree on terms before work commences.\n\nThis common-sense custom did not prevail in the current dispute, which involves a\n\nsmall bargaining unit of police captains and inspectors (the ―Bargaining Unit‖)\n\nemployed by the City of Wilmington (the ―City‖). Those individuals have been\n\nworking since mid-2010 without a contract. Negotiations between the City and the\n\nBargaining Unit‘s exclusive bargaining representative, the Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice, Lodge 1 (the ―FOP‖), did not even begin until November of 2010 and were\n\nnot fruitful. The employees have been paid under the terms of the former contract,\n\nwhich expired on June 30, 2010, as called for in the law governing collective\n\nbargaining between police and Delaware governmental entities—the Police\n\nOfficers‘ and Firefighters‘ Employment Relations Act (the ―POFERA‖), 19 Del. C.\n\n§ 1601 et seq. Eventually, pursuant to the terms of the POFERA, the parties came\n\nbefore an arbitrator, who, under POFERA rules, was required to choose, based on\n\nstatutory criteria, between the last, best, final offer (―LBFO‖) of each party, which\n\nhad to be accepted in toto. In making this choice, the arbitrator had discretion,\n\nexcept with respect to one factor: If the City could not pay the salary and benefits\n\nproposed in the FOP‘s LBFO from ―existing revenues,‖ the arbitrator was required\n\nto reject that proposal and impose the City‘s LBFO.\n\n      The arbitrator ruled on September 8, 2014, accepting the FOP‘s LBFO after\n\nfinding that the City could ―afford‖ it, apparently finding it could be paid for with\n\n\n                                         1\n\fexisting revenues. The FOP‘s offer was for a period ending on June 30, 2014.\n\nThus, as of the time of the arbitration order, the term of employment called for had\n\nbeen completed in its entirety. Exercising its rights under the POFERA, the City\n\nappealed the arbitrator‘s decision to the Public Employment Relations Board (the\n\n―PERB‖), which affirmed, and then appealed the decision of the PERB to this\n\nCourt.\n\n         The parties agree that the POFERA was adopted by the General Assembly\n\nunder the apparent (and entirely reasonable) assumption that it would apply\n\nprospectively, here meaning the parties would use the POFERA to resolve\n\ncollective bargaining disputes over contracts governing future relationships. The\n\ndifferences between the parties arise in large part because of the difficulties of\n\napplying the POFERA where the parties have acted in reverse order—work first,\n\nthen agree to terms. The issues raised are legal, and subject to de novo review. I\n\nfind, for the reasons below, that the arbitrator and the PERB got some issues of law\n\nright and some wrong. Because those issues they got wrong might have affected\n\nthe exercise of discretion by the arbitrator, I ask the parties to comment on whether\n\na remand is necessary. The facts, and my reasoning, are set out below.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                               I. BACKGROUND FACTS1\n\n       This case arises under the POFERA, which, generally, grants Delaware‘s\n\npolice officers and firefighters certain rights to collectively bargain, sets forth the\n\nlaws governing that process—including a process for resolving collective\n\nbargaining disputes—and charges the PERB with administering those laws.2\n\nPursuant to the POFERA, collective bargaining disputes proceed first to mediation\n\nand, if mediation is unsuccessful, then to binding interest arbitration.3                     An\n\narbitrator‘s decision may be appealed to the PERB, whose decision may then be\n\nappealed to this Court.4 Before me is such an appeal by the City from a decision of\n\nthe PERB, itself affirming on appeal an arbitrator‘s decision resolving a collective\n\nbargaining dispute between the FOP and the City in favor of the FOP.\n\n       A. The Parties\n\n       The City is a public employer within the meaning of Section 1602(l) of the\n\nPOFERA.5\n\n\n\n1\n  Unless otherwise indicated, the factual background is drawn from the record created in the\nPERB proceedings. Citations to that record appear as ―R. [page number],‖ without the use of\nshort forms.\n2\n  See 19 Del. C. § 1601.\n3\n  See id. §§ 1614–1615. Interest arbitration is a process in which the terms and conditions of the\nparties‘ contract are established by an arbitral tribunal; it differs from so-called ―grievance\narbitration,‖ in which an arbitral panel applies the terms and conditions of a contract already in\nexistence between the parties to a dispute between those parties in order to determine whether\nthe contract has been breached. Arvid Anderson & Loren A. Krause, Interest Arbitration: The\nAlternative to the Strike, 56 Fordham L. Rev. 153, 153 (1987).\n4\n   See 19 Del. C. §§ 1609, 1615.\n5\n  See id. § 1602(l).\n\n                                                3\n\f       The FOP is an employee organization within the meaning of Section 1602(g)\n\nof the POFERA,6 and is certified by the PERB as the exclusive bargaining\n\nrepresentative of the Bargaining Unit, a small group of high-ranking police officers\n\nemployed by the City.7 At the time of the arbitration hearing, the Bargaining Unit\n\nincluded seven captains and one inspector, and had one additional vacancy for an\n\ninspector.8\n\n       B. The Parties’ Collective Bargaining Dispute\n\n       The City and the FOP were parties to a collective bargaining agreement\n\n(―CBA‖) for the Bargaining Unit that had a term of July 1, 2007 through June 30,\n\n2010, which comprises the City‘s fiscal year (―FY‖) 2008 through FY 2010.9\n\nFollowing the expiration of that CBA, the City and the FOP entered into prolonged\n\nand unsuccessful negotiations on a successor CBA from November 2010 to\n\nFebruary 2012.10        Unable to reach an accord, the parties attempted, again\n\nunsuccessfully, to mediate their dispute from June 2012 to January 2014 with a\n\nPERB-appointed mediator.11 On January 20, 2014, the mediator recommended, at\n\n\n\n6\n  See id. § 1602(g).\n7\n  R. 1354; see also 19 Del. C. § 1602(h) (defining ―exclusive bargaining representative‖).\n8\n   R. 600, 1224–25. In total, at the time of the hearing the City employed 306 police officers,\nincluding captains and inspectors, of its authorized strength of 320 officers. R. 1363. The FOP\nalso represented the 298 rank-and-file officers employed by the City at the time. R. 1363.\n9\n  R. 1354. The City‘s fiscal year runs from July 1st of the previous calendar year (i.e., FY X – 1)\nto June 30th of the following calendar year (i.e., FY X).\n10\n   R. 1354, 1427.\n11\n   R. 1355.\n\n                                                4\n\fthe behest of the FOP, that the parties‘ dispute be submitted to arbitration.12 The\n\nPERB determined that arbitration was appropriate and commenced arbitral\n\nproceedings with Deborah L. Murray-Sheppard, the Executive Director of the\n\nPERB, serving as arbitrator for the dispute (the ―Arbitrator‖).13\n\n       Following the expiration of the parties‘ previous CBA and during the\n\npendency of the parties‘ dispute over a successor CBA, the members of the\n\nBargaining Unit remained employed with the City and, as is required by law,\n\ncontinued to receive the pay and benefits to which they were entitled in the last\n\nyear that the previous CBA was in effect (i.e., FY 2010).14\n\n       C. The Parties’ Last, Best, Final Offers\n\n       Pursuant to the POFERA, arbitration on collective bargaining disputes\n\nbetween a public employer and its police and firefighter unions is done ―baseball\n\nstyle.‖ Each side presents to the arbitrator its LFBO, and the arbitrator is then\n\nrequired, based on an evaluation of seven factors set out in 19 Del. C. § 1615(d),15\n\n\n12\n   R. 1355.\n13\n   R. 1355.\n14\n   Oral Arg. 36:15 – 23. By the time the dispute reached arbitration, though, the City had\nreduced the number of captains from its previous number of eight to seven through attrition,\nresulting in the work of the outgoing captain being redistributed among the remaining seven\nCaptains. R. 1363.\n15\n   Those factors are:\n        (1) The interests and welfare of the public.\n        (2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, benefits, hours and conditions of\n            employment of the employees involved in the binding interest arbitration\n            proceedings with the wages, salaries, benefits hours and conditions of\n            employment of other employees performing the same or similar services or\n            requiring similar skills under similar working conditions in the same\n\n                                             5\n\fto chose the LBFO of either the public employer or the union; the arbitrator may\n\nnot pick and choose between provisions of the two LBFOs, or create terms of her\n\nown.16\n\n       In February 2014, the FOP and the City each submitted its LBFO for\n\nconsideration by the Arbitrator.17 In the FOP‘s LBFO, the FOP proposed a CBA\n\nwith a term of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2014—i.e., covering the fiscal years\n\nthat had passed since the parties‘ previous CBA had expired.18 Among other\n\nthings, the FOP‘s LBFO included retroactive cost-of-living adjustments to the\n\nsalary schedules for FY 2012 and FY 2013, effectuating retroactive increases in\n\n\n\n            community and in comparable communities and with other employees\n            generally in the same community and in comparable communities.\n        (3) The overall compensation presently received by the employees inclusive of\n            direct wages, salary, vacations, holidays, excused leaves, insurance and\n            pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and stability of\n            employment, and all other benefits received.\n        (4) Stipulations of the parties.\n        (5) The lawful authority of the public employer.\n        (6) The financial ability of the public employer, based on existing revenues, to\n            meet the costs of any proposed settlements; provided that any enhancement to\n            such financial ability derived from savings experienced by such public\n            employer as a result of a strike shall not be considered by the binding interest\n            arbitrator.\n        (7) Such other factors not confined to the foregoing which are normally or\n            traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours and\n            conditions of employment through voluntary collective bargaining, mediation,\n            binding interest arbitration or otherwise between parties, in the public service\n            or in private employment.\n19 Del. C. § 1615(d).\n16\n   See id. (―The binding interest arbitrator shall make written findings of facts and a decision for\nthe resolution of the dispute; provided however, that the decision shall be limited to a\ndetermination of which of the parties‘ last, best, final offers shall be accepted in its entirety.‖).\n17\n   R. 1355.\n18\n   R. 38.\n\n                                                 6\n\fannual salary of $1,000 to $3,000 (depending on the specific Bargaining Unit\n\nemployee) for each of those years.19 The cost of these salary increases, as well as\n\nof other costs generated by the FOP‘s LBFO, would be partially offset by crediting\n\nthe City for a one-time payment it made to all City employees in lieu of a cost-of-\n\nliving adjustment in November 2012 and by increasing the Bargaining Unit\n\nemployees‘ contributions to healthcare costs, effective retroactively on January 1,\n\n2013.20 The FOP estimated that the total projected cost of its LBFO through FY\n\n2014 would be $45,653.56.21 The City, on the other hand, estimated the projected\n\ncost through FY 2015, arguing that the costs of the increased salaries would carry\n\nover automatically when the CBA expired in FY 2014; it placed this projected cost\n\nat $184,685.22\n\n       As to the City‘s LBFO, the City proposed a CBA with a term from July 1,\n\n2014 through June 30, 2016—i.e., covering, at the time, future fiscal years.\n\nAmong other things, the City‘s LBFO increased the Bargaining Unit employees‘\n\ncontributions to healthcare costs.23 However, the City‘s LBFO did not include any\n\ncost-of-living adjustments, to either the fiscal years covered by the proposed CBA\n\nor the fiscal years prior.24 As a result, the City‘s LBFO would not cause the City to\n\n\n19\n   See R. 38–42.\n20\n   R. 38–39, 43–44; see also R. 1368–69.\n21\n   R. 1369; see also R. 1304.\n22\n   R. 1316.\n23\n   R. 46, 49.\n24\n   R. 46–47, 1374–75.\n\n                                           7\n\fincur any additional costs, and in fact would decrease total compensation to the\n\nBargaining Unit employees by increasing their healthcare costs.25\n\n       D. The City’s Finances\n\n       Among the seven Section 1615(d) factors which the arbitrator must consider\n\nin making her determination as to which LBFO to adopt is subsection (d)(6), ―the\n\nfinancial ability of the public employer, based on existing revenues, to meet the\n\ncosts of any proposed settlement.‖26 While the arbitrator is statutorily bound to\n\nconsider all factors listed in Section 1615(d), the factor in subsection (d)(6), and\n\nonly this factor, may be dispositive on the arbitrator‘s analysis.27 In other words,\n\nsubsection (d)(6) serves as a disqualifier: The arbitrator must accept the public\n\nemployer‘s LBFO if it determines that the public employer does not have the\n\nfinancial ability, based on existing revenues, to meet the costs of the union‘s\n\nLBFO, provided, of course, that the public employer has the financial ability to\n\nmeet the costs of its own LBFO.28\n\n\n\n\n25\n   R. 1368.\n26\n   19 Del. C. § 1615(d)(6).\n27\n   See id. § 1615(d) (―In making determinations, the binding interest arbitrator shall give due\nweight to each relevant factor. . . . With the exception of paragraph (d)(6) of this section, no\nsingle factor in this subsection shall be dispositive.‖); Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 v.\nNew Castle Cnty., 2014 WL 351009, at *5 (Del. Ch. Jan. 29, 2014).\n28\n    I note that this disqualifier technically works both ways—the arbitrator must accept the\nunion‘s LBFO if she determines that the public employer has the ability, based on existing\nrevenues, to meet the costs of the union‘s LBFO but not to meet the costs of its own LBFO—\nalthough this scenario, obviously, is unlikely.\n\n                                               8\n\f       In the arbitration, on appeal to the PERB, and now on appeal to this Court,\n\nthe City has argued that it does not have the financial ability, based on existing\n\nrevenues, to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO. Thus, in all three proceedings, the\n\nCity‘s finances have been a central focus.\n\n               1. The City‘s Budget\n\n                       a. The Budget Process\n\n       The City‘s charter (the ―Charter‖) requires the City each fiscal year to pass\n\nand maintain a balanced budget, which, according to the Charter, means a budget\n\nwhere projected revenues equal operating expenditures plus any existing deficits.29\n\nEach budget cycle, the Office of the Mayor of the City (the ―Mayor‖), working in\n\nconjunction with the Office of Management and Budget (the ―OMB‖) and the\n\nDepartment of Finance, and in consultation with the heads of the City‘s various\n\nother departments and the public, must determine the City‘s existing deficit and\n\nsurplus, create revenue projections for the City for the upcoming year, develop an\n\ninitial budget proposal, and submit all of this information to the City‘s legislative\n\n\n\n29\n   See Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-300(1) (―It shall be the duty of the council, at least thirty (30) days\nbefore the end of the fiscal year, to adopt the annual operating budget ordinance for the next\nfiscal year.‖); id. § 2-300(2) (―The annual operating budget ordinance shall provide for\ndischarging any deficit and shall make appropriations to the council, the mayor, and all officers,\ndepartments, boards and commissions which form a part of the executive or administrative\nbranch of the government, and for all other items which are to be met out of the revenue of the\ncity.‖); id. § 2-302 (―Not later than the passage of the annual operating budget ordinance, the\ncouncil shall ordain such revenue measures as will, in the opinion of the mayor, yield sufficient\nrevenue to balance the budget.‖).\n\n                                                 9\n\fbody, the City Council (the ―Council‖).30 The Charter reserves the authority to\n\nalter and adopt the budget on behalf of the City to the Council.31 However, in\n\nfinalizing the budget provided to it by the Mayor, the Council must utilize the\n\nMayor‘s estimates for the City‘s surplus, deficit, and projected revenues.32\n\n       Once the Council has adopted the budget, it may not make any additional\n\noperating appropriations in that fiscal year except in certain situations enumerated\n\nin the Charter, such as to meet the costs of unanticipated emergencies.33 In cases\n\nwhere the Council does modify the budget to appropriate additional money, the\n\nCouncil ―must determine and approve the revenue by which [the] addition to the\n\nbudget will be funded‖ in order to maintain a balanced budget;34 any portion of the\n\nadditional costs that cannot be paid out of the revenues for that fiscal year carry\n\nover to the following fiscal year as deficit.35\n\n\n\n\n30\n   Id. § 4-401(b); R. 640–41.\n31\n   Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-300(1); see also R. 641. The Council‘s approved budget, however, is\nsubject to the Mayor‘s traditional and line-item veto, both of which may be overridden by a two-\nthirds vote of the Council. See Wilm C. § 2-202.\n32\n   Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-300(3); see also R. 641.\n33\n   See Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-301; R. 641. For example, in FY 2014 the Council had to approve\nadditional spending so the City could cover the unanticipated expenses of severe winter weather.\nR. 929. The OMB ―has the authority to transfer budget allocations between accounts that are\nwithin the same Fund, Department, and Account Group,‖ but the Council must approve ―[a]ny\nother type of transfer, such as between Funds, Departments or different Account Groups‖ as well\nas any deletions to the budget. R. 641.\n34\n   R. 641.\n35\n   Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-301.\n\n                                              10\n\f       The City can only spend money that has first been appropriated through the\n\nbudget process, either as part of the budget‘s initial approval or as part of an ex\n\npost modification.36\n\n                      b. Deficit Spending\n\n       Despite the balanced budget requirement in the Charter, it is still possible for\n\nthe City to engage in deficit spending, meaning in any given fiscal year the City‘s\n\nexpenditures exceed revenues generated by the City.                        This could occur\n\ninadvertently in the budget process, such as if the Mayor overestimates the City‘s\n\nrevenues in its projections, allowing the Council to appropriate more money than\n\nthe City can actually match with revenues, but it could also occur advertently at\n\ncertain stages in the budget process. First, in the development phase, it is the\n\nCity‘s financial policy that the Mayor may, with limited exceptions, include prior\n\nyears‘ accumulated surplus in its revenue projections.37 This allows the City to\n\n―limit[] tax increases because prior years‘ surplus [is] used prior to revenue\n\nenhancements.‖38 Second, if the Council modifies the budget during the fiscal year\n\nto make additional appropriations, the Council may ordain prior years‘\n\n\n\n36\n   See Wilm. C. (Charter) §§ 2-300, 2-301; R. 929.\n37\n   E.g., R. 646; cf. R. 641 (―For the budget to be legally balanced, revenues plus an amount of\nexisting prior years‘ surpluses, if any, must equal operating expenditures plus any existing\ndeficits.‖). The exceptions are those portions of prior years‘ accumulated surplus ―designated for\ndebt service, encumbrances or the Budget Reserve Account.‖ R. 646; see also infra note 46\n(explaining the Budget Reserve Account).\n38\n   R. 646.\n\n                                               11\n\faccumulated surplus as the ―revenue‖ by which to fund those additional\n\nexpenditures.39\n\n                      c. Fund Accounting\n\n       In order to ―segregate the specific purposes and operations of the various\n\nactivities of the City,‖ the City organizes its budget, including both the accounting\n\nand budgeting portions, into four major funds: The General Fund, the Special\n\nFunds, the Water/Sewer Fund, and the Internal Service Fund.40 According to the\n\nCity, ―Funds can be thought of as being like the subsidiaries of a major\n\nconglomerate corporation. Each subsidiary is responsible for its own operational\n\nresults and strategy, yet is still part of the larger conglomerate corporation when it\n\ncomes to overall management and financial results.‖41 Basic municipal operations\n\nand services, including police and fire protection, fall under the General Fund, the\n\nrevenues for which are derived from taxes, fees, fines, and interest on\n\ninvestments.42 The parties here agree that the revenue available to meet the costs\n\nof their CBA must come from the General Fund.\n\n       For each budget cycle, the City‘s budget includes balance sheets in its\n\nfinancial statements that tally the General Fund‘s ―fund balance‖ as of the end of\n\n\n\n39\n   See, e.g., R. 929–30.\n40\n   R. 642. With the exception of certain smaller funds within the Special Funds, the expenditures\nfor all the four major funds are appropriated through the budget process. R. 651.\n41\n   R. 642.\n42\n   R. 649.\n\n                                               12\n\fthe prior fiscal year.43 This value accounts for the difference between the General\n\nFund‘s assets and liabilities at that moment in time.44 In other words, the General\n\nFund‘s fund balance in the financial statements represents the net calculation for\n\nthe General Fund‘s annual operating surpluses and deficits in all previous years: If\n\nthe fund balance is positive, the City has accumulated a net surplus in the General\n\nFund; if it is negative, the City has accumulated a net deficit in the General Fund.\n\nIt is important to note that, if the City has accumulated a surplus in the General\n\nFund, the fund balance is not an actual repository where the assets constituting that\n\naccumulated surplus can be found, but rather it is simply an accounting of those\n\nassets across the General Fund, in whatever form or location they may actually\n\nexist.45\n\n       The budget‘s balance sheets further break down the General Fund‘s fund\n\nbalance into the following subcategories:\n\n       Non-spendable – Amounts that cannot be spent either because they\n       are in a non-spendable form or because they are legally or\n       contractually required to be maintained intact.\n\n43\n   See, e.g., R. 675.\n44\n   E.g., R. 675. The City labels the difference between fund assets and liabilities as ―fund\nbalance‖ on its financial statements for all funds designated as ―government funds,‖ including\nthe General Fund and the Special Funds. R. 675; see also R. 649. For funds designated as\n―proprietary funds‖ or ―fiduciary funds,‖ such as the Water/Sewer Fund, the City labels the\ndifference between fund assets and liabilities as ―net assets‖ on its financial statements. R. 676.\nInformation regarding fund balance or net assets pertains only to the specific fund in which it is\nreported, not the City‘s finances as a whole.\n45\n   See, e.g., R. 928, 965–67. For example, the General Fund‘s fund balance may account both\nfor cash assets that the City has invested in a specific CD as well as certain of the City‘s\nreceivables that exist only as claims for payments.\n\n                                                13\n\f       Restricted – Amounts that can be spent only for specific purposes\n       because of the City Charter, City Code, State or federal laws, or\n       externally imposed conditions by grantors or creditors.\n\n       Committed – Amounts that can be used only for specific purposed\n       [sic] determined by a formal action by City Council ordinance or\n       resolution. This includes the Budget Reserve Account.46\n\n       Assigned – Amounts that are allocated for a future use by the Mayor,\n       but are not spendable until a budget ordinance appropriating the\n       amounts is passed by City Council.\n\n       Unassigned – All amounts not included in other spendable\n       classifications.47\n\nLike the fund balance, each of these subcategories represents a mathematical\n\ncalculation—each tracks a specific portion of the net assets in the General Fund\n\nbased on the nature of the restrictions placed on the City‘s ability to utilize the\n\nassets.48 Thus, also like the fund balance, none of the subcategories represent an\n\nactual repository where the certain ―type‖ of asset in that subcategory can be\n\n\n46\n   The City is required to maintain a ―Budget Reserve Account‖ within the General Fund equal to\n10% of the upcoming year‘s General Fund budget. Wilm C. §§ 2-376, 2-377; see also R. 955.\nThe money in the Budget Reserve Account may only be used for ―adverse economic conditions\nor public emergency and when declared by council by ordinance enacted by a two-thirds vote\n(nine) of the city council, following certification by the mayor of such economic conditions or\npublic emergency,‖ and the money must be replenished from year to year. Wilm. C. §§ 2-376, 2-\n377; see also R. 955–56. However, in 2009, the City passed an ordinance allowing the City\ntreasurer to use the money in the Budget Reserve Account to pay the City‘s employee payroll,\ndebt service, and accounts payable in FY 2009, and requiring the treasurer to fully replenish the\nmoney in the Budget Reserve Account by the following October; the City renewed that\nordinance for FY 2010, FY 2012, FY 2013, and FY 2014. See Wilm. C. § 2-379. On May 15,\n2015, the City again renewed the ordinance for FY 2015. See Wilm. Ordinance 15-017, § 1\n(May 15, 2015).\n47\n   R. 675.\n48\n   See R. 927–28.\n\n                                               14\n\ffound, but instead each is an accounting of all the net assets of that ―type‖ that\n\nexist in whatever form across the General Fund.\n\n                     d. The Unassigned Fund Balance\n\n       The General Fund‘s unassigned fund balance (the ―Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance‖) accounts for those net assets within the General Fund that are not subject\n\nto any of the limitations found in the other subcategories. Typically, the General\n\nFund‘s ―unassigned‖ net assets include—but are not all—cash and cash\n\nequivalents, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and CDs.49                 In the\n\narbitration proceedings, the Director of the OMB, Robert Greco, explained the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance in these general terms:\n\n       [I]n other words, just like a business or even for yourself as a person\n       you have what is called net worth. And what [the City does] at the\n       end of the fiscal year[,] the City looks and says, Here [are] our assets,\n       subtract out [our] liabilities, and then also subtract out any reserve\n       accounts like the budget reserve or reserve for encumbrances.\n           The value left, that dollar amount, is called unassigned fund\n       balance. It‘s not all cash and it‘s not a fund sitting there called\n       unassigned fund balance, it just has cash. It is, again, a mathematical\n       calculation that changes month-to-month, year-to-year.50\n\n       Greco testified that the Unassigned Fund Balance generally ebbs and flows\n\nwith the General Fund‘s net operating deficits and surpluses. If there is a net\n\noperating surplus in the General Fund in any given fiscal year, the incoming assets\n\n\n49\n   R. 967–69. For the sake of simplicity, for the remainder of this Memorandum Opinion I will\nrefer to cash and cash equivalents together using the shorthand ―cash assets.‖\n50\n   R. 928–29; see also R. 966–69.\n\n                                             15\n\ffrom that surplus are likely to be spendable, unrestricted, uncommitted, and\n\nunassigned, and thus their value will ―flow,‖ conceptually, to the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance, causing it to grow from the previous year.51 Conversely, if there is a net\n\noperating deficit within the General Fund in any given fiscal year, and the City has\n\nappropriated prior years‘ accumulated surplus to finance the deficit expenditures,\n\nthe outgoing surplus assets may be assets that were previously categorized as\n\n―unassigned,‖ causing the Unassigned Fund Balance to shrink.52 Greco explained\n\nthat this scenario is especially likely to play out in situations where the Council is\n\nmodifying the budget during the fiscal year to add appropriations for expenditures\n\nthat require quick payment; Greco explained that in this scenario, if the City lacks\n\nthe actual revenues, the Council is likely to finance the expenditures using\n\nunassigned net assets from the General Fund, specifically, cash assets:\n\n           Where [the City] find[s] that money[,] in this case the money went\n       out the door, so, it was actually working capital, cash that is on hand\n       that the treasurer‘s office uses, he has money invested in CD‘s and\n       other things, a checking account. So, at the end of the year all else\n       being equal if [the City] overspend[s] . . . [it] ha[s] revenues and [it]\n       ha[s] more expenses than revenues, that unassigned fund balance is\n       going to go down; but, again, it‘s a calculation, it‘s not a true fund that\n       sits there just with cash. The treasurer‘s office actually has to go to an\n       asset account, cash account or CD, liquidate that to pay for these\n       kind[s] of things.53\n51\n   See R. 929 (―Now, if you do have more revenues than expenditures, those will flow into that\ncalculation and, obviously, if it doesn‘t get put anywhere else or [the City‘s] liabilities don‘t\nincrease or expenses [increase], it will increase [the City‘s] unassigned fund balance.‖).\n52\n   See, e.g., R. 929–30; 965–66.\n53\n   R. 929–30; see also R. 968 (―And, again, I can‘t state this more clearly than this. The [M]ayor\nis asking [the Council] to deficit spend, he is not allowed to do that on his own. He is asking [the\n\n                                                16\n\fAccording to Greco, if the City was forced to accept the FOP‘s LBFO, this is also\n\nthe most likely scenario as to how the City would meet the costs of that proposal.54\n\n              2. The City‘s Financial Condition\n\n       The parties have stipulated that the City‘s budgets over the four years\n\ncovered by the FOP‘s LBFO generated the following net operating surpluses and\n\ndeficits in the General Fund: a net operating surplus of $6,055,527 in FY 2011; a\n\nnet operating surplus of $7,444,088 in FY 2012; a net operating surplus of\n\n$1,326,984 in FY 2013; and a net operating deficit of $1,170,833 in FY 2014.55\n\nAdditionally, the parties have stipulated that the City is projected to generate a net\n\noperating surplus of $1,400,905 in the General Fund for FY 2015, and a net\n\noperating deficit of $333,508 in the General Fund for FY 2016.56\n\n       The Unassigned Fund Balance existing at the end of FY 2012 was\n\n$21,964,373.57 In the City‘s budget for FY 2014, the City estimated that the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance had grown to $25,917,354 by the end of FY 2013, and\n\nCouncil] to deficit spend and what [it is] doing is [it is] using assets on hand. Somewhere,\nsomehow some assets have to be liquidated, a CD, money has to be taken out of a checking\naccount. . . . [T]here is not this unassigned fund balance sitting alone and has cash in it. It\nalways comes from the assets. Again, this calculation gives you a value of your unassigned fund\nbalance. It is not in and of itself an actual savings account.‖).\n54\n    See R. 946 (―That money [for the FOP‘s proposal] would come out of either reserves,\nunassigned fund balance, cash. We would then have to go back to [the Council]. [It] would\nmake an appropriation. So you would actually see an increase in the fiscal year whenever it was\npaid. If it was paid this year, we would have to increase the budget in 14 and then [the City\ntreasurer] would have to cash out a CD and pay out those increases.‖).\n55\n   Stipulation (Mar. 16, 2015).\n56\n   Id.\n57\n   R. 675; see also R. 999–1000.\n\n                                              17\n\fprojected that the Unassigned Fund Balance would grow to approximately\n\n$28,520,703 by the end of FY 2014.58 As of April 2014, cash assets accounted for\n\n$5,699,343 of the Unassigned Fund Balance.59\n\n       E. The Arbitration Decision\n\n       The Arbitrator held a two-day hearing on May 6–7, 2015, after which, on or\n\nabout September 8, 2014, she issued her decision60 that ―the last, best, final offer of\n\nFOP Lodge 1 is . . . the more reasonable [proposal] based upon the statutory\n\ncriteria set forth in 19 Del C. § 1615.‖61 In reaching that decision, the Arbitrator\n\nfirst determined that ―[t]he record does not support the conclusion that the City has\n\nan inability to afford the limited costs of the FOP offer.‖62 The parties agree that,\n\nby this language, the Arbitrator was attempting to address subsection (d)(6) and its\n\nrequirement that the LBFO selected must be payable from ―existing revenues;‖\n\nthey disagree, however, as to whether she properly analyzed that factor. Although\n\nthe Arbitrator‘s decision covers each of the Section 1615(d) factors, only its\n\n\n\n\n58\n   R. 675; see also R. 1000–01. Greco explained that the estimated growth in the unassigned\nfund balance in FY 2013 and the projected growth in the unassigned fund balance in FY 2014\nwas partially due to certain ―non-spendable‖ net assets in the General Fund being reclassified as\n―unassigned.‖ See R. 1000–01.\n59\n   R. 177; see also R. 1003–04.\n60\n   In conducting my review of the PERB‘s decision, I find it necessary to also review the\nArbitrator‘s decision. In doing so, I find I agree with the Arbitrator on some issues and depart on\nothers. Notwithstanding the latter, her decision overall is thoughtful, tightly reasoned, and well-\nwritten, a truth to which the brief excerpts of that decision cited herein do scant justice.\n61\n   R. 1386.\n62\n   R. 1386 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                18\n\fanalysis as to this latter issue under subsection (d)(6) is relevant to this\n\nMemorandum Opinion.\n\n       In the arbitration, the City argued that it ―does not have the financial ability,\n\nbased on existing revenues, to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO.‖63 As support,\n\nthe City argued that, at the time of the hearing, it was projecting a structural deficit\n\nthrough FY 2018 due to ―spiraling costs,‖ such as funding pension plans.64 In\n\naddition, the City argued that the potential sources of funds identified by the FOP\n\nto finance its LBFO, including the Unassigned Fund Balance, do not qualify as\n\n―existing revenues‖ as required by subsection (d)(6).65              Specifically, the City\n\nargued that the Unassigned Fund Balance is a reserve,66 which, according to the\n\nPERB‘s and this Court‘s precedent, does not constitute revenue.67\n\n       The Arbitrator rejected both of the City‘s positions. First, she determined\n\nthat ―[t]he evidence does not establish the ‗structural deficit‘ asserted by the\n\nCity.‖68 Rather, she found that the City‘s projected deficits due in large part to\n\nfunding pension plans are ―commonly understood to be cyclical, rather than\n\nstructural, deficits because they occur as a result of downturns in the economy,‖ as\n\n\n\n\n63\n   R. 1311.\n64\n   See R. 1311–12.\n65\n   See R. 1313–15.\n66\n   R. 1314–15.\n67\n   See, e.g., FOP Lodge 5 v. New Castle Cnty., 2014 WL 351009, at *5 (Del. Ch. Jan. 29, 2014).\n68\n   R. 1364.\n\n                                              19\n\fopposed to ―large and persistent imbalances in expenditures to revenues.‖ 69 In\n\nactuality, the Arbitrator found, the City had ―been effective in addressing the\n\nprojected revenue declines and expense increases in a proactive manner, by\n\nincreasing property taxes, implementing budget cuts, and restructuring debt\n\nservice, as evidenced by the surpluses in FY 2011–2013, and a projected surplus\n\nfor FY 2015.‖70\n\n       Next, the Arbitrator determined that the Unassigned Fund Balance does not\n\nconstitute a reserve.71 In reaching that conclusion, she relied on a 2002 POFERA\n\narbitration decision, City of Seaford v. Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 9,72\n\nwherein the arbitrator defined ―reserves‖ as those assets whose utilization is within\n\nthe exclusive authority of the Council and which are assigned to reserve status by\n\nan affirmative act of the Council.73 After briefly examining the nature of the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance, the Arbitrator concluded that it ―does not constitute a\n\nreserve because assets are not ‗allocated‘ to this fund by an affirmative act of the\n\nCouncil, nor are there restrictions upon its use.‖74 Further, she noted that the\n\n―Council has allocated moneys from [the] [U]nassigned [F]und [B]alance to\n\n\n69\n   R. 1365.\n70\n   R. 1365.\n71\n   R. 1368.\n72\n   IV PERB 2659 (July 15, 2002) (Decision of the Interest Arbitrator on Remand). The City of\nSeaford was adopted by this Court in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 v. New Castle Cnty.,\n2014 WL 351009 (Del. Ch. Jan. 29, 2014).\n73\n   See R. 1368 (quoting City of Seaford, IV PERB at 2675).\n74\n   R. 1368.\n\n                                            20\n\fadjusted projected budgets to conform to actual revenues and expenditures in the\n\nsame manner that all funds are allocated each fiscal year.‖75\n\n       Finally, the Arbitrator evaluated the projections offered by both parties for\n\nthe total cost of the FOP‘s LBFO, finding that ―[t]he City‘s estimate of $127,648\n\nfor FY 2011 through FY 2014 (backing out the estimated cost for FY 2015 of\n\n$57,010) . . . [is] closer to accurate.‖76 She rejected as ―purely speculative‖ the\n\nCity‘s argument that the Bargaining Unit members‘ increased salaries under the\n\nFOP‘s proposal would irreversibly carry over into FY 2015 and perhaps beyond,\n\nreasoning that the POFERA collective bargaining process could lead to retroactive\n\nreductions in the Bargaining Unit members‘ salaries for the fiscal years following\n\nthe effective term of the FOP‘s proposal:\n\n       Should the FOP prevail in this matter, the parties would be required to\n       enter into negotiations for a successor agreement to be effective on\n       July 1, 2014. If the City is able to establish that its fiscal situation has\n       deteriorated, the next agreement could include cost savings and/or a\n       change in either the structure or amounts of [salary] step increases for\n       this bargaining unit.77\n\n75\n   R. 1368.\n76\n   R. 1369.\n77\n   R. 1370. The arbitrator also chastised the parties for allowing so much time to pass without a\nCBA in place and encouraged them to immediately begin negotiations on a successor agreement\nto begin in FY 2015. See R. 1386 (―The extended period of time which has elapsed since the\nexpiration of the last agreement is not reasonable and is contrary to the purposes of the POFERA\nand the interests and welfare of the public in the efficient and effective operation of the\ngovernment. This decision will require the parties to initiate successor negotiations immediately.\nThey are encouraged to enter into those negotiations with full and complete awareness of the\nCity‘s financial projections as well as the recent and continuing fiscal concerns. The parties are\nfurther encouraged to actively engage in these negotiations quickly and expeditiously rather than\nallowing them to drag on to the detriment of their relationship and their capacity to move\n\n                                               21\n\fAs proof that ―[t]he City‘s presumption that all [salary] step increases are\n\nimmutable into the future is overly simplistic and not persuasive,‖ the Arbitrator\n\nalluded to a 2012 POFERA arbitration decision wherein the arbitrator reduced\n\nsalaries for certain New Castle County police officers.78 Lastly, the Arbitrator\n\nnoted that City had failed to dispute the FOP‘s argument that the City would\n\nrealize salary savings of approximately $107,606 in FY 2014 due to the City\n\nappropriating money to cover the salaries for two vacant positions—the Chief of\n\nPolice and one Inspector.79\n\n       After reaching these findings of law and fact, the Arbitrator ruled that ―[f]or\n\nall these reasons, I conclude that the City has not established that it has either a\n\nstructural deficit or an inability to afford the costs of the FOP‘s last, best, final\n\noffer.‖80\n\n       F. The PERB Decision\n\n       On September 15, 2014, the City filed its Request for Review of the\n\nArbitrator‘s Decision with the PERB, arguing that the Arbitrator committed three\n\nlegal errors in her decision: (1) the Arbitrator failed to apply the statutory standard\n\nto evaluate the City‘s inability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO by assessing\n\n\nforward to proactively and cooperatively address the public safety challenges facing the City and\nits residents.‖).\n78\n   R. 1370–71.\n79\n   R. 1371.\n80\n   R. 1371.\n\n                                               22\n\fthe City‘s ―ability to afford‖ the FOP‘s LBFO rather than the City‘s financial\n\nability to meet the costs based on existing revenues; (2) the Arbitrator improperly\n\nfound that the Unassigned Fund Balance constitutes ―existing revenue;‖ and (3) the\n\nArbitrator erred by not considering the continuing nature of the salary increases in\n\nthe FOP‘s LBFO beyond FY 2014.81 The PERB convened a public hearing on\n\nOctober 9, 2014, at which time the PERB met in public session to consider the\n\nmerits of the City‘s appeal and to hear oral arguments by the parties.82\n\n       On October 23, 2014, the PERB issued a written decision unanimously\n\naffirming the arbitration decision.83 First, the PERB found that the Arbitrator had\n\nproperly focused on whether there were existing revenues to meet the costs of the\n\nFOP‘s proposal, as evidenced by her analysis as to whether the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance was a reserve under City of Seaford.84 Second, the PERB found that the\n\nArbitrator had correctly applied City of Seaford to find that the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance is not a reserve, and thus ―is not excluded as ‗existing revenues.‘‖ 85 The\n\nPERB also rejected a new argument the City raised on appeal86 that, even if the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance is not a reserve, it still does not constitute ―existing\n\n81\n   See R. 1388–89.\n82\n   R. 1428.\n83\n   R. 1429.\n84\n   See R. 1429–30.\n85\n   See 1429–31.\n86\n    Compare R. 1319–20 (arguing, in post-hearing briefing in the arbitration, only that the\nUnassigned Fund Balance is a reserve), and R. 1349 (same), with R. 1389 (arguing, in the appeal\nto the PERB, that ―even if the Arbitrator is correct in concluding that the [U]nassiged [F]und\n[B]alance does not constitute a reserve, the fact remains that it does not constitute revenue‖).\n\n                                              23\n\frevenues‖ because it is not a stream of revenue ―flowing into the City‘s coffers,‖\n\nfinding that ―[t]he City conflate[d] ‗current revenues‘ with ‗existing revenues‘‖:\n\n         [The City] asserts the decision in Seaford requires a current stream of\n         revenue to meet the additional costs of the last, best, final offer. The\n         statute, however, focuses on the public employer‘s ‗existing\n         revenues.‘ We construe that to mean that the analysis must focus on\n         the City‘s financial landscape based on the sources of revenue it had\n         at the time the analysis is undertaken without regard to its ability to\n         raise additional revenue through taxation or other means. Nothing in\n         the statute requires that the consideration of revenues be limited to the\n         current fiscal year or to any other specific, limited period of time. The\n         logical extension of the City‘s argument would result in the preclusion\n         of any wage increase unless the City offered it.87\n\nFinally, the PERB rejected the City‘s argument that the projected total cost of the\n\nFOP‘s LBFO should include salary increases in FY 2015, reasoning, like the\n\nArbitrator, that the City ―is not prohibited (and is in fact encouraged) to engage in\n\nnegotiations which may modify wages and/or allow for savings in other areas\n\nwhich are necessary to fund or to continue to fund negotiated wage rates.‖88\n\n         G. Procedural History\n\n         On November 7, 2014, the City appealed the PERB decision to this Court.\n\nThe grounds for appeal stated in the City‘s Notice of Appeal were that: (1) the\n\nPERB erred as a matter of law; (2) the PERB erred as a matter of fact; (3) the\n\nPERB acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner; and (4) the PERB‘s decisions\n\n\n\n87\n     R.1430.\n88\n     R. 1431.\n\n                                            24\n\fare not supported by substantial evidence. The issues that the City has presented to\n\nme, however, are purely legal.\n\n       On November 14, 2014, the City notified the PERB of its compliance with\n\nthe PERB decision, including that the City had distributed retroactive salary\n\npayments to the Bargaining Unit members in accordance with the FOP‘s LBFO.89\n\n       I heard oral argument on the City‘s appeal on March 11, 2015.90 Following\n\nargument, I issued a brief letter to the parties informing them that I was still\n\nunclear as to how the term ―existing revenues‖ in 19 Del. C. § 1615(d)(6) was\n\nsupposed to apply in the context of arbitrating retrospective CBAs, and offering\n\nthem the opportunity to submit supplemental briefing on this narrow issue of\n\nstatutory interpretation. Those additional memoranda were fully submitted by\n\nMarch 25, 2015.\n\n       H. The Parties’ Contentions\n\n       The City challenges three aspects of the Arbitrator‘s, and thus also the\n\nPERB‘s, decision:\n\n          First, the decisions disregard the statutory standard (―The financial\n       ability of the public employer, based on existing revenues, to meet the\n       costs of any proposed settlement‖), and substitute the standard of\n       ―inability to afford the costs of the FOP‘s last, best, final offer.‖\n       Second, the decisions incorrectly determine [that] the cash assets in\n89\n  See R. 1433–34.\n90\n  At the conclusion of oral argument, I asked the parties to submit a stipulation as to the City‘s\nGeneral Fund net operating surpluses or deficits for FY 2011 to FY 2014 and projected net\noperating surpluses or deficits for FY 2015 and FY 2016. The parties submitted that stipulation\non March 16, 2015.\n\n                                               25\n\f          the Unassigned Fund Balance are existing revenues. Third, the\n          decisions refuse to acknowledge that the salary increases in the FOP‘s\n          proposal are recurring, and will persist in [FY 2015], and in all\n          likelihood beyond [FY 2015].91\n\n          Should this Court rule in its favor, the City contends that the record is\n\nsufficient to demonstrate that it is unable to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO,\n\nand, since this factor is dispositive under Section 1615(d), that the Court must\n\nreverse the Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s decisions and implement the City‘s LBFO\n\nin its entirety. The FOP responds that both the Arbitrator and the PERB correctly\n\napplied the provisions of the POFERA, and that the Court should affirm their\n\nrespective decisions.\n\n                 1. ―Ability to Afford‖ Standard versus the Statutory Standard\n\n          The City argues that, in looking to whether the City could meet the costs of\n\nthe FOP‘s LBFO, both the Arbitrator and the PERB mischaracterized assets in the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance as existing revenues, causing them both to decide the\n\nissue according to a standard of whether the City could ―afford‖ the costs based on\n\ncash on hand, rather than the statutory standard required by Section 1615(d)(6).92\n\n          The FOP counters that both the Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s analysis on the\n\nCity‘s financial ability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO was based on existing\n\n\n\n\n91\n     See City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of Its Appeal at 10–11 (citations omitted).\n92\n     See, e.g., id. at 11–13.\n\n                                                 26\n\frevenues.93 Essentially, the FOP argues that any reference to the City‘s ability to\n\n―afford‖ the proposal was merely shorthand for the statutory standard.\n\n      As the parties‘ arguments indicate, the resolution of this issue is, at least\n\npotentially, dependent upon resolution of whether the assets accounted for in the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance are statutory ―existing revenues.‖ In other words, if I\n\nfind that the Arbitrator and the PERB gauged the City‘s financial ability to meet\n\nthe costs of the FOP‘s proposal based on the Unassigned Fund Balance, the\n\nquestion of whether that was an improper standard will depend on whether the\n\nterm ―existing revenues‖ applies to the Unassigned Fund Balance. If I find that the\n\nArbitrator and the PERB did not apply the proper statutory standard, I must still\n\nconsider whether those legal errors were material to the outcome of the decisions.\n\n             2. The Unassigned Fund Balance as ―Existing Revenues‖\n\n      The City renews both its arguments from the PERB proceedings regarding\n\nthe categorization of the Unassigned Fund Balance, arguing that the Unassigned\n\nFund Balance is a reserve—and thus categorically prohibited from being\n\nconsidered as existing revenues—and that, even if it is not a reserve, the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance does not include existing revenues.94 As to its first\n\nargument, the City contends that the Unassigned Fund Balance meets the City of\n\n\n93\n   Answering Br. of Appellee-Below Appellee Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 1 at 25–30. But\nsee notes 102–108 and accompanying text.\n94\n   See City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of Its Appeal at 14–18.\n\n                                            27\n\fSeaford criteria for a reserve, in that annual operating surpluses are, ―by operation\n\nof law, set aside‖ into the Unassigned Fund Balance and that use of those assets\n\nrequires the approval of Council.95 As to its second argument, the City contends\n\nthat the Unassigned Fund Balance does not meet the City of Seaford criteria for\n\nexisting revenues, in that prior years‘ accumulated surplus is not ―dynamic in\n\ncharacter,‖ does not ―constitute[] a flow of moneys‖ into the City‘s coffers, and is\n\nnot an ―existing, stable and continuing source[] of revenue.‖96 Rather, according to\n\nthe City, these qualifiers illustrate that ―existing revenues‖ must be interpreted to\n\nmean projected or actual revenues sufficient to meet the costs of the proposal in the\n\nyear or years that those costs are to be incurred by the City if the proposal is\n\nadopted.97 Here, because ―the City was ordered to pay salary increases in a fiscal\n\nyear ([FY 2014]) when there was a deficit, . . . [there are] no existing revenues to\n\npay the salary increases.‖98\n\n       Additionally, in its supplemental briefing, the City raises for the first time\n\nthe argument that ―applying the ability to pay based upon existing revenues criteria\n\nretroactively is unworkable.‖99 The City argues that the term ―existing revenues‖\n\ninherently means projected revenues at the time of the arbitration and is\n\n95\n   Id. at 14–15.\n96\n   Id. at 15 (quoting Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 v.

In that brief, the FOP avers that the\n\nGeneral Assembly intended the phrase ―based on existing revenues‖ to mean that\n\nan arbitration decision ―cannot mandate an increase or imposition of new taxes,\n\n\n\n103\n    Answering Br. of Appellee-Below Appellee Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 1 at 32.\n104\n    Id. at 33.\n105\n    See 19 Del.

C. §§ 1301, 1302(o), 1306.\n106\n    Answering Br. of Appellee-Below Appellee Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 1 at 35.

Recurring Costs of the FOP‘s LBFO\n\n          The City argues that, in determining the ―costs of any proposed settlements‖\n\nas required by Section 1615(d)(6), the Arbitrator and the PERB should have\n\nincluded costs for fiscal years following the effective term of the FOP‘s LBFO, at\n\nthe very least for FY 2015. According to the City, although the FOP‘s proposed\n\nCBA expires in FY 2014, the salary increase it contains will actually carry over\n\ninto FY 2015 because the parties already have such a late start on negotiating a\n\nsuccessor CBA, and therefore the Arbitrator and the PERB were obligated to\n\ninclude FY 2015 costs in the total cost of the FOP‘s proposal.109                 The City\n\ncontends that the Arbitrator‘s characterization of the its projected FY 2015 costs as\n\n―purely speculative,‖ ―overly simplistic,‖ and ―not persuasive‖ ignores the realities\n\nthat arbitration decision was issued two months after—and the PERB decision four\n\n107\n      Supplemental Mem. of Appellee-Below, Appellee Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #1 at 12–\n13.\n108\n      Id. at 13 (emphasis added).\n109\n      See City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of Its Appeal at 18–20.\n\n                                                31\n\fmonths after—the expiration of the term of the FOP‘s proposal; that the ―law\n\nrequires that any step increases be maintained pending the negotiation of a\n\nsuccessor agreement;‖ that the ―FOP almost certainly will not agree to roll back the\n\nincreases;‖ that ―[i]n the absence of agreement to roll back the increases, it\n\nnormally takes at least several months to negotiate an impasse;‖ that the ―parties\n\nmust then go through mediation;‖ and that it took in this case ―over 8 months from\n\nthe initiation of binding interest arbitration to get a decision.‖110\n\n       The FOP does not directly address in briefing the issue of whether salary\n\ncosts for FY 2015 must be included in the total costs of the FOP‘s LBFO. Instead,\n\nit argues that, in any event, ―the Arbitrator clearly considered the $57,010\n\nestimated costs for FY 2015 in light of the more than $5 million cash in the\n\nUnassigned Fund [Balance] and the projected operating surplus of $1,125,905 for\n\nFY 2015.‖111\n\n                            II.

ANALYSIS\n\n       The scope of this appeal is narrowly focused. In it, the Court is asked to\n\ninterpret various provisions within 19 Del. C. § 1615(d)(6) and to determine, in\n\nlight of the statute‘s meaning, whether the Arbitrator, and thus the PERB, properly\n\nadministered the law in resolving the parties‘ dispute. As explained below, I\n\nreverse the PERB‘s decision in part and affirm it in part.\n\n       A. The Arbitrator and the PERB Erred as a Matter of Law in Ruling that the\n       Cash Assets Accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance Are Existing\n       Revenues\n\n       I turn first to whether the Arbitrator and the PERB mischaracterized the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance as ―existing revenues,‖ as that term is used in Section\n\n1615(d)(6). As a preliminary matter, I note that the scope of the Arbitrator‘s and\n\n\n120\n    Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009 at *4 (quoting Centaur Partners, IV v.\nNat'l Intergroup, Inc., 582 A.2d 923, 927 (Del. 1990); LeVan v. Independence Mall, Inc., 940\nA.2d 929, 933 (Del. 2007)).\n121\n    E.g., Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009 at * 4 (citing Taylor v. Diamond\nState Port Corp., 14 A.3d 536, 538 (Del. 2011)).\n122\n    Id. (citing Diamond State Port Corp., 14 A.3d at 538)).\n\n                                             34\n\fthe PERB‘s holdings in this regard is unclear. In her decision, the Arbitrator ruled\n\nthat the ―[U]nassigned [F]und [B]alance does not constitute a reserve,‖ but she\n\nnever expressly spoke to whether the Unassigned Fund Balance constitutes existing\n\nrevenues, perhaps interpreting the holding in City of Seaford to create a dichotomy\n\nbetween the two terms, under which all cash assets are either ―reserves‖ or\n\n―existing revenues.‖123      Her ruling is also clearly directed towards the entire\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance, though she does note at the beginning of her analysis\n\nthat the Unassigned Fund Balance is only partly composed of cash assets.124 In\n\naffirming the Arbitrator‘s decision, however, the PERB appears to take the\n\nArbitrator‘s ruling further, portraying the Arbitrator as having implicitly held that\n\nthe cash assets accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance constitute existing\n\nrevenues, and itself endorsing this more specific position.125 In any event, I need\n\nnot consider how to resolve this discrepancy between the decisions, because the\n\nparties have proceeded in this appeal as if both the Arbitrator and the PERB held\n\n\n\n\n123\n    See R. 1368.\n124\n    See R. 1366–67, 1368.\n125\n    See R. 1430 (―The Arbitrator explicitly determined that the Unassigned Fund Balance was not\na reserve; consequently, it is not excluded as ‗existing revenues‘ under Seaford. We Concur.\nThe Arbitrator determined, based on the City‘s evidence, [that] the Unassigned Fund Balance\nconstitutes the account or fund in which the City accumulates its excess revenues and from\nwhich the City draws funds to meet unanticipated or unfunded expenses in its budget. . . . There\nis no question that the Unassigned Fund Balance Balance‘s cash or cash equivalent is comprised\nof funds from existing revenues. It is and has been a stable source of funding.‖).\n\n                                              35\n\fthat cash assets accounted for in the Unassigned Fund Balance constitute existing\n\nrevenues.126 Thus, that is the specific issue I will consider here.\n\n       In order for a binding interest arbitrator to force a public employer to enter\n\ninto any CBA with a police officers‘ or firefighters‘ union, Section 1615(d) of the\n\nPOFERA requires that the public employer have the financial ability to meet the\n\ncosts of the CBA. Section 1615(d)(6) provides that the financial ability of the\n\npublic employer is to be determined solely ―based on [the public employer‘s]\n\nexisting revenues.‖ The FOP argues that the Arbitrator and the PERB correctly\n\ndetermined that, as a matter of law, all of the cash assets accounted for by the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance constitute existing revenues, principally because these\n\nassets are made up of prior years‘ surplus revenues. The City contends that these\n\nrulings constituted legal error because the Unassigned Fund Balance is a reserve\n\nor, in the alternative, because only revenues from the year or years that the costs of\n\nthe proposed CBA are to actually be incurred by the City may constitute existing\n\nrevenues. I do not find either party‘s argument fully persuasive, but I ultimately\n\nagree with the City that the Arbitrator and the PERB erred as a matter of law in\n\n\n\n126\n    See, e.g., City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of its Appeal at 10 (―Second, the\ndecisions incorrectly determine [that] the cash assets in the Unassigned Fund Balance are\nexisting revenues.‖); cf. Answering Br. of Appellee-Below Appellee Fraternal Order of Police\nLodge 1 at 34 (―Accordingly, based upon the evidence presented, the authorities referenced and\nthe rationale applied thereto, FOP #1 submits that the Arbitrator and the [PERB] properly found\nthat cash in the Unassigned Fund Balance represents surplus revenue (not an explicitly-allocated\nprotected reserve).‖).\n\n                                              36\n\fruling that the cash assets accounted for in the Unassigned Fund Balance\n\ncategorically constitute existing revenues.\n\n                 1. Revenues, Reserves, and Existing Revenues\n\n          In conducting my analysis under this issue, I am guided by this Court‘s\n\ndecision in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5. There, the court reviewed a PERB\n\ndecision affirming an arbitrator‘s ruling that New Castle County could not meet the\n\ncosts of a union‘s LBFO. En route to her conclusion, the arbitrator below ruled\n\nthat certain assets held in reserves by the County did not constitute existing\n\nrevenues under Section 1615(d)(6) and, ultimately, that the County did not have\n\nsufficient existing revenues to meet the costs of the union‘s proposal because\n\nbudget forecasts indicated that County would run a deficit in the two fiscal years\n\ncovered by the proposal, FY 2012 and FY 2013.127 In analyzing whether the\n\narbitrator properly applied the statutory standard under Section 1615(d)(6), the\n\ncourt noted that the arbitrator below had relied on the following discussion of\n\nrevenues, reserves, and the statutory term ―existing revenues‖ previously set forth\n\nin the City of Seaford arbitration decision:\n\n              Revenue is dynamic in character. It constitutes a flow of moneys,\n          in this case, into the City[ of Seaford]‘s coffers. Revenues from the\n          electricity, water and sewer enterprise funds consist of net income\n          (operating and non-operating revenues less operating expenses), or\n          ―profits‖ in the vernacular. Included in the non-operating revenues is\n\n\n127\n      See Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009, at *8–10.\n\n                                               37\n\f       ―interest earned‖ which may include interest earned on the investment\n       of reserved funds.\n\n          Reserves, on the other hand, are moneys which have been set\n       aside, saved, or ―reserved.‖ While they may originate from excess\n       revenues and be allocated to reserves in a given year, they do not\n       constitute an active revenue stream. Funds are reserved or allocated\n       to reserves through an affirmative act of the governing body.\n       Likewise, how those reserves are expended, invested, or allocated is\n       also within the exclusive authority of the City‘s governing body.\n\n           The term ―existing revenues‖ limits the Interest Arbitrator to\n       considering revenues, based on existing fee and taxation rates. It is\n       beyond the scope of the Arbitrator‘s authority to consider whether\n       such rates should or could be increased, whether other expenses\n       should or could be decreased or reallocated, and/or whether existing\n       reserves should or could be allocated to fund the proposals. While it\n       is certainly within the authority of the governing body of a public\n       employer to make any of these choices subject to the political will of\n       its citizenry, it is not within the province of the Interest Arbitrator\n       under the [POFERA].128\n\n       After conducting its own review of the POFERA, the Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice, Lodge 5 court concluded that the City of Seaford arbitrator‘s ―discussion of\n\nwhat constitutes ‗existing revenues‘ within the meaning of 19 Del. C. § 1615(d)(6)\n\nis well-reasoned and persuasive,‖ and specifically that the ―arbitrator‘s approach\n\nwas guided by, and consistent with, this Court‘s precedent regarding statutory\n\ninterpretation.‖129 Based on the City of Seaford arbitrator‘s definitions, as well as\n\n\n128\n     Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009 at *6 (quoting City of Seaford v.\nFraternal Order of Police, Lodge 9, IV PERB 2659, 2675–76 (July 15, 2002) (Decision of the\nInterest Arbitrator on Remand)).\n129\n    Id. at *6. Specifically, the court praised the City of Seaford arbitrator‘s decision to give words\nof common usage in a statute their ―usual, ordinary and natural meaning‖ where the statute‘s\nlanguage is clear. See id. at *6 n.31 (pointing to the arbitrator‘s citation of and reliance on\n\n                                                 38\n\fits independent analysis of the POFERA, the court adopted the City of Seaford\n\narbitrator‘s conclusion that, ―based on the plain meaning of the word ‗revenues,‘\n\nthe POFERA excludes unambiguously a public employer‘s financial reserves from\n\nconsideration in an analysis under Section 1615(d)(6).‖130               Further, the court\n\naffirmed the arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s decisions that the County could not meet\n\nthe costs of the union‘s LBFO based on existing revenues, concluding that it was\n\nappropriate for the arbitrator in its analysis under Section 1615(d)(6) to focus on\n\nthe County‘s revenues in the fiscal years covered by the LBFO, and specifying that\n\nthe proper inquiry is whether those years‘ revenues are sufficient in the aggregate\n\nto meet the costs of that LBFO, i.e., whether there are sufficient revenues over the\n\nentire term of the LBFO to meet the total costs of the LBFO, as opposed to\n\nsufficient revenues in each individual year of the LBFO to meet the respective\n\ncosts in each individual year of the LBFO:\n\n          Even assuming that the FOP 5 is correct that no reasonable\n       arbitrator could have concluded that the County was unable to afford\n       FOP 5‘s proposal for the 2012 fiscal year, there is no evidence that the\n       County could have paid for the proposal in fiscal year 2013. Each\n\nHaddock v. Bd. of Pub. Educ. in Wilm., 84 A.2d 157, 161 (Del. Ch. 1951) and Seaford Bd. of\nEduc. v. Seaford Sch. Dist., 1988 WL 8773, at *2 (Del. Ch. Feb. 5, 1988)); see also City of\nSeaford, IV PERB at 2673. As noted by the court, the arbitrator relied on the dictionary\ndefinitions of ―revenues‖ as meaning ―the yield of income that a political unit collects and\nreceives into the treasury for public use,‖ and of ―income‖ as meaning ―a gain or recurrent\nbenefit, usually measured in money that derives from capital or labor; also, the amount of such\ngain received in a period of time.‖ Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009 at *5\nn.28; see also City of Seaford, IV PERB at 2674 (quoting Merriam Webster’s Collegiate\nDictionary 558, 1002 (10th Ed. 1996)).\n130\n    Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009 at *6.\n\n                                              39\n\f          party submitted a two-year proposal to the Arbitrator. Therefore, the\n          relevant inquiry was whether the County could afford FOP 5‘s\n          proposal throughout its entire two-year duration. The County\n          submitted unchallenged evidence that it was projecting a $5.1 million\n          deficit in the 2013 fiscal year if FOP 5 accepted the 2.5% concession\n          and a $5.7 million deficit if it did not. An actual deficit of even half\n          that amount would have exceeded the County‘s projected 2012 budget\n          surplus. Because a reasonable arbitrator could have found the\n          County‘s budget forecasts credible, it follows that the record before\n          the Arbitrator and the PERB contained evidence sufficient to support\n          a reasonable determination that the County could not afford to pay for\n          the FOP 5‘s proposal over the entirety of its two-year duration.131\n\n                    2. The Unassigned Fund Balance Is Not a Reserve\n\n          Based on the bright-line rule set forth in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5,\n\nthe City argues that the assets accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance meet\n\nthe City of Seaford‘s criteria for reserves and thus categorically cannot be\n\nconsidered existing revenues. That argument, however, is without merit.\n\n          As made clear by the Director of the OMB, Robert Greco, in the arbitration\n\nproceedings, the Unassigned Fund Balance is not a specific account or set of\n\naccounts wherein assets are held, but rather it is an accounting function that tallies\n\nnet assets of a certain classification across the General Fund. The City Council\n\ndoes not and cannot set aside, save, or reserve assets in the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance through an affirmative act, because the Unassigned Fund Balance is just a\n\nnumerical value that exists only on the City‘s financial statements. It is not even a\n\nvalue that accounts for assets in the General Fund that the City Council has set\n\n131\n      Id. at *10.\n\n                                             40\n\faside, saved, or reserved through an affirmative act; rather, the specific parameters\n\nof the Unassigned Fund Balance exclude such assets from being included in its\n\nvalue. Put simply, the Unassigned Fund Balance is no more than a tally of net\n\nassets in the General Fund not allocated to be spent or placed in a reserve.\n\nTherefore, I do not find that the Unassigned Fund Balance is itself a reserve, nor\n\ncan any of the assets for which it accounts be considered reserves.\n\n             3. The Cash Assets Included in the Unassigned Fund Balance Are Not\n             ―Existing Revenues‖\n\n      Just because the cash assets included in the Unassigned Fund Balance are\n\nnot reserves, however, does not necessarily mean that they are ―existing revenues.‖\n\nNeither Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 nor City of Seaford imposes a rule that\n\na specific asset must either be a reserve or existing revenue, only that any reserved\n\nasset cannot be considered existing revenue.           Thus, it is appropriate to\n\nindependently consider whether the cash assets included in the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance are ―existing revenues.‖\n\n      The FOP initially argued, consistent with the rulings of the Arbitrator and\n\nthe PERB, that the cash assets included in the Unassigned Fund Balance are\n\n―existing revenues‖ because the source of the Unassigned Fund Balance is\n\nrevenues; it points out that the Unassigned Fund Balance is merely the\n\naccumulation of prior years‘ surplus revenues. This surely is true, but it also\n\nhighlights the problem with the Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s‘ reasoning.\n\n\n                                         41\n\f―Revenue‖ inherently involves a temporal aspect: It is the amount of money an\n\nentity receives over a specific period of time.132 This is what is meant by the\n\narbitrator‘s observation in City of Seaford that ―[r]evenue is dynamic in character‖\n\nand that ―[i]t constitutes a flow of moneys, in this case, into the City[of Seaford‘s]\n\ncoffers.‖133 The magnitude of that movement cannot be calculated in a vacuum;\n\nthere must be a definitive beginning and ending point for the calculation. Hence,\n\nthe Arbitrator and the PERB are correct that the cash assets in the Unassigned\n\nFund Balance originated as revenues during certain periods of time in the past, but\n\nthey are incorrect to say that those assets are categorically revenues in the\n\npresent.134\n\n       The modifier ―existing‖ does not change this ordinary, temporal meaning of\n\nrevenues such that ―existing revenues‖ becomes a static concept. As the arbitrator\n\nin City of Seaford illuminated, and as the FOP acknowledges in its supplemental\n\nbriefing, the modifier ―existing‖ merely limits the scope of potential revenues that\n\n\n132\n    See id. at *5 & n.28 (noting that the arbitrator in City of Seaford relied on the dictionary\ndefinitions of ―revenues‖ as ―the yield of income that a political unit collects and receives into\nthe treasury for public use,‖ and ―income‖ as ―a gain or recurrent benefit, usually measured in\nmoney that derives from capital or labor; also, the amount of such gain received in a period of\ntime‖); see also City of Seaford, IV PERB at 2674 (quoting Merriam Webster’s Collegiate\nDictionary 558, 1002 (10th Ed. 1996)).\n133\n    Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009 at *6.\n134\n    This distinction is further highlighted by basic principles of accounting. An entity records its\nrevenues in an income statement, which tracks profitability of the entity over a specified period\nof time, based on the entity‘s revenues and expenditures over that period. The entity‘s balance\nsheet—wherein the Unassigned Fund Balance is found—does not record revenues; rather, it\nprovides a snapshot of the entity‘s financial position at a specific point in time, based on the\nentity‘s assets and liabilities at that moment.\n\n                                                42\n\fthe arbitrator may consider in gauging the City‘s financial ability to meet the costs\n\nof any proposal.135         Specifically, the term ―existing revenues‖ confines the\n\narbitrator‘s analysis to revenues that are ―based on existing fee and taxation rates‖\n\nas a means to prevent the arbitrator from overriding the Council‘s legislative\n\nauthority to raise, appropriate, and set aside funds.136 It ensures, in other words,\n\nthat the arbitrator does not usurp this core legislative function; it requires that the\n\narbitrator take into account the information available at the time of the arbitration\n\nand, based on that information, consider only those revenues that have already\n\nbeen ordained by the City. In looking at that snapshot of information, however, the\n\narbitrator cannot identify any particular revenues without first narrowing her\n\nsearch to a specific period of time, the time to be covered by the LBFO. In other\n\n\n135\n    See id. (―The term ‗existing revenues‘ limits the Interest Arbitrator to considering revenues,\nbased on existing fee and taxation rates.‖ (emphasis added) (quoting City of Seaford, IV PERB\nat 2675)); Supplemental Mem. of Appellee-Below, Appellee Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #1\nat 11–13.\n136\n    See Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009 at *6 (―It is beyond the scope of\nthe Arbitrator‘s authority to consider whether such rates should or could be increased, whether\nother expenses should or could be decreased or reallocated, and/or whether existing reserves\nshould or could be allocated to fund the proposals. While it is certainly within the authority of\nthe governing body of a public employer to make any of these choices subject to the political\nwill of its citizenry, it is not within the province of the Interest Arbitrator under the [POFERA].‖\n(quoting City of Seaford, IV PERB at 2675–76)); Supplemental Mem. of Appellee-Below,\nAppellee Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #1 at 12–13 (―[T]here is not any legislative history that\nthe adjective ―existing‖ in the phrase ‗existing revenue‘ was intended to have any meaning\ndifferent from it[s] dictionary meaning ‗in existence or operation at the time under consideration,\ncurrent.‘ . . . [T]he only reasonably conclusion is that Delaware substituted the phrase ‗based on\nexisting revenues‘ as a shorthand method of indicating that any award cannot mandate an\nincrease or imposition of new taxes, fees, charges or other sources of revenue, the imposition of\nwhich remains in the discretion of the legislative body[,] but, instead, financial ability to pay\nmust be based upon existing or proposed revenue, i.e., taxes, fees, charges or other sources of\nrevenue.‖).\n\n                                                43\n\fwords, ―existing revenues‖ are still ―revenues;‖ they are still ―dynamic in\n\ncharacter‖ and can only be ascertained in reference to a specific span of time.\n\n       An analogy may help to clarify the point. Consider two retirees on a fixed\n\npension: In year X, Retiree A receives $60,000 per year and has no productive\n\nassets; Retiree B receives $50,000 per year and has $500,000 invested with a fixed\n\nreturn of 2%. What are the revenues of Retiree A and Retiree B in year X? Both\n\nhave a dynamic inflow of funds of $60,000; this is their revenue. Retiree B has\n\nsaved half a million dollars from past income—past revenue—and is undeniably\n\nwealthier than Retiree B, but revenue in year X to each is the same. The fact that\n\nmany years ago Retiree B had revenue streams from which, unlike Retiree A, he\n\nretained a surplus does not make that surplus part of his revenue in year X,\n\nalthough the interest which flows to him each year from that surplus is revenue.\n\n       The Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s decisions ignore the plain meaning of the\n\nword ―revenues‖ by categorically applying the term ―existing revenues‖ to the cash\n\nassets accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance as those assets presently\n\nexist in static form in various accounts across the General Fund, without regard to\n\nwhen those assets actually flowed to the City.137 In doing so, the Arbitrator and the\n\nPERB conflate ―existing assets‖ with ―existing revenues.‖ It may be true that the\n\nCity itself can, and occasionally has, used its existing assets to finance\n\n137\n   See, e.g., R. 1430 (―Nothing in the statute requires that the consideration of revenues be\nlimited to the current fiscal year or to any other specific, limited period of time.‖).\n\n                                             44\n\fexpenditures—both through the Mayor including prior years‘ accumulated surplus\n\nin the City‘s revenue projections and the Council appropriating prior years‘\n\naccumulated surplus to make modifications to the budget—but the potential for\n\nthese assets to be expended does not make them revenues. ―Revenue‖ refers to a\n\nflow in over a given time, not a flow out. Rather, assets accounted for by the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance, like any City asset, can be considered part of the City‘s\n\nprojected revenues only after the City has opted to appropriate them for future\n\nexpenditures, which authority is left to the discretion of the Mayor and the Council,\n\nand not the arbitrator, under the City‘s Charter.\n\n          I note that, although neither the Arbitrator‘s decision nor the PERB‘s\n\ndecision expressly say so, their holdings could be interpreted to imply that an\n\narbitrator should graft onto the POFERA an understanding that, specifically with\n\nrespect to arbitration awards for periods in the past, all prior years‘ revenues,\n\nincluding those now accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance, be available\n\nas ―existing revenues,‖ since the arbitrator could find that the LBFO can be\n\nsatisfied using these assets without changes in taxing/spending policy on the part\n\nof the City. I reject that implication. Nothing in the POFERA as interpreted by\n\nour caselaw is ambiguous here so as to allow departure from the statute‘s express\n\nlanguage; as I describe in my analysis below,138 the revenues from years covered\n\n\n138\n      See infra Part III.A.4.\n\n                                          45\n\fby the FOP‘s LBFO are easily ascertainable and form the outer limit of the\n\npermissible cost, and nothing about that result is absurd or unworkable.139\n\n       Because the cash assets accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance are\n\nnot ―existing revenues‖ within the meaning of Section 1615(d)(6), I find that the\n\nArbitrator and the PERB committed legal error by holding otherwise.\n\n               4. ―Existing Revenues‖ Are Those Revenues the City Received\n               During the Term of the Proposed CBA\n\n       Having found that calculation of ―existing revenues‖ inherently requires\n\nconsideration of a specific period of time, however, the question remains as to\n\nwhat specific period of time the Arbitrator should have considered here in gauging\n\nwhether the City had the financial ability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO. As\n\nnoted above, in the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 decision, this Court—as\n\nwell as the arbitrator and the PERB below—held that the ―relevant inquiry‖ under\n\nSection 1615(d)(6) in the context of arbitrating CBAs governing future years\n\n139\n    Even if I were to interpret the statute as ambiguous with respect to past application, the result\nwould be the same. Employing the principle of interpretation found in Seaford Bd. Of Educ. v.\nSeaford Educ. Ass’n, 1988 WL 8773, at *2 (Del. Ch. Feb. 5, 1988), see infra note 142 and\naccompanying text, I do not find that the term ―existing revenues‖ should be reinterpreted to\ninclude the cash assets included in the Unassigned Fund Balance in the limited context of\narbitrating retroactive CBAs. Section 1615(d)(6) is designed as a control on the collective\nbargaining process to ensure that the costs of any proposal the public employer is forced to\naccept is commensurate with the public employer‘s financial condition during that period, as set\nby the governing legislative body. If the arbitrator were to analyze a union‘s request for\nretroactive salary increases based on the public employer‘s prior years‘ accumulated surplus, it\nwould allow the union to spread the costs of its proposal over years beyond those actually\ncovered by the proposal, granting the union an advantageous bargaining position to which it\nwould not be entitled when arbitrating a CBA for future years. Such an interpretation would\ncreate an incentive for the unions to delay negotiations on CBAs and thus would be inconsistent\nwith the purpose of the POFERA.\n\n                                                46\n\finvolves net existing revenues over the contract period; that is, ―whether the\n\n[public employer] could afford [the union‘s] proposal throughout its entire . . .\n\nduration.‖140 However, also as noted above, the situation here is complicated by\n\nthe fact that the parties are negotiating a retroactive CBA.\n\n          The City makes the argument—for the first time in supplemental briefing—\n\nthat the POFERA reference to ―existing revenues‖ can have no logical application\n\nto past, as opposed to prospective, periods of employment. According to the City,\n\nthe restriction on the arbitrator to choose an offer that can be satisfied from\n\nexisting projected revenues prevents the arbitrator from impinging on a core\n\nlegislative function, but applying the term to past revenues would actually cause\n\nthe arbitrator to impinge on that function.             Specifically, the City argues that\n\napplying the ―existing revenues‖ standard retroactively ―leads to an unreasonable\n\nresult as it would require the public employer to set aside surplus revenues in prior\n\nyears in the event there is a subsequent [POFERA] proceeding, and the arbitrator\n\ndetermines the surplus constitutes ‗existing revenues‘ available to pay for a\n\nretroactive proposal.‖141 Better, according to the City, to judicially rewrite the\n\nstatute to impose the revenue restriction on the future year or years in which the\n\npayment for work in the past will be paid. I reject this argument.\n\n\n\n140\n      Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, 2014 WL 351009 at *10.\n141\n      City of Wilmington‘s Supplemental Mem. of Law in Supp. of Its Appeal at 9.\n\n                                               47\n\f          It is true that the POFERA is clearly designed in contemplation that public\n\nemployers and unions will collectively bargain over CBAs to govern their future\n\nrelationships. However, that does not mean that the revenue restriction cannot, or\n\nshould not, be applied retrospectively. In situations where it is ―reasonably plain\n\nthat the legislature had no specific intention with respect to the specific problem\n\nthat later arises,‖ this Court has found that ―the best technique to employ—the one\n\nmost consistent with the special, limited judicial role in our democracy—is for the\n\ncourt to interpret the words used, in a manner consistent both with their ordinary\n\nusage and with the discernible overall intent of the statute.‖142 Employing that\n\nprinciple of statutory interpretation here, it is clear that the City‘s interpretation\n\nwould lead to an unreasonable result. If the arbitrator were to analyze a union‘s\n\nrequest for retroactive salary increases based on the public employer‘s budget in\n\nthe year that it is to make those retroactive payments, it would constrict the union‘s\n\nability to obtain raises over multiple years to the revenues that the public employer\n\ncan generate in a single year, granting the public employer an advantageous\n\nbargaining position to which it would not be entitled when arbitrating CBAs for\n\nprospective terms of employment.                Such an interpretation would create an\n\n\n\n\n142\n      Seaford Bd. Of Educ. v. Seaford Educ. Ass’n, 1988 WL 8773, at *2 (Del. Ch. Feb. 5, 1988).\n\n                                                48\n\fincentive for public employers to delay negotiations on CBAs and thus would be\n\ninconsistent with the purpose of the POFERA.143\n\n       Instead, I see no reason to depart from this Court‘s position in Fraternal\n\nOrder of Police, Lodge 5 that ―existing revenues‖ refers to the revenues in the\n\nfiscal years covered by the proposed CBA, taken as a whole.144 Not only is this\n\ninterpretation consistent with the plain meaning of the statute‘s language and with\n\nprior precedent of this Court interpreting that language, it also maintains, more\n\nthan any other interpretation offered by the parties or the decisions below, the\n\npublic employer‘s and the union‘s respective bargaining positions in arbitrations\n\nover retroactive CBAs as those positions already exist under the POFERA in\n\narbitrations over CBAs for prospective terms of employment. The key difference\n\nbetween the two situations is that in arbitrations over retroactive CBAs the\n\narbitrator will be guided by actual revenue figures for the years covered by the\n\nproposal, as opposed to revenue projections for those years. However, it does not\n\nseem to me that this difference inherently favors either the public employer or the\n\nunion in the collective bargaining process.\n\n\n\n\n143\n    For a discussion of the analogous incentive problem arising from the FOP‘s (initial) argument\nthat all prior years‘ surpluses should be available for retroactive CBAs, see supra note 139.\n144\n    That is, for a LBFO to be paid out of the General Fund, the arbitrator must consider whether\nor not the public employer could pay the net costs of the contract envisioned by the LBFO from\nthe net of actual and/or projected annual operating surpluses or deficits—―existing revenues‖—\nin the General Fund during the years that contract would be in existence.\n\n                                               49\n\f          Furthermore, I do not find persuasive the City‘s argument that applying a\n\nrevenue restriction for retroactive CBAs based on prior years‘ revenues improperly\n\nallows the arbitrator to intrude on the core legislative functions of the City‘s\n\nelected officials by ―[e]ffectively requiring the City to set aside surpluses in prior\n\nfiscal years.‖145 The City‘s concern is not unique to arbitrations over retroactive\n\nCBAs.        It is unchallenged that an arbitrator‘s decision may require a public\n\nemployer to pay for the costs of CBAs covering future years out of surplus\n\nrevenues that the public employer is projected to receive in those years, and thus\n\nmay, under the City‘s reasoning, effectively require the public employer to ―set\n\naside‖ those future revenues for a specific use as they are obtained. If anything,\n\nthere is actually less of a concern that using net surplus revenues over the years\n\ncovered by the contract as a basis for Section 1615(d)(6) will cause an arbitrator to\n\nimpinge on a core legislative function in the context of retroactive CBAs,\n\nconsidering that revenues and expenses in prior years are definitively known, as\n\nopposed to forecasted, and thus the arbitrator cannot overestimate the public\n\nemployer‘s financial ability. Rather, what the City is actually arguing is that\n\napplying the approach laid out in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 in\n\narbitrations over retroactive CBAs will effectively tie up a portion of the City‘s\n\nsurplus assets. I note that such a consequence is not necessarily unreasonable nor\n\n\n145\n      City of Wilmington‘s Supplemental Mem. of Law in Supp. of Its Appeal at 9.\n\n                                               50\n\fshould it be unexpected, considering that, in situations where collective bargaining\n\non a successor CBA has lagged past the termination of the previous CBA, the City\n\nis aware that its cost of labor for these employees is unsettled and, because that\n\ncost is set at a time in the past, likely deflated. In any event, the City‘s concern\n\ndoes not find support in the language or the underlying purpose of the POFERA.\n\n      Therefore, I find that the term ―existing revenues‖ in Section 1615(d)(6)\n\nrequired the Arbitrator in this situation to analyze the City‘s financial ability to\n\nmeet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO using the City‘s revenues in the General Fund\n\nover the duration of the four years covered by that proposal, FY 2011 to FY 2014.\n\n      B. The Arbitrator and the PERB Erred as a Matter of Law in Ruling on the\n      City’s Financial Ability to Meet the Costs of the FOP’s LBFO Based on\n      Factors Other than Existing Revenues\n\n      Having found that the term ―existing revenues‖ refers here to the period\n\ncovered by the FOP‘s LBFO, I turn next to whether the Arbitrator and the PERB\n\napplied an improper standard to gauge the City‘s financial ability to meet the costs\n\nof the FOP‘s LBFO. As a preliminary matter, I note that it is not clear exactly how\n\nthe Arbitrator reached her conclusion that the City did not have ―an inability to\n\nafford the costs of the FOP‘s last, best, final offer.‖ The Arbitrator did not detail\n\nthe calculation that she used or the specific figures upon which she relied for her\n\nconclusion, only that she had reached that conclusion ―[f]or all the[] reasons‖ set\n\nout over the previous seven pages of the decision. For instance, at the beginning of\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\fher analysis, the Arbitrator noted that the FOP had only asked for salary increases\n\nfor Bargaining Unit members in ―FY 2012 and FY 2013, years in which the City\n\naccrued surpluses and increased its unassigned fund balance,‖ and that ―[t]he\n\nrevenue, expenditure and fund balances are known for FY 2011 through FY 2014,\n\nwith the FY 2014 unassigned fund balance projected to be $28,520,703, which\n\nincludes $5,699,343 in cash,‖146 but the decision is silent as to whether—and if so,\n\nhow—any of these pieces of information factored into her final decision that the\n\nCity could afford the FOP‘s proposal; nor does the decision explain how the\n\nprojected savings of approximately $107,606 in FY 2014 from certain vacancies\n\nwithin the City‘s police force factored into the Arbitrator‘s decision.147\n\n       However, assuming, as the PERB appears to in its decision148 and as the\n\nparties do in briefing,149 that the Arbitrator based her ruling that the City could\n\n―afford‖ the FOP‘s LBFO solely on the $5,699,343 in cash assets that was\n\nprojected to be included in the Unassigned Fund Balance at the expiration of FY\n\n2014, I find that the Arbitrator and the PERB did not apply the standard required\n\n\n146\n     R. 1367.\n147\n     See R. 1371.\n148\n     See R. 1430 (―The Arbitrator determined, based on the City‘s evidence, [that] the Unassigned\nFund Balance constitutes the account or fund in which the City accumulates its excess revenues\nand from which the City draws funds to meet unanticipated or unfunded expenses in its budget.\n . . . There is no question that the Unassigned Fund Balance Balance‘s cash or cash equivalent is\ncomprised of funds from existing revenues. It is and has been a stable source of funding.‖\n(emphasis added)).\n149\n     See, e.g., City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of Its Appeal at 10, 15–16; Answering\nBr. of Appellee-Below Appellee Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 1 at 34.\n\n                                               52\n\fby Section 1615(d)(6). As I have found above, the Arbitrator and the PERB\n\nshould have evaluated the City‘s financial ability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s\n\nLBFO based on whether the City generated sufficient revenues in the General\n\nFund from FY 2011 to FY 2014.\n\n          C. The Arbitrator and the PERB Did Not Err as a Matter of Law in Holding\n          that FY 2015 Costs Should Not Be Included in the Total Projected Costs of\n          the FOP’s LBFO\n\n          Finally, I turn to the issue of whether FY 2015 costs—and perhaps those\n\nfrom succeeding years as well—should be included in the total projected costs of\n\nthe FOP‘s LBFO. Section 1615(d)(6) requires the Arbitrator and the PERB to\n\nconsider ―[t]he financial ability of the public employer, based on existing revenues,\n\nto meet the costs of any proposed settlements.‖150 The City argues that, as a matter\n\nof law, ―costs of any proposed settlements‖ must be interpreted to include costs of\n\na proposed CBA in non-contract years where, like here, the terms of the proposed\n\nCBA will realistically continue into those non-contract years. As support for its\n\ninterpretation, the City cites a passage from City of Seaford wherein the arbitrator\n\nwas describing the rationale underlying using ―existing revenues‖ to qualify the\n\nCity‘s financial ability meet the costs of any proposal, which passage was cited\n\n\n\n\n150\n      19 Del. C. § 1615(d)(6) (emphasis added).\n\n                                                  53\n\ffavorably by this Court in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 v. New Castle\n\nCounty151:\n\n       There is a very clear and logical reason the General Assembly limited\n       the Interest Arbitrator to consider only ―existing revenues‖ in reaching\n       a determination as to whether a public employer can afford a proposed\n       settlement. Many costs, including those for wages and benefits, are\n       recurring and generally tend to automatically increase annually, either\n       as a result of negotiated provisions of a collective bargaining\n       agreement or due to inflationary pressure on the costs of services or\n       goods an employer has agreed to provide. Consequently, they\n       constitute an on-going and frequently increasing financial\n       obligation.152\n\nAccording to the City, because the parties do not have a CBA in place to succeed\n\nthe FOP‘s proposed CBA and are unlikely to have one in place by the end of FY\n\n2015, and because the City must, by law, honor the terms found in the last year of\n\nthe parties‘ previous CBA until a successor CBA can be executed, the salary\n\nincreases in the FOP‘s LBFO will actually be ―on-going,‖ ―recurring,‖ and\n\n―automatically‖ continued through at least FY 2015, and thus are the type of costs\n\nenvisioned by Section 1615(d)(6). I do not find this argument persuasive.\n\n       The POFERA does not define the phrase ―costs of any proposed settlement‖\n\nas it appears in Section 1615(d)(6), nor does its twin, the PERA, define the phrase\n\nas it appears in identical form in Section 1315(d)(6), 153 nor does this Court‘s\n\n\n151\n    2014 WL 351009 (Del. Ch. Jan. 29, 2014).\n152\n    Id. at *6 (quoting City of Seaford v. Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 9, IV PERB 2659, 2676\n(July 15, 2002) (Decision of the Interest Arbitrator on Remand)).\n153\n    See 19 Del. C. § 1615(d)(6).\n\n                                              54\n\flimited caselaw reviewing PERB decisions under either of these acts define the\n\nphrase. The dictionary definition of ―cost‖ is ―the amount or equivalent paid or\n\ncharged for something.‖154 Based on the plain meaning of ―cost,‖ the phrase ―costs\n\nof any proposed settlement‖ is unambiguous; it can only be reasonably interpreted\n\nto mean the amount of money the City would necessarily expend in order to satisfy\n\nits obligations under the proposed CBA. It unambiguously does not include costs\n\nof the City‘s obligations following the expiration of the proposed CBA, i.e., the\n\namount of money the City will have to expend until the parties execute a different,\n\nsuccessor agreement. In other words, the fact that the City‘s costs to operate\n\nwithin the law in the absence of a CBA may be initially determined by the terms of\n\nthe parties‘ previous CBA does not mean that those are ―costs of‖ the previous\n\nCBA.\n\n       My conclusion in this regard is supported by the fact that, even if the City is\n\nforced to provide pay and benefits to the Bargaining Unit employees in FY 2015\n\nbased on the FY 2014 levels in the FOP‘s LBFO, the parties must still negotiate\n\nand adopt a new CBA to retroactively govern FY 2015, which new CBA will\n\ndictate the actual salaries and benefits the employees were entitled to in FY 2015,\n\n\n\n\n154\n   Webster’s II New College Dictionary 255 (1995); see also Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed.\n2014) (defining ―cost‖ as ―the amount paid or charged for something; price or expenditure‖).\n\n                                            55\n\fand thus the City‘s actual costs in FY 2015.155 The City‘s plea for pragmatism,\n\nthat the Court can be assured that collective bargaining will yield costs in FY 2015\n\nat least on level with FY 2014 because the Bargaining Unit will never agree to\n\nretroactively reduce salaries and benefits, is also unavailing, considering the\n\nBargaining Unit will not be entitled to retain FY 2014 salaries and benefits in any\n\nsuccessor CBA under Section 1615(d)(6) if the City does not have sufficient\n\nrevenues to meet those costs during the period of the successor CBA.156 Even if\n\nthe City can meet those costs in retrospect, the salaries and benefits will still be\n\nsubject to evaluation under the seven factors in Section 1615(d). Thus, while I\n\nhave no doubt that the City will face resistance in any effort to claw back salaries\n\nand benefits in FY 2015, that resistance is of the same variety that the City would\n\nface in attempting to avoid salary and benefit increases that it could afford in\n\nCBAs with prospective contract terms; at the very least, this resistance is not so\n\nmaterially different in the context of negotiating retroactive CBAs as to constitute\n\nan ―unreasonable or absurd result‖ that would cause this Court to ignore the plain\n\nmeaning of the statute‘s language.157 Therefore, I find that the Arbitrator and the\n\n\n\n155\n    The same principle applies if the parties‘ negotiations over a successor agreement stretch past\nFY 2015.\n156\n    See supra Part III.A.4.\n157\n    This specific collective bargaining dispute illustrates my point. Here, whereas the FOP‘s\nLBFO included a modest cost-of-living adjustment in prior years, the City‘s LBFO included no\ncost-of-living adjustment and called for an increase in employee contributions to healthcare costs\nin then-future years, effecting a prospective reduction in the City‘s costs in those years. The\n\n                                                56\n\fPERB did not err as a matter of law in excluding FY 2015 costs from its\n\ncalculation of the total projected costs of the FOP‘s LBFO.\n\n       D. Applying the Proper Standard, the FOP’s LBFO Is Not Disqualified\n       Under Section 1615(d)(6)\n\n       Having determined the applicable standard under Section 1615(d)(6), as well\n\nas the appropriate estimation of the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO, I turn to considering\n\nwhether the City had the financial ability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO.\n\nThe record on appeal is sufficient to find that, though the Arbitrator and the PERB\n\napplied the wrong standard in the decisions below, their ultimate determination\n\nthat the City could meet the costs of the FOP‘s proposal was correct. The parties\n\nstipulated that, as to the City‘s General Fund, the City had a net operating surplus\n\nof $6,055,527 in FY 2011; a net operating surplus of $7,444,088 in FY 2012; a net\n\noperating surplus of $1,326,984 in FY 2013; and a net operating deficit of\n\n$1,170,833 in FY 2014.         Netting these throughout the four-year duration of the\n\nFOP‘s proposal—as I must under the rationale of Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge\n\n5—the City had a net operating surplus in the General Fund of $13,655,766 from\n\nFY 2011 to FY 2014, more than sufficient to cover the proposal‘s estimated costs\n\nof $127,648.\n\n\n\n\nCity‘s own position in this collective bargaining dispute, then, illustrates that costs are not\nnecessarily ―locked in‖ in from contract to contract.\n\n\n\n                                              57\n\f                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the PERB is reversed in part and\n\naffirmed in part. Although I have found that the Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s legal\n\nerrors were ultimately insignificant in their consideration of whether the FOP‘s\n\nLBFO should be disqualified under Section 1615(d)(6), I am hesitant to enter a\n\nfinal judgment in this matter based on that conclusion. A POFERA arbitrator, after\n\ndetermining that the parties‘ LBFOs are not disqualified under subsection (d)(6), is\n\ngiven discretion to choose between the proposals based on a balancing of the other\n\nSection 1615(d) factors. Though the Arbitrator here has already exercised that\n\ndiscretion and selected the FOP‘s proposal, it is unclear to me to what extent the\n\nlegal rulings in this Memorandum Opinion may affect the balancing of the other\n\nSection 1615(d) factors, and thus to what extent an entry of final judgment in this\n\nCourt at this point in the proceedings would tread on the Arbitrator‘s statutory\n\ndiscretion. Therefore, the parties should confer and inform the Court whether a\n\nremand to the Arbitrator is appropriate in light of this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n      IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f",

Those individuals have been\n\nworking since mid-2010 without a contract. Negotiations between the City and the\n\nBargaining Unit‘s exclusive bargaining representative, the Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice, Lodge 1 (the ―FOP‖), did not even begin until November of 2010 and were\n\nnot fruitful. The employees have been paid under the terms of the former contract,\n\nwhich expired on June 30, 2010, as called for in the law governing collective\n\nbargaining between police and Delaware governmental entities—the Police\n\nOfficers‘ and Firefighters‘ Employment Relations Act (the ―POFERA‖), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n§ 1601 et seq. Eventually, pursuant to the terms of the POFERA, the parties came\n\nbefore an arbitrator, who, under POFERA rules, was required to choose, based on\n\nstatutory criteria, between the last, best, final offer (―LBFO‖) of each party, which\n\nhad to be accepted in toto. In making this choice, the arbitrator had discretion,\n\nexcept with respect to one factor: If the City could not pay the salary and benefits\n\nproposed in the FOP‘s LBFO from ―existing revenues,‖ the arbitrator was required\n\nto reject that proposal and impose the City‘s LBFO.\n\n      The arbitrator ruled on September 8, 2014, accepting the FOP‘s LBFO after\n\nfinding that the City could ―afford‖ it, apparently finding it could be paid for with\n\n\n                                         1\n\fexisting revenues. The FOP‘s offer was for a period ending on June 30, 2014.\n\nThus, as of the time of the arbitration order, the term of employment called for had\n\nbeen completed in its entirety. Exercising its rights under the POFERA, the City\n\nappealed the arbitrator‘s decision to the Public Employment Relations Board (the\n\n―PERB‖), which affirmed, and then appealed the decision of the PERB to this\n\nCourt.\n\n         The parties agree that the POFERA was adopted by the General Assembly\n\nunder the apparent (and entirely reasonable) assumption that it would apply\n\nprospectively, here meaning the parties would use the POFERA to resolve\n\ncollective bargaining disputes over contracts governing future relationships. The\n\ndifferences between the parties arise in large part because of the difficulties of\n\napplying the POFERA where the parties have acted in reverse order—work first,\n\nthen agree to terms. The issues raised are legal, and subject to de novo review. I\n\nfind, for the reasons below, that the arbitrator and the PERB got some issues of law\n\nright and some wrong. Because those issues they got wrong might have affected\n\nthe exercise of discretion by the arbitrator, I ask the parties to comment on whether\n\na remand is necessary. The facts, and my reasoning, are set out below.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                               I. BACKGROUND FACTS1\n\n       This case arises under the POFERA, which, generally, grants Delaware‘s\n\npolice officers and firefighters certain rights to collectively bargain, sets forth the\n\nlaws governing that process—including a process for resolving collective\n\nbargaining disputes—and charges the PERB with administering those laws.2\n\nPursuant to the POFERA, collective bargaining disputes proceed first to mediation\n\nand, if mediation is unsuccessful, then to binding interest arbitration.3                     An\n\narbitrator‘s decision may be appealed to the PERB, whose decision may then be\n\nappealed to this Court.4 Before me is such an appeal by the City from a decision of\n\nthe PERB, itself affirming on appeal an arbitrator‘s decision resolving a collective\n\nbargaining dispute between the FOP and the City in favor of the FOP.\n\n       A. The Parties\n\n       The City is a public employer within the meaning of Section 1602(l) of the\n\nPOFERA.5\n\n\n\n1\n  Unless otherwise indicated, the factual background is drawn from the record created in the\nPERB proceedings.

R. 1363.\n15\n   Those factors are:\n        (1) The interests and welfare of the public.\n        (2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, benefits, hours and conditions of\n            employment of the employees involved in the binding interest arbitration\n            proceedings with the wages, salaries, benefits hours and conditions of\n            employment of other employees performing the same or similar services or\n            requiring similar skills under similar working conditions in the same\n\n                                             5\n\fto chose the LBFO of either the public employer or the union; the arbitrator may\n\nnot pick and choose between provisions of the two LBFOs, or create terms of her\n\nown.16\n\n       In February 2014, the FOP and the City each submitted its LBFO for\n\nconsideration by the Arbitrator.17 In the FOP‘s LBFO, the FOP proposed a CBA\n\nwith a term of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2014—i.e., covering the fiscal years\n\nthat had passed since the parties‘ previous CBA had expired.18 Among other\n\nthings, the FOP‘s LBFO included retroactive cost-of-living adjustments to the\n\nsalary schedules for FY 2012 and FY 2013, effectuating retroactive increases in\n\n\n\n            community and in comparable communities and with other employees\n            generally in the same community and in comparable communities.\n        (3) The overall compensation presently received by the employees inclusive of\n            direct wages, salary, vacations, holidays, excused leaves, insurance and\n            pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and stability of\n            employment, and all other benefits received.\n        (4) Stipulations of the parties.\n        (5) The lawful authority of the public employer.\n        (6) The financial ability of the public employer, based on existing revenues, to\n            meet the costs of any proposed settlements; provided that any enhancement to\n            such financial ability derived from savings experienced by such public\n            employer as a result of a strike shall not be considered by the binding interest\n            arbitrator.\n        (7) Such other factors not confined to the foregoing which are normally or\n            traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours and\n            conditions of employment through voluntary collective bargaining, mediation,\n            binding interest arbitration or otherwise between parties, in the public service\n            or in private employment.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1615(d).\n16\n   See id.

Thus, in all three proceedings, the\n\nCity‘s finances have been a central focus.\n\n               1. The City‘s Budget\n\n                       a. The Budget Process\n\n       The City‘s charter (the ―Charter‖) requires the City each fiscal year to pass\n\nand maintain a balanced budget, which, according to the Charter, means a budget\n\nwhere projected revenues equal operating expenditures plus any existing deficits.29\n\nEach budget cycle, the Office of the Mayor of the City (the ―Mayor‖), working in\n\nconjunction with the Office of Management and Budget (the ―OMB‖) and the\n\nDepartment of Finance, and in consultation with the heads of the City‘s various\n\nother departments and the public, must determine the City‘s existing deficit and\n\nsurplus, create revenue projections for the City for the upcoming year, develop an\n\ninitial budget proposal, and submit all of this information to the City‘s legislative\n\n\n\n29\n   See Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-300(1) (―It shall be the duty of the council, at least thirty (30) days\nbefore the end of the fiscal year, to adopt the annual operating budget ordinance for the next\nfiscal year.‖); id. § 2-300(2) (―The annual operating budget ordinance shall provide for\ndischarging any deficit and shall make appropriations to the council, the mayor, and all officers,\ndepartments, boards and commissions which form a part of the executive or administrative\nbranch of the government, and for all other items which are to be met out of the revenue of the\ncity.‖); id. § 2-302 (―Not later than the passage of the annual operating budget ordinance, the\ncouncil shall ordain such revenue measures as will, in the opinion of the mayor, yield sufficient\nrevenue to balance the budget.‖).\n\n                                                 9\n\fbody, the City Council (the ―Council‖).30 The Charter reserves the authority to\n\nalter and adopt the budget on behalf of the City to the Council.31 However, in\n\nfinalizing the budget provided to it by the Mayor, the Council must utilize the\n\nMayor‘s estimates for the City‘s surplus, deficit, and projected revenues.32\n\n       Once the Council has adopted the budget, it may not make any additional\n\noperating appropriations in that fiscal year except in certain situations enumerated\n\nin the Charter, such as to meet the costs of unanticipated emergencies.33 In cases\n\nwhere the Council does modify the budget to appropriate additional money, the\n\nCouncil ―must determine and approve the revenue by which [the] addition to the\n\nbudget will be funded‖ in order to maintain a balanced budget;34 any portion of the\n\nadditional costs that cannot be paid out of the revenues for that fiscal year carry\n\nover to the following fiscal year as deficit.35\n\n\n\n\n30\n   Id. § 4-401(b); R. 640–41.\n31\n   Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-300(1); see also R. 641. The Council‘s approved budget, however, is\nsubject to the Mayor‘s traditional and line-item veto, both of which may be overridden by a two-\nthirds vote of the Council. See Wilm C. § 2-202.\n32\n   Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-300(3); see also R. 641.\n33\n   See Wilm. C. (Charter) § 2-301; R. 641. For example, in FY 2014 the Council had to approve\nadditional spending so the City could cover the unanticipated expenses of severe winter weather.\nR. 929. The OMB ―has the authority to transfer budget allocations between accounts that are\nwithin the same Fund, Department, and Account Group,‖ but the Council must approve ―[a]ny\nother type of transfer, such as between Funds, Departments or different Account Groups‖ as well\nas any deletions to the budget.

C.

Deficit Spending\n\n       Despite the balanced budget requirement in the Charter, it is still possible for\n\nthe City to engage in deficit spending, meaning in any given fiscal year the City‘s\n\nexpenditures exceed revenues generated by the City.                        This could occur\n\ninadvertently in the budget process, such as if the Mayor overestimates the City‘s\n\nrevenues in its projections, allowing the Council to appropriate more money than\n\nthe City can actually match with revenues, but it could also occur advertently at\n\ncertain stages in the budget process. First, in the development phase, it is the\n\nCity‘s financial policy that the Mayor may, with limited exceptions, include prior\n\nyears‘ accumulated surplus in its revenue projections.37 This allows the City to\n\n―limit[] tax increases because prior years‘ surplus [is] used prior to revenue\n\nenhancements.‖38 Second, if the Council modifies the budget during the fiscal year\n\nto make additional appropriations, the Council may ordain prior years‘\n\n\n\n36\n   See Wilm. C. (Charter) §§ 2-300, 2-301; R. 929.\n37\n   E.g., R. 646; cf. R. 641 (―For the budget to be legally balanced, revenues plus an amount of\nexisting prior years‘ surpluses, if any, must equal operating expenditures plus any existing\ndeficits.‖). The exceptions are those portions of prior years‘ accumulated surplus ―designated for\ndebt service, encumbrances or the Budget Reserve Account.‖ R. 646; see also infra note 46\n(explaining the Budget Reserve Account).\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                               11\n\faccumulated surplus as the ―revenue‖ by which to fund those additional\n\nexpenditures.39\n\n                      c. Fund Accounting\n\n       In order to ―segregate the specific purposes and operations of the various\n\nactivities of the City,‖ the City organizes its budget, including both the accounting\n\nand budgeting portions, into four major funds: The General Fund, the Special\n\nFunds, the Water/Sewer Fund, and the Internal Service Fund.40 According to the\n\nCity, ―Funds can be thought of as being like the subsidiaries of a major\n\nconglomerate corporation. Each subsidiary is responsible for its own operational\n\nresults and strategy, yet is still part of the larger conglomerate corporation when it\n\ncomes to overall management and financial results.‖41 Basic municipal operations\n\nand services, including police and fire protection, fall under the General Fund, the\n\nrevenues for which are derived from taxes, fees, fines, and interest on\n\ninvestments.42 The parties here agree that the revenue available to meet the costs\n\nof their CBA must come from the General Fund.\n\n       For each budget cycle, the City‘s budget includes balance sheets in its\n\nfinancial statements that tally the General Fund‘s ―fund balance‖ as of the end of\n\n\n\n39\n   See, e.g., R. 929–30.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. With the exception of certain smaller funds within the Special Funds, the expenditures\nfor all the four major funds are appropriated through the budget process.

The City labels the difference between fund assets and liabilities as ―fund\nbalance‖ on its financial statements for all funds designated as ―government funds,‖ including\nthe General Fund and the Special Funds. R. 675; see also R. 649. For funds designated as\n―proprietary funds‖ or ―fiduciary funds,‖ such as the Water/Sewer Fund, the City labels the\ndifference between fund assets and liabilities as ―net assets‖ on its financial statements. R. 676.\nInformation regarding fund balance or net assets pertains only to the specific fund in which it is\nreported, not the City‘s finances as a whole.\n45\n   See, e.g., R. 928, 965–67. For example, the General Fund‘s fund balance may account both\nfor cash assets that the City has invested in a specific CD as well as certain of the City‘s\nreceivables that exist only as claims for payments.\n\n                                                13\n\f       Restricted – Amounts that can be spent only for specific purposes\n       because of the City Charter, City Code, State or federal laws, or\n       externally imposed conditions by grantors or creditors.\n\n       Committed – Amounts that can be used only for specific purposed\n       [sic] determined by a formal action by City Council ordinance or\n       resolution. This includes the Budget Reserve Account.46\n\n       Assigned – Amounts that are allocated for a future use by the Mayor,\n       but are not spendable until a budget ordinance appropriating the\n       amounts is passed by City Council.\n\n       Unassigned – All amounts not included in other spendable\n       classifications.47\n\nLike the fund balance, each of these subcategories represents a mathematical\n\ncalculation—each tracks a specific portion of the net assets in the General Fund\n\nbased on the nature of the restrictions placed on the City‘s ability to utilize the\n\nassets.48 Thus, also like the fund balance, none of the subcategories represent an\n\nactual repository where the certain ―type‖ of asset in that subcategory can be\n\n\n46\n   The City is required to maintain a ―Budget Reserve Account‖ within the General Fund equal to\n10% of the upcoming year‘s General Fund budget. Wilm C. §§ 2-376, 2-377; see also R. 955.\nThe money in the Budget Reserve Account may only be used for ―adverse economic conditions\nor public emergency and when declared by council by ordinance enacted by a two-thirds vote\n(nine) of the city council, following certification by the mayor of such economic conditions or\npublic emergency,‖ and the money must be replenished from year to year. Wilm. C. §§ 2-376, 2-\n377; see also R. 955–56. However, in 2009, the City passed an ordinance allowing the City\ntreasurer to use the money in the Budget Reserve Account to pay the City‘s employee payroll,\ndebt service, and accounts payable in FY 2009, and requiring the treasurer to fully replenish the\nmoney in the Budget Reserve Account by the following October; the City renewed that\nordinance for FY 2010, FY 2012, FY 2013, and FY 2014. See Wilm. C. § 2-379. On May 15,\n2015, the City again renewed the ordinance for FY 2015. See Wilm. Ordinance 15-017, § 1\n(May 15, 2015).\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n48\n   See R. 927–28.\n\n                                               14\n\ffound, but instead each is an accounting of all the net assets of that ―type‖ that\n\nexist in whatever form across the General Fund.\n\n                     d. The Unassigned Fund Balance\n\n       The General Fund‘s unassigned fund balance (the ―Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance‖) accounts for those net assets within the General Fund that are not subject\n\nto any of the limitations found in the other subcategories. Typically, the General\n\nFund‘s ―unassigned‖ net assets include—but are not all—cash and cash\n\nequivalents, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and CDs.49                 In the\n\narbitration proceedings, the Director of the OMB, Robert Greco, explained the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance in these general terms:\n\n       [I]n other words, just like a business or even for yourself as a person\n       you have what is called net worth. And what [the City does] at the\n       end of the fiscal year[,] the City looks and says, Here [are] our assets,\n       subtract out [our] liabilities, and then also subtract out any reserve\n       accounts like the budget reserve or reserve for encumbrances.\n           The value left, that dollar amount, is called unassigned fund\n       balance. It‘s not all cash and it‘s not a fund sitting there called\n       unassigned fund balance, it just has cash. It is, again, a mathematical\n       calculation that changes month-to-month, year-to-year.50\n\n       Greco testified that the Unassigned Fund Balance generally ebbs and flows\n\nwith the General Fund‘s net operating deficits and surpluses. If there is a net\n\noperating surplus in the General Fund in any given fiscal year, the incoming assets\n\n\n49\n   R. 967–69. For the sake of simplicity, for the remainder of this Memorandum Opinion I will\nrefer to cash and cash equivalents together using the shorthand ―cash assets.‖\n50\n   R. 928–29; see also R. 966–69.\n\n                                             15\n\ffrom that surplus are likely to be spendable, unrestricted, uncommitted, and\n\nunassigned, and thus their value will ―flow,‖ conceptually, to the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance, causing it to grow from the previous year.51 Conversely, if there is a net\n\noperating deficit within the General Fund in any given fiscal year, and the City has\n\nappropriated prior years‘ accumulated surplus to finance the deficit expenditures,\n\nthe outgoing surplus assets may be assets that were previously categorized as\n\n―unassigned,‖ causing the Unassigned Fund Balance to shrink.52 Greco explained\n\nthat this scenario is especially likely to play out in situations where the Council is\n\nmodifying the budget during the fiscal year to add appropriations for expenditures\n\nthat require quick payment; Greco explained that in this scenario, if the City lacks\n\nthe actual revenues, the Council is likely to finance the expenditures using\n\nunassigned net assets from the General Fund, specifically, cash assets:\n\n           Where [the City] find[s] that money[,] in this case the money went\n       out the door, so, it was actually working capital, cash that is on hand\n       that the treasurer‘s office uses, he has money invested in CD‘s and\n       other things, a checking account. So, at the end of the year all else\n       being equal if [the City] overspend[s] . . . [it] ha[s] revenues and [it]\n       ha[s] more expenses than revenues, that unassigned fund balance is\n       going to go down; but, again, it‘s a calculation, it‘s not a true fund that\n       sits there just with cash. The treasurer‘s office actually has to go to an\n       asset account, cash account or CD, liquidate that to pay for these\n       kind[s] of things.53\n51\n   See R. 929 (―Now, if you do have more revenues than expenditures, those will flow into that\ncalculation and, obviously, if it doesn‘t get put anywhere else or [the City‘s] liabilities don‘t\nincrease or expenses [increase], it will increase [the City‘s] unassigned fund balance.‖).\n52\n   See, e.g., R. 929–30; 965–66.\n53\n   R. 929–30; see also R. 968 (―And, again, I can‘t state this more clearly than this.

The City‘s Financial Condition\n\n       The parties have stipulated that the City‘s budgets over the four years\n\ncovered by the FOP‘s LBFO generated the following net operating surpluses and\n\ndeficits in the General Fund: a net operating surplus of $6,055,527 in FY 2011; a\n\nnet operating surplus of $7,444,088 in FY 2012; a net operating surplus of\n\n$1,326,984 in FY 2013; and a net operating deficit of $1,170,833 in FY 2014.55\n\nAdditionally, the parties have stipulated that the City is projected to generate a net\n\noperating surplus of $1,400,905 in the General Fund for FY 2015, and a net\n\noperating deficit of $333,508 in the General Fund for FY 2016.56\n\n       The Unassigned Fund Balance existing at the end of FY 2012 was\n\n$21,964,373.57 In the City‘s budget for FY 2014, the City estimated that the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance had grown to $25,917,354 by the end of FY 2013, and\n\nCouncil] to deficit spend and what [it is] doing is [it is] using assets on hand. Somewhere,\nsomehow some assets have to be liquidated, a CD, money has to be taken out of a checking\naccount. . . . [T]here is not this unassigned fund balance sitting alone and has cash in it. It\nalways comes from the assets. Again, this calculation gives you a value of your unassigned fund\nbalance. It is not in and of itself an actual savings account.‖).\n54\n    See R. 946 (―That money [for the FOP‘s proposal] would come out of either reserves,\nunassigned fund balance, cash. We would then have to go back to [the Council]. [It] would\nmake an appropriation. So you would actually see an increase in the fiscal year whenever it was\npaid. If it was paid this year, we would have to increase the budget in 14 and then [the City\ntreasurer] would have to cash out a CD and pay out those increases.‖).\n55\n   Stipulation (Mar. 16, 2015).\n56\n   Id.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also R. 999–1000.\n\n                                              17\n\fprojected that the Unassigned Fund Balance would grow to approximately\n\n$28,520,703 by the end of FY 2014.58 As of April 2014, cash assets accounted for\n\n$5,699,343 of the Unassigned Fund Balance.59\n\n       E. The Arbitration Decision\n\n       The Arbitrator held a two-day hearing on May 6–7, 2015, after which, on or\n\nabout September 8, 2014, she issued her decision60 that ―the last, best, final offer of\n\nFOP Lodge 1 is . . . the more reasonable [proposal] based upon the statutory\n\ncriteria set forth in 19 Del C. § 1615.‖61 In reaching that decision, the Arbitrator\n\nfirst determined that ―[t]he record does not support the conclusion that the City has\n\nan inability to afford the limited costs of the FOP offer.‖62 The parties agree that,\n\nby this language, the Arbitrator was attempting to address subsection (d)(6) and its\n\nrequirement that the LBFO selected must be payable from ―existing revenues;‖\n\nthey disagree, however, as to whether she properly analyzed that factor.

First, she determined\n\nthat ―[t]he evidence does not establish the ‗structural deficit‘ asserted by the\n\nCity.‖68 Rather, she found that the City‘s projected deficits due in large part to\n\nfunding pension plans are ―commonly understood to be cyclical, rather than\n\nstructural, deficits because they occur as a result of downturns in the economy,‖ as\n\n\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n64\n   See R. 1311–12.\n65\n   See R. 1313–15.\n66\n   R. 1314–15.\n67\n   See, e.g., FOP Lodge 5 v.

Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 9,72\n\nwherein the arbitrator defined ―reserves‖ as those assets whose utilization is within\n\nthe exclusive authority of the Council and which are assigned to reserve status by\n\nan affirmative act of the Council.73 After briefly examining the nature of the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance, the Arbitrator concluded that it ―does not constitute a\n\nreserve because assets are not ‗allocated‘ to this fund by an affirmative act of the\n\nCouncil, nor are there restrictions upon its use.‖74 Further, she noted that the\n\n―Council has allocated moneys from [the] [U]nassigned [F]und [B]alance to\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1365</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1365</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1368</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n72\n   IV PERB 2659 (July 15, 2002) (Decision of the Interest Arbitrator on Remand).

If the City is able to establish that its fiscal situation has\n       deteriorated, the next agreement could include cost savings and/or a\n       change in either the structure or amounts of [salary] step increases for\n       this bargaining unit.77\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1368</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1369</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The arbitrator also chastised the parties for allowing so much time to pass without a\nCBA in place and encouraged them to immediately begin negotiations on a successor agreement\nto begin in FY 2015.

The parties are\nfurther encouraged to actively engage in these negotiations quickly and expeditiously rather than\nallowing them to drag on to the detriment of their relationship and their capacity to move\n\n                                               21\n\fAs proof that ―[t]he City‘s presumption that all [salary] step increases are\n\nimmutable into the future is overly simplistic and not persuasive,‖ the Arbitrator\n\nalluded to a 2012 POFERA arbitration decision wherein the arbitrator reduced\n\nsalaries for certain New Castle County police officers.78 Lastly, the Arbitrator\n\nnoted that City had failed to dispute the FOP‘s argument that the City would\n\nrealize salary savings of approximately $107,606 in FY 2014 due to the City\n\nappropriating money to cover the salaries for two vacant positions—the Chief of\n\nPolice and one Inspector.79\n\n       After reaching these findings of law and fact, the Arbitrator ruled that ―[f]or\n\nall these reasons, I conclude that the City has not established that it has either a\n\nstructural deficit or an inability to afford the costs of the FOP‘s last, best, final\n\noffer.‖80\n\n       F. The PERB Decision\n\n       On September 15, 2014, the City filed its Request for Review of the\n\nArbitrator‘s Decision with the PERB, arguing that the Arbitrator committed three\n\nlegal errors in her decision: (1) the Arbitrator failed to apply the statutory standard\n\nto evaluate the City‘s inability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO by assessing\n\n\nforward to proactively and cooperatively address the public safety challenges facing the City and\nits residents.‖).\n78\n   R. 1370–71.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                               22\n\fthe City‘s ―ability to afford‖ the FOP‘s LBFO rather than the City‘s financial\n\nability to meet the costs based on existing revenues; (2) the Arbitrator improperly\n\nfound that the Unassigned Fund Balance constitutes ―existing revenue;‖ and (3) the\n\nArbitrator erred by not considering the continuing nature of the salary increases in\n\nthe FOP‘s LBFO beyond FY 2014.81 The PERB convened a public hearing on\n\nOctober 9, 2014, at which time the PERB met in public session to consider the\n\nmerits of the City‘s appeal and to hear oral arguments by the parties.82\n\n       On October 23, 2014, the PERB issued a written decision unanimously\n\naffirming the arbitration decision.83 First, the PERB found that the Arbitrator had\n\nproperly focused on whether there were existing revenues to meet the costs of the\n\nFOP‘s proposal, as evidenced by her analysis as to whether the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance was a reserve under City of Seaford.84 Second, the PERB found that the\n\nArbitrator had correctly applied City of Seaford to find that the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance is not a reserve, and thus ―is not excluded as ‗existing revenues.‘‖ 85 The\n\nPERB also rejected a new argument the City raised on appeal86 that, even if the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance is not a reserve, it still does not constitute ―existing\n\n81\n   See R. 1388–89.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1428</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span>\n   <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1429</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n84\n   See R. 1429–30.\n85\n   See 1429–31.\n86\n    Compare R. 1319–20 (arguing, in post-hearing briefing in the arbitration, only that the\nUnassigned Fund Balance is a reserve), and R. 1349 (same), with R. 1389 (arguing, in the appeal\nto the PERB, that ―even if the Arbitrator is correct in concluding that the [U]nassiged [F]und\n[B]alance does not constitute a reserve, the fact remains that it does not constitute revenue‖).\n\n                                              23\n\frevenues‖ because it is not a stream of revenue ―flowing into the City‘s coffers,‖\n\nfinding that ―[t]he City conflate[d] ‗current revenues‘ with ‗existing revenues‘‖:\n\n         [The City] asserts the decision in Seaford requires a current stream of\n         revenue to meet the additional costs of the last, best, final offer. The\n         statute, however, focuses on the public employer‘s ‗existing\n         revenues.‘ We construe that to mean that the analysis must focus on\n         the City‘s financial landscape based on the sources of revenue it had\n         at the time the analysis is undertaken without regard to its ability to\n         raise additional revenue through taxation or other means. Nothing in\n         the statute requires that the consideration of revenues be limited to the\n         current fiscal year or to any other specific, limited period of time. The\n         logical extension of the City‘s argument would result in the preclusion\n         of any wage increase unless the City offered it.87\n\nFinally, the PERB rejected the City‘s argument that the projected total cost of the\n\nFOP‘s LBFO should include salary increases in FY 2015, reasoning, like the\n\nArbitrator, that the City ―is not prohibited (and is in fact encouraged) to engage in\n\nnegotiations which may modify wages and/or allow for savings in other areas\n\nwhich are necessary to fund or to continue to fund negotiated wage rates.‖88\n\n         G. Procedural History\n\n         On November 7, 2014, the City appealed the PERB decision to this Court.\n\nThe grounds for appeal stated in the City‘s Notice of Appeal were that: (1) the\n\nPERB erred as a matter of law; (2) the PERB erred as a matter of fact; (3) the\n\nPERB acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner; and (4) the PERB‘s decisions\n\n\n\n87\n     R.1430.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1431</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                            24\n\fare not supported by substantial evidence. The issues that the City has presented to\n\nme, however, are purely legal.\n\n       On November 14, 2014, the City notified the PERB of its compliance with\n\nthe PERB decision, including that the City had distributed retroactive salary\n\npayments to the Bargaining Unit members in accordance with the FOP‘s LBFO.89\n\n       I heard oral argument on the City‘s appeal on March 11, 2015.90 Following\n\nargument, I issued a brief letter to the parties informing them that I was still\n\nunclear as to how the term ―existing revenues‖ in </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1615(d)(6) was\n\nsupposed to apply in the context of arbitrating retrospective CBAs, and offering\n\nthem the opportunity to submit supplemental briefing on this narrow issue of\n\nstatutory interpretation. Those additional memoranda were fully submitted by\n\nMarch 25, 2015.\n\n       H. The Parties’ Contentions\n\n       The City challenges three aspects of the Arbitrator‘s, and thus also the\n\nPERB‘s, decision:\n\n          First, the decisions disregard the statutory standard (―The financial\n       ability of the public employer, based on existing revenues, to meet the\n       costs of any proposed settlement‖), and substitute the standard of\n       ―inability to afford the costs of the FOP‘s last, best, final offer.‖\n       Second, the decisions incorrectly determine [that] the cash assets in\n89\n  See R. 1433–34.\n90\n  At the conclusion of oral argument, I asked the parties to submit a stipulation as to the City‘s\nGeneral Fund net operating surpluses or deficits for FY 2011 to FY 2014 and projected net\noperating surpluses or deficits for FY 2015 and FY 2016.

Third, the\n          decisions refuse to acknowledge that the salary increases in the FOP‘s\n          proposal are recurring, and will persist in [FY 2015], and in all\n          likelihood beyond [FY 2015].91\n\n          Should this Court rule in its favor, the City contends that the record is\n\nsufficient to demonstrate that it is unable to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO,\n\nand, since this factor is dispositive under Section 1615(d), that the Court must\n\nreverse the Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s decisions and implement the City‘s LBFO\n\nin its entirety. The FOP responds that both the Arbitrator and the PERB correctly\n\napplied the provisions of the POFERA, and that the Court should affirm their\n\nrespective decisions.\n\n                 1. ―Ability to Afford‖ Standard versus the Statutory Standard\n\n          The City argues that, in looking to whether the City could meet the costs of\n\nthe FOP‘s LBFO, both the Arbitrator and the PERB mischaracterized assets in the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance as existing revenues, causing them both to decide the\n\nissue according to a standard of whether the City could ―afford‖ the costs based on\n\ncash on hand, rather than the statutory standard required by Section 1615(d)(6).92\n\n          The FOP counters that both the Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s analysis on the\n\nCity‘s financial ability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO was based on existing\n\n\n\n\n91\n     See City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of Its Appeal at 10–11 (citations omitted).\n92\n     See, e.g., id. at 11–13.\n\n                                                 26\n\frevenues.93 Essentially, the FOP argues that any reference to the City‘s ability to\n\n―afford‖ the proposal was merely shorthand for the statutory standard.\n\n      As the parties‘ arguments indicate, the resolution of this issue is, at least\n\npotentially, dependent upon resolution of whether the assets accounted for in the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance are statutory ―existing revenues.‖ In other words, if I\n\nfind that the Arbitrator and the PERB gauged the City‘s financial ability to meet\n\nthe costs of the FOP‘s proposal based on the Unassigned Fund Balance, the\n\nquestion of whether that was an improper standard will depend on whether the\n\nterm ―existing revenues‖ applies to the Unassigned Fund Balance. If I find that the\n\nArbitrator and the PERB did not apply the proper statutory standard, I must still\n\nconsider whether those legal errors were material to the outcome of the decisions.\n\n             2. The Unassigned Fund Balance as ―Existing Revenues‖\n\n      The City renews both its arguments from the PERB proceedings regarding\n\nthe categorization of the Unassigned Fund Balance, arguing that the Unassigned\n\nFund Balance is a reserve—and thus categorically prohibited from being\n\nconsidered as existing revenues—and that, even if it is not a reserve, the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance does not include existing revenues.94 As to its first\n\nargument, the City contends that the Unassigned Fund Balance meets the City of\n\n\n93\n   Answering Br. of Appellee-Below Appellee Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 1 at 25–30. But\nsee notes 102–108 and accompanying text.\n94\n   See City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of Its Appeal at 14–18.\n\n                                            27\n\fSeaford criteria for a reserve, in that annual operating surpluses are, ―by operation\n\nof law, set aside‖ into the Unassigned Fund Balance and that use of those assets\n\nrequires the approval of Council.95 As to its second argument, the City contends\n\nthat the Unassigned Fund Balance does not meet the City of Seaford criteria for\n\nexisting revenues, in that prior years‘ accumulated surplus is not ―dynamic in\n\ncharacter,‖ does not ―constitute[] a flow of moneys‖ into the City‘s coffers, and is\n\nnot an ―existing, stable and continuing source[] of revenue.‖96 Rather, according to\n\nthe City, these qualifiers illustrate that ―existing revenues‖ must be interpreted to\n\nmean projected or actual revenues sufficient to meet the costs of the proposal in the\n\nyear or years that those costs are to be incurred by the City if the proposal is\n\nadopted.97 Here, because ―the City was ordered to pay salary increases in a fiscal\n\nyear ([FY 2014]) when there was a deficit, . . . [there are] no existing revenues to\n\npay the salary increases.‖98\n\n       Additionally, in its supplemental briefing, the City raises for the first time\n\nthe argument that ―applying the ability to pay based upon existing revenues criteria\n\nretroactively is unworkable.‖99 The City argues that the term ―existing revenues‖\n\ninherently means projected revenues at the time of the arbitration and is\n\n95\n   Id. at 14–15.\n96\n   Id. at 15 (quoting Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 v.

Recurring Costs of the FOP‘s LBFO\n\n          The City argues that, in determining the ―costs of any proposed settlements‖\n\nas required by Section 1615(d)(6), the Arbitrator and the PERB should have\n\nincluded costs for fiscal years following the effective term of the FOP‘s LBFO, at\n\nthe very least for FY 2015. According to the City, although the FOP‘s proposed\n\nCBA expires in FY 2014, the salary increase it contains will actually carry over\n\ninto FY 2015 because the parties already have such a late start on negotiating a\n\nsuccessor CBA, and therefore the Arbitrator and the PERB were obligated to\n\ninclude FY 2015 costs in the total cost of the FOP‘s proposal.109                 The City\n\ncontends that the Arbitrator‘s characterization of the its projected FY 2015 costs as\n\n―purely speculative,‖ ―overly simplistic,‖ and ―not persuasive‖ ignores the realities\n\nthat arbitration decision was issued two months after—and the PERB decision four\n\n107\n      Supplemental Mem. of Appellee-Below, Appellee Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #1 at 12–\n13.\n108\n      Id. at 13 (emphasis added).\n109\n      See City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of Its Appeal at 18–20.\n\n                                                31\n\fmonths after—the expiration of the term of the FOP‘s proposal; that the ―law\n\nrequires that any step increases be maintained pending the negotiation of a\n\nsuccessor agreement;‖ that the ―FOP almost certainly will not agree to roll back the\n\nincreases;‖ that ―[i]n the absence of agreement to roll back the increases, it\n\nnormally takes at least several months to negotiate an impasse;‖ that the ―parties\n\nmust then go through mediation;‖ and that it took in this case ―over 8 months from\n\nthe initiation of binding interest arbitration to get a decision.‖110\n\n       The FOP does not directly address in briefing the issue of whether salary\n\ncosts for FY 2015 must be included in the total costs of the FOP‘s LBFO. Instead,\n\nit argues that, in any event, ―the Arbitrator clearly considered the $57,010\n\nestimated costs for FY 2015 in light of the more than $5 million cash in the\n\nUnassigned Fund [Balance] and the projected operating surplus of $1,125,905 for\n\nFY 2015.‖111\n\n                            II.

In her decision, the Arbitrator ruled\n\nthat the ―[U]nassigned [F]und [B]alance does not constitute a reserve,‖ but she\n\nnever expressly spoke to whether the Unassigned Fund Balance constitutes existing\n\nrevenues, perhaps interpreting the holding in City of Seaford to create a dichotomy\n\nbetween the two terms, under which all cash assets are either ―reserves‖ or\n\n―existing revenues.‖123      Her ruling is also clearly directed towards the entire\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance, though she does note at the beginning of her analysis\n\nthat the Unassigned Fund Balance is only partly composed of cash assets.124 In\n\naffirming the Arbitrator‘s decision, however, the PERB appears to take the\n\nArbitrator‘s ruling further, portraying the Arbitrator as having implicitly held that\n\nthe cash assets accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance constitute existing\n\nrevenues, and itself endorsing this more specific position.125 In any event, I need\n\nnot consider how to resolve this discrepancy between the decisions, because the\n\nparties have proceeded in this appeal as if both the Arbitrator and the PERB held\n\n\n\n\n123\n    See R. 1368.\n124\n    See R. 1366–67, 1368.\n125\n    See R. 1430 (―The Arbitrator explicitly determined that the Unassigned Fund Balance was not\na reserve; consequently, it is not excluded as ‗existing revenues‘ under Seaford. We Concur.\nThe Arbitrator determined, based on the City‘s evidence, [that] the Unassigned Fund Balance\nconstitutes the account or fund in which the City accumulates its excess revenues and from\nwhich the City draws funds to meet unanticipated or unfunded expenses in its budget. . . . There\nis no question that the Unassigned Fund Balance Balance‘s cash or cash equivalent is comprised\nof funds from existing revenues. It is and has been a stable source of funding.‖).\n\n                                              35\n\fthat cash assets accounted for in the Unassigned Fund Balance constitute existing\n\nrevenues.126 Thus, that is the specific issue I will consider here.\n\n       In order for a binding interest arbitrator to force a public employer to enter\n\ninto any CBA with a police officers‘ or firefighters‘ union, Section 1615(d) of the\n\nPOFERA requires that the public employer have the financial ability to meet the\n\ncosts of the CBA. Section 1615(d)(6) provides that the financial ability of the\n\npublic employer is to be determined solely ―based on [the public employer‘s]\n\nexisting revenues.‖ The FOP argues that the Arbitrator and the PERB correctly\n\ndetermined that, as a matter of law, all of the cash assets accounted for by the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance constitute existing revenues, principally because these\n\nassets are made up of prior years‘ surplus revenues. The City contends that these\n\nrulings constituted legal error because the Unassigned Fund Balance is a reserve\n\nor, in the alternative, because only revenues from the year or years that the costs of\n\nthe proposed CBA are to actually be incurred by the City may constitute existing\n\nrevenues. I do not find either party‘s argument fully persuasive, but I ultimately\n\nagree with the City that the Arbitrator and the PERB erred as a matter of law in\n\n\n\n126\n    See, e.g., City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of its Appeal at 10 (―Second, the\ndecisions incorrectly determine [that] the cash assets in the Unassigned Fund Balance are\nexisting revenues.‖); cf. Answering Br. of Appellee-Below Appellee Fraternal Order of Police\nLodge 1 at 34 (―Accordingly, based upon the evidence presented, the authorities referenced and\nthe rationale applied thereto, FOP #1 submits that the Arbitrator and the [PERB] properly found\nthat cash in the Unassigned Fund Balance represents surplus revenue (not an explicitly-allocated\nprotected reserve).‖).\n\n                                              36\n\fruling that the cash assets accounted for in the Unassigned Fund Balance\n\ncategorically constitute existing revenues.\n\n                 1. Revenues, Reserves, and Existing Revenues\n\n          In conducting my analysis under this issue, I am guided by this Court‘s\n\ndecision in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5. There, the court reviewed a PERB\n\ndecision affirming an arbitrator‘s ruling that New Castle County could not meet the\n\ncosts of a union‘s LBFO. En route to her conclusion, the arbitrator below ruled\n\nthat certain assets held in reserves by the County did not constitute existing\n\nrevenues under Section 1615(d)(6) and, ultimately, that the County did not have\n\nsufficient existing revenues to meet the costs of the union‘s proposal because\n\nbudget forecasts indicated that County would run a deficit in the two fiscal years\n\ncovered by the proposal, FY 2012 and FY 2013.127 In analyzing whether the\n\narbitrator properly applied the statutory standard under Section 1615(d)(6), the\n\ncourt noted that the arbitrator below had relied on the following discussion of\n\nrevenues, reserves, and the statutory term ―existing revenues‖ previously set forth\n\nin the City of Seaford arbitration decision:\n\n              Revenue is dynamic in character. It constitutes a flow of moneys,\n          in this case, into the City[ of Seaford]‘s coffers. Revenues from the\n          electricity, water and sewer enterprise funds consist of net income\n          (operating and non-operating revenues less operating expenses), or\n          ―profits‖ in the vernacular.

Funds are reserved or allocated\n       to reserves through an affirmative act of the governing body.\n       Likewise, how those reserves are expended, invested, or allocated is\n       also within the exclusive authority of the City‘s governing body.\n\n           The term ―existing revenues‖ limits the Interest Arbitrator to\n       considering revenues, based on existing fee and taxation rates. It is\n       beyond the scope of the Arbitrator‘s authority to consider whether\n       such rates should or could be increased, whether other expenses\n       should or could be decreased or reallocated, and/or whether existing\n       reserves should or could be allocated to fund the proposals. While it\n       is certainly within the authority of the governing body of a public\n       employer to make any of these choices subject to the political will of\n       its citizenry, it is not within the province of the Interest Arbitrator\n       under the [POFERA].128\n\n       After conducting its own review of the POFERA, the Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice, Lodge 5 court concluded that the City of Seaford arbitrator‘s ―discussion of\n\nwhat constitutes ‗existing revenues‘ within the meaning of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1615(d)(6)\n\nis well-reasoned and persuasive,‖ and specifically that the ―arbitrator‘s approach\n\nwas guided by, and consistent with, this Court‘s precedent regarding statutory\n\ninterpretation.‖129 Based on the City of Seaford arbitrator‘s definitions, as well as\n\n\n128\n     Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">351009</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *6 (quoting City of Seaford v.\nFraternal Order of Police, Lodge 9, IV PERB 2659, 2675–76 (July 15, 2002) (Decision of the\nInterest Arbitrator on Remand)).\n129\n    Id. at *6.

Therefore, the\n          relevant inquiry was whether the County could afford FOP 5‘s\n          proposal throughout its entire two-year duration. The County\n          submitted unchallenged evidence that it was projecting a $5.1 million\n          deficit in the 2013 fiscal year if FOP 5 accepted the 2.5% concession\n          and a $5.7 million deficit if it did not. An actual deficit of even half\n          that amount would have exceeded the County‘s projected 2012 budget\n          surplus. Because a reasonable arbitrator could have found the\n          County‘s budget forecasts credible, it follows that the record before\n          the Arbitrator and the PERB contained evidence sufficient to support\n          a reasonable determination that the County could not afford to pay for\n          the FOP 5‘s proposal over the entirety of its two-year duration.131\n\n                    2. The Unassigned Fund Balance Is Not a Reserve\n\n          Based on the bright-line rule set forth in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5,\n\nthe City argues that the assets accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance meet\n\nthe City of Seaford‘s criteria for reserves and thus categorically cannot be\n\nconsidered existing revenues. That argument, however, is without merit.\n\n          As made clear by the Director of the OMB, Robert Greco, in the arbitration\n\nproceedings, the Unassigned Fund Balance is not a specific account or set of\n\naccounts wherein assets are held, but rather it is an accounting function that tallies\n\nnet assets of a certain classification across the General Fund. The City Council\n\ndoes not and cannot set aside, save, or reserve assets in the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance through an affirmative act, because the Unassigned Fund Balance is just a\n\nnumerical value that exists only on the City‘s financial statements. It is not even a\n\nvalue that accounts for assets in the General Fund that the City Council has set\n\n131\n      Id. at *10.\n\n                                             40\n\faside, saved, or reserved through an affirmative act; rather, the specific parameters\n\nof the Unassigned Fund Balance exclude such assets from being included in its\n\nvalue. Put simply, the Unassigned Fund Balance is no more than a tally of net\n\nassets in the General Fund not allocated to be spent or placed in a reserve.\n\nTherefore, I do not find that the Unassigned Fund Balance is itself a reserve, nor\n\ncan any of the assets for which it accounts be considered reserves.\n\n             3. The Cash Assets Included in the Unassigned Fund Balance Are Not\n             ―Existing Revenues‖\n\n      Just because the cash assets included in the Unassigned Fund Balance are\n\nnot reserves, however, does not necessarily mean that they are ―existing revenues.‖\n\nNeither Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 nor City of Seaford imposes a rule that\n\na specific asset must either be a reserve or existing revenue, only that any reserved\n\nasset cannot be considered existing revenue.           Thus, it is appropriate to\n\nindependently consider whether the cash assets included in the Unassigned Fund\n\nBalance are ―existing revenues.‖\n\n      The FOP initially argued, consistent with the rulings of the Arbitrator and\n\nthe PERB, that the cash assets included in the Unassigned Fund Balance are\n\n―existing revenues‖ because the source of the Unassigned Fund Balance is\n\nrevenues; it points out that the Unassigned Fund Balance is merely the\n\naccumulation of prior years‘ surplus revenues. This surely is true, but it also\n\nhighlights the problem with the Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s‘ reasoning.\n\n\n                                         41\n\f―Revenue‖ inherently involves a temporal aspect: It is the amount of money an\n\nentity receives over a specific period of time.132 This is what is meant by the\n\narbitrator‘s observation in City of Seaford that ―[r]evenue is dynamic in character‖\n\nand that ―[i]t constitutes a flow of moneys, in this case, into the City[of Seaford‘s]\n\ncoffers.‖133 The magnitude of that movement cannot be calculated in a vacuum;\n\nthere must be a definitive beginning and ending point for the calculation. Hence,\n\nthe Arbitrator and the PERB are correct that the cash assets in the Unassigned\n\nFund Balance originated as revenues during certain periods of time in the past, but\n\nthey are incorrect to say that those assets are categorically revenues in the\n\npresent.134\n\n       The modifier ―existing‖ does not change this ordinary, temporal meaning of\n\nrevenues such that ―existing revenues‖ becomes a static concept. As the arbitrator\n\nin City of Seaford illuminated, and as the FOP acknowledges in its supplemental\n\nbriefing, the modifier ―existing‖ merely limits the scope of potential revenues that\n\n\n132\n    See id. at *5 & n.28 (noting that the arbitrator in City of Seaford relied on the dictionary\ndefinitions of ―revenues‖ as ―the yield of income that a political unit collects and receives into\nthe treasury for public use,‖ and ―income‖ as ―a gain or recurrent benefit, usually measured in\nmoney that derives from capital or labor; also, the amount of such gain received in a period of\ntime‖); see also City of Seaford, IV PERB at 2674 (quoting Merriam Webster’s Collegiate\nDictionary 558, 1002 (10th Ed. 1996)).\n133\n    Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">351009</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *6.\n134\n    This distinction is further highlighted by basic principles of accounting. An entity records its\nrevenues in an income statement, which tracks profitability of the entity over a specified period\nof time, based on the entity‘s revenues and expenditures over that period. The entity‘s balance\nsheet—wherein the Unassigned Fund Balance is found—does not record revenues; rather, it\nprovides a snapshot of the entity‘s financial position at a specific point in time, based on the\nentity‘s assets and liabilities at that moment.\n\n                                                42\n\fthe arbitrator may consider in gauging the City‘s financial ability to meet the costs\n\nof any proposal.135         Specifically, the term ―existing revenues‖ confines the\n\narbitrator‘s analysis to revenues that are ―based on existing fee and taxation rates‖\n\nas a means to prevent the arbitrator from overriding the Council‘s legislative\n\nauthority to raise, appropriate, and set aside funds.136 It ensures, in other words,\n\nthat the arbitrator does not usurp this core legislative function; it requires that the\n\narbitrator take into account the information available at the time of the arbitration\n\nand, based on that information, consider only those revenues that have already\n\nbeen ordained by the City. In looking at that snapshot of information, however, the\n\narbitrator cannot identify any particular revenues without first narrowing her\n\nsearch to a specific period of time, the time to be covered by the LBFO. In other\n\n\n135\n    See id.

[T]he only reasonably conclusion is that Delaware substituted the phrase ‗based on\nexisting revenues‘ as a shorthand method of indicating that any award cannot mandate an\nincrease or imposition of new taxes, fees, charges or other sources of revenue, the imposition of\nwhich remains in the discretion of the legislative body[,] but, instead, financial ability to pay\nmust be based upon existing or proposed revenue, i.e., taxes, fees, charges or other sources of\nrevenue.‖).\n\n                                                43\n\fwords, ―existing revenues‖ are still ―revenues;‖ they are still ―dynamic in\n\ncharacter‖ and can only be ascertained in reference to a specific span of time.\n\n       An analogy may help to clarify the point. Consider two retirees on a fixed\n\npension: In year X, Retiree A receives $60,000 per year and has no productive\n\nassets; Retiree B receives $50,000 per year and has $500,000 invested with a fixed\n\nreturn of 2%. What are the revenues of Retiree A and Retiree B in year X? Both\n\nhave a dynamic inflow of funds of $60,000; this is their revenue. Retiree B has\n\nsaved half a million dollars from past income—past revenue—and is undeniably\n\nwealthier than Retiree B, but revenue in year X to each is the same. The fact that\n\nmany years ago Retiree B had revenue streams from which, unlike Retiree A, he\n\nretained a surplus does not make that surplus part of his revenue in year X,\n\nalthough the interest which flows to him each year from that surplus is revenue.\n\n       The Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s decisions ignore the plain meaning of the\n\nword ―revenues‖ by categorically applying the term ―existing revenues‖ to the cash\n\nassets accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance as those assets presently\n\nexist in static form in various accounts across the General Fund, without regard to\n\nwhen those assets actually flowed to the City.137 In doing so, the Arbitrator and the\n\nPERB conflate ―existing assets‖ with ―existing revenues.‖ It may be true that the\n\nCity itself can, and occasionally has, used its existing assets to finance\n\n137\n   See, e.g., R. 1430 (―Nothing in the statute requires that the consideration of revenues be\nlimited to the current fiscal year or to any other specific, limited period of time.‖).\n\n                                             44\n\fexpenditures—both through the Mayor including prior years‘ accumulated surplus\n\nin the City‘s revenue projections and the Council appropriating prior years‘\n\naccumulated surplus to make modifications to the budget—but the potential for\n\nthese assets to be expended does not make them revenues. ―Revenue‖ refers to a\n\nflow in over a given time, not a flow out. Rather, assets accounted for by the\n\nUnassigned Fund Balance, like any City asset, can be considered part of the City‘s\n\nprojected revenues only after the City has opted to appropriate them for future\n\nexpenditures, which authority is left to the discretion of the Mayor and the Council,\n\nand not the arbitrator, under the City‘s Charter.\n\n          I note that, although neither the Arbitrator‘s decision nor the PERB‘s\n\ndecision expressly say so, their holdings could be interpreted to imply that an\n\narbitrator should graft onto the POFERA an understanding that, specifically with\n\nrespect to arbitration awards for periods in the past, all prior years‘ revenues,\n\nincluding those now accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance, be available\n\nas ―existing revenues,‖ since the arbitrator could find that the LBFO can be\n\nsatisfied using these assets without changes in taxing/spending policy on the part\n\nof the City. I reject that implication. Nothing in the POFERA as interpreted by\n\nour caselaw is ambiguous here so as to allow departure from the statute‘s express\n\nlanguage; as I describe in my analysis below,138 the revenues from years covered\n\n\n138\n      See infra Part III.A.4.\n\n                                          45\n\fby the FOP‘s LBFO are easily ascertainable and form the outer limit of the\n\npermissible cost, and nothing about that result is absurd or unworkable.139\n\n       Because the cash assets accounted for by the Unassigned Fund Balance are\n\nnot ―existing revenues‖ within the meaning of Section 1615(d)(6), I find that the\n\nArbitrator and the PERB committed legal error by holding otherwise.\n\n               4. ―Existing Revenues‖ Are Those Revenues the City Received\n               During the Term of the Proposed CBA\n\n       Having found that calculation of ―existing revenues‖ inherently requires\n\nconsideration of a specific period of time, however, the question remains as to\n\nwhat specific period of time the Arbitrator should have considered here in gauging\n\nwhether the City had the financial ability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO. As\n\nnoted above, in the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 decision, this Court—as\n\nwell as the arbitrator and the PERB below—held that the ―relevant inquiry‖ under\n\nSection 1615(d)(6) in the context of arbitrating CBAs governing future years\n\n139\n    Even if I were to interpret the statute as ambiguous with respect to past application, the result\nwould be the same. Employing the principle of interpretation found in Seaford Bd. Of Educ. v.\nSeaford Educ. Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">8773</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Del. Ch. Feb. 5, 1988), see infra note 142 and\naccompanying text, I do not find that the term ―existing revenues‖ should be reinterpreted to\ninclude the cash assets included in the Unassigned Fund Balance in the limited context of\narbitrating retroactive CBAs. Section 1615(d)(6) is designed as a control on the collective\nbargaining process to ensure that the costs of any proposal the public employer is forced to\naccept is commensurate with the public employer‘s financial condition during that period, as set\nby the governing legislative body. If the arbitrator were to analyze a union‘s request for\nretroactive salary increases based on the public employer‘s prior years‘ accumulated surplus, it\nwould allow the union to spread the costs of its proposal over years beyond those actually\ncovered by the proposal, granting the union an advantageous bargaining position to which it\nwould not be entitled when arbitrating a CBA for future years. Such an interpretation would\ncreate an incentive for the unions to delay negotiations on CBAs and thus would be inconsistent\nwith the purpose of the POFERA.\n\n                                                46\n\finvolves net existing revenues over the contract period; that is, ―whether the\n\n[public employer] could afford [the union‘s] proposal throughout its entire . . .\n\nduration.‖140 However, also as noted above, the situation here is complicated by\n\nthe fact that the parties are negotiating a retroactive CBA.\n\n          The City makes the argument—for the first time in supplemental briefing—\n\nthat the POFERA reference to ―existing revenues‖ can have no logical application\n\nto past, as opposed to prospective, periods of employment. According to the City,\n\nthe restriction on the arbitrator to choose an offer that can be satisfied from\n\nexisting projected revenues prevents the arbitrator from impinging on a core\n\nlegislative function, but applying the term to past revenues would actually cause\n\nthe arbitrator to impinge on that function.             Specifically, the City argues that\n\napplying the ―existing revenues‖ standard retroactively ―leads to an unreasonable\n\nresult as it would require the public employer to set aside surplus revenues in prior\n\nyears in the event there is a subsequent [POFERA] proceeding, and the arbitrator\n\ndetermines the surplus constitutes ‗existing revenues‘ available to pay for a\n\nretroactive proposal.‖141 Better, according to the City, to judicially rewrite the\n\nstatute to impose the revenue restriction on the future year or years in which the\n\npayment for work in the past will be paid. I reject this argument.\n\n\n\n140\n      Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">351009</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *10.\n141\n      City of Wilmington‘s Supplemental Mem. of Law in Supp. of Its Appeal at 9.\n\n                                               47\n\f          It is true that the POFERA is clearly designed in contemplation that public\n\nemployers and unions will collectively bargain over CBAs to govern their future\n\nrelationships.

In situations where it is ―reasonably plain\n\nthat the legislature had no specific intention with respect to the specific problem\n\nthat later arises,‖ this Court has found that ―the best technique to employ—the one\n\nmost consistent with the special, limited judicial role in our democracy—is for the\n\ncourt to interpret the words used, in a manner consistent both with their ordinary\n\nusage and with the discernible overall intent of the statute.‖142 Employing that\n\nprinciple of statutory interpretation here, it is clear that the City‘s interpretation\n\nwould lead to an unreasonable result. If the arbitrator were to analyze a union‘s\n\nrequest for retroactive salary increases based on the public employer‘s budget in\n\nthe year that it is to make those retroactive payments, it would constrict the union‘s\n\nability to obtain raises over multiple years to the revenues that the public employer\n\ncan generate in a single year, granting the public employer an advantageous\n\nbargaining position to which it would not be entitled when arbitrating CBAs for\n\nprospective terms of employment.

The key difference\n\nbetween the two situations is that in arbitrations over retroactive CBAs the\n\narbitrator will be guided by actual revenue figures for the years covered by the\n\nproposal, as opposed to revenue projections for those years. However, it does not\n\nseem to me that this difference inherently favors either the public employer or the\n\nunion in the collective bargaining process.\n\n\n\n\n143\n    For a discussion of the analogous incentive problem arising from the FOP‘s (initial) argument\nthat all prior years‘ surpluses should be available for retroactive CBAs, see supra note 139.\n144\n    That is, for a LBFO to be paid out of the General Fund, the arbitrator must consider whether\nor not the public employer could pay the net costs of the contract envisioned by the LBFO from\nthe net of actual and/or projected annual operating surpluses or deficits—―existing revenues‖—\nin the General Fund during the years that contract would be in existence.\n\n                                               49\n\f          Furthermore, I do not find persuasive the City‘s argument that applying a\n\nrevenue restriction for retroactive CBAs based on prior years‘ revenues improperly\n\nallows the arbitrator to intrude on the core legislative functions of the City‘s\n\nelected officials by ―[e]ffectively requiring the City to set aside surpluses in prior\n\nfiscal years.‖145 The City‘s concern is not unique to arbitrations over retroactive\n\nCBAs.        It is unchallenged that an arbitrator‘s decision may require a public\n\nemployer to pay for the costs of CBAs covering future years out of surplus\n\nrevenues that the public employer is projected to receive in those years, and thus\n\nmay, under the City‘s reasoning, effectively require the public employer to ―set\n\naside‖ those future revenues for a specific use as they are obtained. If anything,\n\nthere is actually less of a concern that using net surplus revenues over the years\n\ncovered by the contract as a basis for Section 1615(d)(6) will cause an arbitrator to\n\nimpinge on a core legislative function in the context of retroactive CBAs,\n\nconsidering that revenues and expenses in prior years are definitively known, as\n\nopposed to forecasted, and thus the arbitrator cannot overestimate the public\n\nemployer‘s financial ability. Rather, what the City is actually arguing is that\n\napplying the approach laid out in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 in\n\narbitrations over retroactive CBAs will effectively tie up a portion of the City‘s\n\nsurplus assets. I note that such a consequence is not necessarily unreasonable nor\n\n\n145\n      City of Wilmington‘s Supplemental Mem. of Law in Supp. of Its Appeal at 9.\n\n                                               50\n\fshould it be unexpected, considering that, in situations where collective bargaining\n\non a successor CBA has lagged past the termination of the previous CBA, the City\n\nis aware that its cost of labor for these employees is unsettled and, because that\n\ncost is set at a time in the past, likely deflated. In any event, the City‘s concern\n\ndoes not find support in the language or the underlying purpose of the POFERA.\n\n      Therefore, I find that the term ―existing revenues‖ in Section 1615(d)(6)\n\nrequired the Arbitrator in this situation to analyze the City‘s financial ability to\n\nmeet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO using the City‘s revenues in the General Fund\n\nover the duration of the four years covered by that proposal, FY 2011 to FY 2014.\n\n      B. The Arbitrator and the PERB Erred as a Matter of Law in Ruling on the\n      City’s Financial Ability to Meet the Costs of the FOP’s LBFO Based on\n      Factors Other than Existing Revenues\n\n      Having found that the term ―existing revenues‖ refers here to the period\n\ncovered by the FOP‘s LBFO, I turn next to whether the Arbitrator and the PERB\n\napplied an improper standard to gauge the City‘s financial ability to meet the costs\n\nof the FOP‘s LBFO. As a preliminary matter, I note that it is not clear exactly how\n\nthe Arbitrator reached her conclusion that the City did not have ―an inability to\n\nafford the costs of the FOP‘s last, best, final offer.‖ The Arbitrator did not detail\n\nthe calculation that she used or the specific figures upon which she relied for her\n\nconclusion, only that she had reached that conclusion ―[f]or all the[] reasons‖ set\n\nout over the previous seven pages of the decision. For instance, at the beginning of\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\fher analysis, the Arbitrator noted that the FOP had only asked for salary increases\n\nfor Bargaining Unit members in ―FY 2012 and FY 2013, years in which the City\n\naccrued surpluses and increased its unassigned fund balance,‖ and that ―[t]he\n\nrevenue, expenditure and fund balances are known for FY 2011 through FY 2014,\n\nwith the FY 2014 unassigned fund balance projected to be $28,520,703, which\n\nincludes $5,699,343 in cash,‖146 but the decision is silent as to whether—and if so,\n\nhow—any of these pieces of information factored into her final decision that the\n\nCity could afford the FOP‘s proposal; nor does the decision explain how the\n\nprojected savings of approximately $107,606 in FY 2014 from certain vacancies\n\nwithin the City‘s police force factored into the Arbitrator‘s decision.147\n\n       However, assuming, as the PERB appears to in its decision148 and as the\n\nparties do in briefing,149 that the Arbitrator based her ruling that the City could\n\n―afford‖ the FOP‘s LBFO solely on the $5,699,343 in cash assets that was\n\nprojected to be included in the Unassigned Fund Balance at the expiration of FY\n\n2014, I find that the Arbitrator and the PERB did not apply the standard required\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">1367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n147\n     See R. 1371.\n148\n     See R. 1430 (―The Arbitrator determined, based on the City‘s evidence, [that] the Unassigned\nFund Balance constitutes the account or fund in which the City accumulates its excess revenues\nand from which the City draws funds to meet unanticipated or unfunded expenses in its budget.\n . . . There is no question that the Unassigned Fund Balance Balance‘s cash or cash equivalent is\ncomprised of funds from existing revenues. It is and has been a stable source of funding.‖\n(emphasis added)).\n149\n     See, e.g., City of Wilmington‘s Opening Br. in Supp. of Its Appeal at 10, 15–16; Answering\nBr. of Appellee-Below Appellee Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 1 at 34.\n\n                                               52\n\fby Section 1615(d)(6). As I have found above, the Arbitrator and the PERB\n\nshould have evaluated the City‘s financial ability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s\n\nLBFO based on whether the City generated sufficient revenues in the General\n\nFund from FY 2011 to FY 2014.\n\n          C. The Arbitrator and the PERB Did Not Err as a Matter of Law in Holding\n          that FY 2015 Costs Should Not Be Included in the Total Projected Costs of\n          the FOP’s LBFO\n\n          Finally, I turn to the issue of whether FY 2015 costs—and perhaps those\n\nfrom succeeding years as well—should be included in the total projected costs of\n\nthe FOP‘s LBFO. Section 1615(d)(6) requires the Arbitrator and the PERB to\n\nconsider ―[t]he financial ability of the public employer, based on existing revenues,\n\nto meet the costs of any proposed settlements.‖150 The City argues that, as a matter\n\nof law, ―costs of any proposed settlements‖ must be interpreted to include costs of\n\na proposed CBA in non-contract years where, like here, the terms of the proposed\n\nCBA will realistically continue into those non-contract years. As support for its\n\ninterpretation, the City cites a passage from City of Seaford wherein the arbitrator\n\nwas describing the rationale underlying using ―existing revenues‖ to qualify the\n\nCity‘s financial ability meet the costs of any proposal, which passage was cited\n\n\n\n\n150\n      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1615(d)(6) (emphasis added).\n\n                                                  53\n\ffavorably by this Court in Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5 v. New Castle\n\nCounty151:\n\n       There is a very clear and logical reason the General Assembly limited\n       the Interest Arbitrator to consider only ―existing revenues‖ in reaching\n       a determination as to whether a public employer can afford a proposed\n       settlement. Many costs, including those for wages and benefits, are\n       recurring and generally tend to automatically increase annually, either\n       as a result of negotiated provisions of a collective bargaining\n       agreement or due to inflationary pressure on the costs of services or\n       goods an employer has agreed to provide. Consequently, they\n       constitute an on-going and frequently increasing financial\n       obligation.152\n\nAccording to the City, because the parties do not have a CBA in place to succeed\n\nthe FOP‘s proposed CBA and are unlikely to have one in place by the end of FY\n\n2015, and because the City must, by law, honor the terms found in the last year of\n\nthe parties‘ previous CBA until a successor CBA can be executed, the salary\n\nincreases in the FOP‘s LBFO will actually be ―on-going,‖ ―recurring,‖ and\n\n―automatically‖ continued through at least FY 2015, and thus are the type of costs\n\nenvisioned by Section 1615(d)(6). I do not find this argument persuasive.\n\n       The POFERA does not define the phrase ―costs of any proposed settlement‖\n\nas it appears in Section 1615(d)(6), nor does its twin, the PERA, define the phrase\n\nas it appears in identical form in Section 1315(d)(6), 153 nor does this Court‘s\n\n\n151\n    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">351009</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Del. Ch. Jan. 29, 2014).\n152\n    Id. at *6 (quoting City of Seaford v. Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 9, IV PERB 2659, 2676\n(July 15, 2002) (Decision of the Interest Arbitrator on Remand)).\n153\n    See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Del.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. § 1615(d)(6).\n\n                                              54\n\flimited caselaw reviewing PERB decisions under either of these acts define the\n\nphrase. The dictionary definition of ―cost‖ is ―the amount or equivalent paid or\n\ncharged for something.‖154 Based on the plain meaning of ―cost,‖ the phrase ―costs\n\nof any proposed settlement‖ is unambiguous; it can only be reasonably interpreted\n\nto mean the amount of money the City would necessarily expend in order to satisfy\n\nits obligations under the proposed CBA. It unambiguously does not include costs\n\nof the City‘s obligations following the expiration of the proposed CBA, i.e., the\n\namount of money the City will have to expend until the parties execute a different,\n\nsuccessor agreement. In other words, the fact that the City‘s costs to operate\n\nwithin the law in the absence of a CBA may be initially determined by the terms of\n\nthe parties‘ previous CBA does not mean that those are ―costs of‖ the previous\n\nCBA.\n\n       My conclusion in this regard is supported by the fact that, even if the City is\n\nforced to provide pay and benefits to the Bargaining Unit employees in FY 2015\n\nbased on the FY 2014 levels in the FOP‘s LBFO, the parties must still negotiate\n\nand adopt a new CBA to retroactively govern FY 2015, which new CBA will\n\ndictate the actual salaries and benefits the employees were entitled to in FY 2015,\n\n\n\n\n154\n   Webster’s II New College Dictionary 255 (1995); see also Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed.\n2014) (defining ―cost‖ as ―the amount paid or charged for something; price or expenditure‖).\n\n                                            55\n\fand thus the City‘s actual costs in FY 2015.155 The City‘s plea for pragmatism,\n\nthat the Court can be assured that collective bargaining will yield costs in FY 2015\n\nat least on level with FY 2014 because the Bargaining Unit will never agree to\n\nretroactively reduce salaries and benefits, is also unavailing, considering the\n\nBargaining Unit will not be entitled to retain FY 2014 salaries and benefits in any\n\nsuccessor CBA under Section 1615(d)(6) if the City does not have sufficient\n\nrevenues to meet those costs during the period of the successor CBA.156 Even if\n\nthe City can meet those costs in retrospect, the salaries and benefits will still be\n\nsubject to evaluation under the seven factors in Section 1615(d). Thus, while I\n\nhave no doubt that the City will face resistance in any effort to claw back salaries\n\nand benefits in FY 2015, that resistance is of the same variety that the City would\n\nface in attempting to avoid salary and benefit increases that it could afford in\n\nCBAs with prospective contract terms; at the very least, this resistance is not so\n\nmaterially different in the context of negotiating retroactive CBAs as to constitute\n\nan ―unreasonable or absurd result‖ that would cause this Court to ignore the plain\n\nmeaning of the statute‘s language.157 Therefore, I find that the Arbitrator and the\n\n\n\n155\n    The same principle applies if the parties‘ negotiations over a successor agreement stretch past\nFY 2015.\n156\n    See supra Part III.A.4.\n157\n    This specific collective bargaining dispute illustrates my point. Here, whereas the FOP‘s\nLBFO included a modest cost-of-living adjustment in prior years, the City‘s LBFO included no\ncost-of-living adjustment and called for an increase in employee contributions to healthcare costs\nin then-future years, effecting a prospective reduction in the City‘s costs in those years. The\n\n                                                56\n\fPERB did not err as a matter of law in excluding FY 2015 costs from its\n\ncalculation of the total projected costs of the FOP‘s LBFO.\n\n       D. Applying the Proper Standard, the FOP’s LBFO Is Not Disqualified\n       Under Section 1615(d)(6)\n\n       Having determined the applicable standard under Section 1615(d)(6), as well\n\nas the appropriate estimation of the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO, I turn to considering\n\nwhether the City had the financial ability to meet the costs of the FOP‘s LBFO.\n\nThe record on appeal is sufficient to find that, though the Arbitrator and the PERB\n\napplied the wrong standard in the decisions below, their ultimate determination\n\nthat the City could meet the costs of the FOP‘s proposal was correct. The parties\n\nstipulated that, as to the City‘s General Fund, the City had a net operating surplus\n\nof $6,055,527 in FY 2011; a net operating surplus of $7,444,088 in FY 2012; a net\n\noperating surplus of $1,326,984 in FY 2013; and a net operating deficit of\n\n$1,170,833 in FY 2014.         Netting these throughout the four-year duration of the\n\nFOP‘s proposal—as I must under the rationale of Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge\n\n5—the City had a net operating surplus in the General Fund of $13,655,766 from\n\nFY 2011 to FY 2014, more than sufficient to cover the proposal‘s estimated costs\n\nof $127,648.\n\n\n\n\nCity‘s own position in this collective bargaining dispute, then, illustrates that costs are not\nnecessarily ―locked in‖ in from contract to contract.\n\n\n\n                                              57\n\f                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the PERB is reversed in part and\n\naffirmed in part. Although I have found that the Arbitrator‘s and the PERB‘s legal\n\nerrors were ultimately insignificant in their consideration of whether the FOP‘s\n\nLBFO should be disqualified under Section 1615(d)(6), I am hesitant to enter a\n\nfinal judgment in this matter based on that conclusion. A POFERA arbitrator, after\n\ndetermining that the parties‘ LBFOs are not disqualified under subsection (d)(6), is\n\ngiven discretion to choose between the proposals based on a balancing of the other\n\nSection 1615(d) factors. Though the Arbitrator here has already exercised that\n\ndiscretion and selected the FOP‘s proposal, it is unclear to me to what extent the\n\nlegal rulings in this Memorandum Opinion may affect the balancing of the other\n\nSection 1615(d) factors, and thus to what extent an entry of final judgment in this\n\nCourt at this point in the proceedings would tread on the Arbitrator‘s statutory\n\ndiscretion. Therefore, the parties should confer and inform the Court whether a\n\nremand to the Arbitrator is appropriate in light of this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n      IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        58\n\f</pre>",
