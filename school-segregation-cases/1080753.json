Specifically, Appellants contend that the City\n\nfailed to annex the housing project for racial reasons in violation of the First,\n\nThirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\n\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964 and its implementing regulations. After extensive pre-trial proceedings, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees, the City of Belle\n\nGlade and others, on all counts, finding neither a constitutional nor a statutory\n\nviolation.\n\n      On appeal, Appellants challenge the district court’s order on three basic\n\ngrounds: first, the district court purportedly erred in concluding that Appellants failed\n\nto raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Appellees’ discriminatory intent; second,\n\nthe district court also erred in holding that the remedies they sought -- including the\n\nunusual remedy of ordering a city to annex property into its municipal boundaries --\n\nwere neither available under the Voting Rights Act nor permissible under the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure; and finally, the district court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment sua sponte to Appellees on Appellants’ Title VI claims. After thoroughly\n\nreviewing the record and the parties’ briefs, we affirm the district court’s judgment\n\nconcerning Appellants’ constitutional and Voting Rights Act claims, as well as the\n\nTitle VI statutory claim, but reverse and remand Appellants’ cause of action to enforce\n\n                                           2\n\fTitle VI’s disparate impact regulations for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n                                         I.\n\n      The historical facts and the procedural history necessary to understand this\n\nlawsuit are complex and extensive. At the core, however, this legal battle has been\n\nfought over the refusal of the City of Belle Glade (“City”) to annex an adjacent\n\nhousing project known as the Okeechobee Center Farmers’ Home Administration\n\nProject (“Okeechobee Center”) into its geographic and municipal boundaries.\n\n      The City of Belle Glade is an incorporated municipality located on the western\n\nside of Palm Beach County, near Florida’s agricultural heartland. In the 1930s, the\n\nfederal government created two housing projects outside the city limits. One of them,\n\nknown as the Osceola Center, was populated by whites and stood at the City’s\n\nnorthwest corner. The other, the Okeechobee Center, was populated by blacks and\n\nwas located to the southwest of the City. In 1947, the City created the Belle Glade\n\nHousing Authority (“BGHA”), a board of seven members nominated by the mayor\n\nand appointed by the City Commission, to address the “shortage of safe sanitary\n\ndwelling accommodations in the City of Belle Glade available to persons of low\n\nincome at rentals they can afford.” The BGHA assumed ownership and operation of\n\nboth the Osceola and Okeechobee Centers. The centers, however, remain funded in\n\n                                         3\n\fpart by the federal government through grants from the Department of Agriculture.\n\n“Jim Crow” laws required both housing projects to be segregated by race.1 During\n\nthis time, the City also mandated residential segregation. See, e.g., Belle Glade, Fla.,\n\nOrdinance 45, 184, 273, 443 (Nov. 18, 1931, Sept. 18, 1936, January 12, 1938,\n\nDecember 27, 1939). These ordinances were repealed, however, by 1963. See Belle\n\nGlade, Fla., Ordinance 63-11, § 1 (April 24, 1963) (repealing Belle Glade, Fla., Code\n\n§§ 26-14 to -17 (relating to zoning)).\n\n       In 1960, the total population of the City of Belle Glade was 11,273, of which\n\n7,393 (65.6%) were non-whites and 3,880 (34.4%) were whites.2 The following year,\n\nthe City proposed, for the first time, extending its municipal boundaries by annexing\n\nboth the Okeechobee and Osceola Centers. The City asked the property owner,\n\n\n       1\n        In March 1975, however, a group of tenants brought suit in federal district court\nagainst the Secretary of Agriculture and various local housing authorities under Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 to integrate the centers. See Mae Golden Acres Tenants’ Ass’n\nv. Butz, No. 75-1161-CIV-JE (S.D. Fla. 1975). On July 19, 1977, the district court entered\na stipulation for consent judgment in the Mae Golden Acres litigation, which provided that\nthe BGHA would no longer segregate the Osceola and Okeechobee Centers by race and\nwould administer the projects according to racially non-discriminatory policies. This\nsettlement marked the formal end of de jure segregation at the Osceola and Okeechobee\nCenters.\n       2\n       As of 1970, the total population of Belle Glade increased to 15,949, of which the\npercentage of blacks decreased to 52.9% while the percentage of whites increased to 46.5%.\nBy 1993, a special census showed that the City’s total population had increased further to\n17,208, the population of blacks increasing to 54.8% and the white population decreasing to\n39.6%. As of May 24, 1994, the population of the Osceola Center was 46% black, 50%\nHispanic, and 4% white, whereas the population of the Okeechobee Center was 92% black\nand 8% Hispanic.\n\n                                             4\n\fBGHA, whether it had any views on the matter. After discussing the possible\n\nadvantages and disadvantages, the BGHA ultimately petitioned to the City only for\n\nannexation of the Osceola Center. Soon thereafter, on April 26, 1961, the City\n\nCommission considered the BGHA’s petition and unanimously annexed the Osceola\n\nCenter.\n\n      In the 1970s, the City and the BGHA twice considered the possibility of\n\nannexing the Okeechobee Center. In 1971, the City Commission’s minutes simply\n\nreflect that a meeting was to be arranged between the City Commission and the\n\nBGHA to discuss the possibility of annexing the Okeechobee Center. The minutes\n\nmake no mention, however, of who made the annexation request or whether any\n\nmeeting was ever held. Two years later, on February 26, 1973, a group of tenants\n\nfrom the Okeechobee Center asked the City Commission to annex the center. The\n\nCity Commission advised the tenants that it would consider annexation if the BGHA\n\nmade the request. On April 17, 1973, the tenants asked the BGHA to petition the City\n\nfor annexation, but the BGHA denied their request in October 1973. The record does\n\nnot reflect whether the BGHA offered any reason for denying the request.\n\n      The following year, the Florida legislature repealed all local laws pertaining to\n\nthe adjustment of municipal boundaries and established a uniform legislative standard\n\nfor use throughout the state. See Municipal Annexation or Contraction Act, 1974 Fla.\n\nLaws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. §§ 171.021-.022 (West\n\n                                          5\n\f1987)). The statute specifically provided for the voluntary annexation of any property\n\ncontiguous to a municipality upon petition by the property owner to the municipality’s\n\ngoverning body. See 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla.\n\nStat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West Supp. 1998)). The City Commission also could initiate\n\nannexation of any contiguous, compact, and unincorporated property by a referendum\n\nof the registered voters of the municipality and the residents of the area proposed to\n\nbe annexed. See 1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-297, § 2 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 171.0413 (West. 1987 & Supp. 1998)).                 Notably, according to these\n\nprovisions, the statute prohibited municipalities from annexing any property that did\n\nnot meet the statute’s definition of contiguity. See 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1\n\n(codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.031(11) (West 1987)).3\n\n       Two attempts to secure the City’s annexation of the Okeechobee Center through\n\nlitigation occurred in 1980.4 Pursuant to a settlement agreement, the City and City\n\nCommission agreed to appoint an “Annexation Committee” to investigate and make\n\n\n       3\n        The parties dispute whether the Okeechobee Center is contiguous to the City, and,\nhence, available for annexation under Florida law. See discussion infra Part II.B.2.\n       4\n        In Okeechobee Center Cries for Help v. Belle Glade Housing Authority, No. 80-\n8220-CIV-JAG (S.D. Fla. 1980), tenants of the Okeechobee Center sued the City and the\nBGHA seeking, inter alia, a mandatory injunction requiring the defendants to take all steps\nnecessary to annex the Okeechobee Center into Belle Glade. Similarly, in Jackson v. City\nof Belle Glade, No. 80-8156-CIV-JAG (S.D. Fla. 1980), some Belle Glade residents brought\nsuit against the City and BGHA, seeking annexation of all black areas adjacent to the City\nThe parties eventually resolved both lawsuits prior to trial without the plaintiffs’ obtaining\nannexation and, in March 1984, the court dismissed the suits with prejudice.\n\n                                              6\n\frecommendations concerning the wisdom and efficacy of annexing the Okeechobee\n\nCenter.5 In November 1984, after the Committee held public hearings, received\n\ncomments from the public, investigated and considered the possibilities and\n\nramifications of annexation, and conducted a cost study of annexation, the Committee\n\nissued a report recommending against annexation on the grounds that the Okeechobee\n\nCenter did not satisfy Florida’s statutory contiguity requirement and that annexation\n\ndid not make reasonable economic sense for the City.6 However, the report also urged\n\nthe City Commission to consider other factors “relating to the humanitarian aspects\n\nof those residing in Okeechobee Center” in light of residents’ feelings “that\n\nannexation would right past ‘wrongs.’” On January 28, 1985, the City Commission\n\nofficially accepted the Annexation Committee’s report.\n\n       As far as the record reflects, the tenants’ efforts at annexing the Okeechobee\n\nCenter lay dormant for over ten years, until May 8, 1995, when Albert Peterson, a\n\nresident of the Okeechobee Center and President of the Resident’s Council of the\n\n\n       5\n        The City Commission appointed five members to this Committee: one member of the\nOkeechobee Center Tenant’s Association, one black resident of the City as recommended\nby the Panhellenic Council, and three additional members, at least one of whom had to be\na member of a minority group.\n       6\n         Specifically, the report estimated the following capital outlay and first year start-up\ncosts: library services, $158,693; inspection, $8,000; fire, $442,000; streets $7,140; building\nand grounds, $18,640; garbage collection, $138,483; police, $133,724; and parks and\nrecreation, $119, 556. Thus, the total estimated costs were $1,026,236. The report further\nestimated that the property would generate miscellaneous revenues for the City of $126,000\nper year.\n\n                                               7\n\fOkeechobee and Osceola Centers, wrote Mayor Weeks requesting that the City annex\n\nthe Okeechobee Center. On May 30, 1995, the Mayor denied Peterson’s request,\n\nconcluding that annexation would be “neither feasible nor advantageous to the City\n\nfrom the financial and public services perspective.” The Mayor’s letter summarized\n\nthe findings of “[a] study of this issue that was done a number of years ago”:\n\n                    Upon annexation, the City must provide the\n             following municipal services: water, sewer, police\n             protection, sanitation services, street lighting, street signs,\n             street paving, maintenance, drainage, parks and recreation.\n             Since the subject land is exempt from ad valorem taxes, no\n             property taxes would be generated to offset the cost of\n             providing the necessary services, which far outweigh any\n             miscellaneous revenues that might be realized.\n\n                     Other factors in determining the viability of annexing\n             the parcel included the following: 1) No need exists to\n             expand into the proposed parcel, 2) No industry would be\n             annexed, 3) The parcel would provide no additional\n             facilities to be brought into the City, 4) Annexation would\n             not improve the economy of the City, and 5) The\n             Comprehensive Plan would have to be revised thereby\n             compounding the expense to the City.\n\n                   City Attorney John Baker’s legal opinion was that\n             the City may not annex the property known as the\n             Okeechobee Center because the said property is not\n             contiguous to the municipal boundaries, and annexation is\n             therefore prohibited by Florida statutes.\n\nBecause “costs have risen, conditions have not changed, and the laws have not been\n\namended” since that study was conducted, the Mayor concluded that he would not\n\npropose annexation of the Okeechobee Center.\n\n                                           8\n\f      On June 12, 1995, four tenants of the Okeechobee Center7 and four black\n\nresidents of the City initiated this lawsuit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief\n\nagainst the City of Belle Glade, the Mayor of Belle Glade, the Belle Glade City\n\nCommission and its members, and the BGHA and its officers and members alleging\n\nthat the BGHA’s failure to petition for annexation and the City’s failure to annex the\n\nOkeechobee Center, as well as the City’s practice of annexing property populated by\n\nwhites, denied or abridged the rights of Appellants to vote on account of race or color\n\nin violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1994),\n\nand that these practices were adopted or purposefully maintained to dilute the voting\n\nstrength of Appellants and deprive them of their rights secured by the First,\n\nThirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\n\nas enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994 & Supp. II 1996). Appellants further\n\nalleged that the BGHA’s failure to petition for annexation discriminated against the\n\ntenants of the Okeechobee Center on the basis of race, in violation of Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d to 2000d-4a (1994), and its\n\nimplementing regulations, 7 C.F.R. § 15.3 (1999). The district court dismissed\n\nAppellants’ claims to the extent that they relied on the First and Thirteenth\n\nAmendments, expressed its view that the remedy of forced annexation was not\n\n\n      7\n       On March 24, 1997, the district court granted Okeechobee tenant Charles Jackson’s\nmotion to withdraw as plaintiff. Three tenants remain in the suit.\n\n                                           9\n\favailable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and dismissed Appellants’\n\nconstitutional claims without prejudice for failure to plead pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983. Appellants subsequently filed an amended complaint.\n\n      Prior to trial, each side moved for summary judgment. The City filed a motion\n\non Appellants’ claims under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, arguing that because\n\nthe Okeechobee Center did not satisfy the statutory requirements for annexation set\n\nforth in Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West Supp. 1998), Appellants had no available\n\nremedy. Appellants, in turn, moved for summary judgment on their constitutional\n\nclaims. On May 20, 1997, the district court granted summary judgment for Appellees\n\non both the constitutional and Voting Rights Act claims. The court also granted\n\nsummary judgment sua sponte for the BGHA on the remaining Title VI claims.\n\nSpecifically, the district court held that because the Okeechobee Center was not\n\n“contiguous” to the City of Belle Glade, Florida law prohibited its annexation; that\n\nrace discrimination did not cause the City’s refusal to annex the Okeechobee Center;\n\nthat judicially-compelled annexation was not an available remedy under the Voting\n\nRights Act; that an injunction prohibiting the City from discriminating in future\n\nannexation decisions was not sufficiently specific to comply with Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 65(d); and, lastly, that there was no meaningful relief available for\n\nAppellants’ Title VI claim because, even if the district court ordered the BGHA to\n\npetition for annexation, Florida law still prohibited the City from granting the request.\n\n                                           10\n\fSee Burton v. City of Belle Glade, 966 F. Supp. 1178 (S.D. Fla. 1997). This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n                                          II.\n\n      We give plenary review to a district court’s grant of summary judgment. See\n\nHarris v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 99 F.3d 1078, 1082 (11th Cir. 1996). The\n\ngoverning standard is by now well understood. Summary judgment is proper if “the\n\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\n\nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\n\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(c). As we have explained:\n\n             In assessing whether the movant has met this burden, the\n             courts should view the evidence and all factual inferences\n             therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing\n             the motion. All reasonable doubts about the facts should be\n             resolved in favor of the non-movant. If the record presents\n             factual issues, the court must not decide them; it must deny\n             the motion and proceed to trial. Summary judgment may\n             be inappropriate even where the parties agree on the basic\n             facts, but disagree about the inferences that should be\n             drawn from these facts. If reasonable minds might differ\n             on the inferences arising from undisputed facts, then the\n             court should deny summary judgment.\n\nClemons v. Dougherty County, 684 F.2d 1365, 1368-69 (11th Cir. 1982) (citations\n\nomitted). To withstand a summary judgment motion, the non-moving party must\n\n\n                                          11\n\festablish that, based on the evidence in the record, there can be more than one\n\nreasonable conclusion as to the proper verdict. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n\n477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986). Consequently, “[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of\n\nevidence in support of the [non-movant’s] position will be insufficient; there must be\n\nevidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant].” Id. at 252;\n\nsee also Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n                                              A.\n\n             Section 1983: Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment Claims\n\n       Appellants8 contend that the BGHA’s refusal to petition for annexation of the\n\nOkeechobee Center and the City’s failure to annex the Center denied them the equal\n\n\n       8\n        Both groups of Appellants -- the black citizens and registered voters of Belle Glade\nand the black, non-Belle-Glade-citizen tenants of the Okeechobee Center -- make the same\nclaims. We observe at the outset, however, that in a very real sense these claims are distinct.\nThe Okeechobee Center tenants’ claimed injury stems from an allegedly improper racial\nmotive in Appellees’ annexation decisions concerning the Okeechobee Center. These\nallegations give rise to a traditional race discrimination claim under the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and a vote denial claim under the Fifteenth\nAmendment. In contrast, we construe the citizens of Belle Glade to complain that the BGHA\nand the City purposefully employed discriminatory practices to dilute the voting strength of\nblack citizens within the City’s boundaries. These discriminatory practices, if proved,\nallegedly injured Belle Glade citizens because they enjoyed the right to vote in Belle Glade.\nBecause the Okeechobee Center tenants never possessed a right to vote within the City,\nAppellants’ constitutional vote dilution claim may only be premised on the injuries of the\nBelle Glade citizens. See Socialist Workers Party v. Leahy, 145 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir.\n1998). However, because vote dilution, vote denial, and traditional race discrimination\nclaims arising under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments all require proof of\nintentional discrimination, see infra, we address Appellants’ § 1983 claims as one.\n\n                                              12\n\fprotection of the laws and deprived them of the right to vote on account of race, both\n\nby denying their right to vote and by diluting their voting strength, in violation of the\n\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.9 Section 1983 provides a cause of action for\n\nconstitutional violations committed under color of state law.10 To prevail, plaintiffs\n\n       9\n        The Supreme Court has not yet determined conclusively whether vote dilution is\nprohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, or both. See Reno v.\nBossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 495 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (citing Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 617 (1982) (Fourteenth\nAmendment covers vote dilution claims); City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 66 (1980)\n(plurality opinion) (same), and comparing Mobile, 446 U.S. at 62-63 (intentional vote\ndilution may be illegal under Fifteenth Amendment), and Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S.\n339, 346 (1960) (Fifteenth Amendment covers municipal boundaries drawn to exclude\nblacks), with Mobile, 446 U.S. at 84 n.3 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (Mobile\nplurality said that Fifteenth Amendment does not reach vote dilution); Voinovich v. Quilter,\n507 U.S. 146, 159 (1993) (“This Court has not decided whether the Fifteenth Amendment\napplies to vote-dilution claims . . . .”); Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 645 (1993) (endorsing\nthe Gomillion concurrence’s Fourteenth Amendment approach); Beer v. United States, 425\nU.S. 130, 142 n.14 (1976)). Both Amendments, however, require proof of discriminatory\npurpose. See Bossier Parish, 520 U.S. at 481 (“Since 1980, a plaintiff bringing a\nconstitutional vote dilution challenge, whether under the Fourteenth or Fifteenth\nAmendment, has been required to establish that the state or political subdivision acted with\na discriminatory purpose.”); Lucas v. Townsend, 967 F.2d 549, 551 (11th Cir. 1992) (per\ncuriam) (holding that claims of vote dilution under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment\nrequire proof of “a racially discriminatory purpose chargeable to the state”). Therefore, we\ndecline to address this distinction.\n        Appellants’ initial complaint also alleged vote dilution claims under the First and\nThirteenth Amendments. Appellants argue that the district court erred in granting Appellees’\nmotion to dismiss those claims. But since the First and Thirteenth Amendments afford no\ngreater protection for voting rights claims than that already provided by the Fourteenth and\nFifteenth Amendments, see Washington v. Finlay, 664 F.2d 913, 927-28 (4th Cir. 1981);\nLucas v. Townsend, 783 F. Supp. 605, 618 (M.D. Ga. 1992), aff’d on other grounds, 967\nF.2d 549 (11th Cir. 1992), we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing these\nclaims.\n       10\n         Section 1983 provides, in relevant part, that “[e]very person who, under color of any\nstatute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be\nsubjected, any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\n\n                                               13\n\fmust demonstrate both that the defendants deprived them of a right secured under the\n\nConstitution or federal law and that the deprivation occurred under color of state law.\n\nSee Arrington v. Cobb County, 139 F.3d 865, 872 (11th Cir. 1998). Because\n\nAppellees concede they acted under color of state law, we need only address whether\n\nAppellees acted in violation of the Constitution.\n\n       Section 1983 claims, moreover, are governed by the forum state’s residual\n\npersonal injury statute of limitations. See Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 249-50\n\n(1989); Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 276 (1985). Specifically, a plaintiff must\n\ncommence a § 1983 claim arising in Florida within four years of the allegedly\n\nunconstitutional or otherwise illegal act. See Baker v. Gulf & Western Indus., Inc.,\n\n850 F.2d 1480, 1483 (11th Cir. 1988). The City’s 1995 decision to deny Appellants’\n\nrequest for annexation of the Okeechobee Center is the only act that occurred during\n\nthe limitations period. Therefore, Appellants’ § 1983 claims rest solely on the\n\nconstitutionality of that decision.\n\n\nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\naction at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n       Early in this litigation, Appellees moved to dismiss Appellants’ First Amended\nComplaint on the ground that they improperly pleaded claims directly under the Constitution.\nThe district court granted this motion without prejudice and Appellants filed a Second\nAmended Complaint. Appellants now argue that the district court erred in dismissing their\nfirst complaint. However, because Appellants were made whole by filing a second\ncomplaint, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), this issue is now moot. See Purcell v. BankAtlantic Fin.\nCorp., 85 F.3d 1508, 1511 n. 3 (11th Cir. 1996) (“‘Central to a finding of mootness is a\ndetermination by an appellate court that it cannot grant effective judicial relief.’”) (quoting\nIn re Club Assocs., 956 F.2d 1065, 1069 (11th Cir.1992)).\n\n                                              14\n\f      Moreover, to establish a violation of either the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment or the Fifteenth Amendment, Appellants must show that the\n\nCity’s decision or act had a discriminatory purpose and effect. See Reno v. Bossier\n\nParish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 481 (1997); Village of Arlington Heights v.\n\nMetropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426\n\nU.S. 229, 241-42 (1976). Discriminatory purpose may be established by proof that\n\nthe City used race as a substantial or motivating factor in its annexation decisions and\n\npractices. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265-66. If the City’s annexation\n\ndecisions created an express racial classification, no inquiry into discriminatory\n\npurpose is necessary. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993) (citing Personnel\n\nAdministrator v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979)). However, once a discriminatory\n\npurpose is established, the burden shifts to Appellees to prove that, at the time of the\n\ndiscriminatory act, the same decision would have been made for a legitimate reason.\n\nSee Mount Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).\n\n      We evaluate all available direct and circumstantial evidence of intent in\n\ndetermining whether a discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in a particular\n\ndecision. In Arlington Heights, the Supreme Court suggested that relevant evidentiary\n\nfactors include substantial disparate impact, a history of discriminatory official\n\nactions, procedural and substantive departures from the norms generally followed by\n\nthe decision-maker, and the legislative and administrative history of the decision. See\n\n                                          15\n\f429 U.S. at 265-69. Moreover, we have repeatedly recognized that evidence of “‘[t]he\n\nhistorical background of the decision’” is relevant to the issue of discriminatory intent.\n\nWilliams v. City of Dothan, 745 F.2d 1406, 1415 (11th Cir. 1984) (quoting Arlington\n\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 267); see also Elston v. Talladega County Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d\n\n1394, 1406 (11th Cir. 1993) (holding that discriminatory intent may be established by,\n\namong other things, a history of discriminatory official actions); Ammons v. Dade\n\nCity, 783 F.2d 982, 988 (11th Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (noting that district court\n\n“correctly relied upon a large body of constitutional jurisprudence which recognizes\n\nthat the historical context of a challenged activity may constitute relevant evidence of\n\nintentional discrimination”); Dowdell v. City of Apopka, 698 F.2d 1181, 1186 (11th\n\nCir. 1983) (recognizing that historical pattern of decision-making was relevant to\n\ndistrict court’s finding of discriminatory intent).           Indeed, all “actions having\n\nforeseeable and anticipated disparate impact are relevant evidence to prove the\n\nultimate fact, forbidden purpose.” Columbus Bd. of Educ. v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449,\n\n464 (1979).11\n\n       11\n         Appellants suggest that the district court erred in excluding relevant evidence that\noccurred outside of the statute of limitations period. Specifically, Appellants assert that the\nfour-year statute of limitations should not operate to exclude relevant historical evidence of\npast discriminatory practices. To the extent the district court suggested that it would exclude\nevidence of discrimination that preceded the 1995 act at issue -- the only act occurring within\nthe limitations period -- we believe that the district court erred. See City of Dothan, 745 F.2d\nat 1415-16 (holding that district court erred in excluding evidence of municipal decisions that\noccurred outside the statute of limitations period on ground that evidence was relevant to\nissue of defendant’s later discriminatory intent). However, because the district court did, in\n\n                                              16\n\f       At the heart of their appeal, Appellants argue that the district court erred in\n\nholding that no reasonable jury could conclude that race was a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor in the City’s 1995 annexation decision. Appellants point to three\n\ncategories of evidence supporting a claim of intentional race discrimination: first,\n\nAppellants assert that since there was direct evidence of a de jure racial classification\n\nin Belle Glade housing before 1977, any inquiry into Appellees’ discriminatory intent\n\nis unnecessary; second, they suggest that the bizarre shape of the City’s municipal\n\nboundaries is circumstantial evidence of improper racial motive under Shaw v. Reno,\n\n509 U.S. 630 (1993); and third, they contend that they have presented substantial\n\ncircumstantial evidence of the City’s discriminatory intent in failing to annex the\n\nOkeechobee Center. Taken together, they argue, these categories of evidence raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether race was a substantial or motivating factor\n\nin the City’s 1995 decision to refuse annexation of the Okeechobee Center. We are\n\nnot persuaded by Appellants’ arguments either standing alone or in concert, but\n\nconsider each in turn.\n\n                                              1.\n\n                              De Jure Racial Classification\n\n\n\n\nfact, consider all of Appellants’ evidence, see Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1182, and because an\nexamination of all of the proffered evidence does not alter the result, any error plainly would\nbe harmless.\n\n                                              17\n\f      Appellants first argue that the City’s annexation of the Osceola Center\n\nconstituted the enforcement of a de jure racial classification. Because Belle Glade\n\nordinances required racial segregation in residential housing, Appellants contend that\n\nthe City’s annexation of the Osceola Center back in 1961 constituted the enforcement\n\nof a de jure racial classification. Appellants, therefore, assert that the district court\n\nerred in failing to engage in the stringent review required for cases involving prior de\n\njure segregation. This claim is unavailing.\n\n      The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment is to prohibit states from discriminating against individuals on the basis\n\nof race. Plainly, where the racial classification appears on the face of the statute, no\n\ninquiry into legislative purpose is necessary. See Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642 (citing\n\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 272). Such racial classifications are presumptively invalid and\n\ncan only survive constitutional scrutiny if they are justified by a compelling state\n\ninterest and are narrowly tailored to serve that interest. See id. at 643. Moreover,\n\nAppellants argue that defendants should carry an even greater burden in this case, just\n\nas they do in the context of higher education. See United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S.\n\n717, 727-32 (1992). Where there is evidence that a current practice is “traceable” to\n\nor is “rooted” in a prior policy of segregation in education, defendants can only avoid\n\nliability by proving that the current policy does not have “continuing segregative\n\neffects or, even if it does, that there exists no practicable and educationally sound\n\n                                           18\n\fmeans of remedying any such effects.” Knight v. Alabama, 14 F.3d 1534, 1550 (11th\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n      In this case, however, the district court did not err in failing to require Appellees\n\nto prove that they attempted to remedy the effects of prior de jure segregation. In the\n\nfirst place, Appellants can point to no court that has ever applied Fordice outside of\n\nthe education setting. Indeed, given the unique nature of school desegregation, we\n\nhesitate to extend Fordice to a property annexation case. But even if we assume,\n\narguendo, that the analysis applies, Appellants have failed to demonstrate that the\n\nCity’s 1995 annexation decision is, in any way, “traceable” to or “rooted” in past de\n\njure segregation. Knight, 14 F.3d at 1540-41 (noting that plaintiff has burden of proof\n\nto show that challenged policy is “traceable” to past segregation). The City’s 1961\n\ndecision to annex the Osceola Center, the white housing project, and the concomitant\n\n“determination” not to annex the Okeechobee Center, the black housing project, when\n\nthe BGHA only petitioned for Osceola’s annexation, neither created a racial\n\nclassification nor enforced the City’s segregation laws. Although the two centers were\n\nsegregated by race in 1961, on this record there is simply no evidence that residential\n\nsegregation laws dictated which center the City annexed, or, indeed, that race played\n\nany role in the process. Moreover, there is no evidence that the City had any policy,\n\neither in 1961 or later, of making annexation decisions on the basis of the race of the\n\nresidents in the proposed annexation areas. It is even unclear on this record that the\n\n                                           19\n\fCity ever entertained a request to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1961, or, for that\n\nmatter, that the Okeechobee Center was similarly situated to the Osceola Center, let\n\nalone evidence showing that the decision to annex the Osceola Center was somehow\n\nbased on the race of its occupants. Non-discriminatory reasons were offered to\n\nexplain the Osceola annexation -- including evidence that the BGHA requested\n\nannexation to provide City police protection to the residents due to ongoing threats\n\nagainst the center’s manager -- and Appellants have presented nothing to rebut this.\n\nWhile it is undeniably true that the two centers were segregated by race in 1961,\n\nAppellants notably have been unable to draw some connection between that de jure\n\npolicy and the decision to annex the Osceola Center. Accordingly, we cannot find that\n\nthe City enforced any policy of racial classification in its annexation decisions.\n\nAbsent such evidence, the district court did not err in refusing to require Appellees to\n\npresent evidence of their efforts to remedy prior de jure segregation.\n\n      The very most Appellants could argue is that the existence of the City’s\n\nsegregation ordinances may have raised an inference of discriminatory intent back in\n\n1961. The existence of these ordinances, however, which were abolished more than\n\ntwenty years before the 1995 decision, can in no way transform this cause of action\n\ninto a challenge to the enforcement of a racial classification or de jure segregation.\n\n                                           2.\n\n                                Municipal Boundaries\n\n                                          20\n\f      Appellants also suggest that the municipal boundaries of the City of Belle Glade\n\nare so bizarre as to raise an inference of racially discriminatory intent under the racial\n\ngerrymandering case of Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993). Appellants assert that\n\nthe City’s decision to annex State Road Number 80 in 1965 and its deliberate decision\n\nnot to annex the black population centers on either side of the highway, rendered the\n\nboundaries of Belle Glade bizarre. They argue, therefore, that this annexation is\n\nfacially suspect and triggers strict scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that\n\nthe district court again erred in failing to shift the burden to Appellees to produce\n\nevidence that the municipal boundary was shaped by decisions that were narrowly\n\ntailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. We find this argument\n\nsimilarly unpersuasive.\n\n      To establish that a districting scheme amounts to impermissible racial\n\ngerrymandering, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving that race was the predominant\n\nfactor in the legislature’s decision either through “‘circumstantial evidence of a\n\ndistrict’s shape and demographics’ or through ‘more direct evidence going to\n\nlegislative purpose.’” Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 905 (1996) [hereinafter Shaw II]\n\n(quoting Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995)). As the Supreme Court\n\nexplained in Miller:\n\n             Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary\n             element of the constitutional wrong or a threshold\n             requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive\n\n                                           21\n\f              circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not\n              other districting principles, was the legislature’s dominant\n              and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.\n\n515 U.S. at 913. A plaintiff will not prevail, however, simply by pointing to the\n\nbizarre shape of a legislative district where the district lines are facially race neutral.\n\nUnder those circumstances, “a more searching inquiry is necessary before strict\n\nscrutiny can be found applicable.” Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 958 (1996) (plurality\n\nopinion) (quotations omitted). Moreover, a state may defeat an allegation of racial\n\ngerrymandering by establishing that race-neutral considerations motivated the\n\nredistricting legislation and that those considerations were not “subordinated” to race.\n\nMiller, 515 U.S. at 916. Once a plaintiff proves that race was the predominant factor,\n\nhowever, the redistricting decision then becomes subject to strict scrutiny: it must be\n\njustified by a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that\n\ninterest. See Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 908 (citing Miller, 515 U.S. at 920).\n\n       Appellants’ Shaw argument faces multiple infirmities.12 To begin with, as far\n\nas we can discern, no court has ever applied Shaw outside the racial gerrymandering\n\n\n\n       12\n         It is unclear whether all of the Appellants have standing to bring a Fourteenth\nAmendment claim under Shaw. In United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737 (1995), the Supreme\nCourt held that plaintiffs who reside in a racially gerrymandered district have standing to\nchallenge a legislature’s reapportionment scheme. See id. at 745. For non-resident plaintiffs\nto have standing, however, the Court noted that they would have to show specific evidence\nthat they were personally subjected to a racial classification. See id. Here, the non-Belle-\nGlade-citizen Appellants would have to prove that they personally were not annexed into the\nCity on the basis of their race.\n\n                                             22\n\fcontext.   Moreover, Shaw and other racial gerrymandering cases are legally\n\ndistinguishable from the instant case. In racial gerrymandering cases, plaintiffs\n\ntypically challenge laws affirmatively enacted to alter the boundaries of voting\n\ndistricts. These jurisdictions are under an affirmative legal duty to alter their\n\nboundaries to reflect shifts or alterations in population. In sharp contrast, however,\n\nis a city’s right to determine if and when it will expand its municipal boundaries.\n\nAlthough the City of Belle Glade may well be bizarrely shaped, its contours were\n\ncreated over an extended time period as hundreds of individual parcels were brought\n\ninto its ambit incrementally; it was not created by a single scheme designed to exclude\n\nproperty on the basis of race. Cf. Chen v. City of Houston, 9 F. Supp. 2d 745, 754\n\n(S.D. Tex. 1998) (refusing to apply strict scrutiny under Shaw solely based on\n\nbizarreness of city’s redistricting plan where repeated annexation, not districting\n\ndecision-making, caused irregular shape of districts). Moreover, not surprisingly,\n\nAppellants have been unable to show that the annexation of any specific piece of\n\nproperty, including the Okeechobee Center, would make the shape of the City of Belle\n\nGlade any less “bizarre.”\n\n      The central problem with Appellants’ argument is that the City’s shape has not\n\nbeen shown to have been created because of any affirmative annexation plan. Rather,\n\nthe City’s pattern of annexation over time merely reflects the aggregation of various\n\nowners’ requests for annexation, which the City generally approves so long as the\n\n                                          23\n\fproposed annexations satisfies the obligations of Florida law, and annexations\n\ninitiated solely by the City, which also must conform to Florida law and which City\n\nvoters and annex residents must approve by referendum. See Fla. Stat. Ann. §§\n\n171.044(1), 171.0413. Absent some other evidence, such as the circumstances\n\nsurrounding a multitude of other annexation decisions, the specific racial composition\n\nof each of these areas, whether the unincorporated areas ever requested annexation,\n\nor perhaps some comparison of the shapes of other Florida municipalities, we cannot\n\nfind that the municipal boundaries alone raise an inference of the City’s racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Thus, whether or not a Shaw analysis could apply in the context\n\nof municipal property annexation, the simple fact is that this record is wholly\n\ninsufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact to support a distinct claim under\n\nShaw.\n\n                                           3.\n\n                     Circumstantial Evidence of Discrimination\n\n        Finally, Appellants claim that the circumstantial evidence, when weighed\n\ntogether, establishes the City’s discriminatory motive or intent in refusing to annex\n\nthe Okeechobee Center in 1995. Indeed, Appellants argue that the City’s annexation\n\ndecisions cannot be explained in non-racial terms. Appellants, therefore, contend that\n\nthe district court erred in concluding that they failed to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether race was a substantial or motivating factor behind the\n\n                                          24\n\fCity’s 1995 decision to refuse annexation of the Okeechobee Center. See Arlington\n\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 265-66. Appellants also assert that the district court further erred\n\nin failing to shift the burden to Appellees to prove that, at the time of the\n\ndiscriminatory act, the same decision would have been made for a legitimate reason.\n\nSee Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287. Appellants are incorrect on both counts.\n\n      Turning to the circumstantial evidence surrounding the 1995 decision,\n\nAppellants contend that two additional pieces of evidence establish the City’s\n\ndiscriminatory purpose. Appellants argue that the City’s justification of costs in\n\nrefusing to annex the Okeechobee Center raises an inference of race discrimination\n\nbecause the City does not usually consider costs when deciding whether to annex\n\nproperty. Appellants also assert that the City’s view that Florida law prohibited\n\nannexation of the Okeechobee Center was a mere pretext for the City’s discriminatory\n\npurpose. Neither argument raises an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n      First, the City’s reliance on cost as a justification for refusing to annex the\n\nOkeechobee Center in 1995 does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the\n\nCity’s allegedly improper racial motive. Appellants have offered no evidence to\n\nsupport their contention that the City does not usually consider cost in making\n\nannexation decisions. However, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that some\n\ndisparity exists, we fail to see how reliance on cost here raises an inference of race\n\nanimus. As the Annexation Committee found back in 1984, providing the necessary\n\n                                           25\n\fmunicipal services to the Okeechobee Center would be a very expensive proposition\n\nfor the City of Belle Glade. Moreover, because the property is exempt from ad\n\nvalorem taxes, the City would enjoy little revenue to offset this expense. Thus, the\n\nCity’s reliance on costs was altogether reasonable under the circumstances. Indeed,\n\na Florida municipality has an obligation to its citizens to consider the economic impact\n\nof annexations.13 Therefore, we decline to accept Appellants’ suggestion that the\n\nCity’s reliance on cost was a pretext for race discrimination.\n\n       Second, the City’s conclusion that Florida law prohibited annexation of the\n\nOkeechobee center does not raise an inference of race discrimination. The parties do\n\nnot dispute that the Okeechobee Center could only be annexed if contiguous to the\n\nCity, and that its contiguity would arise only from its proximity to State Road Number\n\n       13\n        Section 171.021 provides:\n\n                     The purposes of this act are to set forth procedures for\n              adjusting the boundaries of municipalities through annexations\n              or contractions or corporate limits and to set forth criteria for\n              determining when annexations or contractions may take place so\n              as to:\n\n                      (1) Insure sound urban development and accommodation\n              to growth.\n                      (2) Establish uniform legislative standards throughout the\n              state for the adjustment of municipal boundaries.\n                      (3) Insure the efficient provision of urban services to\n              areas that become urban in character.\n                      (4) Insure that areas are not annexed unless municipal\n              services can be provided to those areas.\n\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 171.021.\n\n                                             26\n\f80, which the City annexed in 1965. Therefore, Okeechobee’s contiguity turns on\n\nwhether a municipality may use a previously annexed road to gain contiguity to\n\notherwise non-contiguous property. Florida law, however, is hotly disputed and far\n\nfrom settled on this question.\n\n       Since 1974, Florida law has provided that an owner of reasonably compact14\n\nproperty that is contiguous15 to a municipality may petition for annexation. See Fla.\n\nStat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West Supp. 1998). In 1977, the Florida Attorney General\n\nconsidered whether Florida law permitted a municipality to annex property only\n\n\n\n\n       14\n         “‘Compactness’ means concentration of a piece of property in a single area and\nprecludes any action which would create enclaves, pockets, or finger areas in serpentine\npatterns. Any annexation proceeding in any county in the state shall be designed in such a\nmanner as to ensure that the area will be reasonably compact.’” Fla. Stat. Ann.\n§ 171.031(12).\n       15\n          “‘Contiguous’ means that a substantial part of a boundary of the territory sought to\nbe annexed by the municipality is coterminous with a part of the boundary of the\nmunicipality. . . . However, nothing herein shall be construed to allow local rights-of-way,\nutility easements, railroad rights-of-way, or like entities to be annexed in a corridor fashion\nto gain contiguity . . . .” Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.031(11).\n        Prior to 1975, section 171.031(11) stated, in relevant part: “Local rights-of-way,\nutility easements, or railroad rights-of-way shall not be annexed in a corridor fashion to gain\ncontiguity nor shall such activity be deemed to establish the contiguity required under this\nact.” 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (emphasis added). Since the underscored language was\ndeleted in 1975, see 1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-297, Appellants contend that the statute only\nprohibits annexation of roads to gain contiguity, but it does not bar annexation of property\ncontiguous to a previously annexed road. Even assuming, arguendo, that Appellants’\nstatutory interpretation is correct -- and we have no need to resolve this question of Florida\nlaw today -- the amended language does not establish that the City’s statutory interpretation\nwas unreasonable.\n\n                                              27\n\fcontiguous to the municipality by virtue of a previously annexed road.16 See 1977 Fla.\n\nOp. Atty. Gen. 35. Recognizing that no Florida appellate court had considered the\n\nissue, the Attorney General concluded that a parcel may not be voluntarily annexed\n\nif it is only contiguous to the City by virtue of a previously annexed highway because\n\nsuch annexation would violate both Florida’s contiguity requirement and its\n\nprohibition against the creation of enclaves. See id. Then, in 1985, the Attorney\n\nGeneral considered whether a municipality could voluntarily annex property\n\ncontiguous on one side to a previously annexed, 125 foot-wide corridor of\n\nunimproved land, but otherwise surrounded by unincorporated property. See 1985\n\nFla. Op. Atty. Gen. 163. Although concluding that the city could not voluntarily\n\nannex the parcel because it would result in the creation of a prohibited enclave, the\n\nAttorney General found that Florida’s contiguity requirement would not prohibit the\n\nmunicipality from using the corridor of unimproved land to gain contiguity because\n\nthe statute did not apply to property annexed before 1974. Id. The Attorney General,\n\nhowever, never reconciled his finding of contiguity in the 1985 opinion with the\n\nconclusion he had reached eight years earlier.\n\n      Based on this undeniably conflicting authority, we conclude that the City’s\n\n\n      16\n        Although Florida Opinions of the Attorney General are not binding on this Court,\nthey “are entitled to careful consideration and generally should be regarded as highly\npersuasive” of matters of Florida law. State v. Family Bank of Hallandale, 623 So. 2d 474,\n478 (Fla. 1993).\n\n                                           28\n\freliance on the 1974 annexation statute as a justification for the denial of Peterson’s\n\nrequest to annex the Okeechobee Center does not raise a genuine issue of material fact\n\nas to the City’s discriminatory intent in 1995. Even if we were to determine today that\n\nFlorida law permits annexation -- and the law is anything but clear as to this matter --\n\nwe would still conclude that the City’s interpretation was an altogether reasonable one\n\ngiven the plainly conflicting Attorney General opinions.17 In short, the City’s reliance\n\non the 1974 annexation statute cannot fairly be taken as being a pretext for race\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       The only other evidence presented by Appellants relates to the historical\n\nbackground to the City’s 1995 decision. However, “the historical background for a\n\ngiven decision is only one factor relative to intent. It does not, by itself, compel [a\n\ncourt] to find a discriminatory purpose behind every statute passed during regrettable\n\nperiods of [a state’s] past.” Hall v. Holder, 117 F.3d 1222, 1226-27 (11th Cir. 1997).\n\nNevertheless, Appellants point to three pieces of historical evidence. First, the City’s\n\n\n\n       17\n         Indeed, the district court determined that the City’s interpretation was correct as a\nmatter of statutory construction. See Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1183. According to the district\ncourt, the propriety of using a road annexation to gain contiguity cannot turn on the\nsubjective intent of the municipality in initially annexing the road. The court reasoned that\nthe Florida legislature could not have intended for so strange a construction. See id. at 1183-\n84. However, we need not reach the merits of this issue to resolve the instant case.\n        Concluding that the proposed annexation of the Okeechobee Center would have been\nillegal under Florida law since 1974, the district court also held that this statute was the\nintervening cause of Appellants’ injuries. See Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1183-84. Again, it\nis unnecessary to reach the merits of this issue.\n\n                                              29\n\fhousing ordinances mandated residential segregation until 1963. Second, the Osceola\n\nand Okeechobee Centers were segregated by race until 1977. Lastly, the BGHA failed\n\nto petition the Okeechobee Center in 1961 and 1973 and the City failed to annex in\n\n1961, 1971, and 1985. This evidence is far too remote and attenuated to be probative\n\nof any discriminatory purpose in 1995. Simply put, we fail to see how evidence of\n\npast residential segregation in housing, which ended almost twenty years before the\n\ndecision at issue, and which is wholly unconnected to any annexation decision, or a\n\nprior refusal to annex standing alone establishes any intent, let alone a discriminatory\n\none, in 1995. As we said in Holder, “past discrimination cannot, in the manner of\n\noriginal sin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful.” Id. (quoting\n\nMobile, 446 U.S. at 74); see also Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 495-96 (1992).\n\nAppellants’ historical evidence does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether the City’s 1995 decision to refuse annexation of the Okeechobee Center was\n\nmotivated by race.\n\n      On the basis of this record, viewing all of the circumstantial evidence and\n\ndrawing all inferences in the light most favorable to Appellants, we conclude that\n\nAppellants have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City’s\n\n1995 decision was racially motivated. No jury could reasonably find for Appellants\n\nbased on this record. In the first place, the City’s reliance on cost -- a possible\n\nexpense to the City of close to one million dollars -- was an altogether reasonable\n\n                                           30\n\fbasis on which to refuse annexation. Second, the City’s reliance on Florida’s\n\ncontiguity requirement to deny annexation was likewise reasonable given the\n\nconflicting authority in Florida law, and in no way supports an inference of pretext for\n\nrace discrimination. Lastly, Appellants’ historical evidence, which at most arguably\n\nraised an inference of the City’s discriminatory intent in the 1960s and 1970s, offers\n\nno plausible connection between any conceivable discriminatory intent rooted in the\n\npast and the 1995 act at issue today. Taken together, this evidence does not raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to the City’s discriminatory intent in 1995.\n\n      Finally, the district court did not err in failing to consider the second prong of\n\nthe Mount Healthy test. If Appellants cannot first prove that race was a motivating\n\nfactor, there is no basis for shifting the burden to the City to determine whether, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, it would have made the same decision notwithstanding\n\nits racial motivation. See Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287. Accordingly, we hold that\n\nthe district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on\n\nAppellants’ § 1983 claims.\n\n\n\n                                          B.\n\n                     Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965\n\n      Appellants also contend that the BGHA’s refusal to petition and the City’s\n\nfailure to annex the Okeechobee Center violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\n\n                                          31\n\fof 1965. Section 2, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, “was designed as a means of eradicating voting\n\npractices that ‘minimize or cancel out the voting strength and political effectiveness\n\nof minority groups.’” Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 479 (1997)\n\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 28 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 205).\n\nIt “prohibits all forms of voting discrimination.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30,\n\n45 n.10 (1986) (citing S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 30, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n\n207-08). Specifically, two distinct types of discriminatory practices and procedures\n\nare covered under section 2: those that result in “vote denial” and those that result in\n\n“vote dilution.”\n\n       In 1982, Congress amended section 2 to clarify that a plaintiff may establish a\n\nviolation by a showing of discriminatory results alone.18 See Voting Rights Act\n\nAmendments of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-205, § 3, 96 Stat. 131, 134 (1982). As\n\namended, section 2 states:\n\n                     (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting\n              or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\n              applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner\n              which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any\n              citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\n              color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in\n\n\n\n       18\n        This amendment superceded the Supreme Court’s decision in City of Mobile v.\nBolden, 446 U.S. 55, 61-62 (1980) (plurality opinion), which had held that both the Fifteenth\nAmendment and section 2 of the Voting Rights Act require proof of intentional\ndiscrimination.\n\n                                             32\n\f              section 1973b(f)(2)19 of this title, as provided in subsection\n              (b) of this section.\n\n                     (b) A violation of subsection (a) of this section is\n              established if, based on the totality of the circumstances, it\n              is shown that the political processes leading to nomination\n              or election in the State or political subdivision are not\n              equally open to participation by members of a class of\n              citizens protected by subsection (a) of this section in that its\n              members have less opportunity than other members of the\n              electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n              representatives of their choice. The extent to which\n              members of a protected class have been elected to office in\n              the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which\n              may be considered: Provided, That nothing in this section\n              establishes a right to have members of a protected class\n              elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the\n              population.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a), (b). Subsection (b) has come to be known as the “results test”\n\nbecause it seeks to measure the effect of vote dilution.20\n\n       19\n         Section 1973b(f)(2) provides: “No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or\nstandard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political\nsubdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote because\nhe is a member of a language minority group.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(f)(2) (1994).\n       20\n         A Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendment sets forth “‘typical factors’”\nthat may show a violation of section 2 under this test. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36 (quoting S.\nRep. No. 97-417 at 28-29, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206-207). These factors\ninclude:\n\n                      “1. the extent of any history of official discrimination in\n              the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the\n              members of the minority group to register, to vote, or otherwise\n              to participate in the democratic process;\n\n                     2. the extent to which voting in the elections of the state\n              or political subdivision is racially polarized;\n\n                                              33\n\f      Appellants have alleged claims of both vote denial and vote dilution.21 The\n\n\n                    3. the extent to which the state or political subdivision\n             has used unusually large election districts, majority vote\n             requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting\n             practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for\n             discrimination against the minority group;\n\n                   4. if there is a candidate slating process, whether the\n             members of the minority group have been denied access to that\n             process;\n\n                    5. the extent to which members of the minority group in\n             the state or political subdivision bear the effects of\n             discrimination in such areas as education, employment and\n             health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the\n             political process;\n\n                   6. whether political campaigns have been characterized\n             by overt or subtle racial appeals; [and]\n\n                   7. the extent to which members of the minority group\n             have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.\n\n                    Additional factors that in some cases have had probative\n             value as part of plaintiffs’ evidence to establish a violation are:\n\n                           whether there is a significant lack of\n                    responsiveness on the part of elected officials to\n                    the particularized needs of the members of the\n                    minority group [and]\n\n                           whether the policy underlying the state or\n                    political subdivision’s use of such voting\n                    qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard,\n                    practice or procedure is tenuous.”\n\nId. at 36-37 (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 28-29, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206-\n07). However, “‘there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be proved, or\nthat a majority of them point one way or the other.’” Id. at 45 (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417\nat 29, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206-07).\n\n                                             34\n\fdistrict court, however, elected not to reach the merits of either of Appellant’s section\n\n2 claims. Rather, the district court granted Appellees’ motion for summary judgment\n\nexplaining that mandatory annexation is not an available remedy under the Voting\n\nRights Act. The district court also considered each of the required factors in a vote\n\ndilution claim, see infra II.B.2, and concluded that it doubted whether Appellants had\n\neven made a prima facie showing under section 2. See Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1186\n\nn.10. After thoroughly searching this record, we likewise conclude that Appellants\n\nhave failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to either vote denial or vote\n\ndilution under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.22 On the record presented, we agree\n\nwith the district court that court-ordered annexation is not an appropriate remedy to\n\n       21\n         Appellants’ vote dilution claim, we believe, may be premised only upon the claimed\ninjuries of Belle Glade’s black citizens. This is true because only those who enjoy the right\nto vote in Belle Glade may have their voting strength diluted by the City’s annexation\ndecisions. In contrast, Appellants’ vote denial claim may only arise from injuries of black\ntenants of the Okeechobee Center. See supra note 8.\n       22\n         We need not reach the question of whether a challenge to a city’s failure to annex\nadjacent property is cognizable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In Perkins v.\nMatthews, the Supreme Court held that municipal annexation is a “‘standard, practice or\nprocedure with respect to voting’” that is subject to preclearance under section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act. 400 U.S. 379, 388 (1971) (quoting Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 5, 42\nU.S.C. § 1973c). Sections 2 and 5, however, “combat different evils and . . . impose very\ndifferent duties upon the States.” See Bossier Parish, 520 U.S. 471, 477 (1997). We only\nassume, arguendo, that the City of Belle Glade’s refusal to annex the Okeechobee Center is\na “standard, practice, or procedure” that gives rise to a claim under section 2. 42 U.S.C. §\n1973(a). But see Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 884 (1994) (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined\nby Rehnquist, C.J.) (“[W]e think it quite improbable to suggest that a § 2 dilution challenge\ncould be brought to a town’s existing political boundaries (in an attempt to force it to annex\nsurrounding land) by arguing that the current boundaries dilute a racial group’s voting\nstrength in comparison to the proposed new boundaries.”).\n\n                                             35\n\fredress either of Appellants’ alleged injuries -- vote denial or vote dilution.23\n\n\n\n                                            1.\n\n                                      Vote Denial\n\n       Vote denial occurs when a state, or here a municipality, employs a “standard,\n\npractice, or procedure” that results in the denial of the right to vote on account of race.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(a). To prevail, Appellants must prove that, “under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, . . . the political processes . . . are not equally open to participation by\n\n[members of a protected class] . . . in that its members have less opportunity than other\n\nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b). In making this determination,\n\n“a court must assess the impact of the contested structure or practice on minority\n\nelectoral opportunities ‘on the basis of objective factors.’” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44\n\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 27, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 205); see factors\n\nlisted supra note 20.\n\n       Appellants have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n\nthey were denied the right to vote on account of race. First, they have not offered any\n\nevidence of a “‘history of official discrimination in the state or political subdivision\n\n\n       23\n         We address the availability of a remedy as part of Appellants’ prima facie case of\nvote dilution.\n\n                                            36\n\fthat touched the right of the members of the minority group to register, to vote, or\n\notherwise to participate in the democratic process.’” Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36-37\n\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 28, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206). Although\n\nAppellants have presented evidence of housing segregation in Belle Glade and in the\n\ntwo centers, we can find no evidence of any discrimination with respect to voting.\n\nSecond, there is no evidence that Belle Glade uses or used any “‘voting practices or\n\nprocedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority\n\ngroup.’” Id. at 37 (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 28, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\nat 206). Third, we can find no evidence in this record that the black citizens of Belle\n\nGlade “‘bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment and\n\nhealth, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process.’”\n\nId. (quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 28, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206). Lastly,\n\nthere is no evidence of any “‘significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected\n\nofficials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group.’” Id.\n\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 97-417 at 28, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207). Nor is\n\nthere any circumstantial evidence tending to suggest that the tenants of the\n\nOkeechobee Center were denied the right to vote on account of their race. Simply put,\n\nAppellants have failed to meet their burden of proving vote denial under section 2 of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act.\n\n                                           2.\n\n                                           37\n\f                                      Vote Dilution\n\n       In contrast, vote dilution occurs when an election practice results in the dilution\n\nof minority voting strength and, thus, impairs a minority’s ability to elect the\n\nrepresentative of its choice.\n\n       In Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court identified three threshold\n\npreconditions for establishing a section 2 vote dilution claim: (1) “the minority group\n\nmust be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact\n\nto constitute a majority in a single-member district”; (2) “the minority group must be\n\nable to show that it is politically cohesive”; and (3) “the minority group must be able\n\nto demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . .\n\nusually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.”24 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986).\n\nProof of each of these Gingles factors is necessary, but not sufficient, to prevail under\n\na section 2 vote dilution claim. See id. at 50. Upon successfully establishing each of\n\nthe Gingles prerequisites, plaintiffs also must show that, under the totality of the\n\n\n       24\n         The Supreme Court has recognized that the Gingles factors “cannot be applied\nmechanically without regard to the nature of the claim.” Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146,\n158 (1993). To date, the Court has applied these factors to section 2 vote dilution claims\nchallenging multi-member districts, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48-51; single-member districts,\nsee Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40 (1993); and majority-minority districts, see\nVoinovich, 507 U.S. at 153-54. Moreover, in Brooks v. Miller, we recently applied the\nGingles factors to a section 2 claim challenging a majority vote requirement. See 158 F.3d\n1230, 1239 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 67 U.S.L.W. 3614 (U.S. May 24, 1999) (No. 98-\n1521). No court has ever addressed, however, whether the Gingles factors apply to a vote\ndilution claim premised on a failure to annex. Because Appellants have failed to meet the\nthree Gingles preconditions, we have no need to reach the merits of this question either.\n\n                                            38\n\fcircumstances, the challenged electoral scheme deprives them of “an equal measure\n\nof political and electoral opportunity” to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choosing. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1013 (1994).\n\n\n\n       Appellants have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to any of the\n\nthree Gingles prerequisites, and, therefore, their section 2 vote dilution claim must fail\n\nas well. We address each Gingles factor in turn.\n\n       We have repeatedly construed the first Gingles factor as requiring a plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate the existence of a proper remedy. See Brooks v. Miller, 158 F.3d 1230,\n\n1239 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 67 U.S.L.W. 3614 (U.S. May 24, 1999) (No. 98-\n\n1521); Davis v. Chiles, 139 F.3d 1414, 1419 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, ___\n\nU.S.___, 119 S. Ct. 1139 (1999); Southern Christian Leadership Conference v.\n\nSessions, 56 F.3d 1281, 1289, 1294-97 (11th Cir. 1995) (en banc); Nipper v. Smith,\n\n39 F.3d 1494, 1530-31 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc). This requirement simply serves\n\n“‘to establish that the minority has the potential to elect a representative of its own\n\nchoice from some single-member district.’” Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1530 (quoting Growe\n\nv. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40 (1993)). Thus, if a minority cannot establish that an\n\nalternate election scheme exists that would provide better access to the political\n\nprocess, then the challenged voting practice is not responsible for the claimed injury.\n\nSee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50. As we explained in Nipper:\n\n                                            39\n\f              The inquiries into remedy and liability . . . cannot be\n              separated: A district court must determine as part of the\n              Gingles threshold inquiry whether it can fashion a\n              permissible remedy in the particular context of the\n              challenged system.\n\n              ....\n\n              . . . The absence of an available remedy is not only relevant\n              at the remedial stage of the litigation but also precludes,\n              under the totality of the circumstances inquiry, a finding of\n              liability.\n\n39 F.3d at 1530-31, 1533. Accordingly, the failure to establish the first Gingles factor\n\n-- the availability of a remedy -- is fatal to a plaintiff’s section 2 claim.\n\n       Appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that court-ordered\n\nannexation and an injunction against future discrimination in annexation decisions are\n\nnot available remedies under the Voting Rights Act. We disagree. Specifically,\n\nAppellants prayed for two different forms of relief to redress their section 2 claims:\n\nan order requiring Belle Glade “to take all steps necessary to effectuate the annexation\n\nof the Okeechobee Center” into Belle Glade, and an injunction prohibiting Belle\n\nGlade “from enforcing any and all racially discriminatory policy(ies) in their decisions\n\nas to which parcels of land to annex.”25 Neither of these remedies are appropriate.\n\n       Court-ordered annexation is a remedy of unprecedented scope and magnitude.\n\n\n\n       25\n        Notably, Appellants have not sought the wholly impracticable remedy of deannexing\nthe Osceola Center, after close to forty years of Belle Glade citizenship.\n\n                                            40\n\fIndeed, we are not surprised that Appellants cannot point to a single case, nor have we\n\nbeen able to find one, that has ordered so unusual a remedy. For it is one thing for a\n\ncourt sitting in equity to proscribe policymakers from employing unambiguously\n\nracial bases for decision-making and to order government entities to make annexation\n\ndecisions on race-neutral grounds, but it is quite another to force a municipality to\n\nexpand its physical boundaries by annexation. Moreover, court-ordered annexation\n\nwould bypass an inherently complex political process. A municipality’s decision\n\nwhen and where to annex unincorporated property requires a series of carefully-\n\ncalibrated political and economic judgments.             For example, a municipality\n\nundoubtedly must consider whether the property is reasonably compact and\n\ncontiguous to the municipality, whether it contains a sufficient financial base, whether\n\nannexation will require a substantial increase in municipal services, and whether\n\nannexation will confer any non-pecuniary benefits to the municipality. Only after\n\nmeasured evaluation of these and other factors would a municipality elect to proceed\n\nwith annexation. In stark contrast, court-ordered annexation circumvents this political\n\nprocess, and may result in numerous unintended adverse consequences.26\n\n       26\n         Moreover, to the extent court-ordered annexation would require the municipality to\nraise taxes in order to absorb the new property, the remedy would run up against Supreme\nCourt precedent in school desegregation cases. In such cases, the Supreme Court has held\nthat court-ordered tax increases contravene “the principles of comity that must govern the\nexercise of the District Court’s equitable discretion.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 50\n(1990); see also Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276 (1990) (noting that court’s\n“broad equitable powers” to remedy past discrimination are not unlimited and should “take\n\n                                            41\n\f      We do not suggest that a federal court would never have the power to order\n\nannexation. It is enough for us to conclude that the extraordinary and unprecedented\n\nremedy of court-ordered annexation is wholly inappropriate on the facts presented.\n\nThis conclusion in no way rests on a determination that Florida law prohibits\n\nannexation of the Okeechobee Center. Indeed, we agree with the parties that where\n\nfederal statutory or constitutional rights have been violated, state law will not impede\n\na court from fashioning an appropriate remedy. See Armstrong v. Adams, 869 F.2d\n\n410, 414 (8th Cir. 1989). We find on this record only that the district court did not err\n\nin concluding that court-ordered annexation was an inappropriate remedy to redress\n\nAppellants’ claims under the Voting Rights Act.\n\n      Turning to Appellants’ alternate remedy, the district court correctly determined\n\nthat an injunction ordering the City not to discriminate in future annexation decisions\n\nwould not satisfy the specificity requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nUnder Rule 65(d), “[e]very order granting an injunction and every restraining order\n\nshall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; [and] shall\n\ndescribe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document,\n\nthe act or acts sought to be restrained.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d). This specificity\n\nrequirement is necessary “to protect those who are enjoined ‘by informing them of\n\n\ninto account the interests of state and local authorities in managing their own affairs”\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n\n                                           42\n\fwhat they are called upon to do or to refrain from doing in order to comply with the\n\ninjunction or restraining order.’” Hughey v. JMS Dev. Corp., 78 F.3d 1523, 1531\n\n(11th Cir. 1996) (quoting 11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay\n\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2955 (2d ed. 1995) (footnotes omitted)).\n\nThus, an injunction must “contain ‘an operative command capable of enforcement.’”\n\nId. (quoting International Longshoremen’s Ass’n v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Ass’n,\n\n389 U.S. 64, 73-74 (1967)). For example, in Payne v. Travenol Labs., Inc., 565 F.2d\n\n895 (5th Cir. 1978), the former Fifth Circuit27 considered an injunction that prohibited\n\n“discriminating on the basis of color, race, or sex in employment practices or\n\nconditions of employment.” Id. at 897. Invalidating the injunction for failure to\n\nsatisfy Rule 65(d)’s specificity requirement, the Court reasoned that where the terms\n\nof the injunction are as general as Title VII itself, the injunction does no more than\n\ninstruct a defendant to “obey the law.” Id. at 898. A court is incapable of enforcing\n\nso broad and vague an injunction.\n\n       Appellants seek to enjoin the City from discriminating on the basis of race in\n\nits annexation decisions. As this injunction would do no more than instruct the City\n\nto “obey the law,” we believe that it would not satisfy the specificity requirements of\n\n\n\n       27\n         In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this\nCourt adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down\nprior to October 1, 1981.\n\n                                            43\n\fRule 65(d) and that it would be incapable of enforcement. See Payne, 565 F.2d at\n\n898. In short, an injunction prohibiting the City from discriminating against the\n\nOkeechobee Center in future annexation decisions is not an available remedy to\n\nredress Appellants’ alleged injuries.\n\n      On this record, Appellants have not established a genuine issue of material fact\n\nas to the existence of an appropriate remedy sufficient to satisfy the first Gingles\n\nprerequisite. Notwithstanding Appellants’ failure to identify a suitable remedy, “a\n\nfederal court should not dismiss a meritorious constitutional claim because the\n\ncomplaint seeks one remedy rather than another plainly appropriate one.” Holt Civic\n\nClub v. City of Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 65 (1978). However, we cannot conceive\n\nof an alternative remedy for Appellants’ claims. In short, we hold that Appellants\n\ncannot meet the first Gingles prerequisite.\n\n      Although the absence of an available remedy is dispositive of Appellants’\n\nclaim, we nonetheless consider the second and third Gingles factors. Appellant’s have\n\nsimilarly failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to either of these\n\nelements. The second factor requires a showing that the minority group is politically\n\ncohesive, while the third demands proof of a majority white voting bloc sufficient to\n\ndefeat the minority’s preferred candidates. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51. In other\n\nwords, “[p]roof of the second and third Gingles factors . . . is circumstantial evidence\n\nof racial bias operating through the electoral system to deny minority voters equal\n\n                                          44\n\faccess to the political process.” Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1524. The existence of these\n\nfactors, together with an appropriate remedy, as well as an assessment under the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, generally will be sufficient to establish that the\n\nchallenged practice allows racial bias to dilute the voting strength of the minority\n\npopulation. See id. at 1524-25.\n\n      Here, Appellants have offered no evidence of political cohesion or a majority\n\nwhite voting bloc. Indeed, as discussed earlier, Appellants’ only evidence concerns\n\nallegations of Appellees’ discriminatory intent. This evidence is wholly insufficient\n\nto meet the requirements of the Gingles factors. Given the dearth of relevant evidence\n\nas to Appellants’ section 2 vote dilution claim, Appellants have failed to establish a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact concerning the second or third prerequisite under\n\nGingles. We conclude, therefore, that Appellants have also failed to establish a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to vote dilution, and hold that the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment to Appellees on both of Appellants’ section 2\n\nclaims.\n\n\n\n                                          C.\n\n                      Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\n      There are two distinct causes of action arising under Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d to 2000d-4a. First, the Supreme Court has recognized\n\n                                          45\n\fa private cause of action to enforce section 601, which prohibits any recipient of\n\nfederal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national\n\norigin in any federally funded program.28 See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287,\n\n293-94 (1985); Guardians Ass’n v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 463 U.S. 582, 607 n.27\n\n(1983); id. at 608 n.1 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); see also Franklin v.\n\nGwinnett County Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 70 (1992). To state such a claim, a plaintiff\n\nmust establish discriminatory intent. See Alexander, 469 U.S. at 293. Accordingly,\n\nTitle VI’s protection extends no further than that already afforded under the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See United States v. Fordice, 505\n\nU.S. 717, 732 n.7 (1992); Elston v. Talladega County Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394,\n\n1405 n.11, 1406 (11th Cir. 1993) (citing Alexander, 469 U.S. at 293; Guardians, 463\n\nU.S. at 584 n.2; Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v. Georgia, 775\n\nF.2d 1403, 1417 (11th Cir. 1985)).\n\n       Second, we have recognized an implied private right of action to enforce the\n\nregulations promulgated under section 602 of Title VI.29 See Elston, 997 F.2d 1407;\n\n\n       28\n         Section 601 of Title VI provides: “No person in the United States shall, on the\nground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal\nfinancial assistance.” Civil Rights Act of 1964 § 601, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\n       29\n        Section 602 of Title VI provides:\n\n                   Each Federal department and agency which is\n              empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any\n\n                                             46\n\fGeorgia State Conference, 775 F.2d at 1417. These regulations prohibit recipients of\n\nfederal funds from taking any action that results in disparate impact or discriminatory\n\n\n\n\n             program or activity, by way of grant, loan, or contract other than\n             a contract of insurance or guaranty, is authorized and directed to\n             effectuate the provisions of section 2000d of this title with\n             respect to such program or activity by issuing rules, regulations,\n             or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with\n             achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the\n             financial assistance in connection with which the action is taken.\n             No such rule, regulation, or order shall become effective unless\n             and until approved by the President. Compliance with any\n             requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected (1)\n             by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue assistance\n             under such program or activity to any recipient as to whom there\n             has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for\n             hearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement, but such\n             termination or refusal shall be limited to the particular political\n             entity, or part thereof, or other recipient as to whom such a\n             finding has been made and, shall be limited in its effect to the\n             particular program, or part thereof, in which such\n             noncompliance has been so found, or (2) by any other means\n             authorized by law: Provided, however, That no such action\n             shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has\n             advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to\n             comply with the requirement and has determined that\n             compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means. In the case\n             of any action terminating, or refusing to grant or continue,\n             assistance because of failure to comply with a requirement\n             imposed pursuant to this section, the head of the Federal\n             department or agency shall file with the committees of the\n             House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the\n             program or activity involved a full written report of the\n             circumstances and the grounds for such action.

First, they assert\n\nthat the BGHA intentionally discriminated against the tenants of the Okeechobee\n\nCenter on the basis of race in violation of section 601 of Title VI by refusing to\n\npetition for annexation. Second, Appellants allege that the BGHA’s failure to petition\n\nresulted in discriminatory effects on the basis of race in violation of the disparate\n\nimpact regulations promulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI. The district court\n\ngranted the BGHA         summary judgment sua sponte on both of these claims,\n\nspecifically concluding that no meaningful relief could be fashioned to remedy the\n\nalleged wrong. Appellants contend that this decision was error. Even if the district\n\ncourt were correct that it could not order annexation, Appellants argue that the court\n\ncould have ordered the BGHA to equalize the benefits and services between the two\n\ncenters. Appellants contend, for example, that the City levies a 50% surcharge for\n\nwater on the Okeechobee Center tenants. The City does not impose this charge on the\n\nOsceola Center tenants because that center is located within the City’s municipal\n\nboundaries. Although we conclude that the district court properly granted summary\n\njudgement sua sponte31 to Appellee BGHA with respect to Appellants’ claim arising\n\n       31\n         Contrary to the district court’s suggestion that Appellants’ Title VI claims were\nproperly presented on motion, we believe that the district court entered summary judgment\nas to these claims sua sponte. See Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1187 n.11. The City only moved\nfor summary judgment on Appellants’ Voting Rights Act claims on the ground that, as a\nmatter of law, it could not be compelled to annex the Okeechobee Center. The district court\nconcluded that the unavailability of the equitable remedy of compelled annexation barred all\nof Appellants’ claims. However, because the unavailability of court-ordered annexation is\n\n                                            49\n\funder section 601, our review of the record compels the conclusion that Appellants\n\nwere not afforded a sufficient opportunity to be heard on their disparate impact claim\n\narising from the regulations promulgated under section 602 of Title VI.\n\n      A district court possesses the power to enter summary judgment sua sponte\n\nprovided the losing party “was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her\n\nevidence.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986). Under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(c), motions for summary judgment must be served on opponents at least ten\n\ndays prior to the hearing. As we have long recognized, “this notice provision is not\n\nan unimportant technicality, but a vital procedural safeguard” to a party’s right to offer\n\nthe best defense to any challenge. Massey v. Congress Life Ins. Co., 116 F.3d 1414,\n\n1417 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing National Fire Ins. v. Bartolazo, 27 F.3d 518, 520 (11th\n\nCir. 1994); Hanson v. Polk County Land, Inc., 608 F.2d 129, 131 (5th Cir. 1979)).\n\nBut so long as the party against whom judgment will be entered is given sufficient\n\nadvance notice and has been afforded an adequate opportunity to demonstrate why\n\nsummary judgment should not be granted, then granting summary judgment sua\n\nsponte is entirely appropriate. See 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary\n\nKay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2720 (3d ed. 1998).\n\n      Appellants could survive summary judgment on their claim arising under\n\n\nnot dispositive of Appellants’ Title VI claims against the BGHA, we cannot say that any\nparty had, in fact, moved for summary judgment on the Title VI claims.\n\n                                           50\n\fsection 601 only if they establish a genuine issue of material fact as to the BGHA’s\n\ndiscriminatory intent after June 13, 1991, four years prior to the initiation of this\n\nlawsuit.32 Appellants’ § 1983 claims also required proof of discriminatory intent\n\nduring that same period. However, because Appellants themselves moved for\n\nsummary judgment on their § 1983 claims, it follows that they, in fact, had more than\n\nreasonable opportunity to marshal the same evidence of intent in support of their Title\n\nVI claim as well. And since Appellants plainly failed to adduce sufficient evidence\n\nas to intent with respect to any portion of their § 1983 claims, it likewise follows a\n\nfortiori that they could not present sufficient evidence of intent as to this Title VI\n\nclaim either. Thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment sua sponte\n\nto the BGHA as to Appellants’ section 601 claim.\n\n       In contrast, Appellants were not afforded sufficient opportunity to defend\n\nagainst summary judgment with respect to their cause of action to enforce the\n\ndisparate impact regulations promulgated under section 602 of Title VI. To survive\n\nsummary judgment, in this context, Appellants must establish, among other things, a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether the BGHA’s failure to petition for\n\nannexation of the Okeechobee Center resulted in a disparate impact on the\n\n\n\n       32\n         This claim is also governed by Florida’s four-year residual personal injury statute\nof limitations. See Rozar v. Mullis, 85 F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir. 1996) (holding that Title VI\nclaims are governed by the same statute of limitations applicable to § 1983 claims).\n\n                                             51\n\fOkeechobee Center tenants on the basis of race. See Elston, 997 F.2d at 1407.\n\nAppellants simply did not have an opportunity to develop or marshal this type of\n\nevidence. As we have observed, Appellants’ § 1983 claims turned on evidence of the\n\nCity’s discriminatory intent in refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1995.\n\nMoreover, Appellants’ claims under the Voting Rights Act required evidence of an\n\navailable remedy -- court-ordered annexation or an injunction prohibiting the City\n\nfrom discriminating on the basis of race. But the evidence required to establish these\n\nclaims is not dispositive of any disparate impact the BGHA’s actions may have had\n\non the Okeechobee Center tenants. The record is incomplete and issue has not been\n\njoined on this matter. We conclude, therefore, that the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment sua sponte to Appellee BGHA on Appellants’ action to enforce\n\nthe disparate impact regulations promulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI, and\n\nwe remand this claim to the district court to provide the parties with an opportunity\n\nto develop the record as to this distinct claim.33\n\n\n\n\n                                          III.\n\n      In sum, we hold that Appellants have failed to establish a genuine issue of\n\n\n      33\n       Appellants also move this Court to reassign the case on remand to another judge.\nWe can find no basis in this record to do so, and, accordingly, deny this application.\n\n                                           52\n\fmaterial fact in support of their claims arising under § 1983, section 2 of the Voting\n\nRights Act of 1965, and section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and\n\nthat the district court properly entered summary judgment as to each of these claims.\n\nHowever, with respect to Appellants’ claim arising under disparate impact regulations\n\npromulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI, we conclude that the district court\n\nimprovidently granted summary judgment to Appellee BGHA. Accordingly, the\n\njudgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and\n\nREMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\f",

Specifically, Appellants contend that the City\n\nfailed to annex the housing project for racial reasons in violation of the First,\n\nThirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\n\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964 and its implementing regulations. After extensive pre-trial proceedings, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees, the City of Belle\n\nGlade and others, on all counts, finding neither a constitutional nor a statutory\n\nviolation.\n\n      On appeal, Appellants challenge the district court’s order on three basic\n\ngrounds: first, the district court purportedly erred in concluding that Appellants failed\n\nto raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Appellees’ discriminatory intent; second,\n\nthe district court also erred in holding that the remedies they sought -- including the\n\nunusual remedy of ordering a city to annex property into its municipal boundaries --\n\nwere neither available under the Voting Rights Act nor permissible under the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure; and finally, the district court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment sua sponte to Appellees on Appellants’ Title VI claims. After thoroughly\n\nreviewing the record and the parties’ briefs, we affirm the district court’s judgment\n\nconcerning Appellants’ constitutional and Voting Rights Act claims, as well as the\n\nTitle VI statutory claim, but reverse and remand Appellants’ cause of action to enforce\n\n                                           2\n\fTitle VI’s disparate impact regulations for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n                                         I.\n\n      The historical facts and the procedural history necessary to understand this\n\nlawsuit are complex and extensive. At the core, however, this legal battle has been\n\nfought over the refusal of the City of Belle Glade (“City”) to annex an adjacent\n\nhousing project known as the Okeechobee Center Farmers’ Home Administration\n\nProject (“Okeechobee Center”) into its geographic and municipal boundaries.\n\n      The City of Belle Glade is an incorporated municipality located on the western\n\nside of Palm Beach County, near Florida’s agricultural heartland. In the 1930s, the\n\nfederal government created two housing projects outside the city limits. One of them,\n\nknown as the Osceola Center, was populated by whites and stood at the City’s\n\nnorthwest corner. The other, the Okeechobee Center, was populated by blacks and\n\nwas located to the southwest of the City. In 1947, the City created the Belle Glade\n\nHousing Authority (“BGHA”), a board of seven members nominated by the mayor\n\nand appointed by the City Commission, to address the “shortage of safe sanitary\n\ndwelling accommodations in the City of Belle Glade available to persons of low\n\nincome at rentals they can afford.” The BGHA assumed ownership and operation of\n\nboth the Osceola and Okeechobee Centers. The centers, however, remain funded in\n\n                                         3\n\fpart by the federal government through grants from the Department of Agriculture.\n\n“Jim Crow” laws required both housing projects to be segregated by race.1 During\n\nthis time, the City also mandated residential segregation. See, e.g., Belle Glade, Fla.,\n\nOrdinance 45, 184, 273, 443 (Nov. 18, 1931, Sept. 18, 1936, January 12, 1938,\n\nDecember 27, 1939). These ordinances were repealed, however, by 1963. See Belle\n\nGlade, Fla., Ordinance 63-11, § 1 (April 24, 1963) (repealing Belle Glade, Fla., Code\n\n§§ 26-14 to -17 (relating to zoning)).\n\n       In 1960, the total population of the City of Belle Glade was 11,273, of which\n\n7,393 (65.6%) were non-whites and 3,880 (34.4%) were whites.2 The following year,\n\nthe City proposed, for the first time, extending its municipal boundaries by annexing\n\nboth the Okeechobee and Osceola Centers. The City asked the property owner,\n\n\n       1\n        In March 1975, however, a group of tenants brought suit in federal district court\nagainst the Secretary of Agriculture and various local housing authorities under Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 to integrate the centers. See Mae Golden Acres Tenants’ Ass’n\nv. Butz, No. 75-1161-CIV-JE (S.D. Fla. 1975). On July 19, 1977, the district court entered\na stipulation for consent judgment in the Mae Golden Acres litigation, which provided that\nthe BGHA would no longer segregate the Osceola and Okeechobee Centers by race and\nwould administer the projects according to racially non-discriminatory policies. This\nsettlement marked the formal end of de jure segregation at the Osceola and Okeechobee\nCenters.\n       2\n       As of 1970, the total population of Belle Glade increased to 15,949, of which the\npercentage of blacks decreased to 52.9% while the percentage of whites increased to 46.5%.\nBy 1993, a special census showed that the City’s total population had increased further to\n17,208, the population of blacks increasing to 54.8% and the white population decreasing to\n39.6%. As of May 24, 1994, the population of the Osceola Center was 46% black, 50%\nHispanic, and 4% white, whereas the population of the Okeechobee Center was 92% black\nand 8% Hispanic.\n\n                                             4\n\fBGHA, whether it had any views on the matter. After discussing the possible\n\nadvantages and disadvantages, the BGHA ultimately petitioned to the City only for\n\nannexation of the Osceola Center. Soon thereafter, on April 26, 1961, the City\n\nCommission considered the BGHA’s petition and unanimously annexed the Osceola\n\nCenter.\n\n      In the 1970s, the City and the BGHA twice considered the possibility of\n\nannexing the Okeechobee Center. In 1971, the City Commission’s minutes simply\n\nreflect that a meeting was to be arranged between the City Commission and the\n\nBGHA to discuss the possibility of annexing the Okeechobee Center. The minutes\n\nmake no mention, however, of who made the annexation request or whether any\n\nmeeting was ever held. Two years later, on February 26, 1973, a group of tenants\n\nfrom the Okeechobee Center asked the City Commission to annex the center. The\n\nCity Commission advised the tenants that it would consider annexation if the BGHA\n\nmade the request. On April 17, 1973, the tenants asked the BGHA to petition the City\n\nfor annexation, but the BGHA denied their request in October 1973. The record does\n\nnot reflect whether the BGHA offered any reason for denying the request.\n\n      The following year, the Florida legislature repealed all local laws pertaining to\n\nthe adjustment of municipal boundaries and established a uniform legislative standard\n\nfor use throughout the state. See Municipal Annexation or Contraction Act, 1974 Fla.\n\nLaws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. §§ 171.021-.022 (West\n\n                                          5\n\f1987)). The statute specifically provided for the voluntary annexation of any property\n\ncontiguous to a municipality upon petition by the property owner to the municipality’s\n\ngoverning body. See 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla.\n\nStat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West Supp. 1998)). The City Commission also could initiate\n\nannexation of any contiguous, compact, and unincorporated property by a referendum\n\nof the registered voters of the municipality and the residents of the area proposed to\n\nbe annexed. See 1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-297, § 2 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 171.0413 (West. 1987 & Supp. 1998)).                 Notably, according to these\n\nprovisions, the statute prohibited municipalities from annexing any property that did\n\nnot meet the statute’s definition of contiguity. See 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1\n\n(codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.031(11) (West 1987)).3\n\n       Two attempts to secure the City’s annexation of the Okeechobee Center through\n\nlitigation occurred in 1980.4 Pursuant to a settlement agreement, the City and City\n\nCommission agreed to appoint an “Annexation Committee” to investigate and make\n\n\n       3\n        The parties dispute whether the Okeechobee Center is contiguous to the City, and,\nhence, available for annexation under Florida law. See discussion infra Part II.B.2.\n       4\n        In Okeechobee Center Cries for Help v. Belle Glade Housing Authority, No. 80-\n8220-CIV-JAG (S.D. Fla. 1980), tenants of the Okeechobee Center sued the City and the\nBGHA seeking, inter alia, a mandatory injunction requiring the defendants to take all steps\nnecessary to annex the Okeechobee Center into Belle Glade. Similarly, in Jackson v. City\nof Belle Glade, No. 80-8156-CIV-JAG (S.D. Fla. 1980), some Belle Glade residents brought\nsuit against the City and BGHA, seeking annexation of all black areas adjacent to the City\nThe parties eventually resolved both lawsuits prior to trial without the plaintiffs’ obtaining\nannexation and, in March 1984, the court dismissed the suits with prejudice.\n\n                                              6\n\frecommendations concerning the wisdom and efficacy of annexing the Okeechobee\n\nCenter.5 In November 1984, after the Committee held public hearings, received\n\ncomments from the public, investigated and considered the possibilities and\n\nramifications of annexation, and conducted a cost study of annexation, the Committee\n\nissued a report recommending against annexation on the grounds that the Okeechobee\n\nCenter did not satisfy Florida’s statutory contiguity requirement and that annexation\n\ndid not make reasonable economic sense for the City.6 However, the report also urged\n\nthe City Commission to consider other factors “relating to the humanitarian aspects\n\nof those residing in Okeechobee Center” in light of residents’ feelings “that\n\nannexation would right past ‘wrongs.’” On January 28, 1985, the City Commission\n\nofficially accepted the Annexation Committee’s report.\n\n       As far as the record reflects, the tenants’ efforts at annexing the Okeechobee\n\nCenter lay dormant for over ten years, until May 8, 1995, when Albert Peterson, a\n\nresident of the Okeechobee Center and President of the Resident’s Council of the\n\n\n       5\n        The City Commission appointed five members to this Committee: one member of the\nOkeechobee Center Tenant’s Association, one black resident of the City as recommended\nby the Panhellenic Council, and three additional members, at least one of whom had to be\na member of a minority group.\n       6\n         Specifically, the report estimated the following capital outlay and first year start-up\ncosts: library services, $158,693; inspection, $8,000; fire, $442,000; streets $7,140; building\nand grounds, $18,640; garbage collection, $138,483; police, $133,724; and parks and\nrecreation, $119, 556.

On May 30, 1995, the Mayor denied Peterson’s request,\n\nconcluding that annexation would be “neither feasible nor advantageous to the City\n\nfrom the financial and public services perspective.” The Mayor’s letter summarized\n\nthe findings of “[a] study of this issue that was done a number of years ago”:\n\n                    Upon annexation, the City must provide the\n             following municipal services: water, sewer, police\n             protection, sanitation services, street lighting, street signs,\n             street paving, maintenance, drainage, parks and recreation.\n             Since the subject land is exempt from ad valorem taxes, no\n             property taxes would be generated to offset the cost of\n             providing the necessary services, which far outweigh any\n             miscellaneous revenues that might be realized.\n\n                     Other factors in determining the viability of annexing\n             the parcel included the following: 1) No need exists to\n             expand into the proposed parcel, 2) No industry would be\n             annexed, 3) The parcel would provide no additional\n             facilities to be brought into the City, 4) Annexation would\n             not improve the economy of the City, and 5) The\n             Comprehensive Plan would have to be revised thereby\n             compounding the expense to the City.\n\n                   City Attorney John Baker’s legal opinion was that\n             the City may not annex the property known as the\n             Okeechobee Center because the said property is not\n             contiguous to the municipal boundaries, and annexation is\n             therefore prohibited by Florida statutes.\n\nBecause “costs have risen, conditions have not changed, and the laws have not been\n\namended” since that study was conducted, the Mayor concluded that he would not\n\npropose annexation of the Okeechobee Center.\n\n                                           8\n\f      On June 12, 1995, four tenants of the Okeechobee Center7 and four black\n\nresidents of the City initiated this lawsuit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief\n\nagainst the City of Belle Glade, the Mayor of Belle Glade, the Belle Glade City\n\nCommission and its members, and the BGHA and its officers and members alleging\n\nthat the BGHA’s failure to petition for annexation and the City’s failure to annex the\n\nOkeechobee Center, as well as the City’s practice of annexing property populated by\n\nwhites, denied or abridged the rights of Appellants to vote on account of race or color\n\nin violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1994),\n\nand that these practices were adopted or purposefully maintained to dilute the voting\n\nstrength of Appellants and deprive them of their rights secured by the First,\n\nThirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,\n\nas enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994 & Supp. II 1996). Appellants further\n\nalleged that the BGHA’s failure to petition for annexation discriminated against the\n\ntenants of the Okeechobee Center on the basis of race, in violation of Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d to 2000d-4a (1994), and its\n\nimplementing regulations, 7 C.F.R. § 15.3 (1999).

Appellants subsequently filed an amended complaint.\n\n      Prior to trial, each side moved for summary judgment. The City filed a motion\n\non Appellants’ claims under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, arguing that because\n\nthe Okeechobee Center did not satisfy the statutory requirements for annexation set\n\nforth in Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West Supp. 1998), Appellants had no available\n\nremedy. Appellants, in turn, moved for summary judgment on their constitutional\n\nclaims. On May 20, 1997, the district court granted summary judgment for Appellees\n\non both the constitutional and Voting Rights Act claims. The court also granted\n\nsummary judgment sua sponte for the BGHA on the remaining Title VI claims.\n\nSpecifically, the district court held that because the Okeechobee Center was not\n\n“contiguous” to the City of Belle Glade, Florida law prohibited its annexation; that\n\nrace discrimination did not cause the City’s refusal to annex the Okeechobee Center;\n\nthat judicially-compelled annexation was not an available remedy under the Voting\n\nRights Act; that an injunction prohibiting the City from discriminating in future\n\nannexation decisions was not sufficiently specific to comply with Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 65(d); and, lastly, that there was no meaningful relief available for\n\nAppellants’ Title VI claim because, even if the district court ordered the BGHA to\n\npetition for annexation, Florida law still prohibited the City from granting the request.\n\n                                           10\n\fSee Burton v.

All reasonable doubts about the facts should be\n             resolved in favor of the non-movant. If the record presents\n             factual issues, the court must not decide them; it must deny\n             the motion and proceed to trial. Summary judgment may\n             be inappropriate even where the parties agree on the basic\n             facts, but disagree about the inferences that should be\n             drawn from these facts.

We observe at the outset, however, that in a very real sense these claims are distinct.\nThe Okeechobee Center tenants’ claimed injury stems from an allegedly improper racial\nmotive in Appellees’ annexation decisions concerning the Okeechobee Center. These\nallegations give rise to a traditional race discrimination claim under the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and a vote denial claim under the Fifteenth\nAmendment. In contrast, we construe the citizens of Belle Glade to complain that the BGHA\nand the City purposefully employed discriminatory practices to dilute the voting strength of\nblack citizens within the City’s boundaries. These discriminatory practices, if proved,\nallegedly injured Belle Glade citizens because they enjoyed the right to vote in Belle Glade.\nBecause the Okeechobee Center tenants never possessed a right to vote within the City,\nAppellants’ constitutional vote dilution claim may only be premised on the injuries of the\nBelle Glade citizens.

To the extent the district court suggested that it would exclude\nevidence of discrimination that preceded the 1995 act at issue -- the only act occurring within\nthe limitations period -- we believe that the district court erred. See City of Dothan, 745 F.2d\nat 1415-16 (holding that district court erred in excluding evidence of municipal decisions that\noccurred outside the statute of limitations period on ground that evidence was relevant to\nissue of defendant’s later discriminatory intent).

Taken together, they argue, these categories of evidence raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether race was a substantial or motivating factor\n\nin the City’s 1995 decision to refuse annexation of the Okeechobee Center. We are\n\nnot persuaded by Appellants’ arguments either standing alone or in concert, but\n\nconsider each in turn.\n\n                                              1.\n\n                              De Jure Racial Classification\n\n\n\n\nfact, consider all of Appellants’ evidence, see Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1182, and because an\nexamination of all of the proffered evidence does not alter the result, any error plainly would\nbe harmless.\n\n                                              17\n\f      Appellants first argue that the City’s annexation of the Osceola Center\n\nconstituted the enforcement of a de jure racial classification. Because Belle Glade\n\nordinances required racial segregation in residential housing, Appellants contend that\n\nthe City’s annexation of the Osceola Center back in 1961 constituted the enforcement\n\nof a de jure racial classification. Appellants, therefore, assert that the district court\n\nerred in failing to engage in the stringent review required for cases involving prior de\n\njure segregation. This claim is unavailing.\n\n      The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment is to prohibit states from discriminating against individuals on the basis\n\nof race. Plainly, where the racial classification appears on the face of the statute, no\n\ninquiry into legislative purpose is necessary. See Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642 (citing\n\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 272). Such racial classifications are presumptively invalid and\n\ncan only survive constitutional scrutiny if they are justified by a compelling state\n\ninterest and are narrowly tailored to serve that interest. See id. at 643. Moreover,\n\nAppellants argue that defendants should carry an even greater burden in this case, just\n\nas they do in the context of higher education. See United States v.

Where there is evidence that a current practice is “traceable” to\n\nor is “rooted” in a prior policy of segregation in education, defendants can only avoid\n\nliability by proving that the current policy does not have “continuing segregative\n\neffects or, even if it does, that there exists no practicable and educationally sound\n\n                                           18\n\fmeans of remedying any such effects.” Knight v.

In the\n\nfirst place, Appellants can point to no court that has ever applied Fordice outside of\n\nthe education setting. Indeed, given the unique nature of school desegregation, we\n\nhesitate to extend Fordice to a property annexation case. But even if we assume,\n\narguendo, that the analysis applies, Appellants have failed to demonstrate that the\n\nCity’s 1995 annexation decision is, in any way, “traceable” to or “rooted” in past de\n\njure segregation. Knight, 14 F.3d at 1540-41 (noting that plaintiff has burden of proof\n\nto show that challenged policy is “traceable” to past segregation). The City’s 1961\n\ndecision to annex the Osceola Center, the white housing project, and the concomitant\n\n“determination” not to annex the Okeechobee Center, the black housing project, when\n\nthe BGHA only petitioned for Osceola’s annexation, neither created a racial\n\nclassification nor enforced the City’s segregation laws. Although the two centers were\n\nsegregated by race in 1961, on this record there is simply no evidence that residential\n\nsegregation laws dictated which center the City annexed, or, indeed, that race played\n\nany role in the process. Moreover, there is no evidence that the City had any policy,\n\neither in 1961 or later, of making annexation decisions on the basis of the race of the\n\nresidents in the proposed annexation areas. It is even unclear on this record that the\n\n                                           19\n\fCity ever entertained a request to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1961, or, for that\n\nmatter, that the Okeechobee Center was similarly situated to the Osceola Center, let\n\nalone evidence showing that the decision to annex the Osceola Center was somehow\n\nbased on the race of its occupants. Non-discriminatory reasons were offered to\n\nexplain the Osceola annexation -- including evidence that the BGHA requested\n\nannexation to provide City police protection to the residents due to ongoing threats\n\nagainst the center’s manager -- and Appellants have presented nothing to rebut this.\n\nWhile it is undeniably true that the two centers were segregated by race in 1961,\n\nAppellants notably have been unable to draw some connection between that de jure\n\npolicy and the decision to annex the Osceola Center. Accordingly, we cannot find that\n\nthe City enforced any policy of racial classification in its annexation decisions.\n\nAbsent such evidence, the district court did not err in refusing to require Appellees to\n\npresent evidence of their efforts to remedy prior de jure segregation.\n\n      The very most Appellants could argue is that the existence of the City’s\n\nsegregation ordinances may have raised an inference of discriminatory intent back in\n\n1961. The existence of these ordinances, however, which were abolished more than\n\ntwenty years before the 1995 decision, can in no way transform this cause of action\n\ninto a challenge to the enforcement of a racial classification or de jure segregation.\n\n                                           2.\n\n                                Municipal Boundaries\n\n                                          20\n\f      Appellants also suggest that the municipal boundaries of the City of Belle Glade\n\nare so bizarre as to raise an inference of racially discriminatory intent under the racial\n\ngerrymandering case of Shaw v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). Appellants assert that\n\nthe City’s decision to annex State Road Number 80 in 1965 and its deliberate decision\n\nnot to annex the black population centers on either side of the highway, rendered the\n\nboundaries of Belle Glade bizarre. They argue, therefore, that this annexation is\n\nfacially suspect and triggers strict scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that\n\nthe district court again erred in failing to shift the burden to Appellees to produce\n\nevidence that the municipal boundary was shaped by decisions that were narrowly\n\ntailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. We find this argument\n\nsimilarly unpersuasive.\n\n      To establish that a districting scheme amounts to impermissible racial\n\ngerrymandering, a plaintiff bears the burden of proving that race was the predominant\n\nfactor in the legislature’s decision either through “‘circumstantial evidence of a\n\ndistrict’s shape and demographics’ or through ‘more direct evidence going to\n\nlegislative purpose.’” Shaw v.

As the Supreme Court\n\nexplained in Miller:\n\n             Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary\n             element of the constitutional wrong or a threshold\n             requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive\n\n                                           21\n\f              circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not\n              other districting principles, was the legislature’s dominant\n              and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.\n\n515 U.S. at 913. A plaintiff will not prevail, however, simply by pointing to the\n\nbizarre shape of a legislative district where the district lines are facially race neutral.\n\nUnder those circumstances, “a more searching inquiry is necessary before strict\n\nscrutiny can be found applicable.” Bush v.

Once a plaintiff proves that race was the predominant factor,\n\nhowever, the redistricting decision then becomes subject to strict scrutiny: it must be\n\njustified by a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that\n\ninterest. See Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 908 (citing Miller, 515 U.S. at 920).\n\n       Appellants’ Shaw argument faces multiple infirmities.12 To begin with, as far\n\nas we can discern, no court has ever applied Shaw outside the racial gerrymandering\n\n\n\n       12\n         It is unclear whether all of the Appellants have standing to bring a Fourteenth\nAmendment claim under Shaw. In United States v. Hays, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117965\"><a href=\"/opinion/117965/united-states-v-hays/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), the Supreme\nCourt held that plaintiffs who reside in a racially gerrymandered district have standing to\nchallenge a legislature’s reapportionment scheme. See id. at 745. For non-resident plaintiffs\nto have standing, however, the Court noted that they would have to show specific evidence\nthat they were personally subjected to a racial classification. See id. Here, the non-Belle-\nGlade-citizen Appellants would have to prove that they personally were not annexed into the\nCity on the basis of their race.\n\n                                             22\n\fcontext.   Moreover, Shaw and other racial gerrymandering cases are legally\n\ndistinguishable from the instant case. In racial gerrymandering cases, plaintiffs\n\ntypically challenge laws affirmatively enacted to alter the boundaries of voting\n\ndistricts. These jurisdictions are under an affirmative legal duty to alter their\n\nboundaries to reflect shifts or alterations in population. In sharp contrast, however,\n\nis a city’s right to determine if and when it will expand its municipal boundaries.\n\nAlthough the City of Belle Glade may well be bizarrely shaped, its contours were\n\ncreated over an extended time period as hundreds of individual parcels were brought\n\ninto its ambit incrementally; it was not created by a single scheme designed to exclude\n\nproperty on the basis of race. Cf. Chen v. City of Houston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387333/chen-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Tex. 1998) (refusing to apply strict scrutiny under Shaw solely based on\n\nbizarreness of city’s redistricting plan where repeated annexation, not districting\n\ndecision-making, caused irregular shape of districts). Moreover, not surprisingly,\n\nAppellants have been unable to show that the annexation of any specific piece of\n\nproperty, including the Okeechobee Center, would make the shape of the City of Belle\n\nGlade any less “bizarre.”\n\n      The central problem with Appellants’ argument is that the City’s shape has not\n\nbeen shown to have been created because of any affirmative annexation plan. Rather,\n\nthe City’s pattern of annexation over time merely reflects the aggregation of various\n\nowners’ requests for annexation, which the City generally approves so long as the\n\n                                          23\n\fproposed annexations satisfies the obligations of Florida law, and annexations\n\ninitiated solely by the City, which also must conform to Florida law and which City\n\nvoters and annex residents must approve by referendum. See Fla. Stat. Ann. §§\n\n171.044(1), 171.0413. Absent some other evidence, such as the circumstances\n\nsurrounding a multitude of other annexation decisions, the specific racial composition\n\nof each of these areas, whether the unincorporated areas ever requested annexation,\n\nor perhaps some comparison of the shapes of other Florida municipalities, we cannot\n\nfind that the municipal boundaries alone raise an inference of the City’s racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Thus, whether or not a Shaw analysis could apply in the context\n\nof municipal property annexation, the simple fact is that this record is wholly\n\ninsufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact to support a distinct claim under\n\nShaw.\n\n                                           3.\n\n                     Circumstantial Evidence of Discrimination\n\n        Finally, Appellants claim that the circumstantial evidence, when weighed\n\ntogether, establishes the City’s discriminatory motive or intent in refusing to annex\n\nthe Okeechobee Center in 1995. Indeed, Appellants argue that the City’s annexation\n\ndecisions cannot be explained in non-racial terms. Appellants, therefore, contend that\n\nthe district court erred in concluding that they failed to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether race was a substantial or motivating factor behind the\n\n                                          24\n\fCity’s 1995 decision to refuse annexation of the Okeechobee Center. See Arlington\n\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 265-66. Appellants also assert that the district court further erred\n\nin failing to shift the burden to Appellees to prove that, at the time of the\n\ndiscriminatory act, the same decision would have been made for a legitimate reason.\n\nSee Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287. Appellants are incorrect on both counts.\n\n      Turning to the circumstantial evidence surrounding the 1995 decision,\n\nAppellants contend that two additional pieces of evidence establish the City’s\n\ndiscriminatory purpose. Appellants argue that the City’s justification of costs in\n\nrefusing to annex the Okeechobee Center raises an inference of race discrimination\n\nbecause the City does not usually consider costs when deciding whether to annex\n\nproperty. Appellants also assert that the City’s view that Florida law prohibited\n\nannexation of the Okeechobee Center was a mere pretext for the City’s discriminatory\n\npurpose. Neither argument raises an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n      First, the City’s reliance on cost as a justification for refusing to annex the\n\nOkeechobee Center in 1995 does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the\n\nCity’s allegedly improper racial motive. Appellants have offered no evidence to\n\nsupport their contention that the City does not usually consider cost in making\n\nannexation decisions. However, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that some\n\ndisparity exists, we fail to see how reliance on cost here raises an inference of race\n\nanimus. As the Annexation Committee found back in 1984, providing the necessary\n\n                                           25\n\fmunicipal services to the Okeechobee Center would be a very expensive proposition\n\nfor the City of Belle Glade. Moreover, because the property is exempt from ad\n\nvalorem taxes, the City would enjoy little revenue to offset this expense. Thus, the\n\nCity’s reliance on costs was altogether reasonable under the circumstances. Indeed,\n\na Florida municipality has an obligation to its citizens to consider the economic impact\n\nof annexations.13 Therefore, we decline to accept Appellants’ suggestion that the\n\nCity’s reliance on cost was a pretext for race discrimination.\n\n       Second, the City’s conclusion that Florida law prohibited annexation of the\n\nOkeechobee center does not raise an inference of race discrimination. The parties do\n\nnot dispute that the Okeechobee Center could only be annexed if contiguous to the\n\nCity, and that its contiguity would arise only from its proximity to State Road Number\n\n       13\n        Section 171.021 provides:\n\n                     The purposes of this act are to set forth procedures for\n              adjusting the boundaries of municipalities through annexations\n              or contractions or corporate limits and to set forth criteria for\n              determining when annexations or contractions may take place so\n              as to:\n\n                      (1) Insure sound urban development and accommodation\n              to growth.\n                      (2) Establish uniform legislative standards throughout the\n              state for the adjustment of municipal boundaries.\n                      (3) Insure the efficient provision of urban services to\n              areas that become urban in character.\n                      (4) Insure that areas are not annexed unless municipal\n              services can be provided to those areas.\n\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 171.021.\n\n                                             26\n\f80, which the City annexed in 1965. Therefore, Okeechobee’s contiguity turns on\n\nwhether a municipality may use a previously annexed road to gain contiguity to\n\notherwise non-contiguous property. Florida law, however, is hotly disputed and far\n\nfrom settled on this question.\n\n       Since 1974, Florida law has provided that an owner of reasonably compact14\n\nproperty that is contiguous15 to a municipality may petition for annexation. See Fla.\n\nStat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West Supp. 1998). In 1977, the Florida Attorney General\n\nconsidered whether Florida law permitted a municipality to annex property only\n\n\n\n\n       14\n         “‘Compactness’ means concentration of a piece of property in a single area and\nprecludes any action which would create enclaves, pockets, or finger areas in serpentine\npatterns. Any annexation proceeding in any county in the state shall be designed in such a\nmanner as to ensure that the area will be reasonably compact.’” Fla. Stat. Ann.\n§ 171.031(12).\n       15\n          “‘Contiguous’ means that a substantial part of a boundary of the territory sought to\nbe annexed by the municipality is coterminous with a part of the boundary of the\nmunicipality. . . . However, nothing herein shall be construed to allow local rights-of-way,\nutility easements, railroad rights-of-way, or like entities to be annexed in a corridor fashion\nto gain contiguity . . . .” Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.031(11).\n        Prior to 1975, section 171.031(11) stated, in relevant part: “Local rights-of-way,\nutility easements, or railroad rights-of-way shall not be annexed in a corridor fashion to gain\ncontiguity nor shall such activity be deemed to establish the contiguity required under this\nact.” 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (emphasis added). Since the underscored language was\ndeleted in 1975, see 1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-297, Appellants contend that the statute only\nprohibits annexation of roads to gain contiguity, but it does not bar annexation of property\ncontiguous to a previously annexed road. Even assuming, arguendo, that Appellants’\nstatutory interpretation is correct -- and we have no need to resolve this question of Florida\nlaw today -- the amended language does not establish that the City’s statutory interpretation\nwas unreasonable.\n\n                                              27\n\fcontiguous to the municipality by virtue of a previously annexed road.16 See 1977 Fla.\n\nOp. Atty. Gen. 35. Recognizing that no Florida appellate court had considered the\n\nissue, the Attorney General concluded that a parcel may not be voluntarily annexed\n\nif it is only contiguous to the City by virtue of a previously annexed highway because\n\nsuch annexation would violate both Florida’s contiguity requirement and its\n\nprohibition against the creation of enclaves.

Then, in 1985, the Attorney\n\nGeneral considered whether a municipality could voluntarily annex property\n\ncontiguous on one side to a previously annexed, 125 foot-wide corridor of\n\nunimproved land, but otherwise surrounded by unincorporated property. See 1985\n\nFla. Op. Atty. Gen. 163. Although concluding that the city could not voluntarily\n\nannex the parcel because it would result in the creation of a prohibited enclave, the\n\nAttorney General found that Florida’s contiguity requirement would not prohibit the\n\nmunicipality from using the corridor of unimproved land to gain contiguity because\n\nthe statute did not apply to property annexed before 1974. Id. The Attorney General,\n\nhowever, never reconciled his finding of contiguity in the 1985 opinion with the\n\nconclusion he had reached eight years earlier.\n\n      Based on this undeniably conflicting authority, we conclude that the City’s\n\n\n      16\n        Although Florida Opinions of the Attorney General are not binding on this Court,\nthey “are entitled to careful consideration and generally should be regarded as highly\npersuasive” of matters of Florida law.

Even if we were to determine today that\n\nFlorida law permits annexation -- and the law is anything but clear as to this matter --\n\nwe would still conclude that the City’s interpretation was an altogether reasonable one\n\ngiven the plainly conflicting Attorney General opinions.17 In short, the City’s reliance\n\non the 1974 annexation statute cannot fairly be taken as being a pretext for race\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       The only other evidence presented by Appellants relates to the historical\n\nbackground to the City’s 1995 decision. However, “the historical background for a\n\ngiven decision is only one factor relative to intent. It does not, by itself, compel [a\n\ncourt] to find a discriminatory purpose behind every statute passed during regrettable\n\nperiods of [a state’s] past.” Hall v.

First, the City’s\n\n\n\n       17\n         Indeed, the district court determined that the City’s interpretation was correct as a\nmatter of statutory construction. See Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1183. According to the district\ncourt, the propriety of using a road annexation to gain contiguity cannot turn on the\nsubjective intent of the municipality in initially annexing the road. The court reasoned that\nthe Florida legislature could not have intended for so strange a construction. See id. at 1183-\n84. However, we need not reach the merits of this issue to resolve the instant case.\n        Concluding that the proposed annexation of the Okeechobee Center would have been\nillegal under Florida law since 1974, the district court also held that this statute was the\nintervening cause of Appellants’ injuries. See Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1183-84. Again, it\nis unnecessary to reach the merits of this issue.\n\n                                              29\n\fhousing ordinances mandated residential segregation until 1963. Second, the Osceola\n\nand Okeechobee Centers were segregated by race until 1977. Lastly, the BGHA failed\n\nto petition the Okeechobee Center in 1961 and 1973 and the City failed to annex in\n\n1961, 1971, and 1985. This evidence is far too remote and attenuated to be probative\n\nof any discriminatory purpose in 1995. Simply put, we fail to see how evidence of\n\npast residential segregation in housing, which ended almost twenty years before the\n\ndecision at issue, and which is wholly unconnected to any annexation decision, or a\n\nprior refusal to annex standing alone establishes any intent, let alone a discriminatory\n\none, in 1995. As we said in Holder, “past discrimination cannot, in the manner of\n\noriginal sin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful.” Id.

No jury could reasonably find for Appellants\n\nbased on this record. In the first place, the City’s reliance on cost -- a possible\n\nexpense to the City of close to one million dollars -- was an altogether reasonable\n\n                                           30\n\fbasis on which to refuse annexation. Second, the City’s reliance on Florida’s\n\ncontiguity requirement to deny annexation was likewise reasonable given the\n\nconflicting authority in Florida law, and in no way supports an inference of pretext for\n\nrace discrimination. Lastly, Appellants’ historical evidence, which at most arguably\n\nraised an inference of the City’s discriminatory intent in the 1960s and 1970s, offers\n\nno plausible connection between any conceivable discriminatory intent rooted in the\n\npast and the 1995 act at issue today. Taken together, this evidence does not raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to the City’s discriminatory intent in 1995.\n\n      Finally, the district court did not err in failing to consider the second prong of\n\nthe Mount Healthy test. If Appellants cannot first prove that race was a motivating\n\nfactor, there is no basis for shifting the burden to the City to determine whether, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, it would have made the same decision notwithstanding\n\nits racial motivation. See Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287. Accordingly, we hold that\n\nthe district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on\n\nAppellants’ § 1983 claims.\n\n\n\n                                          B.\n\n                     Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965\n\n      Appellants also contend that the BGHA’s refusal to petition and the City’s\n\nfailure to annex the Okeechobee Center violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act\n\n                                          31\n\fof 1965.

The district court also considered each of the required factors in a vote\n\ndilution claim, see infra II.B.2, and concluded that it doubted whether Appellants had\n\neven made a prima facie showing under section 2. See Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1186\n\nn.10. After thoroughly searching this record, we likewise conclude that Appellants\n\nhave failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to either vote denial or vote\n\ndilution under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.22 On the record presented, we agree\n\nwith the district court that court-ordered annexation is not an appropriate remedy to\n\n       21\n         Appellants’ vote dilution claim, we believe, may be premised only upon the claimed\ninjuries of Belle Glade’s black citizens. This is true because only those who enjoy the right\nto vote in Belle Glade may have their voting strength diluted by the City’s annexation\ndecisions. In contrast, Appellants’ vote denial claim may only arise from injuries of black\ntenants of the Okeechobee Center. See supra note 8.\n       22\n         We need not reach the question of whether a challenge to a city’s failure to annex\nadjacent property is cognizable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Thus, if a minority cannot establish that an\n\nalternate election scheme exists that would provide better access to the political\n\nprocess, then the challenged voting practice is not responsible for the claimed injury.\n\nSee Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50. As we explained in Nipper:\n\n                                            39\n\f              The inquiries into remedy and liability . . . cannot be\n              separated: A district court must determine as part of the\n              Gingles threshold inquiry whether it can fashion a\n              permissible remedy in the particular context of the\n              challenged system.\n\n              ....\n\n              . . . The absence of an available remedy is not only relevant\n              at the remedial stage of the litigation but also precludes,\n              under the totality of the circumstances inquiry, a finding of\n              liability.\n\n39 F.3d at 1530-31, 1533. Accordingly, the failure to establish the first Gingles factor\n\n-- the availability of a remedy -- is fatal to a plaintiff’s section 2 claim.\n\n       Appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that court-ordered\n\nannexation and an injunction against future discrimination in annexation decisions are\n\nnot available remedies under the Voting Rights Act. We disagree. Specifically,\n\nAppellants prayed for two different forms of relief to redress their section 2 claims:\n\nan order requiring Belle Glade “to take all steps necessary to effectuate the annexation\n\nof the Okeechobee Center” into Belle Glade, and an injunction prohibiting Belle\n\nGlade “from enforcing any and all racially discriminatory policy(ies) in their decisions\n\nas to which parcels of land to annex.”25 Neither of these remedies are appropriate.\n\n       Court-ordered annexation is a remedy of unprecedented scope and magnitude.\n\n\n\n       25\n        Notably, Appellants have not sought the wholly impracticable remedy of deannexing\nthe Osceola Center, after close to forty years of Belle Glade citizenship.\n\n                                            40\n\fIndeed, we are not surprised that Appellants cannot point to a single case, nor have we\n\nbeen able to find one, that has ordered so unusual a remedy. For it is one thing for a\n\ncourt sitting in equity to proscribe policymakers from employing unambiguously\n\nracial bases for decision-making and to order government entities to make annexation\n\ndecisions on race-neutral grounds, but it is quite another to force a municipality to\n\nexpand its physical boundaries by annexation. Moreover, court-ordered annexation\n\nwould bypass an inherently complex political process. A municipality’s decision\n\nwhen and where to annex unincorporated property requires a series of carefully-\n\ncalibrated political and economic judgments.             For example, a municipality\n\nundoubtedly must consider whether the property is reasonably compact and\n\ncontiguous to the municipality, whether it contains a sufficient financial base, whether\n\nannexation will require a substantial increase in municipal services, and whether\n\nannexation will confer any non-pecuniary benefits to the municipality. Only after\n\nmeasured evaluation of these and other factors would a municipality elect to proceed\n\nwith annexation. In stark contrast, court-ordered annexation circumvents this political\n\nprocess, and may result in numerous unintended adverse consequences.26\n\n       26\n         Moreover, to the extent court-ordered annexation would require the municipality to\nraise taxes in order to absorb the new property, the remedy would run up against Supreme\nCourt precedent in school desegregation cases. In such cases, the Supreme Court has held\nthat court-ordered tax increases contravene “the principles of comity that must govern the\nexercise of the District Court’s equitable discretion.” Missouri v.

It is enough for us to conclude that the extraordinary and unprecedented\n\nremedy of court-ordered annexation is wholly inappropriate on the facts presented.\n\nThis conclusion in no way rests on a determination that Florida law prohibits\n\nannexation of the Okeechobee Center. Indeed, we agree with the parties that where\n\nfederal statutory or constitutional rights have been violated, state law will not impede\n\na court from fashioning an appropriate remedy.

A court is incapable of enforcing\n\nso broad and vague an injunction.\n\n       Appellants seek to enjoin the City from discriminating on the basis of race in\n\nits annexation decisions. As this injunction would do no more than instruct the City\n\nto “obey the law,” we believe that it would not satisfy the specificity requirements of\n\n\n\n       27\n         In Bonner v.

See Payne, 565 F.2d at\n\n898. In short, an injunction prohibiting the City from discriminating against the\n\nOkeechobee Center in future annexation decisions is not an available remedy to\n\nredress Appellants’ alleged injuries.\n\n      On this record, Appellants have not established a genuine issue of material fact\n\nas to the existence of an appropriate remedy sufficient to satisfy the first Gingles\n\nprerequisite. Notwithstanding Appellants’ failure to identify a suitable remedy, “a\n\nfederal court should not dismiss a meritorious constitutional claim because the\n\ncomplaint seeks one remedy rather than another plainly appropriate one.” Holt Civic\n\nClub v. City of Tuscaloosa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109950\"><a href=\"/opinion/109950/holt-civic-club-v-tuscaloosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (1978). However, we cannot conceive\n\nof an alternative remedy for Appellants’ claims. In short, we hold that Appellants\n\ncannot meet the first Gingles prerequisite.\n\n      Although the absence of an available remedy is dispositive of Appellants’\n\nclaim, we nonetheless consider the second and third Gingles factors. Appellant’s have\n\nsimilarly failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to either of these\n\nelements. The second factor requires a showing that the minority group is politically\n\ncohesive, while the third demands proof of a majority white voting bloc sufficient to\n\ndefeat the minority’s preferred candidates. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51. In other\n\nwords, “[p]roof of the second and third Gingles factors . . . is circumstantial evidence\n\nof racial bias operating through the electoral system to deny minority voters equal\n\n                                          44\n\faccess to the political process.” Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1524. The existence of these\n\nfactors, together with an appropriate remedy, as well as an assessment under the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, generally will be sufficient to establish that the\n\nchallenged practice allows racial bias to dilute the voting strength of the minority\n\npopulation. See id. at 1524-25.\n\n      Here, Appellants have offered no evidence of political cohesion or a majority\n\nwhite voting bloc. Indeed, as discussed earlier, Appellants’ only evidence concerns\n\nallegations of Appellees’ discriminatory intent. This evidence is wholly insufficient\n\nto meet the requirements of the Gingles factors. Given the dearth of relevant evidence\n\nas to Appellants’ section 2 vote dilution claim, Appellants have failed to establish a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact concerning the second or third prerequisite under\n\nGingles. We conclude, therefore, that Appellants have also failed to establish a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to vote dilution, and hold that the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment to Appellees on both of Appellants’ section 2\n\nclaims.\n\n\n\n                                          C.\n\n                      Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\n      There are two distinct causes of action arising under Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d to 2000d-4a.

First, they assert\n\nthat the BGHA intentionally discriminated against the tenants of the Okeechobee\n\nCenter on the basis of race in violation of section 601 of Title VI by refusing to\n\npetition for annexation. Second, Appellants allege that the BGHA’s failure to petition\n\nresulted in discriminatory effects on the basis of race in violation of the disparate\n\nimpact regulations promulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI. The district court\n\ngranted the BGHA         summary judgment sua sponte on both of these claims,\n\nspecifically concluding that no meaningful relief could be fashioned to remedy the\n\nalleged wrong. Appellants contend that this decision was error. Even if the district\n\ncourt were correct that it could not order annexation, Appellants argue that the court\n\ncould have ordered the BGHA to equalize the benefits and services between the two\n\ncenters. Appellants contend, for example, that the City levies a 50% surcharge for\n\nwater on the Okeechobee Center tenants. The City does not impose this charge on the\n\nOsceola Center tenants because that center is located within the City’s municipal\n\nboundaries. Although we conclude that the district court properly granted summary\n\njudgement sua sponte31 to Appellee BGHA with respect to Appellants’ claim arising\n\n       31\n         Contrary to the district court’s suggestion that Appellants’ Title VI claims were\nproperly presented on motion, we believe that the district court entered summary judgment\nas to these claims sua sponte. See Burton, 966 F. Supp. at 1187 n.11. The City only moved\nfor summary judgment on Appellants’ Voting Rights Act claims on the ground that, as a\nmatter of law, it could not be compelled to annex the Okeechobee Center. The district court\nconcluded that the unavailability of the equitable remedy of compelled annexation barred all\nof Appellants’ claims. However, because the unavailability of court-ordered annexation is\n\n                                            49\n\funder section 601, our review of the record compels the conclusion that Appellants\n\nwere not afforded a sufficient opportunity to be heard on their disparate impact claim\n\narising from the regulations promulgated under section 602 of Title VI.\n\n      A district court possesses the power to enter summary judgment sua sponte\n\nprovided the losing party “was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her\n\nevidence.” Celotex Corp. v.

Under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(c), motions for summary judgment must be served on opponents at least ten\n\ndays prior to the hearing.

See 10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary\n\nKay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2720 (3d ed. 1998).\n\n      Appellants could survive summary judgment on their claim arising under\n\n\nnot dispositive of Appellants’ Title VI claims against the BGHA, we cannot say that any\nparty had, in fact, moved for summary judgment on the Title VI claims.\n\n                                           50\n\fsection 601 only if they establish a genuine issue of material fact as to the BGHA’s\n\ndiscriminatory intent after June 13, 1991, four years prior to the initiation of this\n\nlawsuit.32 Appellants’ § 1983 claims also required proof of discriminatory intent\n\nduring that same period. However, because Appellants themselves moved for\n\nsummary judgment on their § 1983 claims, it follows that they, in fact, had more than\n\nreasonable opportunity to marshal the same evidence of intent in support of their Title\n\nVI claim as well. And since Appellants plainly failed to adduce sufficient evidence\n\nas to intent with respect to any portion of their § 1983 claims, it likewise follows a\n\nfortiori that they could not present sufficient evidence of intent as to this Title VI\n\nclaim either. Thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment sua sponte\n\nto the BGHA as to Appellants’ section 601 claim.\n\n       In contrast, Appellants were not afforded sufficient opportunity to defend\n\nagainst summary judgment with respect to their cause of action to enforce the\n\ndisparate impact regulations promulgated under section 602 of Title VI. To survive\n\nsummary judgment, in this context, Appellants must establish, among other things, a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether the BGHA’s failure to petition for\n\nannexation of the Okeechobee Center resulted in a disparate impact on the\n\n\n\n       32\n         This claim is also governed by Florida’s four-year residual personal injury statute\nof limitations. See Rozar v. Mullis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718819\"><a href=\"/opinion/718819/catherine-rozar-wayne-beard-anita-ashley-vance-heard-royel-lee-hines/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 (11th Cir. 1996) (holding that Title VI\nclaims are governed by the same statute of limitations applicable to § 1983 claims).\n\n                                             51\n\fOkeechobee Center tenants on the basis of race. See Elston, 997 F.2d at 1407.\n\nAppellants simply did not have an opportunity to develop or marshal this type of\n\nevidence. As we have observed, Appellants’ § 1983 claims turned on evidence of the\n\nCity’s discriminatory intent in refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1995.\n\nMoreover, Appellants’ claims under the Voting Rights Act required evidence of an\n\navailable remedy -- court-ordered annexation or an injunction prohibiting the City\n\nfrom discriminating on the basis of race. But the evidence required to establish these\n\nclaims is not dispositive of any disparate impact the BGHA’s actions may have had\n\non the Okeechobee Center tenants. The record is incomplete and issue has not been\n\njoined on this matter. We conclude, therefore, that the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment sua sponte to Appellee BGHA on Appellants’ action to enforce\n\nthe disparate impact regulations promulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI, and\n\nwe remand this claim to the district court to provide the parties with an opportunity\n\nto develop the record as to this distinct claim.33\n\n\n\n\n                                          III.\n\n      In sum, we hold that Appellants have failed to establish a genuine issue of\n\n\n      33\n       Appellants also move this Court to reassign the case on remand to another judge.\nWe can find no basis in this record to do so, and, accordingly, deny this application.\n\n                                           52\n\fmaterial fact in support of their claims arising under § 1983, section 2 of the Voting\n\nRights Act of 1965, and section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and\n\nthat the district court properly entered summary judgment as to each of these claims.\n\nHowever, with respect to Appellants’ claim arising under disparate impact regulations\n\npromulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI, we conclude that the district court\n\nimprovidently granted summary judgment to Appellee BGHA. Accordingly, the\n\njudgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and\n\nREMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         53\n\f</pre>",
