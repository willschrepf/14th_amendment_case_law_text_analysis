For\nthe reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n\n                               I.\n\n   T.H. falls on the moderate-to-severe end of the autism\nspectrum. He is functionally non-verbal, in that he does not\noften use language spontaneously, and he is very sensitive to\nnoise. When this action was commenced, T.H. attended Bates\nMiddle School in Sumter County, South Carolina. His indi-\nvidual education plan (\"IEP\") for the 2005-06 school year cal-\nled for 15 hours per week of applied behavioral analysis\n(\"ABA\") therapy; the IEP for the 2006-07 school year called\nfor 27.5 hours per week of ABA therapy.\n\n  In the fall of 2005, the District was providing T.H. with\napproximately 7.5-10 hours per week of ABA therapy instead\n\f         SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN            3\nof the 15 hours required by the IEP. T.H. did not do well that\nfall, and he began exhibiting problematic \"self-stimulating\"\nbehavior, such as biting himself (or others) and wiping his\nnose and face so much that his nose bled and his skin chafed.\nT.H. also began to wet his pants several times a day while at\nschool.\n\n   The parents removed T.H. from school in December 2005\nfor a medical treatment. By the time he returned to school in\nJanuary 2006, the District had hired Cassandra Painter, a\nboard-certified ABA therapist, to work in the autism class-\nroom along with the lead teacher and the other aides. Painter\nimmediately made some changes in the District’s approach to\nteaching T.H., and the problematic behaviors began to sub-\nside. The lead teacher resigned in March 2006, and Painter\nbecame the lead teacher of the autism classroom.\n\n   Painter testified at the due process hearing that she believed\nT.H.’s problems during the 2005-06 school year were largely\ncaused by improper teaching techniques that had been used\nbefore she arrived. She testified that the lead teacher and the\naides \"didn’t have a very good understanding of the terminol-\nogy, of the techniques that are used in applied behavior ther-\napy.\" J.A. 364. Painter testified that when she arrived, T.H.\n\"was very aversive to the teaching situation. He would not sit\nfor more than a second or two without someone physically\nprompting him to . . . be there. He was not able to retain infor-\nmation that we had taught him.\" J.A. 366. Painter believed\nthat if proper ABA techniques had been used in the fall of\n2005, T.H. would have \"been able to sit and work. It would\nhave, should have been a situation where he was a willing\nlearner.\" J.A. 367. She testified that she spent a considerable\nportion of her time in the spring of 2006 correcting the prob-\nlems that had been caused by improper teaching techniques.\nSee J.A. 367. With Painter’s efforts, T.H. by July 2006 had\nprogressed to the point where he would sit and work with\nPainter for 20 minutes at a time.\n\f4        SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\n   In August 2006, Painter took a position with a different\nschool, and the District hired Sharon James as lead teacher for\nthe autism class. James was a certified special education\nteacher and the mother of an autistic child, but she had never\nbeen trained in ABA therapy. T.H. did not do well under\nJames. James had limited ability to control T.H.’s behavior—\nshe testified that he was out of his chair and running around\nthe classroom about 50% of the time—and T.H.’s problematic\nbehaviors (wiping his face, wetting his pants) returned.\n\n   The District hired ABS, Inc., an educational consulting\ncompany, to provide ABA training and continuing supervi-\nsion for James and the classroom aides. ABS provided a\nthree-day training seminar for James and the classroom aides\non September 13-15, 2006, more than a month after the\nschool year had begun. After the training session had been\ncompleted, an ABS consultant observing the classroom\nbelieved that James was verbally and physically abusing the\nstudents and that James was actively resistant to the ABA\napproach. The consultant reported her observations to her\nsupervisor, who in turn reported the problems to the District.\nAlthough the District investigated the matter, it could not sub-\nstantiate the allegations of abuse and did not fire James. ABS\nthen terminated its contract with the District, concluding that\nthe District had, in essence, determined that its consultant had\nlied about James.\n\n   On September 26, 2006, shortly after ABS terminated its\ncontract with the District, the parents removed T.H. from\nBates. The parents then brought in Painter, T.H.’s former\nteacher, to conduct an assessment. Painter concluded that T.H.\nhad regressed from where he had been in July, when she last\nworked with him, and she found that he had again become\naversive to teaching. For T.H.’s education the parents hired an\nexperienced ABA \"line therapist\" to provide approximately\n30 hours per week of ABA therapy to T.H. in the parents’\nhome.\n\f        SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN          5\n   The parents thereafter initiated due process proceedings,\nseeking a determination that the District was not providing\nT.H. with the \"free appropriate public education\" (\"FAPE\")\nrequired by the IDEA. After conducting an evidentiary hear-\ning, the first-line local hearing officer (\"LHO\") issued an\nopinion concluding that, in light of the District’s failure to\nprovide all of the ABA therapy required by the IEPs, the par-\nents were entitled to some level of compensatory educational\nservices from the District. The LHO, however, determined\nthat the home placement was not appropriate because it did\nnot provide the least restrictive environment for T.H.\n\n   The parents appealed to a state review officer (\"SRO\"). The\nSRO expressed some uncertainty about whether the LHO had\nactually concluded that the District denied T.H. a FAPE, but,\nafter reviewing all of the evidence, the SRO ultimately deter-\nmined that the District had not provided T.H. with a FAPE.\nAs to the appropriateness of the home placement, the SRO\nexplained that the IDEA’s least-restrictive-environment\nrequirement does not strictly apply to private placements and\nthat the overriding issue was whether the home placement\nwas \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive edu-\ncational benefits.\" J.A. 807. The SRO concluded that the\nhome placement was appropriate, given that it provided\nproper ABA therapy to T.H.; that T.H. had made educational\nprogress in the home placement; and that the parents and the\ntherapist made sure T.H. had regular opportunities to interact\nwith other children. Because it was not entirely clear whether\nthe parents were seeking reimbursement for the expenses\nassociated with the home placement or whether the approval\nof the home placement would affect the need for any compen-\nsatory educational services, the SRO remanded the case to the\nLHO for additional proceedings related to the remedy.\n\n  The District then initiated this action in federal district\ncourt challenging the SRO’s decision. The district court\nexpressed general agreement with the factual findings of the\nLHO, but determined that the LHO’s legal conclusions \"do\n\f6        SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\nnot logically flow from his factual findings, and therefore are\nnot entitled to deference.\" J.A. 39. Agreeing with the SRO’s\nanalysis, the district court concluded that the District had\ndenied T.H. a FAPE and that the home placement was appro-\npriate. This appeal followed.\n\n   In the proceedings below, the District contended that it had\nprovided T.H. with a FAPE in both the 2005-06 and the 2006-\n07 school years. On appeal, however, the District now con-\ncedes that, in light of the issues that arose after Painter\nresigned as lead teacher shortly before school started, it did\nnot provide T.H. with a FAPE for part of the 2006-07 school\nyear. The District contends, however, that by the time of the\nadministrative hearing in December 2006, it had remedied all\nof the problems in the autism classroom. The District there-\nfore concedes only that it denied T.H. a FAPE from the begin-\nning of the 2006 school year through December 6, 2006, the\ndate of the due process hearing. Accordingly, the District in\nthis appeal raises two issues related to its obligation to pro-\nvide a FAPE. It contends that the district court erred by con-\ncluding that the District failed to provide T.H. a FAPE during\nthe 2005-06 school year, and that the district court failed to\nrecognize that the District had remedied all of the problems\nby the time of the due process hearing and was at that time\ncapable of providing T.H. with a FAPE. The District also\nargues that the district court erred by concluding that T.H.’s\nhome placement was appropriate.\n\n                                II.\n\n                                A.\n\n   The District first contends that the district court erred by\nconcluding that it failed to provide T.H. with a FAPE for the\n2005-06 school year. Although the District acknowledges that\nit did not provide T.H. with all of the hours of ABA therapy\nrequired by the IEP, the District insists that it delivered signif-\nicant portions of the services required by the IEP that pro-\n\f          SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN                7\nvided some educational benefit to T.H., which is sufficient\nunder the IDEA.\n\n   The IDEA requires states receiving federal funds for educa-\ntion to provide disabled schoolchildren with a \"free appropri-\nate public education.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1412(a)(1)(A) (West\n2010). A FAPE \"consists of educational instruction specially\ndesigned to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child,\nsupported by such services as are necessary to permit the\nchild to benefit from the instruction.\" Board of Educ. v. Row-\nley, 458 U.S. 176, 188-89 (1982) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).1 Although the IDEA requires an appropriate educa-\ntion, it \"does not require a perfect education.\" M.S. ex rel.\nSimchick v. Fairfax Cnty. Sch. Bd., 553 F.3d 315, 328 (4th\nCir. 2009). Instead, \"a FAPE must be reasonably calculated to\nconfer some educational benefit on a disabled child.\" M. ex\nrel. DM v. School Dist. of Greenville Cnty., 303 F.3d 523, 526\n(4th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added).\n\n   Given the relatively limited scope of a state’s obligations\nunder the IDEA, we agree with the District that the failure to\nperfectly execute an IEP does not necessarily amount to the\ndenial of a free, appropriate public education. However, as\nother courts have recognized, the failure to implement a mate-\nrial or significant portion of the IEP can amount to a denial\nof FAPE. See Van Duyn ex rel. Van Duyn v. Baker Sch. Dist.\n5J, 502 F.3d 811, 822 (9th Cir. 2007) (\"[A] material failure\nto implement an IEP violates the IDEA.\"); Neosho R-V Sch.\nDist. v. Clark, 315 F.3d 1022, 1027 n.3 (8th Cir. 2003) (\"[W]e\ncannot conclude that an IEP is reasonably calculated to pro-\nvide a free appropriate public education if there is evidence\nthat the school actually failed to implement an essential ele-\nment of the IEP that was necessary for the child to receive an\n  1\n   The statute under consideration in Rowley was the \"Education of the\nHandicapped Act,\" see Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 179\n(1982), which was amended in 1990 and retitled as the IDEA, see Gadsby\nex rel. Gadsby v. Grasmick, 109 F.3d 940, 942 n.1 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\f8        SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\neducational benefit.\"); Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Bobby R.,\n200 F.3d 341, 349 (5th Cir. 2000) (\"[A] party challenging the\nimplementation of an IEP must show more than a de minimis\nfailure to implement all elements of that IEP, and, instead,\nmust demonstrate that the school board or other authorities\nfailed to implement substantial or significant provisions of the\nIEP.\"). Accordingly, we conclude that a material failure to\nimplement an IEP, or, put another way, a failure to implement\na material portion of an IEP, violates the IDEA.\n\n   The District contends that its failure to completely imple-\nment the 2005-06 IEP was not material because, as deter-\nmined by the LHO, T.H. in fact received some educational\nbenefit during that school year. According to the District, the\ndistrict court erred by failing to give proper deference to the\nLHO’s factual findings on this point. We disagree.\n\n   Preliminarily, we note that it is not entirely clear whether\nthe LHO concluded that the District failed to provide a FAPE\nfor the 2005-06 school year. Portions of the LHO’s opinion\nseem to indicate that it found a denial of FAPE — the LHO\nstated that the District \"den[ied] T.H. a FAPE for the approxi-\nmately 5.0 to 7.5 hours each week he was to be provided\nABA therapy and didn’t receive it in the [f]all of 2005,\" J.A.\n778, and that the District’s \"violations of T.H.’s IEPs did\ninterfere somewhat with T.H.’s access to a FAPE,\" J.A. 780.\nHowever, the LHO also stated that T.H. had made progress\nand that T.H. received more than minimal educational benefit\nduring the 2005-06 and 2006-07 school years, see J.A. 781,\nstatements that, when considered in light of the scope of a\nstate’s obligation under the IDEA, suggest the District’s fail-\nings did not deny T.H. a FAPE. See, e.g., MM ex rel. DM, 303\nF.3d at 526. There is, however, no need for us to decide\nwhether the LHO determined that the District did not deny\nT.H. a FAPE, as the District argues, or that the District did\ndeny T.H. a FAPE, as the parents argue, because the district\ncourt gave sufficient deference to the LHO’s decision.\n\f         SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN             9\n   A district court considering a challenge to a state adminis-\ntrative decision in an IDEA case makes an independent deci-\nsion based on its view of the preponderance of the evidence.\nSee 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) (West 2010). The district\ncourt must give \"due weight\" to the administrative proceed-\nings, but the findings of fact and ultimate decision as to\nwhether the state has complied with the IDEA are made by\nthe district court. Doyle v. Arlington Cnty. Sch. Bd., 953 F.2d\n100, 103 (4th Cir. 1991). \"Due weight\" means that adminis-\ntrative findings \"are entitled to be considered prima facie cor-\nrect, akin to the traditional sense of permitting a result to be\nbased on such fact-finding, but not requiring it.\" Id. at 105.\n\n   In this case, the district court explicitly recognized that the\nLHO’s factual findings were \"regularly made\" and thus did\nnot fall within the exception to the due-weight requirement\narticulated in Doyle. See id. at 104, 105 (explaining that if an\nadministrative officer departs \"so far from the accepted norm\nof a fact-finding process designed to discover truth\" — for\nexample, by rejecting credibility determinations made by the\nhearing officer — the findings cannot be considered \"regu-\nlarly made\" and those findings are entitled to no weight); see\nalso J.P. ex rel. Peterson v. County Sch. Bd. of Hanover\nCnty., Va., 516 F.3d 254, 259 (4th Cir. 2008) (\"When deter-\nmining whether a hearing officer’s findings were regularly\nmade, our cases have typically focused on the process through\nwhich the findings were made.\"). The district court acknowl-\nedged and accepted the LHO’s factual findings, but the court\nbelieved that the evidence considered as a whole pointed to a\ndifferent legal conclusion than that reached by the LHO. This\nwas entirely appropriate and consistent with the district\ncourt’s obligation to make its own independent determination\nof whether the District had provided T.H. with a FAPE.\n\n   Moreover, when arguing that the court failed to give proper\ndeference to the LHO’s findings, the District largely ignores\nthe significance of the SRO’s findings. Like the district court,\nthe SRO was obligated under the IDEA to review the record\n\f10       SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\nand make an independent decision based on his view of the\npreponderance of the evidence. The SRO weighed the evi-\ndence differently than did the LHO and drew different conclu-\nsions from the evidence, but the SRO did not improperly\nreject credibility findings made by the LHO or otherwise\ndepart from the accepted norm of fact-finding. Because the\nSRO’s findings were regularly made, they, too, were entitled\nto due weight by the district court. See Doyle, 953 F.2d at 105\n(\"When a state administrative appeals authority has departed\nfrom the fact-finding norm to such an extent as here, we think\nthe facts so found as a result of that departure are entitled to\nno weight. . . .\"); Burke County Bd. of Educ. v. Denton, 895\nF.2d 973, 981 (4th Cir. 1990) (rejecting as \"simply incorrect\"\nthe parents’ claim that \"deference was due only to the review\nofficer’s conclusion\" (emphasis added)).\n\n   The question, then, is whether the district court committed\nclear error when making its independent determination that\nthe District’s failure to implement the 2005-06 IEP consti-\ntuted a denial of FAPE. See County Sch. Bd. of Henrico Cnty.\nv. Z.P., 399 F.3d 298, 309 (4th Cir. 2005) (whether a school\nhas satisfied its obligations under the IDEA is a factual issue\nreviewed for clear error). We believe that question must be\nanswered in the negative. The evidence in the record shows\nthat the 2005-06 school year was an extraordinarily difficult\none for T.H. In the fall of 2005, he was \"very aversive to the\nteaching situation,\" would not sit still \"for more than a second\nor two,\" J.A. 366, and was engaging in harmful behaviors like\nbiting himself and wiping his face until it bled. Painter, the\nboard-certified ABA therapist who worked in the classroom\nin 2005-06, testified that T.H.’s problems were caused by the\nfailure of the lead teacher and the classroom aides to properly\nunderstand and implement ABA techniques, and that it took\nher until July 2006 to bring T.H. back to the point where he\npreviously should have and would have been if the teachers\nhad understood and properly implemented the ABA method-\nology.\n\f         SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN          11\n   While there is evidence showing that T.H. made some\ngains in certain skill areas tested in the spring of 2006, these\ngains were not so significant as to require a conclusion that\nT.H. received some non-trivial educational benefit from the\n2005-06 IEP as implemented by the District. When the evi-\ndence of T.H.’s small improvements in a few tested areas is\nconsidered against the District’s conceded failure to provide\nthe 15 hours of ABA therapy required by the IEP, the evi-\ndence that the lead teacher and aides (other than Painter) did\nnot understand or use proper ABA techniques, and the evi-\ndence that it took Painter months of working with T.H. to cor-\nrect the problems caused by the improper implementation of\nABA techniques, we cannot say that the district court erred,\nmuch less clearly erred, by concluding that the District’s fail-\nure to properly implement material portions of the IEP denied\nT.H. a FAPE for the 2005-06 school year. Cf. Hall ex rel.\nHall v. Vance Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 774 F.2d 629, 636 (4th Cir.\n1985) (\"Congress did not intend that a school system could\ndischarge its duty . . . by providing a program that produces\nsome minimal academic advancement, no matter how triv-\nial.\").\n\n                              B.\n\n   Although the District now concedes that it did not provide\na FAPE for the first part of the 2006 school year, it contends\nthat as of the date of the due process hearing (December 6,\n2006), it had remedied the problems with its autism program.\nThe District thus argues that the district court should have\nheld that the District was capable of providing a FAPE as of\nDecember 6, 2006. The District contends that such a conclu-\nsion is relevant to the determination of the scope and extent\nof the remedy to be imposed for the District’s failure to pro-\nvide a FAPE.\n\n  We agree as a general matter that post-removal changes or\nimprovements to a school’s educational program can be rele-\nvant in the remedial context, cf. M.S. ex rel. Simchick, 553\n\f12         SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\nF.3d at 325 (noting that when determining whether reimburse-\nment is appropriate, the district court may consider, among\nother things, \"the existence of other, perhaps more appropri-\nate, substitute placements\"), and we will assume that the Dis-\ntrict’s post-removal capability to properly implement an IEP\nwould be relevant to the remedial question in this case. Even\nwith that assumption, however, we cannot conclude that the\ndistrict court erred by not finding that the District was capable\nof providing a FAPE at the time of the due process hearing.\n\n   The evidence of the District’s improved capabilities was far\nfrom concrete. The evidence established that the District had\nentered into a contract with MaySouth, Inc., to provide ABA\nconsultation services, technical assistance, and training as\nneeded by the District. As of the time of the hearing, however,\na MaySouth consultant had observed the autism classroom,\nbut there had been no ABA training or supervision, nor had\nMaySouth and the District even yet settled on a schedule for\nvisits by a consultant. (A MaySouth consultant testified that\nhe expected a consultant would probably visit the school\nabout once a week, but certainly no less than once every two\nweeks.) The District had also engaged the services of Dr. Eric\nDrasko, a professor from the University of South Carolina and\nan acknowledged expert in the field, but again, the evidence\nof the services he was to provide was far from certain or specific.2\nThis evidence certainly shows that the District was taking\nseriously the need to improve its program for educating autis-\ntic students. We cannot say, however, that the District’s evi-\ndence so compellingly established the District’s capability at\nthe time of the due process hearing that the district court com-\nmitted clear error by not finding the District capable of pro-\nviding a FAPE to T.H.\n  2\n    Dr. Shawn Hagerty, the District’s special education coordinator, testi-\nfied that Drasko was \"looking at the big picture. . . . , seeing what indepen-\ndent functional skills the kids need in order to generalize, maintain, and\nto expand across all the environments,\" J.A. 646, and that Drasko was oth-\nerwise \"always available\" by email, J.A. 646, and would be available for\nmeetings once a month.\n\f          SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN                  13\n                                  III.\n\n   We turn now to the District’s challenge to the determina-\ntion that the home placement was appropriate and therefore\nwould serve as the \"stay put\" placement until the District\nestablished an adequate program.3 According to the District,\nthe home placement is not appropriate because it is too\nrestrictive and because the parents failed to present sufficient\nevidence that the home placement was reasonably calculated\nto provide an educational benefit to T.H.\n\n  The IDEA requires states seeking education funding to\nensure that\n\n      [t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with\n      disabilities, including children in public or private\n      institutions or other care facilities, are educated with\n      children who are not disabled, and special classes,\n      separate schooling, or other removal of children with\n      disabilities from the regular educational environment\n      occurs only when the nature or severity of the dis-\n      ability of a child is such that education in regular\n      classes with the use of supplementary aids and ser-\n      vices cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\n\n20 U.S.C.A. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (West 2010). The LHO applied\nthis statutory preference for \"mainstreaming\" to T.H.’s home\nplacement, concluding that the home placement was not the\n  3\n    Under the \"stay put\" provision of the IDEA, \"during the pendency of\nany proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, . . . the child shall\nremain in the then-current educational placement of the child\" absent the\nconsent of the parents and school officials. 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(j) (West\n2010). We further note that while the question of remedy is not at issue\nin this appeal, the appropriateness of a home placement also affects par-\nents’ eligibility for reimbursement of the costs associated with the home\nplacement. See M.S. ex rel. Simchick v. Fairfax Cnty. Sch. Bd., 553 F.3d\n315, 324 (4th Cir. 2009).\n\f14       SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\nleast restrictive environment and therefore was not appropri-\nate.\n\n  As the district court noted, however, this circuit has \"never\nheld that parental placements must meet the least restrictive\nenvironment requirement.\" M.S. ex rel. Simchick, 553 F.3d at\n327. As we have explained,\n\n     mainstreaming is a policy to be pursued so long as\n     it is consistent with the Act’s primary goal of provid-\n     ing disabled students with an appropriate education.\n     Where necessary for educational reasons, main-\n     streaming assumes a subordinate role in formulating\n     an educational program. In any event, the Act’s pref-\n     erence for mainstreaming was aimed at preventing\n     schools from segregating handicapped students from\n     the general student body; the school district has pre-\n     sented no evidence that the policy was meant to\n     restrict parental options when the public schools fail\n     to comply with the requirements of the Act.\n\nCarter ex rel. Carter v. Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. Four, 950\nF.2d 156, 160 (4th Cir. 1991), aff’d, 510 U.S. 7 (1993). Thus,\nwhile a parental placement is not inappropriate simply\nbecause it does not meet the least-restrictive-environment\nrequirement, it is nonetheless proper for a court to consider\nthe restrictiveness of the private placement as a factor when\ndetermining the appropriateness of the placement. See M.S. ex\nrel. Simchick, 553 F.3d at 327 (\"[T]he district court’s consid-\neration of [the private placement’s] restrictive nature was\nproper because it considered the restrictive nature only as a\nfactor in determining whether the placement was appropriate\nunder the IDEA, not as a dispositive requirement.\").\n\n   The evidence established that the parents were well aware\nof the need for T.H. to interact with non-disabled children. To\nmeet this need, the line therapist who provided ABA therapy\nto T.H. regularly took T.H. to parks and into the community\n\f         SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN            15\nfor social interactions, and T.H.’s father likewise took T.H.\ninto the community on a daily basis. The district court prop-\nerly considered this evidence and the restrictiveness of the\nhome placement as a factor, but not the dispositive factor, in\nits determination of the appropriateness of the home place-\nment.\n\n   While more detailed evidence of the nature of the commu-\nnity outings and the manner in which the parents were using\nthe outings to improve T.H.’s social skills would have been\npreferable, we cannot say that the evidence was so thin that\nthe district court clearly erred by considering it. The District’s\nclaim that the more restrictive nature of the home placement\nand its more limited opportunities for social interaction makes\nthe home placement inappropriate is in reality a complaint\nabout the weight the district court gave this factor when deter-\nmining the appropriateness of the placement. We see no basis\nin the record, however, for concluding that the district court’s\ndetermination about the relative weight to be given to this fac-\ntor amounted to clear error.\n\n   And on the broader question of whether the parents’ evi-\ndence was sufficient to support the district court’s conclusion\nthat the home placement was appropriate, we again find no\nclear error. A parental placement is appropriate if the place-\nment is \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\neducational benefits,\" M.S. ex rel. Simchick, 553 F.3d at 325\n(internal quotation marks omitted), or stated somewhat differ-\nently, if \"the private education services obtained by the par-\nents were appropriate to the child’s needs,\" A.K. ex rel. J.K.\nv. Alexandria City Sch. Bd., 484 F.3d 672, 679-80 (4th Cir.\n2007). T.H.’s mother, herself board-certified in ABA therapy,\ntestified that T.H. was receiving approximately 30 hours per\nweek of ABA services provided by an experienced ABA line\ntherapist; that the parents and the ABA therapist made sure\nT.H. had sufficient opportunities to interact with other chil-\ndren; and that T.H. was progressing both educationally and\nbehaviorally under the home program, in that he was happier,\n\f16         SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\nlearning more, and was no longer engaging in the problematic\nbehaviors like wiping his face until it bled.\n\n   The SRO, applying the correct legal standard, considered\nthe parents’ evidence and concluded that the home placement\nwas appropriate, and the district court properly gave weight\nto the SRO’s analysis.4 And after considering all of the evi-\ndence and the SRO’s views, the district court likewise deter-\nmined that the home placement was appropriate.\n\n   The parents’ evidence about the home placement was not\nvery extensive, and it was short on details and specifics.\nNonetheless, the evidence established that T.H. was receiving\nintensive ABA therapy, the kind of therapy that the District\nthrough its IEPs had concluded was necessary to provide T.H.\nwith an appropriate education, and that T.H. was responding\nwell to the program. Under these circumstances, we believe\nthe evidence was sufficient, if barely, to support the district\ncourt’s conclusion. We therefore cannot conclude that the dis-\ntrict court clearly erred by determining that the home place-\nment was reasonably calculated to enable T.H. to receive\neducational benefits.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n   Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we hereby affirm\nthe decision of the district court.\n\n                                                             AFFIRMED\n   4\n     The LHO’s conclusion that the home placement was not appropriate\nwas premised on the fact that the home placement was not the least restric-\ntive environment. As the finding was based on an incorrect understanding\nof the law, the LHO’s finding was not entitled to deference by the SRO\nor the district court. See A.K. ex rel. J.K. v. Alexandria City Sch. Bd., 484\nF.3d 672, 679-80 (4th Cir. 2007) (\"[A] finding is not entitled to deference\nto the extent that it is based upon application of an incorrect legal stan-\ndard.\").\n\f         SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN           17\nWYNN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   I agree with the majority that Sumter County School Dis-\ntrict 17 (\"the School District\") failed to provide T.H. with a\nfree appropriate public education. However, I write separately\nto dissent from the majority’s holding that there was sufficient\nevidence in the record to show that home-placement was\nappropriate. In light of this lack of evidence, I would remand\nthis matter to the district court for additional fact finding.\n\n                               I.\n\n   As the majority details, the services provided by the School\nDistrict were insufficient to provide the educational services\nneeded to comply with the Individualized Education Plans\n(\"IEPs\") developed for T.H., an autistic student. See 20\nU.S.C. § 1401(9) (indicating that, to satisfy their obligation to\nprovide a free appropriate public education, schools must pro-\nvide special education and related services \"in conformity\nwith the individualized education program\" designed for the\nstudent). Specifically, the School District’s failure to ensure\nthe effective provision of Applied Behavior Analysis\n(\"ABA\") therapy constituted a failure to implement a material\nelement of each IEP designed to guide T.H.’s education. See\nNeosho R-V Sch. Dist. v. Clark, 315 F.3d 1022, 1027 n.3 (8th\nCir. 2003) (concluding that the IDEA is violated \"if there is\nevidence that the school actually failed to implement an\nessential element of the IEP that was necessary for the child\nto receive an educational benefit\"); Houston Indep. Sch. Dist.\nv. Bobby R., 200 F.3d 341, 349 (5th Cir. 2000) (\"[T]o prevail\non a claim under the IDEA, a party challenging the imple-\nmentation of an IEP must show more than a de minimis fail-\nure to implement all elements of that IEP, and, instead, must\ndemonstrate that the school board or other authorities failed\nto implement substantial or significant provisions of the\nIEP.\"). Thus, I agree with the majority’s conclusion that the\n\f18        SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\nSchool District failed to provide T.H. with a free appropriate\npublic education.\n\n   I also agree with the majority’s analysis of the weight that\ncourts should give to the \"least-restrictive environment\nrequirement\" when considering the appropriateness of home-\nplacement. Though failure to meet this requirement might\nestablish a school district’s failure to comply with the IDEA,\nsee 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A), this \"requirement\" must logi-\ncally be relaxed when considering the appropriateness of an\neducational program designed for implementation in the rela-\ntive isolation of a child’s home. However, as the majority rec-\nognizes, whether the private placement adheres to this relaxed\nconception of the restrictiveness requirement is still a factor\nto be considered when assessing the overall appropriateness\nof private placement.\n\n   Still, notwithstanding my substantial agreement with por-\ntions of the majority opinion, I cannot agree with the majority\nthat the home-placement program in place to educate T.H. is\n\"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educa-\ntional benefits.\" See M.S. ex rel. Simchick v. Fairfax Cnty.\nSch. Bd., 553 F.3d 315, 324 (4th Cir. 2009); Carter v. Flor-\nence Cnty. Sch. Dist.

HEFFERNAN          19\nBd. of Educ. of Hyde Park, 459 F.3d 356, 364 (2d Cir. 2006).\nAs such, we must determine whether the proposed placement\nprovides \"educational instruction specially designed to meet\nthe unique needs of a handicapped child, supported by such\nservices as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from\ninstruction.\" Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 188-89\n(1982)(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   Here, the only evidence provided as to the design of the\neducational program provided for T.H. at home was the testi-\nmony of his mother, May Baird. Baird testified that she had\nhired Laura Walkup, \"a young woman who has experience\nworking in an ABA program,\" to work with T.H. during the\nschool week. When pressed on cross-examination, she admit-\nted that she was unsure how many hours Walkup worked with\nT.H. during a given week, stating that her husband \"would be\na better one to answer that.\" Indeed, Baird indicated through-\nout her testimony that she was \"not the best one to answer\"\nquestions regarding the details of the services provided to\nT.H. because she is \"often not home.\" However, Baird was\nable to approximate that Walkup worked with T.H. for \"20 to\n30 hours\" per week.\n\n   Notably, Baird failed to elaborate on the details of the edu-\ncational services provided by Walkup. Problematically, she\nmade no mention of the goals of the therapy, indicating\nmerely that Walkup was \"working on specific objectives.\"\nThis lack of specificity stands in stark contrast to the IEPs\ndeveloped for T.H., which include pages of detailed educa-\ntional objectives related to, inter alia, his \"socialization\nskills,\" \"classroom work skills,\" \"general knowledge and\ncomprehension skills,\" \"daily living skills,\" and \"functional\ncommunication skills.\" Moreover, Baird provided no testi-\nmony regarding how the program was designed to measure\nprogress toward the unidentified \"specific objectives,\" or how\nmuch progress was required to demonstrate accomplishment\nof said objectives. In short, given that the Court is asked to\nconsider whether the program designed for T.H. would meet\n\f20        SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN\nhis \"unique needs,\" without more clarification of the contents\nof the program, I cannot answer that question affirmatively.\n\n   In addition, Baird made no mention of the services other\nthan ABA therapy, if any, that were provided for T.H. at home.2\nAs noted by the School District, there was \"no evidence that\nspeech-language therapy or occupational therapy, two related\nservices included in the school IEP as supportive services . . .\nwere provided in the home program.\" Brief of Appellant at\n47. To be sure, given T.H.’s autism, properly administered\nABA therapy was a necessary component of any plan reason-\nably calculated to confer on him an educational benefit. But\nthe ill-defined nature of that therapy counsels us to remand\nthis matter to the district court for the fact-finding necessary\nto determine whether its provision was sufficient to demon-\nstrate the appropriateness of home-placement.\n\n   That said, the evidence concerning therapy was not the only\nevidence offered concerning the program in place to educate\nT.H. at home. Baird also testified about opportunities pro-\nvided for T.H. to socialize. Presumably, this testimony was\ngiven in an attempt to demonstrate compliance with the least-\nrestrictive-environment requirement. But, even under an\nappropriately relaxed restrictiveness inquiry, there was insuf-\nficient evidence to demonstrate that the home-placement pro-\ngram would provide T.H. with adequate opportunities to\ninteract with children who are not disabled. This point is\nacknowledged, in part, by the majority opinion which states\nthat \"more detailed evidence of the nature of the community\noutings and the manner in which the parents were using the\noutings to improve T.H.’s social skills would have been pref-\nerable.\"\n  2\n   As noted by the District, there was \"no evidence that speech-language\ntherapy or occupational therapy, two related services included in the\nschool IEP as supportive services . . . were provided in the home pro-\ngram.\" Brief of Appellant at 47.\n\f          SUMTER COUNTY SCHOOL DIST. 17 v. HEFFERNAN                     21\n   Indeed, scant evidence was provided regarding opportuni-\nties for T.H. to interact with non-disabled children. Baird tes-\ntified that the therapist hired to work with T.H. \"fairly\nregularly\" took him \"for social opportunities on playgrounds\nand stuff around locally.\" She also indicated that T.H.’s father\ntook the child into the community \"on a daily basis.\" How-\never, Baird, who was not present during these outings, was\nunable to testify as to their duration. Also, her testimony is\nunclear regarding the frequency with which T.H. interacted\nwith non-disabled children during these trips into the commu-\nnity.3 If undefined periods of socialization with other children,\nregardless of whether or not they are disabled, are sufficient\nto satisfy the \"least-restrictive-environment requirement,\" that\nrequirement is rendered a nullity.\n\n   In sum, where there was insufficient evidence as to how the\nplan designed to educate a child at home is calculated to actu-\nally provide an educational benefit, it was error for the district\ncourt to say that the \"calculation\" was reasonable. Accord-\ningly, this matter should be remanded so that the district court\ncan further examine the contents and structure of the plan pro-\nposed during home-placement. Without more evidence\nexplaining the contents of the plan, a conclusion regarding its\nadequacy cannot be drawn absent considerable speculation.\n\n\n\n\n  3\n    Baird was asked if T.H. had \"an opportunity to relate to . . . typically\ndeveloping peers, other peers, or other opportunities for social interac-\ntion.\" She replied, \"He does out in the community, yes, and with, with\nfriends, family members of friends.\" Baird did not clarify whether, in\nmentioning these friends or their family members, she was identifying\n\"typically developing peers\" or instead \"other peers.\" Similarly, when\nasked on cross-examination about T.H.’s social interactions with \"typi-\ncally developing peers,\" Baird mentioned \"family friends that have chil-\ndren that are [T.H.’s] age that he can interact with,\" but did not discuss\nhow often those children were available to interact with T.H.\n\f",

Chief Judge TRAXLER wrote the majority opinion, in which Senior Judge FABER joined. Judge WYNN wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>TRAXLER, Chief Judge:</p>\n<p>In this action under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (the \"IDEA\"), Sumter County School District # 17 (the \"District\") appeals from the district court's order finding that the District had failed to provide a free and appropriate public education to T.H. and that the program established by T.H.'s parents to educate him at home was appropriate. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>T.H. falls on the moderate-to-severe end of the autism spectrum. He is functionally non-verbal, in that he does not often use language spontaneously, and he is very sensitive to noise. When this action was commenced, T.H. attended Bates Middle School in Sumter County, South Carolina. His individual education plan (\"IEP\") for the 2005-06 school year called for 15 hours per week of applied behavioral analysis (\"ABA\") therapy; the IEP for the 2006-07 school year called for 27.5 hours per week of ABA therapy.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2005, the District was providing T.H. with approximately 7.5-10 hours per week of ABA therapy instead of the 15 hours required by the IEP. T.H. did not do well that fall, and he began exhibiting problematic \"self-stimulating\" behavior, such as biting himself (or others) and wiping his nose and face so much that his nose bled and his skin chafed. T.H. also began to wet his pants several times a day while at school.</p>\n<p>The parents removed T.H. from school in December 2005 for a medical treatment. By the time he returned to school in January 2006, the District had hired Cassandra Painter, a board-certified ABA therapist, to work in the autism classroom along with the lead teacher and the other aides. Painter immediately made some changes in the District's approach to teaching T.H., and the problematic behaviors began to subside. The lead teacher resigned in March 2006, and Painter became the lead teacher of the autism classroom.</p>\n<p>Painter testified at the due process hearing that she believed T.H.'s problems during the 2005-06 school year were largely caused by improper teaching techniques that had been used before she arrived. She testified that the lead teacher and the aides \"didn't have a very good understanding of the terminology, of the techniques that are used in applied behavior therapy.\" J.A. 364. Painter testified that when she arrived, T.H. \"was very aversive to the teaching situation. He would not sit for more than a second or two without someone physically prompting him to ... be there. He was not able to retain information that we had taught him.\" J.A. 366. Painter believed that if proper ABA techniques had been used in the fall of 2005, T.H. would have \"been able to sit and work. It would have, should have been a situation where he was a willing learner.\" J.A. 367. She testified that she spent a considerable portion of her time in the spring of 2006 correcting the problems that had been caused by improper teaching techniques. <i>See</i> J.A. 367. With Painter's efforts, T.H. by July 2006 had progressed to the point where he would sit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*482</span> and work with Painter for 20 minutes at a time.</p>\n<p>In August 2006, Painter took a position with a different school, and the District hired Sharon James as lead teacher for the autism class. James was a certified special education teacher and the mother of an autistic child, but she had never been trained in ABA therapy. T.H. did not do well under James. James had limited ability to control T.H.'s behaviorshe testified that he was out of his chair and running around the classroom about 50% of the timeand T.H.'s problematic behaviors (wiping his face, wetting his pants) returned.</p>\n<p>The District hired ABS, Inc., an educational consulting company, to provide ABA training and continuing supervision for James and the classroom aides. ABS provided a three-day training seminar for James and the classroom aides on September 13-15, 2006, more than a month after the school year had begun. After the training session had been completed, an ABS consultant observing the classroom believed that James was verbally and physically abusing the students and that James was actively resistant to the ABA approach. The consultant reported her observations to her supervisor, who in turn reported the problems to the District. Although the District investigated the matter, it could not substantiate the allegations of abuse and did not fire James. ABS then terminated its contract with the District, concluding that the District had, in essence, determined that its consultant had lied about James.</p>\n<p>On September 26, 2006, shortly after ABS terminated its contract with the District, the parents removed T.H. from Bates. The parents then brought in Painter, T.H.'s former teacher, to conduct an assessment. Painter concluded that T.H. had regressed from where he had been in July, when she last worked with him, and she found that he had again become aversive to teaching. For T.H.'s education the parents hired an experienced ABA \"line therapist\" to provide approximately 30 hours per week of ABA therapy to T.H. in the parents' home.</p>\n<p>The parents thereafter initiated due process proceedings, seeking a determination that the District was not providing T.H. with the \"free appropriate public education\" (\"FAPE\") required by the IDEA. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the first-line local hearing officer (\"LHO\") issued an opinion concluding that, in light of the District's failure to provide all of the ABA therapy required by the IEPs, the parents were entitled to some level of compensatory educational services from the District. The LHO, however, determined that the home placement was not appropriate because it did not provide the least restrictive environment for T.H.</p>\n<p>The parents appealed to a state review officer (\"SRO\"). The SRO expressed some uncertainty about whether the LHO had actually concluded that the District denied T.H. a FAPE, but, after reviewing all of the evidence, the SRO ultimately determined that the District had not provided T.H. with a FAPE. As to the appropriateness of the home placement, the SRO explained that the IDEA's least-restrictive-environment requirement does not strictly apply to private placements and that the overriding issue was whether the home placement was \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\" J.A. 807. The SRO concluded that the home placement was appropriate, given that it provided proper ABA therapy to T.H.; that T.H. had made educational progress in the home placement; and that the parents and the therapist made sure T.H. had regular opportunities to interact with other children. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*483</span> Because it was not entirely clear whether the parents were seeking reimbursement for the expenses associated with the home placement or whether the approval of the home placement would affect the need for any compensatory educational services, the SRO remanded the case to the LHO for additional proceedings related to the remedy.</p>\n<p>The District then initiated this action in federal district court challenging the SRO's decision. The district court expressed general agreement with the factual findings of the LHO, but determined that the LHO's legal conclusions \"do not logically flow from his factual findings, and therefore are not entitled to deference.\" J.A. 39. Agreeing with the SRO's analysis, the district court concluded that the District had denied T.H. a FAPE and that the home placement was appropriate. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>In the proceedings below, the District contended that it had provided T.H. with a FAPE in both the 2005-06 and the 2006-07 school years. On appeal, however, the District now concedes that, in light of the issues that arose after Painter resigned as lead teacher shortly before school started, it <i>did not</i> provide T.H. with a FAPE for part of the 2006-07 school year. The District contends, however, that by the time of the administrative hearing in December 2006, it had remedied all of the problems in the autism classroom. The District therefore concedes only that it denied T.H. a FAPE from the beginning of the 2006 school year through December 6, 2006, the date of the due process hearing. Accordingly, the District in this appeal raises two issues related to its obligation to provide a FAPE. It contends that the district court erred by concluding that the District failed to provide T.H. a FAPE during the 2005-06 school year, and that the district court failed to recognize that the District had remedied all of the problems by the time of the due process hearing and was at that time capable of providing T.H. with a FAPE. The District also argues that the district court erred by concluding that T.H.'s home placement was appropriate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>The District first contends that the district court erred by concluding that it failed to provide T.H. with a FAPE for the 2005-06 school year. Although the District acknowledges that it did not provide T.H. with all of the hours of ABA therapy required by the IEP, the District insists that it delivered significant portions of the services required by the IEP that provided some educational benefit to T.H., which is sufficient under the IDEA.</p>\n<p>The IDEA requires states receiving federal funds for education to provide disabled schoolchildren with a \"free appropriate public education.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1412(a)(1)(A) (West 2010). A FAPE \"consists of educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child, supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from the instruction.\" <i>Board of Educ. v. Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. 176, 188-89, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).<sup>[1]</sup> Although the IDEA requires an appropriate education, it \"does not require a perfect education.\" <i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick v. Fairfax Cnty. Sch. Bd.,</i> 553 F.3d 315, 328 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*484</span> (4th Cir.2009). Instead, \"a FAPE must be reasonably calculated to confer <i>some educational benefit</i> on a disabled child.\" <i>MM, ex rel. DM v. School Dist. of Greenville Cnty.,</i> 303 F.3d 523, 526 (4th Cir.2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Given the relatively limited scope of a state's obligations under the IDEA, we agree with the District that the failure to perfectly execute an IEP does not necessarily amount to the denial of a free, appropriate public education. However, as other courts have recognized, the failure to implement a material or significant portion of the IEP can amount to a denial of FAPE. <i>See </i><i>Van Duyn ex rel. Van Duyn v. Baker Sch. Dist. 5J,</i> 502 F.3d 811, 822 (9th Cir.2007) (\"[A] <i>material</i> failure to implement an IEP violates the IDEA.\"); <i>Neosho R-V Sch. Dist. v. Clark,</i> 315 F.3d 1022, 1027 n. 3 (8th Cir.2003) (\"[W]e cannot conclude that an IEP is reasonably calculated to provide a free appropriate public education if there is evidence that the school actually failed to implement an essential element of the IEP that was necessary for the child to receive an educational benefit.\"); <i>Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Bobby R.,</i> 200 F.3d 341, 349 (5th Cir.2000) (\"[A] party challenging the implementation of an IEP must show more than a <i>de minimis</i> failure to implement all elements of that IEP, and, instead, must demonstrate that the school board or other authorities failed to implement substantial or significant provisions of the IEP.\"). Accordingly, we conclude that a material failure to implement an IEP, or, put another way, a failure to implement a material portion of an IEP, violates the IDEA.</p>\n<p>The District contends that its failure to completely implement the 2005-06 IEP was not material because, as determined by the LHO, T.H. in fact received some educational benefit during that school year. According to the District, the district court erred by failing to give proper deference to the LHO's factual findings on this point. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Preliminarily, we note that it is not entirely clear whether the LHO concluded that the District failed to provide a FAPE for the 2005-06 school year. Portions of the LHO's opinion seem to indicate that it found a denial of FAPEthe LHO stated that the District \"den[ied] T.H. a FAPE for the approximately 5.0 to 7.5 hours each week he was to be provided ABA therapy and didn't receive it in the [f]all of 2005,\" J.A. 778, and that the District's \"violations of T.H.'s IEPs did interfere somewhat with T.H.'s access to a FAPE,\" J.A. 780. However, the LHO also stated that T.H. had made progress and that T.H. received more than minimal educational benefit during the 2005-06 and 2006-07 school years, <i>see</i> J.A. 781, statements that, when considered in light of the scope of a state's obligation under the IDEA, suggest the District's failings did <i>not</i> deny T.H. a FAPE. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>MM ex rel. DM,</i> 303 F.3d at 526. There is, however, no need for us to decide whether the LHO determined that the District did not deny T.H. a FAPE, as the District argues, or that the District did deny T.H. a FAPE, as the parents argue, because the district court gave sufficient deference to the LHO's decision.</p>\n<p>A district court considering a challenge to a state administrative decision in an IDEA case makes an independent decision based on its view of the preponderance of the evidence. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) (West 2010). The district court must give \"due weight\" to the administrative proceedings, but the findings of fact and ultimate decision as to whether the state has complied with the IDEA are made by the district court. <i>Doyle v. Arlington Cnty. Sch. Bd.,</i> 953 F.2d 100, 103 (4th Cir.1991). \"Due <span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> weight\" means that administrative findings \"are entitled to be considered <i>prima facie</i> correct, akin to the traditional sense of permitting a result to be based on such fact-finding, but not requiring it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 105.</p>\n<p>In this case, the district court explicitly recognized that the LHO's factual findings were \"regularly made\" and thus did not fall within the exception to the due weight requirement articulated in <i>Doyle. See id.</i> at 104, 105 (explaining that if an administrative officer departs \"so far from the accepted norm of a fact-finding process designed to discover truth\"for example, by rejecting credibility determinations made by the hearing officerthe findings cannot be considered \"regularly made\" and those findings are entitled to no weight); <i>see also </i><i>J.P. ex rel. Peterson v. County Sch. Bd. of Hanover Cnty., Va.,</i> 516 F.3d 254, 259 (4th Cir.2008) (\"When determining whether a hearing officer's findings were regularly made, our cases have typically focused on the <i>process</i> through which the findings were made.\"). The district court acknowledged and accepted the LHO's factual findings, but the court believed that the evidence considered as a whole pointed to a different legal conclusion than that reached by the LHO. This was entirely appropriate and consistent with the district court's obligation to make its own independent determination of whether the District had provided T.H. with a FAPE.</p>\n<p>Moreover, when arguing that the court failed to give proper deference to the LHO's findings, the District largely ignores the significance of the SRO's findings. Like the district court, the SRO was obligated under the IDEA to review the record and make an independent decision based on his view of the preponderance of the evidence. The SRO weighed the evidence differently than did the LHO and drew different conclusions from the evidence, but the SRO did not improperly reject credibility findings made by the LHO or otherwise depart from the accepted norm of fact-finding. Because the SRO's findings were regularly made, they, too, were entitled to due weight by the district court. <i>See </i><i>Doyle,</i> 953 F.2d at 105 (\"When a state administrative appeals authority has departed from the fact-finding norm to such an extent as here, we think the facts so found as a result of that departure are entitled to no weight....\"); <i>Burke County Bd. of Educ. v. Denton,</i> 895 F.2d 973, 981 (4th Cir.1990) (rejecting as \"simply incorrect\" the parents' claim that \"deference was due <i>only</i> to the review officer's conclusion\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>The question, then, is whether the district court committed clear error when making its independent determination that the District's failure to implement the 2005-06 IEP constituted a denial of FAPE. <i>See </i><i>County Sch. Bd. of Henrico Cnty. v. Z.P.,</i> 399 F.3d 298, 309 (4th Cir. 2005) (whether a school has satisfied its obligations under the IDEA is a factual issue reviewed for clear error). We believe that question must be answered in the negative. The evidence in the record shows that the 2005-06 school year was an extraordinarily difficult one for T.H. In the fall of 2005, he was \"very aversive to the teaching situation,\" would not sit still \"for more than a second or two,\" J.A. 366, and was engaging in harmful behaviors like biting himself and wiping his face until it bled. Painter, the board-certified ABA therapist who worked in the classroom in 2005-06, testified that T.H.'s problems were caused by the failure of the lead teacher and the classroom aides to properly understand and implement ABA techniques, and that it took her until July 2006 to bring T.H. back to the point where he previously should have and would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> been if the teachers had understood and properly implemented the ABA methodology.</p>\n<p>While there is evidence showing that T.H. made some gains in certain skill areas tested in the spring of 2006, these gains were not so significant as to <i>require</i> a conclusion that T.H. received some non-trivial educational benefit from the 2005-06 IEP as implemented by the District. When the evidence of T.H.'s small improvements in a few tested areas is considered against the District's conceded failure to provide the 15 hours of ABA therapy required by the IEP, the evidence that the lead teacher and aides (other than Painter) did not understand or use proper ABA techniques, and the evidence that it took Painter months of working with T.H. to correct the problems caused by the improper implementation of ABA techniques, we cannot say that the district court erred, much less clearly erred, by concluding that the District's failure to properly implement material portions of the IEP denied T.H. a FAPE for the 2005-06 school year. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hall ex rel. Hall v. Vance Cnty. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 774 F.2d 629, 636 (4th Cir.1985) (\"Congress did not intend that a school system could discharge its duty ... by providing a program that produces some minimal academic advancement, no matter how trivial.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Although the District now concedes that it did not provide a FAPE for the first part of the 2006 school year, it contends that as of the date of the due process hearing (December 6, 2006), it had remedied the problems with its autism program. The District thus argues that the district court should have held that the District was <i>capable</i> of providing a FAPE as of December 6, 2006. The District contends that such a conclusion is relevant to the determination of the scope and extent of the remedy to be imposed for the District's failure to provide a FAPE.</p>\n<p>We agree as a general matter that post-removal changes or improvements to a school's educational program can be relevant in the remedial context, <i>cf. </i><i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick,</i> 553 F.3d at 325 (noting that when determining whether reimbursement is appropriate, the district court may consider, among other things, \"the existence of other, perhaps more appropriate, substitute placements\"), and we will assume that the District's post-removal capability to properly implement an IEP would be relevant to the remedial question in this case. Even with that assumption, however, we cannot conclude that the district court erred by not finding that the District was capable of providing a FAPE at the time of the due process hearing.</p>\n<p>The evidence of the District's improved capabilities was far from concrete. The evidence established that the District had entered into a contract with MaySouth, Inc., to provide ABA consultation services, technical assistance, and training as needed by the District. As of the time of the hearing, however, a MaySouth consultant had observed the autism classroom, but there had been no ABA training or supervision, nor had MaySouth and the District even yet settled on a schedule for visits by a consultant. (A MaySouth consultant testified that he expected a consultant would probably visit the school about once a week, but certainly no less than once every two weeks.) The District had also engaged the services of Dr. Eric Drasko, a professor from the University of South Carolina and an acknowledged expert in the field, but again, the evidence of the services he was to provide was far <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> from certain or specific.<sup>[2]</sup> This evidence certainly shows that the District was taking seriously the need to improve its program for educating autistic students. We cannot say, however, that the District's evidence so compellingly established the District's capability at the time of the due process hearing that the district court committed clear error by not finding the District capable of providing a FAPE to T.H.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We turn now to the District's challenge to the determination that the home placement was appropriate and therefore would serve as the \"stay put\" placement until the District established an adequate program.<sup>[3]</sup> According to the District, the home placement is not appropriate because it is too restrictive and because the parents failed to present sufficient evidence that the home placement was reasonably calculated to provide an educational benefit to T.H.</p>\n<p>The IDEA requires states seeking education funding to ensure that</p>\n<blockquote>[t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.</blockquote>\n<p>20 U.S.C.A. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (West 2010). The LHO applied this statutory preference for \"mainstreaming\" to T.H.'s home placement, concluding that the home placement was not the least restrictive environment and therefore was not appropriate.</p>\n<p>As the district court noted, however, this circuit has \"never held that parental placements must meet the least restrictive environment requirement.\" <i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick,</i> 553 F.3d at 327. As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote>mainstreaming is a policy to be pursued so long as it is consistent with the Act's primary goal of providing disabled students with an appropriate education. Where necessary for educational reasons, mainstreaming assumes a subordinate role in formulating an educational program. In any event, the Act's preference for mainstreaming was aimed at preventing schools from segregating handicapped students from the general student body; the school district has presented no evidence that the policy was meant to restrict parental options when the public schools fail to comply with the requirements of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Carter ex rel. Carter v. Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. Four,</i> 950 F.2d 156, 160 (4th Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> 1991), <i>aff'd,</i> 510 U.S. 7, 114 S.Ct. 361, 126 L.Ed.2d 284 (1993). Thus, while a parental placement is not inappropriate simply because it does not meet the least-restrictive-environment requirement, it is nonetheless proper for a court to consider the restrictiveness of the private placement <i>as a factor</i> when determining the appropriateness of the placement. <i>See </i><i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick,</i> 553 F.3d at 327 (\"[T]he district court's consideration of [the private placement's] restrictive nature was proper because it considered the restrictive nature only as a factor in determining whether the placement was appropriate under the IDEA, not as a dispositive requirement.\").</p>\n<p>The evidence established that the parents were well aware of the need for T.H. to interact with non-disabled children. To meet this need, the line therapist who provided ABA therapy to T.H. regularly took T.H. to parks and into the community for social interactions, and T.H.'s father likewise took T.H. into the community on a daily basis. The district court properly considered this evidence and the restrictiveness of the home placement as a factor, but not the dispositive factor, in its determination of the appropriateness of the home placement.</p>\n<p>While more detailed evidence of the nature of the community outings and the manner in which the parents were using the outings to improve T.H.'s social skills would have been preferable, we cannot say that the evidence was so thin that the district court clearly erred by considering it. The District's claim that the more restrictive nature of the home placement and its more limited opportunities for social interaction makes the home placement inappropriate is in reality a complaint about the weight the district court gave this factor when determining the appropriateness of the placement. We see no basis in the record, however, for concluding that the district court's determination about the relative weight to be given to this factor amounted to clear error.</p>\n<p>And on the broader question of whether the parents' evidence was sufficient to support the district court's conclusion that the home placement was appropriate, we again find no clear error. A parental placement is appropriate if the placement is \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,\" <i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick,</i> 553 F.3d at 325 (internal quotation marks omitted), or stated somewhat differently, if \"the private education services obtained by the parents were appropriate to the child's needs,\" <i>A.K. ex rel. J.K. v. Alexandria City Sch. Bd.,</i> 484 F.3d 672, 679-80 (4th Cir.2007). T.H.'s mother, herself board-certified in ABA therapy, testified that T.H. was receiving approximately 30 hours per week of ABA services provided by an experienced ABA line therapist; that the parents and the ABA therapist made sure T.H. had sufficient opportunities to interact with other children; and that T.H. was progressing both educationally and behaviorally under the home program, in that he was happier, learning more, and was no longer engaging in the problematic behaviors like wiping his face until it bled.</p>\n<p>The SRO, applying the correct legal standard, considered the parents' evidence and concluded that the home placement was appropriate, and the district court properly gave weight to the SRO's analysis.<sup>[4]</sup> And after considering all of the evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> and the SRO's views, the district court likewise determined that the home placement was appropriate.</p>\n<p>The parents' evidence about the home placement was not very extensive, and it was short on details and specifics. Nonetheless, the evidence established that T.H. was receiving intensive ABA therapy, the kind of therapy that the District through its IEPs had concluded was necessary to provide T.H. with an appropriate education, and that T.H. was responding well to the program. Under these circumstances, we believe the evidence was sufficient, if barely, to support the district court's conclusion. We therefore cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred by determining that the home placement was reasonably calculated to enable T.H. to receive educational benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we hereby affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED</i></p>\n<p>WYNN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority that Sumter County School District 17 (\"the School District\") failed to provide T.H. with a free appropriate public education. However, I write separately to dissent from the majority's holding that there was sufficient evidence in the record to show that homeplacement was appropriate. In light of this lack of evidence, I would remand this matter to the district court for additional fact finding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>As the majority details, the services provided by the School District were insufficient to provide the educational services needed to comply with the Individualized Education Plans (\"IEPs\") developed for T.H., an autistic student. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9) (indicating that, to satisfy their obligation to provide a free appropriate public education, schools must provide special education and related services \"in conformity with the individualized education program\" designed for the student). Specifically, the School District's failure to ensure the effective provision of Applied Behavior Analysis (\"ABA\") therapy constituted a failure to implement a material element of each IEP designed to guide T.H.'s education. <i>See </i><i>Neosho R-V Sch. Dist. v. Clark,</i> 315 F.3d 1022, 1027 n. 3 (8th Cir.2003) (concluding that the IDEA is violated \"if there is evidence that the school actually failed to implement an essential element of the IEP that was necessary for the child to receive an educational benefit\"); <i>Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Bobby R.,</i> 200 F.3d 341, 349 (5th Cir.2000) (\"[T]o prevail on a claim under the IDEA, a party challenging the implementation of an IEP must show more than a <i>de minimis</i> failure to implement all elements of that IEP, and, instead, must demonstrate that the school board or other authorities failed to implement substantial or significant provisions of the IEP.\"). Thus, I agree with the majority's conclusion that the School District failed to provide T.H. with a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p>I also agree with the majority's analysis of the weight that courts should give to the \"least-restrictive environment requirement\" when considering the appropriateness of home-placement. Though failure to meet this requirement might establish a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> school district's failure to comply with the IDEA, <i>see</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A), this \"requirement\" must logically be relaxed when considering the appropriateness of an educational program designed for implementation in the relative isolation of a child's home. However, as the majority recognizes, whether the private placement adheres to this relaxed conception of the restrictiveness requirement is still a factor to be considered when assessing the overall appropriateness of private placement.</p>\n<p>Still, notwithstanding my substantial agreement with portions of the majority opinion, I cannot agree with the majority that the home-placement program in place to educate T.H. is \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\" <i>See </i><i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick v. Fairfax Cnty. Sch. Bd.,</i> 553 F.3d 315, 324 (4th Cir.2009); <i>Carter v. Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. Four,</i> 950 F.2d 156, 163 (4th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>When assessing the appropriateness of private placement, subject to limited exceptions,<sup>[1]</sup> we should consider \"the same considerations and criteria that apply in determining whether the School District's placement is appropriate[.]\" <i>Frank G. v. Bd. of Educ. of Hyde Park,</i> 459 F.3d 356, 364 (2d Cir.2006). As such, we must determine whether the proposed placement provides \"educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of a handicapped child, supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from instruction.\" <i>Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. 176, 188-89, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982)(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the only evidence provided as to the design of the educational program provided for T.H. at home was the testimony of his mother, May Baird. Baird testified that she had hired Laura Walkup, \"a young woman who has experience working in an ABA program,\" to work with T.H. during the school week. When pressed on cross-examination, she admitted that she was unsure how many hours Walkup worked with T.H. during a given week, stating that her husband \"would be a better one to answer that.\" Indeed, Baird indicated throughout her testimony that she was \"not the best one to answer\" questions regarding the details of the services provided to T.H. because she is \"often not home.\" However, Baird was able to approximate that Walkup worked with T.H. for \"20 to 30 hours\" per week.</p>\n<p>Notably, Baird failed to elaborate on the details of the educational services provided by Walkup. Problematically, she made no mention of the goals of the therapy, indicating merely that Walkup was \"working on specific objectives.\" This lack of specificity stands in stark contrast to the IEPs developed for T.H., which include pages of detailed educational objectives related to, <i>inter alia,</i> his \"socialization skills,\" \"classroom work skills,\" \"general knowledge and comprehension skills,\" \"daily living skills,\" and \"functional communication skills.\" Moreover, Baird provided no testimony regarding how the program was designed to measure progress toward the unidentified \"specific objectives,\" or how much progress was required to demonstrate accomplishment of said objectives. In short, given <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> that the Court is asked to consider whether the program designed for T.H. would meet his \"unique needs,\" without more clarification of the contents of the program, I cannot answer that question affirmatively.</p>\n<p>In addition, Baird made no mention of the services other than ABA therapy, if any, that were provided for T.H. at home.<sup>[2]</sup> As noted by the School District, there was \"no evidence that speech-language therapy or occupational therapy, two related services included in the school IEP as supportive services ... were provided in the home program.\" Brief of Appellant at 47. To be sure, given T.H.'s autism, properly administered ABA therapy was a necessary component of any plan reasonably calculated to confer on him an educational benefit. But the ill-defined nature of that therapy counsels us to remand this matter to the district court for the fact-finding necessary to determine whether its provision was sufficient to demonstrate the appropriateness of home-placement.</p>\n<p>That said, the evidence concerning therapy was not the only evidence offered concerning the program in place to educate T.H. at home. Baird also testified about opportunities provided for T.H. to socialize. Presumably, this testimony was given in an attempt to demonstrate compliance with the least-restrictive-environment requirement. But, even under an appropriately relaxed restrictiveness inquiry, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the home-placement program would provide T.H. with adequate opportunities to interact with children who are not disabled. This point is acknowledged, in part, by the majority opinion which states that \"more detailed evidence of the nature of the community outings and the manner in which the parents were using the outings to improve T.H.'s social skills would have been preferable.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, scant evidence was provided regarding opportunities for T.H. to interact with non-disabled children. Baird testified that the therapist hired to work with T.H. \"fairly regularly\" took him \"for social opportunities on playgrounds and stuff around locally.\" She also indicated that T.H.'s father took the child into the community \"on a daily basis.\" However, Baird, who was not present during these outings, was unable to testify as to their duration. Also, her testimony is unclear regarding the frequency with which T.H. interacted with <i>non-disabled</i> children during these trips into the community.<sup>[3]</sup> If undefined periods of socialization with other children, regardless of whether or not they are disabled, are sufficient to satisfy the \"least-restrictive-environment requirement,\" that requirement is rendered a nullity.</p>\n<p>In sum, where there was insufficient evidence as to how the plan designed to educate a child at home is calculated to actually provide an educational benefit, it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> was error for the district court to say that the \"calculation\" was reasonable. Accordingly, this matter should be remanded so that the district court can further examine the contents and structure of the plan proposed during home-placement. Without more evidence explaining the contents of the plan, a conclusion regarding its adequacy cannot be drawn absent considerable speculation.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The statute under consideration in <i>Rowley</i> was the \"Education of the Handicapped Act,\" <i>see </i><i>Board of Educ. v.

We further note that while the question of remedy is not at issue in this appeal, the appropriateness of a home placement also affects parents' eligibility for reimbursement of the costs associated with the home placement. <i>See </i><i>M.S. ex rel.

Bd.,</i> 553 F.3d 315, 324 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[4]  The LHO's conclusion that the home placement was not appropriate was premised on the fact that the home placement was not the least restrictive environment. As the finding was based on an incorrect understanding of the law, the LHO's finding was not entitled to deference by the SRO or the district court. <i>See </i><i>A.K. ex rel. J.K. v.

Chief Judge TRAXLER wrote the majority opinion, in which Senior Judge FABER joined. Judge WYNN wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>TRAXLER, Chief Judge:</p>\n<p>In this action under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (the \"IDEA\"), Sumter County School District # 17 (the \"District\") appeals from the district court's order finding that the District had failed to provide a free and appropriate public education to T.H. and that the program established by T.H.'s parents to educate him at home was appropriate. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>T.H. falls on the moderate-to-severe end of the autism spectrum. He is functionally non-verbal, in that he does not often use language spontaneously, and he is very sensitive to noise. When this action was commenced, T.H. attended Bates Middle School in Sumter County, South Carolina. His individual education plan (\"IEP\") for the 2005-06 school year called for 15 hours per week of applied behavioral analysis (\"ABA\") therapy; the IEP for the 2006-07 school year called for 27.5 hours per week of ABA therapy.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2005, the District was providing T.H. with approximately 7.5-10 hours per week of ABA therapy instead of the 15 hours required by the IEP. T.H. did not do well that fall, and he began exhibiting problematic \"self-stimulating\" behavior, such as biting himself (or others) and wiping his nose and face so much that his nose bled and his skin chafed. T.H. also began to wet his pants several times a day while at school.</p>\n<p>The parents removed T.H. from school in December 2005 for a medical treatment. By the time he returned to school in January 2006, the District had hired Cassandra Painter, a board-certified ABA therapist, to work in the autism classroom along with the lead teacher and the other aides. Painter immediately made some changes in the District's approach to teaching T.H., and the problematic behaviors began to subside. The lead teacher resigned in March 2006, and Painter became the lead teacher of the autism classroom.</p>\n<p>Painter testified at the due process hearing that she believed T.H.'s problems during the 2005-06 school year were largely caused by improper teaching techniques that had been used before she arrived. She testified that the lead teacher and the aides \"didn't have a very good understanding of the terminology, of the techniques that are used in applied behavior therapy.\" J.A. 364. Painter testified that when she arrived, T.H. \"was very aversive to the teaching situation. He would not sit for more than a second or two without someone physically prompting him to ... be there. He was not able to retain information that we had taught him.\" J.A. 366. Painter believed that if proper ABA techniques had been used in the fall of 2005, T.H. would have \"been able to sit and work. It would have, should have been a situation where he was a willing learner.\" J.A. 367. She testified that she spent a considerable portion of her time in the spring of 2006 correcting the problems that had been caused by improper teaching techniques. <i>See</i> J.A. 367. With Painter's efforts, T.H. by July 2006 had progressed to the point where he would sit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*482</span> and work with Painter for 20 minutes at a time.</p>\n<p>In August 2006, Painter took a position with a different school, and the District hired Sharon James as lead teacher for the autism class. James was a certified special education teacher and the mother of an autistic child, but she had never been trained in ABA therapy. T.H. did not do well under James. James had limited ability to control T.H.'s behaviorshe testified that he was out of his chair and running around the classroom about 50% of the timeand T.H.'s problematic behaviors (wiping his face, wetting his pants) returned.</p>\n<p>The District hired ABS, Inc., an educational consulting company, to provide ABA training and continuing supervision for James and the classroom aides. ABS provided a three-day training seminar for James and the classroom aides on September 13-15, 2006, more than a month after the school year had begun. After the training session had been completed, an ABS consultant observing the classroom believed that James was verbally and physically abusing the students and that James was actively resistant to the ABA approach. The consultant reported her observations to her supervisor, who in turn reported the problems to the District. Although the District investigated the matter, it could not substantiate the allegations of abuse and did not fire James. ABS then terminated its contract with the District, concluding that the District had, in essence, determined that its consultant had lied about James.</p>\n<p>On September 26, 2006, shortly after ABS terminated its contract with the District, the parents removed T.H. from Bates. The parents then brought in Painter, T.H.'s former teacher, to conduct an assessment. Painter concluded that T.H. had regressed from where he had been in July, when she last worked with him, and she found that he had again become aversive to teaching. For T.H.'s education the parents hired an experienced ABA \"line therapist\" to provide approximately 30 hours per week of ABA therapy to T.H. in the parents' home.</p>\n<p>The parents thereafter initiated due process proceedings, seeking a determination that the District was not providing T.H. with the \"free appropriate public education\" (\"FAPE\") required by the IDEA. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the first-line local hearing officer (\"LHO\") issued an opinion concluding that, in light of the District's failure to provide all of the ABA therapy required by the IEPs, the parents were entitled to some level of compensatory educational services from the District. The LHO, however, determined that the home placement was not appropriate because it did not provide the least restrictive environment for T.H.</p>\n<p>The parents appealed to a state review officer (\"SRO\"). The SRO expressed some uncertainty about whether the LHO had actually concluded that the District denied T.H. a FAPE, but, after reviewing all of the evidence, the SRO ultimately determined that the District had not provided T.H. with a FAPE. As to the appropriateness of the home placement, the SRO explained that the IDEA's least-restrictive-environment requirement does not strictly apply to private placements and that the overriding issue was whether the home placement was \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\" J.A. 807. The SRO concluded that the home placement was appropriate, given that it provided proper ABA therapy to T.H.; that T.H. had made educational progress in the home placement; and that the parents and the therapist made sure T.H. had regular opportunities to interact with other children. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*483</span> Because it was not entirely clear whether the parents were seeking reimbursement for the expenses associated with the home placement or whether the approval of the home placement would affect the need for any compensatory educational services, the SRO remanded the case to the LHO for additional proceedings related to the remedy.</p>\n<p>The District then initiated this action in federal district court challenging the SRO's decision. The district court expressed general agreement with the factual findings of the LHO, but determined that the LHO's legal conclusions \"do not logically flow from his factual findings, and therefore are not entitled to deference.\" J.A. 39. Agreeing with the SRO's analysis, the district court concluded that the District had denied T.H. a FAPE and that the home placement was appropriate. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>In the proceedings below, the District contended that it had provided T.H. with a FAPE in both the 2005-06 and the 2006-07 school years. On appeal, however, the District now concedes that, in light of the issues that arose after Painter resigned as lead teacher shortly before school started, it <i>did not</i> provide T.H. with a FAPE for part of the 2006-07 school year. The District contends, however, that by the time of the administrative hearing in December 2006, it had remedied all of the problems in the autism classroom. The District therefore concedes only that it denied T.H. a FAPE from the beginning of the 2006 school year through December 6, 2006, the date of the due process hearing. Accordingly, the District in this appeal raises two issues related to its obligation to provide a FAPE. It contends that the district court erred by concluding that the District failed to provide T.H. a FAPE during the 2005-06 school year, and that the district court failed to recognize that the District had remedied all of the problems by the time of the due process hearing and was at that time capable of providing T.H. with a FAPE. The District also argues that the district court erred by concluding that T.H.'s home placement was appropriate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>The District first contends that the district court erred by concluding that it failed to provide T.H. with a FAPE for the 2005-06 school year. Although the District acknowledges that it did not provide T.H. with all of the hours of ABA therapy required by the IEP, the District insists that it delivered significant portions of the services required by the IEP that provided some educational benefit to T.H., which is sufficient under the IDEA.</p>\n<p>The IDEA requires states receiving federal funds for education to provide disabled schoolchildren with a \"free appropriate public education.\" 20 U.S.C.A. § 1412(a)(1)(A) (West 2010). A FAPE \"consists of educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child, supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from the instruction.\" <i>Board of Educ. v.

However, as other courts have recognized, the failure to implement a material or significant portion of the IEP can amount to a denial of FAPE. <i>See </i><i>Van Duyn ex rel. Van Duyn v. Baker Sch.

Accordingly, we conclude that a material failure to implement an IEP, or, put another way, a failure to implement a material portion of an IEP, violates the IDEA.</p>\n<p>The District contends that its failure to completely implement the 2005-06 IEP was not material because, as determined by the LHO, T.H. in fact received some educational benefit during that school year. According to the District, the district court erred by failing to give proper deference to the LHO's factual findings on this point. We disagree.</p>\n<p>Preliminarily, we note that it is not entirely clear whether the LHO concluded that the District failed to provide a FAPE for the 2005-06 school year. Portions of the LHO's opinion seem to indicate that it found a denial of FAPEthe LHO stated that the District \"den[ied] T.H. a FAPE for the approximately 5.0 to 7.5 hours each week he was to be provided ABA therapy and didn't receive it in the [f]all of 2005,\" J.A. 778, and that the District's \"violations of T.H.'s IEPs did interfere somewhat with T.H.'s access to a FAPE,\" J.A. 780. However, the LHO also stated that T.H. had made progress and that T.H. received more than minimal educational benefit during the 2005-06 and 2006-07 school years, <i>see</i> J.A. 781, statements that, when considered in light of the scope of a state's obligation under the IDEA, suggest the District's failings did <i>not</i> deny T.H. a FAPE. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>MM ex rel. DM,</i> 303 F.3d at 526. There is, however, no need for us to decide whether the LHO determined that the District did not deny T.H. a FAPE, as the District argues, or that the District did deny T.H. a FAPE, as the parents argue, because the district court gave sufficient deference to the LHO's decision.</p>\n<p>A district court considering a challenge to a state administrative decision in an IDEA case makes an independent decision based on its view of the preponderance of the evidence. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) (West 2010). The district court must give \"due weight\" to the administrative proceedings, but the findings of fact and ultimate decision as to whether the state has complied with the IDEA are made by the district court. <i>Doyle v. Arlington Cnty. Sch. Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575224\"><a href=\"/opinion/575224/mairin-doyle-brian-doyle-margaret-doyle-v-arlington-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 103 (4th Cir.1991). \"Due <span class=\"star-pagination\">*485</span> weight\" means that administrative findings \"are entitled to be considered <i>prima facie</i> correct, akin to the traditional sense of permitting a result to be based on such fact-finding, but not requiring it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 105.</p>\n<p>In this case, the district court explicitly recognized that the LHO's factual findings were \"regularly made\" and thus did not fall within the exception to the due weight requirement articulated in <i>Doyle. See id.</i> at 104, 105 (explaining that if an administrative officer departs \"so far from the accepted norm of a fact-finding process designed to discover truth\"for example, by rejecting credibility determinations made by the hearing officerthe findings cannot be considered \"regularly made\" and those findings are entitled to no weight); <i>see also </i><i>J.P. ex rel. Peterson v. County Sch. Bd. of Hanover Cnty., Va.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1024968\"><a href=\"/opinion/1024968/jp-ex-rel-peterson-v-county-school-bd-hanover/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 259 (4th Cir.2008) (\"When determining whether a hearing officer's findings were regularly made, our cases have typically focused on the <i>process</i> through which the findings were made.\"). The district court acknowledged and accepted the LHO's factual findings, but the court believed that the evidence considered as a whole pointed to a different legal conclusion than that reached by the LHO. This was entirely appropriate and consistent with the district court's obligation to make its own independent determination of whether the District had provided T.H. with a FAPE.</p>\n<p>Moreover, when arguing that the court failed to give proper deference to the LHO's findings, the District largely ignores the significance of the SRO's findings. Like the district court, the SRO was obligated under the IDEA to review the record and make an independent decision based on his view of the preponderance of the evidence. The SRO weighed the evidence differently than did the LHO and drew different conclusions from the evidence, but the SRO did not improperly reject credibility findings made by the LHO or otherwise depart from the accepted norm of fact-finding. Because the SRO's findings were regularly made, they, too, were entitled to due weight by the district court. <i>See </i><i>Doyle,</i> 953 F.2d at 105 (\"When a state administrative appeals authority has departed from the fact-finding norm to such an extent as here, we think the facts so found as a result of that departure are entitled to no weight....\"); <i>Burke County Bd. of Educ. v. Denton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536191\"><a href=\"/opinion/536191/burke-county-board-of-education-v-christian-lee-denton-by-and-through-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span>, 981 (4th Cir.1990) (rejecting as \"simply incorrect\" the parents' claim that \"deference was due <i>only</i> to the review officer's conclusion\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>The question, then, is whether the district court committed clear error when making its independent determination that the District's failure to implement the 2005-06 IEP constituted a denial of FAPE. <i>See </i><i>County Sch. Bd. of Henrico Cnty. v. Z.P.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789369\"><a href=\"/opinion/789369/county-school-board-of-henrico-county-virginia-v-zp-a-minor-by-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 309 (4th Cir. 2005) (whether a school has satisfied its obligations under the IDEA is a factual issue reviewed for clear error). We believe that question must be answered in the negative. The evidence in the record shows that the 2005-06 school year was an extraordinarily difficult one for T.H. In the fall of 2005, he was \"very aversive to the teaching situation,\" would not sit still \"for more than a second or two,\" J.A. 366, and was engaging in harmful behaviors like biting himself and wiping his face until it bled. Painter, the board-certified ABA therapist who worked in the classroom in 2005-06, testified that T.H.'s problems were caused by the failure of the lead teacher and the classroom aides to properly understand and implement ABA techniques, and that it took her until July 2006 to bring T.H. back to the point where he previously should have and would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> been if the teachers had understood and properly implemented the ABA methodology.</p>\n<p>While there is evidence showing that T.H. made some gains in certain skill areas tested in the spring of 2006, these gains were not so significant as to <i>require</i> a conclusion that T.H. received some non-trivial educational benefit from the 2005-06 IEP as implemented by the District. When the evidence of T.H.'s small improvements in a few tested areas is considered against the District's conceded failure to provide the 15 hours of ABA therapy required by the IEP, the evidence that the lead teacher and aides (other than Painter) did not understand or use proper ABA techniques, and the evidence that it took Painter months of working with T.H. to correct the problems caused by the improper implementation of ABA techniques, we cannot say that the district court erred, much less clearly erred, by concluding that the District's failure to properly implement material portions of the IEP denied T.H. a FAPE for the 2005-06 school year. <i>Cf. </i><i>Hall ex rel. Hall v. Vance Cnty. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"459001\"><a href=\"/opinion/459001/james-a-hall-iv-by-his-guardian-ad-litem-james-a-hall-iii-james-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span>, 636 (4th Cir.1985) (\"Congress did not intend that a school system could discharge its duty ... by providing a program that produces some minimal academic advancement, no matter how trivial.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Although the District now concedes that it did not provide a FAPE for the first part of the 2006 school year, it contends that as of the date of the due process hearing (December 6, 2006), it had remedied the problems with its autism program. The District thus argues that the district court should have held that the District was <i>capable</i> of providing a FAPE as of December 6, 2006. The District contends that such a conclusion is relevant to the determination of the scope and extent of the remedy to be imposed for the District's failure to provide a FAPE.</p>\n<p>We agree as a general matter that post-removal changes or improvements to a school's educational program can be relevant in the remedial context, <i>cf. </i><i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick,</i> 553 F.3d at 325 (noting that when determining whether reimbursement is appropriate, the district court may consider, among other things, \"the existence of other, perhaps more appropriate, substitute placements\"), and we will assume that the District's post-removal capability to properly implement an IEP would be relevant to the remedial question in this case. Even with that assumption, however, we cannot conclude that the district court erred by not finding that the District was capable of providing a FAPE at the time of the due process hearing.</p>\n<p>The evidence of the District's improved capabilities was far from concrete. The evidence established that the District had entered into a contract with MaySouth, Inc., to provide ABA consultation services, technical assistance, and training as needed by the District. As of the time of the hearing, however, a MaySouth consultant had observed the autism classroom, but there had been no ABA training or supervision, nor had MaySouth and the District even yet settled on a schedule for visits by a consultant. (A MaySouth consultant testified that he expected a consultant would probably visit the school about once a week, but certainly no less than once every two weeks.) The District had also engaged the services of Dr. Eric Drasko, a professor from the University of South Carolina and an acknowledged expert in the field, but again, the evidence of the services he was to provide was far <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> from certain or specific.<sup>[2]</sup> This evidence certainly shows that the District was taking seriously the need to improve its program for educating autistic students. We cannot say, however, that the District's evidence so compellingly established the District's capability at the time of the due process hearing that the district court committed clear error by not finding the District capable of providing a FAPE to T.H.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We turn now to the District's challenge to the determination that the home placement was appropriate and therefore would serve as the \"stay put\" placement until the District established an adequate program.<sup>[3]</sup> According to the District, the home placement is not appropriate because it is too restrictive and because the parents failed to present sufficient evidence that the home placement was reasonably calculated to provide an educational benefit to T.H.</p>\n<p>The IDEA requires states seeking education funding to ensure that</p>\n<blockquote>[t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.</blockquote>\n<p>20 U.S.C.A. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (West 2010). The LHO applied this statutory preference for \"mainstreaming\" to T.H.'s home placement, concluding that the home placement was not the least restrictive environment and therefore was not appropriate.</p>\n<p>As the district court noted, however, this circuit has \"never held that parental placements must meet the least restrictive environment requirement.\" <i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick,</i> 553 F.3d at 327. As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote>mainstreaming is a policy to be pursued so long as it is consistent with the Act's primary goal of providing disabled students with an appropriate education. Where necessary for educational reasons, mainstreaming assumes a subordinate role in formulating an educational program. In any event, the Act's preference for mainstreaming was aimed at preventing schools from segregating handicapped students from the general student body; the school district has presented no evidence that the policy was meant to restrict parental options when the public schools fail to comply with the requirements of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Carter ex rel.

Thus, while a parental placement is not inappropriate simply because it does not meet the least-restrictive-environment requirement, it is nonetheless proper for a court to consider the restrictiveness of the private placement <i>as a factor</i> when determining the appropriateness of the placement. <i>See </i><i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick,</i> 553 F.3d at 327 (\"[T]he district court's consideration of [the private placement's] restrictive nature was proper because it considered the restrictive nature only as a factor in determining whether the placement was appropriate under the IDEA, not as a dispositive requirement.\").</p>\n<p>The evidence established that the parents were well aware of the need for T.H. to interact with non-disabled children. To meet this need, the line therapist who provided ABA therapy to T.H. regularly took T.H. to parks and into the community for social interactions, and T.H.'s father likewise took T.H. into the community on a daily basis. The district court properly considered this evidence and the restrictiveness of the home placement as a factor, but not the dispositive factor, in its determination of the appropriateness of the home placement.</p>\n<p>While more detailed evidence of the nature of the community outings and the manner in which the parents were using the outings to improve T.H.'s social skills would have been preferable, we cannot say that the evidence was so thin that the district court clearly erred by considering it. The District's claim that the more restrictive nature of the home placement and its more limited opportunities for social interaction makes the home placement inappropriate is in reality a complaint about the weight the district court gave this factor when determining the appropriateness of the placement. We see no basis in the record, however, for concluding that the district court's determination about the relative weight to be given to this factor amounted to clear error.</p>\n<p>And on the broader question of whether the parents' evidence was sufficient to support the district court's conclusion that the home placement was appropriate, we again find no clear error. A parental placement is appropriate if the placement is \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,\" <i>M.S. ex rel. Simchick,</i> 553 F.3d at 325 (internal quotation marks omitted), or stated somewhat differently, if \"the private education services obtained by the parents were appropriate to the child's needs,\" <i>A.K. ex rel. J.K. v. Alexandria City Sch. Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797569\"><a href=\"/opinion/797569/ak-a-minor-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-jk-and-es-v-alexandria/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 679-80 (4th Cir.2007). T.H.'s mother, herself board-certified in ABA therapy, testified that T.H. was receiving approximately 30 hours per week of ABA services provided by an experienced ABA line therapist; that the parents and the ABA therapist made sure T.H. had sufficient opportunities to interact with other children; and that T.H. was progressing both educationally and behaviorally under the home program, in that he was happier, learning more, and was no longer engaging in the problematic behaviors like wiping his face until it bled.</p>\n<p>The SRO, applying the correct legal standard, considered the parents' evidence and concluded that the home placement was appropriate, and the district court properly gave weight to the SRO's analysis.<sup>[4]</sup> And after considering all of the evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> and the SRO's views, the district court likewise determined that the home placement was appropriate.</p>\n<p>The parents' evidence about the home placement was not very extensive, and it was short on details and specifics. Nonetheless, the evidence established that T.H. was receiving intensive ABA therapy, the kind of therapy that the District through its IEPs had concluded was necessary to provide T.H. with an appropriate education, and that T.H. was responding well to the program. Under these circumstances, we believe the evidence was sufficient, if barely, to support the district court's conclusion. We therefore cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred by determining that the home placement was reasonably calculated to enable T.H. to receive educational benefits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we hereby affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED</i></p>\n<p>WYNN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority that Sumter County School District 17 (\"the School District\") failed to provide T.H. with a free appropriate public education. However, I write separately to dissent from the majority's holding that there was sufficient evidence in the record to show that homeplacement was appropriate. In light of this lack of evidence, I would remand this matter to the district court for additional fact finding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>As the majority details, the services provided by the School District were insufficient to provide the educational services needed to comply with the Individualized Education Plans (\"IEPs\") developed for T.H., an autistic student. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9) (indicating that, to satisfy their obligation to provide a free appropriate public education, schools must provide special education and related services \"in conformity with the individualized education program\" designed for the student). Specifically, the School District's failure to ensure the effective provision of Applied Behavior Analysis (\"ABA\") therapy constituted a failure to implement a material element of each IEP designed to guide T.H.'s education. <i>See </i><i>Neosho R-V Sch. Dist. v. Clark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780440\"><a href=\"/opinion/780440/neosho-r-v-school-district-appellantcross-appellee-v-kathy-clark-garry/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span>, 1027 n. 3 (8th Cir.2003) (concluding that the IDEA is violated \"if there is evidence that the school actually failed to implement an essential element of the IEP that was necessary for the child to receive an educational benefit\"); <i>Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Bobby R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"19790\"><a href=\"/opinion/19790/houston-isd-v-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 349 (5th Cir.2000) (\"[T]o prevail on a claim under the IDEA, a party challenging the implementation of an IEP must show more than a <i>de minimis</i> failure to implement all elements of that IEP, and, instead, must demonstrate that the school board or other authorities failed to implement substantial or significant provisions of the IEP.\"). Thus, I agree with the majority's conclusion that the School District failed to provide T.H. with a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p>I also agree with the majority's analysis of the weight that courts should give to the \"least-restrictive environment requirement\" when considering the appropriateness of home-placement. Though failure to meet this requirement might establish a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> school district's failure to comply with the IDEA, <i>see</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A), this \"requirement\" must logically be relaxed when considering the appropriateness of an educational program designed for implementation in the relative isolation of a child's home. However, as the majority recognizes, whether the private placement adheres to this relaxed conception of the restrictiveness requirement is still a factor to be considered when assessing the overall appropriateness of private placement.</p>\n<p>Still, notwithstanding my substantial agreement with portions of the majority opinion, I cannot agree with the majority that the home-placement program in place to educate T.H. is \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\" <i>See </i><i>M.S. ex rel.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span> (1982)(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the only evidence provided as to the design of the educational program provided for T.H. at home was the testimony of his mother, May Baird. Baird testified that she had hired Laura Walkup, \"a young woman who has experience working in an ABA program,\" to work with T.H. during the school week. When pressed on cross-examination, she admitted that she was unsure how many hours Walkup worked with T.H. during a given week, stating that her husband \"would be a better one to answer that.\" Indeed, Baird indicated throughout her testimony that she was \"not the best one to answer\" questions regarding the details of the services provided to T.H. because she is \"often not home.\" However, Baird was able to approximate that Walkup worked with T.H. for \"20 to 30 hours\" per week.</p>\n<p>Notably, Baird failed to elaborate on the details of the educational services provided by Walkup. Problematically, she made no mention of the goals of the therapy, indicating merely that Walkup was \"working on specific objectives.\" This lack of specificity stands in stark contrast to the IEPs developed for T.H., which include pages of detailed educational objectives related to, <i>inter alia,</i> his \"socialization skills,\" \"classroom work skills,\" \"general knowledge and comprehension skills,\" \"daily living skills,\" and \"functional communication skills.\" Moreover, Baird provided no testimony regarding how the program was designed to measure progress toward the unidentified \"specific objectives,\" or how much progress was required to demonstrate accomplishment of said objectives. In short, given <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> that the Court is asked to consider whether the program designed for T.H. would meet his \"unique needs,\" without more clarification of the contents of the program, I cannot answer that question affirmatively.</p>\n<p>In addition, Baird made no mention of the services other than ABA therapy, if any, that were provided for T.H. at home.<sup>[2]</sup> As noted by the School District, there was \"no evidence that speech-language therapy or occupational therapy, two related services included in the school IEP as supportive services ... were provided in the home program.\" Brief of Appellant at 47. To be sure, given T.H.'s autism, properly administered ABA therapy was a necessary component of any plan reasonably calculated to confer on him an educational benefit. But the ill-defined nature of that therapy counsels us to remand this matter to the district court for the fact-finding necessary to determine whether its provision was sufficient to demonstrate the appropriateness of home-placement.</p>\n<p>That said, the evidence concerning therapy was not the only evidence offered concerning the program in place to educate T.H. at home. Baird also testified about opportunities provided for T.H. to socialize. Presumably, this testimony was given in an attempt to demonstrate compliance with the least-restrictive-environment requirement. But, even under an appropriately relaxed restrictiveness inquiry, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the home-placement program would provide T.H. with adequate opportunities to interact with children who are not disabled. This point is acknowledged, in part, by the majority opinion which states that \"more detailed evidence of the nature of the community outings and the manner in which the parents were using the outings to improve T.H.'s social skills would have been preferable.\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, scant evidence was provided regarding opportunities for T.H. to interact with non-disabled children. Baird testified that the therapist hired to work with T.H. \"fairly regularly\" took him \"for social opportunities on playgrounds and stuff around locally.\" She also indicated that T.H.'s father took the child into the community \"on a daily basis.\" However, Baird, who was not present during these outings, was unable to testify as to their duration. Also, her testimony is unclear regarding the frequency with which T.H. interacted with <i>non-disabled</i> children during these trips into the community.<sup>[3]</sup> If undefined periods of socialization with other children, regardless of whether or not they are disabled, are sufficient to satisfy the \"least-restrictive-environment requirement,\" that requirement is rendered a nullity.</p>\n<p>In sum, where there was insufficient evidence as to how the plan designed to educate a child at home is calculated to actually provide an educational benefit, it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> was error for the district court to say that the \"calculation\" was reasonable. Accordingly, this matter should be remanded so that the district court can further examine the contents and structure of the plan proposed during home-placement. Without more evidence explaining the contents of the plan, a conclusion regarding its adequacy cannot be drawn absent considerable speculation.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The statute under consideration in <i>Rowley</i> was the \"Education of the Handicapped Act,\" <i>see </i><i>Board of Educ. v.
