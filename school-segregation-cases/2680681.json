The district\n\n27   court concluded that regulations promulgated under the Patient Protection and\n\n28   Affordable Care Act that allow religious non-profit employers to opt out of\n\n\n                                              3\n\f 1   providing contraceptive coverage themselves violate these religious employers’\n\n 2   rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. We reverse, concluding that\n\n 3   the challenged accommodation for religious objectors relieves, rather than\n\n 4   imposes, any substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise, and thus does\n\n 5   not violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\n 6                                   BACKGROUND\n\n 7         I. Statutory and Regulatory Background\n\n 8         This case concerns regulations promulgated under the Patient Protection\n\n 9   and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “ACA”), Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119.\n\n10   The ACA generally requires employers with fifty or more full-time employees to\n\n11   offer “a group health plan or group health insurance coverage” that provides\n\n12   “minimum essential coverage.” 26 U.S.C. § 5000A(f)(2); id. § 4980H(a)(1), (c)(2).\n\n13   Unless an exception applies, as part of this minimal essential coverage, the ACA\n\n14   requires an employer’s group health plan or group health insurance coverage to\n\n15   furnish “preventive care and screenings” for female employees without “any cost\n\n16   sharing requirements.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). Without “cost sharing\n\n17   requirements” means without requiring plan participants and beneficiaries to\n\n18   make copayments or pay deductibles or coinsurance. See 45 C.F.R. §\n\n\n                                              4\n\f 1   147.131(c)(2)(ii). An employer whose health plan does not include the required\n\n 2   coverage is subject to penalties of $100 per day, per affected beneficiary. 26 U.S.C.\n\n 3   § 4980D(b). An employer who drops employee health care coverage altogether is\n\n 4   generally subject to a penalty of $2000 per year, per employee, after the first thirty\n\n 5   employees. Id. § 4980H(a), (c)(1), (c)(2)(D)(i).\n\n 6         The ACA does not specify what types of preventive care must be covered\n\n 7   for female plan participants and beneficiaries. Instead, Congress left that issue to\n\n 8   be determined via regulation by the Health Resources and Services\n\n 9   Administration (“HRSA”), a division of the Department of Health and Human\n\n10   Services (“HHS”). 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). In developing guidelines for\n\n11   preventative health services for women, HRSA requested the assistance of the\n\n12   Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences\n\n13   established in 1970 to inform health policy with available scientific information.\n\n14   See Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of\n\n15   Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 77\n\n16   Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726 (Feb. 15, 2012); Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\n17   Servs., 772 F.3d 229, 238 (D.C. Cir. 2014).\n\n18         In August 2011, consistent with IOM’s recommendations, HRSA\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f 1   promulgated the Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, which generally\n\n 2   require non-exempt employers to provide “coverage, without cost sharing, for all\n\n 3   Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraceptive methods,\n\n 4   sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women\n\n 5   with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a [health care] provider.” 77 Fed.\n\n 6   Reg. at 8725 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). These\n\n 7   contraceptive coverage requirements were subsequently enacted by the three\n\n 8   agencies responsible for the ACA’s implementation – the Department of the\n\n 9   Treasury, the Department of Labor, and HHS. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n10   2713(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv). We\n\n11   refer to this required coverage as the “contraceptive coverage mandate.”\n\n12         The ACA and its implementing regulations create an exemption from the\n\n13   contraceptive coverage mandate for “religious employer[s],” a category that\n\n14   encompasses “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or\n\n15   associations of churches,” as well as “the exclusively religious activities of any\n\n16   religious order.” 26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). The\n\n17   government created this exemption in response to concerns from religious\n\n18   groups objecting to the contraceptive coverage mandate.\n\n\n                                                6\n\f 1         In response to continued objections from religiously-affiliated\n\n 2   organizations that did not qualify for the “religious employer” exemption, the\n\n 3   government also crafted the so-called “accommodation,” which applies more\n\n 4   broadly to religious non-profit organizations that object to providing\n\n 5   contraceptive coverage. The accommodation was so named because it allows\n\n 6   religious employers to opt out of paying for objectionable medical services\n\n 7   without denying these services to employees who may or may not share the\n\n 8   religious beliefs of their employer. Under the applicable regulations, an\n\n 9   organization is eligible for this accommodation if it satisfies the following criteria:\n\n10         (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n11         contraceptive services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on\n12         account of religious objections.\n13\n14         (2) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity.\n15\n16         (3) The organization holds itself out as a religious organization.\n17\n18         (4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by\n19         the Secretary, that it satisfies the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through\n20         (3) of this section, and makes such self-certification available for\n21         examination upon request by the first day of the first plan year to\n22         which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this section applies. . . .\n23\n24   45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(a); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f 1   2713A(a). We refer to organizations that meet these criteria as “eligible\n\n 2   organizations.”2\n\n 3         By way of background, eligible organizations generally provide their\n\n 4   employees insurance in one of two ways. Employers are said to have an\n\n 5   “insured” plan if they contract with an insurance company for insurance – the\n\n 6   insurance company bears the financial risk of paying health insurance claims.\n\n 7   Other employers, like the Plaintiffs here, who bear the financial risk of paying\n\n 8   claims themselves, are said to have “self-insured” plans. Many self-insured\n\n 9   employers use insurance companies or other third parties to administer their\n\n10   plans, performing functions such as developing networks of providers,\n\n11   negotiating payment rates, and processing claims. In this context, the insurance\n\n12   company or other third party is called a “third-party administrator” or “TPA.”\n\n13   See generally Congressional Budget Office, Key Issues in Analyzing Major Health\n\n14   Insurance Proposals 6 (2008).\n\n\n\n\n           2\n             Revisions to these regulations extending the accommodation to closely\n     held for-profit entities with similar religious objections are scheduled to take\n     effect September 14, 2015. See Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\n     Affordable Care Act, 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318, 41,318, 41,323 (July 14, 2015).\n\n                                              8\n\f 1         Under the regulations, an eligible organization is not required “to contract,\n\n 2   arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage” to which it has religious\n\n 3   objections. Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care\n\n 4   Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,874 (July 2, 2013). To be relieved of these obligations,\n\n 5   an eligible organization has two options. First, it can complete a notification form\n\n 6   issued by the Department of Labor, indicating that it has a religious objection to\n\n 7   providing coverage for the required contraceptive services, and send a copy to its\n\n 8   insurance company or third-party administrator. See id. at 39,875; see also 29\n\n 9   C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(a)(4), (b)(1)(ii)(A), (c)(1)(i). This one-page self-\n\n10   certification form requires only the name of the organization, and the name, title,\n\n11   and contact information of the person signing it. See Department of Labor, EBSA\n\n12   Form 700, http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/preventiveserviceseligibleorganization\n\n13   certificationform.pdf.\n\n14         Second, an alternative notification option stems from the Supreme Court’s\n\n15   orders in Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, Denver, Colorado v. Sebelius, 134\n\n16   S. Ct. 1022 (2014), and Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014). In both\n\n17   orders, the Supreme Court granted injunctions pending appeal to non-profits\n\n18   covered by the accommodation, providing that instead of self-certifying using the\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f 1   Department of Labor’s one-page form, they could instead send a letter to HHS\n\n 2   detailing their religious objections in their own words. HHS, in turn, would then\n\n 3   be responsible for informing the non-profits’ third-party administrators to begin\n\n 4   providing separate contraceptive coverage to the non-profits’ employees. In\n\n 5   August 2014, long after the district court’s judgment in this case, HHS issued new\n\n 6   interim final rules for non-profits that essentially codified these orders. See\n\n 7   Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 79 Fed.\n\n 8   Reg. 51,092, 51,092 (Aug. 27, 2014). These rules were finalized in July 2015. See\n\n 9   Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 80 Fed.\n\n10   Reg. 41,318, 41,323 (July 14, 2015). Under the new rules, an eligible organization\n\n11   can choose to either fill out the Department of Labor’s form and send it to its\n\n12   third-party administrator, or it can write to HHS directly using its own words or\n\n13   a sample letter provided by HHS. This notice to the government is not required\n\n14   to take a particular form, but must include information on the entity’s plan name\n\n15   and type, along with “the name and contact information for any of the plan’s\n\n16   third-party administrators and health insurance issuers.” 29 C.F.R. §\n\n17   2590.715–2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(1)(ii).\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f 1         Once an eligible organization chooses to take advantage of the\n\n 2   accommodation and notifies its third-party administrator or HHS by using one of\n\n 3   the methods specified by the regulations, the plan’s participants and beneficiaries\n\n 4   will generally still have access to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing\n\n 5   through alternative mechanisms established by government regulations. When\n\n 6   an eligible organization that chooses not to provide contraceptive coverage has a\n\n 7   “self-insured” plan like the Plaintiffs’ plans here, the regulations, depending on\n\n 8   the type of plan, either require or incentivize3 the third-party administrator to\n\n 9   provide or arrange its own separate payments for contraceptive services for plan\n\n10   participants and beneficiaries. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2). Importantly, the\n\n11   regulations require the third-party administrator to fully divorce the eligible\n\n12   organization from payments for contraceptive coverage. See id. § 2590.715-\n\n\n\n           3\n             When employers with self-insured plans offer insurance through what is\n     known as a “church plan,” the government lacks authority under the Employee\n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. (“ERISA”), to\n     regulate the third-party administrators that administer the plans. 29 U.S.C. §§\n     1002(33), 1003(b)(2). Thus, rather than requiring third-party administrators to\n     offer contraceptive coverage once an eligible organization opts out, the\n     regulations incentivize such coverage by providing reimbursement in excess of\n     costs for third-party administrators. See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(3); 45\n     C.F.R. § 156.50(d). Here, all of the Plaintiffs offer health coverage through self-\n     insured church plans.\n\n                                              11\n\f 1   2713A(b)(2)(i). The regulations bar the third-party administrator from imposing\n\n 2   any premium, fee or other charge, directly or indirectly, on the eligible\n\n 3   organization or the group health plan with respect to payments for contraceptive\n\n 4   services. See id. Instead, the third-party administrator may seek reimbursement\n\n 5   for payments for contraceptive services directly from the federal government. See\n\n 6   id. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(3); see also 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d). Third-party\n\n 7   administrators are required to “segregate” accounting for contraceptive coverage\n\n 8   from the eligible organization’s plan excluding such coverage. 29 C.F.R. §\n\n 9   2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(ii).4\n\n10         In addition, an eligible organization that opts out of providing\n\n11   contraceptive coverage has no obligation to inform plan participants and\n\n\n\n           4\n              Similarly, when an eligible organization that chooses not to provide\n     coverage has an insured plan, the health insurance company that issues the\n     policy for that organization is required by regulation to provide separate\n     payments for contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries. See 45\n     C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2). The insurance issuer may not impose any premium, fee, or\n     other charge, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization or the group\n     health plan with respect to the issuer’s payments for contraceptive services. See\n     id. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii). The insurance issuer must “[e]xpressly exclude\n     contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in\n     connection with the . . . plan,” id. § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(A), and “segregate premium\n     revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide\n     payments for contraceptive services,” id. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii).\n\n                                               12\n\f 1   beneficiaries of the availability of these separate payments made by third parties.\n\n 2   Instead, the third-party administrator itself provides this notice, and does so\n\n 3   “separate from” materials that are distributed in connection with the eligible\n\n 4   organization’s group health coverage. Id. § 2590.715-2713A(d). Third-party\n\n 5   administrators bear the burden of contacting beneficiaries, and eligible\n\n 6   organizations are not required to provide these entities the names of their\n\n 7   beneficiaries or otherwise coordinate these notices. See id. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(4),\n\n 8   (c)(1)(i); Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 254 (noting that “[n]o regulation related to the\n\n 9   accommodation imposes any such duty on Plaintiffs”). Furthermore, the third-\n\n10   party administrator’s notice must make clear that the eligible organization is\n\n11   neither administering nor funding the contraceptive benefits, specifying that “the\n\n12   eligible organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but that\n\n13   the third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, provides separate payments\n\n14   for contraceptive services.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d).\n\n15         II. Factual Background and Procedural History\n\n16         The relevant plaintiffs on appeal are a group of religious non-profit\n\n17   organizations affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.5 Plaintiffs Cardinal\n\n\n           5\n               The plaintiffs below also included the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of\n\n                                                 13\n\f 1   Spellman High School and Monsignor Farrell High School are non-profit\n\n 2   Catholic high schools located in the Bronx and Staten Island, respectively. As\n\n 3   affiliated entities of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, Cardinal\n\n 4   Spellman and Monsignor Farrell offer health insurance to their employees under\n\n 5   the Archdiocese’s self-insured health plan, which is administered by United\n\n 6   Healthcare and CVS Caremark as third-party administrators. Plaintiff Catholic\n\n 7   Health Care System (also known as ArchCare) is a non-profit organization that\n\n 8   provides health coverage to more than 1000 employees and their dependents\n\n 9   under a self-insured plan administered by Emblem Health and CVS Caremark.\n\n10   Plaintiff Catholic Health Services of Long Island is a non-profit organization that\n\n11   provides health coverage to approximately 11,000 employees and their\n\n12   dependents under three self-insured plans administered by Empire BlueCross\n\n13   BlueShield and Express Scripts.\n\n14         While none of these entities qualify as “religious employers” under the\n\n15   exemption to the contraceptive coverage mandate, all of them are eligible for the\n\n\n     New York and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, New York – both\n     of whom are exempt from the contraceptive coverage mandate as religious\n     employers – as well as Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Rockville Centre. The\n     district court dismissed the claims of these plaintiffs and these decisions are not\n     challenged on appeal.\n\n                                              14\n\f 1   accommodation to the mandate. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs contend that the\n\n 2   contraceptive coverage mandate, including the accommodation, violates their\n\n 3   rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb\n\n 4   et seq. RFRA provides that the government “shall not substantially burden a\n\n 5   person’s exercise of religion” unless the application of that burden is the least\n\n 6   restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. 42 U.S.C. §\n\n 7   2000bb-1. As affiliates of the Catholic Church, Plaintiffs adhere to the Church’s\n\n 8   teachings that life begins at the moment of conception, and that “abortion-\n\n 9   inducing” products, contraception, and sterilization are immoral.6 Plaintiffs’\n\n10   beliefs forbid them from taking actions that would make them complicit in the\n\n11   delivery of these services, and thus they believe that they are prohibited from\n\n12   paying for, providing, or facilitating access to contraception. Plaintiffs argue that\n\n\n           6\n             Plaintiffs contend that some forms of contraception can induce an\n     abortion. While we do not doubt the sincerity of their beliefs, we note that the\n     contraceptive coverage mandate deals only with drugs that fall within the FDA’s\n     definition of “contraception,” not drugs which the FDA qualifies as “abortion-\n     inducing.” See 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725 (requiring coverage only for all “[FDA]\n     approved contraceptive methods” and “sterilization procedures” (alterations and\n     internal quotation marks omitted)). We recognize that Plaintiffs do not accept the\n     FDA’s proposition and argue that some of the covered methods are abortion-\n     inducing. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2759 (2014) (“The\n     owners of the businesses have religious objections to abortion, and according to\n     their religious beliefs the four contraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients.”).\n\n                                               15\n\f 1   opting out of the coverage requirement substantially burdens their religious\n\n 2   exercise because they believe that by doing so, they facilitate access to products\n\n 3   and services they find objectionable. Thus, Plaintiffs contend that the ACA leaves\n\n 4   them with the choice of: (1) providing contraceptive coverage in violation of their\n\n 5   religious beliefs, (2) paying significant penalties for failing to provide the\n\n 6   required health coverage, or (3) utilizing an accommodation which also forces\n\n 7   them to violate their religious beliefs.\n\n 8         Plaintiffs brought suit in district court challenging the contraceptive\n\n 9   coverage mandate under RFRA and seeking an injunction barring its\n\n10   enforcement.7 On December 16, 2013, the district court granted Plaintiffs\n\n11   summary judgment on their RFRA claim and denied the government’s cross-\n\n12   motion for summary judgment as to this claim. The district court concluded that\n\n13   the accommodation placed a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion,\n\n14   and that the government failed to show that the accommodation was the least\n\n15   restrictive means to advance a compelling governmental interest. The district\n\n\n\n           7\n            Plaintiffs, along with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, the\n     Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, New York, and Catholic Charities of\n     the Diocese of Rockville Centre, also pressed other statutory and constitutional\n     claims not relevant here.\n\n                                                16\n\f 1   court enjoined enforcement of the contraceptive coverage mandate against\n\n 2   Plaintiffs and entered final judgment.\n\n 3          III. Parallel Proceedings\n\n 4          Plaintiffs’ challenge to the contraceptive coverage mandate is not unique.\n\n 5   Religious non-profit organizations throughout the country have brought similar\n\n 6   RFRA challenges. In the time since the district court issued its opinion, six\n\n 7   circuits have rejected these claims, either on the merits or by denial of a\n\n 8   preliminary injunction.

Burwell, --- F.3d ----, 2015 WL 3988356, at *4 (7th\n\n16   Cir. July 1, 2015).\n\n17          These cases are still actively moving through the courts. Similar cases are\n\n18   pending in the Eighth and Eleventh Circuits. See Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t\n\n                                                17\n\f 1   of Health & Human Servs., No. 14-1507 (8th Cir. argued Dec. 10, 2014); Eternal Word\n\n 2   Television Network, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 14-12696 (11th\n\n 3   Cir. argued Feb. 4, 2015). In addition, in light of the Supreme Court’s opinion in\n\n 4   Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), the Eleventh Circuit\n\n 5   granted an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the accommodation against the\n\n 6   plaintiffs pending appeal. Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sec’y, U.S. Dep’t\n\n 7   of Health & Human Servs., 756 F.3d 1339, 1340 (11th Cir. 2014). Earlier this year, the\n\n 8   Supreme Court also vacated and remanded both the original Seventh Circuit\n\n 9   opinion in University of Notre Dame and the Sixth Circuit opinion, which were\n\n10   decided prior to Hobby Lobby, for further consideration in light of that decision.\n\n11   See Mich. Catholic Conference v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 1914 (2015); Univ. of Notre Dame\n\n12   v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015). Although the Seventh Circuit reaffirmed its\n\n13   original conclusion on remand, see Univ. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 619, the Sixth\n\n14   Circuit case remains pending. We note also that petitions for certiorari are\n\n15   pending for the decisions of the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits. With\n\n16   respect to the Third Circuit’s decision, the Supreme Court declined to recall and\n\n17   stay issuance of the mandate, but enjoined enforcement of the accommodation\n\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\f 1   against the plaintiffs pending disposition of the petition for certiorari. Zubik v.\n\n 2   Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2924 (2015).\n\n 3                                      DISCUSSION\n\n 4         “We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment.” Byrne v.\n\n 5   Rutledge, 623 F.3d 46, 52 (2d Cir. 2010). We “will affirm only if, construing the\n\n 6   evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, ‘there is no genuine\n\n 7   dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\n 8   of law.’” State Emp. Bargaining Agent Coal. v. Rowland, 718 F.3d 126, 131–32 (2d\n\n 9   Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). When, as here, we review a district\n\n10   court’s treatment of cross-motions for summary judgment we “evaluate each\n\n11   party’s motion on its own merits, taking care in each instance to draw all\n\n12   reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.”\n\n13   Byrne, 623 F.3d at 53 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n14         I. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n\n15         Under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, the government\n\n16   may not “prohibit[] the free exercise” of religion. U.S. Const. amend. I. In 1990,\n\n17   the Supreme Court clarified its Free Exercise Clause jurisprudence by holding\n\n18   that the government need not have a compelling governmental interest in order\n\n\n                                               19\n\f 1   to enact neutral, generally applicable laws that happen to burden religious\n\n 2   practice. See Emp’t Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 882–90\n\n 3   (1990). While consistent with much of the Supreme Court’s prior free exercise\n\n 4   precedent, Smith was arguably in tension with two prior Supreme Court cases,\n\n 5   both of which the Smith Court declined to overrule. Id. at 881–85. In these cases,\n\n 6   the Court used strict-scrutiny like analysis and asked whether the challenged law\n\n 7   substantially burdened a religious practice and, if it did, whether that burden\n\n 8   was justified by a compelling governmental interest. See Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406\n\n 9   U.S. 205, 220–21 (1972); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 405–06 (1963).\n\n10         In response to Smith, Congress enacted RFRA, which provides in relevant\n\n11   part that the “[g]overnment may substantially burden a person’s exercise of\n\n12   religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person . . . is\n\n13   in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and “is the least restrictive\n\n14   means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n15   2000bb-1(b); see also Sossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651, 1656 (2011) (noting that by\n\n16   enacting RFRA, Congress “intended to ‘restore the compelling interest test as set\n\n17   forth in Sherbert v. Verner and Wisconsin v. Yoder . . . in all cases where free\n\n18   exercise of religion is substantially burdened.’” (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b)(1))\n\n\n                                                20\n\f 1   (citation omitted)). While RFRA’s “compelling interest” prong stems from\n\n 2   Sherbert and Yoder, the “least restrictive means” prong was not used pre-Smith.\n\n 3   See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 509 (1997). RFRA accordingly employs a\n\n 4   strict scrutiny standard that provides “even broader protection for religious\n\n 5   liberty” than existed previously. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2761 n.3. In sum, while\n\n 6   “the Free Exercise Clause does not normally ‘inhibit enforcement of otherwise\n\n 7   valid laws of general application that incidentally burden religious conduct,’ . . . .\n\n 8   RFRA, in contrast, requires strict scrutiny of such laws where the incidental\n\n 9   burden on religion is substantial.” Hankins v. Lyght, 441 F.3d 96, 111–12 (2d Cir.\n\n10   2006) (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 714 (2005)).\n\n11         II. Substantial Burden\n\n12         At the threshold, RFRA requires us to assess whether Plaintiffs have shown\n\n13   a substantial burden on their exercise of religion. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533\n\n14   (noting that the burden on this issue lies with the religious objector). “[I]f the\n\n15   law’s requirements do not amount to a substantial burden under RFRA, that is\n\n16   the end of the matter.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 244.\n\n17         Here, Plaintiffs argue that the ACA’s contraceptive mandate, including the\n\n18   accommodation, constitutes a substantial burden on their religious exercise by\n\n\n                                                21\n\f 1   forcing them to choose among three unacceptable options: (1) provide\n\n 2   contraceptive coverage, (2) pay the fines and penalties associated with failure to\n\n 3   provide contraceptive coverage, or (3) opt out of the contraceptive coverage\n\n 4   mandate via the accommodation, using either method of self-certification.\n\n 5         On its face, the final option, designed by the government to (a) extricate\n\n 6   employers with religious objections from the provision of contraceptive coverage,\n\n 7   and (b) place the burden for such coverage on third-party administrators, would\n\n 8   appear to eliminate any substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.\n\n 9   Indeed, in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court identified this accommodation as a\n\n10   way to alleviate a substantial burden on the religious exercise of for-profit\n\n11   corporations who enjoyed only the first two options. 134 S. Ct. at 2782. Yet\n\n12   Plaintiffs contend that the opposite is true. Plaintiffs believe that by submitting\n\n13   the opt-out notification to the government or their third-party administrators,\n\n14   they are indirectly facilitating the provision to their employees of products and\n\n15   services that have contraceptive and “abortion-inducing” effects, an act which\n\n16   violates their religious beliefs. Thus, although the accommodation shifts the\n\n17   burden of providing contraceptive coverage to others once Plaintiffs avail\n\n\n\n\n                                               22\n\f 1   themselves of the opt-out mechanism, Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that the\n\n 2   regulatory scheme imposes a substantial burden on their exercise of religion.\n\n 3          A. Substantiality is an Objective Inquiry\n\n 4          In analyzing the substantiality of a burden under RFRA, we employ an\n\n 5   objective test. RFRA plaintiffs must show that the government has imposed a\n\n 6   burden that is substantial, not simply one that they believe is substantial.\n\n 7          To be sure, the government concedes, and we do not doubt, the sincerity of\n\n 8   Plaintiffs’ belief that providing, paying for, or facilitating access to contraceptive\n\n 9   services is contrary to their faith. Nor do we doubt that, in Plaintiffs’ religious\n\n10   judgment, participation in the accommodation violates this belief. See Priests for\n\n11   Life, 772 F.3d at 247 (“Plaintiffs are correct that they – and not this Court –\n\n12   determine what religious observance their faith commands.”). However,\n\n13   “[a]ccepting the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ beliefs . . . does not relieve this Court of its\n\n14   responsibility to evaluate the substantiality of any burden on Plaintiffs’ religious\n\n15   exercise.” Id. Although a court accepts a litigant’s sincerely held religious beliefs,\n\n16   it must assess the nature of a claimed burden on religious exercise to determine\n\n17   whether, as an objective legal matter, that burden is “substantial” under RFRA.\n\n18   As other circuits have recognized, “[w]hether a law substantially burdens\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f 1   religious exercise under RFRA is a question of law for courts to decide, not a\n\n 2   question of fact.” Id.; see also Little Sisters of the Poor, 2015 WL 4232096, at *18–19;\n\n 3   E. Tex. Baptist Univ., 2015 WL 3852811, at *5; Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 442;\n\n 4   Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (“[a]ccepting as true the\n\n 5   factual allegations that [plaintiff’s] beliefs are sincere and of a religious nature –\n\n 6   but not the legal conclusion, cast as a factual allegation, that his religious exercise\n\n 7   is substantially burdened”).\n\n 8         Plaintiffs urge a contrary position, contending that when accepting a RFRA\n\n 9   plaintiff’s religious beliefs, a court must also accept the plaintiff’s assessment of\n\n10   the magnitude of any burden on their religious exercise. Yet this conclusion\n\n11   would “read out of RFRA the condition that only substantial burdens on the\n\n12   exercise of religion trigger the compelling interest requirement.” Henderson v.\n\n13   Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2001); see also Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167,\n\n14   174 (2001) (“It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a\n\n15   statute.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). If RFRA plaintiffs needed only to\n\n16   assert that their religious beliefs were substantially burdened, federal courts\n\n17   would be reduced to rubber stamps, and the government would have to defend\n\n18   innumerable actions under demanding strict scrutiny analysis. See Mahoney v.\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f 1   Doe, 642 F.3d 1112, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (concluding that judicial inquiry into the\n\n 2   substantiality of the burden “prevent[s] RFRA claims from being reduced into\n\n 3   questions of fact, proven by the credibility of the claimant”). As the D.C. Circuit\n\n 4   has recognized, this position would require us to “accept a RFRA claimant’s\n\n 5   understanding of what the challenged law requires her to do (or to refrain from\n\n 6   doing), even if that subjective understanding is at odds with what the law\n\n 7   actually requires.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 249; see also Univ. of Notre Dame, 786\n\n 8   F.3d at 621 (Hamilton, J., concurring) (“Notre Dame . . . contends, in effect, that\n\n 9   its religious belief can substitute for legal analysis regarding the operation of\n\n10   federal law.”). Rejecting this possibility, we conclude that the fact that a RFRA\n\n11   plaintiff considers a regulatory burden substantial does not make it a substantial\n\n12   burden. Were it otherwise, no burden would be insubstantial.\n\n13         Contrary to Plaintiffs’ suggestions, Hobby Lobby did not collapse the\n\n14   distinction between beliefs and substantial burden, such that the latter could be\n\n15   established simply through the sincerity of the former. It is true that the Supreme\n\n16   Court noted in Hobby Lobby that “it is not for us to say that [plaintiffs’] religious\n\n17   beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.” 134 S. Ct. at 2779. But that observation\n\n18   related to the significance of the particular belief for the religion – not to the\n\n\n                                                25\n\f 1   burden imposed by the governmental requirement. Consistent with a long\n\n 2   judicial tradition, Hobby Lobby declined to second-guess the rationality, or\n\n 3   demean the significance, of the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. See id. at 2778 (citing\n\n 4   cases). Whether the regulation objected to imposes a substantial burden is an\n\n 5   altogether different inquiry. Indeed, subsequent to Hobby Lobby, the Supreme\n\n 6   Court has reaffirmed the independence of the belief and burden inquiries. In Holt\n\n 7   v. Hobbs, the Court made clear that “[i]n addition to showing that the relevant\n\n 8   exercise of religion is grounded in a sincerely held religious belief, petitioner also\n\n 9   bore the burden of proving that the Department’s grooming policy substantially\n\n10   burdened that exercise of religion.” 135 S. Ct. 853, 862 (2015) (emphasis added).8\n\n11   Consequently, we cannot agree with Plaintiffs that Hobby Lobby erased RFRA’s\n\n12   substantial burden requirement by leaving the issue to be proven solely through\n\n13   a plaintiff’s affirmation of belief. RFRA does not speak of a burden which the\n\n14   affected person considers substantial. It requires a substantial burden, and\n\n15   assessing substantiality is a matter for a court.\n\n16\n\n\n\n           8\n           Holt was decided under RFRA’s companion statute, the Religious Land\n     Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq.\n\n                                                26\n\f 1         B. The Accommodation Imposes No Substantial Burden\n\n 2         Applying this objective analysis to the accommodation, we conclude that\n\n 3   Plaintiffs have failed to show a substantial burden. The regulatory\n\n 4   accommodation here operates in a straightforward fashion. In order to be\n\n 5   excused from the contraceptive coverage mandate, an eligible organization must\n\n 6   send a single sheet of paper communicating its eligibility and religious objection.\n\n 7   29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii). Once an eligible organization expresses its\n\n 8   desire to have no involvement in the provision of contraceptive coverage, the\n\n 9   government requires no further action of the organization. Instead, the\n\n10   regulations effectuate this separation by enlisting other entities to fill the gap. The\n\n11   regulations require or incentivize insurers and third-party administrators to\n\n12   directly offer separate coverage for contraceptive services to insured employees\n\n13   who want it, and to inform beneficiaries that their objecting employer has no role\n\n14   in facilitating this coverage. Id. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2), (d). In the process, eligible\n\n15   organizations are provided the opportunity to freely express their religious\n\n16   objection to such coverage as well as to extricate themselves from its provision.\n\n17   At the same time, insured individuals are not deprived of the benefits of\n\n18   contraceptive coverage.\n\n\n                                                27\n\f 1         Thus, under the challenged regulatory scheme, the only obligation actually\n\n 2   imposed on Plaintiffs is identifying themselves as religious objectors. Through a\n\n 3   modicum of paperwork, an eligible organization throws the entire administrative\n\n 4   and financial burden of providing contraceptive coverage on its insurer or third-\n\n 5   party administrator, generally organizations with no objection to providing\n\n 6   contraceptive coverage. Indeed, in discussing the opt-out mechanism in Hobby\n\n 7   Lobby, the Supreme Court explained that the accommodation “effectively\n\n 8   exempt[s]”eligible organizations from the contraceptive coverage mandate. 134 S.\n\n 9   Ct. at 2763.\n\n10         Assessing this obligation objectively, we cannot conclude that the simple\n\n11   act of completing the notification form imposes a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’\n\n12   religious exercise. Indeed, in past decisions favoring religious objectors, the\n\n13   burden imposed was considerably more substantial than the burden of\n\n14   notification at issue here. Pre-Smith First Amendment Free Exercise cases, which\n\n15   remain instructive in interpreting RFRA, see Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 244,\n\n16   involved much more significant effects on the lives of religious objectors. For\n\n17   example, in Sherbert, the plaintiff, a Seventh-day Adventist, was denied\n\n18   unemployment compensation after her employer discharged her because she\n\n\n                                               28\n\f 1   refused to work on Saturday, her religion’s day of rest. 374 U.S. at 399–401.\n\n 2   Similarly, in Yoder, the statute at issue required the Old Order Amish plaintiffs to\n\n 3   send their children to school until the age of sixteen, in violation of their religion.\n\n 4   406 U.S. at 207–08. In Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana Employment Security\n\n 5   Division, 450 U.S. 707, 709 (1981), a religious pacifist was denied unemployment\n\n 6   benefits after he quit his job following a transfer to a department where he was\n\n 7   required to work in the production of armaments. Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs are\n\n 8   not denied any similar government benefits, nor are they required to do anything\n\n 9   besides identify themselves as religious objectors via a one-page form.\n\n10         Cases finding a substantial burden under RFRA have similarly involved\n\n11   much more significant burdens on religious objectors. In Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d\n\n12   468, 476–77 (2d Cir. 1996), this Court found a substantial burden where the\n\n13   challenged regulations required the plaintiff, a Rastafarian prison inmate, to\n\n14   undergo a physically-invasive and religiously-objectionable medical screening –\n\n15   in essence, to suffer an invasion of his bodily integrity. In Gonzalez v. O Centro\n\n16   Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 425–26 (2006), a substantial\n\n17   burden existed where the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.,\n\n18   prevented the religious objector plaintiffs from ever again engaging in a\n\n\n                                               29\n\f 1   sacramental ritual. More recently, in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court found a\n\n 2   substantial burden where the contraceptive coverage mandate, in the absence of\n\n 3   any accommodation, required for-profit corporations to pay out of pocket for the\n\n 4   use of religiously-objectionable contraceptives by thousands of employees or pay\n\n 5   significant fines. 134 S. Ct. at 2775–79. And most recently, in Holt, a prison policy\n\n 6   requiring a Muslim prisoner to cut his beard throughout his period of\n\n 7   incarceration was found to substantially burden his religious beliefs. 135 S. Ct. at\n\n 8   862.\n\n 9          The burden imposed on Plaintiffs here stands in contrast to these previous\n\n10   cases. “Accurately understood, the opt-out mechanism imposes on Plaintiffs only\n\n11   the de minimis administrative burden associated with completing the self-\n\n12   certification form or the alternative notice.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 253.\n\n13   Viewed objectively, completing a form stating that one has a religious objection is\n\n14   not a substantial burden. To be sure, the notification required of Plaintiffs here\n\n15   certainly imposes some burden. But any imposition from completing the form\n\n16   falls well below the degree of substantial burdensomeness that has historically\n\n17   entitled a RFRA plaintiff (or pre-Smith free exercise plaintiff) to accommodation,\n\n18   or triggered strict scrutiny analysis. See Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678 (noting that\n\n\n                                                30\n\f 1   “[a]n inconsequential or de minimis burden on religious practice does not rise to\n\n 2   [the] level” of a substantial burden).\n\n 3         Indeed, the accommodation here involves the same de minimis burden of\n\n 4   notification historically required of religious objectors under statutory and\n\n 5   regulatory schemes such as the military draft and medical conscience clauses. See\n\n 6   Little Sisters of the Poor, 2015 WL 4232096, at *24 n.31 (“Many religious objection\n\n 7   schemes require an affirmative opt out before another person is required to step\n\n 8   in and assume responsibility . . . .”). As with other religious objectors, there must\n\n 9   be some method by which the government can be notified of the objection.\n\n10   Otherwise there is no way that the government can know which organizations it\n\n11   needs to accommodate. Here, the government has provided flexible, largely\n\n12   effortless, and essentially cost-free options for notification. Plaintiffs have\n\n13   provided us with no case law concluding that a similarly minimal administrative\n\n14   notification of religious objection constitutes a substantial burden.\n\n15         Nevertheless, urging the Court to look beyond the simplicity of the\n\n16   relevant notification forms, Plaintiffs raise two arguments. First, Plaintiffs\n\n17   contend that the burden of notification is substantial because the penalties for\n\n18   non-compliance with the notification requirement are significant. Second,\n\n\n                                               31\n\f 1   Plaintiffs argue that the consequences of notification – the downstream actions of\n\n 2   the government and third parties – transform completion of the relevant forms\n\n 3   into a substantial burden. For the reasons discussed below, we do not find either\n\n 4   argument persuasive.\n\n 5         1. Penalties for Non-Compliance\n\n 6         Plaintiffs first argue that the government imposes a substantial burden\n\n 7   whenever it puts a RFRA plaintiff to a choice between (a) taking action she finds\n\n 8   religiously objectionable, or (b) suffering substantial penalties. See Jolly, 76 F.3d at\n\n 9   477 (“[A] substantial burden exists where the state ‘put[s] substantial pressure on\n\n10   an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.’” (quoting Thomas,\n\n11   450 U.S. at 718) (second alteration in original)). Thus, because Plaintiffs would\n\n12   pay serious fines or be forced to provide their employees contraceptive coverage\n\n13   if they failed to utilize the opt-out mechanism, they claim a substantial burden\n\n14   exists here.\n\n15         Viewed in the context of our previous discussion, this argument is a non\n\n16   sequitur. An objectively insubstantial burden does not become substantial simply\n\n17   because a RFRA plaintiff faces substantial burdens in the alternative. Because\n\n18   Plaintiffs can comply with the notification requirement without suffering a\n\n\n                                                32\n\f 1   substantial burden, it makes no difference that they would incur significant\n\n 2   penalties for non-compliance.\n\n 3         For this reason, the cases cited by Plaintiffs are not applicable. As noted\n\n 4   previously, in Jolly the challenged regulations required a prisoner to suffer a\n\n 5   physical invasion of his bodily integrity. Id. at 476–77. In finding this invasion a\n\n 6   substantial burden, we further observed that the penalty for non-compliance\n\n 7   with this procedure was severe – “confinement to medical keeplock.” Id. at 477.\n\n 8   As we recognized, when the challenged action imposes a substantial burden, it is\n\n 9   obviously pertinent whether available alternatives also impose a substantial\n\n10   burden. However, this secondary analysis matters only if the challenged conduct\n\n11   is itself a substantial burden. Indeed, we emphasized that the severity of the\n\n12   sanction for non-compliance was not the gravamen of the substantial burden\n\n13   analysis. Id. (“[T]he district court need not have emphasized the extraordinary\n\n14   length of the plaintiff’s confinement to medical keeplock as an indicator of a\n\n15   substantial burden.”).\n\n16         The same logic explains the Supreme Court’s statement in Hobby Lobby that\n\n17   “[b]ecause the contraceptive mandate forces [plaintiffs] to pay an enormous sum\n\n18   of money – as much as $475 million per year in the case of Hobby Lobby – if they\n\n\n                                               33\n\f 1   insist on providing insurance coverage in accordance with their religious beliefs,\n\n 2   the mandate clearly imposes a substantial burden on those beliefs.” 134 S. Ct. at\n\n 3   2779. Unlike the regulatory scheme at issue here, the regulations challenged in\n\n 4   Hobby Lobby imposed a substantial burden, requiring the for-profit corporation\n\n 5   plaintiffs to pay out of pocket to insure thousands of individuals. Id. at 2775–78.\n\n 6   Given that the burden of compliance was objectively substantial, the Hobby Lobby\n\n 7   Court naturally also had to consider whether non-compliance with the\n\n 8   challenged regulations might result in only an insubstantial penalty. Because\n\n 9   these alternative penalties were also significant, the Hobby Lobby plaintiffs had no\n\n10   means of avoiding a substantial burden. By contrast, because completing the opt-\n\n11   out forms here imposes no substantial burden on Plaintiffs, the fact that they may\n\n12   arguably incur substantial burdens in the alternative is irrelevant.\n\n13         Similar issues undermine Plaintiffs’ citation to Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718.\n\n14   There, as noted, the government denied a religious pacifist unemployment\n\n15   benefits after he quit his job producing armaments. Id. at 709. Denial of these\n\n16   potentially life-saving unemployment benefits imposed an objectively substantial\n\n17   burden on the plaintiff’s religious exercise. Furthermore, Thomas lacked an\n\n18   alternative option for “not complying” with this loss of benefits. Although he\n\n\n                                              34\n\f 1   could have continued to work in violation of his religious beliefs, this would not\n\n 2   have avoided the loss of benefits, and, indeed, would have itself imposed a\n\n 3   substantial burden. Crucially, the regulatory scheme at issue did not offer the\n\n 4   objector an option that was free of a substantial burden.\n\n 5         In the context of the cases cited by Plaintiffs, it was thus pertinent that the\n\n 6   cost of non-compliance with the challenged regulation was also significant. When\n\n 7   doing what the governmental scheme requires is a substantial burden, then a\n\n 8   court must also consider whether any alternatives available to the plaintiff also\n\n 9   impose a substantial burden. Here, by contrast, what the governmental scheme\n\n10   actually requires of Plaintiffs – the filing of a form or letter of notification – is not\n\n11   a substantial burden. The fact that they may arguably incur substantial burdens if\n\n12   instead they unlawfully refuse to comply is therefore irrelevant.\n\n13         2. Effects of Compliance\n\n14         Plaintiffs further argue that the objectively insubstantial burden of filing\n\n15   either the opt-out form or the letter to HHS is substantial because it renders them\n\n16   complicit in bringing about consequences forbidden by their religion, namely the\n\n17   provision of contraceptive coverage by the government and third parties.\n\n18   Although third parties ultimately bear the burden of providing contraceptive\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f 1   coverage, Plaintiffs contend that their participation is essential to this coverage.\n\n 2   Plaintiffs argue that a substantial burden exists because the submission of the\n\n 3   self-certification form or letter “triggers” or “facilitates” the provision of\n\n 4   objectionable contraceptive services. Under this view, Plaintiffs’ acts of self-\n\n 5   certification as religious objectors ultimately result in their third-party\n\n 6   administrators providing contraceptive coverage to their employees.\n\n 7          Like the other circuits to have addressed similar RFRA claims, we are not\n\n 8   persuaded regarding the mechanics of Plaintiffs’ “trigger” argument. As other\n\n 9   courts have concluded, a religious objector’s submission of the form or letter does\n\n10   not, as a legal matter, trigger or facilitate the provision of contraceptive coverage.\n\n11   See, e.g., Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 437; Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 252–53. Rather,\n\n12   contraceptive coverage occurs through operation of federal law. When third\n\n13   parties step in and provide contraceptive coverage after Plaintiffs opt out, they\n\n14   do so not because Plaintiffs have opted out, but rather because federal law\n\n15   requires or incentivizes them to provide such coverage. The accommodation\n\n16   functions not as a “trigger,” but rather as a means of identifying and exempting\n\n17   those employers with religious objections. Once Plaintiffs indicate their desire to\n\n18   have no involvement in the provision of contraceptive coverage, the government\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f 1   steps in and acts to ensure contraceptive coverage without any participation by\n\n 2   Plaintiffs. Thus, Plaintiffs’ decision to opt out is not the cause of the ultimate\n\n 3   contraceptive coverage; rather this coverage happens in spite of them.\n\n 4         Yet even accepting Plaintiffs’ argument that their submission of the\n\n 5   notification form or letter indirectly results in the provision of contraceptive\n\n 6   coverage to their employees, there is still no substantial burden here. The\n\n 7   regulatory obligations imposed on third parties after Plaintiffs opt out do not\n\n 8   transform the de minimis act of notification into a substantial burden. Courts\n\n 9   have not found a substantial burden where a plaintiff argues that her religious\n\n10   exercise is violated by the government’s internal operations or, by extension, its\n\n11   decision to burden third parties, even where the plaintiff plays a precipitating\n\n12   role. “An asserted burden is . . . not an actionable substantial burden when it falls\n\n13   on a third party, not the religious adherent.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246.\n\n14         Most prominently, in Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 695–96 (1986), a Native\n\n15   American plaintiff argued that a statute requiring the government to use his\n\n16   daughter’s social security number to process his welfare benefit application\n\n17   violated the Free Exercise Clause. Plaintiff Roy believed that the government’s\n\n18   assignment of a social security number to his daughter would “‘rob the spirit’ of\n\n\n                                                37\n\f 1   his daughter and prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power.” Id. at 696.\n\n 2   The Supreme Court rejected Roy’s challenge to the government’s internal use of\n\n 3   his daughter’s social security number, concluding that, rather than complaining\n\n 4   about a government restriction on his own conduct, Roy sought to “dictate the\n\n 5   conduct of the Government’s internal procedures.” Id. at 700. Roy’s claim failed\n\n 6   in this respect because, even though assigning his daughter a social security\n\n 7   number in processing the benefit application offended his religious sensibilities,\n\n 8   it did not “itself in any degree impair Roy’s freedom to believe, express, and\n\n 9   exercise his religion.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court\n\n10   concluded that although “[t]he Free Exercise Clause affords an individual\n\n11   protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion[,] it does not afford\n\n12   an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government’s internal\n\n13   procedures.” Id. The Court declined to “interpret[] the First Amendment to\n\n14   require the Government itself to behave in ways that the individual believes will\n\n15   further his or her spiritual development.” Id. at 699 (emphasis in original).\n\n16   Rather, it concluded that the “[t]he Free Exercise Clause simply cannot be\n\n17   understood to require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways\n\n18   that comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.” Id.; see also Lyng v.\n\n\n                                                38\n\f 1   Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 450–51, 452 (1988)\n\n 2   (“[G]overnment simply could not operate if it were required to satisfy every\n\n 3   citizen’s religious needs and desires.”).\n\n 4         Similarly, in Kaemmerling, the D.C. Circuit concluded that a federal\n\n 5   prisoner could not establish a substantial burden under RFRA when he sought to\n\n 6   enjoin application of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act on the basis that\n\n 7   DNA sampling, storage, and collection without limitations violated his religious\n\n 8   beliefs about the proper use of the “building blocks of life.” 553 F.3d at 673–74,\n\n 9   680. The court found that the plaintiff’s religious exercise was not substantially\n\n10   burdened, because “[t]he extraction and storage of DNA information are entirely\n\n11   activities of the FBI, in which Kaemmerling plays no role and which occur after\n\n12   the BOP has taken his fluid or tissue sample (to which he does not object).” Id. at\n\n13   679. The D.C. Circuit thus concluded that “[l]ike the parents in Bowen,”\n\n14   Kaemmerling was attempting “to require the government itself to conduct its\n\n15   affairs in conformance with his religion.” Id. at 680.\n\n16         The same principles govern here. As with Roy’s completion of the welfare\n\n17   application or Kaemmerling’s provision of a tissue sample (to which he did not\n\n18   object), Plaintiffs’ act of notification results in downstream conduct they find\n\n\n                                                 39\n\f 1   religiously objectionable. But like Roy and Kaemmerling, whose conduct also\n\n 2   indirectly “triggered” government action they found religiously objectionable,\n\n 3   Plaintiffs cannot claim a substantial burden on the basis of this subsequent\n\n 4   conduct. “Religious objectors do not suffer substantial burdens under RFRA\n\n 5   where the only harm to them is that they sincerely feel aggrieved by their\n\n 6   inability to prevent what other people would do to fulfill regulatory objectives\n\n 7   after they opt out. They have no RFRA right to be free from the unease, or even\n\n 8   anguish, of knowing that third parties are legally privileged or obligated to act in\n\n 9   ways their religion abhors.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246 (citation omitted). The\n\n10   objectively insubstantial burden of filing the notification form or letter does not\n\n11   become a substantial burden because of the subsequent burdens imposed on\n\n12   third parties by the government.\n\n13         “Just as the Government may not insist that [Plaintiffs] engage in any set\n\n14   form of religious observance, so [Plaintiffs] may not demand that the\n\n15   Government join in their chosen religious practices by refraining from” working\n\n16   with third parties to provide their employees contraceptive coverage. Bowen, 476\n\n17   U.S. at 699–700. While we do not doubt the sincerity or rationality of Plaintiffs’\n\n18   beliefs, their legal argument would have the effect, if accepted, of enabling\n\n\n                                               40\n\f 1   religious objectors to impose the constraints of their beliefs on the rest of the\n\n 2   Nation. The Supreme Court made clear in Bowen that religious objectors do not\n\n 3   have this right, because burdens falling on third parties, and not the religious\n\n 4   objector, are not actionable.\n\n 5         Furthermore, the fact that the government imposes these separate legal\n\n 6   responsibilities on contractual counter-parties of eligible organizations does not\n\n 7   create a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. Cf. United States v. Lee,\n\n 8   455 U.S. 252, 261 (1982) (“When followers of a particular sect enter into\n\n 9   commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own\n\n10   conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the\n\n11   statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.”). Plaintiffs’\n\n12   relationships with their employees and third-party administrators do not provide\n\n13   them an avenue to dictate these entities’ independent interactions with the\n\n14   government, even if Plaintiffs find these actions objectionable. See Priests for Life,\n\n15   772 F.3d at 256 (“RFRA does not entitle Plaintiffs to control their employees’\n\n16   relationships with other entities willing to provide health insurance coverage to\n\n17   which the employees are legally entitled.”).9\n\n\n           9\n               In a related vein, Plaintiffs contended at oral argument that the\n\n                                                41\n\f 1          As other circuits have recognized, Plaintiffs’ argument “is analogous to a\n\n 2   religious conscientious objector to a military draft claiming that the act of\n\n 3   identifying himself as such on his Selective Service card constitutes a substantial\n\n 4   burden because that identification would then ‘trigger’ the draft of a fellow\n\n 5   selective service registrant in his place and thereby implicate the objector in\n\n 6   facilitating war.” Id. at 246; see also Little Sisters of the Poor, 2015 WL 4232096, at\n\n 7   *24 n.33; Univ. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 623 (Hamilton, J., concurring). The\n\n 8   government’s subsequent actions in drafting a replacement soldier surely do not\n\n 9   transform the conscientious objector’s completion of the opt-out form into a\n\n10   substantial burden, even if the conscientious objector finds these acts deplorable\n\n11   as a matter of faith. So too here, no substantial burden exists simply because the\n\n12   government ultimately works with third-party administrators to ensure the\n\n13   provision of contraceptive coverage once Plaintiffs opt out. Were it otherwise,\n\n14   Plaintiffs and the conscientious objector would enjoy a blanket religious veto\n\n\n     government’s offer of reimbursement in excess of costs to church plan third-party\n     administrators could eventually result in the disappearance of third-party\n     administrators who might refuse, at the request of eligible organizations, to\n     provide contraceptive coverage. Yet, the fact that a federal policy incentivizes\n     third parties to operate in a manner Plaintiffs find religiously objectionable is not\n     a cognizable burden under RFRA. Plaintiffs do not enjoy a religious objector veto\n     over the government’s interactions with their third-party administrators.\n\n                                                 42\n\f 1   over the government’s interactions with others. “Although [a] person may have a\n\n 2   religious objection to what the government, or another third party, does with\n\n 3   something that the law requires to be provided (whether it be a Social Security\n\n 4   number, DNA, or a form that states that the person religiously objects to\n\n 5   providing contraceptive coverage), RFRA does not necessarily permit that person\n\n 6   to impose a restraint on another’s action based on the claim that the action is\n\n 7   religiously abhorrent.” Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 441.\n\n 8         Indeed, accepting Plaintiffs’ argument would cast doubt on the\n\n 9   government’s ability to accommodate religious objectors in other spheres. The\n\n10   simple, non-burdensome act of requesting a religious exemption from a\n\n11   regulatory burden would nevertheless create a substantial burden on a religious\n\n12   objector so long as any resulting independent action by the government is also\n\n13   religiously objectionable. See Univ. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 621 (Hamilton, J.,\n\n14   concurring) (“From conscientious objector status in the military draft to federal\n\n15   and state tax codes, from compulsory school attendance laws to school lunch\n\n16   menus, from zoning law to employment law and even fish and wildlife rules, our\n\n17   governments at every level have long made room for religious faith by allowing\n\n18   exceptions from generally applicable laws.”); see also Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 439\n\n\n                                              43\n\f 1   n.14 (analogizing to exemptions for religious objector employees). “The\n\n 2   possibilities are endless, but we doubt Congress, in enacting RFRA, intended for\n\n 3   them to be.” E. Tex. Baptist Univ., 2015 WL 3852811, at *7.\n\n 4         Plaintiffs may certainly object to this subsequent action by the government\n\n 5   and third parties based on their sincere religious beliefs, and we reiterate that we\n\n 6   do not doubt the sincerity or rationality of Plaintiffs’ beliefs. But just because\n\n 7   Plaintiffs feel complicit in these third party actions does not mean that the\n\n 8   regulations impose a “burden” on their religious practice, much less a burden\n\n 9   that is “substantial” under RFRA. While a plaintiff’s “religious views may not\n\n10   accept [the] distinction between individual and governmental conduct,” the law\n\n11   does. Bowen, 476 U.S. at 701 n.6; see also Lyng, 485 U.S. at 451 (“Whatever may be\n\n12   the exact line between unconstitutional prohibitions on the free exercise of\n\n13   religion and the legitimate conduct by government of its own affairs, the location\n\n14   of the line cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a\n\n15   religious objector’s spiritual development.”). “Accepting the sincerity of\n\n16   Plaintiffs’ beliefs . . . does not relieve this Court of its responsibility to evaluate\n\n17   the substantiality of any burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise, and to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\f 1   distinguish Plaintiffs’ duties from obligations imposed, not on them, but on\n\n 2   insurers and TPAs.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 247.\n\n 3         Thus, consistent with Bowen and related cases, we must assess whether the\n\n 4   claimed burden falls on a plaintiff or a third party with no religious objection.\n\n 5   Here, the only burden that actually falls on Plaintiffs is the objectively\n\n 6   insubstantial requirement of completing the opt-out form or letter. When all the\n\n 7   government requires of a religious objector is the de minimis requirement of\n\n 8   notification for an exemption such that the burden may be shifted to another,\n\n 9   there is no substantial burden, even if the religious objector sincerely finds the\n\n10   ultimate actions taken by the government and third parties offensive. Even\n\n11   though Plaintiffs believe their role in the causal chain makes them complicit in\n\n12   the provision of contraceptives, this belief does not control the substantial burden\n\n13   inquiry. Just like the conscientious objector, whose decision to opt out indirectly\n\n14   facilitates the drafting of another, Plaintiffs are not substantially burdened by the\n\n15   ultimate actions of the government and third parties. If what Plaintiffs must do to\n\n16   exempt themselves from the contraceptive coverage mandate is not substantially\n\n17   burdensome, it makes no difference that Plaintiffs’ act of claiming exemption\n\n18   plays a functional role in the government’s achievement of the purposes to which\n\n\n                                               45\n\f 1   Plaintiffs object, or that they believe themselves to be substantially burdened for\n\n 2   that reason.\n\n 3                                      *      *     *\n\n 4         The burden that the accommodation places on Plaintiffs is merely one of\n\n 5   notification, equivalent to the burden historically placed on draft registrants to\n\n 6   indicate their conscientious objections to military service. Once Plaintiffs avail\n\n 7   themselves of the simple, non-burdensome means of opting out, the regulations\n\n 8   do not require them to play any role in the provision of contraceptive coverage or\n\n 9   to suffer punishments for not doing so. To the contrary, the accommodation\n\n10   relieves them of providing contraceptive coverage, and instead enlists third-party\n\n11   administrators to provide such coverage. If a regulatory scheme that might\n\n12   otherwise violate an objecting individual’s rights under RFRA allows the objector\n\n13   to exempt himself from compliance via a simple, non-burdensome act of\n\n14   notification, there is no substantial burden. Furthermore, subsequent regulation\n\n15   of non-objecting parties in a manner that an objecting party finds offensive does\n\n16   not transform the act of opting out into a cognizable substantial burden. The\n\n17   rights conferred by the First Amendment and RFRA do not include a right to\n\n\n\n\n                                              46\n\f1   have the government or third parties behave in a manner that comports with an\n\n2   individual’s religious beliefs.\n3\n4                                     CONCLUSION\n\n5         For the foregoing reasons, we reject Plaintiffs’ RFRA challenge to the\n\n6   contraceptive coverage mandate. The regulations at issue do not substantially\n\n7   burden Plaintiffs’ religious exercise in violation of RFRA. Accordingly, the\n\n8   judgment of the district court is reversed in relevant part.\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f",

The district\n\n27   court concluded that regulations promulgated under the Patient Protection and\n\n28   Affordable Care Act that allow religious non-profit employers to opt out of\n\n\n                                              3\n\f 1   providing contraceptive coverage themselves violate these religious employers’\n\n 2   rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. We reverse, concluding that\n\n 3   the challenged accommodation for religious objectors relieves, rather than\n\n 4   imposes, any substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise, and thus does\n\n 5   not violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\n 6                                   BACKGROUND\n\n 7         I. Statutory and Regulatory Background\n\n 8         This case concerns regulations promulgated under the Patient Protection\n\n 9   and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “ACA”), Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119.\n\n10   The ACA generally requires employers with fifty or more full-time employees to\n\n11   offer “a group health plan or group health insurance coverage” that provides\n\n12   “minimum essential coverage.” 26 U.S.C. § 5000A(f)(2); id. § 4980H(a)(1), (c)(2).\n\n13   Unless an exception applies, as part of this minimal essential coverage, the ACA\n\n14   requires an employer’s group health plan or group health insurance coverage to\n\n15   furnish “preventive care and screenings” for female employees without “any cost\n\n16   sharing requirements.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). Without “cost sharing\n\n17   requirements” means without requiring plan participants and beneficiaries to\n\n18   make copayments or pay deductibles or coinsurance. See 45 C.F.R. §\n\n\n                                              4\n\f 1   147.131(c)(2)(ii). An employer whose health plan does not include the required\n\n 2   coverage is subject to penalties of $100 per day, per affected beneficiary. 26 U.S.C.\n\n 3   § 4980D(b). An employer who drops employee health care coverage altogether is\n\n 4   generally subject to a penalty of $2000 per year, per employee, after the first thirty\n\n 5   employees. Id. § 4980H(a), (c)(1), (c)(2)(D)(i).\n\n 6         The ACA does not specify what types of preventive care must be covered\n\n 7   for female plan participants and beneficiaries. Instead, Congress left that issue to\n\n 8   be determined via regulation by the Health Resources and Services\n\n 9   Administration (“HRSA”), a division of the Department of Health and Human\n\n10   Services (“HHS”). 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). In developing guidelines for\n\n11   preventative health services for women, HRSA requested the assistance of the\n\n12   Institute of Medicine (“IOM”), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences\n\n13   established in 1970 to inform health policy with available scientific information.\n\n14   See Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of\n\n15   Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 77\n\n16   Fed.

U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\n17   Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238 (D.C. Cir. 2014).\n\n18         In August 2011, consistent with IOM’s recommendations, HRSA\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f 1   promulgated the Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, which generally\n\n 2   require non-exempt employers to provide “coverage, without cost sharing, for all\n\n 3   Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraceptive methods,\n\n 4   sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women\n\n 5   with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a [health care] provider.” 77 Fed.\n\n 6   Reg. at 8725 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). These\n\n 7   contraceptive coverage requirements were subsequently enacted by the three\n\n 8   agencies responsible for the ACA’s implementation – the Department of the\n\n 9   Treasury, the Department of Labor, and HHS. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n\n10   2713(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv). We\n\n11   refer to this required coverage as the “contraceptive coverage mandate.”\n\n12         The ACA and its implementing regulations create an exemption from the\n\n13   contraceptive coverage mandate for “religious employer[s],” a category that\n\n14   encompasses “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or\n\n15   associations of churches,” as well as “the exclusively religious activities of any\n\n16   religious order.” 26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a). The\n\n17   government created this exemption in response to concerns from religious\n\n18   groups objecting to the contraceptive coverage mandate.\n\n\n                                                6\n\f 1         In response to continued objections from religiously-affiliated\n\n 2   organizations that did not qualify for the “religious employer” exemption, the\n\n 3   government also crafted the so-called “accommodation,” which applies more\n\n 4   broadly to religious non-profit organizations that object to providing\n\n 5   contraceptive coverage. The accommodation was so named because it allows\n\n 6   religious employers to opt out of paying for objectionable medical services\n\n 7   without denying these services to employees who may or may not share the\n\n 8   religious beliefs of their employer. Under the applicable regulations, an\n\n 9   organization is eligible for this accommodation if it satisfies the following criteria:\n\n10         (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n11         contraceptive services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on\n12         account of religious objections.\n13\n14         (2) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity.\n15\n16         (3) The organization holds itself out as a religious organization.\n17\n18         (4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by\n19         the Secretary, that it satisfies the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through\n20         (3) of this section, and makes such self-certification available for\n21         examination upon request by the first day of the first plan year to\n22         which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this section applies. . . .\n23\n24   45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(a); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f 1   2713A(a). We refer to organizations that meet these criteria as “eligible\n\n 2   organizations.”2\n\n 3         By way of background, eligible organizations generally provide their\n\n 4   employees insurance in one of two ways. Employers are said to have an\n\n 5   “insured” plan if they contract with an insurance company for insurance – the\n\n 6   insurance company bears the financial risk of paying health insurance claims.\n\n 7   Other employers, like the Plaintiffs here, who bear the financial risk of paying\n\n 8   claims themselves, are said to have “self-insured” plans. Many self-insured\n\n 9   employers use insurance companies or other third parties to administer their\n\n10   plans, performing functions such as developing networks of providers,\n\n11   negotiating payment rates, and processing claims. In this context, the insurance\n\n12   company or other third party is called a “third-party administrator” or “TPA.”\n\n13   See generally Congressional Budget Office, Key Issues in Analyzing Major Health\n\n14   Insurance Proposals 6 (2008).\n\n\n\n\n           2\n             Revisions to these regulations extending the accommodation to closely\n     held for-profit entities with similar religious objections are scheduled to take\n     effect September 14, 2015. See Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\n     Affordable Care Act, 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318, 41,318, 41,323 (July 14, 2015).\n\n                                              8\n\f 1         Under the regulations, an eligible organization is not required “to contract,\n\n 2   arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage” to which it has religious\n\n 3   objections. Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care\n\n 4   Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,874 (July 2, 2013). To be relieved of these obligations,\n\n 5   an eligible organization has two options. First, it can complete a notification form\n\n 6   issued by the Department of Labor, indicating that it has a religious objection to\n\n 7   providing coverage for the required contraceptive services, and send a copy to its\n\n 8   insurance company or third-party administrator. See id. at 39,875; see also 29\n\n 9   C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(a)(4), (b)(1)(ii)(A), (c)(1)(i). This one-page self-\n\n10   certification form requires only the name of the organization, and the name, title,\n\n11   and contact information of the person signing it. See Department of Labor, EBSA\n\n12   Form 700, http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/preventiveserviceseligibleorganization\n\n13   certificationform.pdf.\n\n14         Second, an alternative notification option stems from the Supreme Court’s\n\n15   orders in Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, Denver, Colorado v. Sebelius, 134\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014), and Wheaton College v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). In both\n\n17   orders, the Supreme Court granted injunctions pending appeal to non-profits\n\n18   covered by the accommodation, providing that instead of self-certifying using the\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f 1   Department of Labor’s one-page form, they could instead send a letter to HHS\n\n 2   detailing their religious objections in their own words. HHS, in turn, would then\n\n 3   be responsible for informing the non-profits’ third-party administrators to begin\n\n 4   providing separate contraceptive coverage to the non-profits’ employees. In\n\n 5   August 2014, long after the district court’s judgment in this case, HHS issued new\n\n 6   interim final rules for non-profits that essentially codified these orders. See\n\n 7   Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 79 Fed.\n\n 8   Reg. 51,092, 51,092 (Aug. 27, 2014). These rules were finalized in July 2015. See\n\n 9   Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 80 Fed.\n\n10   Reg. 41,318, 41,323 (July 14, 2015). Under the new rules, an eligible organization\n\n11   can choose to either fill out the Department of Labor’s form and send it to its\n\n12   third-party administrator, or it can write to HHS directly using its own words or\n\n13   a sample letter provided by HHS. This notice to the government is not required\n\n14   to take a particular form, but must include information on the entity’s plan name\n\n15   and type, along with “the name and contact information for any of the plan’s\n\n16   third-party administrators and health insurance issuers.” 29 C.F.R. §\n\n17   2590.715–2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(1)(ii).\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f 1         Once an eligible organization chooses to take advantage of the\n\n 2   accommodation and notifies its third-party administrator or HHS by using one of\n\n 3   the methods specified by the regulations, the plan’s participants and beneficiaries\n\n 4   will generally still have access to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing\n\n 5   through alternative mechanisms established by government regulations. When\n\n 6   an eligible organization that chooses not to provide contraceptive coverage has a\n\n 7   “self-insured” plan like the Plaintiffs’ plans here, the regulations, depending on\n\n 8   the type of plan, either require or incentivize3 the third-party administrator to\n\n 9   provide or arrange its own separate payments for contraceptive services for plan\n\n10   participants and beneficiaries. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2). Importantly, the\n\n11   regulations require the third-party administrator to fully divorce the eligible\n\n12   organization from payments for contraceptive coverage. See id. § 2590.715-\n\n\n\n           3\n             When employers with self-insured plans offer insurance through what is\n     known as a “church plan,” the government lacks authority under the Employee\n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. (“ERISA”), to\n     regulate the third-party administrators that administer the plans. 29 U.S.C. §§\n     1002(33), 1003(b)(2). Thus, rather than requiring third-party administrators to\n     offer contraceptive coverage once an eligible organization opts out, the\n     regulations incentivize such coverage by providing reimbursement in excess of\n     costs for third-party administrators. See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(3); 45\n     C.F.R. § 156.50(d). Here, all of the Plaintiffs offer health coverage through self-\n     insured church plans.\n\n                                              11\n\f 1   2713A(b)(2)(i). The regulations bar the third-party administrator from imposing\n\n 2   any premium, fee or other charge, directly or indirectly, on the eligible\n\n 3   organization or the group health plan with respect to payments for contraceptive\n\n 4   services. See id. Instead, the third-party administrator may seek reimbursement\n\n 5   for payments for contraceptive services directly from the federal government. See\n\n 6   id. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(3); see also 45 C.F.R. § 156.50(d). Third-party\n\n 7   administrators are required to “segregate” accounting for contraceptive coverage\n\n 8   from the eligible organization’s plan excluding such coverage. 29 C.F.R. §\n\n 9   2590.715-2713A(c)(2)(ii).4\n\n10         In addition, an eligible organization that opts out of providing\n\n11   contraceptive coverage has no obligation to inform plan participants and\n\n\n\n           4\n              Similarly, when an eligible organization that chooses not to provide\n     coverage has an insured plan, the health insurance company that issues the\n     policy for that organization is required by regulation to provide separate\n     payments for contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries. See 45\n     C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2). The insurance issuer may not impose any premium, fee, or\n     other charge, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization or the group\n     health plan with respect to the issuer’s payments for contraceptive services. See\n     id. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii). The insurance issuer must “[e]xpressly exclude\n     contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in\n     connection with the . . . plan,” id. § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(A), and “segregate premium\n     revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide\n     payments for contraceptive services,” id. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii).\n\n                                               12\n\f 1   beneficiaries of the availability of these separate payments made by third parties.\n\n 2   Instead, the third-party administrator itself provides this notice, and does so\n\n 3   “separate from” materials that are distributed in connection with the eligible\n\n 4   organization’s group health coverage. Id. § 2590.715-2713A(d). Third-party\n\n 5   administrators bear the burden of contacting beneficiaries, and eligible\n\n 6   organizations are not required to provide these entities the names of their\n\n 7   beneficiaries or otherwise coordinate these notices. See id. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(4),\n\n 8   (c)(1)(i); Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 254 (noting that “[n]o regulation related to the\n\n 9   accommodation imposes any such duty on Plaintiffs”). Furthermore, the third-\n\n10   party administrator’s notice must make clear that the eligible organization is\n\n11   neither administering nor funding the contraceptive benefits, specifying that “the\n\n12   eligible organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but that\n\n13   the third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, provides separate payments\n\n14   for contraceptive services.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d).\n\n15         II. Factual Background and Procedural History\n\n16         The relevant plaintiffs on appeal are a group of religious non-profit\n\n17   organizations affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.5 Plaintiffs Cardinal\n\n\n           5\n               The plaintiffs below also included the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of\n\n                                                 13\n\f 1   Spellman High School and Monsignor Farrell High School are non-profit\n\n 2   Catholic high schools located in the Bronx and Staten Island, respectively. As\n\n 3   affiliated entities of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, Cardinal\n\n 4   Spellman and Monsignor Farrell offer health insurance to their employees under\n\n 5   the Archdiocese’s self-insured health plan, which is administered by United\n\n 6   Healthcare and CVS Caremark as third-party administrators. Plaintiff Catholic\n\n 7   Health Care System (also known as ArchCare) is a non-profit organization that\n\n 8   provides health coverage to more than 1000 employees and their dependents\n\n 9   under a self-insured plan administered by Emblem Health and CVS Caremark.\n\n10   Plaintiff Catholic Health Services of Long Island is a non-profit organization that\n\n11   provides health coverage to approximately 11,000 employees and their\n\n12   dependents under three self-insured plans administered by Empire BlueCross\n\n13   BlueShield and Express Scripts.\n\n14         While none of these entities qualify as “religious employers” under the\n\n15   exemption to the contraceptive coverage mandate, all of them are eligible for the\n\n\n     New York and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, New York – both\n     of whom are exempt from the contraceptive coverage mandate as religious\n     employers – as well as Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Rockville Centre. The\n     district court dismissed the claims of these plaintiffs and these decisions are not\n     challenged on appeal.\n\n                                              14\n\f 1   accommodation to the mandate. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs contend that the\n\n 2   contraceptive coverage mandate, including the accommodation, violates their\n\n 3   rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb\n\n 4   et seq. RFRA provides that the government “shall not substantially burden a\n\n 5   person’s exercise of religion” unless the application of that burden is the least\n\n 6   restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. 42 U.S.C. §\n\n 7   2000bb-1. As affiliates of the Catholic Church, Plaintiffs adhere to the Church’s\n\n 8   teachings that life begins at the moment of conception, and that “abortion-\n\n 9   inducing” products, contraception, and sterilization are immoral.6 Plaintiffs’\n\n10   beliefs forbid them from taking actions that would make them complicit in the\n\n11   delivery of these services, and thus they believe that they are prohibited from\n\n12   paying for, providing, or facilitating access to contraception. Plaintiffs argue that\n\n\n           6\n             Plaintiffs contend that some forms of contraception can induce an\n     abortion. While we do not doubt the sincerity of their beliefs, we note that the\n     contraceptive coverage mandate deals only with drugs that fall within the FDA’s\n     definition of “contraception,” not drugs which the FDA qualifies as “abortion-\n     inducing.” See 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725 (requiring coverage only for all “[FDA]\n     approved contraceptive methods” and “sterilization procedures” (alterations and\n     internal quotation marks omitted)). We recognize that Plaintiffs do not accept the\n     FDA’s proposition and argue that some of the covered methods are abortion-\n     inducing. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2681317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2681317/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, Plaintiffs contend that the ACA leaves\n\n 4   them with the choice of: (1) providing contraceptive coverage in violation of their\n\n 5   religious beliefs, (2) paying significant penalties for failing to provide the\n\n 6   required health coverage, or (3) utilizing an accommodation which also forces\n\n 7   them to violate their religious beliefs.\n\n 8         Plaintiffs brought suit in district court challenging the contraceptive\n\n 9   coverage mandate under RFRA and seeking an injunction barring its\n\n10   enforcement.7 On December 16, 2013, the district court granted Plaintiffs\n\n11   summary judgment on their RFRA claim and denied the government’s cross-\n\n12   motion for summary judgment as to this claim. The district court concluded that\n\n13   the accommodation placed a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion,\n\n14   and that the government failed to show that the accommodation was the least\n\n15   restrictive means to advance a compelling governmental interest. The district\n\n\n\n           7\n            Plaintiffs, along with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, the\n     Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, New York, and Catholic Charities of\n     the Diocese of Rockville Centre, also pressed other statutory and constitutional\n     claims not relevant here.\n\n                                                16\n\f 1   court enjoined enforcement of the contraceptive coverage mandate against\n\n 2   Plaintiffs and entered final judgment.\n\n 3          III. Parallel Proceedings\n\n 4          Plaintiffs’ challenge to the contraceptive coverage mandate is not unique.\n\n 5   Religious non-profit organizations throughout the country have brought similar\n\n 6   RFRA challenges. In the time since the district court issued its opinion, six\n\n 7   circuits have rejected these claims, either on the merits or by denial of a\n\n 8   preliminary injunction.

Substantial Burden\n\n12         At the threshold, RFRA requires us to assess whether Plaintiffs have shown\n\n13   a substantial burden on their exercise of religion. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 533\n\n14   (noting that the burden on this issue lies with the religious objector). “[I]f the\n\n15   law’s requirements do not amount to a substantial burden under RFRA, that is\n\n16   the end of the matter.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 244.\n\n17         Here, Plaintiffs argue that the ACA’s contraceptive mandate, including the\n\n18   accommodation, constitutes a substantial burden on their religious exercise by\n\n\n                                                21\n\f 1   forcing them to choose among three unacceptable options: (1) provide\n\n 2   contraceptive coverage, (2) pay the fines and penalties associated with failure to\n\n 3   provide contraceptive coverage, or (3) opt out of the contraceptive coverage\n\n 4   mandate via the accommodation, using either method of self-certification.\n\n 5         On its face, the final option, designed by the government to (a) extricate\n\n 6   employers with religious objections from the provision of contraceptive coverage,\n\n 7   and (b) place the burden for such coverage on third-party administrators, would\n\n 8   appear to eliminate any substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.\n\n 9   Indeed, in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court identified this accommodation as a\n\n10   way to alleviate a substantial burden on the religious exercise of for-profit\n\n11   corporations who enjoyed only the first two options. 134 S. Ct. at 2782. Yet\n\n12   Plaintiffs contend that the opposite is true. Plaintiffs believe that by submitting\n\n13   the opt-out notification to the government or their third-party administrators,\n\n14   they are indirectly facilitating the provision to their employees of products and\n\n15   services that have contraceptive and “abortion-inducing” effects, an act which\n\n16   violates their religious beliefs. Thus, although the accommodation shifts the\n\n17   burden of providing contraceptive coverage to others once Plaintiffs avail\n\n\n\n\n                                               22\n\f 1   themselves of the opt-out mechanism, Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that the\n\n 2   regulatory scheme imposes a substantial burden on their exercise of religion.\n\n 3          A. Substantiality is an Objective Inquiry\n\n 4          In analyzing the substantiality of a burden under RFRA, we employ an\n\n 5   objective test. RFRA plaintiffs must show that the government has imposed a\n\n 6   burden that is substantial, not simply one that they believe is substantial.\n\n 7          To be sure, the government concedes, and we do not doubt, the sincerity of\n\n 8   Plaintiffs’ belief that providing, paying for, or facilitating access to contraceptive\n\n 9   services is contrary to their faith. Nor do we doubt that, in Plaintiffs’ religious\n\n10   judgment, participation in the accommodation violates this belief. See Priests for\n\n11   Life, 772 F.3d at 247 (“Plaintiffs are correct that they – and not this Court –\n\n12   determine what religious observance their faith commands.”). However,\n\n13   “[a]ccepting the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ beliefs . . . does not relieve this Court of its\n\n14   responsibility to evaluate the substantiality of any burden on Plaintiffs’ religious\n\n15   exercise.” Id. Although a court accepts a litigant’s sincerely held religious beliefs,\n\n16   it must assess the nature of a claimed burden on religious exercise to determine\n\n17   whether, as an objective legal matter, that burden is “substantial” under RFRA.\n\n18   As other circuits have recognized, “[w]hether a law substantially burdens\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f 1   religious exercise under RFRA is a question of law for courts to decide, not a\n\n 2   question of fact.” Id.; see also Little Sisters of the Poor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4232096</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *18–19;\n\n 3   E.

Cir. 2011) (concluding that judicial inquiry into the\n\n 2   substantiality of the burden “prevent[s] RFRA claims from being reduced into\n\n 3   questions of fact, proven by the credibility of the claimant”). As the D.C. Circuit\n\n 4   has recognized, this position would require us to “accept a RFRA claimant’s\n\n 5   understanding of what the challenged law requires her to do (or to refrain from\n\n 6   doing), even if that subjective understanding is at odds with what the law\n\n 7   actually requires.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 249; see also Univ. of Notre Dame, 786\n\n 8   F.3d at 621 (Hamilton, J., concurring) (“Notre Dame . . . contends, in effect, that\n\n 9   its religious belief can substitute for legal analysis regarding the operation of\n\n10   federal law.”). Rejecting this possibility, we conclude that the fact that a RFRA\n\n11   plaintiff considers a regulatory burden substantial does not make it a substantial\n\n12   burden. Were it otherwise, no burden would be insubstantial.\n\n13         Contrary to Plaintiffs’ suggestions, Hobby Lobby did not collapse the\n\n14   distinction between beliefs and substantial burden, such that the latter could be\n\n15   established simply through the sincerity of the former. It is true that the Supreme\n\n16   Court noted in Hobby Lobby that “it is not for us to say that [plaintiffs’] religious\n\n17   beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.” 134 S. Ct. at 2779. But that observation\n\n18   related to the significance of the particular belief for the religion – not to the\n\n\n                                                25\n\f 1   burden imposed by the governmental requirement. Consistent with a long\n\n 2   judicial tradition, Hobby Lobby declined to second-guess the rationality, or\n\n 3   demean the significance, of the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs. See id. at 2778 (citing\n\n 4   cases). Whether the regulation objected to imposes a substantial burden is an\n\n 5   altogether different inquiry. Indeed, subsequent to Hobby Lobby, the Supreme\n\n 6   Court has reaffirmed the independence of the belief and burden inquiries. In Holt\n\n 7   v. Hobbs, the Court made clear that “[i]n addition to showing that the relevant\n\n 8   exercise of religion is grounded in a sincerely held religious belief, petitioner also\n\n 9   bore the burden of proving that the Department’s grooming policy substantially\n\n10   burdened that exercise of religion.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2771249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2771249/holt-v-hobbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (2015) (emphasis added).8\n\n11   Consequently, we cannot agree with Plaintiffs that Hobby Lobby erased RFRA’s\n\n12   substantial burden requirement by leaving the issue to be proven solely through\n\n13   a plaintiff’s affirmation of belief. RFRA does not speak of a burden which the\n\n14   affected person considers substantial. It requires a substantial burden, and\n\n15   assessing substantiality is a matter for a court.\n\n16\n\n\n\n           8\n           Holt was decided under RFRA’s companion statute, the Religious Land\n     Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq.\n\n                                                26\n\f 1         B. The Accommodation Imposes No Substantial Burden\n\n 2         Applying this objective analysis to the accommodation, we conclude that\n\n 3   Plaintiffs have failed to show a substantial burden. The regulatory\n\n 4   accommodation here operates in a straightforward fashion. In order to be\n\n 5   excused from the contraceptive coverage mandate, an eligible organization must\n\n 6   send a single sheet of paper communicating its eligibility and religious objection.\n\n 7   29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii). Once an eligible organization expresses its\n\n 8   desire to have no involvement in the provision of contraceptive coverage, the\n\n 9   government requires no further action of the organization. Instead, the\n\n10   regulations effectuate this separation by enlisting other entities to fill the gap. The\n\n11   regulations require or incentivize insurers and third-party administrators to\n\n12   directly offer separate coverage for contraceptive services to insured employees\n\n13   who want it, and to inform beneficiaries that their objecting employer has no role\n\n14   in facilitating this coverage. Id. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2), (d). In the process, eligible\n\n15   organizations are provided the opportunity to freely express their religious\n\n16   objection to such coverage as well as to extricate themselves from its provision.\n\n17   At the same time, insured individuals are not deprived of the benefits of\n\n18   contraceptive coverage.\n\n\n                                                27\n\f 1         Thus, under the challenged regulatory scheme, the only obligation actually\n\n 2   imposed on Plaintiffs is identifying themselves as religious objectors. Through a\n\n 3   modicum of paperwork, an eligible organization throws the entire administrative\n\n 4   and financial burden of providing contraceptive coverage on its insurer or third-\n\n 5   party administrator, generally organizations with no objection to providing\n\n 6   contraceptive coverage. Indeed, in discussing the opt-out mechanism in Hobby\n\n 7   Lobby, the Supreme Court explained that the accommodation “effectively\n\n 8   exempt[s]”eligible organizations from the contraceptive coverage mandate. 134 S.\n\n 9   Ct. at 2763.\n\n10         Assessing this obligation objectively, we cannot conclude that the simple\n\n11   act of completing the notification form imposes a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’\n\n12   religious exercise. Indeed, in past decisions favoring religious objectors, the\n\n13   burden imposed was considerably more substantial than the burden of\n\n14   notification at issue here. Pre-Smith First Amendment Free Exercise cases, which\n\n15   remain instructive in interpreting RFRA, see Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 244,\n\n16   involved much more significant effects on the lives of religious objectors. For\n\n17   example, in Sherbert, the plaintiff, a Seventh-day Adventist, was denied\n\n18   unemployment compensation after her employer discharged her because she\n\n\n                                               28\n\f 1   refused to work on Saturday, her religion’s day of rest. 374 U.S. at 399–401.\n\n 2   Similarly, in Yoder, the statute at issue required the Old Order Amish plaintiffs to\n\n 3   send their children to school until the age of sixteen, in violation of their religion.\n\n 4   406 U.S. at 207–08.

Review Board of Indiana Employment Security\n\n 5   Division, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110440\"><a href=\"/opinion/110440/thomas-v-review-bd-of-indiana-employment-security-div/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 709 (1981), a religious pacifist was denied unemployment\n\n 6   benefits after he quit his job following a transfer to a department where he was\n\n 7   required to work in the production of armaments. Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs are\n\n 8   not denied any similar government benefits, nor are they required to do anything\n\n 9   besides identify themselves as religious objectors via a one-page form.\n\n10         Cases finding a substantial burden under RFRA have similarly involved\n\n11   much more significant burdens on religious objectors.

In Gonzalez v. O Centro\n\n16   Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145684\"><a href=\"/opinion/145684/gonzales-v-o-centro-espirita-beneficente-uniao-do-vegetal/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425–26 (2006), a substantial\n\n17   burden existed where the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.,\n\n18   prevented the religious objector plaintiffs from ever again engaging in a\n\n\n                                               29\n\f 1   sacramental ritual. More recently, in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court found a\n\n 2   substantial burden where the contraceptive coverage mandate, in the absence of\n\n 3   any accommodation, required for-profit corporations to pay out of pocket for the\n\n 4   use of religiously-objectionable contraceptives by thousands of employees or pay\n\n 5   significant fines. 134 S. Ct. at 2775–79. And most recently, in Holt, a prison policy\n\n 6   requiring a Muslim prisoner to cut his beard throughout his period of\n\n 7   incarceration was found to substantially burden his religious beliefs. 135 S. Ct. at\n\n 8   862.\n\n 9          The burden imposed on Plaintiffs here stands in contrast to these previous\n\n10   cases. “Accurately understood, the opt-out mechanism imposes on Plaintiffs only\n\n11   the de minimis administrative burden associated with completing the self-\n\n12   certification form or the alternative notice.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 253.\n\n13   Viewed objectively, completing a form stating that one has a religious objection is\n\n14   not a substantial burden. To be sure, the notification required of Plaintiffs here\n\n15   certainly imposes some burden. But any imposition from completing the form\n\n16   falls well below the degree of substantial burdensomeness that has historically\n\n17   entitled a RFRA plaintiff (or pre-Smith free exercise plaintiff) to accommodation,\n\n18   or triggered strict scrutiny analysis. See Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678 (noting that\n\n\n                                                30\n\f 1   “[a]n inconsequential or de minimis burden on religious practice does not rise to\n\n 2   [the] level” of a substantial burden).\n\n 3         Indeed, the accommodation here involves the same de minimis burden of\n\n 4   notification historically required of religious objectors under statutory and\n\n 5   regulatory schemes such as the military draft and medical conscience clauses. See\n\n 6   Little Sisters of the Poor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4232096</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *24 n.31 (“Many religious objection\n\n 7   schemes require an affirmative opt out before another person is required to step\n\n 8   in and assume responsibility . . . .”). As with other religious objectors, there must\n\n 9   be some method by which the government can be notified of the objection.\n\n10   Otherwise there is no way that the government can know which organizations it\n\n11   needs to accommodate. Here, the government has provided flexible, largely\n\n12   effortless, and essentially cost-free options for notification. Plaintiffs have\n\n13   provided us with no case law concluding that a similarly minimal administrative\n\n14   notification of religious objection constitutes a substantial burden.\n\n15         Nevertheless, urging the Court to look beyond the simplicity of the\n\n16   relevant notification forms, Plaintiffs raise two arguments. First, Plaintiffs\n\n17   contend that the burden of notification is substantial because the penalties for\n\n18   non-compliance with the notification requirement are significant. Second,\n\n\n                                               31\n\f 1   Plaintiffs argue that the consequences of notification – the downstream actions of\n\n 2   the government and third parties – transform completion of the relevant forms\n\n 3   into a substantial burden. For the reasons discussed below, we do not find either\n\n 4   argument persuasive.\n\n 5         1. Penalties for Non-Compliance\n\n 6         Plaintiffs first argue that the government imposes a substantial burden\n\n 7   whenever it puts a RFRA plaintiff to a choice between (a) taking action she finds\n\n 8   religiously objectionable, or (b) suffering substantial penalties. See Jolly, 76 F.3d at\n\n 9   477 (“[A] substantial burden exists where the state ‘put[s] substantial pressure on\n\n10   an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.’” (quoting Thomas,\n\n11   450 U.S. at 718) (second alteration in original)). Thus, because Plaintiffs would\n\n12   pay serious fines or be forced to provide their employees contraceptive coverage\n\n13   if they failed to utilize the opt-out mechanism, they claim a substantial burden\n\n14   exists here.\n\n15         Viewed in the context of our previous discussion, this argument is a non\n\n16   sequitur. An objectively insubstantial burden does not become substantial simply\n\n17   because a RFRA plaintiff faces substantial burdens in the alternative. Because\n\n18   Plaintiffs can comply with the notification requirement without suffering a\n\n\n                                                32\n\f 1   substantial burden, it makes no difference that they would incur significant\n\n 2   penalties for non-compliance.\n\n 3         For this reason, the cases cited by Plaintiffs are not applicable. As noted\n\n 4   previously, in Jolly the challenged regulations required a prisoner to suffer a\n\n 5   physical invasion of his bodily integrity. Id. at 476–77. In finding this invasion a\n\n 6   substantial burden, we further observed that the penalty for non-compliance\n\n 7   with this procedure was severe – “confinement to medical keeplock.” Id. at 477.\n\n 8   As we recognized, when the challenged action imposes a substantial burden, it is\n\n 9   obviously pertinent whether available alternatives also impose a substantial\n\n10   burden. However, this secondary analysis matters only if the challenged conduct\n\n11   is itself a substantial burden. Indeed, we emphasized that the severity of the\n\n12   sanction for non-compliance was not the gravamen of the substantial burden\n\n13   analysis. Id. (“[T]he district court need not have emphasized the extraordinary\n\n14   length of the plaintiff’s confinement to medical keeplock as an indicator of a\n\n15   substantial burden.”).\n\n16         The same logic explains the Supreme Court’s statement in Hobby Lobby that\n\n17   “[b]ecause the contraceptive mandate forces [plaintiffs] to pay an enormous sum\n\n18   of money – as much as $475 million per year in the case of Hobby Lobby – if they\n\n\n                                               33\n\f 1   insist on providing insurance coverage in accordance with their religious beliefs,\n\n 2   the mandate clearly imposes a substantial burden on those beliefs.” 134 S. Ct. at\n\n 3   2779. Unlike the regulatory scheme at issue here, the regulations challenged in\n\n 4   Hobby Lobby imposed a substantial burden, requiring the for-profit corporation\n\n 5   plaintiffs to pay out of pocket to insure thousands of individuals. Id. at 2775–78.\n\n 6   Given that the burden of compliance was objectively substantial, the Hobby Lobby\n\n 7   Court naturally also had to consider whether non-compliance with the\n\n 8   challenged regulations might result in only an insubstantial penalty. Because\n\n 9   these alternative penalties were also significant, the Hobby Lobby plaintiffs had no\n\n10   means of avoiding a substantial burden. By contrast, because completing the opt-\n\n11   out forms here imposes no substantial burden on Plaintiffs, the fact that they may\n\n12   arguably incur substantial burdens in the alternative is irrelevant.\n\n13         Similar issues undermine Plaintiffs’ citation to Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718.\n\n14   There, as noted, the government denied a religious pacifist unemployment\n\n15   benefits after he quit his job producing armaments. Id. at 709. Denial of these\n\n16   potentially life-saving unemployment benefits imposed an objectively substantial\n\n17   burden on the plaintiff’s religious exercise. Furthermore, Thomas lacked an\n\n18   alternative option for “not complying” with this loss of benefits. Although he\n\n\n                                              34\n\f 1   could have continued to work in violation of his religious beliefs, this would not\n\n 2   have avoided the loss of benefits, and, indeed, would have itself imposed a\n\n 3   substantial burden. Crucially, the regulatory scheme at issue did not offer the\n\n 4   objector an option that was free of a substantial burden.\n\n 5         In the context of the cases cited by Plaintiffs, it was thus pertinent that the\n\n 6   cost of non-compliance with the challenged regulation was also significant. When\n\n 7   doing what the governmental scheme requires is a substantial burden, then a\n\n 8   court must also consider whether any alternatives available to the plaintiff also\n\n 9   impose a substantial burden. Here, by contrast, what the governmental scheme\n\n10   actually requires of Plaintiffs – the filing of a form or letter of notification – is not\n\n11   a substantial burden. The fact that they may arguably incur substantial burdens if\n\n12   instead they unlawfully refuse to comply is therefore irrelevant.\n\n13         2. Effects of Compliance\n\n14         Plaintiffs further argue that the objectively insubstantial burden of filing\n\n15   either the opt-out form or the letter to HHS is substantial because it renders them\n\n16   complicit in bringing about consequences forbidden by their religion, namely the\n\n17   provision of contraceptive coverage by the government and third parties.\n\n18   Although third parties ultimately bear the burden of providing contraceptive\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f 1   coverage, Plaintiffs contend that their participation is essential to this coverage.\n\n 2   Plaintiffs argue that a substantial burden exists because the submission of the\n\n 3   self-certification form or letter “triggers” or “facilitates” the provision of\n\n 4   objectionable contraceptive services. Under this view, Plaintiffs’ acts of self-\n\n 5   certification as religious objectors ultimately result in their third-party\n\n 6   administrators providing contraceptive coverage to their employees.\n\n 7          Like the other circuits to have addressed similar RFRA claims, we are not\n\n 8   persuaded regarding the mechanics of Plaintiffs’ “trigger” argument. As other\n\n 9   courts have concluded, a religious objector’s submission of the form or letter does\n\n10   not, as a legal matter, trigger or facilitate the provision of contraceptive coverage.\n\n11   See, e.g., Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 437; Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 252–53. Rather,\n\n12   contraceptive coverage occurs through operation of federal law. When third\n\n13   parties step in and provide contraceptive coverage after Plaintiffs opt out, they\n\n14   do so not because Plaintiffs have opted out, but rather because federal law\n\n15   requires or incentivizes them to provide such coverage. The accommodation\n\n16   functions not as a “trigger,” but rather as a means of identifying and exempting\n\n17   those employers with religious objections. Once Plaintiffs indicate their desire to\n\n18   have no involvement in the provision of contraceptive coverage, the government\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f 1   steps in and acts to ensure contraceptive coverage without any participation by\n\n 2   Plaintiffs. Thus, Plaintiffs’ decision to opt out is not the cause of the ultimate\n\n 3   contraceptive coverage; rather this coverage happens in spite of them.\n\n 4         Yet even accepting Plaintiffs’ argument that their submission of the\n\n 5   notification form or letter indirectly results in the provision of contraceptive\n\n 6   coverage to their employees, there is still no substantial burden here. The\n\n 7   regulatory obligations imposed on third parties after Plaintiffs opt out do not\n\n 8   transform the de minimis act of notification into a substantial burden. Courts\n\n 9   have not found a substantial burden where a plaintiff argues that her religious\n\n10   exercise is violated by the government’s internal operations or, by extension, its\n\n11   decision to burden third parties, even where the plaintiff plays a precipitating\n\n12   role. “An asserted burden is . . . not an actionable substantial burden when it falls\n\n13   on a third party, not the religious adherent.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246.\n\n14         Most prominently, in Bowen v. Roy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111688\"><a href=\"/opinion/111688/bowen-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 695–96 (1986), a Native\n\n15   American plaintiff argued that a statute requiring the government to use his\n\n16   daughter’s social security number to process his welfare benefit application\n\n17   violated the Free Exercise Clause. Plaintiff Roy believed that the government’s\n\n18   assignment of a social security number to his daughter would “‘rob the spirit’ of\n\n\n                                                37\n\f 1   his daughter and prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power.” Id. at 696.\n\n 2   The Supreme Court rejected Roy’s challenge to the government’s internal use of\n\n 3   his daughter’s social security number, concluding that, rather than complaining\n\n 4   about a government restriction on his own conduct, Roy sought to “dictate the\n\n 5   conduct of the Government’s internal procedures.” Id. at 700. Roy’s claim failed\n\n 6   in this respect because, even though assigning his daughter a social security\n\n 7   number in processing the benefit application offended his religious sensibilities,\n\n 8   it did not “itself in any degree impair Roy’s freedom to believe, express, and\n\n 9   exercise his religion.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court\n\n10   concluded that although “[t]he Free Exercise Clause affords an individual\n\n11   protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion[,] it does not afford\n\n12   an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government’s internal\n\n13   procedures.” Id. The Court declined to “interpret[] the First Amendment to\n\n14   require the Government itself to behave in ways that the individual believes will\n\n15   further his or her spiritual development.” Id. at 699 (emphasis in original).\n\n16   Rather, it concluded that the “[t]he Free Exercise Clause simply cannot be\n\n17   understood to require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways\n\n18   that comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.” Id.; see also Lyng v.\n\n\n                                                38\n\f 1   Nw.

Circuit concluded that a federal\n\n 5   prisoner could not establish a substantial burden under RFRA when he sought to\n\n 6   enjoin application of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act on the basis that\n\n 7   DNA sampling, storage, and collection without limitations violated his religious\n\n 8   beliefs about the proper use of the “building blocks of life.” 553 F.3d at 673–74,\n\n 9   680. The court found that the plaintiff’s religious exercise was not substantially\n\n10   burdened, because “[t]he extraction and storage of DNA information are entirely\n\n11   activities of the FBI, in which Kaemmerling plays no role and which occur after\n\n12   the BOP has taken his fluid or tissue sample (to which he does not object).” Id. at\n\n13   679. The D.C. Circuit thus concluded that “[l]ike the parents in Bowen,”\n\n14   Kaemmerling was attempting “to require the government itself to conduct its\n\n15   affairs in conformance with his religion.” Id. at 680.\n\n16         The same principles govern here. As with Roy’s completion of the welfare\n\n17   application or Kaemmerling’s provision of a tissue sample (to which he did not\n\n18   object), Plaintiffs’ act of notification results in downstream conduct they find\n\n\n                                                 39\n\f 1   religiously objectionable. But like Roy and Kaemmerling, whose conduct also\n\n 2   indirectly “triggered” government action they found religiously objectionable,\n\n 3   Plaintiffs cannot claim a substantial burden on the basis of this subsequent\n\n 4   conduct. “Religious objectors do not suffer substantial burdens under RFRA\n\n 5   where the only harm to them is that they sincerely feel aggrieved by their\n\n 6   inability to prevent what other people would do to fulfill regulatory objectives\n\n 7   after they opt out. They have no RFRA right to be free from the unease, or even\n\n 8   anguish, of knowing that third parties are legally privileged or obligated to act in\n\n 9   ways their religion abhors.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 246 (citation omitted). The\n\n10   objectively insubstantial burden of filing the notification form or letter does not\n\n11   become a substantial burden because of the subsequent burdens imposed on\n\n12   third parties by the government.\n\n13         “Just as the Government may not insist that [Plaintiffs] engage in any set\n\n14   form of religious observance, so [Plaintiffs] may not demand that the\n\n15   Government join in their chosen religious practices by refraining from” working\n\n16   with third parties to provide their employees contraceptive coverage. Bowen, 476\n\n17   U.S. at 699–700. While we do not doubt the sincerity or rationality of Plaintiffs’\n\n18   beliefs, their legal argument would have the effect, if accepted, of enabling\n\n\n                                               40\n\f 1   religious objectors to impose the constraints of their beliefs on the rest of the\n\n 2   Nation. The Supreme Court made clear in Bowen that religious objectors do not\n\n 3   have this right, because burdens falling on third parties, and not the religious\n\n 4   objector, are not actionable.\n\n 5         Furthermore, the fact that the government imposes these separate legal\n\n 6   responsibilities on contractual counter-parties of eligible organizations does not\n\n 7   create a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise.

Lee,\n\n 8   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110647\"><a href=\"/opinion/110647/united-states-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (1982) (“When followers of a particular sect enter into\n\n 9   commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own\n\n10   conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the\n\n11   statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.”). Plaintiffs’\n\n12   relationships with their employees and third-party administrators do not provide\n\n13   them an avenue to dictate these entities’ independent interactions with the\n\n14   government, even if Plaintiffs find these actions objectionable. See Priests for Life,\n\n15   772 F.3d at 256 (“RFRA does not entitle Plaintiffs to control their employees’\n\n16   relationships with other entities willing to provide health insurance coverage to\n\n17   which the employees are legally entitled.”).9\n\n\n           9\n               In a related vein, Plaintiffs contended at oral argument that the\n\n                                                41\n\f 1          As other circuits have recognized, Plaintiffs’ argument “is analogous to a\n\n 2   religious conscientious objector to a military draft claiming that the act of\n\n 3   identifying himself as such on his Selective Service card constitutes a substantial\n\n 4   burden because that identification would then ‘trigger’ the draft of a fellow\n\n 5   selective service registrant in his place and thereby implicate the objector in\n\n 6   facilitating war.” Id. at 246; see also Little Sisters of the Poor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4232096</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n 7   *24 n.33; Univ. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 623 (Hamilton, J., concurring). The\n\n 8   government’s subsequent actions in drafting a replacement soldier surely do not\n\n 9   transform the conscientious objector’s completion of the opt-out form into a\n\n10   substantial burden, even if the conscientious objector finds these acts deplorable\n\n11   as a matter of faith. So too here, no substantial burden exists simply because the\n\n12   government ultimately works with third-party administrators to ensure the\n\n13   provision of contraceptive coverage once Plaintiffs opt out. Were it otherwise,\n\n14   Plaintiffs and the conscientious objector would enjoy a blanket religious veto\n\n\n     government’s offer of reimbursement in excess of costs to church plan third-party\n     administrators could eventually result in the disappearance of third-party\n     administrators who might refuse, at the request of eligible organizations, to\n     provide contraceptive coverage. Yet, the fact that a federal policy incentivizes\n     third parties to operate in a manner Plaintiffs find religiously objectionable is not\n     a cognizable burden under RFRA. Plaintiffs do not enjoy a religious objector veto\n     over the government’s interactions with their third-party administrators.\n\n                                                 42\n\f 1   over the government’s interactions with others. “Although [a] person may have a\n\n 2   religious objection to what the government, or another third party, does with\n\n 3   something that the law requires to be provided (whether it be a Social Security\n\n 4   number, DNA, or a form that states that the person religiously objects to\n\n 5   providing contraceptive coverage), RFRA does not necessarily permit that person\n\n 6   to impose a restraint on another’s action based on the claim that the action is\n\n 7   religiously abhorrent.” Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 441.\n\n 8         Indeed, accepting Plaintiffs’ argument would cast doubt on the\n\n 9   government’s ability to accommodate religious objectors in other spheres. The\n\n10   simple, non-burdensome act of requesting a religious exemption from a\n\n11   regulatory burden would nevertheless create a substantial burden on a religious\n\n12   objector so long as any resulting independent action by the government is also\n\n13   religiously objectionable. See Univ. of Notre Dame, 786 F.3d at 621 (Hamilton, J.,\n\n14   concurring) (“From conscientious objector status in the military draft to federal\n\n15   and state tax codes, from compulsory school attendance laws to school lunch\n\n16   menus, from zoning law to employment law and even fish and wildlife rules, our\n\n17   governments at every level have long made room for religious faith by allowing\n\n18   exceptions from generally applicable laws.”); see also Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 439\n\n\n                                              43\n\f 1   n.14 (analogizing to exemptions for religious objector employees). “The\n\n 2   possibilities are endless, but we doubt Congress, in enacting RFRA, intended for\n\n 3   them to be.” E.

But just because\n\n 7   Plaintiffs feel complicit in these third party actions does not mean that the\n\n 8   regulations impose a “burden” on their religious practice, much less a burden\n\n 9   that is “substantial” under RFRA. While a plaintiff’s “religious views may not\n\n10   accept [the] distinction between individual and governmental conduct,” the law\n\n11   does. Bowen, 476 U.S. at 701 n.6; see also Lyng, 485 U.S. at 451 (“Whatever may be\n\n12   the exact line between unconstitutional prohibitions on the free exercise of\n\n13   religion and the legitimate conduct by government of its own affairs, the location\n\n14   of the line cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a\n\n15   religious objector’s spiritual development.”). “Accepting the sincerity of\n\n16   Plaintiffs’ beliefs . . . does not relieve this Court of its responsibility to evaluate\n\n17   the substantiality of any burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise, and to\n\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\f 1   distinguish Plaintiffs’ duties from obligations imposed, not on them, but on\n\n 2   insurers and TPAs.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 247.\n\n 3         Thus, consistent with Bowen and related cases, we must assess whether the\n\n 4   claimed burden falls on a plaintiff or a third party with no religious objection.\n\n 5   Here, the only burden that actually falls on Plaintiffs is the objectively\n\n 6   insubstantial requirement of completing the opt-out form or letter. When all the\n\n 7   government requires of a religious objector is the de minimis requirement of\n\n 8   notification for an exemption such that the burden may be shifted to another,\n\n 9   there is no substantial burden, even if the religious objector sincerely finds the\n\n10   ultimate actions taken by the government and third parties offensive. Even\n\n11   though Plaintiffs believe their role in the causal chain makes them complicit in\n\n12   the provision of contraceptives, this belief does not control the substantial burden\n\n13   inquiry. Just like the conscientious objector, whose decision to opt out indirectly\n\n14   facilitates the drafting of another, Plaintiffs are not substantially burdened by the\n\n15   ultimate actions of the government and third parties. If what Plaintiffs must do to\n\n16   exempt themselves from the contraceptive coverage mandate is not substantially\n\n17   burdensome, it makes no difference that Plaintiffs’ act of claiming exemption\n\n18   plays a functional role in the government’s achievement of the purposes to which\n\n\n                                               45\n\f 1   Plaintiffs object, or that they believe themselves to be substantially burdened for\n\n 2   that reason.\n\n 3                                      *      *     *\n\n 4         The burden that the accommodation places on Plaintiffs is merely one of\n\n 5   notification, equivalent to the burden historically placed on draft registrants to\n\n 6   indicate their conscientious objections to military service. Once Plaintiffs avail\n\n 7   themselves of the simple, non-burdensome means of opting out, the regulations\n\n 8   do not require them to play any role in the provision of contraceptive coverage or\n\n 9   to suffer punishments for not doing so. To the contrary, the accommodation\n\n10   relieves them of providing contraceptive coverage, and instead enlists third-party\n\n11   administrators to provide such coverage. If a regulatory scheme that might\n\n12   otherwise violate an objecting individual’s rights under RFRA allows the objector\n\n13   to exempt himself from compliance via a simple, non-burdensome act of\n\n14   notification, there is no substantial burden. Furthermore, subsequent regulation\n\n15   of non-objecting parties in a manner that an objecting party finds offensive does\n\n16   not transform the act of opting out into a cognizable substantial burden. The\n\n17   rights conferred by the First Amendment and RFRA do not include a right to\n\n\n\n\n                                              46\n\f1   have the government or third parties behave in a manner that comports with an\n\n2   individual’s religious beliefs.\n3\n4                                     CONCLUSION\n\n5         For the foregoing reasons, we reject Plaintiffs’ RFRA challenge to the\n\n6   contraceptive coverage mandate. The regulations at issue do not substantially\n\n7   burden Plaintiffs’ religious exercise in violation of RFRA. Accordingly, the\n\n8   judgment of the district court is reversed in relevant part.\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f</pre>",
