The plaintiffs, four minor chil-\ndren (“the Doe children”), seek to proceed anonymously in\ntheir suit against Kamehameha Schools’ allegedly race-based\nadmissions policy. The plaintiffs’ parents fear for the chil-\ndren’s safety if their identities are revealed. After carefully\nconsidering the issue, the magistrate judge and district judge\ndecided that the prejudice to the defendants and the public’s\ninterest in open courts outweigh plaintiffs’ fears of harm.\nRather than disclose their names, the Doe children suffered\ndismissal with prejudice with leave to appeal, giving us juris-\ndiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm.\n\n                               I\n\n  The Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown in 1893, and\nHawaii was annexed as a territory of the United States in\n1897. Doe v. Kamehameha Sch./Bernice Pauahi Bishop\nEstate (Doe I), 470 F.3d 827, 831 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc).\nBy that time, U.S. and foreign settlement had brought eco-\nnomic distress, mortality and disease; the Native Hawaiian\npopulation had dwindled to 22,600 in 1919, from a population\n10 to 50 times larger a century and a half earlier. See id. at\n830.\n\f3316               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   It was in this context that in 1884, Princess Bernice Pauahi\nBishop, the last descendant of the Hawaiian monarchy, estab-\nlished two schools and a testamentary trust to fund them. See\nLeigh Caroline Case, Note, Hawaiian Eth(n)ics: Race and\nReligion in Kamehameha Schools, 1 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts.\nJ. 131, 131 (1992). The Kamehameha Schools have sought to\npreserve the Hawaiian culture and identity by providing\nclasses on Hawaiian culture and teaching classes in the\nHawaiian language. The teaching and use of the Hawaiian\nlanguage were banned in public schools from 1896 to 1986.\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Interior, From Mauka\nto Makai: The River of Justice Must Flow Freely 29 (2000).\n\n   The schools have since expanded to three K-12 campuses,\nand the trust totaled $9.1 billion in 2008—a private educa-\ntional endowment surpassed in the United States by very few\nuniversities. See Rick Daysog, Kamehameha Assets Approach\n$9.1 Billion, Honolulu Advertiser, Feb. 9, 2008; Donald A.\nThompson, Note, Brown v. Kamehameha Schools: An Instru-\nmental Critique of Remedial Self-Segregation in Private Edu-\ncation, 81 S. Cal. L. Rev. 831, 833-34 (2008). But the board\nof trustees has interpreted the trust instrument to require the\nadmission of Native Hawaiians to the near exclusion of appli-\ncants of other racial backgrounds. Doe I, 470 F.3d at 832. The\nSchools’ publicly acknowledged policy is to grant admission\nto any applicant with any amount of Native Hawaiian blood\nbefore admitting other applicants. Id. Indeed, since 1966, only\ntwo non-Native Hawaiians have been admitted. David M.\nForman, The Hawaiian Usage Exception to the Common\nLaw: An Inoculation Against the Effects of Western Influence,\n30 U. Haw. L. Rev. 319, 331 (2008).1\n\n  The schools voluntarily admitted one non-Native applicant,\nKalani Rosell, in 2002, after determining that all qualified\n  1\n    In the 1960s, Kamehameha Schools reversed its previous policy of\nallowing children of faculty members to attend the schools. Doe I, 470\nF.3d at 870 (Bybee, J., dissenting).\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                    3317\nNative Hawaiian applicants had been admitted. See id.;\nThompson, supra, at 833. The ensuing protests prompted\nKamehameha to amend its admissions policy. Thompson,\nsupra, at 833. Kamehameha waived the application fee and\nthe minimum-test-score requirement, effectively ensuring that\nthere would never again be an insufficient number of quali-\nfied Native-Hawaiian applicants. Id.\n\n   Another non-Native Hawaiian was admitted in 2003.\nKamehameha Schools admitted Brayden Mohica-Cummings,\nwho applied as a Native Hawaiian because his mother was\nadopted by a Native Hawaiian. Forman, supra, at 332. After\ndetermining that Mohica-Cummings was not of Native\nHawaiian ancestry, Kamehameha rescinded his admission. Id.\nMohica-Cummings sued for an injunction admitting him to\nthe Schools. Id. The District of Hawaii granted a temporary\ninjunction admitting the boy, and he was eventually allowed\nto matriculate as part of the settlement with Kamehameha. Id.\n\n   In 2003, a non-Native applicant to Kamehameha, chal-\nlenged the Schools’ admissions policy under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981. See Doe I, 470 F.3d at 829. The district court upheld\nthe admissions policy. Id. A panel of this Court reversed, but\nthe en banc court reversed again, concluding that the admis-\nsions policy was a valid affirmative action plan. See id. The\nsuit settled while the petition for certiorari was pending before\nthe Supreme Court. Thompson, supra, at 835. The next day,\nthe attorney in Doe I announced his intention to bring this suit\nin order to seek Supreme Court review of the Ninth Circuit’s\nen banc decision. See id.\n\n   This case, however, quickly became mired in procedural\nconflict. In Doe I, Kamehameha never objected to the fact that\nthe plaintiff proceeded anonymously, but the school objected\nto the Doe children’s request for anonymity in this case. The\nDoe children moved for leave to proceed anonymously.2\n  2\n   Plaintiffs’ names were told to Kamehameha’s counsel and some staff\nunder a protective order.\n\f3318               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   In their motion, the Doe children argued that they reason-\nably fear physical injury if their identities are revealed. First,\nthe Doe children pointed to public reactions to the District of\nHawaii’s injunction provisionally admitting Mohica-\nCummings to Kamehameha. After the district court’s order,\nthe U.S. Attorney for Hawaii noted a “growing sense of anger\nand rage” and threats of “kill haole day everyday,” prompting\nhim to warn the public that violence or threats of violence\nbased on race are federal offenses.3\n\n   Second, the plaintiffs referred to an affidavit executed by\nthe Doe I plaintiff’s mother. She recounted that after the\namount of the Doe I settlement was leaked to the Honolulu\npress, there were calls to “break [the plaintiff’s and his attor-\nney’s] every bone and make [those] bastards suffer.” Others\nstated that “now the boy will have to pay” because they knew\npeople “who want to kick this boys [sic] ****.” Still others\nurged that the identities of the Doe I plaintiff and his mother\nbe exposed to force them “to stand up and face those that they\nare robbing.” She stated that because of these threats, she and\nher son would “fear for [their] safety if [their] identities\n[were] made public” and that they were “prepared to move\nand go into hiding” if their identities were revealed.\n\n   Third, the Doe children referred to various internet postings\nregarding their lawsuit. One posting predicted that if the\nplaintiffs were admitted to Kamehameha, they were “jus\ngonna get lickins everyday.” Another posting warned that if\nplaintiffs’ “haole attorneys continue doing this, one day\nthey’re gonna be targeted by some crazy Hawaiian or group\nof Hawaiians armed with baseball bats or guns.”\n  3\n    “Haole” is a term in the Native Hawaiian language denoting a for-\neigner, especially a White or Caucasian person. Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged 1030\n(1981). “Kill haole day” is an unofficial tradition in Hawaiian public\nschools when some Native Hawaiian children “beat[ ] up Caucasian stu-\ndents on the last day of school.” Craig Gima, ‘Kill Haole Day’ Linked to\nHate-Crime Bill, Honolulu Star Bulletin, Mar. 24, 1999.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  3319\n   Finally, the plaintiffs called the court’s attention to violent\ncrimes with racial overtones committed by Native Hawaiians\nagainst non-Natives. In some of these crimes, young children\nseverely injured their non-Native classmates, calling the vic-\ntims derogatory names related to their skin color, especially\n“f------ haole.”\n\n   Magistrate Judge Kurren found that the threats against\nplaintiffs in previous lawsuits and the attorneys were not\ndirected toward the Doe children. The magistrate judge also\nfound that other internet “comments [were] not threats but\n[did] voice the commentators’ frustration with this lawsuit.”\nLikewise, the magistrate judge discounted the anonymous\ninternet comments suggesting that the Doe children would be\ninjured at Kamehameha Schools, relying on the plaintiffs’\nstatement that they “are fearful of public harassment and\nretaliation, as reflected in public threats and other vitriol, not\nwith possible retaliation and ostracism at KS if and when they\nare admitted.” Although the plaintiffs’ parents’ affidavits\nshowed “subjective fear” of retaliation, the court found that,\n“[a]t most, Plaintiffs’ evidence suggests they may be socially\nostracized.” The magistrate judge denied the motion to pro-\nceed anonymously.\n\n   Later that afternoon, two Hawaiian newspapers published\nstories reporting on the magistrate judge’s order. The online\nforums of each newspaper generated myriad comments. The\nDoe children moved to reconsider based on this newly discov-\nered evidence, highlighting comments such as, “Good that the\njudge ordered them to make these little brats [sic] names\nknown to the public, so they can be tormented by their fellow\nstudents and general public.” Another posting stated that these\n“4 kids . . . will need 10 bodyguards lol.” Another read, “Sac-\nrifice them!!!!!!!!,” and another: “And I’d say the majority of\n‘us’ don’t want anything bad to happen to the kids. We all\nrealize that they are mere pawns in this mess caused by\n‘adults.’ Now stringing up those scum lawyers is not such a\nbad idea. (Don’t be scared, it’s in the Halloween spirit).”\n\f3320                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nAnother predicted that if their names were revealed, the plain-\ntiffs “would have to watch their backs for the rest of their\nlives!”\n\n   Plaintiffs also introduced threatening comments made to\ntheir attorney, David Rosen. Rosen received a phone call on\nthe afternoon the magistrate judge’s decision was filed. The\ncaller warned that “everyone is going to know who your cli-\nents are. Now, both you and your haole clients can get the\nlickins’ you deserve. Why do you f------ haoles even come to\nHawaii?” He also received an email:\n\n      You are a son of a bitch . . . I know so many kids\n      that did not get into kamehameha schools with\n      Hawaiian blood and you are trying to take that away\n      . . . I am tired of haoles like you. yOU JEWISH\n      SHITHEAD!!!! if i see you ever in public..no wor-\n      ries . . . I will SPIT on you . . . and YOU will throw\n      the first punch . . . and believe me . . . it will be my\n      pleasure to beat the crap out of you . . . by the way\n      . . . i am a NON Hawaiian . . . .\n\nThe magistrate judge found the additional comments “no\nmore probative of a threat of harm to Plaintiffs than evidence\nthis Court previously considered” and denied the motion to\nreconsider.\n\n   On review, the district court concluded that the motion to\nproceed anonymously was a nondispositive matter under Fed-\neral Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) and upheld the magistrate\njudge’s findings as neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to\nlaw. The district court determined that the Doe children had\ncommitted two fatal procedural flaws in their briefing.4 In the\n  4\n    The district court ruled against the Doe children’s motion to proceed\nanonymously on two procedural grounds, which we reject. The district\ncourt correctly determined that the Doe children’s motion was nondisposi-\ntive under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) and Local Rule 74.1 and\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         3321\nalternative, the district judge ruled against the Doe children on\nthe merits. The court found that the Doe children only\nappealed two of the relevant factors—whether the threatened\nharm is sufficiently severe and whether reasonable persons in\nthe plaintiffs’ position would believe that they might actually\nbe harmed.5 The court concluded that, “[g]iven the absence of\nthreats directed to Plaintiffs, no reasonable person in any posi-\ntion would believe a threat would be carried out.”\n\n                                     II\n\n   We review the district court’s denial of plaintiffs’ motion\nfor leave to proceed anonymously for an abuse of discretion.\n\nthat the standard of review was whether the magistrate judge’s findings\nwere “clearly erroneous or contrary to law.” See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A);\nMaisonville v. F2 Am., Inc., 902 F.2d 746, 747-48 (9th Cir. 1990). None-\ntheless, the Doe children’s failure to argue under the correct standard of\nreview did not constitute procedural default.\n   Second, the district court affirmed the magistrate judge’s report on the\nground that the Doe children offered no arguments for reversal but just\nincorporated by reference arguments made before the magistrate judge.\nPlaintiffs argue that Local Rule 74.1 requires only that the “appealing\nparty [file and serve] a written statement of appeal [on the district court]\nwhich shall specifically designate the order, or part thereof, appealed\nfrom.” Kamehameha Schools argues that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n10(c) does not allow a party to incorporate earlier briefing by reference.\nSee Swanson v. U.S. Forest Serv., 87 F.3d 339, 345 (9th Cir. 1996)). Yet\nthe Doe children justify their incorporation by reference under Local Rule\n74.1, not Federal Rule 10(c). Rule 74.1 must be interpreted in light of\nLocal Rule 74.2, which requires a party appealing a magistrate judge’s\ncase dispositive order to file “written objections that specifically identify\nthe portions of the order, findings, or recommendations to which objection\nis made and the basis for such objections.” The absence of such specific\nrequirements in Rule 74.1 is telling. Therefore, the Doe children did not\ndefault by merely appealing the magistrate judge’s order and incorporating\nthe arguments fully briefed before the magistrate judge.\n   5\n     Given that we hold that the Doe children did not procedurally default,\nwe also hold that they properly appealed consideration of all the factors\nrelevant to a motion to proceed anonymously.\n\f3322              DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nDoes I Thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058,\n1069 (9th Cir. 2000). We must affirm the district court unless\nthe district court “relied on an erroneous view of the law,\nmade a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or\nstruck an unreasonable balance of the relevant factors.” Id.\n\n                               III\n\n   [1] To determine whether to allow a party to proceed anon-\nymously when the opposing party has objected, a district\ncourt must balance five factors: “(1) the severity of the threat-\nened harm, (2) the reasonableness of the anonymous party’s\nfears, . . . (3) the anonymous party’s vulnerability to such\nretaliation,” (4) the prejudice to the opposing party, and (5)\nthe public interest. Id. at 1068 (internal citations omitted).\n\n   [2] The Advanced Textile analysis here is quite difficult,\nparticularly in light of the controversy surrounding the case,\nthe recognized tension between some Native Hawaiians and\nnon-Natives in Hawaii and the threats against the anonymous\nplaintiffs. Still, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin refusing to allow anonymity because the district court did\nnot clearly err in its conclusion that the Doe children do not\nreasonably fear severe harm. Thus, the district court did not\nunreasonably conclude that the public interest and possible\nprejudice to the defendants outweigh the plaintiffs’ interest in\nanonymity.\n\n                                A\n\n   [3] The Advanced Textile factor concerning the public\ninterest sets the stage for our debate, so it is where we begin.\nThe normal presumption in litigation is that parties must use\ntheir real names. See id. at 1067-68; Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a).\nThis presumption is loosely related to the public’s right to\nopen courts, see Advanced Textile, 214 F.3d at 1067, and the\nright of private individuals to confront their accusers, see S.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  3323\nMethodist Univ. Ass’n of Women Law Students v. Wynne &\nJaffe, 599 F.2d 707, 713 (5th Cir. 1979).\n\n   [4] In this circuit, the common law rights of access to the\ncourts and judicial records are not taken lightly. We recognize\nthat there is a “general right to inspect and copy public\nrecords and documents, including judicial records and docu-\nments.” Kamakana v. City of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1178\n(9th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omit-\nted). The “public interest in understanding the judicial pro-\ncess” has supported our “general history of access.” Id. at\n1178-79 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   [5] But, on the other side of the public-interest debate, it is\ndifficult to see “how disguising plaintiffs’ identities will\nobstruct public scrutiny of the important issues in this case.”\nAdvanced Textile, 214 F.3d at 1072. The Doe children bring\nclaims of widespread discrimination. Neither the district\ncourt, the Ninth Circuit panel nor the en banc court in Doe I\nplaced any reliance on the plaintiff’s identity. There is no rea-\nson to believe these issues will play a greater role here.\n\n   The district court concluded that the public scrutiny of the\nDoe children’s standing would be impaired by anonymity.\nDefendants proclaim that “the standing issue is of critical (in\nfact, constitutional) significance to the litigation.” Although\nstanding is indeed of paramount importance to the plaintiffs’\nability to sue, it is certainly not the main issue in the public’s\neye. And, with such a large applicant pool, the court will most\nlikely be able to discuss most aspects of an individual’s appli-\ncation without revealing the individual plaintiff’s identity.\n\n    [6] Similarly, we recognize that the fact that the “public\n. . . has an interest in seeing this case decided on the merits”\nweighs in favor of allowing anonymity. Id. at 1073. Indeed,\nthe district court’s finding that “this case presents extremely\ncontroversial and very important issues in Hawaii” weighs in\nfavor of allowing the Doe children to proceed anonymously.\n\f3324             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nSee id. at 1072. Because the case was dismissed for failure to\ninclude the plaintiffs’ names in the complaint, “permitting the\nplaintiffs to use pseudonyms [would] serve the public’s inter-\nest in this lawsuit by enabling it to go forward.” Id. at 1062,\n1073.\n\n   [7] The district court properly weighed the arguments\nunder the public-interest factor both for and against anonym-\nity. Given the strong general presumption that plaintiffs will\nconduct litigation under their own names, we cannot say that\nthe district court abused its discretion by concluding that this\nfactor favors defendants.\n\n                               B\n\n   [8] The important public-interest factors on both sides of\nthe issue lay the foundation for our debate, but the outcome\nof this case comes down to the two most important factors—\nseverity of the threatened harm and the reasonableness of the\nplaintiffs’ fears. As the district court recognized, these two\nAdvanced Textile factors are intricately related and should be\naddressed together. In order to proceed anonymously, a plain-\ntiff must show both (1) a fear of severe harm, and (2) that the\nfear of severe harm is reasonable. The district court did not\nclearly err in concluding that the Doe children do not reason-\nably fear severe harm.\n\n   First, the district court must identify the harm that the\nplaintiffs fear. Here, the Doe children primarily fear physical\nharm if their identities are revealed. The Doe children point\nto threats that they were “jus gonna get lickins everyday” and\nthat these “4 kids . . . will need 10 bodyguards lol.” The chil-\ndren likewise point to the phone call to their attorney threaten-\ning that now “both you and your haole clients can get the\nlickins’ you deserve.” They also point to the vitriolic threats\nof “kill haole day everyday” after Mohica-Cummings was\nadmitted to Kamehameha.\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         3325\n   [9] These threats of physical retaliation are undoubtedly\nsevere. In Advanced Textile, we recognized that physical harm\npresents the paradigmatic case for allowing anonymity. In that\ncase, the non-resident plaintiffs faced the severe threats of\ndeportation, arrest, and imprisonment, such that they did “not\nneed to prove that they face[d] a danger of physical injury.”\nId. at 1071.\n\n   [10] But, as the district court recognized, fear of severe\nharm is irrelevant if the plaintiffs do not reasonably fear\nsevere harm. The district court did not abuse its discretion in\nconcluding that the Doe children’s fears of severe harm are\nnot reasonable. Advanced Textile instructs that “plaintiffs are\nnot required to prove that the defendants intend to carry out\nthe threatened retaliation. What is relevant is [whether] plain-\ntiffs were threatened, and [whether] a reasonable person\nwould believe that the threat might actually be carried out.”\nId.\n\n   To judge the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’ fears, we\nmust consider the surrounding context and other listeners’\nreactions to the threats. Cf., e.g., Planned Parenthood of the\nColumbia/Willamette, Inc. v. Am. Coal. of Life Activists, 290\nF.3d 1058, 1079-80 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (taking into\naccount the context of the “random acts of violence” of oth-\ners); United States v. Prochaska, 222 F.2d 1, 2 (7th Cir. 1955)\n(finding in criminal speech case that “[w]ritten words or\nphrases take their character as threatening or harmless from\nthe context in which they are used, measured by the common\nexperience of the society in which they are published”).6 In\n   6\n     These First Amendment cases discussing the concept of a “true threat”\nare helpful, but the analysis here is not identical. The First Amendment\ncases pose a higher bar to finding a reasonable fear. In those cases, one\nparty’s fear of the threat must be weighed against the opposing party’s\nFirst Amendment right to speak freely because the threatened party seeks\nto prevent the other party’s speech (the alleged threats). See, e.g., Planned\nParenthood, 290 F.3d at 1071-72 (noting that the definition of “threat” is\nstrict in First Amendment cases because advocating violence is protected\nbut threatening violence is not). In this case, no one is arguing that the\ncourts should enjoin the internet posters or other speakers.\n\f3326             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ncontext, a plaintiff might reasonably fear a veiled threat of\nviolence. See Doe v. Stegall, 653 F.2d 180, 183 n.6 (5th Cir.\n1981) (holding that the plaintiffs reasonably feared harm and\ncould proceed pseudonymously where locals reacted to a law-\nsuit about school prayer at a meeting by saying things like\n“God is fixing to come back. He’ll show them,” “Christians\nmust beat the evil out of these people,” and “We have got to\nband together and whop this evil thing”). On the other hand,\na court may disregard a comment, which is a threat on its\nface, because the context demonstrates frustration, a joke, or\npolitical commentary instead of a true intent to harm. See\nWatts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 706-07 (1969) (per\ncuriam) (concluding that speech against military draft that\n“[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to\nget in my sights is L.B.J.” was protected political speech in\npart because listeners laughed). It is in the particular purview\nof the district court to view alleged threats in context and\ndetermine what the “reasonable” person in the plaintiffs’ situ-\nation would fear.\n\n   Here, there are several facts militating in favor of a finding\nthat the Doe children’s fears are reasonable. In context, the\nthreats on the internet become much more frightening. The\ncontext no doubt includes random acts of racial violence\nagainst non-Native Hawaiian children. This is amplified by\ncalls for “kill haole day everyday,” when a non-Native was\nrecently admitted to Kamehameha.\n\n   And as for evaluating the effect on other listeners, the U.S.\nAttorney for Hawaii did not laugh or dismiss the calls for “kill\nhaole day” as the listeners laughed at the “threat” against\nPresident Johnson in the Watts case. Instead, the U.S. Attor-\nney issued a strongly worded warning, reminding the public\nthat threats based on race are a federal felony. Likewise, many\nof the “listeners” responding to the internet postings took the\ncomments very seriously. One internet poster accused the oth-\ners of “just want[ing] to persecute these kids,” and another\nposter responded that “the majority of ‘us’ don’t want any-\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  3327\nthing bad to happen to the kids,” implying that others did wish\nthe children harm.\n\n   [11] Nonetheless, the district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in concluding that the plaintiffs’ fears were unreasonable.\nThe magistrate judge correctly recognized that many times\npeople say things anonymously on the internet that they\nwould never say in another context and have no intention of\ncarrying out. See Mark Plate, Online Abuses Spur Policy\nChanges, Honolulu Advertiser, Nov. 24, 2008 (message from\nSenior Vice President/Editor of The Honolulu Advertiser, not-\ning the problems the newspaper had with internet postings on\nmany stories: “Since we opened up the option . . . for readers\nto comment on every story, . . . . [u]nfortunately, we have\nseen a steady rise of hateful name-calling, innuendo and inane\ndrivel, all of it anonymous”). The magistrate judge noted that\nplaintiffs had culled only a few comments out of hundreds of\nanonymous comments regarding this case. And he recognized\nthat many of the “threats” were accompanied by statements\nsupporting non-violence. One poster the Doe children cite as\nmaking threatening comments later stated that “No one wants\nto see any of the kids hurt by this. The people I know would\nfight to the death to save these kids if anyone tries to harm\nthem.” The district court also correctly evaluated the Doe\nchildren’s concession “that they are not fearful of ‘retaliation\nand ostracism at [Kamehameha] if and when they are admit-\nted’ ” in discounting the threats that the children would get\n“lickins” everyday at school. Likewise, Rosell and Mohica-\nCummings both attended Kamehameha with no reported\nincidents—either at school or outside the school setting.\nMohica-Cummings used his real name in litigation against\nKamehameha, and his counsel specifically stated that the U.S.\nAttorney’s warnings to the public were unnecessary. The dis-\ntrict court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the\nplaintiffs’ fears were unreasonable.\n\f3328                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n                                     C\n\n   [12] Because the district court did not abuse its discretion\nby determining that the public interest weighs against ano-\nnymity and that the Doe children do not reasonably fear\nsevere harm, the remaining two factors do not tip the balance.\nThe district court correctly concluded that the third factor, the\nvulnerability of plaintiffs, weighs in favor of anonymity.\nAlthough the “youth of these plaintiffs [is] a significant factor\nin the matrix of considerations arguing for anonymity,” Ste-\ngall, 653 F.2d at 186, the district court concluded that the Doe\nchildren do not reasonably fear severe harm despite this vul-\nnerability. Likewise, the district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in determining that plaintiffs’ fears do not outweigh\npossible prejudice to defendants—however minimal that prej-\nudice might be—in light of the district court’s conclusion that\nthese fears are unreasonable.7\n   7\n     The district court did not discuss this element because it found that the\nplaintiffs had not sufficiently objected to the magistrate judge’s resolution\nof this factor. We conclude that the plaintiffs raised this argument before\nthe district court, see supra notes 4-5, but hold that this factor does not\nsway our analysis.\n   The magistrate judge found that the defendants would be prejudiced if\nthe Doe children were to proceed anonymously due to standing-related\ndiscovery. The magistrate judge found that obtaining records regarding the\nDoe children, such as applications, would be burdened by the limited\nnumber of employees allowed to know the plaintiffs’ names. The Doe\nchildren counter that thousands of pages of discovery, including plaintiffs’\napplication packages, have already been produced.\n   We doubt that anonymity would hinder the defendants’ standing\ndefense. The Doe children have revealed their names under a protective\norder, and the parties could refer in general terms to the Doe children’s\nrelevant characteristics, such as whether they completed their applications\nor met the school’s requirements in terms of test scores and grades. Like-\nwise, the Doe children’s actual applications could be used simply by\nredacting the children’s names and any particular identifying information.\nHowever, the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that\ndefendants would have been hindered in their efforts to gather third-party\ndiscovery concerning standing and in defending the high-profile case in\nthe media, if not in the courts.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                   3329\n   We are sympathetic to the concerns of the Doe children and\ntheir parents, but we recognize the paramount importance of\nopen courts. For this reason, the default presumption is that\nthe plaintiffs will use their true names. We also emphasize\nthat, as an appellate court, we are constrained by the applica-\nble standard of review. Had the district court found that ano-\nnymity was appropriate, we likely would have concluded that\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion. Or, were we per-\nmitted to make findings and weigh the factors anew, we might\nhave held that anonymity here was appropriate. As it is, how-\never, we review the district court’s decision only for abuse of\ndiscretion. Because the district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in determining that the Doe children do not reasonably\nfear severe harm, we affirm the district court’s order dismiss-\ning the case based on plaintiffs’ failure to disclose their identi-\nties.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f",

The plaintiffs, four minor chil-\ndren (“the Doe children”), seek to proceed anonymously in\ntheir suit against Kamehameha Schools’ allegedly race-based\nadmissions policy. The plaintiffs’ parents fear for the chil-\ndren’s safety if their identities are revealed. After carefully\nconsidering the issue, the magistrate judge and district judge\ndecided that the prejudice to the defendants and the public’s\ninterest in open courts outweigh plaintiffs’ fears of harm.\nRather than disclose their names, the Doe children suffered\ndismissal with prejudice with leave to appeal, giving us juris-\ndiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

See id. at\n830.\n\f3316               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   It was in this context that in 1884, Princess Bernice Pauahi\nBishop, the last descendant of the Hawaiian monarchy, estab-\nlished two schools and a testamentary trust to fund them. See\nLeigh Caroline Case, Note, Hawaiian Eth(n)ics: Race and\nReligion in Kamehameha Schools, 1 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts.\nJ. 131, 131 (1992). The Kamehameha Schools have sought to\npreserve the Hawaiian culture and identity by providing\nclasses on Hawaiian culture and teaching classes in the\nHawaiian language. The teaching and use of the Hawaiian\nlanguage were banned in public schools from 1896 to 1986.\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Interior, From Mauka\nto Makai: The River of Justice Must Flow Freely 29 (2000).\n\n   The schools have since expanded to three K-12 campuses,\nand the trust totaled $9.1 billion in 2008—a private educa-\ntional endowment surpassed in the United States by very few\nuniversities. See Rick Daysog, Kamehameha Assets Approach\n$9.1 Billion, Honolulu Advertiser, Feb. 9, 2008; Donald A.\nThompson, Note, Brown v. Kamehameha Schools: An Instru-\nmental Critique of Remedial Self-Segregation in Private Edu-\ncation, 81 S. Cal. L. Rev. 831, 833-34 (2008). But the board\nof trustees has interpreted the trust instrument to require the\nadmission of Native Hawaiians to the near exclusion of appli-\ncants of other racial backgrounds. Doe I, 470 F.3d at 832. The\nSchools’ publicly acknowledged policy is to grant admission\nto any applicant with any amount of Native Hawaiian blood\nbefore admitting other applicants. Id. Indeed, since 1966, only\ntwo non-Native Hawaiians have been admitted. David M.\nForman, The Hawaiian Usage Exception to the Common\nLaw: An Inoculation Against the Effects of Western Influence,\n30 U. Haw. L. Rev. 319, 331 (2008).1\n\n  The schools voluntarily admitted one non-Native applicant,\nKalani Rosell, in 2002, after determining that all qualified\n  1\n    In the 1960s, Kamehameha Schools reversed its previous policy of\nallowing children of faculty members to attend the schools. Doe I, 470\nF.3d at 870 (Bybee, J., dissenting).\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                    3317\nNative Hawaiian applicants had been admitted. See id.;\nThompson, supra, at 833. The ensuing protests prompted\nKamehameha to amend its admissions policy. Thompson,\nsupra, at 833. Kamehameha waived the application fee and\nthe minimum-test-score requirement, effectively ensuring that\nthere would never again be an insufficient number of quali-\nfied Native-Hawaiian applicants. Id.\n\n   Another non-Native Hawaiian was admitted in 2003.\nKamehameha Schools admitted Brayden Mohica-Cummings,\nwho applied as a Native Hawaiian because his mother was\nadopted by a Native Hawaiian. Forman, supra, at 332. After\ndetermining that Mohica-Cummings was not of Native\nHawaiian ancestry, Kamehameha rescinded his admission. Id.\nMohica-Cummings sued for an injunction admitting him to\nthe Schools. Id. The District of Hawaii granted a temporary\ninjunction admitting the boy, and he was eventually allowed\nto matriculate as part of the settlement with Kamehameha. Id.\n\n   In 2003, a non-Native applicant to Kamehameha, chal-\nlenged the Schools’ admissions policy under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981. See Doe I, 470 F.3d at 829. The district court upheld\nthe admissions policy. Id. A panel of this Court reversed, but\nthe en banc court reversed again, concluding that the admis-\nsions policy was a valid affirmative action plan. See id. The\nsuit settled while the petition for certiorari was pending before\nthe Supreme Court. Thompson, supra, at 835. The next day,\nthe attorney in Doe I announced his intention to bring this suit\nin order to seek Supreme Court review of the Ninth Circuit’s\nen banc decision. See id.\n\n   This case, however, quickly became mired in procedural\nconflict. In Doe I, Kamehameha never objected to the fact that\nthe plaintiff proceeded anonymously, but the school objected\nto the Doe children’s request for anonymity in this case. The\nDoe children moved for leave to proceed anonymously.2\n  2\n   Plaintiffs’ names were told to Kamehameha’s counsel and some staff\nunder a protective order.\n\f3318               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   In their motion, the Doe children argued that they reason-\nably fear physical injury if their identities are revealed. First,\nthe Doe children pointed to public reactions to the District of\nHawaii’s injunction provisionally admitting Mohica-\nCummings to Kamehameha. After the district court’s order,\nthe U.S. Attorney for Hawaii noted a “growing sense of anger\nand rage” and threats of “kill haole day everyday,” prompting\nhim to warn the public that violence or threats of violence\nbased on race are federal offenses.3\n\n   Second, the plaintiffs referred to an affidavit executed by\nthe Doe I plaintiff’s mother. She recounted that after the\namount of the Doe I settlement was leaked to the Honolulu\npress, there were calls to “break [the plaintiff’s and his attor-\nney’s] every bone and make [those] bastards suffer.” Others\nstated that “now the boy will have to pay” because they knew\npeople “who want to kick this boys [sic] ****.” Still others\nurged that the identities of the Doe I plaintiff and his mother\nbe exposed to force them “to stand up and face those that they\nare robbing.” She stated that because of these threats, she and\nher son would “fear for [their] safety if [their] identities\n[were] made public” and that they were “prepared to move\nand go into hiding” if their identities were revealed.\n\n   Third, the Doe children referred to various internet postings\nregarding their lawsuit. One posting predicted that if the\nplaintiffs were admitted to Kamehameha, they were “jus\ngonna get lickins everyday.” Another posting warned that if\nplaintiffs’ “haole attorneys continue doing this, one day\nthey’re gonna be targeted by some crazy Hawaiian or group\nof Hawaiians armed with baseball bats or guns.”\n  3\n    “Haole” is a term in the Native Hawaiian language denoting a for-\neigner, especially a White or Caucasian person. Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged 1030\n(1981). “Kill haole day” is an unofficial tradition in Hawaiian public\nschools when some Native Hawaiian children “beat[ ] up Caucasian stu-\ndents on the last day of school.” Craig Gima, ‘Kill Haole Day’ Linked to\nHate-Crime Bill, Honolulu Star Bulletin, Mar. 24, 1999.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  3319\n   Finally, the plaintiffs called the court’s attention to violent\ncrimes with racial overtones committed by Native Hawaiians\nagainst non-Natives. In some of these crimes, young children\nseverely injured their non-Native classmates, calling the vic-\ntims derogatory names related to their skin color, especially\n“f------ haole.”\n\n   Magistrate Judge Kurren found that the threats against\nplaintiffs in previous lawsuits and the attorneys were not\ndirected toward the Doe children. The magistrate judge also\nfound that other internet “comments [were] not threats but\n[did] voice the commentators’ frustration with this lawsuit.”\nLikewise, the magistrate judge discounted the anonymous\ninternet comments suggesting that the Doe children would be\ninjured at Kamehameha Schools, relying on the plaintiffs’\nstatement that they “are fearful of public harassment and\nretaliation, as reflected in public threats and other vitriol, not\nwith possible retaliation and ostracism at KS if and when they\nare admitted.” Although the plaintiffs’ parents’ affidavits\nshowed “subjective fear” of retaliation, the court found that,\n“[a]t most, Plaintiffs’ evidence suggests they may be socially\nostracized.” The magistrate judge denied the motion to pro-\nceed anonymously.\n\n   Later that afternoon, two Hawaiian newspapers published\nstories reporting on the magistrate judge’s order. The online\nforums of each newspaper generated myriad comments. The\nDoe children moved to reconsider based on this newly discov-\nered evidence, highlighting comments such as, “Good that the\njudge ordered them to make these little brats [sic] names\nknown to the public, so they can be tormented by their fellow\nstudents and general public.” Another posting stated that these\n“4 kids . . . will need 10 bodyguards lol.” Another read, “Sac-\nrifice them!!!!!!!!,” and another: “And I’d say the majority of\n‘us’ don’t want anything bad to happen to the kids. We all\nrealize that they are mere pawns in this mess caused by\n‘adults.’ Now stringing up those scum lawyers is not such a\nbad idea. (Don’t be scared, it’s in the Halloween spirit).”\n\f3320                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nAnother predicted that if their names were revealed, the plain-\ntiffs “would have to watch their backs for the rest of their\nlives!”\n\n   Plaintiffs also introduced threatening comments made to\ntheir attorney, David Rosen. Rosen received a phone call on\nthe afternoon the magistrate judge’s decision was filed. The\ncaller warned that “everyone is going to know who your cli-\nents are. Now, both you and your haole clients can get the\nlickins’ you deserve. Why do you f------ haoles even come to\nHawaii?” He also received an email:\n\n      You are a son of a bitch . . . I know so many kids\n      that did not get into kamehameha schools with\n      Hawaiian blood and you are trying to take that away\n      . . . I am tired of haoles like you. yOU JEWISH\n      SHITHEAD!!!! if i see you ever in public..no wor-\n      ries . . . I will SPIT on you . . . and YOU will throw\n      the first punch . . . and believe me . . . it will be my\n      pleasure to beat the crap out of you . . . by the way\n      . . . i am a NON Hawaiian . . . .\n\nThe magistrate judge found the additional comments “no\nmore probative of a threat of harm to Plaintiffs than evidence\nthis Court previously considered” and denied the motion to\nreconsider.\n\n   On review, the district court concluded that the motion to\nproceed anonymously was a nondispositive matter under Fed-\neral Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) and upheld the magistrate\njudge’s findings as neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to\nlaw. The district court determined that the Doe children had\ncommitted two fatal procedural flaws in their briefing.4 In the\n  4\n    The district court ruled against the Doe children’s motion to proceed\nanonymously on two procedural grounds, which we reject. The district\ncourt correctly determined that the Doe children’s motion was nondisposi-\ntive under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) and Local Rule 74.1 and\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         3321\nalternative, the district judge ruled against the Doe children on\nthe merits. The court found that the Doe children only\nappealed two of the relevant factors—whether the threatened\nharm is sufficiently severe and whether reasonable persons in\nthe plaintiffs’ position would believe that they might actually\nbe harmed.5 The court concluded that, “[g]iven the absence of\nthreats directed to Plaintiffs, no reasonable person in any posi-\ntion would believe a threat would be carried out.”\n\n                                     II\n\n   We review the district court’s denial of plaintiffs’ motion\nfor leave to proceed anonymously for an abuse of discretion.\n\nthat the standard of review was whether the magistrate judge’s findings\nwere “clearly erroneous or contrary to law.” See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A);\nMaisonville v. F2 Am., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540895\"><a href=\"/opinion/540895/craig-john-maisonville-and-james-m-dombroski-v-f2-america-inc-f2/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 747-48 (9th Cir. 1990). None-\ntheless, the Doe children’s failure to argue under the correct standard of\nreview did not constitute procedural default.\n   Second, the district court affirmed the magistrate judge’s report on the\nground that the Doe children offered no arguments for reversal but just\nincorporated by reference arguments made before the magistrate judge.\nPlaintiffs argue that Local Rule 74.1 requires only that the “appealing\nparty [file and serve] a written statement of appeal [on the district court]\nwhich shall specifically designate the order, or part thereof, appealed\nfrom.” Kamehameha Schools argues that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n10(c) does not allow a party to incorporate earlier briefing by reference.\nSee Swanson v. U.S. Forest Serv., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720609\"><a href=\"/opinion/720609/john-swanson-idaho-sportsmens-coalition-alliance-for-the-wild-rockies-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 345 (9th Cir. 1996)). Yet\nthe Doe children justify their incorporation by reference under Local Rule\n74.1, not Federal Rule 10(c). Rule 74.1 must be interpreted in light of\nLocal Rule 74.2, which requires a party appealing a magistrate judge’s\ncase dispositive order to file “written objections that specifically identify\nthe portions of the order, findings, or recommendations to which objection\nis made and the basis for such objections.” The absence of such specific\nrequirements in Rule 74.1 is telling. Therefore, the Doe children did not\ndefault by merely appealing the magistrate judge’s order and incorporating\nthe arguments fully briefed before the magistrate judge.\n   5\n     Given that we hold that the Doe children did not procedurally default,\nwe also hold that they properly appealed consideration of all the factors\nrelevant to a motion to proceed anonymously.\n\f3322              DOE v.

We must affirm the district court unless\nthe district court “relied on an erroneous view of the law,\nmade a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or\nstruck an unreasonable balance of the relevant factors.” Id.\n\n                               III\n\n   [1] To determine whether to allow a party to proceed anon-\nymously when the opposing party has objected, a district\ncourt must balance five factors: “(1) the severity of the threat-\nened harm, (2) the reasonableness of the anonymous party’s\nfears, . . . (3) the anonymous party’s vulnerability to such\nretaliation,” (4) the prejudice to the opposing party, and (5)\nthe public interest. Id. at 1068 (internal citations omitted).\n\n   [2] The Advanced Textile analysis here is quite difficult,\nparticularly in light of the controversy surrounding the case,\nthe recognized tension between some Native Hawaiians and\nnon-Natives in Hawaii and the threats against the anonymous\nplaintiffs. Still, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin refusing to allow anonymity because the district court did\nnot clearly err in its conclusion that the Doe children do not\nreasonably fear severe harm. Thus, the district court did not\nunreasonably conclude that the public interest and possible\nprejudice to the defendants outweigh the plaintiffs’ interest in\nanonymity.\n\n                                A\n\n   [3] The Advanced Textile factor concerning the public\ninterest sets the stage for our debate, so it is where we begin.\nThe normal presumption in litigation is that parties must use\ntheir real names. See id. at 1067-68; Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a).\nThis presumption is loosely related to the public’s right to\nopen courts, see Advanced Textile, 214 F.3d at 1067, and the\nright of private individuals to confront their accusers, see S.\n\f                  DOE v.

The “public interest in understanding the judicial pro-\ncess” has supported our “general history of access.” Id. at\n1178-79 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   [5] But, on the other side of the public-interest debate, it is\ndifficult to see “how disguising plaintiffs’ identities will\nobstruct public scrutiny of the important issues in this case.”\nAdvanced Textile, 214 F.3d at 1072. The Doe children bring\nclaims of widespread discrimination. Neither the district\ncourt, the Ninth Circuit panel nor the en banc court in Doe I\nplaced any reliance on the plaintiff’s identity. There is no rea-\nson to believe these issues will play a greater role here.\n\n   The district court concluded that the public scrutiny of the\nDoe children’s standing would be impaired by anonymity.\nDefendants proclaim that “the standing issue is of critical (in\nfact, constitutional) significance to the litigation.” Although\nstanding is indeed of paramount importance to the plaintiffs’\nability to sue, it is certainly not the main issue in the public’s\neye. And, with such a large applicant pool, the court will most\nlikely be able to discuss most aspects of an individual’s appli-\ncation without revealing the individual plaintiff’s identity.\n\n    [6] Similarly, we recognize that the fact that the “public\n. . . has an interest in seeing this case decided on the merits”\nweighs in favor of allowing anonymity. Id. at 1073. Indeed,\nthe district court’s finding that “this case presents extremely\ncontroversial and very important issues in Hawaii” weighs in\nfavor of allowing the Doe children to proceed anonymously.\n\f3324             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nSee id. at 1072. Because the case was dismissed for failure to\ninclude the plaintiffs’ names in the complaint, “permitting the\nplaintiffs to use pseudonyms [would] serve the public’s inter-\nest in this lawsuit by enabling it to go forward.” Id. at 1062,\n1073.\n\n   [7] The district court properly weighed the arguments\nunder the public-interest factor both for and against anonym-\nity. Given the strong general presumption that plaintiffs will\nconduct litigation under their own names, we cannot say that\nthe district court abused its discretion by concluding that this\nfactor favors defendants.\n\n                               B\n\n   [8] The important public-interest factors on both sides of\nthe issue lay the foundation for our debate, but the outcome\nof this case comes down to the two most important factors—\nseverity of the threatened harm and the reasonableness of the\nplaintiffs’ fears. As the district court recognized, these two\nAdvanced Textile factors are intricately related and should be\naddressed together. In order to proceed anonymously, a plain-\ntiff must show both (1) a fear of severe harm, and (2) that the\nfear of severe harm is reasonable. The district court did not\nclearly err in concluding that the Doe children do not reason-\nably fear severe harm.\n\n   First, the district court must identify the harm that the\nplaintiffs fear. Here, the Doe children primarily fear physical\nharm if their identities are revealed. The Doe children point\nto threats that they were “jus gonna get lickins everyday” and\nthat these “4 kids . . . will need 10 bodyguards lol.” The chil-\ndren likewise point to the phone call to their attorney threaten-\ning that now “both you and your haole clients can get the\nlickins’ you deserve.” They also point to the vitriolic threats\nof “kill haole day everyday” after Mohica-Cummings was\nadmitted to Kamehameha.\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         3325\n   [9] These threats of physical retaliation are undoubtedly\nsevere. In Advanced Textile, we recognized that physical harm\npresents the paradigmatic case for allowing anonymity. In that\ncase, the non-resident plaintiffs faced the severe threats of\ndeportation, arrest, and imprisonment, such that they did “not\nneed to prove that they face[d] a danger of physical injury.”\nId. at 1071.\n\n   [10] But, as the district court recognized, fear of severe\nharm is irrelevant if the plaintiffs do not reasonably fear\nsevere harm. The district court did not abuse its discretion in\nconcluding that the Doe children’s fears of severe harm are\nnot reasonable. Advanced Textile instructs that “plaintiffs are\nnot required to prove that the defendants intend to carry out\nthe threatened retaliation. What is relevant is [whether] plain-\ntiffs were threatened, and [whether] a reasonable person\nwould believe that the threat might actually be carried out.”\nId.\n\n   To judge the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’ fears, we\nmust consider the surrounding context and other listeners’\nreactions to the threats. Cf., e.g., Planned Parenthood of the\nColumbia/Willamette, Inc. v. Am. Coal. of Life Activists, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777725\"><a href=\"/opinion/777725/planned-parenthood-of-the-columbiawillamette-inc-portland-feminist/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1079-80 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (taking into\naccount the context of the “random acts of violence” of oth-\ners); United States v.

The First Amendment\ncases pose a higher bar to finding a reasonable fear. In those cases, one\nparty’s fear of the threat must be weighed against the opposing party’s\nFirst Amendment right to speak freely because the threatened party seeks\nto prevent the other party’s speech (the alleged threats). See, e.g., Planned\nParenthood, 290 F.3d at 1071-72 (noting that the definition of “threat” is\nstrict in First Amendment cases because advocating violence is protected\nbut threatening violence is not). In this case, no one is arguing that the\ncourts should enjoin the internet posters or other speakers.\n\f3326             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ncontext, a plaintiff might reasonably fear a veiled threat of\nviolence. See Doe v. Stegall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392085\"><a href=\"/opinion/392085/thomas-doe-and-jane-doe-minors-by-mary-roe-their-next-friend-on-behalf/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183 n.6 (5th Cir.\n1981) (holding that the plaintiffs reasonably feared harm and\ncould proceed pseudonymously where locals reacted to a law-\nsuit about school prayer at a meeting by saying things like\n“God is fixing to come back. He’ll show them,” “Christians\nmust beat the evil out of these people,” and “We have got to\nband together and whop this evil thing”). On the other hand,\na court may disregard a comment, which is a threat on its\nface, because the context demonstrates frustration, a joke, or\npolitical commentary instead of a true intent to harm. See\nWatts v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107904\"><a href=\"/opinion/107904/watts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706-07 (1969) (per\ncuriam) (concluding that speech against military draft that\n“[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to\nget in my sights is L.B.J.” was protected political speech in\npart because listeners laughed). It is in the particular purview\nof the district court to view alleged threats in context and\ndetermine what the “reasonable” person in the plaintiffs’ situ-\nation would fear.\n\n   Here, there are several facts militating in favor of a finding\nthat the Doe children’s fears are reasonable. In context, the\nthreats on the internet become much more frightening. The\ncontext no doubt includes random acts of racial violence\nagainst non-Native Hawaiian children. This is amplified by\ncalls for “kill haole day everyday,” when a non-Native was\nrecently admitted to Kamehameha.\n\n   And as for evaluating the effect on other listeners, the U.S.\nAttorney for Hawaii did not laugh or dismiss the calls for “kill\nhaole day” as the listeners laughed at the “threat” against\nPresident Johnson in the Watts case. Instead, the U.S. Attor-\nney issued a strongly worded warning, reminding the public\nthat threats based on race are a federal felony. Likewise, many\nof the “listeners” responding to the internet postings took the\ncomments very seriously. One internet poster accused the oth-\ners of “just want[ing] to persecute these kids,” and another\nposter responded that “the majority of ‘us’ don’t want any-\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  3327\nthing bad to happen to the kids,” implying that others did wish\nthe children harm.\n\n   [11] Nonetheless, the district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in concluding that the plaintiffs’ fears were unreasonable.\nThe magistrate judge correctly recognized that many times\npeople say things anonymously on the internet that they\nwould never say in another context and have no intention of\ncarrying out. See Mark Plate, Online Abuses Spur Policy\nChanges, Honolulu Advertiser, Nov. 24, 2008 (message from\nSenior Vice President/Editor of The Honolulu Advertiser, not-\ning the problems the newspaper had with internet postings on\nmany stories: “Since we opened up the option . . . for readers\nto comment on every story, . . . . [u]nfortunately, we have\nseen a steady rise of hateful name-calling, innuendo and inane\ndrivel, all of it anonymous”). The magistrate judge noted that\nplaintiffs had culled only a few comments out of hundreds of\nanonymous comments regarding this case. And he recognized\nthat many of the “threats” were accompanied by statements\nsupporting non-violence. One poster the Doe children cite as\nmaking threatening comments later stated that “No one wants\nto see any of the kids hurt by this. The people I know would\nfight to the death to save these kids if anyone tries to harm\nthem.” The district court also correctly evaluated the Doe\nchildren’s concession “that they are not fearful of ‘retaliation\nand ostracism at [Kamehameha] if and when they are admit-\nted’ ” in discounting the threats that the children would get\n“lickins” everyday at school. Likewise, Rosell and Mohica-\nCummings both attended Kamehameha with no reported\nincidents—either at school or outside the school setting.\nMohica-Cummings used his real name in litigation against\nKamehameha, and his counsel specifically stated that the U.S.\nAttorney’s warnings to the public were unnecessary. The dis-\ntrict court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the\nplaintiffs’ fears were unreasonable.\n\f3328                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n                                     C\n\n   [12] Because the district court did not abuse its discretion\nby determining that the public interest weighs against ano-\nnymity and that the Doe children do not reasonably fear\nsevere harm, the remaining two factors do not tip the balance.\nThe district court correctly concluded that the third factor, the\nvulnerability of plaintiffs, weighs in favor of anonymity.\nAlthough the “youth of these plaintiffs [is] a significant factor\nin the matrix of considerations arguing for anonymity,” Ste-\ngall, 653 F.2d at 186, the district court concluded that the Doe\nchildren do not reasonably fear severe harm despite this vul-\nnerability. Likewise, the district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in determining that plaintiffs’ fears do not outweigh\npossible prejudice to defendants—however minimal that prej-\nudice might be—in light of the district court’s conclusion that\nthese fears are unreasonable.7\n   7\n     The district court did not discuss this element because it found that the\nplaintiffs had not sufficiently objected to the magistrate judge’s resolution\nof this factor. We conclude that the plaintiffs raised this argument before\nthe district court, see supra notes 4-5, but hold that this factor does not\nsway our analysis.\n   The magistrate judge found that the defendants would be prejudiced if\nthe Doe children were to proceed anonymously due to standing-related\ndiscovery. The magistrate judge found that obtaining records regarding the\nDoe children, such as applications, would be burdened by the limited\nnumber of employees allowed to know the plaintiffs’ names. The Doe\nchildren counter that thousands of pages of discovery, including plaintiffs’\napplication packages, have already been produced.\n   We doubt that anonymity would hinder the defendants’ standing\ndefense. The Doe children have revealed their names under a protective\norder, and the parties could refer in general terms to the Doe children’s\nrelevant characteristics, such as whether they completed their applications\nor met the school’s requirements in terms of test scores and grades. Like-\nwise, the Doe children’s actual applications could be used simply by\nredacting the children’s names and any particular identifying information.\nHowever, the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that\ndefendants would have been hindered in their efforts to gather third-party\ndiscovery concerning standing and in defending the high-profile case in\nthe media, if not in the courts.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                   3329\n   We are sympathetic to the concerns of the Doe children and\ntheir parents, but we recognize the paramount importance of\nopen courts. For this reason, the default presumption is that\nthe plaintiffs will use their true names. We also emphasize\nthat, as an appellate court, we are constrained by the applica-\nble standard of review. Had the district court found that ano-\nnymity was appropriate, we likely would have concluded that\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion. Or, were we per-\nmitted to make findings and weigh the factors anew, we might\nhave held that anonymity here was appropriate. As it is, how-\never, we review the district court’s decision only for abuse of\ndiscretion. Because the district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in determining that the Doe children do not reasonably\nfear severe harm, we affirm the district court’s order dismiss-\ning the case based on plaintiffs’ failure to disclose their identi-\nties.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
