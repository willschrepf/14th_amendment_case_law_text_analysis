For the reasons that follow, the judgment\n\n 8   of the district court is affirmed with respect to one of these\n\n 9   memoranda, and reversed and remanded with respect to the other\n\n10   two.\n\n11                                 BACKGROUND\n\n12                In 2003, Congress enacted the two statutes that provide\n\n13   the factual backdrop for this litigation: the United States\n\n14   Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria Act, 22 U.S.C.\n\n15   §§ 7601-7682. (\"Leadership Act\"), and the Trafficking Victims\n\n16   Protection Reauthorization Act, 22 U.S.C. §§ 7101-7112.\n\n17   (\"TVPRA\").    Each included what has become known as the \"pledge\n\n18   requirement,\" purporting to require all organizations that\n\n19   receive funds for HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking work pursuant to\n\n20   the statutes to have \"a policy explicitly opposing prostitution\n\n21   and sex trafficking.\"    22 U.S.C. § 7631(f); see also 22 U.S.C. §\n\n22   7110(g)(2).\n\n23                After the Leadership Act was enacted, the\n24                [OLC] . . . warned that applying the Policy\n25                Requirement to U.S.-based organizations would\n26                be unconstitutional. Heeding that warning,\n\n                                        3\n\f 1              [the government] initially refrained from\n 2              enforcing it against U.S.-based NGOs. OLC\n 3              subsequently changed course and withdrew what\n 4              it characterized as its prior \"tentative\n 5              advice,\" asserting that \"there are reasonable\n 6              arguments to support the constitutionality\"\n 7              of applying the Policy Requirement to\n 8              U.S.-based organizations, and, starting in\n 9              mid-2005, the Agencies began applying the\n10              Requirement to U.S.-based grantees.\n11   Alliance for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc. v. U.S. Agency for Int'l\n\n12   Dev., 651 F.3d 218, 225 (2d Cir. 2011).1\n\n13              On July 14, 2005, the Brennan Center submitted FOIA\n\n14   requests to USAID, HHS, and the OLC for \"any and all documents\n\n15   containing guidance\" provided by the OLC to any representatives\n\n16   of HHS or USAID \"relating to the enforcement\" of the pledge\n\n17   requirement.   FOIA Request from Brennan Center to HHS at 1 (July\n\n18   14, 2005), Brennan Center v. Dep't of Justice, No. 11-4599, Joint\n\n19   Appendix (\"J.A.\"), at 248 (2d Cir. Jan. 6, 2012); FOIA Request\n\n20   from Brennan Center to OLC at 1, J.A. 270 (July 14, 2005); FOIA\n\n21   Request from Brennan Center to USAID at 1, J.A. 302 (July 14,\n\n22   2005).   On March 7, 2007, HHS denied the request in its entirety\n\n\n          1\n           Alliance for Open Society was brought by several\n     organizations, including the Brennan Center, challenging the\n     pledge requirement on First Amendment grounds. We affirmed the\n     district court's decision to preliminarily enjoin that provision\n     of the Leadership Act concluding that it \"falls well beyond what\n     the Supreme Court and this Court have upheld as permissible\n     conditions on the receipt of government funds [because it] does\n     not merely require recipients of Leadership Act funds to refrain\n     from certain conduct, but goes substantially further and compels\n     recipients to espouse the government's viewpoint.\" 651 F.3d at\n     223.\n\n                                      4\n\f 1   and referred it to USAID and the OLC, from which, it had\n\n 2   determined, many of the requested documents originated.2    The OLC\n\n 3   denied the original request in its entirety, and denied the\n\n 4   request referred from HHS except as to a nine-page letter\n\n 5   commenting on the TVPRA that was already in the public record,\n\n 6   which was sent in September 2003 from a DOJ official to\n\n 7   Representative James Sensenbrenner, then-Chairman of the House\n\n 8   Judiciary Committee.   USAID did not respond to the referred\n\n 9   request, and denied the original request in its entirety.    The\n\n10   Brennan Center appealed the various denials with those agencies,\n\n11   and the agencies affirmed their denials, leaving the Brennan\n\n12   Center with the option of pursuing its claims in federal court.\n\n13   See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).\n\n14             On October 15, 2009, the Brennan Center brought this\n\n15   action in the United States District Court for the Southern\n\n16   District of New York broadly alleging that USAID, OLC, and HHS\n\n17   had violated FOIA by failing to identify responsive documents,\n\n18   failing to disclose records, failing to disclose reasonably\n\n19   segregable portions of otherwise withheld documents, and, with\n\n20   respect to the OLC and USAID, failing to respond to FOIA\n\n\n          2\n            HHS located 231 pages of responsive documents, and\n     withheld 46 pages in their entirety pursuant to FOIA's\n     deliberative process exemption, see 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5). It\n     determined that of the remaining documents, 177 pages originated\n     with the OLC, and 8 pages with USAID, and referred the Brennan\n     Center's request to those agencies.\n\n                                      5\n\f 1   requests.   On January 15, 2010, the defendants provided the\n\n 2   plaintiff with an index of withheld documents as required by\n\n 3   Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).    The Vaughn index\n\n 4   included the date of each document withheld, the author and\n\n 5   recipient(s), a brief description, the number of pages, and the\n\n 6   reason for its being withheld.   The district court judge met with\n\n 7   the defendants on April 22, 2010, and May 5, 2010, and asked them\n\n 8   to consider disclosing some or all of the documents in order to\n\n 9   avoid further litigation.   In response, the defendants released\n\n10   heavily redacted versions of several documents and associated\n\n11   emails.   See Order, Brennan Center v. Dep't of Justice, No. 09\n\n12   Civ. 8756, at 1-3 (S.D.N.Y. July 1, 2010), ECF No. 16.   To the\n\n13   extent that internal agency emails and memoranda are referenced\n\n14   in this opinion, they are part of the record by virtue of this\n\n15   disclosure.\n\n16               On January 28, 2011, the plaintiff moved for summary\n\n17   judgment seeking release of the entirety of three memoranda that\n\n18   it alleges were improperly withheld pursuant to FOIA's \"Exemption\n\n19   5,\" which shields from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency\n\n20   memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a\n\n21   party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\"     5\n\n22   U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).   That exemption has been interpreted to\n\n23   encompass traditional common law privileges against disclosure,\n\n24   including the attorney-client and deliberative-process\n\n                                       6\n\f 1   privileges, and the work-product doctrine.   Nat'l Council of La\n\n 2   Raza v. Dep't of Justice, 411 F.3d 350, 356 (2d Cir. 2005).     The\n\n 3   three withheld documents that are the targets of the Brennan\n\n 4   Center's objections are: (1) a one-page memorandum provided by\n\n 5   the OLC to HHS and USAID on or about February 17, 2004, regarding\n\n 6   the constitutionality of the pledge requirement (the \"February\n\n 7   Memorandum\"); (2) a July 2, 2004, draft of a formal, but never-\n\n 8   finalized, OLC opinion addressing the constitutionality of the\n\n 9   pledge requirement (the \"July 2 Memorandum\"); and (3) a July 29,\n\n10   2004, draft memorandum similar to the July 2 Memo (the \"July 29\n\n11   Memorandum\").\n\n12             The February Memorandum\n\n13             On February 12, 2004, the General Counsel of HHS asked\n\n14   the OLC to provide, on a \"very short timeframe,\" \"advice on the\n\n15   constitutional issues raised by the grant restrictions under the\n\n16   two statutes.\"   Memorandum from Renee Lettow Lerner at 2, J.A. 55\n\n17   (March 12, 2004) (describing HHS request).\n\n18             In response, on February 17, Renee Lettow Lerner, an\n\n19   OLC attorney, sent an email to HHS Deputy General Counsel Paula\n\n20   M. Stannard and USAID employee John Gardner attaching a one-page\n\n21   memorandum containing at least some of the requested advice.3\n\n\n          3\n            All correspondence regarding the February Memorandum\n     involved both USAID and HHS, although the March 12, 2004, letter\n     suggests the advice was provided only at the behest of HHS. We\n     have not found any explanation in the record for this\n\n                                      7\n\f 1   The memorandum explained that \"[i]n the limited time available to\n\n 2   us, we have not been able to conduct a comprehensive analysis,\n\n 3   but we have reached the following tentative views, which might\n\n 4   need to be altered after further analysis.\"   February Memorandum\n\n 5   at 1, J.A. 37.   The document, the first of the three memoranda\n\n 6   that are the subject of this litigation, was supplied to the\n\n 7   plaintiff during the course of this litigation with all analysis\n\n 8   redacted.\n\n 9               In an email later that evening, Stannard conveyed\n\n10   \"draft language for the HIV/AIDS and trafficking grant\n\n11   awards/agreements\" to Lerner.   Email from Stannard, \"Re: OLC's\n\n12   advice on grant announcements,\" J.A. 40 (Feb. 17, 2004).   She\n\n13   also sent a copy to the USAID employee.   Again, a copy of the\n\n14   email was supplied to the Brennan Center, but most of it was\n\n15   redacted.   Lerner replied to Stannard the following day, February\n\n16   18, in an email that was, in effect, withheld from disclosure,\n\n17   i.e., it is redacted in its entirety.\n\n18               On February 19, a USAID employee, acting on behalf of\n\n19   USAID employee Gardner, sent that agency's revised \"Acquisition &\n\n20   Assistance Policy Directive\" (\"AAPD\")4 to Lerner, Stannard, and\n\n\n     discrepancy.\n          4\n             \"AAPDs serve as official sources for the latest updates\n     in acquisition and assistance (A&A) policy and requirements.\n     AAPDs provide information of significance including, but not\n     limited to, advance notification of changes or implementation of\n\n                                       8\n\f 1   other HHS and State Department employees.   Later that day,\n\n 2   Stannard and HHS employee Demetrios Kouzoukas sent \"a final draft\n\n 3   of the language\" to Lerner, Gardner, and other HHS, USAID, and\n\n 4   State Department employees, and thanked those on the email chain\n\n 5   for their comments.

The February 26 AAPD included the\n\n14   pledge requirement only for \"Non-U.S. Non-Governmental\n\n15   Organizations and Public International Organizations.\"   Id. at 5.\n\n16   That meant that any grant to a foreign organization would include\n\n\n     new requirements to A&A regulations and procedures.\" Acquisition\n     and Assistance Policy Directives (AAPDs) and Contract Information\n     Bulletins (CIBs), available at\n     http://transition.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/\n     (last visited August 3, 2012). \"Acquisition refers to obtaining\n     goods and services, through various types of contracts, for the\n     use or benefit of the Agency.

No similar\n\n 5   language would be included in the grant language required with\n\n 6   respect to U.S. organizations.    An AAPD that had been issued on\n\n 7   January 15, 2004, prior to the OLC's February memorandum, did\n\n 8   include the pledge requirement language for both U.S. and non-\n\n 9   U.S. organizations.

A July 22, 2004, USAID document\n\n18   contained a footnote explaining that the OLC \"in a draft opinion\n\n19   determined that this provision only may be applied to foreign\n\n20   non-governmental organizations and public international\n\n21   organizations because of the constitutional implications of\n\n22   applying it to U.S. organizations.\"    USAID FY 2004 Update,\n\n23   \"Guidance on the Definition and Use of the Child Survival and\n\n24   Health Programs Fund and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative Account\"\n\n                                       10\n\f 1   at 35 n.10, J.A. 197 (July 22, 2004) (\"July 22 USAID Update\").\n\n 2   On August 3, 2004, USAID issued another AAPD explaining that\n\n 3   \"[t]he US Government has determined that it is appropriate to\n\n 4   apply the [pledge] requirement . . . only to foreign\n\n 5   organizations, including public international organizations.\"\n\n 6   USAID AAPD 04-09, \"Anti-Trafficking Activities –- Limitation on\n\n 7   the Use of Funds; Restriction on Organizations Promoting,\n\n 8   Supporting or Advocating Prostitution\" at 3, J.A. 200 (Aug. 3,\n\n 9   2004) (\"August 3 AAPD\").\n\n10              The July Memoranda\n\n11              In a July 2, 2004 email, the OLC provided HHS with a\n\n12   thirty-page draft opinion –- the second document the plaintiff\n\n13   seeks.   Another version of that draft, dated July 29, the third\n\n14   document that the plaintiff contends must be disclosed, was\n\n15   emailed to HHS on July 30.   In the record on appeal, both draft\n\n16   opinions are redacted with the exception of a date, title, and\n\n17   introductory sentence.   After an in camera review, however, the\n\n18   district court concluded that contrary to the OLC's view conveyed\n\n19   in February, those drafts counseled implementation of the pledge\n\n20   requirement for both U.S.-based and foreign organizations.5\n\n\n\n          5\n           Despite the July 2004 memoranda that opined that the\n     pledge requirement could constitutionally be applied to domestic\n     activities, in July and August, USAID continued to advise that\n     the requirement would only be applied to foreign organizations,\n     as evidenced by the July 22 USAID Update and August 3 AAPD.\n\n                                     11\n\f 1   Brennan Center v.

No formal OLC opinion on the issue was\n\n 4   ever finalized or issued.\n\n 5             In September 2004, Daniel Levin, the Acting Assistant\n\n 6   Attorney General for the OLC, wrote to the general counsel of HHS\n\n 7   confirming that \"earlier this year . . . [DOJ] gave its tentative\n\n 8   advice\" that the pledge requirement could only be applied to\n\n 9   foreign organizations overseas, but explained that \"[w]e have\n\n10   reviewed the matter further and we are withdrawing that tentative\n\n11   advice. . . .

Azar, II at 1, J.A. 207\n\n14   (Sept. 20, 2004)(\"Levin Letter\").      This letter was not released\n\n15   by either the OLC or HHS, but, according to the defendants, it\n\n16   was \"improperly leaked . . .

Br. at 13.\n\n18             The first public discussion of the agencies'\n\n19   deliberations concerning the pledge requirement was held during a\n\n20   March 2005 hearing of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the\n\n21   House Appropriations Committee.     Randall Tobias, who was then\n\n22   U.S. Global AIDS coordinator, testified that\n\n23             [t]he [OLC] provided some tentative advice\n24             initially that those restrictions should be\n25             applied only to foreign organizations.\n\n                                       12\n\f 1               Sometime mid- to late- . . . September of\n 2               2004, [the OLC] withdrew that earlier\n 3               tentative advice and advised that that\n 4               provision was intended by the Congress to\n 5               apply without that limitation to both\n 6               domestic organizations as well as foreign\n 7               organizations.

But Benczkowski explained that the\n\n25   OLC had thereafter changed its mind and advised in the September\n\n26   2004 letter that the pledge requirement could be applied\n\n27   domestically because there were \"reasonable arguments to defend\"\n\n28   doing so.   Id. at 1-2.

In ordering disclosure of the memoranda, the\n\n12   court concluded that the deliberative-process privilege did not\n\n13   apply.\n\n14             It is clear from the various AAPDs, internal\n15             government letters and memoranda, public\n\n\n          6\n             Several news articles –- at least one of which was\n     published before the agencies themselves had spoken publicly --\n     also noted the OLC's advice on this issue. A February 28, 2005,\n     Wall Street Journal article explained that \"[t]he Bush\n     Administration had previously applied the requirement only to\n     overseas groups because the Justice Department initially advised\n     that it would be an unconstitutional violation of free speech to\n     demand that American grant applicants support Mr. Bush's policy.\n     But the Justice Department reversed itself last fall.\" Michael\n     M. Phillips, Bush Ties Money for AIDS Work to a Policy Pledge,\n     WALL ST. J., Feb. 28, 2005. A May 18, 2005, Washington Post\n     article similarly said that \"[i]nitially, the policy was applied\n     only to foreign organizations operating overseas.

Indeed, from the public\n12             record alone, there can be little doubt that\n13             this was the case. . . .\n14             Further, the record also reveals that the\n15             conclusions and analysis contained in the\n16             July Memoranda, which the Court has examined\n17             in camera, were the basis for the\n18             Government's determination to alter its\n19             policy and apply the Pledge Requirement to\n20             U.S.-based organizations. . . . [A]lthough\n21             the documents were never mentioned\n22             specifically by name, the Government\n23             incorporated the July Memoranda by reference\n24             [in the relevant public statements].\n\n\n25   Brennan Center, 2011 WL 4001146, at *6-*7, 2011 U.S.\n\n26   Dist.

Id. at\n\n30   *7, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99121, at *20.

It \"requires the government to disclose its\n\n24   records unless its documents fall within one of the specific,\n\n                                       16\n\f 1   enumerated exemptions set forth in the Act.   Consistent with\n\n 2   FOIA's purposes, these statutory exemptions are narrowly\n\n 3   construed.\"    Id. at 355-56 (citations omitted).   The agency bears\n\n 4   the burden of demonstrating that an exemption applies.    Id. at\n\n 5   356.\n\n 6             The memoranda being sought by the Brennan Center in\n\n 7   this case were withheld by the government defendants pursuant to\n\n 8   FOIA Exemption 5, which exempts \"inter-agency or intra-agency\n\n 9   memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a\n\n10   party other than an agency in litigation with the agency\" from\n\n11   the disclosure otherwise required under the Act.    5 U.S.C.\n\n12   § 552(b)(5).

As discussed\n\n\n                                    18\n\f 1   more thoroughly below, these exceptions include: (1) when the\n\n 2   contents of the document have been \"adopted, formally or\n\n 3   informally, as the agency position on an issue or [are] used by\n\n 4   the agency in its dealings with the public,\" La Raza, 411 F.3d at\n\n 5   356-57 (quoting Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

The Scope of Exemption 5.   Although Exemption 5 is\n\n20   set out by statute, it is the Supreme Court's decision in Sears\n\n\n          7\n           The litigation posture of Exemption 5 cases, the present\n     one being no exception, focuses on the government proving the\n     applicability of an exemption rather than the plaintiff proving\n     applicability of one of the affirmative provisions because the\n     burden rests on the government to shield documents from\n     disclosure otherwise to be disclosed under FOIA.\n\n                                      19\n\f 1   that delineates the limits of that exemption, and which has been\n\n 2   the starting point for all of our discussions of it, as it is in\n\n 3   this case.\n\n 4                The Sears Court explained the circumstances under which\n\n 5   a document otherwise subject to Exemption 5 might lose its\n\n 6   protection.    The plaintiff had submitted a FOIA request for\n\n 7   \"Advice and Appeals Memoranda\" prepared by the General Counsel of\n\n 8   the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") discussing potential\n\n 9   charges against various employers.     421 U.S. at 142-43.\n\n10                The Court began by analyzing the process by which such\n\n11   memoranda were created.    Typically, the NLRB General Counsel\n\n12   required certain charging decisions from its regional offices\n\n13   first to be submitted to its central office so that the agency\n\n14   had an \"opportunity to formulate a coherent policy, and to\n\n15   achieve some measure of uniformity, in enforcing the labor laws.\"\n\n16   Id. at 141.    A regional director submitted a memorandum that\n\n17   \"set[] forth the facts of the case, a statement of the issues on\n\n18   which advice [was] sought, and a recommendation.\"    Id.     The\n\n19   General Counsel's office then assigned the case to a staff\n\n20   attorney who assisted in preparing the \"Advice and Appeals\n\n21   Memorandum\" that \"briefly summarize[d] the facts, . . . set forth\n\n22   the . . . legal or policy issue submitted together with a\n\n23   detailed legal rationale, and contain[ed] instructions for the\n\n24   final processing of the case.\"    Id. at 142 (internal quotation\n\n                                       20\n\f 1   marks omitted).   Based on that memorandum, the regional director\n\n 2   then decided whether or not to prosecute the charge.   Id.\n\n 3               The Court observed that while \"the public is vitally\n\n 4   concerned with the reasons . . . [for] an agency policy actually\n\n 5   adopted,\" or \"those communications which explain [a] decision,\"\n\n 6   \"[t]he public is only marginally concerned with reasons\n\n 7   supporting a policy which an agency has rejected, or with reasons\n\n 8   which might have supplied, but did not supply, the basis for a\n\n 9   policy which was actually adopted on a different ground.\"    Id. at\n\n10   152.\n\n11               The reasons for a decision made by an agency, or a\n\n12   policy actually adopted, however, \"constitute the 'working law'\n\n13   of the agency.\"   Id. at 153.   Therefore, the exemption \"properly\n\n14   construed, calls for 'disclosure of all opinions and\n\n15   interpretations which embody the agency's effective law and\n\n16   policy, and the withholding of all papers which reflect the\n\n17   agency's group thinking in the process of working out its policy\n\n18   and determining what its law shall be.'\"   Id.

Rev. 761, 797 (1967)) (some internal quotation marks\n\n21   omitted).   \"This conclusion is powerfully supported by . . .\n\n22   [t]he affirmative portion of the Act, [which] expressly\n\n23   requir[es] indexing of 'final opinions,' 'statements of policy\n\n24   and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency,' and\n\n                                      21\n\f 1   'instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.'\"8\n\n 2   Sears, 421 U.S. at 153 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)).       Those\n\n 3   affirmative provisions, it reasoned, \"represent[] a strong\n\n 4   congressional aversion to secret agency law, and represent[] an\n\n 5   affirmative congressional purpose to require disclosure of\n\n 6   documents which have the force and effect of law.\"      Id. (internal\n\n 7   quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted).\n\n 8                  The Court concluded that NLRB memoranda that advised no\n\n 9   action be taken, and thereby ended the inquiry and left the\n\n10   responsible regional director with \"no decision to make,\" fell\n\n11   outside of Exemption 5 and therefore had to be disclosed.      Id. at\n\n12   155.       They \"are precisely the kind of agency law in which the\n\n13   public is so vitally interested and which Congress sought to\n\n14   prevent the agency from keeping secret.\"      Id. at 156.\n\n15                  After determining that these memoranda were the type of\n\n16   \"agency law\" which it concluded were non-exempt, the Court then\n\n17   explained that \"[f]or essentially the same reasons, these\n\n18   memoranda are 'final opinions' made in the 'adjudication of\n\n\n            8\n             The Sears Court subsumed into its \"working law\" or\n     \"agency law\" analysis all three of section 552(a)(2)'s\n     affirmative provisions, and did not, for example, discuss \"final\n     opinions\" separately from \"statements of policy and\n     interpretations which have been adopted by the agency.\" In many\n     cases, as in Sears, the line between a \"final opinion\" and a\n     \"statement of policy and interpretation[]\" is blurry, and the\n     \"working law\" analysis therefore provides an interpretation aimed\n     at aiding courts when presented with documents that fall between\n     these categories.\n\n                                         22\n\f 1   cases' . . . pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)(A),\" and thus must\n\n 2   be disclosed.   Id. at 158.   By contrast, the reasoning and\n\n 3   conclusions behind memoranda that advise prosecution \"will come\n\n 4   out in the course of litigation before the Board; and . . . the\n\n 5   'law' with respect to these cases will ultimately be made not by\n\n 6   the General Counsel but by the Board or the courts.\"   Id. at 160.\n\n 7               The Court then addressed a separate path towards the\n\n 8   loss of Exemption 5's protection –- whether predecisional and\n\n 9   deliberative documents fall outside of that exemption if\n\n10   \"adopt[ed] or incorporate[d] by reference\" into \"what would\n\n11   otherwise be a final opinion,\" in other words, in a document that\n\n12   has already been found to be nonexempt.   The Court concluded that\n\n13   they did.\n\n14               The probability that an agency employee will\n15               be inhibited from freely advising a\n16               decisionmaker for fear that his advice if\n17               adopted, will become public is slight.\n18               First, when adopted, the reasoning becomes\n19               that of the agency and becomes its\n20               responsibility to defend. Second, agency\n21               employees will generally be encouraged rather\n22               than discouraged by public knowledge that\n23               their policy suggestions have been adopted by\n24               the agency. Moreover, the public interest in\n25               knowing the reasons for a policy actually\n26               adopted by an agency supports . . . [the\n27               decision to order disclosure]. Thus, we hold\n28               that, if an agency chooses expressly to adopt\n29               or incorporate by reference an intra-agency\n30               memorandum previously covered by Exemption 5\n31               in what would otherwise be a final opinion,\n32               that memorandum may be withheld only on the\n33               ground that it falls within the coverage of\n34               some exemption other than Exemption 5.\n\n\n                                      23\n\f 1   Id.   at 161 (emphasis in original).\n\n 2              On the same day that the Supreme Court decided Sears,\n\n 3   it also decided Renegotiation Board v. Grumman Aircraft\n\n 4   Engineering Corp., 421 U.S. 168 (1975), a companion case further\n\n 5   exploring the limits of Exemption 5.    Grumman had requested\n\n 6   documents created during the Renegotiation Board's process of\n\n 7   \"deciding whether certain Government contractors have earned, and\n\n 8   must refund, 'excessive profits' on their Government contracts.\"\n\n 9   Id. at 170.     After exhaustively reviewing the process by which\n\n10   these documents were created, the Court explained that if a\n\n11   \"Division Report\" was created recommending a course of action, it\n\n12   would be given to the Renegotiation Board for its review.    Id. at\n\n13   176-77.   But \"[n]either the Board nor any of its members were\n\n14   bound by any prior recommendations.    The Board was free, after\n\n15   discussion, to reject the proposed conclusion reached in the\n\n16   Division Report, or to accept it for reasons other than those set\n\n17   forth in the report.\"    Id. at 177.   Similarly, although under a\n\n18   different process, a \"Regional Board Report\" could be created.\n\n19   Id. at 178-79.\n\n20              The Court concluded that these reports were not subject\n\n21   to disclosure because \"the evidence utterly fails to support the\n\n22   conclusion that the reasoning in the reports is adopted by the\n\n23   Board as its reasoning, even when it agrees with the conclusion\n\n24   of a report.\"    Id. at 184 (emphasis in original).   The reports\n\n25   themselves had \"no operative effect,\" and therefore could not be\n                                       24\n\f 1   characterized as \"final opinions,\" within the meaning of FOIA's\n\n 2   affirmative disclosure provisions.    Id. at 187.   \"[A]bsent\n\n 3   indication that [a report's] reasoning has been adopted, there is\n\n 4   little public interest in [its] disclosure.\"   Id. at 186.      The\n\n 5   reports therefore retained their protection under Exemption 5.\n\n 6             The Grumman Court acknowledged that some agency\n\n 7   decisions may simply not have any accompanying public rationale.\n\n 8   \"The effect of this decision [then] is that, in those cases in\n\n 9   which [the Renegotiation Board does not offer a summary of its\n\n10   reasoning], the public will be largely uninformed as to the basis\n\n11   for [its] decisions.\"   Id. at 191.\n\n12             The Freedom of Information Act imposes no\n13             independent obligation on agencies to write\n14             opinions. It simply requires them to\n15             disclose the opinions which they do write.\n16             If the public interest suffers by reason of\n17             the failure of the Board to explain some of\n18             its decisions, the remedy is for Congress to\n19             require it to do so. It is not for us to\n20             require disclosure of documents, under the\n21             purported authority of the Act, which are not\n22             final opinions, which do not accurately set\n23             forth the reasons for the Board's decisions,\n24             and the disclosure of which would impinge on\n25             the Board's predecisional processes.\n\n26   Id. (citation omitted).\n\n27             Although Grumman did not explain its reasoning using\n\n28   the same terminology as Sears, it also provided two somewhat\n\n29   distinct paths through which Exemption 5's protections could be\n\n30   lost: (1) if the reports had \"operative effect\" and were\n\n31   therefore akin to \"final opinions\" –- the equivalent of \"working\n\n                                     25\n\f 1   law\" in Sears's language; or (2) if the reports' reasoning and\n\n 2   conclusions had been adopted by the Board in issuing its own\n\n 3   decision –- the equivalent of \"express adoption or incorporation\n\n 4   by reference\" in Sears.\n\n 5             3.    Express Adoption or Incorporation by Reference.    We\n\n 6   have had several occasions on which to apply the Supreme Court's\n\n 7   Exemption 5 jurisprudence, in particular Sears's \"express\n\n 8   adoption\" or \"incorporation by reference\" holding, on which the\n\n 9   district court relied.    The most relevant for present purposes\n\n10   was our decision in La Raza.    There we considered whether the\n\n11   FOIA required disclosure of an OLC memorandum prepared for the\n\n12   DOJ on the subject of whether state and local law enforcement\n\n13   officials could lawfully enforce certain provisions of federal\n\n14   immigration law.   La Raza, 411 F.3d at 352.   The DOJ argued that\n\n15   \"it did not expressly adopt or incorporate the OLC memorandum\"\n\n16   into a final opinion, and it was therefore protected by the\n\n17   deliberative-process exemption, or the attorney-client privilege.\n\n18   Id.\n\n19             Since 1996, the DOJ had been of the view that state and\n\n20   local law enforcement could not enforce the civil provisions of\n\n21   federal immigration law -- \"such as overstaying one's visa or\n\n22   entering the United States without proper documentation.\"   Id. at\n\n23   352-53 & n.1.   The OLC had issued a memorandum supporting this\n\n24   position, which it had released publicly.   Id. at 353.\n\n\n                                      26\n\f 1             In 2002, under a new presidential administration, the\n\n 2   DOJ changed its policy.   Id.   Then-Attorney General John Ashcroft\n\n 3   announced an immigration initiative employing state and local\n\n 4   agencies to enforce specified civil provisions of federal\n\n 5   immigration law.   In a June 5, 2002, press conference explaining\n\n 6   the new initiative, the Attorney General reported that \"[OLC] has\n\n 7   concluded that this narrow, limited mission we are asking state\n\n 8   and local police to undertake voluntarily –- arresting aliens who\n\n 9   have violated . . . civil provisions that render an alien\n\n10   deportable [–-] is within the inherent authority of the states.\"\n\n11   Id.\n\n12             On March 11, 2003, General Ashcroft wrote a letter to\n\n13   an organization that had expressed an interest in the matter\n\n14   explaining that \"[OLC] previously opined that state and local law\n\n15   enforcement officials have inherent authority to make arrests for\n\n16   criminal immigration law violations generally.\"     Id.   At least\n\n17   three other letters from the Attorney General and an Acting\n\n18   Assistant Attorney General containing similar language were\n\n19   submitted to members of Congress.     Id. at 354.   And in June 2003,\n\n20   another member of the Attorney General's office, speaking to a\n\n21   group of local and state police department officials who were\n\n22   part of an FBI advisory board, offered a detailed explanation of\n\n23   the policy in which he repeatedly referenced the OLC's advice.\n\n24   Id. at 354-55.\n\n\n                                      27\n\f 1               We concluded that the \"repeated references\" made by the\n\n 2   Attorney General and high-ranking DOJ officials to the document\n\n 3   \"demonstrate[d] that the Department regarded the [m]emorandum as\n\n 4   the exclusive statement of, and justification for, its new\n\n 5   policy . . . .\"   Id. at 357.   The DOJ thus \"made a practice of\n\n 6   using the OLC Memorandum to justify and explain the Department's\n\n 7   policy and to assure the public and the very state and local\n\n 8   government officials who would be asked to implement the new\n\n 9   policy that the policy was legally sound.\"    Id. at 358.    The\n\n10   memorandum was, indeed, the \"primary legal authority justifying\n\n11   and driving\" the change in policy.9   Id.\n\n12               We thus concluded that the document had been expressly\n\n13   adopted or incorporated by reference, and ordered it to be\n\n14   released.   Id.\n\n15               Our decision in Wood v. FBI, 432 F.3d 78 (2d Cir.\n\n16   2005), rested on a rationale similar to that employed by the\n\n17   Supreme Court in Grumman.    There, a reporter sought disclosure of\n\n18   a memorandum prepared by DOJ trial attorneys related to an\n\n19   investigation of FBI agents alleged to have lied in affidavits\n\n20   supporting arrest warrant applications.     Id. at 80.   We affirmed\n\n\n\n          9\n           Referring to Grumman, we noted that \"there must be\n     evidence that an agency has actually adopted or incorporated by\n     reference the document at issue; mere speculation will not\n     suffice.\" La Raza, 411 F.3d at 359 (emphasis in original). We\n     also observed that \"a casual reference to a privileged document\n     does not necessarily imply that an agency agrees with the\n     reasoning contained in those documents.\" Id.\n                                     28\n\f 1   the district court's conclusion that the memorandum was properly\n\n 2   withheld under the work-product privilege pursuant to Exemption\n\n 3   5,10 and had not been incorporated by reference or expressly\n\n 4   adopted by the agency.   Id. at 84.\n\n 5             The plaintiff had argued that a note on the memorandum\n\n 6   by a high-ranking DOJ official indicating that he would decline\n\n 7   prosecution constituted express adoption or incorporation by\n\n 8   reference of the memorandum itself.   But, we said:\n\n 9             This brief notation does not indicate that\n10             DOJ adopted the reasoning of the . . .\n11             [m]emo. Neither [the endorsing official] nor\n12             any other high-level DOJ officials made any\n13             public references to the . . . [m]emo. There\n14             is no evidence in the record from which it\n15             could be inferred that DOJ adopted the\n16             reasoning of the [m]emo, and, as we explained\n17             in . . . La Raza, this failure is fatal.\n\n18   Id. at 84.11\n\n\n          10\n             The court did \"not reach the question of whether [the La\n     Raza] doctrine would require the disclosure of otherwise exempt\n     attorney work-product,\" as opposed to documents exempt under the\n     deliberative process exemption. Wood, 432 F.3d at 84.\n          11\n            Shermco Industries Inc. v. Secretary of Air Force, 613\n     F.2d 1314 (5th Cir. 1980) is similar. The court reversed a\n     district court's conclusion that a memorandum discussing a bid\n     award, which had been forwarded to the GAO as part of bid protest\n     proceedings, lost its deliberative character. Id. at 1320.\n     First, the court noted that \"the decision [on to whom to award\n     the bid] was not yet final.\" Id. at 1319. Second, \"even if it\n     were a final decision, these memoranda were not expressly\n     incorporated by reference into the [final decision by the Air\n     Force to award the contract]. They had been used by the Air\n     Force internally in reaching their initial conclusion that [a\n     Shermco competitor] was the lowest bidder, and they were produced\n     to the GAO in aid of their defense against Shermco's protest, but\n     they were never attached to any formal written decision by the\n     Air Force.\" Id. at 1320.\n                                     29\n\f 1             4.   The \"Working Law\" Principle.   While our previous\n\n 2   cases and the proceedings thus far in this one have largely\n\n 3   focused on the issue of whether a memorandum has been expressly\n\n 4   adopted or incorporated by reference, Sears also requires us to\n\n 5   ask whether the OLC opinion constitutes the \"working law of the\n\n 6   agency\" and therefore must be disclosed.\n\n 7             If an agency's memorandum or other document has become\n\n 8   its \"effective law and policy,\" it will be subject to disclosure\n\n 9   as the \"working law\" of the agency, Sears, 421 U.S. at 153, much\n\n10   the same as it would be if expressly adopted or incorporated by\n\n11   reference into a nonexempt document, id. at 161-62.     The Sears\n\n12   Court explained that the purposes undergirding FOIA required\n\n13   disclosure in either instance.   Compare id. at 152 (explaining\n\n14   that \"working law\" should be disclosed because \"the public is\n\n15   vitally concerned with the reasons which did supply the basis for\n\n16   an agency policy actually adopted\"), with id. at 161 (explaining\n\n17   that documents expressly adopted or incorporated should be\n\n18   disclosed in part because of \"the public interest in knowing the\n\n19   reasons for a policy actually adopted by an agency\").    As\n\n20   explained above, the \"working law\" analysis is animated by the\n\n21   affirmative provisions of FOIA, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)(A)-(C),\n\n22   and documents must be disclosed if more akin to that which is\n\n23   required by the Act to be disclosed than that which may be\n\n\n\n\n                                      30\n\f 1   withheld under Exemption 5.   Sears separately analyzed each of\n\n 2   these two means by which Exemption 5 protection may be lost.12\n\n 3             Not surprisingly given the nature of much of its\n\n 4   caseload, the D.C. Circuit has become something of a specialist\n\n 5   in the \"working law\" exception.   The circuit analyzed it at some\n\n 6   length in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep't of Energy, 617 F.2d\n\n 7   854 (D.C. Cir. 1980).   There, the plaintiff sought copies of\n\n 8   Department of Energy interpretations of its regulations,\n\n 9   specifically \"memoranda from regional counsel to auditors working\n\n10   in [the Department of Energy (\"DOE\")]'s field offices, issued in\n\n11   response to requests for interpretations of regulations within\n\n12   the context of particular facts encountered while conducting an\n\n13   audit of a firm.\"   Id. at 858.   The agency argued against\n\n14   disclosure, contending that the memoranda were not binding on the\n\n\n          12\n             The Eleventh Circuit is one of the few courts to have\n     examined the link between these two elements of Sears.\n               [D]ata \"expressly adopt[ed] or incorporate[d]\n               by reference\" means predecisional\n               deliberative material which is adopted and\n               approved by the agency as its \"effective law\n               and policy.\" By expressly adopting the\n               reasoning of her subordinate, the\n               decisionmaker has in effect converted a\n               rejected proposal into the rationale for the\n               agency's working law. As a consequence, the\n               documents are no longer considered\n               predecisional[,] for they now support and\n               explain the agency's position in the same\n               manner a postdecisional document explains an\n               agency decision.\n     Fla. House of Representatives v. Dep't of Commerce, 961 F.2d 941,\n     945 n.4 (11th Cir.) (citation omitted), cert. dismissed, 506 U.S.\n     969 (1992).\n                                     31\n\f 1   audit staff -- the staff was free to disregard the conclusions\n\n 2   reached in those memoranda.   Id. at 859.   The court disagreed.\n\n 3   It noted that the memoranda were \"at times 'amended' or\n\n 4   'rescinded,' which would hardly be necessary if the documents\n\n 5   contained merely informal suggestions to staff which could be\n\n 6   disregarded . . . .\"   Id. at 860.\n\n 7             After examining the particular role that the documents\n\n 8   played in the audit process, the court concluded that they\n\n 9             were not suggestions or recommendations as to\n10             what agency policy should be. . . . [T]he\n11             memoranda are not advice to a superior, nor\n12             are they suggested dispositions of a case, as\n13             in Grumman. They are not one step of an\n14             established adjudicatory process, which would\n15             result in a formal opinion, as were the\n16             documents held exempt in [Sears].\n17\n18   Id. at 868.\n\n19             [T]hese opinions were routinely used by\n20             agency staff as guidance in conducting their\n21             audits, and were retained and referred to as\n22             precedent. If this occurs, the agency has\n23             promulgated a body of secret law which it is\n24             actually applying in its dealings with the\n25             public but which it is attempting to protect\n26             behind a label. This we will not permit the\n27             agency to do. Tentative opinions are not\n28             relied on as precedent; they are considered\n29             further by the decisionmaker.\n\n30   Id. at 869.13\n\n\n\n\n          13\n            In Coastal States, there was no allegation by the\n     plaintiff that the memoranda had been expressly adopted or\n     incorporated by reference, suggesting that in some cases\n     disclosure is required even without public reliance on a document\n     otherwise exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.\n                                     32\n\f 1                In Public Citizen, Inc. v. Office of Management and\n\n 2   Budget, 598 F.3d 865 (D.C. Cir. 2010), the court considered the\n\n 3   plaintiff's request for documents created by the White House\n\n 4   Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") describing the\n\n 5   circumstances under which an agency might \"bypass\" OMB and submit\n\n 6   their budget materials directly to Congress.     Id. at 867.   The\n\n 7   documents at issue \"summariz[ed]\" OMB's understanding of which\n\n 8   agencies had such bypass authority and the bases for that\n\n 9   authority.    Id. at 868.    The court concluded that the documents\n\n10   did not enjoy the protection of Exemption 5 because \"[d]ocuments\n\n11   reflecting OMB's formal or informal policy on how it carries out\n\n12   its responsibilities fit comfortably within the working law\n\n13   framework.\"    Id. at 875.    As in Coastal States, the documents\n\n14   were referred to as precedent, and not part of an ongoing\n\n15   deliberative process.\n\n16                Similarly, in Tax Analysts v. IRS, 294 F.3d 71 (D.C.\n\n17   Cir. 2002), the court ordered release of IRS documents explaining\n\n18   whether certain tax exemptions applied to specific taxpayers,\n\n19   concluding that they constituted \"working law\" because their\n\n20   \"tone . . . indicate[d] that they simply explain[ed] and\n\n21   appl[ied] established policy.\"     Id. at 80-81 (internal quotation\n\n22   marks omitted).    Those documents included the phrases \"It is the\n\n23   position of the Treasury Department that\" and \"We conclude,\"\n\n24   while the exempt documents contained \"such phrases as 'We\n\n\n                                        33\n\f 1   believe' and 'We suggest.'\"   Id. at 81.     To qualify as working\n\n 2   law, \"[i]t is not necessary that the [documents] reflect the\n\n 3   final programmatic decisions of the program officers who request\n\n 4   them.    It is enough that they represent [the Office of the\n\n 5   Comptroller of the Currency]'s final legal position concerning\n\n 6   the Internal Revenue Code, tax exemptions, and proper\n\n 7   procedures.\"   Id. (emphasis in original).\n\n 8               Our Court has relatively little case law examining the\n\n 9   \"working law\" principle.   In La Raza, we made passing reference\n\n10   to Sears's conclusion that the public was \"vitally concerned\"\n\n11   with the reasons for a policy actually adopted, and that these\n\n12   reasons constituted the \"working law\" of the agency.     411 F.3d\n\n13   360.    We did so, however, in the context of explaining the\n\n14   relevance of the public adoption of the OLC memorandum at issue\n\n15   to the question of whether it should be disclosed, noting that\n\n16   \"the public can only be enlightened by knowing what the [agency]\n\n17   believes the law to be.\"   Id. (quoting Tax Analysts v. IRS, 117\n\n18   F.3d 607, 618 (D.C. Cir. 1997)).      In that context, we agreed with\n\n19   the district court's conclusion that \"[t]he Department's view\n\n20   that it may adopt a legal position while shielding from public\n\n21   view the analysis that yielded that position is offensive to\n\n22   FOIA.\"   Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n23               The question of whether a document constitutes \"working\n\n24   law,\" or has been expressly adopted or incorporated by reference,\n\n\n                                      34\n\f 1   then, are two paths to determining whether a withheld document\n\n 2   constitutes what FOIA affirmatively requires to be disclosed --\n\n 3   \"'final opinions,' 'statements of policy and interpretations\n\n 4   which have been adopted by the agency,' and 'instructions to\n\n 5   staff that affect a member of the public.'\"      Sears, 421 U.S. at\n\n 6   153 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)).     Most Exemption 5 cases are\n\n 7   not framed in this manner because it is the government's burden\n\n 8   to prove that the privilege applies, and not the plaintiff's to\n\n 9   demonstrate the documents sought fall within one of the\n\n10   enumerated section 552(a)(2) categories.     Nevertheless, the\n\n11   appropriate analysis requires us to determine whether the\n\n12   documents sought more closely resemble the type of internal\n\n13   deliberative and predecisional documents that Exemption 5 allows\n\n14   to be withheld, or the types of documents that section 552(a)(2)\n\n15   requires be disclosed.    To do that, the Supreme Court and our\n\n16   court have asked whether the documents fit within the description\n\n17   of \"working law,\" in addition to whether they have been expressly\n\n18   adopted or incorporated by reference into a nonexempt\n\n19   communication.\n\n20   B.   Analysis\n\n21              1.    The February 2004 Memorandum.   We begin our\n\n22   analysis of the status of this document, as we must with respect\n\n23   to all three memoranda at issue, by examining the process by\n\n24   which the memorandum was created.      See Tigue v. Dep't of Justice,\n\n\n                                       35\n\f 1   312 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"[W]hether a particular document\n\n 2   is exempt . . . depends not only on the intrinsic character of\n\n 3   the document itself, but also on the role it played in the\n\n 4   administrative process.\") (internal quotation marks omitted),\n\n 5   cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1056 (2003).    We do so because \"Exemption\n\n 6   5, properly construed, calls for disclosure of all opinions and\n\n 7   interpretations which embody the agency's effective law and\n\n 8   policy . . . .\"   Sears, 421 U.S. at 153 (internal quotation marks\n\n 9   omitted).\n\n10               The emails in the record indicate that USAID and HHS\n\n11   officials asked the OLC for advice on the constitutional and\n\n12   legal propriety of the implementation of the pledge requirement.\n\n13   They then incorporated that advice into their decision as to\n\n14   whether the language of the grants for HIV/AIDS and anti-\n\n15   trafficking work would in fact require \"an explicit and\n\n16   affirmative policy opposing prostitution.\"   It also appears that\n\n17   the OLC reviewed USAID's proposed grant language before the AAPD\n\n18   that contained it was issued.\n\n19               It is not disputed that the February 2004 memorandum\n\n20   was predecisional and deliberative.   See Public Citizen, 598 F.3d\n\n21   at 874 (\"We deem a document predecisional if it was generated\n\n22   before the adoption of an agency policy and deliberative if it\n\n23   reflects the give-and-take of the consultative process.\")\n\n24   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                      36\n\f 1             [A]n agency may meet its burden of proof\n 2             under the 'predecisional document' test by\n 3             demonstrating that the preparer was not the\n 4             final decisionmaker and that the contents\n 5             confirm that the document was originated to\n 6             facilitate an identifiable final agency\n 7             decision. . . . A predecisional document\n 8             will qualify as 'deliberative' provided\n 9             it . . . formed an essential link in a\n10             specified consultative process, . . .\n11             reflects the personal opinions of the writer\n12             rather than the policy of the agency,\n13             and . . . if released, would inaccurately\n14             reflect or prematurely disclose the views of\n15             the agency.\n\n16   Providence Journal Co. v. Dep't of the Army, 981 F.2d 552, 559\n\n17   (1st Cir. 1992) (citations, internal quotation marks, and\n\n18   brackets omitted).\n\n19             The \"decision\" being made by USAID and HHS was whether\n\n20   they were constitutionally bound to disregard a duly enacted\n\n21   statute's command that domestic organizations be subject to the\n\n22   pledge requirement.   Although this may not properly be referred\n\n23   to as an \"adjudication,\" it was a firm and concrete decision\n\n24   regarding the agency's policy.14        See Cmty. Television of S.\n\n\n          14\n             In this sense, the \"decision\" made differs from one in\n     which an agency considers and rejects a policy that it was never\n     required to consider or implement. In Common Cause v. IRS, 646\n     F.2d 656 (D.C. Cir. 1981), the court considered whether documents\n     related to the IRS's decision not to implement a plan it had\n     proposed, which would have disclosed \"the names of federal\n     officials who had approached the IRS about the tax matters of\n     third parties, as well as the subjects of such contacts,\" should\n     have been released per FOIA. Id. at 658. The court rejected the\n     plaintiffs' argument that the documents \"constitute[d] the\n     reasons which suppl[ied] the basis for the agency policy actually\n     adopted.\" Id. at 659. \"The proposed disclosure plan remained\n\n                                        37\n\f 1   Cal. v. Gottfried, 459 U.S. 498, 515-516 (1983) (\"[H]owever broad\n\n 2   an administrative agency's discretion in implementing a\n\n 3   regulatory scheme may be, the agency may not ignore a relevant\n\n 4   Act of Congress. . . .   [T]he agency cannot simply 'close its\n\n 5   eyes' to the existence of the statute.\" (citation omitted));\n\n 6   Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 193 (1993) (\"[A]n agency is not\n\n 7   free simply to disregard statutory responsibilities . . . .\");\n\n 8   see also Presidential Authority to Decline to Execute\n\n 9   Unconstitutional Statutes, 18 Op. O.L.C. 199, 200 (1994)\n\n10   (explaining the president's ability to decline to enforce\n\n11   statutes he views as unconstitutional); Bristol-Meyers Co. v.\n\n12   FTC, 598 F.2d 18, 25 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (concluding that an\n\n13   agency's decision not to proceed with rulemaking is analogous to\n\n\n\n     just that. Its rejection did not, therefore, constitute the\n     making of law or policy by an agency. The exchange of ideas and\n     proposals which took place within the Service with respect to the\n     proposed plan is precisely the type of communication which\n     Congress meant to protect in enacting Exemption 5.\" Id. The\n     court considered and rejected the argument that the memoranda\n     should be disclosed because they contained the \"written reasons\n     for the agency's final decision not to implement the proposed\n     plan.\" Id. \"This case differs from Sears in many important\n     respects. The present case involves the voluntary suggestion,\n     evaluation, and rejection of a proposed policy by an agency, not\n     the agency's final, unappealable decision not to pursue a\n     judicial remedy in an adversarial dispute . . . . No statute\n     demands that the IRS voluntarily disclose information about\n     third-party contacts . . . .\" Id. at 659-60. The court also\n     considered the broader implications of the plaintiffs' argument,\n     concluding that it would \"virtually eliminate the governmental\n     privilege\" as \"[e]very rejection of a proposal, no matter how\n     infeasible or insignificant, would become a 'final decision' of\n     an agency.\" Id. at 660.\n\n                                     38\n\f 1   the NLRB's non-charging decision in Sears, and thus would not\n\n 2   enjoy the protection of Exemption 5).   We find no other evidence\n\n 3   concerning this decisionmaking process in the record.\n\n 4             No one at the OLC made the decision that the pledge\n\n 5   requirement as it pertained to domestic organizations would not\n\n 6   be implemented.   As Paul Colborn, special counsel to the OLC,\n\n 7   explained to the district court by affidavit, \"OLC does not\n\n 8   purport, and in fact lacks authority, to make policy decisions.\n\n 9   OLC's legal advice and analysis informs the decisionmaking of\n\n10   Executive Branch officials on matters of policy, but OLC's legal\n\n11   advice is not itself dispositive as to any policy adopted.\"\n\n12   Decl. of Paul P. Colborn at 2, J.A. 318 (March 11, 2011).   The\n\n13   plaintiff does not submit contrary evidence suggesting that the\n\n14   OLC's recommendation was effectively binding on the agency, as in\n\n15   Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 869, or left it with \"no decision to\n\n16   make,\" as in Sears, 421 U.S. at 155.    The February Memorandum\n\n17   does not constitute \"working law,\" or \"the agency's effective law\n\n18   and policy.\"   Id. at 153.   We nonetheless conclude that the OLC's\n\n19   views were adopted by reference by USAID in nonexempt\n\n20   communications, and therefore must be disclosed.\n\n21             The first explicit reference to the OLC advice came in\n\n22   a July 22, 2004, USAID document entitled \"Guidance on the\n\n23   Definition and Use of the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund\n\n24   and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative Account.\"   There the agency\n\n\n                                      39\n\f 1   explained that the funding statute \"requires non-U.S. non-\n\n 2   governmental organizations . . . receiving HIV/AIDS funds to\n\n 3   agree that they have a policy explicitly opposing, in their\n\n 4   activities outside of the United States, prostitution and sex\n\n 5   trafficking.\"   July 22 USAID Update at 35.   In a footnote, the\n\n 6   document explained that \"[t]he Office of Legal Counsel, U.S.\n\n 7   Department of Justice in a draft opinion determined that this\n\n 8   provision only may be applied to foreign non-governmental\n\n 9   organizations and public international organizations because of\n\n10   the constitutional implications of applying it to U.S.\n\n11   organizations.\"   Id. at 35 n.10.15\n\n12             Then, in March 2005, after HHS and USAID had shifted\n\n13   their positions, tentatively deciding to apply the pledge\n\n14   requirement domestically, Randall Tobias, the USAID Global AID\n\n\n\n          15\n            Plaintiff urges us also to consider the September 20,\n     2004, letter from an OLC official to the general counsel of HHS\n     explaining that the \"tentative advice\" offered earlier was being\n     \"withdraw[n].\" Levin Letter at 1-2. Because there were\n     \"reasonable arguments\" to support the constitutionality of the\n     policy, the OLC official stated, \"we believe that HHS may\n     implement these provisions.\" Id. at 1. Because this letter was\n     neither written by a decisionmaker nor released publicly by the\n     decisionmaking agency, its relevance is limited. It does not aid\n     in establishing either express adoption or incorporation by\n     reference, and neither does it suggest that the February 2004 OLC\n     opinion was considered the \"working law\" of the agency. Rather,\n     it suggests that even after the February memorandum was sent to\n     HHS, a deliberative process continued, and advice was later\n     offered again to HHS that was also non-binding. In this sense,\n     it supports the defendant's contention that the February\n     memorandum should have been considered exempt from disclosure.\n\n                                      40\n\f 1   Administrator, made a second reference to the February\n\n 2   Memorandum.    When asked in a Congressional hearing about the\n\n 3   agency's change in positions, he explained:\n\n 4                The [OLC] . . . provided some tentative\n 5                advice initially that those restrictions\n 6                should be applied only to foreign\n 7                organizations. Sometime mid- to late-, I\n 8                think, in September of 2004, they withdrew\n 9                that earlier tentative advice and advised\n10                that that provision was intended by the\n11                Congress to apply without that limitation to\n12                both domestic organizations as well as\n13                foreign organizations. And so I'm simply\n14                following the legislation and the advice to\n15                implement that.\n\n16   Tobias Testimony, J.A. 236.16\n\n17                Thus, there were two public statements referencing the\n\n18   February 2004 memorandum -- the July 22 footnote, and the Tobias\n\n19   testimony.    We conclude that these references taken together\n\n20   establish express adoption or incorporation by reference.\n\n\n\n\n          16\n            An additional \"public\" reference was made to the February\n     2004 memorandum, in a July 2007 letter from an OLC official to\n     Congressman Henry Waxman. Waxman had requested an explanation\n     from the OLC regarding its interpretation of the pledge\n     requirement. The OLC wrote that in February 2004 it had provided\n     \"tentative advice\" to HHS and USAID that the pledge requirement\n     \"could, under the Constitution, be applied only to foreign\n     organizations acting overseas.\" Benczkowski Letter at 1. The\n     letter then went on to explain the subsequent change in advice.\n     This letter is also of limited relevance in determining whether\n     or not the February 2004 opinion should be subject to disclosure\n     because it was not authored by a decisionmaker from USAID or HHS.\n     (Again, this would be different had plaintiff adduced evidence\n     that OLC opinions were essentially binding upon the agencies.)\n\n                                       41\n\f 1             To be sure, neither the July 22 footnote nor Tobias's\n\n 2   testimony discussed at length the rationale provided by the OLC\n\n 3   for its conclusion as to the propriety of applying the pledge\n\n 4   requirement to domestic grantees.    Noting that the advice itself\n\n 5   was limited to one page in the first instance, we conclude that\n\n 6   the July 22 footnote's explanation that the pledge requirement\n\n 7   would not be enforced \"because of the constitutional implications\n\n 8   of applying it to U.S. organizations,\" July 22 USAID Update at 35\n\n 9   n.10, at least when reenforced by the Tobias reference,\n\n10   demonstrates sufficient reliance on both the conclusion and\n\n11   reasoning of the OLC memorandum to remove the protection of the\n\n12   deliberative-process exemption.17\n\n\n          17\n            In a pre-Sears case, the D.C. Circuit ordered disclosure\n     pursuant to Exemption 5 based on reasoning similar to what we\n     apply here.\n\n               We do not feel that [the agency] should be\n               required to 'operate in a fishbowl,' but by\n               the same token we do not feel that [the party\n               seeking disclosure] should be required to\n               operate in a darkroom. If the [agency] did\n               not want to expose its staff's memorandum to\n               public scrutiny it should not have stated\n               publicly in its April 11 ruling that its\n               action was based upon that memorandum, giving\n               no other reasons or basis for its action.\n               When it chose this course of action 'as a\n               matter of convenience'   the memorandum lost\n               its intra-agency status and became a public\n               record, one which must be disclosed . . . .\n\n     Am. Mail Line, Ltd. v. Gulick, 411 F.2d 696, 703 (D.C. Cir. 1969)\n     (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                     42\n\f 1             Any agency faces a political or public relations\n\n 2   calculation in deciding whether or not to reference what might\n\n 3   otherwise be a protected document in explaining the course of\n\n 4   action it has decided to take.   In many cases, as here, the\n\n 5   agency is not required to explain its reasons publicly.\n\n 6   Nonetheless, where it determines there is an advantage to doing\n\n 7   so by referencing a protected document as authoritative, it\n\n 8   cannot then shield the authority upon which it relies from\n\n 9   disclosure.\n\n10             2.   The July 2004 Memos.   As outlined above, on July\n\n11   2, 2004, OLC lawyer Lerner sent an email to HHS and USAID\n\n12   officials attaching a 30-page draft memorandum with the\n\n13   statement, \"Any comments you have would be much appreciated.\"\n\n14   Email from Lerner, \"OLC draft opinion on Sex Trafficking, AIDS\n\n15   Act grant restrictions.\"   J.A. 92 (July 2, 2004).   On July 30,\n\n16   2004, another OLC lawyer sent an updated draft of the memorandum\n\n17   to the HHS general counsel.\n\n18             On September 20, 2004, an OLC official explained in\n\n19   response to the original February inquiry from USAID and HHS as\n\n20   to the constitutionality of the pledge requirement that \"we\n\n21   believe that HHS may implement these provisions.     If the\n\n22   provisions are challenged in court, the Department stands ready\n\n23   to defend their constitutionality, in accordance with its\n\n24   longstanding practice of defending congressional enactments under\n\n\n                                      43\n\f 1   such circumstances.\"   Levin Letter at 1-2 (footnotes omitted).\n\n 2   That letter made no reference to the July OLC memos.     It offered\n\n 3   only sparse explanation of the legal basis for OLC's conclusion\n\n 4   that the pledge requirement could be defended.   Id.\n\n 5              On May 3, 2005, HHS issued a new policy outlining its\n\n 6   updated \"funding restrictions,\" which explained that \"any\n\n 7   recipient must have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and\n\n 8   sex trafficking.\"   HHS Funding Announcement, \"Increasing Access\n\n 9   to HIV Counseling and Testing (VCT) and Enhancing HIV/AIDS\n\n10   Communications, Prevention, and Care in Botswana, Lesotho, South\n\n11   Africa, Swaziland and Cote d'Ivoire\" at 10, J.A. 218 (May 3,\n\n12   2005).   The document does not explain the basis for that policy,\n\n13   nor refer to it as a change in policy.\n\n14              On June 9, 2005, USAID issued an updated AAPD that\n\n15   required domestic grantees to \"have a policy explicitly opposing\n\n16   prostitution and sex trafficking.\"   USAID AAPD 05-04,\n\n17   \"Implementation of the United States Leadership against HIV/AIDS\n\n18   Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 - Eligibility Limitation on\n\n19   the Use of Funds and Opposition to Prostitution and Sex\n\n20   Trafficking\" at 5, J.A. 225 (June 9, 2005).\n\n21              In this AAPD, USAID did state that \"[c]onsistent with\n\n22   guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice,\" USAID would \"now\n\n23   apply [the pledge requirement] to U.S. organizations as well as\n\n24   foreign organizations.\"   June 2005 AAPD at 2, J.A. 223.   Such\n\n\n                                     44\n\f 1   reference to guidance from the DOJ does not, however, indicate\n\n 2   that USAID (or HHS) adopted the reasoning of the July memoranda.\n\n 3   Nor does the fact that the agencies acted in conformity with the\n\n 4   July memoranda establish that the agencies adopted their\n\n 5   reasoning.    Grumman, 421 U.S. at 184.   \"Mere reliance of a\n\n 6   document's conclusions does not necessarily involve reliance on a\n\n 7   document's analysis: both will ordinarily be needed before a\n\n 8   court may properly find adoption or incorporation by reference.\"\n\n 9   La Raza, 411 F.3d at 358.\n\n10                When Tobias testified before Congress that USAID had\n\n11   changed its policy, he explained that the OLC's tentative advice\n\n12   had been withdrawn in mid- to late-September 2004.    See Tobias\n\n13   Testimony, J.A. 236.    That appears to be a reference to the\n\n14   September 2004 OLC letter, not to either of the July 2004 draft\n\n15   memoranda.\n\n16                On the record before us, then, Tobias's testimony\n\n17   referenced the September 2004 letter.     The lack of any specific\n\n18   reference to the July 2004 memoranda by either USAID or HHS are\n\n19   further indications that the July memoranda were in fact parts of\n\n20   the predecisional and deliberative process that yielded the\n\n21   September 2004 letter.\n\n22                The July 2007 letter to Congressman Waxman also\n\n23   explained the change in policy solely by reference to the\n\n24   September 2004 letter.    Although the July 2007 letter was not\n\n\n                                       45\n\f 1   written by a decisionmaker and therefore could not have served as\n\n 2   a basis for express adoption or incorporation by reference, it\n\n 3   serves as evidence that it was the September 2004 letter, and not\n\n 4   the July 2004 draft memoranda, that led to HHS and USAID's\n\n 5   decisions to implement the pledge requirement with respect to\n\n 6   U.S.-based organizations.\n\n 7             In sum, there is no evidence that the USAID or HHS\n\n 8   based its change in policy on the draft memoranda it seeks.    We\n\n 9   therefore cannot conclude, as did the district court, that either\n\n10   agency expressly adopted or incorporated by reference these\n\n11   drafts in explaining their policy change.   In such a\n\n12   circumstance, ordering release of these never-finalized memoranda\n\n13   would fail to \"safeguard and promote agency decisionmaking\n\n14   processes\" by, for example, not \"protect[ing] against confusing\n\n15   the issues and misleading the public by dissemination of\n\n16   documents suggesting reasons and rationales for a course of\n\n17   action which were not in fact the ultimate reasons for the\n\n18   agency's action,\" and failing to \"assure that subordinates within\n\n19   an agency will feel free to provide the decisionmaker with their\n\n20   uninhibited opinions and recommendations without fear of later\n\n21   being subject to public ridicule or criticism . . . .\"\n\n22   Providence Journal, 981 F.2d at 557 (quoting Coastal States, 617\n\n23   F.2d at 866); see also Grumman, 421 U.S. at 184-85 (\"[If] the\n\n24   evidence utterly fails to support the conclusion that the\n\n\n                                    46\n\f 1   reasoning in the reports is adopted by the Board as its\n\n 2   reasoning, even when it agrees with the conclusion of a\n\n 3   report, . . . the reports are not final opinions and do fall\n\n 4   within Exemption 5.\").\n\n 5               We conclude that the district court erred in ordering\n\n 6   disclosure of the July memoranda because there is insufficient\n\n 7   evidence that those memoranda were expressly adopted or\n\n 8   incorporated by reference by USAID, or became the \"working law\"\n\n 9   of the agency, sufficient to remove the deliberative-process\n\n10   protection.\n\n11               III.   Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n12               The defendants argue that even if the February 2004\n\n13   memorandum is otherwise subject to disclosure, it is protected\n\n14   from such disclosure by the attorney-client privilege, Defs.' Br.\n\n15   at 51-52, which is encompassed by Exemption 5, La Raza, 411 F.3d\n\n16   at 360.18   \"The attorney-client privilege protects communications\n\n17   (1) between a client and his or her attorney (2) that are\n\n\n\n          18\n             In its reply brief, the defendants for the first time\n     argue that the plaintiff has waived its argument that the\n     February 2004 document is not protected by the attorney-client\n     privilege because the argument was not raised below. Defs.'\n     Reply at 20-21. A review of the plaintiff's motion for summary\n     judgment establishes otherwise. See Mem. in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot.\n     for Summ. J., Brennan Center v.

Indeed, the district court\n     considered this argument, concluding that the defendants'\n     argument that the attorney-client privilege protected that\n     document from disclosure \"must fail.\"\n\n                                       47\n\f 1   intended to be, and in fact were, kept confidential (3) for the\n\n 2   purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance.\"   United\n\n 3   States v. Mejia, 655 F.3d 126, 132 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 132\n\n 4   S. Ct. 553 (2011).   \"[T]he attorney-client privilege protects\n\n 5   most confidential communications between government counsel and\n\n 6   their clients that are made for the purpose of obtaining or\n\n 7   providing legal advice.\"   In re County of Erie, 473 F.3d 413, 418\n\n 8   (2d Cir. 2007).\n\n 9             In La Raza, we explained that \"[l]ike the deliberative\n\n10   process privilege, the attorney-client privilege may not be\n\n11   invoked to protect a document adopted as, or incorporated by\n\n12   reference into, an agency's policy.\"    411 F.3d at 360.   The\n\n13   reasons underlying the absence of Exemption 5 protection for such\n\n14   a document otherwise covered by the deliberative-process\n\n15   exemption also underlie the agency’s loss of the protection of\n\n16   the attorney-client privilege.\n\n17             [O]nce an agency adopts or incorporates [a]\n18             document, frank communication will not be\n19             inhibited. Indeed, once an attorney's (or\n20             employee's) recommendation becomes agency\n21             law, the agency is then responsible for\n22             defending that policy, and the attorney (or\n23             employee) 'will generally be encouraged\n24             rather than discouraged' by public knowledge\n25             that their policy suggestions or legal\n26             analysis have been adopted by the agency.\"\n27\n28   Id. (quoting Sears, 421 U.S. at 161).    As we explained, \"We\n\n29   cannot allow the Department to make public use of the Memorandum\n\n\n\n                                      48\n\f 1   when it serves the Department's ends but claim the attorney-\n\n 2   client privilege when it does not.\"   Id. at 361.\n\n 3              As with respect to the lawyer-client privilege in other\n\n 4   contexts, \"it is vital to [such] a claim . . . that the\n\n 5   communications between client and attorney were made in\n\n 6   confidence and have been maintained in confidence.\"   Mejia, 655\n\n 7   F.3d at 134 (quoting In re Horowitz, 482 F.2d 72, 81-82 (2d Cir.\n\n 8   1973)).   And \"[c]ourts have found waiver by implication when a\n\n 9   client testifies concerning portions of the attorney-client\n\n10   communication, . . . and when a client asserts reliance on an\n\n11   attorney's advice as an element of a claim or defense . . . . \"\n\n12   In re County of Erie, 546 F.3d 222, 228 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal\n\n13   quotation marks omitted).   A party's reliance on an otherwise\n\n14   privileged communication to assert a claim or defense is similar\n\n15   to the type of express adoption or incorporation by reference\n\n16   that vitiates Exemption 5 protection -- in either case the party\n\n17   cannot invoke that relied-upon authority and then shield it from\n\n18   public view.   The references to the February 2004 memorandum that\n\n19   served to remove the deliberative-process privilege thus also\n\n20   constitute waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\n\n21              On this score, the defendants invoke the same argument\n\n22   as they did with regard to the deliberative-process exemption --\n\n23   that the instances of express adoption or incorporation cited by\n\n24   the plaintiff are not sufficient to withdraw the protection of\n\n\n                                     49\n\f 1   Exemption 5.    We have concluded to the contrary with respect to\n\n 2   the deliberative process exemption for the reasons set forth\n\n 3   above.\n\n 4                The defendants urge us to revisit our holding in La\n\n 5   Raza, contending that there we misconstrued Sears.     La Raza is\n\n 6   the law of this Circuit and this panel, acting as a panel cannot\n\n 7   change it.    See, e.g., City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop,\n\n 8   LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 131 n.18 (2d Cir. 2011) (acknowledging that we\n\n 9   are bound by the law of the Circuit as established by one or more\n\n10   previous panel decisions); European Cmty. v. RJR Nabisco, Inc.,\n\n11   424 F.3d 175, 179 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"We are bound by the decisions\n\n12   of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by\n\n13   an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court.\")\n\n14   (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1092\n\n15   (2006).\n\n16                We note nonetheless that the government focuses on the\n\n17   Sears Court's statement that \"[t]echnically, of course, if a\n\n18   document could be, for example, both a 'final opinion' and an\n\n19   intra-agency memorandum within Exemption 5, it would be\n\n20   nondisclosable, since the Act 'does not apply' to documents\n\n21   falling within any of the exemptions.\"    421 U.S. at 154 n.21.\n\n22   That footnote was employed in the context of the Court's\n\n23   observation that \"Exemption 5 can never apply\" to \"working law.\"\n\n24   Id. at 153-54.    By prefacing its comment with the term\n\n\n                                       50\n\f 1   \"technically\" the Court suggested that this observation in Sears\n\n 2   left the holding of Sears undisturbed –- that when what would\n\n 3   otherwise be an exempt memorandum becomes non-exempt because of\n\n 4   its status as \"working law,\" or through express adoption or\n\n 5   incorporation by reference, for all practical purposes it falls\n\n 6   outside of Exemption 5.   We are, in other words, inclined to\n\n 7   agree with the plaintiff that \"[t]he text [of Sears] makes clear\n\n 8   that the footnote is contemplating a logical impossibility.\"\n\n 9   Pl.'s Br. at 52.\n\n10             The government points to Federal Open Market Committee\n\n11   v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979), for further support.    Merrill\n\n12   recognized an Exemption 5 privilege for \"confidential commercial\n\n13   information,\" but noted that \"[i]t should be obvious that the\n\n14   kind of mutually exclusive relationship between final opinions\n\n15   and statements of policy, on one hand, and predecisional\n\n16   communications, on the other, does not necessarily exist between\n\n17   final statements of policy and other Exemption 5 privileges.\"\n\n18   Id. at 360 n.23.   But La Raza establishes that when a document\n\n19   has been relied upon sufficiently to waive the deliberative-\n\n20   process privilege, that reliance can have the same effect on the\n\n21   attorney-client privilege.   411 F.3d at 360-61.   We conclude that\n\n22   it does so here.\n\n\n\n\n                                     51\n\f1                              CONCLUSION\n\n2             For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant\n\n3   of summary judgment for the plaintiff is affirmed with respect to\n\n4   the February 2004 memorandum, and reversed and remanded with\n\n5   respect to the July memoranda with instructions to the district\n\n6   court to enter summary judgment for the defendants as to them.\n\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\f",

We affirmed the\n     district court's decision to preliminarily enjoin that provision\n     of the Leadership Act concluding that it \"falls well beyond what\n     the Supreme Court and this Court have upheld as permissible\n     conditions on the receipt of government funds [because it] does\n     not merely require recipients of Leadership Act funds to refrain\n     from certain conduct, but goes substantially further and compels\n     recipients to espouse the government's viewpoint.\" 651 F.3d at\n     223.\n\n                                      4\n\f 1   and referred it to USAID and the OLC, from which, it had\n\n 2   determined, many of the requested documents originated.2    The OLC\n\n 3   denied the original request in its entirety, and denied the\n\n 4   request referred from HHS except as to a nine-page letter\n\n 5   commenting on the TVPRA that was already in the public record,\n\n 6   which was sent in September 2003 from a DOJ official to\n\n 7   Representative James Sensenbrenner, then-Chairman of the House\n\n 8   Judiciary Committee.   USAID did not respond to the referred\n\n 9   request, and denied the original request in its entirety.    The\n\n10   Brennan Center appealed the various denials with those agencies,\n\n11   and the agencies affirmed their denials, leaving the Brennan\n\n12   Center with the option of pursuing its claims in federal court.\n\n13   See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).\n\n14             On October 15, 2009, the Brennan Center brought this\n\n15   action in the United States District Court for the Southern\n\n16   District of New York broadly alleging that USAID, OLC, and HHS\n\n17   had violated FOIA by failing to identify responsive documents,\n\n18   failing to disclose records, failing to disclose reasonably\n\n19   segregable portions of otherwise withheld documents, and, with\n\n20   respect to the OLC and USAID, failing to respond to FOIA\n\n\n          2\n            HHS located 231 pages of responsive documents, and\n     withheld 46 pages in their entirety pursuant to FOIA's\n     deliberative process exemption, see 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5). It\n     determined that of the remaining documents, 177 pages originated\n     with the OLC, and 8 pages with USAID, and referred the Brennan\n     Center's request to those agencies.\n\n                                      5\n\f 1   requests.

The district court judge met with\n\n 7   the defendants on April 22, 2010, and May 5, 2010, and asked them\n\n 8   to consider disclosing some or all of the documents in order to\n\n 9   avoid further litigation.   In response, the defendants released\n\n10   heavily redacted versions of several documents and associated\n\n11   emails.   See Order, Brennan Center v.

To the\n\n13   extent that internal agency emails and memoranda are referenced\n\n14   in this opinion, they are part of the record by virtue of this\n\n15   disclosure.\n\n16               On January 28, 2011, the plaintiff moved for summary\n\n17   judgment seeking release of the entirety of three memoranda that\n\n18   it alleges were improperly withheld pursuant to FOIA's \"Exemption\n\n19   5,\" which shields from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency\n\n20   memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a\n\n21   party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\"     5\n\n22   U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).

The\n\n 3   three withheld documents that are the targets of the Brennan\n\n 4   Center's objections are: (1) a one-page memorandum provided by\n\n 5   the OLC to HHS and USAID on or about February 17, 2004, regarding\n\n 6   the constitutionality of the pledge requirement (the \"February\n\n 7   Memorandum\"); (2) a July 2, 2004, draft of a formal, but never-\n\n 8   finalized, OLC opinion addressing the constitutionality of the\n\n 9   pledge requirement (the \"July 2 Memorandum\"); and (3) a July 29,\n\n10   2004, draft memorandum similar to the July 2 Memo (the \"July 29\n\n11   Memorandum\").\n\n12             The February Memorandum\n\n13             On February 12, 2004, the General Counsel of HHS asked\n\n14   the OLC to provide, on a \"very short timeframe,\" \"advice on the\n\n15   constitutional issues raised by the grant restrictions under the\n\n16   two statutes.\"   Memorandum from Renee Lettow Lerner at 2, J.A. 55\n\n17   (March 12, 2004) (describing HHS request).\n\n18             In response, on February 17, Renee Lettow Lerner, an\n\n19   OLC attorney, sent an email to HHS Deputy General Counsel Paula\n\n20   M.

The document, the first of the three memoranda\n\n 6   that are the subject of this litigation, was supplied to the\n\n 7   plaintiff during the course of this litigation with all analysis\n\n 8   redacted.\n\n 9               In an email later that evening, Stannard conveyed\n\n10   \"draft language for the HIV/AIDS and trafficking grant\n\n11   awards/agreements\" to Lerner.   Email from Stannard, \"Re: OLC's\n\n12   advice on grant announcements,\" J.A. 40 (Feb. 17, 2004).   She\n\n13   also sent a copy to the USAID employee.   Again, a copy of the\n\n14   email was supplied to the Brennan Center, but most of it was\n\n15   redacted.   Lerner replied to Stannard the following day, February\n\n16   18, in an email that was, in effect, withheld from disclosure,\n\n17   i.e., it is redacted in its entirety.\n\n18               On February 19, a USAID employee, acting on behalf of\n\n19   USAID employee Gardner, sent that agency's revised \"Acquisition &\n\n20   Assistance Policy Directive\" (\"AAPD\")4 to Lerner, Stannard, and\n\n\n     discrepancy.\n          4\n             \"AAPDs serve as official sources for the latest updates\n     in acquisition and assistance (A&A) policy and requirements.\n     AAPDs provide information of significance including, but not\n     limited to, advance notification of changes or implementation of\n\n                                       8\n\f 1   other HHS and State Department employees.   Later that day,\n\n 2   Stannard and HHS employee Demetrios Kouzoukas sent \"a final draft\n\n 3   of the language\" to Lerner, Gardner, and other HHS, USAID, and\n\n 4   State Department employees, and thanked those on the email chain\n\n 5   for their comments.

The February 26 AAPD included the\n\n14   pledge requirement only for \"Non-U.S. Non-Governmental\n\n15   Organizations and Public International Organizations.\"   Id. at 5.\n\n16   That meant that any grant to a foreign organization would include\n\n\n     new requirements to A&A regulations and procedures.\" Acquisition\n     and Assistance Policy Directives (AAPDs) and Contract Information\n     Bulletins (CIBs), available at\n     http://transition.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/\n     (last visited August 3, 2012). \"Acquisition refers to obtaining\n     goods and services, through various types of contracts, for the\n     use or benefit of the Agency.

Another version of that draft, dated July 29, the third\n\n14   document that the plaintiff contends must be disclosed, was\n\n15   emailed to HHS on July 30.   In the record on appeal, both draft\n\n16   opinions are redacted with the exception of a date, title, and\n\n17   introductory sentence.   After an in camera review, however, the\n\n18   district court concluded that contrary to the OLC's view conveyed\n\n19   in February, those drafts counseled implementation of the pledge\n\n20   requirement for both U.S.-based and foreign organizations.5\n\n\n\n          5\n           Despite the July 2004 memoranda that opined that the\n     pledge requirement could constitutionally be applied to domestic\n     activities, in July and August, USAID continued to advise that\n     the requirement would only be applied to foreign organizations,\n     as evidenced by the July 22 USAID Update and August 3 AAPD.\n\n                                     11\n\f 1   Brennan Center v.

A February 28, 2005,\n     Wall Street Journal article explained that \"[t]he Bush\n     Administration had previously applied the requirement only to\n     overseas groups because the Justice Department initially advised\n     that it would be an unconstitutional violation of free speech to\n     demand that American grant applicants support Mr. Bush's policy.\n     But the Justice Department reversed itself last fall.\" Michael\n     M. Phillips, Bush Ties Money for AIDS Work to a Policy Pledge,\n     WALL ST. J., Feb. 28, 2005. A May 18, 2005, Washington Post\n     article similarly said that \"[i]nitially, the policy was applied\n     only to foreign organizations operating overseas. U.S.-based\n     charities were exempt because the Justice Department believed\n     that forcing them to make the declaration might infringe their\n     First Amendment right of free speech.\" David Brown, U.S. Backs\n     Off Stipulation on AIDS Funds, WASH.

The Scope of Exemption 5.   Although Exemption 5 is\n\n20   set out by statute, it is the Supreme Court's decision in Sears\n\n\n          7\n           The litigation posture of Exemption 5 cases, the present\n     one being no exception, focuses on the government proving the\n     applicability of an exemption rather than the plaintiff proving\n     applicability of one of the affirmative provisions because the\n     burden rests on the government to shield documents from\n     disclosure otherwise to be disclosed under FOIA.\n\n                                      19\n\f 1   that delineates the limits of that exemption, and which has been\n\n 2   the starting point for all of our discussions of it, as it is in\n\n 3   this case.\n\n 4                The Sears Court explained the circumstances under which\n\n 5   a document otherwise subject to Exemption 5 might lose its\n\n 6   protection.    The plaintiff had submitted a FOIA request for\n\n 7   \"Advice and Appeals Memoranda\" prepared by the General Counsel of\n\n 8   the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") discussing potential\n\n 9   charges against various employers.     421 U.S. at 142-43.\n\n10                The Court began by analyzing the process by which such\n\n11   memoranda were created.    Typically, the NLRB General Counsel\n\n12   required certain charging decisions from its regional offices\n\n13   first to be submitted to its central office so that the agency\n\n14   had an \"opportunity to formulate a coherent policy, and to\n\n15   achieve some measure of uniformity, in enforcing the labor laws.\"\n\n16   Id. at 141.    A regional director submitted a memorandum that\n\n17   \"set[] forth the facts of the case, a statement of the issues on\n\n18   which advice [was] sought, and a recommendation.\"    Id.     The\n\n19   General Counsel's office then assigned the case to a staff\n\n20   attorney who assisted in preparing the \"Advice and Appeals\n\n21   Memorandum\" that \"briefly summarize[d] the facts, . . . set forth\n\n22   the . . . legal or policy issue submitted together with a\n\n23   detailed legal rationale, and contain[ed] instructions for the\n\n24   final processing of the case.\"    Id. at 142 (internal quotation\n\n                                       20\n\f 1   marks omitted).   Based on that memorandum, the regional director\n\n 2   then decided whether or not to prosecute the charge.   Id.\n\n 3               The Court observed that while \"the public is vitally\n\n 4   concerned with the reasons . . . [for] an agency policy actually\n\n 5   adopted,\" or \"those communications which explain [a] decision,\"\n\n 6   \"[t]he public is only marginally concerned with reasons\n\n 7   supporting a policy which an agency has rejected, or with reasons\n\n 8   which might have supplied, but did not supply, the basis for a\n\n 9   policy which was actually adopted on a different ground.\"    Id. at\n\n10   152.\n\n11               The reasons for a decision made by an agency, or a\n\n12   policy actually adopted, however, \"constitute the 'working law'\n\n13   of the agency.\"   Id. at 153.   Therefore, the exemption \"properly\n\n14   construed, calls for 'disclosure of all opinions and\n\n15   interpretations which embody the agency's effective law and\n\n16   policy, and the withholding of all papers which reflect the\n\n17   agency's group thinking in the process of working out its policy\n\n18   and determining what its law shall be.'\"   Id. (quoting Kenneth\n\n19   Culp Davis, The Information Act: A Preliminary Analysis, 34 U.\n\n20   Chi. L. Rev. 761, 797 (1967)) (some internal quotation marks\n\n21   omitted).   \"This conclusion is powerfully supported by . . .\n\n22   [t]he affirmative portion of the Act, [which] expressly\n\n23   requir[es] indexing of 'final opinions,' 'statements of policy\n\n24   and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency,' and\n\n                                      21\n\f 1   'instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.'\"8\n\n 2   Sears, 421 U.S. at 153 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)).       Those\n\n 3   affirmative provisions, it reasoned, \"represent[] a strong\n\n 4   congressional aversion to secret agency law, and represent[] an\n\n 5   affirmative congressional purpose to require disclosure of\n\n 6   documents which have the force and effect of law.\"      Id. (internal\n\n 7   quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted).\n\n 8                  The Court concluded that NLRB memoranda that advised no\n\n 9   action be taken, and thereby ended the inquiry and left the\n\n10   responsible regional director with \"no decision to make,\" fell\n\n11   outside of Exemption 5 and therefore had to be disclosed.      Id. at\n\n12   155.       They \"are precisely the kind of agency law in which the\n\n13   public is so vitally interested and which Congress sought to\n\n14   prevent the agency from keeping secret.\"      Id. at 156.\n\n15                  After determining that these memoranda were the type of\n\n16   \"agency law\" which it concluded were non-exempt, the Court then\n\n17   explained that \"[f]or essentially the same reasons, these\n\n18   memoranda are 'final opinions' made in the 'adjudication of\n\n\n            8\n             The Sears Court subsumed into its \"working law\" or\n     \"agency law\" analysis all three of section 552(a)(2)'s\n     affirmative provisions, and did not, for example, discuss \"final\n     opinions\" separately from \"statements of policy and\n     interpretations which have been adopted by the agency.\" In many\n     cases, as in Sears, the line between a \"final opinion\" and a\n     \"statement of policy and interpretation[]\" is blurry, and the\n     \"working law\" analysis therefore provides an interpretation aimed\n     at aiding courts when presented with documents that fall between\n     these categories.\n\n                                         22\n\f 1   cases' . . . pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)(A),\" and thus must\n\n 2   be disclosed.   Id. at 158.   By contrast, the reasoning and\n\n 3   conclusions behind memoranda that advise prosecution \"will come\n\n 4   out in the course of litigation before the Board; and . . . the\n\n 5   'law' with respect to these cases will ultimately be made not by\n\n 6   the General Counsel but by the Board or the courts.\"   Id. at 160.\n\n 7               The Court then addressed a separate path towards the\n\n 8   loss of Exemption 5's protection –- whether predecisional and\n\n 9   deliberative documents fall outside of that exemption if\n\n10   \"adopt[ed] or incorporate[d] by reference\" into \"what would\n\n11   otherwise be a final opinion,\" in other words, in a document that\n\n12   has already been found to be nonexempt.   The Court concluded that\n\n13   they did.\n\n14               The probability that an agency employee will\n15               be inhibited from freely advising a\n16               decisionmaker for fear that his advice if\n17               adopted, will become public is slight.\n18               First, when adopted, the reasoning becomes\n19               that of the agency and becomes its\n20               responsibility to defend. Second, agency\n21               employees will generally be encouraged rather\n22               than discouraged by public knowledge that\n23               their policy suggestions have been adopted by\n24               the agency. Moreover, the public interest in\n25               knowing the reasons for a policy actually\n26               adopted by an agency supports . . . [the\n27               decision to order disclosure]. Thus, we hold\n28               that, if an agency chooses expressly to adopt\n29               or incorporate by reference an intra-agency\n30               memorandum previously covered by Exemption 5\n31               in what would otherwise be a final opinion,\n32               that memorandum may be withheld only on the\n33               ground that it falls within the coverage of\n34               some exemption other than Exemption 5.\n\n\n                                      23\n\f 1   Id.   at 161 (emphasis in original).\n\n 2              On the same day that the Supreme Court decided Sears,\n\n 3   it also decided Renegotiation Board v. Grumman Aircraft\n\n 4   Engineering Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109242\"><a href=\"/opinion/109242/renegotiation-bd-v-grumman-aircraft-engineering-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975), a companion case further\n\n 5   exploring the limits of Exemption 5.

After exhaustively reviewing the process by which\n\n10   these documents were created, the Court explained that if a\n\n11   \"Division Report\" was created recommending a course of action, it\n\n12   would be given to the Renegotiation Board for its review.    Id. at\n\n13   176-77.   But \"[n]either the Board nor any of its members were\n\n14   bound by any prior recommendations.    The Board was free, after\n\n15   discussion, to reject the proposed conclusion reached in the\n\n16   Division Report, or to accept it for reasons other than those set\n\n17   forth in the report.\"    Id. at 177.   Similarly, although under a\n\n18   different process, a \"Regional Board Report\" could be created.\n\n19   Id. at 178-79.\n\n20              The Court concluded that these reports were not subject\n\n21   to disclosure because \"the evidence utterly fails to support the\n\n22   conclusion that the reasoning in the reports is adopted by the\n\n23   Board as its reasoning, even when it agrees with the conclusion\n\n24   of a report.\"    Id. at 184 (emphasis in original).   The reports\n\n25   themselves had \"no operative effect,\" and therefore could not be\n                                       24\n\f 1   characterized as \"final opinions,\" within the meaning of FOIA's\n\n 2   affirmative disclosure provisions.    Id. at 187.   \"[A]bsent\n\n 3   indication that [a report's] reasoning has been adopted, there is\n\n 4   little public interest in [its] disclosure.\"   Id. at 186.      The\n\n 5   reports therefore retained their protection under Exemption 5.\n\n 6             The Grumman Court acknowledged that some agency\n\n 7   decisions may simply not have any accompanying public rationale.\n\n 8   \"The effect of this decision [then] is that, in those cases in\n\n 9   which [the Renegotiation Board does not offer a summary of its\n\n10   reasoning], the public will be largely uninformed as to the basis\n\n11   for [its] decisions.\"   Id. at 191.\n\n12             The Freedom of Information Act imposes no\n13             independent obligation on agencies to write\n14             opinions. It simply requires them to\n15             disclose the opinions which they do write.\n16             If the public interest suffers by reason of\n17             the failure of the Board to explain some of\n18             its decisions, the remedy is for Congress to\n19             require it to do so. It is not for us to\n20             require disclosure of documents, under the\n21             purported authority of the Act, which are not\n22             final opinions, which do not accurately set\n23             forth the reasons for the Board's decisions,\n24             and the disclosure of which would impinge on\n25             the Board's predecisional processes.\n\n26   Id. (citation omitted).\n\n27             Although Grumman did not explain its reasoning using\n\n28   the same terminology as Sears, it also provided two somewhat\n\n29   distinct paths through which Exemption 5's protections could be\n\n30   lost: (1) if the reports had \"operative effect\" and were\n\n31   therefore akin to \"final opinions\" –- the equivalent of \"working\n\n                                     25\n\f 1   law\" in Sears's language; or (2) if the reports' reasoning and\n\n 2   conclusions had been adopted by the Board in issuing its own\n\n 3   decision –- the equivalent of \"express adoption or incorporation\n\n 4   by reference\" in Sears.\n\n 5             3.    Express Adoption or Incorporation by Reference.    We\n\n 6   have had several occasions on which to apply the Supreme Court's\n\n 7   Exemption 5 jurisprudence, in particular Sears's \"express\n\n 8   adoption\" or \"incorporation by reference\" holding, on which the\n\n 9   district court relied.    The most relevant for present purposes\n\n10   was our decision in La Raza.    There we considered whether the\n\n11   FOIA required disclosure of an OLC memorandum prepared for the\n\n12   DOJ on the subject of whether state and local law enforcement\n\n13   officials could lawfully enforce certain provisions of federal\n\n14   immigration law.   La Raza, 411 F.3d at 352.   The DOJ argued that\n\n15   \"it did not expressly adopt or incorporate the OLC memorandum\"\n\n16   into a final opinion, and it was therefore protected by the\n\n17   deliberative-process exemption, or the attorney-client privilege.\n\n18   Id.\n\n19             Since 1996, the DOJ had been of the view that state and\n\n20   local law enforcement could not enforce the civil provisions of\n\n21   federal immigration law -- \"such as overstaying one's visa or\n\n22   entering the United States without proper documentation.\"   Id. at\n\n23   352-53 & n.1.   The OLC had issued a memorandum supporting this\n\n24   position, which it had released publicly.   Id. at 353.\n\n\n                                      26\n\f 1             In 2002, under a new presidential administration, the\n\n 2   DOJ changed its policy.   Id.   Then-Attorney General John Ashcroft\n\n 3   announced an immigration initiative employing state and local\n\n 4   agencies to enforce specified civil provisions of federal\n\n 5   immigration law.   In a June 5, 2002, press conference explaining\n\n 6   the new initiative, the Attorney General reported that \"[OLC] has\n\n 7   concluded that this narrow, limited mission we are asking state\n\n 8   and local police to undertake voluntarily –- arresting aliens who\n\n 9   have violated . . . civil provisions that render an alien\n\n10   deportable [–-] is within the inherent authority of the states.\"\n\n11   Id.\n\n12             On March 11, 2003, General Ashcroft wrote a letter to\n\n13   an organization that had expressed an interest in the matter\n\n14   explaining that \"[OLC] previously opined that state and local law\n\n15   enforcement officials have inherent authority to make arrests for\n\n16   criminal immigration law violations generally.\"     Id.   At least\n\n17   three other letters from the Attorney General and an Acting\n\n18   Assistant Attorney General containing similar language were\n\n19   submitted to members of Congress.     Id. at 354.   And in June 2003,\n\n20   another member of the Attorney General's office, speaking to a\n\n21   group of local and state police department officials who were\n\n22   part of an FBI advisory board, offered a detailed explanation of\n\n23   the policy in which he repeatedly referenced the OLC's advice.\n\n24   Id. at 354-55.\n\n\n                                      27\n\f 1               We concluded that the \"repeated references\" made by the\n\n 2   Attorney General and high-ranking DOJ officials to the document\n\n 3   \"demonstrate[d] that the Department regarded the [m]emorandum as\n\n 4   the exclusive statement of, and justification for, its new\n\n 5   policy . . . .\"   Id. at 357.   The DOJ thus \"made a practice of\n\n 6   using the OLC Memorandum to justify and explain the Department's\n\n 7   policy and to assure the public and the very state and local\n\n 8   government officials who would be asked to implement the new\n\n 9   policy that the policy was legally sound.\"    Id. at 358.    The\n\n10   memorandum was, indeed, the \"primary legal authority justifying\n\n11   and driving\" the change in policy.9   Id.\n\n12               We thus concluded that the document had been expressly\n\n13   adopted or incorporated by reference, and ordered it to be\n\n14   released.   Id.\n\n15               Our decision in Wood v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir.\n\n16   2005), rested on a rationale similar to that employed by the\n\n17   Supreme Court in Grumman.    There, a reporter sought disclosure of\n\n18   a memorandum prepared by DOJ trial attorneys related to an\n\n19   investigation of FBI agents alleged to have lied in affidavits\n\n20   supporting arrest warrant applications.     Id. at 80.   We affirmed\n\n\n\n          9\n           Referring to Grumman, we noted that \"there must be\n     evidence that an agency has actually adopted or incorporated by\n     reference the document at issue; mere speculation will not\n     suffice.\" La Raza, 411 F.3d at 359 (emphasis in original). We\n     also observed that \"a casual reference to a privileged document\n     does not necessarily imply that an agency agrees with the\n     reasoning contained in those documents.\" Id.\n                                     28\n\f 1   the district court's conclusion that the memorandum was properly\n\n 2   withheld under the work-product privilege pursuant to Exemption\n\n 3   5,10 and had not been incorporated by reference or expressly\n\n 4   adopted by the agency.   Id. at 84.\n\n 5             The plaintiff had argued that a note on the memorandum\n\n 6   by a high-ranking DOJ official indicating that he would decline\n\n 7   prosecution constituted express adoption or incorporation by\n\n 8   reference of the memorandum itself.   But, we said:\n\n 9             This brief notation does not indicate that\n10             DOJ adopted the reasoning of the . . .\n11             [m]emo. Neither [the endorsing official] nor\n12             any other high-level DOJ officials made any\n13             public references to the . . . [m]emo. There\n14             is no evidence in the record from which it\n15             could be inferred that DOJ adopted the\n16             reasoning of the [m]emo, and, as we explained\n17             in . . . La Raza, this failure is fatal.\n\n18   Id. at 84.11\n\n\n          10\n             The court did \"not reach the question of whether [the La\n     Raza] doctrine would require the disclosure of otherwise exempt\n     attorney work-product,\" as opposed to documents exempt under the\n     deliberative process exemption.

The court reversed a\n     district court's conclusion that a memorandum discussing a bid\n     award, which had been forwarded to the GAO as part of bid protest\n     proceedings, lost its deliberative character. Id. at 1320.\n     First, the court noted that \"the decision [on to whom to award\n     the bid] was not yet final.\" Id. at 1319. Second, \"even if it\n     were a final decision, these memoranda were not expressly\n     incorporated by reference into the [final decision by the Air\n     Force to award the contract]. They had been used by the Air\n     Force internally in reaching their initial conclusion that [a\n     Shermco competitor] was the lowest bidder, and they were produced\n     to the GAO in aid of their defense against Shermco's protest, but\n     they were never attached to any formal written decision by the\n     Air Force.\" Id. at 1320.\n                                     29\n\f 1             4.   The \"Working Law\" Principle.   While our previous\n\n 2   cases and the proceedings thus far in this one have largely\n\n 3   focused on the issue of whether a memorandum has been expressly\n\n 4   adopted or incorporated by reference, Sears also requires us to\n\n 5   ask whether the OLC opinion constitutes the \"working law of the\n\n 6   agency\" and therefore must be disclosed.\n\n 7             If an agency's memorandum or other document has become\n\n 8   its \"effective law and policy,\" it will be subject to disclosure\n\n 9   as the \"working law\" of the agency, Sears, 421 U.S. at 153, much\n\n10   the same as it would be if expressly adopted or incorporated by\n\n11   reference into a nonexempt document, id. at 161-62.     The Sears\n\n12   Court explained that the purposes undergirding FOIA required\n\n13   disclosure in either instance.   Compare id. at 152 (explaining\n\n14   that \"working law\" should be disclosed because \"the public is\n\n15   vitally concerned with the reasons which did supply the basis for\n\n16   an agency policy actually adopted\"), with id. at 161 (explaining\n\n17   that documents expressly adopted or incorporated should be\n\n18   disclosed in part because of \"the public interest in knowing the\n\n19   reasons for a policy actually adopted by an agency\").    As\n\n20   explained above, the \"working law\" analysis is animated by the\n\n21   affirmative provisions of FOIA, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)(A)-(C),\n\n22   and documents must be disclosed if more akin to that which is\n\n23   required by the Act to be disclosed than that which may be\n\n\n\n\n                                      30\n\f 1   withheld under Exemption 5.   Sears separately analyzed each of\n\n 2   these two means by which Exemption 5 protection may be lost.12\n\n 3             Not surprisingly given the nature of much of its\n\n 4   caseload, the D.C. Circuit has become something of a specialist\n\n 5   in the \"working law\" exception.   The circuit analyzed it at some\n\n 6   length in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep't of Energy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n <span class=\"page\">7</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   854 (D.C. Cir. 1980).   There, the plaintiff sought copies of\n\n 8   Department of Energy interpretations of its regulations,\n\n 9   specifically \"memoranda from regional counsel to auditors working\n\n10   in [the Department of Energy (\"DOE\")]'s field offices, issued in\n\n11   response to requests for interpretations of regulations within\n\n12   the context of particular facts encountered while conducting an\n\n13   audit of a firm.\"   Id. at 858.   The agency argued against\n\n14   disclosure, contending that the memoranda were not binding on the\n\n\n          12\n             The Eleventh Circuit is one of the few courts to have\n     examined the link between these two elements of Sears.\n               [D]ata \"expressly adopt[ed] or incorporate[d]\n               by reference\" means predecisional\n               deliberative material which is adopted and\n               approved by the agency as its \"effective law\n               and policy.\" By expressly adopting the\n               reasoning of her subordinate, the\n               decisionmaker has in effect converted a\n               rejected proposal into the rationale for the\n               agency's working law. As a consequence, the\n               documents are no longer considered\n               predecisional[,] for they now support and\n               explain the agency's position in the same\n               manner a postdecisional document explains an\n               agency decision.\n     Fla.

[T]he\n11             memoranda are not advice to a superior, nor\n12             are they suggested dispositions of a case, as\n13             in Grumman. They are not one step of an\n14             established adjudicatory process, which would\n15             result in a formal opinion, as were the\n16             documents held exempt in [Sears].\n17\n18   Id. at 868.\n\n19             [T]hese opinions were routinely used by\n20             agency staff as guidance in conducting their\n21             audits, and were retained and referred to as\n22             precedent. If this occurs, the agency has\n23             promulgated a body of secret law which it is\n24             actually applying in its dealings with the\n25             public but which it is attempting to protect\n26             behind a label.

(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n23               The question of whether a document constitutes \"working\n\n24   law,\" or has been expressly adopted or incorporated by reference,\n\n\n                                      34\n\f 1   then, are two paths to determining whether a withheld document\n\n 2   constitutes what FOIA affirmatively requires to be disclosed --\n\n 3   \"'final opinions,' 'statements of policy and interpretations\n\n 4   which have been adopted by the agency,' and 'instructions to\n\n 5   staff that affect a member of the public.'\"      Sears, 421 U.S. at\n\n 6   153 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)).     Most Exemption 5 cases are\n\n 7   not framed in this manner because it is the government's burden\n\n 8   to prove that the privilege applies, and not the plaintiff's to\n\n 9   demonstrate the documents sought fall within one of the\n\n10   enumerated section 552(a)(2) categories.     Nevertheless, the\n\n11   appropriate analysis requires us to determine whether the\n\n12   documents sought more closely resemble the type of internal\n\n13   deliberative and predecisional documents that Exemption 5 allows\n\n14   to be withheld, or the types of documents that section 552(a)(2)\n\n15   requires be disclosed.    To do that, the Supreme Court and our\n\n16   court have asked whether the documents fit within the description\n\n17   of \"working law,\" in addition to whether they have been expressly\n\n18   adopted or incorporated by reference into a nonexempt\n\n19   communication.\n\n20   B.

As Paul Colborn, special counsel to the OLC,\n\n 7   explained to the district court by affidavit, \"OLC does not\n\n 8   purport, and in fact lacks authority, to make policy decisions.\n\n 9   OLC's legal advice and analysis informs the decisionmaking of\n\n10   Executive Branch officials on matters of policy, but OLC's legal\n\n11   advice is not itself dispositive as to any policy adopted.\"\n\n12   Decl. of Paul P. Colborn at 2, J.A. 318 (March 11, 2011).   The\n\n13   plaintiff does not submit contrary evidence suggesting that the\n\n14   OLC's recommendation was effectively binding on the agency, as in\n\n15   Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 869, or left it with \"no decision to\n\n16   make,\" as in Sears, 421 U.S. at 155.    The February Memorandum\n\n17   does not constitute \"working law,\" or \"the agency's effective law\n\n18   and policy.\"   Id. at 153.   We nonetheless conclude that the OLC's\n\n19   views were adopted by reference by USAID in nonexempt\n\n20   communications, and therefore must be disclosed.\n\n21             The first explicit reference to the OLC advice came in\n\n22   a July 22, 2004, USAID document entitled \"Guidance on the\n\n23   Definition and Use of the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund\n\n24   and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative Account.\"   There the agency\n\n\n                                      39\n\f 1   explained that the funding statute \"requires non-U.S. non-\n\n 2   governmental organizations . . . receiving HIV/AIDS funds to\n\n 3   agree that they have a policy explicitly opposing, in their\n\n 4   activities outside of the United States, prostitution and sex\n\n 5   trafficking.\"   July 22 USAID Update at 35.   In a footnote, the\n\n 6   document explained that \"[t]he Office of Legal Counsel, U.S.\n\n 7   Department of Justice in a draft opinion determined that this\n\n 8   provision only may be applied to foreign non-governmental\n\n 9   organizations and public international organizations because of\n\n10   the constitutional implications of applying it to U.S.\n\n11   organizations.\"   Id. at 35 n.10.15\n\n12             Then, in March 2005, after HHS and USAID had shifted\n\n13   their positions, tentatively deciding to apply the pledge\n\n14   requirement domestically, Randall Tobias, the USAID Global AID\n\n\n\n          15\n            Plaintiff urges us also to consider the September 20,\n     2004, letter from an OLC official to the general counsel of HHS\n     explaining that the \"tentative advice\" offered earlier was being\n     \"withdraw[n].\" Levin Letter at 1-2. Because there were\n     \"reasonable arguments\" to support the constitutionality of the\n     policy, the OLC official stated, \"we believe that HHS may\n     implement these provisions.\" Id. at 1. Because this letter was\n     neither written by a decisionmaker nor released publicly by the\n     decisionmaking agency, its relevance is limited. It does not aid\n     in establishing either express adoption or incorporation by\n     reference, and neither does it suggest that the February 2004 OLC\n     opinion was considered the \"working law\" of the agency. Rather,\n     it suggests that even after the February memorandum was sent to\n     HHS, a deliberative process continued, and advice was later\n     offered again to HHS that was also non-binding. In this sense,\n     it supports the defendant's contention that the February\n     memorandum should have been considered exempt from disclosure.\n\n                                      40\n\f 1   Administrator, made a second reference to the February\n\n 2   Memorandum.    When asked in a Congressional hearing about the\n\n 3   agency's change in positions, he explained:\n\n 4                The [OLC] . . . provided some tentative\n 5                advice initially that those restrictions\n 6                should be applied only to foreign\n 7                organizations. Sometime mid- to late-, I\n 8                think, in September of 2004, they withdrew\n 9                that earlier tentative advice and advised\n10                that that provision was intended by the\n11                Congress to apply without that limitation to\n12                both domestic organizations as well as\n13                foreign organizations. And so I'm simply\n14                following the legislation and the advice to\n15                implement that.\n\n16   Tobias Testimony, J.A. 236.16\n\n17                Thus, there were two public statements referencing the\n\n18   February 2004 memorandum -- the July 22 footnote, and the Tobias\n\n19   testimony.    We conclude that these references taken together\n\n20   establish express adoption or incorporation by reference.\n\n\n\n\n          16\n            An additional \"public\" reference was made to the February\n     2004 memorandum, in a July 2007 letter from an OLC official to\n     Congressman Henry Waxman. Waxman had requested an explanation\n     from the OLC regarding its interpretation of the pledge\n     requirement. The OLC wrote that in February 2004 it had provided\n     \"tentative advice\" to HHS and USAID that the pledge requirement\n     \"could, under the Constitution, be applied only to foreign\n     organizations acting overseas.\" Benczkowski Letter at 1. The\n     letter then went on to explain the subsequent change in advice.\n     This letter is also of limited relevance in determining whether\n     or not the February 2004 opinion should be subject to disclosure\n     because it was not authored by a decisionmaker from USAID or HHS.\n     (Again, this would be different had plaintiff adduced evidence\n     that OLC opinions were essentially binding upon the agencies.)\n\n                                       41\n\f 1             To be sure, neither the July 22 footnote nor Tobias's\n\n 2   testimony discussed at length the rationale provided by the OLC\n\n 3   for its conclusion as to the propriety of applying the pledge\n\n 4   requirement to domestic grantees.    Noting that the advice itself\n\n 5   was limited to one page in the first instance, we conclude that\n\n 6   the July 22 footnote's explanation that the pledge requirement\n\n 7   would not be enforced \"because of the constitutional implications\n\n 8   of applying it to U.S. organizations,\" July 22 USAID Update at 35\n\n 9   n.10, at least when reenforced by the Tobias reference,\n\n10   demonstrates sufficient reliance on both the conclusion and\n\n11   reasoning of the OLC memorandum to remove the protection of the\n\n12   deliberative-process exemption.17\n\n\n          17\n            In a pre-Sears case, the D.C. Circuit ordered disclosure\n     pursuant to Exemption 5 based on reasoning similar to what we\n     apply here.\n\n               We do not feel that [the agency] should be\n               required to 'operate in a fishbowl,' but by\n               the same token we do not feel that [the party\n               seeking disclosure] should be required to\n               operate in a darkroom. If the [agency] did\n               not want to expose its staff's memorandum to\n               public scrutiny it should not have stated\n               publicly in its April 11 ruling that its\n               action was based upon that memorandum, giving\n               no other reasons or basis for its action.\n               When it chose this course of action 'as a\n               matter of convenience'   the memorandum lost\n               its intra-agency status and became a public\n               record, one which must be disclosed . . . .\n\n     Am.

The July 2004 Memos.   As outlined above, on July\n\n11   2, 2004, OLC lawyer Lerner sent an email to HHS and USAID\n\n12   officials attaching a 30-page draft memorandum with the\n\n13   statement, \"Any comments you have would be much appreciated.\"\n\n14   Email from Lerner, \"OLC draft opinion on Sex Trafficking, AIDS\n\n15   Act grant restrictions.\"   J.A. 92 (July 2, 2004).   On July 30,\n\n16   2004, another OLC lawyer sent an updated draft of the memorandum\n\n17   to the HHS general counsel.\n\n18             On September 20, 2004, an OLC official explained in\n\n19   response to the original February inquiry from USAID and HHS as\n\n20   to the constitutionality of the pledge requirement that \"we\n\n21   believe that HHS may implement these provisions.     If the\n\n22   provisions are challenged in court, the Department stands ready\n\n23   to defend their constitutionality, in accordance with its\n\n24   longstanding practice of defending congressional enactments under\n\n\n                                      43\n\f 1   such circumstances.\"   Levin Letter at 1-2 (footnotes omitted).\n\n 2   That letter made no reference to the July OLC memos.     It offered\n\n 3   only sparse explanation of the legal basis for OLC's conclusion\n\n 4   that the pledge requirement could be defended.   Id.\n\n 5              On May 3, 2005, HHS issued a new policy outlining its\n\n 6   updated \"funding restrictions,\" which explained that \"any\n\n 7   recipient must have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and\n\n 8   sex trafficking.\"   HHS Funding Announcement, \"Increasing Access\n\n 9   to HIV Counseling and Testing (VCT) and Enhancing HIV/AIDS\n\n10   Communications, Prevention, and Care in Botswana, Lesotho, South\n\n11   Africa, Swaziland and Cote d'Ivoire\" at 10, J.A. 218 (May 3,\n\n12   2005).   The document does not explain the basis for that policy,\n\n13   nor refer to it as a change in policy.\n\n14              On June 9, 2005, USAID issued an updated AAPD that\n\n15   required domestic grantees to \"have a policy explicitly opposing\n\n16   prostitution and sex trafficking.\"   USAID AAPD 05-04,\n\n17   \"Implementation of the United States Leadership against HIV/AIDS\n\n18   Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 - Eligibility Limitation on\n\n19   the Use of Funds and Opposition to Prostitution and Sex\n\n20   Trafficking\" at 5, J.A. 225 (June 9, 2005).\n\n21              In this AAPD, USAID did state that \"[c]onsistent with\n\n22   guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice,\" USAID would \"now\n\n23   apply [the pledge requirement] to U.S. organizations as well as\n\n24   foreign organizations.\"   June 2005 AAPD at 2, J.A. 223.   Such\n\n\n                                     44\n\f 1   reference to guidance from the DOJ does not, however, indicate\n\n 2   that USAID (or HHS) adopted the reasoning of the July memoranda.\n\n 3   Nor does the fact that the agencies acted in conformity with the\n\n 4   July memoranda establish that the agencies adopted their\n\n 5   reasoning.    Grumman, 421 U.S. at 184.   \"Mere reliance of a\n\n 6   document's conclusions does not necessarily involve reliance on a\n\n 7   document's analysis: both will ordinarily be needed before a\n\n 8   court may properly find adoption or incorporation by reference.\"\n\n 9   La Raza, 411 F.3d at 358.\n\n10                When Tobias testified before Congress that USAID had\n\n11   changed its policy, he explained that the OLC's tentative advice\n\n12   had been withdrawn in mid- to late-September 2004.    See Tobias\n\n13   Testimony, J.A. 236.    That appears to be a reference to the\n\n14   September 2004 OLC letter, not to either of the July 2004 draft\n\n15   memoranda.\n\n16                On the record before us, then, Tobias's testimony\n\n17   referenced the September 2004 letter.     The lack of any specific\n\n18   reference to the July 2004 memoranda by either USAID or HHS are\n\n19   further indications that the July memoranda were in fact parts of\n\n20   the predecisional and deliberative process that yielded the\n\n21   September 2004 letter.\n\n22                The July 2007 letter to Congressman Waxman also\n\n23   explained the change in policy solely by reference to the\n\n24   September 2004 letter.    Although the July 2007 letter was not\n\n\n                                       45\n\f 1   written by a decisionmaker and therefore could not have served as\n\n 2   a basis for express adoption or incorporation by reference, it\n\n 3   serves as evidence that it was the September 2004 letter, and not\n\n 4   the July 2004 draft memoranda, that led to HHS and USAID's\n\n 5   decisions to implement the pledge requirement with respect to\n\n 6   U.S.-based organizations.\n\n 7             In sum, there is no evidence that the USAID or HHS\n\n 8   based its change in policy on the draft memoranda it seeks.    We\n\n 9   therefore cannot conclude, as did the district court, that either\n\n10   agency expressly adopted or incorporated by reference these\n\n11   drafts in explaining their policy change.   In such a\n\n12   circumstance, ordering release of these never-finalized memoranda\n\n13   would fail to \"safeguard and promote agency decisionmaking\n\n14   processes\" by, for example, not \"protect[ing] against confusing\n\n15   the issues and misleading the public by dissemination of\n\n16   documents suggesting reasons and rationales for a course of\n\n17   action which were not in fact the ultimate reasons for the\n\n18   agency's action,\" and failing to \"assure that subordinates within\n\n19   an agency will feel free to provide the decisionmaker with their\n\n20   uninhibited opinions and recommendations without fear of later\n\n21   being subject to public ridicule or criticism . . . .\"\n\n22   Providence Journal, 981 F.2d at 557 (quoting Coastal States, 617\n\n23   F.2d at 866); see also Grumman, 421 U.S. at 184-85 (\"[If] the\n\n24   evidence utterly fails to support the conclusion that the\n\n\n                                    46\n\f 1   reasoning in the reports is adopted by the Board as its\n\n 2   reasoning, even when it agrees with the conclusion of a\n\n 3   report, . . . the reports are not final opinions and do fall\n\n 4   within Exemption 5.\").\n\n 5               We conclude that the district court erred in ordering\n\n 6   disclosure of the July memoranda because there is insufficient\n\n 7   evidence that those memoranda were expressly adopted or\n\n 8   incorporated by reference by USAID, or became the \"working law\"\n\n 9   of the agency, sufficient to remove the deliberative-process\n\n10   protection.\n\n11               III.

The\n\n13   reasons underlying the absence of Exemption 5 protection for such\n\n14   a document otherwise covered by the deliberative-process\n\n15   exemption also underlie the agency’s loss of the protection of\n\n16   the attorney-client privilege.\n\n17             [O]nce an agency adopts or incorporates [a]\n18             document, frank communication will not be\n19             inhibited.

A party's reliance on an otherwise\n\n14   privileged communication to assert a claim or defense is similar\n\n15   to the type of express adoption or incorporation by reference\n\n16   that vitiates Exemption 5 protection -- in either case the party\n\n17   cannot invoke that relied-upon authority and then shield it from\n\n18   public view.   The references to the February 2004 memorandum that\n\n19   served to remove the deliberative-process privilege thus also\n\n20   constitute waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\n\n21              On this score, the defendants invoke the same argument\n\n22   as they did with regard to the deliberative-process exemption --\n\n23   that the instances of express adoption or incorporation cited by\n\n24   the plaintiff are not sufficient to withdraw the protection of\n\n\n                                     49\n\f 1   Exemption 5.

Merrill\n\n12   recognized an Exemption 5 privilege for \"confidential commercial\n\n13   information,\" but noted that \"[i]t should be obvious that the\n\n14   kind of mutually exclusive relationship between final opinions\n\n15   and statements of policy, on one hand, and predecisional\n\n16   communications, on the other, does not necessarily exist between\n\n17   final statements of policy and other Exemption 5 privileges.\"\n\n18   Id. at 360 n.23.
