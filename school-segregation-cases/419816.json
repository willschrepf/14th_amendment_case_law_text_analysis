The plaintiff, P.,\n\nsuing by and through his parents, is a child with Down Syndrome attending public school in the\n\nTown of Newington, Connecticut. He contends that the 2005-2006 Individualized Education\n\nPlan (IEP) devised for him at his elementary school did not include enough regular-classroom\n\ntime, and therefore did not place him in the least restrictive environment as mandated by the\n\nIDEA. P. challenged the IEP before an administrative hearing officer, who held that the school\n\ncomplied with the statute. P. appealed that decision to the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Connecticut (Alvin W. Thompson, J.), which affirmed, granting summary judgment to\n\nthe defendant Newington Board of Education. Today, we affirm the decision of the district court\n\nand join several of our sister circuits in holding that determining whether a student has been\n\nplaced in the “least restrictive environment” requires a flexible, fact-specific analysis,\n\nconsidering whether, with the aid of appropriate supplemental aids and services, education in the\n\nregular classroom may be achieved, and, if not, whether the school has included the student in\n\nregular classes, programs, and activities to the maximum extent appropriate. Applying that\n\nanalysis to the case before us, we affirm the decisions of the hearing officer and district court that\n\nthe defendant fulfilled its obligations under the IDEA.\n\nI.     The IDEA Requirement of an IEP\n\n       The IDEA “represents an ambitious federal effort to promote the education of\n\n                                                  2\n\fhandicapped children.” Bd. of Educ. of the Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458\n\nU.S. 176, 179 (1982) (interpreting the Education for All Handicapped Children Act,\n\nsubsequently renamed IDEA). The statute provides federal assistance for education of children\n\nwith disabilities and requires that states receiving such assistance provide disabled students with\n\na “free appropriate public education” in “the least restrictive environment,” 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1412(a)(1), (5), and devise an IEP for each disabled student. The IEP is crafted and revised by a\n\nteam consisting of the child’s parents, the child’s regular-classroom teacher, a special-education\n\nteacher, a representative of the local educational agency, and other individuals with knowledge\n\nand expertise regarding the child. Id. § 1414(d)(1)(B). The IEP must include a statement of the\n\nchild’s present level of academic and functional performance, measurable annual goals, special-\n\neducation and supplemental services, and any program modifications for the child, along with an\n\nexplanation of the extent to which the child will not participate with non-disabled children in\n\nregular classes and activities, a projected date for the beginning of any special supplementary\n\nservices or modifications, and the anticipated frequency, location, and duration of such services\n\nand modifications. Id. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i). In developing the IEP, the team must consider the\n\nchild’s strengths, the concerns of the parents, the results of the most recent evaluation of the\n\nchild, and the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child, along with other\n\n“special factors” particular to children with certain needs. Id. § 1414(d)(3)(A), (B). The local\n\neducational agency must ensure that the IEP is reviewed periodically, no less than annually, “to\n\ndetermine whether the annual goals for the child are being achieved,” and to revise the IEP as\n\nneeded based on the child’s progress and anticipated needs. Id. § 1414(d)(4).\n\n       A child’s parents must be notified of any change in a child’s educational program, id.\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f§ 1415(b)(3), and if a child’s parents are dissatisfied with an IEP, they may file a complaint with\n\nthe state’s educational agency. Id. § 1415(b)(6). Such complaints are resolved at an “impartial\n\ndue process hearing,” id. § 1415(f), and any party aggrieved by the outcome may bring an appeal\n\nin any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction, id. § 1415(i)(2), which will then “fashion\n\nappropriate relief based on its assessment of a preponderance of the evidence developed at the\n\nadministrative proceedings and any further evidence presented by the parties.” Walczak v. Fla.\n\nUnion Free Sch. Dist., 142 F.3d 119, 122-23 (2d Cir. 1998).\n\nII.    Factual Background\n\n       A.      The Development of P.’s 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 IEPs\n\n       P. suffers from Down Syndrome, hearing impairment, and other significant health\n\nproblems that have required several serious procedures, including surgery to repair a hole in his\n\nheart and multiple bowel operations, as a result of which he is not toilet trained. At the time\n\nrelevant to this litigation, he was a student at the Anna Reynolds Elementary School in\n\nNewington, Connecticut. Among the assigned staff at the school working with P. have been the\n\nspecial-education teacher, two paraprofessionals, a speech pathologist, a physical therapist, and\n\nan occupational therapist. In the spring of 2004, when P. was eight, the school district’s\n\nbehavioral consultant, Greg Smith, informed his parents that it was becoming increasingly\n\ndifficult to keep P. in a regular classroom, as the gap in ability between P. and his peers was\n\ngrowing and would grow larger. Moreover, at various times, P. had exhibited some behavior\n\nproblems, including kicking, grabbing, and pulling hair. P.’s mother strongly disagreed with\n\nSmith’s assessment and wanted her son to remain in a regular classroom with his non-disabled\n\npeers as much as possible.\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       On May 28, 2004, the group assigned to formulate P.’s IEP, the “Performance and\n\nPlanning Team” (PPT), met to discuss plans for the 2004-2005 school year. At that meeting, P.’s\n\nparents stated that they wanted their son to be in a regular classroom at least 80% of the time\n\nduring the upcoming school year. Instead, the IEP provided that P. be in the classroom for 60%\n\nof the school day, with “pull-out” services for occupational and speech therapy in separate\n\nclassrooms, and the plan did not include any measures to deal with P.’s burgeoning behavior\n\nproblems. In order to facilitate increased inclusion in the regular classroom, P.’s parents asked\n\nthat a consultant specializing in such matters be hired, and in accordance with their request, the\n\nBoard retained Dr. Kathleen Whitbread to evaluate P. Additionally, later in the summer of 2004,\n\nthe Connecticut Children’s Medical Center (CCMC) performed a psychological evaluation of P.,\n\nin which he was found to have social-interaction and communication skills equivalent to those of\n\nan average two-year-old child. The report also found that P. communicated primarily through\n\n“signs, gestures, and single words” and exhibited “serious problem behaviors,” including\n\n“disruptive behavior, destructiveness to property, and hurting others.” The report concluded that\n\n“[P.] will need pervasive support, much more than others his age, because of very limited\n\nadaptive behaviors and because of problem behaviors.” A “functional behavior assessment”\n\n(FBA) to assess behavior problems was not performed, nor was an “assistive technology\n\nevaluation” (ATE), which tests the extent to which assistive technology may facilitate inclusion\n\ninto the regular-classroom environment.\n\n       Dr. Whitbread completed her evaluation on December 13, 2004. In the report, based on\n\ntwo hours of observation of P. at home and 4.5 hours of observation of him in the classroom, Dr.\n\nWhitbread described P.’s behavior problems as “moderately serious” and opined that the PPT\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fhad done “a commendable job of ensuring that [P.] spends the majority of the day with non-\n\ndisabled peers.” Nevertheless, she recommended that P.’s instruction be more closely connected\n\nto the general education curriculum. Dr. Whitbread also recommended consultation with a\n\nteacher of the hearing impaired and a program of literacy instruction.\n\n       According to the testimony of his second-grade teacher, Ms. Mazur, P.’s behavior\n\nimproved during 2004-2005. He was only removed from the regular classroom three times due\n\nto behavior problems that caused or risked physical harm to another person, though timeouts\n\nwere used. Ms. Mazur also explained that, although she frequently co-taught classes with the\n\nspecial-education teacher, Nancy Wilcock, to integrate P. into regular lessons, in at least some\n\ncircumstances, “[P.] will need individualized instruction to make sure that he . . . is receiving the\n\nbest instruction without distraction.”\n\n       The PPT next met with Dr. Whitbread to discuss her findings and the CCMC evaluation\n\non February 11, 2005. At the meeting, the PPT accepted her recommendations for an ATE and\n\nliterary instruction. Although Dr. Whitbread stated at the meeting that P. would benefit from\n\nadditional regular-classroom time, she also contended that some of his literacy instruction might\n\nneed to take place outside the classroom. The PPT did not, however, reach any conclusions and\n\ndecided to reconvene in April.\n\n       Prior to the April meeting, Dr. Whitbread and Ms. Wilcock, the special-education teacher\n\nwho had been working with P. for three years, exchanged e-mails regarding appropriate next\n\nsteps. In one of these e-mails, Dr. Whitbread stated:\n\n       Time out of the classroom is a concern of [P.’s] parents and it is important to\n       them that [P.] be fully included. Their goal is 100% of the time in a gen. ed. class.\n       I have shared with them that I feel some pullout time is beneficial. To me, a\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f       reasonable goal over the next year would be to increase his time in the general ed.\n       environment from the current 60 or 65% to about 80%. I would not recommend\n       that this be done suddenly. I realize this is going to be a difficult discussion since\n       there are differences in opinion about what is best for [P.]. My hope is that we\n       can have a productive conversation, with the understanding that compromise may\n       be necessary.\n\nThis email is consistent with Dr. Whitbread’s later testimony before the hearing officer in this\n\ncase, during which she confirmed that she “recommended working up to 80 percent . . . that in\n\n[her] experience it’s not productive to go in and say right now you must do this.” But Dr.\n\nWhitbread also clarified her definition of “gradual”: “I would have liked to see that happen over\n\na month, two months, maybe three months, but certainly not years.”\n\n       The PPT next convened on April 15, 2005, with Dr. Whitbread again in attendance. At\n\nthe meeting, the special-education teacher, Ms. Wilcock, noted that P.’s behavior had improved,\n\nbut that his attention span was limited. P.’s parents again emphasized their preference that their\n\nson’s regular-classroom time increase from 60% to 80% in the upcoming year. Although the\n\nPPT scheduled another meeting in June to discuss the question, it indicated that at least some of\n\nP.’s speech-therapy sessions would occur in the regular classroom, and that all parties agreed that\n\nhe would undergo some physical therapy instead of regular physical education (although he\n\nwould still participate in some regular physical education). Dr. Whitbread again stated her\n\nrecommendation that the team “gradually increase to 80% inclusion for [P.].”\n\n       The PPT next met on June 3, 2005. Notes from the meeting indicate that an FBA for P.\n\nhad begun two weeks prior, and that all parties agreed that the school would hire a mutually\n\nagreeable behavioral specialist. With respect to the percentage of time P. would spend in the\n\nclassroom, however, the parties were unable to reach a consensus, and P.’s parents lodged their\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fdisagreement with the plan in writing. Dr. Whitbread later testified that the PPT engaged in a\n\n“very long tedious process” while attempting to determine the appropriate amount of classroom\n\ntime. Ultimately, the IEP provided that P.’s regular-classroom time would increase from 60% to\n\n74%, with participation in “all regular class[es],” except when he needed to be educated\n\nseparately to “increase his focus/attention” or when he needed to be removed from the regular\n\nclassroom “due to fatigue . . . or behavior which indicates [a] need for a break from the group.”\n\nThe IEP also mandated the following supplemental assistance for P.: daily check of P.’s hearing\n\naids in the health room, adult assistance in all activities in the regular classroom, assistive\n\ncomputer programs, extra time and directions on assignments, routines and schedules in pictures\n\ninstead of words, preferential seating, and a clear work area. The IEP also provided for weekly\n\nconsultation between the regular and special education teachers.\n\n       On June 9, 2005, P.’s parents requested an administrative hearing to challenge both the\n\n2004-2005 and 2005-2006 IEPs, primarily on the ground that P. was not sufficiently integrated\n\ninto the regular classroom.\n\n       Meanwhile, the PPT met again prior to the beginning of the school year, on August 18,\n\n2005. At that meeting, the parties agreed to the hiring of a mutually agreeable behavioral and\n\ninclusion consultant, Dr. Ann Majure. Also, by that time, the school had hired a hearing-\n\nimpairment consultant and another consultant to assist with implementing assistive-technology\n\nrecommendations.\n\n       During a meeting on April 7, 2006, the PPT mandated that P. be placed in a regular\n\nclassroom for 80% or more of the school day, pursuant in part to the recommendation of Dr.\n\nMajure. At oral argument in this case, the parties noted that since that time P. has been included\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fin the regular classroom at least 80% of the time.\n\nB.     Litigation Before the Hearing Officer and the District Court\n\n       Pursuant to P.’s parents’ request, hearing officer Mary Elizabeth Oppenheim held a\n\nhearing on P.’s parents’ challenge to his 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 IEPs. She heard testimony\n\nfrom P.’s parents, Dr. Whitbread, Ms. Wilcock, and several other teachers and special-education\n\nprofessionals. After exhaustively reviewing the record, and noting that the Board bore the\n\nburden of proof in proving the IEPs’ compliance with the IDEA, the hearing officer held in a\n\nthirty-five page opinion that the 2004-2005 IEP did not comply with IDEA, but that the 2005-\n\n2006 IEP did. The 2004-2005 IEP was deficient because too much of the division between\n\nregular and special classroom time was left to the discretion of school authorities and because\n\nP.’s behavioral issues were not appropriately addressed. As a “compensatory education” remedy\n\nfor the deficiencies of the 2004-2005 IEP, the hearing officer required that the Board retain an\n\ninclusion consultant with “considerable experience in placing children with mental retardation in\n\nregular classes,” and held that Dr. Majure, whom the school had already hired, could fill that role\n\nappropriately. The Board does not appeal the hearing officer’s findings with respect to the 2004-\n\n2005 IEP.\n\n       The hearing officer found, however, that the 2005-2006 IEP complied with the\n\nrequirements of the IDEA. Emphasizing Dr. Whitbread’s statements that she thought P.’s\n\nregular-classroom time should increase gradually to 80% and that P. required some special-\n\neducation services outside of the classroom, the hearing officer found that the PPT gave\n\nsufficient consideration to including P. in the classroom to the maximum extent appropriate. The\n\nhearing officer also took note of the extensive efforts the school had made on P.’s behalf,\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fincluding the numerous supplemental aids, services, and additional teachers employed to assist P.\n\nthroughout the day, the mutually agreed-upon behavioral consultant hired in 2005, and that the\n\nschool had modified the curriculum to meet P.’s needs. Moreover, it was clear that P. was\n\nincluded with non-disabled students for around 73% of the time in 2005-2006, and\n\n“participate[d] in all specials, lunch, [and] recess.”\n\n        P. subsequently appealed to the United States District Court for the District of\n\nConnecticut the ruling that the 2005-2006 IEP was sufficient and the sufficiency of the remedy\n\nawarded for the deficiencies in the 2004-2005 IEP. Both parties cross-moved for summary\n\njudgment, and the district court issued an opinion affirming the hearing officer’s decision and\n\nawarding P. partial attorneys’ fees and costs.2 P. v. Newington Bd. of Educ., 512 F. Supp. 2d 89\n\n(D. Conn. 2007). Applying the two-pronged test adopted by the Third Circuit in Oberti v.\n\nClementon School District, 995 F.2d 1204, 1215 (3d Cir. 1993), the district court held that the\n\nevidence supported the hearing officer’s ruling. 512 F. Supp. 2d at 102-09. P. now appeals the\n\ndistrict court’s decision.\n\nIII.    Discussion\n\n        A.       Standard of Review\n\n        We review de novo a district court’s award of summary judgment in an IDEA case.\n\nCerra v. Pawling Cent. Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d 186, 191 (2d Cir. 2005). Whether the district court\n\ncorrectly applied the IDEA’s statutory and regulatory provisions to the facts of a particular case is\n\na mixed question of law and fact, which we also review de novo. See J.D. v. Pawlet Sch. Dist.,\n\n224 F.3d 60, 64 (2d Cir. 2000). But the “role of the reviewing court in making these assessments\n\n\n        2\n            The Board does not challenge the fee award on appeal.\n\n                                                  10\n\fis circumscribed” under the IDEA and the Supreme Court’s decision in Board of Education of\n\nthe Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982). Muller v. Comm.\n\non Special Educ., 145 F.3d 95, 101 (2d Cir. 1998). Although school officials’ decisions are\n\nsubject to “independent” judicial review, the “responsibility for determining whether a\n\nchallenged IEP will provide a child with an appropriate public education rests in the first instance\n\nwith administrative hearing and review officers.” Walczak v. Fla. Union Free Sch. Dist., 142\n\nF.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir. 1998). Independent judicial review “is by no means an invitation to the\n\ncourts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school\n\nauthorities they review.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206. And “[w]hile federal courts do not simply\n\nrubber stamp administrative decisions, they are expected to give ‘due weight’ to these\n\nproceedings, mindful that the judiciary generally ‘lacks the specialized knowledge and\n\nexperience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.’”\n\nWalczak, 142 F.3d at 129 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206,\n\n208)). “Deference is particularly appropriate when . . . the state hearing officers’ review has been\n\nthorough and careful.” Id. Therefore, while our review is de novo, it is tinged with a significant\n\ndegree of deference to the state educational agency, as we are essentially acting in an\n\nadministrative-law-style capacity. See Lillbask v. Conn. Dep’t of Educ., 397 F.3d 77, 83 n.3 (2d\n\nCir. 2005) (noting that “a motion for summary judgment in an IDEA case often triggers more\n\nthan an inquiry into possible disputed issues of fact. Rather, the motion serves as a pragmatic\n\nprocedural mechanism for reviewing a state’s compliance with the . . . IDEA.”) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       Rowley prescribes a two-step inquiry: we must assess (1) whether the state complied with\n\n\n                                                11\n\fthe procedural requirements of the IDEA, and (2) whether the challenged IEP was “reasonably\n\ncalculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07. The\n\nplaintiffs here do not allege that the IDEA’s procedural requirements were not met. Rather, they\n\nchallenge only whether the IEP was “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\n\neducational benefits” – in particular, whether the IEP complied with the IDEA’s statutory\n\nmandate that P. be educated in the “least restrictive environment.” Under this second\n\n“substantive” prong of the Rowley test, a state need not “‘maximize the potential of handicapped\n\nchildren,’” but the door of public education must be opened in a “‘meaningful’ way,” and the IEP\n\nmust provide the opportunity for more than only “‘trivial advancement.’” Walczak, 142 F.3d at\n\n130 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 189, 192, and Mrs. B. v. Milford Bd. of Educ., 103 F.3d 1114,\n\n1121 (2d Cir. 1997)); see also Cerra, 427 F.3d at 194-95.\n\n       B.      Fashioning a Test for Assessing Placement in the “Least Restrictive Environment”\n\n       The IDEA mandates that “[t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with\n\ndisabilities . . . are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate\n\nschooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational\n\nenvironment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that\n\neducation in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\n\nsatisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A); Walczak, 142 F.3d at 122. “Educating a handicapped\n\nchild in a regular education classroom . . . is familiarly known as ‘mainstreaming.’” Daniel R.R.\n\nv. State Bd. of Educ., 874 F.2d 1036, 1039 (5th Cir. 1989). We have underscored the IDEA’s\n\n“strong preference for children with disabilities to be educated, ‘to the maximum extent\n\nappropriate,’ together with their non-disabled peers.” Walczak, 142 F.3d at 122. Nevertheless,\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fwe have also acknowledged that, “[w]hile mainstreaming is an important objective, we are\n\nmindful that the presumption in favor of mainstreaming must be weighed against the importance\n\nof providing an appropriate education to handicapped students. Under the [IDEA], where the\n\nnature or severity of the handicap is such that education in regular classes cannot be achieved\n\nsatisfactorily, mainstreaming is inappropriate.” Briggs v. Bd. of Educ. of Conn., 882 F.2d 688,\n\n692 (2d Cir. 1989) (citations omitted); see also Lachman v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ., 852 F.2d 290,\n\n295 (7th Cir. 1988). Understandably, courts have recognized some tension between the IDEA’s\n\ngoal of providing an education suited to a student’s particular needs and its goal of educating that\n\nstudent with his non-disabled peers as much as circumstances allow. Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at\n\n1044. As such, courts have used a case-by-case analysis in reviewing whether both of those\n\ngoals have been optimally accommodated under particular circumstances. Id. at 1048.\n\n       We have not yet explicitly stated a test for whether an IEP places a student in the least\n\nrestrictive environment. See Jennifer D. v. N.Y. City Dep’t of Educ., 550 F. Supp. 2d 420, 430\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2008).3 We conclude today that the two-pronged approach adopted by the Third,\n\nFifth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits provides appropriate guidance to the district courts\n\nwithout “too intrusive an inquiry into the educational policy choices that Congress deliberately\n\nleft to state and local school officials.” Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1046. Pursuant to that test, a\n\ncourt should consider, first, “whether education in the regular classroom, with the use of\n\n\n       3\n          In Briggs, we cited the district court’s use of, but did not adopt ourselves, the Sixth\nCircuit’s approach in Roncker ex rel. Roncker v. Walter, 700 F.2d 1058, 1063 (6th Cir. 1983), to\nleast-restrictive-environment cases: “In a case where the segregated facility is considered\nsuperior, the court should determine whether the services which make that placement superior\ncould be feasibly provided in a non-segregated setting.” Briggs, 882 F.2d at 692 (quoting\nRoncker, 700 F.2d at 1063); see also A.W. v. Nw. R-1 Sch. Dist., 813 F.2d 158, 163 (8th Cir.\n1987) (adopting the Sixth Circuit’s approach).\n\n                                                 13\n\fsupplemental aids and services, can be achieved satisfactorily for a given child,” and, if not, then\n\n“whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate.” Id. at\n\n1048; see also L.B. v. Nebo Sch. Dist., 379 F.3d 966, 976 (10th Cir. 2004); Sacramento City\n\nUnified Sch. Dist. v. Rachel H., 14 F.3d 1398, 1403-04 (9th Cir. 1994) (slightly modified\n\nversion); Oberti v. Clementon Sch. Dist., 995 F.2d 1204, 1215 (3d Cir. 1993); Greer v. Rome\n\nCity Sch. Dist., 950 F.2d 688, 696 (11th Cir. 1991). We today explicitly endorse that two-\n\npronged test, as elucidated and augmented by Judge Becker for the Third Circuit in Oberti:\n\n       In sum, in determining whether a child with disabilities can be educated\n       satisfactorily in a regular class with supplemental aids and services (the first\n       prong of the two-part mainstreaming test we adopt today), the court should\n       consider several factors, including: (1) whether the school district has made\n       reasonable efforts to accommodate the child in a regular classroom; (2) the\n       educational benefits available to the child in a regular class, with appropriate\n       supplementary aids and services, as compared to the benefits provided in a\n       special education class; and (3) the possible negative effects of the inclusion of\n       the child on the education of the other students in the class.\n\n       If, after considering these factors, the court determines that the school district\n       was justified in removing the child from the regular classroom and providing\n       education in a segregated, special education class, the court must consider the\n       second prong of the mainstreaming test – whether the school has included the\n       child in school programs with nondisabled children to the maximum extent\n       appropriate.\n\n995 F.2d at 1217-18 (footnote omitted).4 Both counsel for the parents and the Board in the case\n\n\n       4\n         Although Daniel R.R. did not expressly denominate it as one of the “factors” to be\nanalyzed, some courts adopting the two-part test have also included in the first prong an analysis\nof the costs of the supplementary aids and services necessary to maintain the child in the regular-\nclassroom environment. See, e.g., Rachel H., 14 F.3d at 1404; Greer, 950 F.2d at 697. “These\ncircuits’ [least restrictive environment] tests acknowledge the fiscal reality that school districts\nwith limited resources must balance the needs of each disabled child with the needs of the other\nchildren in the district.” L.B., 379 F.3d at 977 (not deciding whether costs should be taken into\naccount since the issue was not presented in the case). We need not consider in this case whether\ncosts should be taken into account because the Board has not raised the issue as a defense.\nAccordingly, we leave that question for another day. See also Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1218 n.25\n\n                                                 14\n\fat hand support this framework.\n\n       Although we adopt the Oberti approach, we also note that this list of factors is not\n\nexhaustive; courts facing these cases must engage in an individualized and fact-specific inquiry\n\ninto the nature of the student’s condition and the school’s particular efforts to accommodate it,\n\never mindful of the IDEA’s purpose of educating children with disabilities, “‘to the maximum\n\nextent appropriate,’ together with their non-disabled peers.” Walczak, 142 F.3d at 122; see also\n\nOberti, 995 F.2d at 1217 n.25; Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1048. Moreover, courts must keep in\n\nmind our deferential position with respect to state educational authorities crafting educational\n\npolicy. Walczak, 142 F.3d at 129. Nevertheless, our review must be searching, and we must\n\nrecognize that even when educational authorities act with the best intentions they may sometimes\n\nfall short of their obligations under the IDEA, and courts must then act to ensure compliance with\n\nCongress’s directives.\n\nC.     The Oberti Analysis Applied to This Case\n\n       We now turn to whether the Board’s actions with respect to the 2005-2006 IEP pass\n\nmuster under the test we have adopted, which both the district court and hearing officer\n\nreferenced and applied.5 Our review is against the backdrop of the ultimate conclusion of the\n\nIEP, which resolved that P. would be in the regular classroom 74% of the time, and Dr.\n\n\n\n(taking the same approach, noting that “[a]dditional factors may be relevant depending on the\ncircumstances of the specific case”).\n       5\n          Because both opinions below essentially applied the test we today adopt, there is no\nneed to remand in order for the hearing officer to apply it in the first instance. Moreover, even if\nthe proceedings below had not been analyzed according to the standard we adopt today, we find\nthat the facts in the record support the district court’s grant of summary judgment. See Chase\nManhattan Bank, N.A. v. Am. Nat’l Bank & Trust Co., 93 F.3d 1064, 1072 (2d Cir. 1996).\n\n                                                 15\n\fWhitbread’s statements that P.’s regular-classroom time should be gradually ramped up to 80%.\n\nThe first prong of the test asks whether a student can be satisfactorily educated in the regular\n\nclassroom with the benefit of supplemental aids and services. As noted, we also consider\n\nwhether the school made reasonable efforts to accommodate the student, the benefits and\n\ndrawbacks to the student of full-time integration into the regular classroom, and the possible\n\nnegative impact on other students of the disabled student’s presence. Although, in light of the\n\nimprovements in P.’s behavior, there did not appear to be a significant negative impact on other\n\nstudents arising from his inclusion in the regular classroom, we see no error in the district court’s\n\nconclusions that P. could not be educated in the regular class room full-time6 and that the school\n\nhad made significant efforts to integrate P. to the maximum extent possible. The school utilized\n\na variety of supplemental aids, including several additional professionals, and modified the\n\ncurriculum appropriately. Moreover, the hearing officer permissibly relied on the testimony of\n\nDr. Whitbread that P. required pull-out services for reading, math, and speech therapy. See\n\nPoolaw v. Bishop, 67 F.3d 830, 835 (9th Cir. 1995) (affirming adequacy of IEP when the school\n\n“offered a variety of supplemental aids and services, coupled with varying degrees of placement\n\nin the regular classroom to mainstream [the student] to the maximum extent appropriate”);\n\nDaniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1050 (affirming some special-classroom instruction when the school\n\n“has taken creative steps to provide [the student] as much access to nonhandicapped students as\n\nit can, while providing him an education that is tailored to his unique needs”). We therefore\n\nagree with this district court’s conclusion that “the evidence produced during the administrative\n\nproceeding demonstrates that education in the regular classroom, with the use of supplemental\n\n\n       6\n           Indeed, P.’s parents sought only 80% inclusion.\n\n                                                 16\n\faids and services, could not be achieved satisfactorily for the 2005-2006 school year.” P., 512 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 108.\n\n       Turning to the second prong of the test, we must assess “whether the school has included\n\nthe child in school programs with nondisabled children to the maximum extent appropriate.”\n\nOberti, 995 F.2d at 1218. Continuing to keep in mind that the IEP mandated 74% inclusion in\n\nthe regular classroom, as opposed to P.’s parents’ proposed 80% – a difference of approximately\n\n2-3 hours per week – we find no error in the district court’s conclusion that, given P.’s need for\n\nsome specialized instruction outside the regular classroom, he was mainstreamed to the\n\nmaximum extent appropriate.\n\n       P. argues that this Court should adopt a presumption that a student should be placed in a\n\nregular classroom 80% of the time and contends that the district court erred by failing to apply\n\nsuch a presumption. P. bases this argument on a class-action settlement in which the Connecticut\n\nState Department of Education agreed that it would be a “desired outcome[]” for disabled\n\nstudents to spend 80% of the school day with non-disabled students. Recognizing that\n\nConnecticut school authorities may have found this percentage figure useful, we conclude that\n\nmandating such a percentage in every case would be inconsistent with the IDEA’s directive that\n\nschools take an individualized approach to each student. See Frank G. v. Bd. of Educ. of Hyde\n\nPark, 459 F.3d 356, 363 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that the IDEA requires “special education and\n\nrelated services tailored to meet the unique needs of a particular child”) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); Briggs, 882 F.2d at 692 (noting that “the presumption in favor of mainstreaming must\n\nbe weighed against the importance of providing an appropriate education to handicapped\n\nstudents”); Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1050 (noting that the IDEA does not envision an “all-or-\n\n\n                                                17\n\fnothing” approach, but a continuum of services on which the best program for each child may be\n\nidentified). We do not think that 80% is presumptively adequate or that less than 80% is\n\npresumptively inadequate. Children with disabilities must be educated with their non-disabled\n\npeers “[t]o the maximum extent appropriate,” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A); Walczak, 142 F.3d at\n\n122. As the word “appropriate” suggests, the objective of providing an education tailored to each\n\nstudent’s particular needs does not admit of statistical generalizations. While including students\n\nin the regular classroom as much as is practicable is undoubtedly a central goal of the IDEA,\n\nschools must attempt to achieve that goal in light of the equally important objective of providing\n\nan education appropriately tailored to each student’s particular needs. See Bd. of Educ. of\n\nMurphysboro v. Ill. Bd. of Educ., 41 F.3d 1162, 1168 (7th Cir. 1994) (stating that least-\n\nrestrictive-environment requirement “was not developed to promote integration with non-\n\ndisabled peers at the expense of other IDEA educational requirements”).\n\n       We recognize and appreciate P.’s parents’ dedicated advocacy on his behalf. But the\n\nevidence before the hearing officer and the records of the several PPT meetings devoted to\n\ndeveloping P.’s 2005-2006 IEP demonstrate that the school fulfilled its duty under the IDEA to\n\ncraft a tailored educational plan that included P. in regular classes to the maximum extent\n\nappropriate. We therefore affirm the district court’s conclusion that the school’s actions were\n\nsufficient under the two-pronged test and that the 2005-2006 IEP placed P. in the “least\n\nrestrictive environment” under the IDEA.\n\nD.     The Remedy for Deficiencies in the 2004-2005 IEP\n\n       P. also argues on appeal that the compensatory-education remedy mandated by the\n\nhearing officer for deficiencies in the 2004-2005 IEP was insufficient. Those deficiencies, which\n\n\n                                                18\n\fthe Board did not contest in the district court, were that the school district had not properly\n\naddressed P.’s behavioral problems and had failed to give sufficient consideration to\n\nmainstreaming the student for more than 60% of the time. In response to the inadequacies of that\n\nIEP, the hearing officer ordered that the school hire a professional consultant on issues of\n\ninclusion, and that that consultant participate in the completion of an FBA. P. argues that the\n\nremedy was illusory because the school had already hired an inclusion consultant, Dr. Majure.\n\n       We affirm the remedy awarded by the hearing officer. The IDEA allows a hearing officer\n\nto fashion an appropriate remedy, and we have held compensatory education is an available\n\noption under the Act to make up for denial of a free and appropriate public education. Mrs. C. v.\n\nWheaton, 916 F.2d 69, 75-76 (2d Cir. 1990); see also Reid v. District of Columbia, 401 F.3d 516,\n\n518 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The remedy’s mandates in this case – that an inclusion consultant be\n\nretained for a year, requiring the school to keep Dr. Majure on for at least that long, and\n\ncompletion of an FBA – appropriately addressed the problems with the IEP, especially when\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that P. is now included in at least 80% of regular-classroom\n\nactivities, in part due to Dr. Majure’s recommendations. See Parents of Student W. v. Puyallup\n\nSch. Dist., 31 F.3d 1489, 1497 (9th Cir. 1994) (“Appropriate relief is relief designed to ensure\n\nthat the student is appropriately educated within the meaning of the IDEA.”). We therefore see\n\nno infirmity in the hearing officer’s chosen remedy.\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to the Board is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f",

The plaintiff, P.,\n\nsuing by and through his parents, is a child with Down Syndrome attending public school in the\n\nTown of Newington, Connecticut. He contends that the 2005-2006 Individualized Education\n\nPlan (IEP) devised for him at his elementary school did not include enough regular-classroom\n\ntime, and therefore did not place him in the least restrictive environment as mandated by the\n\nIDEA. P. challenged the IEP before an administrative hearing officer, who held that the school\n\ncomplied with the statute. P. appealed that decision to the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Connecticut (Alvin W. Thompson, J.), which affirmed, granting summary judgment to\n\nthe defendant Newington Board of Education. Today, we affirm the decision of the district court\n\nand join several of our sister circuits in holding that determining whether a student has been\n\nplaced in the “least restrictive environment” requires a flexible, fact-specific analysis,\n\nconsidering whether, with the aid of appropriate supplemental aids and services, education in the\n\nregular classroom may be achieved, and, if not, whether the school has included the student in\n\nregular classes, programs, and activities to the maximum extent appropriate. Applying that\n\nanalysis to the case before us, we affirm the decisions of the hearing officer and district court that\n\nthe defendant fulfilled its obligations under the IDEA.\n\nI.     The IDEA Requirement of an IEP\n\n       The IDEA “represents an ambitious federal effort to promote the education of\n\n                                                  2\n\fhandicapped children.” Bd. of Educ. of the Hendrick Hudson Cent.

The statute provides federal assistance for education of children\n\nwith disabilities and requires that states receiving such assistance provide disabled students with\n\na “free appropriate public education” in “the least restrictive environment,” 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1412(a)(1), (5), and devise an IEP for each disabled student. The IEP is crafted and revised by a\n\nteam consisting of the child’s parents, the child’s regular-classroom teacher, a special-education\n\nteacher, a representative of the local educational agency, and other individuals with knowledge\n\nand expertise regarding the child. Id. § 1414(d)(1)(B). The IEP must include a statement of the\n\nchild’s present level of academic and functional performance, measurable annual goals, special-\n\neducation and supplemental services, and any program modifications for the child, along with an\n\nexplanation of the extent to which the child will not participate with non-disabled children in\n\nregular classes and activities, a projected date for the beginning of any special supplementary\n\nservices or modifications, and the anticipated frequency, location, and duration of such services\n\nand modifications. Id. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i).

Factual Background\n\n       A.      The Development of P.’s 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 IEPs\n\n       P. suffers from Down Syndrome, hearing impairment, and other significant health\n\nproblems that have required several serious procedures, including surgery to repair a hole in his\n\nheart and multiple bowel operations, as a result of which he is not toilet trained. At the time\n\nrelevant to this litigation, he was a student at the Anna Reynolds Elementary School in\n\nNewington, Connecticut. Among the assigned staff at the school working with P. have been the\n\nspecial-education teacher, two paraprofessionals, a speech pathologist, a physical therapist, and\n\nan occupational therapist. In the spring of 2004, when P. was eight, the school district’s\n\nbehavioral consultant, Greg Smith, informed his parents that it was becoming increasingly\n\ndifficult to keep P. in a regular classroom, as the gap in ability between P. and his peers was\n\ngrowing and would grow larger. Moreover, at various times, P. had exhibited some behavior\n\nproblems, including kicking, grabbing, and pulling hair. P.’s mother strongly disagreed with\n\nSmith’s assessment and wanted her son to remain in a regular classroom with his non-disabled\n\npeers as much as possible.\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       On May 28, 2004, the group assigned to formulate P.’s IEP, the “Performance and\n\nPlanning Team” (PPT), met to discuss plans for the 2004-2005 school year. At that meeting, P.’s\n\nparents stated that they wanted their son to be in a regular classroom at least 80% of the time\n\nduring the upcoming school year. Instead, the IEP provided that P. be in the classroom for 60%\n\nof the school day, with “pull-out” services for occupational and speech therapy in separate\n\nclassrooms, and the plan did not include any measures to deal with P.’s burgeoning behavior\n\nproblems. In order to facilitate increased inclusion in the regular classroom, P.’s parents asked\n\nthat a consultant specializing in such matters be hired, and in accordance with their request, the\n\nBoard retained Dr. Kathleen Whitbread to evaluate P. Additionally, later in the summer of 2004,\n\nthe Connecticut Children’s Medical Center (CCMC) performed a psychological evaluation of P.,\n\nin which he was found to have social-interaction and communication skills equivalent to those of\n\nan average two-year-old child. The report also found that P. communicated primarily through\n\n“signs, gestures, and single words” and exhibited “serious problem behaviors,” including\n\n“disruptive behavior, destructiveness to property, and hurting others.” The report concluded that\n\n“[P.] will need pervasive support, much more than others his age, because of very limited\n\nadaptive behaviors and because of problem behaviors.” A “functional behavior assessment”\n\n(FBA) to assess behavior problems was not performed, nor was an “assistive technology\n\nevaluation” (ATE), which tests the extent to which assistive technology may facilitate inclusion\n\ninto the regular-classroom environment.\n\n       Dr. Whitbread completed her evaluation on December 13, 2004. In the report, based on\n\ntwo hours of observation of P. at home and 4.5 hours of observation of him in the classroom, Dr.\n\nWhitbread described P.’s behavior problems as “moderately serious” and opined that the PPT\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fhad done “a commendable job of ensuring that [P.] spends the majority of the day with non-\n\ndisabled peers.” Nevertheless, she recommended that P.’s instruction be more closely connected\n\nto the general education curriculum. Dr. Whitbread also recommended consultation with a\n\nteacher of the hearing impaired and a program of literacy instruction.\n\n       According to the testimony of his second-grade teacher, Ms. Mazur, P.’s behavior\n\nimproved during 2004-2005. He was only removed from the regular classroom three times due\n\nto behavior problems that caused or risked physical harm to another person, though timeouts\n\nwere used. Ms. Mazur also explained that, although she frequently co-taught classes with the\n\nspecial-education teacher, Nancy Wilcock, to integrate P. into regular lessons, in at least some\n\ncircumstances, “[P.] will need individualized instruction to make sure that he . . . is receiving the\n\nbest instruction without distraction.”\n\n       The PPT next met with Dr. Whitbread to discuss her findings and the CCMC evaluation\n\non February 11, 2005. At the meeting, the PPT accepted her recommendations for an ATE and\n\nliterary instruction. Although Dr. Whitbread stated at the meeting that P. would benefit from\n\nadditional regular-classroom time, she also contended that some of his literacy instruction might\n\nneed to take place outside the classroom. The PPT did not, however, reach any conclusions and\n\ndecided to reconvene in April.\n\n       Prior to the April meeting, Dr. Whitbread and Ms. Wilcock, the special-education teacher\n\nwho had been working with P. for three years, exchanged e-mails regarding appropriate next\n\nsteps. In one of these e-mails, Dr. Whitbread stated:\n\n       Time out of the classroom is a concern of [P.’s] parents and it is important to\n       them that [P.] be fully included. Their goal is 100% of the time in a gen. ed. class.\n       I have shared with them that I feel some pullout time is beneficial. To me, a\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f       reasonable goal over the next year would be to increase his time in the general ed.\n       environment from the current 60 or 65% to about 80%. I would not recommend\n       that this be done suddenly. I realize this is going to be a difficult discussion since\n       there are differences in opinion about what is best for [P.]. My hope is that we\n       can have a productive conversation, with the understanding that compromise may\n       be necessary.\n\nThis email is consistent with Dr. Whitbread’s later testimony before the hearing officer in this\n\ncase, during which she confirmed that she “recommended working up to 80 percent . . . that in\n\n[her] experience it’s not productive to go in and say right now you must do this.” But Dr.\n\nWhitbread also clarified her definition of “gradual”: “I would have liked to see that happen over\n\na month, two months, maybe three months, but certainly not years.”\n\n       The PPT next convened on April 15, 2005, with Dr. Whitbread again in attendance. At\n\nthe meeting, the special-education teacher, Ms. Wilcock, noted that P.’s behavior had improved,\n\nbut that his attention span was limited. P.’s parents again emphasized their preference that their\n\nson’s regular-classroom time increase from 60% to 80% in the upcoming year. Although the\n\nPPT scheduled another meeting in June to discuss the question, it indicated that at least some of\n\nP.’s speech-therapy sessions would occur in the regular classroom, and that all parties agreed that\n\nhe would undergo some physical therapy instead of regular physical education (although he\n\nwould still participate in some regular physical education). Dr. Whitbread again stated her\n\nrecommendation that the team “gradually increase to 80% inclusion for [P.].”\n\n       The PPT next met on June 3, 2005. Notes from the meeting indicate that an FBA for P.\n\nhad begun two weeks prior, and that all parties agreed that the school would hire a mutually\n\nagreeable behavioral specialist. With respect to the percentage of time P. would spend in the\n\nclassroom, however, the parties were unable to reach a consensus, and P.’s parents lodged their\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fdisagreement with the plan in writing. Dr. Whitbread later testified that the PPT engaged in a\n\n“very long tedious process” while attempting to determine the appropriate amount of classroom\n\ntime. Ultimately, the IEP provided that P.’s regular-classroom time would increase from 60% to\n\n74%, with participation in “all regular class[es],” except when he needed to be educated\n\nseparately to “increase his focus/attention” or when he needed to be removed from the regular\n\nclassroom “due to fatigue . . . or behavior which indicates [a] need for a break from the group.”\n\nThe IEP also mandated the following supplemental assistance for P.: daily check of P.’s hearing\n\naids in the health room, adult assistance in all activities in the regular classroom, assistive\n\ncomputer programs, extra time and directions on assignments, routines and schedules in pictures\n\ninstead of words, preferential seating, and a clear work area. The IEP also provided for weekly\n\nconsultation between the regular and special education teachers.\n\n       On June 9, 2005, P.’s parents requested an administrative hearing to challenge both the\n\n2004-2005 and 2005-2006 IEPs, primarily on the ground that P. was not sufficiently integrated\n\ninto the regular classroom.\n\n       Meanwhile, the PPT met again prior to the beginning of the school year, on August 18,\n\n2005. At that meeting, the parties agreed to the hiring of a mutually agreeable behavioral and\n\ninclusion consultant, Dr. Ann Majure. Also, by that time, the school had hired a hearing-\n\nimpairment consultant and another consultant to assist with implementing assistive-technology\n\nrecommendations.\n\n       During a meeting on April 7, 2006, the PPT mandated that P. be placed in a regular\n\nclassroom for 80% or more of the school day, pursuant in part to the recommendation of Dr.\n\nMajure. At oral argument in this case, the parties noted that since that time P. has been included\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fin the regular classroom at least 80% of the time.\n\nB.     Litigation Before the Hearing Officer and the District Court\n\n       Pursuant to P.’s parents’ request, hearing officer Mary Elizabeth Oppenheim held a\n\nhearing on P.’s parents’ challenge to his 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 IEPs. She heard testimony\n\nfrom P.’s parents, Dr. Whitbread, Ms. Wilcock, and several other teachers and special-education\n\nprofessionals. After exhaustively reviewing the record, and noting that the Board bore the\n\nburden of proof in proving the IEPs’ compliance with the IDEA, the hearing officer held in a\n\nthirty-five page opinion that the 2004-2005 IEP did not comply with IDEA, but that the 2005-\n\n2006 IEP did. The 2004-2005 IEP was deficient because too much of the division between\n\nregular and special classroom time was left to the discretion of school authorities and because\n\nP.’s behavioral issues were not appropriately addressed. As a “compensatory education” remedy\n\nfor the deficiencies of the 2004-2005 IEP, the hearing officer required that the Board retain an\n\ninclusion consultant with “considerable experience in placing children with mental retardation in\n\nregular classes,” and held that Dr. Majure, whom the school had already hired, could fill that role\n\nappropriately. The Board does not appeal the hearing officer’s findings with respect to the 2004-\n\n2005 IEP.\n\n       The hearing officer found, however, that the 2005-2006 IEP complied with the\n\nrequirements of the IDEA. Emphasizing Dr. Whitbread’s statements that she thought P.’s\n\nregular-classroom time should increase gradually to 80% and that P. required some special-\n\neducation services outside of the classroom, the hearing officer found that the PPT gave\n\nsufficient consideration to including P. in the classroom to the maximum extent appropriate. The\n\nhearing officer also took note of the extensive efforts the school had made on P.’s behalf,\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fincluding the numerous supplemental aids, services, and additional teachers employed to assist P.\n\nthroughout the day, the mutually agreed-upon behavioral consultant hired in 2005, and that the\n\nschool had modified the curriculum to meet P.’s needs. Moreover, it was clear that P. was\n\nincluded with non-disabled students for around 73% of the time in 2005-2006, and\n\n“participate[d] in all specials, lunch, [and] recess.”\n\n        P. subsequently appealed to the United States District Court for the District of\n\nConnecticut the ruling that the 2005-2006 IEP was sufficient and the sufficiency of the remedy\n\nawarded for the deficiencies in the 2004-2005 IEP. Both parties cross-moved for summary\n\njudgment, and the district court issued an opinion affirming the hearing officer’s decision and\n\nawarding P. partial attorneys’ fees and costs.2 P. v.

Although school officials’ decisions are\n\nsubject to “independent” judicial review, the “responsibility for determining whether a\n\nchallenged IEP will provide a child with an appropriate public education rests in the first instance\n\nwith administrative hearing and review officers.” Walczak v. Fla. Union Free Sch.

Independent judicial review “is by no means an invitation to the\n\ncourts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school\n\nauthorities they review.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206. And “[w]hile federal courts do not simply\n\nrubber stamp administrative decisions, they are expected to give ‘due weight’ to these\n\nproceedings, mindful that the judiciary generally ‘lacks the specialized knowledge and\n\nexperience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.’”\n\nWalczak, 142 F.3d at 129 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206,\n\n208)). “Deference is particularly appropriate when . . . the state hearing officers’ review has been\n\nthorough and careful.” Id. Therefore, while our review is de novo, it is tinged with a significant\n\ndegree of deference to the state educational agency, as we are essentially acting in an\n\nadministrative-law-style capacity. See Lillbask v. Conn. Dep’t of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789137\"><a href=\"/opinion/789137/ingabritt-lillbask-as-legal-guardian-on-behalf-of-lindsey-mauclaire-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83 n.3 (2d\n\nCir. 2005) (noting that “a motion for summary judgment in an IDEA case often triggers more\n\nthan an inquiry into possible disputed issues of fact. Rather, the motion serves as a pragmatic\n\nprocedural mechanism for reviewing a state’s compliance with the . . . IDEA.”) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       Rowley prescribes a two-step inquiry: we must assess (1) whether the state complied with\n\n\n                                                11\n\fthe procedural requirements of the IDEA, and (2) whether the challenged IEP was “reasonably\n\ncalculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07. The\n\nplaintiffs here do not allege that the IDEA’s procedural requirements were not met. Rather, they\n\nchallenge only whether the IEP was “reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\n\neducational benefits” – in particular, whether the IEP complied with the IDEA’s statutory\n\nmandate that P. be educated in the “least restrictive environment.” Under this second\n\n“substantive” prong of the Rowley test, a state need not “‘maximize the potential of handicapped\n\nchildren,’” but the door of public education must be opened in a “‘meaningful’ way,” and the IEP\n\nmust provide the opportunity for more than only “‘trivial advancement.’” Walczak, 142 F.3d at\n\n130 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 189, 192, and Mrs. B. v.

We today explicitly endorse that two-\n\npronged test, as elucidated and augmented by Judge Becker for the Third Circuit in Oberti:\n\n       In sum, in determining whether a child with disabilities can be educated\n       satisfactorily in a regular class with supplemental aids and services (the first\n       prong of the two-part mainstreaming test we adopt today), the court should\n       consider several factors, including: (1) whether the school district has made\n       reasonable efforts to accommodate the child in a regular classroom; (2) the\n       educational benefits available to the child in a regular class, with appropriate\n       supplementary aids and services, as compared to the benefits provided in a\n       special education class; and (3) the possible negative effects of the inclusion of\n       the child on the education of the other students in the class.\n\n       If, after considering these factors, the court determines that the school district\n       was justified in removing the child from the regular classroom and providing\n       education in a segregated, special education class, the court must consider the\n       second prong of the mainstreaming test – whether the school has included the\n       child in school programs with nondisabled children to the maximum extent\n       appropriate.\n\n995 F.2d at 1217-18 (footnote omitted).4 Both counsel for the parents and the Board in the case\n\n\n       4\n         Although Daniel R.R. did not expressly denominate it as one of the “factors” to be\nanalyzed, some courts adopting the two-part test have also included in the first prong an analysis\nof the costs of the supplementary aids and services necessary to maintain the child in the regular-\nclassroom environment. See, e.g., Rachel H., 14 F.3d at 1404; Greer, 950 F.2d at 697. “These\ncircuits’ [least restrictive environment] tests acknowledge the fiscal reality that school districts\nwith limited resources must balance the needs of each disabled child with the needs of the other\nchildren in the district.” L.B., 379 F.3d at 977 (not deciding whether costs should be taken into\naccount since the issue was not presented in the case). We need not consider in this case whether\ncosts should be taken into account because the Board has not raised the issue as a defense.\nAccordingly, we leave that question for another day. See also Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1218 n.25\n\n                                                 14\n\fat hand support this framework.\n\n       Although we adopt the Oberti approach, we also note that this list of factors is not\n\nexhaustive; courts facing these cases must engage in an individualized and fact-specific inquiry\n\ninto the nature of the student’s condition and the school’s particular efforts to accommodate it,\n\never mindful of the IDEA’s purpose of educating children with disabilities, “‘to the maximum\n\nextent appropriate,’ together with their non-disabled peers.” Walczak, 142 F.3d at 122; see also\n\nOberti, 995 F.2d at 1217 n.25; Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1048. Moreover, courts must keep in\n\nmind our deferential position with respect to state educational authorities crafting educational\n\npolicy. Walczak, 142 F.3d at 129. Nevertheless, our review must be searching, and we must\n\nrecognize that even when educational authorities act with the best intentions they may sometimes\n\nfall short of their obligations under the IDEA, and courts must then act to ensure compliance with\n\nCongress’s directives.\n\nC.     The Oberti Analysis Applied to This Case\n\n       We now turn to whether the Board’s actions with respect to the 2005-2006 IEP pass\n\nmuster under the test we have adopted, which both the district court and hearing officer\n\nreferenced and applied.5 Our review is against the backdrop of the ultimate conclusion of the\n\nIEP, which resolved that P. would be in the regular classroom 74% of the time, and Dr.\n\n\n\n(taking the same approach, noting that “[a]dditional factors may be relevant depending on the\ncircumstances of the specific case”).\n       5\n          Because both opinions below essentially applied the test we today adopt, there is no\nneed to remand in order for the hearing officer to apply it in the first instance. Moreover, even if\nthe proceedings below had not been analyzed according to the standard we adopt today, we find\nthat the facts in the record support the district court’s grant of summary judgment. See Chase\nManhattan Bank, N.A. v. Am. Nat’l Bank & Trust Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725001\"><a href=\"/opinion/725001/the-chase-manhattan-bank-na-plaintiff-appellant-cross-appellee-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1072 (2d Cir. 1996).\n\n                                                 15\n\fWhitbread’s statements that P.’s regular-classroom time should be gradually ramped up to 80%.\n\nThe first prong of the test asks whether a student can be satisfactorily educated in the regular\n\nclassroom with the benefit of supplemental aids and services. As noted, we also consider\n\nwhether the school made reasonable efforts to accommodate the student, the benefits and\n\ndrawbacks to the student of full-time integration into the regular classroom, and the possible\n\nnegative impact on other students of the disabled student’s presence. Although, in light of the\n\nimprovements in P.’s behavior, there did not appear to be a significant negative impact on other\n\nstudents arising from his inclusion in the regular classroom, we see no error in the district court’s\n\nconclusions that P. could not be educated in the regular class room full-time6 and that the school\n\nhad made significant efforts to integrate P. to the maximum extent possible. The school utilized\n\na variety of supplemental aids, including several additional professionals, and modified the\n\ncurriculum appropriately. Moreover, the hearing officer permissibly relied on the testimony of\n\nDr. Whitbread that P. required pull-out services for reading, math, and speech therapy. See\n\nPoolaw v. Bishop, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705962\"><a href=\"/opinion/705962/lionel-poolaw-and-daphne-poolaw-as-next-friends-of-lionel-b-poolaw-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 835 (9th Cir. 1995) (affirming adequacy of IEP when the school\n\n“offered a variety of supplemental aids and services, coupled with varying degrees of placement\n\nin the regular classroom to mainstream [the student] to the maximum extent appropriate”);\n\nDaniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1050 (affirming some special-classroom instruction when the school\n\n“has taken creative steps to provide [the student] as much access to nonhandicapped students as\n\nit can, while providing him an education that is tailored to his unique needs”). We therefore\n\nagree with this district court’s conclusion that “the evidence produced during the administrative\n\nproceeding demonstrates that education in the regular classroom, with the use of supplemental\n\n\n       6\n           Indeed, P.’s parents sought only 80% inclusion.\n\n                                                 16\n\faids and services, could not be achieved satisfactorily for the 2005-2006 school year.” P., 512 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 108.\n\n       Turning to the second prong of the test, we must assess “whether the school has included\n\nthe child in school programs with nondisabled children to the maximum extent appropriate.”\n\nOberti, 995 F.2d at 1218. Continuing to keep in mind that the IEP mandated 74% inclusion in\n\nthe regular classroom, as opposed to P.’s parents’ proposed 80% – a difference of approximately\n\n2-3 hours per week – we find no error in the district court’s conclusion that, given P.’s need for\n\nsome specialized instruction outside the regular classroom, he was mainstreamed to the\n\nmaximum extent appropriate.\n\n       P. argues that this Court should adopt a presumption that a student should be placed in a\n\nregular classroom 80% of the time and contends that the district court erred by failing to apply\n\nsuch a presumption. P. bases this argument on a class-action settlement in which the Connecticut\n\nState Department of Education agreed that it would be a “desired outcome[]” for disabled\n\nstudents to spend 80% of the school day with non-disabled students. Recognizing that\n\nConnecticut school authorities may have found this percentage figure useful, we conclude that\n\nmandating such a percentage in every case would be inconsistent with the IDEA’s directive that\n\nschools take an individualized approach to each student.

Bd. of Educ. of Hyde\n\nPark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795358\"><a href=\"/opinion/795358/frank-g-and-dianne-g-parents-of-a-disabled-student-anthony-g-v-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that the IDEA requires “special education and\n\nrelated services tailored to meet the unique needs of a particular child”) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); Briggs, 882 F.2d at 692 (noting that “the presumption in favor of mainstreaming must\n\nbe weighed against the importance of providing an appropriate education to handicapped\n\nstudents”); Daniel R.R., 874 F.2d at 1050 (noting that the IDEA does not envision an “all-or-\n\n\n                                                17\n\fnothing” approach, but a continuum of services on which the best program for each child may be\n\nidentified). We do not think that 80% is presumptively adequate or that less than 80% is\n\npresumptively inadequate. Children with disabilities must be educated with their non-disabled\n\npeers “[t]o the maximum extent appropriate,” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A); Walczak, 142 F.3d at\n\n122. As the word “appropriate” suggests, the objective of providing an education tailored to each\n\nstudent’s particular needs does not admit of statistical generalizations. While including students\n\nin the regular classroom as much as is practicable is undoubtedly a central goal of the IDEA,\n\nschools must attempt to achieve that goal in light of the equally important objective of providing\n\nan education appropriately tailored to each student’s particular needs. See Bd. of Educ. of\n\nMurphysboro v. Ill. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683556\"><a href=\"/opinion/683556/board-of-education-of-murphysboro-community-unit-school-district-no-186/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1168 (7th Cir. 1994) (stating that least-\n\nrestrictive-environment requirement “was not developed to promote integration with non-\n\ndisabled peers at the expense of other IDEA educational requirements”).\n\n       We recognize and appreciate P.’s parents’ dedicated advocacy on his behalf. But the\n\nevidence before the hearing officer and the records of the several PPT meetings devoted to\n\ndeveloping P.’s 2005-2006 IEP demonstrate that the school fulfilled its duty under the IDEA to\n\ncraft a tailored educational plan that included P. in regular classes to the maximum extent\n\nappropriate. We therefore affirm the district court’s conclusion that the school’s actions were\n\nsufficient under the two-pronged test and that the 2005-2006 IEP placed P. in the “least\n\nrestrictive environment” under the IDEA.\n\nD.     The Remedy for Deficiencies in the 2004-2005 IEP\n\n       P. also argues on appeal that the compensatory-education remedy mandated by the\n\nhearing officer for deficiencies in the 2004-2005 IEP was insufficient. Those deficiencies, which\n\n\n                                                18\n\fthe Board did not contest in the district court, were that the school district had not properly\n\naddressed P.’s behavioral problems and had failed to give sufficient consideration to\n\nmainstreaming the student for more than 60% of the time. In response to the inadequacies of that\n\nIEP, the hearing officer ordered that the school hire a professional consultant on issues of\n\ninclusion, and that that consultant participate in the completion of an FBA. P. argues that the\n\nremedy was illusory because the school had already hired an inclusion consultant, Dr. Majure.\n\n       We affirm the remedy awarded by the hearing officer. The IDEA allows a hearing officer\n\nto fashion an appropriate remedy, and we have held compensatory education is an available\n\noption under the Act to make up for denial of a free and appropriate public education.

The remedy’s mandates in this case – that an inclusion consultant be\n\nretained for a year, requiring the school to keep Dr. Majure on for at least that long, and\n\ncompletion of an FBA – appropriately addressed the problems with the IEP, especially when\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that P. is now included in at least 80% of regular-classroom\n\nactivities, in part due to Dr. Majure’s recommendations.
