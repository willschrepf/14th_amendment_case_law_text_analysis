Jeremiah. It is essentially \"a specialized calendar created to allow magistrates to hold court at schools where truancy was a problem.\" (Judicial Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Their Mot. to Dismiss at 2.) Such an arrangement ensured that students missed as little school time as possible, and also enabled the \"collaboration of the court, school, and service providers\" to ensure that \"the child and parent(s) . . . receive(d) guidance and services within their own neighborhood quickly, efficiently and effectively.\" <u>Id.</u></p>\n<p>The first Truancy Court was established at Hope High School, in the City of Providence, Rhode Island. Over the next several years, the Truancy Court program expanded rapidly, and Truancy Courts are now present in thirty-three communities, servicing over one hundred fifty schools in forty-three separate locations.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), and Super. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), alleging lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, respectively. Specifically, Defendants argue that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  (1) \"[T]he particular claims launched require an interpretation and application of chapter 19 of Title 16 of the General Laws of Rhode Island which, by statute, has been completely delegated to the Family Court;\"</blockquote> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 5</span> </p>\n<blockquote><p>  (2) \"[P]rinciples of comity require the Superior Court to abstain from hearing this case as the parties, forms of relief and legal arguments are similar to those present in pending cases in Family Court;\" and</p>\n<p>  (3) \"[T]he basis of the action, <cross_reference>42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983</cross_reference>, is a federal claim made against the state that is barred by both the  <cross_reference>Eleventh Amendment</cross_reference> to the Constitution of the United States and sovereign immunity, which has not been waived.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Plaintiffs respond that the Superior Court has authority to adjudicate this action because it has general jurisdiction over all cases that the General Assembly has not explicitly directed to another state forum. <u>Chase v.

Nothing in the General Laws, rules, or regulations directs that class action lawsuits brought pursuant to <cross_reference>42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983</cross_reference> be filed in another forum. Secondly, Plaintiffs argue that principles of comity, abstention, and immunity do not apply because Plaintiffs do not seek to collaterally attack trial court orders or adjudications. Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that <cross_reference>Eleventh Amendment</cross_reference> immunity and federal abstention do not apply because they are only applicable to <u>federal</u> court actions, not state court actions.</p>\n<p>This Court will address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p><center>                                   <strong>II</strong></center><center>                           <strong>Standard of Review</strong></center>\nRule 12(b) of the Rhode Island Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides for seven defenses that may be made by motion at the option of the pleader.

Thus, in order to better determine whether the Superior Court has jurisdiction over this action, this Court must examine what has been delegated by statute to other tribunals. Defendants have argued that the Superior Court cannot enjoin a co-equal court and have suggested that the exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction would \"create a constitutional confrontation between two co-equal state courts.\" (Defendant Administrators' Mem. in Supp. of Their Mot. to Dismiss at 2.) Except for the Rhode Island Supreme Court, the Rhode Island Constitution does not mention \"co-equal\" courts or purport to further stratify any other courts in the state. Article X specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  &#8226; <strong>Section 1.</strong> Power vested in court. &#8212; The judicial power of this state shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the general assembly may, from time to time, ordain and establish.</p>\n<p>  &#8226; <strong>Section 2</strong>. Jurisdiction of supreme and inferior courts &#8212; Quorum of supreme court. &#8212; The supreme court shall have final revisory and appellate jurisdiction upon all questions of law and equity. It shall have power to issue prerogative writs, and shall also have such other jurisdiction as may, from time to time, be prescribed by law. A majority of its judges shall <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 8</span> \nalways be necessary to constitute a quorum. The inferior courts shall have such jurisdiction as may, from time to time, be prescribed by law.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The General Assembly enacted legislation that expounds on the Supreme Court's supervisory jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>8-1-2</cross_reference> Jurisdiction and powers of</strong> <strong>court.</strong> &#8212; The supreme court shall have  <u>general supervision</u> of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein <u>when no other remedy</u> <u>is expressly provided</u>; it may issue writs of habeas corpus, of error, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and all other extraordinary and prerogative writs and processes necessary for the furtherance of justice and the due administration of the law; it may entertain informations in the nature of quo warranto and petitions in equity to determine title to any office; it shall have jurisdiction of petitions for trials and new trials, as provided by law, of bills of exceptions, appeals and certifications to the supreme court, and special cases in which parties having adversary interests concur in stating questions for the opinion of the court as provided by law; and it shall by general or special rules regulate the admission of attorneys to practice in all the courts of the state.\" (emphasis added).</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addressing whether the Superior Court has subject-matter jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief against the Family Court, it is first necessary to examine whether any other remedy is expressly provided to address the Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to the various Court Defendants in either the Supreme Court or the Family Court.</p>\n<p><center>               <strong>Historical Evolution of Rhode Island Courts</strong></center>\nIn 1905, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed sweeping legislation outlining the necessary structure, format, and procedure to be utilized in the judiciary branch. This legislation, entitled the Court and Practice Act (\"CPA\"), included sections covering the various lower courts and their officers (Title I); actions, pleading, practice, and procedure in the courts (Title II); writs, executions, and service thereof (Title III); probate courts (Title IV); estates of deceased <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 9</span> \npersons and those under guardianship (Title V); presentation and proof of claims against estates of deceased persons (Title VI); and fees and costs (Title VII).</p>\n<p>Title I, Chapter 2, of the CPA dealt specifically with the Superior Court. Section 2 (9) of Title 1 provided, in relevant part, that: \"the superior court shall have <em>exclusive original</em><em>jurisdiction</em>, except as otherwise provided by law, of suits and proceedings in equity, and of statutory proceedings following the course of equity, of petitions for divorce, separate maintenance, alimony, and custody of children.\" (Emphasis added.) <u>See also</u><u>Mowry v. Bliss</u>, <cross_reference>28 R.I. 114</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>115</cross_reference> (1907).<sup id=\"ref-fn4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Title I, Section 2 (9), of the CPA eventually evolved into &#167; <cross_reference>8-2-13</cross_reference> of the Rhode Island General Laws. That section, entitled \"Exclusive jurisdiction of equity actions,\" provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  \"The superior court shall, except as otherwise provided by law, have exclusive original jurisdiction of suits and proceedings of an equitable character and of statutory proceedings following the course of equity; provided, however, that every probate court shall have the power, concurrent with the superior court, to replace, remove, or fill any vacancy of any trustee under a trust established under a will, or to effect tax minimization or estate planning under &#167; <cross_reference>33-15-37.1</cross_reference>. If an action is brought in the superior court which represents an attempt in good faith to invoke the jurisdiction conferred by this section, the superior court shall have jurisdiction of all other actions arising out of the same transaction or occurrence, provided the other actions are joined with the action so brought or are subsequently made a part thereof under applicable procedural rules, and the court may retain jurisdiction over the other actions even though the initial action fails for want of equity jurisdiction.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Notwithstanding the enactment of the CPA, treatment of juvenile offenders at the time was still rather harsh. <u>See State v</u><u>Day</u>, <cross_reference>911 A.2d 1042</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1048</cross_reference> (R.I. 2006). In 1882, national legislation gave criminal courts discretion either to sentence juveniles to reform school or to impose such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 10</span> \npunishment as is otherwise provided by the law. <u>See</u> Laureen D'Ambra<sup id=\"ref-fn5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup>, <em>A Legal Response to Juvenile Crime: Why Waiver of</em><em>Juvenile Offenders is Not a Panacea</em>,<u>2 Roger Williams U.

In 1898, Rhode Island was the first state to legislatively mandate segregated, juvenile adjudicatory hearings. This new legislation provided for separate hearings, calendars and dockets for juvenile cases in Providence and Newport. <u>See</u> D'Ambra,<u>supra</u>, at 286 and Footnote 64 citing Rhode Island Governor's Justice Commission Statistical Analysis Center, Rep. No. 35, Juveniles in Rhode Island: An Overview of the State's Juvenile Justice System and a Data Analysis/Statistical Summary Thru Year 1993 (Feb. 1995). These procedures were extended to the rest of the State in 1915 with the enactment of the Juvenile Court Act.

Day</u>, <u>supra</u>, at 1049 citing R.I. P.L., 1961, Ch. <cross_reference>73</cross_reference>. <u>See also</u> D'Ambra, <u>supra</u> at 288.</p>\n<p>The Family Court's jurisdiction was both original and exclusive, and it extended to, among other things, the adjudication of matters involving juveniles alleged to be either wayward or delinquent.<u>See State v Day</u>, <cross_reference>911 A.2d 1042</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1048-1049</cross_reference> (R.I. 2006). Notwithstanding the above language, the Rhode Island Supreme Court, in <u>State v. Day</u>, noted that:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"As it exists today, the Family Court is a court of limited statutory jurisdiction, <u>State v.</u> <u>Kenney</u>, <cross_reference>523 A.2d 853</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>854</cross_reference> (R.I. 1987) (`the Family Court is a court of limited jurisdiction whose powers are strictly limited to those conferred by the Legislature'), and its governing statutes give it subject matter jurisdiction only over a very narrow range of criminal violations dealing with offenses committed by adults against either children or members of the offender's family.\" <u>State v Day</u>,  <u>supra</u>, at 1049.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, contained among the provisions of the above mentioned 1961 Family Court legislation, the Superior Court's equity jurisdiction remained intact in much the same form as it exists to this date. <u>See</u> specifically, chapter 73, &#167; 2, at p. 218 of the Public Laws of 1961 providing:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"Section <cross_reference>8-2-13</cross_reference> of the general laws, in chapter 8-2, entitled \"Superior court,\" is hereby amended to read as follows: \"<cross_reference>8-2-13</cross_reference>.

Jeremiah established the State's first Truancy Court at Hope High School, in the City of Providence. During the 2000-2001 school year, the Truancy Court was expanded to include courts in Woonsocket, Central Falls, Pawtucket and Newport. Truancy Courts are now present in thirty-three communities, servicing over one-hundred-fifty schools in forty-three separate locations.

Byrnes</u>, <cross_reference>456 A.2d 742</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>744</cross_reference> (R.I. 1983);<u>see also State v.

They refer specifically to the statute that created the Family Court, &#167; <cross_reference>8-10-3</cross_reference>, which provides in part:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"Establishment of court &#8212; Jurisdiction &#8212; Seal &#8212; Oaths. &#8212; (a) There is hereby established a family court, consisting of a chief judge and eleven (11) associate justices, <u>to hear and</u> <u>determine</u> . . . <u>those matters relating to</u> <u>delinquent, wayward, dependent, neglected, or</u> <u>children with disabilities</u> who by reason of any disability requires special education or treatment and other related services.\" (Emphasis added.)</blockquote></p>\n<p>Defendants essentially argue that this action requires an interpretation of Chapter 16-19 of the General Laws of Rhode Island, which has been exclusively delegated to the Family Court. As such, Defendants maintain that the Superior Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as previously indicated, Defendants have also suggested that there is potential to \"create a constitutional confrontation between two co-equal state courts.\" (Defendant Administrators' Mem. in Supp. of Their Mot. to Dismiss at 2.)</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' allegations, as set forth above and in the complaint, involve various procedural violations that they claim frequently occurred within the Truancy Courts. Plaintiffs insist that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 16</span> \nthey do not challenge the Truancy Courts' specific determinations of waywardness or delinquency. In fact, Plaintiffs have continually maintained that they do not intend for the Superior Court to become involved in the merits of any Truancy Court matter, and they agree that resolution of any adjudication of waywardness is a matter delegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Family Court. However, Plaintiffs do maintain that notwithstanding the merits of any adjudication on the issue of waywardness, the Superior Court is the proper forum to obtain both declaratory and injunctive relief with regard to requiring the Chief Judge, Court Defendants, and the Family Court to <u>adhere to the applicable state statutes</u><u>that outline the procedural rules that must be followed</u> in any Truancy Court adjudication. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p><center>             <strong>Supreme Court Jurisdiction &#8212; Supervisory Powers</strong></center>\nConsidering Defendants' suggestion regarding the potential for a \"constitutional confrontation between two co-equal state courts,\" and also in light of the relevant provisions of &#167; <cross_reference>8-1-2</cross_reference> relating to jurisdiction and supervisory powers of the Supreme Court, specifically providing: \"The supreme court shall have<u>general supervision</u> of all courts of inferior jurisdiction<u>to correct and prevent errors and abuses</u> therein<u>when no other remedy is expressly provided</u>; it may issue writs of habeas corpus, of error, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and all other extraordinary and prerogative writs and processes necessary for the furtherance of justice and the due administration of the law. . . .\" (emphasis added.), this Court must first analyze whether the subject-matter jurisdiction for this \"constitutional confrontation\" actually lies in the Supreme Court. When construing statutes, this Court's role is \"to determine and effectuate the Legislature's intent and to attribute to the enactment the meaning most consistent with its policies or obvious purposes.\" <u>State v Robinson</u>, <cross_reference>972 A.2d 150</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>158</cross_reference> (R.I. 2009) (quoting <u>Such v.

The Supreme Court has frequently stated that when the language of a statute is unambiguous and expresses a clear and sensible meaning, there is no need for statutory construction or the use of interpretive aids.

(emphasis added). The Rhode Island Supreme Court has, on different occasions, both assumed jurisdiction of a particular matter pursuant to &#167; <cross_reference>8-1-2</cross_reference>, and declined to exercise jurisdiction under the same section of law in a different matter.</p>\n<p>In <u>Cicilline v. Almond</u>, <cross_reference>809 A.2d 1101</cross_reference>, (2002), cases were consolidated where certain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 18</span> \nstate legislators<sup id=\"ref-fn8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup> and a beneficiary of a government-funded housing program filed lawsuits in December 2001 challenging the propriety of the governor's alleged decision to freeze certain spending on an affordable housing initiative. The cases were set down for hearing in the Superior Court and the Governor sought a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted the writ, consolidated the cases, and stayed the action in the Superior Court. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that due to legislative enactments subsequent to the filing of the lawsuits providing for alternative sources of funding for the housing program, the matter had become moot.</p>\n<p>While the matter was pending, some of the plaintiffs challenged the Supreme Court's jurisdiction pointing out that, pursuant to &#167; <cross_reference>8-2-13</cross_reference>, \"the superior court shall, except as otherwise provided by law, have exclusive original jurisdiction of suits and proceedings of an equitable character.\" The Supreme Court ruled on the challenge stating:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"Nevertheless, this Court retains the power of \"general supervision of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein when no other remedy is expressly provided.\" G.L. 1956 &#167; <cross_reference>8-1-2</cross_reference>. We can also issue writs of certiorari \"and all other extraordinary and prerogative writs and processes necessary for the furtherance of justice and the due administration of the law.\" <u>Id</u>. In addition, we have \"jurisdiction to adapt, to modify, or to frame new writs to meet the needs of the judicial system.\" <u>Estate of Sherman v.</u> <u>Almeida</u>,  <u><cross_reference>610 A.2d 104</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>106</cross_reference> (R.I. 1992)</u>. Thus, even though, when we issued the writ of certiorari, the trial court had not yet ruled in the Garabedian action except for scheduling a hearing thereon with the Cicilline/Graziano case to address unspecified matters relating to both complaints, this Court, in the exercise of the above-referenced powers, possessed jurisdiction over these actions that the Governor properly invoked when he petitioned the Court to issue a writ of certiorari to review the Superior Court's orders in these cases.\"</blockquote> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 19</span> </p>\n<p>Ultimately the Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"Based on this statute, the above-described posture of these cases, and the Court's inherent constitutional power to superintend trial court proceedings, we grant the petition for certiorari, quash the Superior Court's previously entered orders, and remand both cases to the Superior Court with directions to enter final judgments dismissing the Garabedian and Cicilline/Graziano actions as moot.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>In a different matter, the Supreme Court declined to exercise such jurisdiction. The case of <u>Cronan ex. rel. State v. Cronan</u>,<cross_reference>774 A.2d 866</cross_reference> (2001) illustrates the point in the context of a private criminal prosecution wherein the defendant was convicted of the charge of simple assault in the Superior Court.<sup id=\"ref-fn9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup>\nOn September 27, 1996, during an argument in their Barrington home, Mrs. Cronan claimed that defendant yanked her by the arm, shoved her, and kicked her. She swore out and filed a private criminal complaint against him in District Court on October 22, 1996, accusing him of assault. After arraigning defendant, the court transferred the case on January 30, 1997 to the Superior Court in accordance with Rule 23 of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.<sup id=\"ref-fn10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> Thereafter, in the Superior Court, the defendant waived his right to a jury trial. When the case was reached for trial, a state prosecutor from the Attorney General's office, who was present in court, declined to prosecute the case upon learning that Mrs. Cronan was prepared to proceed with her own private attorneys serving as the prosecutors for her complaint. Thereafter, without any objection from defendant, Mrs. Cronan's privately employed counsel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 20</span> \nprosecuted the assault charge against defendant, and the trial justice ultimately found him guilty as charged.<u>Id.</u> at 869.</p>\n<p>After hearing and denying defendant's motions for arrest of judgment and a new trial, defendant pursued an appeal in the Supreme Court. <u>Id.</u> at 870. After the Supreme Court upheld the viability of private prosecution of misdemeanor complaints,<u>Id.</u> at 870 &#8212; 872, it also ruled, contrary to defendant's other arguments, that that the Superior Court properly possessed subject-matter jurisdiction over the criminal complaint.<u>Id.</u> at 872. The Supreme Court distinguished the federal precedents relied upon by the defendant in comparison to the general jurisdiction of the Superior Court and rejected the defendant's suggestion that the Superior Court, as a court of general jurisdiction, nevertheless lacked the authority and competence to hear and decide the charge in this case because a private complainant-rather than one affiliated with or authorized by the Attorney General-initiated and prosecuted this charge to judgment. <u>Id.</u> at 874. In rejecting the defendant's suggestion, the Supreme Court held the Superior Court possessed the jurisdiction to decide whether the defendant was guilty of the assault charge, even though no attorney from the Attorney General's office prosecuted this case to judgment. The Supreme Court noted that although an attorney from the Attorney General's office deferred to the complainant's private prosecutors when this case was reached for trial in Superior Court, this event did not cause the Superior Court's jurisdiction to lapse.<sup id=\"ref-fn11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup> <u>Id.</u> at 874. In support of its position on the issue, the Supreme Court cited<u>State v Souza</u>, <cross_reference>456 A.2d 775</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>779</cross_reference> (R.I. 1983) (\"Absence of subject matter jurisdiction in the fundamental sense <u>is an</u><u>extreme determination when applied to a trial court of general</u><u>jurisdiction</u>.\") (citing <u>Stump v. Sparkman</u>,<cross_reference>435 U.S. 349</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>98 S.Ct. 1099</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>55 L.Ed.2d 331</cross_reference> (1978)). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 21</span> \n(Emphasis added here.) The Supreme Court went on to note that \"[N]either the General Assembly nor the Rhode Island Constitution has conditioned the Superior Court's subject-matter jurisdiction in misdemeanor cases such as this one upon the Attorney Genera's prosecution of the case, and because defendant raised no issue concerning the sufficiency of the complaint, it fell within the competence and authority of Rhode Island's court of general jurisdiction to hear and determine the charge against defendant. Thus, we hold that the Superior Court possessed subject-matter jurisdiction in this case.\" <u>Id.</u> at 874.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court also felt that it was significant that the<u>Cronan</u> case was not a case where the Attorney General had advised the Superior Court and the private complainant that, in the Attorney General's opinion, the charge should be dismissed or that the Attorney General's office wished to assume responsibility for prosecuting the case to judgment. <u>Id.</u> at 874. The Supreme Court noted that \"[I]n other contexts we have stressed the unique position of the Attorney General in Rhode Island's constitutional system. Indeed, the essential powers of that office require it to be able to exercise its discretion and judgment concerning the prosecution of criminal charges, even in misdemeanor cases like this one.\" (internal citations omitted.) <u>Id.</u> at 874-75. The Supreme Court continued, \"[T]hese cases explicitly affirm the proposition that the office of Attorney General possesses the exclusive power to dismiss criminal charges . . .and that its power to do so derives from <u>article <cross_reference>9</cross_reference>, section <cross_reference>1</cross_reference> of the Rhode Island Constitution</u>.\" (internal citations omitted.) <u>Id.</u> at 875. The Supreme Court concluded its analysis by noting that the Attorney General may . . . \"cause a criminal case, including one initiated via a private complaint, to be dismissed at any time before the imposition of sentence.\" (internal citations omitted.). <u>Id.</u> at 875.</p>\n<p>The defendant also urged the Supreme Court to exercise its supervisory authority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 22</span> \ncontained in &#167; <cross_reference>8-1-2</cross_reference> over the Superior Court and declare \"that employment of interested private prosecutors is error so fundamental that any conviction gained by such a prosecution must be reversed without showing of actual prejudice.\"<u>Id.</u> at 876-77. After distinguishing the authorities cited by the defendant in support of his argument, and further noting that \"the General Assembly has specifically provided for prosecutions based upon a complaint filed by a private individual\", the Supreme Court declined to assume jurisdiction of the case. In support of its analysis, the Supreme Court expressly held,</p>\n<p><blockquote>    \"[I]n sum, given the historical and statutory pedigree of private prosecutions in this state, as well as the particular procedural posture of this case, we decline to exercise our supervisory powers to establish a <em>per</em> <em>se</em> rule prohibiting private prosecutions like this one. <em>Cf.</em> <u>State v. Jackson</u>,  <cross_reference>570 A.2d 1115</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1117</cross_reference> (R.I. 1990) (explaining that the Court's supervisory power \"<u>should be</u> <u>exercised with great restraint after balancing</u> <u>carefully the societal interests involved</u>\") (citing <u>United States v.

The ordinary purpose of a Writ of Prohibition is to restrain an inferior tribunal from acting without jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction, and will not be granted when a petitioner therefor has an adequate remedy by review, if the inferior tribunal should so act.<u>McLaughlin v. McLaughlin</u>, <cross_reference>44 R.I. 429</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>117 A. 649</cross_reference> (1922). In that case, the Supreme Court granted the writ because of the particular nature of a divorce proceeding, and there was no appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court at that time. <u>Id.</u> 650. As a result, the petitioner might be left without adequate relief by the ordinary methods for review. <u>Id.</u> 650.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a Writ of Prohibition rests in the discretion of the Supreme Court and, under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 26</span> \nthe practice in this State, is rarely granted where there is another adequate remedy. <u>Narragansett Racing Ass'n v. Kiernan</u>,<cross_reference>59 R.I. 90</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>104</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>194 A. 692</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>700</cross_reference> (1937). In the case of <u>Fox v</u><u>Personnel appeal Board of the City of Cranston</u>,<cross_reference>98 R.I. 46</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>199 A.2d 585</cross_reference> (1964), the Rhode Island Supreme Court declined to issue a Writ of Prohibition to a police officer seeking to prevent a hearing on departmental charges of neglect of duty and conduct unbecoming a police officer. The Supreme Court noted that the writ was issued rarely and almost never when any other remedy was available. The Supreme Court noted that injunctive relief was available in equity and more commensurate with the circumstances of the case than the extraordinary Writ of Prohibition.<u>Id.</u> <cross_reference>98 R.I. at 47</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>199 A.2d 586</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p><center>                          <strong>Writ of Habeas Corpus</strong></center>\nThe specific example provided to this Court by Defendants in an appendix to their filings clearly demonstrates that the Writ of Habeas Corpus would adequately serve to release someone from custody. Besides the fact that this remedy is also discretionary, resort to this remedy would require that an individual actually be in custody. The Writ, while it could be combined with other petitions to review errors, would not be useful to review situations where error was alleged but there was no remand to custody. While this Court has not interpreted the Defendants' suggestion regarding this Writ as all-encompassing, the need to combine two discretionary writs related to error review and release from custody leave this Court questioning the adequacy of what may amount to remedy by piecemeal litigation.</p>\n<p><center>           <strong>Complete Delegation of Jurisdiction to Family Court</strong><strong>or</strong> <strong>Equitable Jurisdiction in Superior Court?</strong></center>\nIn order to answer the above question regarding whether the matters described in the complaint have been completely delegated to the Family Court, or whether they remain subject <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 27</span> \nto the equitable jurisdiction of the Superior Court, it is first necessary to articulate with a high degree of precision exactly what the Plaintiffs would like the Superior Court to do. The analysis will contain several components including scrutiny of the Plaintiffs' complaint and their specific prayers for relief, examination of each particular statute that relates to each of Plaintiffs specific claims for relief; the plain meaning of the words in each instance, and the process of statutory construction if there is an ambiguity after considering the plain meaning of the words.</p>\n<p>It is important to note at this juncture that while both sides in the instant dispute have cited court rules in support of their respective positions in addition to statutes, and while &#167; <cross_reference>8-6-2</cross_reference>(a) specifically provides that a court rule, when effective, shall supersede any statutory regulation in conflict therewith, <u>Tonetti Enterprises, LLC v. Mendon Road Leasing</u><u>Corp.</u>, <cross_reference>943 A.2d 1063</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1071</cross_reference> (R.I. 2008), it is a well-established principle that procedural rule-making authority may not be used to expand a court's jurisdiction. The United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"An authority conferred upon a court to make rules of procedure for the exercise of its jurisdiction is not an authority to enlarge that jurisdiction; and the Act * * * authorizing this Court to prescribe rules of procedure in civil actions gave it no authority to modify, abridge or enlarge the substantive rights of litigants or to enlarge or diminish the jurisdiction of federal courts.\" <u>United</u> <u>States v. Sherwood</u>,  <cross_reference>312 U.S. 584</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>589-90</cross_reference> (1941).</blockquote></p>\n<p>The Rhode Island Supreme Court specifically embraced this concept in<u>State v. Robinson et als</u>, <cross_reference>972 A.2d 150</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>158-59</cross_reference> (R.I. 2009), expressly holding that the District Court \"simply does not have the authority to promulgate a rule that expands the jurisdiction of the District Court because that is a right that lies solely within the province of the General Assembly.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 28</span> </p>\n<p><center>               <strong>Equitable Powers and Plaintiffs' Complaint</strong></center>\nWhile it is clear that the Superior Court has equitable powers, our Supreme Court has previously indicated that the Family Court has no general equitable power. <u>In re Stephanie B.</u>,<cross_reference>826 A.2d 985</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>993</cross_reference> (R.I. 2003); <u>Waldeck v.

In the case of electronic court recordings the person making the recordings or another person so designated by the court may be requested or ordered, in lieu of making a transcript, to reproduce the recording and certify its authenticity, and in such case each party requesting the reproduction shall pay to the court the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) per cassette.</blockquote></p>\n<p>The parties could not be further apart on this issue. Plaintiffs argue that without such a transcript, there can be no meaningful appeal. Cases supporting that proposition in this jurisdiction are legion. <u>See e.g. Resendes v Brown</u>;<cross_reference>966 A2d 1249</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1256-57</cross_reference> (2009) (\"The Family Court is a court of record, G.L. 1956 &#167; <cross_reference>8-10-3</cross_reference>(b), and the business of the court should not ordinarily be conducted by chamber conferences because this practice results in an \"absence of evidence and fact-finding.\").<u>See also In re Stephanie B.</u>, <cross_reference>826 A.2d 985</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>991</cross_reference> (R.I. 2003).

The Judicial Defendants acknowledge the potential for this Court to engage in limited fact finding regarding the issue of subject matter jurisdiction as well. (<u>See</u> Judicial Defs.'

The Superior Court denied the attorney's motion for summary judgment and entered judgment for defendant, and the attorney appealed. The trial justice rested his action on three grounds. They were: (1) his doubt that the administrator had promulgated a rule calling for the payment of the ten-dollar fee; (2) his belief that when the General Assembly in 1971 authorized the increase of certain fees charged in the Superior Court, it actually had in mind fees payable to the Family Court; and (3) his thought that the Superior Court could not review the rules of the Family Court. <u>Id.</u><cross_reference>111 R.I. at 356</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302 A.2d at 302-03</cross_reference>. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 37</span> \nThe Supreme Court reversed holding that the trial justice erred. The trial justice had observed that, since the Superior Court's jurisdiction in the field of domestic relations had been transferred in 1961 to the Family Court, the reference to `in domestic relations' means the Family Court. <cross_reference>111 R.I. at 358</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302 A.2d at 303</cross_reference>. The General Assembly, at the January, 1971 session, enacted P.L. 1971, Ch. <cross_reference>147</cross_reference> into law. Attached to the bill was an explanation of its contents. The explanation, which was prepared by the Legislative Council, states that the bill would increase the fees charged in the Superior and District Courts. The portion of the bill that is relevant to this appeal reads as follows:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  `Section 1. Sections <cross_reference>9-29-18</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>9-29-1</cross_reference> of the general laws in chapter 9-29 entitled `Fees' are hereby amended to read as follows:</p>\n<p>  `9-29-18 Superior Court Fees.-The superior court shall be allowed the following fees in full to be taxed in the bill of costs in every civil action: For the entry of every action, bill or petition at law, in equity, in domestic relations or other civil action. . . . $10.00.'  <u>Id.</u> <cross_reference>111 R.I. at 357</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302 A.2d at 303</cross_reference>.</blockquote></p>\n<p>Ultimately the Supreme Court, construing all relevant statutes, held that the obvious purpose of the amendment was to increase the fees charged in the Superior Court; and the defendant would gain no benefit from other statutes containing a linkage between the Family Court and Superior Court given the precise wording of those statutes. <u>Id.</u> <cross_reference>111 R.I. at 358</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302 A.2d at 303</cross_reference>. The Supreme Court also noted \"The trial justice's reluctance to sit in judgment of the internal business affairs of the Family Court is understandable. However, this is a declaratory judgment action. Jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings is vested solely in the Superior Court. Section <cross_reference>9-30-1</cross_reference>.\"<sup id=\"ref-fn29\"><a href=\"#fn29\">29</a></sup></p>\n<p><center>                  <u>No Dismissal for Want of Jurisdiction</u> <u>without Evidentiary Hearing</u> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 38</span> </center>\nGiven that Defendants have not filed answers denying any of the allegations contained in the complaint, and also given that Plaintiffs have joined a claim for equitable relief that is clearly not within the jurisdiction of the Family Court, the issue is one this Court will decline to dismiss at this stage on grounds of a failure of subject-matter jurisdiction. While the<u>Berberian</u> case dealt only with a declaratory judgment action at a time when such an action was vested solely within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, in this instance, the Superior Court, sitting in equity, being a court of general equity jurisdiction, has the right and duty in the first instance to pass on its own jurisdiction. <u>Poirier v. Quinn</u>,<cross_reference>83 R.I. 98</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>113 A.2d 642</cross_reference> (1955). This Court noted earlier that, in determining whether there is subject matter jurisdiction, it will be necessary to have the Plaintiffs articulate with a high degree of precision exactly what the Plaintiffs would like the Superior Court to do. With regard to the prayer for declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs have prayed that this Court issue such relief against the Defendant Family Court Administrators. This Court will not speculate on all of the nuances related to such relief at this stage in order to avoid having the exact proofs specifically tailored to such speculation at future proceedings on the issue. In conducting this future inquiry, this Court enjoys broad authority to order discovery, consider extrinsic evidence, and hold evidentiary hearings in order to determine its own jurisdiction.<u>See e.g</u>. <u>Valentin v.

As indicated above, the Family Court also has the ability to issue a declaratory judgment (Footnote 26, <u>supra</u>), however, while Rule 57 is contained in the Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations, there is no like provision in the Rules of Juvenile Proceedings. While it remains to be determined on precisely what terms and conditions, and exactly when such conduct occurred, it is important to note that the Rhode Island Supreme Court has issued an opinion regarding ex-parte communication. <u>See Arnold v.</u><u>Lebel</u>, <cross_reference>941 A.2d 813</cross_reference> (2007). In the specific context described in<u>Arnold</u>, (disabled adults' applications to Department of Human Services for assistance benefits), the Supreme Court held that G. L. 1956 &#167; <cross_reference>42-35-13</cross_reference> of the Administrative Procedures Act, (APA) prohibited ex-parte communications with anyone about contested or material adjudicatory facts or opinions concerning the merits of an applicant's administrative appeal. <u>Id.</u> at 820. The Court went on to hold that the function of the statutory requirement was to prevent litigious facts from reaching the decision-maker off the record in an administrative hearing. <u>Id.</u> at 820. The Court did, however, indicate that the same statute specifically authorized hearing officers to engage in ex-parte communication with agency staff members about general matters pertaining to the discharge of his or her duties. Such general matters would include private communications concerning procedure or timing. <u>Id.</u> at 821. Finally, the Supreme Court indicated that in accordance with two (2) other specific sections of the APA, <sup id=\"ref-fn30\"><a href=\"#fn30\">30</a></sup> that the hearing officer must provide notice to the parties before a hearing if he or she intends to consult any documentary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 40</span> \nsource or person concerning facts or opinions about the merits of an appeal. In addition, the parties must be afforded an opportunity to contest any such evidence and to cross-examine any people consulted. The Supreme Court noted that this was similar to the regulations followed by many federal agencies. <u>Id.</u> at 821. <u>See also</u><u>Champlin's Realty Associates v. Tikoian</u>, <cross_reference>989 A.2d 427</cross_reference> (2010), where the Rhode Island Supreme Court analyzed a host of various ex-parte communications occurring in the context of an administrative appeal of a decision of the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC).The ex parte communications occurred between the chairman and other CRMC members, as well as between the chairman, various CRMC members, and others not on the CRMC. While noting that engaging in ex-parte contacts alone does not automatically render a decision maker biased, the Supreme Court discussed the obligation of impartiality for any administrative agency carrying out a quasi-judicial function and specifically noted that \"under the<cross_reference>Fourteenth Amendment</cross_reference>, administrative tribunals must not be biased or otherwise indisposed from rendering a fair and impartial decision.\"<u>Id.</u> at 443.

Given the details still needing full context, this Court declines to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><center>                 <u>Intake procedures, arraignments, orders</u> <u>subsequent to arraignment, personal jurisdiction</u></center>\nPlaintiffs have prayed for a declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Defendant Court Administrators relative to the arraignment procedures. The two sections of law dealing with arraignment procedures provide in relevant part:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-10</cross_reference> Preliminary investigation on</strong> <strong>information furnished to</strong> <strong>court.</strong> &#8212; Except in case of emergency detention, whenever any appropriate person shall give to the court information in his or her possession that a child is within the provisions of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the court to make a preliminary investigation to determine whether the interests of the public or of the child require that further action be taken, and to report its findings together with a statement of the facts to the judge. The inquiry may include a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 41</span> \npreliminary investigation of the home and environmental situation of the child, his or her previous history, and the circumstances which were the subject of the information. <u>To avoid</u> <u>duplication of effort and to take full advantage</u> <u>of all existing facilities, the report of any</u> <u>public agency, or of any private social agency</u> <u>licensed by the department of children, youth,</u> <u>and families, may be accepted by the court as</u> <u>sufficient evidence for the filing of a</u> <u>petition</u>.\" (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>  And,</p>\n<p>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-11</cross_reference> Authorizing and filing</strong> <strong>petition.</strong> &#8212; (a) The <u>filing of the petition</u> <u>constitutes assumption of jurisdiction over the</u> <u>child</u>.

This Court notes that our Supreme Court has held that such investigations serve primarily to shield the child from arbitrary bureaucratic action and also to forestall the Family Court from assuming jurisdiction when such would ill serve the interests of the juvenile and the public.<u>In re Leon</u>, <cross_reference>122 R.I. 548</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>410 A.2d 121</cross_reference> (1980). While preliminary and permanent injunctive relief are not available in the Family Court, <u>In re Stephanie B.</u>, <u>supra</u>, this Court is still concerned with the language of &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-5</cross_reference> providing, in relevant part <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 42</span> \nthat the Family Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings \"(1) <u>Concerning</u> any child residing or being within the state who is: (i) delinquent; [or] (ii) wayward\", (emphasis added), and whether the statutory construction should be undertaken in the Family Court or the Superior Court.</p>\n<p>This Court must also examine the statutory authority of the Defendant Administrators. The statute specifically provides:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>&#167; <cross_reference>8-10-15</cross_reference> Family court</strong> <strong>administrator.</strong> &#8212; (a) There shall be a family court administrator who shall be appointed by the chief judge of the family court in his or her capacity as administrative judge of the court, with the advice and consent of the senate, and who shall hold office for a term of five (5) years.</p>\n<p>  (b) <u>Under the general supervision of the chief</u> <u>judge of the family court, within the policies</u> <u>established by the court</u>, the administrator shall:</p>\n<p>  (1) Prepare an annual budget for the court;</p>\n<p>  (2) Formulate procedures governing the administration of court services;</p>\n<p>  (3) Make recommendations to the court for improvement in court services;</p>\n<p>  (4) Collect necessary statistics and prepare the annual report of the work of the court;</p>\n<p>  (5) Provide supervision and consultation to the staff of the court concerning administration of court services, training and supervision of personnel, and fiscal management;</p>\n<p>  (6) <u>Perform such other duties as the chief</u> <u>judge shall specify</u>;</p>\n<p>  (7) And further to assume and perform, in addition to any other duties provided by this chapter, the powers, authority, and the duties of the family court clerk, pursuant to the provisions of the general laws, and shall do and perform all other things which by law or the rules of the court shall appertain to the office of clerk.\" (emphasis added).</blockquote> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 43</span> </p>\n<p>The above section must be read in conjunction with &#167; <cross_reference>8-10-14</cross_reference> providing for the Administration of the Family Court. The section specifically provides:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>8-10-14</cross_reference> Administration of operation of</strong> <strong>family court.</strong> &#8212; The <u>chief judge</u> of the family court shall be the administrative judge of the court. <u>He or she shall be the head of the</u> <u>court and have supervision and control</u> of the calendars and of the assignment of the justices.  <u>All court stenographers, secretaries, and</u> <u>masters shall be under his or her</u> <u>supervision.</u> It shall be his or her duty to gather such statistics as shall reflect accurately the work of the court, for the information of the court and such other use as he or she may deem expedient. He or she shall also be charged with general responsibility for any recommendations he or she may believe important for the work of the court or any officers in any way connected therewith.\" (emphasis added).</blockquote></p>\n<p>A review of the above sections clearly indicates that the Defendant Administrators are not vested with unfettered discretion. The limits of their discretion are the proper subject of an evidentiary hearing in the context of any motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have also included a prayer for declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against the Defendant Magistrates relative to the arraignment and issuance of court orders against members of the Plaintiff Class over whom personal jurisdiction has not been established. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that such activity is a violation of their Due Process rights under both the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. As set forth above, pursuant to &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-11</cross_reference>, the filing of a petition constitutes assumption of jurisdiction over the child. Section <cross_reference>14-1-16</cross_reference> provides for a summons to issued to at least one parent or guardian if at all possible.</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-16</cross_reference> Summons of child or adult in charge</strong> <strong>of child.</strong> &#8212; Upon the filing of a petition, the justice, if satisfied that there is reasonable cause for the petition, may issue a summons requiring the child to appear before the court at a time and place named in it, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 44</span>  <u>and shall also cause a summons to be issued</u> <u>to at least one of the parents of the child if</u> <u>either of them is known to reside within the</u> <u>state</u>, or if there is no parent, then to the guardian or other lawful custodian of the child, if there is one known to be so resident, and, if not, then to the person with whom the child resides, if known.\" (emphasis added).</blockquote></p>\n<p>The word \"<u>shall</u>\" usually connotes the imperative and contemplates the imposition of a duty. <u>Brown v Amaral</u>,<cross_reference>460 A.2d 7</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>10</cross_reference> (R.I. 1983). While it appears that a petition would automatically provide for a summons to bring the adult properly before the Family Court, the actual policy of the Truancy Court in this respect is unclear in the context of the complaint. This Court also has the same concern with the language of &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-5</cross_reference> providing, in relevant part, that the Family Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings \"(1) <u>Concerning</u> any child residing or being within the state who is: (i) delinquent; [or] (ii) wayward\", (emphasis added), and whether the statutory construction should be undertaken in the Family Court or the Superior Court. (discussed above).</p>\n<p>Regardless of which court should undertake the statutory construction, the law regarding a failure to duly serve an individual is fairly clear in this jurisdiction. It is a fundamental principle of procedural due process \"that a court may not issue a judgment or order against a person in the absence of personal jurisdiction.\" <u>In re Stephanie B</u>.,<u><cross_reference>826 A.2d 985</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>993</cross_reference> (R.I. 2003)</u>. \"When a party is appropriately before the Court, having been properly served with process, and has entered an appearance or appeared specially to contest jurisdiction, the court is vested with jurisdiction. . .\" <u>Id</u>. <u>See also</u><u>Guertin v. Guertin</u>, <cross_reference>870 A.2d 1011</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1020</cross_reference> (2005). (\"Because Mrs. Sticca-Guertin was not named as a party, was not served with process, and did not waive service of the summons and complaint, she cannot be a party, and the Family Court had no jurisdiction over her. Consequently, the injunction entered against her is void.\"). Even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 45</span> \nthough Mrs. Guertin<sup id=\"ref-fn32\"><a href=\"#fn32\">32</a></sup> testified during the trial, her presence did not cure the due process deficiency, constitute an entry of appearance, or transform her into a party. <u>Id.</u> at 1020.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Family Court has the statutory authority to order a disposition of any child. Section <cross_reference>14-1-32</cross_reference> provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-32</cross_reference> Power of court to order disposition</strong> <strong>of child.</strong> &#8212; If the court finds that a child is delinquent, wayward, neglected, dependent, or otherwise within the provisions of this chapter, it may by order duly entered proceed as follows: . . .</p>\n<p>  (1) . . . the court may order that appropriate monetary restitution be made immediately to the owner of the damaged property by the child, his or her parent, parents . . .</p>\n<p>  (3) . . . The court may order the parent or parents of the child to undertake a program of counseling, which program shall be designed to attempt to remedy those conditions which led to the child's coming before the court.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>The statute contemplates action against the parent or parents. The issue is one of service.</p>\n<p>This Court declines to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction without an evidentiary hearing on the issues discussed in this section, specifically, failure to investigate a petition and make the requisite determinations by the intake department, and arraignment and issuance of orders against members of the putative class without first acquiring jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p><center>                <u>Interpreters, information at arraignment,</u> <u>counsel, due process, and waivers</u></center>\nLanguage interpreters have been required to assist those who are unable to readily understand and communicate in the English language, and who are involved in legal proceedings in criminal matters before the Superior Court, District Court, or in juvenile matters in the Family Court since 1999. Sections <cross_reference>8-19-1</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>8-19-2</cross_reference> (4). The statute furthers the State's goal of providing <u>meaningful</u> access to criminal legal proceedings for all people who come before the courts. <u>State v.</u><u>Lopez-Navor</u>, <cross_reference>951 A.2d 508</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>513</cross_reference> (R.I. 2008). The Rhode Island Supreme Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 46</span> \nnoted that as of July 10, 2008, <sup id=\"ref-fn33\"><a href=\"#fn33\">33</a></sup> that the United States Supreme Court has not recognized a constitutional right to a court-appointed interpreter. <u>Id.</u> at 513. In its opinion, the Supreme Court went on to hold \"that a trial justice is entrusted with the discretion to appoint an interpreter if he or she determines that a defendant is unable to understand the English language adequately * * *.\" (Citing <u>State v. Ibrahim</u>,<u><cross_reference>862 A.2d 787</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>797</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>798</cross_reference> (R.I. 2004)</u>).

Plaintiffs also argue that by permitting children members of the Plaintiff Class to waive their right to counsel without first consulting with counsel (Complaint paragraph 285), Defendant Court Administrators and Magistrates have again violated their Due Process rights. In their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs have requested only declaratory relief against the Defendant Magistrates. (Complaint paragraphs 309, 310, 311). They have not sought relief on those Counts against the Defendant Administrators, nor have they sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>The right to counsel is specifically addressed in Chapter 14-1 dealing with delinquent and dependent children. Section <cross_reference>14-1-32</cross_reference> provides:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-31</cross_reference> Services of</strong> <strong>public defender.</strong> &#8212; Prior to the commencement of <u>any hearing</u>, the justice shall advise the parent or guardian of any child, or the adult involved, as the case may be, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 47</span> \nthat if he or she is financially unable to engage counsel, he or she is entitled to the services of the public defender. The public defender shall, at the request of a justice of the family court, appear in court on behalf of that person.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have prayed for a declaratory judgment only against Defendant Magistrates relative to permitting child members of the Plaintiff class to waive their right to counsel without first consulting with counsel, claiming that was a violation of Plaintiffs Due Process rights as well as those secured under &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-31</cross_reference> While Defendants have argued that the violation was only a civil violation, the United States Supreme Court has held that there is no material difference, with respect to right to counsel, between adult and juvenile proceedings in which adjudication of delinquency is sought. They further held that a proceeding wherein the issue is whether a child will be found to be delinquent and subjected to loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to felony prosecution. <u>In re</u><u>Gault</u>, <cross_reference>387 U.S. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>36</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>87 S.Ct. 1428</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1448</cross_reference> (1967).

The Supreme Court also held that [after indicating] that \"the assistance of counsel is essential for purposes of waiver proceedings, so we hold now that it is equally essential for the determination of delinquency, carrying with it the awesome prospect of incarceration,\" quoting <u>Kent v.

In its comments on due process, the Court went on to further hold, \"As a component part of fair hearing required by due process, notice of the right to counsel should be required at all juvenile delinquency proceedings and counsel should be provided on request when family is financially unable to employ counsel.\" <u>Id.</u> <cross_reference>387 U.S. at 39</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>87 S.Ct. at 1450</cross_reference>. The Due Process clause of <cross_reference>Fourteenth Amendment</cross_reference> requires that in respect of proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to institution in which a juvenile's freedom is curtailed, the child and his parents must be notified of child's right to be represented by counsel retained by them, or if they are unable to afford counsel, that counsel will be appointed to represent the child. Furthermore, a juvenile charged with delinquency and his parents had an express right to be advised that they might retain counsel and to be confronted with need for specific consideration of whether they did or did not choose to waive that right, and, if they were unable to afford to employ counsel, they were entitled, in view of seriousness of charge and potential commitment, to appointed counsel unless they chose to waive the right. <u>Id.</u><cross_reference>387 U.S. at 41</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>87 S.Ct. at 1451</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>In this jurisdiction, the Rhode Island Supreme Court recognized the importance of the right and held that a juvenile who was found wayward for committing an assault on a teacher was entitled to counsel and applied the law set forth in <u>Gault</u>.<u>Gonsalves v.

A finding that there has been a waiver is essentially fact driven with the fact finding process to be performed by the justice or magistrate who presided over the proceeding where the waiver is alleged to have occurred.<sup id=\"ref-fn35\"><a href=\"#fn35\">35</a></sup> In the criminal context, a waiver of a constitutional right must be voluntary, and a waiver must be a knowing and intelligent act done with sufficient awareness of relevant circumstances and likely consequences to be enforceable. In determining whether a waiver of a constitutional right has been voluntary, knowing and intelligent, courts may take into consideration totality of circumstances and facts surrounding a particular case. <u>Wilkicki v.

This Court also notes that regarding the right to receive the benefit of counsel prior to waiving any rights and proceeding to Truancy Court, the Plaintiffs have only asked for a declaratory judgment against Defendant Magistrates, and have not asked for preliminary or permanent injunctive relief. (Complaint paragraph 311.) While it is possible that the jurisdiction may be concurrent, this Court will not dismiss at this stage for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction without an evidentiary hearing. Again, given all of the factors discussed thus far, and given that the issue is extremely abstract, this Court will not speculate on any scenario that will result in a finding of jurisdiction, or lack of jurisdiction, in an effort to avoid the shaping of any proof brought out in an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p><center>                      <u><cross_reference>42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983</cross_reference> Jurisdiction</u></center>\nIt is undisputed that the Superior Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts over civil rights actions pursuant to <cross_reference>42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983</cross_reference>. <u>DiCiantis v.

The <u>Pulliam</u> case and its holding actually provided the impetus to change the existing law to its current form which specifically provides an exception to those acts undertaken within the scope of a judge's judicial capacity. (<u>See</u> underlined section in statute below).</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"<cross_reference>42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983</cross_reference>.

The Rhode Island Supreme Court has explained that \"[t]he principle is generally accepted that when two courts of the same state have concurrent jurisdiction over a claim and the claim is asserted in both courts, the court in which the claim was first asserted has priority of jurisdiction and the second court must defer to it.\" <u>Lippman v. Kay</u>,<cross_reference>415 A.2d 738</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>741</cross_reference> (R.I. 1980). (cited by Defendant Administrators in support of their Motion to Dismiss pp. 13-15). But the Supreme Court also went on to state:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"Less clear is the application of this rule when the actions in the two courts are not identical. On the one hand, the priority principle usually applies when the two pending actions, although not technically identical, involve the same parties and subject matter and call for the same relief. <u>Welsh v. Personnel Board of</u> <u>Pawtucket</u>,  <cross_reference>101 R.I. 187</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>191</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>221 A.2d 476</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>478</cross_reference> (1966);  <u>Blake v.</u> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 54</span>  <u>Butler</u>, <cross_reference>10 R.I. 133</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>137</cross_reference> (1872); <u>State</u> <u>ex rel.

On the other hand, when the parties are not identical, <em>see</em> <u>Boston  Providence</u> <u>Railroad v. New York  New England Railroad</u>,  <cross_reference>12 R.I. 220</cross_reference> (1878), or when the two actions although related seek divergent types of relief,  <u>see Welsh</u>, <u>supra</u>, it may not be improper for the second court to assume jurisdiction and proceed with the case. <u>See</u> <u>also Autry v. District Court</u>, 459 P.2d at 867. As one commentator has explained,</p>\n<p>  `It is not true that a court, having obtained jurisdiction of the subject-matter of a suit and of parties before it, thereby excludes all other courts from the right to adjudicate upon other matters having a very close connection with those before the first court, and in some instances requiring the decision of exactly the same questions. In examining into the exclusive character of the jurisdiction of such cases, regard must be had to the nature of the remedies, the character of the relief sought, and the identity of the parties in the different suits.' 1 Bailey, [\"The Law of Jurisdiction\" 62 (1899)],  <u>supra</u> at 62.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>This Court does not read Plaintiffs' Complaint, at this stage, as challenging a specific ruling. The relief prayed for including declaratory judgments and instances of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief all appear to involve endeavors by the Plaintiffs to require the Family Court and Truancy Court to adhere strictly to its statutory procedures, as well as those procedures that have been developed under well recognized case law. The Rhode Island Supreme Court, as recently as 2007, characterized comity as \"a largely discretionary and somewhat amorphous concept\" in the context of an opinion relative to the availability of a divorce action within the Family Court to dissolve a gay marriage between two partners who had married in another state. <u>See Chambers v. Ormiston</u>,<cross_reference>935 A.2d 956</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>965</cross_reference> (R.I. 2007). The Court further indicated that considerations of comity do not come into play if the court lacks jurisdiction over the case before it. <u>Id.</u></p>\n<p>The Rhode Island Supreme Court has also considered judicial economy along with comity in holding that the Superior Court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction on a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 55</span> \nparticular matter until the Bankruptcy Court either had abstained, refused to reopen, or otherwise declined to pass on the merits of the parties' dispute, or adjudicated the effect of the prior owner's default under the plan on the city's tax lien. <u>See Nationwide</u><u>Life Ins. Co. v. Annarino</u>, <cross_reference>727 A.2d 200</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>203</cross_reference> (R.I. 1999). Defendants have also cited a Superior Court bench decision in<u>McKenna v. Healey et al</u>, PC/2009-4179. The bench decision, declining to exercise jurisdiction relative to a Workers Compensation Court issue on principles of comity, notes that there are \"alternative avenues of appeal\" (Tr., p. 85, ll. 12-14), and noting that \"It would be inappropriate to issue injunctive relief, particularly where there is an adequate remedy elsewhere.\" (Tr., p. 94, ll. 8-10). In 1966, the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that a taxpayer which failed to avail itself of statutory remedies including administrative review of the correctness of a use tax assessment and for judicial review of action of administrator with respect thereto was precluded from challenging tax as invalidly assessed for administrator's alleged failure to comply with the statutes, or challenging procedural provisions as depriving it of property without due process of law. <u>See Langton v. Brady Elec.</u><u>Co.</u>, <cross_reference>100 R.I. 366</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>369</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>216 A.2d 134</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>136</cross_reference> (R.I. 1966). The Supreme Court also articulated:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"In these circumstances it is essential that we distinguish the instant case from those in which the doctrine of the exhaustion of administrative remedies has application. In  <u>United States v. Fritz Properties, Inc., D.C.,</u> <u><cross_reference>89 F.Supp. 772</cross_reference>, at page 777</u>, the court said that the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies `is a product of judicial self-limitation resembling the requirement of equity jurisdiction-that a litigant <u>has no standing in equity where he</u> <u>has an adequate remedy at law-although matters of</u> <u>comity and need for</u> <u>orderly administrative procedure helped shape the</u> <u>doctrine</u>.'\" <u>See Smith v. Highway Board,</u> <u><cross_reference>117 Vt. 343</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>91 A.2d 805</cross_reference></u>. <u>Id.</u> <cross_reference>100 R.I. at 137</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>216 A.2d at 371</cross_reference>. (emphasis added).</blockquote></p>\n<p>Rhode Island Courts readily adhere to the rule that equity will not intervene in circumstances in which there is an adequate remedy at law. <u>See Wickes Asset Management, Inc. v. Dupuis</u>,<cross_reference>679 A.2d 314</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>322</cross_reference> (R.I. 1996). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 56</span> \n(Tax abatement petition in which equitable claims were barred). Plaintiffs have asked for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in several of their prayers for said relief. An injunction is an extraordinary remedy available only when there is no adequate remedy at law. <u>Ward v. City of Pawtucket Police Department</u>,<cross_reference>639 A.2d 1379</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1382</cross_reference> (R.I. 1994). <u>See also Brown v. Amaral</u>,<cross_reference>460 A.2d 7</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>10</cross_reference> (R.I. 1983). An appeal has been found to be an adequate remedy at law in some instances. <u>See Zito v. East Side</u><u>Associates</u>, <cross_reference>119 R.I. 629</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>381 A.2d 1364</cross_reference> (1978) (an order vacating a lis pendens has the requisite finality on a matter which is collateral to the main action so as to be immediately appealable pursuant to Gen. Laws &#167; <cross_reference>9-24-1</cross_reference>.). However the rule is most often applied in the context of a discretionary decision to deny a petition for certiorari in light of the ability of an aggrieved party to file an appeal of a final judgment, decree or order of the<u>Superior Court</u>. (emphasis added). While &#167; <cross_reference>9-24-1</cross_reference> itself indicates no application to actions in the Family Court, &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-52</cross_reference>, discussed below, incorporates Chapter 9-24 by reference.</p>\n<p>In the instant case, as discussed above, &#167; <cross_reference>8-10-3.1</cross_reference>, entitled \"Magistrates &#8212; Appointment, duties, and powers\", specifically provides in subsections (d) and (e):</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"(d) A party aggrieved by an order entered by a magistrate <u>shall be entitled to a review of</u> <u>the order by a justice of the family court.</u> <u>Unless otherwise provided in the rules of</u> <u>procedure of the family court, such review shall</u> <u>be on the record and appellate in nature</u>.

A decision granting a divorce shall be appealable upon entry and, except as otherwise provided by law, the correctness of the decision shall not be reviewable upon an appeal from a final decree for divorce entered in pursuance of &#167; <cross_reference>15-5-23</cross_reference>. Appeals in criminal cases in which the family court exercises jurisdiction over adults, and in paternity cases under chapter 8 of title 15, shall follow the procedure for appeal as provided in chapter 24 of title 9. The provisions of chapter 24 of title 9 and applicable procedural rules relating to the superior court shall apply to the family court in matters appealed from the family court; provided, that on appeal, the supreme court may by rule provide for certain circumstances as it may deem appropriate.</p>\n<p>  (b) Every person aggrieved by any decree, judgment, order, decision, or verdict of the family court relating to modification of alimony or of child support, or a finding of contempt for failure to pay alimony or child support, may, within twenty (20) days after entry of the decree, judgment, order, decision, or verdict, seek review of questions of law in the supreme court by petition for writ of certiorari in accordance with the procedure contained in this chapter. The petition for a writ of certiorari shall set forth errors claimed. Upon the filing of a petition with the clerk of the supreme court, the supreme court may, if it sees fit, issue its writ of certiorari to the family court to certify to the supreme court the record of the proceeding under review, or so much of it as was submitted to the family court by the parties, together with any additional record of the proceeding in the family court.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>While the exact status is unclear, This Court speculates that it is possible that the avenues to appeal may be foreclosed to the remaining Plaintiffs, in at least some instances, by the fact that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 58</span> \nmany of the putative class Plaintiffs are no longer before the Truancy Court, <sup id=\"ref-fn37\"><a href=\"#fn37\">37</a></sup> or any potential appeal may be considered untimely, moot, or waived. To the extent that mootness may be an issue, Rhode Island recognizes a narrow exception to the general rule that the Supreme Court will not decide a question if it would fail to have a practical effect on an actual controversy.<u>Hallsmith-Sysco Food Services, LLC v. Marques</u>,<u><cross_reference>970 A.2d 1211</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1213</cross_reference> (R.I. 2009)</u>. The narrow exception to the mootness doctrine exists for those cases that are `of extreme public importance, which [are] capable of repetition but which [evade] review.' <u>City of Cranston v.

However, with respect to certain legal arguments that involve basic constitutional rights, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has recognized a narrow exception to the raise or waive rule. <u>See State v Bido</u>,<u><cross_reference>941 A.2d 822</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>829</cross_reference>; Pollard v.

In<u>Mireles</u>, <u><cross_reference>502 U.S. at 10-12</cross_reference></u>, the Supreme Court explained the limited circumstances under which judicial immunity can be overcome as follows:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"First, a judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in the judge's judicial capacity. <u>Forrester v.</u> <u>White</u>,  <cross_reference>484 U.S., at 227-229</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>108 S.Ct., at 544-545</cross_reference>;  <u>Stump v.

City of Providence</u>,<u><cross_reference>120 R.I. 619</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>390 A.2d 350</cross_reference> (1978)</u>, that judicial decision-making \"must be engaged in * * * freely, independently, and untrammeled by the possibilities of personal liability.\"<u>Id. at 631, <cross_reference>390 A.2d at 356</cross_reference></u> (citing <u>Suitor v.

In light of the enormous complexity surrounding the question of judicial immunity, this Court has routinely refused to recognize any attempt to weaken the bulwarks of judicial immunity during the \"nearly four hundred years of unbroken adherence to the doctrine.\" <u>See also</u><u>Stiggle v.

While the Court, in <u>Maynard</u>, applied the doctrine of legislative immunity in dismissing a damages action against municipal officials, based upon the officials' attempts to draft, revise, and pass a zoning ordinance, the Court noted with approval, the United States Supreme Court's application of the doctrine of legislative immunity to judicial officers. The Rhode Island Supreme Court expressly noted:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"Thus, for example, the Supreme Court has extended the protection of legislative immunity to <u>members of the judiciary when they act in a</u> <u>legislative capacity</u>. <u>See Supreme Court of</u> <u>Virginia v. Consumer's Union of the</u> <u>United States, Inc.</u>,  <cross_reference>446 U.S. 719</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>100 S.Ct. 1967</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>64 L.Ed.2d 641</cross_reference> (1980).

While the Court claimed to have the inherent authority to regulate and discipline the attorneys, it also had the statutory authority to do so. Likewise, in the State of Rhode Island, the various courts have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 64</span> \nrulemaking authority pursuant to &#167; <cross_reference>8-6-2</cross_reference>. That section provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  \"<strong>&#167; <cross_reference>8-6-2</cross_reference> Rules of practice and</strong> <strong>procedure.</strong> &#8212; (a) The supreme court, the superior court, the family court, and the district court, by a majority of their members, shall have the power to make rules for regulating practice, procedure, and business therein. The chief magistrate of the traffic tribunal shall have the power to make rules for regulating practice, procedure and business in the traffic tribunal. The rules of the superior, family, district court and the traffic tribunal shall be subject to the approval of the supreme court. Such rules, when effective, shall supersede any statutory regulation in conflict therewith.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the express provision of the above section indicating that the rules shall supersede any statutory regulation in conflict therewith, as already discussed herein, a court's rule-making authority may not be used to expand a court's jurisdiction. <u>State v. Robinson et als</u>,<cross_reference>972 A.2d 150</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>158-59</cross_reference> (R.I. 2009). However, a court rule, if promulgated correctly, <sup id=\"ref-fn40\"><a href=\"#fn40\">40</a></sup> it may provide a valid basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Super. R. Civ. P 12(b)(6).) At present, there is no evidence regarding the promulgation of any rule before this Court. That issue is properly the subject of an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p><center>            <u>Cases Involving Attempts to Enjoin Another Court</u></center>\nThe respective parties have cited cases from other jurisdictions involving attempts to enjoin other courts. Defendants have cited a case where one court refused to enjoin another court. In that particular matter, a state district court judge determined there was no equitable subject matter jurisdiction in a &#167; 1983 lawsuit seeking class certification and prospective injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of pretrial release procedures. The decision was upheld as there was no ability to show irreparable harm resulting in no equitable jurisdiction. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 65</span> \nappellate court further indicated that the state defendants were entitled to judicial immunity. <u>Smith v State</u>,<cross_reference>955 P.2d 1293</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1296</cross_reference> (Kan. 1998)</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs cited an action where evaluators, defendants, and attorneys sought federal intervention to enjoin the chief judge of the state judicial circuit from enforcing a local rule requiring driving under the influence (DUI) defendants to have evaluations performed by a particular agency.

The case involved an action where the plaintiff, an unemployment compensation claimant whose claim was denied brought a federal due process and equal protection claim against the state alleging that the 30 day appeal statute running from the date of mailing of the last administrative decision on the claim violated due process. The plaintiff alleged he never received the letter. The Federal Court framed the issue as essentially a story of a wayward letter and whether Plaintiff should be denied his appeal rights because of the circumstance of his not receiving the letter. <u>Id.</u> at 777. After determining that the court had jurisdiction and need not abstain, it went on analyze and dismiss defendants' arguments that the claim was barred by the<cross_reference>Eleventh Amendment</cross_reference>, quasi-judicial immunity, and res judicata grounds. The Federal Court ultimately went on to declare the Ohio 30 day appeal statute unconstitutional because it did not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 66</span> \ncontain a good faith exception for situations when a claimant maintained that a notice or a decision was not delivered.</p>\n<p>Any argument as to the analogy and application of the facts of any of the above cases will be left to the parties after determination of specific facts at an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p><center>                <u>Other Cases Addressing Some of the Issues</u></center>\nWhile not cited by any of the parties, the following cases did address some of the issues raised in the instant matter.

Thus, in order to better determine whether the Superior Court has jurisdiction over this action, this Court must examine what has been delegated by statute to other tribunals. Defendants have argued that the Superior Court cannot enjoin a co-equal court and have suggested that the exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction would \"create a constitutional confrontation between two co-equal state courts.\" (Defendant Administrators' Mem. in Supp. of Their Mot. to Dismiss at 2.) Except for the Rhode Island Supreme Court, the Rhode Island Constitution does not mention \"co-equal\" courts or purport to further stratify any other courts in the state. Article X specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  &#8226; <strong>Section 1.</strong> Power vested in court. &#8212; The judicial power of this state shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the general assembly may, from time to time, ordain and establish.</p>\n<p>  &#8226; <strong>Section 2</strong>. Jurisdiction of supreme and inferior courts &#8212; Quorum of supreme court. &#8212; The supreme court shall have final revisory and appellate jurisdiction upon all questions of law and equity. It shall have power to issue prerogative writs, and shall also have such other jurisdiction as may, from time to time, be prescribed by law. A majority of its judges shall <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 8</span> \nalways be necessary to constitute a quorum. The inferior courts shall have such jurisdiction as may, from time to time, be prescribed by law.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The General Assembly enacted legislation that expounds on the Supreme Court's supervisory jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>8-1-2</cross_reference> Jurisdiction and powers of</strong> <strong>court.</strong> &#8212; The supreme court shall have  <u>general supervision</u> of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein <u>when no other remedy</u> <u>is expressly provided</u>; it may issue writs of habeas corpus, of error, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and all other extraordinary and prerogative writs and processes necessary for the furtherance of justice and the due administration of the law; it may entertain informations in the nature of quo warranto and petitions in equity to determine title to any office; it shall have jurisdiction of petitions for trials and new trials, as provided by law, of bills of exceptions, appeals and certifications to the supreme court, and special cases in which parties having adversary interests concur in stating questions for the opinion of the court as provided by law; and it shall by general or special rules regulate the admission of attorneys to practice in all the courts of the state.\" (emphasis added).</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addressing whether the Superior Court has subject-matter jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief against the Family Court, it is first necessary to examine whether any other remedy is expressly provided to address the Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to the various Court Defendants in either the Supreme Court or the Family Court.</p>\n<p><center>               <strong>Historical Evolution of Rhode Island Courts</strong></center>\nIn 1905, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed sweeping legislation outlining the necessary structure, format, and procedure to be utilized in the judiciary branch. This legislation, entitled the Court and Practice Act (\"CPA\"), included sections covering the various lower courts and their officers (Title I); actions, pleading, practice, and procedure in the courts (Title II); writs, executions, and service thereof (Title III); probate courts (Title IV); estates of deceased <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 9</span> \npersons and those under guardianship (Title V); presentation and proof of claims against estates of deceased persons (Title VI); and fees and costs (Title VII).</p>\n<p>Title I, Chapter 2, of the CPA dealt specifically with the Superior Court. Section 2 (9) of Title 1 provided, in relevant part, that: \"the superior court shall have <em>exclusive original</em><em>jurisdiction</em>, except as otherwise provided by law, of suits and proceedings in equity, and of statutory proceedings following the course of equity, of petitions for divorce, separate maintenance, alimony, and custody of children.\" (Emphasis added.) <u>See also</u><u>Mowry v.

That section, entitled \"Exclusive jurisdiction of equity actions,\" provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  \"The superior court shall, except as otherwise provided by law, have exclusive original jurisdiction of suits and proceedings of an equitable character and of statutory proceedings following the course of equity; provided, however, that every probate court shall have the power, concurrent with the superior court, to replace, remove, or fill any vacancy of any trustee under a trust established under a will, or to effect tax minimization or estate planning under &#167; <cross_reference>33-15-37.1</cross_reference>. If an action is brought in the superior court which represents an attempt in good faith to invoke the jurisdiction conferred by this section, the superior court shall have jurisdiction of all other actions arising out of the same transaction or occurrence, provided the other actions are joined with the action so brought or are subsequently made a part thereof under applicable procedural rules, and the court may retain jurisdiction over the other actions even though the initial action fails for want of equity jurisdiction.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Notwithstanding the enactment of the CPA, treatment of juvenile offenders at the time was still rather harsh. <u>See State v</u><u>Day</u>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2334407\"><a href=\"/opinion/2334407/state-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1048</cross_reference> (R.I. 2006).

As such, Defendants maintain that the Superior Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as previously indicated, Defendants have also suggested that there is potential to \"create a constitutional confrontation between two co-equal state courts.\" (Defendant Administrators' Mem. in Supp. of Their Mot. to Dismiss at 2.)</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' allegations, as set forth above and in the complaint, involve various procedural violations that they claim frequently occurred within the Truancy Courts. Plaintiffs insist that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 16</span> \nthey do not challenge the Truancy Courts' specific determinations of waywardness or delinquency. In fact, Plaintiffs have continually maintained that they do not intend for the Superior Court to become involved in the merits of any Truancy Court matter, and they agree that resolution of any adjudication of waywardness is a matter delegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Family Court. However, Plaintiffs do maintain that notwithstanding the merits of any adjudication on the issue of waywardness, the Superior Court is the proper forum to obtain both declaratory and injunctive relief with regard to requiring the Chief Judge, Court Defendants, and the Family Court to <u>adhere to the applicable state statutes</u><u>that outline the procedural rules that must be followed</u> in any Truancy Court adjudication.

When the case was reached for trial, a state prosecutor from the Attorney General's office, who was present in court, declined to prosecute the case upon learning that Mrs. Cronan was prepared to proceed with her own private attorneys serving as the prosecutors for her complaint. Thereafter, without any objection from defendant, Mrs. Cronan's privately employed counsel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 20</span> \nprosecuted the assault charge against defendant, and the trial justice ultimately found him guilty as charged.<u>Id.</u> at 869.</p>\n<p>After hearing and denying defendant's motions for arrest of judgment and a new trial, defendant pursued an appeal in the Supreme Court. <u>Id.</u> at 870.

The Supreme Court distinguished the federal precedents relied upon by the defendant in comparison to the general jurisdiction of the Superior Court and rejected the defendant's suggestion that the Superior Court, as a court of general jurisdiction, nevertheless lacked the authority and competence to hear and decide the charge in this case because a private complainant-rather than one affiliated with or authorized by the Attorney General-initiated and prosecuted this charge to judgment. <u>Id.</u> at 874. In rejecting the defendant's suggestion, the Supreme Court held the Superior Court possessed the jurisdiction to decide whether the defendant was guilty of the assault charge, even though no attorney from the Attorney General's office prosecuted this case to judgment. The Supreme Court noted that although an attorney from the Attorney General's office deferred to the complainant's private prosecutors when this case was reached for trial in Superior Court, this event did not cause the Superior Court's jurisdiction to lapse.<sup id=\"ref-fn11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup> <u>Id.</u> at 874.

The Supreme Court noted that \"[I]n other contexts we have stressed the unique position of the Attorney General in Rhode Island's constitutional system.

Testimony and other evidence brought out at an evidentiary hearing would shed light on the custom and practices of the Family Court and help to develop the precise limits of this mixed question of law and fact as to whether the Superior Court can order the Family Court Administrator Defendants to ensure<sup id=\"ref-fn28\"><a href=\"#fn28\">28</a></sup>\nthat all Truancy Court proceedings are recorded by stenographic or electronic means. The Judicial Defendants acknowledge the potential for this Court to engage in limited fact finding regarding the issue of subject matter jurisdiction as well. (<u>See</u> Judicial Defs.'

No action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for. The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect; and such declarations shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>While the chapter specifically allows for a declaration in either affirmative or negative form, the section has consistently been interpreted to lack specific authorization for injunctive relief.<u>See Parente v.

In that case, an attorney brought declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that the administrator of Family Court had no authority to issue directive requiring payment of a ten-dollar fee for each divorce petition filed in Family Court. The Superior Court denied the attorney's motion for summary judgment and entered judgment for defendant, and the attorney appealed. The trial justice rested his action on three grounds. They were: (1) his doubt that the administrator had promulgated a rule calling for the payment of the ten-dollar fee; (2) his belief that when the General Assembly in 1971 authorized the increase of certain fees charged in the Superior Court, it actually had in mind fees payable to the Family Court; and (3) his thought that the Superior Court could not review the rules of the Family Court. <u>Id.</u><cross_reference>111 R.I. at 356</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302 A.2d at 302-03</cross_reference>. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 37</span> \nThe Supreme Court reversed holding that the trial justice erred. The trial justice had observed that, since the Superior Court's jurisdiction in the field of domestic relations had been transferred in 1961 to the Family Court, the reference to `in domestic relations' means the Family Court. <cross_reference>111 R.I. at 358</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302 A.2d at 303</cross_reference>. The General Assembly, at the January, 1971 session, enacted P.L. 1971, Ch. <cross_reference>147</cross_reference> into law. Attached to the bill was an explanation of its contents. The explanation, which was prepared by the Legislative Council, states that the bill would increase the fees charged in the Superior and District Courts. The portion of the bill that is relevant to this appeal reads as follows:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  `Section 1. Sections <cross_reference>9-29-18</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>9-29-1</cross_reference> of the general laws in chapter 9-29 entitled `Fees' are hereby amended to read as follows:</p>\n<p>  `9-29-18 Superior Court Fees.-The superior court shall be allowed the following fees in full to be taxed in the bill of costs in every civil action: For the entry of every action, bill or petition at law, in equity, in domestic relations or other civil action. . . . $10.00.'  <u>Id.</u> <cross_reference>111 R.I. at 357</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302 A.2d at 303</cross_reference>.</blockquote></p>\n<p>Ultimately the Supreme Court, construing all relevant statutes, held that the obvious purpose of the amendment was to increase the fees charged in the Superior Court; and the defendant would gain no benefit from other statutes containing a linkage between the Family Court and Superior Court given the precise wording of those statutes. <u>Id.</u> <cross_reference>111 R.I. at 358</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302 A.2d at 303</cross_reference>. The Supreme Court also noted \"The trial justice's reluctance to sit in judgment of the internal business affairs of the Family Court is understandable. However, this is a declaratory judgment action. Jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings is vested solely in the Superior Court.

While the<u>Berberian</u> case dealt only with a declaratory judgment action at a time when such an action was vested solely within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, in this instance, the Superior Court, sitting in equity, being a court of general equity jurisdiction, has the right and duty in the first instance to pass on its own jurisdiction. <u>Poirier v. Quinn</u>,<cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2317863\"><a href=\"/opinion/2317863/poirier-v-quinn/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span></cross_reference> (1955). This Court noted earlier that, in determining whether there is subject matter jurisdiction, it will be necessary to have the Plaintiffs articulate with a high degree of precision exactly what the Plaintiffs would like the Superior Court to do. With regard to the prayer for declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs have prayed that this Court issue such relief against the Defendant Family Court Administrators. This Court will not speculate on all of the nuances related to such relief at this stage in order to avoid having the exact proofs specifically tailored to such speculation at future proceedings on the issue. In conducting this future inquiry, this Court enjoys broad authority to order discovery, consider extrinsic evidence, and hold evidentiary hearings in order to determine its own jurisdiction.<u>See e.g</u>. <u>Valentin v.

As indicated above, the Family Court also has the ability to issue a declaratory judgment (Footnote 26, <u>supra</u>), however, while Rule 57 is contained in the Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations, there is no like provision in the Rules of Juvenile Proceedings. While it remains to be determined on precisely what terms and conditions, and exactly when such conduct occurred, it is important to note that the Rhode Island Supreme Court has issued an opinion regarding ex-parte communication. <u>See Arnold v.</u><u>Lebel</u>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1965193\"><a href=\"/opinion/1965193/arnold-v-lebel/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span></cross_reference> (2007). In the specific context described in<u>Arnold</u>, (disabled adults' applications to Department of Human Services for assistance benefits), the Supreme Court held that G. L. 1956 &#167; <cross_reference>42-35-13</cross_reference> of the Administrative Procedures Act, (APA) prohibited ex-parte communications with anyone about contested or material adjudicatory facts or opinions concerning the merits of an applicant's administrative appeal. <u>Id.</u> at 820. The Court went on to hold that the function of the statutory requirement was to prevent litigious facts from reaching the decision-maker off the record in an administrative hearing. <u>Id.</u> at 820. The Court did, however, indicate that the same statute specifically authorized hearing officers to engage in ex-parte communication with agency staff members about general matters pertaining to the discharge of his or her duties. Such general matters would include private communications concerning procedure or timing. <u>Id.</u> at 821. Finally, the Supreme Court indicated that in accordance with two (2) other specific sections of the APA, <sup id=\"ref-fn30\"><a href=\"#fn30\">30</a></sup> that the hearing officer must provide notice to the parties before a hearing if he or she intends to consult any documentary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 40</span> \nsource or person concerning facts or opinions about the merits of an appeal. In addition, the parties must be afforded an opportunity to contest any such evidence and to cross-examine any people consulted. The Supreme Court noted that this was similar to the regulations followed by many federal agencies. <u>Id.</u> at 821. <u>See also</u><u>Champlin's Realty Associates v.

While noting that engaging in ex-parte contacts alone does not automatically render a decision maker biased, the Supreme Court discussed the obligation of impartiality for any administrative agency carrying out a quasi-judicial function and specifically noted that \"under the<cross_reference>Fourteenth Amendment</cross_reference>, administrative tribunals must not be biased or otherwise indisposed from rendering a fair and impartial decision.\"<u>Id.</u> at 443.

The two sections of law dealing with arraignment procedures provide in relevant part:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-10</cross_reference> Preliminary investigation on</strong> <strong>information furnished to</strong> <strong>court.</strong> &#8212; Except in case of emergency detention, whenever any appropriate person shall give to the court information in his or her possession that a child is within the provisions of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the court to make a preliminary investigation to determine whether the interests of the public or of the child require that further action be taken, and to report its findings together with a statement of the facts to the judge. The inquiry may include a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 41</span> \npreliminary investigation of the home and environmental situation of the child, his or her previous history, and the circumstances which were the subject of the information. <u>To avoid</u> <u>duplication of effort and to take full advantage</u> <u>of all existing facilities, the report of any</u> <u>public agency, or of any private social agency</u> <u>licensed by the department of children, youth,</u> <u>and families, may be accepted by the court as</u> <u>sufficient evidence for the filing of a</u> <u>petition</u>.\" (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>  And,</p>\n<p>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-11</cross_reference> Authorizing and filing</strong> <strong>petition.</strong> &#8212; (a) The <u>filing of the petition</u> <u>constitutes assumption of jurisdiction over the</u> <u>child</u>.

This Court notes that our Supreme Court has held that such investigations serve primarily to shield the child from arbitrary bureaucratic action and also to forestall the Family Court from assuming jurisdiction when such would ill serve the interests of the juvenile and the public.<u>In re Leon</u>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1936840\"><a href=\"/opinion/1936840/in-re-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span></cross_reference> (1980). While preliminary and permanent injunctive relief are not available in the Family Court, <u>In re Stephanie B.</u>, <u>supra</u>, this Court is still concerned with the language of &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-5</cross_reference> providing, in relevant part <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 42</span> \nthat the Family Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings \"(1) <u>Concerning</u> any child residing or being within the state who is: (i) delinquent; [or] (ii) wayward\", (emphasis added), and whether the statutory construction should be undertaken in the Family Court or the Superior Court.</p>\n<p>This Court must also examine the statutory authority of the Defendant Administrators. The statute specifically provides:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>&#167; <cross_reference>8-10-15</cross_reference> Family court</strong> <strong>administrator.</strong> &#8212; (a) There shall be a family court administrator who shall be appointed by the chief judge of the family court in his or her capacity as administrative judge of the court, with the advice and consent of the senate, and who shall hold office for a term of five (5) years.</p>\n<p>  (b) <u>Under the general supervision of the chief</u> <u>judge of the family court, within the policies</u> <u>established by the court</u>, the administrator shall:</p>\n<p>  (1) Prepare an annual budget for the court;</p>\n<p>  (2) Formulate procedures governing the administration of court services;</p>\n<p>  (3) Make recommendations to the court for improvement in court services;</p>\n<p>  (4) Collect necessary statistics and prepare the annual report of the work of the court;</p>\n<p>  (5) Provide supervision and consultation to the staff of the court concerning administration of court services, training and supervision of personnel, and fiscal management;</p>\n<p>  (6) <u>Perform such other duties as the chief</u> <u>judge shall specify</u>;</p>\n<p>  (7) And further to assume and perform, in addition to any other duties provided by this chapter, the powers, authority, and the duties of the family court clerk, pursuant to the provisions of the general laws, and shall do and perform all other things which by law or the rules of the court shall appertain to the office of clerk.\" (emphasis added).</blockquote> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 43</span> </p>\n<p>The above section must be read in conjunction with &#167; <cross_reference>8-10-14</cross_reference> providing for the Administration of the Family Court. The section specifically provides:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>8-10-14</cross_reference> Administration of operation of</strong> <strong>family court.</strong> &#8212; The <u>chief judge</u> of the family court shall be the administrative judge of the court. <u>He or she shall be the head of the</u> <u>court and have supervision and control</u> of the calendars and of the assignment of the justices.  <u>All court stenographers, secretaries, and</u> <u>masters shall be under his or her</u> <u>supervision.</u> It shall be his or her duty to gather such statistics as shall reflect accurately the work of the court, for the information of the court and such other use as he or she may deem expedient. He or she shall also be charged with general responsibility for any recommendations he or she may believe important for the work of the court or any officers in any way connected therewith.\" (emphasis added).</blockquote></p>\n<p>A review of the above sections clearly indicates that the Defendant Administrators are not vested with unfettered discretion. The limits of their discretion are the proper subject of an evidentiary hearing in the context of any motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have also included a prayer for declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against the Defendant Magistrates relative to the arraignment and issuance of court orders against members of the Plaintiff Class over whom personal jurisdiction has not been established. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that such activity is a violation of their Due Process rights under both the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. As set forth above, pursuant to &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-11</cross_reference>, the filing of a petition constitutes assumption of jurisdiction over the child. Section <cross_reference>14-1-16</cross_reference> provides for a summons to issued to at least one parent or guardian if at all possible.</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-16</cross_reference> Summons of child or adult in charge</strong> <strong>of child.</strong> &#8212; Upon the filing of a petition, the justice, if satisfied that there is reasonable cause for the petition, may issue a summons requiring the child to appear before the court at a time and place named in it, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 44</span>  <u>and shall also cause a summons to be issued</u> <u>to at least one of the parents of the child if</u> <u>either of them is known to reside within the</u> <u>state</u>, or if there is no parent, then to the guardian or other lawful custodian of the child, if there is one known to be so resident, and, if not, then to the person with whom the child resides, if known.\" (emphasis added).</blockquote></p>\n<p>The word \"<u>shall</u>\" usually connotes the imperative and contemplates the imposition of a duty. <u>Brown v Amaral</u>,<cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2353430\"><a href=\"/opinion/2353430/brown-v-amaral/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>10</cross_reference> (R.I. 1983). While it appears that a petition would automatically provide for a summons to bring the adult properly before the Family Court, the actual policy of the Truancy Court in this respect is unclear in the context of the complaint. This Court also has the same concern with the language of &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-5</cross_reference> providing, in relevant part, that the Family Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in proceedings \"(1) <u>Concerning</u> any child residing or being within the state who is: (i) delinquent; [or] (ii) wayward\", (emphasis added), and whether the statutory construction should be undertaken in the Family Court or the Superior Court. (discussed above).</p>\n<p>Regardless of which court should undertake the statutory construction, the law regarding a failure to duly serve an individual is fairly clear in this jurisdiction. It is a fundamental principle of procedural due process \"that a court may not issue a judgment or order against a person in the absence of personal jurisdiction.\" <u>In re Stephanie B</u>.,<u><cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1989405\"><a href=\"/opinion/1989405/in-re-stephanie-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>993</cross_reference> (R.I. 2003)</u>. \"When a party is appropriately before the Court, having been properly served with process, and has entered an appearance or appeared specially to contest jurisdiction, the court is vested with jurisdiction. . .\" <u>Id</u>. <u>See also</u><u>Guertin v.

(\"Because Mrs. Sticca-Guertin was not named as a party, was not served with process, and did not waive service of the summons and complaint, she cannot be a party, and the Family Court had no jurisdiction over her. Consequently, the injunction entered against her is void.\"). Even <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 45</span> \nthough Mrs. Guertin<sup id=\"ref-fn32\"><a href=\"#fn32\">32</a></sup> testified during the trial, her presence did not cure the due process deficiency, constitute an entry of appearance, or transform her into a party. <u>Id.</u> at 1020.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Family Court has the statutory authority to order a disposition of any child. Section <cross_reference>14-1-32</cross_reference> provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-32</cross_reference> Power of court to order disposition</strong> <strong>of child.</strong> &#8212; If the court finds that a child is delinquent, wayward, neglected, dependent, or otherwise within the provisions of this chapter, it may by order duly entered proceed as follows: . . .</p>\n<p>  (1) . . . the court may order that appropriate monetary restitution be made immediately to the owner of the damaged property by the child, his or her parent, parents . . .</p>\n<p>  (3) . . . The court may order the parent or parents of the child to undertake a program of counseling, which program shall be designed to attempt to remedy those conditions which led to the child's coming before the court.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>The statute contemplates action against the parent or parents. The issue is one of service.</p>\n<p>This Court declines to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction without an evidentiary hearing on the issues discussed in this section, specifically, failure to investigate a petition and make the requisite determinations by the intake department, and arraignment and issuance of orders against members of the putative class without first acquiring jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p><center>                <u>Interpreters, information at arraignment,</u> <u>counsel, due process, and waivers</u></center>\nLanguage interpreters have been required to assist those who are unable to readily understand and communicate in the English language, and who are involved in legal proceedings in criminal matters before the Superior Court, District Court, or in juvenile matters in the Family Court since 1999.

Plaintiffs also argue that by permitting children members of the Plaintiff Class to waive their right to counsel without first consulting with counsel (Complaint paragraph 285), Defendant Court Administrators and Magistrates have again violated their Due Process rights. In their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs have requested only declaratory relief against the Defendant Magistrates. (Complaint paragraphs 309, 310, 311). They have not sought relief on those Counts against the Defendant Administrators, nor have they sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>The right to counsel is specifically addressed in Chapter 14-1 dealing with delinquent and dependent children. Section <cross_reference>14-1-32</cross_reference> provides:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  <strong>\"&#167; <cross_reference>14-1-31</cross_reference> Services of</strong> <strong>public defender.</strong> &#8212; Prior to the commencement of <u>any hearing</u>, the justice shall advise the parent or guardian of any child, or the adult involved, as the case may be, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 47</span> \nthat if he or she is financially unable to engage counsel, he or she is entitled to the services of the public defender. The public defender shall, at the request of a justice of the family court, appear in court on behalf of that person.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have prayed for a declaratory judgment only against Defendant Magistrates relative to permitting child members of the Plaintiff class to waive their right to counsel without first consulting with counsel, claiming that was a violation of Plaintiffs Due Process rights as well as those secured under &#167; <cross_reference>14-1-31</cross_reference> While Defendants have argued that the violation was only a civil violation, the United States Supreme Court has held that there is no material difference, with respect to right to counsel, between adult and juvenile proceedings in which adjudication of delinquency is sought. They further held that a proceeding wherein the issue is whether a child will be found to be delinquent and subjected to loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to felony prosecution. <u>In re</u><u>Gault</u>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107439\"><a href=\"/opinion/107439/in-re-gault/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>36</cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107439\"><a href=\"/opinion/107439/in-re-gault/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Furthermore, a juvenile charged with delinquency and his parents had an express right to be advised that they might retain counsel and to be confronted with need for specific consideration of whether they did or did not choose to waive that right, and, if they were unable to afford to employ counsel, they were entitled, in view of seriousness of charge and potential commitment, to appointed counsel unless they chose to waive the right. <u>Id.</u><cross_reference>387 U.S. at 41</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>87 S.Ct. at 1451</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>In this jurisdiction, the Rhode Island Supreme Court recognized the importance of the right and held that a juvenile who was found wayward for committing an assault on a teacher was entitled to counsel and applied the law set forth in <u>Gault</u>.<u>Gonsalves v.

District Court</u>, 459 P.2d at 867. As one commentator has explained,</p>\n<p>  `It is not true that a court, having obtained jurisdiction of the subject-matter of a suit and of parties before it, thereby excludes all other courts from the right to adjudicate upon other matters having a very close connection with those before the first court, and in some instances requiring the decision of exactly the same questions. In examining into the exclusive character of the jurisdiction of such cases, regard must be had to the nature of the remedies, the character of the relief sought, and the identity of the parties in the different suits.' 1 Bailey, [\"The Law of Jurisdiction\" 62 (1899)],  <u>supra</u> at 62.\"</blockquote></p>\n<p>This Court does not read Plaintiffs' Complaint, at this stage, as challenging a specific ruling. The relief prayed for including declaratory judgments and instances of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief all appear to involve endeavors by the Plaintiffs to require the Family Court and Truancy Court to adhere strictly to its statutory procedures, as well as those procedures that have been developed under well recognized case law. The Rhode Island Supreme Court, as recently as 2007, characterized comity as \"a largely discretionary and somewhat amorphous concept\" in the context of an opinion relative to the availability of a divorce action within the Family Court to dissolve a gay marriage between two partners who had married in another state. <u>See Chambers v. Ormiston</u>,<cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436510\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436510/chambers-v-ormiston/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>965</cross_reference> (R.I. 2007). The Court further indicated that considerations of comity do not come into play if the court lacks jurisdiction over the case before it. <u>Id.</u></p>\n<p>The Rhode Island Supreme Court has also considered judicial economy along with comity in holding that the Superior Court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction on a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 55</span> \nparticular matter until the Bankruptcy Court either had abstained, refused to reopen, or otherwise declined to pass on the merits of the parties' dispute, or adjudicated the effect of the prior owner's default under the plan on the city's tax lien. <u>See Nationwide</u><u>Life Ins. Co. v. Annarino</u>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>203</cross_reference> (R.I. 1999). Defendants have also cited a Superior Court bench decision in<u>McKenna v. Healey et al</u>, PC/2009-4179. The bench decision, declining to exercise jurisdiction relative to a Workers Compensation Court issue on principles of comity, notes that there are \"alternative avenues of appeal\" (Tr., p. 85, ll. 12-14), and noting that \"It would be inappropriate to issue injunctive relief, particularly where there is an adequate remedy elsewhere.\" (Tr., p. 94, ll. 8-10). In 1966, the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that a taxpayer which failed to avail itself of statutory remedies including administrative review of the correctness of a use tax assessment and for judicial review of action of administrator with respect thereto was precluded from challenging tax as invalidly assessed for administrator's alleged failure to comply with the statutes, or challenging procedural provisions as depriving it of property without due process of law. <u>See Langton v.

The defendant asserts that in the District Court his trial attorney withdrew his previously filed waiver of his right to a jury trial and that he did so outside his presence and without his permission or knowledge. The record, however, is inadequate to determine what defendant knew, allowed, or agreed to in connection with the removal of this case from the District Court to Superior Court, except to indicate that his attorney deliberately accomplished this removal and that defendant and his attorney allowed the Superior Court trial to proceed to a verdict there without raising any objection to the procedure that removed the case to the Superior Court in this manner.</footnote_body></p>\n<p><footnote_body><sup id=\"fn11\"><a href=\"#ref-fn11\">11</a></sup> At this point in the <u>Cronan</u> opinion, the Supreme Court inserted a footnote revealing that the Attorney General, as an<em>amicus curiae</em> to the defendant's appeal, urged the Supreme Court to conclude that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to hear this case because no prosecutor from the Attorney General's office or other authorized attorney prosecuted this case to judgment.</footnote_body></p>\n<p><footnote_body><sup id=\"fn12\"><a href=\"#ref-fn12\">12</a></sup> <strong>&#167; <cross_reference>9-24-25</cross_reference> Certification to supreme court on agreed</strong><strong>statement of facts.</strong> &#8212; Whenever any civil action, legal or equitable in character, is pending in a district court or in a superior court, and the parties shall file in the clerk's office an agreed statement of facts in the action, the court shall certify the action to the supreme court to be there heard and determined.
