Lanier Anderson recused himself and did not participate\nin this decision.\n**Senior Judge Phyllis A. Kravitch, who was a member of the en\nbanc court which heard oral argument in this case, took senior\nstatus on January 1, 1997, and has elected to participate in this\ndecision pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(c).\n\fTJOFLAT, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n\n     Appellant, Aurelia Davis, brought this suit against the\n\nBoard of Education of Monroe County, Georgia, (the \"Board\") and\n\ntwo school officials, Charles Dumas and Bill Querry, on behalf of\n\nher daughter, LaShonda Davis.     The complaint alleged that the\n\ndefendants violated Section 901 of the Education Amendments of\n\n1972, Pub. L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, 373 (1972) (codified as\n\namended at 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994)) (\"Title IX\"), and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 19831 by failing to prevent a student at Hubbard Elementary\n\nSchool (\"Hubbard\") from sexually harassing LaShonda while she was\n\na student there.   Appellant separately alleged that the\n\ndefendants discriminated against LaShonda on the basis of race in\n\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981.2    Appellant sought injunctive\n\n     1\n          This section provides, \"Every person who, under color\nof any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any\nState . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . person\n. . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the\nparty injured . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994).\n     2\n          Davis actually alleged that the named defendants\ndiscriminated on the basis of race in violation of \"the Education\nAct of 1972 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\" Davis was\napparently referring to the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub. L.\nNo. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235 (1972), and the Civil Rights Act of\n1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (1991). The former\nact, however, does not address racial discrimination in\neducation, and the latter act does not provide a cause of action\nfor racial discrimination in education. The district court\nconstrued this portion of the complaint to allege a violation of\n42 U.S.C. § 1981, which does provide a cause of action against\ncertain types of racial discrimination.\n\n                                   2\n\frelief and $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n     The district court dismissed appellant's complaint in its\n\nentirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted.    See Aurelia D. v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 862 F.\n\nSupp. 363, 368 (M.D. Ga. 1994); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).   Appellant appealed the district court's dismissal of\n\nher Title IX claim against the Board,3 arguing that a school\n\nboard can be held liable under Title IX for its failure to\n\n\n\n     3\n          Davis did not appeal the district court's dismissal of\nher Title IX claim with regard to individual defendants Dumas and\nQuerry. Davis similarly did not appeal the district court's\ndismissal of her § 1981 claim. Therefore, we do not consider\nthese claims.\n\n     With regard to Davis' § 1983 claim, the complaint seemed to\nallege that the defendants were liable under this provision\nsolely because they violated Title IX. Davis, however,\napparently argued before the district court that the defendants\nwere liable under § 1983 for infringing LaShonda's rights under\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. The district court dismissed this implied\nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6). See Aurelia D., 862 F. Supp. at 366.\n\n     Davis did not appeal the dismissal of her § 1983 claim to\nthe extent it was based on the defendants' alleged violation of\nTitle IX. Accordingly, that claim is not before us. She did,\nhowever, appeal the dismissal of her § 1983 claim to the extent\nit was based on the defendants' alleged violation of the Due\nProcess Clause. In addition, Davis argued for the first time\nbefore the three-judge panel that the same § 1983 claim\nencompassed a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n     The panel rejected Davis' due-process and equal-protection\narguments and affirmed the dismissal of her steadily expanding §\n1983 claim under 11th Cir. R. 36-1. See Davis v. Monroe County\nBd. of Educ., 74 F.3d 1186, 1188 (1996). Davis did not petition\nthe court to rehear this ruling en banc, and we see no reason to\ndisturb the panel's decision sua sponte. We therefore do not\nconsider Davis' various § 1983 claims. In sum, we address only\nDavis' Title IX claim against the Board.\n\n                                  3\n\fprevent sexual harassment among students.    On appeal, a divided\n\nthree-judge panel reinstated her Title IX claim against the\n\nBoard.   See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 74 F.3d 1186,\n1195 (11th Cir. 1996).   At the Board's request, we granted\n\nrehearing en banc to consider appellant's Title IX claim,4 and we\n\nnow affirm the district court's dismissal of this claim.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n\n\n                                  A.\n\n\n\n     We review de novo the district court's dismissal of\n\nappellant's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief can be granted.   See McKusick v. City of Melbourne, 96\n\nF.3d 478, 482 (11th Cir. 1996).    To this end, we take as true the\n\nallegations appellant has set forth in her complaint and examine\n\nwhether those allegations describe an injury for which the law\n\nprovides relief.   See Welch v. Laney, 57 F.3d 1004, 1008 (11th\n\nCir. 1995).   We construe appellant's allegations liberally\n\nbecause the issue is not whether appellant will ultimately\n\nprevail but whether she is entitled to offer evidence to support\n\nher claims.   Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct.\n1683, 1686, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974).    We begin by describing the\n\n\n\n     4\n          See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 91 F.3d 1418\n(11th Cir. 1996). Granting rehearing en banc vacated the panel\nopinion by operation of law. 11th Cir. R. 35-11.\n\n                                  4\n\fallegations contained in appellant's complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n\n\n     LaShonda Davis was enrolled as a fifth-grade student at\n\nHubbard during the 1992-1993 school year.   During that school\n\nyear, Bill Querry was the principal of Hubbard, and Diane Fort,\n\nJoyce Pippin, and Whit Maples were teachers at the school.    The\n\ncomplaint alleges that the Board administered federally funded\n\neducational programs at Hubbard and supervised the school's\n\nemployees, including Principal Querry and Teachers Fort, Pippin,\n\nand Maples.\n\n     According to the complaint, a fifth-grade student named\n\n\"G.F.\" was in several of LaShonda's classes and initially was\n\nassigned to the seat next to LaShonda in Fort's classroom.    On\n\nDecember 17, 1992, while in Fort's classroom, G.F. allegedly\n\ntried to touch LaShonda's breasts and vaginal area.   G.F. also\n\nallegedly directed vulgarities at LaShonda, such as \"I want to\n\nget in bed with you\" and \"I want to feel your boobs.\"   LaShonda\n\ncomplained to Fort.   After school that day, LaShonda also told\n\nher mother, the appellant, about G.F.'s behavior.   The complaint\n\nstates that G.F. engaged in similar (although unspecified)\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fconduct on or about January 4, 1993,5 and again on January 20,\n\n1993.    LaShonda allegedly reported both incidents to Fort and to\n\nappellant.    After one of these first three incidents, appellant\n\ncalled Fort, who told appellant in the course of their\n\nconversation that Principal Querry knew about one of the\n\nincidents.\n\n     G.F.'s misconduct continued.     On February 3, 1993, G.F.\n\nallegedly placed a door-stop in his pants and behaved in a\n\nsexually suggestive manner toward LaShonda during their physical\n\neducation class.    LaShonda reported this incident to Maples, who\n\nwas the physical education teacher.     On February 10, 1993, G.F.\n\nengaged in unspecified conduct similar to that of the December 17\n\nincident in the classroom of Pippin, another of LaShonda's\n\nteachers.    LaShonda notified Pippin of G.F.'s behavior and later\n\ntold appellant, who then called Pippin to discuss the incident.\n\nOn March 1, 1993, G.F. directed more unspecified, offensive\n\nconduct toward LaShonda during physical education class.\n\nLaShonda reported G.F. to Maples and Pippin.     An unidentified\n\nteacher allegedly told LaShonda that Principal Querry was not\n\nready to listen to her complaint about G.F.\n\n     At some point around March 17, 1993, Fort allowed LaShonda\n\n\n     5\n          The complaint actually alleges that this second\ninstance of harassment occurred \"on or about January 2, 1993.\"\nWe note that January 2, 1993 was a Saturday. Presumably, there\nwas no school on Saturday, so G.F. could not have sexually\nharassed LaShonda at Hubbard on that day. Friday, January 1,\n1993, was a holiday. Accordingly, we assume for appellant's\nbenefit that the alleged harassment occurred on or about January\n4, 1993.\n\n                                  6\n\fto change assigned seats away from G.F.    G.F., however, persisted\n\nin his unwelcome attentions.    On April 12, 1993, he rubbed his\n\nbody against LaShonda in a manner she considered sexually\n\nsuggestive; this incident occurred in the hallway on the way to\n\nlunch.   LaShonda again complained to Fort.\n\n     Lastly, on May 19, 1993, LaShonda complained to appellant\n\nafter school about more unspecified behavior by G.F.    Appellant\n\nand LaShonda then paid a visit to Principal Querry to discuss\n\nG.F.'s conduct.    At this meeting, Querry asked LaShonda why no\n\nother students had complained about G.F.    During this meeting,\n\nQuerry also told appellant, \"I guess I'll have to threaten [G.F.]\n\na little bit harder.\"    On the same day, May 19, G.F. was charged\n\nwith sexual battery, a charge which he apparently did not deny.\n\nThe complaint does not tell us who summoned the police.\n\n     In all, the complaint describes eight separate instances of\n\nsexual harassment by G.F.    These eight instances of alleged\n\nharassment occurred, on average, once every twenty-two days over\n\na six-month period.    Three instances occurred in Fort's\n\nclassroom; two occurred in Maples' physical education class; one\n\noccurred in Pippin's classroom; one occurred in a school hallway;\n\nand one occurred in an unspecified location.    LaShonda reported\n\nfour instances of alleged harassment to Fort, two to Maples, and\n\ntwo to Pippin.    LaShonda reported the final instance of\n\nharassment, the May 19 incident, to appellant and Querry.    The\n\ncomplaint does not allege that any faculty member knew of more\nthan four instances of harassment, and the complaint indicates\n\n\n                                  7\n\fthat Principal Querry learned of only one instance of harassment\n\nbefore his meeting with appellant and LaShonda on May 19.\n\n       The complaint does not state what action each of the\n\nteachers took upon being informed by LaShonda of G.F.'s demeaning\n\nconduct.    We assume for appellant's benefit that the teachers\n\ntook no action other than Fort's apparent notification of\n\nPrincipal Querry after one of the first three instances of\n\nalleged harassment and Fort's decision around March 17, 1993, to\n\nmove LaShonda's assigned seat away from that of G.F.    We will\n\nalso accept as true that Principal Querry took no measures\n\nagainst G.F. other than threatening him with disciplinary action\n\nat some point before his May 19 meeting with appellant and her\n\ndaughter.    For example, we assume for appellant's benefit that\n\nsomeone other than the school staff instigated the prosecution of\n\nG.F.\n\n       Appellant claims that LaShonda suffered mental anguish\n\nbecause of G.F.'s behavior.    As indicia of this emotional trauma,\n\nthe complaint states that LaShonda's grades dropped during the\n\n1992-1993 school year and that LaShonda wrote a suicide note in\n\nApril 1993.    Based on the above allegations, appellant contends\n\nthat \"[t]he deliberate indifference by Defendants to the\n\nunwelcomed [sic] sexual advances of a student upon LaShonda\n\ncreated an intimidating, hostile, offensive and abuse [sic]\n\nschool environment in violation of Title IX.\"    We therefore\n\nconsider whether Title IX allows a claim against a school board\nbased on a school official's failure to remedy a known hostile\n\n\n                                  8\n\fenvironment6 caused by the sexual harassment of one student by\n\nanother (\"student-student sexual harassment\").\n\n\n\n                                II.\n\n\n\n     Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States\n\nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be\n\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\n\nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial\n\nassistance.\"   20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994).   Although nothing in the\n\nplain language of Title IX speaks to the issue of student-student\n\nsexual harassment, several district courts have held that Title\n\nIX allows a student to sue a school board for failing to prevent\n\nhostile-environment sexual harassment by another student.   See\n\nDoe v. Londonderry Sch. Dist., No. 95-469-JD, http://lw.bna.com/\n\n#0708 (D. N.H. June 13, 1997); Nicole M. v. Martinez Unified Sch.\n\nDist., No. C-93-4531 MHP, 1997 WL 193919, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Apr.\n\n\n     6\n          The term \"hostile environment\" sexual harassment\noriginated in employment litigation under § 703 of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 255 (1964)\n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (1994)) (\"Title VII\"). Hostile-\nenvironment sexual harassment occurs whenever an employee's\nspeech or conduct creates an atmosphere that is sufficiently\nsevere or pervasive to alter another employee's working\nconditions. See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17,\n21 - 22, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370 - 71, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993). As\ndiscussed infra, n.13, we conclude that Title VII standards of\nliability, borrowed from the employment context, do not control\nour resolution of this case. Nevertheless, for purposes of our\ndiscussion of appellant's claim, we construe the complaint to\nallege that G.F.'s speech or conduct created an atmosphere that\nwas sufficiently hostile or abusive to alter the conditions of\nLaShonda's learning environment.\n\n                                 9\n\f15, 1997); Collier v.

Cal. 1993).   But see Garza\n\nv. Galena Park Indep. Sch. Dist., 914 F. Supp. 1437, 1438 (S.D.\n\nTex. 1994) (\"[A] student cannot bring a hostile environment claim\n\nunder Title IX.\").\n\n     The courts of appeals, however, have been less enthusiastic.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit has held that no cause of action exists where a\n\nschool board merely knew or should have known of peer sexual\n\nharassment and failed to act.   See Rowinsky v. Bryan Indep. Sch.\nDist., 80 F.3d 1006, 1016 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ---,\n\n117 S. Ct. 165, 136 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1996).   Other circuits have\n\nresolved complaints of student-student sexual harassment without\n\ndeciding whether a cause of action exists under Title IX for this\n\nalleged harm.   See, e.g., Seamons v. Snow, 84 F.3d 1226, 1232 -\n\n33 (10th Cir. 1996) (holding that the plaintiff failed to state a\n\nvalid claim for student-student sexual harassment because he\n\n\n                                10\n\ffailed to allege that the harassment in question was on account\n\nof his sex); Murray v. New York Univ. College of Dentistry, 57\n\nF.3d 243, 250 (2nd Cir. 1995) (holding that, even if Title IX\n\ncreated a private cause of action for sexual harassment by a non-\n\nemployee of the school, plaintiff failed to allege that school\n\nofficials knew or should have known of the harassment); Doe v.\n\nPetaluma City Sch. Dist., 54 F.3d 1447, 1452 (9th Cir. 1994)\n\n(holding that a defendant school counselor was entitled to\n\nqualified immunity against a claim that he failed to respond to\n\nknown sexual harassment of the plaintiff by other students).\n\n     The Supreme Court has not squarely addressed the issue of\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment.   In general, the Court has\n\nallowed private plaintiffs to proceed under Title IX only in\n\ncases that allege intentional gender discrimination by the\n\nadministrators of educational institutions.   According to the\n\nCourt, plaintiffs can state a claim under Title IX by alleging\n\nthat a federally funded educational institution, acting through\n\nits employees, intentionally subjected them to discrimination in\n\nits educational programs or activities.   See Cannon v. University\n\nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 709, 99 S. Ct. 1946, 1964, 60 L. Ed. 2d\n\n560 (1979).   For example, where a teacher engaged a student in\n\nsexually oriented conversations, solicited dates from her,\n\nforcibly kissed her on the mouth, and thrice removed her from\n\nanother class in order to engage in coercive sexual intercourse\n\nwith her in a private office at the school, the Court found that\n\nthe school board could be held liable for his actions.   See\n\n\n                                11\n\fFranklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 63 - 64, 76,\n\n112 S. Ct. 1028, 1031, 1038, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1992).\n\n     Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever found,\n\nhowever, that a school board can be held liable for failing to\n\nprevent non-employees from discriminating against students on the\n\nbasis of sex.   Appellant does not allege that any employee of the\n\nBoard intentionally discriminated against LaShonda by personally\n\nparticipating in G.F.'s offensive conduct toward her.    Rather,\n\nappellant alleges that the Board violated Title IX by failing\n\nadequately to respond to LaShonda's complaints.    Neither the\n\nSupreme Court nor this court has considered whether a Title IX\n\nplaintiff can proceed under this theory.    In short, by seeking\n\ndirect liability of the Board for the wrongdoing of a student,\n\nappellant argues for an extension of liability under Title IX.\n\nWe examine the legislative history of Title IX to determine\n\nwhether Congress intended this provision to reach appellant's\n\nallegations.\n\n\n\n                                A.\n\n\n\n     The provision now known as Title IX emerged from a flurry of\n\nbills regarding public education.    In June and July 1970, the\n\nHouse Subcommittee on Education of the House Committee on\n\nEducation and Labor, under the leadership of Representative Edith\n\nGreen, held hearings on gender discrimination in federally funded\n\neducational programs.   See Discrimination Against Women: Hearings\n\n\n                                12\n\fon Section 805 of H.R. 16098 Before the Special Subcomm. on\n\nEducation of the House Comm. on Education and Labor, 91st Cong.,\n\n2d Sess. (1970) [hereinafter House Hearings].     None of the\n\ntestimony before Representative Green's subcommittee concerned\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment or related issues, such as\n\nschool discipline.   Instead, the subcommittee's work focused on\n\neliminating gender discrimination in school admissions and in the\n\nemployment decisions of school administrators.\n\n     By 1970, section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already\n\nprohibited gender discrimination in employment.    See Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, § 703, 78 Stat. 241, 255 (1964)\n\n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (1994)) (\"Title VII\").7     Title\n\nVII, however, did not apply to educational institutions.        See §\n\n702, 78 Stat. at 255 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1\n\n(1994)).   Similarly, section 601 of the Civil Rights Act\n\nprohibited racial discrimination by all recipients of federal\n\nfunding.   See § 601, 78 Stat. at 252 (codified at 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000d (1994)) (\"Title VI\").8   Title VI did not ban gender\n\ndiscrimination by recipients of federal funding.\n\n\n     7\n          Title VII states, \"It shall be an unlawful employment\npractice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions,\nor privileges of employment, because of such individual's . . .\nsex.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (1994).\n     8\n          Title VI provides that \"[n]o person in the United\nStates shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin,\nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or\nbe subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000d\n(1994).\n\n                                13\n\f      To fill this gap in antidiscrimination legislation, the\n\nsubcommittee drafted a proposed amendment to H.R. 16098, 91st\n\nCong. (1970).     This amendment would have applied to schools the\n\nnon-discrimination requirements of Title VII and added \"sex\" to\n\nthe types of discrimination banned by Title VI.       See House\n\nHearings, supra, at 1.     In other words, the subcommittee's\n\namendment was designed to bridge the gap between Title VII and\n\nTitle VI.     The amendment, however, never reached the House floor.\n\nSee North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 523 n.13, 102\n\nS. Ct. 1912, 1919, n.13, 72 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1982).\n\n      On April 6, 1971, a new education bill was introduced in the\n\nHouse.    See H.R. 7248, 92nd Cong. (1971).   This bill contained a\n\nprovision similar to the amendment proposed by Representative\n\nGreen's subcommittee nearly one year earlier.     Title X of H.R.\n\n7248 prohibited gender discrimination in any education program or\n\nactivity receiving federal financial support.        H.R. Rep. No. 92-\n\n554, at 108 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2462, 2511 -\n\n12.      The House report on H.R. 7248 described this provision as a\nresponse to discriminatory admissions policies and employment\n\npractices at federally funded schools.     See id.    Once again,\n\nneither the House report nor the underlying testimony discussed\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment.\n\n      While the House bill remained in committee, the Senate was\n\nconsidering a similar education bill.    See S. 659, 92nd Cong.\n\n(1971).     The Senate bill emerged from the Senate Committee on\n\nLabor and Public Welfare on August 3, 1971, without any\n\n                                  14\n\fantidiscrimination provision at all.      Consequently, on August 5,\n\n1971, Senator Birch Bayh introduced on the Senate floor an\n\namendment to the committee's version of S. 659.      See 117 Cong.\n\nRec. 30,156. (1971).   His amendment, like the House provision\n\ndrafted by Representative Green's subcommittee, extended the\n\nantidiscrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to\n\ngender discrimination by federally funded \"institutions of higher\n\nlearning.\"9   See id. at 30,155.    In defending his amendment,\n\nSenator Bayh did not discuss student-student sexual harassment,\n\nnor did he discuss school discipline.      He focused on gender\n\ndiscrimination in school admissions and employment opportunities\n\nfor female teachers.   See id. at 30,155 - 56.     In any event, the\n\nSenate rejected Bayh's amendment as non-germane, id. at 30,415,\n\nand the Senate passed S. 659 on August 6, 1971, without an\n\nantidiscrimination provision.\n\n     On November 3, 1971, the House began consideration of S.\n\n659, as passed by the Senate.      The House \"amended\" the Senate\n\nbill by striking virtually the entire contents of S. 659 and\n\nreplacing it with the contents of H.R. 7248, including the\n\nantidiscrimination provision.      See S. Rep. No. 92-604, at 1\n\n(1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2595, 2595.      The House\n\n\n\n     9\n          Senator Bayh's first amendment provided, \"No person . .\n. shall, on the ground of sex, . . . be subject to discrimination\nunder any program or activity conducted by a public institution\nof higher education, or any school or department of graduate\neducation, which is a recipient of Federal financial assistance\nfor any education program or activity.\" 117 Cong. Rec. at\n30,156.\n                                   15\n\fmade this change without official comment and passed its version\n\nof S. 659 on November 4, 1971.     See 117 Cong. Rec. at 30,882.\n\n     On November 24, 1971, the Senate, by unanimous consent,\n\nreferred the House version of S. 659 back to the Committee on\n\nLabor and Public Welfare, which proceeded to amend the House\n\nversion to conform to the original Senate version.     See S. Rep.\n\nNo. 92-604, at 1 - 2 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2595,\n\n2595 - 96.     Once again, the committee did not discuss gender\n\ndiscrimination at all, much less sexual harassment among\n\nstudents.    On February 7, 1972, the Senate committee sent its own\n\nversion of S. 659 back to the floor of the Senate.     See 118 Cong.\n\nRec. 2806 (1972).\n\n     Once the bill returned to the Senate floor, Senator Bayh\n\nagain introduced an amendment to add an antidiscrimination\n\nprovision.10    See id. at 5802 - 03.   Bayh's proposal was intended\n\nto \"close[] loopholes in existing legislation relating to general\n\neducation programs and employment resulting from those programs.\"\n\nId. at 5803.     In support of his amendment, Senator Bayh stated,\n     we are dealing with three basically different types of\n\n     discrimination here[:] . . . discrimination in\n\n     admission to an institution, discrimination of [sic]\n\n     available services or studies within an institution\n\n     once students are admitted, and discrimination in\n\n\n     10\n          Senator Bayh's second amendment stated, \"No person . .\n. shall, on the basis of sex, . . . be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance . . . .\" 118 Cong. Rec. at 5803.\n\n                                  16\n\f     employment within an institution, as a member of the\n\n     faculty or whatever.\n\nId. at 5812.    To counter these problems, Senator Bayh proposed a\n\nprovision he thought would \"cover such crucial aspects as\n\nadmissions procedures, scholarships, and faculty employment, with\n\nlimited exceptions.\"    Id. at 5803.   Yet again, no senator\n\nmentioned student-student sexual harassment or school discipline.\n\n     The Senate adopted Bayh's second amendment on February 28,\n\n1972.   See 118 Cong. Rec. at 5815 (1972).    Because of\n\nirreconcilable differences between the House and Senate versions\n\nof S. 659, both Houses referred the bill to a conference\n\ncommittee.     See S. Conf. Rept. No. 92-798, at 1 (1972).     The\n\nconference committee reported out a joint bill containing the\n\nantidiscrimination measure now known as Title IX.    The committee,\n\nhowever, did not explain its reasons for including Title IX.         The\n\nconference bill passed both Houses and was signed into law on\n\nJune 23, 1972.    See 118 Cong. Rec. at 22,702.   Throughout this\n\nlong legislative history, the drafters of Title IX never\n\ndiscussed student-student sexual harassment or the related issue\n\nof school discipline.\n\n\n\n                                  B.\n\n\n\n     While the legislative history of Title IX does not indicate\n\nthat Congress authorized a private cause of action for student-\n\nstudent sexual harassment, the legislative history does show that\n\n                                  17\n\fTitle IX was enacted under the Spending Clause of Article I.     See\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.11     When Congress conditions the\n\nreceipt of federal funding upon a recipient's compliance with\n\nfederal statutory directives, Congress is acting pursuant to its\n\nspending power.   See Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463\n\nU.S. 582, 598 - 99, 103 S. Ct. 3221, 3230 - 31, 77 L. Ed. 2d 866\n\n(1983) (opinion of White, J.).   The legislative history of Title\n\nIX indicates that Congress intended to impose upon recipients of\n\nfederal educational assistance a requirement of non-\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.     The Spending Clause\n\nauthorized Congress to impose this condition.\n\n     Representative Green put it succinctly:     \"If we are writing\n\nthe law, I would say that any institution could be all men or all\n\nwomen, but my own feeling is that they do it with their own funds\n\nand not taxpayers' funds.\"   Higher Education Amendments of 1971:\nHearings on H.R. 32, H.R. 5191, H.R. 5192, H.R. 5193, and H.R.\n\n7248 Before the Special Subcomm. on Education of the House Comm.\n\non Education and Labor, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 581 (1971).\nRepresentative Green also quoted with approval President Nixon,\n\nwho had stated, \"Neither the President nor the Congress nor the\n\nconscience of the Nation can permit money which comes from all\n\nthe people to be used in a way which discriminates against some\n\nof the people.\"   117 Cong. Rec. at 39,257 (1971) (statement of\n\n\n     11\n          Section 8 of Article I provides, in part, that \"[t]he\nCongress shall have [the] Power To . . . provide for the . . .\ngeneral Welfare of the United States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8,\ncl. 1.\n\n                                 18\n\fRep. Green).   To Senator Bayh, the reach of Title IX was clearly\n\nrestricted to federally funded institutions.   See 118 Cong. Rec.\n\nat 5812.   In support of Title IX, Senator McGovern stated, \"I\n\nurge my colleagues to take every opportunity to prohibit Federal\n\nfunding of sex discrimination.\"    117 Cong. Rec. at 30,158.   This\n\nlegislative history clearly shows that Congress intended Title IX\n\nto be a \"typical 'contractual' spending-power provision.\"12\n\nGuardians Ass'n, 463 U.S. at 599, 103 S. Ct. at 3231.\n\n     In addition to these indications of congressional intent,\n\nsimilarities between Title IX and Title VI indicate that Title IX\n\nwas enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause.   As noted above,\n\nTitle VI prohibits recipients of federal funding from engaging in\n\nrace discrimination.   In Guardians Association v. Civil Service\n\n\n\n     12\n          The Supreme Court has left open the question of whether\nTitle IX was enacted under the Spending Clause. See Franklin,\n503 U.S. at 75 n.8, 112 S. Ct. at 1038 n.8. One could argue, as\ndid the petitioner in Franklin, that Title IX was enacted under §\n5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides Congress with the\nauthority to enact legislation preventing states from \"deny[ing]\nto any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV, § 1, cl. 4.\n\n     The Equal Protection Clause, however, only protects against\naction by state-sponsored entities. See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334\nU.S. 1, 13, 68 S. Ct. 836, 842, 92 L. Ed. 1161 (1948). Federal\nfunding does not make a public school a state actor. See\nBlackburn v. Fisk University, 443 F.2d 121, 123 (6th Cir. 1971).\nThus, if Title IX had been enacted under the Fourteenth\nAmendment, then the antidiscrimination provision of Title IX\nwould not reach federally funded schools that were not state\nactors. We think that the plain language of Title IX commands a\ndifferent result: no school that receives federal funding may\ndiscriminate on the basis of gender. Therefore, we conclude that\nTitle IX was enacted pursuant to a power that can reach non-state\nactors as well as state actors -- the spending power. See\nRowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013 n.14.\n\n                                  19\n\fCommission, at least six members of the Supreme Court agreed that\n\nTitle VI was enacted under the Spending Clause.     See 463 U.S. at\n\n598 - 99, 629, 638, 103 S. Ct. at 3230 - 31, 3247, 3251; see also\n\nLau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 568 - 69, 94 S. Ct. 786, 789, 39 L.\n\nEd. 2d 1 (1974) (describing how a school district \"contractually\n\nagreed to comply with title VI\" when it accepted federal\n\nfunding).\n\n        As Justice White quoted from the legislative history of\n\nTitle VI, \"It is not a regulatory measure, but an exercise of the\n\nunquestioned power of the Federal Government to fix the terms on\n\nwhich Federal funds shall be disbursed.\"     Guardians Ass'n, 463\n\nU.S. at 599, 103 S. Ct. at 3231 (quoting 110 Cong. Rec. 6546\n\n(1964) (quoting Oklahoma v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 330 U.S. 127,\n\n143, 67 S. Ct. 544, 553, 91 L. Ed. 794 (1947))) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    Justice White summed up the\n\nlegislative philosophy behind Title VI:    \"Stop the\n\ndiscrimination, get the money; continue the discrimination, do\n\nnot get the money.\"     Guardians Ass'n, 463 U.S. at 599, 103 S. Ct.\nat 3231 (quoting 110 Cong. Rec. at 1542) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).    This interpretation matches the plain language\n\nof Title VI, which conditions the disbursement of federal funds\n\non the recipient's agreement not to discriminate on the basis of\n\nrace.    See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (1994).\n        The language of Title IX is virtually identical to the\n\nlanguage of Title VI.     See 117 Cong. Rec. at 30,156 (statement of\n\nSen. Bayh).     The only differences are the substitution of the\n\n                                  20\n\fwords \"on the basis of sex\" for the words \"on the ground of race,\n\ncolor, or national origin\" and the insertion of the word\n\n\"educational\" in front of the words \"program or activity.\"     See\n\nGrove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 586, 104 S. Ct. 1211,\n\n1228, 79 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1984) (Brennan, J., concurring in part\n\nand dissenting in part); compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000d with 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1681(a).   Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has found that\n\n\"Title IX was patterned after Title VI.\"   Cannon, 441 U.S. at\n\n694, 99 S. Ct. at 1956.\n\n     The Supreme Court's study of the legislative history of\n\nTitle IX has led it to conclude that the drafters of Title IX\n\nintended that courts interpret it in the same way they have\n\ninterpreted Title VI.   Id. at 696, 99 S. Ct. at 1957.   Therefore,\n\nwe find that Title IX, like Title VI, was enacted under Congress'\n\npower to spend for the general welfare of the United States.     See\n\nRosa H. v. San Elizario Indep. Sch. Dist., 106 F.3d 648, 654 (5th\n\nCir. 1997); Lieberman v. University of Chicago, 660 F.2d 1185,\n\n1187 (7th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 937, 102 S. Ct.\n\n1993, 72 L. Ed. 2d 456 (1982).    We now consider the implications\n\nof this finding.\n\n\n\n                                 III.\n\n\n\n                                  A.\n\n\n\n     When Congress enacts legislation pursuant to the Spending\n\n                                  21\n\fClause, it in effect offers to form a contract with potential\n\nrecipients of federal funding.    See Pennhurst v. Halderman, 451\n\nU.S. 1, 17, 101 S. Ct. 1531, 1540, 67 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1981).\n\nRecipients who accept federal monies also accept the conditions\n\nCongress has attached to its offer.    See South Dakota v. Dole,\n\n483 U.S. 203, 206, 107 S. Ct. 2793, 2795 - 96, 97 L. Ed. 2d 171\n\n(1987).   A prospective recipient is free to decline a grant of\n\nfederal funding.   See New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144,\n\n168, 112 S. Ct. 2408, 2424, 120 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1992).   Similarly,\n\na current recipient may withdraw from a federal program and\n\ndecline further funding if it so chooses.    See Guardians Ass'n,\n\n463 U.S. at 596, 103 S. Ct. at 3229.   The freedom of recipients\n\nto decline prospectively or to terminate retrospectively a grant\n\nof federal funding ensures that they will remain responsive to\n\nthe preferences of their local constituents.   See New York, 505\n\nU.S. at 168, 112 S. Ct. at 2424.\n\n     To ensure the voluntariness of participation in federal\n\nprograms, the Supreme Court has required Congress to give\n\npotential recipients unambiguous notice of the conditions they\n\nare assuming when they accept federal funding.    Pennhurst, 451\nU.S. at 17, 101 S. Ct. at 1540.    A spending power provision must\n\nread like a prospectus and give funding recipients a clear signal\n\nof what they are buying.   The Court has explained, \"By insisting\n\nthat Congress speak with a clear voice, we enable the States to\n\nexercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of\n\ntheir participation.\"   Id.   With regard to the case at hand,\n\n\n                                  22\n\f\"Congress must be unambiguous in expressing to school districts\n\nthe conditions it has attached to the receipt of federal funds.\"\n\nCanutillo Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Leija, 101 F.3d 393, 398 (5th Cir.\n1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ---, --- S. Ct. ---, --- L. Ed. 2d\n\n--- (1997).    We therefore consider whether Congress gave the\n\nBoard unambiguous notice that it could be held liable for failing\n\nto stop G.F.'s harassment of LaShonda.\n\n     Appellant and the United States Department of Justice, as\n\namicus curiae, argue that Title IX gave the Board clear notice of\n\nthis form of liability.    Appellant points to the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Franklin.     In Franklin, the Court suggested that\n\n\"th[e] notice problem does not arise in a case . . . in which\n\nintentional discrimination is alleged.\"    503 U.S. at 74 - 75, 112\n\nS. Ct. at 1037.    The Court stated that the plain language of\n\nTitle IX imposes on schools a duty not to discriminate on the\n\nbasis of sex, and when a school teacher sexually harasses a\n\nstudent, that teacher is discriminating on the basis of sex.      Id.\n\nat 75, 112 S. Ct. at 1037.    Appellant argues that a school\n\nemployee is intentionally discriminating on the basis of sex when\n\nhe or she fails to prevent one student from sexually harassing\n\nanother.13    Hence, appellant asserts that the school board here\n\n     13\n          Appellant and the Department of Justice argue that we\nshould use Title VII standards of liability to interpret Title\nIX. An employer is directly liable under Title VII if it is\ndeliberately indifferent to peer sexual harassment in the\nworkplace. See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 111 F.3d 1530,\n1538 - 39 (11th Cir. 1997) (en banc). Appellant argues that a\nschool should also be liable if it is deliberately indifferent to\npeer sexual harassment at school.\n\n\n                                  23\n\f     The superficial appeal of this argument has attracted the\nadherence of a few courts. See, e.g., Bruneau, 935 F. Supp. at\n170 - 71. These courts have applied Title VII standards of\nliability to Title IX cases simply because (1) Title VII and\nTitle IX both deal with sexual harassment and (2) the Supreme\nCourt once cited a Title VII case in discussing liability under\nTitle IX, see generally Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75, 112 S. Ct. at\n1037 (quoting Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64,\n106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986)). See Bruneau, 935\nF. Supp. at 170 - 71.\n\n     However, the Supreme Court has never discussed student-\nstudent sexual harassment or generally applied Title VII\njurisprudence to Title IX cases. Perhaps for this reason, some\ncourts that have imposed Title VII-type liability under Title IX\nhave refused -- without much explanation -- to apply all of Title\nVII jurisprudence to Title IX. See, e.g., Bruneau, 935 F. Supp.\nat 169 - 70 (\"[T]he Court cautions that by holding that Title VII\nlegal standards apply to an analysis of Title IX claims, the\nCourt is not holding that the entirety of Title VII jurisprudence\nmust be applied to Title IX.\"). Other courts have altogether\nrefused to apply Title VII jurisprudence to Title IX. See, e.g.,\nRosa H., 106 F.3d at 656 (\"Franklin's single citation to Meritor\nSavings to support the Court's conclusion that sexual harassment\nis sex discrimination does not by itself justify the importation\nof other aspects of Title VII law into the Title IX context.\").\n\n     We decline appellant's invitation to use Title VII standards\nof liability to resolve this Title IX case. See Doe v. Petaluma\nCity Sch. Dist., 54 F.3d 1447, 1450 - 51 (9th Cir. 1994). First,\nTitle VII and Title IX are worded differently. If Congress\nwished Title IX to be interpreted like the earlier-enacted Title\nVII, Congress would have written Title IX to read like Title VII.\nCongress did not. Interpreting the plain language of different\nstatutes does not automatically produce the same result simply\nbecause both statutes proscribe similar behavior.\n\n     Second, Title VII was enacted under the far-reaching\nCommerce Clause and § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See\nE.E.O.C. v. Pacific Press Publ'g Ass'n, 676 F.2d 1272, 1279 n.10\n(9th Cir. 1982). Title IX was not, and consequently its reach is\nnarrower.\n\n     Third, the exposition of liability under Title VII depends\nupon agency principles. See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 72, 106 S. Ct.\nat 2408; Faragher, 111 F.3d at 1534 - 36. Agency principles are\nuseless in discussing liability for student-student harassment\nunder Title IX, because students are not agents of the school\nboard. See generally Restatement (Second) of Agency § 1 (1958)\n\n                               24\n\fhad sufficient notice, for purposes of the Spending Clause, that\n\nit could be held liable.   We disagree.14\n\n\n(defining an agency relationship as one in which the principal\nconsents to representation by the agent and the agent consents to\ncontrol by the principal). Therefore, even if employers owe to\nemployees some sort of nondelegable duty to eliminate peer\nharassment in the workplace, see generally id. § 492 (discussing\nemployers' duty to provide reasonably safe working conditions for\ntheir employees), schools owe to students no comparable duty. In\nshort, Title VII jurisprudence does not control the outcome of\nthis case.\n     14\n          We note that neither this court nor the Supreme Court\nin Franklin fully addressed the question of whether a student can\nstate a claim under Title IX for sexual harassment by a teacher -\n- much less whether a student can state a claim under Title IX\nfor sexual harassment by another student.\n\n     The defendant school board in Franklin successfully moved\nthe district court to dismiss Franklin's Title IX suit on the\nground that \"compensatory relief is unavailable for violations of\nTitle IX,\" a holding which this court affirmed. Franklin v.\nGwinnett County Pub. Schs., 911 F.2d 617, 618 (11th Cir. 1990).\nThe school board apparently conceded on appeal that the\nplaintiff's allegations stated a claim under Title IX. See id.\nat 619.\n\n     Similarly, the school board conceded before the Supreme\nCourt that teacher-student sexual harassment violated Title IX.\nSee Brief for Respondents at 2, 7, Franklin v. Gwinnett County\nSch. Dist., 503 U.S. 60, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208\n(1992) (No. 90-918). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to\nconsider \"whether the implied right of action under Title IX . .\n. supports a claim for monetary damages.\" Franklin, 503 U.S. at\n62 - 63, 112 S. Ct. at 1031. The Court emphasized that \"the\nquestion of what remedies are available under a statute that\nprovides a private right of action is 'analytically distinct'\nfrom the issue of whether such a right exists in the first\nplace.\" Id. at 65 - 66, 112 S. Ct. at 1032. In fact, the\nFranklin Court rejected the arguments of the United States as\namicus curiae precisely because those arguments concerned the\nexistence vel non of a cause of action for teacher-student sexual\nharassment, a question which the Court considered \"irrelevant.\"\nId. at 69, 112 S. Ct. at 1034.\n\n     The Franklin Court discussed the   notice element of the\nSpending Clause solely to counter the   school board's argument\nthat \"the normal presumption in favor   of all appropriate remedies\nshould not apply because Title IX was   enacted pursuant to\n\n                                25\n\f       The terms of Title IX gave educational institutions notice\n\nthat they must prevent their employees from themselves engaging\n\nin intentional gender discrimination.      See Franklin, 503 U.S. at\n75, 112 S. Ct. at 1037.    Thus, school administrators cannot deny\n\nadmission to female applicants because of their gender.      See\n\nCannon, 441 U.S. at 709, 99 S. Ct. at 1964.      School\n\nadministrators cannot discriminate against teachers on account of\n\nsex.    See North Haven Bd. of Educ., 456 U.S. at 530, 102 S. Ct.\n\nat 1922 - 23.     Teachers cannot sexually harass their students.\n\nSee Franklin, 503 U.S. at 74 - 75, 112 S. Ct. at 1037.\n\n       The present complaint, however, does not allege that a\n\nschool employee discriminated against LaShonda in any of the\n\nforegoing ways.    The complaint does not allege, for example, that\n\nFort, Maples, Pippin, or Querry sexually harassed LaShonda.\n\nRather, the complaint alleges that these individuals failed to\n\ntake measures sufficient to prevent a non-employee from\n\ndiscriminating against LaShonda.       We do not think that the Board\n\nwas on notice when it accepted federal funding that it could be\n\nheld liable in this situation.\n\n\n\n                                  B.\n\nCongress' Spending Clause power.\" Id. at 74, 112 S. Ct. at 1037.\nViewed in this light, the Supreme Court's suggestion that\nteacher-student sexual harassment gives rise to a cause of action\nunder Title IX was arguably dicta. We assume that Franklin\ncreated a cause of action for teacher-student sexual harassment\nunder Title IX, but we are wary of extending this assumed holding\nto student-student sexual harassment. In any event, the Court's\ndiscussion of this issue does not foreclose our own consideration\nof whether appellant has stated a claim under Title IX.\n\n                                  26\n\f     First, as we have noted, nothing in the language or history\n\nof Title IX suggests that Title IX imposes liability for student-\n\nstudent sexual harassment.15   Second, the imposition of this form\n\nof liability would so materially affect schools' decisions\n\nwhether to accept Title IX funding that it would require an\n\nexpress, unequivocal disclosure by Congress.    Adopting\n\nappellant's theory of liability, however, could give rise to a\n\nform of “whipsaw” liability, under which public schools would\n\nface lawsuits from both the alleged harasser and the alleged\n\nvictim of the harassment.    Moreover, reasonable public school\n\nofficials could perceive the likely number of such suits to be\n\nlarge.    Because our endorsement of appellant's theory of\n\nliability would alter materially the terms of the contract\n\nbetween Congress and recipients of federal funding, appellant\n\nfails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\n     The essence of appellant's complaint is this:    once a public\n\nschool student complains to her teacher that a classmate has\n\nsexually harassed her, the teacher and the school board become\n\n     15\n          The dissent devotes a great deal of attention to\nwhether Congress intended that Title IX create a cause of action\nfor student-student sexual harassment. See Post, at *1 - *7. We\nseriously doubt whether Congress considered this problem at all\nwhen it enacted Title IX, but, in any case, the dissent's heavy\nreliance on its conclusory analysis of the language and history\nof Title IX is largely irrelevant. The question is not whether\nCongress intended to create a cause of action under Title IX for\nstudent-student sexual harassment but, rather, whether Congress\ngave school boards notice of this form of liability. In the\nabsence of any supporting legislative history, statutory\nconstruction of ambiguous language cannot support a finding of\nnotice as required by the Spending Clause.\n\n                                 27\n\fsubject to the threat of liability in money damages under federal\n\nlaw if they can prevent the classmate from harassing again and\n\nfail to do so.16   See, e.g., Bosley, 904 F. Supp. at 1023 (\"Once\n\na school district becomes aware of sexual harassment, it must\n\npromptly take remedial action which is reasonably calculated to\n\nend the harassment.\") (emphasis added).   In practical terms, this\n\nmeans that school officials would have to isolate an alleged\n\nharasser from other students through suspension or expulsion.\n\n     The complaint devotes little attention to what measures the\n\nBoard could have taken to avoid liability.   The complaint admits\n\nthat Querry and Fort tried to stop G.F.'s harassment by\n\nthreatening him and by separating him from LaShonda within Fort's\n\nclassroom.   Appellant clearly does not believe that these\n\nmeasures sufficed.   As evidence of \"deliberate indifference,\" the\n\ncomplaint also alleges that the Board failed to create a school\n\nsexual harassment policy.   It seems unlikely, however, that the\n\nmere existence of such a policy would foreclose liability under\n\nappellant's theory of the case.\n\n     Apparently, the appropriateness of the Board's remedial\n\nmeasures depends on whether the harassment actually ends.    The\n\ncomplaint suggests that G.F. should have been \"suspended, kept\n\n\n     16\n          Private schools that receive federal funding would also\nbe subject to suit under appellant’s theory of Title IX\nliability. Private school teachers and administrators, however,\nwould not ordinarily be subject to suit under § 1983, as would\ntheir public school counterparts, because they would not\nordinarily be acting under color of state law. See § 1983; see\ngenerally supra, n.2. Accordingly, we discuss individual\nliability only with respect to public school employees.\n\n                                  28\n\faway from LaShonda, or disciplined in [some] way\" after LaShonda\n\ncomplained.   The Department of Justice argues broadly that a\n\nschool board must take \"effective action\" in response to an\n\nallegation of harassment.   We take these arguments to mean the\n\nsame thing:   a school board must immediately isolate an alleged\n\nharasser from other students to avoid the threat of a lawsuit\n\nunder Title IX.\n\n     Physical separation of the alleged harasser from other\n\nstudents is the only way school boards can ensure that they\n\ncannot be held liable for future acts of harassment.   If a school\n\nofficial simply tells the alleged harasser, \"Don't do it again,\"\n\nand the harasser does it again, then the board becomes\n\nsusceptible to the argument that it had the power to end the\n\nharassment, but failed to do so out of \"deliberate indifference.\"\n\nIf the official merely transfers the alleged harasser to another\n\nclassroom, the board faces the threat of suit for any acts of\n\nharassment committed by him in the new classroom -- after all,\n\nthe school had notice of his dangerous propensities and did not\n\ndo all it could to prevent him from harassing his new classmates.\n\nSegregating the sexes into two separate programs within the same\n\nschool would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of Title IX.\n\nTherefore, in practical terms, to avoid the threat of Title IX\n\nliability under appellant's theory of the case, a school must\n\nimmediately suspend or expel a student accused of sexual\n\n\n\n\n                                29\n\fharassment.17\n\n     Appellant's standard of liability therefore creates for\n\nschool boards and school officials a Hobson's choice:   On the one\n\nhand, if a student complains to a school official about sexual\n\nharassment, the official must suspend or expel the alleged\n\nharasser or the board will face potential liability to the\n\nvictim.   Moreover, if a public school official with control over\n\nthe harasser finds out about his misconduct and fails to isolate\n\nhim, that official runs the risk of personal liability under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 for depriving the victim of her Title IX rights if\n\nthe harasser engages in further abuse.18   See Nicole M., 1997 WL\n\n193919, at *13; Oona R.-S., 890 F. Supp. at 1462; see also\n\nLillard v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 723 - 24 (6th\n\nCir. 1996) (holding that the remedial scheme of Title IX does not\n\npreclude a section 1983 claim based on the same conduct).\n\n     On the other hand, if the public school official, presiding\n\n\n     17\n          This is the approach, incidentally, that some school\nboards have already adopted. See, e.g., Tamar Lewin, Kissing\nCases Highlight Schools' Fears of Liability for Sexual\nHarassment, N.Y. Times, Oct. 6, 1996, at A22, A22 (\"While the\nrecent suspensions of two little boys for kissing girls were\nwidely seen as excessive, they highlight the confusion that is\nsweeping schools as educators grapple with a growing fear that\nthey may be sued for failing to intervene when one student\nsexually harasses another.\").\n     18\n          If we were to rule in favor of appellant, Fort, Maples,\nPippin, Querry, and Dumas would arguably be entitled to qualified\nimmunity against § 1983 liability for their actions in this case.\nSee Doe v. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., 54 F.3d 1447, 1452 (9th Cir.\n1995). Ruling in favor of appellant, however, would deprive\nfuture, similarly situated defendants of qualified immunity,\nbecause it would clearly establish a statutory right of which a\nreasonable school employee would know.\n\n                                30\n\fover a disciplinary hearing, suspends or expels the alleged\n\nharasser, the school board may face a lawsuit alleging that the\n\nofficial acted out of bias -- out of fear of suit.   The right to\n\na public education under state law is a property interest\n\nprotected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSee Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574, 95 S. Ct. 729, 736, 42 L.\n\nEd. 2d 725 (1975).   Accordingly, students facing a deprivation of\n\nthis right must be afforded due process.19   Id. at 579, 95 S. Ct.\n\nat 738.   A fair hearing in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement\n\nof due process.   In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S. Ct.\n\n623, 625, 99 L. Ed. 942 (1955).    The decisionmaker who presides\n\nover the hearing must be impartial.20   See Withrow v. Larkin, 421\n\n     19\n          If Georgia provided a procedure for challenging the\nimpartiality of the school's decisionmaker, the alleged harasser\nwould have received all the process to which he was entitled, and\nhe would have no claim under the Due Process Clause. See\nMcKinney v. Pate, 20 F.3d 1550, 1557 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc).\nAbsent such a procedure, he could bring suit in federal court\nunder § 1983, alleging that the state failed to accord him the\nprocess he was due. Whether the alleged harasser repairs to\nstate court or to federal court, however, the disruptive effect\non school officials, teachers, and students would be the same.\n     20\n          In his separate opinion, JUDGE CARNES insists that the\nrequirements of the procedural component of the Due Process\nClause are met when a school disciplinarian affords a student\nfaced with suspension an \"informal\" opportunity to explain his\nside of the story. See Post, at *1 - *2. JUDGE CARNES'\nreasoning is correct, as far as it goes, but he focuses on one\nnarrow subset of cases -- \"any suspension of up to ten days.\"\nPost at *1.\n\n     In Goss, the Supreme Court held that, \"[a]t the very\nminimum, . . . students facing suspension and the consequent\ninterference with a protected property interest must be given\nsome kind of notice and afforded some kind of hearing.\" Id. at\n579, 95 S. Ct. at 738. The kind of notice and the formality of\nthe hearing will depend, of course, on the nature and severity of\nthe deprivation the student faces: for example, \"due process\n\n                                  31\n\fU.S. 35, 46, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 1464, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975);\n\nMcKinney v. Pate, 20 F.3d 1550, 1561 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc).\n\n     As we explain above, appellant's theory of the case could\n\nimpose personal liability on any public school official who\n\nlearns of an allegation of harassment and fails to exercise his\n\nauthority to prevent a recurrence of the harassment.   Were we to\n\nadopt appellant’s theory of the case, therefore, public school\n\n\nrequires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less,\nthat the student be given oral or written notice of the charges\nagainst him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the\nevidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his\nside of the story.\" Id. at 581, 95 S. Ct. at 740 (emphasis\nadded); see also, e.g., Board of Curators v. Horowitz, 435 U.S.\n78, 86, 98 S. Ct. 948, 953, 55 L. Ed. 2d 124 (1978) (noting that\na college student's dismissal for academic reasons necessitates\nfewer procedural protections than a dismissal for disciplinary\nreasons).\n\n     At the end of its opinion in Goss, however, the Supreme\nCourt stated, \"Longer suspensions or expulsions for the remainder\nof the school term, or permanently, may require more formal\nprocedures. Nor do we put aside the possibility that in unusual\nsituations, although involving only a short suspension, something\nmore than rudimentary procedures will be required.\" Id. at 584,\n95 S. Ct. at 741. The Supreme Court left open the possibility\nthat a more formal notice and hearing would be required for\ndisciplinary actions more serious than ten-day suspensions, and\nso shall we.\n\n     Furthermore, regardless of the nature of the notice and the\nquality of the hearing, an individual faced with the deprivation\nof a property interest is entitled to an impartial decisionmaker\n-- a requirement JUDGE CARNES seems to discount. See, e.g., Nash\nv. Auburn Univ., 812 F.2d 655, 665 (11th Cir. 1987) (\"An\nimpartial decision-maker is an essential guarantee of due\nprocess.\"). JUDGE CARNES admits, for example, that a public\nschool principal would be impermissibly biased, for purposes of\nthe Due Process Clause, if the principal \"took a bribe from [a]\ncomplaining student's parents in return for suspending or\nexpelling [an] alleged wrongdoer.\" Post, at *2. JUDGE CARNES,\nhowever, refuses to accept that a principal would be just as\nimpermissibly biased if the principal were forced to pay money to\na complaining student for not suspending or expelling an alleged\nwrongdoer. We fail to grasp the distinction.\n\n                               32\n\fofficials would have a financial incentive to punish alleged\n\nstudent harassers.   A financial incentive may render a\n\ndecisionmaker impermissibly biased.21   See Gibson v. Berryhill,\n\n     21\n          On page *4 of his separate opinion, JUDGE CARNES leads\nus through a parade of horribles which, he imagines, we have\ncreated by suggesting that appellant's theory of the case would\npotentially give public school officials an impermissible\nfinancial incentive to punish alleged student harassers. The\ndire consequences he conjures, however, will never come to pass\nprecisely because we are not adopting appellant's theory of Title\nIX liability. Only if we were to adopt her theory might public\nschool officials face potential liability under both Title IX and\nthe procedural component of the Due Process Clause. But we do\nnot adopt appellant's theory of liability.\n\n     With regard to non-school settings, JUDGE CARNES overstates\nour opinion and then criticizes us for the breadth of our\nholding. He chides us for suggesting that \"[a]ll federal, state,\nor local officials called upon to decide what to do in response\nto one person's complaint about another would have a financial\nincentive to avoid a lawsuit, which would disqualify them from\nmaking a decision.\" Post, at *4. We suggest nothing of the\nkind.\n\n     Nevertheless, on the merits of his critique, we suppose that\nall officials in such situations could face lawsuits alleging\nimpermissible bias -- if none of those officials had any form of\nimmunity from suit, which, of course, they do have. Stated\ndifferently, public decisionmakers have immunity from suit to\nprotect them from the sort of bias which might otherwise give\nrise to violations of the Due Process Clause. Judges, for\nexample, have absolute immunity from suit because \"the\nindependent and impartial exercise of judgment vital to the\njudiciary might be impaired by exposure to potential damages\nliability.\" Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc., 508 U.S. 429,\n435, 113 S. Ct. 2167, 2171, 124 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1993). Similar\nconcerns motivate qualified immunity. See generally Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 2736, 73 L. Ed.\n2d 396 (1982) (reasoning that, without qualified immunity, \"there\nis the danger that fear of being sued will 'dampen the ardor of\nall but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible [public\nofficials], in the unflinching discharge of their duties'\"\n(quoting Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579, 581 (2nd Cir. 1949),\ncert. denied, 339 U.S. 949, 70 S. Ct. 803, 94 L. Ed. 1363 (1950))\n(alterations in original)). In fact, as we discuss supra, note\n18, the individual defendants in this case would likely be\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n                                33\n\f411 U.S. 564, 579, 93 S. Ct. 1689, 1698, 36 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1973).\n\nTherefore, the disciplinary measures required to avoid liability\n\nunder Title IX could subject the school board to the threat of\n\nsuit by the disciplined harasser.22\n\n     In addition to the threat of this whipsaw liability, schools\n\nwould face the virtual certainty of extensive litigation costs.\n\nThese costs would include not only lawyers fees, but also the\n\nburdens associated with the disruption of the educational\n\nprocess.   The litigation we describe would inevitably involve\n\n\n\n     In sum, we create no new procedural due process rights, as\nJUDGE CARNES asserts. Our opinion does not even suggest that we\nwould have to create such rights if we were to uphold appellant's\ntheory of Title IX liability. Rather, our opinion states that\nthis form of liability is a logical extension of appellant's\ntheory of the case, and Congress gave no notice to public school\nboards that they would be potentially undertaking this form of\nliability when they accepted federal funding under Title IX.\n     22\n          All of the foregoing assumes, of course, that the\nallegations of harassment are true. While we hesitate to assume\nthat any allegations of student-student sexual harassment are\nfalse, we do not doubt that school students will be tempted into\nmischief by the prospect of swift punishment against any\nclassmate whom they accuse of sexual harassment.\n\n     Moreover, public school officials would find such false\naccusations difficult to combat. Under Title VII standards of\nliability, which the appellant, the United States, and the\ndissent seem anxious to adopt, an employer may be sued for\nretaliating against an employee who complains about sexual\nharassment. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (1994) (\"It\nshall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to\ndiscriminate against any individual . . . because he has made a\ncharge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\").\nThus, under the logical implications of appellants theory of\nTitle IX liability, a school board could face a lawsuit from the\ncomplaining student if it disciplines her for bringing a\nvexatious complaint against a classmate. As discussed in the\ntext, the threat of lawsuits under § 1983 against the public\nschool officials themselves would soon follow.\n\n                                34\n\fteachers, students, and administrators in time-consuming\n\ndiscovery and trial preparation.    Schools could reasonably expect\n\nto receive from Congress explicit notice of these consequences.\n\nThey did not.23\n\n     23\n          Appellant and the Department of Justice draw our\nattention to the regulatory activities of the Office of Civil\nRights of the United States Department of Justice (\"OCR\"). The\nOCR issued interim guidelines concerning schoolhouse sexual\nharassment on August 16, 1996. See Sexual Harassment Guidance:\nPeer Sexual Harassment, 61 Fed. Reg. 42,728 (1996). These\nguidelines issued after the alleged harassment of LaShonda.\nMoreover, at the time of the alleged harassment, the code of\nfederal regulations did not discuss student-student sexual\nharassment. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (1992). Therefore, OCR's\nregulations did not put the Board on official notice of its\npotential liability for G.F.'s harassment of LaShonda.\n\n     Nevertheless, appellant and the Department of Justice urge\nthat we defer to the OCR's current interpretation of Title IX for\npurposes of this case. The OCR issued final policy guidance on\nstudent sexual harassment on March 13, 1997. See Sexual\nHarassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees,\nOther Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,034 (1997). In\nthis publication, the OCR constructs a labyrinth of factors and\ncaveats which simply reinforces our conclusion that the Board was\nnot on notice that it could be held liable in the present\nsituation.\n\n     According to the March 13 guidance, schools are liable for\nfailing to eliminate\n\n     sexually harassing conduct (which can include unwelcome\n     sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other\n     verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual\n     nature) . . . by another student . . . that is\n     sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit\n     a student's ability to participate in or benefit from\n     an education program or activity, or to create a\n     hostile or abusive educational environment.\n\nId. at 12,038.\n     Because the meaning of this language may not be obvious to\nschool officials, the March 13 guidance lists several factors\nwhich should be taken into account when a student is sent to the\noffice for sexually harassing another student. Among other\nfactors and subfactors, the school official should consider the\n\n                               35\n\f                               C.\n\n\n\n     School boards could reasonably believe that this form of\n\nwhipsaw liability would arise in a substantial number of cases.\n\nAccording to a 1993 survey of American public school students,\n\n65% of students in grades eight to eleven were victims of\n\n\n\n\"welcomeness\" of the conduct, the age of the harasser, the age of\nthe victim, the relationship between the parties, the degree to\nwhich the conduct was sexual in nature, the duration of the\nconduct, the frequency of the conduct involved, the degree to\nwhich the conduct affected the victim's education, the\npervasiveness of the conduct at the school, the location of the\nincident, the occurrence of any similar incidents at the school,\nthe occurrence of any incidents of gender-based but non-sexual\nharassment, the size of the school, and the number of individuals\ninvolved in the incident.\n\n     The school official should keep in mind that \"in some\ncircumstances, nonsexual conduct may take on sexual connotations\nand may rise to the level of sexual harassment.\" Id. at 12,039.\nHe should also remember that \"a hostile environment may exist\neven if there is no tangible injury to the student,\" and even if\nthe complaining student was not the target of the harassment.\nId. at 12,041. In addition, the official must recall that a\nsingle act of student-student harassment can create a hostile\nenvironment. See id. Finally, the school official must keep in\nmind that, if he does not kick the alleged harasser out of\nschool, and the harasser misbehaves again, the official could be\npersonally liable if a jury concludes, after the fact, that he\ncould have done more to prevent the harasser from harming his\nclassmates.\n\n     The foregoing analysis assumes, of course, that the school\nofficial actually knew of the complaint against the harasser and\nsummoned him to the front office. According to the OCR, however,\nthe official may be liable even if he did not know about the\nharassment: the official may cause the school to violate Title\nIX if he failed to exercise \"due care\" in discovering the\nmisconduct. See id. at 12,042. The foregoing does not address\nthe lawsuit that the harasser's parents will file when the school\nofficial summarily suspends him. According to appellant and the\nDepartment of Justice, the Board received clear notice of this\nform of liability when it accepted federal funding under Title\nIX. We think not.\n\n                               36\n\fstudent-student sexual harassment.     See American Ass'n of Univ.\n\nWomen Educ. Found., Hostile Hallways:     The AAUW Survey on Sexual\n\nHarassment in American Schools 11 (1993) [hereinafter AAUW\n\nSurvey].   Extrapolating from Department of Education statistics,\n\nroughly 7,784,000 public school students in grades eight through\n\neleven would consider themselves to be victims of student-student\n\nsexual harassment.24   Furthermore, 59% of students (including 52%\n\nof female students) in grades eight to eleven responded that they\n\nhad sexually harassed other students.     See AAUW Survey, supra, at\n\n11 - 12.   Thus, if this survey is accurate, around 7,177,000\n\npublic school students in grades eight to eleven, male and\n\nfemale, would admit to sexually harassing other students.\n\n     We do not adopt these statistics as our own definitive guide\n\nto the extent of sexual harassment in America’s public schools.\n\nWe draw attention to these figures only to illustrate what school\n\nboards would have to consider in deciding whether to accept\n\nfederal funding under Title IX.    The AAUW Survey could suggest to\n\nreasonable public school officials that a substantial number of\n\nlawsuits will be brought under appellant’s theory of Title IX\n\n\n     24\n          To calculate the number of purported student victims of\nharassment in the nation, we multiplied the percentage of victims\nprovided by the AAUW Survey by the total number of students\nenrolled in public schools in grades eight to eleven during the\n1992-1993 school year. We obtained the enrollment statistics\nfrom the world-wide-web home page of the Department of Education.\nSee, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Educ., Enrollment in Public Elementary\nand Secondary Schools, by Grade: Fall 1980 to Fall 1994 (last\nmodified Mar. 1996) <http://nces01.ed.gov/nces/pubs/D96/\nD96T042.html> [hereinafter U.S. Education]. We used the same\nprocess to calculate the total number of professed student\nharassers in the nation.\n\n                                  37\n\fliability.    Therefore, imposition of this form of liability would\n\nmaterially affect their decision whether to accept federal\n\neducational funding.25\n     An enactment under the Spending Clause must read like a\n\nprospectus.   Just as a prospectus must unambiguously disclose all\n\nmaterial facts to a would-be purchaser, an enactment under the\n\nSpending Clause must unambiguously disclose to would-be\n\nrecipients all facts material to their decision to accept Title\n\nIX funding.   The threat of whipsaw liability in a substantial\n\nnumber of cases would materially affect a Title IX recipient's\n\ndecision to accept federal funding, yet Congress did not provide\n\nunambiguous notice of this type of liability in the language or\n\nhistory of that statute.   We will not alter retrospectively the\n\n\n     25\n          In JUDGE CARNES' separate opinion, he characterizes our\nuse of statistics as an attempt \"to establish that student-\nstudent sexual harassment is such a widespread and extensive\nproblem that a different holding of this case would impose\nmassive liability upon school officials and boards.\" Post, at\n*8. As we indicate in the text, this is not our objective at\nall. We cite these statistics because school boards may consider\nthem to be a valid indicator of the amount of litigation that\nthey will face. If a lawyer for the Monroe County School Board\nwere trying to advise the Board about the potential costs and\nbenefits of accepting federal funding, would it not matter to\nthat lawyer whether accepting federal funds would give rise to a\nfew lawsuits or thousands of lawsuits?\n\n     JUDGE CARNES suggests that the AAUW Survey overstates the\nactual number of lawsuits that could be brought under appellant's\ntheory of Title IX liability. We agree that the survey did not\nuse the same definition of student-student sexual harassment as\nour case law dictates, but statistical purity would arguably\nrequire a jury verdict agreeing with the allegations of each\nstudent who claimed to have been harassed. In any event, there\nare plenty of reasons for public school officials to overlook the\nstatistical flaws in the AAUW Survey when it is their own\npocketbooks -- not those of federal judges -- that are at stake.\n\n                                 38\n\fterms of the agreement between Congress and recipients of Title\n\nIX funding.26\n\n\n\n                               IV.\n\n\n\n     We condemn the harm that has befallen LaShonda, a harm for\n\n\n\n     26\n          As noted above, the purpose of enactments under the\nSpending Clause is \"to further [Congress's] broad policy\nobjectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon\ncompliance by the recipient with federal statutory and\nadministrative directives.\" Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S.\n448, 474, 100 S. Ct. 2758, 2772, 65 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1980) (opinion\nof Burger, C.J.). Congress uses the spending power \"to induce\ngovernments and private parties to cooperate voluntarily with\nfederal policy.\" Id. If no one chooses to receive federal funds\nunder a proposed legislative program, Congress's intent would be\nfrustrated and its policy objectives would remain unfulfilled.\nSee Rowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013.\n\n     Prospective recipients will decline federal funding and\ncurrent recipients will withdraw from federal programs if the\ncost of legislative conditions exceeds the amount of the\ndisbursement. Federal funding represents only 7% of all revenues\nfor public elementary and secondary schools in the United States.\nDuring the 1992-1993 school year, for example, American schools\nreceived $17,261,252,000 from the federal government out of a\ntotal budget of $247,626,168,000. See U.S. Education, supra, at\n<D96T157.html>.\n\n     School authorities must weigh the benefit of this relatively\nsmall amount of funding against not only the threat of\nsubstantial institutional and individual liability -- as\nsuggested by the AAUW Survey -- but also the opportunity costs of\ndevoting to litigation hours that might otherwise be spent\nrunning their schools. Because harassment of the sort\nexperienced by LaShonda is rarely observed directly by school\nofficials, Title IX claims of the sort envisioned by appellant\nwould require the time-consuming testimony of numerous student\nwitnesses. Imposing the liability of the sort envisioned by\nappellant could induce school boards to simply reject federal\nfunding -- in contravention of the will of Congress. See\nRowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013.\n\n\n                               39\n\fwhich Georgia tort law may indeed provide redress.    Appellant's\n\npresent complaint, however, fails to state a claim under Title IX\n\nbecause Congress gave no clear notice to schools and teachers\n\nthat they, rather than society as a whole, would accept\n\nresponsibility for remedying student-student sexual harassment\n\nwhen they chose to accept federal financial assistance under\n\nTitle IX.    Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\nCircuit Judges EDMONDSON, COX, BIRCH, DUBINA, BLACK and CARNES\n\nconcur in the court’s opinion with the exception of Parts III.B\n\nand III.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                 40\n\f",

Lanier Anderson recused himself and did not participate\nin this decision.\n**Senior Judge Phyllis A. Kravitch, who was a member of the en\nbanc court which heard oral argument in this case, took senior\nstatus on January 1, 1997, and has elected to participate in this\ndecision pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(c).\n\fTJOFLAT, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n\n     Appellant, Aurelia Davis, brought this suit against the\n\nBoard of Education of Monroe County, Georgia, (the \"Board\") and\n\ntwo school officials, Charles Dumas and Bill Querry, on behalf of\n\nher daughter, LaShonda Davis.     The complaint alleged that the\n\ndefendants violated Section 901 of the Education Amendments of\n\n1972, Pub. L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235, 373 (1972) (codified as\n\namended at 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994)) (\"Title IX\"), and 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 19831 by failing to prevent a student at Hubbard Elementary\n\nSchool (\"Hubbard\") from sexually harassing LaShonda while she was\n\na student there.   Appellant separately alleged that the\n\ndefendants discriminated against LaShonda on the basis of race in\n\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981.2    Appellant sought injunctive\n\n     1\n          This section provides, \"Every person who, under color\nof any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any\nState . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . person\n. . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the\nparty injured . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994).\n     2\n          Davis actually alleged that the named defendants\ndiscriminated on the basis of race in violation of \"the Education\nAct of 1972 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\" Davis was\napparently referring to the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub. L.\nNo. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235 (1972), and the Civil Rights Act of\n1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (1991). The former\nact, however, does not address racial discrimination in\neducation, and the latter act does not provide a cause of action\nfor racial discrimination in education. The district court\nconstrued this portion of the complaint to allege a violation of\n42 U.S.C. § 1981, which does provide a cause of action against\ncertain types of racial discrimination.\n\n                                   2\n\frelief and $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n     The district court dismissed appellant's complaint in its\n\nentirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted.    See Aurelia D. v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 862 F.\n\nSupp. 363, 368 (M.D. Ga. 1994); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).   Appellant appealed the district court's dismissal of\n\nher Title IX claim against the Board,3 arguing that a school\n\nboard can be held liable under Title IX for its failure to\n\n\n\n     3\n          Davis did not appeal the district court's dismissal of\nher Title IX claim with regard to individual defendants Dumas and\nQuerry. Davis similarly did not appeal the district court's\ndismissal of her § 1981 claim. Therefore, we do not consider\nthese claims.\n\n     With regard to Davis' § 1983 claim, the complaint seemed to\nallege that the defendants were liable under this provision\nsolely because they violated Title IX. Davis, however,\napparently argued before the district court that the defendants\nwere liable under § 1983 for infringing LaShonda's rights under\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. The district court dismissed this implied\nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6). See Aurelia D., 862 F. Supp. at 366.\n\n     Davis did not appeal the dismissal of her § 1983 claim to\nthe extent it was based on the defendants' alleged violation of\nTitle IX. Accordingly, that claim is not before us. She did,\nhowever, appeal the dismissal of her § 1983 claim to the extent\nit was based on the defendants' alleged violation of the Due\nProcess Clause. In addition, Davis argued for the first time\nbefore the three-judge panel that the same § 1983 claim\nencompassed a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n     The panel rejected Davis' due-process and equal-protection\narguments and affirmed the dismissal of her steadily expanding §\n1983 claim under 11th Cir. R. 36-1. See Davis v. Monroe County\nBd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711211\"><a href=\"/opinion/711211/aurelia-davis-anf-of-lashonda-d-v-monroe-county-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1188 (1996). Davis did not petition\nthe court to rehear this ruling en banc, and we see no reason to\ndisturb the panel's decision sua sponte. We therefore do not\nconsider Davis' various § 1983 claims. In sum, we address only\nDavis' Title IX claim against the Board.\n\n                                  3\n\fprevent sexual harassment among students.    On appeal, a divided\n\nthree-judge panel reinstated her Title IX claim against the\n\nBoard.   See Davis v.

To this end, we take as true the\n\nallegations appellant has set forth in her complaint and examine\n\nwhether those allegations describe an injury for which the law\n\nprovides relief.   See Welch v.

Granting rehearing en banc vacated the panel\nopinion by operation of law. 11th Cir. R. 35-11.\n\n                                  4\n\fallegations contained in appellant's complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n\n\n     LaShonda Davis was enrolled as a fifth-grade student at\n\nHubbard during the 1992-1993 school year.   During that school\n\nyear, Bill Querry was the principal of Hubbard, and Diane Fort,\n\nJoyce Pippin, and Whit Maples were teachers at the school.    The\n\ncomplaint alleges that the Board administered federally funded\n\neducational programs at Hubbard and supervised the school's\n\nemployees, including Principal Querry and Teachers Fort, Pippin,\n\nand Maples.\n\n     According to the complaint, a fifth-grade student named\n\n\"G.F.\" was in several of LaShonda's classes and initially was\n\nassigned to the seat next to LaShonda in Fort's classroom.    On\n\nDecember 17, 1992, while in Fort's classroom, G.F. allegedly\n\ntried to touch LaShonda's breasts and vaginal area.   G.F. also\n\nallegedly directed vulgarities at LaShonda, such as \"I want to\n\nget in bed with you\" and \"I want to feel your boobs.\"   LaShonda\n\ncomplained to Fort.   After school that day, LaShonda also told\n\nher mother, the appellant, about G.F.'s behavior.   The complaint\n\nstates that G.F. engaged in similar (although unspecified)\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fconduct on or about January 4, 1993,5 and again on January 20,\n\n1993.    LaShonda allegedly reported both incidents to Fort and to\n\nappellant.    After one of these first three incidents, appellant\n\ncalled Fort, who told appellant in the course of their\n\nconversation that Principal Querry knew about one of the\n\nincidents.\n\n     G.F.'s misconduct continued.     On February 3, 1993, G.F.\n\nallegedly placed a door-stop in his pants and behaved in a\n\nsexually suggestive manner toward LaShonda during their physical\n\neducation class.    LaShonda reported this incident to Maples, who\n\nwas the physical education teacher.     On February 10, 1993, G.F.\n\nengaged in unspecified conduct similar to that of the December 17\n\nincident in the classroom of Pippin, another of LaShonda's\n\nteachers.    LaShonda notified Pippin of G.F.'s behavior and later\n\ntold appellant, who then called Pippin to discuss the incident.\n\nOn March 1, 1993, G.F. directed more unspecified, offensive\n\nconduct toward LaShonda during physical education class.\n\nLaShonda reported G.F. to Maples and Pippin.     An unidentified\n\nteacher allegedly told LaShonda that Principal Querry was not\n\nready to listen to her complaint about G.F.\n\n     At some point around March 17, 1993, Fort allowed LaShonda\n\n\n     5\n          The complaint actually alleges that this second\ninstance of harassment occurred \"on or about January 2, 1993.\"\nWe note that January 2, 1993 was a Saturday. Presumably, there\nwas no school on Saturday, so G.F. could not have sexually\nharassed LaShonda at Hubbard on that day. Friday, January 1,\n1993, was a holiday. Accordingly, we assume for appellant's\nbenefit that the alleged harassment occurred on or about January\n4, 1993.\n\n                                  6\n\fto change assigned seats away from G.F.    G.F., however, persisted\n\nin his unwelcome attentions.    On April 12, 1993, he rubbed his\n\nbody against LaShonda in a manner she considered sexually\n\nsuggestive; this incident occurred in the hallway on the way to\n\nlunch.   LaShonda again complained to Fort.\n\n     Lastly, on May 19, 1993, LaShonda complained to appellant\n\nafter school about more unspecified behavior by G.F.    Appellant\n\nand LaShonda then paid a visit to Principal Querry to discuss\n\nG.F.'s conduct.    At this meeting, Querry asked LaShonda why no\n\nother students had complained about G.F.    During this meeting,\n\nQuerry also told appellant, \"I guess I'll have to threaten [G.F.]\n\na little bit harder.\"    On the same day, May 19, G.F. was charged\n\nwith sexual battery, a charge which he apparently did not deny.\n\nThe complaint does not tell us who summoned the police.\n\n     In all, the complaint describes eight separate instances of\n\nsexual harassment by G.F.    These eight instances of alleged\n\nharassment occurred, on average, once every twenty-two days over\n\na six-month period.    Three instances occurred in Fort's\n\nclassroom; two occurred in Maples' physical education class; one\n\noccurred in Pippin's classroom; one occurred in a school hallway;\n\nand one occurred in an unspecified location.    LaShonda reported\n\nfour instances of alleged harassment to Fort, two to Maples, and\n\ntwo to Pippin.    LaShonda reported the final instance of\n\nharassment, the May 19 incident, to appellant and Querry.    The\n\ncomplaint does not allege that any faculty member knew of more\nthan four instances of harassment, and the complaint indicates\n\n\n                                  7\n\fthat Principal Querry learned of only one instance of harassment\n\nbefore his meeting with appellant and LaShonda on May 19.\n\n       The complaint does not state what action each of the\n\nteachers took upon being informed by LaShonda of G.F.'s demeaning\n\nconduct.    We assume for appellant's benefit that the teachers\n\ntook no action other than Fort's apparent notification of\n\nPrincipal Querry after one of the first three instances of\n\nalleged harassment and Fort's decision around March 17, 1993, to\n\nmove LaShonda's assigned seat away from that of G.F.    We will\n\nalso accept as true that Principal Querry took no measures\n\nagainst G.F. other than threatening him with disciplinary action\n\nat some point before his May 19 meeting with appellant and her\n\ndaughter.    For example, we assume for appellant's benefit that\n\nsomeone other than the school staff instigated the prosecution of\n\nG.F.\n\n       Appellant claims that LaShonda suffered mental anguish\n\nbecause of G.F.'s behavior.    As indicia of this emotional trauma,\n\nthe complaint states that LaShonda's grades dropped during the\n\n1992-1993 school year and that LaShonda wrote a suicide note in\n\nApril 1993.    Based on the above allegations, appellant contends\n\nthat \"[t]he deliberate indifference by Defendants to the\n\nunwelcomed [sic] sexual advances of a student upon LaShonda\n\ncreated an intimidating, hostile, offensive and abuse [sic]\n\nschool environment in violation of Title IX.\"    We therefore\n\nconsider whether Title IX allows a claim against a school board\nbased on a school official's failure to remedy a known hostile\n\n\n                                  8\n\fenvironment6 caused by the sexual harassment of one student by\n\nanother (\"student-student sexual harassment\").\n\n\n\n                                II.\n\n\n\n     Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States\n\nshall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be\n\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\n\nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial\n\nassistance.\"   20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994).   Although nothing in the\n\nplain language of Title IX speaks to the issue of student-student\n\nsexual harassment, several district courts have held that Title\n\nIX allows a student to sue a school board for failing to prevent\n\nhostile-environment sexual harassment by another student.

In general, the Court has\n\nallowed private plaintiffs to proceed under Title IX only in\n\ncases that allege intentional gender discrimination by the\n\nadministrators of educational institutions.   According to the\n\nCourt, plaintiffs can state a claim under Title IX by alleging\n\nthat a federally funded educational institution, acting through\n\nits employees, intentionally subjected them to discrimination in\n\nits educational programs or activities.

Appellant does not allege that any employee of the\n\nBoard intentionally discriminated against LaShonda by personally\n\nparticipating in G.F.'s offensive conduct toward her.    Rather,\n\nappellant alleges that the Board violated Title IX by failing\n\nadequately to respond to LaShonda's complaints.    Neither the\n\nSupreme Court nor this court has considered whether a Title IX\n\nplaintiff can proceed under this theory.    In short, by seeking\n\ndirect liability of the Board for the wrongdoing of a student,\n\nappellant argues for an extension of liability under Title IX.\n\nWe examine the legislative history of Title IX to determine\n\nwhether Congress intended this provision to reach appellant's\n\nallegations.\n\n\n\n                                A.\n\n\n\n     The provision now known as Title IX emerged from a flurry of\n\nbills regarding public education.    In June and July 1970, the\n\nHouse Subcommittee on Education of the House Committee on\n\nEducation and Labor, under the leadership of Representative Edith\n\nGreen, held hearings on gender discrimination in federally funded\n\neducational programs.   See Discrimination Against Women: Hearings\n\n\n                                12\n\fon Section 805 of H.R. 16098 Before the Special Subcomm. on\n\nEducation of the House Comm. on Education and Labor, 91st Cong.,\n\n2d Sess. (1970) [hereinafter House Hearings].     None of the\n\ntestimony before Representative Green's subcommittee concerned\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment or related issues, such as\n\nschool discipline.   Instead, the subcommittee's work focused on\n\neliminating gender discrimination in school admissions and in the\n\nemployment decisions of school administrators.\n\n     By 1970, section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already\n\nprohibited gender discrimination in employment.    See Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, § 703, 78 Stat. 241, 255 (1964)\n\n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (1994)) (\"Title VII\").7     Title\n\nVII, however, did not apply to educational institutions.        See §\n\n702, 78 Stat. at 255 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1\n\n(1994)).   Similarly, section 601 of the Civil Rights Act\n\nprohibited racial discrimination by all recipients of federal\n\nfunding.   See § 601, 78 Stat. at 252 (codified at 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000d (1994)) (\"Title VI\").8   Title VI did not ban gender\n\ndiscrimination by recipients of federal funding.\n\n\n     7\n          Title VII states, \"It shall be an unlawful employment\npractice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions,\nor privileges of employment, because of such individual's . . .\nsex.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (1994).\n     8\n          Title VI provides that \"[n]o person in the United\nStates shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin,\nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or\nbe subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000d\n(1994).\n\n                                13\n\f      To fill this gap in antidiscrimination legislation, the\n\nsubcommittee drafted a proposed amendment to H.R. 16098, 91st\n\nCong. (1970).     This amendment would have applied to schools the\n\nnon-discrimination requirements of Title VII and added \"sex\" to\n\nthe types of discrimination banned by Title VI.       See House\n\nHearings, supra, at 1.     In other words, the subcommittee's\n\namendment was designed to bridge the gap between Title VII and\n\nTitle VI.

(1971).   This bill contained a\n\nprovision similar to the amendment proposed by Representative\n\nGreen's subcommittee nearly one year earlier.     Title X of H.R.\n\n7248 prohibited gender discrimination in any education program or\n\nactivity receiving federal financial support.        H.R. Rep. No. 92-\n\n554, at 108 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2462, 2511 -\n\n12.      The House report on H.R. 7248 described this provision as a\nresponse to discriminatory admissions policies and employment\n\npractices at federally funded schools.     See id.    Once again,\n\nneither the House report nor the underlying testimony discussed\n\nstudent-student sexual harassment.\n\n      While the House bill remained in committee, the Senate was\n\nconsidering a similar education bill.    See S. 659, 92nd Cong.\n\n(1971).     The Senate bill emerged from the Senate Committee on\n\nLabor and Public Welfare on August 3, 1971, without any\n\n                                  14\n\fantidiscrimination provision at all.      Consequently, on August 5,\n\n1971, Senator Birch Bayh introduced on the Senate floor an\n\namendment to the committee's version of S. 659.      See 117 Cong.\n\nRec. 30,156. (1971).   His amendment, like the House provision\n\ndrafted by Representative Green's subcommittee, extended the\n\nantidiscrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to\n\ngender discrimination by federally funded \"institutions of higher\n\nlearning.\"9   See id. at 30,155.    In defending his amendment,\n\nSenator Bayh did not discuss student-student sexual harassment,\n\nnor did he discuss school discipline.      He focused on gender\n\ndiscrimination in school admissions and employment opportunities\n\nfor female teachers.   See id. at 30,155 - 56.     In any event, the\n\nSenate rejected Bayh's amendment as non-germane, id. at 30,415,\n\nand the Senate passed S. 659 on August 6, 1971, without an\n\nantidiscrimination provision.\n\n     On November 3, 1971, the House began consideration of S.\n\n659, as passed by the Senate.      The House \"amended\" the Senate\n\nbill by striking virtually the entire contents of S. 659 and\n\nreplacing it with the contents of H.R. 7248, including the\n\nantidiscrimination provision.      See S. Rep. No. 92-604, at 1\n\n(1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2595, 2595.      The House\n\n\n\n     9\n          Senator Bayh's first amendment provided, \"No person . .\n. shall, on the ground of sex, . . . be subject to discrimination\nunder any program or activity conducted by a public institution\nof higher education, or any school or department of graduate\neducation, which is a recipient of Federal financial assistance\nfor any education program or activity.\" 117 Cong. Rec. at\n30,156.\n                                   15\n\fmade this change without official comment and passed its version\n\nof S. 659 on November 4, 1971.     See 117 Cong. Rec. at 30,882.\n\n     On November 24, 1971, the Senate, by unanimous consent,\n\nreferred the House version of S. 659 back to the Committee on\n\nLabor and Public Welfare, which proceeded to amend the House\n\nversion to conform to the original Senate version.     See S. Rep.\n\nNo. 92-604, at 1 - 2 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2595,\n\n2595 - 96.     Once again, the committee did not discuss gender\n\ndiscrimination at all, much less sexual harassment among\n\nstudents.    On February 7, 1972, the Senate committee sent its own\n\nversion of S. 659 back to the floor of the Senate.     See 118 Cong.\n\nRec. 2806 (1972).\n\n     Once the bill returned to the Senate floor, Senator Bayh\n\nagain introduced an amendment to add an antidiscrimination\n\nprovision.10    See id. at 5802 - 03.   Bayh's proposal was intended\n\nto \"close[] loopholes in existing legislation relating to general\n\neducation programs and employment resulting from those programs.\"\n\nId. at 5803.     In support of his amendment, Senator Bayh stated,\n     we are dealing with three basically different types of\n\n     discrimination here[:] . . . discrimination in\n\n     admission to an institution, discrimination of [sic]\n\n     available services or studies within an institution\n\n     once students are admitted, and discrimination in\n\n\n     10\n          Senator Bayh's second amendment stated, \"No person . .\n. shall, on the basis of sex, . . . be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance . . . .\" 118 Cong.

To counter these problems, Senator Bayh proposed a\n\nprovision he thought would \"cover such crucial aspects as\n\nadmissions procedures, scholarships, and faculty employment, with\n\nlimited exceptions.\"    Id. at 5803.   Yet again, no senator\n\nmentioned student-student sexual harassment or school discipline.\n\n     The Senate adopted Bayh's second amendment on February 28,\n\n1972.   See 118 Cong. Rec. at 5815 (1972).    Because of\n\nirreconcilable differences between the House and Senate versions\n\nof S. 659, both Houses referred the bill to a conference\n\ncommittee.     See S. Conf. Rept. No. 92-798, at 1 (1972).     The\n\nconference committee reported out a joint bill containing the\n\nantidiscrimination measure now known as Title IX.    The committee,\n\nhowever, did not explain its reasons for including Title IX.         The\n\nconference bill passed both Houses and was signed into law on\n\nJune 23, 1972.    See 118 Cong. Rec. at 22,702.   Throughout this\n\nlong legislative history, the drafters of Title IX never\n\ndiscussed student-student sexual harassment or the related issue\n\nof school discipline.\n\n\n\n                                  B.\n\n\n\n     While the legislative history of Title IX does not indicate\n\nthat Congress authorized a private cause of action for student-\n\nstudent sexual harassment, the legislative history does show that\n\n                                  17\n\fTitle IX was enacted under the Spending Clause of Article I.

The legislative history of Title\n\nIX indicates that Congress intended to impose upon recipients of\n\nfederal educational assistance a requirement of non-\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.     The Spending Clause\n\nauthorized Congress to impose this condition.\n\n     Representative Green put it succinctly:     \"If we are writing\n\nthe law, I would say that any institution could be all men or all\n\nwomen, but my own feeling is that they do it with their own funds\n\nand not taxpayers' funds.\"   Higher Education Amendments of 1971:\nHearings on H.R. 32, H.R. 5191, H.R. 5192, H.R. 5193, and H.R.\n\n7248 Before the Special Subcomm. on Education of the House Comm.\n\non Education and Labor, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 581 (1971).\nRepresentative Green also quoted with approval President Nixon,\n\nwho had stated, \"Neither the President nor the Congress nor the\n\nconscience of the Nation can permit money which comes from all\n\nthe people to be used in a way which discriminates against some\n\nof the people.\"   117 Cong. Rec. at 39,257 (1971) (statement of\n\n\n     11\n          Section 8 of Article I provides, in part, that \"[t]he\nCongress shall have [the] Power To . . . provide for the . . .\ngeneral Welfare of the United States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8,\ncl. 1.\n\n                                 18\n\fRep. Green).   To Senator Bayh, the reach of Title IX was clearly\n\nrestricted to federally funded institutions.   See 118 Cong. Rec.\n\nat 5812.   In support of Title IX, Senator McGovern stated, \"I\n\nurge my colleagues to take every opportunity to prohibit Federal\n\nfunding of sex discrimination.\"    117 Cong. Rec. at 30,158.   This\n\nlegislative history clearly shows that Congress intended Title IX\n\nto be a \"typical 'contractual' spending-power provision.\"12\n\nGuardians Ass'n, 463 U.S. at 599, 103 S. Ct. at 3231.\n\n     In addition to these indications of congressional intent,\n\nsimilarities between Title IX and Title VI indicate that Title IX\n\nwas enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause.   As noted above,\n\nTitle VI prohibits recipients of federal funding from engaging in\n\nrace discrimination.   In Guardians Association v. Civil Service\n\n\n\n     12\n          The Supreme Court has left open the question of whether\nTitle IX was enacted under the Spending Clause. See Franklin,\n503 U.S. at 75 n.8, 112 S. Ct. at 1038 n.8. One could argue, as\ndid the petitioner in Franklin, that Title IX was enacted under §\n5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides Congress with the\nauthority to enact legislation preventing states from \"deny[ing]\nto any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV, § 1, cl. 4.\n\n     The Equal Protection Clause, however, only protects against\naction by state-sponsored entities. See Shelley v.

We think that the plain language of Title IX commands a\ndifferent result: no school that receives federal funding may\ndiscriminate on the basis of gender. Therefore, we conclude that\nTitle IX was enacted pursuant to a power that can reach non-state\nactors as well as state actors -- the spending power. See\nRowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013 n.14.\n\n                                  19\n\fCommission, at least six members of the Supreme Court agreed that\n\nTitle VI was enacted under the Spending Clause.

See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (1994).\n        The language of Title IX is virtually identical to the\n\nlanguage of Title VI.     See 117 Cong. Rec. at 30,156 (statement of\n\nSen. Bayh).

Perhaps for this reason, some\ncourts that have imposed Title VII-type liability under Title IX\nhave refused -- without much explanation -- to apply all of Title\nVII jurisprudence to Title IX. See, e.g., Bruneau, 935 F. Supp.\nat 169 - 70 (\"[T]he Court cautions that by holding that Title VII\nlegal standards apply to an analysis of Title IX claims, the\nCourt is not holding that the entirety of Title VII jurisprudence\nmust be applied to Title IX.\"). Other courts have altogether\nrefused to apply Title VII jurisprudence to Title IX. See, e.g.,\nRosa H., 106 F.3d at 656 (\"Franklin's single citation to Meritor\nSavings to support the Court's conclusion that sexual harassment\nis sex discrimination does not by itself justify the importation\nof other aspects of Title VII law into the Title IX context.\").\n\n     We decline appellant's invitation to use Title VII standards\nof liability to resolve this Title IX case.

First,\nTitle VII and Title IX are worded differently. If Congress\nwished Title IX to be interpreted like the earlier-enacted Title\nVII, Congress would have written Title IX to read like Title VII.\nCongress did not. Interpreting the plain language of different\nstatutes does not automatically produce the same result simply\nbecause both statutes proscribe similar behavior.\n\n     Second, Title VII was enacted under the far-reaching\nCommerce Clause and § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See\nE.E.O.C. v. Pacific Press Publ'g Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403389\"><a href=\"/opinion/403389/28-fair-emplpraccas-1596-29-empl-prac-dec-p-32817-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1279 n.10\n(9th Cir. 1982). Title IX was not, and consequently its reach is\nnarrower.\n\n     Third, the exposition of liability under Title VII depends\nupon agency principles. See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 72, 106 S. Ct.\nat 2408; Faragher, 111 F.3d at 1534 - 36. Agency principles are\nuseless in discussing liability for student-student harassment\nunder Title IX, because students are not agents of the school\nboard. See generally Restatement (Second) of Agency § 1 (1958)\n\n                               24\n\fhad sufficient notice, for purposes of the Spending Clause, that\n\nit could be held liable.   We disagree.14\n\n\n(defining an agency relationship as one in which the principal\nconsents to representation by the agent and the agent consents to\ncontrol by the principal). Therefore, even if employers owe to\nemployees some sort of nondelegable duty to eliminate peer\nharassment in the workplace, see generally id. § 492 (discussing\nemployers' duty to provide reasonably safe working conditions for\ntheir employees), schools owe to students no comparable duty. In\nshort, Title VII jurisprudence does not control the outcome of\nthis case.\n     14\n          We note that neither this court nor the Supreme Court\nin Franklin fully addressed the question of whether a student can\nstate a claim under Title IX for sexual harassment by a teacher -\n- much less whether a student can state a claim under Title IX\nfor sexual harassment by another student.\n\n     The defendant school board in Franklin successfully moved\nthe district court to dismiss Franklin's Title IX suit on the\nground that \"compensatory relief is unavailable for violations of\nTitle IX,\" a holding which this court affirmed.

The Supreme Court granted certiorari to\nconsider \"whether the implied right of action under Title IX . .\n. supports a claim for monetary damages.\" Franklin, 503 U.S. at\n62 - 63, 112 S. Ct. at 1031. The Court emphasized that \"the\nquestion of what remedies are available under a statute that\nprovides a private right of action is 'analytically distinct'\nfrom the issue of whether such a right exists in the first\nplace.\" Id. at 65 - 66, 112 S. Ct. at 1032. In fact, the\nFranklin Court rejected the arguments of the United States as\namicus curiae precisely because those arguments concerned the\nexistence vel non of a cause of action for teacher-student sexual\nharassment, a question which the Court considered \"irrelevant.\"\nId. at 69, 112 S. Ct. at 1034.\n\n     The Franklin Court discussed the   notice element of the\nSpending Clause solely to counter the   school board's argument\nthat \"the normal presumption in favor   of all appropriate remedies\nshould not apply because Title IX was   enacted pursuant to\n\n                                25\n\f       The terms of Title IX gave educational institutions notice\n\nthat they must prevent their employees from themselves engaging\n\nin intentional gender discrimination.      See Franklin, 503 U.S. at\n75, 112 S. Ct. at 1037.    Thus, school administrators cannot deny\n\nadmission to female applicants because of their gender.      See\n\nCannon, 441 U.S. at 709, 99 S. Ct. at 1964.      School\n\nadministrators cannot discriminate against teachers on account of\n\nsex.    See North Haven Bd. of Educ., 456 U.S. at 530, 102 S. Ct.\n\nat 1922 - 23.     Teachers cannot sexually harass their students.\n\nSee Franklin, 503 U.S. at 74 - 75, 112 S. Ct. at 1037.\n\n       The present complaint, however, does not allege that a\n\nschool employee discriminated against LaShonda in any of the\n\nforegoing ways.    The complaint does not allege, for example, that\n\nFort, Maples, Pippin, or Querry sexually harassed LaShonda.\n\nRather, the complaint alleges that these individuals failed to\n\ntake measures sufficient to prevent a non-employee from\n\ndiscriminating against LaShonda.       We do not think that the Board\n\nwas on notice when it accepted federal funding that it could be\n\nheld liable in this situation.\n\n\n\n                                  B.\n\nCongress' Spending Clause power.\" Id. at 74, 112 S. Ct. at 1037.\nViewed in this light, the Supreme Court's suggestion that\nteacher-student sexual harassment gives rise to a cause of action\nunder Title IX was arguably dicta. We assume that Franklin\ncreated a cause of action for teacher-student sexual harassment\nunder Title IX, but we are wary of extending this assumed holding\nto student-student sexual harassment. In any event, the Court's\ndiscussion of this issue does not foreclose our own consideration\nof whether appellant has stated a claim under Title IX.\n\n                                  26\n\f     First, as we have noted, nothing in the language or history\n\nof Title IX suggests that Title IX imposes liability for student-\n\nstudent sexual harassment.15   Second, the imposition of this form\n\nof liability would so materially affect schools' decisions\n\nwhether to accept Title IX funding that it would require an\n\nexpress, unequivocal disclosure by Congress.    Adopting\n\nappellant's theory of liability, however, could give rise to a\n\nform of “whipsaw” liability, under which public schools would\n\nface lawsuits from both the alleged harasser and the alleged\n\nvictim of the harassment.    Moreover, reasonable public school\n\nofficials could perceive the likely number of such suits to be\n\nlarge.    Because our endorsement of appellant's theory of\n\nliability would alter materially the terms of the contract\n\nbetween Congress and recipients of federal funding, appellant\n\nfails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\n     The essence of appellant's complaint is this:    once a public\n\nschool student complains to her teacher that a classmate has\n\nsexually harassed her, the teacher and the school board become\n\n     15\n          The dissent devotes a great deal of attention to\nwhether Congress intended that Title IX create a cause of action\nfor student-student sexual harassment. See Post, at *1 - *7. We\nseriously doubt whether Congress considered this problem at all\nwhen it enacted Title IX, but, in any case, the dissent's heavy\nreliance on its conclusory analysis of the language and history\nof Title IX is largely irrelevant. The question is not whether\nCongress intended to create a cause of action under Title IX for\nstudent-student sexual harassment but, rather, whether Congress\ngave school boards notice of this form of liability. In the\nabsence of any supporting legislative history, statutory\nconstruction of ambiguous language cannot support a finding of\nnotice as required by the Spending Clause.\n\n                                 27\n\fsubject to the threat of liability in money damages under federal\n\nlaw if they can prevent the classmate from harassing again and\n\nfail to do so.16   See, e.g., Bosley, 904 F. Supp. at 1023 (\"Once\n\na school district becomes aware of sexual harassment, it must\n\npromptly take remedial action which is reasonably calculated to\n\nend the harassment.\") (emphasis added).   In practical terms, this\n\nmeans that school officials would have to isolate an alleged\n\nharasser from other students through suspension or expulsion.\n\n     The complaint devotes little attention to what measures the\n\nBoard could have taken to avoid liability.   The complaint admits\n\nthat Querry and Fort tried to stop G.F.'s harassment by\n\nthreatening him and by separating him from LaShonda within Fort's\n\nclassroom.   Appellant clearly does not believe that these\n\nmeasures sufficed.   As evidence of \"deliberate indifference,\" the\n\ncomplaint also alleges that the Board failed to create a school\n\nsexual harassment policy.   It seems unlikely, however, that the\n\nmere existence of such a policy would foreclose liability under\n\nappellant's theory of the case.\n\n     Apparently, the appropriateness of the Board's remedial\n\nmeasures depends on whether the harassment actually ends.    The\n\ncomplaint suggests that G.F. should have been \"suspended, kept\n\n\n     16\n          Private schools that receive federal funding would also\nbe subject to suit under appellant’s theory of Title IX\nliability. Private school teachers and administrators, however,\nwould not ordinarily be subject to suit under § 1983, as would\ntheir public school counterparts, because they would not\nordinarily be acting under color of state law. See § 1983; see\ngenerally supra, n.2. Accordingly, we discuss individual\nliability only with respect to public school employees.\n\n                                  28\n\faway from LaShonda, or disciplined in [some] way\" after LaShonda\n\ncomplained.   The Department of Justice argues broadly that a\n\nschool board must take \"effective action\" in response to an\n\nallegation of harassment.   We take these arguments to mean the\n\nsame thing:   a school board must immediately isolate an alleged\n\nharasser from other students to avoid the threat of a lawsuit\n\nunder Title IX.\n\n     Physical separation of the alleged harasser from other\n\nstudents is the only way school boards can ensure that they\n\ncannot be held liable for future acts of harassment.   If a school\n\nofficial simply tells the alleged harasser, \"Don't do it again,\"\n\nand the harasser does it again, then the board becomes\n\nsusceptible to the argument that it had the power to end the\n\nharassment, but failed to do so out of \"deliberate indifference.\"\n\nIf the official merely transfers the alleged harasser to another\n\nclassroom, the board faces the threat of suit for any acts of\n\nharassment committed by him in the new classroom -- after all,\n\nthe school had notice of his dangerous propensities and did not\n\ndo all it could to prevent him from harassing his new classmates.\n\nSegregating the sexes into two separate programs within the same\n\nschool would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of Title IX.\n\nTherefore, in practical terms, to avoid the threat of Title IX\n\nliability under appellant's theory of the case, a school must\n\nimmediately suspend or expel a student accused of sexual\n\n\n\n\n                                29\n\fharassment.17\n\n     Appellant's standard of liability therefore creates for\n\nschool boards and school officials a Hobson's choice:   On the one\n\nhand, if a student complains to a school official about sexual\n\nharassment, the official must suspend or expel the alleged\n\nharasser or the board will face potential liability to the\n\nvictim.   Moreover, if a public school official with control over\n\nthe harasser finds out about his misconduct and fails to isolate\n\nhim, that official runs the risk of personal liability under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 for depriving the victim of her Title IX rights if\n\nthe harasser engages in further abuse.18   See Nicole M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">193919</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13; Oona R.-S., 890 F.

He chides us for suggesting that \"[a]ll federal, state,\nor local officials called upon to decide what to do in response\nto one person's complaint about another would have a financial\nincentive to avoid a lawsuit, which would disqualify them from\nmaking a decision.\" Post, at *4. We suggest nothing of the\nkind.\n\n     Nevertheless, on the merits of his critique, we suppose that\nall officials in such situations could face lawsuits alleging\nimpermissible bias -- if none of those officials had any form of\nimmunity from suit, which, of course, they do have. Stated\ndifferently, public decisionmakers have immunity from suit to\nprotect them from the sort of bias which might otherwise give\nrise to violations of the Due Process Clause. Judges, for\nexample, have absolute immunity from suit because \"the\nindependent and impartial exercise of judgment vital to the\njudiciary might be impaired by exposure to potential damages\nliability.\" Antoine v.

The litigation we describe would inevitably involve\n\n\n\n     In sum, we create no new procedural due process rights, as\nJUDGE CARNES asserts. Our opinion does not even suggest that we\nwould have to create such rights if we were to uphold appellant's\ntheory of Title IX liability. Rather, our opinion states that\nthis form of liability is a logical extension of appellant's\ntheory of the case, and Congress gave no notice to public school\nboards that they would be potentially undertaking this form of\nliability when they accepted federal funding under Title IX.\n     22\n          All of the foregoing assumes, of course, that the\nallegations of harassment are true. While we hesitate to assume\nthat any allegations of student-student sexual harassment are\nfalse, we do not doubt that school students will be tempted into\nmischief by the prospect of swift punishment against any\nclassmate whom they accuse of sexual harassment.\n\n     Moreover, public school officials would find such false\naccusations difficult to combat. Under Title VII standards of\nliability, which the appellant, the United States, and the\ndissent seem anxious to adopt, an employer may be sued for\nretaliating against an employee who complains about sexual\nharassment. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (1994) (\"It\nshall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to\ndiscriminate against any individual . . . because he has made a\ncharge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\").\nThus, under the logical implications of appellants theory of\nTitle IX liability, a school board could face a lawsuit from the\ncomplaining student if it disciplines her for bringing a\nvexatious complaint against a classmate. As discussed in the\ntext, the threat of lawsuits under § 1983 against the public\nschool officials themselves would soon follow.\n\n                                34\n\fteachers, students, and administrators in time-consuming\n\ndiscovery and trial preparation.    Schools could reasonably expect\n\nto receive from Congress explicit notice of these consequences.\n\nThey did not.23\n\n     23\n          Appellant and the Department of Justice draw our\nattention to the regulatory activities of the Office of Civil\nRights of the United States Department of Justice (\"OCR\"). The\nOCR issued interim guidelines concerning schoolhouse sexual\nharassment on August 16, 1996. See Sexual Harassment Guidance:\nPeer Sexual Harassment, 61 Fed. Reg. 42,728 (1996). These\nguidelines issued after the alleged harassment of LaShonda.\nMoreover, at the time of the alleged harassment, the code of\nfederal regulations did not discuss student-student sexual\nharassment. See 34 C.F.R. § 106.31 (1992). Therefore, OCR's\nregulations did not put the Board on official notice of its\npotential liability for G.F.'s harassment of LaShonda.\n\n     Nevertheless, appellant and the Department of Justice urge\nthat we defer to the OCR's current interpretation of Title IX for\npurposes of this case. The OCR issued final policy guidance on\nstudent sexual harassment on March 13, 1997. See Sexual\nHarassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees,\nOther Students, or Third Parties, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,034 (1997). In\nthis publication, the OCR constructs a labyrinth of factors and\ncaveats which simply reinforces our conclusion that the Board was\nnot on notice that it could be held liable in the present\nsituation.\n\n     According to the March 13 guidance, schools are liable for\nfailing to eliminate\n\n     sexually harassing conduct (which can include unwelcome\n     sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other\n     verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual\n     nature) . . . by another student . . . that is\n     sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit\n     a student's ability to participate in or benefit from\n     an education program or activity, or to create a\n     hostile or abusive educational environment.\n\nId. at 12,038.\n     Because the meaning of this language may not be obvious to\nschool officials, the March 13 guidance lists several factors\nwhich should be taken into account when a student is sent to the\noffice for sexually harassing another student. Among other\nfactors and subfactors, the school official should consider the\n\n                               35\n\f                               C.\n\n\n\n     School boards could reasonably believe that this form of\n\nwhipsaw liability would arise in a substantial number of cases.\n\nAccording to a 1993 survey of American public school students,\n\n65% of students in grades eight to eleven were victims of\n\n\n\n\"welcomeness\" of the conduct, the age of the harasser, the age of\nthe victim, the relationship between the parties, the degree to\nwhich the conduct was sexual in nature, the duration of the\nconduct, the frequency of the conduct involved, the degree to\nwhich the conduct affected the victim's education, the\npervasiveness of the conduct at the school, the location of the\nincident, the occurrence of any similar incidents at the school,\nthe occurrence of any incidents of gender-based but non-sexual\nharassment, the size of the school, and the number of individuals\ninvolved in the incident.\n\n     The school official should keep in mind that \"in some\ncircumstances, nonsexual conduct may take on sexual connotations\nand may rise to the level of sexual harassment.\" Id. at 12,039.\nHe should also remember that \"a hostile environment may exist\neven if there is no tangible injury to the student,\" and even if\nthe complaining student was not the target of the harassment.\nId. at 12,041. In addition, the official must recall that a\nsingle act of student-student harassment can create a hostile\nenvironment. See id. Finally, the school official must keep in\nmind that, if he does not kick the alleged harasser out of\nschool, and the harasser misbehaves again, the official could be\npersonally liable if a jury concludes, after the fact, that he\ncould have done more to prevent the harasser from harming his\nclassmates.\n\n     The foregoing analysis assumes, of course, that the school\nofficial actually knew of the complaint against the harasser and\nsummoned him to the front office. According to the OCR, however,\nthe official may be liable even if he did not know about the\nharassment: the official may cause the school to violate Title\nIX if he failed to exercise \"due care\" in discovering the\nmisconduct. See id. at 12,042. The foregoing does not address\nthe lawsuit that the harasser's parents will file when the school\nofficial summarily suspends him. According to appellant and the\nDepartment of Justice, the Board received clear notice of this\nform of liability when it accepted federal funding under Title\nIX. We think not.\n\n                               36\n\fstudent-student sexual harassment.     See American Ass'n of Univ.\n\nWomen Educ. Found., Hostile Hallways:     The AAUW Survey on Sexual\n\nHarassment in American Schools 11 (1993) [hereinafter AAUW\n\nSurvey].   Extrapolating from Department of Education statistics,\n\nroughly 7,784,000 public school students in grades eight through\n\neleven would consider themselves to be victims of student-student\n\nsexual harassment.24   Furthermore, 59% of students (including 52%\n\nof female students) in grades eight to eleven responded that they\n\nhad sexually harassed other students.     See AAUW Survey, supra, at\n\n11 - 12.   Thus, if this survey is accurate, around 7,177,000\n\npublic school students in grades eight to eleven, male and\n\nfemale, would admit to sexually harassing other students.\n\n     We do not adopt these statistics as our own definitive guide\n\nto the extent of sexual harassment in America’s public schools.\n\nWe draw attention to these figures only to illustrate what school\n\nboards would have to consider in deciding whether to accept\n\nfederal funding under Title IX.    The AAUW Survey could suggest to\n\nreasonable public school officials that a substantial number of\n\nlawsuits will be brought under appellant’s theory of Title IX\n\n\n     24\n          To calculate the number of purported student victims of\nharassment in the nation, we multiplied the percentage of victims\nprovided by the AAUW Survey by the total number of students\nenrolled in public schools in grades eight to eleven during the\n1992-1993 school year. We obtained the enrollment statistics\nfrom the world-wide-web home page of the Department of Education.\nSee, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Educ., Enrollment in Public Elementary\nand Secondary Schools, by Grade: Fall 1980 to Fall 1994 (last\nmodified Mar. 1996) <http://nces01.ed.gov/nces/pubs/D96/\nD96T042.html> [hereinafter U.S. Education]. We used the same\nprocess to calculate the total number of professed student\nharassers in the nation.\n\n                                  37\n\fliability.    Therefore, imposition of this form of liability would\n\nmaterially affect their decision whether to accept federal\n\neducational funding.25\n     An enactment under the Spending Clause must read like a\n\nprospectus.   Just as a prospectus must unambiguously disclose all\n\nmaterial facts to a would-be purchaser, an enactment under the\n\nSpending Clause must unambiguously disclose to would-be\n\nrecipients all facts material to their decision to accept Title\n\nIX funding.   The threat of whipsaw liability in a substantial\n\nnumber of cases would materially affect a Title IX recipient's\n\ndecision to accept federal funding, yet Congress did not provide\n\nunambiguous notice of this type of liability in the language or\n\nhistory of that statute.   We will not alter retrospectively the\n\n\n     25\n          In JUDGE CARNES' separate opinion, he characterizes our\nuse of statistics as an attempt \"to establish that student-\nstudent sexual harassment is such a widespread and extensive\nproblem that a different holding of this case would impose\nmassive liability upon school officials and boards.\" Post, at\n*8. As we indicate in the text, this is not our objective at\nall. We cite these statistics because school boards may consider\nthem to be a valid indicator of the amount of litigation that\nthey will face. If a lawyer for the Monroe County School Board\nwere trying to advise the Board about the potential costs and\nbenefits of accepting federal funding, would it not matter to\nthat lawyer whether accepting federal funds would give rise to a\nfew lawsuits or thousands of lawsuits?\n\n     JUDGE CARNES suggests that the AAUW Survey overstates the\nactual number of lawsuits that could be brought under appellant's\ntheory of Title IX liability. We agree that the survey did not\nuse the same definition of student-student sexual harassment as\nour case law dictates, but statistical purity would arguably\nrequire a jury verdict agreeing with the allegations of each\nstudent who claimed to have been harassed. In any event, there\nare plenty of reasons for public school officials to overlook the\nstatistical flaws in the AAUW Survey when it is their own\npocketbooks -- not those of federal judges -- that are at stake.\n\n                                 38\n\fterms of the agreement between Congress and recipients of Title\n\nIX funding.26\n\n\n\n                               IV.\n\n\n\n     We condemn the harm that has befallen LaShonda, a harm for\n\n\n\n     26\n          As noted above, the purpose of enactments under the\nSpending Clause is \"to further [Congress's] broad policy\nobjectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon\ncompliance by the recipient with federal statutory and\nadministrative directives.\" Fullilove v.

Congress uses the spending power \"to induce\ngovernments and private parties to cooperate voluntarily with\nfederal policy.\" Id. If no one chooses to receive federal funds\nunder a proposed legislative program, Congress's intent would be\nfrustrated and its policy objectives would remain unfulfilled.\nSee Rowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013.\n\n     Prospective recipients will decline federal funding and\ncurrent recipients will withdraw from federal programs if the\ncost of legislative conditions exceeds the amount of the\ndisbursement. Federal funding represents only 7% of all revenues\nfor public elementary and secondary schools in the United States.\nDuring the 1992-1993 school year, for example, American schools\nreceived $17,261,252,000 from the federal government out of a\ntotal budget of $247,626,168,000. See U.S. Education, supra, at\n<D96T157.html>.\n\n     School authorities must weigh the benefit of this relatively\nsmall amount of funding against not only the threat of\nsubstantial institutional and individual liability -- as\nsuggested by the AAUW Survey -- but also the opportunity costs of\ndevoting to litigation hours that might otherwise be spent\nrunning their schools. Because harassment of the sort\nexperienced by LaShonda is rarely observed directly by school\nofficials, Title IX claims of the sort envisioned by appellant\nwould require the time-consuming testimony of numerous student\nwitnesses. Imposing the liability of the sort envisioned by\nappellant could induce school boards to simply reject federal\nfunding -- in contravention of the will of Congress. See\nRowinsky, 80 F.3d at 1013.\n\n\n                               39\n\fwhich Georgia tort law may indeed provide redress.    Appellant's\n\npresent complaint, however, fails to state a claim under Title IX\n\nbecause Congress gave no clear notice to schools and teachers\n\nthat they, rather than society as a whole, would accept\n\nresponsibility for remedying student-student sexual harassment\n\nwhen they chose to accept federal financial assistance under\n\nTitle IX.    Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\nCircuit Judges EDMONDSON, COX, BIRCH, DUBINA, BLACK and CARNES\n\nconcur in the court’s opinion with the exception of Parts III.B\n\nand III.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                 40\n\f</pre>",
