(“Tenneco”), in\nan action seeking contribution toward environmental\ncleanup costs. These costs have been or will be incurred by\nplaintiff-appellant Morton International, Inc. (“Morton”) in\nregard to the Ventron/Velsicol Superfund Site in Wood\nRidge, New Jersey (the “Site” or “plant”). Morton and three\nother plaintiffs, who are not parties to this appeal, sought\ncontribution under the Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980\n(“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq., the New Jersey Spill\nCompensation and Control Act (“Spill Act”), N.J.S.A. 58:10-\n23.11 et seq., and common law.\n  Morton argues that Tenneco should be responsible,\nunder the “arranged for” provision of CERCLA Section\n107(a)(3), for some of the cleanup costs because it arranged\nfor the processing of mercury at the facility for many years,\nresulting in the release of hazardous waste into the\nenvironment. Because we agree with Morton that material\nfactual issues remain with respect to whether Tenneco (1)\nowned or possessed prime virgin mercury, (2) had\nknowledge of the environmental hazards of mercury\nprocessing at the plant, (3) had control over the hazardous\nwaste disposal practices at the plant, and (4) shipped its\nown “dirty mercury” to the plant, we will remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                      I.    Background\n\n                           A.   Factual\n  The parties dispute many of the facts central to this\nappeal, but the following facts are undisputed. From 1929\nto 1974, a mercury processing plant was operated at the\nSite. The plant was the largest domestic producer of\nintermediate inorganic mercury compounds, including red\n\f                              6\n\n\nand yellow oxides of mercury (“ROM” and “YOM”). The\ncompounds were formulated, at least in part, using prime\nvirgin mercury (“PVM”). In addition, the plant cleaned\nmercury that had been contaminated (“dirty mercury”) and\nthen converted it into intermediate compounds for some of\nits customers. The plant released harmful waste into the\nenvironment for decades.\n  The plant was owned by F.W. Berk & Company from\n1929 to 1960. It was transferred to Wood Ridge Chemical\nCorporation (its parent company is Velsicol Chemical\nCorporation) in 1960, and then again to Ventron\nCorporation in 1968. The plant was closed in 1974.\nSometime thereafter, Ventron merged into Thiokol, which\nthen merged into Morton-Thiokol, which eventually became\nMorton.\n   The parties agree that Tenneco purchased ROM and YOM\nfrom the plant from 1963 until the early 1970’s. The parties\ndisagree, however, as to the nature of the transactions\nbetween Tenneco and the plant, Tenneco’s knowledge of\nwaste disposal by the plant, and whether Tenneco shipped\n“dirty mercury” to the plant for processing.\n\n                    B.   Prior Litigation\n   In the 1970’s, the New Jersey Department of\nEnvironmental Protection commenced an action against\nVentron, Velsicol, and other parties for cleanup and\nremoval of mercury at the Site. Eventually, Velsicol and\nMorton were held strictly liable, jointly and severally, for\nthe cleanup of the Site, and that judgment was upheld\nfollowing numerous appeals and successive litigation. See\nMorton International, Inc. v. General Acc. Ins. Co. of America,\n629 A.2d 831, 880 (N.J. 1993) (concluding that Morton’s\npredecessors had intentionally discharged pollutants over a\nlong period of time); State Department of Environmental\nProtection v. Ventron Corp., 468 A.2d 150, 161-62 (N.J.\n1983) (finding defendants violated statute prohibiting the\ndischarge of detrimental material into waters by\nintentionally permitting mercury-laden effluent to escape\nonto lands surrounding creek). After the enactment of\nCERCLA in 1980, and the listing of the Site on the National\n\f                                   7\n\n\nPriorities List, Morton, as the current owner of the Site,\nVelsicol, and various other entities were required to perform\na remedial investigation/feasibility study for the Site. Since\nthen, Morton has been funding the environmental efforts\nunder various judicial orders.\n\n                   C.   The present litigation\n   Morton filed this action in 1996 seeking contribution\nfrom Tenneco and numerous other defendants under\nCERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq., the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), Pub. L. No. 94-\n580, § 1, 90 Stat. 2795 (1976), as amended 42 U.S.C.\n§ 6901 et seq., the Spill Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq.,\nand common law.1 Morton argues that the “conversion” or\n“toll” agreements, whereby the plant processed the\ncustomers’ PVM into ROM and YOM, and the “dirty\nmercury” processing agreements render the customer-\ndefendants subject to CERCLA liability as “arrangers”\nunder Section 107(a)(3), 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(3). Morton is\ntrying to recover from other allegedly responsible parties\nsome of the costs it has incurred and will continue to incur\nto clean up the Site.\n  Tenneco and the other defendants refuse to share\nresponsibility for the cleanup costs. The defendants argue\nthat Morton’s characterization of the PVM transactions is\ninaccurate; these transactions were nothing more than\nstraight purchases of finished products (ROM and YOM),\nwhich do not expose them to CERCLA liability. On April 11,\n2000, Tenneco and the other defendants moved for\nsummary judgment in an omnibus motion. The District\nCourt denied their motion with respect to the CERCLA,\nSpill Act, and common law claims because of the varying,\ncomplex fact patterns and material factual disputes with\n\n1. Velsicol and its related entities were plaintiffs below, but have\nwithdrawn their appeal of the District Court’s order. Because they are no\nlonger parties to this appeal, we refer only to Morton’s pursuit of these\ncauses of action against the defendants.\n\f                                    8\n\n\nrespect to each defendant. The District Court granted the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss Morton’s RCRA claim.2\n   Several months later, Tenneco filed a renewed motion for\nsummary judgment — this time on its own behalf. Morton\nresponded by incorporating by reference the briefings and\nevidence it had submitted in response to the omnibus\nsummary judgment motion. After hearing oral argument on\nTenneco’s individual motion, the District Court ruled from\nthe bench and granted summary judgment to Tenneco on\nall claims.\n\n                          II.   Jurisdiction\n  The District Court had jurisdiction over Morton’s federal\nclaims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 42 U.S.C. § 9613.\nThe District Court exercised pendent jurisdiction over\nMorton’s state law claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. We\nhave jurisdiction to hear this appeal from the final order of\nthe District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.3\n\n                            III.   Analysis\n  The District Court has asked us to “definitively address”\nthe standard for “arranger liability” under CERCLA Section\n107(a)(3) in this Circuit in order to properly resolve\n\n2. The District Court’s grant of judgment to the defendants on Morton’s\nRCRA claim is not before us on appeal.\n3. The District Court granted the parties’ joint motion to certify the\ndismissal of Tenneco from this action as a final, appealable order\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). Although the District\nCourt’s July 17, 2001 order disposed of Morton’s claims only against\nTenneco, leaving in place the claims against the other defendants, the\nCourt entered a final judgment with respect to Tenneco because: (a)\nMorton’s claims against Tenneco are separable from the remaining\nclaims; (b) this Court will not be required to decide the same issues even\nif there are subsequent appeals by other defendants; (c) the standard for\n“arranger liability” under CERCLA has not been “definitively addressed”\nby this Court; (d) the prospects for final resolution of Morton’s claims\nwill be improved by a ruling on the standard; and (e) certification of the\njudgment in favor of Tenneco will not prejudice the remaining\ndefendants. (App. at 4-5).\n\f                                     9\n\n\nMorton’s contribution claims against Tenneco and the other\ndefendants in this case.4\n\n         A.   CERCLA “Arranger Liability” Standard\n  Congress enacted CERCLA in 1980 “in response to the\nserious environmental and health risks posed by industrial\npollution.” United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 55\n(1998) (citation omitted).\n     As its name implies, CERCLA is a comprehensive\n     statute that grants the President broad power to\n     command government agencies and private parties to\n     clean up hazardous waste sites. Sections 104 and 106\n     provide the framework for federal abatement and\n     enforcement actions that the President, the EPA as his\n     delegated agent, or the Attorney General initiates. 42\n     U.S.C. § 9604, 9606. These actions typically require\n     private parties to incur substantial costs in removing\n     hazardous wastes and responding to hazardous\n     conditions. Section 107 sets forth the scope of the\n     liabilities that may be imposed on private parties and\n     the defenses that they may assert. 42 U.S.C. § 9607.\nKey Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U.S. 809, 814 (1994).\nIn 1986, Congress amended CERCLA with the Superfund\nAmendments and Reauthorization Act (“SARA”) and\nincluded a provision — Section 113 — that expressly\ncreated a cause of action for contribution. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n4. We once came close to stating a standard for “arranger liability” under\nCERCLA. In FMC Corporation v. United States Dep’t of Commerce, No. 92-\n1945, 1993 WL 489133, at *11 (3d Cir. 1993), this Court adopted the\ntest for “arranger liability” articulated by the Eighth Circuit in United\nStates v. Aceto Agricultural Chems. Corp., 872 F.2d 1373, 1379-82 (8th\nCir. 1989). That decision was vacated, however, after the Court granted\nrehearing en banc. See FMC Corp., 10 F.3d 1003 (3d Cir. 1994). In the\nsuperseding en banc decision, the Court affirmed the district court’s\njudgment holding the government liable as an arranger without\ndiscussion because the Court was “equally divided on this point.” FMC.\nCorp., 29 F.3d 833, 846 (3d Cir. 1994). Accordingly, this Court has\nneither ruled on the validity of the Aceto test for “arranger liability,” nor\narticulated its own test up to this point. See United States v. Occidental\nChem. Corp., 200 F.3d 143, 145 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\f                             10\n\n\n§ 9613(f). “A principal goal of Section 113 was to ‘clarif[y]\nand confirm[ ] the right of a person held jointly and\nseverally liable under CERCLA to seek contribution from\nother potentially liable parties, when the person believes\nthat it has assumed a share of the cleanup or cost that\nmay be greater than its equitable share under the\ncircumstances.’ ” New Castle County v. Halliburton NUS\nCorp., 111 F.3d 1116, 1122 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting\nH.R.Rep. No. 99-253(I), at 79 (1985), reprinted in 1986\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2835, 2861; H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-962, at\n221 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3276, 3314).\n   Accordingly, CERCLA and SARA together create two legal\nactions by which parties that have incurred costs\nassociated with cleanups can recover some or all of those\ncosts: (1) Section 107 cost recovery actions; and (2) Section\n113 contribution actions. Section 113, the cause of action\nMorton is pursuing against Tenneco, provides that “[a]ny\nperson may seek contribution from any other person who is\nliable or potentially liable under [Section 107], during or\nfollowing any civil action under [Section 107]. . . .” 42\nU.S.C. § 9613(f)(1).\n  Section 107 defines those who are “potentially\nresponsible persons” (“PRP’s”) as: (1) the current owner or\noperator of a facility; (2) any person who owned or operated\nthe facility at the time of the disposal of any hazardous\nsubstances; (3) “any person who by contract, agreement, or\notherwise arranged for disposal or treatment . . . of\nhazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,\nby any other party . . . at any facility;” and (4) any person\nwho accepts or accepted hazardous substances for\ntransport to sites selected by such person, “from which\nthere is a release, or a threatened release which causes the\nincurrence of response costs . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a).\n  Congress did not define the term “arranged for” in the\nstatute. Thus, our interpretation of the term begins with\nthe plain meaning. To repeat, Section 107(a)(3) holds\nresponsible those who “by contract, agreement, or\notherwise arranged for” the disposal or treatment of\nhazardous substances. The verb “arrange” is defined (as\nrelevant to its usage in this section) as “to make\npreparations for.” See Webster’s Third New International\n\f                             11\n\n\nDictionary 120 (1993). The dictionary definition of “arrange”\ndoes not shed much light on the proper scope of liability\nunder this section. However, by including “or otherwise”\nafter “by contract [or] agreement,” Congress expanded the\nmeans by which a party could possibly “arrange for” the\ntreatment or disposal of hazardous substances in defining\nthis category of PRP. We think that this expansive list of\nmeans indicates that Congress intended this category of\nPRP to be broadly construed.\n   Our view that “arranged for” is to be broadly construed is\nconsistent with Congress’s overall purpose in enacting\nCERCLA. Two of the main purposes of CERCLA are “prompt\ncleanup of hazardous waste sites and imposition of all\ncleanup costs on the responsible party.” General Electric Co.\nv. Litton Ind. Auto. Sys., Inc., 920 F.2d 1415, 1422 (8th Cir.\n1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 937 (1991), abrogated on other\ngrounds, Key Tronic, 511 U.S. at 814, 819. In enacting\nCERCLA, Congress intended that “those actually\n‘responsible for any damage, environmental harm, or injury\nfrom chemical poisons [may be tagged with] the cost of their\nactions.’ ” Bestfoods, 524 U.S. at 55-56 (quotations and\ncitations omitted). “The remedy that Congress felt it needed\nin CERCLA is sweeping: everyone who is potentially\nresponsible for hazardous-waste contamination may be\nforced to contribute to the costs of cleanup.” Pennsylvania\nv. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 21 (1989) (plurality op. of\nBrennan, J.) (emphasis in original), overruled on other\ngrounds, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44\n(1996); see also Lansford-Coaldale Joint Water Auth. v.\nTonolli Corp., 4 F.3d 1209, 1221 (3d Cir. 1993).\nAccordingly, we interpret the term “arranger liability”\nbroadly in keeping with the plain meaning of Section\n107(a)(3) and the remedial statutory scheme of CERCLA.\n  Almost all of our sister circuit courts have adopted a\nstandard for “arranger liability,” but the standards adopted\nvary. See Geraghty and Miller, Inc. v. Conoco Inc., 234 F.3d\n917, 929 (5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 950 (2001);\nFreeman v. Glaxo Wellcome, Inc., 189 F.3d 160, 164 (2d Cir.\n1999); Pneumo Abex Corp. v. High Point, Thomasville and\nDenton R.R. Co., 142 F.3d 769, 775 (4th Cir. 1998); United\nStates v. Cello-Foil Products, Inc., 100 F.3d 1227, 1231-32\n\f                               12\n\n\n(6th Cir. 1996); South Florida Water Management District v.\nMontalvo, 84 F.3d 402, 407 (11th Cir. 1996); Amcast\nIndustrial Corporation v. Detrex Corp., 2 F.3d 746, 751 (7th\nCir. 1993); Jones-Hamilton Co. v. Beazer Materials & Servs.,\nInc., 973 F.2d 688, 695 (9th Cir. 1992); United States v.\nAceto Agricultural Chems. Corp., 872 F.2d 1373, 1381-82\n(8th Cir. 1989).\n  Our review of these decisions leads us to conclude that\nthe courts are virtually unanimous with respect to two\npoints. First, the determination of “arranger liability” is a\nfact-sensitive inquiry that requires a multi-factor analysis.\nSecond, courts must look beyond the defendant’s\ncharacterization of the transaction at issue in order to\ndetermine whether the transaction, in fact, involves an\narrangement for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous\nsubstance. We absolutely agree with both of these points.\n   However, there is not as much agreement among our\nsister circuits as to which factors must be considered — or\nwhat priority they should receive — in conducting the\nmulti-factor “arranger liability” analysis. In fact, some\ncourts require a showing of intent to dispose of or treat\nhazardous substances, see Cello-Foil, 100 F.3d at 1232 (“in\nthe absence of a contract or agreement, a court must look\nto the totality of the circumstances, including any\n‘affirmative acts to dispose,’ to determine whether the\nDefendants intended to enter into an arrangement for\ndisposal. . . . [A] party can be responsible for ‘arranging for’\ndisposal, even when it has no control over the process\nleading to the release of substances.”); Amcast, 2 F.3d at\n751 (“arranged for” . . . “impl[ies] intentional action.”); while\nothers require only a demonstration of control and/or\nownership over the hazardous substances that are being\ndisposed of or treated. See, e.g., Aceto, 872 F.2d at 1380\n(rejecting reading of Section 107(a)(3) that requires proof\nthat defendant intended to dispose of a waste, and focusing\non defendant’s ownership of raw materials and control over\nformulation process).\n  There has been some disagreement, too, as to whether\nownership or control over the material being processed is\nthe more critical factor in the “arranger liability” analysis.\nC.f. United States v. Hercules, 247 F.3d 706, 720 (8th Cir.\n\f                                    13\n\n\n2001) (implying that ownership without control would\nsuffice and stating that “[c]ontrol . . . is not a necessary\nfactor”) and Jones-Hamilton, 973 F.2d at 695 (liability based\non ownership without control); with United States v. Shell\nOil Co., 294 F.3d 1045, 1055-56 (9th Cir. 2002) (proof of\nownership not required because actual control is the\n“crucial element”).\n   After carefully examining the language of the statute and\nconsidering the standards adopted by other courts, we\nconclude that the most important factors in determining\n“arranger liability” are: (1) ownership or possession; and (2)\nknowledge; or (3) control. Ownership or possession of the\nhazardous substance must be demonstrated, but this factor\nalone will not suffice to establish liability. A plaintiff must\nalso demonstrate either control over the process that\nresults in a release of hazardous waste or knowledge that\nsuch a release will occur during the process.5 We note, too,\nthat in conducting this analysis a court should not lose\nsight of the ultimate purpose of Section 113, which is to\ndetermine whether a defendant was sufficiently responsible\nfor hazardous-waste contamination so that it can fairly be\nforced to contribute to the costs of cleanup.\n\n5. We do not mean to suggest that no other factors would be relevant to\nthis analysis. In Concrete Sales and Services, Inc. v. Blue Bird Body Co.,\nthe court compiled a comprehensive list of factors that courts have\nconsidered in discussing “arranger liability,” including: “(1) whether a\nsale involved the transfer of a ‘useful’ or ‘waste’ product; (2) whether the\nparty intended to dispose of a substance at the time of the transaction;\n(3) whether the party made the ‘crucial decision’ to place hazardous\nsubstances in the hands of a particular facility; (4) whether the party\nhad knowledge of the disposal; and (5) whether the party owned the\nhazardous substances.” 211 F.3d 1333, 1336-37 (11th Cir. 2000). See\nalso State of New York v. Solvent Chem. Co., 225 F. Supp. 2d 270, 280-\n81 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (compiling list of factors considered by other courts).\nDepending on the particular circumstances of a case, any of these\nfactors, and quite possibly others not mentioned here, could be helpful\nin determining whether the defendant was sufficiently responsible for\nhazardous-waste contamination so that it can fairly be forced to\ncontribute to the costs of cleanup. We think, though, that the factors we\nhave identified — ownership or possession, knowledge, and control —\nare closely related to most or all of the other factors identified.\n\f                              14\n\n\n   We believe that ownership or possession, knowledge, and\ncontrol are the most critical factors in this analysis for the\nfollowing reasons. First, proof of ownership, or at least\npossession, of the hazardous substance is required by the\nplain language of the statute. See 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(3)\n(“any person who . . . arranged for disposal or treatment\n. . . of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such\nperson . . . .) (emphasis added). This required factor is the\nstarting point in determining “arranger liability” because, of\ncourse, with ownership comes responsibility. See Aceto, 872\nF.2d at 1382 (imposing “arranger liability” upon defendant\nthat owned hazardous substance throughout formulation\nprocess because finding otherwise “would allow defendants\nto simply ‘close their eyes’ to the method of disposal of their\nhazardous substances”).\n   As we said above, though, we do not think that proof of\nownership or possession alone is a sufficient basis upon\nwhich to ground “arranger liability.” A rule stating that this\nfactor alone would suffice could broaden the sweep of\nSection 107(a)(3) beyond the bounds of fairness. If, for\nexample, a defendant arranges for a plant to treat a\nhazardous substance that it owns or possesses, but has\nabsolutely no control over the processing and no knowledge\n(or even reason to know) that the processing will result in\nthe release of hazardous waste, it would be unfair to\nrequire that defendant to contribute to the cost of cleanup.\nImposing liability on the defendant under those\ncircumstances would go beyond Congress’s intent to\nrequire those “actually responsible for any damage,\nenvironmental harm, or injury from chemical poisons” to\nshare in the cost of cleanup. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. at 55-56\n(citations omitted).\n   Second, proof of a defendant’s knowledge that hazardous\nwaste can or will be released in the course of the process\nit has arranged for, provides a good reason to hold a\ndefendant responsible because such proof demonstrates\nthat the defendant knowingly (if not personally) contributed\nto the hazardous-waste contamination. Thus, general\nknowledge that waste disposal is an inherent or inevitable\npart of the process arranged for by the defendant may\nsuffice to establish liability. See Aceto, 872 F.2d at 1384.\n\f                                    15\n\n\nThis factor can be satisfied by proof of either actual\nknowledge (e.g., a provision in an agreement estimating the\namount of environmentally harmful spillage inherent in the\nprocessing of the defendant’s materials), or presumed\nknowledge (e.g., the defendant is familiar with industry\ncustom, which is that the processing of the particular\nmaterial normally results in the release of harmful wastes).\nSee Cello-Foil Products, 100 F.3d at 1231 (concluding that\n“intent need not be proven by direct evidence, but can be\ninferred from the totality of the circumstances” when\nevaluating “arranger liability”); Montalvo, 84 F.3d at 409\n(indicating that inference that defendants had knowledge\nthat arranged for activity would entail spilling of pesticides\nand draining of contaminated rinse water would expose\ndefendants to “arranger liability”).6\n  And third, proof that the defendant had control over the\nprocess could establish that the defendant was responsible\nfor the resulting release of hazardous wastes. C.f. Shell Oil,\n294 F.3d at 1055, 1057 (suggesting that “actual control”\nrather than simply “authority to control” must be shown);\nGeneral Elec. Co. v. AAMCO Trans., Inc., 962 F.2d 281, 286-\n87 (2d Cir. 1992) (implying that obligation to exercise\ncontrol alone satisfies “arranger liability” standard). In\nmany instances, proof of control could also create an\ninference that the defendant had knowledge that the\nprocess resulted in the release of hazardous wastes.\n\n6. In Shell Oil, the Ninth Circuit distinguishes between “Direct Arranger\nLiability” and “Broader Arranger Liability.” 294 F.3d at 1054-55. The\ncourt describes the former as involving a transaction in which the “ ‘sole\npurpose . . . is to arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous\nwastes.’ ” Id. at 1054 (citation omitted). In other words, “[a] direct\narranger must have direct involvement in arrangements for the disposal\nof waste.” Id. at 1055. The scienter required for “Direct Arranger\nLiability” appears to be specific intent or at least specific knowledge of\nthe waste disposal. Either level of scienter is higher than the general\nknowledge level that we require. Logically, though, if a plaintiff can prove\nthat a defendant had specific knowledge or specific intent, the plaintiff\ncan also prove the defendant had general knowledge. Accordingly, we see\nno reason to draw a distinction between direct and broad (or indirect)\n“arranger liability.” After all, there is only one category of “arranger\nliability” under Section 107(a). We believe that only one set of factors is\nrequired to analyze it.\n\f                               16\n\n\nAccordingly,    we   see   these    two   factors   as   somewhat\ninterrelated.\n   In sum, we conclude that the analysis of “arranger\nliability” under Section 107(a)(3) should focus on these\nprincipal factors: (1) ownership or possession of a material\nby the defendant; and (2) the defendant’s knowledge that\nthe processing of that material can or will result in the\nrelease of hazardous waste; or (3) the defendant’s control\nover the production process. A plaintiff is required to\ndemonstrate ownership or possession, but liability cannot\nbe imposed on that basis alone. A plaintiff is also required\nto demonstrate either knowledge or control. We identify\nthese principal factors to establish the base-line for\nanalysis of “arranger liability” in this Circuit. It is certainly\npossible that other factors could be relevant to this analysis\nin a given case, and we encourage consideration of those as\nwell.\n\nB.   Disputed Material Facts With Respect to Morton’s\n                   CERCLA Claims\n  Tenneco concedes that mercury is a hazardous substance\nand that there was a release from the plant which has\ncaused Morton to incur response costs. Morton asserts that\nTenneco is liable because of two different types of\ntransactions — those involving PVM and those involving\n“dirty mercury” — both of which comprise an arrangement\nfor the disposal of a hazardous substance under Section\n107(a)(3). The District Court found, however, that there was\ninsufficient evidence supporting Morton’s claims to survive\nTenneco’s summary judgment motion. We will review each\nof Morton’s claims under the “arranger liability” standard\narticulated above to determine if the District Court correctly\ngranted judgment to Tenneco.\n  Our standard of review applicable to an order granting\nsummary judgment is plenary. See Curley v. Klem, 298\nF.3d 271, 276-77 (3d Cir. 2002). We apply the same test\nemployed by the District Court under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 56(c). See Kelley v. TYK Refractories Co., 860\nF.2d 1188, 1192 (3d Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the District\nCourt’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Tenneco was\n\f                              17\n\n\nproper only if it appears that “there is no genuine issue as\nto any material fact and that [Tenneco] is entitled to a\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In\nevaluating the evidence, we “take the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party, [Morton], and draw all\nreasonable inferences in [its] favor.” Doe v. County of\nCentre, PA, 242 F.3d 437, 446 (3d Cir. 2001) (citation\nomitted).\n\n                    1.   PVM Transactions\n  Morton alleges that Tenneco engaged in two types of “toll”\nor “conversion” transactions with the plant involving PVM,\nboth of which comprise arrangements for the disposal of\nhazardous substances owned by Tenneco under Section\n107(a)(3). Basically, Morton contends that Tenneco\npurchased the PVM either from the plant or some other\nsupplier and then paid a fee to the plant for the conversion\nof the PVM into ROM or YOM. In either case, Morton\nargues, Tenneco owned the PVM throughout the conversion\nprocess, and was aware that the conversion process\ninevitably resulted in the release of hazardous waste.\n\n               a.   Ownership or Possession\n   The District Court addressed the issue of ownership or\npossession, and found that “the record evidence shows”\nthat Tenneco did not own or possess the PVM that was\nprocessed at the plant. (App. at 12-13). The Court based its\nfinding on two conclusions. First, the Court reasoned that\nwhether Tenneco purchased the PVM through a broker or\nfrom the plant directly, the “ownership” alleged by Morton\nwas a bookkeeping function done solely for the purpose of\nminimizing the plant’s financial risk in the volatile mercury\nmarket. And second, the Court determined that there was\nnot a “showing that Tenneco was the necessary source of\nthe PVM,” or that “Tenneco was a manufacturer of PVM.”\nId. at 13.\n   We will look first at the District Court’s conclusion that\nthe “toll” or “conversion” transactions used by the plant\nwere solely for the purpose of minimizing the plant’s\nfinancial risk in the volatile mercury market. One problem\n\f                             18\n\n\nwith this conclusion is that it is an inference drawn in favor\nof Tenneco rather than Morton, the party opposing the\nmotion. Another problem is that the conclusion\ninappropriately resolves a material factual dispute.\n   Citing the plant brochure and the deposition testimony of\nseveral former plant managers, Morton explains that the\nplant customers, including Tenneco, had the option of\nsupplying their own PVM and storing it in the plant’s vault\nor purchasing it directly from the plant. If the customer\nchose the first option, the plant would charge for the\nprocessing of the PVM into ROM or YOM and for insuring\nthe mercury while it was stored at the plant, but the\ncustomer owned the mercury “at the beginning, middle,\nand end of the process.” (Morton Brief at 13) (citing App. at\n660, 881, 458). In fact, one plant manager testified that\nwhen customers supplied PVM for processing, the\ncustomers continued to hold title to it while it was at the\nplant. Id. (citing App. at 238-240). Morton asserts that\nTenneco was “a major conversion customer” from at least\n1963 to 1973, and that it supplied significant amounts of\nPVM to the plant for processing. (Morton Brief at 13-14)\n(citing, inter alia, numerous weekly Physical Inventories\nand weekly Customer Ownership Reports documenting the\nnumber of Tenneco-owned pounds of mercury stored at the\nplant and converted into ROM and YOM).\n   To be sure, Tenneco disputes Morton’s contention that it\nowned the PVM throughout the process. Tenneco contends\nthat the plant used certain billing methods (which look like\n“conversion” or “toll” agreements) “to protect itself from the\nprice volatility of the mercury market and the associated\nfinancial risk . . . .” (Tenneco Brief at 6). Tenneco also\nasserts that the PVM it allegedly owned was never\nsegregated or labeled as belonging to it at any point in the\nprocess. Id. at 21-22 (citing App. at 533-34). In fact,\nTenneco maintains that the customer-delivered PVM was\nnot the actual mercury used to manufacture that\ncustomer’s ROM and YOM because mercury is\nhomogeneous; instead the mercury was added to the\nplant’s inventory, like money in a bank. Id. at 22-23 (citing\nApp. at 635-38, 533-34, 472-73). (Thus, Tenneco’s\nownership of the PVM that was converted at the plant on\n\f                                      19\n\n\nTenneco’s behalf is very much in dispute. Morton has\nsubmitted evidence, including plant records and the\ntestimony of former plant managers, from which it is fair to\ninfer that Tenneco owned the PVM (regardless of whether it\npurchased it from the plant or a third party) throughout the\nconversion process. Proof of ownership, of course, is one of\nthe principal factors in the “arranger liability” analysis.\nTherefore, this evidence is sufficient to withstand Tenneco’s\nmotion for summary judgment.7\n\n                           b.    Knowledge\n  Although the District Court did not directly address the\nknowledge factor, it discussed evidence that is relevant. The\nCourt referred to a memorandum from the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) cited by Morton\nand concluded that the reference therein to Tenneco’s\ndisposal of mercury by-products was “just not enough”\nevidence to survive a motion for summary judgment. (App.\nat 14, 15).\n  Before    we    discuss       the    other   evidence   related    to\n\n7. Although we have already identified material disputed facts on the\nissue of ownership that warrant remand for further consideration, we\npause to consider Tenneco’s argument that because mercury is\nhomogenous, it could not have been owned by any particular customer\nthroughout the oxide processing at the plant. See supra. Tenneco’s own\nanalogy to money in a bank suffices to demonstrate the\nunreasonableness of its argument. When money is deposited in a bank\nthe depositor does not cease owning the money because the actual\ndollars and cents it deposited are fungible and are used by other\ncustomers. Whether the plant segregated each customer’s PVM or simply\nadded it all together is inconsequential. The ownership or possession\nfactor can be satisfied by proof that Tenneco owned or possessed the\namount of PVM that it paid to have processed into ROM and YOM. See\nApp. at 881 (Wood Ridge Chemical Corporation Balance Sheet and\nAuditor’s Report, stating: “Since mercury is homogeneous, it is not\npossible to physically identify owned from non-owned mercury, but\nrecords are maintained to account for customer-owned quantities.”). Like\nownership of money in a bank, Tenneco’s ownership of a mercury is not\nrefuted by proof that other customers used the exact PVM it initially\ndeposited. Cf. Hercules, 247 F.3d at 721 (finding defendant owned\nmaterial despite intermingling with other materials during processing).\n\f                              20\n\n\nknowledge that was submitted by Morton, we will address\nTenneco’s argument that the EPA memorandum should not\nbe considered because it is not part of the record. Morton’s\ncounsel read a portion of the 1971 EPA memorandum\nduring the summary judgment oral argument, but\nneglected to move its admission into the record. Id. at 80-\n81. Prior to filing its appellate brief, Morton moved the\nDistrict Court to supplement the record with, among other\nthings, the EPA memorandum. The motion was denied, and\nMorton has not appealed that decision. Because the\nmemorandum is not included in the certified record, even\nafter Morton’s motion to supplement the record, Tenneco\nargues that we should not consider it at all. Tenneco\nargues, too, that Morton’s counsel did not provide a copy of\nthe document to either the District Court or opposing\ncounsel. Morton asserts, however, that Tenneco produced\nthis document during discovery. And, because counsel read\nthe relevant portions of the memorandum into the record\nduring oral argument without objection from Tenneco and\nbecause the District Court referred to the memorandum in\nher ruling, the memorandum is part of the record.\n  According to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(a),\nthe record on appeal is comprised of (1) the original papers\nand exhibits filed in the district court; (2) the transcript of\nthe proceedings; and (3) a certified copy of the docket\nentries. “This definition not only includes items admitted\ninto evidence, but also includes items presented to the\ndistrict court and not admitted into evidence.” Waldorf v.\nShuta, 142 F.3d 601, 620 (3d Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).\n   Here, it is undisputed that the EPA memorandum was\nnever included in the record in its entirety. Given that the\nmemorandum does not appear to have been presented to\nthe District Court, we will not review it in its entirety (which\nis not possible as a practical matter in any event because\nthe document was not included in the appendices). See\nWaldorf, 142 F.3d at 620 (“The basic purpose behind the\nrule is to prevent parties from supplementing the record on\nappeal with items never presented to the district court.”)\nThe next question is whether we can appropriately consider\nthe portion of the memorandum that was read by Morton’s\ncounsel during oral argument and which is found in the\n\f                              21\n\n\ntranscript. Because we conclude that Morton presented\nevidence other than the portion of the EPA memorandum to\nestablish Tenneco’s knowledge, and because we think that\nevidence created disputed facts, we do not need to decide\nwhether it is appropriate for us to consider the\nmemorandum on appeal. We leave it to the District Court\nto evaluate the admissibility of the document on remand.\n  As we just mentioned, Morton presented evidence other\nthan the EPA memorandum to establish Tenneco’s\nknowledge that the release of hazardous waste was an\ninherent and inevitable aspect of mercury processing.\nSpecifically, Morton maintains that Tenneco was\nknowledgeable about mercury processing because it used\nROM and YOM to manufacture products at its own\nfacilities, and because it had produced mercury oxide at its\nElizabeth facility in the past. (Morton Brief at 7-8, 9) (citing\nApp. at 855). Morton contends that Tenneco must have\nbeen aware of the environmental risks inherent in mercury\nprocessing because “the hazards of handling and\nprocessing mercury were well known within the industry\ngenerally,” and because “substantial mercury loss, as well\nas known losses in dust and vapor, were an inherent part\nof manufacturing mercury intermediates,” and that those\nlosses were “closely monitored by the Plant and its\ncustomers who provided the mercury.” Id. at 9, 10 (citing\nApp. at 940, 942, 932-33, 796, 252-53).\n  Tenneco does not dispute that it used ROM and YOM to\nmanufacture its own products at its Elizabeth facility or\nthat it produced mercury oxide at the same facility in the\npast. (Tenneco Brief at 24, 27). Instead, Tenneco accuses\nMorton of improperly relying on general facts about the\nplant’s relationship with its customers rather than facts\nspecific to the plant’s relationship with Tenneco in\nattempting to prove Tenneco’s knowledge that waste was\nreleased during mercury processing.\n  We think it is fair to infer from Tenneco’s involvement\nwith mercury oxides at its own facility that Tenneco had\nsome knowledge about the environmental hazards of\nmercury processing. We also think it is fair to rely on\nevidence provided by Morton about the plant customers\ngenerally. While Morton did not present evidence showing\n\f                              22\n\n\nthat Tenneco, specifically, was monitoring the mercury\nlosses during processing at the plant, it was not required to\ndo so in order to survive Tenneco’s motion for summary\njudgment. After all, Tenneco was undisputably one of the\nplant customers, and it is thus reasonable to infer (absent\nproof to the contrary) that it had the same kind of\nrelationship with the plant as did the other customers.\nWhether a jury would ultimately be persuaded by this\nevidence is uncertain, but that is not the standard we apply\nin evaluating a summary judgment motion. Accordingly, we\nbelieve that there are disputed facts with respect to\nTenneco’s knowledge of hazardous waste releases during\nthe processing of PVM at the plant. Because knowledge is\none of the principal factors in the “arranger liability”\nanalysis, this evidence is sufficient to withstand Tenneco’s\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n                         c.   Control\n   The District Court did not directly discuss this factor.\nBut, related to control, the Court observed that it would not\nhave mattered if Tenneco had shipped PVM directly to the\nplant on a regular basis because “it is what happened [at\nthe plant] and [Tenneco’s] involvement . . . with respect to\nwhat happened [at the plant] that’s important.” (App. at\n12). We disagree with the Court’s suggestion that proof that\nTenneco shipped PVM directly to the plan would have been\nirrelevant. Such proof could demonstrate Tenneco’s\nownership, or at least possession, of the PVM. More\nimportantly, though, the parties dispute Tenneco’s level of\ncontrol over “what happened” at the plant.\n  Morton states that “customers such as Tenneco played a\nkey role in shaping the Plant’s production processes and its\nresulting emissions” by approving a new process for\nmercury oxide manufacturing in the late 1960’s. (Morton\nBrief at 11) (citing App. at 827-28, 923, 952, 953, 406-10).\nMorton argues that the customer’s approval of the\nproduction process amounted to some control over the\nproduction process. Tenneco, however, disputes Morton’s\nassertion that it had any control over the plant operations\nor disposal practices. (Tenneco Brief at 12-13) (citing App.\nat 504, 268, 340-42, 244-50).\n\f                             23\n\n\n   Again, Morton’s evidence about the customers generally\nis relevant — Tenneco was undisputably a customer of the\nplant. Whether this evidence alone is sufficient to establish\ncontrol is another matter. Because we are remanding this\ncase to be analyzed under the standard articulated above,\nwe suggest that the District Court consider this evidence in\nthe subsequent proceedings.\n\n                d.   Useful Product Defense\n  The District Court characterized the PVM transactions as\n“sales transactions” and referred to the “useful product\ndefense” discussed in Pneumo Abex Corp. v. High Point,\nThomasville and Denton R.R. Co., 142 F.3d 769, 774 (4th\nCir. 1998). (App. at 13-14). Tenneco argued below, and\ncontinues to argue on appeal, that this defense applies\nbecause the transactions at issue were nothing more than\na sale of a useful product (PVM) and a purchase of finished\nproducts (ROM and YOM). We believe that there are\ndisputed facts with respect to the critical elements of this\ndefense.‘’\n   In Pneumo Abex, the court concluded that “ ‘treatment\n. . . of hazardous substances’ as used in CERCLA refers to\na party arranging for the processing of discarded hazardous\nsubstances or processing resulting in the discard of\nhazardous substances.” 142 F.3d at 774. Accordingly, the\nsale of valuable materials to a processor alone does not\nsatisfy the requirements for “arranger liability.” See Glaxo\nWellcome, Inc., 189 F.3d at 164; Solvent Chemical Co., 225\nF. Supp. 2d at 280.\n   We agree with Tenneco that the sale of PVM alone or the\npurchase of ROM and YOM alone — without evidence of\nownership or possession, knowledge, and control — would\nnot be sufficient grounds on which to impose “arranger\nliability.” Those transactions would either not meet the\nstandard we have articulated or would fall within the\n“useful product defense.” It would be inappropriate at this\nstage in the proceedings, however, to conclude that the\ntransactions between Tenneco and the plant were nothing\nmore than a sale of PVM or the purchase of ROM and YOM\nbecause of the factual disputes we have described with\n\f                              24\n\n\nrespect to the key elements of ownership or possession,\nknowledge, and control.\n\n              2.   “Dirty Mercury” Transactions\n   Morton asserts that Tenneco shipped its own “dirty\nmercury” to the plant for processing into usable mercury, a\ntransaction which clearly qualifies Tenneco for “arranger\nliability.” (Morton Brief at 15). Morton contends that it\nsubmitted evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment\non this claim. Tenneco argues that Morton did not present\nthis claim to the District Court at all.\n   It is true that Morton did not include the “dirty mercury”\nallegation in its Statement of Contested Facts for the\nPretrial Order. (Supp. App. at 2-3). As a general matter, the\npretrial order will “control the subsequent course of the\naction unless modified by a subsequent order.” Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 16(e). Moreover, the “finality of the pretrial order\ncontributes substantially to the orderly and efficient trial of\na case.” Petree v. Victor Fluid Power, Inc., 831 F.2d 1191,\n1194 (3d Cir. 1987).\n  Nonetheless, “Rule 16 was not intended to function as an\ninflexible straightjacket on the conduct of litigation . . .\ninstead, it was intended to insure the efficient resolution of\ncases and, most importantly, minimize prejudicial\nsurprise.” Lamborn v. Dittmer, 873 F.2d 522, 527 (2d Cir.\n1989) (citations omitted). Accordingly, Morton argues that\nthe issue is properly addressed on appeal because it raised\nthe issue in its brief opposing Tenneco’s motion for\nsummary judgment.\n  In response to Tenneco’s individual motion for summary\njudgment, Morton incorporated its Statement of Material\nFacts from the earlier summary judgment proceeding\ninvolving all of the defendants. In paragraph 10 of that\nStatement of Material Facts, Morton makes allegations\nabout PVM and “dirty mercury” transactions against “The\nCustomers” generally without specifying any customer by\nname. (App. at 157). In paragraph 11, Morton asserts that\nthe    “evidence   confirming    these  transactions   is\noverwhelming” and cites numerous pages of deposition\ntestimony. Id. One of the cited portions of deposition\n\f                              25\n\n\ntestimony indicates that Tenneco shipped “dirty mercury”\nto the plant. Id. (deposition transcript of Joseph H.\nBernstein at 860).\n   The critical issue is whether Tenneco was on notice of\nMorton’s “dirty mercury” claim during the summary\njudgment proceedings despite the fact that the claim was\nnot included in the Pretrial Order. We find that Tenneco\nwas sufficiently aware of the claim. Tenneco was\npresumably put on notice of Morton’s allegation at the time\nof the Bernstein deposition given that Bernstein stated that\nhe believed that Tenneco shipped “dirty mercury” to the\nplant. If not at the time of the deposition, Tenneco was\nsurely on notice as of the time it received Morton’s\nStatement of Material Facts during the first summary\njudgment proceeding. Finally, Tenneco was put on notice of\nthis claim a third time when Morton incorporated its\nStatement of Material Facts into its response to Tenneco’s\nindividual motion for summary judgment. Thus, although\nMorton’s failure to include this claim in the Pretrial Order\nviolates the letter of Rule 16(e), our consideration of this\nclaim on appeal does not violate the purpose of the rule,\nwhich is primarily to “minimize prejudicial surprise.”\nLamborn, 873 F.2d at 527.\n  Assuming we would consider the “dirty mercury” claim,\nTenecco argues in the alternative that the District Court\nproperly granted summary judgment to Tenneco because,\nquite simply,“Morton has absolutely no evidence to support\nsuch a claim.” (Tenneco Brief at 57). We disagree.\n  Morton asserts that Tenneco shipped its own “dirty\nmercury” to the plant for processing into usable mercury.\n(Morton Brief at 15) (citing Bernstein Dep. at 40, 860).\nMorton maintains that the plant’s standard operating\nprocedure was to store “dirty mercury” in separate flasks\nlabeled with the customer’s name and date received and\nthen to purify the mercury by a furnace-operated\ndistillation process, which produced environmentally\nharmful residue. Id. (citing App. at 431-32, 443, 447, 461-\n63, 868-69, 954). Morton contends that customers were\napprised of the fact that “a certain percentage of mercury\nwould be lost in the process.” Id. (citing App. at 963-65,\n263). This evidence is sufficient to at least create a disputed\n\f                                26\n\n\nfact with respect to each of the principal “arranger liability”\nfactors — ownership or possession, knowledge, and control.\nTherefore, under the standard we have just articulated, this\nevidence suffices to survive summary judgment.\n\n           3.    Spill Act and Common Law Claims\n  The District Court did not discuss Morton’s Spill Act\nclaim or its common law contribution claim, but it\nnevertheless granted summary judgment to Tenneco on\nboth. Because the Spill Act is the “New Jersey analog to\nCERCLA,” the standards for liability are the same. See SC\nHoldings, Inc. v. A.A.A. Realty Co., 935 F. Supp. 1354, 1365\n(D.N.J. 1996); State of New Jersey v. Gloucester\nEnvironmental Management Servs., Inc., 821 F. Supp. 999,\n1009 (D.N.J. 1993). Therefore, we vacate the District\nCourt’s grant of summary judgment on the Spill Act claim\nfor the same reasons that we vacate judgment on the\nCERCLA claim. We conclude, however, that the District\nCourt’s grant of judgment to Tenneco on the common law\ncontribution claim was appropriate because that claim is\npreempted by CERCLA Section 113(f). See In the Matter of\nReading Co., 115 F.3d 1111, 1117 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding\nthat CERCLA Section 113(f) preempts common law\ncontribution claim).\n\n                       IV.   Conclusion\n  Because there are disputed material facts with respect to\nMorton’s CERCLA and Spill Act claims against Tenneco, we\nwill vacate the District Court’s grant of summary judgment\nand remand those claims for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion. Because Morton’s common law\ncontribution claim is preempted by CERCLA, we will affirm\nthe District Court’s grant of summary judgment to Tenneco.\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                     Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                                 for the Third Circuit\n\f",

(“Tenneco”), in\nan action seeking contribution toward environmental\ncleanup costs. These costs have been or will be incurred by\nplaintiff-appellant Morton International, Inc. (“Morton”) in\nregard to the Ventron/Velsicol Superfund Site in Wood\nRidge, New Jersey (the “Site” or “plant”). Morton and three\nother plaintiffs, who are not parties to this appeal, sought\ncontribution under the Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980\n(“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq., the New Jersey Spill\nCompensation and Control Act (“Spill Act”), N.J.S.A. 58:10-\n23.11 et seq., and common law.\n  Morton argues that Tenneco should be responsible,\nunder the “arranged for” provision of CERCLA Section\n107(a)(3), for some of the cleanup costs because it arranged\nfor the processing of mercury at the facility for many years,\nresulting in the release of hazardous waste into the\nenvironment. Because we agree with Morton that material\nfactual issues remain with respect to whether Tenneco (1)\nowned or possessed prime virgin mercury, (2) had\nknowledge of the environmental hazards of mercury\nprocessing at the plant, (3) had control over the hazardous\nwaste disposal practices at the plant, and (4) shipped its\nown “dirty mercury” to the plant, we will remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                      I.    Background\n\n                           A.   Factual\n  The parties dispute many of the facts central to this\nappeal, but the following facts are undisputed. From 1929\nto 1974, a mercury processing plant was operated at the\nSite. The plant was the largest domestic producer of\nintermediate inorganic mercury compounds, including red\n\f                              6\n\n\nand yellow oxides of mercury (“ROM” and “YOM”). The\ncompounds were formulated, at least in part, using prime\nvirgin mercury (“PVM”). In addition, the plant cleaned\nmercury that had been contaminated (“dirty mercury”) and\nthen converted it into intermediate compounds for some of\nits customers. The plant released harmful waste into the\nenvironment for decades.\n  The plant was owned by F.W. Berk & Company from\n1929 to 1960. It was transferred to Wood Ridge Chemical\nCorporation (its parent company is Velsicol Chemical\nCorporation) in 1960, and then again to Ventron\nCorporation in 1968. The plant was closed in 1974.\nSometime thereafter, Ventron merged into Thiokol, which\nthen merged into Morton-Thiokol, which eventually became\nMorton.\n   The parties agree that Tenneco purchased ROM and YOM\nfrom the plant from 1963 until the early 1970’s. The parties\ndisagree, however, as to the nature of the transactions\nbetween Tenneco and the plant, Tenneco’s knowledge of\nwaste disposal by the plant, and whether Tenneco shipped\n“dirty mercury” to the plant for processing.\n\n                    B.   Prior Litigation\n   In the 1970’s, the New Jersey Department of\nEnvironmental Protection commenced an action against\nVentron, Velsicol, and other parties for cleanup and\nremoval of mercury at the Site. Eventually, Velsicol and\nMorton were held strictly liable, jointly and severally, for\nthe cleanup of the Site, and that judgment was upheld\nfollowing numerous appeals and successive litigation.

After the enactment of\nCERCLA in 1980, and the listing of the Site on the National\n\f                                   7\n\n\nPriorities List, Morton, as the current owner of the Site,\nVelsicol, and various other entities were required to perform\na remedial investigation/feasibility study for the Site. Since\nthen, Morton has been funding the environmental efforts\nunder various judicial orders.\n\n                   C.   The present litigation\n   Morton filed this action in 1996 seeking contribution\nfrom Tenneco and numerous other defendants under\nCERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq., the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), Pub. L. No. 94-\n580, § 1, 90 Stat. 2795 (1976), as amended 42 U.S.C.\n§ 6901 et seq., the Spill Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq.,\nand common law.1 Morton argues that the “conversion” or\n“toll” agreements, whereby the plant processed the\ncustomers’ PVM into ROM and YOM, and the “dirty\nmercury” processing agreements render the customer-\ndefendants subject to CERCLA liability as “arrangers”\nunder Section 107(a)(3), 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(3). Morton is\ntrying to recover from other allegedly responsible parties\nsome of the costs it has incurred and will continue to incur\nto clean up the Site.\n  Tenneco and the other defendants refuse to share\nresponsibility for the cleanup costs. The defendants argue\nthat Morton’s characterization of the PVM transactions is\ninaccurate; these transactions were nothing more than\nstraight purchases of finished products (ROM and YOM),\nwhich do not expose them to CERCLA liability. On April 11,\n2000, Tenneco and the other defendants moved for\nsummary judgment in an omnibus motion. The District\nCourt denied their motion with respect to the CERCLA,\nSpill Act, and common law claims because of the varying,\ncomplex fact patterns and material factual disputes with\n\n1. Velsicol and its related entities were plaintiffs below, but have\nwithdrawn their appeal of the District Court’s order. Because they are no\nlonger parties to this appeal, we refer only to Morton’s pursuit of these\ncauses of action against the defendants.\n\f                                    8\n\n\nrespect to each defendant. The District Court granted the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss Morton’s RCRA claim.2\n   Several months later, Tenneco filed a renewed motion for\nsummary judgment — this time on its own behalf. Morton\nresponded by incorporating by reference the briefings and\nevidence it had submitted in response to the omnibus\nsummary judgment motion. After hearing oral argument on\nTenneco’s individual motion, the District Court ruled from\nthe bench and granted summary judgment to Tenneco on\nall claims.\n\n                          II.

Analysis\n  The District Court has asked us to “definitively address”\nthe standard for “arranger liability” under CERCLA Section\n107(a)(3) in this Circuit in order to properly resolve\n\n2. The District Court’s grant of judgment to the defendants on Morton’s\nRCRA claim is not before us on appeal.\n3. The District Court granted the parties’ joint motion to certify the\ndismissal of Tenneco from this action as a final, appealable order\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). Although the District\nCourt’s July 17, 2001 order disposed of Morton’s claims only against\nTenneco, leaving in place the claims against the other defendants, the\nCourt entered a final judgment with respect to Tenneco because: (a)\nMorton’s claims against Tenneco are separable from the remaining\nclaims; (b) this Court will not be required to decide the same issues even\nif there are subsequent appeals by other defendants; (c) the standard for\n“arranger liability” under CERCLA has not been “definitively addressed”\nby this Court; (d) the prospects for final resolution of Morton’s claims\nwill be improved by a ruling on the standard; and (e) certification of the\njudgment in favor of Tenneco will not prejudice the remaining\ndefendants.

Section 113, the cause of action\nMorton is pursuing against Tenneco, provides that “[a]ny\nperson may seek contribution from any other person who is\nliable or potentially liable under [Section 107], during or\nfollowing any civil action under [Section 107]. . . .” 42\nU.S.C. § 9613(f)(1).\n  Section 107 defines those who are “potentially\nresponsible persons” (“PRP’s”) as: (1) the current owner or\noperator of a facility; (2) any person who owned or operated\nthe facility at the time of the disposal of any hazardous\nsubstances; (3) “any person who by contract, agreement, or\notherwise arranged for disposal or treatment . . . of\nhazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,\nby any other party . . . at any facility;” and (4) any person\nwho accepts or accepted hazardous substances for\ntransport to sites selected by such person, “from which\nthere is a release, or a threatened release which causes the\nincurrence of response costs . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a).\n  Congress did not define the term “arranged for” in the\nstatute. Thus, our interpretation of the term begins with\nthe plain meaning. To repeat, Section 107(a)(3) holds\nresponsible those who “by contract, agreement, or\notherwise arranged for” the disposal or treatment of\nhazardous substances. The verb “arrange” is defined (as\nrelevant to its usage in this section) as “to make\npreparations for.” See Webster’s Third New International\n\f                             11\n\n\nDictionary 120 (1993). The dictionary definition of “arrange”\ndoes not shed much light on the proper scope of liability\nunder this section. However, by including “or otherwise”\nafter “by contract [or] agreement,” Congress expanded the\nmeans by which a party could possibly “arrange for” the\ntreatment or disposal of hazardous substances in defining\nthis category of PRP. We think that this expansive list of\nmeans indicates that Congress intended this category of\nPRP to be broadly construed.\n   Our view that “arranged for” is to be broadly construed is\nconsistent with Congress’s overall purpose in enacting\nCERCLA.

First, the determination of “arranger liability” is a\nfact-sensitive inquiry that requires a multi-factor analysis.\nSecond, courts must look beyond the defendant’s\ncharacterization of the transaction at issue in order to\ndetermine whether the transaction, in fact, involves an\narrangement for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous\nsubstance. We absolutely agree with both of these points.\n   However, there is not as much agreement among our\nsister circuits as to which factors must be considered — or\nwhat priority they should receive — in conducting the\nmulti-factor “arranger liability” analysis. In fact, some\ncourts require a showing of intent to dispose of or treat\nhazardous substances, see Cello-Foil, 100 F.3d at 1232 (“in\nthe absence of a contract or agreement, a court must look\nto the totality of the circumstances, including any\n‘affirmative acts to dispose,’ to determine whether the\nDefendants intended to enter into an arrangement for\ndisposal. . . . [A] party can be responsible for ‘arranging for’\ndisposal, even when it has no control over the process\nleading to the release of substances.”); Amcast, 2 F.3d at\n751 (“arranged for” . . . “impl[ies] intentional action.”); while\nothers require only a demonstration of control and/or\nownership over the hazardous substances that are being\ndisposed of or treated. See, e.g., Aceto, 872 F.2d at 1380\n(rejecting reading of Section 107(a)(3) that requires proof\nthat defendant intended to dispose of a waste, and focusing\non defendant’s ownership of raw materials and control over\nformulation process).\n  There has been some disagreement, too, as to whether\nownership or control over the material being processed is\nthe more critical factor in the “arranger liability” analysis.\nC.f.

Ownership or possession of the\nhazardous substance must be demonstrated, but this factor\nalone will not suffice to establish liability. A plaintiff must\nalso demonstrate either control over the process that\nresults in a release of hazardous waste or knowledge that\nsuch a release will occur during the process.5 We note, too,\nthat in conducting this analysis a court should not lose\nsight of the ultimate purpose of Section 113, which is to\ndetermine whether a defendant was sufficiently responsible\nfor hazardous-waste contamination so that it can fairly be\nforced to contribute to the costs of cleanup.\n\n5. We do not mean to suggest that no other factors would be relevant to\nthis analysis. In Concrete Sales and Services, Inc. v. Blue Bird Body Co.,\nthe court compiled a comprehensive list of factors that courts have\nconsidered in discussing “arranger liability,” including: “(1) whether a\nsale involved the transfer of a ‘useful’ or ‘waste’ product; (2) whether the\nparty intended to dispose of a substance at the time of the transaction;\n(3) whether the party made the ‘crucial decision’ to place hazardous\nsubstances in the hands of a particular facility; (4) whether the party\nhad knowledge of the disposal; and (5) whether the party owned the\nhazardous substances.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1336-37 (11th Cir. 2000). See\nalso State of New York v. Solvent Chem. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280-\n81 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (compiling list of factors considered by other courts).\nDepending on the particular circumstances of a case, any of these\nfactors, and quite possibly others not mentioned here, could be helpful\nin determining whether the defendant was sufficiently responsible for\nhazardous-waste contamination so that it can fairly be forced to\ncontribute to the costs of cleanup. We think, though, that the factors we\nhave identified — ownership or possession, knowledge, and control —\nare closely related to most or all of the other factors identified.\n\f                              14\n\n\n   We believe that ownership or possession, knowledge, and\ncontrol are the most critical factors in this analysis for the\nfollowing reasons. First, proof of ownership, or at least\npossession, of the hazardous substance is required by the\nplain language of the statute. See 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(3)\n(“any person who . . . arranged for disposal or treatment\n. . . of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such\nperson . . . .) (emphasis added). This required factor is the\nstarting point in determining “arranger liability” because, of\ncourse, with ownership comes responsibility. See Aceto, 872\nF.2d at 1382 (imposing “arranger liability” upon defendant\nthat owned hazardous substance throughout formulation\nprocess because finding otherwise “would allow defendants\nto simply ‘close their eyes’ to the method of disposal of their\nhazardous substances”).\n   As we said above, though, we do not think that proof of\nownership or possession alone is a sufficient basis upon\nwhich to ground “arranger liability.” A rule stating that this\nfactor alone would suffice could broaden the sweep of\nSection 107(a)(3) beyond the bounds of fairness. If, for\nexample, a defendant arranges for a plant to treat a\nhazardous substance that it owns or possesses, but has\nabsolutely no control over the processing and no knowledge\n(or even reason to know) that the processing will result in\nthe release of hazardous waste, it would be unfair to\nrequire that defendant to contribute to the cost of cleanup.\nImposing liability on the defendant under those\ncircumstances would go beyond Congress’s intent to\nrequire those “actually responsible for any damage,\nenvironmental harm, or injury from chemical poisons” to\nshare in the cost of cleanup. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. at 55-56\n(citations omitted).\n   Second, proof of a defendant’s knowledge that hazardous\nwaste can or will be released in the course of the process\nit has arranged for, provides a good reason to hold a\ndefendant responsible because such proof demonstrates\nthat the defendant knowingly (if not personally) contributed\nto the hazardous-waste contamination. Thus, general\nknowledge that waste disposal is an inherent or inevitable\npart of the process arranged for by the defendant may\nsuffice to establish liability. See Aceto, 872 F.2d at 1384.\n\f                                    15\n\n\nThis factor can be satisfied by proof of either actual\nknowledge (e.g., a provision in an agreement estimating the\namount of environmentally harmful spillage inherent in the\nprocessing of the defendant’s materials), or presumed\nknowledge (e.g., the defendant is familiar with industry\ncustom, which is that the processing of the particular\nmaterial normally results in the release of harmful wastes).\nSee Cello-Foil Products, 100 F.3d at 1231 (concluding that\n“intent need not be proven by direct evidence, but can be\ninferred from the totality of the circumstances” when\nevaluating “arranger liability”); Montalvo, 84 F.3d at 409\n(indicating that inference that defendants had knowledge\nthat arranged for activity would entail spilling of pesticides\nand draining of contaminated rinse water would expose\ndefendants to “arranger liability”).6\n  And third, proof that the defendant had control over the\nprocess could establish that the defendant was responsible\nfor the resulting release of hazardous wastes. C.f. Shell Oil,\n294 F.3d at 1055, 1057 (suggesting that “actual control”\nrather than simply “authority to control” must be shown);\nGeneral Elec. Co. v. AAMCO Trans., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582562\"><a href=\"/opinion/582562/general-electric-company-v-aamco-transmissions-inc-central-albany-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286-\n87 (2d Cir. 1992) (implying that obligation to exercise\ncontrol alone satisfies “arranger liability” standard). In\nmany instances, proof of control could also create an\ninference that the defendant had knowledge that the\nprocess resulted in the release of hazardous wastes.\n\n6. In Shell Oil, the Ninth Circuit distinguishes between “Direct Arranger\nLiability” and “Broader Arranger Liability.” 294 F.3d at 1054-55. The\ncourt describes the former as involving a transaction in which the “ ‘sole\npurpose . . . is to arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous\nwastes.’ ” Id. at 1054 (citation omitted). In other words, “[a] direct\narranger must have direct involvement in arrangements for the disposal\nof waste.” Id. at 1055. The scienter required for “Direct Arranger\nLiability” appears to be specific intent or at least specific knowledge of\nthe waste disposal. Either level of scienter is higher than the general\nknowledge level that we require. Logically, though, if a plaintiff can prove\nthat a defendant had specific knowledge or specific intent, the plaintiff\ncan also prove the defendant had general knowledge. Accordingly, we see\nno reason to draw a distinction between direct and broad (or indirect)\n“arranger liability.” After all, there is only one category of “arranger\nliability” under Section 107(a). We believe that only one set of factors is\nrequired to analyze it.\n\f                               16\n\n\nAccordingly,    we   see   these    two   factors   as   somewhat\ninterrelated.\n   In sum, we conclude that the analysis of “arranger\nliability” under Section 107(a)(3) should focus on these\nprincipal factors: (1) ownership or possession of a material\nby the defendant; and (2) the defendant’s knowledge that\nthe processing of that material can or will result in the\nrelease of hazardous waste; or (3) the defendant’s control\nover the production process. A plaintiff is required to\ndemonstrate ownership or possession, but liability cannot\nbe imposed on that basis alone. A plaintiff is also required\nto demonstrate either knowledge or control. We identify\nthese principal factors to establish the base-line for\nanalysis of “arranger liability” in this Circuit. It is certainly\npossible that other factors could be relevant to this analysis\nin a given case, and we encourage consideration of those as\nwell.\n\nB.

Morton asserts that\nTenneco is liable because of two different types of\ntransactions — those involving PVM and those involving\n“dirty mercury” — both of which comprise an arrangement\nfor the disposal of a hazardous substance under Section\n107(a)(3). The District Court found, however, that there was\ninsufficient evidence supporting Morton’s claims to survive\nTenneco’s summary judgment motion. We will review each\nof Morton’s claims under the “arranger liability” standard\narticulated above to determine if the District Court correctly\ngranted judgment to Tenneco.\n  Our standard of review applicable to an order granting\nsummary judgment is plenary.

PVM Transactions\n  Morton alleges that Tenneco engaged in two types of “toll”\nor “conversion” transactions with the plant involving PVM,\nboth of which comprise arrangements for the disposal of\nhazardous substances owned by Tenneco under Section\n107(a)(3). Basically, Morton contends that Tenneco\npurchased the PVM either from the plant or some other\nsupplier and then paid a fee to the plant for the conversion\nof the PVM into ROM or YOM. In either case, Morton\nargues, Tenneco owned the PVM throughout the conversion\nprocess, and was aware that the conversion process\ninevitably resulted in the release of hazardous waste.\n\n               a.   Ownership or Possession\n   The District Court addressed the issue of ownership or\npossession, and found that “the record evidence shows”\nthat Tenneco did not own or possess the PVM that was\nprocessed at the plant. (App. at 12-13). The Court based its\nfinding on two conclusions. First, the Court reasoned that\nwhether Tenneco purchased the PVM through a broker or\nfrom the plant directly, the “ownership” alleged by Morton\nwas a bookkeeping function done solely for the purpose of\nminimizing the plant’s financial risk in the volatile mercury\nmarket. And second, the Court determined that there was\nnot a “showing that Tenneco was the necessary source of\nthe PVM,” or that “Tenneco was a manufacturer of PVM.”\nId. at 13.\n   We will look first at the District Court’s conclusion that\nthe “toll” or “conversion” transactions used by the plant\nwere solely for the purpose of minimizing the plant’s\nfinancial risk in the volatile mercury market. One problem\n\f                             18\n\n\nwith this conclusion is that it is an inference drawn in favor\nof Tenneco rather than Morton, the party opposing the\nmotion. Another problem is that the conclusion\ninappropriately resolves a material factual dispute.\n   Citing the plant brochure and the deposition testimony of\nseveral former plant managers, Morton explains that the\nplant customers, including Tenneco, had the option of\nsupplying their own PVM and storing it in the plant’s vault\nor purchasing it directly from the plant. If the customer\nchose the first option, the plant would charge for the\nprocessing of the PVM into ROM or YOM and for insuring\nthe mercury while it was stored at the plant, but the\ncustomer owned the mercury “at the beginning, middle,\nand end of the process.” (Morton Brief at 13) (citing App. at\n660, 881, 458). In fact, one plant manager testified that\nwhen customers supplied PVM for processing, the\ncustomers continued to hold title to it while it was at the\nplant. Id. (citing App. at 238-240). Morton asserts that\nTenneco was “a major conversion customer” from at least\n1963 to 1973, and that it supplied significant amounts of\nPVM to the plant for processing. (Morton Brief at 13-14)\n(citing, inter alia, numerous weekly Physical Inventories\nand weekly Customer Ownership Reports documenting the\nnumber of Tenneco-owned pounds of mercury stored at the\nplant and converted into ROM and YOM).\n   To be sure, Tenneco disputes Morton’s contention that it\nowned the PVM throughout the process. Tenneco contends\nthat the plant used certain billing methods (which look like\n“conversion” or “toll” agreements) “to protect itself from the\nprice volatility of the mercury market and the associated\nfinancial risk . . . .” (Tenneco Brief at 6). Tenneco also\nasserts that the PVM it allegedly owned was never\nsegregated or labeled as belonging to it at any point in the\nprocess. Id. at 21-22 (citing App. at 533-34). In fact,\nTenneco maintains that the customer-delivered PVM was\nnot the actual mercury used to manufacture that\ncustomer’s ROM and YOM because mercury is\nhomogeneous; instead the mercury was added to the\nplant’s inventory, like money in a bank. Id. at 22-23 (citing\nApp. at 635-38, 533-34, 472-73). (Thus, Tenneco’s\nownership of the PVM that was converted at the plant on\n\f                                      19\n\n\nTenneco’s behalf is very much in dispute. Morton has\nsubmitted evidence, including plant records and the\ntestimony of former plant managers, from which it is fair to\ninfer that Tenneco owned the PVM (regardless of whether it\npurchased it from the plant or a third party) throughout the\nconversion process. Proof of ownership, of course, is one of\nthe principal factors in the “arranger liability” analysis.\nTherefore, this evidence is sufficient to withstand Tenneco’s\nmotion for summary judgment.7\n\n                           b.    Knowledge\n  Although the District Court did not directly address the\nknowledge factor, it discussed evidence that is relevant. The\nCourt referred to a memorandum from the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) cited by Morton\nand concluded that the reference therein to Tenneco’s\ndisposal of mercury by-products was “just not enough”\nevidence to survive a motion for summary judgment. (App.\nat 14, 15).\n  Before    we    discuss       the    other   evidence   related    to\n\n7. Although we have already identified material disputed facts on the\nissue of ownership that warrant remand for further consideration, we\npause to consider Tenneco’s argument that because mercury is\nhomogenous, it could not have been owned by any particular customer\nthroughout the oxide processing at the plant. See supra. Tenneco’s own\nanalogy to money in a bank suffices to demonstrate the\nunreasonableness of its argument. When money is deposited in a bank\nthe depositor does not cease owning the money because the actual\ndollars and cents it deposited are fungible and are used by other\ncustomers. Whether the plant segregated each customer’s PVM or simply\nadded it all together is inconsequential. The ownership or possession\nfactor can be satisfied by proof that Tenneco owned or possessed the\namount of PVM that it paid to have processed into ROM and YOM. See\nApp. at 881 (Wood Ridge Chemical Corporation Balance Sheet and\nAuditor’s Report, stating: “Since mercury is homogeneous, it is not\npossible to physically identify owned from non-owned mercury, but\nrecords are maintained to account for customer-owned quantities.”). Like\nownership of money in a bank, Tenneco’s ownership of a mercury is not\nrefuted by proof that other customers used the exact PVM it initially\ndeposited. Cf. Hercules, 247 F.3d at 721 (finding defendant owned\nmaterial despite intermingling with other materials during processing).\n\f                              20\n\n\nknowledge that was submitted by Morton, we will address\nTenneco’s argument that the EPA memorandum should not\nbe considered because it is not part of the record. Morton’s\ncounsel read a portion of the 1971 EPA memorandum\nduring the summary judgment oral argument, but\nneglected to move its admission into the record. Id. at 80-\n81. Prior to filing its appellate brief, Morton moved the\nDistrict Court to supplement the record with, among other\nthings, the EPA memorandum. The motion was denied, and\nMorton has not appealed that decision. Because the\nmemorandum is not included in the certified record, even\nafter Morton’s motion to supplement the record, Tenneco\nargues that we should not consider it at all. Tenneco\nargues, too, that Morton’s counsel did not provide a copy of\nthe document to either the District Court or opposing\ncounsel. Morton asserts, however, that Tenneco produced\nthis document during discovery. And, because counsel read\nthe relevant portions of the memorandum into the record\nduring oral argument without objection from Tenneco and\nbecause the District Court referred to the memorandum in\nher ruling, the memorandum is part of the record.\n  According to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(a),\nthe record on appeal is comprised of (1) the original papers\nand exhibits filed in the district court; (2) the transcript of\nthe proceedings; and (3) a certified copy of the docket\nentries. “This definition not only includes items admitted\ninto evidence, but also includes items presented to the\ndistrict court and not admitted into evidence.” Waldorf v.\nShuta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754049\"><a href=\"/opinion/754049/mark-waldorf-in-no-97-5195-v-edward-j-shuta-carolyn-wood-kenneth-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (3d Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).\n   Here, it is undisputed that the EPA memorandum was\nnever included in the record in its entirety. Given that the\nmemorandum does not appear to have been presented to\nthe District Court, we will not review it in its entirety (which\nis not possible as a practical matter in any event because\nthe document was not included in the appendices). See\nWaldorf, 142 F.3d at 620 (“The basic purpose behind the\nrule is to prevent parties from supplementing the record on\nappeal with items never presented to the district court.”)\nThe next question is whether we can appropriately consider\nthe portion of the memorandum that was read by Morton’s\ncounsel during oral argument and which is found in the\n\f                              21\n\n\ntranscript. Because we conclude that Morton presented\nevidence other than the portion of the EPA memorandum to\nestablish Tenneco’s knowledge, and because we think that\nevidence created disputed facts, we do not need to decide\nwhether it is appropriate for us to consider the\nmemorandum on appeal. We leave it to the District Court\nto evaluate the admissibility of the document on remand.\n  As we just mentioned, Morton presented evidence other\nthan the EPA memorandum to establish Tenneco’s\nknowledge that the release of hazardous waste was an\ninherent and inevitable aspect of mercury processing.\nSpecifically, Morton maintains that Tenneco was\nknowledgeable about mercury processing because it used\nROM and YOM to manufacture products at its own\nfacilities, and because it had produced mercury oxide at its\nElizabeth facility in the past. (Morton Brief at 7-8, 9) (citing\nApp. at 855). Morton contends that Tenneco must have\nbeen aware of the environmental risks inherent in mercury\nprocessing because “the hazards of handling and\nprocessing mercury were well known within the industry\ngenerally,” and because “substantial mercury loss, as well\nas known losses in dust and vapor, were an inherent part\nof manufacturing mercury intermediates,” and that those\nlosses were “closely monitored by the Plant and its\ncustomers who provided the mercury.” Id. at 9, 10 (citing\nApp. at 940, 942, 932-33, 796, 252-53).\n  Tenneco does not dispute that it used ROM and YOM to\nmanufacture its own products at its Elizabeth facility or\nthat it produced mercury oxide at the same facility in the\npast. (Tenneco Brief at 24, 27). Instead, Tenneco accuses\nMorton of improperly relying on general facts about the\nplant’s relationship with its customers rather than facts\nspecific to the plant’s relationship with Tenneco in\nattempting to prove Tenneco’s knowledge that waste was\nreleased during mercury processing.\n  We think it is fair to infer from Tenneco’s involvement\nwith mercury oxides at its own facility that Tenneco had\nsome knowledge about the environmental hazards of\nmercury processing. We also think it is fair to rely on\nevidence provided by Morton about the plant customers\ngenerally. While Morton did not present evidence showing\n\f                              22\n\n\nthat Tenneco, specifically, was monitoring the mercury\nlosses during processing at the plant, it was not required to\ndo so in order to survive Tenneco’s motion for summary\njudgment. After all, Tenneco was undisputably one of the\nplant customers, and it is thus reasonable to infer (absent\nproof to the contrary) that it had the same kind of\nrelationship with the plant as did the other customers.\nWhether a jury would ultimately be persuaded by this\nevidence is uncertain, but that is not the standard we apply\nin evaluating a summary judgment motion. Accordingly, we\nbelieve that there are disputed facts with respect to\nTenneco’s knowledge of hazardous waste releases during\nthe processing of PVM at the plant. Because knowledge is\none of the principal factors in the “arranger liability”\nanalysis, this evidence is sufficient to withstand Tenneco’s\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n                         c.   Control\n   The District Court did not directly discuss this factor.\nBut, related to control, the Court observed that it would not\nhave mattered if Tenneco had shipped PVM directly to the\nplant on a regular basis because “it is what happened [at\nthe plant] and [Tenneco’s] involvement . . . with respect to\nwhat happened [at the plant] that’s important.” (App. at\n12). We disagree with the Court’s suggestion that proof that\nTenneco shipped PVM directly to the plan would have been\nirrelevant. Such proof could demonstrate Tenneco’s\nownership, or at least possession, of the PVM. More\nimportantly, though, the parties dispute Tenneco’s level of\ncontrol over “what happened” at the plant.\n  Morton states that “customers such as Tenneco played a\nkey role in shaping the Plant’s production processes and its\nresulting emissions” by approving a new process for\nmercury oxide manufacturing in the late 1960’s. (Morton\nBrief at 11) (citing App. at 827-28, 923, 952, 953, 406-10).\nMorton argues that the customer’s approval of the\nproduction process amounted to some control over the\nproduction process. Tenneco, however, disputes Morton’s\nassertion that it had any control over the plant operations\nor disposal practices. (Tenneco Brief at 12-13) (citing App.\nat 504, 268, 340-42, 244-50).\n\f                             23\n\n\n   Again, Morton’s evidence about the customers generally\nis relevant — Tenneco was undisputably a customer of the\nplant. Whether this evidence alone is sufficient to establish\ncontrol is another matter. Because we are remanding this\ncase to be analyzed under the standard articulated above,\nwe suggest that the District Court consider this evidence in\nthe subsequent proceedings.\n\n                d.   Useful Product Defense\n  The District Court characterized the PVM transactions as\n“sales transactions” and referred to the “useful product\ndefense” discussed in Pneumo Abex Corp. v. High Point,\nThomasville and Denton R.R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774 (4th\nCir. 1998). (App. at 13-14). Tenneco argued below, and\ncontinues to argue on appeal, that this defense applies\nbecause the transactions at issue were nothing more than\na sale of a useful product (PVM) and a purchase of finished\nproducts (ROM and YOM). We believe that there are\ndisputed facts with respect to the critical elements of this\ndefense.‘’\n   In Pneumo Abex, the court concluded that “ ‘treatment\n. . . of hazardous substances’ as used in CERCLA refers to\na party arranging for the processing of discarded hazardous\nsubstances or processing resulting in the discard of\nhazardous substances.” 142 F.3d at 774. Accordingly, the\nsale of valuable materials to a processor alone does not\nsatisfy the requirements for “arranger liability.” See Glaxo\nWellcome, Inc., 189 F.3d at 164; Solvent Chemical Co., 225\nF. Supp. 2d at 280.\n   We agree with Tenneco that the sale of PVM alone or the\npurchase of ROM and YOM alone — without evidence of\nownership or possession, knowledge, and control — would\nnot be sufficient grounds on which to impose “arranger\nliability.” Those transactions would either not meet the\nstandard we have articulated or would fall within the\n“useful product defense.” It would be inappropriate at this\nstage in the proceedings, however, to conclude that the\ntransactions between Tenneco and the plant were nothing\nmore than a sale of PVM or the purchase of ROM and YOM\nbecause of the factual disputes we have described with\n\f                              24\n\n\nrespect to the key elements of ownership or possession,\nknowledge, and control.\n\n              2.   “Dirty Mercury” Transactions\n   Morton asserts that Tenneco shipped its own “dirty\nmercury” to the plant for processing into usable mercury, a\ntransaction which clearly qualifies Tenneco for “arranger\nliability.” (Morton Brief at 15). Morton contends that it\nsubmitted evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment\non this claim. Tenneco argues that Morton did not present\nthis claim to the District Court at all.\n   It is true that Morton did not include the “dirty mercury”\nallegation in its Statement of Contested Facts for the\nPretrial Order. (Supp. App. at 2-3). As a general matter, the\npretrial order will “control the subsequent course of the\naction unless modified by a subsequent order.” Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 16(e). Moreover, the “finality of the pretrial order\ncontributes substantially to the orderly and efficient trial of\na case.” Petree v. Victor Fluid Power, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496590\"><a href=\"/opinion/496590/petree-david-and-petree-diana-l-his-wife-v-victor-fluid-power-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1194 (3d Cir. 1987).\n  Nonetheless, “Rule 16 was not intended to function as an\ninflexible straightjacket on the conduct of litigation . . .\ninstead, it was intended to insure the efficient resolution of\ncases and, most importantly, minimize prejudicial\nsurprise.” Lamborn v. Dittmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522160\"><a href=\"/opinion/522160/george-lamborn-henry-maringer-and-lamar-commodities-a-partnership-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527 (2d Cir.\n1989) (citations omitted). Accordingly, Morton argues that\nthe issue is properly addressed on appeal because it raised\nthe issue in its brief opposing Tenneco’s motion for\nsummary judgment.\n  In response to Tenneco’s individual motion for summary\njudgment, Morton incorporated its Statement of Material\nFacts from the earlier summary judgment proceeding\ninvolving all of the defendants. In paragraph 10 of that\nStatement of Material Facts, Morton makes allegations\nabout PVM and “dirty mercury” transactions against “The\nCustomers” generally without specifying any customer by\nname. (App. at 157). In paragraph 11, Morton asserts that\nthe    “evidence   confirming    these  transactions   is\noverwhelming” and cites numerous pages of deposition\ntestimony. Id. One of the cited portions of deposition\n\f                              25\n\n\ntestimony indicates that Tenneco shipped “dirty mercury”\nto the plant. Id. (deposition transcript of Joseph H.\nBernstein at 860).\n   The critical issue is whether Tenneco was on notice of\nMorton’s “dirty mercury” claim during the summary\njudgment proceedings despite the fact that the claim was\nnot included in the Pretrial Order. We find that Tenneco\nwas sufficiently aware of the claim. Tenneco was\npresumably put on notice of Morton’s allegation at the time\nof the Bernstein deposition given that Bernstein stated that\nhe believed that Tenneco shipped “dirty mercury” to the\nplant. If not at the time of the deposition, Tenneco was\nsurely on notice as of the time it received Morton’s\nStatement of Material Facts during the first summary\njudgment proceeding. Finally, Tenneco was put on notice of\nthis claim a third time when Morton incorporated its\nStatement of Material Facts into its response to Tenneco’s\nindividual motion for summary judgment. Thus, although\nMorton’s failure to include this claim in the Pretrial Order\nviolates the letter of Rule 16(e), our consideration of this\nclaim on appeal does not violate the purpose of the rule,\nwhich is primarily to “minimize prejudicial surprise.”\nLamborn, 873 F.2d at 527.\n  Assuming we would consider the “dirty mercury” claim,\nTenecco argues in the alternative that the District Court\nproperly granted summary judgment to Tenneco because,\nquite simply,“Morton has absolutely no evidence to support\nsuch a claim.” (Tenneco Brief at 57). We disagree.\n  Morton asserts that Tenneco shipped its own “dirty\nmercury” to the plant for processing into usable mercury.\n(Morton Brief at 15) (citing Bernstein Dep. at 40, 860).\nMorton maintains that the plant’s standard operating\nprocedure was to store “dirty mercury” in separate flasks\nlabeled with the customer’s name and date received and\nthen to purify the mercury by a furnace-operated\ndistillation process, which produced environmentally\nharmful residue. Id. (citing App. at 431-32, 443, 447, 461-\n63, 868-69, 954). Morton contends that customers were\napprised of the fact that “a certain percentage of mercury\nwould be lost in the process.” Id. (citing App. at 963-65,\n263). This evidence is sufficient to at least create a disputed\n\f                                26\n\n\nfact with respect to each of the principal “arranger liability”\nfactors — ownership or possession, knowledge, and control.\nTherefore, under the standard we have just articulated, this\nevidence suffices to survive summary judgment.\n\n           3.    Spill Act and Common Law Claims\n  The District Court did not discuss Morton’s Spill Act\nclaim or its common law contribution claim, but it\nnevertheless granted summary judgment to Tenneco on\nboth. Because the Spill Act is the “New Jersey analog to\nCERCLA,” the standards for liability are the same. See SC\nHoldings, Inc. v. A.A.A. Realty Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2594384\"><a href=\"/opinion/2594384/sc-holdings-inc-v-aaa-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Therefore, we vacate the District\nCourt’s grant of summary judgment on the Spill Act claim\nfor the same reasons that we vacate judgment on the\nCERCLA claim. We conclude, however, that the District\nCourt’s grant of judgment to Tenneco on the common law\ncontribution claim was appropriate because that claim is\npreempted by CERCLA Section 113(f). See In the Matter of\nReading Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741865\"><a href=\"/opinion/741865/in-the-matter-of-reading-company-debtor-united-states-of-america-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1117 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding\nthat CERCLA Section 113(f) preempts common law\ncontribution claim).\n\n                       IV.   Conclusion\n  Because there are disputed material facts with respect to\nMorton’s CERCLA and Spill Act claims against Tenneco, we\nwill vacate the District Court’s grant of summary judgment\nand remand those claims for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion. Because Morton’s common law\ncontribution claim is preempted by CERCLA, we will affirm\nthe District Court’s grant of summary judgment to Tenneco.\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                     Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                                 for the Third Circuit\n\f</pre>",
