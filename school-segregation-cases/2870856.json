He\nalleges that a correctional officer planted contraband near\n\fhis locker because he filed complaints against that officer,\nthat he was denied a fair hearing on the contraband\ncharges, and that, as a result, he was placed in disciplinary\nconfinement for several months, including four days in a\ncell that was smeared with feces and infested with flies and\nin which he could not eat, drink, or sleep. The District\nCourt dismissed Mitchell’s complaint sua sponte the day it\nwas filed without requiring service on the defendants. For\nthe reasons below, we reverse the District Court’s judgment\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\nI. Factual Background and Procedural History\n\nOn appeal from the dismissal of a complaint, we assume\nthe allegations in the complaint to be true. See Ray v.\nKertes, 285 F.3d 287, 291 (3d Cir. 2002); Micklus v.\nCarlson, 632 F.2d 227, 230 (3d Cir. 1980).\n\nOn October 5, 1996, while Mitchell was an inmate in the\nDrug and Alcohol Unit at the Graterford Correctional\nInstitution in Pennsylvania (\"Graterford\"), prison officials\n\n                                2\n\n\nentered his living area to conduct a search. During the\nsearch, they found a folded brown paper napkin containing\ndrugs and U.S. currency taped under Mitchell’s locker.\nMitchell denied owning or knowing about the contraband,\nand his urinalysis tested negative for drugs. At the security\noffice, Mitchell asked a correctional officer to preserve the\ntape that had affixed the contraband under his locker so\nthat it could be fingerprinted. Although Mitchell offered to\npay for the fingerprint analysis, the prison denied his\nrequest. Pending a hearing on the contraband charges,\nprison officials placed him in the Restricted Housing Unit\n(\"RHU\").\n\nThe next day, prison officials brought Mitchell to the\ninstitution’s security unit for questioning. Lieutenant\nKowalski told Mitchell that he had information suggesting\nthat Officer Ronald Wilson, the officer regularly assigned to\nthe Drug and Alcohol Unit, framed Mitchell. Mitchell\nconcurred that he had been set up and again requested\nfingerprint testing to prove his innocence. Kowalski offered\nto look into the matter, and Mitchell was returned to the\nRHU.\n\nTwo days after the officers discovered the contraband,\nMitchell was called to a disciplinary hearing, in preparation\nfor which he was permitted five minutes to confer with an\ninmate assistant. During the hearing, Mitchell argued that\nsomeone had set him up. He noted that the area in which\nthe officers found the contraband was easily accessible to\nothers, requested that the hearing examiner inquire when\nthat area had last been searched, and asked again for a\nfingerprint test. His requests were denied. Finding Mitchell\nguilty of contraband charges and of lying to a prison\nemployee, the hearing examiner sentenced him to ninety\ndays in disciplinary custody.\n\fFollowing proper procedure, Mitchell appealed the\nhearing examiner’s verdict first to the Program Review\nCommittee, then to the prison superintendent, and finally\nto the chief counsel. Each appeal was denied. During the\npendency of these appeals, Mitchell was relocated to a cell\nnormally used to house mentally ill inmates. The cell had\n\"human waste smeared on the walls\" and was\"infested\n\n                                3\n\n\nwith flies.\" At night, \"kicking and banging on the doors by\nthe other inmates\" kept Mitchell awake.\n\nMitchell complained to prison officials about his\nconditions to no avail. He sought to file an administrative\ngrievance protesting the conditions of his confinement, but\nprison officials denied him an inmate grievance form.\nPrison regulations provide that a grievance form is\"the\nproper form to be used for submission of a grievance and\nit should be completed according to the directions\nprovided.\" Commonwealth of Pa., Dep’t of Corr.,\nConsolidated Inmate Grievance Review System, Policy\nStatement DC-ADM 804 V(B) (Oct. 20, 1994). Additionally,\ninmate grievances must be \"in writing and in the format\nprovided on the forms supplied by the institution.\" Id.\n804(VI)(A)(1) (internal citation omitted). After four days,\nduring which Mitchell alleges he did not eat, drink, or\nsleep, the Program Review Committee, in the course of\nfulfilling its mandate to \"interview all disciplinary custody\ncases every thirty (30) days,\" Commonwealth of Pa., Dep’t of\nCorr., Inmate Disciplinary and Restricted Housing\nProcedures, Policy Statement DC-ADM 801 VI(D)(9) (Sept.\n20, 1994), confirmed that his cell was unfit for human\nhabitation. He was transferred to Huntingdon Correctional\nInstitution on December 4, 1996.1\n\nIn January 1998, Mitchell returned to Graterford to face\ncriminal drug-possession charges stemming from the\nOctober 5, 1996 contraband incident and was again placed\nin the RHU. At a preliminary hearing held after Mitchell’s\nreturn to Graterford, all criminal charges against Mitchell\nwere dismissed. Nonetheless, Graterford officials kept him\nsegregated in the RHU for another two months, explaining\nthat his return to the general Graterford population was\n\"not an option.\" After numerous complaints, Mitchell was\ntransferred back to Huntingdon on April 1, 1998.\n\nOn September 29, 1998, Mitchell filed the current\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In early 1997, Mitchell filed a \"private complaint\" against Officer\nWilson, whom he accused of planting contraband under his locker. The\nrecord does not reflect how or even whether this private complaint was\nresolved.\n\n                                4\n\fEastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that: (1) Officer\nWilson planted contraband in retaliation for Mitchell’s\ncomplaints against him, in violation of his First, Fifth, and\nEighth Amendment rights; (2) prison officials denied\nMitchell adequate time to confer with his inmate assistant,\ndenied him the opportunity to present a meaningful\ndefense, and failed adequately to investigate his allegations\nthat the charges against him were fabricated, all in\nviolation of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights; (3) prison officials placed Mitchell in a cell unfit for\nhuman habitation, in violation of his Eighth Amendment\nrights; and (4) as a result of these violations, Mitchell\nsuffered, inter alia, emotional trauma, fear, and shock, and\nlost his status and any chance of commutation. As noted,\nthe District Court dismissed his complaint the day it was\nfiled. The Court dismissed as frivolous Mitchell’s retaliation\ncharge, which it held did not state a violation of his\nconstitutional rights, and his due process claim, on the\nground that Mitchell’s confinement did not implicate a\nliberty interest. The District Court also held that Mitchell\nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect\nto his Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement claim\nand dismissed that claim without prejudice. Finally, the\nDistrict Court held that Mitchell could not bring a claim for\nemotional trauma without a prior showing of physical\ninjury.\n\nThis timely appeal followed. Because the District Court\ndismissed this case before the defendant was served, the\ndefendant -- Commissioner of the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections -- was not technically a party to\nthis suit. Therefore, we requested that the Commonwealth\nof Pennsylvania file a brief as amicus curiae. 2\n\nII. Jurisdiction\n\nThe District Court’s dismissal of Mitchell’s retaliation and\ndue process claims as frivolous is appealable under 28\nU.S.C. 1291. See Wilson v. Rackmill, 878 F.2d 772, 773 (3d\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. We appreciate the candor and professionalism of the Commonwealth’s\ncounsel. We extend as well our appreciation to Mitchell’s appointed\ncounsel for the time and talent they have dedicated to this case.\n\n                                5\n\n\nCir. 1989). Under the circumstances, his Eighth\nAmendment conditions-of-confinement claim is appealable\nas well. When a claim is dismissed without prejudice, we\ntreat it as a final decision, appealable under 1291,\"when a\nplaintiff ‘declares his intention to stand on his complaint or\nwhen he cannot cure the defect in his complaint.’ \" Ray,\n285 F.3d at 291 (quoting Booth v. Churner, 206 F.3d 289,\n293 n.3 (3d Cir. 2000), aff ’d, 532 U.S. 731 (2001)). While\nMitchell has not clearly declared his intention to stand on\nhis complaint, the defect for which the District Court\ndismissed Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement\n\fclaim -- failure to exhaust available administrative\nremedies -- is no longer curable. See Booth , 206 F.3d at\n293 n.3. It has been six years since the events resulting in\nthis appeal, and prison regulations allowed Mitchell only\nfifteen days \"after the events upon which the claims are\nbased\" to file a grievance. DC-ADM 804 VI(B)(2).\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nThis case raises four questions, which we address in the\nfollowing order: (1) whether Mitchell exhausted the available\nadministrative remedies on his Eighth Amendment\nconditions-of-confinement claim; (2) is his retaliation claim\nfrivolous; (3) whether his due process claim is frivolous;\nand (4) has Mitchell alleged a physical injury sufficient to\nsupport his emotional injury claims. Throughout we bear in\nmind that, \"however inartfully pleaded,\" the\"allegations of\n[a] pro se complaint [are held] to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\" Haines v.\nKerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).\n\nA. Exhaustion\n\nBefore filing suit, prisoners must exhaust their available\nadministrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a). 3 The\n\"availability of administrative remedies to a prisoner is a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a) provides that \"[n]o action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other\nFederal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other\ncorrectional facility until such administrative remedies as are available\nare exhausted.\"\n\n                                6\n\n\nquestion of law,\" which we review de novo. Ray, 285 F.3d\nat 291.\n\nThe District Court dismissed Mitchell’s conditions-of-\nconfinement claim, which asserts that he spent four days in\na filthy cell in which he could not eat, drink, or sleep,\nbecause he \"does not allege that he filed any grievances\nregarding the conditions of his cell.\" Mitchell argues that he\ndid not file a grievance because prison officials denied him\nthe necessary grievance forms and, as a result, he lacked\n\"available\" administrative remedies. The Commonwealth\nconcedes this point. Accord Miller v. Norris, 247 F.3d 736,\n740 (8th Cir. 2001) (\"[A] remedy that prison officials prevent\na prisoner from ‘utiliz[ing]’ is not an‘available’ remedy\nunder S 1997e(a) . . . .\") (alterations in original).\n\nEven absent the prison’s precluding Mitchell’s grievance,\nthe District Court erred procedurally. Failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies is an affirmative defense for the\ndefendant to plead. Ray, 285 F.3d at 295. Under 1997e(c)\nfailure to exhaust is not a permissible basis for sua sponte\ndismissal. Id. at 295-96. The defendants in this case were\nnot served and therefore have not pled failure to exhaust or\n\fany other defense. Thus, even if Mitchell failed to exhaust\nhis available remedies (excused, as the Commonwealth\nconcedes, by the failure to provide grievance forms), the\nDistrict Court was premature in dismissing his complaint.\n\nB. Retaliation claim\n\nThe District Court dismissed as frivolous Mitchell’s\nretaliation claim -- that Officer Wilson planted illegal drugs\nunder Mitchell’s locker in retaliation for Mitchell’s\ncomplaints against him -- reasoning that \"[t]he filing of a\nfalse or unfounded misconduct charge against an inmate\ndoes not constitute a deprivation of a constitutional right.\"\n\nTo be frivolous, a claim must rely on an \"indisputably\nmeritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or\ndelusional\" factual scenario. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S.\n319, 327-28 (1989); Wilson, 878 F.2d at 774; see, e.g.,\nDeutch v. United States, 67 F.3d 1080, 1091-92 (3d Cir.\n1995) (holding frivolous a suit alleging that prison officials\ntook an inmate’s pen and refused to give it back). We\nexercise plenary review over a dismissal for frivolousness.\n\n                                7\n\n\nTourscher v. McCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999);\naccord McGore v. Wrigglesworth, 114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th\nCir. 1997). We are especially careful when assessing\nfrivolousness in the case of in forma pauperis complaints,\nfor \"prisoners often must rely on the courts as the only\navailable forum to redress their grievances, even when\nthose grievances seem insignificant to one who is not so\nconfined.\" See Deutch, 67 F.3d at 1090.\n\nIn dismissing Mitchell’s retaliation claim, the District\nCourt failed to recognize that \"[g]overnment actions, which\nstanding alone do not violate the Constitution, may\nnonetheless be constitutional torts if motivated in\nsubstantial part by a desire to punish an individual for\nexercise of a constitutional right.\" Allah v. Seiverling, 229\nF.3d 220, 224-25 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Thaddeus-X v.\nBlatter, 175 F.3d 378, 386 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc)). A\nprisoner alleging retaliation must show (1) constitutionally\nprotected conduct, (2) an adverse action by prison officials\n\" ‘sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from\nexercising his [constitutional] rights,’ \" and (3) \"a causal\nlink between the exercise of his constitutional rights and\nthe adverse action taken against him.\" Rauser v. Horn, 241\nF.3d 330, 333 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting Allah, 229 F.3d at\n225) (alteration in original).\n\nMitchell’s allegation that he was falsely charged with\nmisconduct in retaliation for filing complaints against\nOfficer Wilson implicates conduct protected by the First\nAmendment. See Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 653 (3d\nCir. 2002) (\"We have . . . held that falsifying misconduct\nreports in retaliation for an inmate’s resort to legal process\nis a violation of the First Amendment’s guarantee of free\naccess to the courts.\"); Allah, 229 F.3d at 225 (holding that\n\fan allegation that a prisoner was kept in administrative\nsegregation to punish him for filing civil rights complaints\nstated a retaliation claim); Babcock v. White , 102 F.3d 267,\n275-76 (7th Cir. 1996) (prisoner could survive summary\njudgment on his claim that prison officials retaliated\nagainst him for \"use of the ‘inmate grievance system’ and\nprevious lawsuits\"). Moreover, we believe that several\nmonths in disciplinary confinement would deter a\nreasonably firm prisoner from exercising his First\n\n                                8\n\n\nAmendment rights. Finally, we agree with Mitchell that the\nword \"retaliation\" in his complaint sufficiently implies a\ncausal link between his complaints and the misconduct\ncharges filed against him.\n\nAlthough Mitchell’s retaliation claim may ultimately not\nsucceed on the merits, it is not \"indisputably meritless,\"\n\"fantastic or delusional,\" \"of little or no weight,\" or \"trivial.\"\nNeitzke, 490 U.S. at 325, 327; Deutch , 67 F.3d at 1089.\nAnd while we would prefer that Mitchell’s complaint be\nmore detailed, we take seriously our charge to construe pro\nse complaints nonrestrictively. Haines, 404 U.S. at 520. To\nleave no doubt, the Commonwealth, in its role as amicus,\nagrees that the District Court erred in overlooking Mitchell’s\nretaliation claim.\n\nWhile Mitchell has stated a nonfrivolous retaliation claim,\nthe Supreme Court recently clarified in Porter v. Nussle,\n534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002), that 1997e(a) requires a prisoner\nto exhaust his administrative remedies when alleging\n\"particular episodes\" of misconduct -- which would include\nan act of retaliation. On appeal the Commonwealth’s\namicus brief acknowledges that \"Mitchell appealed\nthe hearing examiner’s decision to the various levels\navailable through the Inmate Disciplinary Procedure.\"\nCommonwealth’s Br. at 5 (emphasis added).\n\nC. Due Process\n\nMitchell’s due process claim alleges that he received only\nfive minutes to confer with an inmate assistant before his\ndisciplinary hearing, that he was denied a fair opportunity\nto review the evidence against him, and that the hearing\nitself was conducted unfairly.\n\nMitchell’s procedural due process rights are triggered by\ndeprivation of a legally cognizable liberty interest. For a\nprisoner, such a deprivation occurs when the prison\n\"imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Sandin v.\nConner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995).4 Lesser restraints on a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Additionally, state prisoners have a protected liberty interest in\navoiding restraints that \"exceed[ ] the sentence in such an unexpected\n\n                                9\n\fprisoner’s freedom are deemed to fall \"within the expected\nperimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of law.\" Id.\nIf Mitchell had no protected liberty interest in remaining\nfree of disciplinary custody, then the state owed him no\nprocess before placing him in disciplinary confinement. We\ntherefore must decide whether Mitchell’s contention that he\nhad a protected liberty interest in avoiding disciplinary\ncustody is frivolous. This is a question of constitutional fact\nover which we exercise independent appellate review\"in\norder to preserve the precious liberties established and\nordained by the Constitution.\" Fabulous Assoc., Inc. v. Pa.\nPub. Util. Comm’n, 896 F.2d 780, 783 (3d Cir. 1990)\n(quoting Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union, 466 U.S. 485, 511\n(1984)).\n\nThe District Court, citing Sandin, dismissed Mitchell’s\nclaim as frivolous because \"prison regulations on\nconfinement of inmates do not create a liberty interest\nenforceable in a S 1983 action.\" However, Sandin did not\npronounce a per se rule, as the District Court’s opinion\nimplies. In Sandin, to determine whether the prisoner’s\ntreatment -- thirty days disciplinary segregation for\nresisting a strip search -- implicated a liberty interest, the\nSupreme Court carefully compared the circumstances of\nthe prisoner’s confinement with those of other inmates. It\nfound no liberty interest implicated because the prisoner’s\n\"disciplinary segregation, with insignificant exceptions,\nmirrored those conditions imposed upon inmates in\nadministrative segregation and protective custody\" in that\n\"conditions at [the prison] involve[d] significant amounts of\n‘lockdown time’ even for inmates in the general population.\"\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 486. But the Court left open the\npossibility that a liberty interest will be implicated by\nconditions that impose an \"atypical and significant\nhardship.\" Id. at 484.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nmanner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own\nforce.\" Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Examples would be involuntary\nadministration of psychotropic medication, see Washington v. Harper,\n494 U.S. 210, 221-22 (1990), or involuntary transfer to a state mental\nhospital for treatment, see Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 494 (1980).\nMitchell does not contend that his transfer falls into such a category.\n\n                                10\n\n\nIn deciding whether a protected liberty interest exists\nunder Sandin, we consider the duration of the disciplinary\nconfinement and the conditions of that confinement in\nrelation to other prison conditions. See Shoats v. Horn, 213\nF.3d 140, 144 (3d Cir. 2000). Not surprisingly, our cases\nengaging in this inquiry have reached differing outcomes,\nreflecting the fact-specific nature of the Sandin test.\nCompare Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532, 545 (3d Cir.\n2002) (denial of the right to participate in a sex offender\ntreatment program that was \"mandated and promised\" by\nNew Jersey law implicated a protected liberty interest, and\n\fShoats, 213 F.3d at 144 (eight years in administrative\nconfinement, during which inmate was locked in his cell for\nall but two hours per week, denied contact with his family,\nand prohibited from visiting the library or \"participating in\nany education, vocational, or other organization activities,\"\nclearly implicated a protected liberty interest), with Smith,\n293 F.3d at 645, 654 (seven months in disciplinary\nconfinement did not implicate a liberty interest), Torres v.\nFauver, 292 F.3d 141, 151-52 (3d Cir. 2002) (disciplinary\ndetention for fifteen days and administrative segregation for\n120 days was not atypical treatment in New Jersey prisons\nand therefore did not implicate a protected liberty interest),\nand Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706-09 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(administrative detention, which imposed strict restrictions\non outside contact and personal conveniences, did not\nimplicate a protected liberty interest).\n\nThis case appears to bear some similarity to Griffin,\nwhich also involved a Graterford inmate. We held that\nGriffin, who was detained for fifteen months in\nadministrative custody under restrictions comparable to\nthose here, did not have a liberty interest in avoiding that\nconfinement. See id. The differences Mitchell has thus far\nraised between his case and Griffin appear, without more,\nconstitutionally insignificant. For example, inmates in\ndisciplinary custody5 like Mitchell are permitted only one\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Disciplinary custody is the \"maximum restrictive status of\nconfinement\" for inmates in the Pennsylvania prison system. DC-ADM\n801 IV(B). Administrative custody is a \"status of confinement for non-\ndisciplinary reasons which provides closer supervision, control, and\nprotection than is provided in general population.\" Commonwealth of\nPa., Dep’t of Corr., Administrative Custody Procedures, Policy Statement\nDC-ADM 802 IV(A) (Oct. 29, 1992).\n\n                                11\n\n\nvisitor every month and one pack of cigarettes every two\nweeks, DC-ADM 801 VI(D)(2), (4), whereas inmates in\nadministrative custody like Griffin are allowed one visitor\nand two packs of cigarettes per week, Commonwealth of\nPa., Dep’t of Corr., Administrative Custody Procedures,\nPolicy Statement DC-ADM 802 V(A)(1), (3) (Oct. 29, 1992).\nThis marginal difference does not appear to cross the\nconstitutional line. Moreover, the prisoner in Sandin, whom\nthe Supreme Court held did not bear \"atypical and\nsignificant hardship,\" Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484, was, like\nMitchell, in disciplinary custody.\n\nHowever, apparent similarities between Griffin and this\ncase notwithstanding, given this case’s procedural posture\nand the fact that Mitchell prepared his complaint pro se,\nthe record is not sufficiently developed for us to determine\nwhether there were other features of Mitchell’s confinement\nthat meaningfully distinguished his situation from that in\nGriffin. See Perkins v. Kan. Dep’t of Corr. , 165 F.3d 803,\n809 (10th Cir. 1999) (reversing district court’s sua sponte\ndismissal because the court \"did not have the evidence\n\fbefore it from which it could engage in the analysis\nrequired by Sandin\"); Whitford v. Boglino, 63 F.3d 527, 533\n(7th Cir. 1995) (same). Given the \"fact-intensive inquiry\"\nimplied by Sandin, see Ayers v. Ryan, 152 F.3d 77, 83 (2d\nCir. 1998), we remand for development of the record. 6\n\nD. Emotional Injury\n\nSection 803(d) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act,\ncodified at 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(e), predicates a prisoner’s\nclaim for mental or emotional injury suffered while in\ncustody on a showing of accompanying physical injury.7\nThe District Court, citing this provision, dismissed\nMitchell’s complaint to the extent it sought relief for\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In performing the inquiry Sandin requires, the District Court on\nremand will need to consider whether the deplorable conditions of\nMitchell’s cell during a portion of his disciplinary confinement implicated\na protected liberty interest.\n\n7. 42 U.S.C. 1997e(e) states that \"[n]o Federal civil action may be\nbrought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional\nfacility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without\na prior showing of physical injury.\"\n\n                                12\n\n\n\"emotional trauma.\" Implicit in this dismissal is the\ndetermination that Mitchell has not alleged a physical\ninjury. Mitchell, however, argues that the allegations in his\nconditions-of-confinement claim -- that he was deprived of\nfood, drink, and sleep for four days -- describe physical\ninjuries. Moreover, he contends that any physical injury,\nhowever minor, satisfies S 1997e(e) because that statutory\nsection contains no requirement that the injury be more\nthan de minimis. We hold that Mitchell has not stated a\nclaim for physical injury, but grant him leave to amend his\ncomplaint in order to do so. We also agree with other\ncircuits that have read 1997e(e) to require more than a de\nminimis physical injury before an emotional injury may be\nalleged.\n\n1. The Scope of S 1997e(e)\n\nSection 1997e(e)’s requirement that a prisoner\ndemonstrate physical injury before he can recover for\nmental or emotional injury applies only to claims for\ncompensatory damages. Claims seeking nominal or punitive\ndamages are typically not \"for\" mental or emotional injury\nbut rather \"to vindicate constitutional rights\" or \"to deter or\npunish egregious violations of constitutional rights,\"\nrespectively. See Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247, 252 (3d\nCir. 2000). Accordingly, regardless how we construe\nS 1997e(e)’s physical injury requirement, it will not affect\nMitchell’s ability to seek nominal or punitive damages for\nviolations of his constitutional rights.8\n\nWe also agree with several other courts of appeals that\n\fS 1997e(e) does not apply to claims seeking injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief.9 See Thompson v. Carter, 284 F.3d 411,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Mitchell’s complaint specifically requests punitive damages but not\nnominal damages. As for the latter, however, \"it is not necessary to allege\nnominal damages.\" Allah, 226 F.3d at 251 (quoting Basista v. Weir, 340\nF.2d 74, 87 (3d Cir. 1965)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover,\nMitchell’s complaint seeks \"other relief as it may appear the plaintiff is\nentitled.\" We construe this \"catch-all\" prayer broadly to include a request\nfor nominal damages. Furthermore, he has requested nominal damages\nin this appeal.\n9. We express no opinion, however, as to whether Mitchell has standing\nto bring a claim for equitable relief in light of the requirement,\nenunciated in Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983), that a\nplaintiff seeking equitable relief demonstrate that his injury is likely to\nbe repeated.\n\n                                 13\n\n\n418 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"Section 1997e(e) does not prevent a\nprisoner from obtaining injunctive or declaratory relief.\");\nHarris v. Garner, 190 F.3d 1279, 1288 (11th Cir. 1999),\nvacated and reh’g en banc granted, 197 F.3d 1059 (11th\nCir. 1999), reinstated in part on reh’g, 216 F.3d 970 (11th\nCir. 2000) (en banc), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1065 (2001)\n(same); Harper v. Showers, 174 F.3d. 716, 719 (5th Cir.\n1999) (same); Perkins v. Kan. Dep’t of Corr., 165 F.3d 803,\n808 (10th Cir. 1999) (same); Davis v. Dist. of Columbia, 158\nF.3d 1342, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (same); Zehner v. Trigg,\n133 F.3d 459, 462-63 (7th Cir. 1997) (same). Again, such\nclaims seek not to remedy mental injury suffered but rather\nrelief from ongoing or future constitutional violations.\nMoreover, S 1997e(e)’s reference to remedies for mental\ninjuries \"suffered\" -- in the past tense-- implies that it\ndoes not restrict prospective equitable relief. See Harris,\n190 F.3d at 1288; Davis, 158 F.3d at 1346. 10\n\n2. Physical injury requirement\n\nThe Commonwealth argues that Mitchell’s allegations\nthat he was deprived of food, drink, and sleep for four days\ndo not describe a physical injury. Mitchell counters that\nphysical injury -- including starvation, dehydration,\nunconsciousness, pain, and hypoglycemia -- follow\ninevitably from the conditions he alleges, and that he\nshould not be penalized for inartful pleading. He notes also\nthat his complaint alleged that these deprivations placed\nhis \"life and health in jeopardy.\" Finally, he argues that, if\nnecessary, he could easily amend his complaint to state\nphysical injuries.\n\nLoss of food, water, and sleep are not themselves physical\ninjuries. However, physical injuries could result from such\ndeprivation after four days. While no physical injuries were\nalleged in Mitchell’s complaint, to the extent that they can\nbe included in good faith in an amended complaint,\nMitchell is permitted that opportunity to amend.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f10. We also observe that, apart from his claims for mental injury,\nMitchell seeks damages for loss of \"status, custody level and any chance\nat commutation.\" These requests -- unrelated to mental injury -- are not\naffected by S 1997e(e)’s requirements.\n\n                                14\n\n\n3. The de minimis standard\n\nIf in an amended complaint Mitchell sufficiently alleges\nphysical injury, an additional issue occurs: under\nS 1997e(e), must that physical injury be more than de\nminimis before he can assert emotional injury? As this is a\nquestion of statutory interpretation, it is subject to plenary\nreview. See Gibbs v. Cross, 160 F.3d 962, 964 (3d Cir.\n1998).\n\nOther courts of appeals have read 1997e(e) to require a\nless-than-significant-but-more-than-de minimis physical\ninjury as a predicate to allowing the successful pleading of\nan emotional injury. See Oliver v. Keller, 289 F.3d 623,\n626-28 (9th Cir. 2002); Harris, 190 F.3d at 1286-87 (11th\nCir.); Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193-94 (5th Cir.\n1997).11 In Siglar, the Fifth Circuit based its holding on the\nfact that the Circuit’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence\nrequires more than a de minimis, but not a significant,\nphysical injury. Siglar, 112 F.3d at 193. The Eleventh\nCircuit in Harris followed Siglar. The Harris Court also\nfound significant that, in enacting 1997e(e), Congress\nsought to curtail frivolous prisoner litigation. Reading\n1997e(e) to find any allegation of physical injury sufficient\nwould \"undermine the statute’s essential purpose.\" Harris,\n190 F.3d at 1286. It would also make \"no sense in light of\nour basic understanding that ‘routine discomfort is part of\nthe penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses\nagainst society.’ \" Id. (quoting Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S.\n1, 9 (1992)). The Oliver Court reached the same conclusion,\nbut rejected the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits’ reliance on\nEighth Amendment jurisprudence.12Oliver, 289 F.3d at\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The Ninth Circuit stated in Oliver, 289 F.3d at 627, that the Second\nCircuit has also adopted the de minimis standard in Liner v. Goord, 196\nF.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 1999), when the latter court wrote: \"Certainly, the\nalleged sexual assaults would constitute more than de minimis injury if\nthey occurred. Cf. Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997)\n(relying on Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, court holds that physical\ninjury required by S 1997e(e) must simply be more than de minimis).\"\nHowever, we do not read this statement as adopting any particular\nstandard, de minimis or otherwise.\n12. The Court concluded that the Fifth Circuit did not accurately\ndescribe the Eighth Amendment standard set out in Hudson v. McMillian,\n503 U.S. 1 (1992), which requires more than de minimis physical force\n-- not more than de minimis physical injury -- to state an Eighth\nAmendment claim.\n\n                                15\n\f628. Rather, Oliver found persuasive that Congress\nintended to reduce the volume of frivolous prisoner suits,\nid. at 627-28, and rejected the notion that 1997e(e)’s plain\nmeaning is clear, see id. at 628 n.6.\n\nTwo canons of statutory construction drive our analysis.\nFirst, \"the starting point for interpreting a statute is the\nlanguage of the statute itself.\" Smith v. Fid. Consumer Disc.\nCo., 898 F.2d 907, 909 (3d Cir. 1990) (quoting Consumer\nProd. Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102,\n108 (1980)). We do not look past the plain meaning unless\nit produces a result \"demonstrably at odds with the\nintentions of its drafters,\" BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp.,\n511 U.S. 531, 563 (1994) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), or an outcome \"so bizarre that Congress could not\nhave intended it,\" Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U.S. 184,\n191 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, we\nattempt to ascribe meaning to each statutory provision.\nNewmark v. Principi, 283 F.3d 172, 176 (3d Cir. 2002) (\"It\nis incumbent upon courts to read each statutory provision\nas having meaning, and to construe the statute so the\n‘meaning of each word inform[s] the others and all in their\naggregate tak[e] their purport from the setting in which they\nare used.’ \") (quoting U.S. Nat’l Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins.\nAgents of Am., 508 U.S. 439, 454 (1993)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (alterations in original).\n\nWe believe that reading 1997e(e) to allow a plaintiff to\nallege any physical injury, no matter how minor, would\nproduce an unintended (indeed absurd) result. Were we not\nto read 1997(e) as requiring more than a de minimis\nphysical injury, we would turn its physical injury\nprerequisite into a mere pleading requirement, thereby\nrendering the requirement meaningless as a practical\nmatter. Another prisoner might be able to assert an\nemotional injury by pleading that he received a paper cut,\nfor example. This result runs counter to Congress’s intent\n\"to curtail frivolous and abusive prisoner litigation.\" Harris,\n190 F.3d at 1286 (quoting Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d\n1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 1998)); see 141 Cong. Rec. S7525\n(daily ed. May 25, 1995) (statement of Senator Dole). In so\ndoing, Congress noted that, \"unlike physical injuries,\nemotional injuries are inherently difficult to verify and\n\n                                16\n\n\ntherefore tend to be concocted for frivolous suits.\" Dawes v.\nWalker, 239 F.3d 489, 496 (2d Cir. 2001) (Walker, J.). On\nthe other hand, we do not adopt a test that would prevent\nthose experiencing real physical injury at the hands of\ngovernment officials from pursuing their rights. We\ntherefore follow the approach of the Fifth, Ninth, and\nEleventh Circuits in requiring a less-than-significant-but-\nmore-than-de minimis physical injury as a predicate to\nallegations of emotional injury.13\n\nBecause this case has come to us at the pleading stage,\nand because Mitchell’s complaint does not specifically\n\fdescribe the extent of his physical injuries, we are not able\nto determine whether his injuries are more than de\nminimis. Thus, the District Court will need to address on\nremand this question as well. Mitchell’s amending his\ncomplaint to allege more specifically the physical injuries\nhe suffered might facilitate this inquiry.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nMitchell has exhausted the available administrative\nremedies on his conditions-of-confinement claim as\nrequired by S 1997e(a) and has stated a nonfrivolous\nretaliation claim. On remand, the District Court should also\ndetermine whether Mitchell has been subjected to\"atypical\nand significant hardship\" implicating a protected liberty\ninterest that triggers due process rights at his disciplinary\nhearing, and, if so, whether those rights were violated.\nFinally, he is given the opportunity to amend his complaint\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Our requirement of more than de minimis physical injury for\nS 1997e(e) claims is not based on an analogy to Eighth Amendment\njurisprudence, as is true in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits. See Harris,\n190 F.3d at 1286-87; Siglar, 112 F.3d at 193. Section 1997e(e)’s\nrequirement is not limited to suits alleging Eighth Amendment violations.\nSee, e.g., Thompson, 284 F.3d at 415-17 (due process claim); Allah, 226\nF.3d at 250 (First Amendment claim). Thus, while in Smith v. Mensinger,\n293 F.3d 641 (3d Cir. 2002), we refused to apply a more-than-de\nminimis-injury requirement in the Eighth Amendment context -- holding\ninstead that the Eighth Amendment was triggered by more than de\nminimis force -- that holding does not inform our analysis of the\n1997e(e) issue here.\n\n                                17\n\n\nto allege physical injury within the meaning ofS 1997e(e). If\nhis amended complaint alleges physical injury, the District\nCourt must determine whether it is more than de minimis\nas a predicate to asserting emotional injury. In this context,\nwe reverse the District Court’s dismissal of the complaint\nand remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with\nthis opinion.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                18\n\f",

He\nalleges that a correctional officer planted contraband near\n\fhis locker because he filed complaints against that officer,\nthat he was denied a fair hearing on the contraband\ncharges, and that, as a result, he was placed in disciplinary\nconfinement for several months, including four days in a\ncell that was smeared with feces and infested with flies and\nin which he could not eat, drink, or sleep. The District\nCourt dismissed Mitchell’s complaint sua sponte the day it\nwas filed without requiring service on the defendants.

During the\nsearch, they found a folded brown paper napkin containing\ndrugs and U.S. currency taped under Mitchell’s locker.\nMitchell denied owning or knowing about the contraband,\nand his urinalysis tested negative for drugs. At the security\noffice, Mitchell asked a correctional officer to preserve the\ntape that had affixed the contraband under his locker so\nthat it could be fingerprinted. Although Mitchell offered to\npay for the fingerprint analysis, the prison denied his\nrequest. Pending a hearing on the contraband charges,\nprison officials placed him in the Restricted Housing Unit\n(\"RHU\").\n\nThe next day, prison officials brought Mitchell to the\ninstitution’s security unit for questioning. Lieutenant\nKowalski told Mitchell that he had information suggesting\nthat Officer Ronald Wilson, the officer regularly assigned to\nthe Drug and Alcohol Unit, framed Mitchell. Mitchell\nconcurred that he had been set up and again requested\nfingerprint testing to prove his innocence. Kowalski offered\nto look into the matter, and Mitchell was returned to the\nRHU.\n\nTwo days after the officers discovered the contraband,\nMitchell was called to a disciplinary hearing, in preparation\nfor which he was permitted five minutes to confer with an\ninmate assistant. During the hearing, Mitchell argued that\nsomeone had set him up. He noted that the area in which\nthe officers found the contraband was easily accessible to\nothers, requested that the hearing examiner inquire when\nthat area had last been searched, and asked again for a\nfingerprint test. His requests were denied. Finding Mitchell\nguilty of contraband charges and of lying to a prison\nemployee, the hearing examiner sentenced him to ninety\ndays in disciplinary custody.\n\fFollowing proper procedure, Mitchell appealed the\nhearing examiner’s verdict first to the Program Review\nCommittee, then to the prison superintendent, and finally\nto the chief counsel. Each appeal was denied. During the\npendency of these appeals, Mitchell was relocated to a cell\nnormally used to house mentally ill inmates. The cell had\n\"human waste smeared on the walls\" and was\"infested\n\n                                3\n\n\nwith flies.\" At night, \"kicking and banging on the doors by\nthe other inmates\" kept Mitchell awake.\n\nMitchell complained to prison officials about his\nconditions to no avail. He sought to file an administrative\ngrievance protesting the conditions of his confinement, but\nprison officials denied him an inmate grievance form.\nPrison regulations provide that a grievance form is\"the\nproper form to be used for submission of a grievance and\nit should be completed according to the directions\nprovided.\" Commonwealth of Pa., Dep’t of Corr.,\nConsolidated Inmate Grievance Review System, Policy\nStatement DC-ADM 804 V(B) (Oct. 20, 1994). Additionally,\ninmate grievances must be \"in writing and in the format\nprovided on the forms supplied by the institution.\" Id.\n804(VI)(A)(1) (internal citation omitted). After four days,\nduring which Mitchell alleges he did not eat, drink, or\nsleep, the Program Review Committee, in the course of\nfulfilling its mandate to \"interview all disciplinary custody\ncases every thirty (30) days,\" Commonwealth of Pa., Dep’t of\nCorr., Inmate Disciplinary and Restricted Housing\nProcedures, Policy Statement DC-ADM 801 VI(D)(9) (Sept.\n20, 1994), confirmed that his cell was unfit for human\nhabitation. He was transferred to Huntingdon Correctional\nInstitution on December 4, 1996.1\n\nIn January 1998, Mitchell returned to Graterford to face\ncriminal drug-possession charges stemming from the\nOctober 5, 1996 contraband incident and was again placed\nin the RHU. At a preliminary hearing held after Mitchell’s\nreturn to Graterford, all criminal charges against Mitchell\nwere dismissed. Nonetheless, Graterford officials kept him\nsegregated in the RHU for another two months, explaining\nthat his return to the general Graterford population was\n\"not an option.\" After numerous complaints, Mitchell was\ntransferred back to Huntingdon on April 1, 1998.\n\nOn September 29, 1998, Mitchell filed the current\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In early 1997, Mitchell filed a \"private complaint\" against Officer\nWilson, whom he accused of planting contraband under his locker. The\nrecord does not reflect how or even whether this private complaint was\nresolved.\n\n                                4\n\fEastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that: (1) Officer\nWilson planted contraband in retaliation for Mitchell’s\ncomplaints against him, in violation of his First, Fifth, and\nEighth Amendment rights; (2) prison officials denied\nMitchell adequate time to confer with his inmate assistant,\ndenied him the opportunity to present a meaningful\ndefense, and failed adequately to investigate his allegations\nthat the charges against him were fabricated, all in\nviolation of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights; (3) prison officials placed Mitchell in a cell unfit for\nhuman habitation, in violation of his Eighth Amendment\nrights; and (4) as a result of these violations, Mitchell\nsuffered, inter alia, emotional trauma, fear, and shock, and\nlost his status and any chance of commutation. As noted,\nthe District Court dismissed his complaint the day it was\nfiled. The Court dismissed as frivolous Mitchell’s retaliation\ncharge, which it held did not state a violation of his\nconstitutional rights, and his due process claim, on the\nground that Mitchell’s confinement did not implicate a\nliberty interest. The District Court also held that Mitchell\nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect\nto his Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement claim\nand dismissed that claim without prejudice. Finally, the\nDistrict Court held that Mitchell could not bring a claim for\nemotional trauma without a prior showing of physical\ninjury.\n\nThis timely appeal followed. Because the District Court\ndismissed this case before the defendant was served, the\ndefendant -- Commissioner of the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Corrections -- was not technically a party to\nthis suit. Therefore, we requested that the Commonwealth\nof Pennsylvania file a brief as amicus curiae. 2\n\nII.

Under the circumstances, his Eighth\nAmendment conditions-of-confinement claim is appealable\nas well.

While\nMitchell has not clearly declared his intention to stand on\nhis complaint, the defect for which the District Court\ndismissed Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement\n\fclaim -- failure to exhaust available administrative\nremedies -- is no longer curable. See Booth , 206 F.3d at\n293 n.3. It has been six years since the events resulting in\nthis appeal, and prison regulations allowed Mitchell only\nfifteen days \"after the events upon which the claims are\nbased\" to file a grievance. DC-ADM 804 VI(B)(2).\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nThis case raises four questions, which we address in the\nfollowing order: (1) whether Mitchell exhausted the available\nadministrative remedies on his Eighth Amendment\nconditions-of-confinement claim; (2) is his retaliation claim\nfrivolous; (3) whether his due process claim is frivolous;\nand (4) has Mitchell alleged a physical injury sufficient to\nsupport his emotional injury claims.

Exhaustion\n\nBefore filing suit, prisoners must exhaust their available\nadministrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a). 3 The\n\"availability of administrative remedies to a prisoner is a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a) provides that \"[n]o action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other\nFederal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other\ncorrectional facility until such administrative remedies as are available\nare exhausted.\"\n\n                                6\n\n\nquestion of law,\" which we review de novo. Ray, 285 F.3d\nat 291.\n\nThe District Court dismissed Mitchell’s conditions-of-\nconfinement claim, which asserts that he spent four days in\na filthy cell in which he could not eat, drink, or sleep,\nbecause he \"does not allege that he filed any grievances\nregarding the conditions of his cell.\" Mitchell argues that he\ndid not file a grievance because prison officials denied him\nthe necessary grievance forms and, as a result, he lacked\n\"available\" administrative remedies. The Commonwealth\nconcedes this point. Accord Miller v. Norris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772958\"><a href=\"/opinion/772958/james-miller-v-larry-norris-director-arkansas-department-of-correction/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n740 (8th Cir. 2001) (\"[A] remedy that prison officials prevent\na prisoner from ‘utiliz[ing]’ is not an‘available’ remedy\nunder S 1997e(a) . . . .\") (alterations in original).\n\nEven absent the prison’s precluding Mitchell’s grievance,\nthe District Court erred procedurally. Failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies is an affirmative defense for the\ndefendant to plead. Ray, 285 F.3d at 295. Under 1997e(c)\nfailure to exhaust is not a permissible basis for sua sponte\ndismissal. Id. at 295-96. The defendants in this case were\nnot served and therefore have not pled failure to exhaust or\n\fany other defense. Thus, even if Mitchell failed to exhaust\nhis available remedies (excused, as the Commonwealth\nconcedes, by the failure to provide grievance forms), the\nDistrict Court was premature in dismissing his complaint.\n\nB. Retaliation claim\n\nThe District Court dismissed as frivolous Mitchell’s\nretaliation claim -- that Officer Wilson planted illegal drugs\nunder Mitchell’s locker in retaliation for Mitchell’s\ncomplaints against him -- reasoning that \"[t]he filing of a\nfalse or unfounded misconduct charge against an inmate\ndoes not constitute a deprivation of a constitutional right.\"\n\nTo be frivolous, a claim must rely on an \"indisputably\nmeritless legal theory\" or a \"clearly baseless\" or \"fantastic or\ndelusional\" factual scenario.

Moreover, he contends that any physical injury,\nhowever minor, satisfies S 1997e(e) because that statutory\nsection contains no requirement that the injury be more\nthan de minimis. We hold that Mitchell has not stated a\nclaim for physical injury, but grant him leave to amend his\ncomplaint in order to do so. We also agree with other\ncircuits that have read 1997e(e) to require more than a de\nminimis physical injury before an emotional injury may be\nalleged.\n\n1. The Scope of S 1997e(e)\n\nSection 1997e(e)’s requirement that a prisoner\ndemonstrate physical injury before he can recover for\nmental or emotional injury applies only to claims for\ncompensatory damages. Claims seeking nominal or punitive\ndamages are typically not \"for\" mental or emotional injury\nbut rather \"to vindicate constitutional rights\" or \"to deter or\npunish egregious violations of constitutional rights,\"\nrespectively. See Allah v. Al-Hafeez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770376\"><a href=\"/opinion/770376/michael-malik-allah-minister-khalil-wali-muhammad-michael-malik-allah-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252 (3d\nCir. 2000). Accordingly, regardless how we construe\nS 1997e(e)’s physical injury requirement, it will not affect\nMitchell’s ability to seek nominal or punitive damages for\nviolations of his constitutional rights.8\n\nWe also agree with several other courts of appeals that\n\fS 1997e(e) does not apply to claims seeking injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief.9 See Thompson v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776987\"><a href=\"/opinion/776987/louis-thompson-v-j-carter-correctional-officer-clinton-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Mitchell’s complaint specifically requests punitive damages but not\nnominal damages. As for the latter, however, \"it is not necessary to allege\nnominal damages.\" Allah, 226 F.3d at 251 (quoting Basista v. Weir, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"266463\"><a href=\"/opinion/266463/frank-basista-v-walter-weir-chief-of-police-city-of-duquesne-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (3d Cir. 1965)) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Again, such\nclaims seek not to remedy mental injury suffered but rather\nrelief from ongoing or future constitutional violations.\nMoreover, S 1997e(e)’s reference to remedies for mental\ninjuries \"suffered\" -- in the past tense-- implies that it\ndoes not restrict prospective equitable relief. See Harris,\n190 F.3d at 1288; Davis, 158 F.3d at 1346. 10\n\n2. Physical injury requirement\n\nThe Commonwealth argues that Mitchell’s allegations\nthat he was deprived of food, drink, and sleep for four days\ndo not describe a physical injury. Mitchell counters that\nphysical injury -- including starvation, dehydration,\nunconsciousness, pain, and hypoglycemia -- follow\ninevitably from the conditions he alleges, and that he\nshould not be penalized for inartful pleading. He notes also\nthat his complaint alleged that these deprivations placed\nhis \"life and health in jeopardy.\" Finally, he argues that, if\nnecessary, he could easily amend his complaint to state\nphysical injuries.\n\nLoss of food, water, and sleep are not themselves physical\ninjuries. However, physical injuries could result from such\ndeprivation after four days. While no physical injuries were\nalleged in Mitchell’s complaint, to the extent that they can\nbe included in good faith in an amended complaint,\nMitchell is permitted that opportunity to amend.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f10. We also observe that, apart from his claims for mental injury,\nMitchell seeks damages for loss of \"status, custody level and any chance\nat commutation.\" These requests -- unrelated to mental injury -- are not\naffected by S 1997e(e)’s requirements.\n\n                                14\n\n\n3. The de minimis standard\n\nIf in an amended complaint Mitchell sufficiently alleges\nphysical injury, an additional issue occurs: under\nS 1997e(e), must that physical injury be more than de\nminimis before he can assert emotional injury? As this is a\nquestion of statutory interpretation, it is subject to plenary\nreview. See Gibbs v. Cross, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759234\"><a href=\"/opinion/759234/henry-gibbs-jr-v-officer-paul-cross-maintenance-supervisor/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 964 (3d Cir.\n1998).\n\nOther courts of appeals have read 1997e(e) to require a\nless-than-significant-but-more-than-de minimis physical\ninjury as a predicate to allowing the successful pleading of\nan emotional injury. See Oliver v. Keller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777593\"><a href=\"/opinion/777593/eric-d-oliver-v-jerry-keller-sheriff-kyle-edwards-dave-swiekert/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n626-28 (9th Cir. 2002); Harris, 190 F.3d at 1286-87 (11th\nCir.); Siglar v.

Siglar, 112 F.3d at 193. The Eleventh\nCircuit in Harris followed Siglar. The Harris Court also\nfound significant that, in enacting 1997e(e), Congress\nsought to curtail frivolous prisoner litigation. Reading\n1997e(e) to find any allegation of physical injury sufficient\nwould \"undermine the statute’s essential purpose.\" Harris,\n190 F.3d at 1286. It would also make \"no sense in light of\nour basic understanding that ‘routine discomfort is part of\nthe penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses\nagainst society.’ \" Id.

Another prisoner might be able to assert an\nemotional injury by pleading that he received a paper cut,\nfor example.

In so\ndoing, Congress noted that, \"unlike physical injuries,\nemotional injuries are inherently difficult to verify and\n\n                                16\n\n\ntherefore tend to be concocted for frivolous suits.\" Dawes v.\nWalker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771990\"><a href=\"/opinion/771990/ian-dawes-v-hans-walker-superintendent-auburn-correctional-facility/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496 (2d Cir. 2001) (Walker, J.). On\nthe other hand, we do not adopt a test that would prevent\nthose experiencing real physical injury at the hands of\ngovernment officials from pursuing their rights. We\ntherefore follow the approach of the Fifth, Ninth, and\nEleventh Circuits in requiring a less-than-significant-but-\nmore-than-de minimis physical injury as a predicate to\nallegations of emotional injury.13\n\nBecause this case has come to us at the pleading stage,\nand because Mitchell’s complaint does not specifically\n\fdescribe the extent of his physical injuries, we are not able\nto determine whether his injuries are more than de\nminimis. Thus, the District Court will need to address on\nremand this question as well. Mitchell’s amending his\ncomplaint to allege more specifically the physical injuries\nhe suffered might facilitate this inquiry.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nMitchell has exhausted the available administrative\nremedies on his conditions-of-confinement claim as\nrequired by S 1997e(a) and has stated a nonfrivolous\nretaliation claim. On remand, the District Court should also\ndetermine whether Mitchell has been subjected to\"atypical\nand significant hardship\" implicating a protected liberty\ninterest that triggers due process rights at his disciplinary\nhearing, and, if so, whether those rights were violated.\nFinally, he is given the opportunity to amend his complaint\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Our requirement of more than de minimis physical injury for\nS 1997e(e) claims is not based on an analogy to Eighth Amendment\njurisprudence, as is true in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits. See Harris,\n190 F.3d at 1286-87; Siglar, 112 F.3d at 193. Section 1997e(e)’s\nrequirement is not limited to suits alleging Eighth Amendment violations.\nSee, e.g., Thompson, 284 F.3d at 415-17 (due process claim); Allah, 226\nF.3d at 250 (First Amendment claim). Thus, while in Smith v. Mensinger,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778006\"><a href=\"/opinion/778006/carl-m-smith-v-robin-mensinger-david-novitsky-jerome-paulukonis-mary/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2002), we refused to apply a more-than-de\nminimis-injury requirement in the Eighth Amendment context -- holding\ninstead that the Eighth Amendment was triggered by more than de\nminimis force -- that holding does not inform our analysis of the\n1997e(e) issue here.\n\n                                17\n\n\nto allege physical injury within the meaning ofS 1997e(e). If\nhis amended complaint alleges physical injury, the District\nCourt must determine whether it is more than de minimis\nas a predicate to asserting emotional injury.
