In order for the court to able to locate\n\nthe place in the record cited in this brief, Appellant will refer to the Clerk’s\n\nRecord filed on July 2, 2015 as 1 CR and the one filed on July 29, 2015 as\n\n2 CR.\n\n        This is an election contest case. It is therefore to be expedited by this\n\nCourt. Tex. Elec. Code § 231.009. App.30. Appellant asserted below that\n\nthe Travis County Clerk failed to comply with state law to maintain image of\n\na ballot and there were so many mistakes and irregularities and illegal\n\nvotes counted and legal votes not counted that, although the exact vote\n\nchange is not capable of proof, nevertheless the Court should invalidate the\n\nelection because the true outcome of the election cannot be ascertained,\n\nTex. Elec. Code § 221.003. (1 CR 862). App.22.\n\n        The trial court granted Appellee’s No Evidence Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment and entered a final judgment. (1 CR 4605; App.1) Appellant filed\n\na Notice of Accelerated Appeal.(1 CR 5224; App.4) Subsequently, on June\n\n\n                                      Page 3\n\f24, 2015, the trial court entered an order that stated it was an amended\n\norder, but omitted a Mother Hubbard clause or a declaration that it was\n\nfinal, and stated it was going to award sanctions against Pressley and her\n\nattorney David Rogers. 2 CR 2060; App.2. Out of an abundance of caution,\n\nPressley filed an amended Notice of Appeal including the June, 24, 2015\n\norder. 2 CR 2062. App.5. After the hearings on the Third amendment to\n\nthe original Sanctions Motion, Suppl. IV CR 16, that had been filed before\n\nthe first final judgment on May 26, 2015, the Court entered another\n\njudgment on July 23, 2015 Suppl. IV CR 52, App.3 that granted Casar’s\n\nNo Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment, assessed sanctions based on\n\nCasar’s attorney fees in the amount of $90,000 ($50,000 against\n\nAppellant’s attorney and $40,000 against Appellant) and an additional\n\nsanction award in the event of an unsuccessful appeal, First Suppl. IV CR\n\n52; App.3. The trial court entered a separate order awarding sanctions\n\nsupported by findings of fact and conclusions of law. Suppl. IV CR 19.\n\nApp.3. Appellant filed a request for additional and amended findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law. Suppl. III CR 45; App.6. Appellant filed a Second\n\nAmended Notice of Appeal. Suppl. III CR 38. App.8. The trial court made\n\namended findings of fact and conclusions of law, Second Suppl. IV CR 3\n\nfiled on August 14, 2015; App.7.\n\n\n                                   Page 4\n\f               STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n        This case warrants and indeed demands that the Court order oral\n\nargument which is hereby requested.\n\n        This case is one of first impression as to whether an election can be\n\ndetermined by counting cast vote records only without maintaining an\n\nimage of what the electronic voting system formats as a ballot despite state\n\nlaw requiring it to do so. If a cast vote record alone is held not to constitute\n\na ballot that can be counted, other election officials in the state using\n\nelectronic voting systems may be required to modify their equipment and\n\nprocedures to comply with the Election Code. Therefore, the issues and\n\nfacts in this case need to be presented orally and the attorney’s permitted\n\nto address the Court’s concerns regarding this complicated and important\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 5\n\f                         STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n     Appellant Pressley sued to set aside the results of the run-off election\n\nfor Place 4 on the Austin City Council. CR 860.\n\n     The County Clerk determined the outcome of the election at the\n\nRecount by counting cast vote records (“CVRs”). 1 CR 1983, lines 8 - 2 5 ,\n\nand 1 CR 1984, lines 1-11.             CVRs do not have the elements of a\n\nballot required by the Texas Constitution and Texas Election Code.\n\n(Compare the appearance of a paper ballot 1 CR 1805, 2 CR 2058, and 1\n\nCR 1927, lines 14-18 with the CVR 1 CR 1803 and Ballot by Mail 2 CR\n\n2058). The Hart electronic voting system, used in the election, formats the\n\nelectronic ballot a Travis County voter sees when he votes that satisfies\n\nmost of the statutory requirements of a ballot. 1 CR 1925, line 22 to 1928,\n\nline 24; 1 CR 1805; 2 CR 2058; (2 CR 7334, lines 16 and 17. These ballot\n\nimages were not maintained by the Clerk for the run-off election (1 CR\n\n1925, line 22 to 1928, line 24; 2 CR 7333, 2 CR 2058) except for the run-off\n\nmail in ballots which were retained. The result of the mail in ballots was a\n\ntie. (2 CR 3074 column “BBM [Ballot by Mail]”; 1 CR 1938, line 23 to 1939,\n\nline 4) There were numerous “Invalid/Corrupt MBB [Mobile Ballot Box]\n\nerrors. 1 CR 2118, 2135, 2136, 2139, 2140, 2142, 2155 and 2 CR 1880,\n\n1897, 1898, 1901, 1902, 1904, 1917. The MBB are the Hart voting system\n\n\n                                   Page 6\n\fflash memory cards that stores votes as CVRs. 1 CR 2196, 1 CR 2203\n\nand there were more Invalid/Corrupt MBBs than the County Clerk had seen\n\nin all her years of conducting elections 1 CR 1978, lines 9-20; the “reader”\n\ntallying the votes was broken 1 CR 1979, lines 4-5; also security seals of\n\nthe voting machines were broken and had to be resealed 1 CR 917, 922,\n\n923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 929, 930.\n\n     The Hart voting system computer, which tallies the electronic votes,\n\nthe CVRs, was left open on several occasions and for extended periods of\n\ntime during the election and recount CR 1876, 2 CR 1883, 2 CR 1932, 2\n\nCR 1932.\n\n     The County Clerk did not believe the Tally Audit Logs which recorded\n\nand tabulated the MBB results and all of the other events in the election in\n\norder to verify the results were reliable 1 CR 1995, lines 7-13. In addition,\n\nthe County Clerk ordered her employees not to print Result/Tally tapes on\n\nthe day of the run–off election (1 CR 1865) as required by the Secretary of\n\nState (2 CR 707, 711, 726, 734). Appellant was told that election backup\n\ntapes, Zero tapes and Results/Tally tapes would not be printed on the day\n\nof the election by Mr. Winn, the Clerk’s Director of Elections; 1 CR 872, ¶\n\n42; 874, ¶ 48. Images of the ballots cast were missing; 1 CR 1982, lines\n\n19-21; A statistical analysis of the reported results of the run-off election\n\n\n                                     Page 7\n\findicated that the electronic tabulated results may not be believable (1 CR\n\n861, ¶ 3, 1 CR 863, ¶ 10, 1 CR 865 ¶ 17 through 868 ¶ 26, 1 CR 933-936).\n\nDuring the Recount, the County Clerk’s employees refused to allow the poll\n\nwatchers to witness the whole process of the printing of the CVRs from the\n\ntally computer. 2 CR 7602. Specifically, Appellant and her official Recount\n\nWatchers were not allowed to monitor the integrity of where the CVRs were\n\nretrieved, the source where the retrieval occurred, or the copying of the\n\nCVR files to an aggregated .pdf file. 1 CR 886 ¶ 93-96; 1 CR 1807\n\n      There were other irregularities and mistakes made in the conduct of\n\nthis election.   Although Appellant’s phone bank received reports from\n\nvoters who were angry that the voting locations were moved from the\n\ngeneral election locations and did not vote, and a statistical analysis was\n\ndone that showed voters from District 4 who were “die-hard voters” who\n\nconsistently voted did not vote in this run-off (2 Suppl. RR 99, line 10\n\nthrough 100 line 22.) When no one wanted to get involved as a witness\n\nshowing a disenfranchising affect the change in voting locations had on\n\nthem and the Clerk in discovery at least had some evidence the new\n\nlocations were posted at the old locations, Appellant amended her pleading\n\n(1 CR 860) and dropped the change in voting locations as a mistake that\n\n\n\n\n                                  Page 8\n\fmay have affected the outcome of the election. 2 Suppl. RR 88, lines 6\n\nthrough 100.\n\n      The only property that Pressley had that could be subject to\n\nexecution to recover a sanctions award was $1,000.00. All other property\n\nowned by Pressley was either membership interests in an LLC, which\n\ncannot be seized or its assets used because they belong to an independent\n\nlegal entity, or in her husband’s bank account and retirement account. 2\n\nSuppl. R.R. 65, line 12 through 66, line 19.\n\n      All facts Pressley alleged in her pleading were true.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 9\n\f                     SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n\n     This case challenges the failure to follow Election Code provision in\n\nthe conduct of an Austin City Council election. Because the Clerk did not\n\nmaintain images of ballots and counted only CVRs all votes except mail-in\n\nballots which were tied were counted illegally.      In addition there were\n\nnumerous other irregularities, mistakes and violations of the Election Code\n\nthat could lawfully allow a court to decide it was impossible to ascertain the\n\ntrue outcome of the election. For either reason supported by summary\n\njudgment evidence, the trial court committed reversible error by granting\n\nthe no evidence summary judgment and imposing sanctions for raising\n\nsuch issues.\n\n     In addition, at the request of counsel for Appellant the trial court hand\n\nwrote in the first judgment it entered that the judgment disposed of all the\n\nissues between all of the parties. Counsel for Appellee consented to and\n\nagreed to this language being inserted into the first judgment. The trial\n\ncourt then approved of this agreement and signed the first final judgment.\n\nTherefore, the parties read into the record in open court that the issue of\n\nwhether sanctions should be imposed had been resolved by agreement\n\nsatisfying the requirements of the Tex. R. Civ. P., Rule 11, and the later\n\n\n\n                                   Page 10\n\factions taken related to sanctions violated Rule 11 and it was reversible\n\nerror to impose sanctions. There was another “order” entered within the\n\ncourt’s plenary power but it did not satisfy requirements for extending its\n\nplenary jurisdiction. The last judgment entered by the court which imposed\n\nsanctions was entered after expiration of its plenary power. This means\n\nthat the only final Judgment in this case is the first one and the only issue is\n\nwhether the trial court erred in granting Appellee’s No Evidence Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.        By arguing the sanctions issues Appellant is not\n\nwaiving the argument that the only valid final judgment did not impose\n\nsanctions and sanction were barred by the Rule 11.\n\n      In addition, the trial court erroneously deprived Appellant of discovery\n\nto which she was entitled and without examining the documents claimed to\n\nbe exempt as “Proprietary” thereby preventing Pressley from obtaining\n\nevidence crucial and relevant to her claims and then ruled there was no\n\nevidence without even reading the evidence attached to the Opposition to\n\nthe Motion The trial court’s failure to follow accepted process for producing\n\nproprietary evidence and its failure to read the evidence attached to the\n\nopposition to the motion before granting a No Evidence Motion was an\n\narbitrary abuse of discretion and caused reversible error.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 11\n\f     Appellant provided enough evidence in opposition to Appellee’s No\n\nEvidence Motion for Summary Judgment to require that it be denied. A\n\ncanvass of an election can be overturned if the court cannot ascertain the\n\ntrue outcome of the election because of illegal conduct, inaccuracies or\n\nmistakes. It can also be overturned if illegal votes were counted. In this\n\ncase there was evidence of many irregularities that if taken as true could\n\nlead a court to validly exercise its discretion to determine it cannot\n\nascertain the true outcome of the election.\n\n     The Election Code requires that images of the ballots be preserved\n\nand counted in a manual recount. It is undisputed that images of the ballots\n\nvoters see when deciding who to vote for were not maintained or available\n\nfor the recount. Despite evidence presented in opposition to the No\n\nEvidence Motion for Summary Judgment showing that a CVR did not have\n\nany of the items on it that the Election Code required a ballot to have, the\n\ncourt erroneously granted a no evidence summary judgment. The mail-in\n\nballots were tied and therefore a new election was required to be called.\n\nThe county clerk elected to conduct this election either using an electronic\n\nvoting system that did not comply with the Election Code or the system did\n\ncomply with the Election Code and she neglected to preserve images of the\n\nballots as required by law. The fact that there no images of the ballots kept\n\n\n                                   Page 12\n\frequires the calling of a new election keeping images of ballots either by\n\ngetting the system that can do so or by programing the current system to\n\nkeep the images of the ballots it formats for voters to decide who to vote for\n\nwhen they make that decision.\n\n      Finally, the trial court ordered sanctions under of the Texas Civil\n\nPractices & Remedies Code § 10.001, et. seq. There was no evidence that\n\nany fact pled both had “…no evidentiary support or, for a specifically\n\nidentified allegation or factual contention, was not likely to have evidentiary\n\nsupport after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery”\n\nTexas Civil Practices & Remedies Code § 10.001(3). App.10.\n\n      Because Pressley supplied the trial court with more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence that would in itself justify voiding the election and because the\n\nevidence in support of thereof was true and the cause of actions asserted\n\nwere recognized in law or in a good faith extension thereof, this Court\n\nshould reverse the trial court judgment rendering judgment that the\n\nsanctions were not warranted and remand this case for trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 13\n\f                               ARGUMENT\n\nIssue 1. DID THE TRIAL COURT COMMIT REVERSABLE ERROR BY\nGRANTING APPELLEE’S MOTION FOR NO EVIDENCE SUMMARY\nJUDGMENT?\n\n    Sub Issue 1. DID THE TRIAL COURT COMMIT REVERSIBLE\nERROR BY PREVENTING APPELLANT FROM OBTAINING\nDISCOVERABLE DOCUMENTS?\n\n     On April 13, 2015, the Court held that the County Clerk was not\n\nrequired to produce to Appellant access to what the Clerk’s contract with\n\nthe computerized voting system manufacturer called its proprietary\n\ninformation or inspection of direct computerized voting system used in the\n\nelection, eSlate voting program, Judge’s booth controllers, software or\n\nhardware used in conjunction with eSlate. 1 CR 333, 475 and 4501.\n\n     The documents and items the Court allowed the County Clerk to\n\nwithhold from direct unprotected production and inspection were not\n\nprivileged except to the extent they may have constituted trade secrets.\n\nThere is no privilege for evidence termed “proprietary.” Indeed, everything\n\nis “proprietary” to somebody. In re: Continental General Tire, Inc., 979\n\nS.W.2d 609, 613 (Tex 1998).\n\n     To the extent such information and items for inspection may have\n\nconstituted trade secrets; they still may have contained information relevant\n\nand material to the issues in this case. The proper procedure was for such\n\n\n                                   Page 14\n\fitems to be tendered to the Court in camera by the County Clerk for the\n\nCourt’s determination whether they were indeed trade secrets and with\n\nrespect to any trade secrets for the court to determine if they contain\n\ninformation that could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Texas\n\nRules Civil Procedure, Rules 192.3 (a) and (d) App.27 and 193.4 App.28.\n\nIf they contain such discoverable information, they should still have been\n\nordered to be disclosed subject to a protective order designed to protect\n\ntheir secrecy consistent with their need for use in this proceeding. In re:\n\nContinental General Tire, Inc., 979 S.W.2d 609, 613 (Tex 1998)( it is an\n\nabuse of discretion to fail to conduct an in camera inspection under claim\n\nthat documents are proprietary and decide if they can be produced under\n\nprotective order). See also In re: Dupont de Nemours & Co., 136 S.W.3rd\n\n218, 223 (Tex 2004) (The trial court abuses its discretion in refusing to\n\nconduct an in camera inspection when such review is critical to the\n\nevaluation of a privilege claim).    \"[A] clear failure by the trial court to\n\nanalyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an abuse of discretion”\n\nJohnson v.

See\n\nCR 2087-2088 and CR 4506 ¶¶ 17-18. Especially in light of all the corrupt\n\nMBBs identified in the Tally Audit log, 1 CR 2118, 2135, 2136, 2139, 2140,\n\n2142, 2155 and 2CR 1880, 1897, 1898, 1901, 1902, 1904, 1917. 1 CR\n\n2088 and other irregularities identified in Appellant’s Opposition to the\n\nMotions for Summary Judgment (1 CR 2043) and the absence of ballot\n\nimages that the voters used to make their decisions on who to vote for, the\n\nitems the Court refused to allow Appellant to have were vital not only for\n\n\n                                   Page 16\n\fthe expert but also for use in presenting all of the evidence Appellant had to\n\ndefeat the No Evidence Summary Judgment that is on appeal here.\n\n      Therefore, the Court should have ordered the withheld documents\n\nproduced to it in camera and ordered all non-trade secret items produced\n\nand the trade secret items to be produced subject to a protective order.\n\nFailure to follow the settled procedure for handling these discovery\n\nrequests was an abuse of discretion.         It was harmful error because it\n\ndeprived Appellant of evidence that could have been added to the\n\nOpposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment.          Essentially, the trial\n\ncourt prevented Appellant from obtaining relevant evidence to support her\n\nclaims and then held she did not have sufficient evidence to support her\n\nclaims.   This was a clear abuse of discretion that contributed to the\n\nerroneous judgment appealed from herein.\n\n\nSub Issue 2. DID THE TRIAL COURT COMMIT REVERSIBLE\nERROR BY GRANTING APPELLE’S MOTION FOR NO EVIDENCE\nSUMMARY JUDGEMENT WITHOUT REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE\nATTACHED TO THE OPPOSITION TO THE MOTION?\n\n\n      The trial court admitted at the hearing on the Summary Judgment that\n\nit had not read the evidence 3 RR 20-21.

The trial court should also be instructed to\n\nreview all evidence before granting or denying a summary judgment.\n\n    Sub Issue 3. DID THE TRIAL COURT COMMIT REVERSIBLE\nERROR BY GRANTING APPELLEE’S MOTION FOR NO EVIDENCE\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT BECAUSE APPELLANT PRODUCED MORE\nTHAN A SCINTILLA OF EVIDENCE?\n\n                                      A.\n\n          STANDARD OF REVIEW ON NO-EVDIENCE MOTION\n\n      This Court has clearly stated that it applies the de novo standard of\n\nreview on appeals from no-evidence summary judgments. Baize v. Scott\n\nand White Clinic, 2007 Tex. Lexis 366, p. 3 (Tex.App.—Austin, 2007 pet.\n\nden’d).   In the same case, the Court held that once a movant for no-\n\nevidence summary judgment asserts the non-movant has no evidence on a\n\nspecific required element of her case, the burden shifts to the non-movant\n\n                                    Page 18\n\fto raise a genuine issue of material fact on the challenged elements. In\n\nmaking such review, the appellate court considers as true all evidence\n\nfavorable to the non-movant and indulges any reasonable inferences and\n\nresolve doubts in favor of the non-movant.         Valence Operating Co. v.\n\nDonell, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2004).\n\n      Since this an appeal of a judgment granting a No-Evidence Summary\n\nJudgment, 1 CR 4605, this standard applies to the disposition of this case.\n\nThe Argument under the issue will presume that this Court is conducting a\n\nde novo review accepting the evidence attached to Appellant’s Opposition\n\nto the Summary Judgment in the trial court, 1 CR 2043, as true and\n\nindulging every reasonable inference in Appellant’s favor and resolving all\n\ndoubts in favor of Appellant.\n\n      The cause of action in this election contest is provided by statute:\n      \"The tribunal shall declare the election void if it cannot ascertain\n      the true outcome of the election.\" Texas Election Code §\n      221.012 App.4.\n      The election code also states what evidence the Court can look to in\n\nexercising its discretion that it cannot ascertain the true outcome of the\n\nelection:\n\n      “Sec. 221.003. SCOPE OF INQUIRY. (a) The tribunal hearing\n      an election contest shall attempt to ascertain whether the\n      outcome of the contested election, as shown by the final\n      canvass, is not the true outcome because:(1) illegal votes were\n\n                                    Page 19\n\f      counted; or ( 2) an election officer or other person officially\n      involved in the administration of the election:(A) prevented\n      eligible voters from voting;(B) failed to count legal votes; or(C)\n      engaged in other fraud or illegal conduct or made a mistake.”\n      App.27.\n      Therefore, if Appellant has produced in opposition to the No Evidence\n\nSummary Judgment more than a scintilla of evidence including all\n\ninferences in her favor and regardless of any evidence to the contrary\n\nurged by Appellee that the County Clerk failed to follow the requirements of\n\nthe election code counting CVRs only while not maintaining images of\n\nballots cast or that illegal conduct, irregularities, or mistakes in the conduct\n\nof the election process occurred, Appellee was not entitled to a no\n\nevidence summary judgment and the trial court committed reversible error\n\nin granting it. In reviewing the evidence submitted to determine whether it\n\nis more than a scintilla the Court must accept Appellant’s evidence as true\n\nregardless of evidence to the contrary submitted by Appellee and give all\n\nreasonable inferences raised by the evidence to Appellant, ignoring\n\ncontrary evidence offered by Appellee. Valence Operating Co. v. Donell,\n\n164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2004); Baize v. Scott and White Clinic, 2007\n\nTex.Lexis 438 (Tex.App.—Austin, 2007 pet. den’d).\n\n1. Appellant offered evidence that the County Clerk did not comply\nwith the Election Code’s requirement to maintain ballot images\n\n\n\n                                    Page 20\n\f       Texas Election Code § 128.001, App.19, proscribes the requirements\n\nfor use of computerized voting system. The statutes of Texas provided the\n\nHart system could not have been used to conduct this election unless it\n\nhad:\n\n\n       “(2) a main computer to coordinate ballot presentation, vote\n       selection, ballot image storage, and result tabulation. and (b)\n       Notwithstanding Chapter 66, a system under this section may allow\n       for the storage of processed ballot materials in an electronic form on\n       the main computer..\n\n       The evidence presented by Appellant’s Opposition to the No\n\nEvidence Motion for Summary Judgment (1 CR 2043) was more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence (raised a genuine issue of material fact) that the Travis\n\nCounty Clerk either did not use a system that complied with the foregoing\n\nstatute or, if she did, she failed store images of ballots and did not store\n\nthose images in compliance with law. While relying on all of the evidence\n\nattached to the Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, 1 CR\n\n2043 the following appears to be sufficient in itself:\n\n       1.   The affidavit of Contestant’s computer science expert that a\n\nCVR is not a ballot image and that some federal reports and other studies\n\nrequire the image of the ballot in addition to a CVR be maintained as a\n\ncheck on the computer. 1 CR 2087, 2088.\n\n\n\n                                     Page 21\n\f      2.    The clerk’s testimony that her office did not maintain images of\n\nthe ballot presented to voters by the computerized voting system when they\n\ndecide who to vote for 1 CR 1925, line 22 to 1928, line 24; 2 CR 2058 and\n\nthe exhibits showing the appearance of that ballot and the CVR 1 CR 1982,\n\nLines 19 -21; 2 CR 2058 which was the only item stored and relied on to\n\ncount votes 1 CR 1984, lines 9 -11. It is clear from this evidence and that\n\nof the Appellant’s expert 1 CR 2087 and 2088 that a CVR is not an official\n\nballot and does not contain the legal components required of a Texas ballot\n\n(1 CR 899 ¶ 146). Because \"ballot image storage\" was not used by Travis\n\nCounty, as the statute requires, the required ballot images from the run-off\n\nelection are missing election records and there are no official ballots that\n\ncan be counted other than the Absentee/Mail in Ballots which resulted in a\n\ntie (2 CR 3074 column BBM). Failing to print and produce the legally\n\nrequired \"images of ballots cast\" for the election recount is a violation of\n\nTexas Election Code § 213.016, App.20, by itself. Therefore, the only true\n\noutcome that can be ascertained is a tie which requires a new election. (2\n\nCR 3074, column “BBM” 1 CR 1938, line 23 to 1939, line 4).\n\n     \"’Election records’ also include ballot boxes (containing voted ballots),\n\ntally sheets, absentee ballots, Results/Tally tapes, and items like them, also\n\nconstitute \"precinct election records,\" as defined and used in chapter 66 of\n\n\n                                    Page 22\n\fthe code. In addition, Section 273.003 lists election returns, voted ballots,\n\nand the signature roster as specific types of election records. TEX. ELEC.\n\nCODE ANN.§ 273.003 (Vernon 1986). Based on the uses of the term\n\n‘election records’ and the examples listed within the code, we conclude\n\n‘election records’ are those which memorialize the actual election and the\n\nactual conduct of the election”. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Finlan, 27\n\nS.W.3d 220, 228-229, 2000 Tex. App. LEXIS 5773, 13-14(Tex. App. Dallas\n\n2000). Therefore Ballot images are election records which memorialize the\n\nactual election and the actual conduct of the election. Id. When the Texas\n\nConstitution and statutes that define what a ballot must contain (1 CR 899,\n\n¶ 146) is compared with what appears on the CVR (1 CR 1803, 1 CR 2944,\n\n2 CR 613), it is clear that a CVR is not an image of a ballot as defined by\n\nthe Election Code. See Texas Election Code §§ 52.003 App.14, 52.070\n\nApp.31, and 52.031. App.17.\n\n     3.    The affidavit of Appellant’s expert stating that a CVR is a data\n\nfile, not an image file. 1 CR 2087 and 2088.\n\n     4.    Evidence that was presented that supports the Hart Voting\n\nSystem is capable of formatting ballot images and Travis County did not\n\nretain them:\n\n\n\n\n                                   Page 23\n\fa) The Clerk’s testimony that the Hart computerized voting\n\n  system formats an image of a ballot meeting statutory\n\n  requirements that the voter is shown when deciding who to vote\n\n  for on the eSlate program 1 CR 1925, line 22 to1828, line 24;\n\nb) The Ballot by Mail (1 CR P. 1805 and 2 CR P. 2058) is\n\n  formatted and saved using the Hart Ballot Now system’s Ballot\n\n  Now Image Processor (1 CR 2055, ¶ 34, 1 CR 2633, 2656,\n\n  2659, 2664, 2666, 2774, 2781, 2782, 2791, 2792, 2794, 2829,\n\n  2830);\n\nc) The Secretary of State’s letter to Travis County that the Hart\n\n  Voting System used by Travis County Clerk preserves “ballot\n\n  images” (2 CR 7619). 1 CR 643; 3 RR 52, line 6 through 53,\n\n  line 8;\n\nd) The eSlate displays ballot styles that are presented to voters\n\n  when they are making their decision who to vote for show the\n\n  various components of a legal ballot (name of the Election, date\n\n  of the election, voting squares, instructions, all candidate\n\n  names, etc. 1 CR 2942, 1 CR 1927, lines 14-19). The ballot\n\n  styles are formatted and saved on a MBB using a ballot image\n\n  program in the Ballot Origination Software System (BOSS) as\n\n\n                         Page 24\n\f           defined by the Ballot Now Manual. 1 CR 2664. Therefore, Hart\n\n           does have a program that is apparently capable of combining a\n\n           flash card with a ballot image onto an MBB which can plugged\n\n           into the Tally system (1 CR 2656).\n\nTexas Election Code § 52.001 App.13 is clear that “the vote in an election\n\nis by official ballot” and Texas Election Code § 2.001 App.11 states, “…to\n\nbe elected to a public office, a candidate must receive more votes than any\n\nother candidate for office.” Since the legally required “images of ballots\n\ncast” (Texas Election Code § 128.001 App.19 and § 213.016 App.20) are\n\nmissing, the election should have been recanvassed with the only legal and\n\nofficial ballots, the mail in ballots, (1 CR 4667, ¶¶ 186 – 187) and the\n\nrecount should have been recanvassed as an exact tie. CVRs are not\n\nmentioned in any part of the Texas Constitution or the Texas Election Code\n\nand are not official ballots. If there are missing election records that are\n\nmaterial in determining the true outcome of the election, the Court is\n\nauthorized to void the election.   Guerra v. Avila, 597 S.W.2d 400, 403\n\n(Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1980, no writ).       If the Clerk counts illegal\n\nvotes, those votes are cancelled under Texas Election Code § 221.003 (1)\n\nand (3) App.22. This leaves the election tied because the only images of\n\nballots the computerized voting system kept were the eScan program’s\n\n\n                                   Page 25\n\fmail-in ballots and those resulted in a tie, authorizing the ordering of a new\n\nelection as requested by Appellant. 2 CR 3074, Column “BBM”; 1 CR\n\n1938, line 23 to 1939, line 4.\n\n      Ballots are defined in Texas Election Code, Chapter 52, Subchapter\n\nC.   For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that\n\nsubchapter are Sec. 52.003 App.14 and Sec. 52.070 App.31.\n\nIt is clear from these provisions that the Legislature did not permit this\n\nelection to be decided by counting or recounting CVRs which do not\n\nresemble or contain the components of an official ballot in any respect. See\n\nalso Texas Election Code § 214.049 (e).\n\n       Note that the Travis County CVR 1 CR 2994; 2 CR 613. does not\n\ncontain:\n\n           a. a unique serial/ticket number (Texas Constitution, Article 6,\n              Section 4, App.9 and Texas Election Code § 52.062, App.15.)\n\n           b. the election name and candidate (Texas Election Code §\n              52.063), of Joint Special Runoff Election, Travis County,\n              App.16; 52.031.

App.32.\n\n     The CVR does not meet the Constitution’s minimum requirement that\n\nan election be conducted by a numbered ballot since the CVR is not\n\nnumbered. Texas Constitution, Article VI, Section 4 App.9. Therefore, any\n\ndecision by a state official like the Secretary of State or the Travis County\n\nClerk that allowed the true outcome of an election to be decided by\n\nsomething other than a numbered official ballot would be unconstitutional.\n\nIndeed, the Clerk confessed that a ballot image and a CVR are not the\n\nsame thing 2 Suppl. RR 189, lines 2 - 9.\n\n     Thus, Appellant’s evidence attached to her Opposition to Contestee’s\n\nNo Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment showing that a CVR is not a\n\nballot and the outcome of this election was not determined by counting\n\nballots or images of ballots which were not preserved and therefore missing\n\ncreates more than a scintilla of evidence that the true outcome of this\n\nelection cannot be determined. The trial court could not grant this motion by\n\nrelying on any contrary evidence that Appellee attached to a Motion for\n\nTraditional Summary Judgment which was not granted and is not involved\n\nin this appeal. 1 CR 4605; 2 C.R. 2060.\n\n     The CVR has been around a long time. If the Legislature wanted to\n\nmake it permissible to determine the true outcome of an election by\n\n\n                                   Page 27\n\fcounting CVRs instead of ballots as it has defined them it could have done\n\nso (subject to the Constitution’s mandatory requirement that elections be by\n\nnumbered ballots).\n\n     The question in this case is whether absent specific statutory\n\nauthority this court will allow our elected officials to be determined by a\n\ncomputer data tally only of what the voter’s ballot says without the backup\n\nof an actual ballot or an image of one. In this day and age with computer\n\ncrashes, errors and hacks, the wisdom of our Legislature in requiring the\n\nsystem to maintain images of the actual ballots is clearly good public policy\n\nand should be presumed to be its intention.\n\n     Appellees have asserted that the issues raised in this case have\n\nbeen decided in Andrade v. NAACP of Austin, 345 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2011).\n\nThat case has nothing to do with issues raised in this case. Andrade,\n\nsupra, dealt solely with standing and equal protection. The issue in that\n\ncase was whether the voters who alleged that they were denied equal\n\nprotection of laws under the constitution because they were required to use\n\nthe Hart electronic voting system and other voters in statewide elections\n\nwere not required to do so. The Court first held these voters had standing\n\nto raise the equal protection claims and then held there was no violation of\n\nequal protection by use of different voting systems in different counties in a\n\n\n                                   Page 28\n\fstatewide election.   The Court then held that the voters did not have\n\nstanding to attack the lack of ballot verification and therefore never reached\n\nthe merits of anything like the issues involved in this case. Here there is no\n\nchallenge to Appellant’s standing. Andrade, supra, is very instructive in its\n\ndescription of how the Hart system worked when an election is held:\n\n“Voters arriving at the polls in counties using the eSlate are given a unique\n\naccess code. The voter enters the code into the eSlate, which then displays\n\nthe ballot. Voters turn a dial to highlight their ballot choice and then press\n\n\"enter\" to make a selection. After a voter completes his selections, the\n\neSlate displays a ballot summary page. If the voter's choices are correctly\n\ndisplayed, the voter presses the \"cast ballot\" button, and the vote is\n\nrecorded. See Voter Instructions, TRAVIS COUNTY, purchased the eSlate\n\nsystem in 2001 and has used it since 2003.” Id. at 5. (emphasis added)\n\nThe critical aspects of this description for this appeal are the Supreme\n\nCourt’s acknowledgement that the system used by Travis County “displays\n\nthe ballot” (emphasis added). This is the only relevant part of Andrade,\n\nsupra and actually makes Appellant’s point that this ballot is not printed and\n\nnot preserved even though it is formatted 1 CR 1927, lines 13 -18 and 1\n\nCR 1805 for every voter to see by the Hart voting system. As a result, the\n\nevidence eSlate formats a ballot raises at least a fact issue as to whether\n\n\n                                    Page 29\n\fthe Secretary of State had authority under the Texas Election Code §\n\n52.075 App.37 to imply in its instructions and definitions that a CVR is\n\nsynonymous with an image of a ballot as defined in the Election Code.\n\n     The other case Appellee has relied on is Texas Democratic Party v.\n\nWilliams, No. A-07-CA-115-SS (W.D. Tex. August 16, 2007). In that case,\n\nvoters complained that the eSlate deprived them of the ability to \"emphasis\n\nvote\"; that is, to cast a straight party vote and then also again vote for a\n\nparticular candidate within that party—to make sure their votes count for\n\nthese particular candidates. The voters argued that, if they attempted to\n\nemphasis vote, the eSlate would de-select, rather than register a vote for,\n\nthe individual candidate. The trial court held that even assuming that the\n\neSlate impacted voters' ability to cast emphasis votes, the use of DREs\n\nwas constitutionally permissible. Therefore, neither case dealt with either\n\nof the issues involved in this case (does a CVR satisfy the election code\n\nrequirement to maintain an image of a ballot and can several irregularities\n\nand mistakes in the conduct of an election permit a court to void the\n\nelection by making it impossible to ascertain the true outcome?).\n\n     The trial court conceded that if a CVR is not an image of a ballot then\n\nAppellant would be entitled to a new election, 4 RR 60, line 13 to 62, line\n\n20, then erroneously granted a no evidence summary judgment that\n\n\n                                   Page 30\n\fAppellant did not produce more than a scintilla of evidence that a CVR is\n\nnot an image of a ballot.\n\n    2. APPELLANT PRODUCED MORE THAN A SCINTILLA OF\nEVIDENCE THAT THERE WERE IRREGULARATIES AND MISTAKES IN\nTHE CONDUCT OF THE ELECTION TO DEFEAT APPELLEE’S MOTION\nFOR NO EVIDENCE SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n\n      “A court trying an election contest shall attempt to ascertain\n      whether the outcome shown by the final canvass was not the\n      true outcome because illegal votes were counted or because\n      an election official or other person officially involved in the\n      administration of the election (1) prevented eligible voters from\n      voting, (2) failed to count legal votes, or (3) engaged in other\n      fraud or illegal conduct or made a mistake. Texas Election\n      Code Ann. § 221.003(a) (Vernon 2010). To set aside the\n      outcome of an election, the contestant must prove by clear and\n      convincing evidence that a violation of the election code\n      occurred and such violation materially affected the outcome of\n      the election. McCurry v. Lewis, 259 S.W.3d 369, 372-73 (Tex.\n      App.--Amarillo 2008, no pet.). The outcome of an election is\n      ‘materially affected’ when a different and correct result would\n      have been reached in the absence of irregularities or\n      ‘irregularities in the conduct of the election render it impossible\n      to determine the majority of the voters' true will.’ Id. at 373, see\n      also Gonzalez v. Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763, 773, 777-78 (Tex.\n      App.--Corpus Christi 2008, pet. denied) ; Ware v. Crystal City\n      Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 S.W.2d 190, 191-92 (Tex. Civ. App.-San\n      Antonio 1972, writ dism'd).” Duncan-Hubert v. Mitchell, 310\n      S.W.3d 92, 98 (Tex. App. Dallas 2010, pet. den.) (emphasis\n      added).\n\n      In Duncan-Hubert, supra the court reversed the grant of a no\n\nevidence summary judgment based on the affidavit of an expert showing\n\nthat were so many mistakes and irregularities that it could be impossible to\n\n\n\n                                    Page 31\n\fascertain the true outcome of the election even though the Contestant\n\ncould not point to actual votes affected. This is strikingly similar to the case\n\nat bar except Appellant presented much more evidence of mistakes,\n\nirregularities and counting of illegal ballots.\n\n        In the case of Gonzalez v. Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763, 773, 777-78\n\n(Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 2008, pet. denied) the Court also held after a\n\ntrial that mistakes and irregularities were enough to overturn an election. It\n\nheld:\n\n        “{T}the election code does not require a trial court to rely solely\n        on ‘illegal votes’ in attempting to ascertain the true outcome of\n        an election. As is evident from section 221.003, the outcome of\n        an election can be muddled not just by the counting of illegal\n        votes or the failure to count legal votes, but also by mistakes\n        made by election officers. TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. §\n        221.003(a)(2)(C)       See Alvarez, 844 S.W.2d at 242. A\n        contestant may allege and prove that \"irregularities rendered\n        impossible a determination of the majority of the voters' true\n        will.’ Guerra, 865 S.W.2d at 576.”\n\nGonzalez v. Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763, 773, 777-78 (Tex. App.--Corpus\n\nChristi 2008, pet. denied).\n\n        In Garcia v. Avila, 597 S.W.2d 400, 403 (Tex. Civ. App. -San Antonio\n\n1980, no writ), the Court held that missing election records alone could\n\njustify overturning an election. In this case, the trial court clung to the\n\nerroneous belief that appellant was required to identify specific vote\n\n\n\n                                      Page 32\n\fchanges caused by the mistakes 4 RR 104, lines 3-17.             The missing\n\nimages of items that met the statutory definition of a ballot and satisfied the\n\nTexas Constitution’s minimum requirements of what must be on a ballot\n\nthat is counted to determine the outcome of an election was more than\n\nenough to void the election and appellant provided ample proof of this to\n\navoid summary judgment.\n\n      In addition, Appellant produced evidence that there were numerous\n\nInvalid/Corrupt MBBs,1 CR 2086 - 2087, 1 CR 2118, 2135, 2136, 2139,\n\n2140, 2142, 2155 and 2 CR 1880, 1897, 1898, 1901, 1902, 1904, 1917; 1\n\nCR 2056 paragraph 41 through 2059 paragraph 48; that there were more\n\nInvalid/Corrupt MBBs than the County Clerk had seen in all her years of\n\nconducting elections (MBBs contain the CVRs from a voting machine) 1 CR\n\n1978 lines 9-20; that the “reader” tallying the votes was broken 1 CR 1979\n\nline 4-5; that seals were broken bringing the security and accuracy of the\n\nMBBs into question 1 CR 917, 922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 929, 930; that\n\nthe computer that tallies the CVRs was left open on several occasions and\n\nfor extended period of time that the County Clerk did not believe the tally\n\nlog which recorded the MBBs and all of the other events in the election in\n\norder to verify the results were reliable 1 CR 1995 lines 7-13; that the\n\nCounty Clerk ordered her employees not to print zero tapes and result\n\n\n                                    Page 33\n\ftapes on the day of the run–off election as required by the Secretary of\n\nState 1 CR 1865 and Appellant was told the same by Mr. Winn, the Clerk’s\n\nDirector of Elections 1 CR 872 paragraph 42; 874, paragraph 48; that\n\nimages of the ballots cast were missing; 1 CR 1982 lines 19-21; that a\n\nstatistical analysis of the reported results of the run-off election indicated\n\nthat the results were not believable and that the county clerk’s employees\n\nrefused to allow the poll watchers to witness the whole process of the\n\nprinting of the CVRs from the tally computer 1 CR 886 paragraph 93..\n\n     Specifically, Appellant and her official Recount Watchers were not\n\nallowed to monitor the integrity of where the CVRs were retrieved, the\n\nsource where the retrieval occurred, or the copying of the CVR files to an\n\naggregated pdf file. 1 CR 886, ¶ 93. Since they were arguably allowed to\n\ndo so by Texas Election Code § 33.056 App.12 and § 213.013 App.33 that\n\nobstruction may have violated Texas Election Code § 33.061.           App.35\n\n     These errors relate to the counting of votes and the scope of their\n\neffect on the vote count is significant even though that by their nature and\n\nthe court’s erroneous discovery order it is impossible to say how many\n\nillegal votes were counted or how many legal votes were not counted.\n\nBased on the cases cited above, Appellant’s Opposition to the No Evidence\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment produced much more than a scintilla of\n\n\n                                   Page 34\n\fevidence that would have allowed a court to exercise its discretion at a trial\n\nand decide that the cumulative effect of these violations of the election\n\ncode, irregularities and mistakes “rendered impossible a determination of\n\nthe majority of the voter’s true will” Gonzalez v. Villarreal, supra. Therefore,\n\nthe Court erred in granting Appellee’s no evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment and this court should reverse the judgment below and remand it\n\nfor trial.\n\n       The court in Alvarez, supra said it best:\n\n       “But perceptions of fairness are also important. The public\n       must have confidence that the election process is fair for all\n       candidates. It is therefore imperative that election officials\n       comply with code procedures. Those who have studied history\n       and have observed the fragility of democratic institutions in our\n       own time realize that one of our country's most precious\n       possessions is the commitment of our public officials to the rule\n       of law -- fair and evenhanded application of rules known in\n       advance -- and the widespread acceptance of election results.\n       Repeated abuse of power by election officials can chip away at\n       public respect for our legal institutions and undermine the\n       willingness of losing candidates to accept the results. Cases\n       may arise in which official disregard of the election laws is so\n       pervasive that the courts could not let the election stand, even\n       though the contestant might not be able to prove that the\n       violations caused an incorrect outcome.” Alvarez v. Espinoza,\n       844 S.W.2d 238, 249 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1992, writ dism'd\n       w.o.j.)\n\n       The Court in Alvarez, supra did not believe there were enough errors\n\nto exercise its discretion to void the election but it did analyze a much less\n\n\n\n                                     Page 35\n\fcompelling bed of evidence in making that decision. It did not hold the\n\nevidence of errors and missing records was no evidence. It just said it was\n\nenough to reverse the trial court’s exercise of discretion at trial. Therefore,\n\nthe evidence submitted by appellant in opposition to the no evidence\n\nmotion for summary decision entitled her to a trial and the judgment should\n\nbe reversed and the case remanded to afford her the trial the law affords\n\nher.\n\n\nIssue 2. DID THE TRIAL COURT COMMIT REVERSABLE ERROR BY\nAWARDING SANCTIONS AGAINST APPELLANT PRESSLEY?\n\n    Sub Issue 1. WAS THE RIGHT TO SEEK SANCTIONS\nFORECLOSED AND BARRED BY THE LANGUAGE OF THE ONLY\nFINAL JUDGMENT DURING THE COURT’S PLENARY POWER OR THE\nRULE 11 AGREEMENT THAT ALL ISSUES BETWEEN THE PARTIES\nWERE RESOLVED?\n\n       At the conclusion of the summary judgment hearing Appellant’s\n\ncounsel asked the court to rule that the judgment it was about to enter\n\nresolved all issues between all parties. Appellee’s counsel agreed to this\n\nlanguage and the court wrote it in at the bottom of the judgment. 4 RR 12,\n\nlines 18 -21; 1 CR 4605; App.1. This Judgment was entered on May 26,\n\n2015. The next time the court entered a final judgment amending the May\n\n26, 2015 final judgment was on July 23, 2015 App.3, CR Suppl. IV 52, well\n\nbeyond the court’s 30 day plenary authority which expired on June 25,\n\n\n                                    Page 36\n\f2015. The order entered on June 24, 2015 App.2. CR Suppl. IV 16 did not\n\namend the earlier judgment in that it was not a final judgment in itself\n\nbecause it affirmatively showed it was not intended to resolve all issues\n\nand it did not include the finality language the first judgment had.\n\n“…O{o}nly a motion seeking a substantive change will extend the appellate\n\ndeadlines and the court's plenary power under Rule 329b(g) App. 36.

In Schroeder, supra the\n\nCourt held that a document filed in the record and issued by the Court that\n\nanticipated further action by the Court did not extend the Court’s plenary\n\npower past 30 days. This June 24, 2015 order did not amend a judgment\n\nby entering a different final judgment or by modifying the existing judgment\n\nand it did not order a new trial. Therefore, it did not qualify as an order\n\nextending the plenary jurisdiction of the Court for another 30 days. There\n\nwas no post judgment motion filed (the second amended and third\n\namended motions for sanctions were filed after the final judgment was\n\nsigned on May 26, 2015, but both related back to a pretrial motion filed on\n\nApril 23, 2015, (1 CR 479) which had already been resolved by the finality\n\n\n                                   Page 37\n\flanguage in the May 26, 2015 judgment that all issues between the parties\n\npending at that time had been resolved as of that date. 1 CR 4605.

App. Dallas 1994, no pet.).\n\nTherefore, the Court did not have plenary jurisdiction to enter the July 23,\n\n2015 final judgment containing sanctions and same was void. Id.; In re:\n\nReynolds 2014 Tex.

Therefore, the first judgment and\n\nthe Rule 11 Agreement approved by the Court, precluded the Court under\n\nsettled principals of law form conducting a hearing and entering a sanctions\n\n\n\n\n                                   Page 38\n\forder.

In addition with regard to monetary sanctions against a party the\n\nentire record must show that the pleading contains factual allegations that\n\nhave no evidentiary basis (See the limitation against the imposition of\n\nmonetary sanctions against a party in Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode, Section 10.004 (d)) App.10. See also Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d\n\n609, 615 (Tex. 2007). Appellant did not sign a pleading and given her\n\nstatus as a party the court abused its discretion by imposing monetary\n\nsanctions against her in light of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nSection 10.004 (d), App.10, unless the entire record shows the particular\n\nfactual allegation challenged by the motion has no evidentiary basis or was\n\nnot likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for\n\nfurther investigation or discovery. See Foust, supra at page 3. Since there\n\n\n                                    Page 41\n\fwas no evidence at the sanction hearing that any allegation met the test for\n\nimposition of monetary sanctions against a party the trial court’s sanction\n\norder was arbitrary and unreasonable without reference to guiding rules\n\nand principles that by ignoring that:\n\n   1. There is a presumption that the allegations were not subject to\n      sanctions that was not overcome;\n\n   2. There was no evidence or it was against the great weight and\n      preponderance of the evidence enabling the trial court to reach a\n      conclusion that factual allegations challenged by the motion has no\n      evidentiary basis or was not likely to have evidentiary support after a\n      reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery either\n      was evidence or was against the great weight of the evidence after a\n      review of the entire record;\n\n   3. The trial court made no determination or inquiry into whether lesser\n      sanctions than $40,000 plus expenses and appellate attorney’s fees\n      were available and sufficient to accomplish its goals;\n\n   4. The trial court misapplied the Low factors in determining the\n      appropriateness and amount of the sanctions;\n\n   5. There trial court did not determine that and there was a direct nexus\n      between any improper conduct and the sanctions imposed. Low, 221\n      S.W.3d at 614; and\n\n   6. The sanctions imposed were not tailored to remedy any identified\n      prejudice allegedly caused by the alleged conduct. Thottumkal v.\n      McDougal, 251 S.W.3d 715, 717 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n      2008, pet. denied) (citing Cire v.

Zero tapes were not printed on the day of the election (contained\n         in all seven contest pleadings) 3 Suppl. RR 222, line 17 – 223, line\n         2.\n\n      2. Some voter’s did not vote because the voting location they went to\n         in the general election were closed and consolidated elsewhere.\n         (not in the 6th amended final pleading) 3 Suppl. RR 219, line 2 –\n         220, line 9.\n\n      3. Michael Winn and Dana DeBeauvoir violated the criminal statute\n         prohibiting interference with poll watchers. 3 Suppl. RR 221, lines\n         2-10. Election Code 221.013, App. 24\n\n      It is also clear the Court imposed sanctions for making the legal\n\ncontention that the above-referenced facts were evidence that could be\n\nused to void an election. See also discussion in 3 Suppl. RR 223, lines 11-\n\n24.\n\n\n\n\n                                     Page 43\n\f     Although there are findings of fact related the allegation that the Clerk\n\nviolated the election code by counting and maintain only CVRs when she\n\nwas required to maintain and count images of ballots cast, the trial court\n\nmade it clear that it was not sanctioning for those allegations, 3 Suppl. RR\n\n223, lines 8-10 and made no conclusion of law that doing so was\n\nsanctionable. Suppl. III CR 36 – 51. App.3.\n\n\n     The trial court’s view of the factual and legal allegations in the various\n\nincarnations of the Contest Petitions is totally contrary to the clear great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence in the record as a whole. The\n\nfact that plaintiff lost the no evidence Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n(especially when that was an erroneous ruling) or that Appellant attempted\n\nto pursue an unpopular claim or one that someone else would not have\n\npursued cannot form the basis of a sanctions order. Foust, supra, at page\n\n3. App.29. In Foust the Court overturned a sanctions order based on the\n\nfailure to produce evidence of causation at trial when there was no\n\nevidence of improper motive at the time the allegation was made.\n\n     Indeed, Appellant went through the unusual effort of attaching almost\n\nall of the evidence upon which the factual allegations of mistakes and\n\nirregularities in the election were based to each version of the Contest and\n\n\n\n                                   Page 44\n\fdid several statistical analyses before filing this Contest. Other than the\n\nallegation that voting locations were changed this court need only look at\n\nthe 6th Amended Contest, 1 CR 863, since the allegations therein were\n\ndeveloped after “further investigation and discovery” and therefore\n\nobviously complied with Section 10.001(3), App.10.         Bader, Inc. v.\n\nSandstone Prods. Inc., Supra. The pleading should be read as a whole for\n\na complete listing of evidence attached to it.\n\n      The pleading included evidence showing the following and more with\n\nrespect to the evidentiary basis for its allegations:\n\n      1. Tally Audit logs showing multiple missing Logout entries 1 CR\n\n1807, 1CR 1814, 1 CR 1863, 1 CR 1863.6;\n\n      2. Tally Audit Logs showing multiple \"Invalid/Corrupt MBB Mobile\n\nBallot Box errors (1 CR 1811, 1828, 1829, 1832, 1833, 1835, 1848, 1978\n\nline 4 - 20, 1979 line 4.);\n\n      3.

App.18\n\n\n                                     Page 45\n\f     5. There were no zero tapes printed on the day of the election. As\n\nnoted in the Sixth Amended Petition, p. 12-13 ¶¶ 38 – 41, (1 CR 871-872),\n\nthe Texas Secretary of State requires the printing of Zero Tape Reports\n\nduring Early Voting and on Election Day at each precinct/polling location.\n\nZero Tape Reports are defined by the Texas Secretary of State as: “A\n\nZero Tape is the tape that is printed when the voting machine is first set up\n\nat the polls. It is called a Zero Tape since all contests or propositions\n\nshould have zero votes next to each name or question.” (2 CR 712; 2\n\nSuppl. RR 78, line 9 to 79, line 13). Also, according to the Texas Secretary\n\nof State’s Election Advisory No. 2012-03(6)(g)(vi), 2 CR 707 and 726\n\nrelated to Zero Tapes:\n\n       “Opening the Polls:\n\n           1. At a minimum print one zero tape from each\n     applicable device, as follows: The presiding judge, an\n     election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if one or\n     more watchers are present, shall sign the zero tape. 2.\n     Maintain zero tapes in a secure location to be returned\n     with election materials (i.e. Ballot Box #4 or other secure\n     means designated by the general custodian of election\n     records).” (emphasis added)(Exhibit J, p. 8 (2 CR 707))\n\n      In Contestee’s Third Amended Motion for Sanctions, it is claimed\n\nthat Appellant actually produced a zero tape as an Exhibit. (IV Suppl. CR 9)\n\n\n\n                                   Page 46\n\fThe document referred to is not a Zero Tape, 1 CR 1875, and App.36,\n\nbecause it does not contain all of the information required to be in a Zero\n\ntape in order for it to perform its function. It does not contain the following\n\ninformation required by the Texas Secretary of State for Zero Tapes (2 CR\n\n710):\n\n        “All contests should have zero votes next to each name” In fact,\n        Contestant and Contestee’s District 4 is not listed on the partial tape\n        and neither Pressley nor Casar is listed with zero votes next to their\n        respective names,\n\n        “Zero Tape is printed when voting machine is first set up at polls” 1\n        CR 710. In fact, the partial tape Travis County produced was not\n        printed when the voting machines were set up at the polls during\n        Early Voting (December 1) or during Election Day (December 16).\n        The partial tape was printed on November 26th, a week prior to Early\n        Voting,\n\n         “The presiding judge…shall sign the Zero Tape” 1 CR 703, item vi.1.\n\n The partial tape produced by Travis County and attached to Appellant’s\n\n pleading was not signed by an election judge. (1 CR 1875) See larger\n\n version App.36; Election Code § 66.051-.054. App. 18\n\n         Travis County Clerk testified at the Sanctions Hearing on June 18,\n\n 2015 that tapes were not printed on Election Day. 2 Suppl. RR 224, lines\n\n 3-8. She also testified that a letter exempting her from printing Zero tapes\n\n for the general election (2 CR 7618-7619) applied to the run-off even\n\n though she did not have a similar letter referring to the run-off. 2 Suppl.\n\n\n                                     Page 47\n\fRR 183 lines 5 - 16 which implies that the Clerk did not print zero tapes on\n\nthe day of the election. As noted in the Sixth Amended Petition, P. 13 ¶\n\n42 (1 CR 872 ¶ 42), Appellant communicated with the Travis County\n\nElections Division Director and was told no Zero Tapes would be printed\n\nfor the run-off. In addition the testimony at the sanctions hearing made\n\nclear that Appellant had a lot of evidentiary support for her allegations that\n\nZero tapes were not printed on the day of the election. 2 RR 48 to 50, line\n\n5.\n\n     6.   The allegation that voters were disenfranchised because their\n\nvoting location was changed from the locations at which they voted in the\n\ngeneral election was likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable\n\nopportunity for further investigation and discovery given the statistical\n\nevidence indicating voters who always vote in run-offs did not vote in this\n\none and numerous complaints to Pressley’s phone bank and the likelihood\n\nthat voters would be willing to testify about their disenfranchisement. 2\n\nSuppl. RR 88, line 6 to 96, line 10, line 20. When it became clear that the\n\nvoters who the statistical study indicated did not vote because of a change\n\nin voting locations would not be willing to testify and other expected\n\nreasonably likely evidentiary support would not materialize, Pressley\n\ndropped that claim from her final pleading since it turned out to be a\n\n\n                                   Page 48\n\f“hairball”. 2 Suppl. RR 88, line 6 to 96, line 10, line 20. This is precisely\n\nwhat the sanctions power is designed to encourage. To use removing an\n\nallegation after the anticipated evidence did not materialize, which should\n\nbe rewarded not sanctioned, is an abuse of discretion. Thottumkal v.\n\nMcDougal, 251 S.W.3d 715, 717 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008,\n\npet. denied) (citing Cire v. Cummings, 134 S.W.3d 835, 838 (Tex. 2004))\n\nand Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 10.004(b). App.10. This\n\nevidence proves Appellant had the appropriate state of mind when she\n\nmade this allegation and was not subject for sanctions for doing so. “The\n\nparty moving for sanctions must prove the pleading party's subjective state\n\nof mind.” Brozynski v. Kerney, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 6817, 2006 WL\n\n2160841, at *4 (Tex. App.--Waco Aug. 2, 2006, pet. denied) (citing Mattly v.\n\nSpiegel, Inc., 19 S.W.3d 890, 896 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no\n\npet.)). “In the case of Section 10.001(1), the movant must show, and the\n\nCourt must describe and explain, that the pleading was filed for the\n\nimproper purpose of harassment. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 10.001(1) ; id. § 10.005 (\"A court shall describe in an order\n\nimposing a sanction under this chapter the conduct the court has\n\ndetermined violated Section 10.001 and explain the basis for the sanction\n\nimposed.\")”. R.M. Dudley Constr. Co. v. Dawson, 258 S.W.3d 694, 708\n\n\n                                   Page 49\n\f(Tex. App.—Waco 2008, pet denied).           Since Appellant clearly had an\n\nevidentiary basis for making the allegation or reasonably expected she\n\nwould obtain witness statements or proof there were no signs posted\n\nredirecting voters from their original vote locations, the presumption of good\n\nfaith was not overcome.      Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to\n\nsanction Appellant for making this allegation.\n\n     7.   Appellee’s counsel, in an effort to prejudice the trial court,\n\ncontinuously accused Pressley and Rogers of directly accusing Dana\n\nDeBeauvoir and Michael Winn of criminal conduct. 3 Suppl. RR 25, line 21\n\nto 26, line 4. The pleadings do not directly accuse any particular election\n\nofficial of committing a crime. 1 CR 877, ¶¶ 60 - 62 and 886, ¶ 93 to 887, ¶\n\n96. The allegations of interference with poll watchers was supported by\n\naffidavit (2 CR 7620) and was only included because illegal conduct is one\n\nof the grounds a court looks at in deciding to overturn an election.\n\nNowhere in these allegations is Dana DeBeauvoir even mentioned, and all\n\nthat Mr. Winn is directly accused of doing is not answering phone calls.\n\nIndeed, there is no direct allegation that either had any personal\n\ninvolvement in the illegal activities. 1 CR 875-878. Therefore, sanctions\n\nbased on the totally erroneous proposition that Appellant had no evidence\n\nor legal basis to accuse Dana DeBeauvoir and Michael Winn of criminal\n\n\n                                   Page 50\n\fconduct is arbitrary and capricious. To the extent there may have been\n\nsome innuendo (which is denied) that the actions regarding the obstructing\n\nthe poll watchers from viewing of printing of the CVRs, the pleading merely\n\nmakes true allegations supported by affidavit and cites election code\n\nprovisions and criminal statutes that arguably could apply to those facts.\n\nThey certainly can be said to reasonably argue for an extension or\n\ninterpretation of legal principals. The trial court and the Appellee never\n\npointed out any cases holding that Rogers’ application of the factual\n\naffidavits to the criminal code was erroneous. Put another way, there are\n\nno cases that hold that it is not a violation of the cited as criminal provision\n\nto commit the acts verified by the affidavits as having been committed.\n\n      Since there was some evidentiary support or such was reasonably\n\nlikely to be obtained for each of the sanctioned allegations, the Court\n\nabused its discretion by sanctioning Pressley for making them.\n\n      In summary, Appellant conducted her own reasonable inquiry before\n\nfiling the lawsuit.   She looked at the Texas Constitution, Article VI and\n\nElection Code provisions defining an official ballot (Chapter 52) and\n\nrequiring a computerized voting system to maintain images of them and\n\ncompared that to the information appearing on the CVRs obtained at the\n\nrecount (2 CR 5116). She looked into reports from other states about the\n\n\n                                    Page 51\n\fneed for maintaining a cross check on the CVR consisting of the ballot that\n\nvoters looked at when deciding who to vote for (2 CR 7515). She did a\n\nstatistical analysis which indicated many voters did not vote in the run-off\n\nwhose voting location was changed when they have always voted in run-\n\noffs in the past, and had reports from voters who refused to go to the\n\nconsolidated location (2 CR 1580-1614), She was told by the Director of\n\nElections that zero tapes and result tapes would not be printed on the day\n\nof the election (1 CR 872, ¶ 42) and obtained affidavits for poll watchers\n\nthat were told the same thing (2 CR 7620). She saw instructions from the\n\nClerk instructing election personnel not to print result tapes (1 CR 1865).\n\nShe had information from her poll watchers stating they were denied\n\naccess to certain parts of the process of printing the CVRs for the run-off\n\nand was present when it occurred (1 CR 886, ¶ 93).          The trial court’s\n\nholding that she did not make a reasonable inquiry is an abuse of discretion\n\ngiven the entire record in this case some of which is cited above. For the\n\nsame reason, the trial court’s holding that there was no evidentiary basis\n\nfor these allegations and it was not reasonably likely discovery would\n\nproduce any evidence was likewise arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.\n\nSince Appellant did not engage in any conduct for which the court had the\n\nauthority to impose sanctions, it committed reversible error in doing so.\n\n\n                                   Page 52\n\f      As the Texas Supreme Court noted in Low, supra at 621:              “We\n\nrecognize that in some cases, a party may not have evidence that proves\n\neach specific factual allegation at the time a lawsuit is filed. Certainly, the\n\nlaw does not require proof of a case without reasonable time for discovery.”\n\nAll of the allegations made in the first 5 contests had evidentiary support by\n\nthe time discovery was over and the 6th amended contest was filed. This is\n\nnot like Low when an examination of medical records showed undisputable\n\nevidence that the allegations made and sanctioned were untrue.\n\n    Sub Issue 3. IF APPELLANT PRESSLEY WAS SUBJECT TO\nSANCTIONS, WERE THE SANCTIONS IMPOSED JUSTIFIED AND\nAPPROPRIATE?\n\n                                 Introduction\n\n      “When determining if the trial court abused its discretion, the\n\nappellate court engages…” in a two-part inquiry. First, we must ensure that\n\nthe punishment was imposed on the true offender and tailored to remedy\n\nany prejudice caused. Id. at 839; see also Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc.\n\nv. Lazy Nine Mun. Util. Dist., 198 S.W.3d 300, 319 (Tex. App.--Texarkana\n\n2006, pet. denied). Second, we must make certain that less severe\n\nsanctions would not have been sufficient. Cire, 134 S.W.3d at 839; Save\n\nOur Springs, 198 S.W.3d at 319-320.” Thottumkal v. McDougal, 251\n\nS.W.3d 715, (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. 2008).\n\n\n                                    Page 53\n\f      The trial court made findings and conclusions in a futile effort to show\n\nit had applied the factors the Texas Supreme Court recommended\n\nsanctioning courts to look at in its decision in Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d\n\n609, 622 f/n 5 (Tex. 2007). However, the trial court misapplied the Low\n\nfactors to the actual evidence in this case. It followed lock step with the\n\nunusual testimony of Appellee’s attorney (unusual because he was clearly\n\ntestifying to contested facts that were really his argument for sanctions and\n\nnot evidence) even though he was not designated as an expert on\n\nsanctions over Appellant’s counsel’s objection. It is clear that this Court did\n\nnot consider Mr. Herring’s testimony on the Low factors and this Court\n\nshould not either. 3 Suppl. RR 48, line 16 to 49, line 2.\n\n      By imposing sanctions in disregard of the basis for the considerations\n\nit was required by the Supreme Court in Low, supra to look at the trial court\n\nabused its discretion. Therefore, even if the Court could enter the sanctions\n\norder and even if sanctionable conduct had occurred, the factor’s in Low\n\nrequired the court not to impose monetary sanctions and certainly not in the\n\namounts it ordered.\n\n      2.    The Low Factor\n\n      The first Low factor, the good faith or bad faith of the offender, weighs\n\nagainst awarding sanctions for alleging that certain actions of the Clerk’s\n\n\n                                    Page 54\n\foffice violated a criminal sanction in the Election Code under this factor.\n\nThe trial court found Appellant is only responsible under this factor for the\n\nfactual allegation that the clerk’s employees did not let them see the entire\n\nprocess of printing the ballots. There is absolutely no evidence that this\n\nfactual allegation was without evidentiary support. There is a presumption\n\nthat the allegations and the pleadings were made in good faith. There was\n\nno evidence at the sanctions hearing or elsewhere that even tended to\n\novercome this presumption. The complaint the trial court points to is about\n\ncharacterizing the interference truthfully alleged as having occurred as a\n\ncriminal violation. Doing so was purely a legal conclusion drawn by Mr.\n\nRogers from the true facts reported and alleged by Appellant. There is no\n\nevidence either Appellant or Rogers acted in bad faith. Indeed, Appellant’s\n\nfactual and legal positions in this case were made in good faith.        The\n\nallegations that there was some interference with Poll Watcher’s request to\n\nview the entire process involved in printing the CVRs for the recount was\n\ntrue and there was no evidence they were fake.            Most importantly,\n\nContestant and her official Recount Watchers were not allowed to monitor\n\nthe integrity of where the CVRs were retrieved (1 CR 1803) the source\n\nwhere the retrieval occurred, or the copying of the CVR files to an\n\naggregated pdf file. (1 CR 886 ¶¶ 93-96). The Election Code makes it\n\n\n                                   Page 55\n\fillegal to knowingly prevent a watcher from observing an activity the\n\nwatcher is entitled to observe Election Code Section 33.061, App.34.\n\nTherefore, there was interference with poll watchers’ activities and arguably\n\nthis was a criminal violation of the Election Code.\n\n      It was Appellee’s contention that the law does not empower poll\n\nwatchers to observe anything except the printer’s regurgitation of CVRs.\n\nThe law is not clear on this point and it certainly was not sanctionable to\n\nallege the restrictions that actually did occur violated the law. Sanctions\n\nbased on the first Low factor were an abuse of discretion.\n\n      The second Low factor weighs against imposing sanctions against\n\nAppellant. There was no evidence Appellant or Rogers acted willfully or\n\nnegligently with vindictiveness in asserting that the clerk failed to print zero\n\ntapes on the day of the election since Michael Winn reported the same to\n\nPressley and the Clerk had admitted she did not in her testimony. There is\n\nno evidence Appellant or Rogers acted willfully or negligently with\n\nvindictiveness in asserting or in relying on a statistical analysis and reports\n\nfrom irate potential voters in alleging what Pressley reasonably believed\n\nwould develop convincing evidence that voters were disenfranchised by\n\nchange in voting locations and when the discovery evidence did not\n\ndevelop as she hoped dropping that allegation. While she did allege true\n\n\n                                    Page 56\n\foccurrences, supported by third party affidavits that illegal activity did occur\n\n2 CR 7620, 7333; a factor in determining whether the true outcome could\n\nbe ascertained, she did not directly accuse any particular person\n\nresponsible for that activity”. (See earlier discussion not repeated here.)\n\n      Appellant conducted her own reasonable inquiry which evidences this\n\ncase was filed in good faith and not out of the kind of ill will or bad motive\n\nwhich is the inquiry in the second Low factor. Since Appellant did not\n\nengage in any conduct for which the court had the authority to impose\n\nsanctions, it committed reversible error in doing so.\n\n      The third Low factor, the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the\n\noffender, may weigh slightly but insignificantly in favor of awarding\n\nsanctions against Rogers. Rogers is an experienced attorney who has\n\nhandled election contests previously and holds himself out as being\n\nknowledgeable regarding election contests. This knowledge supports his\n\nuse of the true facts alleged showing no images of ballots and numerous\n\nirregularities and mistakes could legally permit a court to exercise\n\ndiscretion to hold that the true outcome of the election could not be\n\nascertained. In any event Roger’s knowledge experience and expertise\n\ncannot justify sanctions against Pressley who justifiably relied on the ability\n\nof her lawyer.   Although Pressley has a PhD in Chemistry, a business\n\n\n                                    Page 57\n\fowner and is actively involved in her community, and has appeared before\n\nAustin City Council at least thirty times. She was personally involved in\n\nproposing drafts to her attorney for portions of the Contests and discovery.\n\nThis does not mean that Pressley had the knowledge, expertise and\n\nexperience in election law and contests that would make any of her actions\n\nin this case sanctionable. The focus of this factor is clearly did the\n\nsanctioned person know the conduct was sanctionable? Clearly Pressley’s\n\nresume does not fit into this factor. At best, it shows that she is not stupid\n\nand is active in her community. Chemists and business owners who are\n\nactive in their community should not be more likely to be sanctioned for\n\nthose reasons. Indeed her PhD in Chemistry weighs against sanction of\n\nany kind because it gives credibility to the statistical analysis she did as\n\npart of her reasonable inquiry before hiring Rogers to file this case since a\n\nchemistry doctorate clearly requires intimate knowledge of statistics.\n\n      The fourth Low factor, any prior history of sanctionable conduct on\n\nthe part of the offender weighs against the imposition of sanctions. There\n\nis no evidence of such a prior history.\n\n      The fifth Low factor, the reasonableness and necessity of the out-of-\n\npocket expenses incurred by the offended person as a result of the\n\nmisconduct weighs against the imposition of sanctions because Appellee\n\n\n                                    Page 58\n\fhas not paid any attorney’s fees and will not be sued for them. 3 Suppl. RR\n\n79, line 6 through 80, line 6. Appellee is not out of pocket for attorney’s\n\nfees and will never be required to pay any attorney’s fees. 3 Suppl. RR 79,\n\nline 6 through 80, line 6. There was no evidence at the sanctions hearing\n\nof the reasonableness of Appellee’s out of pocket expenses or that they\n\nwere incurred as the result of any particular misconduct by Appellant or\n\nRogers.\n\n      The sixth Low factor, the nature and extent of prejudice, apart from\n\nout-of-pocket expenses weighs against the imposition of sanctions. There\n\nwas no evidence of this at the hearing. The only relevant evidence was\n\nthat he was never accused of any personal misconduct so he could not\n\nhave been prejudiced.\n\n      The seventh Low factor, the relative culpability of client and counsel,\n\nis relevant as to which person to assess how much of the sanctions if\n\nsanctions were appropriate, the evidence of Appellant proving assistance\n\nto her attorney has little if any significance since many clients assist their\n\nattorneys for various reasons including their better familiarity with the facts\n\nand a hope of saving money. Her involvement was not much more than\n\nany client of providing information of the facts to the attorney and being\n\nsure they were accurately represented in the pleadings. (2 Suppl. RR 42\n\n\n                                    Page 59\n\fline 23 to 43, line 25). These normal activities by Appellant should not\n\nweigh in favor of sanctions in the Low analysis of sanction imposition.\n\nThere was no evidence of any action by Appellant contributed to the\n\npleading found by the trial court to be sanctionable (zero tapes, voting\n\nlocations or refusing to allow poll watchers and the candidate to see\n\nvarious aspects of the printing of the CVRs).        Indeed all of Appellant’s\n\nfactual allegations were true and had some evidentiary support as outlined\n\nand attached to the various Contest pleadings and as testified to at the\n\nsanctions hearing.\n\n      The eighth Low factor, the risk of chilling the specific type of litigation\n\ninvolved, also weighs heavily against awarding sanctions.           This factor\n\nweighs against awarding sanctions of $90,000.00 for filing an election\n\ncontest 44.44% of which are assessed against the Candidate because\n\ndoing so will obviously have a chilling effect on any decision by another\n\ncandidate to exercise their statutory right to file an election contest for fear\n\nthat a court who holds they failed to prove their case by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence at trial or in response to a Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment will impose crippling sanctions on them. The consequences of\n\nchilling a candidate from even attempting to prove the wrong candidate is\n\nguiding our public policy is so consequential that the huge monetary\n\n\n                                     Page 60\n\fsanctions awarded in this case would allow a person to serve as an elected\n\nofficial no matter how many election laws were violated and no matter how\n\nmany mistakes and irregularities occurred.        The trial court’s award is\n\ndesigned to prevent a litigant from making true allegations that a court\n\neventually decides do not persuade the court to call for a new election\n\nwithout incurring huge sanctions should the court rule against the\n\ncandidate. What lawyer will ever take an election contest case if he will\n\nexpose himself and his firm to $50,000 in sanctions? This case, if it stands,\n\nwill ring the death knoll of the right to contest elections provided by our\n\nLegislature. This factor is designed to be sure sanctions will not have the\n\neffect of discouraging citizens from exercising their constitutional, statutory\n\nor common law rights of access to courts. The trial court’s action has the\n\nprecise effect sought to be prevented by proper consideration of this factor.\n\n      The ninth Low factor, the impact of the sanction on the offender,\n\nincluding the offender’s ability to pay a monetary sanction, also weighs\n\nagainst awarding sanctions. Appellant has very few assets that can be\n\nused to pay sanctions and Appellee offered no evidence of the extent to\n\nwhich she needs her assets to pay normal living expenses. This Court can\n\nsee that what she has and her husband earns is needed to start a business\n\n(the LLC assets), and to live on. There is no evidence she still has any of\n\n\n                                    Page 61\n\fthe $40,000 she raised to pay expenses in this case.        The undisputed\n\nevidence is that her costs have greatly exceeded that amount already. 2\n\nSuppl. 68, line 20 through 70, line 16. The $170,000 that belongs to an\n\nindependent entity is not hers and could not be subject to seizure to pay\n\nthe sanctions. 2 Suppl. RR 67, line 23 – 68, line 13. Here there is no\n\nevidence that she has any of the profit from the sale of her home or how\n\nmuch of the sales price was profit. 2 Suppl. RR 63, line 14 through 64, line\n\n14. She is no longer making a salary. 2 Suppl. RR 70, lines 11 - 14. Her\n\nhusband’s earning capacity is not an asset that can be currently liquidated\n\nto pay sanctions and does make her more able to pay monetary sanctions.\n\nShe has basically has $1,000 in assets, $6,000 counting her husband’s\n\nassets. (2 Suppl. RR 65, line 12 to 66, line 19) The $40,000 award is\n\ngreatly in access of the assets she has available to pay the sanctions.\n\nAppellee did not identify or prove Appellant’s existing liabilities and\n\ntherefore, a full accounting of her net assets could not be assessed by the\n\nCourt. Appellee accepted the burden of proving liabilities to show net worth\n\n(2 Suppl. RR 61, lines 7-11) and never did it. (2 Suppl. RR 61 line 1 to 62,\n\nline 19). The focus of this Low factor is to be sure the trial court does not\n\nimpose sanctions in an amount absent proof there are current assets of the\n\nperson being sanctioned to pay them without bankrupting her. The court\n\n\n                                   Page 62\n\fdid not have enough evidence to ascertain whether or not it was complying\n\nwith this Low factor before imposing the sanctions imposed in this case.\n\n      The tenth Low factor, the impact of the sanction on the offended\n\nparty, including the offended person’s need for compensation, also weighs\n\nagainst awarding sanctions. There is no evidence of Appellee’s need for\n\ncompensation nor that the sanction would have a positive impact on him.\n\nSince it has been made clear that he is not accused of any wrongdoing, he\n\ndoes not to point to an award of sanctions as evidence of vindication.\n\n      The eleventh Low factor, the relative magnitude of sanction\n\nnecessary to achieve the goal or goals of the sanction, also weighs against\n\nawarding sanctions. The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section\n\n10.004 states that the sanction must be limited to what is sufficient to deter\n\nrepetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly\n\nsituated. There cannot be any more challenges before the court of appeals\n\nrules so either there will be no more suits because the CVR only practice\n\nviolates the election code or everyone will know this is not a winnable\n\nargument and will not go through the unnecessary expense of litigation.\n\nFurthermore, an award of sanctions of $90,000 is manifestly greater than is\n\nnecessary to deter the conduct in this case while not chilling future election\n\ncontest proceedings. The award of sanctions calculated by attorney’s fees\n\n\n                                    Page 63\n\frequires that there was no reasonable inquiry made. As discussed above,\n\nPressley made a reasonable inquiry into the truth of her allegations and\n\nRogers asserted causes of action based on those facts described by the\n\nelection code and several cases holding that mistakes, illegal conduct and\n\nirregularities alone could be relied on by a trial court in calling for a new\n\nelection without abusing its discretion. In addition, the amount of sanctions\n\nwas manifestly excessive since this case involved responses to written\n\ndiscovery (erroneously cut off by the court) and two depositions followed by\n\nthe granting of summary judgement. It was not a jury trial or even a trial\n\nbefore the Court. As described above, the magnitude of the sanctions in\n\nthis case will chill future candidates from exercising their statutory,\n\nconstitutional and common law rights and lawyers from representing them\n\nand clearly not warranted by the actions found by the Court to be\n\nsanctionable.\n\n     The twelfth Low factor, burdens on the court system attributable to\n\nthe misconduct, weighs against awarding sanctions. There is no evidence\n\nthat this no evidence Summary Judgment burdened the Court system any\n\nmore than any other election contest.        The judge would have to be\n\nappointed and hear the case even if allegations of criminal conduct, voter\n\n\n\n\n                                   Page 64\n\fdisenfranchisement and failure to print CVRs on the day of the election\n\nwere not issues in this case.\n\n     The thirteenth Low factor, the degree to which the offended person’s\n\nown behavior caused the expenses for which recovery is sought, weighs\n\ninsignificantly against awarding sanctions. Appellant admits that Appellee\n\ndid nothing wrong in the conduct of the election and has never accused him\n\nof any misconduct.\n\n     A review of the Low factors that the Court was required to look to as\n\nguiding rules and principals in deciding whether to impose sanctions and if\n\nso how much shows the court abused its discretion in imposing the\n\nsanctions of $90,000 for a case at the point of granting a summary\n\njudgment ($40,000 against Pressley and $50,000 against her lawyer).\n\n    Sub Issue 4. DID THE TRIAL COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION\nBY IMPOSING SANCTIONS BASED ON ATTORNEY’S FEES IN THE\nEVENT OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL APPEAL WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE?\n\n     The trial court, in another exhibition of arbitrary and capricious action\n\nand in a total disregard of guiding principles imposed conditional sanctions\n\non Appellant if she was not successful in pursuing her appeal. Suppl. IV\n\nCR 54 App.3. There was no request for these sanctions and absolutely no\n\nevidence of what would be reasonable necessary attorney’s fees that\n\nwould be incurred in the event of appeal.\n\n\n                                   Page 65\n\f      Awarding attorney’s fees without any evidence to support them is a\n\nclear abuse of discretion. Great American Reserve Ins. Co. v. Britton, 406\n\nS.W.2d 901, 907; (Tex. 1966); Lesikar v. Rappeport, 33 S.W.3d 282, 308\n\n(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2000 no pet.) In addition as pointed out above\n\nAppellee would not be pressed to pay any attorney’s fees. Furthermore, a\n\ngreat portion of the appeal is devoted to the issue of whether a CVR\n\nsatisfies the statutory requirement of maintaining an image of the ballot for\n\nwhich no sanctions were found warranted.\n\n      Finally sanctions for filing a frivolous appeal is within the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of this Court. Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 45.\n\nWhile a trial court may award attorney’s fees for a losing appeal when the\n\nlaw allows it to award attorney’s fees, (there is no statutory authority for\n\nawarding attorney’s fees in an election contest) a trial court is not vested\n\nwith jurisdiction or discretion to award sanctions for appealing its decision.\n\nThe trial court in this case therefore abused its discretion in awarding\n\nsanctions measured by attorney’s fees on appeal without any evidence of\n\nthat amount or reasonableness thereof and contingent on what happens in\n\nthe future with respect to the disposition of an appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 66\n\f                               CONCLUSION\n\n      The trial court committed reversible error by granting Appellee’s No\n\nEvidence Motion for Summary Judgment because there was more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence that the clerk counted CVRs instead of and without\n\nimages of ballots and that there were mistakes, irregularities, and other\n\nevidence that tended to prove that the true outcome of the election could\n\nnot be ascertained. Therefore, this Court should reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment and remand it to the trial court for trial.     The trial court also\n\ncommitted reversal error in awarding sanctions in the absence of evidence\n\nthat sanctionable conduct occurred and in violation of the Low factors and\n\nappellate sanctions measured by attorney’s fees without any evidence.\n\nTherefore, the sanctions order of the court should be reversed and\n\nrendered that Appellee take nothing by his request for sanctions.\n\n                                  PRAYER\n\n      Based on the record and the law cited herein, Appellant prays this\n\nhonorable Court to reverse the trial courts judgment granting Appellee a\n\nsummary judgment and to remand it with instructions to permit requested\n\ndiscovery of the ESlate manual, and the JBC and to examine the eSlate\n\nprogram and its functioning in tallying the votes in this election and conduct\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with the holding that CVRs do not satisfy the\n\n\n                                    Page 67\n\fstatutory requirement of maintaining a ballot image and that the trial court\n\nmay void the election if it believes in its discretion that irregularities and\n\nmistakes makes it impossible to ascertain the true outcome of the election\n\nwithout requiring appellant to identify particular votes that were affected.\n\nAppellant also asks the court to reverse and render that Appellee take\n\nnothing by its Motion for Sanctions.\n\n                                   Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                   /s/ Mark A.

In a case where a contestee won an election by three votes, a trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by declaring an election void under Tex. Elec.

Where a trial court was presented with clear and convincing evidence that illegal votes were\ncounted in an election for places on the board of trustees for an independent school district, that\nofficials failed to count some legal votes, and that election judges made mistakes that materially\naffected and obscured the true outcome of the election, the trial court properly declared the\nelection void and ordered a new election; legally sufficient evidence supported the trial court’s\nimplied findings that 77 votes were illegally cast and that, with respect to 436 voters, mistakes by\nelection clerks in failing to record information required by the election code made it impossible\nto determine whether those votes were legally cast and countable because, among the undisputed\ntestimony presented by an election contestant was that: (1) 72 voters listed on the combination\nforms were registered voters but, according to the online database, did not reside in the school\ndistrict at issue; (2) five voters voted in the wrong precinct; (3) with respect to 127 voters who\ncast their votes on election day, the names or registration certificate numbers could not be\nlocated on the list of registered voters, either because the name did not appear on the list at all or\nbecause there were multiple, identical names on the list that might or might not have been the\nvoter, making it impossible to tell if those votes were legally cast; (4) four voters on election day\nvoted, but provided an incorrect voter registration number, and no address was provided, making\nit impossible to tell if those voters were qualified and properly accepted for voting, or whether\nthey had been required to cast a provisional ballot; and (5) with respect to voting during early\nvoting, because there was a lack of an address on the combination forms and the inability to\nmatch a particular voter with a particular listing on the online database, the contestant could not\ndetermine the eligibility of 208 voters from one polling place and 97 voters at another polling\nplace.

In an election contest under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003(a), a trial court was not required\nto accept the opinion of an expert concerning the unreliability of electronic voting devices where\nhe admitted that he had not examined or tested any machines used in the county; his conclusions\nwere unsupported by any analysis or reasoning, and a county elections administrator testified to\nthe contrary by pointing to the fact that signature rosters almost perfectly matched the number of\npaper votes. The trial court found that the election day count was valid; even if a court-\nsupervised recount was accurate, the benefit to the incumbent was insufficient to affect the\noutcome of the election.

Statements by the mayor, cited as newly discovered evidence in a motion for new trial, were\nimmaterial to the scope of inquiry in an election contest because the statements did not address\nmatters discussed in either the measure or the proposition and consequently did not bear on the\n\fquestion of whether voters were misled by the proposition. Dacus v. Parker, 383 S.W.3d 557,\n2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 5420 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. 2012, no pet. h.)\n  Governments: Local Governments: Elections\n\n6. Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, because appellant indicated\nthat he had no evidence that anybody failed to count legal votes and no evidence to prove the\nelection results were wrong or that the voting machines were not working, and testified he had\nno evidence of any illegal votes. Vazaldua v. Muoz, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 6701\n(June 20, 2014, no pet. h.)\n\n7. Statements by the mayor, cited as newly discovered evidence in a motion for new trial, were\nimmaterial to the scope of inquiry in an election contest because the statements did not address\nmatters discussed in either the measure or the proposition and consequently did not bear on the\nquestion of whether voters were misled by the proposition. Dacus v. Parker, 383 S.W.3d 557,\n2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 5420 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. 2012, no pet. h.)\n\n8. Given that the parties utilized the trial court to resolve an issue of disputed fact and appellants\nhad a right to the court’s review to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its\ndiscretion in resolving the issues in this election contest, the court declined to issue sanctions.\nMcDuffee v. Miller, 327 S.W.3d 808, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 8676 (Tex. App. Beaumont 2010,\nno pet.).\n\n9. Clearly, the Legislature contemplated the use of election contest proceedings to resolve\ndisputes concerning whether votes were countable. McDuffee v. Miller, 327 S.W.3d 808, 2010\nTex. App. LEXIS 8676 (Tex. App. Beaumont 2010, no pet.).\n\n10. Legislature gave district courts a significant role in election contest proceedings, given that in\nan election contest, the district court determines whether the canvassed result includes illegal\nvotes, under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003, and the trial court is expressly authorized to\nsubtract illegal votes from the official total for the candidate, under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §\n221.011; thus, it does not appear that the Legislature intended the registrar’s role of hearing\ncomplaints about the validity of a voter’s registration to be the exclusive method of assuring the\naccuracy of elections. McDuffee v. Miller, 327 S.W.3d 808, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 8676 (Tex.\nApp. Beaumont 2010, no pet.).\n\n11. Because the incumbent directors prevailed in the trial court, on appeal the court reviewed the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the judgment and determined if the trier-of-fact could\nhave formed a firm belief that the residences of the voters casting the challenged votes were not\nwithin the right district on the date they signed a voter’s registration application, nor when they\nvoted, nor subsequently. McDuffee v. Miller, 327 S.W.3d 808, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 8676\n(Tex. App. Beaumont 2010, no pet.).\n\n12. Trial court erred in awarding summary judgment to a mayor in a city resident’s action\nchallenging a special election in which three proposed city charter amendments were passed\nbecause the expert testimony offered by the resident raised a genuine issue of material fact\nregarding whether irregularities in the conduct of the election rendered it impossible to determine\n\fthe majority of the voters’ true will under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003(a). Duncan-Hubert v.\nMitchell, 310 S.W.3d 92, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 1889 (Tex. App. Dallas 2010)pet. deniedNo.\n10-0493, 2010 Tex. LEXIS 729 (Tex. Oct. 1, 2010).\n\n13. Challenge that does not concern whether the outcome of the election was incorrect for one of\nthe four reasons listed in the statute is, by definition, not an election contest under Tex. Elec.\nCode Ann. § 221.003. City of Granite Shoals v. Winder, 280 S.W.3d 550, 2009 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 1925 (Tex. App. Austin 2009)pet. deniedNo. 09-0368, 2010 Tex. LEXIS 152 (Tex. Feb.\n12, 2010).\n\n14. Because property owners’ suit for declaratory judgment did not raise any of the issues that\nhad to be resolved in an election contest, they were not required to bring their challenge as an\nelection contest under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003. City of Granite Shoals v. Winder, 280\nS.W.3d 550, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 1925 (Tex. App. Austin 2009)pet. deniedNo. 09-0368, 2010\nTex. LEXIS 152 (Tex. Feb. 12, 2010).\n\n15. In an election contest under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003(a), a trial court was not\nrequired to accept the opinion of an expert concerning the unreliability of electronic voting\ndevices where he admitted that he had not examined or tested any machines used in the county;\nhis conclusions were unsupported by any analysis or reasoning, and a county elections\nadministrator testified to the contrary by pointing to the fact that signature rosters almost\nperfectly matched the number of paper votes. The trial court found that the election day count\nwas valid; even if a court-supervised recount was accurate, the benefit to the incumbent was\ninsufficient to affect the outcome of the election. Flores v. Cuellar, 269 S.W.3d 657, 2008 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 6610 (Tex. App. San Antonio 2008, no pet.)\n\n16. Election was properly declared void where two voters testified that they were prevented from\nvoting in a county commissioner race due to their placement in an improper voting precinct; the\nvoters’ testimony did not amount to impeachment, the fact that the voters were able to cast a\nballot did not preclude a finding that they were prevented from voting, and they had no\ncorrection duty under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 15.021(a). The trial court was unable to determine\nthe true outcome of the election under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.012. Perez v. Alanis, No. 04-\n08-00276-CV, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 6127 (Tex. App. San Antonio Aug. 13, 2008, no pet.).\n\n17. In a case where a contestee won an election by three votes, a trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by declaring an election void under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.012 where seven\nvoters testified that they were precluded from voting in a county commissioner’s race due to\ntheir being assigned to the incorrect precinct. McCurry v. Lewis, 259 S.W.3d 369, 2008 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 5029 (Tex. App. Amarillo 2008, no pet.).\n\n18. If a sufficient number of voters are rendered potentially ineligible by mistakes made during\nthe recording process to account for the entire margin of victory, a trial court is within its\ndiscretion to declare an election void because it is impossible to determine the true outcome of\nthe election. Gonzalez v. Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 921 (Tex. App.\nCorpus Christi 2008)pet. dism’d w.o.j.No. 08-0132, 2008 Tex. LEXIS 194 (Tex. Mar. 4, 2008),\nreh'g denied, No. 13-07-704-CV, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 4339 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Mar.\n\f24, 2008, no pet.).\n\n19. Where a trial court was presented with clear and convincing evidence that illegal votes were\ncounted in an election for places on the board of trustees for an independent school district, that\nofficials failed to count some legal votes, and that election judges made mistakes that materially\naffected and obscured the true outcome of the election, the trial court properly declared the\nelection void and ordered a new election; legally sufficient evidence supported the trial court’s\nimplied findings that 77 votes were illegally cast and that, with respect to 436 voters, mistakes by\nelection clerks in failing to record information required by the election code made it impossible\nto determine whether those votes were legally cast and countable because, among the undisputed\ntestimony presented by an election contestant was that: (1) 72 voters listed on the combination\nforms were registered voters but, according to the online database, did not reside in the school\ndistrict at issue; (2) five voters voted in the wrong precinct; (3) with respect to 127 voters who\ncast their votes on election day, the names or registration certificate numbers could not be\nlocated on the list of registered voters, either because the name did not appear on the list at all or\nbecause there were multiple, identical names on the list that might or might not have been the\nvoter, making it impossible to tell if those votes were legally cast; (4) four voters on election day\nvoted, but provided an incorrect voter registration number, and no address was provided, making\nit impossible to tell if those voters were qualified and properly accepted for voting, or whether\nthey had been required to cast a provisional ballot; and (5) with respect to voting during early\nvoting, because there was a lack of an address on the combination forms and the inability to\nmatch a particular voter with a particular listing on the online database, the contestant could not\ndetermine the eligibility of 208 voters from one polling place and 97 voters at another polling\nplace. Gonzalez v. Villarreal, 251 S.W.3d 763, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 921 (Tex. App. Corpus\nChristi 2008)pet. dism’d w.o.j.No. 08-0132, 2008 Tex. LEXIS 194 (Tex.

Origin of the requirement that the plaintiff in an election contest prove the allegations by\nclear and convincing evidence is not clear to the court, as the court finds no such requirement in\nthe applicable part of the Texas Election Code for purposes of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003;\nthe earliest case imposing the burden is Johnston v. Peters and it thus appears to be a judge-made\nrule, but the court followed the majority of election-contest cases in reviewing this appeal under\nthe higher standard. Willet v. Cole, 249 S.W.3d 585, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 514 (Tex. App.\nWaco 2008, no pet.).\n\n21. Appellee had the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that challenged voters\ndid not reside, as defined in Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 1.015, at a vet clinic, thus making them\nineligible to vote under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 11.001(a)(1)-(3); because the evidence was\nsufficient to produce a belief that the voters did not reside at the clinic, given witness testimony\nthat the voters did not live, reside, sleep, or stay at the clinic and the evidence that their residence\nwas outside the city, the trial court did not err in overturning the election under Tex. Elec. Code\nAnn. § 221.003. Willet v. Cole, 249 S.W.3d 585, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 514 (Tex. App. Waco\n2008, no pet.).\n\n22. Appellee’s motion to issue a mandate immediately was granted, good cause having been\n\fshown, and the clerk was directed to issue the mandate at the same time as the judgment\naffirming the trial court’s overturning of an election under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003, for\npurposes of Tex. R. App. P. 18. Willet v. Cole, 249 S.W.3d 585, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 514\n(Tex. App. Waco 2008, no pet.).\n\n23. Because some people who were deeded land by an election contestee did not meet the\nresidency requirements under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 1.015(a), a trial court did not err by\nfinding that their votes were illegally counted under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003(a)(1) and\nordering a new county commissioner election; a ranch hand who stayed in different places at\nnight, a student attending school in another town, and a person that merely visited the county in\nquestion were not found to be residents, even though two of them owned land there; however,\nthree others who stayed in a mobile home on property in the county were properly found to be\nresidents. Kiehne v. Jones, 247 S.W.3d 259, 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 4869 (Tex. App. El Paso\n2007)pet. deniedNo. 07-0607, 2007 Tex. LEXIS 855 (Tex. Sept. 14, 2007).\n\n24. Trial court properly refused to include in a final election tally three ballots in appellant’s\nfavor that had been excluded based on ballot application and carrier envelope signatures that did\nnot match; the ballot board acted properly in comparing the signatures on the ballot applications\nand carrier envelopes to determine whether they were signed by the same person. Harrison v.\nStanley, 193 S.W.3d 581, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 1906 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2006), reh'g\ndenied, 193 S.W.3d 581, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 4119 (Tex.

Location of temporary polling places for a school district’s special bond election, which\nincluded a football stadium during a high school football game, was not improper under Tex.\nElec. Code Ann. § 221.003; the school district had authority to establish temporary polling\nplaces pursuant to Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 85.062(a)(2). Bielamowicz v. Cedar Hill Indep. Sch.\nDist., 136 S.W.3d 718, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 4645 (Tex. App. Dallas 2004)pet. deniedNo. 04-\n0768, 2004 Tex. LEXIS 947 (Tex. Oct. 8, 2004).\n\n26. Complaints alleging that city officials prevented eligible voters from voting or that city\nofficials, by failing to publish or republish an ordinance, engaged in fraud or illegal conduct were\nall grounds within the scope of an election contest review as defined by Tex. Elec. Code §\n221.003. Rossano v. Townsend, 9 S.W.3d 357, 1999 Tex. App. LEXIS 8971 (Tex. App. Houston\n14th Dist. 1999, no pet.).\n\n27. Although election officials combined the locations of certain polling places, leaving some\nprecincts without a polling location in violation of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 43.001, the violations\nwere not sufficient to invalidate the results of the election pursuant to Tex. Elec. Code Ann. §\n221.003 as there was no testimony offered regarding any eligible voters who were prevented\nfrom voting nor were there any allegations that any election official engaged in illegal conduct or\nof other election irregularities. Honts v. Shaw, 975 S.W.2d 816, 1998 Tex. App. LEXIS 5666\n(Tex. App. Austin 1998).\n\n28. Although Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003(a)(2)(C) does not define the term “mistake,” the\nnature of the mistake contemplated by the statute must be one of such magnitude as to affect the\n\ftrue outcome of the election. Honts v. Shaw, 975 S.W.2d 816, 1998 Tex. App. LEXIS 5666\n(Tex. App. Austin 1998).\n\n29. Judgment in an election contestant’s action was proper where there was no evidence that the\ncontestees committed election fraud or that there were a sufficient number of illegal votes cast\nthat would have changed the election’s outcome. Frias v. Board of Trustees, 584 S.W.2d 944,\n1979 Tex. App. LEXIS 3969 (Tex. Civ. App. El Paso), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 996, 100 S. Ct.\n531, 62 L. Ed. 2d 426, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 4141 (U.S. 1979).\n\n30. Write-in candidate’s suit contesting a school board trustee election failed where no evidence\nwas introduced that there was any voting irregularity, that any voter was denied the right to vote,\nnor that any voter would have voted differently had write-in candidate’s name appeared on the\nballot, so there was no evidence to show that the results of the election would have been\nmaterially changed. Perez v. Alarcon, 491 S.W.2d 688, 1973 Tex. App. LEXIS 2559 (Tex. Civ.\nApp. El Paso 1973, no writ).\n\n31. The burden was on the contestant in an election contest to allege and prove either that a\ndifferent result would have been reached by counting or not counting certain specified votes, or\nthat irregularities in the conduct of an election were such as to render it impossible to determine\nthe will of the majority of the voters participating. Ware v. Crystal City Independent School\nDist., 489 S.W.2d 190, 1972 Tex. App. LEXIS 2379 (Tex. Civ. App. San Antonio 1972, no\nwrit).\n   Governments: State & Territorial Governments: Elections\n\n32. Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, because appellant indicated\nthat he had no evidence that anybody failed to count legal votes and no evidence to prove the\nelection results were wrong or that the voting machines were not working, and testified he had\nno evidence of any illegal votes. Vazaldua v. Muoz, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 6701\n(June 20, 2014, no pet. h.)\n\n33. Individual did not follow the necessary procedures under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § /Aa84.032\nto cancel her mailed-in ballot, and thus the trial court did not err in finding that the individual\nwas not eligible to vote in a runoff. Woods v. Legg, 363 S.W.3d 710, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS\n6281 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n34. Individual was improperly placed in district two and forwarded such a mail-in ballot instead\nof a district one ballot; the record did not indicate whether the individual was aware of the\nproblem or whether she intended to vote for a certain candidate, and the trial court did not err in\nfinding that the board member did not show that the individual was prevented from voting for the\ncandidate of her choice. Woods v. Legg, 363 S.W.3d 710, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6281 (Tex.\nApp. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n35. Individual had lived in housing with district one, but he could not return home after a\nhurricane; at trial, he was living in district two, and the trial court did not err in finding that the\nindividual was not eligible to vote in district one at the time of the runoff election. Woods v.\nLegg, 363 S.W.3d 710, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6281 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet.\n\fh.)\n\n36. Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 15.021(a) requires the voter to ensure that accurate registration\ninformation is provided, and the application for registration requires either the applicant’s state-\nissued identification number or the last four digits of her social security number; an individual’s\napplication contained neither, and the evidence supported the finding that she was ineligible to\nvote at the runoff election. Woods v. Legg, 363 S.W.3d 710, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6281 (Tex.\nApp. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n37. Individual was told she could not vote because she lived in Houston, and the trial court did\nnot err in finding that she was not an eligible voter on the runoff election date. Woods v. Legg,\n363 S.W.3d 710, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6281 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n38. Evidence did not show whether an individual mailed in her ballot timely, and the individual’s\nmother testified that the individual was not allowed to vote, and the evidence did not support the\nboard member’s burden under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003. Woods v. Legg, 363 S.W.3d\n710, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6281 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n39. Individual was not allowed to vote in a district one runoff election because her new address\nwas in district six; she wanted to remain in her rented house in district one, but she had no\ndefinite plans to return to that district, and the trial court did not err in finding that the evidence\ndid not show that she was a qualified registered voter. Woods v. Legg, 363 S.W.3d 710, 2011\nTex. App. LEXIS 6281 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n40. Evidence supported the conclusion that individuals were not statutorily eligible to vote in\ndistrict one at the time of the runoff election, nor did the record show their intent to vote in the\nelection or any denial of the intent to vote. Woods v. Legg, 363 S.W.3d 710, 2011 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 6281 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n41. Evidence supported the finding that a person was not an eligible voter because she was not a\nresident of a certain district at the time of the runoff election and she did not show a present\nintent to return to that district, for purposes of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 1.015. Woods v. Legg,\n363 S.W.3d 710, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6281 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n42. Council member argued that the trial court erred in failing to credit evidence to show that the\noutcome was not correct because of mistakes in assigning certain voters in one precinct to\nanother precinct, for purposes of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. § 221.003(a)(2)(C), but the record did\nnot contain testimony from any of these voters, and the trial court did not err in finding that the\nevidence did not rise to the level of clear proof that any voter was deprived of a vote for the\ncandidate of his choice. Woods v. Legg, 363 S.W.3d 710, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6281 (Tex.\nApp. Houston 1st Dist. 2011, no pet. h.)\n\n43. Individual admitted that she decided not to complete the registration card and she had no\nreason to believe that, had she done so, she would not have been given a provisional ballot; the\ntrial court did not err in finding that a council member failed to present clear evidence that an\n\felection worker wrongfully denied the individual a chance to vote in a runoff.

In determining whether to award damages, the court must not consider any matter\nthat does not appear in the record, briefs, or other papers filed in the court of appeals.\n\fTexas Rule of Civil Procedure\nRule 11 Agreements to Be in Writing\n\nUnless otherwise provided in these rules, no agreement between attorneys or parties touching any\nsuit pending will be enforced unless it be in writing, signed and filed with the papers as part of the\nrecord, or unless it be made in open court and entered of record.\n\f   192.3. Scope of Discovery.\n       o   (a) Generally. --In general, a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter that\n           is not privileged and is relevant to the subject matter of the pending action, whether it\n           relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or the claim or defense\n           of any other party. It is not a ground for objection that the information sought will be\n           inadmissible at trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to\n           the discovery of admissible evidence.\n       o   (b) Documents and Tangible Things. --A party may obtain discovery of the\n           existence, description, nature, custody, condition, location, and contents of\n           documents and tangible things (including papers, books, accounts, drawings, graphs,\n           charts, photographs, electronic or videotape recordings, data, and data compilations)\n           that constitute or contain matters relevant to the subject matter of the action. A\n           person is required to produce a document or tangible thing that is within the person's\n           possession, custody, or control.\n       o   (c) Persons with Knowledge of Relevant Facts. --A party may obtain discovery of\n           the name, address, and telephone number of persons having knowledge of relevant\n           facts, and a brief statement of each identified person's connection with the case. A\n           person has knowledge of relevant facts when that person has or may have\n           knowledge of any discoverable matter. The person need not have admissible\n           information or personal knowledge of the facts. An expert is \"a person with\n           knowledge of relevant facts\" only if that knowledge was obtained first-hand or if it\n           was not obtained in preparation for trial or in anticipation of litigation.\n       o   (d) Trial Witnesses. --A party may obtain discovery of the name, address, and\n           telephone number of any person who is expected to be called to testify at trial. This\n           paragraph does not apply to rebuttal or impeaching witnesses the necessity of whose\n           testimony cannot reasonably be anticipated before trial.\n\f          Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n   193.4. Hearing and Ruling on Objections and Assertions of Privilege.\n       o (a) Hearing. --Any party may at any reasonable time request a\n          hearing on an objection or claim of privilege asserted under this rule.\n          The party making the objection or asserting the privilege must present\n          any evidence necessary to support the objection or privilege. The\n          evidence may be testimony presented at the hearing or affidavits\n          served at least seven days before the hearing or at such other\n          reasonable time as the court permits. If the court determines that an in\n          camera review of some or all of the requested discovery is necessary,\n          that material or information must be segregated and produced to the\n          court in a sealed wrapper within a reasonable time following the\n          hearing.\n       o (b) Ruling. --To the extent the court sustains the objection or claim\n          of privilege, the responding party has no further duty to respond to\n          that request. To the extent the court overrules the objection or claim of\n          privilege, the responding party must produce the requested material or\n          information within 30 days after the court's ruling or at such time as\n          the court orders. A party need not request a ruling on that party's own\n          objection or assertion of privilege to preserve the objection or\n          privilege.\n       o (c) Use of Material or Information Withheld Under Claim of\n          Privilege. --A party may not use - at any hearing or trial - material or\n          information withheld from discovery under a claim of privilege,\n          including a claim sustained by the court, without timely amending or\n          supplementing the party's response to that discovery.\n\f\f\f\f\f\fSec. 231.009.

DID THE TRIAL COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION\nBY IMPOSING SANCTIONS BASED ON ATTORNEY’S FEES IN THE\nEVENT OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL APPEAL WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE?\n\n\n                          Page 2\n\f                            STATEMENT OF CASE\n\n        The original Clerk’s Record is not sequentially numbered by volume.\n\nThere is one filed on July 2, 2015 that has volume 1 and 2 with pages\n\nnumbered from 1 to 5228 and there is another filed on July 29, 2015 which\n\nis not designated as a supplemental record and has volumes 1, 2 and 3\n\nwith pages numbered from 1 to 7635. In order for the court to able to locate\n\nthe place in the record cited in this brief, Appellant will refer to the Clerk’s\n\nRecord filed on July 2, 2015 as 1 CR and the one filed on July 29, 2015 as\n\n2 CR.\n\n        This is an election contest case. It is therefore to be expedited by this\n\nCourt. Tex. Elec. Code § 231.009. App.30. Appellant asserted below that\n\nthe Travis County Clerk failed to comply with state law to maintain image of\n\na ballot and there were so many mistakes and irregularities and illegal\n\nvotes counted and legal votes not counted that, although the exact vote\n\nchange is not capable of proof, nevertheless the Court should invalidate the\n\nelection because the true outcome of the election cannot be ascertained,\n\nTex. Elec. Code § 221.003. (1 CR 862). App.22.\n\n        The trial court granted Appellee’s No Evidence Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment and entered a final judgment. (1 CR 4605; App.1) Appellant filed\n\na Notice of Accelerated Appeal.(1 CR 5224; App.4) Subsequently, on June\n\n\n                                      Page 3\n\f24, 2015, the trial court entered an order that stated it was an amended\n\norder, but omitted a Mother Hubbard clause or a declaration that it was\n\nfinal, and stated it was going to award sanctions against Pressley and her\n\nattorney David Rogers. 2 CR 2060; App.2. Out of an abundance of caution,\n\nPressley filed an amended Notice of Appeal including the June, 24, 2015\n\norder. 2 CR 2062. App.5. After the hearings on the Third amendment to\n\nthe original Sanctions Motion, Suppl. IV CR 16, that had been filed before\n\nthe first final judgment on May 26, 2015, the Court entered another\n\njudgment on July 23, 2015 Suppl. IV CR 52, App.3 that granted Casar’s\n\nNo Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment, assessed sanctions based on\n\nCasar’s attorney fees in the amount of $90,000 ($50,000 against\n\nAppellant’s attorney and $40,000 against Appellant) and an additional\n\nsanction award in the event of an unsuccessful appeal, First Suppl. IV CR\n\n52; App.3. The trial court entered a separate order awarding sanctions\n\nsupported by findings of fact and conclusions of law. Suppl. IV CR 19.\n\nApp.3. Appellant filed a request for additional and amended findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law. Suppl. III CR 45; App.6. Appellant filed a Second\n\nAmended Notice of Appeal. Suppl. III CR 38. App.8. The trial court made\n\namended findings of fact and conclusions of law, Second Suppl. IV CR 3\n\nfiled on August 14, 2015; App.7.\n\n\n                                   Page 4\n\f               STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n        This case warrants and indeed demands that the Court order oral\n\nargument which is hereby requested.\n\n        This case is one of first impression as to whether an election can be\n\ndetermined by counting cast vote records only without maintaining an\n\nimage of what the electronic voting system formats as a ballot despite state\n\nlaw requiring it to do so. If a cast vote record alone is held not to constitute\n\na ballot that can be counted, other election officials in the state using\n\nelectronic voting systems may be required to modify their equipment and\n\nprocedures to comply with the Election Code. Therefore, the issues and\n\nfacts in this case need to be presented orally and the attorney’s permitted\n\nto address the Court’s concerns regarding this complicated and important\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 5\n\f                         STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n     Appellant Pressley sued to set aside the results of the run-off election\n\nfor Place 4 on the Austin City Council. CR 860.\n\n     The County Clerk determined the outcome of the election at the\n\nRecount by counting cast vote records (“CVRs”). 1 CR 1983, lines 8 - 2 5 ,\n\nand 1 CR 1984, lines 1-11.             CVRs do not have the elements of a\n\nballot required by the Texas Constitution and Texas Election Code.\n\n(Compare the appearance of a paper ballot 1 CR 1805, 2 CR 2058, and 1\n\nCR 1927, lines 14-18 with the CVR 1 CR 1803 and Ballot by Mail 2 CR\n\n2058). The Hart electronic voting system, used in the election, formats the\n\nelectronic ballot a Travis County voter sees when he votes that satisfies\n\nmost of the statutory requirements of a ballot. 1 CR 1925, line 22 to 1928,\n\nline 24; 1 CR 1805; 2 CR 2058; (2 CR 7334, lines 16 and 17. These ballot\n\nimages were not maintained by the Clerk for the run-off election (1 CR\n\n1925, line 22 to 1928, line 24; 2 CR 7333, 2 CR 2058) except for the run-off\n\nmail in ballots which were retained. The result of the mail in ballots was a\n\ntie. (2 CR 3074 column “BBM [Ballot by Mail]”; 1 CR 1938, line 23 to 1939,\n\nline 4) There were numerous “Invalid/Corrupt MBB [Mobile Ballot Box]\n\nerrors. 1 CR 2118, 2135, 2136, 2139, 2140, 2142, 2155 and 2 CR 1880,\n\n1897, 1898, 1901, 1902, 1904, 1917. The MBB are the Hart voting system\n\n\n                                   Page 6\n\fflash memory cards that stores votes as CVRs. 1 CR 2196, 1 CR 2203\n\nand there were more Invalid/Corrupt MBBs than the County Clerk had seen\n\nin all her years of conducting elections 1 CR 1978, lines 9-20; the “reader”\n\ntallying the votes was broken 1 CR 1979, lines 4-5; also security seals of\n\nthe voting machines were broken and had to be resealed 1 CR 917, 922,\n\n923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 929, 930.\n\n     The Hart voting system computer, which tallies the electronic votes,\n\nthe CVRs, was left open on several occasions and for extended periods of\n\ntime during the election and recount CR 1876, 2 CR 1883, 2 CR 1932, 2\n\nCR 1932.\n\n     The County Clerk did not believe the Tally Audit Logs which recorded\n\nand tabulated the MBB results and all of the other events in the election in\n\norder to verify the results were reliable 1 CR 1995, lines 7-13. In addition,\n\nthe County Clerk ordered her employees not to print Result/Tally tapes on\n\nthe day of the run–off election (1 CR 1865) as required by the Secretary of\n\nState (2 CR 707, 711, 726, 734). Appellant was told that election backup\n\ntapes, Zero tapes and Results/Tally tapes would not be printed on the day\n\nof the election by Mr. Winn, the Clerk’s Director of Elections; 1 CR 872, ¶\n\n42; 874, ¶ 48. Images of the ballots cast were missing; 1 CR 1982, lines\n\n19-21; A statistical analysis of the reported results of the run-off election\n\n\n                                     Page 7\n\findicated that the electronic tabulated results may not be believable (1 CR\n\n861, ¶ 3, 1 CR 863, ¶ 10, 1 CR 865 ¶ 17 through 868 ¶ 26, 1 CR 933-936).\n\nDuring the Recount, the County Clerk’s employees refused to allow the poll\n\nwatchers to witness the whole process of the printing of the CVRs from the\n\ntally computer. 2 CR 7602. Specifically, Appellant and her official Recount\n\nWatchers were not allowed to monitor the integrity of where the CVRs were\n\nretrieved, the source where the retrieval occurred, or the copying of the\n\nCVR files to an aggregated .pdf file. 1 CR 886 ¶ 93-96; 1 CR 1807\n\n      There were other irregularities and mistakes made in the conduct of\n\nthis election.   Although Appellant’s phone bank received reports from\n\nvoters who were angry that the voting locations were moved from the\n\ngeneral election locations and did not vote, and a statistical analysis was\n\ndone that showed voters from District 4 who were “die-hard voters” who\n\nconsistently voted did not vote in this run-off (2 Suppl. RR 99, line 10\n\nthrough 100 line 22.) When no one wanted to get involved as a witness\n\nshowing a disenfranchising affect the change in voting locations had on\n\nthem and the Clerk in discovery at least had some evidence the new\n\nlocations were posted at the old locations, Appellant amended her pleading\n\n(1 CR 860) and dropped the change in voting locations as a mistake that\n\n\n\n\n                                  Page 8\n\fmay have affected the outcome of the election. 2 Suppl.

All other property\n\nowned by Pressley was either membership interests in an LLC, which\n\ncannot be seized or its assets used because they belong to an independent\n\nlegal entity, or in her husband’s bank account and retirement account. 2\n\nSuppl. R.R. 65, line 12 through 66, line 19.\n\n      All facts Pressley alleged in her pleading were true.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 9\n\f                     SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n\n     This case challenges the failure to follow Election Code provision in\n\nthe conduct of an Austin City Council election. Because the Clerk did not\n\nmaintain images of ballots and counted only CVRs all votes except mail-in\n\nballots which were tied were counted illegally.      In addition there were\n\nnumerous other irregularities, mistakes and violations of the Election Code\n\nthat could lawfully allow a court to decide it was impossible to ascertain the\n\ntrue outcome of the election. For either reason supported by summary\n\njudgment evidence, the trial court committed reversible error by granting\n\nthe no evidence summary judgment and imposing sanctions for raising\n\nsuch issues.\n\n     In addition, at the request of counsel for Appellant the trial court hand\n\nwrote in the first judgment it entered that the judgment disposed of all the\n\nissues between all of the parties. Counsel for Appellee consented to and\n\nagreed to this language being inserted into the first judgment. The trial\n\ncourt then approved of this agreement and signed the first final judgment.\n\nTherefore, the parties read into the record in open court that the issue of\n\nwhether sanctions should be imposed had been resolved by agreement\n\nsatisfying the requirements of the Tex. R. Civ. P., Rule 11, and the later\n\n\n\n                                   Page 10\n\factions taken related to sanctions violated Rule 11 and it was reversible\n\nerror to impose sanctions. There was another “order” entered within the\n\ncourt’s plenary power but it did not satisfy requirements for extending its\n\nplenary jurisdiction. The last judgment entered by the court which imposed\n\nsanctions was entered after expiration of its plenary power. This means\n\nthat the only final Judgment in this case is the first one and the only issue is\n\nwhether the trial court erred in granting Appellee’s No Evidence Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.        By arguing the sanctions issues Appellant is not\n\nwaiving the argument that the only valid final judgment did not impose\n\nsanctions and sanction were barred by the Rule 11.\n\n      In addition, the trial court erroneously deprived Appellant of discovery\n\nto which she was entitled and without examining the documents claimed to\n\nbe exempt as “Proprietary” thereby preventing Pressley from obtaining\n\nevidence crucial and relevant to her claims and then ruled there was no\n\nevidence without even reading the evidence attached to the Opposition to\n\nthe Motion The trial court’s failure to follow accepted process for producing\n\nproprietary evidence and its failure to read the evidence attached to the\n\nopposition to the motion before granting a No Evidence Motion was an\n\narbitrary abuse of discretion and caused reversible error.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 11\n\f     Appellant provided enough evidence in opposition to Appellee’s No\n\nEvidence Motion for Summary Judgment to require that it be denied. A\n\ncanvass of an election can be overturned if the court cannot ascertain the\n\ntrue outcome of the election because of illegal conduct, inaccuracies or\n\nmistakes. It can also be overturned if illegal votes were counted. In this\n\ncase there was evidence of many irregularities that if taken as true could\n\nlead a court to validly exercise its discretion to determine it cannot\n\nascertain the true outcome of the election.\n\n     The Election Code requires that images of the ballots be preserved\n\nand counted in a manual recount. It is undisputed that images of the ballots\n\nvoters see when deciding who to vote for were not maintained or available\n\nfor the recount. Despite evidence presented in opposition to the No\n\nEvidence Motion for Summary Judgment showing that a CVR did not have\n\nany of the items on it that the Election Code required a ballot to have, the\n\ncourt erroneously granted a no evidence summary judgment. The mail-in\n\nballots were tied and therefore a new election was required to be called.\n\nThe county clerk elected to conduct this election either using an electronic\n\nvoting system that did not comply with the Election Code or the system did\n\ncomply with the Election Code and she neglected to preserve images of the\n\nballots as required by law. The fact that there no images of the ballots kept\n\n\n                                   Page 12\n\frequires the calling of a new election keeping images of ballots either by\n\ngetting the system that can do so or by programing the current system to\n\nkeep the images of the ballots it formats for voters to decide who to vote for\n\nwhen they make that decision.\n\n      Finally, the trial court ordered sanctions under of the Texas Civil\n\nPractices & Remedies Code § 10.001, et. seq. There was no evidence that\n\nany fact pled both had “…no evidentiary support or, for a specifically\n\nidentified allegation or factual contention, was not likely to have evidentiary\n\nsupport after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery”\n\nTexas Civil Practices & Remedies Code § 10.001(3). App.10.\n\n      Because Pressley supplied the trial court with more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence that would in itself justify voiding the election and because the\n\nevidence in support of thereof was true and the cause of actions asserted\n\nwere recognized in law or in a good faith extension thereof, this Court\n\nshould reverse the trial court judgment rendering judgment that the\n\nsanctions were not warranted and remand this case for trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 13\n\f                               ARGUMENT\n\nIssue 1.

While relying on all of the evidence\n\nattached to the Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, 1 CR\n\n2043 the following appears to be sufficient in itself:\n\n       1.   The affidavit of Contestant’s computer science expert that a\n\nCVR is not a ballot image and that some federal reports and other studies\n\nrequire the image of the ballot in addition to a CVR be maintained as a\n\ncheck on the computer. 1 CR 2087, 2088.\n\n\n\n                                     Page 21\n\f      2.    The clerk’s testimony that her office did not maintain images of\n\nthe ballot presented to voters by the computerized voting system when they\n\ndecide who to vote for 1 CR 1925, line 22 to 1928, line 24; 2 CR 2058 and\n\nthe exhibits showing the appearance of that ballot and the CVR 1 CR 1982,\n\nLines 19 -21; 2 CR 2058 which was the only item stored and relied on to\n\ncount votes 1 CR 1984, lines 9 -11. It is clear from this evidence and that\n\nof the Appellant’s expert 1 CR 2087 and 2088 that a CVR is not an official\n\nballot and does not contain the legal components required of a Texas ballot\n\n(1 CR 899 ¶ 146). Because \"ballot image storage\" was not used by Travis\n\nCounty, as the statute requires, the required ballot images from the run-off\n\nelection are missing election records and there are no official ballots that\n\ncan be counted other than the Absentee/Mail in Ballots which resulted in a\n\ntie (2 CR 3074 column BBM). Failing to print and produce the legally\n\nrequired \"images of ballots cast\" for the election recount is a violation of\n\nTexas Election Code § 213.016, App.20, by itself. Therefore, the only true\n\noutcome that can be ascertained is a tie which requires a new election. (2\n\nCR 3074, column “BBM” 1 CR 1938, line 23 to 1939, line 4).\n\n     \"’Election records’ also include ballot boxes (containing voted ballots),\n\ntally sheets, absentee ballots, Results/Tally tapes, and items like them, also\n\nconstitute \"precinct election records,\" as defined and used in chapter 66 of\n\n\n                                    Page 22\n\fthe code.

Therefore, Hart\n\n           does have a program that is apparently capable of combining a\n\n           flash card with a ballot image onto an MBB which can plugged\n\n           into the Tally system (1 CR 2656).\n\nTexas Election Code § 52.001 App.13 is clear that “the vote in an election\n\nis by official ballot” and Texas Election Code § 2.001 App.11 states, “…to\n\nbe elected to a public office, a candidate must receive more votes than any\n\nother candidate for office.” Since the legally required “images of ballots\n\ncast” (Texas Election Code § 128.001 App.19 and § 213.016 App.20) are\n\nmissing, the election should have been recanvassed with the only legal and\n\nofficial ballots, the mail in ballots, (1 CR 4667, ¶¶ 186 – 187) and the\n\nrecount should have been recanvassed as an exact tie. CVRs are not\n\nmentioned in any part of the Texas Constitution or the Texas Election Code\n\nand are not official ballots. If there are missing election records that are\n\nmaterial in determining the true outcome of the election, the Court is\n\nauthorized to void the election.   Guerra v. Avila, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403\n\n(Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1980, no writ).       If the Clerk counts illegal\n\nvotes, those votes are cancelled under Texas Election Code § 221.003 (1)\n\nand (3) App.22. This leaves the election tied because the only images of\n\nballots the computerized voting system kept were the eScan program’s\n\n\n                                   Page 25\n\fmail-in ballots and those resulted in a tie, authorizing the ordering of a new\n\nelection as requested by Appellant. 2 CR 3074, Column “BBM”; 1 CR\n\n1938, line 23 to 1939, line 4.\n\n      Ballots are defined in Texas Election Code, Chapter 52, Subchapter\n\nC.   For the purposes of this suit, the most salient portions of that\n\nsubchapter are Sec. 52.003 App.14 and Sec. 52.070 App.31.\n\nIt is clear from these provisions that the Legislature did not permit this\n\nelection to be decided by counting or recounting CVRs which do not\n\nresemble or contain the components of an official ballot in any respect. See\n\nalso Texas Election Code § 214.049 (e).\n\n       Note that the Travis County CVR 1 CR 2994; 2 CR 613. does not\n\ncontain:\n\n           a. a unique serial/ticket number (Texas Constitution, Article 6,\n              Section 4, App.9 and Texas Election Code § 52.062, App.15.)\n\n           b. the election name and candidate (Texas Election Code §\n              52.063), of Joint Special Runoff Election, Travis County,\n              App.16; 52.031. App. 17.\n\n           c. the election date (Texas Election Code § 52.063), of December\n              16, 2014\n\n           d. the designation of Official Ballot (Texas Election Code §\n              52.064), App.33.\n\n           e. a voting square to the left of each candidate’s name (Texas\n              Election Code § 52.070), App.32, and\n\n\n                                    Page 26\n\f        f. voting instructions (Texas Election Code § 52.070). App.32.\n\n     The CVR does not meet the Constitution’s minimum requirement that\n\nan election be conducted by a numbered ballot since the CVR is not\n\nnumbered. Texas Constitution, Article VI, Section 4 App.9. Therefore, any\n\ndecision by a state official like the Secretary of State or the Travis County\n\nClerk that allowed the true outcome of an election to be decided by\n\nsomething other than a numbered official ballot would be unconstitutional.\n\nIndeed, the Clerk confessed that a ballot image and a CVR are not the\n\nsame thing 2 Suppl. RR 189, lines 2 - 9.\n\n     Thus, Appellant’s evidence attached to her Opposition to Contestee’s\n\nNo Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment showing that a CVR is not a\n\nballot and the outcome of this election was not determined by counting\n\nballots or images of ballots which were not preserved and therefore missing\n\ncreates more than a scintilla of evidence that the true outcome of this\n\nelection cannot be determined. The trial court could not grant this motion by\n\nrelying on any contrary evidence that Appellee attached to a Motion for\n\nTraditional Summary Judgment which was not granted and is not involved\n\nin this appeal. 1 CR 4605; 2 C.R. 2060.\n\n     The CVR has been around a long time. If the Legislature wanted to\n\nmake it permissible to determine the true outcome of an election by\n\n\n                                   Page 27\n\fcounting CVRs instead of ballots as it has defined them it could have done\n\nso (subject to the Constitution’s mandatory requirement that elections be by\n\nnumbered ballots).\n\n     The question in this case is whether absent specific statutory\n\nauthority this court will allow our elected officials to be determined by a\n\ncomputer data tally only of what the voter’s ballot says without the backup\n\nof an actual ballot or an image of one. In this day and age with computer\n\ncrashes, errors and hacks, the wisdom of our Legislature in requiring the\n\nsystem to maintain images of the actual ballots is clearly good public policy\n\nand should be presumed to be its intention.\n\n     Appellees have asserted that the issues raised in this case have\n\nbeen decided in Andrade v. NAACP of Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895342\"><a href=\"/opinion/895342/andrade-v-naacp-of-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011).\n\nThat case has nothing to do with issues raised in this case. Andrade,\n\nsupra, dealt solely with standing and equal protection. The issue in that\n\ncase was whether the voters who alleged that they were denied equal\n\nprotection of laws under the constitution because they were required to use\n\nthe Hart electronic voting system and other voters in statewide elections\n\nwere not required to do so. The Court first held these voters had standing\n\nto raise the equal protection claims and then held there was no violation of\n\nequal protection by use of different voting systems in different counties in a\n\n\n                                   Page 28\n\fstatewide election.   The Court then held that the voters did not have\n\nstanding to attack the lack of ballot verification and therefore never reached\n\nthe merits of anything like the issues involved in this case. Here there is no\n\nchallenge to Appellant’s standing. Andrade, supra, is very instructive in its\n\ndescription of how the Hart system worked when an election is held:\n\n“Voters arriving at the polls in counties using the eSlate are given a unique\n\naccess code. The voter enters the code into the eSlate, which then displays\n\nthe ballot. Voters turn a dial to highlight their ballot choice and then press\n\n\"enter\" to make a selection. After a voter completes his selections, the\n\neSlate displays a ballot summary page. If the voter's choices are correctly\n\ndisplayed, the voter presses the \"cast ballot\" button, and the vote is\n\nrecorded. See Voter Instructions, TRAVIS COUNTY, purchased the eSlate\n\nsystem in 2001 and has used it since 2003.” Id. at 5. (emphasis added)\n\nThe critical aspects of this description for this appeal are the Supreme\n\nCourt’s acknowledgement that the system used by Travis County “displays\n\nthe ballot” (emphasis added). This is the only relevant part of Andrade,\n\nsupra and actually makes Appellant’s point that this ballot is not printed and\n\nnot preserved even though it is formatted 1 CR 1927, lines 13 -18 and 1\n\nCR 1805 for every voter to see by the Hart voting system. As a result, the\n\nevidence eSlate formats a ballot raises at least a fact issue as to whether\n\n\n                                    Page 29\n\fthe Secretary of State had authority under the Texas Election Code §\n\n52.075 App.37 to imply in its instructions and definitions that a CVR is\n\nsynonymous with an image of a ballot as defined in the Election Code.\n\n     The other case Appellee has relied on is Texas Democratic Party v.\n\nWilliams, No. A-07-CA-115-SS (W.D. Tex. August 16, 2007). In that case,\n\nvoters complained that the eSlate deprived them of the ability to \"emphasis\n\nvote\"; that is, to cast a straight party vote and then also again vote for a\n\nparticular candidate within that party—to make sure their votes count for\n\nthese particular candidates. The voters argued that, if they attempted to\n\nemphasis vote, the eSlate would de-select, rather than register a vote for,\n\nthe individual candidate. The trial court held that even assuming that the\n\neSlate impacted voters' ability to cast emphasis votes, the use of DREs\n\nwas constitutionally permissible. Therefore, neither case dealt with either\n\nof the issues involved in this case (does a CVR satisfy the election code\n\nrequirement to maintain an image of a ballot and can several irregularities\n\nand mistakes in the conduct of an election permit a court to void the\n\nelection by making it impossible to ascertain the true outcome?).\n\n     The trial court conceded that if a CVR is not an image of a ballot then\n\nAppellant would be entitled to a new election, 4 RR 60, line 13 to 62, line\n\n20, then erroneously granted a no evidence summary judgment that\n\n\n                                   Page 30\n\fAppellant did not produce more than a scintilla of evidence that a CVR is\n\nnot an image of a ballot.\n\n    2.

The missing\n\nimages of items that met the statutory definition of a ballot and satisfied the\n\nTexas Constitution’s minimum requirements of what must be on a ballot\n\nthat is counted to determine the outcome of an election was more than\n\nenough to void the election and appellant provided ample proof of this to\n\navoid summary judgment.\n\n      In addition, Appellant produced evidence that there were numerous\n\nInvalid/Corrupt MBBs,1 CR 2086 - 2087, 1 CR 2118, 2135, 2136, 2139,\n\n2140, 2142, 2155 and 2 CR 1880, 1897, 1898, 1901, 1902, 1904, 1917; 1\n\nCR 2056 paragraph 41 through 2059 paragraph 48; that there were more\n\nInvalid/Corrupt MBBs than the County Clerk had seen in all her years of\n\nconducting elections (MBBs contain the CVRs from a voting machine) 1 CR\n\n1978 lines 9-20; that the “reader” tallying the votes was broken 1 CR 1979\n\nline 4-5; that seals were broken bringing the security and accuracy of the\n\nMBBs into question 1 CR 917, 922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 929, 930; that\n\nthe computer that tallies the CVRs was left open on several occasions and\n\nfor extended period of time that the County Clerk did not believe the tally\n\nlog which recorded the MBBs and all of the other events in the election in\n\norder to verify the results were reliable 1 CR 1995 lines 7-13; that the\n\nCounty Clerk ordered her employees not to print zero tapes and result\n\n\n                                    Page 33\n\ftapes on the day of the run–off election as required by the Secretary of\n\nState 1 CR 1865 and Appellant was told the same by Mr. Winn, the Clerk’s\n\nDirector of Elections 1 CR 872 paragraph 42; 874, paragraph 48; that\n\nimages of the ballots cast were missing; 1 CR 1982 lines 19-21; that a\n\nstatistical analysis of the reported results of the run-off election indicated\n\nthat the results were not believable and that the county clerk’s employees\n\nrefused to allow the poll watchers to witness the whole process of the\n\nprinting of the CVRs from the tally computer 1 CR 886 paragraph 93..\n\n     Specifically, Appellant and her official Recount Watchers were not\n\nallowed to monitor the integrity of where the CVRs were retrieved, the\n\nsource where the retrieval occurred, or the copying of the CVR files to an\n\naggregated pdf file. 1 CR 886, ¶ 93.

Therefore,\n\nthe Court erred in granting Appellee’s no evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment and this court should reverse the judgment below and remand it\n\nfor trial.\n\n       The court in Alvarez, supra said it best:\n\n       “But perceptions of fairness are also important. The public\n       must have confidence that the election process is fair for all\n       candidates. It is therefore imperative that election officials\n       comply with code procedures.

Cases\n       may arise in which official disregard of the election laws is so\n       pervasive that the courts could not let the election stand, even\n       though the contestant might not be able to prove that the\n       violations caused an incorrect outcome.” Alvarez v.

Foust, supra, at page\n\n3. App.29. In Foust the Court overturned a sanctions order based on the\n\nfailure to produce evidence of causation at trial when there was no\n\nevidence of improper motive at the time the allegation was made.\n\n     Indeed, Appellant went through the unusual effort of attaching almost\n\nall of the evidence upon which the factual allegations of mistakes and\n\nirregularities in the election were based to each version of the Contest and\n\n\n\n                                   Page 44\n\fdid several statistical analyses before filing this Contest.

It is called a Zero Tape since all contests or propositions\n\nshould have zero votes next to each name or question.” (2 CR 712; 2\n\nSuppl. RR 78, line 9 to 79, line 13). Also, according to the Texas Secretary\n\nof State’s Election Advisory No. 2012-03(6)(g)(vi), 2 CR 707 and 726\n\nrelated to Zero Tapes:\n\n       “Opening the Polls:\n\n           1. At a minimum print one zero tape from each\n     applicable device, as follows: The presiding judge, an\n     election clerk, and not more than two watchers, if one or\n     more watchers are present, shall sign the zero tape. 2.\n     Maintain zero tapes in a secure location to be returned\n     with election materials (i.e. Ballot Box #4 or other secure\n     means designated by the general custodian of election\n     records).” (emphasis added)(Exhibit J, p. 8 (2 CR 707))\n\n      In Contestee’s Third Amended Motion for Sanctions, it is claimed\n\nthat Appellant actually produced a zero tape as an Exhibit.

It does not contain the following\n\ninformation required by the Texas Secretary of State for Zero Tapes (2 CR\n\n710):\n\n        “All contests should have zero votes next to each name” In fact,\n        Contestant and Contestee’s District 4 is not listed on the partial tape\n        and neither Pressley nor Casar is listed with zero votes next to their\n        respective names,\n\n        “Zero Tape is printed when voting machine is first set up at polls” 1\n        CR 710. In fact, the partial tape Travis County produced was not\n        printed when the voting machines were set up at the polls during\n        Early Voting (December 1) or during Election Day (December 16).\n        The partial tape was printed on November 26th, a week prior to Early\n        Voting,\n\n         “The presiding judge…shall sign the Zero Tape” 1 CR 703, item vi.1.\n\n The partial tape produced by Travis County and attached to Appellant’s\n\n pleading was not signed by an election judge. (1 CR 1875) See larger\n\n version App.36; Election Code § 66.051-.054. App. 18\n\n         Travis County Clerk testified at the Sanctions Hearing on June 18,\n\n 2015 that tapes were not printed on Election Day. 2 Suppl. RR 224, lines\n\n 3-8. She also testified that a letter exempting her from printing Zero tapes\n\n for the general election (2 CR 7618-7619) applied to the run-off even\n\n though she did not have a similar letter referring to the run-off. 2 Suppl.\n\n\n                                     Page 47\n\fRR 183 lines 5 - 16 which implies that the Clerk did not print zero tapes on\n\nthe day of the election. As noted in the Sixth Amended Petition, P. 13 ¶\n\n42 (1 CR 872 ¶ 42), Appellant communicated with the Travis County\n\nElections Division Director and was told no Zero Tapes would be printed\n\nfor the run-off. In addition the testimony at the sanctions hearing made\n\nclear that Appellant had a lot of evidentiary support for her allegations that\n\nZero tapes were not printed on the day of the election. 2 RR 48 to 50, line\n\n5.\n\n     6.   The allegation that voters were disenfranchised because their\n\nvoting location was changed from the locations at which they voted in the\n\ngeneral election was likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable\n\nopportunity for further investigation and discovery given the statistical\n\nevidence indicating voters who always vote in run-offs did not vote in this\n\none and numerous complaints to Pressley’s phone bank and the likelihood\n\nthat voters would be willing to testify about their disenfranchisement. 2\n\nSuppl. RR 88, line 6 to 96, line 10, line 20. When it became clear that the\n\nvoters who the statistical study indicated did not vote because of a change\n\nin voting locations would not be willing to testify and other expected\n\nreasonably likely evidentiary support would not materialize, Pressley\n\ndropped that claim from her final pleading since it turned out to be a\n\n\n                                   Page 48\n\f“hairball”. 2 Suppl.

Dawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1497611\"><a href=\"/opinion/1497611/rm-dudley-const-co-inc-v-dawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708\n\n\n                                   Page 49\n\f(Tex. App.—Waco 2008, pet denied).           Since Appellant clearly had an\n\nevidentiary basis for making the allegation or reasonably expected she\n\nwould obtain witness statements or proof there were no signs posted\n\nredirecting voters from their original vote locations, the presumption of good\n\nfaith was not overcome.      Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to\n\nsanction Appellant for making this allegation.\n\n     7.   Appellee’s counsel, in an effort to prejudice the trial court,\n\ncontinuously accused Pressley and Rogers of directly accusing Dana\n\nDeBeauvoir and Michael Winn of criminal conduct. 3 Suppl. RR 25, line 21\n\nto 26, line 4. The pleadings do not directly accuse any particular election\n\nofficial of committing a crime. 1 CR 877, ¶¶ 60 - 62 and 886, ¶ 93 to 887, ¶\n\n96. The allegations of interference with poll watchers was supported by\n\naffidavit (2 CR 7620) and was only included because illegal conduct is one\n\nof the grounds a court looks at in deciding to overturn an election.\n\nNowhere in these allegations is Dana DeBeauvoir even mentioned, and all\n\nthat Mr. Winn is directly accused of doing is not answering phone calls.\n\nIndeed, there is no direct allegation that either had any personal\n\ninvolvement in the illegal activities. 1 CR 875-878. Therefore, sanctions\n\nbased on the totally erroneous proposition that Appellant had no evidence\n\nor legal basis to accuse Dana DeBeauvoir and Michael Winn of criminal\n\n\n                                   Page 50\n\fconduct is arbitrary and capricious. To the extent there may have been\n\nsome innuendo (which is denied) that the actions regarding the obstructing\n\nthe poll watchers from viewing of printing of the CVRs, the pleading merely\n\nmakes true allegations supported by affidavit and cites election code\n\nprovisions and criminal statutes that arguably could apply to those facts.\n\nThey certainly can be said to reasonably argue for an extension or\n\ninterpretation of legal principals. The trial court and the Appellee never\n\npointed out any cases holding that Rogers’ application of the factual\n\naffidavits to the criminal code was erroneous. Put another way, there are\n\nno cases that hold that it is not a violation of the cited as criminal provision\n\nto commit the acts verified by the affidavits as having been committed.\n\n      Since there was some evidentiary support or such was reasonably\n\nlikely to be obtained for each of the sanctioned allegations, the Court\n\nabused its discretion by sanctioning Pressley for making them.\n\n      In summary, Appellant conducted her own reasonable inquiry before\n\nfiling the lawsuit.   She looked at the Texas Constitution, Article VI and\n\nElection Code provisions defining an official ballot (Chapter 52) and\n\nrequiring a computerized voting system to maintain images of them and\n\ncompared that to the information appearing on the CVRs obtained at the\n\nrecount (2 CR 5116). She looked into reports from other states about the\n\n\n                                    Page 51\n\fneed for maintaining a cross check on the CVR consisting of the ballot that\n\nvoters looked at when deciding who to vote for (2 CR 7515). She did a\n\nstatistical analysis which indicated many voters did not vote in the run-off\n\nwhose voting location was changed when they have always voted in run-\n\noffs in the past, and had reports from voters who refused to go to the\n\nconsolidated location (2 CR 1580-1614), She was told by the Director of\n\nElections that zero tapes and result tapes would not be printed on the day\n\nof the election (1 CR 872, ¶ 42) and obtained affidavits for poll watchers\n\nthat were told the same thing (2 CR 7620). She saw instructions from the\n\nClerk instructing election personnel not to print result tapes (1 CR 1865).\n\nShe had information from her poll watchers stating they were denied\n\naccess to certain parts of the process of printing the CVRs for the run-off\n\nand was present when it occurred (1 CR 886, ¶ 93).          The trial court’s\n\nholding that she did not make a reasonable inquiry is an abuse of discretion\n\ngiven the entire record in this case some of which is cited above. For the\n\nsame reason, the trial court’s holding that there was no evidentiary basis\n\nfor these allegations and it was not reasonably likely discovery would\n\nproduce any evidence was likewise arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.\n\nSince Appellant did not engage in any conduct for which the court had the\n\nauthority to impose sanctions, it committed reversible error in doing so.\n\n\n                                   Page 52\n\f      As the Texas Supreme Court noted in Low, supra at 621:              “We\n\nrecognize that in some cases, a party may not have evidence that proves\n\neach specific factual allegation at the time a lawsuit is filed. Certainly, the\n\nlaw does not require proof of a case without reasonable time for discovery.”\n\nAll of the allegations made in the first 5 contests had evidentiary support by\n\nthe time discovery was over and the 6th amended contest was filed. This is\n\nnot like Low when an examination of medical records showed undisputable\n\nevidence that the allegations made and sanctioned were untrue.\n\n    Sub Issue 3.

Henry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894843\"><a href=\"/opinion/894843/low-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 f/n 5 (Tex. 2007). However, the trial court misapplied the Low\n\nfactors to the actual evidence in this case. It followed lock step with the\n\nunusual testimony of Appellee’s attorney (unusual because he was clearly\n\ntestifying to contested facts that were really his argument for sanctions and\n\nnot evidence) even though he was not designated as an expert on\n\nsanctions over Appellant’s counsel’s objection. It is clear that this Court did\n\nnot consider Mr. Herring’s testimony on the Low factors and this Court\n\nshould not either. 3 Suppl. RR 48, line 16 to 49, line 2.\n\n      By imposing sanctions in disregard of the basis for the considerations\n\nit was required by the Supreme Court in Low, supra to look at the trial court\n\nabused its discretion. Therefore, even if the Court could enter the sanctions\n\norder and even if sanctionable conduct had occurred, the factor’s in Low\n\nrequired the court not to impose monetary sanctions and certainly not in the\n\namounts it ordered.\n\n      2.    The Low Factor\n\n      The first Low factor, the good faith or bad faith of the offender, weighs\n\nagainst awarding sanctions for alleging that certain actions of the Clerk’s\n\n\n                                    Page 54\n\foffice violated a criminal sanction in the Election Code under this factor.\n\nThe trial court found Appellant is only responsible under this factor for the\n\nfactual allegation that the clerk’s employees did not let them see the entire\n\nprocess of printing the ballots. There is absolutely no evidence that this\n\nfactual allegation was without evidentiary support. There is a presumption\n\nthat the allegations and the pleadings were made in good faith. There was\n\nno evidence at the sanctions hearing or elsewhere that even tended to\n\novercome this presumption. The complaint the trial court points to is about\n\ncharacterizing the interference truthfully alleged as having occurred as a\n\ncriminal violation. Doing so was purely a legal conclusion drawn by Mr.\n\nRogers from the true facts reported and alleged by Appellant. There is no\n\nevidence either Appellant or Rogers acted in bad faith. Indeed, Appellant’s\n\nfactual and legal positions in this case were made in good faith.        The\n\nallegations that there was some interference with Poll Watcher’s request to\n\nview the entire process involved in printing the CVRs for the recount was\n\ntrue and there was no evidence they were fake.            Most importantly,\n\nContestant and her official Recount Watchers were not allowed to monitor\n\nthe integrity of where the CVRs were retrieved (1 CR 1803) the source\n\nwhere the retrieval occurred, or the copying of the CVR files to an\n\naggregated pdf file. (1 CR 886 ¶¶ 93-96). The Election Code makes it\n\n\n                                   Page 55\n\fillegal to knowingly prevent a watcher from observing an activity the\n\nwatcher is entitled to observe Election Code Section 33.061, App.34.\n\nTherefore, there was interference with poll watchers’ activities and arguably\n\nthis was a criminal violation of the Election Code.\n\n      It was Appellee’s contention that the law does not empower poll\n\nwatchers to observe anything except the printer’s regurgitation of CVRs.\n\nThe law is not clear on this point and it certainly was not sanctionable to\n\nallege the restrictions that actually did occur violated the law. Sanctions\n\nbased on the first Low factor were an abuse of discretion.\n\n      The second Low factor weighs against imposing sanctions against\n\nAppellant. There was no evidence Appellant or Rogers acted willfully or\n\nnegligently with vindictiveness in asserting that the clerk failed to print zero\n\ntapes on the day of the election since Michael Winn reported the same to\n\nPressley and the Clerk had admitted she did not in her testimony. There is\n\nno evidence Appellant or Rogers acted willfully or negligently with\n\nvindictiveness in asserting or in relying on a statistical analysis and reports\n\nfrom irate potential voters in alleging what Pressley reasonably believed\n\nwould develop convincing evidence that voters were disenfranchised by\n\nchange in voting locations and when the discovery evidence did not\n\ndevelop as she hoped dropping that allegation. While she did allege true\n\n\n                                    Page 56\n\foccurrences, supported by third party affidavits that illegal activity did occur\n\n2 CR 7620, 7333; a factor in determining whether the true outcome could\n\nbe ascertained, she did not directly accuse any particular person\n\nresponsible for that activity”. (See earlier discussion not repeated here.)\n\n      Appellant conducted her own reasonable inquiry which evidences this\n\ncase was filed in good faith and not out of the kind of ill will or bad motive\n\nwhich is the inquiry in the second Low factor. Since Appellant did not\n\nengage in any conduct for which the court had the authority to impose\n\nsanctions, it committed reversible error in doing so.\n\n      The third Low factor, the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the\n\noffender, may weigh slightly but insignificantly in favor of awarding\n\nsanctions against Rogers. Rogers is an experienced attorney who has\n\nhandled election contests previously and holds himself out as being\n\nknowledgeable regarding election contests. This knowledge supports his\n\nuse of the true facts alleged showing no images of ballots and numerous\n\nirregularities and mistakes could legally permit a court to exercise\n\ndiscretion to hold that the true outcome of the election could not be\n\nascertained. In any event Roger’s knowledge experience and expertise\n\ncannot justify sanctions against Pressley who justifiably relied on the ability\n\nof her lawyer.   Although Pressley has a PhD in Chemistry, a business\n\n\n                                    Page 57\n\fowner and is actively involved in her community, and has appeared before\n\nAustin City Council at least thirty times. She was personally involved in\n\nproposing drafts to her attorney for portions of the Contests and discovery.\n\nThis does not mean that Pressley had the knowledge, expertise and\n\nexperience in election law and contests that would make any of her actions\n\nin this case sanctionable. The focus of this factor is clearly did the\n\nsanctioned person know the conduct was sanctionable? Clearly Pressley’s\n\nresume does not fit into this factor. At best, it shows that she is not stupid\n\nand is active in her community. Chemists and business owners who are\n\nactive in their community should not be more likely to be sanctioned for\n\nthose reasons. Indeed her PhD in Chemistry weighs against sanction of\n\nany kind because it gives credibility to the statistical analysis she did as\n\npart of her reasonable inquiry before hiring Rogers to file this case since a\n\nchemistry doctorate clearly requires intimate knowledge of statistics.\n\n      The fourth Low factor, any prior history of sanctionable conduct on\n\nthe part of the offender weighs against the imposition of sanctions. There\n\nis no evidence of such a prior history.\n\n      The fifth Low factor, the reasonableness and necessity of the out-of-\n\npocket expenses incurred by the offended person as a result of the\n\nmisconduct weighs against the imposition of sanctions because Appellee\n\n\n                                    Page 58\n\fhas not paid any attorney’s fees and will not be sued for them. 3 Suppl. RR\n\n79, line 6 through 80, line 6. Appellee is not out of pocket for attorney’s\n\nfees and will never be required to pay any attorney’s fees. 3 Suppl. RR 79,\n\nline 6 through 80, line 6. There was no evidence at the sanctions hearing\n\nof the reasonableness of Appellee’s out of pocket expenses or that they\n\nwere incurred as the result of any particular misconduct by Appellant or\n\nRogers.\n\n      The sixth Low factor, the nature and extent of prejudice, apart from\n\nout-of-pocket expenses weighs against the imposition of sanctions. There\n\nwas no evidence of this at the hearing. The only relevant evidence was\n\nthat he was never accused of any personal misconduct so he could not\n\nhave been prejudiced.\n\n      The seventh Low factor, the relative culpability of client and counsel,\n\nis relevant as to which person to assess how much of the sanctions if\n\nsanctions were appropriate, the evidence of Appellant proving assistance\n\nto her attorney has little if any significance since many clients assist their\n\nattorneys for various reasons including their better familiarity with the facts\n\nand a hope of saving money. Her involvement was not much more than\n\nany client of providing information of the facts to the attorney and being\n\nsure they were accurately represented in the pleadings. (2 Suppl. RR 42\n\n\n                                    Page 59\n\fline 23 to 43, line 25). These normal activities by Appellant should not\n\nweigh in favor of sanctions in the Low analysis of sanction imposition.\n\nThere was no evidence of any action by Appellant contributed to the\n\npleading found by the trial court to be sanctionable (zero tapes, voting\n\nlocations or refusing to allow poll watchers and the candidate to see\n\nvarious aspects of the printing of the CVRs).        Indeed all of Appellant’s\n\nfactual allegations were true and had some evidentiary support as outlined\n\nand attached to the various Contest pleadings and as testified to at the\n\nsanctions hearing.\n\n      The eighth Low factor, the risk of chilling the specific type of litigation\n\ninvolved, also weighs heavily against awarding sanctions.           This factor\n\nweighs against awarding sanctions of $90,000.00 for filing an election\n\ncontest 44.44% of which are assessed against the Candidate because\n\ndoing so will obviously have a chilling effect on any decision by another\n\ncandidate to exercise their statutory right to file an election contest for fear\n\nthat a court who holds they failed to prove their case by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence at trial or in response to a Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment will impose crippling sanctions on them. The consequences of\n\nchilling a candidate from even attempting to prove the wrong candidate is\n\nguiding our public policy is so consequential that the huge monetary\n\n\n                                     Page 60\n\fsanctions awarded in this case would allow a person to serve as an elected\n\nofficial no matter how many election laws were violated and no matter how\n\nmany mistakes and irregularities occurred.        The trial court’s award is\n\ndesigned to prevent a litigant from making true allegations that a court\n\neventually decides do not persuade the court to call for a new election\n\nwithout incurring huge sanctions should the court rule against the\n\ncandidate. What lawyer will ever take an election contest case if he will\n\nexpose himself and his firm to $50,000 in sanctions? This case, if it stands,\n\nwill ring the death knoll of the right to contest elections provided by our\n\nLegislature. This factor is designed to be sure sanctions will not have the\n\neffect of discouraging citizens from exercising their constitutional, statutory\n\nor common law rights of access to courts. The trial court’s action has the\n\nprecise effect sought to be prevented by proper consideration of this factor.\n\n      The ninth Low factor, the impact of the sanction on the offender,\n\nincluding the offender’s ability to pay a monetary sanction, also weighs\n\nagainst awarding sanctions. Appellant has very few assets that can be\n\nused to pay sanctions and Appellee offered no evidence of the extent to\n\nwhich she needs her assets to pay normal living expenses. This Court can\n\nsee that what she has and her husband earns is needed to start a business\n\n(the LLC assets), and to live on. There is no evidence she still has any of\n\n\n                                    Page 61\n\fthe $40,000 she raised to pay expenses in this case.        The undisputed\n\nevidence is that her costs have greatly exceeded that amount already. 2\n\nSuppl. 68, line 20 through 70, line 16. The $170,000 that belongs to an\n\nindependent entity is not hers and could not be subject to seizure to pay\n\nthe sanctions. 2 Suppl. RR 67, line 23 – 68, line 13. Here there is no\n\nevidence that she has any of the profit from the sale of her home or how\n\nmuch of the sales price was profit. 2 Suppl. RR 63, line 14 through 64, line\n\n14. She is no longer making a salary. 2 Suppl. RR 70, lines 11 - 14. Her\n\nhusband’s earning capacity is not an asset that can be currently liquidated\n\nto pay sanctions and does make her more able to pay monetary sanctions.\n\nShe has basically has $1,000 in assets, $6,000 counting her husband’s\n\nassets. (2 Suppl. RR 65, line 12 to 66, line 19) The $40,000 award is\n\ngreatly in access of the assets she has available to pay the sanctions.\n\nAppellee did not identify or prove Appellant’s existing liabilities and\n\ntherefore, a full accounting of her net assets could not be assessed by the\n\nCourt. Appellee accepted the burden of proving liabilities to show net worth\n\n(2 Suppl. RR 61, lines 7-11) and never did it. (2 Suppl. RR 61 line 1 to 62,\n\nline 19). The focus of this Low factor is to be sure the trial court does not\n\nimpose sanctions in an amount absent proof there are current assets of the\n\nperson being sanctioned to pay them without bankrupting her. The court\n\n\n                                   Page 62\n\fdid not have enough evidence to ascertain whether or not it was complying\n\nwith this Low factor before imposing the sanctions imposed in this case.\n\n      The tenth Low factor, the impact of the sanction on the offended\n\nparty, including the offended person’s need for compensation, also weighs\n\nagainst awarding sanctions. There is no evidence of Appellee’s need for\n\ncompensation nor that the sanction would have a positive impact on him.\n\nSince it has been made clear that he is not accused of any wrongdoing, he\n\ndoes not to point to an award of sanctions as evidence of vindication.\n\n      The eleventh Low factor, the relative magnitude of sanction\n\nnecessary to achieve the goal or goals of the sanction, also weighs against\n\nawarding sanctions. The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section\n\n10.004 states that the sanction must be limited to what is sufficient to deter\n\nrepetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly\n\nsituated. There cannot be any more challenges before the court of appeals\n\nrules so either there will be no more suits because the CVR only practice\n\nviolates the election code or everyone will know this is not a winnable\n\nargument and will not go through the unnecessary expense of litigation.\n\nFurthermore, an award of sanctions of $90,000 is manifestly greater than is\n\nnecessary to deter the conduct in this case while not chilling future election\n\ncontest proceedings. The award of sanctions calculated by attorney’s fees\n\n\n                                    Page 63\n\frequires that there was no reasonable inquiry made. As discussed above,\n\nPressley made a reasonable inquiry into the truth of her allegations and\n\nRogers asserted causes of action based on those facts described by the\n\nelection code and several cases holding that mistakes, illegal conduct and\n\nirregularities alone could be relied on by a trial court in calling for a new\n\nelection without abusing its discretion. In addition, the amount of sanctions\n\nwas manifestly excessive since this case involved responses to written\n\ndiscovery (erroneously cut off by the court) and two depositions followed by\n\nthe granting of summary judgement. It was not a jury trial or even a trial\n\nbefore the Court. As described above, the magnitude of the sanctions in\n\nthis case will chill future candidates from exercising their statutory,\n\nconstitutional and common law rights and lawyers from representing them\n\nand clearly not warranted by the actions found by the Court to be\n\nsanctionable.\n\n     The twelfth Low factor, burdens on the court system attributable to\n\nthe misconduct, weighs against awarding sanctions. There is no evidence\n\nthat this no evidence Summary Judgment burdened the Court system any\n\nmore than any other election contest.        The judge would have to be\n\nappointed and hear the case even if allegations of criminal conduct, voter\n\n\n\n\n                                   Page 64\n\fdisenfranchisement and failure to print CVRs on the day of the election\n\nwere not issues in this case.\n\n     The thirteenth Low factor, the degree to which the offended person’s\n\nown behavior caused the expenses for which recovery is sought, weighs\n\ninsignificantly against awarding sanctions. Appellant admits that Appellee\n\ndid nothing wrong in the conduct of the election and has never accused him\n\nof any misconduct.\n\n     A review of the Low factors that the Court was required to look to as\n\nguiding rules and principals in deciding whether to impose sanctions and if\n\nso how much shows the court abused its discretion in imposing the\n\nsanctions of $90,000 for a case at the point of granting a summary\n\njudgment ($40,000 against Pressley and $50,000 against her lawyer).\n\n    Sub Issue 4.

Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 45.\n\nWhile a trial court may award attorney’s fees for a losing appeal when the\n\nlaw allows it to award attorney’s fees, (there is no statutory authority for\n\nawarding attorney’s fees in an election contest) a trial court is not vested\n\nwith jurisdiction or discretion to award sanctions for appealing its decision.\n\nThe trial court in this case therefore abused its discretion in awarding\n\nsanctions measured by attorney’s fees on appeal without any evidence of\n\nthat amount or reasonableness thereof and contingent on what happens in\n\nthe future with respect to the disposition of an appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    Page 66\n\f                               CONCLUSION\n\n      The trial court committed reversible error by granting Appellee’s No\n\nEvidence Motion for Summary Judgment because there was more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence that the clerk counted CVRs instead of and without\n\nimages of ballots and that there were mistakes, irregularities, and other\n\nevidence that tended to prove that the true outcome of the election could\n\nnot be ascertained. Therefore, this Court should reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment and remand it to the trial court for trial.     The trial court also\n\ncommitted reversal error in awarding sanctions in the absence of evidence\n\nthat sanctionable conduct occurred and in violation of the Low factors and\n\nappellate sanctions measured by attorney’s fees without any evidence.\n\nTherefore, the sanctions order of the court should be reversed and\n\nrendered that Appellee take nothing by his request for sanctions.\n\n                                  PRAYER\n\n      Based on the record and the law cited herein, Appellant prays this\n\nhonorable Court to reverse the trial courts judgment granting Appellee a\n\nsummary judgment and to remand it with instructions to permit requested\n\ndiscovery of the ESlate manual, and the JBC and to examine the eSlate\n\nprogram and its functioning in tallying the votes in this election and conduct\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with the holding that CVRs do not satisfy the\n\n\n                                    Page 67\n\fstatutory requirement of maintaining a ballot image and that the trial court\n\nmay void the election if it believes in its discretion that irregularities and\n\nmistakes makes it impossible to ascertain the true outcome of the election\n\nwithout requiring appellant to identify particular votes that were affected.\n\nAppellant also asks the court to reverse and render that Appellee take\n\nnothing by its Motion for Sanctions.\n\n                                   Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                   /s/ Mark A.

A\n           person has knowledge of relevant facts when that person has or may have\n           knowledge of any discoverable matter. The person need not have admissible\n           information or personal knowledge of the facts. An expert is \"a person with\n           knowledge of relevant facts\" only if that knowledge was obtained first-hand or if it\n           was not obtained in preparation for trial or in anticipation of litigation.\n       o   (d) Trial Witnesses. --A party may obtain discovery of the name, address, and\n           telephone number of any person who is expected to be called to testify at trial. This\n           paragraph does not apply to rebuttal or impeaching witnesses the necessity of whose\n           testimony cannot reasonably be anticipated before trial.\n\f          Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n   193.4. Hearing and Ruling on Objections and Assertions of Privilege.\n       o (a) Hearing. --Any party may at any reasonable time request a\n          hearing on an objection or claim of privilege asserted under this rule.\n          The party making the objection or asserting the privilege must present\n          any evidence necessary to support the objection or privilege. The\n          evidence may be testimony presented at the hearing or affidavits\n          served at least seven days before the hearing or at such other\n          reasonable time as the court permits. If the court determines that an in\n          camera review of some or all of the requested discovery is necessary,\n          that material or information must be segregated and produced to the\n          court in a sealed wrapper within a reasonable time following the\n          hearing.\n       o (b) Ruling. --To the extent the court sustains the objection or claim\n          of privilege, the responding party has no further duty to respond to\n          that request. To the extent the court overrules the objection or claim of\n          privilege, the responding party must produce the requested material or\n          information within 30 days after the court's ruling or at such time as\n          the court orders. A party need not request a ruling on that party's own\n          objection or assertion of privilege to preserve the objection or\n          privilege.\n       o (c) Use of Material or Information Withheld Under Claim of\n          Privilege. --A party may not use - at any hearing or trial - material or\n          information withheld from discovery under a claim of privilege,\n          including a claim sustained by the court, without timely amending or\n          supplementing the party's response to that discovery.\n\f\f\f\f\f\fSec. 231.009.
