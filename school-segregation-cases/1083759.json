We hold\n\n that Kreiner v Fischer, 471 Mich 109; 683 NW2d 611 (2004), was wrongly decided\n\n because it departed from the plain language of MCL 500.3135, and is therefore overruled.\n\fWe further hold that, in this case, as a matter of law, plaintiff suffered a serious\n\nimpairment of a body function. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case to the trial\n\ncourt for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                            I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n       This case arises out of an injury that plaintiff, Rodney McCormick, suffered while\n\nworking as a medium truck loader at a General Motors Corporation (GM) plant.1\n\nPlaintiff’s job mainly consisted of assisting in the loading of trucks, which required\n\nclimbing up and around trucks and trailers, standing, walking, and heavy lifting. He\n\ngenerally worked nine- to ten-hour shifts, six days a week.\n\n       On January 17, 2005, a coworker backed a truck into plaintiff, knocking him over,\n\nand then drove over plaintiff’s left ankle. Plaintiff was immediately taken to the hospital,\n\nand x-rays showed a fracture of his left medial malleolus.2 Plaintiff was released from\n\nthe hospital that day, and two days later metal hardware was surgically inserted into his\n\nankle to stabilize plaintiff’s bone fragments. Plaintiff was restricted from weight-bearing\n\nactivities for one month after the surgery and then underwent multiple months of physical\n\ntherapy. The metal hardware was removed in a second surgery on October 21, 2005.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The only defendant remaining at this point in the case is GM’s indemnitor,\nAllied Automotive Group, Inc, because the parties have stipulated the release of the other\noriginal defendants. For simplicity’s sake, the opinion will use “defendant” to refer to\nthis entity.\n       2\n         The medial malleolus is the bony prominence that protrudes from the medial side\nof the ankle. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary (26th ed).\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       At defendant’s request, plaintiff underwent a medical evaluation with Dr. Paul\n\nDrouillard in November 2005. He indicated that plaintiff could return to work but was\n\nrestricted from prolonged standing or walking. On January 12, 2006, the specialist who\n\nperformed plaintiff’s surgeries cleared him to return to work without restrictions. The\n\nspecialist’s report noted that plaintiff had an “excellent range of motion,” and an x-ray\n\nshowed “solid healing with on [sic] degenerative joint disease of his ankle.”\n\n       Beginning on January 16, 2006, plaintiff returned to work as a medium truck\n\nloader for several days, but he had difficulty walking, climbing, and crouching because of\n\ncontinuing ankle pain. He requested that his job duties be restricted to driving, but\n\ndefendant directed him to cease work.\n\n       Defendant required plaintiff to undergo a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) in\n\nMarch 2006. The FCE determined that plaintiff was unable to perform the range of tasks\n\nhis job required, including stooping, crouching, climbing, sustained standing, and heavy\n\nlifting. This was due to ankle and shoulder pain,3 a moderate limp, and difficulty bearing\n\nweight on his left ankle. The report stated that plaintiff’s range of motion in his left ankle\n\nwas not within normal limits and that difficulty climbing and lifting weights had been\n\nreported and observed.\n\n       In May 2006, Dr. Drouillard examined plaintiff again and reported that plaintiff\n\ncould return to work. Dr. Drouillard’s report stated that plaintiff complained of ankle and\n\n\n       3\n         Plaintiff had a pre-existing back and shoulder injury that is unrelated to the\nincident in this case.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\ffoot pain, but the doctor found “no objective abnormality to correspond with his\n\nsubjective complaints.” In June 2006, plaintiff also underwent a magnetic resonance\n\nimaging (MRI) test, which showed some postoperative scar and degenerative tissue\n\nformation around his left ankle. At plaintiff’s request, another FCE was performed on\n\nAugust 1, 2006, which affirmed that plaintiff could return to work without restriction and\n\nwas capable of performing the tasks required for his job. The report stated that plaintiff\n\ncomplained of “occasional aching” and tightness in his ankle, but it did not appear to be\n\naggravated by activities such as prolonged standing or walking.          It also noted that\n\nplaintiff’s range of motion in his left ankle was still not within normal limits, although it\n\nhad improved since the March 2006 FCE.\n\n       Plaintiff returned to work on August 16, 2006, 19 months after he suffered his\n\ninjury. He volunteered to be assigned to a different job, and his pay was not reduced. He\n\nhas been able to perform his new job since that time.\n\n       On March 24, 2006, plaintiff filed suit, seeking recovery for his injuries under\n\nMCL 500.3135. In his October 2006 deposition, plaintiff testified that at the time of the\n\nincident, he was a 49-year-old man and his normal life before the incident mostly\n\nconsisted of working 60 hours a week as a medium-duty truck loader. He stated that he\n\nalso was a “weekend golfer” and frequently fished in the spring and summer from a boat\n\nthat he owns. He testified that he was fishing at pre-incident levels by the spring and\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fsummer of 2006, but he has only golfed once since he returned to work.4 He stated that\n\nhe can drive and take care of his personal needs without assistance and that his\n\nrelationship with his wife has not been affected. He stated that he has not sought medical\n\ntreatment for his ankle since January 2006, when he was approved to return to work\n\nwithout restriction. He further testified that his life is “painful, but normal,” although it is\n\n“limited,” and he continues to experience ankle pain.\n\n       The trial court granted defendant’s motion for summary disposition on the basis\n\nthat plaintiff had recovered relatively well and could not meet the serious impairment\n\nthreshold provided in MCL 500.3135(1). The Court of Appeals affirmed, with one judge\n\ndissenting. McCormick v Carrier, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of\n\nAppeals, issued March 25, 2008 (Docket No. 275888). The majority held that, under\n\nKreiner, plaintiff’s impairment did not affect his ability to lead his normal life because he\n\nis able to care for himself, fish and golf, and work at the same rate of pay. The dissent\n\ndisagreed, arguing that two doctors had determined that the impairment would cause\n\n\n       4\n          There are no facts in the record regarding the extent to which plaintiff fished\nbetween January 2005 and January 2006 or the extent to which he was able to golf in the\nperiod between the incident and when he returned to work, despite the arguments to the\ncontrary by both parties and the dissent. Defendant has alleged that plaintiff was able to\nfish while he was not working, but the only factual support it cites is plaintiff’s statement\nthat he fished in the six or seven months after January 2006, which was when he was\ninitially cleared to return to work, and when he actually returned to work. Although\nplaintiff’s counsel agreed in the arguments before the trial court that plaintiff had been\nfishing, it was unclear as to what time period he was referring. In plaintiff’s brief to this\nCourt, he alleges that by the time of his deposition, he had “returned” to fishing with the\nsame frequency as before the accident, which suggests that plaintiff might be arguing that\nhis fishing activities were interrupted.\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fproblems over plaintiff’s entire life and his employer had determined that he could not\n\nperform his work duties, the main part of his “normal” life.\n\n       After initially denying leave to appeal, this Court granted plaintiff’s motion for\n\nreconsideration, vacated its prior order, and granted the application for leave to appeal.\n\nMcCormick v Carrier, 485 Mich 851 (2009).\n\n                             II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       This Court reviews a motion for summary disposition de novo. In re Smith Trust,\n\n480 Mich 19, 23-24; 745 NW2d 754 (2008). The proper interpretation of a statute is a\n\nlegal question that this Court also reviews de novo. Herman v Berrien Co, 481 Mich\n\n352, 358; 750 NW2d 570 (2008).\n\n                                     III. ANALYSIS\n\n       The issue presented in this case is the proper interpretation of MCL 500.3135. We\n\nhold that Kreiner incorrectly interpreted MCL 500.3135 and is overruled because it is\n\ninconsistent with the statute’s plain language and this opinion. Further, under the proper\n\ninterpretation of the statute, plaintiff has demonstrated that, as a matter of law, he\n\nsuffered a serious impairment of body function.\n\n                          A. OVERVIEW OF MCL 500.3135\n\n       In 1973, the Michigan Legislature adopted the no-fault insurance act, MCL\n\n500.3101 et seq. The act created a compulsory motor vehicle insurance program under\n\nwhich insureds may recover directly from their insurers, without regard to fault, for\n\nqualifying economic losses arising from motor vehicle incidents. See MCL 500.3101 and\n\n500.3105. In exchange for ensuring certain and prompt recovery for economic loss, the\n\n\n                                             6\n\fact also limited tort liability. MCL 500.3135. See also DiFranco v Pickard, 427 Mich\n\n32, 40-41; 398 NW2d 896 (1986). The act was designed to remedy problems with the\n\ntraditional tort system as it relates to automobile accidents. These included that “[the\n\ncontributory negligence liability scheme] denied benefits to a high percentage of motor\n\nvehicle accident victims, minor injuries were overcompensated, serious injuries were\n\nundercompensated, long payment delays were commonplace, the court system was\n\noverburdened, and those with low income and little education suffered discrimination.”\n\nShavers v Attorney General, 402 Mich 554, 579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).\n\n       Under the act, tort liability for non-economic loss arising out of the ownership,\n\nmaintenance, or use of a qualifying motor vehicle is limited to a list of enumerated\n\ncircumstances. MCL 500.3135(3). The act creates threshold requirements in MCL\n\n500.3135(1), which has remained unchanged in all key aspects since the act was adopted.\n\nThat subsection currently provides that “[a] person remains subject to tort liability for\n\nnoneconomic loss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle\n\nonly if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or\n\npermanent serious disfigurement.”\n\n       The threshold requirement at issue in this case is whether plaintiff has suffered\n\n“serious impairment of body function.” The act did not originally define this phrase.\n\nAccordingly, it initially fell to this Court to do so, and the result was a series of differing\n\nopinions. In Cassidy v McGovern, 415 Mich 483; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), this Court held\n\nthat whether the serious impairment threshold is met is a question of law for the court to\n\ndecide where there is no material disputed fact. Id. at 502. It further held that in order to\n\n\n                                              7\n\fmeet the threshold, the plaintiff must show an objectively manifested injury and an\n\nimpairment of an important body function, which it defined as “an objective standard that\n\nlooks to the effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal life.” Id. at\n\n505. This Court later in part modified and in part affirmed Cassidy in DiFranco, supra.\n\nThe DiFranco Court agreed that a plaintiff had to suffer an objectively manifested injury,\n\nbut it rejected the Cassidy Court’s determination that the impairment needed to be\n\n“important” and its definition of “important.” DiFranco, 427 Mich at 61-67, 70-75. The\n\nDiFranco Court further held that whether the threshold is met is a question of law for the\n\ncourt only if there are no material disputed facts and the facts could not support\n\nconflicting inferences. Id. at 53-54.\n\n       In 1995, however, the Legislature intervened. It amended MCL 500.3135 to\n\ndefine a “serious impairment of body function” as “an objectively manifested impairment\n\nof an important body function that affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life.” MCL 500.3135(7). The Legislature also expressly provided that whether a\n\nserious impairment of body function has occurred is a “question[] of law” for the court to\n\ndecide unless there is a factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of injury and the\n\ndispute is relevant to deciding whether the standard is met. MCL 500.3135(2)(a). Thus,\n\nthe Legislature incorporated some language from DiFranco and Cassidy but also made\n\nsome significant changes.5\n\n\n       5\n         Some courts have broadly stated that the Legislature rejected DiFranco in favor\nof Cassidy, see Kreiner, 471 Mich at 121 n 8, but that is an oversimplification. Some of\nthe language adopted by the Legislature was used consistently in both DiFranco and\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       This Court interpreted the amended provisions in 2004, in Kreiner. The question\n\nbefore this Court is whether the Kreiner majority properly interpreted the statute, and, if\n\nnot, whether its interpretation should be overruled.\n\n                       B. INTERPRETATION OF MCL 500.3135\n\n       The primary goal of statutory construction is to give effect to the Legislature’s\n\nintent. Briggs Tax Serv, LLC v Detroit Pub Sch, 485 Mich 69, 76; 780 NW2d 753\n\n(2010). This Court begins by reviewing the language of the statute, and, if the language\n\nis clear and unambiguous, it is presumed that the Legislature intended the meaning\n\nexpressed in the statute. Id. Judicial construction of an unambiguous statute is neither\n\nrequired nor permitted.6 In re MCI Telecom Complaint, 460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d\n\n164 (1999). When reviewing a statute, all non-technical “words and phrases shall be\n\nconstrued and understood according to the common and approved usage of the\n\nlanguage,” MCL 8.3a, and, if a term is not defined in the statute, a court may consult a\n\ndictionary to aid it in this goal. Oakland Co Bd of Co Rd Comm’rs v Mich Prop & Cas\n\n\nCassidy, and the Legislature clearly rejected some elements of Cassidy. The similarities\nand differences between DiFranco and Cassidy and the amendments to MCL 500.3135\nwill be discussed below to the extent that they are significant. Although the dissent\ndisagrees in the abstract with my statement that it is an oversimplification to state that the\nLegislature merely rejected DiFranco in favor of Cassidy, I can only conclude that it is\nunable to support this accusation with any specific, substantive arguments, given that it\nfails to expressly address or reject my more nuanced analysis of each of the specific\nphrases that the Legislature adopted or rejected from Cassidy and DiFranco.\n       6\n      This Court’s members disagree on when a statute is ambiguous. See Petersen v\nMagna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 310-313 (opinion by KELLY, C.J.), 339-342 (opinion by\nHATHAWAY, J.); 773 NW2d 564 (2009). We need not address that issue here because\nMCL 500.3135 is unambiguous under any of the views.\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fGuaranty Ass’n, 456 Mich 590, 604; 575 NW2d 751 (1998). A court should consider the\n\nplain meaning of a statute’s words and their “‘placement and purpose in the statutory\n\nscheme.’” Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, 460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999)\n\n(citation omitted). “Where the language used has been subject to judicial interpretation,\n\nthe legislature is presumed to have used particular words in the sense in which they have\n\nbeen interpreted.” People v Powell, 280 Mich 699, 703; 274 NW 372 (1937). See also\n\nPeople v Wright, 432 Mich 84, 92; 437 NW2d 603 (1989).\n\n           1. A QUESTION OF LAW OR FACT UNDER MCL 500.3135(2)\n\n      The first step in interpreting MCL 500.3135 is to determine the proper role of a\n\ncourt in applying MCL 500.3135(1) and (7). The Legislature addressed this issue in the\n\namended MCL 500.3135(2)(a), which states in relevant part:\n\n          The issues of whether an injured person has suffered serious impairment\n      of body function or permanent serious disfigurement are questions of law\n      for the court if the court finds either of the following:\n\n          (i) There is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of\n      the person’s injuries.\n\n         (ii) There is a factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of\n      the person’s injuries, but the dispute is not material to the\n      determination as to whether the person has suffered a serious\n      impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement.\n\n      Under the plain language of the statute, the threshold question whether the person\n\nhas suffered a serious impairment of body function should be determined by the court as\n\na matter of law as long as there is no factual dispute regarding “the nature and extent of\n\nthe person’s injuries” that is material to determining whether the threshold standards are\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fmet.7 If there is a material factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of the person’s\n\ninjuries, the court should not decide the issue as a matter of law.8 Notably, the disputed\n\n\n       7\n          Notably, MCL 500.3135(2)(a) could unconstitutionally conflict with MCR\n2.116(C)(10) in those cases wherein a court is required to (1) resolve material, disputed\nfacts with regard to issues other than the nature and extent of the injury, such as the\nextent to which the injury actually impairs a body function or the injured party relied on\nthat function as part of his or her pre-accident life, or (2) decide whether the threshold is\nmet even though reasonable people could draw different conclusions from the facts. See\nSkinner v Square D Co, 445 Mich 153, 161-162; 516 NW2d 475 (1994), and Henderson\nv State Farm Fire & Cas Co, 460 Mich 348, 357; 596 NW2d 190 (1999).\n\n        Given that the allocation of decision-making authority between a judge and a jury\nis “a quintessentially procedural determination,” Shropshire v Laidlaw Transit, Inc, 550\nF3d 570, 573 (CA 6, 2008), this potential conflict raises questions as to whether the\nLegislature may have unconstitutionally invaded this Court’s exclusive authority to\npromulgate the court rules of practice and procedure to the extent that MCL\n500.3135(2)(a) is merely procedural. See Perin v Peuler (On Rehearing), 373 Mich 531,\n541; 130 NW2d 4 (1964). We do not reach this issue today because we conclude that\nthere are no material factual disputes affecting the serious impairment threshold\ndetermination in this case. Notably, however, the division of questions of law and fact\nbetween a judge and a jury is based on longstanding procedural rules, see Mawich v\nElsey, 47 Mich 10, 15-16; 10 NW 57 (1881), that are intended to promote judicial\nefficiency. See Moll v Abbott Laboratories, 444 Mich 1, 26-28; 506 NW2d 816 (1993).\nWhether MCL 500.3135(2)(a) serves a purpose other than judicial dispatch is not clear,\nas the Legislature itself stated that the 1995 amendments were intended, in part, “to\nprescribe certain procedures for maintaining [tort liability arising out of certain\naccidents].” See the title of 1995 PA 222. And, of course, the scope of the rules\ngoverning summary disposition are also supported—if not compelled—by the right to a\njury trial in civil cases. See, generally, Conservation Dep’t v Brown, 335 Mich 343, 346-\n347; 55 NW2d 859 (1952), and Dunn v Dunn, 11 Mich 284, 286 (1863). Accord Byrd v\nBlue Ridge Rural Electric Coop, Inc, 356 US 525, 537-538; 78 S Ct 893; 2 L Ed 2d 953\n(1958). Interestingly, the dissent states that it disagrees with the majority that there could\nbe a conflict between the statute and the court rule, but it also approvingly quotes\nDiFranco for the proposition that reasonable minds can often differ over the threshold\nissues in these cases.\n       8\n        This plain reading of the statute is not necessarily inconsistent with the Kreiner\nmajority’s interpretation of MCL 500.3135(2)(a), see Kreiner, 471 Mich at 131-132, but\nneither the majority nor dissent in Kreiner discussed the constitutionality of this\n\n\n                                             11\n\ffact does not need to be outcome determinative in order to be material, but it should be\n\n“significant or essential to the issue or matter at hand.” Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed)\n\n(defining “material fact”).\n\n                2. A “SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT OF BODY FUNCTION”\n                         UNDER MCL 500.3135(1) AND (7)\n\n       In those cases where the court may decide whether the serious impairment\n\nthreshold is met as a matter of law, the next issue is the proper interpretation of MCL\n\n500.3135(7). It provides that, for purposes of the section, a “serious impairment of body\n\nfunction” is “an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that\n\naffects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life.” On its face, the\n\nstatutory language provides three prongs that are necessary to establish a “serious\n\nimpairment of body function”: (1) an objectively manifested impairment (2) of an\n\nimportant body function that (3) affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life.9\n\n       Overall, because we conclude that each of these prongs’ meaning is clear from the\n\nplain and unambiguous statutory language, judicial construction is neither required nor\n\n\n\nprovision. As noted in footnote 7 of this opinion, however, the manner in which Kreiner\ninterpreted the statute may be unconstitutional to the extent that it requires a court to\nusurp the role of the fact-finder. That issue is not presented on the facts of this case,\nhowever.\n       9\n         The Kreiner majority first addressed whether the impaired body function was\nimportant and then analyzed whether the impairment was objectively manifested. 471\nMich at 132-133. We find it more consistent with the statutory text to first address the\nobjectively manifested impairment requirement.\n\n\n\n                                           12\n\fpermitted. In re MCI, 460 Mich at 411. Notably, however, a dictionary may aid the\n\nCourt in giving the words and phrases in MCL 500.3135(7) their common meaning, and\n\nwhere the language used in MCL 500.3135(7) was originally adopted and interpreted in\n\nCassidy and DiFranco, it may be presumed that the Legislature intended the previous\n\njudicial interpretation to be relevant. Oakland Co Bd of Rd Comm’rs, 456 Mich at 604,\n\nand Wright, 432 Mich at 92. As will be discussed within, where the Kreiner majority’s\n\ninterpretation of these prongs is inconsistent with the clear language of the statute, we\n\nhold that Kreiner was wrongly decided. Most significantly, its interpretation of the third\n\nprong deviates dramatically from the statute’s text.\n\n                 a. AN OBJECTIVELY MANIFESTED IMPAIRMENT\n\n       Under the first prong, it must be established that the injured person has suffered an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of body function. The common meaning of “an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment” is apparent from the unambiguous statutory\n\nlanguage, with aid from a dictionary, and is consistent with the judicial interpretation of\n\n“objectively manifested” in Cassidy and DiFranco.         To the extent that the Kreiner\n\nmajority’s interpretation of this prong differs from this approach, it was wrongly decided.\n\n       To begin with, the adverb “objectively” is defined as “in an objective manner,”\n\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary (1966), and the adjective “objective” is\n\ndefined as “1. Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental\n\nconcept. 2. Having actual existence or reality. 3. a. Uninfluenced by emotion, surmise, or\n\npersonal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomena; presented factually . . . .” The\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982). It is defined specifically\n\n\n                                            13\n\fin the medical context as “[i]ndicating a symptom or condition perceived as a sign of\n\ndisease by someone other than the person afflicted.” Id.10 The verb “manifest” is defined\n\nas “1. To show or demonstrate plainly; reveal. 2. To be evidence of; prove.” Id. Overall,\n\nthese definitions suggest that the common meaning of “objectively manifested” in MCL\n\n500.3135(7) is an impairment that is evidenced by actual symptoms or conditions that\n\nsomeone other than the injured person would observe or perceive as impairing a body\n\nfunction.   In other words, an “objectively manifested” impairment is commonly\n\nunderstood as one observable or perceivable from actual symptoms or conditions.\n\n      Notably, MCL 500.3135(7) does not contain the word “injury,” and, under the\n\nplain language of the statute, the proper inquiry is whether the impairment is objectively\n\nmanifested, not the injury or its symptoms.11 This distinction is important because\n\n“injury” and “impairment” have different meanings. An “injury” is “1. Damage of or to a\n\nperson . . . 2. A wound or other specific damage.” The American Heritage Dictionary,\n\n\n      10\n          See also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1966), defining\n“objective,” in relevant part, as “publicly or intersubjectively observable or verifiable\nespecially by scientific methods: independent of what is personal or private in our\napprehension and feelings: of such nature that rational minds agree in holding it real or\ntrue or valid.” It also defines “objective” in the context “of a symptom of disease” as\n“perceptible to persons other than an affected individual.” Id. (italics omitted).\n      11\n          Accordingly, the Court of Appeals decisions that have gone beyond the plain\nlanguage of the statute and imposed an extra-textual “objectively manifested injury”\nrequirement, in clear contravention of Legislative intent, are overruled to the extent that\nthey are inconsistent with this opinion. See, e.g., Netter v Bowman, 272 Mich App 289,\n305; 725 NW2d 353 (2006) (holding that “the current meaning of ‘objectively\nmanifested’ . . . requires that a plaintiff’s injury must be capable of objective\nverification”.\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fSecond College Edition (1982). “Impairment” is the “state of being impaired,” Webster’s\n\nThird New International Dictionary (1966), and to be “impaired” means being\n\n“weakened, diminished, or damaged” or “functioning poorly or inadequately.” Random\n\nHouse Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary (1998). These definitions show that while an\n\ninjury is the actual damage or wound, an impairment generally relates to the effect of that\n\ndamage. Accordingly, when considering an “impairment,” the focus “is not on the\n\ninjuries themselves, but how the injuries affected a particular body function.” DiFranco,\n\n427 Mich at 67.\n\n       Further, the pre-existing judicial interpretation of “objectively manifested” is\n\nconsistent with the plain language of the later-adopted statute. In Cassidy, this Court\n\nexplained that the serious impairment threshold was not met by pain and suffering alone,\n\nbut also required “injuries that affect the functioning of the body,” i.e., “objectively\n\nmanifested injuries.”    Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505.       In other words, Cassidy defined\n\n“objectively manifested” to mean affecting the functioning of the body.12 DiFranco\n\naffirmed this and further explained that the “objectively manifested” requirement\n\nsignifies that plaintiffs must “introduce evidence establishing that there is a physical basis\n\nfor their subjective complaints of pain and suffering” and that showing an impairment\n\ngenerally requires medical testimony. DiFranco, 427 Mich at 74.\n\n\n\n       12\n          Although the Legislature plainly rejected that it is the injury that should be\nobjectively manifested, as opposed to the impairment, the previous judicial construction\nof “objectively manifested” is still relevant.\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       The Kreiner majority’s interpretation of this language was only partially consistent\n\nwith the plain language of the statute.      It addressed this issue briefly, stating that\n\n“[s]ubjective complaints that are not medically documented are insufficient [to establish\n\nthat an impairment is objectively manifested].” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132. To the extent\n\nthat this is inconsistent with DiFranco’s statement that medical testimony will generally\n\nbe required to establish an impairment, it is at odds with the legislative intent expressed\n\nby the adoption of the “objectively manifested” language from DiFranco and Cassidy.\n\nThus, to the extent that Kreiner could be read to always require medical documentation, it\n\ngoes beyond the legislative intent expressed in the plain statutory text, and was wrongly\n\ndecided.\n\n                      b. OF AN IMPORTANT BODY FUNCTION\n\n       If there is an objectively manifested impairment of body function, the next\n\nquestion is whether the impaired body function is “important.” The common meaning of\n\nthis phrase is expressed in the unambiguous statutory language, although reference to a\n\ndictionary and limited reference to Cassidy is helpful.\n\n       The relevant definition of the adjective “important” is “[m]arked by or having\n\ngreat value, significance, or consequence.” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second\n\nCollege Edition (1982). See also Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary\n\n(1998), defining “important” in relevant part as “of much or great significance or\n\nconsequence,” “mattering much,” or “prominent or large.” Whether a body function has\n\ngreat “value,” “significance,” or “consequence” will vary depending on the person.\n\nTherefore, this prong is an inherently subjective inquiry that must be decided on a case-\n\n\n                                            16\n\fby-case basis, because what may seem to be a trivial body function for most people may\n\nbe subjectively important to some, depending on the relationship of that function to the\n\nperson’s life.\n\n       The “important body function” language was originally adopted in Cassidy, where\n\nthe Court stated that an “important” body function is not any body function but also does\n\nnot refer to the entire body function. Cassidy, 415 Mich at 504. This pre-existing\n\njudicial construction of “important body function” is consistent with the common\n\nmeaning of “important.”13\n\n       For this prong, the Kreiner majority’s interpretation appears to be consistent with\n\nthe plain language of the statute, as it only briefly stated that “[i]t is insufficient if the\n\nimpairment is of an unimportant body function.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132.14                If,\n\nhowever, the Kreiner majority’s position has been construed in a manner that is\n\ninconsistent with this opinion, then we disapprove of those constructions.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n           Cassidy also held that the importance of a body function is an objective\nstandard based on its effect on “the person’s general ability to live a normal life.”\nCassidy, 415 Mich at 505 (emphasis added). As discussed below, however, the\nLegislature specifically rejected the idea that the normal life evaluation should be\nobjective, and, thus, implicitly rejected Cassidy’s determination that whether a body\nfunction is “important” could be objectively determined outside the context of the\nperson’s actual life. Notably, DiFranco is inapposite because it rejected the “important\nbody function” test. DiFranco, 427 Mich at 61-62.\n       14\n         The Kreiner majority also apparently agreed that this is a subjective, case-by-\ncase inquiry. Kreiner, 471 Mich at 134 n 19.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f              c. THAT AFFECTS THE PERSON’S GENERAL ABILITY\n                     TO LEAD HIS OR HER NORMAL LIFE\n\n       Finally, if the injured person has suffered an objectively manifested impairment of\n\nbody function, and that body function is important to that person, then the court must\n\ndetermine whether the impairment “affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life.” The common meaning of this phrase is expressed by the unambiguous\n\nstatutory language, and its interpretation is aided by reference to a dictionary, reading the\n\nphrase within its statutory context, and limited reference to Cassidy.\n\n       To begin with, the verb “affect” is defined as “[t]o have an influence on; bring\n\nabout a change in.” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982).\n\nAn “ability” is “[t]he quality of being able to do something,” id., and “able” is defined as\n\n“having sufficient power, skill, or resources to accomplish an object.” Merriam-Webster\n\nOnline Dictionary, <http://www.merriam-webster.com> (accessed May 27, 2010). The\n\nadjective “general” means:\n\n              1. Relating to, concerned with, or applicable to the whole or every\n       member of a class or category. 2. Affecting or characteristic of the majority\n       of those involved; prevalent: a general discontent. 3. Being usually the\n       case; true or applicable in most instances but not all. 4. a. Not limited in\n       scope, area, or application: as a general rule. b. Not limited to one class of\n       things: general studies. 5. Involving only the main features of something\n       rather than details or particulars. 6. Highest or superior in rank.” [The\n       American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982).]\n\nThe sixth definition is obviously irrelevant, and the first definition of “general” does not\n\nmake sense in this context because a person’s “whole” ability to live his or her normal\n\nlife is surely not affected short of complete physical and mental incapacitation, which is\n\naccounted for in a different statutory threshold: death. The other definitions, however,\n\n\n                                             18\n\fmore or less convey the same meaning: that “general” does not refer to only one specific\n\ndetail or particular part of a thing, but, at least some parts of it. Thus, these definitions\n\nillustrate that to “affect” the person’s “general ability” to lead his or her normal life is to\n\ninfluence some of the person’s power or skill, i.e., the person’s capacity, to lead a normal\n\nlife.\n\n        The next question is the meaning of “to lead his or her normal life.” The verb\n\n“lead,” in this context, is best defined as “[t]o pass or go through; live.” The American\n\nHeritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982). Although the verb “lead” has many\n\ndefinitions, some of which have similar nuances, this definition is the most relevant\n\nbecause it expressly applies in the context of leading a certain type of life. Indeed, other\n\ndictionaries provide a similar definition with the same context, using a “type of life” as an\n\nexample.15 Similarly, “life” has multiple meanings, but one specifically references the\n\ncontext of leading a particular type of life, which is “[a] manner of living: led a good\n\nlife.” Id. Other definitions are similar, such as “[t]he physical, mental, and spiritual\n\nexperiences that constitute a person’s existence,” or “[h]uman existence or activity in\n\ngeneral.”    Id.   Given the contextual examples used in the dictionary, the common\n\nunderstanding of “to lead his or her normal life” is to live, or pass life, in his or her\n\nnormal manner of living.\n\n\n        15\n          See Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary (1998), defining “lead”\nas “to go through or pass (time, life, etc.): to lead a full life,” and Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary (1966), defining it as “to go through (life or some other period\nof time): PASS, LIVE <there he led a very peaceful existence>.”\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f       Therefore, the plain text of the statute and these definitions demonstrate that the\n\ncommon understanding of to “affect the person’s ability to lead his or her normal life” is\n\nto have an influence on some of the person’s capacity to live in his or her normal manner\n\nof living. By modifying “normal life” with “his or her,” the Legislature indicated that\n\nthis requires a subjective, person- and fact-specific inquiry that must be decided on a\n\ncase-by-case basis. Determining the effect or influence that the impairment has had on a\n\nplaintiff’s ability to lead a normal life necessarily requires a comparison of the plaintiff’s\n\nlife before and after the incident.\n\n       There are several important points to note, however, with regard to this\n\ncomparison. First, the statute merely requires that a person’s general ability to lead his or\n\nher normal life has been affected, not destroyed. Thus, courts should consider not only\n\nwhether the impairment has led the person to completely cease a pre-incident activity or\n\nlifestyle element, but also whether, although a person is able to lead his or her pre-\n\nincident normal life, the person’s general ability to do so was nonetheless affected.\n\n       Second, and relatedly, “general” modifies “ability,” not “affect” or “normal life.”\n\nThus, the plain language of the statute only requires that some of the person’s ability to\n\nlive in his or her normal manner of living has been affected, not that some of the person’s\n\nnormal manner of living has itself been affected. Thus, while the extent to which a\n\nperson’s general ability to live his or her normal life is affected by an impairment is\n\nundoubtedly related to what the person’s normal manner of living is, there is no\n\nquantitative minimum as to the percentage of a person’s normal manner of living that\n\nmust be affected.\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       Third, and finally, the statute does not create an express temporal requirement as\n\nto how long an impairment must last in order to have an effect on “the person’s general\n\nability to live his or her normal life.” To begin with, there is no such requirement in the\n\nplain language of the statute. Further, MCL 500.3135(1) provides that the threshold for\n\nliability is met “if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body\n\nfunction, or permanent serious disfigurement.” While the Legislature required that a\n\n“serious disfigurement” be “permanent,” it did not impose the same restriction on a\n\n“serious impairment of body function.” Finally, to the extent that this prong’s language\n\nreflects a legislative intent to adopt this portion of Cassidy in some measure,16 Cassidy\n\nexpressly rejected a requirement of permanency to meet the serious impairment\n\nthreshold. Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505-506 (noting that “two broken bones, 18 days of\n\nhospitalization, 7 months of wearing casts during which dizzy spells further affected his\n\nmobility, and at least a minor residual effect one and one-half years later are sufficiently\n\nserious to meet the threshold requirement of serious impairment of body function”).\n\n       Despite the fact that the language of the statute was plain, the Kreiner majority\n\ndeviated significantly from the statutory text in its interpretation of this prong. To begin\n\nwith, the Kreiner majority erred in its interpretation of the phrase “that affects the\n\nperson’s general ability” for two reasons. First, it selectively quoted only the dictionary\n\n       16\n          Although some of this prong’s text is derived from Cassidy, the Legislature\nmade important modifications. The Cassidy Court stated that the serious impairment\nthreshold “looks to the effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal\nlife,” Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505, and the Legislature rejected that the standard for “a”\nnormal life was objective.\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fdefinitions of “general” that best supported its conclusions. It gave one definition for this\n\nword, “‘the whole; the total; that which comprehends or relates to all, or the chief part; a\n\ngeneral proposition, fact, principle, etc.;—opposed to particular; that is, opposed to\n\nspecial,’” and then relied on definitions of “in general” and “generally” to conclude that\n\n“general” means “‘for the most part.’” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 130, quoting Webster’s New\n\nInternational Dictionary. Webster’s, however, offers 10 definitions of the adjective\n\n“general,” many of which are similar to definitions quoted above from The American\n\nHeritage Dictionary. Moreover, of these 10 definitions, the majority chose the most\n\nrestrictive, even though, as discussed above, it does not make the most sense in this\n\ncontext. And, even then, the Kreiner majority looked to other forms of the word.\n\nSecond, the Kreiner majority stated that “[t]he starting point in analyzing whether an\n\nimpairment affects a person’s ‘general,’ i.e., overall, ability to lead his normal life should\n\nbe identifying how his life has been affected, by how much, and for how long.” Kreiner,\n\n471 Mich at 131. Although other portions of the Kreiner majority opinion more carefully\n\nstated that the test was the effect on a person’s general ability, this particular reasoning\n\ncould be pulled out of context to suggest that courts should focus on how much the\n\nimpairment affects a person’s life, instead of how much it affects the person’s ability to\n\nlive his or her life.\n\n       Further, the Kreiner majority significantly erred in its interpretation of “to lead his\n\nor her normal life.” It relied on a dictionary to define “lead” as “to conduct or bring in a\n\nparticular course.” Notably, depending on how this definition is interpreted, it may have\n\na similar meaning to “live” or “pass” when “conduct” and “course” are given a certain\n\n\n                                             22\n\fmeaning. “Conduct” can mean “to behave or act,” and “course” can mean “[a] mode of\n\naction or behavior” or “[a] typical or natural manner of proceeding or developing:\n\ncustomary passage . . . .” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition\n\n(1982). The meaning of “to behave or act in his or her typical or natural manner of\n\nproceeding” may be similar to “living in his or her normal manner of living.”\n\n       Beyond this point, however, the Kreiner majority went astray and gave the statute\n\na labored interpretation inconsistent with common meanings and common sense.\n\nApplying its chosen definition of “lead,” the majority concluded that “the effect of the\n\nimpairment on the course of a plaintiff’s entire normal life must be considered,” and if\n\n“the course or trajectory of the plaintiff’s normal life has not been affected, then the\n\nplaintiff’s ‘general ability’ to lead his normal life has not been affected . . . .” Kreiner,\n\n471 Mich at 131. In other words, the Kreiner majority held that the “common meaning”\n\nof whether an impairment has affected “the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life” is whether it has affected the person’s general ability to conduct the course\n\nor trajectory of his or her entire normal life. This “common meaning” is quite different\n\nfrom the actual statutory text in form and substance. Significantly, the Kreiner majority’s\n\ninterpretation of the statute interjects two terms that are not included in the statute or the\n\ndictionary definitions of the relevant statutory language: “trajectory” and “entire.” Both\n\nterms create ambiguity where the original statutory text had none, and the Kreiner\n\nmajority thus erred by selectively defining the words used in definitions of statutory\n\nterms in order to shift away from the common meaning that the words have in the context\n\nof MCL 500.3135(7).\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       As to the first addition, while “trajectory” is a synonym for “course” when\n\n“course” is defined as, for example, “[t]he direction of continuing movement,” The\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982), it is not a synonym for\n\nthe definition of “course” that makes sense in the context of defining a “general ability to\n\nlead his or her normal life.” When “conduct” is used with this definition of “course,” it\n\nhas the very different meaning of “[t]o direct the course of; control.” Id. The plain\n\nlanguage of the statute does not suggest that the Legislature’s intent was to address the\n\neffect of an impairment on the person’s ability to control the direction of their life, as\n\nopposed to its effect on the person’s ability to live in his or her normal manner of living.\n\nYet the majority managed to imply this meaning by inserting “trajectory” as a synonym\n\nfor “course,” thereby shifting the meaning of “course” from the most natural contextual\n\nreading of the word. The use of “trajectory” and the suggestion that “course” should be\n\nunderstood to mean “the direction of continuing movement,” instead of “a mode of action\n\nor behavior,” creates ambiguity by implying a sense of permanence that is inconsistent\n\nwith, and does not make sense in the context of, the actual statutory language.\n\n       As to the second addition, the majority modified the statutory language “his or her\n\nnormal life” with “entire,” a modification that it apparently created out of thin air,17\n\nthereby creating an ambiguity that had not previously existed in the statutory text. The\n\n\n       17\n         The Kreiner majority did define “in general” as “with respect to the entirety”\nwhen interpreting “general ability.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 130. But, even assuming that\nit is proper to use the definition of the phrase “in general” to define the adjective\n“general,” the Legislature used general to modify ability, not life.\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fword “life” has more than one meaning. As noted, it can refer to the meaning that would\n\nbe commonly understood to apply in the context of the statutory language, which is “a\n\nmanner of living.” It also can refer to “[t]he interval of time between birth and death;\n\nlifetime.” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982). The\n\ndifferences are significant: whereas the first meaning refers to the day-to-day process of\n\nliving, the second is a finite measure that encompasses all of one’s time on earth.\n\nAlthough “entire” could modify either meaning of “life,” it is probably more commonly\n\nused to modify the second. Thus, by inserting “entire,” the Kreiner majority created an\n\nambiguity that is not present in the original statutory text because the second, finite\n\ndefinition of “life” does not make sense in the context of the actual statutory language. It\n\nwould be unusual to refer to someone’s general ability to lead his or her normal\n\n“lifetime” or “interval of time between life and death.” At best, this would seem to refer\n\nto an effect on the person’s life expectancy, but this would not be a subjective inquiry,\n\nand it is an impossible leap from any common understanding of the statutory language.18\n\nAt a minimum, using the modifier “entire” reinforces the general sense of permanence\n\nthat is also created by the insertion of “trajectory,” but which, as explained, is not in the\n\nactual statutory text. Because the Kreiner majority created ambiguity where there was\n\nnone, and crafted a statutory interpretation that is, in effect, a judicially constructed house\n\nof cards, we hold that it incorrectly interpreted the third prong of MCL 500.3135(7).\n\n\n         18\n              It is also to some extent accounted for in another threshold in MCL 500.3135(1):\ndeath.\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\f       The Kreiner majority aggravated this error, and departed even more dramatically\n\nfrom the statutory text, by providing an extra-textual “nonexhaustive list of objective\n\nfactors” to be used to compare the plaintiff’s pre- and post-incident lifestyle. These\n\nfactors are: “(a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length of\n\ntreatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of any residual\n\nimpairment, and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 133.19\n\nThe Legislature has unambiguously defined the “serious impairment of body function,”\n\nand the role of this Court is to apply the plain language of that definition, not to improve\n\nit with a list of judicially created factors that are not necessarily based in the statute’s\n\ntext. In fact, at least some of the Kreiner majority’s factors have no basis in the statutory\n\ntext and are instead derived from its extra-textual and extra-definitional additions to the\n\nactual statutory language, “entire” and “trajectory,” and serve to reinforce the ambiguity\n\nthat its interpretation of the third prong created, especially given that all of the factors\n\nexpressly or impliedly include a temporal component. Because the factors adopted by the\n\nKreiner majority are not based in the statutory text, and this Court’s role is to apply the\n\n\n\n\n       19\n         The majority correctly observes that I do not object to courts employing factors\nwhen applying statutes in many circumstances. I certainly object, however, to courts\ndoing so in a manner that not only perverts the statutory language but is also unsupported\nby, and inconsistent with, the legislative intent expressed by the statutory language, as the\nKreiner majority did.\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\funambiguous statutory language, not improve it, we hold that the majority erred by\n\nadopting them.20\n\n       In summary, the Kreiner majority’s interpretation of the third prong departed from\n\nthe idea that a court “should not casually read anything into an unambiguous statute that\n\nis not within the manifest intent of the Legislature as derived from the words of the\n\nstatute.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 157 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). Indeed, as I remarked in\n\ndissent, the Kreiner majority’s “interpretation” of the plain language of MCL\n\n500.3135(7) was a “chilling reminder that activism comes in all guises, including so-\n\ncalled textualism.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 157. Therefore, we hold that the Kreiner\n\nmajority’s interpretation of this prong, including the list of non-exhaustive factors, is not\n\nbased in the statute’s text and is incorrect.\n\n\n       20\n           Indeed, the potential for the Kreiner majority’s interpretation to be read in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with the statute has been realized in lower court decisions.\nFor example, in Gagne v Schulte, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of\nAppeals, issued February 28, 2006 (Docket No. 264788), the Court of Appeals held that a\nplaintiff had not suffered a serious impairment of body function even though her knee\ninjury resulted in surgery and severe restrictions on her movement for a year after the\naccident, indefinite continuing restrictions on her ability to perform her pre-accident job\nand other activities in which she participated before the accident, and a permanent loss of\nstability in her knee and an increased risk of osteoarthritis. The majority reasoned that\nthese impairments were insufficient to meet the threshold because she might someday be\nable to resume some activities with a knee brace and “there is no evidence that this period\nof decreased function affected her life so extensively that it altered the trajectory or\ncourse of her entire normal life.” Id., unpub op at 2. Indeed, the majority’s reasoning\nseemed to consider whether the plaintiff’s ability to control the direction of her entire life\nhad been altered, rather than her ability to live her life in a normal manner, given that it\nfound the threshold was not met despite evidence that the plaintiff had continuing\nrestrictions on movement, activities, and work, and medically documented long-term\ndamage.\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\f              3. STARE DECISIS: SHOULD KREINER BE OVERRULED?\n\n       To the extent that the Kreiner majority’s interpretation of the statute was\n\ninconsistent with the foregoing approach, and departed from the legislative intent\n\nexpressed in the unambiguous language of the statute, we hold that it was wrongly\n\ndecided. Given this conclusion, the question is whether it should be overruled. We hold\n\nthat it should be.21\n\n       Under the doctrine of stare decisis, “principles of law deliberately examined and\n\ndecided by a court of competent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.” Brown v\n\nManistee Co Rd Comm, 452 Mich 354, 365; 550 NW2d 215 (1996) (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted). Indeed, in order to “‘avoid an arbitrary discretion in the\n\ncourts, it is indispensable that [courts] should be bound down by strict rules and\n\nprecedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that\n\ncomes before them . . . .’” Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 314-315; 773 NW2d\n\n       21\n         The dissenters’ stare decisis protestations should taste like ashes in their mouths.\nTo the principles of stare decisis, to which they paid absolutely no heed as they\ndenigrated the wisdom of innumerable predecessors, the dissenters now would wrap\nthemselves in its benefits to save their recent precedent.\n\n       Ironically, the very doctrine and approach that the dissent vehemently claims to\nadhere to today, from Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), was not\nso faithfully applied by the members of the dissent in the past. Indeed, the members of\nthe dissent have overruled caselaw without even paying lip service to Robinson, see, e.g.,\nPeople v Anstey, 476 Mich 436; 719 NW2d 579 (2006), or after engaging in a cursory or\nlimited analysis of the factors that they claim fidelity to today. See, e.g., Wesche v\nMecosta Co Rd Comm, 480 Mich 75, 91 n 13 (2008); Al-Shimmari v Detroit Med Ctr,\n477 Mich 280, 297 n 10; 731 NW2d 29 (2007); Neal v Wilkes, 470 Mich 661, 667 n 8;\n685 NW2d 648 (2004); People v Hickman, 470 Mich 602, 610 n 6; 684 NW2d 267\n(2004); Mack v Detroit, 467 Mich 186, 203 n 19; 649 NW2d 47 (2002).\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f564 (2009) (opinion by KELLY, C.J.), quoting The Federalist No. 78, p 471 (Alexander\n\nHamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed, 1961). As the United States Supreme Court has stated,\n\nthe doctrine “promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal\n\nprinciples, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and\n\nperceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne v Tennessee, 501 US 808, 827; 111 S\n\nCt 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991).\n\n       Despite its importance, stare decisis is neither an “inexorable command,”\n\nLawrence v Texas, 539 US 558, 577; 123 S Ct 2472; 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003), nor “a\n\nmechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision . . . .” Helvering v Hallock, 309\n\nUS 106, 119; 60 S Ct 444; 84 L Ed 604 (1940). Ultimately, it is an attempt “to balance\n\ntwo competing considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and\n\ndecisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 314. As a\n\nreflection of this balance, there is a presumption in favor of upholding precedent, but this\n\npresumption may be rebutted if there is a special or compelling justification to overturn\n\nprecedent. Id. at 319-320. In determining whether a special or compelling justification\n\nexists, a number of evaluative criteria may be relevant, id., but overturning precedent\n\nrequires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly decided. See Brown, 452 Mich\n\nat 365.22\n\n\n\n       22\n         In Petersen, Chief Justice KELLY provided a non-exhaustive list of criteria that\nmay be considered, but none of the criteria is determinative, and they need only be\nevaluated if relevant. See Petersen, 484 Mich at 320.\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\f       In determining whether Kreiner should be overruled, I find several evaluative\n\ncriteria particularly relevant: (1) “whether the rule has proven to be intolerable because\n\nit defies practical workability,” (2) “whether reliance on the rule is such that overruling\n\nit would cause a special hardship and inequity,” (3) “whether upholding the rule is likely\n\nto result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests,” and (4) “whether the prior\n\ndecision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent.” Petersen,\n\n484 Mich at 320. As applied here, on the balance, these criteria weigh in favor of\n\noverturning Kreiner.\n\n       The first criterion weighs heavily in favor of overruling Kreiner because the\n\nKreiner majority’s departure from the plain language of MCL 500.3135(7) defies\n\npractical workability. As discussed above, the majority took unambiguous statutory text\n\nand, through linguistic gymnastics, contorted it into a confusing and ambiguous test.\n\nAppellate litigation arising out of MCL 500.3135(7) has greatly increased since Kreiner23\n\nand has resulted in confusion. To begin with, the lower courts’ application of Kreiner\n\nhas led to inconsistent interpretation of the statutory language, with similarly situated\n\n\n\n\n       23\n         In the six years since Kreiner was decided, there have been three times as many\nCourt of Appeals cases citing MCL 500.3135(7) as there were in the nine years between\nwhen the amendment was enacted and Kreiner was decided. In the nine years between\nwhen the amendment became effective and when Kreiner was decided, only 86 Court of\nAppeals cases cited MCL 500.3135(7). As of May 27, 2010, in the six years since the\nKreiner decision was issued, there have been 254 Court of Appeals cases citing MCL\n500.3135(7).\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fplaintiffs being treated differently by different courts.24   Further, some courts have\n\ninterpreted Kreiner to create a threshold that is higher than that in Cassidy or DiFranco,\n\nprimarily by reading the Kreiner majority’s interpretation of the statute to effectively\n\ncreate a permanency requirement.25 As discussed, this is contrary to the legislative intent\n\nexpressed by the plain language of the statute.         Because the Kreiner majority’s\n\ninterpretation of the third prong of MCL 500.3135(7) has created ambiguity where there\n\nwas none, and increased litigation and confusion, the first factor weighs heavily in favor\n\nof overruling Kreiner.\n\n       Second, correcting the errors in the Kreiner majority’s interpretation of MCL\n\n500.3135(7) would not present an undue hardship to reliance interests, and this factor\n\nweighs in favor of overruling Kreiner. As this Court has explained when evaluating a\n\nsimilar factor in the past, “the Court must ask whether the previous decision has become\n\n\n       24\n          For example, in Luther v Morris, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court\nof Appeals, issued January 18, 2005 (Docket No. 244483), the Court held that the\nplaintiff had suffered a serious impairment of body function where a dislocated elbow\ncaused her to miss 52 days of work and significantly interfered with her ability to\nperform daily personal tasks for a while, but her life returned to normal within a couple\nof months after the accident. In contrast, in Guevara v Martinez, unpublished opinion per\ncuriam of the Court of Appeals, issued May 24, 2005 (Docket No. 260387), the Court\nheld that there was no serious impairment where the plaintiff suffered a dislocated right\nshoulder and a torn anterior rotator cuff that significantly interfered with his ability to\nperform daily personal tasks for a couple of months and prevented him from continuing\nwork as a part-time construction worker during at least the surgery and multiple months\nof rehabilitation. The outcomes in these cases are difficult to reconcile.\n       25\n         See footnote 20 of this opinion summarizing Gagne v Schulte, unpublished\nopinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 28, 2006 (Docket No.\n264788).\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fso embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone’s expectations that to change it\n\nwould produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.” Robinson v\n\nDetroit, 462 Mich 439, 466; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). It further stated that this factor\n\napplies to cases that if overruled “even if they were wrongfully decided, would produce\n\nchaos.” Id. at 466 n 26. Kreiner is not “so” embedded, accepted, or fundamental to\n\nexpectations that chaos will result from overruling it. To begin with, Kreiner was\n\ndecided only six years ago, and, while it was the first opinion from this Court interpreting\n\nMCL 500.3135(7), it was contrary to the plain text of the statute, which had been in place\n\nsince 1995. As the Robinson majority explained, people normally rely on the words of\n\nthe statute itself when looking for guidance on how to direct their actions. Robinson, 462\n\nMich at 467. Further, it is unlikely that motor vehicle drivers, and the victims of motor\n\nvehicle accidents, have altered their behavior in reliance on Kreiner. As noted by the\n\nRobinson majority, where a statute deals with the consequences of accidents, “it seems\n\nincontrovertible that only after the accident would . . . awareness [of this Court’s\n\ncaselaw] come,” and “after-the-fact awareness does not rise to the level of a reliance\n\ninterest because to have reliance the knowledge must be of the sort that causes a person\n\nor entity to attempt to conform his conduct to a certain norm before the triggering event.”\n\nId. at 466-467. Similarly, this statute generally involves motor vehicle accidents, and it\n\nstrains credibility to think that the average driver and the average future injured party\n\nhave altered their behavior in reliance on Kreiner.\n\n       The third criterion, the effect on the public interest, also weighs in favor of\n\noverruling Kreiner. Although there may be policy arguments on both sides regarding the\n\n\n                                            32\n\fcosts and benefits of having a more or less difficult threshold for recovery under MCL\n\n500.3135, our interpretation of the statute in this case is truer to the statute’s text than\n\nthat of the Kreiner majority, and, thus, our interpretation most closely reflects the policy\n\nbalance struck by the Legislature.26 In contrast, Kreiner altered the balance from that\n\nintended by the Legislature by imposing extra-textual burdens to meeting the threshold,\n\nand, as a result, it is difficult to argue that overruling Kreiner to restore the balance\n\nintended by the Legislature would hurt the public interest (or that affirming Kreiner\n\nserves it).\n\n       Finally, the fourth criterion is neutral. Kreiner was not an abrupt change from\n\nprecedent, but it did provide an interpretation of the statute that was not obvious from the\n\nstatute’s text.\n\n       On the basis of these evaluative criteria, we hold that Kreiner should be overruled.\n\n                        4. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE TEST\n\n       On the basis of the foregoing, the proper interpretation of the clear and\n\nunambiguous language in MCL 500.3135 creates the following test.\n\n       26\n          The dissent devotes a significant amount of time conducting what is essentially\na policy analysis hypothesizing about the disastrous effects that this opinion will have on\nthe insurance industry and, thus, concluding that we are undoing the legislative\ncompromise that was the general backdrop of the no-fault act. While I am cognizant of\nthe legislative compromise, I am less convinced than the dissent that this Court’s role is\nto conduct an independent policy analysis to determine whether the plain language of an\namendment adopted by the Legislature, 20 years after the no-fault act was originally\nadopted, is inconsistent with the overall act’s general purposes. Even assuming arguendo\nthat it could be, I do not believe that broad statements regarding the general purpose of\nthe act’s adoption in 1973 trump the intent expressed by the Legislature in the plain\nlanguage of a later amendment to the act.\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f       To begin with, the court should determine whether there is a factual dispute\n\nregarding the nature and the extent of the person’s injuries, and, if so, whether the dispute\n\nis material to determining whether the serious impairment of body function threshold is\n\nmet. MCL 500.3135(2)(a)(i) and (ii).27 If there is no factual dispute, or no material\n\nfactual dispute, then whether the threshold is met is a question of law for the court. Id.\n\n       If the court may decide the issue as a matter of law, it should next determine\n\nwhether the serious impairment threshold has been crossed. The unambiguous language\n\nof MCL 500.3135(7) provides three prongs that are necessary to establish a “serious\n\nimpairment of body function”: (1) an objectively manifested impairment (observable or\n\nperceivable from actual symptoms or conditions) (2) of an important body function (a\n\nbody function of value, significance, or consequence to the injured person) that (3)\n\naffects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life (influences some of the\n\nplaintiff’s capacity to live in his or her normal manner of living).\n\n       The serious impairment analysis is inherently fact- and circumstance- specific and\n\nmust be conducted on a case-by-case basis. As stated in the Kreiner dissent, “[t]he\n\nLegislature recognized that what is important to one is not important to all[;] a brief\n\nimpairment may be devastating whereas a near permanent impairment may have little\n\n\n       27\n          As discussed in footnotes 7 and 8 of this opinion, this provision may\nunconstitutionally conflict with MCR 2.116(C)(10) in certain cases. If it does, then a\ncourt should only apply MCL 500.3135(2) to the extent that it is consistent with MCR\n2.116(C)(10). We do not reach this issue today, however, because there is no material\nfactual dispute over any fact necessary to determining whether the serious impairment\nthreshold has been met.\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\feffect.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 145 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). As such, the analysis\n\ndoes not “lend itself to any bright-line rule or imposition of [a] nonexhaustive list of\n\nfactors,” particularly where there is no basis in the statute for such factors.          Id.\n\nAccordingly, because “[t]he Legislature avoided drawing lines in the sand . . . so must\n\nwe.” Id.\n\n                          C. APPLICATION OF MCL 500.3135\n\n       Under the facts of this case, we hold that plaintiff has met the serious impairment\n\nthreshold as a matter of law.\n\n       To begin with, there is no factual dispute that is material to determining whether\n\nthe serious impairment threshold is met. The parties do not dispute that plaintiff suffered\n\na broken ankle, was completely restricted from bearing weight on his ankle for a month,\n\nand underwent two surgeries over a 10-month period and multiple months of physical\n\ntherapy. The parties do dispute the extent to which plaintiff continues to suffer a residual\n\nimpairment and the potential for increased susceptibility to degenerative arthritis.\n\nPlaintiff has provided at least some evidence of a physical basis for his subjective\n\ncomplaints of pain and suffering,28 but defendant disputes whether there is persuasive\n\nevidence of impairment beyond plaintiff’s subjective complaints. This dispute is not\n\nsignificant or essential to determining whether the serious impairment threshold is met in\n\nthis case, however, because plaintiff has not alleged that the residual impairment, to the\n\n       28\n         The FCEs report that plaintiff’s range of motion in his ankle is not within\nnormal limits, and the MRI and two doctors’ reports suggest at least some scarring and\ndegenerative tissue damage around plaintiff’s left ankle.\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\fextent that it exists, continues to affect his general ability to lead his pre-incident “normal\n\nlife,”29 the third prong of the analysis. Moreover, it is not necessary to establish the first\n\ntwo prongs. Therefore, the dispute is not material and does not prevent this Court from\n\ndeciding whether the threshold is met as a matter of law under MCL 500.3135(2)(a).\n\n       The other facts material to determining whether the serious impairment threshold\n\nis met are also undisputed.30 Before the incident, plaintiff’s “normal life” consisted\n\nprimarily of working 60 hours a week as a medium truck loader. Plaintiff also frequently\n\nfished in the spring and summer and was a weekend golfer. After the incident, plaintiff\n\nwas unable to return to work for at least 14 months and did not return for 19 months. He\n\nnever returned to his original job as a medium truck loader, but he suffered no loss in pay\n\nbecause of the change in job. He was able to fish at pre-incident levels by the spring of\n\n2006 and is able to take care of his personal needs at the same level as before the\n\nincident. There is no allegation that the impairment of body function has affected his\n\nrelationship with his significant other or other qualitative aspects of his life.\n\n       Next, in light of the lack of a factual dispute that is material to determining\n\nwhether the threshold is met, under MCL 500.3135(2)(a), this Court should decide as a\n\n\n       29\n          Plaintiff stated that his life is “painful, but normal.” He does not allege that any\nresidual impairment has a significant effect on his ability to participate in or enjoy\nactivities to the extent that he could before the accident.\n       30\n         If there had been other disputed facts that were material to this determination,\nwe would have to reach the question whether MCL 500.3135(2)(a) is unconstitutional to\nthe extent that it requires a court to decide material disputed facts as a matter of law. See\nfootnote 7 of this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                              36\n\fmatter of law whether plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function under the\n\nthree prongs in MCL 500.3135(7).\n\n          With regard to the first prong, plaintiff has shown an objectively manifested\n\nimpairment of body function. There is no dispute that plaintiff has presented evidence\n\nthat he suffered a broken ankle and actual symptoms or conditions that someone else\n\nwould perceive as impairing body functions, such as walking, crouching, climbing, and\n\nlifting weight. Even 14 months after the incident, an FCE report observed that ankle pain\n\nand a reduced range of motion inhibited these body functions.           Thus, plaintiff has\n\nsatisfied this prong.\n\n          With regard to the second prong, the impaired body functions were important to\n\nplaintiff. His testimony establishes that being unable to walk and perform other functions\n\nwere of consequence to his ability to work. Thus, the second prong of MCL 500.3135(7)\n\nis met.\n\n          The next question in this case is whether the third prong is met, but we hold that\n\nplaintiff has shown that the impairment affected his general ability to lead his normal life\n\nbecause it influenced some of his capacity to live in his normal, pre-incident manner of\n\nliving. Before the incident, plaintiff’s normal manner of living consisted primarily of\n\nworking, for 60 hours a week, and secondarily his hobbies of fishing and golfing. After\n\nthe incident, at least some of plaintiff’s capacity to live in this manner was affected.\n\nSpecifically, for a month after the incident, plaintiff could not bear weight on his left\n\nankle. He underwent two surgeries over a period of 10 months and multiple months of\n\nphysical therapy. Moreover, his capacity to work, the central part of his pre-incident\n\n\n                                              37\n\f“normal life,” was affected.31 Whereas before the incident he spent most of his time\n\nworking, after the incident he was unable to perform functions necessary for his job for at\n\nleast 14 months, and he did not return to work for 19 months.32 On the basis of these\n\nfacts, we conclude that some of plaintiff’s capacity to live in his pre-incident manner of\n\nliving was affected, and the third prong of MCL 500.3135(7) is satisfied.33\n\n       Because all three prongs of MCL 500.3135(7) are satisfied, we hold, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that plaintiff has met the serious impairment threshold requirement under MCL\n\n500.3135(1).\n\n                             D. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT\n\n       Despite the dissent’s length, it provides very little substantive disagreement or\n\ncriticism of the statutory interpretation presented in this opinion and very little response\n\nto our criticisms of the statutory interpretation in Kreiner. Where the dissent does\n\nactually address the substance of the opinion, its criticisms are often based not on the\n       31\n           As noted, it is unclear from the record the extent to which the impairment\naffected plaintiff’s ability to fish in the first year after the incident or his ability to golf in\nthe first year and a half after the incident, or the extent to which he actually undertook\neither activity in those periods.\n       32\n        It could be significant that plaintiff’s job has changed, even though his pay is the\nsame, but there is no evidence suggesting that this was an effect of impairment.\nTherefore, this fact is not relevant to the “normal life” inquiry here.\n       33\n           Our analysis focuses on plaintiff’s pre- and post-incident activities and the\nextent to which he was able to participate in them after the incident because those are the\nfacts in the record. The facts that the parties considered relevant in developing the record\nwere, no doubt, influenced by the Kreiner majority’s erroneous deviation from the\nstatutory language. As noted, however, many other considerations could typically be\nrelevant to determining how an impairment affects a person’s ability to live in his or her\npre-incident normal manner of living.\n\n\n\n                                                38\n\factual holdings of the majority opinion but, instead, on the dissent’s misunderstandings\n\nor overgeneralizations of those holdings.\n\n       For example, the dissent complains that the majority “resuscitate[s]” my opinion\n\nin DiFranco.34 As a result, the dissent resuscitates old criticisms of DiFranco and attacks\n\nthe majority for failing to recognize the Legislature’s intent, as expressed in the statute’s\n\nlegislative history, to reject DiFranco in favor of Cassidy.35 As is plainly evident in the\n\nanalysis, however, this opinion faithfully applies the text of the statute, even where that\n\ntext is inconsistent with DiFranco.        The opinion fully recognizes the Legislature’s\n\nadoption of Cassidy where the Legislature indicated an intent to do so through the text of\n\nthe statute and “resuscitates” DiFranco only in the narrow places where, similarly, the\n\nstatutory text indicates a legislative intent to do so.36\n\n       Additionally, the dissent’s comments on the majority’s lack of use of legislative\n\nhistory are ill-founded on two levels. First, contrary to the dissent’s assertion that I have\n\n\n       34\n           The only explanation that I can discover for the dissent’s reaching this\nconclusion is its baseless accusation that the majority is essentially reading the third\nprong out of the statute. It is unclear to me, however, how reading and applying the plain\ntext of the statute, instead of enhancing and extending the statute through creative use of\na thesaurus and extra-textual factors, could equate to reading that language out of the\nstatute.\n       35\n          Interestingly, while criticizing the majority for supposedly reviving DiFranco,\nthe dissent also criticizes us for not going far enough in its revival by not adopting the\nfactors that I used in DiFranco.\n       36\n           It appears that the dissent itself does not actually believe that we are\nresuscitating DiFranco, given that it so vigorously, albeit erroneously, argues that the\nonly difference between our decision today and Kreiner is that Kreiner adopted temporal\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\f“never questioned the utility of legislative history” and that “there is no principled\n\nreason” not to use it in this case, I have repeatedly stated that legislative history should\n\nonly be used to interpret a statute when statutory language is ambiguous. See, e.g.,\n\nPeople v Gardner, 482 Mich 41; 753 NW2d 78 (2008) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting);\n\nBukowski v Detroit, 478 Mich 268; 732 NW2d 75 (2007) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring);\n\nLansing Mayor v Pub Service Comm, 470 Mich 154, 174; 680 NW2d 840 (2004)\n\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).37 The statutory language at issue here is not ambiguous.38\n\nSecond, even if legislative history should be used, our application of the plain language\n\n\n       37\n          To the extent the dissent insinuates that I have relied on legislative history to\ninterpret an unambiguous statute, it is reaching. None of the cases that the dissent cites\ninvolves instances where I relied on legislative history to identify an ambiguity or give\nunambiguous text a meaning inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. In most,\nI merely emphasized that the legislative history confirmed the meaning in the\nunambiguous text. See, e.g., Jackson v Green Estate, 484 Mich 209, 230; 771 NW2d 675\n(2009) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); Koester v City of Novi, 458 Mich 1, 16; 580 NW2d\n835 (1998); People v Sloan, 450 Mich 160, 183-184; 538 NW2d 380 (1995); Grand\nTrunk Western R Co v Fenton, 439 Mich 240, 247; 482 NW2d 706 (1992).\n       38\n          The dissent references Judge Leventhal’s remark that using legislative history\nfor statutory interpretation is the equivalent of walking into a crowded room and looking\nfor one’s friends. Similar to my approach, however, this analogy has been used by\njustices of the United States Supreme Court to explain why legislative history should not\nbe used to interpret clear and unambiguous statutory language. See Exxon Mobil Corp v\nAllapattah Servs, Inc, 545 US 546, 568-570; 125 S Ct 2611; 162 L Ed 2d 502 (2005),\nusing the criticism to explain that legislative history should not be used to determine\nwhether Congress intended an otherwise unambiguous statute to overrule a court’s\ninterpretation of an earlier version of the statute because “[e]xtrinsic materials have a role\nin statutory interpretation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting\nLegislature’s understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms.” See also Conroy v Aniskoff,\n507 US 511, 518-519; 113 S Ct 1562; 123 L Ed 2d 229 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring)\n(using the criticism to explain why the majority should have stopped its analysis after\nconcluding that a statute was unambiguous).\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\fof the statute is consistent with the House legislative analysis’s statement that the\n\namendments were intended to return the law to a threshold “resembling” Cassidy. House\n\nLegislative Analysis, HB 4341, December 18, 1995. The dissent’s statements to the\n\ncontrary are, again, largely based on its mistaken characterization of the majority opinion\n\nas resuscitating DiFranco and ignoring Cassidy.\n\n       The dissent also repeatedly states that the majority opinion holds that temporal\n\nconsiderations are “wholly or largely irrelevant” to the serious impairment threshold, and,\n\naccordingly, it spends a significant amount of energy explaining why temporal\n\nconsiderations are relevant and accusing the majority of holding that the threshold is met\n\nif “the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life has been affected for even a single\n\nmoment in time.” Contrary to the dissent’s cries, there is simply no basis in our analysis\n\nfor concluding that we hold that temporal considerations are irrelevant or that a\n\nmomentary impairment is sufficient. The opinion merely notes that there is no specific\n\nexpress temporal requirement in the text of the statute and rejects Kreiner’s strained\n\nattempts to insert what was essentially a permanency requirement into the statute.39 The\n\ndissent’s mistaken characterizations of this opinion amount to nothing more than, like\n\nKreiner itself, yet another attempt to distract courts and parties from the actual text of\n\nMCL 500.3135.\n\n       39\n          Indeed, the dissent is so blindly intent on concluding that the majority must be\nrejecting temporal considerations that it fails to consider that its triumphant discovery of\nthe majority’s “hypocrisy” in referencing time periods in our application of MCL\n500.3135(2) is nothing more than a reflection of the fact that we are not holding that\ntemporal considerations are irrelevant.\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f                                  IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       We hold that Kreiner should be overruled because the Kreiner majority’s\n\ninterpretation of MCL 500.3135 departed from the statute’s clear and unambiguous text.\n\nApplying the unambiguous statutory language, we hold that as a question of law, in this\n\ncase, plaintiff established that he suffered a serious impairment of body function. Thus,\n\nwe reverse the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the trial court for proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n              KELLY, C.J., and WEAVER (except for the part entitled “Stare Decisis”),\n\nand HATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                           42\n\f                           STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                    SUPREME COURT\n\n\nRODNEY MCCORMICK,\n\n             Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv                                                         No. 136738\n\nLARRY CARRIER,\n\n             Defendant,\n\nand\n\nALLIED AUTOMOTIVE GROUP, INC.,\nindemnitor of GENERAL MOTORS\nCORPORATION,\n\n             Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nWEAVER, J. (concurring).\n\n      I concur in and sign all of the majority opinion except part III(B)(3), regarding\n\nstare decisis. I fully support the decision to overrule Kreiner v Fischer, 471 Mich 109;\n\n683 NW2d 611 (2004). As I wrote in Jones v Olson, 480 Mich 1169, 1173 (2008):\n\n             By importing the concept of permanency of injury into MCL\n      500.3135—a concept that is nowhere referenced in the text of the statute—\n      the majority of four (Chief Justice TAYLOR and Justices CORRIGAN,\n      YOUNG, and MARKMAN), in Kreiner v Fischer, 471 Mich 109 (2004),\n      actively and judicially legislated a permanency and temporal requirement to\n      recover noneconomic damages in automobile accident cases. The Kreiner\n      interpretation of MCL 500.3135 is an unrestrained misuse and abuse of the\n      power of interpretation masquerading as an exercise in following the\n      Legislature’s intent.\n\f       With regard to the policy of stare decisis, my view is that past precedent should\n\ngenerally be followed but that to serve the rule of law, in deciding whether wrongly\n\ndecided precedent should be overruled, each case should be looked at individually on its\n\nfacts and merits through the lens of judicial restraint, common sense, and fairness. I\n\nagree with the sentiment recently expressed by Chief Justice Roberts of the United States\n\nSupreme Court in his concurrence to the decision in Citizens United v Fed Election\n\nComm, 558 US ___, ___; 130 S Ct 876, 920; 175 L Ed 2d 753, 806 (2010), when he said\n\nthat\n\n\n       stare decisis is neither an “inexorable command,” Lawrence v. Texas, 539\n       U.S. 558, 577, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003), nor “a\n       mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,” Helvering v.\n       Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 119, 60 S. Ct. 444, 84 L. Ed. 604 (1940) . . . . If it\n       were, segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be\n       unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal\n       suspects without first obtaining warrants. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S.\n       537, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 41 L. Ed. 256 (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board of\n       Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954); Adkins v.\n       Children's Hospital of D. C., 261 U.S. 525, 43 S. Ct. 394, 67 L. Ed. 785\n       (1923), overruled by West Coast Hotel Co v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 57 S.\n       Ct. 578, 81 L. Ed. 703 (1937); Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 48\n       S. Ct. 564, 72 L. Ed. 944 (1928), overruled by Katz v. United States, 389\n       U.S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967).\n\nChief Justice Roberts further called stare decisis a “principle of policy” and said that it “is\n\nnot an end in itself.” Id. at ___; 130 S Ct at 920; 175 L Ed 2d at 807. He explained that\n\n“[i]ts greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule of law. It follows that in\n\nthe unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fthis constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that\n\nprecedent.” Id at ___; 130 S Ct at 921; 175 L Ed 2d at 807.1\n\n       I agree with Chief Justice Roberts that stare decisis is a policy and not an\n\nimmutable doctrine. I chose not to sign Chief Justice KELLY’s lead opinion in Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 316-320; 773 NW2d 564 (2009), because it proposed to\n\ncreate a standardized test for stare decisis. Likewise, I do not sign the majority opinion’s\n\nstare decisis section in this case because it applies Petersen. There is no need for this\n\nCourt to adopt any standardized test regarding stare decisis. In fact, it is an impossible\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          It appears that the dissent in this case does not agree with Chief Justice Roberts.\nThe dissent lists 12 cases that have been overruled by this Court in the past 18 months.\nWhile the dissenting justices may feel aggrieved by this Court overruling those 12 cases,\namongst those cases were some of the most egregious examples of judicial activism that\ndid great harm to the people of Michigan. Those decisions were made by the “majority\nof four,” including the dissenting justices, under the guise of ideologies such as\n“textualism” and “judicial traditionalism.” One of the dissenting justices, Justice YOUNG,\nexpressed his apparent contempt for the common law and common sense in his 2004\narticle in the Texas Review of Law and Politics, where Justice YOUNG stated:\n\n             Consequently, I want to focus my remarks here on the\n       embarrassment that the common law presents—or ought to present—to a\n       conscientious judicial traditionalist. . . .\n\n              To give a graphic illustration of my feelings on the subject, I tend to\n       think of the common law as a drunken, toothless ancient relative, sprawled\n       prominently and in a state of nature on a settee in the middle of one’s\n       genteel garden party. Grandpa’s presence is undoubtedly a cause of\n       mortification to the host. But since only the most ill-bred of guests would\n       be coarse enough to comment on Grandpa’s presence and condition, all\n       concerned simply try ignore him. [Young, A judicial traditionalist\n       confronts the common law, 8 Texas Rev L & Pol 299, 301-302 (2004).]\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\ftask. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether or not to overrule\n\nprecedent, and the importance of such factors often changes on a case-by-case basis.2\n\n       In the end, the consideration of stare decisis and whether to overrule wrongly\n\ndecided precedent always includes service to the rule of law through an application and\n\nexercise of judicial restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness—justice for all.\n\n       In serving the rule of law and applying judicial restraint, common sense, and a\n\nsense of fairness to the case at hand, I agree with and join the majority opinion’s holding\n\nthat Kreiner is overruled.\n\n\n                                                        Elizabeth A. Weaver\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          Over the past decade, the principal tool used by this Court to decide when a\nprecedent should be overruled is the set of guidelines that was laid out in Robinson v\nDetroit, 462 Mich 439, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), an opinion written by former Justice\nTAYLOR, signed by Justices CORRIGAN, YOUNG, MARKMAN and myself, and that I have\nused numerous times. By no means do I consider the Robinson guidelines a “be-all, end-\nall test” that constitutes precedent of this Court to be used whenever this Court considers\noverruling precedent. I view Robinson as merely providing guidelines to assist this Court\nin its legal analysis when pertinent.\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f                                                                        1/Jan 10—DMH\n\n                           STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\n                                    SUPREME COURT\n\n\nRODNEY MCCORMICK,\n\n             Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\nv                                                          No. 136738\n\nLARRY CARRIER,\n\n             Defendant,\n\nand\n\nALLIED AUTOMOTIVE GROUP, INC,\nindemnitor of GENERAL MOTORS\nCORPORATION,\n\n           Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\nHATHAWAY, J.

I write\n\nseparately to express my thoughts on the doctrine of stare decisis. Any analysis of the\n\nimpact of stare decisis must focus on the individual case and the reason for overruling\n\nprecedent.1 The reasons for overruling Kreiner are paramount to any articulated test, and\n\nthe special and compelling justifications to do so are overwhelming in this case.

(dissenting).\n\n      I respectfully dissent from the majority’s decision to overrule Kreiner v Fischer,\n\n471 Mich 109; 683 NW2d 611 (2004). The no-fault automobile insurance act, MCL\n\n500.3135(1), provides that “[a] person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic\n\nloss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the\n\ninjured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent\n\nserious disfigurement.”   The issue here is whether plaintiff has suffered a serious\n\nimpairment of body function.        “‘[S]erious impairment of body function’ means an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” MCL 500.3135(7).\n\f       In Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132-133, this Court held that in determining whether an\n\nimpairment affects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life, “a court should\n\nengage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiff’s life before and after the\n\naccident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiff’s\n\noverall life.” In addition, Kreiner indicated that certain factors, such as the duration of\n\nthe impairment, may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiff’s general ability\n\nto lead his normal life has been affected. Id. at 133.\n\n       The majority overrules Kreiner, rejecting these factors and holding that temporal\n\nconsiderations are wholly or largely irrelevant in determining whether an impairment\n\naffects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life. The majority instead holds\n\nthat, as long as the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life has been affected,\n\napparently for even a single moment in time, the plaintiff has suffered a “serious\n\nimpairment of body function.” This conclusion is at odds with the actual language of the\n\nno-fault automobile act and nullifies the legislative compromise embodied in that act. I\n\ncontinue to believe that Kreiner was correctly decided, and that temporal considerations\n\nare highly relevant-- indeed necessary-- in determining whether an impairment affects the\n\nplaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life.        By nullifying the legislative\n\ncompromise, which was grounded in concerns over excessive litigation, the over-\n\ncompensation of minor injuries, and the availability of affordable insurance, the Court’s\n\ndecision today will resurrect a legal environment in which each of these hazards reappear\n\nand threaten the continued fiscal integrity of our no-fault system.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       Because I do not believe that the lower courts erred in concluding that plaintiff in\n\nthis case has not suffered a serious impairment of body function, I would affirm the\n\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                    I. FACTS AND HISTORY\n\n       Because the majority opinion provides only a cursory presentation of the facts, in a\n\ncase requiring a fact-intensive analysis, I find it necessary to set forth a more thorough\n\ndiscussion of these facts. Beginning in August of 2002, plaintiff was employed by Allied\n\nSystems, and over the years, he has held various positions with the company.1 On\n\nJanuary 17, 2005, approximately six months after beginning his position as a medium\n\ntruck loader, plaintiff was struck by a truck driven by plaintiff’s co-worker and co-\n\ndefendant, Larry Carrier, while shuttling vehicles at a General Motors plant. Plaintiff\n\nwas knocked down, and the wheels of the truck ran over his left ankle, fracturing his\n\nmedial malleolus. Plaintiff was immediately taken to the hospital and was released that\n\nsame day. Two days later, he underwent surgery for the implantation of a device to\n\nstabilize his ankle fracture. Immediately following surgery, plaintiff was on crutches and\n\nin a boot for approximately four weeks and, during this time, he was restricted from\n\nbearing weight on his left leg. Additionally, plaintiff underwent physical therapy.2\n\n\n       1\n          Before plaintiff began working for Allied, he installed windows. When he first\nbegan working for Allied, he loaded trains, and after approximately six months, he took a\n“utility job,” providing support to other departments as needed. In June of 2004, he\nbegan working as a medium truck loader.\n       2\n         It is not altogether clear how long plaintiff’s physical therapy actually lasted. In\nplaintiff’s deposition, he indicated that he underwent “many months” of therapy.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f      On October 21, 2005, plaintiff again underwent surgery on his ankle, this time to\n\nremove the implanted device. The surgeon reported that plaintiff’s ankle had “healed\n\nnicely.” On November 5, 2005, at the request of Allied, plaintiff was examined by Dr.\n\nPaul Drouillard, who stated that plaintiff could return to work with restrictions of no\n\nprolonged standing or walking for three weeks, after which time, plaintiff could return to\n\nwork with no restrictions.    On November 17, 2005, plaintiff was examined by his\n\nsurgeon, who observed that plaintiff’s “wound is healed very nicely” and that plaintiff\n\n“needs to be in seated work for approximately six weeks.”\n\n      On January 12, 2006, plaintiff’s surgeon examined him and cleared him to return\n\nto work with no restrictions. At this examination, plaintiff reported to his surgeon that\n\n“[h]is medial malleolus is not giving him any pain.” The surgeon observed that plaintiff\n\nhad an “excellent range of motion with no specific tenderness.” Upon returning to work\n\nfor several days, however, plaintiff indicated that performing the physical tasks that his\n\njob required, such as walking, climbing, and crouching, caused his ankle to hurt. After\n\nplaintiff’s request for a different assignment was denied, plaintiff went back on workers’\n\ncompensation.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in his response to defendant’s motion for summary disposition, plaintiff\nindicated that he had six weeks of therapy. And, during plaintiff’s oral argument\nopposing defendant’s motion for summary disposition, plaintiff’s counsel claimed that\nplaintiff underwent 18 weeks of therapy.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f       On March 16, 2006, Allied required plaintiff to undergo a functional capacity\n\nevaluation (FCE),3 which showed that plaintiff could not fully perform all of his previous\n\njob duties.4 During this evaluation, when asked what his goal was in returning to work,\n\nplaintiff responded, “I don’t want to go back to work; there is talk about a buyout and I\n\nthink I want to do that.” Plaintiff also reported that his ankle pain was a three on a scale\n\nof zero to ten, with ten being the highest.\n\n       On May 31, 2006, Dr. Drouillard again examined plaintiff, at the request of Allied.\n\nDr. Drouillard found no objective abnormality to correspond to plaintiff’s complaints and\n\nopined that plaintiff was magnifying his symptoms. Dr. Drouillard also observed that,\n\nalthough plaintiff claimed that he had been wearing an ankle brace for the last two weeks,\n\nthe tan lines on plaintiff’s left and right feet were symmetrical, consistent with wearing\n\nflip-flops, with no break in his tan lines to indicate that he had been wearing the brace at\n\nall. Dr. Drouillard believed that plaintiff could return to work unrestricted and that\n\nplaintiff’s ankle required no further treatment.\n\n       On June 12, 2006, plaintiff underwent an MRI test; the physiatrist who reviewed\n\nthe MRI and performed a follow-up examination found that there was some evidence of\n\nligamentous injury, but he did not establish a plan to decrease plaintiff’s pain because\n\n       3\n         An FCE is “an all-encompassing term to describe the physical assessment of an\nindividual’s ability to perform work-related activity.” American Occupational Therapy\nAssociation, <http://ww.aota.org/Consumers/WhatisOT/WI/Facts/35117.aspx> (accessed\nJuly 1, 2010).\n       4\n        This was due in part to shoulder pain resulting from a preexisting and unrelated\nshoulder injury.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fthere was little the physiatrist could do.5 At this examination, plaintiff reported that his\n\npain was a six on a scale of zero to ten, that the pain was worse with “any movement,”\n\nand that nothing alleviates that pain. On June 20, 2006, Dr. Drouillard reviewed the MRI\n\nresults and found that plaintiff’s ankle had healed well and that his opinion from May 31,\n\n2006 had not changed.\n\n       Shortly thereafter, plaintiff’s workers’ compensation benefits were terminated.6\n\nAt this point, plaintiff sought another FCE so that he could return to work. On August 1,\n\n2006, the FCE indicated that plaintiff was able to perform essential job demands without\n\nrestriction. At this FCE, plaintiff reported that he experienced “occasional aching” in his\n\nankle, and that there were no “activities that aggravated his symptoms in the left ankle\n\n(including prolonged standing, prolonged walking).” Plaintiff reported that his pain level\n\nwas a two on a scale of zero to ten and, during the two weeks immediately preceding the\n\nFCE, his highest pain level had been a three and his lowest pain level had been a one. By\n\nthe completion of the FCE, plaintiff reported his pain level at zero. On August 16, 2006,\n\napproximately 17 months after the accident, plaintiff returned to work and Allied\n\n       5\n         A physiatrist is a medical doctor who practices physiatry, “a medical specialty\nfor the treatment of disease and injury by physical agents, as exercise or heat therapy.”\nRandom House Webster’s College Dictionary (1991).\n       6\n         Plaintiff began receiving workers’ compensation in January 2005. Plaintiff\nclaims that he lost $66,000 in wages, the difference between his salary and his workers’\ncompensation benefits for the time he was not working. However, the instant case only\ninvolves noneconomic damages.          Lost wages are economic damages and are\ncompensable as personal protection insurance benefits, MCL 500.3107(1)(b), and/or\nthrough a tort claim against the party at fault to recover excess economic losses, MCL\n500.3135(3)(c).\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fassigned him to a new job with different physical requirements, and with no reduction in\n\npay. Plaintiff volunteered to be assigned to this other job, and has been able to perform\n\nhis new job duties since that time.\n\n       During his recuperation, plaintiff did not require any assistance with normal\n\nhousehold tasks. Additionally, he was able to drive and his injuries have not affected his\n\nrelationship with his wife in any way.7 Outside of work, plaintiff was able to engage in\n\nmost of the activities in which he was engaged before his injury, such as fishing.8\n\nImportantly, by plaintiff’s own admission at his deposition in October of 2006, his life\n\nwas “normal” despite some “occasional aching.”\n\n       On March 24, 2006, plaintiff filed a third-party action against Carrier (the driver\n\nof the truck) and General Motors Corporation (GM).9 Carrier was later released by\n\n\n       7\n           Plaintiff’s wife has not brought a loss-of-consortium claim.\n       8\n          Although the majority suggests that plaintiff returned to fishing at pre-injury\nlevels by the spring and summer of 2006, the record indicates that plaintiff’s fishing\nactivities had never been interrupted. Plaintiff was asked if he “[s]till fish[ed] the same\namount of time as [he] fished before the accident when [he] get[s] a chance,” to which\nplaintiff replied, “When I get a chance.” Furthermore, defendant argued in its motion for\nsummary disposition that plaintiff’s fishing activities were uninterrupted by the injury,\nand plaintiff did not dispute this. Plaintiff essentially conceded this fact and instead\nargued that the disruption in his life as a result of his injuries was centered on his inability\nto work. Plaintiff also was a weekend golfer. The record reflects that since plaintiff\nreturned to work in August 2006, he had only golfed once, using a golf cart. We do not\nknow whether plaintiff was able to golf during the time between his accident in January\n2005 and August 2006. Defendant argued in its motion for summary disposition that\nplaintiff continued to engage in his pre-accident level of golfing activity, and again\nplaintiff did not argue to the contrary.\n       9\n         With GM’s bankruptcy, the parties stipulated to a change in case caption and\nparty, adding Allied Automotive Group, Inc., indemnitor of GM; plaintiff’s employer,\n\n\n                                               7\n\fstipulation of the parties, and the trial court granted GM’s motion for summary\n\ndisposition, finding that plaintiff had undergone a relatively good recovery and could not\n\nmeet the “serious impairment of body function” threshold.\n\n       The Court of Appeals affirmed, with one judge dissenting, concluding that the\n\nimpairment did not affect plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life. McCormick v\n\nCarrier, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 25, 2008\n\n(Docket No. 275888). The majority cited various facts to support its conclusion, such as\n\nplaintiff’s golfing, fishing, driving, caring for himself, and returning to work without\n\nrestriction. The dissent would have reversed for two reasons: first, on the basis that\n\nplaintiff’s entire life, including the possibility of future problems, must be considered;\n\nand, second, on the basis that there was evidence to indicate that plaintiff’s life was not\n\ncurrently normal. The evidence that the dissent relied on to reach this conclusion was\n\nthat plaintiff was assigned to a job with reduced physical requirements and the doctors\n\nhad identified “some indication of degenerative joint disease in [plaintiff’s] ankle.” Id.,\n\nunpub op at 2 (DAVIS, J., dissenting).\n\n       On October 22, 2008, this Court denied plaintiff’s application for leave to appeal,\n\nalthough Chief Justice KELLY and Justices CAVANAGH and WEAVER would have granted\n\nleave to appeal. 482 Mich 1018 (2008). However, after the composition of this Court\n\nchanged when Justice HATHAWAY replaced former Chief Justice TAYLOR on January 1,\n\n\n\n\nAllied Systems, is a subsidiary of Allied Automotive Group, Inc. This Court entered an\norder in accordance with this stipulation. 485 Mich 851 (2009).\n\n\n                                            8\n\f2009, this Court granted plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration, even though such motion\n\nhad not raised any new legal arguments. 485 Mich 851 (2009).\n\n                            II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      This case presents issues of statutory interpretation, which this Court reviews de\n\nnovo. Dep’t of Transp v Tompkins, 481 Mich 184, 190; 749 NW2d 716 (2008).

ANALYSIS\n\n                  A. HISTORY OF NO-FAULT INSURANCE ACT\n\n      In Michigan, before the enactment of the no-fault insurance act, the only available\n\nrecourse to victims of motor vehicle accidents seeking to recover damages was to file a\n\ncommon-law tort action.      “[U]nder [this] tort liability system[,] the doctrine of\n\ncontributory negligence denied benefits to a high percentage of motor vehicle accident\n\nvictims, minor injuries were overcompensated, serious injuries were undercompensated,\n\nlong payment delays were commonplace, the court system was overburdened, and those\n\nwith low income and little education suffered discrimination.”      Shavers v Attorney\n\nGeneral, 402 Mich 554, 579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). In response to these deficiencies, the\n\nLegislature enacted the no-fault automobile insurance act, MCL 500.3101 et seq.,\n\neffective March 30, 1973. The primary goal of the no-fault act is “to provide victims of\n\nmotor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic\n\nlosses.” Shavers, 402 Mich at 579. In order to meet this objective, the Legislature\n\ndecided to make no-fault insurance compulsory, i.e., “whereby every Michigan motorist\n\n\n                                           9\n\fwould be required to purchase no-fault insurance or be unable to operate a motor vehicle\n\nlegally in this state.” Id. In addition, “[i]n exchange for the payment of . . . no-fault\n\neconomic loss benefits from one’s own insurance company, the Legislature limited an\n\ninjured person’s ability to sue a negligent operator or owner of a motor vehicle for bodily\n\ninjuries.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 115. That is, with the enactment of the no-fault act, “the\n\nLegislature abolished tort liability generally in motor vehicle accident cases and replaced\n\nit with a regime that established that a person injured in such an accident is entitled to\n\ncertain economic compensation from his own insurance company regardless of fault.” Id.\n\nat 114.10 In exchange for economic loss benefits regardless of fault, “the Legislature\n\nsignificantly limited the injured person’s ability to sue a third party for noneconomic\n\ndamages, e.g., pain and suffering.” Id. at 115. More specifically, no tort suit against a\n\nthird party for noneconomic damages is permitted unless the injured person “has suffered\n\ndeath, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.” MCL\n\n500.3135(1).11\n\n       10\n           The injured person’s insurance company is responsible for all expenses incurred\nfor medical care, recovery, and rehabilitation as long as the service, product, or\naccommodation is reasonably necessary and the charge is reasonable.                   MCL\n500.3107(1)(a). There is no monetary limit on such expenses, and this entitlement can\nlast for the person’s lifetime. An injured person is also entitled to recover from his own\ninsurance company up to three years of earnings loss, i.e., loss of income from work that\nthe person would have performed if he had not been injured. MCL 500.3107(1)(b). An\ninjured person can also recover “replacement” expenses, i.e., expenses reasonably\nincurred in obtaining ordinary and necessary services that the injured person would\notherwise have performed. MCL 500.3107(1)(c). Further, an at-fault driver is still liable\nin tort for an injured person’s excess economic damages. MCL 500.3135(3)(c).\n       11\n            In its entirety, MCL 500.3135(1) provides:\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       The Legislature did not initially define the language that is in dispute in this case--\n\n“serious impairment of body function”-- and this Court itself struggled in the process of\n\ngiving reasonable meaning to this language. In Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of\n\n1972 PA 294, 389 Mich 441, 481; 208 NW2d 469 (1973), we held that whether the\n\nplaintiff has suffered a “serious impairment of body function” is “within the province of\n\nthe trier of fact . . . .” However, in Cassidy v McGovern, 415 Mich 483; 330 NW2d 22\n\n(1982), noting that an advisory opinion “‘is not precedentially binding in the same sense\n\nas a decision of the Court after a hearing on the merits,’” id. at 495 (citation omitted), this\n\nCourt held:\n\n              [W]hen there is no factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of\n       a plaintiff’s injuries, the question of serious impairment of body function\n       shall be decided as a matter of law by the court. Likewise, if there is a\n       factual dispute as to the nature and extent of a plaintiff’s injuries, but the\n       dispute is not material to the determination whether plaintiff has suffered a\n       serious impairment of body function, the court shall rule as a matter of law\n       whether the threshold requirement . . . has been met. [Id. at 502.]\n\nIn addition, Cassidy held that the phrase “serious impairment of body function” refers to\n\n“objectively manifested injuries” that impair “important body functions.” Id. at 504-505.\n\nCassidy also held that “the Legislature intended an objective standard that looks to the\n\neffect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal life.” Id. at 505.\n\nFinally, Cassidy held that although “an injury need not be permanent to be serious,”\n\n\n\n              A person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss\n       caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle\n       only if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body\n       function, or permanent serious disfigurement.\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f“[p]ermanency is, nevertheless, relevant” because “[t]wo injuries identical except that\n\none is permanent do differ in seriousness.” Id. at 505-506.\n\n       However, only four years later, in DiFranco v Pickard, 427 Mich 32; 398 NW2d\n\n896 (1986), this Court overruled Cassidy. DiFranco held that “[i]f reasonable minds can\n\ndiffer as to whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function, the issue\n\nmust be submitted to the jury, even if the evidentiary facts are undisputed. Id. at 58. In\n\naddition, DiFranco held that the “impairment need not be of . . . an important body\n\nfunction,” and it is unnecessary to look to the effect of the injury on the person’s\n\n“‘general ability to live a normal life.’” Id. at 39. DiFranco also held that, although the\n\nplaintiff must prove a “medically identifiable injury,” this can be done on the basis of\n\n“the plaintiff’s subjective complaints or the symptoms of an injury.” Id. at 75. Finally,\n\nDiFranco held that the following factors should be considered when determining whether\n\nthe impairment was serious:\n\n       The extent of the impairment, the particular body function impaired, the\n       length of time the impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the\n       impairment, and any other relevant factors. [Id. at 69-70.]\n\n       In 1995, the Legislature amended the no-fault act. In particular, it amended MCL\n\n500.3135(2)(a), which provides:\n\n              The issues of whether an injured person has suffered serious\n       impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement are\n       questions of law for the court if the court finds either of the following:\n\n              (i) There is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of\n       the person’s injuries.\n\n             (ii) There is a factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the\n       person’s injuries, but the dispute is not material to the determination as to\n\n\n                                            12\n\f       whether the person has suffered a serious impairment of body function or\n       permanent serious disfigurement.\n\nIn addition, the Legislature defined “serious impairment of body function” to mean “an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” MCL 500.3135(7). In other words, the\n\nLegislature essentially rejected DiFranco and, with one exception, codified Cassidy.12\n\n                                 B. KREINER V FISCHER\n\n       In Kreiner, this Court for the first time interpreted the Legislature’s definition of\n\n“serious impairment of body function.” Because “generally” means “‘for the most part,’”\n\nKreiner held that “determining whether a plaintiff is ‘generally able’ to lead his normal\n\nlife requires considering whether the plaintiff is, ‘for the most part’ able to lead his\n\nnormal life.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 130, quoting Random House Webster’s College\n\nDictionary (1991).     In addition, because “lead” means “‘to conduct or bring in a\n\nparticular course,’” Kreiner held that “the effect of the impairment on the course of a\n\nplaintiff’s entire normal life must be considered.” Id. at 130-131, quoting Random House\n\nWebster’s Unabridged Dictionary (2001). Therefore, Kreiner concluded, “[a]lthough\n\nsome aspects of a plaintiff’s entire normal life may be interrupted by the impairment, if,\n\ndespite those impingements, the course or trajectory of the plaintiff’s normal life has not\n\n       12\n          That one exception is that while Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505, required an\nevaluation of “the effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal life,”\nMCL 500.3135(7) requires an evaluation of the effect of an injury on “the person’s\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” (Emphasis added.) That is, while the\nCassidy test was exclusively objective, the MCL 500.3135(7) test is at least partially\nsubjective.\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fbeen affected, then the plaintiff's ‘general ability’ to lead his normal life has not been\n\naffected and he does not meet the ‘serious impairment of body function’ threshold.” Id.\n\nat 131.\n\n          Kreiner established a “multi-step process . . . for separating out those plaintiffs\n\nwho meet the statutory threshold from those who do not.” Id. First, the court must\n\ndetermine whether there is a factual dispute that is material to the determination whether\n\nthe person has suffered a serious impairment of body function.13 Second, the court must\n\ndetermine whether an important body function has been impaired. Third, the court must\n\ndetermine whether the impairment is objectively manifested.14 Finally, the court must\n\ndetermine whether the impairment affects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life. “In determining whether the course of the plaintiff’s normal life has been\n\naffected, a court should engage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiff’s life\n\nbefore and after the accident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the\n\ncourse of the plaintiff’s overall life.” Id. at 132-133. Kreiner indicated that the following\n\nfactors may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiff’s general ability to\n\nconduct the course of his normal life has been affected:\n\n\n\n\n          13\n        If there is such a dispute, the court cannot decide the issue as a matter of law;\nhowever, if there is no such dispute, the court can so decide.\n          14\n               “Subjective complaints that are not medically documented are insufficient.” Id.\nat 132.\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f              (a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length\n      of treatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment,[15] (d) the extent\n      of any residual impairment,[16] and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery.\n      [Id. at 133.]\n\nAlthough the dissent in Kreiner essentially agreed with the majority’s analysis of the\n\nlanguage “an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function,” it\n\ndisagreed with the majority’s analysis of the language “that affects the person’s general\n\nability to lead his or her normal life.” Most significantly in this regard, the dissent\n\nrejected the factors set forth by the majority on the basis that “time or temporal\n\nconsiderations” are inappropriate considerations. Id. at 147 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\n\n                             C. MAJORITY’S NEW TEST\n\n      It is appropriate that Justice CAVANAGH, the authoring justice of the majority\n\nopinion in DiFranco, which was rejected by the Legislature, and also the authoring\n\njustice of the dissent in Kreiner, which was rejected by this Court, is now the authoring\n\njustice of the majority opinion, in which Kreiner is overruled. While to some, there may\n\nbe a sense of justice, or at least a sense of irony, in this sequence of events, to others,\n\nincluding those of us in dissent in this case, such sequence embodies all that is wrong\n\nwhen a judiciary confuses its own preferences with those of the people’s representatives\n\nin the Legislature. While it is intriguing that Justice CAVANAGH now is able to transform\n\nhis dissent in Kreiner into a majority opinion, and thereby resuscitate his earlier opinion\n      15\n          “While an injury need not be permanent, it must be of sufficient duration to\naffect the course of a plaintiff’s life.” Id. at 135.\n      16\n          “Self-imposed restrictions, as opposed to physician-imposed restrictions, based\non real or perceived pain do not establish this point.” Id. at 133 n 17.\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fin DiFranco, this has been achieved only after the people of this state, through their\n\nLegislature, have made clear that DiFranco did not reflect what ought to be the policy of\n\nthis state. Therefore, just as he did in his dissent in Kreiner, Justice CAVANAGH, now\n\nwith majority support, rejects Kreiner’s analysis of the language “that affects the person’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” The worm has turned, and never mind\n\nwhat the people and their Legislature have sought to accomplish in establishing as the\n\nlaw.\n\n       Before proceeding too far into where our substantive disagreements lie, I would be\n\nremiss not to point out where we are in agreement. First, the majority, just as did the\n\nKreiner dissent, largely agrees with Kreiner’s analysis of MCL 500.3135(2)(a), i.e., if\n\nthere is no material factual dispute, whether a person has suffered a serious impairment of\n\nbody function should be determined by the court as a matter of law.17 The majority also\n\n\n\n       17\n           However, the majority indicates that this statute “could unconstitutionally\nconflict with MCR 2.116(C)(10) . . . .” Because I see no conflict between the statute and\nthe court rule, i.e., each allows the court to determine as a matter of law whether a person\nhas suffered a serious impairment of body function only if there are no material factual\ndisputes, I do not believe the statute is in any way unconstitutional. Moreover, the case\ncited by the majority in support of its suggestion that jury trials “promote judicial\nefficiency” actually stands for the exact opposite proposition. See Moll v Abbott\nLaboratories, 444 Mich 1, 26; 506 NW2d 816 (1993) (“Both our court rules and case law\nrecognize the desirability of allowing summary disposition, regardless of a jury request,\nwhen uncontroverted facts are presented to the court. This promotes efficiency and\npreservation of judicial resources.”). It is interesting that, although the majority\nacknowledges that the constitutionality of MCL 500.3135(2)(a) is not at issue here, it\nrepeatedly implies that MCL 500.3135(2)(a) “could” be unconstitutional, thus, making it\nobvious that MCL 500.3135(2)(a) will also likely fall within the majority’s effort to\nexpunge the jurisprudence of the past decade.\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\flargely agrees with Kreiner’s analysis of the language, “an objectively manifested\n\nimpairment of an important body function.”18 In addition, the majority agrees with\n\nKreiner’s conclusion that the serious impairment of body function threshold entails a\n\nsubjective analysis, i.e., “[w]hether an impairment that precludes a person from throwing\n\na ninety-five miles-an-hour fastball is a ‘serious impairment of body function’ may\n\ndepend on whether the person is a professional baseball player or an accountant who likes\n\nto play catch with his son every once in a while.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 134 n 19. The\n\n\n       I also disagree with the majority that “the disputed fact does not need to be\noutcome determinative in order to be material . . . .” MCL 500.3135(2)(a)(ii) states,\n“whether an injured person has suffered serious impairment of body function . . . [is a]\nquestion [] of law for the court if the court finds . . . [that the] factual dispute . . . is not\nmaterial to the determination as to whether the person has suffered a serious impairment\nof body function . . . .” That is, “[a]bsent an outcome-determinative genuine factual\ndispute, the issue of threshold injury is now a question of law for the court.” Kern v\nBlethen-Coluni, 240 Mich App 333, 341; 612 NW2d 838 (2000) (emphasis added).\nAlthough the majority cites Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed) in support of its proposition\nthat “the disputed fact does not need to be outcome determinative in order to be\nmaterial,” Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed) states the very opposite-- “[m]aterial fact is\none upon which outcome of litigation depends.” See also Black’s Law Dictionary (8th\ned), which defines “material” as “[h]aving some logical connection with the\nconsequential facts,” and Random House Webster’s College Dictionary, which defines\n“material” as “likely to influence the determination of a case.”\n       18\n          The majority does take issue with Kreiner’s conclusion that “[s]ubjective\ncomplaints that are not medically documented are insufficient” to establish that an\nimpairment is “objectively manifested.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132. However, given that\nthe majority agrees that “plaintiffs must ‘introduce evidence establishing that there is a\nphysical basis for their subjective complaints of pain and suffering,’” quoting DiFranco,\n427 Mich at 74, and I am uncertain what evidence other than medical documentation\nwould establish such a “physical basis,” it is not clear why the majority objects to\nKreiner’s statement that medical documentation is required. See also DiFranco, 427\nMich at 75 (“The ‘serious impairment of body function’ threshold requires the plaintiff to\nprove that his noneconomic losses arose out of a medically identifiable injury which\nseriously impaired a body function.”) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fmajority also agrees with Kreiner’s conclusion that determining whether a plaintiff’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life has been affected “necessarily requires a\n\ncomparison of the plaintiff’s life before and after the incident.”19 Finally, the majority\n\nagrees with Kreiner’s conclusion that permanency is not required.20\n\n                                  1. DIFRANCO VS. CASSIDY\n\n       However, this is where our agreements end. First, the majority takes issue with\n\nKreiner’s statement that “the Legislature largely rejected DiFranco in favor of Cassidy.”\n\nKreiner, 471 Mich at 121 n 8. As explained earlier, the Legislature adopted Cassidy with\n\na single exception. That single exception pertains to the fact that Cassidy, 415 Mich at\n\n505, required an evaluation of “the effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to\n\nlive a normal life,” while MCL 500.3135(7) requires an evaluation of the effect of an\n\ninjury on “the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThat is, while the Cassidy test was entirely objective, the MCL 500.3135(7) test is at least\n\npartially subjective. As this Court explained in Kreiner, 471 Mich at 121 n 7:\n\n              [T]he Legislature modified the entirely objective Cassidy standard to\n       a partially objective and partially subjective inquiry. Thus, what is\n       “normal” is to be determined subjectively on the basis of the plaintiff’s own\n       life and not the life of some objective third party. However, once that is\n\n       19\n          The majority also indicates that “many other considerations could typically be\nrelevant to determining how an impairment affects a person’s ability to live in his or her\npre-incident normal manner of living.” The majority does not offer any further\nexplanation as to what these “many other considerations” might conceivably be.\n       20\n        Although Kreiner, 471 Mich at 135, specifically held that “an injury need not be\npermanent,” the majority nonetheless criticizes it for “effectively creat[ing] a permanency\nrequirement.”\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\f       fixed as the base, it is to be objectively determined whether the impairment\n       in fact affects the plaintiff’s “general ability to lead” that life.\n\nNevertheless, given that: (a) Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505, held that courts should “look[] to\n\nthe effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal life”; (b) DiFranco,\n\n427 Mich at 39, held that courts should not look to the effect of the injury on the person’s\n\n“‘general ability to live a normal life’”; and (c) the Legislature subsequently and\n\naffirmatively directed the courts to look to the effect of an injury on “the person’s general\n\nability to lead his or her normal life,” MCL 500.3135(7), the Legislature obviously\n\npreferred the policy of Cassidy to that of DiFranco. In addition, in contrast to DiFranco,\n\nand consistent with Cassidy, the Legislature expressly adopted an “important body\n\nfunction” requirement, MCL 500.3135(7), and amended MCL 500.3135 to make clear\n\nthat whether a serious impairment of body function has occurred is a question of law\n\nunless there is a material factual dispute. MCL 500.3135(2)(a). Thus, contrary to the\n\nmajority’s understandably defensive posture, it is hardly an “oversimplification” to\n\nconclude that the Legislature essentially rejected DiFranco in favor of Cassidy.21\n\n       Moreover, the Legislature’s action of amending MCL 500.3135 following\n\nDiFranco is an example of legislative history that has genuine utility in the interpretative\n\nprocess. This Court has emphasized that “not all legislative history is of equal value,”\n\nand has specifically noted that “[c]learly of the highest quality is legislative history that\n\nrelates to an action of the Legislature from which a court may draw reasonable inferences\n\n       21\n         Contrary to the majority’s contention, this dissent very clearly provides in the\nabove language “specific, substantive arguments” in support of this conclusion.\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\fabout the Legislature’s intent . . . .” In re Certified Question, 468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659\n\nNW2d 597 (2003).        The instant case presents an ideal “[e]xample[] of legitimate\n\nlegislative history,” i.e., the recitation of “actions of the Legislature intended to repudiate\n\nthe judicial construction of a statute . . . .” Id. And yet, not altogether inexplicably, the\n\nmajority entirely disregards these legislative actions.\n\n       Defendant and amicus curiae the Attorney General have presented the Court with\n\nlegislative analyses, committee reports, and other materials to support their argument\n\nthat, in enacting the amendments, the Legislature intended to repudiate DiFranco and\n\nrestore Cassidy, just as Kreiner held. Even the most cursory review of these documents\n\ndemonstrates that defendant and its amicus’ reading has merit. For example, the original\n\ndraft of House Bill 4341 was accompanied by a memorandum from its sponsor that stated\n\nthat the bill’s first goal was to “[r]eestablish the two-part Cassidy standard of: (1)\n\ndefinition of ‘serious impairment of body function,’ and (2) make the determination of\n\nwhether an injury is a serious impairment of body function a question of law (judge)\n\nrather than of fact (jury).” Memorandum of Representative Harold Voorhees enclosing\n\nthe original draft of HB 4341, February 8, 1995. Similarly, the House Legislative\n\nAnalysis expressly set forth the chronology of Cassidy and DiFranco, noting that\n\nDiFranco had “rejected” Cassidy and that the bill “would return to a tort threshold\n\nresembling that provided by the Cassidy ruling . . . .” House Legislative Analysis, HB\n\n4341, December 18, 1995.        The analysis provided to the Senate Financial Services\n\nCommittee likewise explained in the first sentence of the bill’s description that it “would\n\nput into law the Cassidy standards for meeting the serious impairment of body function\n\n\n                                              20\n\fthreshold.” Department of Commerce Bill Analysis of HB 4341, February 14, 1995.\n\nAnd finally, it is apparent from the statements of protest of the bill’s opponents that they\n\nalso clearly understood House Bill 4341 to be a “return to the Cassidy standard.”\n\nStatements of Senator Henry Stallings and Senator John Cherry, October 12, 1995.\n\n       While on several occasions I have explained why I do not find all forms of\n\nlegislative history to be useful tools in the interpretative process, see, e.g., Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 381-382; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (MARKMAN, J.,\n\ndissenting), the author of the majority opinion has never questioned their utility.22 Thus,\n\n\n\n       22\n           The authoring justice states, “I have repeatedly stated that legislative history\nshould only be used when statutory language is ambiguous.” Although, in some cases, he\nhas asserted this, see, for example, People v Gardner, 482 Mich 41; 753 NW2d 78 (2008)\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); Bukowski v Detroit, 478 Mich 268; 732 NW2d 75 (2007)\n(CAVANAGH, J., concurring); People v Derror, 475 Mich 316; 715 NW2d 822 (2006)\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); Lansing Mayor v Pub Serv Comm, 470 Mich 154; 680\nNW2d 840 (2004) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), in other cases, he has suggested that\nlegislative history can be considered even though the statute is not ambiguous, see, for\nexample, Jackson v Green Estate, 484 Mich 209, 230; 771 NW2d 675 (2009)\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (“Not only is this interpretation consistent with the plain\nlanguage of the statute, it is also consistent with the legislative history of the statute.”)\n(emphasis added); Koester v City of Novi, 458 Mich 1; 580 NW2d 835 (1998); Elias Bros\nRestaurants v Treasury Dep’t, 452 Mich 144; 549 NW2d 837 (1996) (CAVANAGH, J.,\nconcurring); People v Barrera, 451 Mich 261; 547 NW2d 280 (1996); People v Sloan,\n450 Mich 160; 538 NW2d 380 (1995); Orzel v Scott Drug Co, 449 Mich 550; 537 NW2d\n208 (1995); Gardner v Van Buren Pub Schools, 445 Mich 23; 517 NW2d 1 (1994);\nGrand Trunk Western R Co v Fenton, 439 Mich 240; 482 NW2d 706 (1992); Romein v\nGeneral Motors Corp, 436 Mich 515; 462 NW2d 555 (1990). Further, given the\ndefinition of “ambiguous” supported by the authoring justice, see Petersen, 484 Mich at\n329 (KELLY, C.J., lead opinion) (quoting Yellow Freight Sys, Inc v Michigan, 464 Mich\n21, 38; 627 NW2d 236 [2001], for the proposition that “‘[w]hen a statute is capable of\nbeing understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses,\n[a] statute is ambiguous’”), and the different understandings given to the statute here by\nthe majority and dissenting justices, I fail to see how, by his own standards, he can\n\n\n                                             21\n\fthere is no apparent reason why the majority “turn[s] a blind eye to the wealth of extrinsic\n\ninformation available” on the history of the 1995 amendments. Nat’l Pride at Work, Inc\n\nv Governor, 481 Mich 56, 95 n 34; 748 NW2d 524 (2008) (KELLY, J., dissenting).\n\nRather, the only, quite obvious explanation for the majority’s selective silence is that it\n\ncan find nothing in this “wealth of extrinsic information available” to support its\n\ninterpretation.   One of the most common and compelling critiques of the use of\n\nlegislative history is that a judge can almost always find something in the legislative\n\nhistory to support the interpretation he personally wishes to give to a law. To borrow an\n\nanalogy invoked by United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, using\n\nlegislative history is like entering a room, looking over the assembled multitudes in the\n\ncrowd, and picking out your friends. See Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation (Princeton,\n\nNJ: Princeton University Press, 1997), at 36. In its near silence, the majority places a\n\nnew twist on this analogy, and illustrates another fundamental problem with the use of\n\nlegislative history. Here, the majority enters a room, and, finding no friends in sight,\n\nmakes a quick exit. Considering the quality and quantity of the legislative history\n\navailable here, the majority’s “quick exit” and its selective silence on the subject speaks\n\nvolumes. It should not go unremarked that it is this dissent that cites legislative history--\n\nalbeit a uniquely persuasive and bona fide form of legislative history-- as a relevant factor\n\nin interpreting MCL 500.3135, while the justices of the majority, the supposed advocates\n\n\n\nconclude that the statute is unambiguous, unless, of course, he does not believe that the\ndissenting justices are “reasonably well-informed persons.”\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\fof this mode of interpretation, exclude this from their consideration.           Apparently,\n\nlegislative history is to be considered when it supports a justice’s preferred interpretation,\n\nand ignored when it does not.\n\n       Indeed, the problem with this approach of sometimes relying on legislative history\n\nand sometimes not is, as I explained in my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 381-382, that\n\n       it is a process in which judges in the very guise of selecting the tools and\n       factors to be employed in “interpreting” the law are effectively its\n       formulators-- in short, judges who are wielding the legislative, not the\n       judicial, power.\n\n               A critical strength of a judicial philosophy committed to exercising\n       only the constitution’s “judicial power” is that reasonably clear rules of\n       decision-making are established before the fact. That is, a judge essentially\n       promises the parties that he or she will decide their case, as with all others,\n       by attempting to discern the reasonable meaning of relevant statutes or\n       contracts and that this will be done by relying upon recognized rules, and\n       tools, of interpretation. By contrast, under the [majority’s] approach . . . ,\n       in which there is essentially a limitless array of rules, and tools, that may be\n       employed for “defining” the law apart from its language, there is no\n       consistently applied interpretative process with which the judge promises\n       beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to be “fair,” and he or she\n       may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is to be\n       achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each\n       dispute on a case-by-case basis, using whatever rules, and whichever tools,\n       he or she believes are required in that instance. And the suspicion simply\n       cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate rules, and tools,\n       may be largely a function of the outcome preferred by the judge and by his\n       or her personal attitudes toward the parties and their causes. Any\n       interpretative rules will be identified only after the fact, and these “rules”\n       may or may not have been invoked in resolving yesterday’s dispute, and\n       may or may not be employed in resolving tomorrow’s dispute. Any judge\n       can concoct an after-the-fact rationale for a decision; the judicial process,\n       however, is predicated upon before-the-fact rationales. An ad hoc process\n       is not a judicial process at all. In the place of predetermined rules--\n       otherwise understood as the rule of law-- the [majority] would substitute\n       rules to be determined later. [Emphasis in the original.]\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f                          2. “TRAJECTORY” AND “ENTIRE”\n\n       Next, the majority peremptorily rejects Kreiner’s use of the words “trajectory” and\n\n“entire.” Again, the pertinent statutory language being defined here is, “that affects the\n\nperson’s general ability to lead his or her normal life.” MCL 500.3135(7). “Lead” is\n\ndefined as “to conduct or bring . . . in a particular course,” and, as the majority\n\nacknowledges, “‘trajectory’ is a synonym for ‘course.’”        Random House Webster’s\n\nCollege Dictionary (1991). In addition, contrary to the majority’s contention, Kreiner’s\n\nuse of the word “entire” was not “created out of thin air.” Instead, the use of the word\n\n“entire” derived from the Legislature’s use of the word “general” because “in general”\n\nmeans “with respect to the entirety.” Random House Webster’s College Dictionary\n\n(1991) (emphasis added). More accurately, it is the meaning that the majority gives to\n\n“general” that is “created out of thin air.”      The majority concludes that the word\n\n“general” means “some,” even though the definition that the majority itself relies upon\n\ndoes not even include “some,” but instead indicates that “general” means “whole,”\n\n“every,” “majority,” “prevalent,” “usually,” “in most instances,” “not limited,” and “main\n\nfeatures.”   Nowhere among these possible meanings can a reader sight the word\n\n“some.”23\n\n\n       23\n          I find it interesting that the authoring justice of the majority opinion once\nchastised me for “leav[ing] no dictionary unturned,” with regards to an opinion in which I\ncited two different dictionaries, People v Raby, 456 Mich 487, 501; 572 NW2d 644\n(1998) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), and, here, he cites seven different dictionaries and\nstill cannot quite find a definition that serves his purpose. While considering relevant\ndictionary definitions can be a valuable tool of interpretation, the majority’s generous use\nof dictionaries here is noteworthy because the majority has questioned the propriety and\n\n\n                                            24\n\f                              3. TEMPORAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n       Finally, the majority rejects the non-exhaustive list of factors that Kreiner set forth\n\nfor consideration in evaluating whether the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal\n\nlife has been affected. The majority asserts that Kreiner “departed . . . from the statutory\n\ntext, by providing an extra-textual ‘nonexhaustive list of objective factors’ to be used to\n\ncompare the plaintiff’s pre- and post-incident lifestyle.” This critique is quite surprising\n\ngiven that it is not uncommon for courts in general, and for this Court in particular, to\n\nprovide “extra-textual” factors to be considered in interpreting a statute that demands a\n\nfact-specific analysis.24 To the best of my knowledge, members of this majority have\n\nnever before complained about this practice, but consistency in the application and non-\n\napplication of interpretative factors is hardly a preoccupation of this majority.25\n\n\n\n\nusefulness of this tool in the past. Jones v Olson, 480 Mich 1169, 1176 (2008) (“In the\nlegal context, using a dictionary to unwaveringly determine the legislative intent behind a\nstatute is nothing more than barely hidden judicial activism.”) (WEAVER, J., dissenting)\n(Then-Justice KELLY and Justice CAVANAGH joined Justice WEAVER’s dissenting\nstatement).\n       24\n           I use the phrase “extra-textual” factors only because this is the phrase the\nmajority uses. However, in truth, I do not believe that the factors articulated in Kreiner\nare at all “extra-textual,” because these have been derived directly from the text of the\nstatute itself.\n       25\n          Indeed, as I explained in my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 380, the majority’s\n“interpretative” process seems to consist of “picking and choosing at [its] discretion from\namong some uncertain array of tools lying ‘beyond the plain language of the statute [or\ncontract].’” (Citation omitted.) The problem with this approach is that “[t]he litigants\nwill, of course, have no notice beforehand of which tools are to be employed, for the\njustices themselves will not know this beforehand.” Id. The rule gleaned from the\ninstant case is apparently that it is appropriate to employ “extra-textual” factors, but only\n\n\n                                             25\n\f      Indeed, in DiFranco itself, Justice CAVANAGH provided numerous “extra-textual”\n\nfactors to be considered in determining whether a plaintiff has established a serious\n\nimpairment of body function. DiFranco, 427 Mich at 69-70, states:\n\n             In determining whether the impairment of body function was\n      serious, the jury should consider such factors as the extent of the\n      impairment, the particular body function impaired, the length of time the\n      impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the impairment, and\n      any other relevant factors.\n\nIndeed, these “extra-textual” factors are remarkably similar to the Kreiner factors: “(a)\n\nthe nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length of treatment required, (c)\n\nthe duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of any residual impairment, and (e) the\n\nprognosis for eventual recovery.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 133. It not clear why the\n\nauthoring justice thought it acceptable to list “extra-textual” factors in DiFranco, but\n\nunacceptable to cite virtually the same factors in Kreiner. In addition, in Wexford Med\n\nGroup v City of Cadillac, 474 Mich 192; 713 NW2d 734 (2006), he listed “extra-textual”\n\nfactors a court should consider in determining whether an entity is a “charitable\n\ninstitution” and thus exempt from ad valorem property taxes. Also, in Chmielewski v\n\nXermac, Inc, 457 Mich 593, 633; 580 NW2d 817 (1998), the Court considered the\n\nHandicapper’s Civil Rights Act requirement that to be handicapped one must be\n\n“substantially limited in a major life activity.” MCL 37.1103(e)(i)(A). Then-Justice\n\nKELLY, joined by Justice CAVANAGH, stated in dissent:\n\n\n\nwhere the majority wishes to do so. The parties will be made aware of the majority’s\ninclinations, but only after a decision has been issued.\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\f              I would hold that the following factors should be considered to\n      determine whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life\n      activity: (1) the nature of the impairment, (2) its severity, (3) its duration or\n      expected duration, and (4) its long-term effect. [Chmielewski, 457 Mich at\n      63.]\n\nSee, also, Wood v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, 413 Mich 573; 321 NW2d 653 (1982),\n\nlisting several “extra-textual” factors a court should consider in awarding “reasonable”\n\nattorney fees under MCL 500.3148(1);26 Workman v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, 404\n\nMich 477, 496-497; 274 NW2d 373 (1979), adopting a four-factor test to determine\n\nwhether for purposes of the no-fault act a person is “domiciled in the same household” as\n\na relative pursuant to MCL 500.3114; Stewart v Michigan, 471 Mich 692, 698-699; 692\n\nNW2d 376 (2004), stating “extra-textual” “factors such as the manner, location, and\n\nfashion in which a vehicle is parked” are material to determining whether the parked\n\nvehicle poses an unreasonable risk under MCL 500.3106(1); and Reed v Yackell, 473\n\nMich 520; 703 NW2d 1 (2005), utilizing an “extra-textual” multi-factor economic-reality\n\ntest to determine who is an employer for purposes of the Worker’s Disability\n\nCompensation Act.\n\n      As should be readily apparent, the majority’s claim that Kreiner erred by including\n\n“extra-textual” factors to consider in interpreting a statute is a wholly manufactured\n\nconcern.   The statute requires a fact-specific analysis.         As Justice CAVANAGH’s\n\nDiFranco opinion and numerous other decisions of this Court have recognized, such\n\n      26\n          In his dissent in Smith v Khouri, 481 Mich 519, 544; 751 NW2d 472 (2008),\nJustice CAVANAGH affirmed his satisfaction with the Wood “factors,” even though these\nfactors are obviously “extra-textual.”\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\ffactors assist courts in applying the statutory language on a case-by-case basis. To date,\n\nnone of the members of the majority have objected to the inclusion of such factors in any\n\nother of this Court’s decisions.\n\n       Nevertheless, the majority rejects Kreiner’s “extra-textual” factors on the basis\n\nthat they all “include a temporal component,” reiterating the argument made by the\n\nKreiner dissent that “the statute does not create an express temporal requirement as to\n\nhow long an impairment must last.” Ante at __, see also Kreiner, 471 Mich at 147\n\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (“[T]he serious impairment of body function threshold does\n\nnot suggest any sort of temporal limitation. . . . Therefore, the duration of the impairment\n\nis not an appropriate inquiry.”). Indeed, the majority now holds that it is unnecessary to\n\nconsider whether the impairment even “continues to affect [plaintiff’s] general ability to\n\nlead his pre-incident ‘normal life’ . . . .” (Emphasis added.)\n\n       The majority, not surprisingly, claims that this dissent mischaracterizes its holding\n\nwhen we conclude that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant in the\n\nmajority’s holding. Not only, as explained above, is my characterization of their holding\n\nsupported by the actual language of the majority opinion, but it is also dictated by simple\n\nlogic. That is, given that the majority rejects Kreiner’s factors because they all “include a\n\ntemporal component,” given that it feels passionately enough about this to write a lengthy\n\nopinion overruling Kreiner, and given that we can discern no other significant departure\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\ffrom Kreiner in the majority’s new test than that of the temporal component,27 it is\n\ndifficult to escape the conclusion we reach here, that the majority believes that temporal\n\nconsiderations are wholly or largely irrelevant.\n\n       I am reminded of a famous Sherlock Holmes line:\n\n             “How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the\n       impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?”\n       [A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of the Four, from The Complete Sherlock\n       Holmes (New York: Doubleday, 1890), ch 6, p 111.]\n\nThat is, given that the majority essentially agrees with everything in Kreiner but its\n\ntemporal considerations,28 Kreiner’s temporal considerations are all that remain as to our\n\n\n\n       27\n          As explained above, there are other discrepancies between Kreiner and the\nmajority’s opinion, i.e., the DiFranco/Cassidy and the “trajectory/entire” discrepancies.\nHowever, these two discrepancies are intertwined with our disagreement about whether\ntemporal considerations should be considered. By returning our law to DiFranco, at\nwhich time the plaintiff’s “general ability to lead his or her normal life” was not at issue,\nit is much easier for the majority to claim that temporal considerations are wholly or\nlargely irrelevant. In addition, because the majority believes that it is inappropriate to\nconsider either the “trajectory” or the “entire” person’s life, it believes that temporal\nconsiderations, such as the duration of the impairment, are wholly or largely irrelevant.\nHowever, because we conclude that the statute clearly precludes a return to DiFranco,\nsince the Legislature has very clearly indicated that the plaintiff’s “general ability to lead\nhis or her normal life” is at issue, we believe that temporal considerations are relevant.\nSimilarly, because we believe that the “trajectory” or the “entire” person’s life should be\nconsidered, we believe that temporal considerations, such as the duration of the\nimpairment, are, in fact, highly relevant.\n       28\n           The majority essentially agrees with: (1) Kreiner’s analysis of MCL\n500.3135(2)(a), i.e., if there is no material factual dispute, whether a person has suffered\na serious impairment of body function should be determined by the court as a matter of\nlaw; (2) Kreiner’s analysis of the language, “an objectively manifested impairment of an\nimportant body function”; (3) Kreiner’s conclusion that the serious impairment of body\nfunction threshold entails a subjective analysis; (4) Kreiner’s conclusion that determining\nwhether a plaintiff’s general ability to lead his or her normal life has been affected\n\n\n                                             29\n\fdisagreement.     Therefore, that the majority disagrees with Kreiner’s temporal\n\nconsiderations, such as the duration of the impairment, “must be the truth.” In other\n\nwords, when comparing the Kreiner test and the majority’s new test-- whatever that is\n\nintended to be-- the only apparent substantive difference is that, while Kreiner expressly\n\nincludes temporal considerations, the majority’s test does not. Given that the majority\n\nessentially agrees with everything in Kreiner but its temporal considerations, and given\n\nthat the only reason it gives for rejecting these considerations is that they all “include a\n\ntemporal component,” how can we deduce anything other than that the majority holds\n\nthat temporal considerations, such as the duration of the impairment, are irrelevant?\n\n       Furthermore, if temporal considerations are not irrelevant, why does the majority\n\nnot explain in what way these are relevant, or how, in fact, the majority views the\n\nrelevancy of temporal considerations, and how these views differ from those expressed in\n\nKreiner? This glaring void in explanation of its own test in the majority opinion can only\n\nbe explained by the fact that the majority is holding that temporal considerations are\n\nwholly or largely irrelevant.\n\n       In sum, if temporal considerations are relevant: (1) why is the majority overruling\n\nKreiner; (2) why does the majority reject Kreiner’s factors, such as the duration of the\n\nimpairment; (3) why does the majority not include temporal considerations within its new\n\ntest; (4) why does the majority fail to explain the relevancy of temporal considerations;\n\n\n\n“necessarily requires a comparison of the plaintiff’s life before and after the incident”;\nand (5) Kreiner’s conclusion that permanency is not required.\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\f(5) why does the majority conclude that it is unnecessary to consider whether the\n\nimpairment “continues to affect [plaintiff’s] general ability to lead his pre-incident\n\n‘normal life’”; and (6) perhaps most tellingly, why does not the majority clarify its\n\nposition, whatever it may be, in light of this dissent? Simply saying that our conclusion\n\nis “erroneous” does not make it so, and, even more to the point, will hardly assist the\n\nbench and bar of this state in determining whether, and how, temporal considerations\n\nsomehow remain relevant after today’s decision.\n\n      For these reasons, we are unable to avoid the conclusion that the majority is,\n\nindeed, holding that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant, even though\n\nthis “improbable” result constitutes a departure from Cassidy, DiFranco, and Kreiner,\n\nand makes utterly no sense. How can it possibly be determined whether an impairment\n\n“affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life” without taking into\n\naccount temporal considerations? As Kreiner, 471 Mich at 133 n 18, inquired:\n\n             Does the dissent [now the majority] really believe that an\n      impairment lasting only a few moments has the same effect on a person’s\n      “general ability to lead his or her normal life” as an impairment lasting\n      several years or that an impairment requiring annual treatment has the same\n      effect on a person’s “general ability to lead his or her normal life” as an\n      impairment requiring daily treatment?\n\nDoes the majority really believe that the Legislature intended for the serious impairment\n\nthreshold to be met in every instance where an objectively manifested impairment of an\n\nimportant body function affected a person’s ability to lead his normal life for a mere\n\nmoment in time? What if a person gets hit in the head and passes out for five minutes,\n\nbut after those five minutes is completely unaffected by the impairment? If all temporal\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\fconsiderations are irrelevant, would not this person satisfy the majority’s threshold,\n\nbecause his general ability to lead his normal life was certainly affected for those five\n\nminutes of unconsciousness? Under the majority’s rule, it is apparently irrelevant that the\n\nperson arose after those five minutes and led a completely normal life thereafter. The\n\nmajority asserts that all that matters is that for that moment in time, the person’s general\n\nability to lead his normal life had been affected. I am not sure that the majority’s new\n\nthreshold can even be called a “threshold” when it can be satisfied in virtually every\n\nautomobile accident case that results in injury.29 As long as the plaintiff has suffered an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of an important body function, that plaintiff will have\n\nsatisfied the majority’s threshold, because the majority has essentially read the third\n\ncriterion, i.e., “that affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life,” out\n\nof the statute.\n\n       The clearest illustration of the difficulty in determining whether an impairment\n\n“affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life” without taking into\n\naccount temporal considerations is the majority’s own inability to do so.30 In determining\n\n\n       29\n        It certainly is a “threshold” bearing no resemblance to the other two thresholds--\n“permanent serious disfigurement” and “death.” See MCL 500.3135(1).\n       30\n          The majority criticizes Kreiner as “def[ying] practical workability” on the basis\nthat “Kreiner has led to inconsistent interpretation of the statutory language, with\nsimilarly situated plaintiffs being treated differently by different courts.” However, in his\nopinion in DiFranco, 427 Mich at 56-57, Justice CAVANAGH has already provided an\nexplanation for why this might be the case:\n\n              Conflicting results have also arisen among cases involving similarly\n       injured plaintiffs. This is undoubtedly because no two plaintiffs are injured\n\n\n                                              32\n\fwhether the plaintiff in the instant case suffered an impairment that affects his general\n\nability to lead his normal life, the majority itself repeatedly cites temporal considerations.\n\nFor example, the majority indicates that “for a month after the incident, plaintiff could\n\nnot bear weight on his left ankle”; “[h]e underwent two surgeries over a period of 10\n\nmonths and multiple months of physical therapy”; “after the incident he was unable to\n\nperform functions necessary for his job for at least 14 months”; “he did not return to work\n\nfor 19 months”; and “he missed fishing for a year after the incident.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nAre such temporal considerations irrelevant or relevant? Do we interpret the words or the\n\nactions of the majority? And, if temporal considerations are irrelevant, how are we to\n\ndetermine whether an impairment affects a plaintiff’s “general ability to lead his normal\n\nlife”? The majority does not appear to know the answers, and it appears not to care that it\n\ndoes not know.\n\n       Indeed, under the majority’s new threshold, it would seem that the moment the\n\nplaintiff in this case went to the emergency room and it was determined that he had\n\nbroken his ankle, the threshold was met. For at that moment, plaintiff could not work.\n\nWhile at the emergency room, and for some measurable time afterwards, plaintiff’s\n\n\n\n       or recover in precisely the same manner. These conflicting results indicate\n       that threshold issues are often questions upon which reasonable minds can\n       differ.\n\nMoreover, if the Court of Appeals is inconsistently or incorrectly applying Kreiner, this\nCourt has a mechanism to rectify such errors-- reversing such decisions, not overruling\nprecedent and substituting an incomprehensible new standard bearing no relationship to\nthe law being interpreted.\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\fbroken ankle affected not just some, but all, of his capacity to live his normal life. Under\n\nthe majority’s non-temporal test, there is apparently no need to consider anything beyond\n\nthe emergency room visit. If this reading of its decision is wrong, once again, the\n\nmajority might wish to explain why this is so for the benefit of the bench, the bar, and the\n\npublic.\n\n          In crafting its new threshold, the majority would also have been wise to consider\n\nthe larger no-fault statute. Recall that the Legislature has decided that an injured plaintiff\n\nshould only be allowed to sue to recover noneconomic damages resulting from an\n\nautomobile accident where he or she has suffered: (a) death; (b) permanent serious\n\ndisfigurement; or (c) serious impairment of body function. MCL 500.3135. It is well\n\nestablished that “‘[w]hen construing a series of terms . . . we are guided by the principle\n\nthat words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.’” In re Complaint of Rovas\n\nAgainst SBC Mich, 482 Mich 90, 114; 754 NW2d 259 (2008) (citation omitted). “In other\n\nwords, this Court applies the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, which ‘stands for the principle\n\nthat a word or phrase is given meaning by its context of setting.’” Id. (citation omitted).\n\nTherefore, as this Court explained in Cassidy, 415 Mich at 503:\n\n                 In determining the seriousness of the injury required for a “serious\n          impairment of body function”, this threshold should be considered in\n          conjunction with the other threshold requirements for a tort action for\n          noneconomic loss, namely, death and permanent serious disfigurement.\n          MCL 500.3135 . . . . The Legislature clearly did not intend to erect two\n          significant obstacles to a tort action for noneconomic loss and one quite\n          insignificant obstacle.[31]\n\n          31\n          See also DiFranco, 427 Mich at 95 (WILLIAMS, C.J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (“In the statutory language, ‘serious impairment of body function’\n\n\n                                              34\n\fIn addition, the Legislature defined “serious impairment of body function” to mean “an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” MCL 500.3135(7). Obviously, in enacting\n\nthis threshold language, and in joining it with “death” and “serious permanent\n\ndisfigurement,” the Legislature was unlikely to have had in mind an impairment that only\n\naffected a plaintiff’s ability to lead his normal life for a moment in time, with no\n\nconsideration being given to the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life beyond\n\nthat moment. Indeed, it is quite certain that this is not what the Legislature had in mind,\n\ngiven that the very premise of the no-fault act, and the core of the accompanying\n\nlegislative compromise, was that some injured persons would not be able to recover\n\nnoneconomic damages, so that all injured persons would be able to recover economic loss\n\nbenefits regardless of fault.\n\n                                      D. APPLICATION\n\n       As explained earlier, both Kreiner and the majority agree that the court must first\n\ndetermine whether there is a factual dispute that is material to the determination whether\n\nplaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function. Here, there are no material\n\nfactual disputes. Before the accident, plaintiff worked approximately 60 hours a week\n\nand for the six months immediately before the accident, plaintiff’s position was that of a\n\nmedium truck loader. Additionally, plaintiff fished and golfed. Twelve months after the\n\n\nappears with the other threshold requirements of ‘permanent serious disfigurement’ and\n‘death,’ leaving the strong implication, under the rule of ejusdem generis, that while the\nimpairment need not be permanent or fatal, it was not to be transient or trivial either.”).\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\faccident, plaintiff’s surgeon cleared him to return to work with no restrictions. Seventeen\n\nmonths after the accident, plaintiff returned to work and has been able to perform all of\n\nhis job duties since then. During the entire time he was recuperating, plaintiff could tend\n\nto his needs and there was no effect on his relationship with his then-fiancée.\n\nAdditionally, plaintiff continued to fish and golf. Thus, I agree with the majority that\n\nthere are no factual disputes that are material to the determination of whether plaintiff\n\nsuffered a serious impairment of a body function. The facts are clear.\n\n       I also agree with the majority that the “body function” that was “impaired,” the\n\nability to walk, was “important,” and that the impairment was “objectively manifested.”\n\nAlthough plaintiff was able to walk to some extent, his ability to do so was impaired, and\n\nhis impairment, a broken ankle, was recognized by his doctors. The final, and critical,\n\ninquiry in this case concerns whether the impairment affects plaintiff’s “general ability to\n\nlead his normal life.” This is where the majority and I depart. The Kreiner analysis\n\nrequires a comparison of plaintiff’s life before the accident and after the accident,\n\nincluding “the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiff’s overall\n\nlife.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132-133. To aid in this analysis, the following factors may\n\nbe considered:\n\n              (a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length\n       of treatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of\n       any residual impairment, and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery. [Id.\n       at 133.]\n\n       Plaintiff’s ability to walk, as just noted, was impaired by a broken ankle.\n\nHowever, once plaintiff’s ankle was placed in a cast at the emergency room, he was able\n\n\n\n                                            36\n\fto walk with the aid of crutches. And, immediately following his initial surgery in which\n\na device was implanted to stabilize his ankle, plaintiff was still able to walk with\n\ncrutches, although he was instructed not to place any weight on his ankle for one month.\n\nPlaintiff underwent physical therapy and nine months later, in October of 2005, plaintiff\n\nagain underwent surgery to remove the device. By January 2006 (one year after the\n\naccident), plaintiff’s surgeon had cleared plaintiff to return to work with no restrictions.\n\nHowever, plaintiff claimed that he could not keep up with the demands of his job and\n\nthus was placed back on workers’ compensation. Although plaintiff’s subjective reports\n\nof his pain from January 2006 forward varied greatly,32 the March 2006 FCE supported\n\nplaintiff’s claim that he could not fully perform all of his previous job duties; however,\n\nthis was due in part to a preexisting and unrelated shoulder injury. After plaintiff’s\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits were terminated, however, plaintiff requested another\n\nFCE, and, on August 1, 2006, the FCE showed that plaintiff was able to perform essential\n\njob demands with no restrictions. Plaintiff returned to work on August 16, 2006, and has\n\nbeen able to perform his job duties since that time.\n\n\n       32\n          As already discussed, in January 2006, plaintiff reported to his surgeon that his\nankle was not giving him any pain; in March of 2006, plaintiff reported during his FCE\nthat his pain was a three out of ten; in June of 2006, plaintiff reported to his physiatrist\nthat his pain was a six out of ten; in August 2006, plaintiff reported during his FCE that\nhis pain was as low as zero out of ten (at which point, he returned to work); and in\nOctober of 2006, plaintiff reported during his deposition that his life was “normal” with\nsome pain. These drastically inconsistent reports of pain demonstrate why, with regard to\nthe “extent of any residual impairment,” “[s]elf-imposed restrictions, as opposed to\nphysician-imposed restrictions, based on real or perceived pain do not establish this\npoint.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 133 n 17.\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\f       Although plaintiff was assigned to a position that was less physically demanding\n\nthan the position he had been performing before he was injured, plaintiff did this\n\nvoluntarily and he suffered no loss in pay. Moreover, at the time plaintiff was injured, he\n\nhad only been in that position for six months and, since he began to work for Allied in\n\n2002, he had worked in three different positions. Thus, the fact that defendant was\n\nassigned to a different position upon his return is not particularly significant in this\n\nCourt’s analysis.\n\n       Plaintiff’s only argument regarding his inability to lead his normal life is that he\n\nwas unable to work at certain times. During the time he was recuperating, plaintiff could\n\ncare for himself and tend to his household chores without assistance. His relationship\n\nwith his fiancée/wife was unaffected. And he was able to enjoy his recreational activities\n\nwithout interruption. By plaintiff’s own admission, his life was “normal” with some\n\n“occasional aching” that was not aggravated by any activities, including standing or\n\nprolonged walking. It is fair to say that by August of 2006 plaintiff had fully recovered\n\nfrom his broken ankle. Because only plaintiff’s ability to work was affected and because\n\nthis only lasted, at the very lengthiest, 17 months, the lower courts did not err in\n\nconcluding that the impairment did not affect plaintiff’s “general ability to lead his\n\nnormal life” and, therefore, that plaintiff did not meet the “serious impairment of body\n\nfunction” threshold.\n\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\f                                    E. STARE DECISIS\n\n       The majority overrules Kreiner while paying its usual lip service to stare decisis.33\n\nMy fundamental disagreement with the majority’s application of the stare decisis doctrine\n\nis quite easily summarized. In Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439, 464; 613 NW2d 307\n\n(2000), this Court drew on past caselaw and identified several relevant considerations in\n\ndetermining whether a case should be overruled under stare decisis.34 As explained\n\n\n\n       33\n           It is of interest that this is the second time the authoring justice has authored an\nopinion overruling an earlier case making it easier for a plaintiff to establish a serious\nimpairment of body function. In DiFranco, he authored an opinion overruling Cassidy.\nJustice WILLIAMS complained: “Four years after this Court issued its opinion in Cassidy\nv McGovern, 415 Mich 483; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), the majority sees fit to overrule the\ndecision of five members of a six-member court and adopt the position of the dissent in\nthat case.” DiFranco, 427 Mich at 92 (WILLIAMS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). In this case, the authoring justice again sees fit to overrule a case that was decided\nonly six years ago and to adopt his own dissenting opinion from that case. While it is by\nnow clear what the authoring justice believes the no-fault policies of this state ought to\nbe, it is considerably less clear what connection these views bear to those of the people\nand their Legislature.\n       34\n         The fact that the lead opinion relies far more on Chief Justice KELLY’s opinion\nin Petersen, which only Justice CAVANAGH joined, than on the majority opinion in\nRobinson should not go unnoticed. For a discussion of Chief Justice KELLY’s Petersen\nstandard for overruling precedent, see my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 350.\n\n       Concerning the statements of Justices HATHAWAY and WEAVER about stare\ndecisis:\n\n               Justice HATHAWAY contends that stare decisis constitutes a “policy\n       consideration” and that the “particular analytical approach will differ from\n       case to case.” Similarly, Justice WEAVER contends that stare decisis\n       constitutes a “principle of policy” and that there is no need for a\n       “standardized test for stare decisis,” as long as justices exercise “judicial\n       restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness.” The problem with these\n       “approaches” is that “litigants will, of course, have no notice beforehand of\n       which [“analytical approach”] will be employed, for the justices themselves\n\n\n                                              39\n\fherein, Kreiner was the first occasion on which this Court was called upon to interpret the\n\n1995 amendments to MCL 500.3135. Kreiner gave effect to the legislative intent as\n\nexpressed in the language of the amended statute and was not, in my judgment, wrongly\n\ndecided. Nonetheless, my disagreement with the majority on this point is not the thrust\n\nof this section. Rather, it is to remind the majority “that there are larger issues at stake in\n\nthis case: the rule of law, respect for precedent, the integrity of this Court, and judicial\n\nrestraint. Accordingly, larger institutional issues are implicated in this case.” Paige v\n\nCity of Sterling Hts, 476 Mich 495, 543; 720 NW2d 219 (2006) (CAVANAGH, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n       Indeed, the author of the majority opinion, as one who subscribes to the doctrine\n\nof legislative acquiescence, has often argued that principles of stare decisis are especially\n\n\n       will not know this beforehand.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 380 (MARKMAN, J.,\n       dissenting).\n\n                                       * * *\n\n              Although Justice WEAVER is correct that “there are many factors to\n       consider in deciding whether or not to overrule precedent,” and Justice\n       HATHAWAY is equally correct that the application of stare decisis must take\n       place on a “case-by-case basis,” this does not obviate the need to at least\n       reasonably attempt to apprise the parties, and the citizens of this state,\n       before the fact what some of these factors might be, as this Court did in\n       Robinson and as the Chief Justice and Justice CAVANAGH did in Petersen.\n       And, whatever else can be understood of Justice HATHAWAY’s and Justice\n       WEAVER’s “approaches” to stare decisis, the application of these\n       “approaches” has resulted in 13 precedents of this Court being overruled\n       during this term alone, and 6 other precedents being teed up for possible\n       overruling during the next term, doubtless a record pace for dismantling the\n       caselaw of this state. [Univ of Mich v Titan, Ins Co, __ Mich __; __ NW2d\n       __ (2010) (MARKMAN, J., dissenting).]\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\fstrong in matters of statutory interpretation.35 Accordingly, his own words are relevant\n\nhere: “[T]he majority does not adequately explain why it disregards the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis in a matter of statutory interpretation when the Legislature itself has not seen fit in\n\n[six] years to correct [Kreiner’s] allegedly incorrect interpretation.” Id. at 536. To be\n\n       35\n           “[P]rinciples of stare decisis in matters of statutory interpretation, particularly\nwhere the Legislature has not responded to a prior interpretation, weigh against\noverruling precedent absent sound and specific justification.” Paige, 476 Mich at 540-\n541 (CAVANAGH, concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added); see also\nDevillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 473 Mich 562, 613-614; 702 NW2d 539 (2005)\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); Neal v Wilkes, 470 Mich 661, 676-677; 685 NW2d 648\n(2004) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); People v Moore, 470 Mich 56, 78-79; 679 NW2d 41\n(2004) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); Jones v Dep’t of Corrections, 468 Mich 646, 665;\n664 NW2d 717 (2003) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); Mack v Detroit, 467 Mich 186, 221-\n222; 649 NW2d 47 (2002) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting); Robertson v DaimlerChrysler\nCorp, 465 Mich 732, 767-768; 641 NW2d 567 (2002) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\nSignificantly, the authoring justice has gone so far as to suggest that “when this Court\nfirst interprets a statute, then the statute becomes what this Court has said it is,” and that,\nabsent further legislative action, “‘[h]aving given our view on the meaning of a statute,\nour task is concluded, absent extraordinary circumstances.’” Paige, 476 Mich at 537\n(CAVANAGH, concurring in part and dissenting in part), quoting Boys Markets, Inc v\nRetail Clerks Union, 398 US 235, 257-258; 90 S Ct 1583; 26 L Ed 2d 199 (1970) (Black,\nJ., dissenting) (emphasis omitted). One cannot reconcile this view of legislative\nacquiescence and stare decisis with the majority’s decision to overrule Kreiner. Kreiner\nwas this Court’s first interpretation of the amended MCL 500.3135, and, although bills\nwere subsequently introduced that would have abolished Kreiner, such bills were\nrepeatedly rejected by the Legislature. See, e.g., SB 1429 (2004); SB 618, HB 4846, and\nHB 4940 (2005); SB 445, HB 4301, and HB 4999 (2007); and SB 83 and HB 4680\n(2009). Therefore, what is the majority’s “sound and specific justification” for departing\nfrom Kreiner? Paige, 476 Mich at 541 (CAVANAGH, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). What are the “extraordinary circumstances” that make it appropriate to do so? Id.\nat 538 (citation, quotation marks, and emphasis omitted). While, in my view, this Court\nhas correctly repudiated the doctrine of legislative acquiescence, see Donajkowski v\nAlpena Power Co, 460 Mich 243, 258-261; 596 NW2d 574 (1999), there is no principled\nreason why the majority, whose members are convinced advocates of this doctrine,\nchooses to ignore the Legislature’s repeated rejection of attempts to abolish Kreiner, just\nas there is no principled reason why the majority chooses to ignore the Legislature’s\nactions in amending MCL 500.3135 and the other forms of available legislative history.\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\ffair, it is not only the author of the majority opinion, but all the justices who comprise the\n\nmajority who should more clearly recognize the consequences of what they are doing.\n\nEven a cursory analysis of the majority’s treatment of precedent since it ascended to\n\npower in January 2009 reveals a lack of sufficient regard for recent precedents that is\n\ndirectly contrary to their own previous assertions of the need not to needlessly overrule\n\ncases on account of stare decisis. Past complaints on their part that cases should not be\n\noverruled when the only thing that has changed is the membership of the Court have gone\n\nby the wayside.36\n\n                       1. MAJORITY AND PRECEDENT IN 2009\n\n       The new majority assumed power in January 2009, and wasted little time in\n\nbeginning its efforts to “undo” decisions of the previous majority.37 On December 29,\n\n2008, the former majority issued its opinion in United States Fidelity Ins & Guaranty Co\n\nv Mich Catastrophic Claims Ass’n, 482 Mich 414, 417; 759 NW2d 154 (2008). Soon\n\n\n       36\n         Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197, 256; 731 NW2d 41 (2007)\n(KELLY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The law has not changed. Only\nthe individuals wearing the robes have changed.”); Paige, 476 Mich at 532-533\n(CAVANAGH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The only change has been the\ncomposition of this Court. And unfortunately, this is the only reasonable answer to the\nquestion why a decision from this Court decided just eight years earlier and involving the\nsame issue is now being overruled. But make no mistake, this answer is alarming, and it\nhas become increasingly common.”). As observed, after the composition of this Court\nchanged when Justice HATHAWAY replaced former Chief Justice TAYLOR on January 1,\n2009, this Court granted plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration even though such motion\nhad not raised any new legal arguments. 485 Mich 851 (2009).\n       37\n        See Detroit Free Press, December 10, 2008, at A2, where Chief Justice KELLY\npromised to “undo . . . the damage that the Republican-dominated court has done.”\n\n\n\n                                             42\n\fafter Justice HATHAWAY replaced former Chief Justice TAYLOR on January 1, 2009, the\n\nplaintiffs filed motions for rehearing. The new majority granted the plaintiffs’ motions\n\nfor rehearing, and the cases were resubmitted for decision “without further briefing or\n\noral argument.” 483 Mich 918 (2009). Then, in United States Fidelity Ins & Guaranty\n\nCo v Michigan Catastrophic Claims Ass’n (On Rehearing), 484 Mich 1, 46; __ NW2d __\n\n(2009), the new majority reversed the former majority’s decision.\n\n       In Bush v Shabahang, 484 Mich 156, 175 n 34; 772 NW2d 272 (2009), the\n\nmajority stated that it “question[ed] whether Roberts I [Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp,\n\n466 Mich 57; 642 NW2d 663 (2002)] and Boodt [v Borgess Med Ctr, 481 Mich 558; 751\n\nNW2d 44 (2008)] were correctly decided . . . .” And, in Potter v McLeary, 484 Mich\n\n397, 424 n 32; 774 NW2d 1 (2009), the majority said: “We question whether Roberts II\n\n[Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp, 470 Mich 679; 684 NW2d 711 (2004)] was correctly\n\ndecided . . . .”\n\n       The majority’s treatment of precedent in the seven-month period from when it\n\ntook power until the end of the Court’s term in July 2009 was well explained in earlier\n\nstatements of mine and of Justices CORRIGAN and YOUNG. For example, in Henry v Dow\n\nChem Co, 484 Mich 483, 528 n 28; 772 NW2d 301 (2009), Justice YOUNG observed in\n\nhis partial dissent:\n\n              The majority’s determination to ignore facts and precedent\n       inconvenient to its desired outcome has become its modus operandi. See,\n       e.g., Vanslembrouck v Halperin, 483 Mich 965; 763 NW2d 919 (2009),\n       where the new majority ignored Vega v Lakeland Hospitals at Niles & St\n       Joseph, Inc, 479 Mich 243, 244; 736 NW2d 561 (2007); Hardacre v\n       Saginaw Vascular Services, 483 Mich 918 (2009), where it failed to follow\n       Boodt v Borgess Med Ctr, 481 Mich 558; 751 NW2d 44 (2008); Sazima v\n\n\n                                           43\n\f      Shepherd Bar & Restaurant, 483 Mich 924; 762 NW2d 924 (2009), where\n      it failed to follow Chrysler v Blue Arrow Transport Lines, 295 Mich 606;\n      295 NW 331 (1940), and Camburn v Northwest School Dist, 459 Mich 471;\n      592 NW2d 46 (1999); Juarez v Holbrook, 483 Mich 970 (2009), where it\n      failed to follow Smith v Khouri, 481 Mich 519; 751 NW2d 472 (2008)[38];\n      Chambers v Wayne Co Airport Auth, 483 Mich 1081 (2009), where it failed\n      to follow Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197; 731 NW2d\n      41 (2007);[39] and Scott v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 483 Mich 1032\n      (2009), where it failed to enforce Thornton v Allstate Ins Co, 425 Mich\n      643; 391 NW2d 320 (1986), and Putkamer v Transamerica Ins Corp of\n      America, 454 Mich 626; 563 NW2d 683 (1997).\n\n      And, as Justice CORRIGAN stated in her dissenting statement in Beasley v\n\nMichigan, 483 Mich 1025 (2009):\n\n             [T]he new majority’s failure to abide by Rowland continues a\n      growing and troubling trend. Rather than forthrightly overruling that\n      decision, it is increasingly becoming the practice of this Court to simply\n      ignore precedents with which it disagrees. . . .\n\n                                          * * *\n             On this Court, the new majority offers no articulable reasons\n      whatsoever for its apparent detours from stare decisis. Instead, the majority\n      declines to explain whether--and, if so, why--it is overruling precedent\n      despite the obvious appearance that it is doing so. If it intends to alter legal\n      principles embedded in this Court’s decisions, then the new majority should\n      explain its reasons clearly and intelligibly. Instead, the new majority\n      38\n           I dissented in Juarez v Holbrook, 483 Mich 970 (2009), stating:\n              [T]he majority’s disdain for Smith [v Khouri, 481 Mich 519; 751\n      NW2d 472 (2008)] is apparently viewed as adequate justification for\n      ignoring Smith.       Rather than forthrightly overruling this decision,\n      something the new majority is apparently loathe to do (perhaps because\n      several majority justices repeatedly and loudly proclaimed fealty to stare\n      decisis, and dissented, whenever the former majority overruled a\n      precedent), it is increasingly becoming the modus operandi of this Court\n      that relevant precedents simply be ignored.\n      39\n        The majority also failed to follow Rowland in Ward v Michigan State Univ, 485\nMich 917 (2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                             44\n\f      overrules by indirection, or at least leaves the impression that it is doing so,\n      thereby sowing the seeds of confusion and making it difficult for the\n      citizens of this state to comprehend precisely what our caselaw requires.\n      This appears to be an unfortunate return to our predecessors’ past practice\n      of “frequently pa[ying] little attention to the inconsistencies among its cases\n      and declin[ing] to reduce confusion in [the Court’s] jurisprudence by\n      overruling conflicting decisions.” Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 473\n      Mich 562, 571 n 19 [702 NW2d 539] (2005).[40]\n\n      Additionally, in Petersen, 484 Mich 300, Chief Justice KELLY authored an\n\nopinion, joined only by Justice CAVANAGH, in which she indicated that she wanted to\n\noverrule Robinson v Detroit, 462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), and Lansing Mayor v\n\nPub Serv Comm, 470 Mich 154; 680 NW2d 840 (2004). In my dissent, I stated:\n\n             Given that in this case the Chief Justice would expressly overrule,\n      not one, but two of this Court’s prior decisions,\n\n      “one is naturally tempted to re-inquire, see Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd\n      Comm, 477 Mich 197, 223-228; 731 NW2d 41 (2007) (MARKMAN, J.,\n      concurring), whether the ongoing dispute between the [former] majority\n      and Justice KELLY over overrulings of precedent truly concerns attitudes\n      toward stare decisis or merely attitudes toward particular previous decisions\n      of this Court.” [People v Smith, 478 Mich 292, 322-323 n 17; 733 NW2d\n      351 (2007).]\n\n             “A justice’s perspective on stare decisis is not evidenced by her\n      willingness to maintain precedents with which she agrees, but by her\n      willingness to maintain precedents with which she disagrees.” Rowland,\n      477 Mich at 224-225 n 3 (MARKMAN, J., concurring). Now that the Chief\n      Justice is positioned to overrule decisions with which she disagrees, her\n\n      40\n           On the other hand, as I stated in Rowland, 477 Mich at 226-227:\n\n            [T]he [former] majority has been disciplined in stating expressly\n      when a precedent has been overruled. The [former] majority has never\n      attempted to obscure when a precedent was overruled or to minimize the\n      number of such precedents by dubious “distinguishing” of prior caselaw.\n      Rather, it has been forthright in identifying and critiquing precedents that\n      were viewed as wrongly decided and warranting overruling.\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\f      actions increasingly demonstrate that her former claims of fealty toward\n      stare decisis were considerably overstated. Despite all her rhetoric\n      concerning the importance of stare decisis for the exercise of the judicial\n      power, see, e.g., her hollow claim that she possessed a “differing [and\n      elevated] esteem for stare decisis” than another justice, People v Gardner,\n      482 Mich 41, 88 n 31; 753 NW2d 78 (2008), such rhetoric was in reality\n      little more than a means of communicating her opposition to overruling\n      particular past decisions with which she agreed. [Petersen, 484 Mich at\n      389-390 (MARKMAN, J., dissenting) (emphasis in the original).]\n\n      One other practice to which the new majority began to adhere in 2009 was\n\nrequesting that the parties brief whether a decision of the former majority should be\n\noverruled. See, e.g., Justice YOUNG’s partial dissent in Potter, 484 Mich at 450 n 43, in\n\nwhich he stated:\n\n              It is quickly becoming a new favored practice of the majority to flag\n      decisions of the past decade and invite challenges to those decisions. It is\n      difficult to reconcile this practice with the majority’s previous claims of\n      fidelity to stare decisis. See, e.g., . . . Pohutski v City of Allen Park, 465\n      Mich 675, 712; [641] NW2d 219 (2002) (KELLY, J., dissenting) (“[I]f each\n      successive Court, believing its reading is correct and past readings wrong,\n      rejects precedent, then the law will fluctuate from year to year, rendering\n      our jurisprudence dangerously unstable.”); Devillers, supra at 620\n      (WEAVER, J., dissenting) (“Under the doctrine of stare decisis, it is\n      necessary to follow earlier judicial decisions when the same points arise\n      again in litigation.”); Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197,\n      278; 731 NW2d 41 (2007) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (“Under the\n      doctrine of stare decisis, principles of law deliberately examined and\n      decided by a court of competent jurisdiction become precedent and should\n      not be lightly departed. Absent the rarest circumstances, we should remain\n      faithful to established precedent.”) . . . . See also Todd C. Berg, Esq.,\n      Hathaway Attacks, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 27, 2008, in which\n      Justice HATHAWAY was quoted: “I believe in stare decisis. Something must\n      be drastically wrong for the court to overrule”; Lawyers’ Election Guide:\n      Judge Diane Marie Hathaway, Michigan Lawyers Weekly, October 30,\n      2006, in which Justice HATHAWAY, then running for a position on the\n      Court of Appeals, was quoted: “Too many appellate decisions are being\n      decided by judicial activists who are overturning precedent.” [Citations\n      omitted.]\n\n\n\n                                           46\n\f      Thus, from January 2009 through July 31, 2009, the new majority reversed an\n\nopinion on rehearing, sowed seeds of confusion by questioning three cases decided by the\n\nformer majority, i.e., Roberts I, Roberts II, and Boodt, failed to follow numerous other\n\nprecedents as cited above, and began to issue orders requesting that the parties brief\n\nwhether decisions made by the former majority should be overruled.41 And Chief Justice\n\nKELLY and Justice CAVANAGH went on record urging the express overruling of two\n\ncases: Robinson and Mayor of Lansing.\n\n                      2. MAJORITY AND PRECEDENT IN 2010\n\n      In 2010, the majority has accelerated efforts to “undo” numerous cases decided by\n\nthe former majority through express overrulings and additional orders asking parties to\n\nbrief whether a case should be overruled.\n\n      In People v Feezel, 486 Mich 184; 783 NW2d 67 (2010), the majority expressly\n\noverruled People v Derror, 475 Mich 316; 715 NW2d 822 (2006). In Lansing Sch Educ\n\n\n      41\n         The Detroit Free Press took note of the majority’s actions and stated as follows\nin an October 11, 2009 editorial, Restoring judicial restraint:\n\n             Even before the new term began, the new Democratic majority\n      (buttressed by the renegade WEAVER) had signaled its own impatience to\n      begin dismantling the Engler Court’s legacy when it agreed to reconsider\n      an appeal the court rejected just a month before TAYLOR’S departure. The\n      revived appeal appears to hinge on the court’s willingness to reverse two of\n      the Engler court’s more recent decisions.\n                                            * * *\n             Democrats can hardly reinvigorate stare decisis – the reasonable\n      conviction that the rules of the game shouldn’t change every time a new\n      referee takes the field – by reversing every questionable call its\n      predecessors made.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\fAss’n v Lansing Bd of Edu, __ Mich __; __ NW2d __ (2010), the majority overruled Lee\n\nv Macomb Co Bd of Comm’rs, 464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001), Crawford v Dep’t\n\nof Civil Serv, 466 Mich 250; 645 NW2d 6 (2002), Nat’l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland\n\nCliffs Iron Co, 471 Mich 608; 684 NW2d 800 (2004), Associated Builders & Contractors\n\nv Dep’t of Consumer & Indus Servs Dir, 472 Mich 117, 124-127; 693 NW2d 374 (2005),\n\nMich Chiropractic Council v Comm’r of the Office of Fin & Ins Servs, 475 Mich 363;\n\n716 NW2d 561 (2006), Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Sch, 479 Mich 336; 737 NW2d 158\n\n(2007), and Mich Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestlé Waters North America Inc,\n\n479 Mich 280, 302-303; 737 NW2d 447 (2007), and Manuel v Gill, 481 Mich 637; 753\n\nNW2d 48 (2008). In Bezeau v Palace Sports, __ Mich __; __ NW2d __ (2010), the\n\nmajority expressly overruled the limited retroactive effect of Karaczewski v Farbman\n\nStein & Co, 478 Mich 28; 732 NW2d 56 (2007). In Univ of Mich v Titan Ins Co, __\n\nMich __; __ NW2d __ (2010), the majority expressly overruled Cameron v Auto Club Ins\n\nAss’n, 476 Mich 55; 718 NW2d 784 (2006). In O’Neal v St. John Hosp, __ Mich __, __\n\nn __; __ NW2d __ (2010), the lead opinion authored by Justice HATHAWAY indicated its\n\nagreement with Justice CAVANAGH’s partial dissent in Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare\n\nSys, 465 Mich 53; 631 NW2d 686 (2001), which already had the support of three Justices\n\n(Chief Justice KELLY and Justices CAVANAGH and WEAVER). And, of course, in the case\n\nat bar, the majority has expressly overruled Kreiner. Finally, by amending MCR 2.112\n\nand MCR 2.118 to allow amendments of affidavits of merit to relate back to the of the\n\noriginal filing of the affidavit, the majority effectively overruled Kirkaldy v Rim, 478\n\nMich 581; 734 NW2d 201 (2007). 485 Mich ___ (2010).\n\n\n                                          48\n\f                    3. REVERSALS OF PRECEDENT TO COME\n\n      The majority’s work, however, has apparently only just begun. It has already teed\n\nup six more cases in its grant orders for possible overruling. These include: Mich\n\nCitizens v Nestlé Waters, 479 Mich 280; 737 NW2d 447 (2007);42 Preserve the Dunes,\n\nInc v Dep’t of Environmental Quality, 471 Mich 508; 684 NW2d 847 (2004);43 Trentadue\n\nv Buckler Automatic Lawn Sprinkler Co, 479 Mich 378; 738 NW2d 664 (2007);44 Griffith\n\nv State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 472 Mich 521; 697 NW2d 895 (2005);45 Rory v\n\n\n\n      42\n          This Court’s grant order in Anglers of the AuSable, Inc v Dep’t of\nEnvironmental Quality, 485 Mich 1067 (2010), inquired whether Mich Citizens v Nestlé\nWaters, 479 Mich 280; 737 NW2d 447 (2007), was correctly decided, and the majority\ndenied a motion to dismiss in that case even though that case is now clearly moot. See\nAnglers, __ Mich __ (2010) (YOUNG, J., dissenting), order entered June 18, 2010 (Docket\nNos. 138863 to 138866). Apparently, the majority just could not wait until next term to\noverrule Nestlé Waters, because it appears already to have done so in Lansing Sch Educ\nAss’n v Lansing Bd of Educ, __ Mich __; __ NW2d __ (2010).\n      43\n         This Court’s grant order in Anglers also inquired whether Preserve the Dunes\nwas correctly decided, and, as noted, the majority denied the motion to dismiss in that\ncase even though it is now clearly moot. See Anglers, __ Mich at __ (2010) (YOUNG, J.,\ndissenting), ordered entered June 18, 2010 (Docket Nos. 138863 to 138866).\n      44\n         Colaianni v Stuart Frankel Dev Corp, 485 Mich 1070 (2010), inquired “whether\nTrentadue v Buckler Automatic Lawn Sprinkler Co, 479 Mich 378, was correctly\ndecided.”\n      45\n         This Court’s grant order in Wilcox v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 486 Mich 870\n(2010), inquired “whether Griffith v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 472 Mich 521 (2005),\nwas correctly decided.” This order is the majority’s second tee-up of Griffith. The\nmajority first requested that the parties brief whether Griffith was correctly decided in\nHoover v Mich Mut Ins Co, 485 Mich 881 (2009), but that case was subsequently\ndismissed after a settlement, Hoover v Mich Mut Ins Co, 485 Mich 1036 (2010).\nHowever, the majority wasted little time in finding another case to use as a vehicle for\nreconsidering Griffith.\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\fContinental Ins Co, 473 Mich 457; 703 NW2d 23 (2005);46 and Rowland v Washtenaw\n\nCo Rd Comm, 477 Mich 197; 731 NW2d 41 (2007).47\n\n       The new majority once purported to be concerned about the stability of the law,48\n\nbut that concern appears to have passed with the passing of the former majority. Indeed,\n\nit is difficult to consider anything more destabilizing to the law than to have the majority\n\nissue multiple orders continually requesting that the parties brief whether recently\n\ndecided cases have been properly decided. Justices who once postured as champions of\n\nstare decisis now cannot act quickly enough to reverse disfavored precedents. The\n\nmajority’s past claims of fealty to stare decisis were greatly exaggerated, and obviously\n\nnothing more than a function of their opposition to particular decisions being decided by\n\nthe Court at the time.\n\n                         4. HYPOCRISY AND STARE DECISIS\n\n       The majority accuses the dissenting justices of hypocrisy with regard to our stare\n\ndecisis criticisms of the majority.\n\n\n\n       46\n        This Court’s grant order in Idalski v Schwedt, 486 Mich 916 (2010), inquired\n“whether Rory v Continental Ins Co, 473 Mich 457 (2005), should be reconsidered.”\n       47\n         This Court’s grant order in Pollard v Suburban Mobility Auth, 486 Mich 963\n(2010), inquired “whether this Court should reconsider Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd\nComm, 477 Mich 197 (2007).”\n       48\n          See, e.g., People v Davis, 472 Mich 156, 190; 695 NW2d 45 (2005), where\nthen-Justice KELLY opined in dissent that overruling cases “destabilizes our state’s\njurisprudence. It suggests to the public that the law is at the whim of whoever is sitting\non the Supreme Court bench. Surely, it erodes the public’s confidence in our judicial\nsystem.”\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\f             The dissenters’ stare decisis protestations should taste like ashes in\n      their mouths. To the principles of stare decisis, to which they paid\n      absolutely no heed as they denigrated the wisdom of innumerable\n      predecessors, the dissenters now would wrap themselves in its benefits to\n      save their recent precedent. [Ante at __.]\n\nHowever, the position of the dissenting justices on stare decisis has not changed a whit\n\nsince we were in the majority; by contrast, the position of the majority justices is\n\nunrecognizable.\n\n       It has always been our position that stare decisis is not an “inexorable command,”\n\nand that a judge’s primary obligation is to the law and the constitution, not to the\n\njudgments of his or her predecessors. To that end, we have always asserted that there are\n\nmultiple judicial values that must be assessed in any case in which previous decisions of\n\nthe Court are implicated. In every such case, a judge must respectfully consider the\n\ninterests served by stare decisis-- predictability and certainty in the law, and the\n\nuniformity of its application. However, in every such case, a judge must also consider\n\nthe interests served by interpreting the law correctly-- regard for the lawmaker, adherence\n\nto constitutional dictates concerning the “judicial power” and the separation of powers,\n\nand competing predictability and certainty interests that are served where the law means\n\nwhat it plainly says. Robinson, 462 Mich at 464-468. As we explained in Robinson:\n\n              [I]t is well to recall in discussing reliance, when dealing with an area\n       of the law that is statutory . . . , that it is to the words of the statute itself\n       that a citizen first looks for guidance in directing his actions. This is the\n       essence of the rule of law: to know in advance what the rules of society are.\n       Thus, if the words of the statute are clear, the actor should be able to\n       expect, that is, rely, that they will be carried out by all in society, including\n       the courts. In fact, should a court confound those legitimate citizen\n       expectations by misreading or misconstruing a statute, it is that court itself\n       that has disrupted the reliance interest. When that happens, a subsequent\n\n\n                                              51\n\f       court, rather than holding to the distorted reading because of the doctrine of\n       stare decisis, should overrule the earlier court’s misconstruction. The\n       reason for this is that the court in distorting the statute was engaged in a\n       form of judicial usurpation that runs counter to the bedrock principle of\n       American constitutionalism, i.e., that the lawmaking power is reposed in\n       the people as reflected in the work of the Legislature, and, absent a\n       constitutional violation, the courts have no legitimacy in overruling or\n       nullifying the people’s representatives. Moreover, not only does such a\n       compromising by a court of the citizen’s ability to rely on a statute have no\n       constitutional warrant, it can gain no higher pedigree as later courts repeat\n       the error. [Id. at 467-468.]\n\nThat has been the consistent approach of the dissenting justices, and this continues to be\n\nour approach. Respect for stare decisis is a critical judicial value, but so is a regard for\n\nthe constitutional processes of government by which a judge strives to interpret the law in\n\naccordance with its actual language. Balancing these values is sometimes difficult, and\n\nreasonable people can often disagree as to how this balance should be struck. Robinson\n\nsupplies one attempt at identifying the factors that courts have traditionally looked to in\n\nstriking this balance in a consistent and reasonable manner. Despite suggestions to the\n\ncontrary, Robinson does not establish a “mechanical” process, but simply attempts to\n\nafford reasonable guidance in achieving a fair equilibrium between stare decisis and\n\ngetting the law right.49\n\n       However, as explained above, the justices now in the majority who were on the\n\nCourt at the time took a quite different approach to stare decisis when they were in the\n\nminority. As Justice YOUNG has explained:\n\n       49\n          Given that it has always been our position that Robinson does not establish a\n“mechanical” process, it is not surprising that the majority has been able to identify a\nsingle case in which we overruled precedent without specifically citing Robinson.\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\f              [Our] position on stare decisis has not changed, and the [the\n       majority] attempts to shift focus to [us] in order to avoid confronting [their]\n       own inconsistency. The public should understand when Justices’ positions\n       on important matters shift. And that is the focus of this dissent: when the\n       [majority] justice[s] [were] in the minority, [they] liked stare decisis a lot;\n       now that [they are] in the majority, it is not an issue. That is the “irony” the\n       public should understand. [Anglers, __ Mich at __ (2010) (YOUNG, J.,\n       dissenting), order entered June 18, 2010 (Docket Nos. 138863 to 138866).]\n\nThe majority entirely misapprehends our criticism of its record on stare decisis if it thinks\n\nthat we are simply counting the number of occasions on which they have reversed\n\nprecedent over the past term and a half. That is not our intention at all. We freely\n\nacknowledge that we too reversed precedents when we were in the majority-- although\n\nhardly at their remarkable pace. That is not the nub of our critique. Rather, the nub is:\n\n(a) that the majority justices have demonstrated a remarkably inconsistent and “flexible”\n\nattitude toward stare decisis, in which their views on the subject appear to be nothing\n\nmore than a function of whether they are in the majority or the minority; and (b) that the\n\nmajority justices equate their own reversals of precedent, in which they have widened the\n\ndistance between the law of the lawmaker and the law of the court, with the previous\n\nmajority’s reversals in which we did the opposite.\n\n       “[N]o meaningful discussion of a court’s attitude toward precedent can be based\n\nsolely on an arithmetical analysis in which raw numbers of overrulings are simply\n\ncounted. Such an analysis obscures that not all precedents are built alike, that some are\n\nbetter reasoned than others, that some are grounded in the exercise of discretionary\n\njudgments and others in the interpretation of plain language, that some are thorough in\n\ntheir analyses and others superficial.” Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, 477 Mich\n\n\n\n                                             53\n\f197, 226; 731 NW2d 41 (2007) (MARKMAN, J., concurring). The chart set forth in\n\nRowland demonstrates, we believe, that the overrulings of precedent that occurred\n\nbetween January 1, 2000 until Rowland was decided on May 2, 2007 “overwhelmingly\n\ncame in cases involving what the justices in the majority [at that time] view[ed] as the\n\nmisinterpretation of straightforward words and phrases in statutes and contracts, in which\n\nwords that were not there were read into the law or words that were there were read out\n\nof the law.” Id. That is, these reversals of precedent sought more closely to equate our\n\nstate’s caselaw with our statutes, while the reversals of precedent of the present majority\n\nhave achieved exactly the opposite.\n\n      Thus, the present majority has regard neither for precedent nor for the most\n\nsignificant competing value that would sometimes warrant overturning a precedent, to\n\nwit, that it is not in accord with the words of the lawmaker. In the end, the majority’s\n\napproach to stare decisis is empty and incoherent.       The majority has unsettled the\n\nprecedents of this Court at a Guinness world’s record pace, and it has done so while\n\ndisserving both the values of stare decisis and that of a court acting in accordance with\n\nthe constitutional separation of powers to respect the decisions of the lawmaker. The\n\nmajority has run amuck in service of values that have no grounding in either stare decisis,\n\nor in any other conception of the “judicial power,” other than that they comprise an\n\narithmetical majority of this Court. In this regard, the majority confuses power and\n\nauthority. The majority unsettles and confuses the law both in its disregard for this\n\nCourt’s previous decisions and in its equal disregard for the language of the law. It\n\ncompounds the confusion it fosters in one realm with the confusion that it fosters in the\n\n\n                                            54\n\fother.50 There is no saving grace in its reversals of precedent, no balancing of difficult\n\njudicial principles, no apparent recognition of the values served by either of the\n\ncompeting considerations involved where precedents are at issue, and no thoughtful effort\n\nto articulate even the roughest principles for its actions. In its destructive march through\n\nthe caselaw of this state to identify surviving and straggling decisions that need to be\n\n“taken out,” the majority furthers no discernible legal value of any kind, other than\n\nlitigation and still more litigation. In the end, there is no legal core to the majority’s\n\napproach to stare decisis, and it is left with nothing other than a feeble effort to equate its\n\nown actions with those of the dissenting justices when they were in the majority. “We\n\nare no worse than you,” is the majority’s banner, when in truth the majority has not the\n\nslightest conception of our approach to stare decisis, and not the slightest conception of\n\nthe damage that their own approach to stare decisis is doing to the citizens of this state\n\nwho wish to act in accordance with the law and who wish to understand their rights and\n\nobligations under that law.\n\n                      F. UNDOING THE LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE\n\n       As discussed earlier, although virtually all legislation involves some sort of\n\ncompromise, the no-fault act, in particular, entailed a substantial and well-understood\n\n\n       50\n         See, for example, The Detroit News, Ruling Clouds Pot Smoking, Driving Law,\nJuly 29, 2010 (indicating that the majority’s recent overruling of Derror in Feezel “has\npolice officers scratching their heads in confusion”; “The ruling mostly leaves law\nenforcement officers in a legal limbo, said Sgt. Christopher Hawkins, legislative liaison\nfor the state police.”). <http://www.detnews.com/article/20100729/METRO/7290387#\nixzz0v6dvSnGK> (accessed July 29, 2010).\n\n\n\n                                              55\n\fcompromise. In exchange for the payment of economic loss benefits from one’s own\n\ninsurance company (first-party benefits), the Legislature limited an injured person’s\n\nability to sue a negligent operator or owner of a motor vehicle for noneconomic losses\n\n(third-party benefits). Kreiner, 471 Mich at 114-115. As stated in Stephens v Dixon, 449\n\nMich 531, 541; 536 NW2d 755 (1995): “It was a specific purpose of the Legislature in\n\nenacting the Michigan no-fault act to partially abolish tort remedies for injuries sustained\n\nin motor vehicle accidents and to substitute for those remedies an entitlement to first-\n\nparty insurance benefits.”\n\n              At least two reasons are evident concerning why the Legislature\n       limited recovery for noneconomic loss, both of which relate to the\n       economic viability of the system. First, there was the problem of the\n       overcompensation of minor injuries. Second, there were the problems\n       incident to the excessive litigation of motor vehicle accident cases.\n       Regarding the second problem, if noneconomic losses were always to be a\n       matter subject to adjudication under the act, the goal of reducing motor\n       vehicle accident litigation would likely be illusory. The combination of the\n       costs of continuing litigation and continuing overcompensation for minor\n       injuries could easily threaten the economic viability, or at least desirability,\n       of providing so many benefits without regard to fault. If every case is\n       subject to the potential of litigation on the question of noneconomic loss,\n       for which recovery is still predicated on negligence, perhaps little has been\n       gained by granting benefits for economic loss without regard to fault.\n\n            Regarding the trade-off involved in no-fault acts, 7 Am Jur 2d,\n       Automobile Insurance, § 340, p 1068, contains the following:\n\n              “It has been said of one such plan that the practical effect of the\n       adoption of personal injury protection insurance is to afford the citizen the\n       security of prompt and certain recovery to a fixed amount of the most\n       salient elements of his out-of-pocket expenses * * *. In return for this\n       he surrenders the possibly minimal damages for pain and suffering\n       recoverable in cases not marked by serious economic loss or objective\n       indicia of grave injury, and also surrenders the outside chance that through\n       a generous settlement or a liberal award by a judge or jury in such a case he\n\n\n\n                                             56\n\f       may be able to reap a monetary windfall out of his misfortune.” (Footnotes\n       omitted.)\n\n       Thus, it is apparent that the threshold requirements for a traditional tort\n       action for noneconomic loss play an important role in the functioning of the\n       no-fault act. [Cassidy, 415 Mich at 500-501.]\n\nAccordingly, there is no question that the legislative compromise that produced the no-\n\nfault act recognized that some injuries would not be considered sufficient to meet the no-\n\nfault threshold. While every injury resulting from a motor vehicle accident certainly has\n\nadverse consequences, and may involve medical costs, treatment, and bodily pain, not all\n\ninjuries rise to the level of the no-fault threshold of a “serious impairment of a body\n\nfunction.” Some injured persons are able to recover noneconomic damages, so that all\n\ninjured persons are able to recover economic loss benefits regardless of fault. Otherwise,\n\n“little has been gained by granting benefits for economic loss without regard to fault.”\n\nId. at 500. Indeed, “the excessive litigation of motor vehicle accident cases” would\n\ncontinue, and, yet, economic loss benefits would have to be paid regardless of fault. Id.\n\nIn other words, plaintiffs would be able to recover economic loss benefits regardless of\n\nfault and without having to go to a jury, while these same plaintiffs would also be able to\n\ngo to a jury and seek noneconomic benefits as well. That is not the compromise reached\n\nby the Legislature. In particular, it is a lose-lose proposition for those funding the no-\n\nfault system, i.e., all insured Michigan drivers.51\n\n\n       51\n         The majority argues that the legislative compromise of 1973 which led to the\nadoption of the no-fault act itself cannot be cited to trump the 1995 enactment of MCL\n500.3135(7). We agree, but it is our position that the 1995 enactment of MCL\n500.3135(7), which in large measure rejected DiFranco, and made it more difficult for\n\n\n                                              57\n\f       In addition, it has been repeatedly recognized that, due to the mandatory nature of\n\nno-fault insurance, the Legislature intended that its cost be affordable. Shavers, 402\n\nMich at 599 (“The Legislature has . . . fostered the expectation that no-fault insurance\n\nwill be available at fair and equitable rates.”).52 Indeed, because it is mandatory, it must\n\nbe affordable.    Id. at 600 (“We therefore conclude that Michigan motorists are\n\nconstitutionally entitled to have no-fault insurance made available on a fair and equitable\n\nbasis.”). It is a matter of economic logic that in order to maintain a system in which\n\nmotor vehicle accident victims are able to receive economic loss benefits regardless of\n\nfault, drivers must be required to purchase insurance, and in order to ensure that drivers\n\npurchase this insurance, it must be kept affordable. The majority’s decision, however,\n\nvery considerably “lowers the bar” that an injured plaintiff must satisfy in order to meet\n\nthe serious impairment of body function threshold, making it significantly easier for a\n\n\nplaintiffs to prevail in noneconomic loss benefit cases, is entirely consistent with the\ncompromise. The majority’s opinion is not in accord with either the compromise or\nMCL 500.3135(7).\n       52\n         See, e.g., Tebo v Havlik, 418 Mich 350, 366; 343 NW2d 181 (1984) (opinion by\nBRICKLEY, J.) (recognizing that a primary goal of the no-fault act is to “provid[e] an\nequitable and prompt method of redressing injuries in a way which made the mandatory\ninsurance coverage affordable to all motorists”); Celina Mut Ins Co v Lake States Ins Co,\n452 Mich 84, 89; 549 NW2d 834 (1996) (holding that “the no-fault insurance system . . .\nis designed to provide victims with assured, adequate, and prompt reparations at the\nlowest cost to both the individuals and the no-fault system”); O’Donnell v State Farm\nMut Auto Ins Co, 404 Mich 524, 547; 273 NW2d 829 (1979) (recognizing that the\nLegislature has provided for setoffs in the no-fault act: “Because the first-party insurance\nproposed by the act was to be compulsory, it was important that the premiums to be\ncharged by the insurance companies be maintained as low as possible[;] [o]therwise, the\npoor and the disadvantaged people of the state might not be able to obtain the necessary\ninsurance”).\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\fplaintiff to recover for noneconomic losses. This means insurance companies that issue\n\nno-fault policies will be financially obligated in more cases, and, as a result, will be\n\nrequired to pass along their increased costs to policyholders by way of increased\n\npremiums charged to Michigan drivers.53 Today’s decision, just as last term’s decision\n\nby the new majority in United States Fidelity Ins & Guaranty Co v Mich Catastrophic\n\nClaims Ass’n (On Rehearing), 484 Mich 1; __ NW2d __ (2008),54 will eventually result\n\nin a substantial increase in premiums paid for their mandatory no-fault policies.55\n\n\n\n       53\n          In Univ of Mich v Titan Ins Co, __ Mich __; __ NW2d __ (2010), the majority\nhas overruled Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 476 Mich 55; 718 NW2d 784 (2006).\nThis overruling will also lead to significant cost increases to no-fault policies. Indeed,\ndefendant Titan Insurance Company argued that overruling Cameron would have\n“devastating affects” on the orderly adjustment of no-fault claims and “threaten the\nviability” of the Michigan Assigned Claims Facility and the Michigan Catastrophic\nClaims Association because the gutting of the one-year back rule will lead to a flood of\ndecades old no-fault claims seeking expensive family attendant care benefits. In addition,\nin Hoover v Mich Mut Ins Co, 485 Mich 881 (2009), the majority has asked the parties to\nbrief whether Griffith v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 472 Mich 521; 697 NW2d 895\n(2005), “was correctly decided.” No-fault insurance costs can be expected to rise even\nfurther if the majority overrules Griffith, which considered the parameters of an\n“allowable expense” under MCL 500.3107(1)(a).\n       54\n          As a consequence of the majority’s decision in United States Fidelity Ins &\nGuaranty Co (On Rehearing), the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association\nsubstantially increased the mandatory annual assessment no-fault policy holders must pay\nto the Association. According to the MCCA’s own website, the annual assessment has\nincreased forty percent in the last two years (from $104.58 per insured vehicle effective\nJuly 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009 to $143.09 per insured vehicle effective July 1, 2010 to\nJune 30, 2011.). <http://www.michigancatastrophic.com> (accessed June 28, 2010).\n       55\n         As stated in Justice YOUNG’s dissent in United States Fidelity Ins & Guaranty\nCo, 484 Mich at 26, this increase in premiums is not pertinent to our analysis of the\nsubstantive issue beyond making the point that the majority is undoing the compromise\nembodied by the no-fault act. But having lost the battle with the majority over the legal\n\n\n                                            59\n\f       Every owner of a car that is driven on a public highway must buy certain basic\n\ncoverages in order to register the vehicle and obtain license plates. MCL 500.3101(1).\n\nThe Legislature has provided two incentives to ensure that owners purchase the required\n\ninsurance. First, it is a misdemeanor to drive a motor vehicle without basic no-fault\n\ncoverage. Under MCL 500.3102(2), if someone is convicted of driving without basic no-\n\nfault insurance coverage, he or she can be fined up to $500, incarcerated in jail for up to\n\none year, or both.    Second, the no-fault act precludes receipt of no-fault personal\n\nprotection benefits if at the time of the accident the person was the owner or registrant of\n\nan uninsured motor vehicle involved in the accident.                  MCL 500.3113(b).\n\nNotwithstanding this criminal sanction, and this potential preclusion of no-fault benefits,\n\nit is estimated that 17 percent56 of Michigan’s approximately eight million motor\n\nvehicles57 are still operated without a no-fault policy in effect. With such mandatory\n\n\nanalysis of the no-fault statute, the financial consequences of the majority’s decision\nshould not go unremarked.\n       56\n           According to the Insurance Institute of Michigan’s 2009 Fact Book, the\nInsurance Research Council (IRC) released a study in 2008 estimating Michigan’s\nuninsured motorists rate at 17 percent. <http://www.iiminfo.org/Portals/44/Fact%\n20Book%204%20Auto%20(19-29).pdf> (accessed June 28, 2010). Indeed, according to\na July 11, 2010 editorial in the Detroit News, “Statistics suggest more than half the\ndrivers in Detroit ignore state law by driving without coverage because they can’t afford\nthe premiums. That’s a problem for their fellow motorists and for the state.”\n<http://detnews.com/article/20100711/OPINION01/7110316/1008/OPINION01/With-\ncredit-scoring-issue-decided--policymakers-should-explore-other-ways-to-trim-auto-\ninsurance-costs#ixzz0tUKFqijI> (accessed July 14, 2010).\n       57\n         According to the Insurance Institute of Michigan, as of 2008, Michigan had 8.2\nmillion registered motor vehicles. <http://www.iiminfo.org/ Portals/44/registered%\n20vehicles%2008.pdf> (accessed June 28, 2010).\n\n\n\n                                            60\n\fpolicies now becoming even more expensive, one can also reasonably anticipate a\n\ncorresponding increase in the already large number of uninsured vehicles being driven on\n\nour roads and highways.\n\n       The majority’s decision will not only result in increased automobile insurance\n\npremiums, and more uninsured vehicles on our roads and highways, but it will also mean\n\nthat substantially more lawsuits will be filed, even though an express goal of the no-fault\n\nact was to reduce “excessive litigation of motor vehicle accident cases.” Cassidy, 415\n\nMich at 500. Yet, under the majority’s opinion, more lawsuits will make their way to\n\njuries for the consideration of noneconomic loss benefits, straining our already\n\noverburdened courts.58 As it is, no-fault automobile negligence cases remain a dominant\n\n\n       58\n          If one reviews the new majority’s decisions, it is difficult not to conclude that\nthe only coherent theme of their jurisprudence is the fostering of litigation. They have\nvirtually guaranteed as much by introducing uncertainty, doubt and confusion into the\nlaw, and by gratuitously interjecting irrelevant considerations into their opinions. See,\ne.g., O’Neal, __ Mich at __ (gratuitously calling into question the viability of Wickens v\nOakwood Healthcare Sys, 465 Mich 53; 631 NW2d 686 (2001), a case having no\nrelevance to that dispute); Zahn v Kroger Co, 483 Mich 34; 764 NW2d 207 (2009)\n(gratuitously observing that the parties to the contract were business entities “with equal\nbargaining power,” as if the latter circumstance, not at all relevant in that case, might be\nrelevant in a different case); Anglers, __ Mich at __, order entered June 18, 2010 (Docket\nNos. 138863 to 138866 (refusing to dismiss a moot case); Scott v State Farm Mut Auto\nIns Co, 483 Mich 1032; 766 NW2d 273 (2009) (relaxing the causal connection that must\nexist between an injury sustained and the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor\nvehicle in no-fault cases); Decosta v Gossage, 486 Mich 116; __ NW2d __ (2010)\n(refusing to enforce notice-of-intent requirements under MCL 600.2912b(2); Chambers v\nWayne Co Airport Auth, 483 Mich 1081; 765 NW2d 890 (2009), Beasley v Michigan,\n483 Mich 1025, 1025-1027; 765 NW2d 608 (2009), and Ward v Michigan State Univ,\n485 Mich 917; 773 NW2d 666 (2009) (refusing to enforce pre-litigation notice\nrequirements); Adair v Mich, __ Mich __; __ NW2d __ (2010) (reducing a Headlee\nAmendment plaintiff’s burden of proof); Lansing Sch Educ Ass'n v Lansing Bd of Educ,\n__ Mich __ ; __ NW2d __ (2010) (nullifying historic standards for determining whether a\n\n\n                                            61\n\ffactor in Michigan civil filings every year. Indeed, of the 47,300 new civil case filings in\n\nMichigan circuit courts in 2009, 9,067-- approximately 20 percent of all civil cases--\n\nwere automobile related.59 Given that many no-fault claims are settled without the filing\n\nof a lawsuit, the number of claims potentially affected by the majority’s ruling is even\n\nhigher.\n\n       The majority’s decision will also increase costs incurred by the state of Michigan\n\nitself (and, of course, the taxpayers who fund those costs). In the course of arguing that\n\nKreiner should not be overruled because it “clarifies rather than expands the statutory\n\nlanguage,” the Attorney General’s amicus brief warns that if Kreiner is overruled, as a\n\n\n\n\nplaintiff has “standing” to bring a lawsuit); Univ of Mich v Titan Ins Co, __ Mich __; __\nNW2d __ (2010) (eroding the no-fault act’s one-year-back rule); O’Neal, supra\n(concluding that whichever lost-opportunity formula benefits the plaintiff the most in any\nparticular case is the correct formula to be utilized); Vanslembrouck v Halperin, 483\nMich 965; 763 NW2d 919 (2009) (incorrectly characterizing MCL 600.5851(7) as a\nstatute of limitations that can be tolled rather than a savings provision that cannot be\ntolled); Sazima v Shepherd Bar & Restaurant, 483 Mich 924; 762 NW2d 924 (2009)\n(expanding what injuries can be considered to have occurred “in the course of\nemployment” for purposes of worker’s compensation); and the 2010 amendments of\nMCR 2.112 and MCR 2.118 (undermining affidavit of merit requirements). In the instant\ncase, of course, the majority, by undermining the no-fault compromise struck by the\nLegislature, makes it easier for plaintiffs to sue for noneconomic loss benefits.\n       59\n          See 2009 Annual Report of the Michigan Supreme Court, pps 35-36.\n<http://www.courts.michigan.gov/scao/resources/publications/statistics/2009/2009execsu\nm.pdf> (accessed June 28, 2010).\n\n\n\n                                            62\n\fself-insured entity, the state will realize “a direct, significant increase in the cost of its\n\nlitigation and coverage obligations.”60\n\n       Finally, and as a consequence of all of the above, the majority’s decision will\n\nalmost certainly call into question the long-term economic integrity of the present no-\n\nfault system in Michigan. By nullifying the legislative compromise that was struck when\n\nthe no-fault act was adopted-- a compromise grounded in concerns over excessive\n\nlitigation, the over-compensation of minor injuries, and the availability of affordable\n\ninsurance-- the Court’s decision today will restore a legal environment in which each of\n\nthese hazards reappear and threaten the continued fiscal soundness of our no-fault\n\nsystem.61\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       The no-fault automobile insurance act, MCL 500.3135(1), provides that “[a]\n\nperson remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss caused by his or her\n\nownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the injured person has suffered\n\ndeath, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.” The\n\nissue here is whether plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function.\n\n\n       60\n          It was reported that, as of 2007, the state vehicle fleet totaled 11,856.\n<http://www.greatlakeswiki.org/index.php/Michigan_state_fleet_efficiency> (accessed\nJune 28, 2010).\n       61\n          I reiterate that expected increases in no-fault premiums are not pertinent to our\nanalysis of the legal issues in this case, beyond making the point that the majority is\nundoing the legislative compromise embodied by the no-fault act and that there will be\nsignificant practical consequences to doing this.\n\n\n\n                                             63\n\f“‘[S]erious impairment of body function’ means an objectively manifested impairment of\n\nan important body function that affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life.” MCL 500.3135(7).\n\n       In Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132-133, this Court held that in determining whether the\n\nimpairment affects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life, “a court should\n\nengage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiff’s life before and after the\n\naccident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiff’s\n\noverall life.” In addition, Kreiner indicated that certain factors, such as the duration of\n\nthe impairment, may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiff’s general ability\n\nto lead his normal life has been affected. Id. at 133.\n\n       The majority overrules Kreiner, rejecting these factors and holding that temporal\n\nconsiderations are wholly or largely irrelevant in determining whether an impairment\n\naffects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his or her normal life.        The majority\n\napparently holds instead that as long as a plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life\n\nhas been affected for even a single moment in time, the plaintiff has suffered a serious\n\nimpairment of body function. This conclusion is at odds with the actual language of the\n\nstatute and nullifies the legislative compromise embodied in the no-fault act. Because I\n\nbelieve that Kreiner was correctly decided and that temporal considerations are, in fact,\n\nhighly relevant, and indeed necessary, in determining whether an impairment affects the\n\nplaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life, I would sustain Kreiner. By nullifying\n\nthe legislative compromise over the no-fault act-- a compromise grounded in concerns\n\nover excessive litigation, the over-compensation of minor injuries, and the availability of\n\n\n                                             64\n\faffordable insurance-- the Court’s decision today will revive a legal environment in\n\nwhich each of these hazards reappear and threaten the continued fiscal integrity of our\n\nno-fault system.\n\n      Because I do not believe that the lower courts erred in concluding that plaintiff has\n\nnot suffered a serious impairment of body function, I would affirm the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals.\n\n\n      CORRIGAN and YOUNG, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                           65\n\f",

We hold\n\n that Kreiner v Fischer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848694\"><a href=\"/opinion/848694/kreiner-v-fischer/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 683 NW2d 611 (2004), was wrongly decided\n\n because it departed from the plain language of MCL 500.3135, and is therefore overruled.\n\fWe further hold that, in this case, as a matter of law, plaintiff suffered a serious\n\nimpairment of a body function. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case to the trial\n\ncourt for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                            I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n       This case arises out of an injury that plaintiff, Rodney McCormick, suffered while\n\nworking as a medium truck loader at a General Motors Corporation (GM) plant.1\n\nPlaintiff’s job mainly consisted of assisting in the loading of trucks, which required\n\nclimbing up and around trucks and trailers, standing, walking, and heavy lifting. He\n\ngenerally worked nine- to ten-hour shifts, six days a week.\n\n       On January 17, 2005, a coworker backed a truck into plaintiff, knocking him over,\n\nand then drove over plaintiff’s left ankle. Plaintiff was immediately taken to the hospital,\n\nand x-rays showed a fracture of his left medial malleolus.2 Plaintiff was released from\n\nthe hospital that day, and two days later metal hardware was surgically inserted into his\n\nankle to stabilize plaintiff’s bone fragments. Plaintiff was restricted from weight-bearing\n\nactivities for one month after the surgery and then underwent multiple months of physical\n\ntherapy. The metal hardware was removed in a second surgery on October 21, 2005.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          The only defendant remaining at this point in the case is GM’s indemnitor,\nAllied Automotive Group, Inc, because the parties have stipulated the release of the other\noriginal defendants. For simplicity’s sake, the opinion will use “defendant” to refer to\nthis entity.\n       2\n         The medial malleolus is the bony prominence that protrudes from the medial side\nof the ankle. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary (26th ed).\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       At defendant’s request, plaintiff underwent a medical evaluation with Dr. Paul\n\nDrouillard in November 2005. He indicated that plaintiff could return to work but was\n\nrestricted from prolonged standing or walking. On January 12, 2006, the specialist who\n\nperformed plaintiff’s surgeries cleared him to return to work without restrictions. The\n\nspecialist’s report noted that plaintiff had an “excellent range of motion,” and an x-ray\n\nshowed “solid healing with on [sic] degenerative joint disease of his ankle.”\n\n       Beginning on January 16, 2006, plaintiff returned to work as a medium truck\n\nloader for several days, but he had difficulty walking, climbing, and crouching because of\n\ncontinuing ankle pain. He requested that his job duties be restricted to driving, but\n\ndefendant directed him to cease work.\n\n       Defendant required plaintiff to undergo a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) in\n\nMarch 2006. The FCE determined that plaintiff was unable to perform the range of tasks\n\nhis job required, including stooping, crouching, climbing, sustained standing, and heavy\n\nlifting. This was due to ankle and shoulder pain,3 a moderate limp, and difficulty bearing\n\nweight on his left ankle. The report stated that plaintiff’s range of motion in his left ankle\n\nwas not within normal limits and that difficulty climbing and lifting weights had been\n\nreported and observed.\n\n       In May 2006, Dr. Drouillard examined plaintiff again and reported that plaintiff\n\ncould return to work. Dr. Drouillard’s report stated that plaintiff complained of ankle and\n\n\n       3\n         Plaintiff had a pre-existing back and shoulder injury that is unrelated to the\nincident in this case.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\ffoot pain, but the doctor found “no objective abnormality to correspond with his\n\nsubjective complaints.” In June 2006, plaintiff also underwent a magnetic resonance\n\nimaging (MRI) test, which showed some postoperative scar and degenerative tissue\n\nformation around his left ankle. At plaintiff’s request, another FCE was performed on\n\nAugust 1, 2006, which affirmed that plaintiff could return to work without restriction and\n\nwas capable of performing the tasks required for his job. The report stated that plaintiff\n\ncomplained of “occasional aching” and tightness in his ankle, but it did not appear to be\n\naggravated by activities such as prolonged standing or walking.          It also noted that\n\nplaintiff’s range of motion in his left ankle was still not within normal limits, although it\n\nhad improved since the March 2006 FCE.\n\n       Plaintiff returned to work on August 16, 2006, 19 months after he suffered his\n\ninjury. He volunteered to be assigned to a different job, and his pay was not reduced. He\n\nhas been able to perform his new job since that time.\n\n       On March 24, 2006, plaintiff filed suit, seeking recovery for his injuries under\n\nMCL 500.3135. In his October 2006 deposition, plaintiff testified that at the time of the\n\nincident, he was a 49-year-old man and his normal life before the incident mostly\n\nconsisted of working 60 hours a week as a medium-duty truck loader. He stated that he\n\nalso was a “weekend golfer” and frequently fished in the spring and summer from a boat\n\nthat he owns. He testified that he was fishing at pre-incident levels by the spring and\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fsummer of 2006, but he has only golfed once since he returned to work.4 He stated that\n\nhe can drive and take care of his personal needs without assistance and that his\n\nrelationship with his wife has not been affected. He stated that he has not sought medical\n\ntreatment for his ankle since January 2006, when he was approved to return to work\n\nwithout restriction. He further testified that his life is “painful, but normal,” although it is\n\n“limited,” and he continues to experience ankle pain.\n\n       The trial court granted defendant’s motion for summary disposition on the basis\n\nthat plaintiff had recovered relatively well and could not meet the serious impairment\n\nthreshold provided in MCL 500.3135(1). The Court of Appeals affirmed, with one judge\n\ndissenting. McCormick v Carrier, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of\n\nAppeals, issued March 25, 2008 (Docket No. 275888). The majority held that, under\n\nKreiner, plaintiff’s impairment did not affect his ability to lead his normal life because he\n\nis able to care for himself, fish and golf, and work at the same rate of pay. The dissent\n\ndisagreed, arguing that two doctors had determined that the impairment would cause\n\n\n       4\n          There are no facts in the record regarding the extent to which plaintiff fished\nbetween January 2005 and January 2006 or the extent to which he was able to golf in the\nperiod between the incident and when he returned to work, despite the arguments to the\ncontrary by both parties and the dissent. Defendant has alleged that plaintiff was able to\nfish while he was not working, but the only factual support it cites is plaintiff’s statement\nthat he fished in the six or seven months after January 2006, which was when he was\ninitially cleared to return to work, and when he actually returned to work. Although\nplaintiff’s counsel agreed in the arguments before the trial court that plaintiff had been\nfishing, it was unclear as to what time period he was referring. In plaintiff’s brief to this\nCourt, he alleges that by the time of his deposition, he had “returned” to fishing with the\nsame frequency as before the accident, which suggests that plaintiff might be arguing that\nhis fishing activities were interrupted.\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fproblems over plaintiff’s entire life and his employer had determined that he could not\n\nperform his work duties, the main part of his “normal” life.\n\n       After initially denying leave to appeal, this Court granted plaintiff’s motion for\n\nreconsideration, vacated its prior order, and granted the application for leave to appeal.\n\nMcCormick v Carrier, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009).\n\n                             II.

ANALYSIS\n\n       The issue presented in this case is the proper interpretation of MCL 500.3135. We\n\nhold that Kreiner incorrectly interpreted MCL 500.3135 and is overruled because it is\n\ninconsistent with the statute’s plain language and this opinion. Further, under the proper\n\ninterpretation of the statute, plaintiff has demonstrated that, as a matter of law, he\n\nsuffered a serious impairment of body function.\n\n                          A. OVERVIEW OF MCL 500.3135\n\n       In 1973, the Michigan Legislature adopted the no-fault insurance act, MCL\n\n500.3101 et seq. The act created a compulsory motor vehicle insurance program under\n\nwhich insureds may recover directly from their insurers, without regard to fault, for\n\nqualifying economic losses arising from motor vehicle incidents. See MCL 500.3101 and\n\n500.3105. In exchange for ensuring certain and prompt recovery for economic loss, the\n\n\n                                             6\n\fact also limited tort liability.

The act was designed to remedy problems with the\n\ntraditional tort system as it relates to automobile accidents. These included that “[the\n\ncontributory negligence liability scheme] denied benefits to a high percentage of motor\n\nvehicle accident victims, minor injuries were overcompensated, serious injuries were\n\nundercompensated, long payment delays were commonplace, the court system was\n\noverburdened, and those with low income and little education suffered discrimination.”\n\nShavers v Attorney General, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106387\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106387/shavers-v-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).\n\n       Under the act, tort liability for non-economic loss arising out of the ownership,\n\nmaintenance, or use of a qualifying motor vehicle is limited to a list of enumerated\n\ncircumstances. MCL 500.3135(3). The act creates threshold requirements in MCL\n\n500.3135(1), which has remained unchanged in all key aspects since the act was adopted.\n\nThat subsection currently provides that “[a] person remains subject to tort liability for\n\nnoneconomic loss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle\n\nonly if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or\n\npermanent serious disfigurement.”\n\n       The threshold requirement at issue in this case is whether plaintiff has suffered\n\n“serious impairment of body function.” The act did not originally define this phrase.\n\nAccordingly, it initially fell to this Court to do so, and the result was a series of differing\n\nopinions. In Cassidy v McGovern, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192768\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192768/cassidy-v-mcgovern/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), this Court held\n\nthat whether the serious impairment threshold is met is a question of law for the court to\n\ndecide where there is no material disputed fact. Id. at 502. It further held that in order to\n\n\n                                              7\n\fmeet the threshold, the plaintiff must show an objectively manifested injury and an\n\nimpairment of an important body function, which it defined as “an objective standard that\n\nlooks to the effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal life.” Id. at\n\n505. This Court later in part modified and in part affirmed Cassidy in DiFranco, supra.\n\nThe DiFranco Court agreed that a plaintiff had to suffer an objectively manifested injury,\n\nbut it rejected the Cassidy Court’s determination that the impairment needed to be\n\n“important” and its definition of “important.” DiFranco, 427 Mich at 61-67, 70-75. The\n\nDiFranco Court further held that whether the threshold is met is a question of law for the\n\ncourt only if there are no material disputed facts and the facts could not support\n\nconflicting inferences. Id. at 53-54.\n\n       In 1995, however, the Legislature intervened. It amended MCL 500.3135 to\n\ndefine a “serious impairment of body function” as “an objectively manifested impairment\n\nof an important body function that affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life.” MCL 500.3135(7). The Legislature also expressly provided that whether a\n\nserious impairment of body function has occurred is a “question[] of law” for the court to\n\ndecide unless there is a factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of injury and the\n\ndispute is relevant to deciding whether the standard is met.

A QUESTION OF LAW OR FACT UNDER MCL 500.3135(2)\n\n      The first step in interpreting MCL 500.3135 is to determine the proper role of a\n\ncourt in applying MCL 500.3135(1) and (7). The Legislature addressed this issue in the\n\namended MCL 500.3135(2)(a), which states in relevant part:\n\n          The issues of whether an injured person has suffered serious impairment\n      of body function or permanent serious disfigurement are questions of law\n      for the court if the court finds either of the following:\n\n          (i) There is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of\n      the person’s injuries.\n\n         (ii) There is a factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of\n      the person’s injuries, but the dispute is not material to the\n      determination as to whether the person has suffered a serious\n      impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement.\n\n      Under the plain language of the statute, the threshold question whether the person\n\nhas suffered a serious impairment of body function should be determined by the court as\n\na matter of law as long as there is no factual dispute regarding “the nature and extent of\n\nthe person’s injuries” that is material to determining whether the threshold standards are\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fmet.7 If there is a material factual dispute regarding the nature and extent of the person’s\n\ninjuries, the court should not decide the issue as a matter of law.8 Notably, the disputed\n\n\n       7\n          Notably, MCL 500.3135(2)(a) could unconstitutionally conflict with MCR\n2.116(C)(10) in those cases wherein a court is required to (1) resolve material, disputed\nfacts with regard to issues other than the nature and extent of the injury, such as the\nextent to which the injury actually impairs a body function or the injured party relied on\nthat function as part of his or her pre-accident life, or (2) decide whether the threshold is\nmet even though reasonable people could draw different conclusions from the facts.

Interestingly, the dissent states that it disagrees with the majority that there could\nbe a conflict between the statute and the court rule, but it also approvingly quotes\nDiFranco for the proposition that reasonable minds can often differ over the threshold\nissues in these cases.\n       8\n        This plain reading of the statute is not necessarily inconsistent with the Kreiner\nmajority’s interpretation of MCL 500.3135(2)(a), see Kreiner, 471 Mich at 131-132, but\nneither the majority nor dissent in Kreiner discussed the constitutionality of this\n\n\n                                             11\n\ffact does not need to be outcome determinative in order to be material, but it should be\n\n“significant or essential to the issue or matter at hand.” Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed)\n\n(defining “material fact”).\n\n                2. A “SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT OF BODY FUNCTION”\n                         UNDER MCL 500.3135(1) AND (7)\n\n       In those cases where the court may decide whether the serious impairment\n\nthreshold is met as a matter of law, the next issue is the proper interpretation of MCL\n\n500.3135(7). It provides that, for purposes of the section, a “serious impairment of body\n\nfunction” is “an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function that\n\naffects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life.” On its face, the\n\nstatutory language provides three prongs that are necessary to establish a “serious\n\nimpairment of body function”: (1) an objectively manifested impairment (2) of an\n\nimportant body function that (3) affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life.9\n\n       Overall, because we conclude that each of these prongs’ meaning is clear from the\n\nplain and unambiguous statutory language, judicial construction is neither required nor\n\n\n\nprovision. As noted in footnote 7 of this opinion, however, the manner in which Kreiner\ninterpreted the statute may be unconstitutional to the extent that it requires a court to\nusurp the role of the fact-finder. That issue is not presented on the facts of this case,\nhowever.\n       9\n         The Kreiner majority first addressed whether the impaired body function was\nimportant and then analyzed whether the impairment was objectively manifested. 471\nMich at 132-133. We find it more consistent with the statutory text to first address the\nobjectively manifested impairment requirement.\n\n\n\n                                           12\n\fpermitted. In re MCI, 460 Mich at 411. Notably, however, a dictionary may aid the\n\nCourt in giving the words and phrases in MCL 500.3135(7) their common meaning, and\n\nwhere the language used in MCL 500.3135(7) was originally adopted and interpreted in\n\nCassidy and DiFranco, it may be presumed that the Legislature intended the previous\n\njudicial interpretation to be relevant. Oakland Co Bd of Rd Comm’rs, 456 Mich at 604,\n\nand Wright, 432 Mich at 92. As will be discussed within, where the Kreiner majority’s\n\ninterpretation of these prongs is inconsistent with the clear language of the statute, we\n\nhold that Kreiner was wrongly decided. Most significantly, its interpretation of the third\n\nprong deviates dramatically from the statute’s text.\n\n                 a. AN OBJECTIVELY MANIFESTED IMPAIRMENT\n\n       Under the first prong, it must be established that the injured person has suffered an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of body function. The common meaning of “an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment” is apparent from the unambiguous statutory\n\nlanguage, with aid from a dictionary, and is consistent with the judicial interpretation of\n\n“objectively manifested” in Cassidy and DiFranco.         To the extent that the Kreiner\n\nmajority’s interpretation of this prong differs from this approach, it was wrongly decided.\n\n       To begin with, the adverb “objectively” is defined as “in an objective manner,”\n\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary (1966), and the adjective “objective” is\n\ndefined as “1. Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental\n\nconcept. 2. Having actual existence or reality. 3. a. Uninfluenced by emotion, surmise, or\n\npersonal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomena; presented factually . . . .” The\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982). It is defined specifically\n\n\n                                            13\n\fin the medical context as “[i]ndicating a symptom or condition perceived as a sign of\n\ndisease by someone other than the person afflicted.” Id.10 The verb “manifest” is defined\n\nas “1. To show or demonstrate plainly; reveal. 2. To be evidence of; prove.” Id. Overall,\n\nthese definitions suggest that the common meaning of “objectively manifested” in MCL\n\n500.3135(7) is an impairment that is evidenced by actual symptoms or conditions that\n\nsomeone other than the injured person would observe or perceive as impairing a body\n\nfunction.   In other words, an “objectively manifested” impairment is commonly\n\nunderstood as one observable or perceivable from actual symptoms or conditions.\n\n      Notably, MCL 500.3135(7) does not contain the word “injury,” and, under the\n\nplain language of the statute, the proper inquiry is whether the impairment is objectively\n\nmanifested, not the injury or its symptoms.11 This distinction is important because\n\n“injury” and “impairment” have different meanings. An “injury” is “1. Damage of or to a\n\nperson . . . 2. A wound or other specific damage.” The American Heritage Dictionary,\n\n\n      10\n          See also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1966), defining\n“objective,” in relevant part, as “publicly or intersubjectively observable or verifiable\nespecially by scientific methods: independent of what is personal or private in our\napprehension and feelings: of such nature that rational minds agree in holding it real or\ntrue or valid.” It also defines “objective” in the context “of a symptom of disease” as\n“perceptible to persons other than an affected individual.” Id. (italics omitted).\n      11\n          Accordingly, the Court of Appeals decisions that have gone beyond the plain\nlanguage of the statute and imposed an extra-textual “objectively manifested injury”\nrequirement, in clear contravention of Legislative intent, are overruled to the extent that\nthey are inconsistent with this opinion. See, e.g., Netter v Bowman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n305; 725 NW2d 353 (2006) (holding that “the current meaning of ‘objectively\nmanifested’ . . . requires that a plaintiff’s injury must be capable of objective\nverification”.\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fSecond College Edition (1982). “Impairment” is the “state of being impaired,” Webster’s\n\nThird New International Dictionary (1966), and to be “impaired” means being\n\n“weakened, diminished, or damaged” or “functioning poorly or inadequately.” Random\n\nHouse Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary (1998). These definitions show that while an\n\ninjury is the actual damage or wound, an impairment generally relates to the effect of that\n\ndamage. Accordingly, when considering an “impairment,” the focus “is not on the\n\ninjuries themselves, but how the injuries affected a particular body function.” DiFranco,\n\n427 Mich at 67.\n\n       Further, the pre-existing judicial interpretation of “objectively manifested” is\n\nconsistent with the plain language of the later-adopted statute. In Cassidy, this Court\n\nexplained that the serious impairment threshold was not met by pain and suffering alone,\n\nbut also required “injuries that affect the functioning of the body,” i.e., “objectively\n\nmanifested injuries.”    Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505.       In other words, Cassidy defined\n\n“objectively manifested” to mean affecting the functioning of the body.12 DiFranco\n\naffirmed this and further explained that the “objectively manifested” requirement\n\nsignifies that plaintiffs must “introduce evidence establishing that there is a physical basis\n\nfor their subjective complaints of pain and suffering” and that showing an impairment\n\ngenerally requires medical testimony. DiFranco, 427 Mich at 74.\n\n\n\n       12\n          Although the Legislature plainly rejected that it is the injury that should be\nobjectively manifested, as opposed to the impairment, the previous judicial construction\nof “objectively manifested” is still relevant.\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       The Kreiner majority’s interpretation of this language was only partially consistent\n\nwith the plain language of the statute.      It addressed this issue briefly, stating that\n\n“[s]ubjective complaints that are not medically documented are insufficient [to establish\n\nthat an impairment is objectively manifested].” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132. To the extent\n\nthat this is inconsistent with DiFranco’s statement that medical testimony will generally\n\nbe required to establish an impairment, it is at odds with the legislative intent expressed\n\nby the adoption of the “objectively manifested” language from DiFranco and Cassidy.\n\nThus, to the extent that Kreiner could be read to always require medical documentation, it\n\ngoes beyond the legislative intent expressed in the plain statutory text, and was wrongly\n\ndecided.\n\n                      b. OF AN IMPORTANT BODY FUNCTION\n\n       If there is an objectively manifested impairment of body function, the next\n\nquestion is whether the impaired body function is “important.” The common meaning of\n\nthis phrase is expressed in the unambiguous statutory language, although reference to a\n\ndictionary and limited reference to Cassidy is helpful.\n\n       The relevant definition of the adjective “important” is “[m]arked by or having\n\ngreat value, significance, or consequence.” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second\n\nCollege Edition (1982). See also Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary\n\n(1998), defining “important” in relevant part as “of much or great significance or\n\nconsequence,” “mattering much,” or “prominent or large.” Whether a body function has\n\ngreat “value,” “significance,” or “consequence” will vary depending on the person.\n\nTherefore, this prong is an inherently subjective inquiry that must be decided on a case-\n\n\n                                            16\n\fby-case basis, because what may seem to be a trivial body function for most people may\n\nbe subjectively important to some, depending on the relationship of that function to the\n\nperson’s life.\n\n       The “important body function” language was originally adopted in Cassidy, where\n\nthe Court stated that an “important” body function is not any body function but also does\n\nnot refer to the entire body function. Cassidy, 415 Mich at 504. This pre-existing\n\njudicial construction of “important body function” is consistent with the common\n\nmeaning of “important.”13\n\n       For this prong, the Kreiner majority’s interpretation appears to be consistent with\n\nthe plain language of the statute, as it only briefly stated that “[i]t is insufficient if the\n\nimpairment is of an unimportant body function.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132.14                If,\n\nhowever, the Kreiner majority’s position has been construed in a manner that is\n\ninconsistent with this opinion, then we disapprove of those constructions.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n           Cassidy also held that the importance of a body function is an objective\nstandard based on its effect on “the person’s general ability to live a normal life.”\nCassidy, 415 Mich at 505 (emphasis added). As discussed below, however, the\nLegislature specifically rejected the idea that the normal life evaluation should be\nobjective, and, thus, implicitly rejected Cassidy’s determination that whether a body\nfunction is “important” could be objectively determined outside the context of the\nperson’s actual life. Notably, DiFranco is inapposite because it rejected the “important\nbody function” test. DiFranco, 427 Mich at 61-62.\n       14\n         The Kreiner majority also apparently agreed that this is a subjective, case-by-\ncase inquiry. Kreiner, 471 Mich at 134 n 19.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f              c. THAT AFFECTS THE PERSON’S GENERAL ABILITY\n                     TO LEAD HIS OR HER NORMAL LIFE\n\n       Finally, if the injured person has suffered an objectively manifested impairment of\n\nbody function, and that body function is important to that person, then the court must\n\ndetermine whether the impairment “affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life.” The common meaning of this phrase is expressed by the unambiguous\n\nstatutory language, and its interpretation is aided by reference to a dictionary, reading the\n\nphrase within its statutory context, and limited reference to Cassidy.\n\n       To begin with, the verb “affect” is defined as “[t]o have an influence on; bring\n\nabout a change in.” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982).\n\nAn “ability” is “[t]he quality of being able to do something,” id., and “able” is defined as\n\n“having sufficient power, skill, or resources to accomplish an object.” Merriam-Webster\n\nOnline Dictionary, <http://www.merriam-webster.com> (accessed May 27, 2010). The\n\nadjective “general” means:\n\n              1. Relating to, concerned with, or applicable to the whole or every\n       member of a class or category. 2. Affecting or characteristic of the majority\n       of those involved; prevalent: a general discontent. 3. Being usually the\n       case; true or applicable in most instances but not all. 4. a. Not limited in\n       scope, area, or application: as a general rule. b. Not limited to one class of\n       things: general studies. 5. Involving only the main features of something\n       rather than details or particulars. 6. Highest or superior in rank.” [The\n       American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982).]\n\nThe sixth definition is obviously irrelevant, and the first definition of “general” does not\n\nmake sense in this context because a person’s “whole” ability to live his or her normal\n\nlife is surely not affected short of complete physical and mental incapacitation, which is\n\naccounted for in a different statutory threshold: death. The other definitions, however,\n\n\n                                             18\n\fmore or less convey the same meaning: that “general” does not refer to only one specific\n\ndetail or particular part of a thing, but, at least some parts of it. Thus, these definitions\n\nillustrate that to “affect” the person’s “general ability” to lead his or her normal life is to\n\ninfluence some of the person’s power or skill, i.e., the person’s capacity, to lead a normal\n\nlife.\n\n        The next question is the meaning of “to lead his or her normal life.” The verb\n\n“lead,” in this context, is best defined as “[t]o pass or go through; live.” The American\n\nHeritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982). Although the verb “lead” has many\n\ndefinitions, some of which have similar nuances, this definition is the most relevant\n\nbecause it expressly applies in the context of leading a certain type of life. Indeed, other\n\ndictionaries provide a similar definition with the same context, using a “type of life” as an\n\nexample.15 Similarly, “life” has multiple meanings, but one specifically references the\n\ncontext of leading a particular type of life, which is “[a] manner of living: led a good\n\nlife.” Id. Other definitions are similar, such as “[t]he physical, mental, and spiritual\n\nexperiences that constitute a person’s existence,” or “[h]uman existence or activity in\n\ngeneral.”    Id.   Given the contextual examples used in the dictionary, the common\n\nunderstanding of “to lead his or her normal life” is to live, or pass life, in his or her\n\nnormal manner of living.\n\n\n        15\n          See Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary (1998), defining “lead”\nas “to go through or pass (time, life, etc.): to lead a full life,” and Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary (1966), defining it as “to go through (life or some other period\nof time): PASS, LIVE <there he led a very peaceful existence>.”\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f       Therefore, the plain text of the statute and these definitions demonstrate that the\n\ncommon understanding of to “affect the person’s ability to lead his or her normal life” is\n\nto have an influence on some of the person’s capacity to live in his or her normal manner\n\nof living. By modifying “normal life” with “his or her,” the Legislature indicated that\n\nthis requires a subjective, person- and fact-specific inquiry that must be decided on a\n\ncase-by-case basis. Determining the effect or influence that the impairment has had on a\n\nplaintiff’s ability to lead a normal life necessarily requires a comparison of the plaintiff’s\n\nlife before and after the incident.\n\n       There are several important points to note, however, with regard to this\n\ncomparison. First, the statute merely requires that a person’s general ability to lead his or\n\nher normal life has been affected, not destroyed. Thus, courts should consider not only\n\nwhether the impairment has led the person to completely cease a pre-incident activity or\n\nlifestyle element, but also whether, although a person is able to lead his or her pre-\n\nincident normal life, the person’s general ability to do so was nonetheless affected.\n\n       Second, and relatedly, “general” modifies “ability,” not “affect” or “normal life.”\n\nThus, the plain language of the statute only requires that some of the person’s ability to\n\nlive in his or her normal manner of living has been affected, not that some of the person’s\n\nnormal manner of living has itself been affected. Thus, while the extent to which a\n\nperson’s general ability to live his or her normal life is affected by an impairment is\n\nundoubtedly related to what the person’s normal manner of living is, there is no\n\nquantitative minimum as to the percentage of a person’s normal manner of living that\n\nmust be affected.\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       Third, and finally, the statute does not create an express temporal requirement as\n\nto how long an impairment must last in order to have an effect on “the person’s general\n\nability to live his or her normal life.” To begin with, there is no such requirement in the\n\nplain language of the statute. Further, MCL 500.3135(1) provides that the threshold for\n\nliability is met “if the injured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body\n\nfunction, or permanent serious disfigurement.” While the Legislature required that a\n\n“serious disfigurement” be “permanent,” it did not impose the same restriction on a\n\n“serious impairment of body function.” Finally, to the extent that this prong’s language\n\nreflects a legislative intent to adopt this portion of Cassidy in some measure,16 Cassidy\n\nexpressly rejected a requirement of permanency to meet the serious impairment\n\nthreshold. Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505-506 (noting that “two broken bones, 18 days of\n\nhospitalization, 7 months of wearing casts during which dizzy spells further affected his\n\nmobility, and at least a minor residual effect one and one-half years later are sufficiently\n\nserious to meet the threshold requirement of serious impairment of body function”).\n\n       Despite the fact that the language of the statute was plain, the Kreiner majority\n\ndeviated significantly from the statutory text in its interpretation of this prong. To begin\n\nwith, the Kreiner majority erred in its interpretation of the phrase “that affects the\n\nperson’s general ability” for two reasons. First, it selectively quoted only the dictionary\n\n       16\n          Although some of this prong’s text is derived from Cassidy, the Legislature\nmade important modifications. The Cassidy Court stated that the serious impairment\nthreshold “looks to the effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal\nlife,” Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505, and the Legislature rejected that the standard for “a”\nnormal life was objective.\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fdefinitions of “general” that best supported its conclusions. It gave one definition for this\n\nword, “‘the whole; the total; that which comprehends or relates to all, or the chief part; a\n\ngeneral proposition, fact, principle, etc.;—opposed to particular; that is, opposed to\n\nspecial,’” and then relied on definitions of “in general” and “generally” to conclude that\n\n“general” means “‘for the most part.’” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 130, quoting Webster’s New\n\nInternational Dictionary. Webster’s, however, offers 10 definitions of the adjective\n\n“general,” many of which are similar to definitions quoted above from The American\n\nHeritage Dictionary. Moreover, of these 10 definitions, the majority chose the most\n\nrestrictive, even though, as discussed above, it does not make the most sense in this\n\ncontext. And, even then, the Kreiner majority looked to other forms of the word.\n\nSecond, the Kreiner majority stated that “[t]he starting point in analyzing whether an\n\nimpairment affects a person’s ‘general,’ i.e., overall, ability to lead his normal life should\n\nbe identifying how his life has been affected, by how much, and for how long.” Kreiner,\n\n471 Mich at 131. Although other portions of the Kreiner majority opinion more carefully\n\nstated that the test was the effect on a person’s general ability, this particular reasoning\n\ncould be pulled out of context to suggest that courts should focus on how much the\n\nimpairment affects a person’s life, instead of how much it affects the person’s ability to\n\nlive his or her life.\n\n       Further, the Kreiner majority significantly erred in its interpretation of “to lead his\n\nor her normal life.” It relied on a dictionary to define “lead” as “to conduct or bring in a\n\nparticular course.” Notably, depending on how this definition is interpreted, it may have\n\na similar meaning to “live” or “pass” when “conduct” and “course” are given a certain\n\n\n                                             22\n\fmeaning. “Conduct” can mean “to behave or act,” and “course” can mean “[a] mode of\n\naction or behavior” or “[a] typical or natural manner of proceeding or developing:\n\ncustomary passage . . . .” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition\n\n(1982). The meaning of “to behave or act in his or her typical or natural manner of\n\nproceeding” may be similar to “living in his or her normal manner of living.”\n\n       Beyond this point, however, the Kreiner majority went astray and gave the statute\n\na labored interpretation inconsistent with common meanings and common sense.\n\nApplying its chosen definition of “lead,” the majority concluded that “the effect of the\n\nimpairment on the course of a plaintiff’s entire normal life must be considered,” and if\n\n“the course or trajectory of the plaintiff’s normal life has not been affected, then the\n\nplaintiff’s ‘general ability’ to lead his normal life has not been affected . . . .” Kreiner,\n\n471 Mich at 131. In other words, the Kreiner majority held that the “common meaning”\n\nof whether an impairment has affected “the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life” is whether it has affected the person’s general ability to conduct the course\n\nor trajectory of his or her entire normal life. This “common meaning” is quite different\n\nfrom the actual statutory text in form and substance. Significantly, the Kreiner majority’s\n\ninterpretation of the statute interjects two terms that are not included in the statute or the\n\ndictionary definitions of the relevant statutory language: “trajectory” and “entire.” Both\n\nterms create ambiguity where the original statutory text had none, and the Kreiner\n\nmajority thus erred by selectively defining the words used in definitions of statutory\n\nterms in order to shift away from the common meaning that the words have in the context\n\nof MCL 500.3135(7).\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       As to the first addition, while “trajectory” is a synonym for “course” when\n\n“course” is defined as, for example, “[t]he direction of continuing movement,” The\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982), it is not a synonym for\n\nthe definition of “course” that makes sense in the context of defining a “general ability to\n\nlead his or her normal life.” When “conduct” is used with this definition of “course,” it\n\nhas the very different meaning of “[t]o direct the course of; control.” Id. The plain\n\nlanguage of the statute does not suggest that the Legislature’s intent was to address the\n\neffect of an impairment on the person’s ability to control the direction of their life, as\n\nopposed to its effect on the person’s ability to live in his or her normal manner of living.\n\nYet the majority managed to imply this meaning by inserting “trajectory” as a synonym\n\nfor “course,” thereby shifting the meaning of “course” from the most natural contextual\n\nreading of the word. The use of “trajectory” and the suggestion that “course” should be\n\nunderstood to mean “the direction of continuing movement,” instead of “a mode of action\n\nor behavior,” creates ambiguity by implying a sense of permanence that is inconsistent\n\nwith, and does not make sense in the context of, the actual statutory language.\n\n       As to the second addition, the majority modified the statutory language “his or her\n\nnormal life” with “entire,” a modification that it apparently created out of thin air,17\n\nthereby creating an ambiguity that had not previously existed in the statutory text. The\n\n\n       17\n         The Kreiner majority did define “in general” as “with respect to the entirety”\nwhen interpreting “general ability.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 130. But, even assuming that\nit is proper to use the definition of the phrase “in general” to define the adjective\n“general,” the Legislature used general to modify ability, not life.\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fword “life” has more than one meaning. As noted, it can refer to the meaning that would\n\nbe commonly understood to apply in the context of the statutory language, which is “a\n\nmanner of living.” It also can refer to “[t]he interval of time between birth and death;\n\nlifetime.” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition (1982). The\n\ndifferences are significant: whereas the first meaning refers to the day-to-day process of\n\nliving, the second is a finite measure that encompasses all of one’s time on earth.\n\nAlthough “entire” could modify either meaning of “life,” it is probably more commonly\n\nused to modify the second. Thus, by inserting “entire,” the Kreiner majority created an\n\nambiguity that is not present in the original statutory text because the second, finite\n\ndefinition of “life” does not make sense in the context of the actual statutory language. It\n\nwould be unusual to refer to someone’s general ability to lead his or her normal\n\n“lifetime” or “interval of time between life and death.” At best, this would seem to refer\n\nto an effect on the person’s life expectancy, but this would not be a subjective inquiry,\n\nand it is an impossible leap from any common understanding of the statutory language.18\n\nAt a minimum, using the modifier “entire” reinforces the general sense of permanence\n\nthat is also created by the insertion of “trajectory,” but which, as explained, is not in the\n\nactual statutory text. Because the Kreiner majority created ambiguity where there was\n\nnone, and crafted a statutory interpretation that is, in effect, a judicially constructed house\n\nof cards, we hold that it incorrectly interpreted the third prong of MCL 500.3135(7).\n\n\n         18\n              It is also to some extent accounted for in another threshold in MCL 500.3135(1):\ndeath.\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\f       The Kreiner majority aggravated this error, and departed even more dramatically\n\nfrom the statutory text, by providing an extra-textual “nonexhaustive list of objective\n\nfactors” to be used to compare the plaintiff’s pre- and post-incident lifestyle. These\n\nfactors are: “(a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length of\n\ntreatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of any residual\n\nimpairment, and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 133.19\n\nThe Legislature has unambiguously defined the “serious impairment of body function,”\n\nand the role of this Court is to apply the plain language of that definition, not to improve\n\nit with a list of judicially created factors that are not necessarily based in the statute’s\n\ntext. In fact, at least some of the Kreiner majority’s factors have no basis in the statutory\n\ntext and are instead derived from its extra-textual and extra-definitional additions to the\n\nactual statutory language, “entire” and “trajectory,” and serve to reinforce the ambiguity\n\nthat its interpretation of the third prong created, especially given that all of the factors\n\nexpressly or impliedly include a temporal component. Because the factors adopted by the\n\nKreiner majority are not based in the statutory text, and this Court’s role is to apply the\n\n\n\n\n       19\n         The majority correctly observes that I do not object to courts employing factors\nwhen applying statutes in many circumstances. I certainly object, however, to courts\ndoing so in a manner that not only perverts the statutory language but is also unsupported\nby, and inconsistent with, the legislative intent expressed by the statutory language, as the\nKreiner majority did.\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\funambiguous statutory language, not improve it, we hold that the majority erred by\n\nadopting them.20\n\n       In summary, the Kreiner majority’s interpretation of the third prong departed from\n\nthe idea that a court “should not casually read anything into an unambiguous statute that\n\nis not within the manifest intent of the Legislature as derived from the words of the\n\nstatute.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 157 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). Indeed, as I remarked in\n\ndissent, the Kreiner majority’s “interpretation” of the plain language of MCL\n\n500.3135(7) was a “chilling reminder that activism comes in all guises, including so-\n\ncalled textualism.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 157. Therefore, we hold that the Kreiner\n\nmajority’s interpretation of this prong, including the list of non-exhaustive factors, is not\n\nbased in the statute’s text and is incorrect.\n\n\n       20\n           Indeed, the potential for the Kreiner majority’s interpretation to be read in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with the statute has been realized in lower court decisions.\nFor example, in Gagne v Schulte, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of\nAppeals, issued February 28, 2006 (Docket No. 264788), the Court of Appeals held that a\nplaintiff had not suffered a serious impairment of body function even though her knee\ninjury resulted in surgery and severe restrictions on her movement for a year after the\naccident, indefinite continuing restrictions on her ability to perform her pre-accident job\nand other activities in which she participated before the accident, and a permanent loss of\nstability in her knee and an increased risk of osteoarthritis. The majority reasoned that\nthese impairments were insufficient to meet the threshold because she might someday be\nable to resume some activities with a knee brace and “there is no evidence that this period\nof decreased function affected her life so extensively that it altered the trajectory or\ncourse of her entire normal life.” Id., unpub op at 2. Indeed, the majority’s reasoning\nseemed to consider whether the plaintiff’s ability to control the direction of her entire life\nhad been altered, rather than her ability to live her life in a normal manner, given that it\nfound the threshold was not met despite evidence that the plaintiff had continuing\nrestrictions on movement, activities, and work, and medically documented long-term\ndamage.\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\f              3. STARE DECISIS: SHOULD KREINER BE OVERRULED?\n\n       To the extent that the Kreiner majority’s interpretation of the statute was\n\ninconsistent with the foregoing approach, and departed from the legislative intent\n\nexpressed in the unambiguous language of the statute, we hold that it was wrongly\n\ndecided. Given this conclusion, the question is whether it should be overruled. We hold\n\nthat it should be.21\n\n       Under the doctrine of stare decisis, “principles of law deliberately examined and\n\ndecided by a court of competent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.” Brown v\n\nManistee Co Rd Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365; 550 NW2d 215 (1996) (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted).

Ultimately, it is an attempt “to balance\n\ntwo competing considerations: the need of the community for stability in legal rules and\n\ndecisions and the need of courts to correct past errors.” Petersen, 484 Mich at 314. As a\n\nreflection of this balance, there is a presumption in favor of upholding precedent, but this\n\npresumption may be rebutted if there is a special or compelling justification to overturn\n\nprecedent. Id. at 319-320. In determining whether a special or compelling justification\n\nexists, a number of evaluative criteria may be relevant, id., but overturning precedent\n\nrequires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly decided. See Brown, 452 Mich\n\nat 365.22\n\n\n\n       22\n         In Petersen, Chief Justice KELLY provided a non-exhaustive list of criteria that\nmay be considered, but none of the criteria is determinative, and they need only be\nevaluated if relevant. See Petersen, 484 Mich at 320.\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\f       In determining whether Kreiner should be overruled, I find several evaluative\n\ncriteria particularly relevant: (1) “whether the rule has proven to be intolerable because\n\nit defies practical workability,” (2) “whether reliance on the rule is such that overruling\n\nit would cause a special hardship and inequity,” (3) “whether upholding the rule is likely\n\nto result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests,” and (4) “whether the prior\n\ndecision was an abrupt and largely unexplained departure from precedent.” Petersen,\n\n484 Mich at 320. As applied here, on the balance, these criteria weigh in favor of\n\noverturning Kreiner.\n\n       The first criterion weighs heavily in favor of overruling Kreiner because the\n\nKreiner majority’s departure from the plain language of MCL 500.3135(7) defies\n\npractical workability. As discussed above, the majority took unambiguous statutory text\n\nand, through linguistic gymnastics, contorted it into a confusing and ambiguous test.\n\nAppellate litigation arising out of MCL 500.3135(7) has greatly increased since Kreiner23\n\nand has resulted in confusion. To begin with, the lower courts’ application of Kreiner\n\nhas led to inconsistent interpretation of the statutory language, with similarly situated\n\n\n\n\n       23\n         In the six years since Kreiner was decided, there have been three times as many\nCourt of Appeals cases citing MCL 500.3135(7) as there were in the nine years between\nwhen the amendment was enacted and Kreiner was decided. In the nine years between\nwhen the amendment became effective and when Kreiner was decided, only 86 Court of\nAppeals cases cited MCL 500.3135(7). As of May 27, 2010, in the six years since the\nKreiner decision was issued, there have been 254 Court of Appeals cases citing MCL\n500.3135(7).\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fplaintiffs being treated differently by different courts.24   Further, some courts have\n\ninterpreted Kreiner to create a threshold that is higher than that in Cassidy or DiFranco,\n\nprimarily by reading the Kreiner majority’s interpretation of the statute to effectively\n\ncreate a permanency requirement.25 As discussed, this is contrary to the legislative intent\n\nexpressed by the plain language of the statute.         Because the Kreiner majority’s\n\ninterpretation of the third prong of MCL 500.3135(7) has created ambiguity where there\n\nwas none, and increased litigation and confusion, the first factor weighs heavily in favor\n\nof overruling Kreiner.\n\n       Second, correcting the errors in the Kreiner majority’s interpretation of MCL\n\n500.3135(7) would not present an undue hardship to reliance interests, and this factor\n\nweighs in favor of overruling Kreiner. As this Court has explained when evaluating a\n\nsimilar factor in the past, “the Court must ask whether the previous decision has become\n\n\n       24\n          For example, in Luther v Morris, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court\nof Appeals, issued January 18, 2005 (Docket No. 244483), the Court held that the\nplaintiff had suffered a serious impairment of body function where a dislocated elbow\ncaused her to miss 52 days of work and significantly interfered with her ability to\nperform daily personal tasks for a while, but her life returned to normal within a couple\nof months after the accident. In contrast, in Guevara v Martinez, unpublished opinion per\ncuriam of the Court of Appeals, issued May 24, 2005 (Docket No. 260387), the Court\nheld that there was no serious impairment where the plaintiff suffered a dislocated right\nshoulder and a torn anterior rotator cuff that significantly interfered with his ability to\nperform daily personal tasks for a couple of months and prevented him from continuing\nwork as a part-time construction worker during at least the surgery and multiple months\nof rehabilitation. The outcomes in these cases are difficult to reconcile.\n       25\n         See footnote 20 of this opinion summarizing Gagne v Schulte, unpublished\nopinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 28, 2006 (Docket No.\n264788).\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fso embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone’s expectations that to change it\n\nwould produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.” Robinson v\n\nDetroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 466; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). It further stated that this factor\n\napplies to cases that if overruled “even if they were wrongfully decided, would produce\n\nchaos.” Id. at 466 n 26. Kreiner is not “so” embedded, accepted, or fundamental to\n\nexpectations that chaos will result from overruling it. To begin with, Kreiner was\n\ndecided only six years ago, and, while it was the first opinion from this Court interpreting\n\nMCL 500.3135(7), it was contrary to the plain text of the statute, which had been in place\n\nsince 1995. As the Robinson majority explained, people normally rely on the words of\n\nthe statute itself when looking for guidance on how to direct their actions. Robinson, 462\n\nMich at 467. Further, it is unlikely that motor vehicle drivers, and the victims of motor\n\nvehicle accidents, have altered their behavior in reliance on Kreiner. As noted by the\n\nRobinson majority, where a statute deals with the consequences of accidents, “it seems\n\nincontrovertible that only after the accident would . . . awareness [of this Court’s\n\ncaselaw] come,” and “after-the-fact awareness does not rise to the level of a reliance\n\ninterest because to have reliance the knowledge must be of the sort that causes a person\n\nor entity to attempt to conform his conduct to a certain norm before the triggering event.”\n\nId. at 466-467. Similarly, this statute generally involves motor vehicle accidents, and it\n\nstrains credibility to think that the average driver and the average future injured party\n\nhave altered their behavior in reliance on Kreiner.\n\n       The third criterion, the effect on the public interest, also weighs in favor of\n\noverruling Kreiner. Although there may be policy arguments on both sides regarding the\n\n\n                                            32\n\fcosts and benefits of having a more or less difficult threshold for recovery under MCL\n\n500.3135, our interpretation of the statute in this case is truer to the statute’s text than\n\nthat of the Kreiner majority, and, thus, our interpretation most closely reflects the policy\n\nbalance struck by the Legislature.26 In contrast, Kreiner altered the balance from that\n\nintended by the Legislature by imposing extra-textual burdens to meeting the threshold,\n\nand, as a result, it is difficult to argue that overruling Kreiner to restore the balance\n\nintended by the Legislature would hurt the public interest (or that affirming Kreiner\n\nserves it).\n\n       Finally, the fourth criterion is neutral. Kreiner was not an abrupt change from\n\nprecedent, but it did provide an interpretation of the statute that was not obvious from the\n\nstatute’s text.\n\n       On the basis of these evaluative criteria, we hold that Kreiner should be overruled.\n\n                        4. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE TEST\n\n       On the basis of the foregoing, the proper interpretation of the clear and\n\nunambiguous language in MCL 500.3135 creates the following test.\n\n       26\n          The dissent devotes a significant amount of time conducting what is essentially\na policy analysis hypothesizing about the disastrous effects that this opinion will have on\nthe insurance industry and, thus, concluding that we are undoing the legislative\ncompromise that was the general backdrop of the no-fault act. While I am cognizant of\nthe legislative compromise, I am less convinced than the dissent that this Court’s role is\nto conduct an independent policy analysis to determine whether the plain language of an\namendment adopted by the Legislature, 20 years after the no-fault act was originally\nadopted, is inconsistent with the overall act’s general purposes. Even assuming arguendo\nthat it could be, I do not believe that broad statements regarding the general purpose of\nthe act’s adoption in 1973 trump the intent expressed by the Legislature in the plain\nlanguage of a later amendment to the act.\n\n\n\n                                            33\n\f       To begin with, the court should determine whether there is a factual dispute\n\nregarding the nature and the extent of the person’s injuries, and, if so, whether the dispute\n\nis material to determining whether the serious impairment of body function threshold is\n\nmet. MCL 500.3135(2)(a)(i) and (ii).27 If there is no factual dispute, or no material\n\nfactual dispute, then whether the threshold is met is a question of law for the court. Id.\n\n       If the court may decide the issue as a matter of law, it should next determine\n\nwhether the serious impairment threshold has been crossed. The unambiguous language\n\nof MCL 500.3135(7) provides three prongs that are necessary to establish a “serious\n\nimpairment of body function”: (1) an objectively manifested impairment (observable or\n\nperceivable from actual symptoms or conditions) (2) of an important body function (a\n\nbody function of value, significance, or consequence to the injured person) that (3)\n\naffects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life (influences some of the\n\nplaintiff’s capacity to live in his or her normal manner of living).\n\n       The serious impairment analysis is inherently fact- and circumstance- specific and\n\nmust be conducted on a case-by-case basis. As stated in the Kreiner dissent, “[t]he\n\nLegislature recognized that what is important to one is not important to all[;] a brief\n\nimpairment may be devastating whereas a near permanent impairment may have little\n\n\n       27\n          As discussed in footnotes 7 and 8 of this opinion, this provision may\nunconstitutionally conflict with MCR 2.116(C)(10) in certain cases. If it does, then a\ncourt should only apply MCL 500.3135(2) to the extent that it is consistent with MCR\n2.116(C)(10). We do not reach this issue today, however, because there is no material\nfactual dispute over any fact necessary to determining whether the serious impairment\nthreshold has been met.\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\feffect.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 145 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). As such, the analysis\n\ndoes not “lend itself to any bright-line rule or imposition of [a] nonexhaustive list of\n\nfactors,” particularly where there is no basis in the statute for such factors.          Id.\n\nAccordingly, because “[t]he Legislature avoided drawing lines in the sand . . . so must\n\nwe.” Id.\n\n                          C. APPLICATION OF MCL 500.3135\n\n       Under the facts of this case, we hold that plaintiff has met the serious impairment\n\nthreshold as a matter of law.\n\n       To begin with, there is no factual dispute that is material to determining whether\n\nthe serious impairment threshold is met. The parties do not dispute that plaintiff suffered\n\na broken ankle, was completely restricted from bearing weight on his ankle for a month,\n\nand underwent two surgeries over a 10-month period and multiple months of physical\n\ntherapy. The parties do dispute the extent to which plaintiff continues to suffer a residual\n\nimpairment and the potential for increased susceptibility to degenerative arthritis.\n\nPlaintiff has provided at least some evidence of a physical basis for his subjective\n\ncomplaints of pain and suffering,28 but defendant disputes whether there is persuasive\n\nevidence of impairment beyond plaintiff’s subjective complaints. This dispute is not\n\nsignificant or essential to determining whether the serious impairment threshold is met in\n\nthis case, however, because plaintiff has not alleged that the residual impairment, to the\n\n       28\n         The FCEs report that plaintiff’s range of motion in his ankle is not within\nnormal limits, and the MRI and two doctors’ reports suggest at least some scarring and\ndegenerative tissue damage around plaintiff’s left ankle.\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\fextent that it exists, continues to affect his general ability to lead his pre-incident “normal\n\nlife,”29 the third prong of the analysis. Moreover, it is not necessary to establish the first\n\ntwo prongs. Therefore, the dispute is not material and does not prevent this Court from\n\ndeciding whether the threshold is met as a matter of law under MCL 500.3135(2)(a).\n\n       The other facts material to determining whether the serious impairment threshold\n\nis met are also undisputed.30 Before the incident, plaintiff’s “normal life” consisted\n\nprimarily of working 60 hours a week as a medium truck loader. Plaintiff also frequently\n\nfished in the spring and summer and was a weekend golfer. After the incident, plaintiff\n\nwas unable to return to work for at least 14 months and did not return for 19 months. He\n\nnever returned to his original job as a medium truck loader, but he suffered no loss in pay\n\nbecause of the change in job. He was able to fish at pre-incident levels by the spring of\n\n2006 and is able to take care of his personal needs at the same level as before the\n\nincident. There is no allegation that the impairment of body function has affected his\n\nrelationship with his significant other or other qualitative aspects of his life.\n\n       Next, in light of the lack of a factual dispute that is material to determining\n\nwhether the threshold is met, under MCL 500.3135(2)(a), this Court should decide as a\n\n\n       29\n          Plaintiff stated that his life is “painful, but normal.” He does not allege that any\nresidual impairment has a significant effect on his ability to participate in or enjoy\nactivities to the extent that he could before the accident.\n       30\n         If there had been other disputed facts that were material to this determination,\nwe would have to reach the question whether MCL 500.3135(2)(a) is unconstitutional to\nthe extent that it requires a court to decide material disputed facts as a matter of law. See\nfootnote 7 of this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                              36\n\fmatter of law whether plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function under the\n\nthree prongs in MCL 500.3135(7).\n\n          With regard to the first prong, plaintiff has shown an objectively manifested\n\nimpairment of body function. There is no dispute that plaintiff has presented evidence\n\nthat he suffered a broken ankle and actual symptoms or conditions that someone else\n\nwould perceive as impairing body functions, such as walking, crouching, climbing, and\n\nlifting weight. Even 14 months after the incident, an FCE report observed that ankle pain\n\nand a reduced range of motion inhibited these body functions.           Thus, plaintiff has\n\nsatisfied this prong.\n\n          With regard to the second prong, the impaired body functions were important to\n\nplaintiff. His testimony establishes that being unable to walk and perform other functions\n\nwere of consequence to his ability to work. Thus, the second prong of MCL 500.3135(7)\n\nis met.\n\n          The next question in this case is whether the third prong is met, but we hold that\n\nplaintiff has shown that the impairment affected his general ability to lead his normal life\n\nbecause it influenced some of his capacity to live in his normal, pre-incident manner of\n\nliving. Before the incident, plaintiff’s normal manner of living consisted primarily of\n\nworking, for 60 hours a week, and secondarily his hobbies of fishing and golfing. After\n\nthe incident, at least some of plaintiff’s capacity to live in this manner was affected.\n\nSpecifically, for a month after the incident, plaintiff could not bear weight on his left\n\nankle. He underwent two surgeries over a period of 10 months and multiple months of\n\nphysical therapy. Moreover, his capacity to work, the central part of his pre-incident\n\n\n                                              37\n\f“normal life,” was affected.31 Whereas before the incident he spent most of his time\n\nworking, after the incident he was unable to perform functions necessary for his job for at\n\nleast 14 months, and he did not return to work for 19 months.32 On the basis of these\n\nfacts, we conclude that some of plaintiff’s capacity to live in his pre-incident manner of\n\nliving was affected, and the third prong of MCL 500.3135(7) is satisfied.33\n\n       Because all three prongs of MCL 500.3135(7) are satisfied, we hold, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that plaintiff has met the serious impairment threshold requirement under MCL\n\n500.3135(1).\n\n                             D. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT\n\n       Despite the dissent’s length, it provides very little substantive disagreement or\n\ncriticism of the statutory interpretation presented in this opinion and very little response\n\nto our criticisms of the statutory interpretation in Kreiner. Where the dissent does\n\nactually address the substance of the opinion, its criticisms are often based not on the\n       31\n           As noted, it is unclear from the record the extent to which the impairment\naffected plaintiff’s ability to fish in the first year after the incident or his ability to golf in\nthe first year and a half after the incident, or the extent to which he actually undertook\neither activity in those periods.\n       32\n        It could be significant that plaintiff’s job has changed, even though his pay is the\nsame, but there is no evidence suggesting that this was an effect of impairment.\nTherefore, this fact is not relevant to the “normal life” inquiry here.\n       33\n           Our analysis focuses on plaintiff’s pre- and post-incident activities and the\nextent to which he was able to participate in them after the incident because those are the\nfacts in the record. The facts that the parties considered relevant in developing the record\nwere, no doubt, influenced by the Kreiner majority’s erroneous deviation from the\nstatutory language. As noted, however, many other considerations could typically be\nrelevant to determining how an impairment affects a person’s ability to live in his or her\npre-incident normal manner of living.\n\n\n\n                                                38\n\factual holdings of the majority opinion but, instead, on the dissent’s misunderstandings\n\nor overgeneralizations of those holdings.\n\n       For example, the dissent complains that the majority “resuscitate[s]” my opinion\n\nin DiFranco.34 As a result, the dissent resuscitates old criticisms of DiFranco and attacks\n\nthe majority for failing to recognize the Legislature’s intent, as expressed in the statute’s\n\nlegislative history, to reject DiFranco in favor of Cassidy.35 As is plainly evident in the\n\nanalysis, however, this opinion faithfully applies the text of the statute, even where that\n\ntext is inconsistent with DiFranco.        The opinion fully recognizes the Legislature’s\n\nadoption of Cassidy where the Legislature indicated an intent to do so through the text of\n\nthe statute and “resuscitates” DiFranco only in the narrow places where, similarly, the\n\nstatutory text indicates a legislative intent to do so.36\n\n       Additionally, the dissent’s comments on the majority’s lack of use of legislative\n\nhistory are ill-founded on two levels. First, contrary to the dissent’s assertion that I have\n\n\n       34\n           The only explanation that I can discover for the dissent’s reaching this\nconclusion is its baseless accusation that the majority is essentially reading the third\nprong out of the statute. It is unclear to me, however, how reading and applying the plain\ntext of the statute, instead of enhancing and extending the statute through creative use of\na thesaurus and extra-textual factors, could equate to reading that language out of the\nstatute.\n       35\n          Interestingly, while criticizing the majority for supposedly reviving DiFranco,\nthe dissent also criticizes us for not going far enough in its revival by not adopting the\nfactors that I used in DiFranco.\n       36\n           It appears that the dissent itself does not actually believe that we are\nresuscitating DiFranco, given that it so vigorously, albeit erroneously, argues that the\nonly difference between our decision today and Kreiner is that Kreiner adopted temporal\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\f“never questioned the utility of legislative history” and that “there is no principled\n\nreason” not to use it in this case, I have repeatedly stated that legislative history should\n\nonly be used to interpret a statute when statutory language is ambiguous.

The dissent’s statements to the\n\ncontrary are, again, largely based on its mistaken characterization of the majority opinion\n\nas resuscitating DiFranco and ignoring Cassidy.\n\n       The dissent also repeatedly states that the majority opinion holds that temporal\n\nconsiderations are “wholly or largely irrelevant” to the serious impairment threshold, and,\n\naccordingly, it spends a significant amount of energy explaining why temporal\n\nconsiderations are relevant and accusing the majority of holding that the threshold is met\n\nif “the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life has been affected for even a single\n\nmoment in time.” Contrary to the dissent’s cries, there is simply no basis in our analysis\n\nfor concluding that we hold that temporal considerations are irrelevant or that a\n\nmomentary impairment is sufficient. The opinion merely notes that there is no specific\n\nexpress temporal requirement in the text of the statute and rejects Kreiner’s strained\n\nattempts to insert what was essentially a permanency requirement into the statute.39 The\n\ndissent’s mistaken characterizations of this opinion amount to nothing more than, like\n\nKreiner itself, yet another attempt to distract courts and parties from the actual text of\n\nMCL 500.3135.\n\n       39\n          Indeed, the dissent is so blindly intent on concluding that the majority must be\nrejecting temporal considerations that it fails to consider that its triumphant discovery of\nthe majority’s “hypocrisy” in referencing time periods in our application of MCL\n500.3135(2) is nothing more than a reflection of the fact that we are not holding that\ntemporal considerations are irrelevant.\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f                                  IV.

Those decisions were made by the “majority\nof four,” including the dissenting justices, under the guise of ideologies such as\n“textualism” and “judicial traditionalism.” One of the dissenting justices, Justice YOUNG,\nexpressed his apparent contempt for the common law and common sense in his 2004\narticle in the Texas Review of Law and Politics, where Justice YOUNG stated:\n\n             Consequently, I want to focus my remarks here on the\n       embarrassment that the common law presents—or ought to present—to a\n       conscientious judicial traditionalist. . . .\n\n              To give a graphic illustration of my feelings on the subject, I tend to\n       think of the common law as a drunken, toothless ancient relative, sprawled\n       prominently and in a state of nature on a settee in the middle of one’s\n       genteel garden party.

The no-fault automobile insurance act, MCL\n\n500.3135(1), provides that “[a] person remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic\n\nloss caused by his or her ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the\n\ninjured person has suffered death, serious impairment of body function, or permanent\n\nserious disfigurement.”   The issue here is whether plaintiff has suffered a serious\n\nimpairment of body function.        “‘[S]erious impairment of body function’ means an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” MCL 500.3135(7).\n\f       In Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132-133, this Court held that in determining whether an\n\nimpairment affects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life, “a court should\n\nengage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiff’s life before and after the\n\naccident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiff’s\n\noverall life.” In addition, Kreiner indicated that certain factors, such as the duration of\n\nthe impairment, may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiff’s general ability\n\nto lead his normal life has been affected. Id. at 133.\n\n       The majority overrules Kreiner, rejecting these factors and holding that temporal\n\nconsiderations are wholly or largely irrelevant in determining whether an impairment\n\naffects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life. The majority instead holds\n\nthat, as long as the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life has been affected,\n\napparently for even a single moment in time, the plaintiff has suffered a “serious\n\nimpairment of body function.” This conclusion is at odds with the actual language of the\n\nno-fault automobile act and nullifies the legislative compromise embodied in that act. I\n\ncontinue to believe that Kreiner was correctly decided, and that temporal considerations\n\nare highly relevant-- indeed necessary-- in determining whether an impairment affects the\n\nplaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life.        By nullifying the legislative\n\ncompromise, which was grounded in concerns over excessive litigation, the over-\n\ncompensation of minor injuries, and the availability of affordable insurance, the Court’s\n\ndecision today will resurrect a legal environment in which each of these hazards reappear\n\nand threaten the continued fiscal integrity of our no-fault system.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       Because I do not believe that the lower courts erred in concluding that plaintiff in\n\nthis case has not suffered a serious impairment of body function, I would affirm the\n\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                    I. FACTS AND HISTORY\n\n       Because the majority opinion provides only a cursory presentation of the facts, in a\n\ncase requiring a fact-intensive analysis, I find it necessary to set forth a more thorough\n\ndiscussion of these facts. Beginning in August of 2002, plaintiff was employed by Allied\n\nSystems, and over the years, he has held various positions with the company.1 On\n\nJanuary 17, 2005, approximately six months after beginning his position as a medium\n\ntruck loader, plaintiff was struck by a truck driven by plaintiff’s co-worker and co-\n\ndefendant, Larry Carrier, while shuttling vehicles at a General Motors plant. Plaintiff\n\nwas knocked down, and the wheels of the truck ran over his left ankle, fracturing his\n\nmedial malleolus. Plaintiff was immediately taken to the hospital and was released that\n\nsame day. Two days later, he underwent surgery for the implantation of a device to\n\nstabilize his ankle fracture. Immediately following surgery, plaintiff was on crutches and\n\nin a boot for approximately four weeks and, during this time, he was restricted from\n\nbearing weight on his left leg. Additionally, plaintiff underwent physical therapy.2\n\n\n       1\n          Before plaintiff began working for Allied, he installed windows. When he first\nbegan working for Allied, he loaded trains, and after approximately six months, he took a\n“utility job,” providing support to other departments as needed. In June of 2004, he\nbegan working as a medium truck loader.\n       2\n         It is not altogether clear how long plaintiff’s physical therapy actually lasted. In\nplaintiff’s deposition, he indicated that he underwent “many months” of therapy.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f      On October 21, 2005, plaintiff again underwent surgery on his ankle, this time to\n\nremove the implanted device. The surgeon reported that plaintiff’s ankle had “healed\n\nnicely.” On November 5, 2005, at the request of Allied, plaintiff was examined by Dr.\n\nPaul Drouillard, who stated that plaintiff could return to work with restrictions of no\n\nprolonged standing or walking for three weeks, after which time, plaintiff could return to\n\nwork with no restrictions.    On November 17, 2005, plaintiff was examined by his\n\nsurgeon, who observed that plaintiff’s “wound is healed very nicely” and that plaintiff\n\n“needs to be in seated work for approximately six weeks.”\n\n      On January 12, 2006, plaintiff’s surgeon examined him and cleared him to return\n\nto work with no restrictions. At this examination, plaintiff reported to his surgeon that\n\n“[h]is medial malleolus is not giving him any pain.” The surgeon observed that plaintiff\n\nhad an “excellent range of motion with no specific tenderness.” Upon returning to work\n\nfor several days, however, plaintiff indicated that performing the physical tasks that his\n\njob required, such as walking, climbing, and crouching, caused his ankle to hurt. After\n\nplaintiff’s request for a different assignment was denied, plaintiff went back on workers’\n\ncompensation.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in his response to defendant’s motion for summary disposition, plaintiff\nindicated that he had six weeks of therapy. And, during plaintiff’s oral argument\nopposing defendant’s motion for summary disposition, plaintiff’s counsel claimed that\nplaintiff underwent 18 weeks of therapy.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f       On March 16, 2006, Allied required plaintiff to undergo a functional capacity\n\nevaluation (FCE),3 which showed that plaintiff could not fully perform all of his previous\n\njob duties.4 During this evaluation, when asked what his goal was in returning to work,\n\nplaintiff responded, “I don’t want to go back to work; there is talk about a buyout and I\n\nthink I want to do that.” Plaintiff also reported that his ankle pain was a three on a scale\n\nof zero to ten, with ten being the highest.\n\n       On May 31, 2006, Dr. Drouillard again examined plaintiff, at the request of Allied.\n\nDr. Drouillard found no objective abnormality to correspond to plaintiff’s complaints and\n\nopined that plaintiff was magnifying his symptoms. Dr. Drouillard also observed that,\n\nalthough plaintiff claimed that he had been wearing an ankle brace for the last two weeks,\n\nthe tan lines on plaintiff’s left and right feet were symmetrical, consistent with wearing\n\nflip-flops, with no break in his tan lines to indicate that he had been wearing the brace at\n\nall. Dr. Drouillard believed that plaintiff could return to work unrestricted and that\n\nplaintiff’s ankle required no further treatment.\n\n       On June 12, 2006, plaintiff underwent an MRI test; the physiatrist who reviewed\n\nthe MRI and performed a follow-up examination found that there was some evidence of\n\nligamentous injury, but he did not establish a plan to decrease plaintiff’s pain because\n\n       3\n         An FCE is “an all-encompassing term to describe the physical assessment of an\nindividual’s ability to perform work-related activity.” American Occupational Therapy\nAssociation, <http://ww.aota.org/Consumers/WhatisOT/WI/Facts/35117.aspx> (accessed\nJuly 1, 2010).\n       4\n        This was due in part to shoulder pain resulting from a preexisting and unrelated\nshoulder injury.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fthere was little the physiatrist could do.5 At this examination, plaintiff reported that his\n\npain was a six on a scale of zero to ten, that the pain was worse with “any movement,”\n\nand that nothing alleviates that pain. On June 20, 2006, Dr. Drouillard reviewed the MRI\n\nresults and found that plaintiff’s ankle had healed well and that his opinion from May 31,\n\n2006 had not changed.\n\n       Shortly thereafter, plaintiff’s workers’ compensation benefits were terminated.6\n\nAt this point, plaintiff sought another FCE so that he could return to work. On August 1,\n\n2006, the FCE indicated that plaintiff was able to perform essential job demands without\n\nrestriction. At this FCE, plaintiff reported that he experienced “occasional aching” in his\n\nankle, and that there were no “activities that aggravated his symptoms in the left ankle\n\n(including prolonged standing, prolonged walking).” Plaintiff reported that his pain level\n\nwas a two on a scale of zero to ten and, during the two weeks immediately preceding the\n\nFCE, his highest pain level had been a three and his lowest pain level had been a one. By\n\nthe completion of the FCE, plaintiff reported his pain level at zero. On August 16, 2006,\n\napproximately 17 months after the accident, plaintiff returned to work and Allied\n\n       5\n         A physiatrist is a medical doctor who practices physiatry, “a medical specialty\nfor the treatment of disease and injury by physical agents, as exercise or heat therapy.”\nRandom House Webster’s College Dictionary (1991).\n       6\n         Plaintiff began receiving workers’ compensation in January 2005. Plaintiff\nclaims that he lost $66,000 in wages, the difference between his salary and his workers’\ncompensation benefits for the time he was not working. However, the instant case only\ninvolves noneconomic damages.          Lost wages are economic damages and are\ncompensable as personal protection insurance benefits, MCL 500.3107(1)(b), and/or\nthrough a tort claim against the party at fault to recover excess economic losses, MCL\n500.3135(3)(c).\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fassigned him to a new job with different physical requirements, and with no reduction in\n\npay. Plaintiff volunteered to be assigned to this other job, and has been able to perform\n\nhis new job duties since that time.\n\n       During his recuperation, plaintiff did not require any assistance with normal\n\nhousehold tasks. Additionally, he was able to drive and his injuries have not affected his\n\nrelationship with his wife in any way.7 Outside of work, plaintiff was able to engage in\n\nmost of the activities in which he was engaged before his injury, such as fishing.8\n\nImportantly, by plaintiff’s own admission at his deposition in October of 2006, his life\n\nwas “normal” despite some “occasional aching.”\n\n       On March 24, 2006, plaintiff filed a third-party action against Carrier (the driver\n\nof the truck) and General Motors Corporation (GM).9 Carrier was later released by\n\n\n       7\n           Plaintiff’s wife has not brought a loss-of-consortium claim.\n       8\n          Although the majority suggests that plaintiff returned to fishing at pre-injury\nlevels by the spring and summer of 2006, the record indicates that plaintiff’s fishing\nactivities had never been interrupted. Plaintiff was asked if he “[s]till fish[ed] the same\namount of time as [he] fished before the accident when [he] get[s] a chance,” to which\nplaintiff replied, “When I get a chance.” Furthermore, defendant argued in its motion for\nsummary disposition that plaintiff’s fishing activities were uninterrupted by the injury,\nand plaintiff did not dispute this. Plaintiff essentially conceded this fact and instead\nargued that the disruption in his life as a result of his injuries was centered on his inability\nto work. Plaintiff also was a weekend golfer. The record reflects that since plaintiff\nreturned to work in August 2006, he had only golfed once, using a golf cart. We do not\nknow whether plaintiff was able to golf during the time between his accident in January\n2005 and August 2006. Defendant argued in its motion for summary disposition that\nplaintiff continued to engage in his pre-accident level of golfing activity, and again\nplaintiff did not argue to the contrary.\n       9\n         With GM’s bankruptcy, the parties stipulated to a change in case caption and\nparty, adding Allied Automotive Group, Inc., indemnitor of GM; plaintiff’s employer,\n\n\n                                               7\n\fstipulation of the parties, and the trial court granted GM’s motion for summary\n\ndisposition, finding that plaintiff had undergone a relatively good recovery and could not\n\nmeet the “serious impairment of body function” threshold.\n\n       The Court of Appeals affirmed, with one judge dissenting, concluding that the\n\nimpairment did not affect plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life. McCormick v\n\nCarrier, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 25, 2008\n\n(Docket No. 275888). The majority cited various facts to support its conclusion, such as\n\nplaintiff’s golfing, fishing, driving, caring for himself, and returning to work without\n\nrestriction. The dissent would have reversed for two reasons: first, on the basis that\n\nplaintiff’s entire life, including the possibility of future problems, must be considered;\n\nand, second, on the basis that there was evidence to indicate that plaintiff’s life was not\n\ncurrently normal. The evidence that the dissent relied on to reach this conclusion was\n\nthat plaintiff was assigned to a job with reduced physical requirements and the doctors\n\nhad identified “some indication of degenerative joint disease in [plaintiff’s] ankle.” Id.,\n\nunpub op at 2 (DAVIS, J., dissenting).\n\n       On October 22, 2008, this Court denied plaintiff’s application for leave to appeal,\n\nalthough Chief Justice KELLY and Justices CAVANAGH and WEAVER would have granted\n\nleave to appeal. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008).

ANALYSIS\n\n                  A. HISTORY OF NO-FAULT INSURANCE ACT\n\n      In Michigan, before the enactment of the no-fault insurance act, the only available\n\nrecourse to victims of motor vehicle accidents seeking to recover damages was to file a\n\ncommon-law tort action.      “[U]nder [this] tort liability system[,] the doctrine of\n\ncontributory negligence denied benefits to a high percentage of motor vehicle accident\n\nvictims, minor injuries were overcompensated, serious injuries were undercompensated,\n\nlong payment delays were commonplace, the court system was overburdened, and those\n\nwith low income and little education suffered discrimination.”      Shavers v Attorney\n\nGeneral, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106387\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106387/shavers-v-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). In response to these deficiencies, the\n\nLegislature enacted the no-fault automobile insurance act, MCL 500.3101 et seq.,\n\neffective March 30, 1973. The primary goal of the no-fault act is “to provide victims of\n\nmotor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic\n\nlosses.” Shavers, 402 Mich at 579. In order to meet this objective, the Legislature\n\ndecided to make no-fault insurance compulsory, i.e., “whereby every Michigan motorist\n\n\n                                           9\n\fwould be required to purchase no-fault insurance or be unable to operate a motor vehicle\n\nlegally in this state.” Id. In addition, “[i]n exchange for the payment of . . . no-fault\n\neconomic loss benefits from one’s own insurance company, the Legislature limited an\n\ninjured person’s ability to sue a negligent operator or owner of a motor vehicle for bodily\n\ninjuries.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 115. That is, with the enactment of the no-fault act, “the\n\nLegislature abolished tort liability generally in motor vehicle accident cases and replaced\n\nit with a regime that established that a person injured in such an accident is entitled to\n\ncertain economic compensation from his own insurance company regardless of fault.” Id.\n\nat 114.10 In exchange for economic loss benefits regardless of fault, “the Legislature\n\nsignificantly limited the injured person’s ability to sue a third party for noneconomic\n\ndamages, e.g., pain and suffering.” Id. at 115. More specifically, no tort suit against a\n\nthird party for noneconomic damages is permitted unless the injured person “has suffered\n\ndeath, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.” MCL\n\n500.3135(1).11\n\n       10\n           The injured person’s insurance company is responsible for all expenses incurred\nfor medical care, recovery, and rehabilitation as long as the service, product, or\naccommodation is reasonably necessary and the charge is reasonable.                   MCL\n500.3107(1)(a). There is no monetary limit on such expenses, and this entitlement can\nlast for the person’s lifetime. An injured person is also entitled to recover from his own\ninsurance company up to three years of earnings loss, i.e., loss of income from work that\nthe person would have performed if he had not been injured. MCL 500.3107(1)(b). An\ninjured person can also recover “replacement” expenses, i.e., expenses reasonably\nincurred in obtaining ordinary and necessary services that the injured person would\notherwise have performed.

DiFranco held that “[i]f reasonable minds can\n\ndiffer as to whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function, the issue\n\nmust be submitted to the jury, even if the evidentiary facts are undisputed. Id. at 58. In\n\naddition, DiFranco held that the “impairment need not be of . . . an important body\n\nfunction,” and it is unnecessary to look to the effect of the injury on the person’s\n\n“‘general ability to live a normal life.’” Id. at 39. DiFranco also held that, although the\n\nplaintiff must prove a “medically identifiable injury,” this can be done on the basis of\n\n“the plaintiff’s subjective complaints or the symptoms of an injury.” Id. at 75. Finally,\n\nDiFranco held that the following factors should be considered when determining whether\n\nthe impairment was serious:\n\n       The extent of the impairment, the particular body function impaired, the\n       length of time the impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the\n       impairment, and any other relevant factors. [Id. at 69-70.]\n\n       In 1995, the Legislature amended the no-fault act. In particular, it amended MCL\n\n500.3135(2)(a), which provides:\n\n              The issues of whether an injured person has suffered serious\n       impairment of body function or permanent serious disfigurement are\n       questions of law for the court if the court finds either of the following:\n\n              (i) There is no factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of\n       the person’s injuries.\n\n             (ii) There is a factual dispute concerning the nature and extent of the\n       person’s injuries, but the dispute is not material to the determination as to\n\n\n                                            12\n\f       whether the person has suffered a serious impairment of body function or\n       permanent serious disfigurement.\n\nIn addition, the Legislature defined “serious impairment of body function” to mean “an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” MCL 500.3135(7). In other words, the\n\nLegislature essentially rejected DiFranco and, with one exception, codified Cassidy.12\n\n                                 B. KREINER V FISCHER\n\n       In Kreiner, this Court for the first time interpreted the Legislature’s definition of\n\n“serious impairment of body function.” Because “generally” means “‘for the most part,’”\n\nKreiner held that “determining whether a plaintiff is ‘generally able’ to lead his normal\n\nlife requires considering whether the plaintiff is, ‘for the most part’ able to lead his\n\nnormal life.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 130, quoting Random House Webster’s College\n\nDictionary (1991).     In addition, because “lead” means “‘to conduct or bring in a\n\nparticular course,’” Kreiner held that “the effect of the impairment on the course of a\n\nplaintiff’s entire normal life must be considered.” Id. at 130-131, quoting Random House\n\nWebster’s Unabridged Dictionary (2001). Therefore, Kreiner concluded, “[a]lthough\n\nsome aspects of a plaintiff’s entire normal life may be interrupted by the impairment, if,\n\ndespite those impingements, the course or trajectory of the plaintiff’s normal life has not\n\n       12\n          That one exception is that while Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505, required an\nevaluation of “the effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal life,”\nMCL 500.3135(7) requires an evaluation of the effect of an injury on “the person’s\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” (Emphasis added.) That is, while the\nCassidy test was exclusively objective, the MCL 500.3135(7) test is at least partially\nsubjective.\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fbeen affected, then the plaintiff's ‘general ability’ to lead his normal life has not been\n\naffected and he does not meet the ‘serious impairment of body function’ threshold.” Id.\n\nat 131.\n\n          Kreiner established a “multi-step process . . . for separating out those plaintiffs\n\nwho meet the statutory threshold from those who do not.” Id. First, the court must\n\ndetermine whether there is a factual dispute that is material to the determination whether\n\nthe person has suffered a serious impairment of body function.13 Second, the court must\n\ndetermine whether an important body function has been impaired. Third, the court must\n\ndetermine whether the impairment is objectively manifested.14 Finally, the court must\n\ndetermine whether the impairment affects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life. “In determining whether the course of the plaintiff’s normal life has been\n\naffected, a court should engage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiff’s life\n\nbefore and after the accident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the\n\ncourse of the plaintiff’s overall life.” Id. at 132-133. Kreiner indicated that the following\n\nfactors may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiff’s general ability to\n\nconduct the course of his normal life has been affected:\n\n\n\n\n          13\n        If there is such a dispute, the court cannot decide the issue as a matter of law;\nhowever, if there is no such dispute, the court can so decide.\n          14\n               “Subjective complaints that are not medically documented are insufficient.” Id.\nat 132.\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f              (a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length\n      of treatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment,[15] (d) the extent\n      of any residual impairment,[16] and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery.\n      [Id. at 133.]\n\nAlthough the dissent in Kreiner essentially agreed with the majority’s analysis of the\n\nlanguage “an objectively manifested impairment of an important body function,” it\n\ndisagreed with the majority’s analysis of the language “that affects the person’s general\n\nability to lead his or her normal life.” Most significantly in this regard, the dissent\n\nrejected the factors set forth by the majority on the basis that “time or temporal\n\nconsiderations” are inappropriate considerations. Id. at 147 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).\n\n                             C. MAJORITY’S NEW TEST\n\n      It is appropriate that Justice CAVANAGH, the authoring justice of the majority\n\nopinion in DiFranco, which was rejected by the Legislature, and also the authoring\n\njustice of the dissent in Kreiner, which was rejected by this Court, is now the authoring\n\njustice of the majority opinion, in which Kreiner is overruled. While to some, there may\n\nbe a sense of justice, or at least a sense of irony, in this sequence of events, to others,\n\nincluding those of us in dissent in this case, such sequence embodies all that is wrong\n\nwhen a judiciary confuses its own preferences with those of the people’s representatives\n\nin the Legislature. While it is intriguing that Justice CAVANAGH now is able to transform\n\nhis dissent in Kreiner into a majority opinion, and thereby resuscitate his earlier opinion\n      15\n          “While an injury need not be permanent, it must be of sufficient duration to\naffect the course of a plaintiff’s life.” Id. at 135.\n      16\n          “Self-imposed restrictions, as opposed to physician-imposed restrictions, based\non real or perceived pain do not establish this point.” Id. at 133 n 17.\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fin DiFranco, this has been achieved only after the people of this state, through their\n\nLegislature, have made clear that DiFranco did not reflect what ought to be the policy of\n\nthis state. Therefore, just as he did in his dissent in Kreiner, Justice CAVANAGH, now\n\nwith majority support, rejects Kreiner’s analysis of the language “that affects the person’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” The worm has turned, and never mind\n\nwhat the people and their Legislature have sought to accomplish in establishing as the\n\nlaw.\n\n       Before proceeding too far into where our substantive disagreements lie, I would be\n\nremiss not to point out where we are in agreement. First, the majority, just as did the\n\nKreiner dissent, largely agrees with Kreiner’s analysis of MCL 500.3135(2)(a), i.e., if\n\nthere is no material factual dispute, whether a person has suffered a serious impairment of\n\nbody function should be determined by the court as a matter of law.17 The majority also\n\n\n\n       17\n           However, the majority indicates that this statute “could unconstitutionally\nconflict with MCR 2.116(C)(10) . . . .” Because I see no conflict between the statute and\nthe court rule, i.e., each allows the court to determine as a matter of law whether a person\nhas suffered a serious impairment of body function only if there are no material factual\ndisputes, I do not believe the statute is in any way unconstitutional. Moreover, the case\ncited by the majority in support of its suggestion that jury trials “promote judicial\nefficiency” actually stands for the exact opposite proposition. See Moll v Abbott\nLaboratories, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1956109\"><a href=\"/opinion/1956109/moll-v-abbott-laboratories/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26; 506 NW2d 816 (1993) (“Both our court rules and case law\nrecognize the desirability of allowing summary disposition, regardless of a jury request,\nwhen uncontroverted facts are presented to the court. This promotes efficiency and\npreservation of judicial resources.”). It is interesting that, although the majority\nacknowledges that the constitutionality of MCL 500.3135(2)(a) is not at issue here, it\nrepeatedly implies that MCL 500.3135(2)(a) “could” be unconstitutional, thus, making it\nobvious that MCL 500.3135(2)(a) will also likely fall within the majority’s effort to\nexpunge the jurisprudence of the past decade.\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\flargely agrees with Kreiner’s analysis of the language, “an objectively manifested\n\nimpairment of an important body function.”18 In addition, the majority agrees with\n\nKreiner’s conclusion that the serious impairment of body function threshold entails a\n\nsubjective analysis, i.e., “[w]hether an impairment that precludes a person from throwing\n\na ninety-five miles-an-hour fastball is a ‘serious impairment of body function’ may\n\ndepend on whether the person is a professional baseball player or an accountant who likes\n\nto play catch with his son every once in a while.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 134 n 19. The\n\n\n       I also disagree with the majority that “the disputed fact does not need to be\noutcome determinative in order to be material . . . .” MCL 500.3135(2)(a)(ii) states,\n“whether an injured person has suffered serious impairment of body function . . . [is a]\nquestion [] of law for the court if the court finds . . . [that the] factual dispute . . . is not\nmaterial to the determination as to whether the person has suffered a serious impairment\nof body function . . . .” That is, “[a]bsent an outcome-determinative genuine factual\ndispute, the issue of threshold injury is now a question of law for the court.” Kern v\nBlethen-Coluni, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341; 612 NW2d 838 (2000) (emphasis added).\nAlthough the majority cites Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed) in support of its proposition\nthat “the disputed fact does not need to be outcome determinative in order to be\nmaterial,” Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed) states the very opposite-- “[m]aterial fact is\none upon which outcome of litigation depends.” See also Black’s Law Dictionary (8th\ned), which defines “material” as “[h]aving some logical connection with the\nconsequential facts,” and Random House Webster’s College Dictionary, which defines\n“material” as “likely to influence the determination of a case.”\n       18\n          The majority does take issue with Kreiner’s conclusion that “[s]ubjective\ncomplaints that are not medically documented are insufficient” to establish that an\nimpairment is “objectively manifested.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132. However, given that\nthe majority agrees that “plaintiffs must ‘introduce evidence establishing that there is a\nphysical basis for their subjective complaints of pain and suffering,’” quoting DiFranco,\n427 Mich at 74, and I am uncertain what evidence other than medical documentation\nwould establish such a “physical basis,” it is not clear why the majority objects to\nKreiner’s statement that medical documentation is required. See also DiFranco, 427\nMich at 75 (“The ‘serious impairment of body function’ threshold requires the plaintiff to\nprove that his noneconomic losses arose out of a medically identifiable injury which\nseriously impaired a body function.”) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fmajority also agrees with Kreiner’s conclusion that determining whether a plaintiff’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life has been affected “necessarily requires a\n\ncomparison of the plaintiff’s life before and after the incident.”19 Finally, the majority\n\nagrees with Kreiner’s conclusion that permanency is not required.20\n\n                                  1. DIFRANCO VS. CASSIDY\n\n       However, this is where our agreements end. First, the majority takes issue with\n\nKreiner’s statement that “the Legislature largely rejected DiFranco in favor of Cassidy.”\n\nKreiner, 471 Mich at 121 n 8. As explained earlier, the Legislature adopted Cassidy with\n\na single exception. That single exception pertains to the fact that Cassidy, 415 Mich at\n\n505, required an evaluation of “the effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to\n\nlive a normal life,” while MCL 500.3135(7) requires an evaluation of the effect of an\n\ninjury on “the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nThat is, while the Cassidy test was entirely objective, the MCL 500.3135(7) test is at least\n\npartially subjective. As this Court explained in Kreiner, 471 Mich at 121 n 7:\n\n              [T]he Legislature modified the entirely objective Cassidy standard to\n       a partially objective and partially subjective inquiry. Thus, what is\n       “normal” is to be determined subjectively on the basis of the plaintiff’s own\n       life and not the life of some objective third party. However, once that is\n\n       19\n          The majority also indicates that “many other considerations could typically be\nrelevant to determining how an impairment affects a person’s ability to live in his or her\npre-incident normal manner of living.” The majority does not offer any further\nexplanation as to what these “many other considerations” might conceivably be.\n       20\n        Although Kreiner, 471 Mich at 135, specifically held that “an injury need not be\npermanent,” the majority nonetheless criticizes it for “effectively creat[ing] a permanency\nrequirement.”\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\f       fixed as the base, it is to be objectively determined whether the impairment\n       in fact affects the plaintiff’s “general ability to lead” that life.\n\nNevertheless, given that: (a) Cassidy, 415 Mich at 505, held that courts should “look[] to\n\nthe effect of an injury on the person’s general ability to live a normal life”; (b) DiFranco,\n\n427 Mich at 39, held that courts should not look to the effect of the injury on the person’s\n\n“‘general ability to live a normal life’”; and (c) the Legislature subsequently and\n\naffirmatively directed the courts to look to the effect of an injury on “the person’s general\n\nability to lead his or her normal life,” MCL 500.3135(7), the Legislature obviously\n\npreferred the policy of Cassidy to that of DiFranco. In addition, in contrast to DiFranco,\n\nand consistent with Cassidy, the Legislature expressly adopted an “important body\n\nfunction” requirement, MCL 500.3135(7), and amended MCL 500.3135 to make clear\n\nthat whether a serious impairment of body function has occurred is a question of law\n\nunless there is a material factual dispute. MCL 500.3135(2)(a). Thus, contrary to the\n\nmajority’s understandably defensive posture, it is hardly an “oversimplification” to\n\nconclude that the Legislature essentially rejected DiFranco in favor of Cassidy.21\n\n       Moreover, the Legislature’s action of amending MCL 500.3135 following\n\nDiFranco is an example of legislative history that has genuine utility in the interpretative\n\nprocess. This Court has emphasized that “not all legislative history is of equal value,”\n\nand has specifically noted that “[c]learly of the highest quality is legislative history that\n\nrelates to an action of the Legislature from which a court may draw reasonable inferences\n\n       21\n         Contrary to the majority’s contention, this dissent very clearly provides in the\nabove language “specific, substantive arguments” in support of this conclusion.\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\fabout the Legislature’s intent . . . .” In re Certified Question, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 n 5; 659\n\nNW2d 597 (2003).        The instant case presents an ideal “[e]xample[] of legitimate\n\nlegislative history,” i.e., the recitation of “actions of the Legislature intended to repudiate\n\nthe judicial construction of a statute . . . .” Id. And yet, not altogether inexplicably, the\n\nmajority entirely disregards these legislative actions.\n\n       Defendant and amicus curiae the Attorney General have presented the Court with\n\nlegislative analyses, committee reports, and other materials to support their argument\n\nthat, in enacting the amendments, the Legislature intended to repudiate DiFranco and\n\nrestore Cassidy, just as Kreiner held. Even the most cursory review of these documents\n\ndemonstrates that defendant and its amicus’ reading has merit. For example, the original\n\ndraft of House Bill 4341 was accompanied by a memorandum from its sponsor that stated\n\nthat the bill’s first goal was to “[r]eestablish the two-part Cassidy standard of: (1)\n\ndefinition of ‘serious impairment of body function,’ and (2) make the determination of\n\nwhether an injury is a serious impairment of body function a question of law (judge)\n\nrather than of fact (jury).” Memorandum of Representative Harold Voorhees enclosing\n\nthe original draft of HB 4341, February 8, 1995. Similarly, the House Legislative\n\nAnalysis expressly set forth the chronology of Cassidy and DiFranco, noting that\n\nDiFranco had “rejected” Cassidy and that the bill “would return to a tort threshold\n\nresembling that provided by the Cassidy ruling . . . .” House Legislative Analysis, HB\n\n4341, December 18, 1995.        The analysis provided to the Senate Financial Services\n\nCommittee likewise explained in the first sentence of the bill’s description that it “would\n\nput into law the Cassidy standards for meeting the serious impairment of body function\n\n\n                                              20\n\fthreshold.” Department of Commerce Bill Analysis of HB 4341, February 14, 1995.\n\nAnd finally, it is apparent from the statements of protest of the bill’s opponents that they\n\nalso clearly understood House Bill 4341 to be a “return to the Cassidy standard.”\n\nStatements of Senator Henry Stallings and Senator John Cherry, October 12, 1995.\n\n       While on several occasions I have explained why I do not find all forms of\n\nlegislative history to be useful tools in the interpretative process, see, e.g., Petersen v\n\nMagna Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836195\"><a href=\"/opinion/836195/petersen-v-magna-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 381-382;

One of the most common and compelling critiques of the use of\n\nlegislative history is that a judge can almost always find something in the legislative\n\nhistory to support the interpretation he personally wishes to give to a law. To borrow an\n\nanalogy invoked by United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, using\n\nlegislative history is like entering a room, looking over the assembled multitudes in the\n\ncrowd, and picking out your friends. See Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation (Princeton,\n\nNJ: Princeton University Press, 1997), at 36. In its near silence, the majority places a\n\nnew twist on this analogy, and illustrates another fundamental problem with the use of\n\nlegislative history. Here, the majority enters a room, and, finding no friends in sight,\n\nmakes a quick exit. Considering the quality and quantity of the legislative history\n\navailable here, the majority’s “quick exit” and its selective silence on the subject speaks\n\nvolumes. It should not go unremarked that it is this dissent that cites legislative history--\n\nalbeit a uniquely persuasive and bona fide form of legislative history-- as a relevant factor\n\nin interpreting MCL 500.3135, while the justices of the majority, the supposed advocates\n\n\n\nconclude that the statute is unambiguous, unless, of course, he does not believe that the\ndissenting justices are “reasonably well-informed persons.”\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\fof this mode of interpretation, exclude this from their consideration.           Apparently,\n\nlegislative history is to be considered when it supports a justice’s preferred interpretation,\n\nand ignored when it does not.\n\n       Indeed, the problem with this approach of sometimes relying on legislative history\n\nand sometimes not is, as I explained in my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 381-382, that\n\n       it is a process in which judges in the very guise of selecting the tools and\n       factors to be employed in “interpreting” the law are effectively its\n       formulators-- in short, judges who are wielding the legislative, not the\n       judicial, power.\n\n               A critical strength of a judicial philosophy committed to exercising\n       only the constitution’s “judicial power” is that reasonably clear rules of\n       decision-making are established before the fact. That is, a judge essentially\n       promises the parties that he or she will decide their case, as with all others,\n       by attempting to discern the reasonable meaning of relevant statutes or\n       contracts and that this will be done by relying upon recognized rules, and\n       tools, of interpretation. By contrast, under the [majority’s] approach . . . ,\n       in which there is essentially a limitless array of rules, and tools, that may be\n       employed for “defining” the law apart from its language, there is no\n       consistently applied interpretative process with which the judge promises\n       beforehand to comply. He or she may promise to be “fair,” and he or she\n       may seek to be fair, but there are no rules for how this fairness is to be\n       achieved. There is only the promise that the judge will address each\n       dispute on a case-by-case basis, using whatever rules, and whichever tools,\n       he or she believes are required in that instance. And the suspicion simply\n       cannot be avoided that these varying and indeterminate rules, and tools,\n       may be largely a function of the outcome preferred by the judge and by his\n       or her personal attitudes toward the parties and their causes. Any\n       interpretative rules will be identified only after the fact, and these “rules”\n       may or may not have been invoked in resolving yesterday’s dispute, and\n       may or may not be employed in resolving tomorrow’s dispute. Any judge\n       can concoct an after-the-fact rationale for a decision; the judicial process,\n       however, is predicated upon before-the-fact rationales. An ad hoc process\n       is not a judicial process at all. In the place of predetermined rules--\n       otherwise understood as the rule of law-- the [majority] would substitute\n       rules to be determined later. [Emphasis in the original.]\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f                          2. “TRAJECTORY” AND “ENTIRE”\n\n       Next, the majority peremptorily rejects Kreiner’s use of the words “trajectory” and\n\n“entire.” Again, the pertinent statutory language being defined here is, “that affects the\n\nperson’s general ability to lead his or her normal life.” MCL 500.3135(7). “Lead” is\n\ndefined as “to conduct or bring . . . in a particular course,” and, as the majority\n\nacknowledges, “‘trajectory’ is a synonym for ‘course.’”        Random House Webster’s\n\nCollege Dictionary (1991). In addition, contrary to the majority’s contention, Kreiner’s\n\nuse of the word “entire” was not “created out of thin air.” Instead, the use of the word\n\n“entire” derived from the Legislature’s use of the word “general” because “in general”\n\nmeans “with respect to the entirety.” Random House Webster’s College Dictionary\n\n(1991) (emphasis added). More accurately, it is the meaning that the majority gives to\n\n“general” that is “created out of thin air.”      The majority concludes that the word\n\n“general” means “some,” even though the definition that the majority itself relies upon\n\ndoes not even include “some,” but instead indicates that “general” means “whole,”\n\n“every,” “majority,” “prevalent,” “usually,” “in most instances,” “not limited,” and “main\n\nfeatures.”   Nowhere among these possible meanings can a reader sight the word\n\n“some.”23\n\n\n       23\n          I find it interesting that the authoring justice of the majority opinion once\nchastised me for “leav[ing] no dictionary unturned,” with regards to an opinion in which I\ncited two different dictionaries, People v Raby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501; 572 NW2d 644\n(1998) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), and, here, he cites seven different dictionaries and\nstill cannot quite find a definition that serves his purpose. While considering relevant\ndictionary definitions can be a valuable tool of interpretation, the majority’s generous use\nof dictionaries here is noteworthy because the majority has questioned the propriety and\n\n\n                                            24\n\f                              3. TEMPORAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n       Finally, the majority rejects the non-exhaustive list of factors that Kreiner set forth\n\nfor consideration in evaluating whether the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal\n\nlife has been affected. The majority asserts that Kreiner “departed . . . from the statutory\n\ntext, by providing an extra-textual ‘nonexhaustive list of objective factors’ to be used to\n\ncompare the plaintiff’s pre- and post-incident lifestyle.” This critique is quite surprising\n\ngiven that it is not uncommon for courts in general, and for this Court in particular, to\n\nprovide “extra-textual” factors to be considered in interpreting a statute that demands a\n\nfact-specific analysis.24 To the best of my knowledge, members of this majority have\n\nnever before complained about this practice, but consistency in the application and non-\n\napplication of interpretative factors is hardly a preoccupation of this majority.25\n\n\n\n\nusefulness of this tool in the past. Jones v Olson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1176 (2008) (“In the\nlegal context, using a dictionary to unwaveringly determine the legislative intent behind a\nstatute is nothing more than barely hidden judicial activism.”) (WEAVER, J., dissenting)\n(Then-Justice KELLY and Justice CAVANAGH joined Justice WEAVER’s dissenting\nstatement).\n       24\n           I use the phrase “extra-textual” factors only because this is the phrase the\nmajority uses. However, in truth, I do not believe that the factors articulated in Kreiner\nare at all “extra-textual,” because these have been derived directly from the text of the\nstatute itself.\n       25\n          Indeed, as I explained in my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 380, the majority’s\n“interpretative” process seems to consist of “picking and choosing at [its] discretion from\namong some uncertain array of tools lying ‘beyond the plain language of the statute [or\ncontract].’” (Citation omitted.) The problem with this approach is that “[t]he litigants\nwill, of course, have no notice beforehand of which tools are to be employed, for the\njustices themselves will not know this beforehand.” Id. The rule gleaned from the\ninstant case is apparently that it is appropriate to employ “extra-textual” factors, but only\n\n\n                                             25\n\f      Indeed, in DiFranco itself, Justice CAVANAGH provided numerous “extra-textual”\n\nfactors to be considered in determining whether a plaintiff has established a serious\n\nimpairment of body function. DiFranco, 427 Mich at 69-70, states:\n\n             In determining whether the impairment of body function was\n      serious, the jury should consider such factors as the extent of the\n      impairment, the particular body function impaired, the length of time the\n      impairment lasted, the treatment required to correct the impairment, and\n      any other relevant factors.\n\nIndeed, these “extra-textual” factors are remarkably similar to the Kreiner factors: “(a)\n\nthe nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length of treatment required, (c)\n\nthe duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of any residual impairment, and (e) the\n\nprognosis for eventual recovery.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 133. It not clear why the\n\nauthoring justice thought it acceptable to list “extra-textual” factors in DiFranco, but\n\nunacceptable to cite virtually the same factors in Kreiner.

The statute requires a fact-specific analysis.         As Justice CAVANAGH’s\n\nDiFranco opinion and numerous other decisions of this Court have recognized, such\n\n      26\n          In his dissent in Smith v Khouri, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 544; 751 NW2d 472 (2008),\nJustice CAVANAGH affirmed his satisfaction with the Wood “factors,” even though these\nfactors are obviously “extra-textual.”\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\ffactors assist courts in applying the statutory language on a case-by-case basis. To date,\n\nnone of the members of the majority have objected to the inclusion of such factors in any\n\nother of this Court’s decisions.\n\n       Nevertheless, the majority rejects Kreiner’s “extra-textual” factors on the basis\n\nthat they all “include a temporal component,” reiterating the argument made by the\n\nKreiner dissent that “the statute does not create an express temporal requirement as to\n\nhow long an impairment must last.” Ante at __, see also Kreiner, 471 Mich at 147\n\n(CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (“[T]he serious impairment of body function threshold does\n\nnot suggest any sort of temporal limitation. . . . Therefore, the duration of the impairment\n\nis not an appropriate inquiry.”). Indeed, the majority now holds that it is unnecessary to\n\nconsider whether the impairment even “continues to affect [plaintiff’s] general ability to\n\nlead his pre-incident ‘normal life’ . . . .” (Emphasis added.)\n\n       The majority, not surprisingly, claims that this dissent mischaracterizes its holding\n\nwhen we conclude that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant in the\n\nmajority’s holding. Not only, as explained above, is my characterization of their holding\n\nsupported by the actual language of the majority opinion, but it is also dictated by simple\n\nlogic. That is, given that the majority rejects Kreiner’s factors because they all “include a\n\ntemporal component,” given that it feels passionately enough about this to write a lengthy\n\nopinion overruling Kreiner, and given that we can discern no other significant departure\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\ffrom Kreiner in the majority’s new test than that of the temporal component,27 it is\n\ndifficult to escape the conclusion we reach here, that the majority believes that temporal\n\nconsiderations are wholly or largely irrelevant.\n\n       I am reminded of a famous Sherlock Holmes line:\n\n             “How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the\n       impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?”\n       [A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of the Four, from The Complete Sherlock\n       Holmes (New York: Doubleday, 1890), ch 6, p 111.]\n\nThat is, given that the majority essentially agrees with everything in Kreiner but its\n\ntemporal considerations,28 Kreiner’s temporal considerations are all that remain as to our\n\n\n\n       27\n          As explained above, there are other discrepancies between Kreiner and the\nmajority’s opinion, i.e., the DiFranco/Cassidy and the “trajectory/entire” discrepancies.\nHowever, these two discrepancies are intertwined with our disagreement about whether\ntemporal considerations should be considered. By returning our law to DiFranco, at\nwhich time the plaintiff’s “general ability to lead his or her normal life” was not at issue,\nit is much easier for the majority to claim that temporal considerations are wholly or\nlargely irrelevant. In addition, because the majority believes that it is inappropriate to\nconsider either the “trajectory” or the “entire” person’s life, it believes that temporal\nconsiderations, such as the duration of the impairment, are wholly or largely irrelevant.\nHowever, because we conclude that the statute clearly precludes a return to DiFranco,\nsince the Legislature has very clearly indicated that the plaintiff’s “general ability to lead\nhis or her normal life” is at issue, we believe that temporal considerations are relevant.\nSimilarly, because we believe that the “trajectory” or the “entire” person’s life should be\nconsidered, we believe that temporal considerations, such as the duration of the\nimpairment, are, in fact, highly relevant.\n       28\n           The majority essentially agrees with: (1) Kreiner’s analysis of MCL\n500.3135(2)(a), i.e., if there is no material factual dispute, whether a person has suffered\na serious impairment of body function should be determined by the court as a matter of\nlaw; (2) Kreiner’s analysis of the language, “an objectively manifested impairment of an\nimportant body function”; (3) Kreiner’s conclusion that the serious impairment of body\nfunction threshold entails a subjective analysis; (4) Kreiner’s conclusion that determining\nwhether a plaintiff’s general ability to lead his or her normal life has been affected\n\n\n                                             29\n\fdisagreement.     Therefore, that the majority disagrees with Kreiner’s temporal\n\nconsiderations, such as the duration of the impairment, “must be the truth.” In other\n\nwords, when comparing the Kreiner test and the majority’s new test-- whatever that is\n\nintended to be-- the only apparent substantive difference is that, while Kreiner expressly\n\nincludes temporal considerations, the majority’s test does not. Given that the majority\n\nessentially agrees with everything in Kreiner but its temporal considerations, and given\n\nthat the only reason it gives for rejecting these considerations is that they all “include a\n\ntemporal component,” how can we deduce anything other than that the majority holds\n\nthat temporal considerations, such as the duration of the impairment, are irrelevant?\n\n       Furthermore, if temporal considerations are not irrelevant, why does the majority\n\nnot explain in what way these are relevant, or how, in fact, the majority views the\n\nrelevancy of temporal considerations, and how these views differ from those expressed in\n\nKreiner? This glaring void in explanation of its own test in the majority opinion can only\n\nbe explained by the fact that the majority is holding that temporal considerations are\n\nwholly or largely irrelevant.\n\n       In sum, if temporal considerations are relevant: (1) why is the majority overruling\n\nKreiner; (2) why does the majority reject Kreiner’s factors, such as the duration of the\n\nimpairment; (3) why does the majority not include temporal considerations within its new\n\ntest; (4) why does the majority fail to explain the relevancy of temporal considerations;\n\n\n\n“necessarily requires a comparison of the plaintiff’s life before and after the incident”;\nand (5) Kreiner’s conclusion that permanency is not required.\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\f(5) why does the majority conclude that it is unnecessary to consider whether the\n\nimpairment “continues to affect [plaintiff’s] general ability to lead his pre-incident\n\n‘normal life’”; and (6) perhaps most tellingly, why does not the majority clarify its\n\nposition, whatever it may be, in light of this dissent? Simply saying that our conclusion\n\nis “erroneous” does not make it so, and, even more to the point, will hardly assist the\n\nbench and bar of this state in determining whether, and how, temporal considerations\n\nsomehow remain relevant after today’s decision.\n\n      For these reasons, we are unable to avoid the conclusion that the majority is,\n\nindeed, holding that temporal considerations are wholly or largely irrelevant, even though\n\nthis “improbable” result constitutes a departure from Cassidy, DiFranco, and Kreiner,\n\nand makes utterly no sense. How can it possibly be determined whether an impairment\n\n“affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life” without taking into\n\naccount temporal considerations? As Kreiner, 471 Mich at 133 n 18, inquired:\n\n             Does the dissent [now the majority] really believe that an\n      impairment lasting only a few moments has the same effect on a person’s\n      “general ability to lead his or her normal life” as an impairment lasting\n      several years or that an impairment requiring annual treatment has the same\n      effect on a person’s “general ability to lead his or her normal life” as an\n      impairment requiring daily treatment?\n\nDoes the majority really believe that the Legislature intended for the serious impairment\n\nthreshold to be met in every instance where an objectively manifested impairment of an\n\nimportant body function affected a person’s ability to lead his normal life for a mere\n\nmoment in time? What if a person gets hit in the head and passes out for five minutes,\n\nbut after those five minutes is completely unaffected by the impairment? If all temporal\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\fconsiderations are irrelevant, would not this person satisfy the majority’s threshold,\n\nbecause his general ability to lead his normal life was certainly affected for those five\n\nminutes of unconsciousness? Under the majority’s rule, it is apparently irrelevant that the\n\nperson arose after those five minutes and led a completely normal life thereafter. The\n\nmajority asserts that all that matters is that for that moment in time, the person’s general\n\nability to lead his normal life had been affected. I am not sure that the majority’s new\n\nthreshold can even be called a “threshold” when it can be satisfied in virtually every\n\nautomobile accident case that results in injury.29 As long as the plaintiff has suffered an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of an important body function, that plaintiff will have\n\nsatisfied the majority’s threshold, because the majority has essentially read the third\n\ncriterion, i.e., “that affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life,” out\n\nof the statute.\n\n       The clearest illustration of the difficulty in determining whether an impairment\n\n“affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her normal life” without taking into\n\naccount temporal considerations is the majority’s own inability to do so.30 In determining\n\n\n       29\n        It certainly is a “threshold” bearing no resemblance to the other two thresholds--\n“permanent serious disfigurement” and “death.” See MCL 500.3135(1).\n       30\n          The majority criticizes Kreiner as “def[ying] practical workability” on the basis\nthat “Kreiner has led to inconsistent interpretation of the statutory language, with\nsimilarly situated plaintiffs being treated differently by different courts.” However, in his\nopinion in DiFranco, 427 Mich at 56-57, Justice CAVANAGH has already provided an\nexplanation for why this might be the case:\n\n              Conflicting results have also arisen among cases involving similarly\n       injured plaintiffs. This is undoubtedly because no two plaintiffs are injured\n\n\n                                              32\n\fwhether the plaintiff in the instant case suffered an impairment that affects his general\n\nability to lead his normal life, the majority itself repeatedly cites temporal considerations.\n\nFor example, the majority indicates that “for a month after the incident, plaintiff could\n\nnot bear weight on his left ankle”; “[h]e underwent two surgeries over a period of 10\n\nmonths and multiple months of physical therapy”; “after the incident he was unable to\n\nperform functions necessary for his job for at least 14 months”; “he did not return to work\n\nfor 19 months”; and “he missed fishing for a year after the incident.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nAre such temporal considerations irrelevant or relevant? Do we interpret the words or the\n\nactions of the majority? And, if temporal considerations are irrelevant, how are we to\n\ndetermine whether an impairment affects a plaintiff’s “general ability to lead his normal\n\nlife”? The majority does not appear to know the answers, and it appears not to care that it\n\ndoes not know.\n\n       Indeed, under the majority’s new threshold, it would seem that the moment the\n\nplaintiff in this case went to the emergency room and it was determined that he had\n\nbroken his ankle, the threshold was met. For at that moment, plaintiff could not work.\n\nWhile at the emergency room, and for some measurable time afterwards, plaintiff’s\n\n\n\n       or recover in precisely the same manner. These conflicting results indicate\n       that threshold issues are often questions upon which reasonable minds can\n       differ.\n\nMoreover, if the Court of Appeals is inconsistently or incorrectly applying Kreiner, this\nCourt has a mechanism to rectify such errors-- reversing such decisions, not overruling\nprecedent and substituting an incomprehensible new standard bearing no relationship to\nthe law being interpreted.\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\fbroken ankle affected not just some, but all, of his capacity to live his normal life. Under\n\nthe majority’s non-temporal test, there is apparently no need to consider anything beyond\n\nthe emergency room visit. If this reading of its decision is wrong, once again, the\n\nmajority might wish to explain why this is so for the benefit of the bench, the bar, and the\n\npublic.\n\n          In crafting its new threshold, the majority would also have been wise to consider\n\nthe larger no-fault statute. Recall that the Legislature has decided that an injured plaintiff\n\nshould only be allowed to sue to recover noneconomic damages resulting from an\n\nautomobile accident where he or she has suffered: (a) death; (b) permanent serious\n\ndisfigurement; or (c) serious impairment of body function. MCL 500.3135. It is well\n\nestablished that “‘[w]hen construing a series of terms . . . we are guided by the principle\n\nthat words grouped in a list should be given related meaning.’” In re Complaint of Rovas\n\nAgainst SBC Mich, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114; 754 NW2d 259 (2008) (citation omitted). “In other\n\nwords, this Court applies the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, which ‘stands for the principle\n\nthat a word or phrase is given meaning by its context of setting.’” Id. (citation omitted).\n\nTherefore, as this Court explained in Cassidy, 415 Mich at 503:\n\n                 In determining the seriousness of the injury required for a “serious\n          impairment of body function”, this threshold should be considered in\n          conjunction with the other threshold requirements for a tort action for\n          noneconomic loss, namely, death and permanent serious disfigurement.\n          MCL 500.3135 . . . . The Legislature clearly did not intend to erect two\n          significant obstacles to a tort action for noneconomic loss and one quite\n          insignificant obstacle.[31]\n\n          31\n          See also DiFranco, 427 Mich at 95 (WILLIAMS, C.J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (“In the statutory language, ‘serious impairment of body function’\n\n\n                                              34\n\fIn addition, the Legislature defined “serious impairment of body function” to mean “an\n\nobjectively manifested impairment of an important body function that affects the person’s\n\ngeneral ability to lead his or her normal life.” MCL 500.3135(7). Obviously, in enacting\n\nthis threshold language, and in joining it with “death” and “serious permanent\n\ndisfigurement,” the Legislature was unlikely to have had in mind an impairment that only\n\naffected a plaintiff’s ability to lead his normal life for a moment in time, with no\n\nconsideration being given to the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life beyond\n\nthat moment. Indeed, it is quite certain that this is not what the Legislature had in mind,\n\ngiven that the very premise of the no-fault act, and the core of the accompanying\n\nlegislative compromise, was that some injured persons would not be able to recover\n\nnoneconomic damages, so that all injured persons would be able to recover economic loss\n\nbenefits regardless of fault.\n\n                                      D. APPLICATION\n\n       As explained earlier, both Kreiner and the majority agree that the court must first\n\ndetermine whether there is a factual dispute that is material to the determination whether\n\nplaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function. Here, there are no material\n\nfactual disputes. Before the accident, plaintiff worked approximately 60 hours a week\n\nand for the six months immediately before the accident, plaintiff’s position was that of a\n\nmedium truck loader. Additionally, plaintiff fished and golfed. Twelve months after the\n\n\nappears with the other threshold requirements of ‘permanent serious disfigurement’ and\n‘death,’ leaving the strong implication, under the rule of ejusdem generis, that while the\nimpairment need not be permanent or fatal, it was not to be transient or trivial either.”).\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\faccident, plaintiff’s surgeon cleared him to return to work with no restrictions. Seventeen\n\nmonths after the accident, plaintiff returned to work and has been able to perform all of\n\nhis job duties since then. During the entire time he was recuperating, plaintiff could tend\n\nto his needs and there was no effect on his relationship with his then-fiancée.\n\nAdditionally, plaintiff continued to fish and golf. Thus, I agree with the majority that\n\nthere are no factual disputes that are material to the determination of whether plaintiff\n\nsuffered a serious impairment of a body function. The facts are clear.\n\n       I also agree with the majority that the “body function” that was “impaired,” the\n\nability to walk, was “important,” and that the impairment was “objectively manifested.”\n\nAlthough plaintiff was able to walk to some extent, his ability to do so was impaired, and\n\nhis impairment, a broken ankle, was recognized by his doctors. The final, and critical,\n\ninquiry in this case concerns whether the impairment affects plaintiff’s “general ability to\n\nlead his normal life.” This is where the majority and I depart. The Kreiner analysis\n\nrequires a comparison of plaintiff’s life before the accident and after the accident,\n\nincluding “the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiff’s overall\n\nlife.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132-133. To aid in this analysis, the following factors may\n\nbe considered:\n\n              (a) the nature and extent of the impairment, (b) the type and length\n       of treatment required, (c) the duration of the impairment, (d) the extent of\n       any residual impairment, and (e) the prognosis for eventual recovery. [Id.\n       at 133.]\n\n       Plaintiff’s ability to walk, as just noted, was impaired by a broken ankle.\n\nHowever, once plaintiff’s ankle was placed in a cast at the emergency room, he was able\n\n\n\n                                            36\n\fto walk with the aid of crutches. And, immediately following his initial surgery in which\n\na device was implanted to stabilize his ankle, plaintiff was still able to walk with\n\ncrutches, although he was instructed not to place any weight on his ankle for one month.\n\nPlaintiff underwent physical therapy and nine months later, in October of 2005, plaintiff\n\nagain underwent surgery to remove the device. By January 2006 (one year after the\n\naccident), plaintiff’s surgeon had cleared plaintiff to return to work with no restrictions.\n\nHowever, plaintiff claimed that he could not keep up with the demands of his job and\n\nthus was placed back on workers’ compensation. Although plaintiff’s subjective reports\n\nof his pain from January 2006 forward varied greatly,32 the March 2006 FCE supported\n\nplaintiff’s claim that he could not fully perform all of his previous job duties; however,\n\nthis was due in part to a preexisting and unrelated shoulder injury. After plaintiff’s\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits were terminated, however, plaintiff requested another\n\nFCE, and, on August 1, 2006, the FCE showed that plaintiff was able to perform essential\n\njob demands with no restrictions. Plaintiff returned to work on August 16, 2006, and has\n\nbeen able to perform his job duties since that time.\n\n\n       32\n          As already discussed, in January 2006, plaintiff reported to his surgeon that his\nankle was not giving him any pain; in March of 2006, plaintiff reported during his FCE\nthat his pain was a three out of ten; in June of 2006, plaintiff reported to his physiatrist\nthat his pain was a six out of ten; in August 2006, plaintiff reported during his FCE that\nhis pain was as low as zero out of ten (at which point, he returned to work); and in\nOctober of 2006, plaintiff reported during his deposition that his life was “normal” with\nsome pain. These drastically inconsistent reports of pain demonstrate why, with regard to\nthe “extent of any residual impairment,” “[s]elf-imposed restrictions, as opposed to\nphysician-imposed restrictions, based on real or perceived pain do not establish this\npoint.” Kreiner, 471 Mich at 133 n 17.\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\f       Although plaintiff was assigned to a position that was less physically demanding\n\nthan the position he had been performing before he was injured, plaintiff did this\n\nvoluntarily and he suffered no loss in pay. Moreover, at the time plaintiff was injured, he\n\nhad only been in that position for six months and, since he began to work for Allied in\n\n2002, he had worked in three different positions. Thus, the fact that defendant was\n\nassigned to a different position upon his return is not particularly significant in this\n\nCourt’s analysis.\n\n       Plaintiff’s only argument regarding his inability to lead his normal life is that he\n\nwas unable to work at certain times. During the time he was recuperating, plaintiff could\n\ncare for himself and tend to his household chores without assistance. His relationship\n\nwith his fiancée/wife was unaffected. And he was able to enjoy his recreational activities\n\nwithout interruption. By plaintiff’s own admission, his life was “normal” with some\n\n“occasional aching” that was not aggravated by any activities, including standing or\n\nprolonged walking. It is fair to say that by August of 2006 plaintiff had fully recovered\n\nfrom his broken ankle. Because only plaintiff’s ability to work was affected and because\n\nthis only lasted, at the very lengthiest, 17 months, the lower courts did not err in\n\nconcluding that the impairment did not affect plaintiff’s “general ability to lead his\n\nnormal life” and, therefore, that plaintiff did not meet the “serious impairment of body\n\nfunction” threshold.\n\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\f                                    E. STARE DECISIS\n\n       The majority overrules Kreiner while paying its usual lip service to stare decisis.33\n\nMy fundamental disagreement with the majority’s application of the stare decisis doctrine\n\nis quite easily summarized. In Robinson v Detroit, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 464; 613 NW2d 307\n\n(2000), this Court drew on past caselaw and identified several relevant considerations in\n\ndetermining whether a case should be overruled under stare decisis.34 As explained\n\n\n\n       33\n           It is of interest that this is the second time the authoring justice has authored an\nopinion overruling an earlier case making it easier for a plaintiff to establish a serious\nimpairment of body function. In DiFranco, he authored an opinion overruling Cassidy.\nJustice WILLIAMS complained: “Four years after this Court issued its opinion in Cassidy\nv McGovern, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192768\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192768/cassidy-v-mcgovern/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 330 NW2d 22 (1982), the majority sees fit to overrule the\ndecision of five members of a six-member court and adopt the position of the dissent in\nthat case.” DiFranco, 427 Mich at 92 (WILLIAMS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). In this case, the authoring justice again sees fit to overrule a case that was decided\nonly six years ago and to adopt his own dissenting opinion from that case. While it is by\nnow clear what the authoring justice believes the no-fault policies of this state ought to\nbe, it is considerably less clear what connection these views bear to those of the people\nand their Legislature.\n       34\n         The fact that the lead opinion relies far more on Chief Justice KELLY’s opinion\nin Petersen, which only Justice CAVANAGH joined, than on the majority opinion in\nRobinson should not go unnoticed. For a discussion of Chief Justice KELLY’s Petersen\nstandard for overruling precedent, see my dissent in Petersen, 484 Mich at 350.\n\n       Concerning the statements of Justices HATHAWAY and WEAVER about stare\ndecisis:\n\n               Justice HATHAWAY contends that stare decisis constitutes a “policy\n       consideration” and that the “particular analytical approach will differ from\n       case to case.” Similarly, Justice WEAVER contends that stare decisis\n       constitutes a “principle of policy” and that there is no need for a\n       “standardized test for stare decisis,” as long as justices exercise “judicial\n       restraint, common sense, and a sense of fairness.” The problem with these\n       “approaches” is that “litigants will, of course, have no notice beforehand of\n       which [“analytical approach”] will be employed, for the justices themselves\n\n\n                                              39\n\fherein, Kreiner was the first occasion on which this Court was called upon to interpret the\n\n1995 amendments to MCL 500.3135. Kreiner gave effect to the legislative intent as\n\nexpressed in the language of the amended statute and was not, in my judgment, wrongly\n\ndecided. Nonetheless, my disagreement with the majority on this point is not the thrust\n\nof this section. Rather, it is to remind the majority “that there are larger issues at stake in\n\nthis case: the rule of law, respect for precedent, the integrity of this Court, and judicial\n\nrestraint.

One cannot reconcile this view of legislative\nacquiescence and stare decisis with the majority’s decision to overrule Kreiner. Kreiner\nwas this Court’s first interpretation of the amended MCL 500.3135, and, although bills\nwere subsequently introduced that would have abolished Kreiner, such bills were\nrepeatedly rejected by the Legislature. See, e.g., SB 1429 (2004); SB 618, HB 4846, and\nHB 4940 (2005); SB 445, HB 4301, and HB 4999 (2007); and SB 83 and HB 4680\n(2009). Therefore, what is the majority’s “sound and specific justification” for departing\nfrom Kreiner? Paige, 476 Mich at 541 (CAVANAGH, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart).

[Ante at __.]\n\nHowever, the position of the dissenting justices on stare decisis has not changed a whit\n\nsince we were in the majority; by contrast, the position of the majority justices is\n\nunrecognizable.\n\n       It has always been our position that stare decisis is not an “inexorable command,”\n\nand that a judge’s primary obligation is to the law and the constitution, not to the\n\njudgments of his or her predecessors. To that end, we have always asserted that there are\n\nmultiple judicial values that must be assessed in any case in which previous decisions of\n\nthe Court are implicated. In every such case, a judge must respectfully consider the\n\ninterests served by stare decisis-- predictability and certainty in the law, and the\n\nuniformity of its application. However, in every such case, a judge must also consider\n\nthe interests served by interpreting the law correctly-- regard for the lawmaker, adherence\n\nto constitutional dictates concerning the “judicial power” and the separation of powers,\n\nand competing predictability and certainty interests that are served where the law means\n\nwhat it plainly says. Robinson, 462 Mich at 464-468. As we explained in Robinson:\n\n              [I]t is well to recall in discussing reliance, when dealing with an area\n       of the law that is statutory . . . , that it is to the words of the statute itself\n       that a citizen first looks for guidance in directing his actions. This is the\n       essence of the rule of law: to know in advance what the rules of society are.\n       Thus, if the words of the statute are clear, the actor should be able to\n       expect, that is, rely, that they will be carried out by all in society, including\n       the courts. In fact, should a court confound those legitimate citizen\n       expectations by misreading or misconstruing a statute, it is that court itself\n       that has disrupted the reliance interest. When that happens, a subsequent\n\n\n                                              51\n\f       court, rather than holding to the distorted reading because of the doctrine of\n       stare decisis, should overrule the earlier court’s misconstruction. The\n       reason for this is that the court in distorting the statute was engaged in a\n       form of judicial usurpation that runs counter to the bedrock principle of\n       American constitutionalism, i.e., that the lawmaking power is reposed in\n       the people as reflected in the work of the Legislature, and, absent a\n       constitutional violation, the courts have no legitimacy in overruling or\n       nullifying the people’s representatives. Moreover, not only does such a\n       compromising by a court of the citizen’s ability to rely on a statute have no\n       constitutional warrant, it can gain no higher pedigree as later courts repeat\n       the error. [Id. at 467-468.]\n\nThat has been the consistent approach of the dissenting justices, and this continues to be\n\nour approach. Respect for stare decisis is a critical judicial value, but so is a regard for\n\nthe constitutional processes of government by which a judge strives to interpret the law in\n\naccordance with its actual language. Balancing these values is sometimes difficult, and\n\nreasonable people can often disagree as to how this balance should be struck. Robinson\n\nsupplies one attempt at identifying the factors that courts have traditionally looked to in\n\nstriking this balance in a consistent and reasonable manner. Despite suggestions to the\n\ncontrary, Robinson does not establish a “mechanical” process, but simply attempts to\n\nafford reasonable guidance in achieving a fair equilibrium between stare decisis and\n\ngetting the law right.49\n\n       However, as explained above, the justices now in the majority who were on the\n\nCourt at the time took a quite different approach to stare decisis when they were in the\n\nminority. As Justice YOUNG has explained:\n\n       49\n          Given that it has always been our position that Robinson does not establish a\n“mechanical” process, it is not surprising that the majority has been able to identify a\nsingle case in which we overruled precedent without specifically citing Robinson.\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\f              [Our] position on stare decisis has not changed, and the [the\n       majority] attempts to shift focus to [us] in order to avoid confronting [their]\n       own inconsistency. The public should understand when Justices’ positions\n       on important matters shift. And that is the focus of this dissent: when the\n       [majority] justice[s] [were] in the minority, [they] liked stare decisis a lot;\n       now that [they are] in the majority, it is not an issue. That is the “irony” the\n       public should understand. [Anglers, __ Mich at __ (2010) (YOUNG, J.,\n       dissenting), order entered June 18, 2010 (Docket Nos. 138863 to 138866).]\n\nThe majority entirely misapprehends our criticism of its record on stare decisis if it thinks\n\nthat we are simply counting the number of occasions on which they have reversed\n\nprecedent over the past term and a half. That is not our intention at all. We freely\n\nacknowledge that we too reversed precedents when we were in the majority-- although\n\nhardly at their remarkable pace. That is not the nub of our critique. Rather, the nub is:\n\n(a) that the majority justices have demonstrated a remarkably inconsistent and “flexible”\n\nattitude toward stare decisis, in which their views on the subject appear to be nothing\n\nmore than a function of whether they are in the majority or the minority; and (b) that the\n\nmajority justices equate their own reversals of precedent, in which they have widened the\n\ndistance between the law of the lawmaker and the law of the court, with the previous\n\nmajority’s reversals in which we did the opposite.\n\n       “[N]o meaningful discussion of a court’s attitude toward precedent can be based\n\nsolely on an arithmetical analysis in which raw numbers of overrulings are simply\n\ncounted. Such an analysis obscures that not all precedents are built alike, that some are\n\nbetter reasoned than others, that some are grounded in the exercise of discretionary\n\njudgments and others in the interpretation of plain language, that some are thorough in\n\ntheir analyses and others superficial.” Rowland v Washtenaw Co Rd Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span>\n\n\n\n                                             <span class=\"page\">53</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f197, 226; 731 NW2d 41 (2007) (MARKMAN, J., concurring). The chart set forth in\n\nRowland demonstrates, we believe, that the overrulings of precedent that occurred\n\nbetween January 1, 2000 until Rowland was decided on May 2, 2007 “overwhelmingly\n\ncame in cases involving what the justices in the majority [at that time] view[ed] as the\n\nmisinterpretation of straightforward words and phrases in statutes and contracts, in which\n\nwords that were not there were read into the law or words that were there were read out\n\nof the law.” Id. That is, these reversals of precedent sought more closely to equate our\n\nstate’s caselaw with our statutes, while the reversals of precedent of the present majority\n\nhave achieved exactly the opposite.\n\n      Thus, the present majority has regard neither for precedent nor for the most\n\nsignificant competing value that would sometimes warrant overturning a precedent, to\n\nwit, that it is not in accord with the words of the lawmaker. In the end, the majority’s\n\napproach to stare decisis is empty and incoherent.       The majority has unsettled the\n\nprecedents of this Court at a Guinness world’s record pace, and it has done so while\n\ndisserving both the values of stare decisis and that of a court acting in accordance with\n\nthe constitutional separation of powers to respect the decisions of the lawmaker. The\n\nmajority has run amuck in service of values that have no grounding in either stare decisis,\n\nor in any other conception of the “judicial power,” other than that they comprise an\n\narithmetical majority of this Court. In this regard, the majority confuses power and\n\nauthority. The majority unsettles and confuses the law both in its disregard for this\n\nCourt’s previous decisions and in its equal disregard for the language of the law. It\n\ncompounds the confusion it fosters in one realm with the confusion that it fosters in the\n\n\n                                            54\n\fother.50 There is no saving grace in its reversals of precedent, no balancing of difficult\n\njudicial principles, no apparent recognition of the values served by either of the\n\ncompeting considerations involved where precedents are at issue, and no thoughtful effort\n\nto articulate even the roughest principles for its actions. In its destructive march through\n\nthe caselaw of this state to identify surviving and straggling decisions that need to be\n\n“taken out,” the majority furthers no discernible legal value of any kind, other than\n\nlitigation and still more litigation. In the end, there is no legal core to the majority’s\n\napproach to stare decisis, and it is left with nothing other than a feeble effort to equate its\n\nown actions with those of the dissenting justices when they were in the majority. “We\n\nare no worse than you,” is the majority’s banner, when in truth the majority has not the\n\nslightest conception of our approach to stare decisis, and not the slightest conception of\n\nthe damage that their own approach to stare decisis is doing to the citizens of this state\n\nwho wish to act in accordance with the law and who wish to understand their rights and\n\nobligations under that law.\n\n                      F. UNDOING THE LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE\n\n       As discussed earlier, although virtually all legislation involves some sort of\n\ncompromise, the no-fault act, in particular, entailed a substantial and well-understood\n\n\n       50\n         See, for example, The Detroit News, Ruling Clouds Pot Smoking, Driving Law,\nJuly 29, 2010 (indicating that the majority’s recent overruling of Derror in Feezel “has\npolice officers scratching their heads in confusion”; “The ruling mostly leaves law\nenforcement officers in a legal limbo, said Sgt. Christopher Hawkins, legislative liaison\nfor the state police.”). <http://www.detnews.com/article/20100729/METRO/7290387#\nixzz0v6dvSnGK> (accessed July 29, 2010).\n\n\n\n                                              55\n\fcompromise. In exchange for the payment of economic loss benefits from one’s own\n\ninsurance company (first-party benefits), the Legislature limited an injured person’s\n\nability to sue a negligent operator or owner of a motor vehicle for noneconomic losses\n\n(third-party benefits). Kreiner, 471 Mich at 114-115. As stated in Stephens v Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2175782\"><a href=\"/opinion/2175782/stephens-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541; 536 NW2d 755 (1995): “It was a specific purpose of the Legislature in\n\nenacting the Michigan no-fault act to partially abolish tort remedies for injuries sustained\n\nin motor vehicle accidents and to substitute for those remedies an entitlement to first-\n\nparty insurance benefits.”\n\n              At least two reasons are evident concerning why the Legislature\n       limited recovery for noneconomic loss, both of which relate to the\n       economic viability of the system. First, there was the problem of the\n       overcompensation of minor injuries. Second, there were the problems\n       incident to the excessive litigation of motor vehicle accident cases.\n       Regarding the second problem, if noneconomic losses were always to be a\n       matter subject to adjudication under the act, the goal of reducing motor\n       vehicle accident litigation would likely be illusory. The combination of the\n       costs of continuing litigation and continuing overcompensation for minor\n       injuries could easily threaten the economic viability, or at least desirability,\n       of providing so many benefits without regard to fault. If every case is\n       subject to the potential of litigation on the question of noneconomic loss,\n       for which recovery is still predicated on negligence, perhaps little has been\n       gained by granting benefits for economic loss without regard to fault.\n\n            Regarding the trade-off involved in no-fault acts, 7 Am Jur 2d,\n       Automobile Insurance, § 340, p 1068, contains the following:\n\n              “It has been said of one such plan that the practical effect of the\n       adoption of personal injury protection insurance is to afford the citizen the\n       security of prompt and certain recovery to a fixed amount of the most\n       salient elements of his out-of-pocket expenses * * *. In return for this\n       he surrenders the possibly minimal damages for pain and suffering\n       recoverable in cases not marked by serious economic loss or objective\n       indicia of grave injury, and also surrenders the outside chance that through\n       a generous settlement or a liberal award by a judge or jury in such a case he\n\n\n\n                                             56\n\f       may be able to reap a monetary windfall out of his misfortune.” (Footnotes\n       omitted.)\n\n       Thus, it is apparent that the threshold requirements for a traditional tort\n       action for noneconomic loss play an important role in the functioning of the\n       no-fault act. [Cassidy, 415 Mich at 500-501.]\n\nAccordingly, there is no question that the legislative compromise that produced the no-\n\nfault act recognized that some injuries would not be considered sufficient to meet the no-\n\nfault threshold. While every injury resulting from a motor vehicle accident certainly has\n\nadverse consequences, and may involve medical costs, treatment, and bodily pain, not all\n\ninjuries rise to the level of the no-fault threshold of a “serious impairment of a body\n\nfunction.” Some injured persons are able to recover noneconomic damages, so that all\n\ninjured persons are able to recover economic loss benefits regardless of fault. Otherwise,\n\n“little has been gained by granting benefits for economic loss without regard to fault.”\n\nId. at 500. Indeed, “the excessive litigation of motor vehicle accident cases” would\n\ncontinue, and, yet, economic loss benefits would have to be paid regardless of fault. Id.\n\nIn other words, plaintiffs would be able to recover economic loss benefits regardless of\n\nfault and without having to go to a jury, while these same plaintiffs would also be able to\n\ngo to a jury and seek noneconomic benefits as well. That is not the compromise reached\n\nby the Legislature. In particular, it is a lose-lose proposition for those funding the no-\n\nfault system, i.e., all insured Michigan drivers.51\n\n\n       51\n         The majority argues that the legislative compromise of 1973 which led to the\nadoption of the no-fault act itself cannot be cited to trump the 1995 enactment of MCL\n500.3135(7). We agree, but it is our position that the 1995 enactment of MCL\n500.3135(7), which in large measure rejected DiFranco, and made it more difficult for\n\n\n                                              57\n\f       In addition, it has been repeatedly recognized that, due to the mandatory nature of\n\nno-fault insurance, the Legislature intended that its cost be affordable. Shavers, 402\n\nMich at 599 (“The Legislature has . . . fostered the expectation that no-fault insurance\n\nwill be available at fair and equitable rates.”).52 Indeed, because it is mandatory, it must\n\nbe affordable.    Id. at 600 (“We therefore conclude that Michigan motorists are\n\nconstitutionally entitled to have no-fault insurance made available on a fair and equitable\n\nbasis.”). It is a matter of economic logic that in order to maintain a system in which\n\nmotor vehicle accident victims are able to receive economic loss benefits regardless of\n\nfault, drivers must be required to purchase insurance, and in order to ensure that drivers\n\npurchase this insurance, it must be kept affordable. The majority’s decision, however,\n\nvery considerably “lowers the bar” that an injured plaintiff must satisfy in order to meet\n\nthe serious impairment of body function threshold, making it significantly easier for a\n\n\nplaintiffs to prevail in noneconomic loss benefit cases, is entirely consistent with the\ncompromise. The majority’s opinion is not in accord with either the compromise or\nMCL 500.3135(7).\n       52\n         See, e.g., Tebo v Havlik, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1997891\"><a href=\"/opinion/1997891/tebo-v-havlik/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366; 343 NW2d 181 (1984) (opinion by\nBRICKLEY, J.)

MCL 500.3101(1).\n\nThe Legislature has provided two incentives to ensure that owners purchase the required\n\ninsurance. First, it is a misdemeanor to drive a motor vehicle without basic no-fault\n\ncoverage. Under MCL 500.3102(2), if someone is convicted of driving without basic no-\n\nfault insurance coverage, he or she can be fined up to $500, incarcerated in jail for up to\n\none year, or both.    Second, the no-fault act precludes receipt of no-fault personal\n\nprotection benefits if at the time of the accident the person was the owner or registrant of\n\nan uninsured motor vehicle involved in the accident.                  MCL 500.3113(b).\n\nNotwithstanding this criminal sanction, and this potential preclusion of no-fault benefits,\n\nit is estimated that 17 percent56 of Michigan’s approximately eight million motor\n\nvehicles57 are still operated without a no-fault policy in effect. With such mandatory\n\n\nanalysis of the no-fault statute, the financial consequences of the majority’s decision\nshould not go unremarked.\n       56\n           According to the Insurance Institute of Michigan’s 2009 Fact Book, the\nInsurance Research Council (IRC) released a study in 2008 estimating Michigan’s\nuninsured motorists rate at 17 percent. <http://www.iiminfo.org/Portals/44/Fact%\n20Book%204%20Auto%20(19-29).pdf> (accessed June 28, 2010). Indeed, according to\na July 11, 2010 editorial in the Detroit News, “Statistics suggest more than half the\ndrivers in Detroit ignore state law by driving without coverage because they can’t afford\nthe premiums.

Yet, under the majority’s opinion, more lawsuits will make their way to\n\njuries for the consideration of noneconomic loss benefits, straining our already\n\noverburdened courts.58 As it is, no-fault automobile negligence cases remain a dominant\n\n\n       58\n          If one reviews the new majority’s decisions, it is difficult not to conclude that\nthe only coherent theme of their jurisprudence is the fostering of litigation. They have\nvirtually guaranteed as much by introducing uncertainty, doubt and confusion into the\nlaw, and by gratuitously interjecting irrelevant considerations into their opinions.

Indeed, of the 47,300 new civil case filings in\n\nMichigan circuit courts in 2009, 9,067-- approximately 20 percent of all civil cases--\n\nwere automobile related.59 Given that many no-fault claims are settled without the filing\n\nof a lawsuit, the number of claims potentially affected by the majority’s ruling is even\n\nhigher.\n\n       The majority’s decision will also increase costs incurred by the state of Michigan\n\nitself (and, of course, the taxpayers who fund those costs). In the course of arguing that\n\nKreiner should not be overruled because it “clarifies rather than expands the statutory\n\nlanguage,” the Attorney General’s amicus brief warns that if Kreiner is overruled, as a\n\n\n\n\nplaintiff has “standing” to bring a lawsuit); Univ of Mich v Titan Ins Co, __ Mich __; __\nNW2d __ (2010) (eroding the no-fault act’s one-year-back rule); O’Neal, supra\n(concluding that whichever lost-opportunity formula benefits the plaintiff the most in any\nparticular case is the correct formula to be utilized); Vanslembrouck v Halperin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 763 NW2d 919 (2009) (incorrectly characterizing MCL 600.5851(7) as a\nstatute of limitations that can be tolled rather than a savings provision that cannot be\ntolled); Sazima v Shepherd Bar & Restaurant, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 762 NW2d 924 (2009)\n(expanding what injuries can be considered to have occurred “in the course of\nemployment” for purposes of worker’s compensation); and the 2010 amendments of\nMCR 2.112 and MCR 2.118 (undermining affidavit of merit requirements). In the instant\ncase, of course, the majority, by undermining the no-fault compromise struck by the\nLegislature, makes it easier for plaintiffs to sue for noneconomic loss benefits.\n       59\n          See 2009 Annual Report of the Michigan Supreme Court, pps 35-36.\n<http://www.courts.michigan.gov/scao/resources/publications/statistics/2009/2009execsu\nm.pdf> (accessed June 28, 2010).\n\n\n\n                                            62\n\fself-insured entity, the state will realize “a direct, significant increase in the cost of its\n\nlitigation and coverage obligations.”60\n\n       Finally, and as a consequence of all of the above, the majority’s decision will\n\nalmost certainly call into question the long-term economic integrity of the present no-\n\nfault system in Michigan. By nullifying the legislative compromise that was struck when\n\nthe no-fault act was adopted-- a compromise grounded in concerns over excessive\n\nlitigation, the over-compensation of minor injuries, and the availability of affordable\n\ninsurance-- the Court’s decision today will restore a legal environment in which each of\n\nthese hazards reappear and threaten the continued fiscal soundness of our no-fault\n\nsystem.61\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       The no-fault automobile insurance act, MCL 500.3135(1), provides that “[a]\n\nperson remains subject to tort liability for noneconomic loss caused by his or her\n\nownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle only if the injured person has suffered\n\ndeath, serious impairment of body function, or permanent serious disfigurement.” The\n\nissue here is whether plaintiff has suffered a serious impairment of body function.\n\n\n       60\n          It was reported that, as of 2007, the state vehicle fleet totaled 11,856.\n<http://www.greatlakeswiki.org/index.php/Michigan_state_fleet_efficiency> (accessed\nJune 28, 2010).\n       61\n          I reiterate that expected increases in no-fault premiums are not pertinent to our\nanalysis of the legal issues in this case, beyond making the point that the majority is\nundoing the legislative compromise embodied by the no-fault act and that there will be\nsignificant practical consequences to doing this.\n\n\n\n                                             63\n\f“‘[S]erious impairment of body function’ means an objectively manifested impairment of\n\nan important body function that affects the person’s general ability to lead his or her\n\nnormal life.” MCL 500.3135(7).\n\n       In Kreiner, 471 Mich at 132-133, this Court held that in determining whether the\n\nimpairment affects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life, “a court should\n\nengage in a multifaceted inquiry, comparing the plaintiff’s life before and after the\n\naccident as well as the significance of any affected aspects on the course of the plaintiff’s\n\noverall life.” In addition, Kreiner indicated that certain factors, such as the duration of\n\nthe impairment, may be of assistance in evaluating whether the plaintiff’s general ability\n\nto lead his normal life has been affected. Id. at 133.\n\n       The majority overrules Kreiner, rejecting these factors and holding that temporal\n\nconsiderations are wholly or largely irrelevant in determining whether an impairment\n\naffects the plaintiff’s general ability to lead his or her normal life.        The majority\n\napparently holds instead that as long as a plaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life\n\nhas been affected for even a single moment in time, the plaintiff has suffered a serious\n\nimpairment of body function. This conclusion is at odds with the actual language of the\n\nstatute and nullifies the legislative compromise embodied in the no-fault act. Because I\n\nbelieve that Kreiner was correctly decided and that temporal considerations are, in fact,\n\nhighly relevant, and indeed necessary, in determining whether an impairment affects the\n\nplaintiff’s general ability to lead his normal life, I would sustain Kreiner. By nullifying\n\nthe legislative compromise over the no-fault act-- a compromise grounded in concerns\n\nover excessive litigation, the over-compensation of minor injuries, and the availability of\n\n\n                                             64\n\faffordable insurance-- the Court’s decision today will revive a legal environment in\n\nwhich each of these hazards reappear and threaten the continued fiscal integrity of our\n\nno-fault system.\n\n      Because I do not believe that the lower courts erred in concluding that plaintiff has\n\nnot suffered a serious impairment of body function, I would affirm the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals.\n\n\n      CORRIGAN and YOUNG, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                           65\n\f</pre>",
