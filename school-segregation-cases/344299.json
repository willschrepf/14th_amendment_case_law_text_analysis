GARZA, DeMOSS and PARKER, Circuit Judges.\n\n     REYNALDO G. GARZA, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Organizations representing different members of the Houston\n\nPolice Department sought to intervene in a consent decree entered\n\ninto by the City of Houston and a class of black and hispanic\n\npolice officers.   The district court denied intervention in the\n\nunderlying case and also intervention for purposes of appeal.   The\n\norganizations appeal the denial of these motions and also claim\n\nthat consent decree violates Title VII and the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n     We find that the district court appropriately denied the\n\nmotions to intervene in the underlying case;      accordingly, we\n\nDISMISS those appeals.   We find, however, that the district court\n\nerred in denying the motions to intervene for purposes of appeal.\n\nTherefore, we REVERSE the district court in this matter.   Finally,\n\nwe find that the consent decree survives scrutiny under Title VII\n\nand the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, we AFFIRM the district court's approval of the consent\n\ndecree.\n\n                           I. BACKGROUND\n\n     The original Complaint in this action was filed on August 19,\n\n1992, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n2000e et seq., as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.   The plaintiffs in this\n\naction filed timely charges of racial discrimination with the EEOC,\n\n                                 2\n\falleging that the City of Houston's promotional examinations for\n\nthe   ranks   of    Sergeant   and    Lieutenant   in    the    Houston   Police\n\nDepartment discriminated against African-Americans and Hispanic-\n\nAmericans between August 29, 1991 and March 26, 1992.1               Efforts to\n\nobtain redress for the Police Department's allegedly discriminatory\n\ntests began in 1975 and 1976, when Kelley v. Hofheinz, C.A. No H-\n\n75-1536, and Comeaux v. City of Houston, C.A. No. 76-H-1754, were\n\nfiled.\n\n      Among other claims, the Kelley and Comeaux cases raised the\n\nclaim that the promotional examinations of the Houston Police\n\nDepartment discriminated against African-American police officers\n\nbased on their race in violation of Title VII.               These challenges to\n\nthe promotional tests were based upon 1975 and 1976 EEOC charges of\n\nracial discrimination in the promotional tests.                   In 1979, the\n\nComeaux action was consolidated into Kelley.             In 1983, there were\n\nunsuccessful settlement discussions between the Kelley plaintiffs\n\nand the City of Houston.\n\n      On April 16, 1992, the City of Houston refused to consent to\n\nthe intervention in Kelley of the Afro-American Police Officers\n\nLeague,   the      Houston   Police   Organization      of    Spanish   Speaking\n\nOfficers, and a group of African-American and Hispanic-American\n\npolice officers.        On April 17, 1992 the above groups moved for\n\n      1\n      The entry-level uniformed position within the Houston\nPolice Department is Police Officer. The first promotional\nposition is currently the rank of Sergeant. Police Officers with\ntwo years of service as Police Officers are allowed to compete\nfor the rank of Sergeant. The second promotional position is the\nrank of Lieutenant. Sergeants with two years of service as\nSergeants are allowed to compete for the rank of Lieutenant.\n\n                                        3\n\fleave to intervene in Kelley, alleging that they had been harmed by\n\nracially discriminatory promotional examinations for the ranks of\n\nSergeant and Lieutenant in the Houston Police Department, that the\n\ndisposition of Kelley could impair their interests, and that in\n\nlight of the passage of time, their interests were not being\n\nrepresented effectively in Kelley.           On the same day, the City of\n\nHouston moved to dismiss Kelley for want of prosecution.\n\n     A hearing was held on June 15, 1992, on the City of Houston's\n\nmotion to dismiss Kelley, and on the motion for leave to intervene.\n\nThe district court dismissed all claims in Kelley for want of\n\nprosecution except for test-promotion related claims after January\n\n1, 1982, the district court also denied the application for leave\n\nto intervene, ordered the applicants for intervention to file a new\n\nlawsuit to be transferred to the same court, directed that the\n\nremainder of Kelley be consolidated into the new lawsuit, and\n\nordered   that    the   new   plaintiff     class   consist   of   blacks    and\n\nhispanics.     This case was timely filed on August 19, 1992, after\n\nreceipt of Notices of Right to Sue issued by the Attorney General\n\nof the U.S.      The remnant of the Kelley case was then consolidated\n\ninto this action.\n\n     The plaintiffs in this action alleged that the challenged\n\nexaminations      had   the   effect   of    disproportionately     excluding\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanic-Americans from promotion to Sergeant\n\nfrom 1982 to date, and of disproportionately excluding African-\n\nAmericans from promotion to Lieutenant from 1982 to date.                   They\n\nfurther alleged that the examinations were not job-related or\n\n\n                                       4\n\fconsistent with business necessity.       The plaintiffs sued on their\n\nown behalf, on behalf of the African-American and Hispanic-American\n\nmembers of the Police Department who took a Sergeant examination\n\nfrom 1982 to date or who will compete for promotions to Sergeant in\n\nthe future.\n\n     Settlement    negotiations   began     in   earnest    between   the\n\nplaintiffs and defendant City of Houston in the fall of 1992.         The\n\nsettlement negotiations resulted in a proposed Consent Decree which\n\nwas submitted to the district court in final form on January 21,\n\n1993.    On February 3, 1993, the district court ordered that notice\n\nbe given to all current and former Class A Peace Officers of the\n\nCity of Houston whose rights and interests were affected by the\n\nConsent Decree tentatively approved by it on that date. The notice\n\nstated that a free copy of the Consent Decree could be acquired\n\nfrom the Legal Services Division of the Houston Police Department.\n\nThe notice also stated that March 12, 1993 was the deadline for\n\nfiling objections, and that a fairness hearing was scheduled for\n\nMarch 24, 1993.\n\n     Before the fairness hearing was conducted, representatives of\n\nthe following groups moved to intervene in the main case:         Houston\n\nPolice Patrolmen's Union2 (\"HPPU\");   the original named plaintiffs\n\nin the Comeaux action (McLoy Medlock, et al.);             Houston Police\n\n     2\n      The HPPU appellants are comprised of 109 individual Class A\nPeace Officers who held the position of police officer on\nFebruary 3, 1993, and 22 individual Class A Peace Officers who\nheld the position of Sergeant on that date. The HPPU appellants\nsought to intervene as class representatives of all similarly\nsituated Class A Peace Officers holding the rank of police\nofficer, Sergeant, or Lieutenant.\n\n                                  5\n\fOfficers Association3;          Female Police Officers;                  Asian Police\n\nOfficers;    and Houston Parks Police Officers.\n\n      On   March    17,     1993,    the    district       court   signed   an     order\n\ninforming    the     parties        that    a    hearing      on   the   motions     for\n\nintervention was scheduled for March 22, 1993. At the hearing, the\n\nHouston Airport Police Officers Association4 made an oral motion to\n\nintervene.      It later filed a written motion on March 23, 1993.\n\nAfter the hearing, the district court denied all of the motions for\n\nintervention, including the Airport Police Officers oral motion.\n\n      On March 24, 1993, the district court held the fairness\n\nhearing.    At the fairness hearing, the applicants for intervention\n\nwere allowed to:            (1) cross-examine witnesses, including the\n\nplaintiffs' statistical experts and the Chief of Police;                             (2)\n\nproffer evidence;         and (3) raise any objections to the Consent\n\nDecree.      The    district        court       again   denied     the   motions     for\n\nintervention, but allowed the applicants for intervention to file\n\nmotions to intervene for purposes of appeal.\n\n      On March 25, 1993, the district court certified the following\n\nclass:\n\n      a. All African-Americans who are employed, or at any time\n\nsince January 1, 1982 were employed, as Class A peace officers by\n\nthe   Houston      Police     Department         and    who   took   a    promotional\n\n      3\n      Doug Elder and Mark Clark, individually and as\nrepresentatives of the Houston Police Officers Association, and\nall Class A Police Officers, holding the rank of Police Officer\nand Sergeant of Police.\n      4\n      Terry Hughes, present and former Airport Police and Airport\nPolice Officers Association.\n\n                                            6\n\fexamination for the rank of Lieutenant or for the rank of Sergeant\n\nwhich was administered at any time from January 1, 1982 to the\n\npresent, and those who will compete for such promotions in the\n\nfuture;   and\n\n      b. All Hispanic-Americans who are employed, or at any time\n\nsince January 1, 1982 were employed, as Class A peace officers by\n\nthe   Houston   Police   Department    and   who   took    a   promotional\n\nexamination for the rank of Sergeant which was administered at any\n\ntime from January 1, 1982 to the present, and those who will\n\ncompete for such promotions in the future.\n\n      On March 25, 1993, the district court made one modification to\n\nthe Consent Decree and made the Consent Decree a final judgment.5\n\nUnder the terms of the Consent Decree, African-Americans and\n\nHispanic-Americans   who   took   an   examination   for   Sergeant   from\n\nJanuary 1, 1982 to date, and who passed at least one examination\n\nfor this rank, will receive a total of 96 remedial promotions;\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanic-Americans who took an examination\n\nfor Sergeant from January 1, 1982 to date, and who were promoted\n\nafter a discriminatorily long waiting period which delayed their\n\nability to compete for Lieutenant promotions will receive five\n\nremedial promotions to Lieutenant;      and African-Americans who took\n\n\n      5\n      The district court added the following sentence after the\nfirst sentence of paragraph 34.\n\n           A person who receives a remedial promotion will receive\n           compensatory retroactive seniority only back to the\n           date six months after the earliest test that person\n           took for the position, even if the promotion arises\n           from a disparity in an earlier test.\n\n                                   7\n\fan examination for Lieutenant from January 1, 1982 to date, and\n\npassed at least one examination for this rank will receive a total\n\nof five remedial promotions.        The named plaintiffs in this lawsuit\n\nwho meet   the      necessary   conditions      shall    have   priority.     The\n\nremedial promotions will be made over a five-year period.                     The\n\ndistrict court saw this as a concession of great magnitude by the\n\nplaintiffs.    The Consent Decree does not provide for any back pay.\n\n      The Consent Decree seeks, during the next ten years, to reduce\n\nthe   amount   of     adverse   impact       against    African-Americans     and\n\nHispanic-Americans taking exams for Sergeant and Lieutenant:                  (a)\n\nby striking \"racially biased items\"; and (b) by extending the life\n\nof promotional registers during this period of time to two years.\n\n      The Consent Decree supersedes some provisions of the Fire and\n\nPolice Civil Service Act and the Texas Local Government Code\n\nchapter 143, as amended.         Paragraph 55 provides a mechanism for\n\nstriking from the test those items which the City identifies as\n\nbiased items and which are not job-related.                     Paragraph 55(g)\n\nprovides that the promotional registers of test passers remain in\n\neffect for two years rather than one.           Finally, the need to perform\n\nstatistical analysis of responses and to examine test items for\n\nbias necessitates a short postponement of release of the test\n\nresults.   Paragraph 55(f) requires that an eligibility list for\n\npromotions be posted as soon as possible.\n\n      On May 20, 1993 the district court denied motions to intervene\n\nfor purposes of appeal by the following groups:                  Houston Police\n\nPatrolman's    Union    (\"HPPU\");     Houston      Airport      Police   Officers\n\n\n                                         8\n\fAssociation;   Female Police Officers;    Houston Police Officers\n\nAssociation;   and the original named plaintiffs in the Comeaux\n\naction (McLoy Medlock, et al.).\n\n     The HPPU appellants and the Houston Airport Police Officers\n\nAssociation appeal the district court's denial of their motions to\n\nintervene in the underlying case. The HPPU appellants, the Houston\n\nAirport Police Officers Association, the Houston Police Officers\n\nAssociation, and the original named plaintiffs in the Comeaux\n\naction appeal the district court's denial of their motions to\n\nintervene for purposes of appeal.     The HPPU appellants and the\n\noriginal named plaintiffs in the Comeaux action also appeal the\n\ndistrict court's approval of the Consent Decree.      Finally, the\n\nHouston Airport Police Officers Association appeals the district\n\ncourt's approval of paragraph 61 of the Consent Decree, entitled\n\n\"Reclassification of Peace Officers.\"6\n\n                         II. DISCUSSION\n\n1. Did the district court improperly deny the appellants' motions\n     to intervene in the underlying case?\n\n     The HPPU appellants and the Houston Airport Police Officers\n\nAssociation appeal the district court's denial of their motions to\n\nintervene in the underlying case.     They claim that the district\n\ncourt improperly denied their motions to intervene.   They claimed\n\nthe right to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      The Houston Parks Police Officers filed an amicus brief in\nsupport of the Airport Police Officers position.\n\n                                  9\n\f24(a)7 in part based upon the Civil Rights Act of 1991 provision\n\nwhich prohibits subsequent attacks on a Consent Decree entered in\n\na Title VII proceeding, through separate litigation unless the\n\nobjections and complaints are raised in the original proceeding.\n\n(42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n)(1)(B)).        They allege that by refusing to\n\npermit intervention, the district court substantially limited their\n\nability to challenge the Consent Decree.      They claim that they met\n\nall the requirements for intervention of right.\n\n     The HPPU appellants assert that the principal ground relied\n\nupon by the district court for denying their motion was timeliness.\n\nThey claim that their motion for intervention meets this court's\n\ntest for timeliness set out in Corley v. Jackson Police Dept., 755\n\nF.2d 1207, 1209 (5th Cir.1985) (citing Stallworth v. Monsanto Co.,\n\n558 F.2d 257, 263 (5th Cir.1977)).      They first argue that they met\n\nthe district court's deadline by filing their motion on March 12,\n\n1993.    They further argue that their motion was filed just 37 days\n\nafter the district court published notice of the terms of the\n\nConsent Decree and less than six months after the City of Houston\n\nfiled its answer denying all of the plaintiff's allegations.      They\n\nalso argue that although rumors of a proposed consent decree began\n\n\n     7\n      Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to\nintervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States\nconfers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the\napplicant claims an interest relating to the property or\ntransaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant\nis so situated that the disposition of the action may as a\npractical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to\nprotect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is\nadequately represented by existing parties. Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 24(a).\n\n                                  10\n\fto circulate in late December 1992, they were not able to obtain,\n\ndespite repeated efforts, any specific information regarding the\n\nConsent Decree until the February 3, 1993 notice was published.\n\nThey claim that it was the appellees' own conduct, in refusing to\n\ndisclose the terms of the decree sooner, that caused any delay.\n\nFinally, they argue that the appellees can hardly show prejudice\n\nfrom any delay, since the appellees were required to give notice of\n\nthe decree so that objections could be filed.\n\n     The Airport Police Officers Association (\"Airport Police\")\n\nalso claims that its application to intervene was timely.               The\n\nAirport Police argue that they sought to intervene within a few\n\nweeks after obtaining a copy of the proposed Consent Decree.            The\n\nAirport Police further argue that it is undisputed that they had no\n\npossible way of knowing prior to obtaining a copy of the proposed\n\nConsent Decree that it would contain a provision, such as paragraph\n\n61, singling them out and seemingly intended to deny them the very\n\ntransfer rights they won after lengthy litigation with the City of\n\nHouston.\n\n     The Airport Police also claim that they meet the test for\n\ntimeliness set out in Corley v. Jackson Police Dept., supra.            The\n\nAirport Police argue that the amount of time during which they\n\ncould have known of their interest in the case before seeking to\n\nintervene was minimal.      The Airport Police further argue that the\n\nappellees have not shown prejudice from any delay.            Finally, the\n\nAirport    Police   argue   that   their   prejudice   from    denial   of\n\nintervention is substantial.\n\n\n                                    11\n\f     The HPPU appellants and the Airport Police alternatively\n\nsought     permissive   intervention    under   Federal   Rule   of   Civil\n\nProcedure 24(b).\n\n         Denial of intervention of right is a question of law which we\n\nreview de novo.      Ceres Gulf v. Cooper, 957 F.2d 1199, 1202 (5th\n\nCir.1992). Denial of permissive intervention is reviewed for clear\n\nabuse of discretion.     Korioth v. Briscoe, 523 F.2d 1271, 1278 (5th\n\nCir.1975).\n\n     At the hearing on the applications for intervention in the\n\nunderlying case, the district judge stated that the appellants,\n\n\"were entitled to ask to intervene earlier.\"        He also stated that\n\nthe appellants could not have more time, and that he was \"not going\n\nto delay this [process].\"     Finally, the district judge stated, \"I\n\ndon't need an additional party's litigant at the last moment. Your\n\nclients have a copy—or had available to them a copy of the Police\n\nChief's December 16th memorandum8 on the potential settlement.\"\n\n     8\n\n\n     Circular\n     Houston Police Department\n\n     December 16, 1992                                    No. 92-1216-1\n\n\nSUBJECT:                  POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT\n\nThe Department has agreed in principle to settle a long standing\nlawsuit regarding our promotional system. The details of this\nsettlement are still being negotiated; however, I want to give\nas much correct information as I can now. A proposed version of\nthe agreement will be filed in Federal Court on Tuesday, December\n22, 1992. Shortly after that date, I should be able to give you\ndetailed information. The following aspects are being negotiated\nand are likely to become part of the final settlement.\n\n\n                                   12\n\fBased on these statements, we conclude that the district court\n\ndenied the applications for intervention in the underlying case on\n\nthe basis of untimeliness.\n\n     \"Whether leave to intervene is sought under section (a) or (b)\n\nof Rule 24, the application must be timely.\"        Stallworth v.\n\nMonsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 263 (5th Cir.1977).\n\n     \"Timeliness,\" ... is not a word of exactitude or of precisely\n     measurable dimensions. Rule 24 fails to define it, and the\n     Advisory Committee Note furnishes no clarification.      As a\n     result, the question of whether an application for\n     intervention is timely is largely committed to the discretion\n     of the district court, and its determination will not be\n     overturned on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.\n\n\n\n\n                        Settlement Summary\n\n1. A number, yet to be determined, of minority police officers\nand sergeants will be promoted to sergeant and lieutenant. The\npromotions will be based on the lists established during the\nyears 1982 through 1991.\n\n2. Remedial promotions will be completed over a four to five year\nperiod.\n\n3. A statistical analysis will be utilized on future promotional\nexams for sergeant and lieutenant to identify any racially biased\nquestions. The questions identified as such will be thrown out\nafter the tests.\n\n4. Current and future sergeant and lieutenant promotional lists\nwill remain in existence for two years.\n\n5. The procedures agreed on will be monitored by the Federal\nCourt for ten years.\n\n6. All Class A officers will receive official notification of the\nCourt's consent decree and will be an opportunity to address\ntheir concerns to the Court.\n\n\n\n                      Sam Nuchia\n                      Chief of Police\n\n                                13\n\fId. (citing NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 367, 93 S.Ct. 2591,\n\n2603-04, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973)).\n\n      In Stallworth, we developed four factors to be considered in\n\ndetermining whether a motion to intervene was timely:\n\n          Factor 1. The length of time during which the would-be\n     intervenor actually knew or reasonably should have known of\n     his interest in the case before he petitioned for leave to\n     intervene....\n\n          Factor 2. The extent of the prejudice that the existing\n     parties to the litigation may suffer as a result of the\n     would-be intervenor's failure to apply for intervention as\n     soon as he actually knew or reasonably should have known of\n     his interest in the case....\n\n          Factor 3. The extent of the prejudice that the would-be\n     intervenor may suffer if his petition for leave to intervene\n     is denied....\n\n          Factor 4. The existence of unusual circumstances\n     militating either for or against a determination that the\n     application is timely....\n\nId. at 264-66.    \"Stallworth is not an algorithm, but a framework\n\nfor analysis.\"   Corley v. Jackson Police Dept., 755 F.2d 1207, 1209\n\n(5th Cir.1985) (quoting Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 710 F.2d 1040, 1043 (5th\n\nCir.1983)).\n\n      As the appellees point out, Chief of Police Nuchia met with\n\nthe presidents of the Houston Police Officers Association and the\n\nHouston Police Patrolmans Union on November 4, 1992.              At these\n\nmeetings, Chief of Police Nuchia informed the representatives of\n\nthose two groups that the City of Houston was undergoing settlement\n\ndiscussions with the plaintiffs.         Moreover, on December 16, 1992,\n\nChief of Police Nuchia issued a departmental circular to all police\n\nofficers   informing   them   of   the   potential   settlement   in   this\n\nlawsuit.\n\n                                    14\n\f        Factor 1.   The appellants erroneously contend that we should\n\nconsider February 3, 1993, the date the district court sent out\n\nformal notice, as the date from which to consider timeliness.         As\n\nStallworth makes clear, timeliness is measured from the point in\n\ntime at which the applicant for intervention actually knew or\n\nreasonably should have known of his interest in this case.         Based\n\non the fact that Chief of Police Nuchia notified the appellants not\n\nonly personally, but through the form of a departmental circular,\n\nthere is no question that the appellants actually knew or should\n\nhave known of their interest in this case in November or December\n\nof 1992.   Therefore, the appellants waited three and a half to four\n\nand a half months before applying for intervention.             Standing\n\nalone, this would probably not merit a finding of untimeliness,\n\nhowever, it certainly does not bode in the appellants' favor.\n\n     Factor 2.      The second factor relates to the prejudice to the\n\nexisting parties if the appellants' intervention is allowed.          In\n\nthis case, what is of particular importance is not so much the\n\nlength of the appellants' delay in filing for intervention, as what\n\noccurred during the period of that delay.        During this period of\n\ndelay, the proposed Consent Decree was put into final conceptual\n\nform.   The interests of the City of Houston, of both groups in the\n\nplaintiff class, and of other employees were considered and meshed\n\nto the greatest extent possible; the number of remedial promotions\n\nwas negotiated;       and the seniority complications caused by the\n\nplaintiffs'    concessions     to   the   City   of   Houston   and   to\n\nnon-class-members in stretching out the remedial promotions over\n\n\n                                    15\n\ffive years were worked out.            Therefore, as in Corley v. Jackson\n\nPolice Dept., 755 F.2d 1207, 1210 (5th Cir.1985), the prejudice is\n\napparent.       \"A negotiated settlement of a difficult problem is put\n\nat risk, to the disadvantage of the named parties, the class, the\n\npolice department and the City.\"              Id.\n\n      Factor     3.    The    third    factor   contemplates         the    extent   of\n\nprejudice the applicant for intervention would suffer if his motion\n\nfor intervention is denied.           In this case, there is no prejudice to\n\nthe appellants.        At the fairness hearing, the appellants were\n\nallowed    to    present     testimony    and       argument    on   their     written\n\nobjections to the Consent Decree. The appellants were also allowed\n\nto   cross-examine     Chief    of    Police    Nuchia     and    the      plaintiffs'\n\nstatistical experts.          The district court considered all of the\n\nappellants' objections to the Consent Decree.                  The district court,\n\nin the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, answered each of\n\nthe appellants' objections and stated why it was not persuaded by\n\ntheir arguments.       In essence, the appellants were treated as if\n\nthey were parties to the lawsuit.                    Thus, the appellants have\n\nalready been afforded the substance of the benefits of intervention\n\nas to all their objections.           The appellants have had their day in\n\ncourt.\n\n      Factor 4.       There are no unusual circumstances militating\n\neither    for    or   against   a     determination      that    the       appellants'\n\napplications were timely.\n\n      From the perspective of the Stallworth analysis, we find that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the\n\n\n                                         16\n\fappellants' applications for intervention.   Therefore, the appeals\n\non the denial of intervention in the underlying case are dismissed.\n\n2.   Did the district court err in denying the appellants'\n      applications to intervene for purposes of appeal?\n\n      All of the appellants claim that the district court erred in\n\ndenying their motions to intervene for purposes of appeal.       The\n\nappellants claim that they meet all of requirements to intervene as\n\nof right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a).    They\n\nclaim that this court established four requirements which must be\n\nmet to demonstrate a right to intervene:     (1) the application to\n\nintervene must be timely;   (2) the applicant must have an interest\n\nrelating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the\n\naction;   (3) the applicant must be so situated that disposition of\n\nthe action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede, his\n\nability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicant's interest\n\nmust be inadequately represented by existing parties.   New Orleans\n\nPublic Service v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 732 F.2d 452, 463 (5th\n\nCir.) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom., Morial v. United Gas Pipe\n\nLine Co., 469 U.S. 1019, 105 S.Ct. 434, 83 L.Ed.2d 360 (1984).\n\n     The appellants all claim that their motions to intervene for\n\npurposes of appeal were timely filed.        They argue that their\n\nmotions were filed by the district court's April 19, 1993 deadline.\n\n     The HPPU appellants also claim that the district court, by\n\nrefusing to permit intervention, substantially limited the HPPU\n\nappellants' ability to challenge the Consent Decree.     They argue\n\nthat because the terms of the Consent Decree authorize the City of\n\nHouston to continue to impermissibly discriminate against them, and\n\n                                 17\n\fbecause the Consent Decree will remain in effect for ten years\n\nunder the district court's jurisdiction, the district court's\n\nrefusal to allow intervention has effectively denied them their\n\nright to participate in this and future proceedings affecting their\n\npromotional opportunities.\n\n     The Airport Police argue, with regard to the second factor of\n\nthe New Orleans Public Service test, that if the City of Houston\n\ncomplies with paragraph 61 of the Consent Decree, they will be\n\nconfined to the airport and will be unable to transfer elsewhere in\n\nthe City for the next ten years of their careers.      The Airport\n\nPolice argue that their career paths and promotional opportunities\n\nwill be sharply curtailed. The Airport Police conclude, therefore,\n\nthat their interest in this transaction is \"legally protectable.\"\n\n     The Airport Police further argue that if the City complies\n\nwith paragraph 61, the City will violate the state court decree\n\nwhich directs the City to afford each Airport Officer the same\n\ntransfer rights as are afforded to Officers of corresponding rank\n\nin the Patrol Divisions of the Houston Police Department.\n\n     The original plaintiffs in the Comeaux action argue, in\n\nreference to the third factor, that the Consent Decree impairs or\n\nimpedes their ability to protect their interests.   They argue that\n\ntheir claims for years prior to 1982 were literally wiped out.\n\nThey concede that these claims were dismissed in 1992.      However,\n\nthey claim that this was in error and that they should have been\n\nafforded relief in the Consent Decree.   With regard to the fourth\n\nfactor, they claim that the plaintiffs had a clear interest in\n\n\n                                18\n\fdismissing the pre-1982 claims, and that the City had an interest\n\nin dismissing those claims to avoid complying with any benefits or\n\nback pay awards.\n\n       The Houston Police Officers Association argues with regard to\n\nthe fourth factor, that their interests in the underlying case were\n\nnot the same and to a large extent, diametrically opposite from\n\nthose    of     the   plaintiffs      and       defendant   City       of     Houston.\n\nSpecifically, the Consent Decree was the end result of settlement\n\nnegotiations       between    the   plaintiffs     and   the    City       only.    The\n\ninterests of the Houston Police Officers Association was in no way\n\nfactored into the settlement agreement.               The Association further\n\nargues that the remedial promotions will cause persons with lower\n\nscores to be promoted over individuals who performed better on the\n\npromotional exams.\n\n       All    of   the    appellants       alternatively       sought       permissive\n\nintervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b).                           The\n\nappellants argue that since their claims all arose out of the\n\nproposed Consent Decree, there were common questions of law and\n\nfact.\n\n       As stated earlier, denial of intervention of right is a\n\nquestion of law which we review de novo.             Ceres Gulf v. Cooper, 957\n\nF.2d    at    1202.      In   order   to    determine    whether       a    party   has\n\ndemonstrated a right to intervene, we examine the four requirements\n\nset out in New Orleans Public Service, 732 F.2d at 463.\n\n       First, all of the appellants' motions to intervene were timely\n\nfiled.       The appellants filed their motions before the district\n\n\n                                           19\n\fcourt's deadline on filing the motions to intervene for purposes of\n\nappeal.\n\n        With regard to the second requirement, the critical question\n\nis what type of interest the appellants have in the promotional\n\nsystem.    To demonstrate an interest in the transaction sufficient\n\nto support intervention as of right, an applicant \"must demonstrate\n\na \"direct, substantial and legally protectable' interest in the\n\nproperty or transaction that is the subject of the suit.\"                 League\n\nof United Latin American Citizens v. Clements, 884 F.2d 185, 187\n\n(5th Cir.1989) (quoting New Orleans Public Service, 732 F.2d at\n\n463).     The   appellants'    interest      is   in    making   sure   that   the\n\npromotional system is not manipulated in such a manner, that it\n\ndiscriminates against them. This interest is sufficient to support\n\nintervention as of right.\n\n     To meet the third requirement, the applicant must be so\n\nsituated that disposition of the action may, as a practical matter,\n\nimpair or impede, his ability to protect that interest.                        New\n\nOrleans Public Service, 732 F.2d at 463.               Although, the appellants\n\nwere treated as if they were parties in the underlying action, the\n\ndistrict court     did   not   allow   the    appellants      to   benefit     from\n\nappellate review of the Consent Decree.            The appellants were able\n\nto protect their interests below because they were able to bring\n\nforth all of their objections and arguments.               However, part of the\n\nability to protect their interests is the ability to subjugate the\n\ndistrict court's disposition of their case to appellate scrutiny.\n\nWe stated earlier that the appellants have had their day in court.\n\n\n                                       20\n\fConcomitant with having one's day in court is appellate review of\n\nthat day.\n\n     The fourth requirement inquires whether the applicant for\n\nintervention's      interest   is   adequately    represented      by   existing\n\nparties.    Id.    The appellants' interests were adequately protected\n\nin the district court because they were given the opportunity to\n\nrepresent their own interests.          However, when the district court\n\ndenied their applications for intervention for purposes of appeal,\n\nnone of the existing parties adequately represented the appellants'\n\ninterests.    This is evidenced by the fact that neither the City of\n\nHouston nor the plaintiffs sought appellate review of the Consent\n\nDecree.     Those two parties were content with their settlement,\n\nwhile the appellants obviously were not.\n\n     We find that the appellants meet all of the requirements to\n\nintervene as of right for purposes of appeal.                      Thus, it is\n\nunnecessary to determine whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying permissive intervention.\n\n     We, therefore, reverse the district court's denial of the\n\nappellants' motions to intervene for purposes of appeal.\n\n     Having found that the district court erred in this manner, we\n\nnow turn to the appellants' substantive arguments.\n\n3. Did the district court err in approving the Consent Decree?\n\n     The    HPPU   appellants   argue      that   this   circuit    requires   a\n\ndistrict court to become more involved in the settlement process\n\nwhen it is called upon to approve a Title VII consent decree.               They\n\nargue that the district court failed to review the terms of the\n\n\n                                      21\n\fConsent Decree and the evidence in support of it with sufficient\n\nscrutiny.    They also argue that the Eleventh Circuit has held that\n\nthe operative law for judging a consent decree is the same as that\n\nfor    voluntary   affirmative    acts.     In   re   Birmingham      Reverse\n\nDiscrimination Employment Litigation, 833 F.2d 1492, 1501 (11th\n\nCir.1987).   They further argue that the district court should have\n\nused a strict scrutiny standard because the Consent Decree on its\n\nface    provides   for   both    \"racial   quotas\"    and   future    racial\n\nclassifications.    See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S.\n\n469, 493, 109 S.Ct. 706, 721, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989).                Finally,\n\nthey argue that the district court's failure to take into account\n\nthe special deference allowed to police departments in determining\n\n\"job related\" testing, constituted an abuse of its discretion. See\n\nDavis v. City of Dallas, 777 F.2d 205, 211 (5th Cir.1985), cert.\n\ndenied, 476 U.S. 1116, 106 S.Ct. 1972, 90 L.Ed.2d 656 (1986).\n\n       The HPPU appellants also argue that in a case in which the\n\nFourteenth Amendment is properly invoked, race conscious relief may\n\nonly be employed to remedy identifiable past discrimination, and\n\nrelief may only be granted to the victims of that discrimination.\n\n       [F]or   the   governmental   interest  in   remedying    past\n       discrimination to be triggered \"judicial, legislative, or\n       administrative findings of constitutional or statutory\n       violations\" must be made. Only then does the government have\n       a compelling interest in favoring one race over another.\n\nRichmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. at 497, 109 S.Ct. at 723 (quoting\n\nCalifornia Regents v. Bakke 438 U.S. 265, 307, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2757,\n\n57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978)).     Furthermore, the governmental entity must\n\nhave a \"strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial\n\n\n                                     22\n\faction was necessary.\"           Id. at 500, 109 S.Ct. at 725 (quoting\n\nWygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 277, 106 S.Ct. 1842,\n\n1848-49, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986)).\n\n       The HPPU appellants' argue that the district court failed to\n\nrequire such a strong basis in the evidence.                The only evidence of\n\npast   discrimination       is   the    questionable       statistical    analysis\n\nperformed by plaintiffs' counsel. They also contend that there was\n\nno   attempt     by   the   district     court    to     determine   whether    the\n\npromotional exams measured performance of skills necessary for the\n\njobs of Sergeant and Lieutenant of police within the Houston Police\n\nDepartment.      They further contend that the City did not make any\n\nattempt to validate the contents of the exams.\n\n       The HPPU appellants argue that the law draws a distinction\n\nbetween relief that is intended to remedy the effect of past\n\ndiscrimination and relief which is designed to compensate an\n\nindividual who has been the specific victim of past discrimination.\n\nSee Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 578-\n\n79, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 2587-88, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1983).                  They contend\n\nthat in the instant case there was no evidence to support any\n\nfinding that any of the individuals who would be receiving the 106\n\nremedial promotions were the actual victims of any discrimination.\n\nThey   further    contend    that      the    Consent    Decree   establishes    an\n\nunconstitutional pool of positions available for the promotions of\n\nindividuals within the Houston Police Department based solely upon\n\ntheir race.      See generally Bakke;          Wygant;    Firefighters.\n\n       The HPPU appellants also contend that the Consent Decree fails\n\n\n                                         23\n\fto narrowly tailor the prospective relief provided to the disparity\n\nshown    and   unnecessarily   trammels   the   interests   of   non-Black,\n\nnon-Hispanic officers within the Police Department in a way that\n\nviolates the standards applicable to even non-public employers.\n\nSee United Steel Workers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 99\n\nS.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979).\n\n     The HPPU appellants further contend that the Consent Decree\n\nwas collusive and/or fraudulent and/or transparently invalid. They\n\nalso contend that the Consent Decree contains several provisions\n\nwhich violate Title VII.       For example, the Consent Decree divests\n\nthem of vested promotional and seniority rights under a valid merit\n\nbased promotional testing procedure.        Paragraph 55 of the Consent\n\nDecree    authorizes    the    Police    Department   to    adjust   future\n\npromotional test scores on the basis of race.         The Consent Decree\n\nfurther provides for readjustment to scores in the event the \"log\n\nlinear\" analysis results in failing an officer who otherwise passed\n\nthe exam.\n\n     Finally, the HPPU appellants argue that the district court's\n\nrefusal to allow them, and others, to present the testimony they\n\nhad prepared to demonstrate the questionable validity of the\n\nConsent Decree, deprived them of a fair and equal opportunity to\n\nprotect their rights under the law.        Thus, their equal protection\n\nand due process rights were impaired.\n\n     The Airport Police Officers claim that the district court\n\nerred in approving paragraph 61 of the Consent Decree.                 They\n\ncontend that the legitimate purposes of the Consent Decree are to\n\n\n                                    24\n\fcure the ethnic bias of the promotional exams and to improve the\n\nracial mix of the Sergeant and Lieutenant ranks of the Police\n\nDepartment.   Paragraph 61 purports to further these goals by\n\ntotally excluding them from even taking the tests. They argue that\n\nexcluding them from taking the tests will not make the tests less\n\nbiased. Likewise, their exclusion has no relationship to improving\n\nthe racial mix of the Sergeant and Lieutenant ranks.\n\n     The original Comeaux plaintiffs argue that the Consent Decree\n\nis woefully unjust, unfair, unreasonable and inadequate. Under the\n\nConsent Decree some of the class members do not receive relief,\n\nincluding monetary relief;    the relief for the appellee-plaintiffs\n\nis significantly greater than their relief;           and some members of\n\nthe certified class are treated differently than other class\n\nmembers.   They also argue that the wrongful dismissal of their\n\nclaims precluded them from being included in the negotiations\n\nleading to the Consent Decree.     They further argue that even where\n\nthere is a clear record of delay, the sanction of dismissal is\n\njustified only where a lesser sanction would not suffice.\n\n     Under the terms of the Consent Decree, African-Americans and\n\nHispanic-Americans   who   took   an    examination   for   Sergeant   from\n\nJanuary 1, 1982 to date, and who passed at least one examination\n\nfor this rank, will receive a total of 96 remedial promotions.\n\nSince African-Americans suffered 64.67 of the shortfall in Sergeant\n\npromotions, they will receive 64.67 of the remedial promotions to\n\nSergeant, for a total of 62 remedial promotions to Sergeant.\n\nHispanic-Americans suffered 35.47 of the shortfall in Sergeant\n\n\n                                   25\n\fpromotions,     hence,     they    will       receive   35.47    of     the    remedial\n\npromotions to Sergeant, for a total of 34 for remedial promotions\n\nto Sergeant.     African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans who took an\n\nexamination for Sergeant from January 1, 1982 to date, and who were\n\npromoted after a discriminatorily long waiting period which delayed\n\ntheir ability to compete for Lieutenant promotions will receive\n\nfive remedial promotions to Lieutenant.                  African-Americans will\n\nreceive three of those promotions and Hispanic-Americans will\n\nreceive two of those promotions.                 Finally, African-Americans who\n\ntook an examination for Lieutenant from January 1, 1982 to date,\n\nand who passed at least one examination for this rank will receive\n\na total of five remedial promotions.\n\n     The Consent Decree seeks, during the next ten years, to reduce\n\nthe amount of adverse impact against black and hispanic police\n\nofficers taking the promotional exams by:                     (a) striking items\n\nbiased against any race;                and (b) extending the life of the\n\npromotional registers during this period to two years.\n\n         The appellants attack the Consent Decree's validity under\n\nTitle VII      and   the   Equal       Protection    Clause     of    the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.      Although the obligations of a public employer under\n\nTitle    VII   are   similar      to    its     obligations     under    the    Federal\n\nConstitution, they are not the same.9               We, therefore, examine each\n\n     9\n         Justice Scalia's dissent maintains that the obligations of\n             a public employer under Title VII must be identical to\n             its obligations under the Constitution, and that a\n             public employer's adoption of an affirmative action\n             plan therefore should be governed by Wygant.... \"Title\n             VII, by contrast, was enacted pursuant to the commerce\n             power to regulate purely private decision making and\n\n                                           26\n\fof the appellants' arguments in turn.\n\n Validity under Title VII\n\n      \"In Title VII litigation, this Court had held that the\n\ndistrict court is entitled to a substantial measure of discretion\n\nin dealing with consent decrees, and that as a result \"on appeal,\n\nour duty is to ascertain whether or not the trial judge clearly\n\nabused his discretion....' \"   Williams v.

Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case\n     that race or sex has been taken into account in an employer's\n     employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer to\n     articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision.\n     The existence of an affirmative action plan provides such a\n     rationale. If such a plan is articulated as the basis for the\n     employer's decision, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to\n     prove that the employer's justification is pretextual and the\n     plan is invalid.     As a practical matter, of course, an\n     employer will generally seek to avoid a charge of pretext by\n\n\n          was not intended to incorporate and particularize the\n          commands of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\"\n          United Steelworkers of America v.

Thus, the appellants have made\n\ntheir prima facie case.          We now turn to the validity of the Consent\n\nDecree.\n\n      The Supreme Court in Johnson articulated a two-prong test for\n\ndetermining     whether     a    race-conscious        affirmative     action   plan\n\ncomports with Title VII.             \"The first issue ... is whether the\n\nconsideration of sex [or race]10 of applicants ... was justified by\n\nthe   existence       of    a      \"manifest       imbalance'     that     reflected\n\nunderrepresentation of women [or minorities] in \"traditionally\n\nsegregated job categories.' \"              Id. at 631, 107 S.Ct. at 1451-52\n\n(citing Weber, 443 U.S. at 197, 99 S.Ct. at 2724).                         \"We next\n\nconsider      whether      the      Agency      Plan     [race-conscious        plan]\n\nunnecessarily       trammeled      the   rights     of   male    [or   nonminority]\n\nemployees or created an absolute bar to their advancement.\" Id. at\n\n637-38, 107 S.Ct. at 1455.\n\n                                           A.\n\n      10\n      \"Because of the employment decision at issue in this case,\nour decision henceforth refers primarily to the Plan's provision\nto remedy the underrepresentation of women.

The manifest imbalance requirement is not the\n\nsame as a prima facie case against an employer.                       \"A manifest\n\nimbalance need not be such that it would support a prima facie case\n\nagainst   the    employer,    as       suggested     in     Justice    O'Connor's\n\nconcurrence, post, [480 U.S.] at 649 [107 S.Ct. at 1461], since we\n\ndo not regard as identical the constraints of Title VII and the\n\nFederal Constitution on voluntarily adopted affirmative action\n\nplans.\"   Id. at 632, 107 S.Ct. at 1452;             see also, Id. at 632 n.\n\n10, 107 S.Ct. at 1453 n. 10 (explaining the difference between\n\n\"manifest imbalance\" and \"prima facie\").\n\n      The plaintiffs' evidence contained statistical analysis on\n\neach of the Sergeant and Lieutenant examinations from 1982 to 1991.\n\nThe   plaintiffs   provided   the       district   court      with    statistical\n\nevidence on the number of total test takers for each exam, the\n\nnumber of test takers by racial or cultural classification, the\n\ntotal number of those promoted, the number of those promoted by\n\nclassification, the percentage of those promoted by classification,\n\n\n                                        29\n\fthe promotion rates of blacks and hispanics as a percentage of\n\nwhites promoted, the number of expected promotions for blacks and\n\nhispanics, the difference between actual and expected promotions\n\nfor blacks and hispanics, the number of standard deviations between\n\nexpected and actual promotions, and racial disparities in mean and\n\nmedian written scores.       The District Court found that no objector\n\npresented any credible evidence that any factor other than the\n\nchallenged tests, accounted for any meaningful part of the racial\n\ndisparities in the promotion rates between the different racial\n\ngroups.\n\n     The relevant labor market that was used in this case was the\n\nnumber    of   minority    police   officers     who   took    the    promotional\n\nexaminations.       Undoubtedly,       a    comparison     was   made    to    the\n\nappropriate labor market.11 We find that the plaintiffs established\n\na manifest imbalance in promotion rates for black and hispanic\n\nofficers, and that they brought this to the City of Houston's\n\nattention.\n\n                                       B.\n\n     Having     found     that   the   Consent    Decree      meets    the    first\n\nrequirement of the Johnson analysis, we now examine whether the\n\nConsent Decree unnecessarily trammels the rights of nonminorities\n\nor creates an absolute bar to their advancement.\n\n\n     11\n      Johnson states that where a job requires special training,\nthe comparison should be with those in the labor force who\npossess the relevant qualifications. Johnson, 480 at 632, 107\nS.Ct. at 1452. Therefore, we do not reach the issue of whether\nthe number of minorities in the police force is the only relevant\nlabor market.\n\n                                       30\n\f       In this case, the Consent Decree does not provide any remedy\n\nfor blacks or hispanics who failed the promotional tests at issue.\n\nMinorities who fail the promotional tests are not eligible for\n\nremedial promotions.             See Johnson 480 U.S. at 636, 107 S.Ct. at\n\n1454 (if plan fails to take distinctions in qualifications into\n\naccount,     it    would     dictate         mere     blind      hiring     by    numbers).\n\nFurthermore,       the    remedial       promotions        are     being   granted     on    a\n\none-time-only basis.             The Consent Decree does not call for any\n\nremedial promotions after the five-year phase in period.                                 With\n\nregard to the elimination of future test questions which are\n\nracially     biased,      questions       biased         against    any    race    will     be\n\neliminated. This will provide benefits to minority and nonminority\n\npolice officers. The elimination of racially biased questions will\n\noccur only over a ten-year period.                  After that period of time, the\n\nCity will no longer face this constraint.                       Likewise, the extension\n\nof    promotional        lists    from    one       to    two    years     increases      the\n\npossibility of promotion for all police officers.\n\n       The   Consent       Decree      does     not      require     the    discharge       of\n\nnonminority       officers       and   their       replacement      with    new    minority\n\nofficers.     See United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S.\n\n193, 208, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 2729, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979).                        Furthermore,\n\nthe   Consent     Decree     does      not    create       an    absolute    bar    to    the\n\nadvancement of nonminority officers.                      Id.      Although nonminority\n\nofficers may not be promoted at exactly the same rate and numbers\n\nas before, they will continue to be promoted in substantial excess\n\nof their representation among test takers.                         Finally, the Consent\n\n\n                                              31\n\fDecree in this case is a temporary measure.         It is not intended to\n\nmaintain     any   specific   racial   balance,   rather   it   attempts   to\n\nalleviate a manifest racial imbalance.\n\n     Therefore, the Consent Decree does not unnecessarily trammel\n\non the interests of nonminorities, nor create an absolute bar to\n\ntheir advancement.\n\n     Since the Consent Decree is justified by a manifest imbalance\n\nthat reflected the underrepresentation of minority police officers\n\nin the Sergeant and Lieutenant ranks, and the Consent Decree does\n\nnot unnecessarily trammel on the rights of nonminority officers, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\napproving the Consent Decree under Title VII.\n\n Validity under the Equal Protection Clause\n\n     Having found that the Consent Decree is valid under Title VII,\n\nwe now examine its validity under the Equal Protection Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.12\n\n          \"A district court evaluating a proposed Title VII consent\n\ndecree must determine whether the decree will have an unreasonable\n\nor unlawful impact on third parties if approved.\"                Black Fire\n\nFighters Ass'n v.

(citing Hazlewood School District v. United\n\nStates, 433 U.S. 299, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977)).\n\n      Evidentiary support for the conclusion that remedial action is\n      warranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is\n      challenged in court by nonminority employees.... In such a\n      case, the trial court must make a factual determination that\n      the employer had a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion\n      that remedial action was necessary.      The ultimate burden\n\n                                     33\n\f      remains    with   the    employees   to    demonstrate the\n      unconstitutionality of an affirmative-action program.  But\n      unless such a determination is made, an appellate court\n      reviewing a challenge by nonminority employees to remedial\n      action cannot determine whether the race-based action is\n      justified as a remedy for prior discrimination.\n\nId. at 277-78, 106 S.Ct. at 1849.\n\n      In this case the district court specifically found that:\n\n      Plaintiffs have proven the disparate impact of the challenged\n      examinations.   Their expert testimony and other evidence\n      created substantial doubt as to the job-relatedness of the\n      challenged tests.    It is not necessary for the Court to\n      resolve the question whether the challenged examinations were\n      job-related. Plaintiffs have shown a sufficiently firm basis\n      for the relief provided in the proposed Consent Decree.\n\n       As stated in the section discussing the validity of the\n\nConsent Decree in Title VII, the plaintiffs provided detailed\n\nstatistics on the promotion rates of nonminorities, blacks and\n\nhispanics.   The plaintiffs also identified numerous questions on\n\nthe examinations which they alleged were extremely difficult to\n\ndefend as job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nClearly, the district court had ample evidence from which to\n\nconclude that the plaintiffs had proven disparate impact and that\n\nthe City of Houston had justifiably concluded that it would be\n\ndifficult to defend the job-relatedness of the questions on the\n\npromotional exams.         More importantly, the City of Houston had a\n\nstrong basis in evidence to conclude that remedial action was\n\nnecessary.\n\n      Having found that the Consent Decree's racial classifications\n\nare   justified   by   a    compelling    governmental   interest,   namely\n\nremedying prior discrimination, we must now decide whether the\n\nConsent Decree is narrowly tailored to the achievement of that\n\n                                     34\n\fgoal.\n\n        The Supreme Court has focused on several factors in analyzing\n\nrace-conscious remedial measures: the necessity for the relief and\n\nthe efficacy of alternative remedies; the flexibility and duration\n\nof the relief, including the availability of waiver provisions;\n\nthe relationship of the numerical goals to the relevant labor\n\nmarket;     and the impact of the relief on the rights of third\n\nparties.    United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171, 107 S.Ct.\n\n1053, 1066, 94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987) (4-Justice plurality).\n\n Necessity for particular relief\n\n     In order to evaluate the district court's determination that\n\nthe remedial promotions, the elimination of racially biased test\n\nquestions on future exams, and the extension of the promotional\n\nlists from one to two years, were necessary, we must examine the\n\npurposes the relief was intended to serve.            Id.    The Consent Decree\n\nwas entered into in this case to remedy past discrimination and to\n\nalleviate the adverse impact of the promotional exams in the\n\nfuture.      The   remedial     promotions     are   only    directed      to   those\n\npositions where the discrimination occurred.                     Moreover, those\n\npromotions     are    only      for   those    who    most       likely     suffered\n\ndiscrimination       and   in    direct    proportion       to    the     amount   of\n\ndiscrimination they suffered.          As the district court pointed out,\n\nAsians and women were not allowed to become part of the plaintiff\n\nclass because they could not show that they were discriminated\n\nagainst in the promotional exams.\n\n The Flexibility and Duration of the Relief\n\n\n                                          35\n\f     To determine whether the Consent Decree meets the narrow\n\ntailoring    requirement,    consideration     of     the    flexibility     and\n\nduration of its proposed relief, must be undertaken.\n\n     The Consent Decree proposes remedial promotions which will be\n\nstretched over a five year period, the elimination of questions\n\nbiased against any race over a ten year period, and the extension\n\nof promotional lists from one to two years.           The relief which the\n\nConsent Decree proposes does not continue indefinitely. Rather, it\n\nis of a temporary nature.           The district court found that the\n\nplaintiffs' agreement to have the remedial promotions phased in\n\nover five years was a concession of great magnitude.             The remedial\n\npromotions will be phased in over a great period of time solely to\n\nmake sure that the disruption within the police department is\n\nminimized.     The   fact   that   racially   biased    questions     will   be\n\neliminated from exams for ten years does not mar the Consent\n\nDecree,   because    questions     biased   against    all    races   will   be\n\neliminated. Thus, all police officers will benefit. Likewise, the\n\nextension of the promotional lists to two years will help the\n\npromotional opportunities of all police officers.\n\n     With regard to flexibility, the Consent Decree does not impose\n\nrigid quotas against the police department.             The Consent Decree\n\nrequires only the remedial promotion of qualified blacks and\n\nhispanics. Only members of the plaintiff class who have passed the\n\nappropriate promotional exam are eligible for promotion.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 177, 107 S.Ct. 1053, 1069,\n\n94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987) (fact that requirement to promote blacks on\n\n\n                                     36\n\fa one for one ratio with whites could be waived if no qualified\n\nblack   candidates    were      available,    weighed    in    favor   of   the\n\nflexibility of an affirmative action plan under equal protection\n\nanalysis).     Hence, the police department is never required to\n\npromote an unqualified minority in preference of a qualified\n\nnonminority.\n\n     More importantly, the Consent Decree is not designed to\n\nmaintain any particular racial balance.           The police department is\n\nnot required to increase the number of minority promotions simply\n\nbecause it happens to promote more nonminorities in the future.\n\n Numerical Goals\n\n     Another method of determining whether the proposed relief is\n\nnarrowly tailored, is to examine the relationship of the numerical\n\ngoals to the relevant labor market.           This is one of the strengths\n\nof the Consent Decree.       The number of remedial promotions exactly\n\nmatches the number of promotions lost by black and hispanic police\n\nofficers.      For   example,    on   the    September   23,   1982    Sergeant\n\nexamination, the statistical analysis showed that hispanics did not\n\nsuffer any adverse impact.         Consequently, the hispanics were not\n\ngiven any remedial promotions based on this exam.\n\n     As previously stated, the relevant labor market that was used\n\nin this case was the number of minority police officers who took\n\nthe promotional examinations.         Unlike, other race-conscious plans\n\nwhich   have   not    passed     constitutional     muster     because      they\n\ninappropriately compare the number of minorities in a specific\n\nposition, regardless of the level of skill required for that\n\n\n                                      37\n\fposition, with the number of minorities in the general labor force,\n\nthe Consent Decree makes its comparison solely with the number of\n\nminorities in the police department.         Clearly, the number of\n\nminority police officers who took the exam is the relevant labor\n\nmarket.13    Once the remedial promotions are made, the promotional\n\nrelief ends, regardless of the percentage of blacks and hispanics\n\nin the Sergeant and Lieutenant ranks.\n\n Impact upon Third Parties\n\n          The impact upon third parties is a major aspect of this\n\nConsent Decree.     A state or local government may constitutionally\n\nrequire innocent nonminorities to share the burden of remedying the\n\neffects of past identified discrimination.          See Fullilove v.\n\nKlutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 484, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2777, 65 L.Ed.2d 902\n\n(1980).\n\n     It is evidently clear that the impact upon the nonminorities\n\nis negligible.     The Consent Decree does not impose an absolute bar\n\nto the promotion of nonminorities.      See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 184,\n\n107 S.Ct. at 1073.     More importantly, all the remedial promotions\n\nwill be to newly created positions by the City of Houston.      In no\n\nway are the nonminorities hurt by this Consent Decree.            The\n\nnonminorities will be able to compete for exactly the same number\n\nof promotions that would exist in the absence of the Consent\n\nDecree.     Their expectations and promotional opportunities are left\n\nfully intact.\n\n\n     13\n      Again, we do not reach the issue of whether the number of\nminorities who took the exam is the only relevant labor market.\n\n                                   38\n\f      As the district court stated in its opinion on denial of\n\nintervention for appeal:\n\n           The remedial promotions will be to positions that the\n      city would not have otherwise created, leaving the non-class\n      officers the same number of promotions that they would have\n      had in the absence of the decree.      The movants could have\n      claimed, but did not, that they should be allowed to compete\n      as equals for every position the city creates whether it would\n      have otherwise under current city policy. The city could not\n      create an additional set of officer positions and gratuitously\n      reserve them for blacks, women, or East Europeans.         The\n      positions created by the consent decree and the partial\n      reservation are predicated on an established history of abuse,\n      not on a claim to quotas or sensitivity to ethnicity in gross.\n\n      As to the HPPU appellants' fears that people who scored lower\n\non the promotional exams will be promoted before their members with\n\nhigher scores:\n\n      Their objections reflect confusion, at best.   All of the\n      examinations will be re-scored.    The union members must\n      compete fairly for promotions;  they do not have a vested\n      interest in continuing to receive the benefits of past\n      discrimination.\n\n      The Airport police also cannot claim that the Consent Decree\n\nharms their ability to be considered Class A officers or to be\n\nmerged with the Class A officers of the Houston Police Department.\n\nThe   District     Court   of   Harris    County,    Texas   has   specifically\n\nordered:\n\n      IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED ADJUDGED AND DECREED that members of\n      the Houston Police Department Specialized Police Division,\n      Park Police, of the City of Houston, Texas be denied entry\n      into the uniformed and Detective Class, (Class \"A\") of the\n      Houston    Police    Department   except    by    application,\n      qualification, and entry at an entry level position.\n\n      Based   on    the    factors   outlined   by    the    Supreme   Court   in\n\nParadise, we find that the Consent Decree is narrowly tailored.\n\n      Therefore, we conclude that the Consent Decree is valid under\n\n\n                                         39\n\fthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                         C.\n\n       Finally, we must answer the appellants objections which did\n\nnot fall under traditional Title VII or Equal Protection Clause\n\nanalysis.     The Consent Decree's use of \"log-linear\" analysis to\n\neliminate racially biased test items does not violate § 703(l ) of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by § 106 of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991.         That section was intended to prevent the\n\nmanipulation of test scores on valid employment-related tests.\n\nThis provision is not applicable to the promotional tests at issue,\n\nbecause there is substantial doubt as to their job-relatedness.\n\n      In   response    to   the    Comeaux     appellants'    objections,    the\n\ndistrict court found that it would be unreasonable to delay or\n\ncancel the proposed relief for persons who actively sought to press\n\ntheir rights, in favor of persons who did not press their rights.\n\nAs   the   appellees   point      out,   the   Comeaux   appellants   have   not\n\nproffered    any   evidence    that      the   failure   of   prosecution    was\n\nexclusively the fault of their counsel.\n\n       The district court aptly stated that there can be little\n\ndoubt that the federal courts have the power to enter an order\n\noverriding provisions of State or local law, where necessary, to\n\nprovide an appropriate remedy in a settlement of a case in which\n\nthe plaintiffs are alleging a violation of Federal law.               However,\n\nthe district court must take care that the provisions of State or\n\nlocal law are overridden only insofar as it is reasonable and\n\nappropriate to the remedy in question.             United States v. City of\n\n\n                                         40\n\fChicago, 549 F.2d 415, 437-38 (7th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.,\n\nArado v. U.S., 434 U.S. 875, 98 S.Ct. 225, 54 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977).\n\nWe agree with the district court that the Consent Decree impinged\n\nas little as possible upon the provisions of State law.\n\n     We conclude that the Consent Decree is valid under Title VII,\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and all of\n\nthe appellants objections.\n\n     Therefore, we affirm the district court's approval of the\n\nConsent Decree.\n\n                           III. CONCLUSION\n\n     We find that the district court appropriately denied the\n\nappellants' motions to intervene in the underlying case on the\n\nbasis of untimeliness.   Accordingly, we DISMISS those appeals.   We\n\nREVERSE the district court's denial of the appellants' motions to\n\nintervene for purposes of appeal.     Since we reach the appellants'\n\narguments as to the validity of the Consent Decree, and AFFIRM the\n\ndistrict court's approval of the Consent Decree, the district\n\ncourt's denial of the motions for purposes of appeal is harmless\n\nerror.    Furthermore, since we have affirmed the district court in\n\nthe entering of the Consent Decree and have held that the district\n\ncourt's denial of the motions to intervene for purposes of appeal\n\nis harmless error, the court below is AFFIRMED in all respects.14,15\n\n     14\n      The dissent accused the author of \"extrapolation\" of the\nrecord to get to the finding that the district court denied the\nintervention on the ground of untimeliness. All one has to do is\nread the briefs of the appellants who tried to intervene and they\nall admitted that their intervention was denied on grounds of\nuntimeliness and they argued as to why their motions to intervene\nwere not untimely. If the dissent wants to be blind to what the\n\n                                 41\n\f     PARKER, Circuit Judge, specially concurring,\n\n     While concurring with the majority opinion, I write separately\n\nto address some of the concerns expressed in the dissent.\n\n     The dissent professes surprise that the City would buy into\n\nthe fundamental premises of the Plaintiffs' case and is deeply\n\ntroubled by what the dissent characterizes as a decision of the\n\nCity to use a consent decree from the federal court as a crutch to\n\nachieve what it could not accomplish as a matter of its own\n\nindependent decision making.   Whether we, as judges, favor these\n\ntypes of controversies or not, whether we might have made different\n\ndecisions if we had been a party, whether or not we lament the\n\npolitical process that on occasion produces consent decrees in\n\ncivil rights cases is of no consequence.     The fact is that the\n\nparties decided to settle this case.\n\n\nappellants say on the issue, I have no control over that.\n     15\n      I wish to thank my co-panelist Judge Parker for his\nconcurring opinion and coming to the defense of the opinion which\nhe says he agrees with. I specially thank him for discussing the\nquestion of jurisdiction which the dissent seems to think we did\nnot have in this case.\n\n          I have never had any question in my mind about the\n     court having jurisdiction. The appellant police\n     organizations in this case, while not allowed to intervene,\n     participated in the \"fairness hearing\" provided by the 1991\n     amendments to the Civil Rights Act as objectors to the\n     Consent Decree. The statute that allowed them to appear as\n     objectors made them parties and, after the \"fairness\n     hearing\", if they were not satisfied with what the court had\n     done with the Consent Decree they had a perfect right to\n     appeal. They did not have to ask permission from anyone.\n     The statute made them parties. Appeal they did and we heard\n     their objections to the Consent Decree, but affirmed the\n     court below because the court had done the right thing in\n     approving the Consent Decree entered into between the class\n     and the City of Houston.\n\n                                42\n\f     This nineteen year old litigation was settled in a manner that\n\nprovided a limited and narrowly tailored remedy that responded to\n\nthe wrongs associated with the testing provisions for advancement\n\nwithin the Houston Police Department.           The testing provisions\n\neffectively    limited   advancement     opportunities   for    blacks   and\n\nhispanics.      The   consent   decree    provides   remedial    positions\n\navailable to the group of officers adversely affected by the old\n\ntesting procedures.      The narrowness of the settlement is further\n\nevidenced by the fact that the consent decree takes no jobs away\n\nfrom non-class members and imposes no duties or responsibilities on\n\nthem.   The consent decree does exclude non-class members from\n\ncompetition for 106 remedial promotions with remedial seniority,\n\nbut the remedial promotions will not prevent non-class members from\n\nbeing promoted on regular promotion schedules, and there will be no\n\ndemotions or layoffs in order to make remedial promotions possible.\n\nBased on the total aggregate promotions to sergeant and lieutenant\n\nfrom 1982-91, remedial promotions would only account for about 287\n\nof the total promotions available over the five year period of\n\nremedial promotions, or 147 of the total promotions over the life\n\nof the consent decree.     While these remedial promotions do have a\n\nlimited effect on promotional opportunities of non-class members,\n\nit is difficult to imagine any remedial scheme that would not have\n\nsome effect.     The leveling of the playing field for black and\n\nhispanic officers does not unduly trammel the interests of officers\n\nwho are not members of the plaintiff class.\n\n     Our role is not to delve into the propriety of the decisions\n\n\n                                   43\n\fthat resulted in the settlement but to address the legal issues\n\npresented     in   this   appeal.     The   issues   in    this    case     are\n\nstraightforward.     They are (1) whether there is some procedural or\n\njurisdictional impediment to our reaching the merits, and, if not\n\n(2) whether the district court erred in approving the consent\n\ndecree.\n\n     It is entirely proper for this Court to consider the merits of\n\nthe consent decree once it finds that a motion to intervene was\n\nimproperly denied. Under the \"anomalous rule\" governing the appeal\n\nof orders denying intervention in this Circuit, the Court has\n\nprovisional jurisdiction to determine whether the district court\n\nerroneously    concluded    that    Appellants   were     not    entitled    to\n\nintervene, and if it determines that the district court properly\n\ndenied intervention, appellate jurisdiction evaporates and the case\n\nis dismissed;      however, if the district court was mistaken, the\n\nappellate court retains jurisdiction and reverses.              Stallworth v.\n\nMonsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 263 (5th Cir.1977).           But our reversal\n\nof the district court's denial of a motion to intervene does not\n\nend our review.       If intervention was improperly denied, it is\n\nincumbent upon us to determine whether that denial was harmless\n\nerror.    See, e.g., Meek v. Metropolitan Dade County, 985 F.2d 1471\n\n(11th Cir.1993) (affirming on the merits after reversing the\n\ndistrict court denial intervention);        In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n\nin Matter of Freemen, 708 F.2d 1571, 1575 (11th Cir.1983) (per\n\ncuriam) (holding that failure to permit intervention was harmless\n\nwhere the appellate court \"considered [the defendants'] claim ...\n\n\n                                     44\n\fas   if   the   district   court   had    allowed   them   to   intervene\");\n\nWashington State Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council v. Spellman, 684\n\nF.2d 627, 630 (9th Cir.1982) (holding that improper denial of\n\nmotion to intervene did not require a new trial where proposed\n\nintervenor was permitted \"to participate in the argument on the\n\nappeal from the order granting summary judgment, and its conditions\n\nwere duly considered\"), cert. denied 461 U.S. 913, 103 S.Ct. 1891,\n\n77 L.Ed.2d 282 (1983);        Halderman v. Pennhurst State School &\n\nHospital, 612 F.2d 131, 134 (3rd Cir.1979) (applying harmless-error\n\nanalysis to denial of motion to intervene for the purpose of\n\nappealing).\n\n      Assuming the district court acted within its discretion in\n\ndenying as untimely Appellants' initial motions to intervene,1\n\n      1\n      According to the dissent, \"this case was still early in its\nnormal procedural history and that there is no question that the\nmotions to intervene were timely under \"all the circumstances.' \"\nDissent at 11-12. The dissent's characterization of the\nprocedural posture of this case ignores the fact that this\nlitigation had reached the point where it was obvious to all\nconcerned that the parties intended to settle the case. While\nthe motions to intervene might have been filed early in the\nprocedural history of this case if this case had a more\nconventional procedural history and it were actually going to\ntrial, they were filed very late in the game in the case of this\nconsent decree.\n\n           The Supreme Court addressed a similar situation in\n      NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 366-69, 93 S.Ct. 2591,\n      2603, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973). In that case, the State of New\n      York filed action seeking declaratory judgment that its\n      literacy tests had not been used for the purpose or with the\n      effect of denying or abridging the right to vote based on\n      race or color. In NAACP, the appellants filed their motions\n      to intervene just four days after the United States filed\n      its consent to the entry of declaratory and seventeen days\n      after learning of the pendency of the action. A three judge\n      panel denied NAACP's motion to intervene and granted summary\n      judgment to State of New York. Supreme Court upheld denial\n\n                                     45\n\fAppellants still have a sufficient interest to have a right to\n\nappeal the decision of the district court, and it was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion      to   deny   intervention       for   purpose   of   appeal.     The\n\ndistrict court's denial of Appellants' motions to intervene for the\n\npurpose    of    appeal     cannot   be     sustained     on   the    grounds   of\n\nuntimeliness. First, as noted in the majority opinion, the motions\n\nwere filed at the invitation of the district court within the time\n\nframe for such motions set up by the district court.                      Second,\n\nalthough the initial motions to intervene were untimely under\n\nStallworth, the Stallworth analysis does not lead to the same\n\nresult with respect to the denial of the motions to intervene for\n\nappeal.\n\n     The second Stallworth factor requires that we consider the\n\nprejudice to existing parties if the appellants intervention is\n\nallowed.     See Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 265.              In the context of a\n\nRule 24(a) intervention as of right, the only prejudice that we\n\nconsider is that prejudice caused by a would-be intervenor's delay\n\n\n\n\n     of intervention as untimely despite the early stage of the\n     litigation.\n\n          In the instant case, the underlying litigation had been\n     going on for almost twenty years. The earliest of the\n     motions to intervene were filed three months after Chief\n     Nuchia issued a departmental circular to all police officers\n     informing them of the potential settlement of the lawsuit\n     and 37 days after the district court published notice of the\n     terms of the consent decree. Under all the circumstances of\n     this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion\n     in denying Appellants' initial motions to intervene as\n     untimely.\n\n                                          46\n\fin filing its motion to intervene.2     Since Appellants moved to\n\nintervene for the purpose of appeal only and did not raise any\n\nissues that were not presented to the district court, it does not\n\nappear that the delay in filing their motions could have prejudiced\n\nthe existing parties.   Cf. McDonald v. E.J. Lavino Company, 430\n\nF.2d 1065 (5th Cir.1970) (holding that, although post-judgment\n\nmotions to intervene are normally viewed with a \"jaundiced eye,\"\n\nthe timing of post-judgment motion to intervene for the limited\n\npurpose of staking a claim to the proceeds of suit could not\n\nprejudice existing parties).   The existing parties would have been\n\n     2\n      The dissent argues that the second Stallworth factor,\nprejudice to the existing parties, has no significant application\nin the case of a Rule 24(a) intervention. This flies in the face\nof the clear language of Stallworth. Stallworth does not say\nthat prejudice to the parties is not a factor in a Rule 24(a)\nintervention, it says that, in the case of a Rule 24(a)\nintervention, prejudice other than that caused by the delay is\nnot considered.\n\n          The dissent paraphrases a statement in Stallworth that\n     \"to take any prejudice that the existing parties may incur\n     if intervention is allowed into account under the rubric of\n     timeliness would be to rewrite Rule 24 by creating an\n     additional prerequisite to intervention as of right.\"\n     Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 265. The dissent completely changes\n     the meaning of this sentence by omitting the emphasis on\n     \"any.' See Dissent at 694. The dissent ignores the\n     sentence immediately preceding sentence which says that \"it\n     is apparent that prejudice to the existing parties other\n     than that caused by the would-be intervenor's failure to act\n     promptly was not a factor meant to be considered where\n     intervention was sought under section (a).\" Stallworth, 558\n     F.2d at 265.\n\n          The dissent's complaint that the majority fails to\n     distinguish between permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)\n     and intervention as of right under Rule 24(a) with respect\n     to the application of this factor completely ignores the\n     fact that the majority only considered prejudice resulting\n     from the Appellants' delay in filing their motions to\n     intervene.\n\n                                47\n\fin exactly the same situation if Appellants had filed their motions\n\nto intervene for appeal only on the day this case was filed.\n\n     Perhaps more importantly, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n) creates an\n\n\"unusual circumstance\" under the fourth factor of the Stallworth\n\nanalysis.   Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n), if Appellants were denied\n\nentirely the right to intervene in this action, they would be\n\nprecluded from raising any challenge to the consent decree.    The\n\nfact that the district court initially denied Appellants motions to\n\nintervene without prejudice to refiling for the purpose of appeal\n\nremoved the effect of 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(n) from the \"unusual\n\ncircumstances\" in factor four of the Stallworth test. Cf. NAACP v.\n\nNew York, 413 U.S. 345, 368, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2605, 37 L.Ed.2d 648\n\n(1973) (absence of special circumstances warranting intervention\n\nillustrated by the fact that appellants were free to renew their\n\nmotion to intervene following the entry of summary judgment).\n\nHowever, when the district court denied Appellants' motion to\n\nintervene for appeal, it foreclosed the possibility of any further\n\nchallenge or appellate review of the consent decree.   This altered\n\nthe balance of the Stallworth factors to the extent that it was an\n\nabuse of discretion to deny Appellants motions to intervene for the\n\npurpose of appeal.\n\n     If, as the dissent contends, intervention for the purpose of\n\nappeal were not permitted by the Rules,3 it would have been error\n\n     3\n      The dissent contends that there is nothing in the Rules of\nCivil Procedure which contemplates a motion at the trial court\nlevel to intervene for appeal purposes only, so the denial of\nsuch an intervention cannot authorize us to reach the merits of\nAppellants' claims. However, while it is true that intervention\n\n                                 48\n\ffor the district court to deny Appellants' initial motions to\n\nintervene because of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n)'s effect on the fourth\n\nStallworth factor.    We would still reach the merits of Appellants'\n\nclaims.\n\n     The   district   courts'   denial   of   Appellants'   motions   to\n\nintervene for the purpose of appeal had no practical effect on\n\ntheir ability to present their positions on appeal.           Although\n\nAppellants' motions to intervene for the purpose of appeal were\n\ndenied, Appellants did present their objections to the consent\n\ndecree to this Court.    Though not \"allowed\" to participate in the\n\nappeal by the district court, Appellants did participate in the\n\nargument on appeal and presented their objections to the consent\n\ndecree to this Court, and their arguments were duly considered.\n\n     Appellants' situation with respect to the proceedings before\n\nthe district court was similar. Appellants had their day in court;\n\nthey had the amount of process they were due.      The dissent's view\n\nof what constitutes one's \"day in court\" would preclude consent\n\n\n\nfor the purposes of appeal only does not appear in the text of\nRule 24, it does appear in the case law. See, e.g., United\nAirlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 395-96, 97 S.Ct. 2464,\n2470-71, 53 L.Ed.2d 423 (1977) and the cases cited therein at n.\n16.; see also C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, 7C Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 1923, at 517 (2d ed. 1986).\n\n          The dissent also contends that there is nothing in the\n     newly enacted amendments to the Civil Rights Act which\n     evidences an intention to create an appeal from the fairness\n     hearing. While this too is true as far as it goes, it\n     ignores the fact that 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(n)(2)(A) explicitly\n     provides that those amendments shall not be construed to\n     alter the standards for intervention under Rule 24. So\n     2000e-2(n) cannot preclude an intervention procedure that\n     would otherwise be permissible.\n\n                                  49\n\fdecrees and would apparently mandate that these type cases all be\n\ntried.     The dissent's position appears to be that if one attains\n\nthe status of intervenor, then he can effectively thwart any\n\nconsent decree by being entitled to discovery, the presentation of\n\nevidence and witnesses, the right to a decision by a judge or jury,\n\nand the right to appeal.    Such a narrow view of fairness hearings\n\nin the context of consent decrees is without discernable authority.\n\n     Appellants have no substantial grounds to complain regarding\n\ntheir participation in the fairness hearing.      If Appellants had\n\nbeen granted intervenor status they would have been entitled to\n\npresent evidence and have their objections heard at the hearings on\n\nwhether to approve a consent decree, but they would not have the\n\npower to block the decree merely by withholding their consent.\n\nLocal Number 93, International Asso. of Firefighters, etc. v.\n\nCleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 529-30, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 3079, 92 L.Ed.2d\n\n405 (1986).    Although Appellants were not technically permitted to\n\nintervene in the district court action, they were allowed to\n\nintroduce evidence and cross-examine witnesses at the fairness\n\nhearing.    Appellants were permitted to air their objections to the\n\nreasonableness of the decree and to introduce relevant evidence;\n\nthe district court considered these objections and explained why it\n\nwas rejecting them.      See Cleveland, 478 U.S. at 529, 106 S.Ct.\n\n3079.    Neither intervenors nor objectors are entitled to hold\n\nconsent decrees hostage and require a full-blown trial in lieu of\n\na fairness hearing.    The issue here is how much process appellants\n\nwere due.     Even if appellants had been designated as intervenors,\n\n\n                                  50\n\fthey still got the process they were due.\n\n     The district court afforded Appellants de facto intervenor\n\nstatus   at   the    fairness     hearing      and    found   their   objections\n\nunconvincing.       Appellants have not shown that the district court\n\nwas wrong or that they would have been any more convincing at the\n\nfairness hearing if they had been designated intervenors rather\n\nthan objectors.      Appellants suffered no prejudice by the district\n\ncourt's failure to designate them intervenors apart from denying\n\nthem their right of appeal on the merits.               We have remedied that\n\nerror.\n\n     For the reasons set out in the majority opinion and in this\n\nspecial concurrence,       I    agree   with    the    majority   that   we    have\n\njurisdiction to review the merits of Appellants' claims.                      After\n\nconducting such a review, I agree that any error in denying\n\nAppellants' motions to intervene was harmless.                Although I agree\n\nthat the district court acted within its discretion in denying\n\nAppellants' initial motions to intervene, I do not believe that\n\nthat determination is critical to the outcome of this case;               if the\n\ninitial motions to intervene were improperly denied, I would reach\n\nthe same result.\n\n     DeMOSS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n     With some of the trepidation that I suspect was in the mind of\n\nDavid when he stepped forward to face Goliath, I write to express\n\nmy dissent and disagreement with the analysis and conclusions\n\nreached by my distinguished colleagues in the foregoing opinion.\n\n     I disagree with the panel majority's extrapolation from the\n\n\n                                        51\n\frecord that the district judge denied the motions for intervention\n\nbecause of \"untimeliness.\"          In my view, if the district judge\n\narticulated    any   reason   for    his    denial   of    the   motions   for\n\nintervention, it was because he felt that the right to object at\n\nthe fairness hearing was all he was obligated to afford to the\n\nwould-be intervenors.\n\n     I dissent and disagree with the majority panel conclusion that\n\nthe district judge's denial of the motion for intervention because\n\nof \"untimeliness\" was not clearly erroneous.              In my view, such a\n\nruling is clearly inconsistent with and not supported by any prior\n\ncase law nor by an appropriate construction of the newly adopted\n\namendment to the Civil Rights Act which speaks to this question.\n\n     I dissent and disagree with the panel majority's conclusion\n\nthat denial of a motion to intervene \"for appeal only\" is a final\n\njudgment which vests this court with appellate jurisdiction, when\n\na prior motion to intervene in the main case has been denied and\n\nsustained on appeal by the court.          In my view, there is nothing in\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which contemplates a motion at\n\nthe trial court level to intervene for appeal purposes only and\n\nthere is nothing in the newly enacted amendment to the Civil Rights\n\nAct which evidences an intention to create an appeal from the\n\nfairness hearing.\n\n     Some history is necessary to put this case and my dissent in\n\nperspective.    Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Martin v.\n\nWilks, 490 U.S. 755, 109 S.Ct. 2180, 104 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989), most\n\nfederal courts of appeal had adopted a very restrictive rule\n\n\n                                     52\n\fprecluding all challenges or collateral attacks on a Title VII\n\nconsent decree once it had been entered by a court.1               These courts\n\nconcluded (i) that the effectiveness of such decrees as a mechanism\n\nto settle claims short of or early in the litigation process would\n\nbe substantially undermined, if not eliminated, if the decrees were\n\nsubject to perpetual challenge;                and (ii) that such decrees have\n\nplayed a beneficial role in providing relief to thousands of\n\nvictims of systemic employment discrimination.2 However, in Wilks,\n\nthe Supreme Court, in rejecting the \"impermissible collateral\n\nattack doctrine\" of the circuit courts, found that (i) one of the\n\nclear principles of Anglo-American jurisprudence is \"that one is\n\nnot bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is\n\nnot designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party\n\nby service of process;\"          (ii) that one of the rules deeply rooted\n\nin our historic tradition is \"that everyone should have his own day\n\nin court;\"        and (iii) that the law does not impose on anyone the\n\nburden of voluntary intervention in a suit to which he is a\n\nstranger;        and that \"[u]nless duly summoned to appear in a legal\n\nproceeding, a person not a privy may rest assured that a judgment\n\nrecovered therein will not affect his legal rights.\"                 Wilks, 490\n\nU.S.       at   762,   109   S.Ct.   at   2184-85.     As   the   Supreme   Court\n\nrecognized, both FRCP 24(a) covering intervention as a matter of\n\n       1\n      See, e.g., Thaggard v.

Id.   Finally, \"the linchpin\n\nof the \"impermissible collateral attack doctrine'—the attribution\n\nof preclusive effect to a failure to intervene—is therefore quite\n\ninconsistent with Rule 19 and Rule 24.\"              Id. at 764, 109 S.Ct. at\n\n2186.\n\n     The U.S. Congress, however, concluded that the Supreme Court\n\nhad gone too far in Wilks, which in effect required mandatory\n\njoinder   of    all   parties   whose    interests      could   potentially   be\n\naffected, and the Congress therefore set upon the task of devising\n\na remedial scheme which would \"balance the rights of non-litigants\n\nagainst the need for finality of judgments and prompt relief for\n\ndiscrimination.\"       H.R.Rep. No. 40(I), 102d Cong. (1991), reprinted\n\nin, 137 Cong.Rec. 588 (1991), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1991,\n\n549, 588.       That balance is best achieved when all interested\n\nparties are allowed to participate in a single proceeding.              As the\n\nJudiciary Committee stated:\n\n     [T]he Wilks decision imposes inefficient and inequitable rules\n     on Title VII litigation.     Once an employment dispute has\n     reached the courts, the parties, all non-litigants with a\n     stake in its outcome, and the public have a strong interest in\n     bringing the litigation to an expeditious end.      Thus, all\n     related interests and claims should ordinarily be adjudicated\n     in one proceeding. (emphasis added). H.R.Rep.

It is\n\nsimilar in content to the pre-Wilks case law, although it imposes\n\nsome    new    requirements        (i.e.,    \"actual      notice   of    the   proposed\n\njudgment\") which were not requirements of that prior law.\n\n       Subsection n(2) sets forth the various circumstances in which\n\nsubsequent attack on a Title VII consent decree will not be\n\nprecluded.       Congress expressly stated its intent to include all\n\nrelevant parties in Subsection n(2)(A) which provides that nothing\n\nin   the      Subsection      is    intended      to   \"alter   the     standards   for\n\nintervention under Rule 24.\"             Although the majority opinion makes\n\nno mention of the effect these amendments, I believe that we should\n\nreconcile and address their effect on this suit.\n\n       With this general legal background in mind, I need to add some\n\ncomments about this particular lawsuit.                  It is a \"disparate impact\n\ncase\" and not an \"intentional discrimination case.\"                       It was filed\n\nAugust 19, 1992. As the majority opinion indicates, two previously\n\nexisting lawsuits, Kelly and Comeaux were consolidated into this\n\ncase.      Kelly, filed in 1975, and Comeaux, filed in 1976, both\n\nincluded assertions of disparate impact similar to those in the\n\ncurrent case.         The City of Houston filed an answer in this case on\n\nSeptember       30,   1992,    and    denied      generally     the   allegations    of\n\n                                             55\n\fdisparate impact in this case, just as it had done in the prior\n\ncases of Kelly and Comeaux.    The disparate impact is alleged to\n\noccur \"in racially discriminatory promotional examinations for the\n\nranks of sergeant and lieutenant in the Houston Police Department.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs sought certification by the trial court of two\n\nclasses of plaintiffs, African American and Hispanic American\n\nmembers of the police department who took examinations for sergeant\n\nand lieutenant during the years in question.   As I understand the\n\nrecord, the process for promotion in the Houston Police Department\n\nconsists of the following steps:\n\n1. The police officers who have served a defined number of years in\n     a lower grade are eligible to take the examination for\n     promotion to a higher grade.\n\n2. The officers who take and pass the promotional examination with\n     at least the established passing grade are eligible for\n     promotion.\n\n3. All eligible officers are then placed in rank order on a list of\n     those eligible for promotion in accordance with the sum of:\n\n          a. their actual score on that examination, plus\n\n          b. additional points, based on their years of service\n               with the police department.\n\n4.   As vacancies occur (resulting from death, withdrawal,\n      retirement, resignation, or from expansion of the force by\n      action of the City Council) these vacancies are filled from\n      the top of the list of eligibles downward until all vacancies\n      are filled.\n\nThis system produces the following general results:\n\n1. Individual police officers who make the highest scores on the\n     examination and have the largest number of points for years of\n     service are the first ones to be promoted; and\n\n2. The number of promotions actually made is a function of the\n     number of vacancies and not the number of eligibles on the\n     list.\n\n\n                                56\n\fThe plaintiffs tendered various statistical studies which showed\n\nthat comparing \"test takers\" and \"numbers of promotions\" for each\n\nof the categories of whites, blacks, and hispanics, there was a\n\nvariation in promotion rates for blacks and hispanics sufficiently\n\nlarge to rule out chance as the determining factor, and therefore\n\nthere was an adverse discriminatory impact.     This adverse impact\n\nwas attributed by plaintiffs to certain questions (not identified\n\neither by number or by content) on the examinations, which blacks\n\nand hispanics were alleged to have answered incorrectly more\n\nfrequently than whites.   However, in my judgment, the theory upon\n\nwhich the plaintiffs plead and supported their claims (as indicated\n\nby paragraphs 24-39 of the findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nwhich the plaintiffs prepared and persuaded the trial judge to sign\n\nin this case) suffer two fundamental conceptual breakdowns which\n\nrender their claims questionable:\n\nA. First of all, to prove \"disparate impact\" in the giving and\n     taking of an examination, one must compare \"test takers\" and\n     \"test passers.\" Not only did the plaintiffs not proffer any\n     statistical testimony based on this comparison, they alibied\n     out of the task (and got the district court to sign a finding)\n     on the grounds that the expense of making such a determination\n     was prohibitive.\n\nB. Secondly, to prove \"disparate impact\" in the promotion system\n     used by the city, you must compare the number of individuals\n     eligible for promotion with the number of individuals actually\n     promoted in each of the racial categories.\n\n     As I explained earlier, to be eligible for promotion, each\n\npolice officer, of all racial categories, must achieve the same\n\nminimum score;   and it is important to note in this case that there\n\nis no contention that the minimum passing score for blacks and/or\n\nhispanics was any different from that for whites.      But in their\n\n                                 57\n\fstatistical data, for purposes of comparison with the actual\n\npromotions in each minority category, the plaintiffs utilize a\n\nconcept of \"availability\" (the percentage of blacks and hispanics\n\nof all test takers ) as the starting point for determining a\n\nconcept of \"expected promotions\" (the number of minorities who\n\nwould be promoted if you applied the \"availability\" percentage to\n\nthe total number of actual promotions of all categories.) Clearly,\n\nin my judgment, the factor of \"available percentage\" should have\n\nbeen determined by determining the percentage of each minority\n\ncategory of all \"test passers\" (not test takers ) and the number of\n\n\"expected promotions\" would then be the percentage attributable to\n\neach minority group which were eligible for promotions as applied\n\nto the total number of promotions actually made.\n\n      If the statistical data incorporated in the findings of fact\n\nwas   the   same   data   presented   to   the   City   of   Houston   in   the\n\nsettlement negotiations, I am genuinely surprised that the city\n\nwould buy into the fundamental premises of the plaintiffs' case.\n\nObviously,     the    city   had   faced    similar     \"disparate     impact\"\n\ncontentions in the Kelly and Comeaux cases for more than ten years,\n\nand had consistently declined to recognize the validity of such\n\ncontentions.       The net results of the plaintiffs' claims and the\n\ncity's capitulation thereto, is a determination of a \"short fall\"\n\nin promotions to each of the minority groups and a determination to\n\naward \"remedial promotions\" to each of these minority groups on the\n\nbasis of such \"short fall.\"           There is, however, no evidence or\n\nfindings which can determine any individual as to which these\n\n\n                                      58\n\fremedial promotions should be granted.           In fact, under the consent\n\ndecree, these promotions will be awarded to whomever the city\n\nchooses from among the two minority groups.           I am deeply troubled\n\nby the decision of the city to use a consent decree from the\n\nfederal court as a crutch to achieve that which it could not\n\naccomplish as a matter of its own independent decision making,\n\ni.e., expand the composition of the police department by 96 new\n\nsergeants slots and award those slots on the basis of race.\n\n       At about this point, various other groups of police officers\n\nsought to intervene in this case.            Some of these groups are\n\nrepresentative of other minorities, i.e., women and Asians. Others\n\nof   these    groups   represent    associations    and   unions   of   police\n\nofficers.     Some of these groups sought to intervene as plaintiffs,\n\nalleging that they too had been victims of \"disparate impact\" in\n\nthe promotion process and that they should be entitled to share in\n\nthe assignment of the new sergeant and lieutenant slots authorized\n\nby the city council.      Other groups sought to intervene, in effect\n\non the side of the City of Houston, as defendants, asserting that\n\nthe examinations given for promotions were legitimate \"job related\"\n\nexaminations, and consistent with the \"business necessity\" and\n\nprofessional desire to see that the most qualified individuals were\n\npromoted to positions of leadership.         Some of these latter groups\n\nplead and proffered testimony that would show that the statistical\n\ndata   upon    which   plaintiffs    contended     \"disparate   impact\"   had\n\noccurred was flawed in concept or factually insupportable.                And\n\nthese contentions bring us to what I consider to be the \"gut\" issue\n\n\n                                      59\n\fin this lawsuit, i.e., \"Did the trial court properly dispose of\n\nthese motions to intervene?\"\n\n       The trial court set a hearing to consider the motions to\n\nintervene.    This hearing began at 9:30 a.m., continued without a\n\nrecess, and concluded after generating only 65 pages of transcribed\n\ntestimony.    Approximately the first 30 pages of this transcription\n\nset forth a dialogue between the trial judge and plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel regarding the nature and content of plaintiffs' asserted\n\ndiscrimination claims and the remedy provisions of some of the\n\naspects of the proposed consent decree.          About mid-way through the\n\nhearing, counsel for one of the would-be intervenors (the Houston\n\nPolice Patrolmen's Union) asked the court to direct its attention\n\nto the issue of intervention, which was the purpose of the hearing,\n\nand twice advised the court regarding the applicability of 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(n) as it relates to the subject of intervention.\n\nThe trial court, however, ignored such references to subsection\n\n(n).    Furthermore, at this hearing, supposedly on the subject of\n\nintervention, the court made no reference to Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a),\n\n24(b)   or   to   any   of   the   factors   relating   to   the   subject   of\n\nintervention under those rules.              There was no mention of the\n\nStallworth case, nor the four factors for determining a question of\n\ntimeliness thereunder. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court\n\nannounced its ruling from the bench as follows:\n\n       The motions to intervene are denied without prejudice to them\n       being reasserted after the objections are heard for purposes\n       of appealing the decision itself as opposed to any ruling of\n       the preparation of this issue. [sic]\n\n       Three days after the intervention hearing the district judge\n\n                                       60\n\ffiled a \"order on intervention\" which read, in its entirety, as\n\nfollows:\n\n1. The motions to intervene in this case as full active parties\n     representative by women, Asians, the airport police and park\n     police, and by Houston Police Patrolmen's Union and Park\n     Police Association are denied.\n\n2. The court will consider motions to intervene for purposes of\n     appeal. These motions must be filed by April 19, 1993.\n\n      The   district   judge   did   not   file   any   memorandum   opinion\n\nsupporting this \"order on intervention.\"           Notices of appeal from\n\nthe denial of the motions to intervene were timely filed within 30\n\ndays after the entry of such order.         These notices of appeal were\n\ndocketed under Appeal No. 93-2315 of this court.\n\n      As we begin the task of assessing the propriety of the trial\n\ncourt's denial of the motion to intervene, and particularly the\n\nissue of \"timeliness\" which is at the heart of that determination,\n\nI think it is imperative to have a clear sense as to the procedural\n\nposture of the main case when the motions to intervene were filed.\n\nThe intervention motions were essentially filed on or around March\n\n12, 1993.     As of that date, the original parties, (i.e., the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendant City of Houston):\n\nA. Had not filed any proposed order determining the class or\n     classes to be certified pursuant to Rule 23(c) even though\n     subpart (1) of that rule states that such action would be\n     taken \"as soon as practicable after the commencement of an\n     action brought as a class action;\"\n\nB.   Had not entered into any scheduling order under Rule 16\n      establishing time tables for \"joinder of parties, amendment of\n      pleadings, or completion of discovery\" as contemplated by that\n      rule;\n\nC. Had not engaged in any discovery activities or taken any\n    deposition pursuant to notices filed under Rule 26;\n\n\n                                     61\n\fD. Had not conducted any pretrial conferences for the purpose of\n     establishing a trial date; and\n\nE. Had not, obviously, undertaken any steps to implement any of the\n     changes or procedures contemplated by the proposed consent\n     decree.\n\n      As this court stated in Stallworth, \"timeliness is not limited\n\nto chronological considerations but \"is to be determined from all\n\nthe circumstances.' \"       Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257,\n\n263 (1977) (quoting United States v. United States Steel Corp., 548\n\nF.2d at 1235).       Viewed in the light of \"all the circumstances\" I\n\nwould say that this case was still early in its normal procedural\n\nhistory and that there is no question that the motions to intervene\n\nwere timely under \"all the circumstances.\"          The City of Houston\n\nfiled its answer on September 30, 1992, approximately 40 days after\n\nthe plaintiffs filed their original petition.        In that answer, the\n\nCity of Houston, as defendant, denied the essential elements of the\n\nplaintiffs' claim, called on the plaintiffs to prove \"disparate\n\nimpact,\" and tendered proof by the city in support of the business\n\nnecessity of the promotional examinations. The docket sheet of the\n\ncourt reflects absolutely no entries of any kind after September\n\n30, 1992, until November 19, 1992, when the parties filed a consent\n\norder on \"confidentiality of documents,\" which order was finally\n\nsigned and filed on December 14, 1992.       The next significant entry\n\non the court's docket was January 20, 1993, indicating a memorandum\n\nof   a   telephone    conference   which   made   arrangements   for   the\n\npreparation of a notice form to be sent out and established\n\npreliminary time tables for the return of objections and a pretrial\n\nconference. Consequently, for a period of almost four months, from\n\n                                    62\n\fthe date of the city's answer on September 30, 1992 to the entry of\n\nthe conference memorandum on January 20, 1993, there were no docket\n\nentries on the registry of the court which would have given any\n\nthird party who might be interested in the status of this case any\n\nreal substantive clue as to what was going on.    During this time,\n\nof course, the plaintiffs and the City of Houston initiated private\n\nsettlement discussions (sometime in late November) and Chief Nuchia\n\nsent out his circular to the police department on December 16.\n\n(See n. 8 of majority opinion, supra.)   However, it is evident from\n\nChief Nuchia's December 16th circular both that the consent decree\n\nwas not a done deal and that the details had not been released.\n\nThe panel majority attribute great significance to this December\n\n16th circular which I am not inclined to give, primarily because of\n\nthe tentative and preliminary nature of the information contained\n\ntherein. But, even assuming that it was sufficient notice to start\n\nsome \"timeliness\" clock ticking against the would-be intervenors,\n\nthe would-be intervenors took no more time to ultimately file their\n\nmotions to intervene than it took the city and plaintiffs to arrive\n\nat some preliminary concept of a consent decree.          The panel\n\nmajority admits that this time interval by itself \"would probably\n\nnot merit a finding of untimeliness\" but it nonetheless affirms the\n\ntrial court by relying principally on the second and third factors\n\nof the Stallworth analysis.\n\n     Stallworth's second factor relates to the prejudice which\n\nmight result to existing parties.    As Stallworth makes absolutely\n\nclear, such determination of prejudice as to existing parties is\n\n\n                                63\n\fapplicable primarily to motions for intervention under Rule 24(b)\n\n(permissive intervention) and has very limited application to\n\nmotions for intervention under Rule 24(a). Stallworth, 558 F.2d at\n\n265.       This is because the language about prejudice to existing\n\nparties exists only in the language of Rule 24(b).                   Therefore, to\n\ntake into account any prejudice that the existing parties may incur\n\nif intervention were allowed as part of the rubric of timeliness\n\nwould      be   to    rewrite   Rule       24(a)   by   creating    an   additional\n\nprerequisite to intervention as of right.                 Id.\n\n       This is precisely what the majority does in their opinion.\n\nAmazingly they cite Corley v. Jackson Police Dep't as authority for\n\nthat conclusion.         In Corley the motion to intervene was filed some\n\nfour       years     after   entry    of     the    consent     decree   and   after\n\nimplementation          of   the     consent       decree,    neither    of    which\n\ncircumstances exist in this case.                Corley v. Jackson Police Dep't,\n\n755 F.2d 1207 (5th Cir.1985).              Furthermore, although the would-be\n\nintervenors in this case sought to intervene under both Rule 24(a)\n\nand Rule 24(b), the majority does not even mention the distinction\n\nclearly established by Stallworth between those two rules on the\n\nsubject of prejudice to the existing parties.4\n\n       Likewise, when we turn to Stallworth's third and fourth\n\n\n       4\n      In essence what the majority opinion and the special\nconcurring opinion would establish as precedent for cases\ninvolving consent decrees is a rule that once the original\nparties to the litigation agree on the terms and conditions of a\nconsent decree and issue the notices required by subsection (n),\nany attempt by a third party to intervene is untimely as a matter\nof law. In my view, that just cannot be what Congress intended\nby the adoption of subsection (n).\n\n                                            64\n\ftimeliness factors, I think the trial judge and the panel majority\n\ncompletely    missed    the    boat.        The   boat    in    this   case     is    the\n\nsignificant impact which subsection (n) brings to the table of\n\ndiscussion about timeliness.           The panel majority dismisses factor\n\n4 by simply concluding that there were no unusual circumstances.\n\nAs to factor 3 the panel majority concludes that the would-be\n\nintervenors   \"had     their   day     in   court,\"      stating,      \"there    is    no\n\nprejudice to the appellants [the would-be intervenors] because\n\ntheir participation in the fairness hearing in effect gave them all\n\nthe rights they would have had they been made parties to the\n\nlawsuit.\"     The majority reaches this conclusion without even\n\nmentioning    the    language     of    subsection        (n)    which     obviously\n\nprejudices the would-be appellant's rights by foreclosing the\n\npossibility of subsequent challenge.               Rather than sanction this\n\nresult, Congress expressly tried to prevent it by encouraging\n\ninclusion of all interests in one proceeding.                   For example,\n\n     Subsection   (n)(2)(A)  states  that  the   standards  for\n     intervention under Rule 24 are not \"altered\" by (n)(1)(B),\n     regarding notice and an opportunity to present objections;\n     and\n\n     subsection (n)(2)(A) also states that the rights of parties\n     who have \"successfully intervened,\" pursuant to Rule 24, are\n     not altered by (n)(1)(B).\n\nIn my view these provisions contemplate that intervention could\n\noccur in the proceeding in which the notice and opportunity to\n\npresent objections would occur under (n)(1)(B), otherwise there\n\nwould have been no need to include the second part of (n)(2)(A).\n\n     Finally I note that there is nothing in subsection (n) which\n\nspeaks to the rights of parties who have been denied intervention;\n\n                                        65\n\fand there is nothing in subsection (n) which gives persons to whom\n\nnotice and opportunity to present objections have been afforded\n\nunder paragraph (1)(B) the right to appeal the entry of the\n\njudgment or order described in subparagraph (1)(A).\n\n     I submit that it is self evident from the face of the statute\n\nthat the provisions for notice and an opportunity to present\n\nobjections were not intended to take the place of intervention\n\nrights under Rule 24(a) or (b).               If any legislative history is\n\nnecessary to support this conclusion, I cite the following:\n\n     A person wishing to challenge an employment practice that\n     implements a court decree will thus retain the right under\n     Rule 24 to seek to intervene in the proceeding in which the\n     decree was entered and, the court will determine whether\n     intervention is appropriate through reference to the\n     principles that have developed under Rule 24. Similarly, the\n     preclusion rules do not apply to the rights of parties who\n     successfully intervene pursuant to Rule 24. H.R.Rep. 40(I),\n     102d Cong. (1991), reprinted in, 137 Cong.Rec. 597 (1991),\n     U.S.Cong. & Admin.News 1991, 597.\n\n     Furthermore,      in   the   same    legislative    history,   the   house\n\ncommittee report states as follows:\n\n     They [the provisions regarding notice and a reasonable\n     opportunity to be heard] advance the important goal of\n     judicial finality by permitting all interests affected by a\n     Title VII consent decree to be considered fully and fairly in\n     a single proceeding, prior to entry of the decree.       These\n     provisions also embody the principle that third parties are\n     best left to decide for themselves (after receiving sufficient\n     notice) whether to enter pending litigation, rather than being\n     forcibly joined, regardless of their wishes or intentions, as\n     the Wilks rule requires. Id. at 594 (emphasis added).\n\n     Finally,    the    legislators       specified     that   subsection   (n)\n\nprovides   for   the   inclusion     \"of      all   reasonably   ascertainable\n\ninterested parties in a single proceeding\" and precludes subsequent\n\nchallenges \"only where preclusion is consistent with due process.\"\n\n\n                                         66\n\fId. at 597.\n\n     Given the plain language of the statute and this legislative\n\nhistory, I submit that subsection (n) affords an individual who has\n\nreceived actual notice of a consent decree which might adversely\n\naffect his interests, three options.   They are:\n\nA. He may do nothing, in which event he will be precluded from\n     challenging the judgment or order;\n\nB. He may elect to present his objections on or before the date set\n     by the notice, in which event he has no right to appeal from\n     whatever disposition the court makes of his objections, and he\n     will be precluded from challenging the judgment ultimately\n     entered; or\n\nC. He may move to intervene in the proceeding, in which event one\n     or the other of the following results may occur:\n\n1. If his motion to intervene is granted, he would be granted all\n     of the rights of a normal party litigant therein, would not be\n     precluded from asserting his rights under the Constitution or\n     Federal Civil Rights Laws, would be afforded the right to\n     appeal from the final judgment therein, and would be bound by\n     principles of res judicata to the final judgment established\n     therein; or\n\n2. If his motion to intervene is denied, he would have the right to\n     appeal such denial as may be afforded under Rule 24; and he\n     may elect to participate or not participate in the opportunity\n     to present objections, but in such latter event he would be\n     precluded from challenging the judgment or order finally\n     entered therein unless an appellate court determined that his\n     motion to intervene was improperly denied by the trial court.\n\n     Under this analysis, the requirements of subsection (n) create\n\nspecial and unusual circumstances under Stallworth's fourth factor\n\nwhich requires that the timeliness of would-be intervenors' motions\n\nto intervene be assessed in light of the notice required under\n\nsubsection (n)(1)(B).   Likewise, the assessment under Stallworth's\n\nthird factor, the prejudice which the would-be intervenor will\n\nsuffer if intervention is denied, should be assessed in light of\n\n\n                                 67\n\fthe preclusive effect which subsection (n) produces as a result of\n\nsuch denial.    Courts have often rationalized denying intervention\n\non the grounds that the would-be intervenors could later bring\n\ntheir own separate suit to assert their particular remedies. Under\n\nsubsection (n) this will no longer be true.            Consequently, in my\n\nview, the proper course for our trial courts to follow when faced\n\nwith a motion to intervene in a Title VII proceeding, is to permit\n\nsuch intervention when the motion for intervention is filed prior\n\nto the entry of the final decree, and prior to the date set for\n\nresponse   in   the   notices   sent    out   under   Paragraph   (1)(B)   of\n\nsubsection (n). Such course of action is fully consistent with the\n\nstatements of policy reflected by the legislative history quoted\n\nabove and fully reconciles the two great policy considerations\n\nwhich motivated Congress to pass subsection (n).            The majority's\n\nposition, finding intervention untimely even when filed before\n\nentry of the consent decree and before the date for responses, is\n\ninconsistent with our well-established precedent and effectively\n\nforecloses   meaningful    participation      by   non-minority   and   other\n\ninterested groups in Title VII litigation.5           Such a bold departure\n\n     5\n      Our decisions finding intervention untimely have all\ninvolved motions filed well after entry of the consent decree.\nSee Corley v. Jackson Police Dep't, 755 F.2d 1207 (5th Cir.1985)\n(intervention untimely when filed 50 months after consent decree\nentered); Smith v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 615 F.2d 683 (5th\nCir.1980) (intervention untimely when filed 2 years after entry\nof judgment); Hefner v. New Orleans Public Serv., Inc., 605 F.2d\n893 (5th Cir.1979) (intervention untimely when filed two years\nafter entry of judgment), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 955, 100 S.Ct.\n1639, 64 L.Ed.2d 231 (1980); United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum\nIndus., Inc., 553 F.2d 451 (5th Cir.1977) (intervention untimely\nwhen filed seven and one-half months after judgment), cert.\ndenied, 435 U.S. 914, 98 S.Ct. 1467, 55 L.Ed.2d 505 (1978). Our\n\n                                       68\n\ffrom precedent should at least be acknowledged and discussed by the\n\nmajority.\n\n       Having disposed of the motions to intervene, the trial court\n\nmoved on to conduct what has been euphemistically referred to as\n\nthe \"fairness hearing.\"         This hearing occurred two days after the\n\nhearing on the motions to intervene, began at 9:00 a.m., had a\n\nlunch break, and was concluded at about 5:00 p.m.             A large part of\n\nthis    hearing   consisted     of    dialogue   between   counsel    for    the\n\nplaintiffs, the city, and the \"objectors\" and between those counsel\n\nand the court.      In essence, the \"hearing\" consisted of a verbal\n\nrehash of the terms and conditions of the consent decree and the\n\ncontent   of    written   objections     which   had   been   filed    by    many\n\nindividuals and by the would-be intervenors.            Some live testimony\n\nwas presented by the police chief and by the statistical expert for\n\nplaintiffs.       The court declined, however, to accept any live\n\ntestimony tendered by an expert of HPPU, one of the would-be\n\nintervenors-objectors.         The document labeled \"Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law\" which contains 102 pages, and which the trial\n\ncourt signed and filed the next day, was pre-drafted apparently by\n\nthe plaintiffs and was present, and frequently referred to, during\n\nthe fairness hearing.          In my view, this \"fairness hearing\" was\n\nnothing more than a drill to permit the district court to rubber\n\nstamp   its    approval   of    the   pre-drafted   findings    of    fact   and\n\n\n\nlandmark decision in Stallworth found intervention timely when\nfiled one month after entry of judgment. See Stallworth, 558\nF.2d at 266. (The mere fact judgment has already been entered\nshould not require that intervention be denied as untimely.)\n\n                                        69\n\fconclusions of law, and ultimately the consent decree.                       To label\n\nthis    hearing,   as     the    majority       does    in   their    discussion    of\n\nStallworth's third factor, as in effect affording the would-be\n\nintervenors \"their day in court\" is to render that historical\n\nfigure of speech meaningless.              In my view, to \"have your day in\n\ncourt\" means that one is a party to the litigation, having all of\n\nthe rights of discovery, rights of presentation of evidence and\n\nwitnesses, the right to have disputed issues determined by an\n\nimpartial trier of fact in accordance with the rules of evidence,\n\nand ultimately the right to appeal.               I do not mean to say that the\n\ntrial    judge    erred    in    failing     to    afford     such    a    full   blown\n\nevidentiary hearing to the objectors. Clearly, Paragraph (1)(B) of\n\nsubsection (n) speaks only of \"a reasonable opportunity to present\n\nobjections\" as the second requirement after sufficient notice.\n\nThis statutory provision does not even contain the word \"hearing\"\n\nmuch less the words \"evidentiary hearing\" in defining the manner in\n\nwhich objections are to be presented.                  But, what I do mean to say,\n\nis that the status of \"objector\" under Paragraph (1)(B) is a far\n\ncry from    the    status       of   \"a   party   intervenor\"        and   \"reasonable\n\nopportunity to present objections\" is not the same as \"a day in\n\ncourt.\"     For the majority to support its conclusion that the\n\nwould-be intervenors suffered no prejudice because they had their\n\nday in court is nothing but an empty rationalization.\n\n            MOTION TO INTERVENE FOR APPEAL PURPOSES ONLY\n\n       During the course of the so-called intervention hearing, the\n\nidea that such would-be intervenors might be permitted to intervene\n\n\n                                           70\n\ffor appeal purposes only was floated by the plaintiffs and the City\n\nof Houston.   The district court picked up on this idea and included\n\nit in the second paragraph of its brief order denying intervention\n\nin the underlying action.     On April 19, 1993, the date specified by\n\nthe district judge's invitation, the would-be intervenors filed\n\nsuch motions to intervene for appeal purposes only.                On May 20,\n\n1993, the district court entered an order denying the motions to\n\nintervene for purposes of appeal, and filed therewith an \"Opinion\n\non Denial of Intervention for Appeal\" (\"Opinion\").                 Since this\n\ndocument is the best evidence of what the district judge really had\n\nin his mind in ruling on the various motions, I quote two portions\n\nthereof which I think are extremely relevant:\n\n1. These various groups argue that the consent decree does not help\n     them, and worse, it hurts them. They assert that the remedy\n     here injured them. Their remedy is not to intervene, but to\n     object to the decree. They did, and they were not persuasive.\n     (emphasis added) Opinion, at 3.\n\n2. The non-parties assert that they should be allowed to intervene\n     so that they can address on appeal the fact that their\n     objections to the consent decree were overruled, and that they\n     were not allowed to intervene in the case as parties. Their\n     motions are made in a vacuum; they lack substance, support,\n     and persuasion. Id. at 5.\n\n     While the first of the quoted paragraphs above was written\n\nsome two months after the district court originally ruled on the\n\nprimary   motions   to   intervene   in   the   main   case,   I   think   the\n\nunderlined portion of that paragraph clearly indicates that the\n\ndistrict court operated under a mistake of law as to the impact of\n\nsubsection (n).     For the reasons which I have set forth earlier, I\n\nthink the explicit language of the statute and the supporting\n\nlegislative history makes clear that rights of intervention under\n\n                                     71\n\fRule 24(a) or (b) were not changed by the passage of subsection\n\n(n).    Again, it is important to note that nowhere in its Opinion\n\ndid the district court mention Rule 24(a) or (b), or subsection\n\n(n), or the Stallworth case, or any of the four factors defined in\n\nStallworth as considerations to determine timeliness.                     Given this\n\nlanguage used in the Opinion, I think the majority's conclusion\n\nthat   the    trial    judge    based   his        decision   on   \"timeliness\"     is\n\ninsupportable.\n\n       The second quoted paragraph above gives the district court's\n\nexplanation for denying the motions to intervene for purposes of\n\nappeal only.        I think the district court was correct in denying\n\nsuch   motions,     but   for   reasons        entirely   different       from   those\n\nmentioned by the district court.           First of all, I find no authority\n\nin any federal rule of civil procedure for the filing of a motion\n\nto intervene for purposes of appeal only.                     Nothing in Rule 24\n\nrefers to such a motion and no one has cited any statute which\n\ncreates      such     right.      While        I    recognize      that   Stallworth\n\ncharacterizes our circuit's rule regarding appeal of denial of a\n\nmotion to intervene as \"anomalous,\" the majority's tacit approval\n\nof the filing of a motion to intervene for appeal only, and\n\nconsideration on appeal of the denial of such a motion, carries our\n\ncircuit practice beyond the area of anomaly into the area of shear\n\nnonsense.     A would-be intervenor certainly has a right to appeal\n\nfrom the denial of his motion to intervene under our practice, but\n\nif the trial court was right in denying such motion, then the\n\nwould-be intervenor is finished, through, out-of-the case and in my\n\n\n                                          72\n\fjudgment should not be permitted to file further motions or notices\n\nin that case.     On the other hand, if the trial court was wrong in\n\ndenying the     motion     for   intervention,    then   the   relief    at    the\n\nappellate level is to vacate the judgment entered into without the\n\nwould-be intervenor's participation, and remand the case with\n\ninstructions to permit the intervention and proceed with a retrial.\n\nIn either such event, the concept of a motion to intervene for\n\nappeal purposes only is surplusage.\n\n     Secondly, it is perfectly clear that subsection (n) does not\n\ncontemplate any appellate review process after the \"reasonable\n\nopportunity to present objections.\"              That would clearly be the\n\nsituation if no one ever attempted to intervene in the main\n\nproceeding and simply decided to file a motion to intervene for\n\nappeal purposes only after the trial judge has conducted the\n\n\"fairness hearing\" and was unpersuaded by their objections.                   I do\n\nnot think   the    court    should   infer   an   appellate    process    where\n\nCongress has not prescribed one, especially not as to the merits of\n\nthe case.   In this case, the would-be intervenors whose original\n\nmotions to intervene were denied, should not be able to intervene\n\nfor appeal purposes only in order to appeal the court's rejections\n\nof their objections. Since they have already given their notice of\n\nappeal as to the denial of their original motions to intervene,\n\nthere really is nothing further which could be considered by a\n\nmotion to intervene for appeal purposes only.\n\n     Consequently, I would conclude that this court does not have\n\nappellate jurisdiction to consider the denial of a motion to\n\n\n                                      73\n\fintervene for appeal purposes only in a Title VII action.              I think\n\nthe panel majority errs in undertaking that task.               I note with\n\ninterest however, that the panel majority proceeds to find (i) that\n\nthe trial court erred in denying such motions, (ii) that the\n\nwould-be   intervenors      had   an   interest   sufficient      to   support\n\nintervention as of right and were so situated that disposition of\n\nthe action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede their\n\nability to protect that interest, and (iii) that the existing\n\nparties, i.e., the plaintiffs and the City of Houston, did not\n\nadequately represent the interest of the would-be intervenors.             In\n\nso doing, the panel majority makes clear that, but for their\n\nconclusion that the original motions to intervene were \"untimely,\"\n\nthe would-be intervenors would have satisfied all of the other\n\nrequirements of Rule 24(a) to justify intervention.            Even assuming\n\nthe   trial   court   had    denied     intervention   on   the    basis   of\n\nuntimeliness, and I do not believe it did, finding a motion to\n\nintervene untimely when filed both before the fairness hearing and\n\nbefore entry of judgment sets bold and, in my opinion, unwise new\n\nprecedent.    I am at a loss to understand the majority's reasoning.\n\n      Having affirmed the district court's denial of the original\n\nmotion to intervene on the basis of \"untimeliness,\" and having\n\ndismissed the appeals relating thereto, the majority now turns\n\naround and takes appellate consideration of the trial court's\n\ndenial of motions to intervene for appeal purposes only, filed by\n\nindividuals and groups who were no longer in the case, and reverses\n\nthe denial of such motions on the grounds that these same persons\n\n\n                                       74\n\fand groups met all of the requirements of Rule 24(a) to intervene.\n\n                     MERITS OF CONSENT DECREE\n\n     As pointed out by the majority opinion, neither the City of\n\nHouston nor the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the final\n\njudgment of the district court approving and adopting the consent\n\ndecree.   This is not surprising since those parties had agreed to\n\nthe entry of the consent decree in the first place.       The only\n\npersons and groups who filed notices of appeal as to the entry of\n\nthe final judgment were the would-be intervenors who filed those\n\nnotices as part of the notices of appeal relating to the denial of\n\ntheir motions to intervene.     These notices were filed in the\n\ninterval between the filing of their motions to intervene for\n\npurposes of appeal and the order of the trial court denying such\n\nmotions to intervene for purposes of appeal.    Consequently at the\n\ntime the notices of appeal relating to the merits of the consent\n\ndecree were filed, the would-be intervenors were clearly not\n\nparties to the proceeding, because their motions to intervene\n\noriginally had been denied and their motions to intervene for\n\npurposes of appeal only had not been acted upon.         So, in my\n\njudgment, we face another enigma quite similar to the one discussed\n\nin the preceding section, and it boils down to this question:   \"Can\n\nour court take appellate jurisdiction of an appeal originating from\n\na notice of appeal filed by parties and groups who were not at that\n\ntime either original parties or intervenors and whose motions to\n\nintervene for appeal purposes only had been filed but not acted\n\nupon by the district court?\"   My answer to the question would be,\n\n\n                                75\n\f\"surely not.\"   Non-parties whose motions to intervene in the main\n\ncase have been denied have standing to appeal only the denial of\n\nsuch intervention.    As to other and further proceedings in that\n\ncase, they remain non-parties until the appellate court reverses\n\nthe denial of their motion to intervene, which the panel majority\n\nhas concluded not to do in this case.            Had the district court\n\ndecided to permit their intervention for appeal purposes only, some\n\nargument might be made that permission should relate back to the\n\nnotices of appeal which they previously filed regarding the merits\n\nof the consent decree.       But, in this case, the district court\n\ndenied their motions to intervene for appeal purposes only, so no\n\nrelation back concept could be at work here.          In addition to the\n\nproblem of standing for filing notices of appeal, we face once\n\nagain the   problem   that   subsection   (n)    clearly   does    not   make\n\nprovision for any appeals from whatever the trial court decides to\n\ndo in light of the filing of objections.        Surely, when Congress has\n\nnot made provision for an appeal, the courts should not \"legislate\"\n\nthat there be one.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, I think the panel majority makes a\n\nmistake in addressing the merits of the consent decree.           I realize,\n\nof course, that the would-be intervenors (\"appellants\") spend a\n\nconsiderable portion of their briefs arguing the merits and the\n\nplaintiffs and the City of Houston, to a lesser extent, respond.\n\nHowever, this court has frequently stated that we are a court of\n\nlimited appellate jurisdiction, that we can and should address sua\n\nsponte whether our jurisdiction exists, and that neither the\n\n\n                                  76\n\fparties' expressed nor implied consent can vest our court with\n\njurisdiction when it does not, in fact, exist.                       E.g., U.S. v.\n\nGarner, 749 F.2d 281 (5th Cir.1985).                 I realize also that in an\n\nearlier portion of this dissent, I made derogatory comments about\n\nthe theory of the plaintiffs' claims of \"disparate impact.\"                    I did\n\nso not to try to evaluate the merits of those claims, but to\n\nindicate, that in my judgment the claims asserted by the would-be\n\nintervenors were sufficient to create a good faith controversy, and\n\nfor the good of all concerned, employers and opposing groups or\n\nfactions   of   employees,   the   place           and   time   to   resolve   those\n\ncontroversies is in one single proceeding.                When the employer is a\n\npublic entity (as in this case) and when the relief proposed is\n\nremedial promotions and adjustments in seniority based directly on\n\nrace, I think the role of a federal judge presented with a proposed\n\nconsent decree takes on extremely critical importance.                    When the\n\nnotices sent out under subsection (n) generate motions to intervene\n\nby individuals and groups of the quantity and quality as occurred\n\nin this case, i.e., the Houston Police Patrolmen's Union, the\n\nHouston Police Officers Association, the Houston Airport Police\n\nOfficers Association, the Park Police Officers Association, the\n\nAsian American Police Officers Association, and the Female Police\n\nOfficers Association, then the court should be extremely careful in\n\nrushing to judgment on the basis of the proposed consent decree\n\napproved by the initial parties. Our system of justice is premised\n\non the idea that truth can best be arrived at by subjecting the\n\ncontentions     of   each   side   to        the    critical     and   adversarial\n\n\n                                        77\n\fexamination by the other side.                  And whether, as in this case,\n\n\"disparate impact\" has in fact occurred, and whether, as in this\n\ncase, remedies for such \"disparate impact\" have been carefully and\n\nnarrowly tailored to cure only the \"disparate impact\" can best be\n\ndetermined by submitting the controversies to impartial jury and\n\njudge. When all parties potentially affected and involved agree on\n\nthe    essential       findings    and    conclusions,   a   consent   decree   is\n\ncertainly appropriate.6           But when real and substantial segments of\n\nthe employee population assert that \"disparate impact\" did not\n\noccur and that the remedial changes go beyond the scope of the\n\nalleged \"disparate impact\" and affect their individual interests,\n\nthen       they    should   be   allowed   to    intervene   and   present   those\n\ncontentions ultimately, if necessary, to the jury and judge.\n\nObviously, that may produce more work for the court and some delay\n\nat arriving at a final determination, but the provisions of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure are clearly adequate to provide\n\nfor    the        prompt    elimination    of    frivolous   and   insupportable\n\ncontentions, the severance of the process into separate liability\n\nand remedy determinations, and the entry of either summary or\n\npost-trial judgments which will truly be binding upon all of the\n\n\n       6\n      Such a case was relied on, inappropriately I believe, by\nthe trial judge. At the hearings and in the Findings of Fact and\nConclusions of Law, the trial judge and the original parties\nrelied upon evidence generated in the case involving Houston\nFirefighters. Houston Chapter of the Int'l Ass'n of Black\nProfessional Firefighters v. City of Houston, 56 Fair\nEmpl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 445, 1991 WL 340296 (1991). In that case,\nhowever, the non-minority interests were certified as a class,\nparticipated in the negotiations and signed the proposed consent\ndecree.\n\n                                           78\n\fparties and interests and thoroughly satisfy the public interest in\n\nthe finality of such determinations.\n\n     In conclusion, I do not agree that the trial court denied the\n\nmotions to intervene on the basis of untimeliness.                  Instead, the\n\nopaque statements quoted by the majority and the district court's\n\nopinion denying intervention for purposes of appeal suggest that\n\nthe trial judge believed that subsection (n) of the 1991 amendments\n\nto the Civil Rights Act established a new threshold for due\n\nprocess:     substituting notice and an opportunity to object for a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time.                However,\n\neven if I agreed that this was the court's rationale, the decision\n\ntoday flies in the face of established precedent as well as the\n\nstated policy of subsection (n) of the 1991 amendments to the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991.          As far as I know, we have never found\n\nintervention     filed    before   entry    of   the    consent    decree   to   be\n\nuntimely. I believe the would-be intervenors in this case acted as\n\nquickly    as   possible    by   moving    approximately     six    weeks   after\n\nstatutorily anticipated notice, before the expiration of the time\n\nallotted for objections and before the fairness hearing.\n\n     I do not agree that they had their \"day in court\" either in\n\nthe trial court below or here on appeal.                  Our decision today\n\nappears    to   condone    judicial   approval     of    privately    negotiated\n\nconsent decrees      without     consideration     of    potentially    affected\n\ninterests.      Considering the preclusive effect of subsection (n) of\n\nthe 1991 amendments to the Civil Rights Act, I do not think such an\n\napproach affords due process.\n\n\n                                      79\n\f     Finally, neither the denial of the so-called \"motions to\n\nintervene for purposes of appeal only,\" for which I can find no\n\nbasis in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, nor the substantive\n\nmerits of the consent decree, which were appealed only by persons\n\nwho were not party to this suit, were properly before this court.\n\n     For all of the foregoing reasons, I would REVERSE the decision\n\nof the trial court denying the original motions for intervention,\n\nVACATE the final judgment approving the consent decree, and REMAND\n\nthis case to the trial court for further proceedings.   I would also\n\nDISMISS the appeal of the denial of the motion to intervene for\n\nappeal purposes only, and DISMISS the appeal as to the merits of\n\nthe final judgment entered by the trial court, on the grounds of\n\nlack of appellate jurisdiction in both cases.\n\n                            * * * * * *\n\n\n\n\n                                80\n\f",

GARZA, DeMOSS and PARKER, Circuit Judges.\n\n     REYNALDO G. GARZA, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Organizations representing different members of the Houston\n\nPolice Department sought to intervene in a consent decree entered\n\ninto by the City of Houston and a class of black and hispanic\n\npolice officers.   The district court denied intervention in the\n\nunderlying case and also intervention for purposes of appeal.   The\n\norganizations appeal the denial of these motions and also claim\n\nthat consent decree violates Title VII and the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n     We find that the district court appropriately denied the\n\nmotions to intervene in the underlying case;      accordingly, we\n\nDISMISS those appeals.   We find, however, that the district court\n\nerred in denying the motions to intervene for purposes of appeal.\n\nTherefore, we REVERSE the district court in this matter.   Finally,\n\nwe find that the consent decree survives scrutiny under Title VII\n\nand the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, we AFFIRM the district court's approval of the consent\n\ndecree.\n\n                           I. BACKGROUND\n\n     The original Complaint in this action was filed on August 19,\n\n1992, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n2000e et seq., as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.   The plaintiffs in this\n\naction filed timely charges of racial discrimination with the EEOC,\n\n                                 2\n\falleging that the City of Houston's promotional examinations for\n\nthe   ranks   of    Sergeant   and    Lieutenant   in    the    Houston   Police\n\nDepartment discriminated against African-Americans and Hispanic-\n\nAmericans between August 29, 1991 and March 26, 1992.1               Efforts to\n\nobtain redress for the Police Department's allegedly discriminatory\n\ntests began in 1975 and 1976, when Kelley v. Hofheinz, C.A. No H-\n\n75-1536, and Comeaux v. City of Houston, C.A. No. 76-H-1754, were\n\nfiled.\n\n      Among other claims, the Kelley and Comeaux cases raised the\n\nclaim that the promotional examinations of the Houston Police\n\nDepartment discriminated against African-American police officers\n\nbased on their race in violation of Title VII.               These challenges to\n\nthe promotional tests were based upon 1975 and 1976 EEOC charges of\n\nracial discrimination in the promotional tests.                   In 1979, the\n\nComeaux action was consolidated into Kelley.             In 1983, there were\n\nunsuccessful settlement discussions between the Kelley plaintiffs\n\nand the City of Houston.\n\n      On April 16, 1992, the City of Houston refused to consent to\n\nthe intervention in Kelley of the Afro-American Police Officers\n\nLeague,   the      Houston   Police   Organization      of    Spanish   Speaking\n\nOfficers, and a group of African-American and Hispanic-American\n\npolice officers.        On April 17, 1992 the above groups moved for\n\n      1\n      The entry-level uniformed position within the Houston\nPolice Department is Police Officer. The first promotional\nposition is currently the rank of Sergeant. Police Officers with\ntwo years of service as Police Officers are allowed to compete\nfor the rank of Sergeant. The second promotional position is the\nrank of Lieutenant. Sergeants with two years of service as\nSergeants are allowed to compete for the rank of Lieutenant.\n\n                                        3\n\fleave to intervene in Kelley, alleging that they had been harmed by\n\nracially discriminatory promotional examinations for the ranks of\n\nSergeant and Lieutenant in the Houston Police Department, that the\n\ndisposition of Kelley could impair their interests, and that in\n\nlight of the passage of time, their interests were not being\n\nrepresented effectively in Kelley.           On the same day, the City of\n\nHouston moved to dismiss Kelley for want of prosecution.\n\n     A hearing was held on June 15, 1992, on the City of Houston's\n\nmotion to dismiss Kelley, and on the motion for leave to intervene.\n\nThe district court dismissed all claims in Kelley for want of\n\nprosecution except for test-promotion related claims after January\n\n1, 1982, the district court also denied the application for leave\n\nto intervene, ordered the applicants for intervention to file a new\n\nlawsuit to be transferred to the same court, directed that the\n\nremainder of Kelley be consolidated into the new lawsuit, and\n\nordered   that    the   new   plaintiff     class   consist   of   blacks    and\n\nhispanics.     This case was timely filed on August 19, 1992, after\n\nreceipt of Notices of Right to Sue issued by the Attorney General\n\nof the U.S.      The remnant of the Kelley case was then consolidated\n\ninto this action.\n\n     The plaintiffs in this action alleged that the challenged\n\nexaminations      had   the   effect   of    disproportionately     excluding\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanic-Americans from promotion to Sergeant\n\nfrom 1982 to date, and of disproportionately excluding African-\n\nAmericans from promotion to Lieutenant from 1982 to date.                   They\n\nfurther alleged that the examinations were not job-related or\n\n\n                                       4\n\fconsistent with business necessity.       The plaintiffs sued on their\n\nown behalf, on behalf of the African-American and Hispanic-American\n\nmembers of the Police Department who took a Sergeant examination\n\nfrom 1982 to date or who will compete for promotions to Sergeant in\n\nthe future.\n\n     Settlement    negotiations   began     in   earnest    between   the\n\nplaintiffs and defendant City of Houston in the fall of 1992.         The\n\nsettlement negotiations resulted in a proposed Consent Decree which\n\nwas submitted to the district court in final form on January 21,\n\n1993.    On February 3, 1993, the district court ordered that notice\n\nbe given to all current and former Class A Peace Officers of the\n\nCity of Houston whose rights and interests were affected by the\n\nConsent Decree tentatively approved by it on that date. The notice\n\nstated that a free copy of the Consent Decree could be acquired\n\nfrom the Legal Services Division of the Houston Police Department.\n\nThe notice also stated that March 12, 1993 was the deadline for\n\nfiling objections, and that a fairness hearing was scheduled for\n\nMarch 24, 1993.\n\n     Before the fairness hearing was conducted, representatives of\n\nthe following groups moved to intervene in the main case:         Houston\n\nPolice Patrolmen's Union2 (\"HPPU\");   the original named plaintiffs\n\nin the Comeaux action (McLoy Medlock, et al.);             Houston Police\n\n     2\n      The HPPU appellants are comprised of 109 individual Class A\nPeace Officers who held the position of police officer on\nFebruary 3, 1993, and 22 individual Class A Peace Officers who\nheld the position of Sergeant on that date. The HPPU appellants\nsought to intervene as class representatives of all similarly\nsituated Class A Peace Officers holding the rank of police\nofficer, Sergeant, or Lieutenant.\n\n                                  5\n\fOfficers Association3;          Female Police Officers;                  Asian Police\n\nOfficers;    and Houston Parks Police Officers.\n\n      On   March    17,     1993,    the    district       court   signed   an     order\n\ninforming    the     parties        that    a    hearing      on   the   motions     for\n\nintervention was scheduled for March 22, 1993. At the hearing, the\n\nHouston Airport Police Officers Association4 made an oral motion to\n\nintervene.      It later filed a written motion on March 23, 1993.\n\nAfter the hearing, the district court denied all of the motions for\n\nintervention, including the Airport Police Officers oral motion.\n\n      On March 24, 1993, the district court held the fairness\n\nhearing.    At the fairness hearing, the applicants for intervention\n\nwere allowed to:            (1) cross-examine witnesses, including the\n\nplaintiffs' statistical experts and the Chief of Police;                             (2)\n\nproffer evidence;         and (3) raise any objections to the Consent\n\nDecree.      The    district        court       again   denied     the   motions     for\n\nintervention, but allowed the applicants for intervention to file\n\nmotions to intervene for purposes of appeal.\n\n      On March 25, 1993, the district court certified the following\n\nclass:\n\n      a. All African-Americans who are employed, or at any time\n\nsince January 1, 1982 were employed, as Class A peace officers by\n\nthe   Houston      Police     Department         and    who   took   a    promotional\n\n      3\n      Doug Elder and Mark Clark, individually and as\nrepresentatives of the Houston Police Officers Association, and\nall Class A Police Officers, holding the rank of Police Officer\nand Sergeant of Police.\n      4\n      Terry Hughes, present and former Airport Police and Airport\nPolice Officers Association.\n\n                                            6\n\fexamination for the rank of Lieutenant or for the rank of Sergeant\n\nwhich was administered at any time from January 1, 1982 to the\n\npresent, and those who will compete for such promotions in the\n\nfuture;   and\n\n      b. All Hispanic-Americans who are employed, or at any time\n\nsince January 1, 1982 were employed, as Class A peace officers by\n\nthe   Houston   Police   Department    and   who   took    a   promotional\n\nexamination for the rank of Sergeant which was administered at any\n\ntime from January 1, 1982 to the present, and those who will\n\ncompete for such promotions in the future.\n\n      On March 25, 1993, the district court made one modification to\n\nthe Consent Decree and made the Consent Decree a final judgment.5\n\nUnder the terms of the Consent Decree, African-Americans and\n\nHispanic-Americans   who   took   an   examination   for   Sergeant   from\n\nJanuary 1, 1982 to date, and who passed at least one examination\n\nfor this rank, will receive a total of 96 remedial promotions;\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanic-Americans who took an examination\n\nfor Sergeant from January 1, 1982 to date, and who were promoted\n\nafter a discriminatorily long waiting period which delayed their\n\nability to compete for Lieutenant promotions will receive five\n\nremedial promotions to Lieutenant;      and African-Americans who took\n\n\n      5\n      The district court added the following sentence after the\nfirst sentence of paragraph 34.\n\n           A person who receives a remedial promotion will receive\n           compensatory retroactive seniority only back to the\n           date six months after the earliest test that person\n           took for the position, even if the promotion arises\n           from a disparity in an earlier test.\n\n                                   7\n\fan examination for Lieutenant from January 1, 1982 to date, and\n\npassed at least one examination for this rank will receive a total\n\nof five remedial promotions.        The named plaintiffs in this lawsuit\n\nwho meet   the      necessary   conditions      shall    have   priority.     The\n\nremedial promotions will be made over a five-year period.                     The\n\ndistrict court saw this as a concession of great magnitude by the\n\nplaintiffs.    The Consent Decree does not provide for any back pay.\n\n      The Consent Decree seeks, during the next ten years, to reduce\n\nthe   amount   of     adverse   impact       against    African-Americans     and\n\nHispanic-Americans taking exams for Sergeant and Lieutenant:                  (a)\n\nby striking \"racially biased items\"; and (b) by extending the life\n\nof promotional registers during this period of time to two years.\n\n      The Consent Decree supersedes some provisions of the Fire and\n\nPolice Civil Service Act and the Texas Local Government Code\n\nchapter 143, as amended.         Paragraph 55 provides a mechanism for\n\nstriking from the test those items which the City identifies as\n\nbiased items and which are not job-related.                     Paragraph 55(g)\n\nprovides that the promotional registers of test passers remain in\n\neffect for two years rather than one.           Finally, the need to perform\n\nstatistical analysis of responses and to examine test items for\n\nbias necessitates a short postponement of release of the test\n\nresults.   Paragraph 55(f) requires that an eligibility list for\n\npromotions be posted as soon as possible.\n\n      On May 20, 1993 the district court denied motions to intervene\n\nfor purposes of appeal by the following groups:                  Houston Police\n\nPatrolman's    Union    (\"HPPU\");     Houston      Airport      Police   Officers\n\n\n                                         8\n\fAssociation;   Female Police Officers;    Houston Police Officers\n\nAssociation;   and the original named plaintiffs in the Comeaux\n\naction (McLoy Medlock, et al.).\n\n     The HPPU appellants and the Houston Airport Police Officers\n\nAssociation appeal the district court's denial of their motions to\n\nintervene in the underlying case. The HPPU appellants, the Houston\n\nAirport Police Officers Association, the Houston Police Officers\n\nAssociation, and the original named plaintiffs in the Comeaux\n\naction appeal the district court's denial of their motions to\n\nintervene for purposes of appeal.     The HPPU appellants and the\n\noriginal named plaintiffs in the Comeaux action also appeal the\n\ndistrict court's approval of the Consent Decree.      Finally, the\n\nHouston Airport Police Officers Association appeals the district\n\ncourt's approval of paragraph 61 of the Consent Decree, entitled\n\n\"Reclassification of Peace Officers.\"6\n\n                         II. DISCUSSION\n\n1. Did the district court improperly deny the appellants' motions\n     to intervene in the underlying case?\n\n     The HPPU appellants and the Houston Airport Police Officers\n\nAssociation appeal the district court's denial of their motions to\n\nintervene in the underlying case.     They claim that the district\n\ncourt improperly denied their motions to intervene.   They claimed\n\nthe right to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      The Houston Parks Police Officers filed an amicus brief in\nsupport of the Airport Police Officers position.\n\n                                  9\n\f24(a)7 in part based upon the Civil Rights Act of 1991 provision\n\nwhich prohibits subsequent attacks on a Consent Decree entered in\n\na Title VII proceeding, through separate litigation unless the\n\nobjections and complaints are raised in the original proceeding.\n\n(42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n)(1)(B)).        They allege that by refusing to\n\npermit intervention, the district court substantially limited their\n\nability to challenge the Consent Decree.      They claim that they met\n\nall the requirements for intervention of right.\n\n     The HPPU appellants assert that the principal ground relied\n\nupon by the district court for denying their motion was timeliness.\n\nThey claim that their motion for intervention meets this court's\n\ntest for timeliness set out in Corley v. Jackson Police Dept., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448901\"><a href=\"/opinion/448901/charlie-corley-and-levaughn-carter-individually-etc-v-jackson-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1209 (5th Cir.1985) (citing Stallworth v.

They first argue that they met\n\nthe district court's deadline by filing their motion on March 12,\n\n1993.    They further argue that their motion was filed just 37 days\n\nafter the district court published notice of the terms of the\n\nConsent Decree and less than six months after the City of Houston\n\nfiled its answer denying all of the plaintiff's allegations.      They\n\nalso argue that although rumors of a proposed consent decree began\n\n\n     7\n      Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to\nintervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States\nconfers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the\napplicant claims an interest relating to the property or\ntransaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant\nis so situated that the disposition of the action may as a\npractical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to\nprotect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is\nadequately represented by existing parties. Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 24(a).\n\n                                  10\n\fto circulate in late December 1992, they were not able to obtain,\n\ndespite repeated efforts, any specific information regarding the\n\nConsent Decree until the February 3, 1993 notice was published.\n\nThey claim that it was the appellees' own conduct, in refusing to\n\ndisclose the terms of the decree sooner, that caused any delay.\n\nFinally, they argue that the appellees can hardly show prejudice\n\nfrom any delay, since the appellees were required to give notice of\n\nthe decree so that objections could be filed.\n\n     The Airport Police Officers Association (\"Airport Police\")\n\nalso claims that its application to intervene was timely.               The\n\nAirport Police argue that they sought to intervene within a few\n\nweeks after obtaining a copy of the proposed Consent Decree.            The\n\nAirport Police further argue that it is undisputed that they had no\n\npossible way of knowing prior to obtaining a copy of the proposed\n\nConsent Decree that it would contain a provision, such as paragraph\n\n61, singling them out and seemingly intended to deny them the very\n\ntransfer rights they won after lengthy litigation with the City of\n\nHouston.\n\n     The Airport Police also claim that they meet the test for\n\ntimeliness set out in Corley v. Jackson Police Dept., supra.            The\n\nAirport Police argue that the amount of time during which they\n\ncould have known of their interest in the case before seeking to\n\nintervene was minimal.      The Airport Police further argue that the\n\nappellees have not shown prejudice from any delay.            Finally, the\n\nAirport    Police   argue   that   their   prejudice   from    denial   of\n\nintervention is substantial.\n\n\n                                    11\n\f     The HPPU appellants and the Airport Police alternatively\n\nsought     permissive   intervention    under   Federal   Rule   of   Civil\n\nProcedure 24(b).\n\n         Denial of intervention of right is a question of law which we\n\nreview de novo.

The length of time during which the would-be\n     intervenor actually knew or reasonably should have known of\n     his interest in the case before he petitioned for leave to\n     intervene....\n\n          Factor 2. The extent of the prejudice that the existing\n     parties to the litigation may suffer as a result of the\n     would-be intervenor's failure to apply for intervention as\n     soon as he actually knew or reasonably should have known of\n     his interest in the case....\n\n          Factor 3. The extent of the prejudice that the would-be\n     intervenor may suffer if his petition for leave to intervene\n     is denied....\n\n          Factor 4. The existence of unusual circumstances\n     militating either for or against a determination that the\n     application is timely....\n\nId. at 264-66.    \"Stallworth is not an algorithm, but a framework\n\nfor analysis.\"   Corley v.

Kavanagh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420927\"><a href=\"/opinion/420927/john-lelsz-v-john-t-kavanagh-v-the-parent-association-for-the-retarded/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1043 (5th\n\nCir.1983)).\n\n      As the appellees point out, Chief of Police Nuchia met with\n\nthe presidents of the Houston Police Officers Association and the\n\nHouston Police Patrolmans Union on November 4, 1992.              At these\n\nmeetings, Chief of Police Nuchia informed the representatives of\n\nthose two groups that the City of Houston was undergoing settlement\n\ndiscussions with the plaintiffs.         Moreover, on December 16, 1992,\n\nChief of Police Nuchia issued a departmental circular to all police\n\nofficers   informing   them   of   the   potential   settlement   in   this\n\nlawsuit.\n\n                                    14\n\f        Factor 1.   The appellants erroneously contend that we should\n\nconsider February 3, 1993, the date the district court sent out\n\nformal notice, as the date from which to consider timeliness.         As\n\nStallworth makes clear, timeliness is measured from the point in\n\ntime at which the applicant for intervention actually knew or\n\nreasonably should have known of his interest in this case.         Based\n\non the fact that Chief of Police Nuchia notified the appellants not\n\nonly personally, but through the form of a departmental circular,\n\nthere is no question that the appellants actually knew or should\n\nhave known of their interest in this case in November or December\n\nof 1992.   Therefore, the appellants waited three and a half to four\n\nand a half months before applying for intervention.             Standing\n\nalone, this would probably not merit a finding of untimeliness,\n\nhowever, it certainly does not bode in the appellants' favor.\n\n     Factor 2.      The second factor relates to the prejudice to the\n\nexisting parties if the appellants' intervention is allowed.          In\n\nthis case, what is of particular importance is not so much the\n\nlength of the appellants' delay in filing for intervention, as what\n\noccurred during the period of that delay.        During this period of\n\ndelay, the proposed Consent Decree was put into final conceptual\n\nform.   The interests of the City of Houston, of both groups in the\n\nplaintiff class, and of other employees were considered and meshed\n\nto the greatest extent possible; the number of remedial promotions\n\nwas negotiated;       and the seniority complications caused by the\n\nplaintiffs'    concessions     to   the   City   of   Houston   and   to\n\nnon-class-members in stretching out the remedial promotions over\n\n\n                                    15\n\ffive years were worked out.            Therefore, as in Corley v. Jackson\n\nPolice Dept., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448901\"><a href=\"/opinion/448901/charlie-corley-and-levaughn-carter-individually-etc-v-jackson-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1210 (5th Cir.1985), the prejudice is\n\napparent.       \"A negotiated settlement of a difficult problem is put\n\nat risk, to the disadvantage of the named parties, the class, the\n\npolice department and the City.\"              Id.\n\n      Factor     3.    The    third    factor   contemplates         the    extent   of\n\nprejudice the applicant for intervention would suffer if his motion\n\nfor intervention is denied.           In this case, there is no prejudice to\n\nthe appellants.        At the fairness hearing, the appellants were\n\nallowed    to    present     testimony    and       argument    on   their     written\n\nobjections to the Consent Decree. The appellants were also allowed\n\nto   cross-examine     Chief    of    Police    Nuchia     and    the      plaintiffs'\n\nstatistical experts.          The district court considered all of the\n\nappellants' objections to the Consent Decree.                  The district court,\n\nin the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, answered each of\n\nthe appellants' objections and stated why it was not persuaded by\n\ntheir arguments.       In essence, the appellants were treated as if\n\nthey were parties to the lawsuit.                    Thus, the appellants have\n\nalready been afforded the substance of the benefits of intervention\n\nas to all their objections.           The appellants have had their day in\n\ncourt.\n\n      Factor 4.       There are no unusual circumstances militating\n\neither    for    or   against   a     determination      that    the       appellants'\n\napplications were timely.\n\n      From the perspective of the Stallworth analysis, we find that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the\n\n\n                                         16\n\fappellants' applications for intervention.   Therefore, the appeals\n\non the denial of intervention in the underlying case are dismissed.\n\n2.   Did the district court err in denying the appellants'\n      applications to intervene for purposes of appeal?\n\n      All of the appellants claim that the district court erred in\n\ndenying their motions to intervene for purposes of appeal.       The\n\nappellants claim that they meet all of requirements to intervene as\n\nof right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a).    They\n\nclaim that this court established four requirements which must be\n\nmet to demonstrate a right to intervene:     (1) the application to\n\nintervene must be timely;   (2) the applicant must have an interest\n\nrelating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the\n\naction;   (3) the applicant must be so situated that disposition of\n\nthe action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede, his\n\nability to protect that interest; and (4) the applicant's interest\n\nmust be inadequately represented by existing parties.

They argue that their\n\nmotions were filed by the district court's April 19, 1993 deadline.\n\n     The HPPU appellants also claim that the district court, by\n\nrefusing to permit intervention, substantially limited the HPPU\n\nappellants' ability to challenge the Consent Decree.     They argue\n\nthat because the terms of the Consent Decree authorize the City of\n\nHouston to continue to impermissibly discriminate against them, and\n\n                                 17\n\fbecause the Consent Decree will remain in effect for ten years\n\nunder the district court's jurisdiction, the district court's\n\nrefusal to allow intervention has effectively denied them their\n\nright to participate in this and future proceedings affecting their\n\npromotional opportunities.\n\n     The Airport Police argue, with regard to the second factor of\n\nthe New Orleans Public Service test, that if the City of Houston\n\ncomplies with paragraph 61 of the Consent Decree, they will be\n\nconfined to the airport and will be unable to transfer elsewhere in\n\nthe City for the next ten years of their careers.      The Airport\n\nPolice argue that their career paths and promotional opportunities\n\nwill be sharply curtailed. The Airport Police conclude, therefore,\n\nthat their interest in this transaction is \"legally protectable.\"\n\n     The Airport Police further argue that if the City complies\n\nwith paragraph 61, the City will violate the state court decree\n\nwhich directs the City to afford each Airport Officer the same\n\ntransfer rights as are afforded to Officers of corresponding rank\n\nin the Patrol Divisions of the Houston Police Department.\n\n     The original plaintiffs in the Comeaux action argue, in\n\nreference to the third factor, that the Consent Decree impairs or\n\nimpedes their ability to protect their interests.   They argue that\n\ntheir claims for years prior to 1982 were literally wiped out.\n\nThey concede that these claims were dismissed in 1992.      However,\n\nthey claim that this was in error and that they should have been\n\nafforded relief in the Consent Decree.   With regard to the fourth\n\nfactor, they claim that the plaintiffs had a clear interest in\n\n\n                                18\n\fdismissing the pre-1982 claims, and that the City had an interest\n\nin dismissing those claims to avoid complying with any benefits or\n\nback pay awards.\n\n       The Houston Police Officers Association argues with regard to\n\nthe fourth factor, that their interests in the underlying case were\n\nnot the same and to a large extent, diametrically opposite from\n\nthose    of     the   plaintiffs      and       defendant   City       of     Houston.\n\nSpecifically, the Consent Decree was the end result of settlement\n\nnegotiations       between    the   plaintiffs     and   the    City       only.    The\n\ninterests of the Houston Police Officers Association was in no way\n\nfactored into the settlement agreement.               The Association further\n\nargues that the remedial promotions will cause persons with lower\n\nscores to be promoted over individuals who performed better on the\n\npromotional exams.\n\n       All    of   the    appellants       alternatively       sought       permissive\n\nintervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b).                           The\n\nappellants argue that since their claims all arose out of the\n\nproposed Consent Decree, there were common questions of law and\n\nfact.\n\n       As stated earlier, denial of intervention of right is a\n\nquestion of law which we review de novo.             Ceres Gulf v. Cooper, 957\n\nF.2d    at    1202.      In   order   to    determine    whether       a    party   has\n\ndemonstrated a right to intervene, we examine the four requirements\n\nset out in New Orleans Public Service, 732 F.2d at 463.\n\n       First, all of the appellants' motions to intervene were timely\n\nfiled.       The appellants filed their motions before the district\n\n\n                                           19\n\fcourt's deadline on filing the motions to intervene for purposes of\n\nappeal.\n\n        With regard to the second requirement, the critical question\n\nis what type of interest the appellants have in the promotional\n\nsystem.    To demonstrate an interest in the transaction sufficient\n\nto support intervention as of right, an applicant \"must demonstrate\n\na \"direct, substantial and legally protectable' interest in the\n\nproperty or transaction that is the subject of the suit.\"                 League\n\nof United Latin American Citizens v. Clements, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187\n\n(5th Cir.1989) (quoting New Orleans Public Service, 732 F.2d at\n\n463).     The   appellants'    interest      is   in    making   sure   that   the\n\npromotional system is not manipulated in such a manner, that it\n\ndiscriminates against them. This interest is sufficient to support\n\nintervention as of right.\n\n     To meet the third requirement, the applicant must be so\n\nsituated that disposition of the action may, as a practical matter,\n\nimpair or impede, his ability to protect that interest.                        New\n\nOrleans Public Service, 732 F.2d at 463.               Although, the appellants\n\nwere treated as if they were parties in the underlying action, the\n\ndistrict court     did   not   allow   the    appellants      to   benefit     from\n\nappellate review of the Consent Decree.            The appellants were able\n\nto protect their interests below because they were able to bring\n\nforth all of their objections and arguments.               However, part of the\n\nability to protect their interests is the ability to subjugate the\n\ndistrict court's disposition of their case to appellate scrutiny.\n\nWe stated earlier that the appellants have had their day in court.\n\n\n                                       20\n\fConcomitant with having one's day in court is appellate review of\n\nthat day.\n\n     The fourth requirement inquires whether the applicant for\n\nintervention's      interest   is   adequately    represented      by   existing\n\nparties.    Id.    The appellants' interests were adequately protected\n\nin the district court because they were given the opportunity to\n\nrepresent their own interests.          However, when the district court\n\ndenied their applications for intervention for purposes of appeal,\n\nnone of the existing parties adequately represented the appellants'\n\ninterests.    This is evidenced by the fact that neither the City of\n\nHouston nor the plaintiffs sought appellate review of the Consent\n\nDecree.     Those two parties were content with their settlement,\n\nwhile the appellants obviously were not.\n\n     We find that the appellants meet all of the requirements to\n\nintervene as of right for purposes of appeal.                      Thus, it is\n\nunnecessary to determine whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying permissive intervention.\n\n     We, therefore, reverse the district court's denial of the\n\nappellants' motions to intervene for purposes of appeal.\n\n     Having found that the district court erred in this manner, we\n\nnow turn to the appellants' substantive arguments.\n\n3. Did the district court err in approving the Consent Decree?\n\n     The    HPPU   appellants   argue      that   this   circuit    requires   a\n\ndistrict court to become more involved in the settlement process\n\nwhen it is called upon to approve a Title VII consent decree.               They\n\nargue that the district court failed to review the terms of the\n\n\n                                      21\n\fConsent Decree and the evidence in support of it with sufficient\n\nscrutiny.    They also argue that the Eleventh Circuit has held that\n\nthe operative law for judging a consent decree is the same as that\n\nfor    voluntary   affirmative    acts.

They further argue that the district court should have\n\nused a strict scrutiny standard because the Consent Decree on its\n\nface    provides   for   both    \"racial   quotas\"    and   future    racial\n\nclassifications.

The only evidence of\n\npast   discrimination       is   the    questionable       statistical    analysis\n\nperformed by plaintiffs' counsel. They also contend that there was\n\nno   attempt     by   the   district     court    to     determine   whether    the\n\npromotional exams measured performance of skills necessary for the\n\njobs of Sergeant and Lieutenant of police within the Houston Police\n\nDepartment.      They further contend that the City did not make any\n\nattempt to validate the contents of the exams.\n\n       The HPPU appellants argue that the law draws a distinction\n\nbetween relief that is intended to remedy the effect of past\n\ndiscrimination and relief which is designed to compensate an\n\nindividual who has been the specific victim of past discrimination.\n\nSee Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v.

They\n\nalso contend that the Consent Decree contains several provisions\n\nwhich violate Title VII.       For example, the Consent Decree divests\n\nthem of vested promotional and seniority rights under a valid merit\n\nbased promotional testing procedure.        Paragraph 55 of the Consent\n\nDecree    authorizes    the    Police    Department   to    adjust   future\n\npromotional test scores on the basis of race.         The Consent Decree\n\nfurther provides for readjustment to scores in the event the \"log\n\nlinear\" analysis results in failing an officer who otherwise passed\n\nthe exam.\n\n     Finally, the HPPU appellants argue that the district court's\n\nrefusal to allow them, and others, to present the testimony they\n\nhad prepared to demonstrate the questionable validity of the\n\nConsent Decree, deprived them of a fair and equal opportunity to\n\nprotect their rights under the law.        Thus, their equal protection\n\nand due process rights were impaired.\n\n     The Airport Police Officers claim that the district court\n\nerred in approving paragraph 61 of the Consent Decree.                 They\n\ncontend that the legitimate purposes of the Consent Decree are to\n\n\n                                    24\n\fcure the ethnic bias of the promotional exams and to improve the\n\nracial mix of the Sergeant and Lieutenant ranks of the Police\n\nDepartment.   Paragraph 61 purports to further these goals by\n\ntotally excluding them from even taking the tests. They argue that\n\nexcluding them from taking the tests will not make the tests less\n\nbiased. Likewise, their exclusion has no relationship to improving\n\nthe racial mix of the Sergeant and Lieutenant ranks.\n\n     The original Comeaux plaintiffs argue that the Consent Decree\n\nis woefully unjust, unfair, unreasonable and inadequate. Under the\n\nConsent Decree some of the class members do not receive relief,\n\nincluding monetary relief;    the relief for the appellee-plaintiffs\n\nis significantly greater than their relief;           and some members of\n\nthe certified class are treated differently than other class\n\nmembers.   They also argue that the wrongful dismissal of their\n\nclaims precluded them from being included in the negotiations\n\nleading to the Consent Decree.     They further argue that even where\n\nthere is a clear record of delay, the sanction of dismissal is\n\njustified only where a lesser sanction would not suffice.\n\n     Under the terms of the Consent Decree, African-Americans and\n\nHispanic-Americans   who   took   an    examination   for   Sergeant   from\n\nJanuary 1, 1982 to date, and who passed at least one examination\n\nfor this rank, will receive a total of 96 remedial promotions.\n\nSince African-Americans suffered 64.67 of the shortfall in Sergeant\n\npromotions, they will receive 64.67 of the remedial promotions to\n\nSergeant, for a total of 62 remedial promotions to Sergeant.\n\nHispanic-Americans suffered 35.47 of the shortfall in Sergeant\n\n\n                                   25\n\fpromotions,     hence,     they    will       receive   35.47    of     the    remedial\n\npromotions to Sergeant, for a total of 34 for remedial promotions\n\nto Sergeant.     African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans who took an\n\nexamination for Sergeant from January 1, 1982 to date, and who were\n\npromoted after a discriminatorily long waiting period which delayed\n\ntheir ability to compete for Lieutenant promotions will receive\n\nfive remedial promotions to Lieutenant.                  African-Americans will\n\nreceive three of those promotions and Hispanic-Americans will\n\nreceive two of those promotions.                 Finally, African-Americans who\n\ntook an examination for Lieutenant from January 1, 1982 to date,\n\nand who passed at least one examination for this rank will receive\n\na total of five remedial promotions.\n\n     The Consent Decree seeks, during the next ten years, to reduce\n\nthe amount of adverse impact against black and hispanic police\n\nofficers taking the promotional exams by:                     (a) striking items\n\nbiased against any race;                and (b) extending the life of the\n\npromotional registers during this period to two years.\n\n         The appellants attack the Consent Decree's validity under\n\nTitle VII      and   the   Equal       Protection    Clause     of    the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.      Although the obligations of a public employer under\n\nTitle    VII   are   similar      to    its     obligations     under    the    Federal\n\nConstitution, they are not the same.9               We, therefore, examine each\n\n     9\n         Justice Scalia's dissent maintains that the obligations of\n             a public employer under Title VII must be identical to\n             its obligations under the Constitution, and that a\n             public employer's adoption of an affirmative action\n             plan therefore should be governed by Wygant.... \"Title\n             VII, by contrast, was enacted pursuant to the commerce\n             power to regulate purely private decision making and\n\n                                           26\n\fof the appellants' arguments in turn.\n\n Validity under Title VII\n\n      \"In Title VII litigation, this Court had held that the\n\ndistrict court is entitled to a substantial measure of discretion\n\nin dealing with consent decrees, and that as a result \"on appeal,\n\nour duty is to ascertain whether or not the trial judge clearly\n\nabused his discretion....' \"   Williams v.

As a practical matter, of course, an\n     employer will generally seek to avoid a charge of pretext by\n\n\n          was not intended to incorporate and particularize the\n          commands of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\"\n          United Steelworkers of America v.

The District Court found that no objector\n\npresented any credible evidence that any factor other than the\n\nchallenged tests, accounted for any meaningful part of the racial\n\ndisparities in the promotion rates between the different racial\n\ngroups.\n\n     The relevant labor market that was used in this case was the\n\nnumber    of   minority    police   officers     who   took    the    promotional\n\nexaminations.       Undoubtedly,       a    comparison     was   made    to    the\n\nappropriate labor market.11 We find that the plaintiffs established\n\na manifest imbalance in promotion rates for black and hispanic\n\nofficers, and that they brought this to the City of Houston's\n\nattention.\n\n                                       B.\n\n     Having     found     that   the   Consent    Decree      meets    the    first\n\nrequirement of the Johnson analysis, we now examine whether the\n\nConsent Decree unnecessarily trammels the rights of nonminorities\n\nor creates an absolute bar to their advancement.\n\n\n     11\n      Johnson states that where a job requires special training,\nthe comparison should be with those in the labor force who\npossess the relevant qualifications.

In such a\n      case, the trial court must make a factual determination that\n      the employer had a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion\n      that remedial action was necessary.      The ultimate burden\n\n                                     33\n\f      remains    with   the    employees   to    demonstrate the\n      unconstitutionality of an affirmative-action program.  But\n      unless such a determination is made, an appellate court\n      reviewing a challenge by nonminority employees to remedial\n      action cannot determine whether the race-based action is\n      justified as a remedy for prior discrimination.\n\nId. at 277-78, 106 S.Ct. at 1849.\n\n      In this case the district court specifically found that:\n\n      Plaintiffs have proven the disparate impact of the challenged\n      examinations.   Their expert testimony and other evidence\n      created substantial doubt as to the job-relatedness of the\n      challenged tests.    It is not necessary for the Court to\n      resolve the question whether the challenged examinations were\n      job-related. Plaintiffs have shown a sufficiently firm basis\n      for the relief provided in the proposed Consent Decree.\n\n       As stated in the section discussing the validity of the\n\nConsent Decree in Title VII, the plaintiffs provided detailed\n\nstatistics on the promotion rates of nonminorities, blacks and\n\nhispanics.   The plaintiffs also identified numerous questions on\n\nthe examinations which they alleged were extremely difficult to\n\ndefend as job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nClearly, the district court had ample evidence from which to\n\nconclude that the plaintiffs had proven disparate impact and that\n\nthe City of Houston had justifiably concluded that it would be\n\ndifficult to defend the job-relatedness of the questions on the\n\npromotional exams.         More importantly, the City of Houston had a\n\nstrong basis in evidence to conclude that remedial action was\n\nnecessary.\n\n      Having found that the Consent Decree's racial classifications\n\nare   justified   by   a    compelling    governmental   interest,   namely\n\nremedying prior discrimination, we must now decide whether the\n\nConsent Decree is narrowly tailored to the achievement of that\n\n                                     34\n\fgoal.\n\n        The Supreme Court has focused on several factors in analyzing\n\nrace-conscious remedial measures: the necessity for the relief and\n\nthe efficacy of alternative remedies; the flexibility and duration\n\nof the relief, including the availability of waiver provisions;\n\nthe relationship of the numerical goals to the relevant labor\n\nmarket;     and the impact of the relief on the rights of third\n\nparties.

Id.    The Consent Decree\n\nwas entered into in this case to remedy past discrimination and to\n\nalleviate the adverse impact of the promotional exams in the\n\nfuture.      The   remedial     promotions     are   only    directed      to   those\n\npositions where the discrimination occurred.                     Moreover, those\n\npromotions     are    only      for   those    who    most       likely     suffered\n\ndiscrimination       and   in    direct    proportion       to    the     amount   of\n\ndiscrimination they suffered.          As the district court pointed out,\n\nAsians and women were not allowed to become part of the plaintiff\n\nclass because they could not show that they were discriminated\n\nagainst in the promotional exams.\n\n The Flexibility and Duration of the Relief\n\n\n                                          35\n\f     To determine whether the Consent Decree meets the narrow\n\ntailoring    requirement,    consideration     of     the    flexibility     and\n\nduration of its proposed relief, must be undertaken.\n\n     The Consent Decree proposes remedial promotions which will be\n\nstretched over a five year period, the elimination of questions\n\nbiased against any race over a ten year period, and the extension\n\nof promotional lists from one to two years.           The relief which the\n\nConsent Decree proposes does not continue indefinitely. Rather, it\n\nis of a temporary nature.           The district court found that the\n\nplaintiffs' agreement to have the remedial promotions phased in\n\nover five years was a concession of great magnitude.             The remedial\n\npromotions will be phased in over a great period of time solely to\n\nmake sure that the disruption within the police department is\n\nminimized.     The   fact   that   racially   biased    questions     will   be\n\neliminated from exams for ten years does not mar the Consent\n\nDecree,   because    questions     biased   against    all    races   will   be\n\neliminated. Thus, all police officers will benefit. Likewise, the\n\nextension of the promotional lists to two years will help the\n\npromotional opportunities of all police officers.\n\n     With regard to flexibility, the Consent Decree does not impose\n\nrigid quotas against the police department.             The Consent Decree\n\nrequires only the remedial promotion of qualified blacks and\n\nhispanics. Only members of the plaintiff class who have passed the\n\nappropriate promotional exam are eligible for promotion.                     See\n\nUnited States v.

Hence, the police department is never required to\n\npromote an unqualified minority in preference of a qualified\n\nnonminority.\n\n     More importantly, the Consent Decree is not designed to\n\nmaintain any particular racial balance.           The police department is\n\nnot required to increase the number of minority promotions simply\n\nbecause it happens to promote more nonminorities in the future.\n\n Numerical Goals\n\n     Another method of determining whether the proposed relief is\n\nnarrowly tailored, is to examine the relationship of the numerical\n\ngoals to the relevant labor market.           This is one of the strengths\n\nof the Consent Decree.       The number of remedial promotions exactly\n\nmatches the number of promotions lost by black and hispanic police\n\nofficers.      For   example,    on   the    September   23,   1982    Sergeant\n\nexamination, the statistical analysis showed that hispanics did not\n\nsuffer any adverse impact.         Consequently, the hispanics were not\n\ngiven any remedial promotions based on this exam.\n\n     As previously stated, the relevant labor market that was used\n\nin this case was the number of minority police officers who took\n\nthe promotional examinations.         Unlike, other race-conscious plans\n\nwhich   have   not    passed     constitutional     muster     because      they\n\ninappropriately compare the number of minorities in a specific\n\nposition, regardless of the level of skill required for that\n\n\n                                      37\n\fposition, with the number of minorities in the general labor force,\n\nthe Consent Decree makes its comparison solely with the number of\n\nminorities in the police department.         Clearly, the number of\n\nminority police officers who took the exam is the relevant labor\n\nmarket.13    Once the remedial promotions are made, the promotional\n\nrelief ends, regardless of the percentage of blacks and hispanics\n\nin the Sergeant and Lieutenant ranks.\n\n Impact upon Third Parties\n\n          The impact upon third parties is a major aspect of this\n\nConsent Decree.     A state or local government may constitutionally\n\nrequire innocent nonminorities to share the burden of remedying the\n\neffects of past identified discrimination.

The Consent Decree does not impose an absolute bar\n\nto the promotion of nonminorities.      See Paradise, 480 U.S. at 184,\n\n107 S.Ct. at 1073.     More importantly, all the remedial promotions\n\nwill be to newly created positions by the City of Houston.      In no\n\nway are the nonminorities hurt by this Consent Decree.            The\n\nnonminorities will be able to compete for exactly the same number\n\nof promotions that would exist in the absence of the Consent\n\nDecree.     Their expectations and promotional opportunities are left\n\nfully intact.\n\n\n     13\n      Again, we do not reach the issue of whether the number of\nminorities who took the exam is the only relevant labor market.\n\n                                   38\n\f      As the district court stated in its opinion on denial of\n\nintervention for appeal:\n\n           The remedial promotions will be to positions that the\n      city would not have otherwise created, leaving the non-class\n      officers the same number of promotions that they would have\n      had in the absence of the decree.      The movants could have\n      claimed, but did not, that they should be allowed to compete\n      as equals for every position the city creates whether it would\n      have otherwise under current city policy. The city could not\n      create an additional set of officer positions and gratuitously\n      reserve them for blacks, women, or East Europeans.         The\n      positions created by the consent decree and the partial\n      reservation are predicated on an established history of abuse,\n      not on a claim to quotas or sensitivity to ethnicity in gross.\n\n      As to the HPPU appellants' fears that people who scored lower\n\non the promotional exams will be promoted before their members with\n\nhigher scores:\n\n      Their objections reflect confusion, at best.   All of the\n      examinations will be re-scored.    The union members must\n      compete fairly for promotions;  they do not have a vested\n      interest in continuing to receive the benefits of past\n      discrimination.\n\n      The Airport police also cannot claim that the Consent Decree\n\nharms their ability to be considered Class A officers or to be\n\nmerged with the Class A officers of the Houston Police Department.\n\nThe   District     Court   of   Harris    County,    Texas   has   specifically\n\nordered:\n\n      IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED ADJUDGED AND DECREED that members of\n      the Houston Police Department Specialized Police Division,\n      Park Police, of the City of Houston, Texas be denied entry\n      into the uniformed and Detective Class, (Class \"A\") of the\n      Houston    Police    Department   except    by    application,\n      qualification, and entry at an entry level position.\n\n      Based   on    the    factors   outlined   by    the    Supreme   Court   in\n\nParadise, we find that the Consent Decree is narrowly tailored.\n\n      Therefore, we conclude that the Consent Decree is valid under\n\n\n                                         39\n\fthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                         C.\n\n       Finally, we must answer the appellants objections which did\n\nnot fall under traditional Title VII or Equal Protection Clause\n\nanalysis.     The Consent Decree's use of \"log-linear\" analysis to\n\neliminate racially biased test items does not violate § 703(l ) of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by § 106 of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991.         That section was intended to prevent the\n\nmanipulation of test scores on valid employment-related tests.\n\nThis provision is not applicable to the promotional tests at issue,\n\nbecause there is substantial doubt as to their job-relatedness.\n\n      In   response    to   the    Comeaux     appellants'    objections,    the\n\ndistrict court found that it would be unreasonable to delay or\n\ncancel the proposed relief for persons who actively sought to press\n\ntheir rights, in favor of persons who did not press their rights.\n\nAs   the   appellees   point      out,   the   Comeaux   appellants   have   not\n\nproffered    any   evidence    that      the   failure   of   prosecution    was\n\nexclusively the fault of their counsel.\n\n       The district court aptly stated that there can be little\n\ndoubt that the federal courts have the power to enter an order\n\noverriding provisions of State or local law, where necessary, to\n\nprovide an appropriate remedy in a settlement of a case in which\n\nthe plaintiffs are alleging a violation of Federal law.               However,\n\nthe district court must take care that the provisions of State or\n\nlocal law are overridden only insofar as it is reasonable and\n\nappropriate to the remedy in question.

CONCLUSION\n\n     We find that the district court appropriately denied the\n\nappellants' motions to intervene in the underlying case on the\n\nbasis of untimeliness.   Accordingly, we DISMISS those appeals.   We\n\nREVERSE the district court's denial of the appellants' motions to\n\nintervene for purposes of appeal.     Since we reach the appellants'\n\narguments as to the validity of the Consent Decree, and AFFIRM the\n\ndistrict court's approval of the Consent Decree, the district\n\ncourt's denial of the motions for purposes of appeal is harmless\n\nerror.    Furthermore, since we have affirmed the district court in\n\nthe entering of the Consent Decree and have held that the district\n\ncourt's denial of the motions to intervene for purposes of appeal\n\nis harmless error, the court below is AFFIRMED in all respects.14,15\n\n     14\n      The dissent accused the author of \"extrapolation\" of the\nrecord to get to the finding that the district court denied the\nintervention on the ground of untimeliness. All one has to do is\nread the briefs of the appellants who tried to intervene and they\nall admitted that their intervention was denied on grounds of\nuntimeliness and they argued as to why their motions to intervene\nwere not untimely. If the dissent wants to be blind to what the\n\n                                 41\n\f     PARKER, Circuit Judge, specially concurring,\n\n     While concurring with the majority opinion, I write separately\n\nto address some of the concerns expressed in the dissent.\n\n     The dissent professes surprise that the City would buy into\n\nthe fundamental premises of the Plaintiffs' case and is deeply\n\ntroubled by what the dissent characterizes as a decision of the\n\nCity to use a consent decree from the federal court as a crutch to\n\nachieve what it could not accomplish as a matter of its own\n\nindependent decision making.   Whether we, as judges, favor these\n\ntypes of controversies or not, whether we might have made different\n\ndecisions if we had been a party, whether or not we lament the\n\npolitical process that on occasion produces consent decrees in\n\ncivil rights cases is of no consequence.     The fact is that the\n\nparties decided to settle this case.\n\n\nappellants say on the issue, I have no control over that.\n     15\n      I wish to thank my co-panelist Judge Parker for his\nconcurring opinion and coming to the defense of the opinion which\nhe says he agrees with. I specially thank him for discussing the\nquestion of jurisdiction which the dissent seems to think we did\nnot have in this case.\n\n          I have never had any question in my mind about the\n     court having jurisdiction. The appellant police\n     organizations in this case, while not allowed to intervene,\n     participated in the \"fairness hearing\" provided by the 1991\n     amendments to the Civil Rights Act as objectors to the\n     Consent Decree. The statute that allowed them to appear as\n     objectors made them parties and, after the \"fairness\n     hearing\", if they were not satisfied with what the court had\n     done with the Consent Decree they had a perfect right to\n     appeal. They did not have to ask permission from anyone.\n     The statute made them parties. Appeal they did and we heard\n     their objections to the Consent Decree, but affirmed the\n     court below because the court had done the right thing in\n     approving the Consent Decree entered into between the class\n     and the City of Houston.\n\n                                42\n\f     This nineteen year old litigation was settled in a manner that\n\nprovided a limited and narrowly tailored remedy that responded to\n\nthe wrongs associated with the testing provisions for advancement\n\nwithin the Houston Police Department.           The testing provisions\n\neffectively    limited   advancement     opportunities   for    blacks   and\n\nhispanics.      The   consent   decree    provides   remedial    positions\n\navailable to the group of officers adversely affected by the old\n\ntesting procedures.      The narrowness of the settlement is further\n\nevidenced by the fact that the consent decree takes no jobs away\n\nfrom non-class members and imposes no duties or responsibilities on\n\nthem.   The consent decree does exclude non-class members from\n\ncompetition for 106 remedial promotions with remedial seniority,\n\nbut the remedial promotions will not prevent non-class members from\n\nbeing promoted on regular promotion schedules, and there will be no\n\ndemotions or layoffs in order to make remedial promotions possible.\n\nBased on the total aggregate promotions to sergeant and lieutenant\n\nfrom 1982-91, remedial promotions would only account for about 287\n\nof the total promotions available over the five year period of\n\nremedial promotions, or 147 of the total promotions over the life\n\nof the consent decree.     While these remedial promotions do have a\n\nlimited effect on promotional opportunities of non-class members,\n\nit is difficult to imagine any remedial scheme that would not have\n\nsome effect.     The leveling of the playing field for black and\n\nhispanic officers does not unduly trammel the interests of officers\n\nwho are not members of the plaintiff class.\n\n     Our role is not to delve into the propriety of the decisions\n\n\n                                   43\n\fthat resulted in the settlement but to address the legal issues\n\npresented     in   this   appeal.     The   issues   in    this    case     are\n\nstraightforward.     They are (1) whether there is some procedural or\n\njurisdictional impediment to our reaching the merits, and, if not\n\n(2) whether the district court erred in approving the consent\n\ndecree.\n\n     It is entirely proper for this Court to consider the merits of\n\nthe consent decree once it finds that a motion to intervene was\n\nimproperly denied. Under the \"anomalous rule\" governing the appeal\n\nof orders denying intervention in this Circuit, the Court has\n\nprovisional jurisdiction to determine whether the district court\n\nerroneously    concluded    that    Appellants   were     not    entitled    to\n\nintervene, and if it determines that the district court properly\n\ndenied intervention, appellate jurisdiction evaporates and the case\n\nis dismissed;      however, if the district court was mistaken, the\n\nappellate court retains jurisdiction and reverses.

In that case, the State of New\n      York filed action seeking declaratory judgment that its\n      literacy tests had not been used for the purpose or with the\n      effect of denying or abridging the right to vote based on\n      race or color. In NAACP, the appellants filed their motions\n      to intervene just four days after the United States filed\n      its consent to the entry of declaratory and seventeen days\n      after learning of the pendency of the action. A three judge\n      panel denied NAACP's motion to intervene and granted summary\n      judgment to State of New York.

The\n\ndistrict court's denial of Appellants' motions to intervene for the\n\npurpose    of    appeal     cannot   be     sustained     on   the    grounds   of\n\nuntimeliness. First, as noted in the majority opinion, the motions\n\nwere filed at the invitation of the district court within the time\n\nframe for such motions set up by the district court.                      Second,\n\nalthough the initial motions to intervene were untimely under\n\nStallworth, the Stallworth analysis does not lead to the same\n\nresult with respect to the denial of the motions to intervene for\n\nappeal.\n\n     The second Stallworth factor requires that we consider the\n\nprejudice to existing parties if the appellants intervention is\n\nallowed.     See Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 265.              In the context of a\n\nRule 24(a) intervention as of right, the only prejudice that we\n\nconsider is that prejudice caused by a would-be intervenor's delay\n\n\n\n\n     of intervention as untimely despite the early stage of the\n     litigation.\n\n          In the instant case, the underlying litigation had been\n     going on for almost twenty years. The earliest of the\n     motions to intervene were filed three months after Chief\n     Nuchia issued a departmental circular to all police officers\n     informing them of the potential settlement of the lawsuit\n     and 37 days after the district court published notice of the\n     terms of the consent decree. Under all the circumstances of\n     this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion\n     in denying Appellants' initial motions to intervene as\n     untimely.\n\n                                          46\n\fin filing its motion to intervene.2     Since Appellants moved to\n\nintervene for the purpose of appeal only and did not raise any\n\nissues that were not presented to the district court, it does not\n\nappear that the delay in filing their motions could have prejudiced\n\nthe existing parties.

The existing parties would have been\n\n     2\n      The dissent argues that the second Stallworth factor,\nprejudice to the existing parties, has no significant application\nin the case of a Rule 24(a) intervention. This flies in the face\nof the clear language of Stallworth. Stallworth does not say\nthat prejudice to the parties is not a factor in a Rule 24(a)\nintervention, it says that, in the case of a Rule 24(a)\nintervention, prejudice other than that caused by the delay is\nnot considered.\n\n          The dissent paraphrases a statement in Stallworth that\n     \"to take any prejudice that the existing parties may incur\n     if intervention is allowed into account under the rubric of\n     timeliness would be to rewrite Rule 24 by creating an\n     additional prerequisite to intervention as of right.\"\n     Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 265. The dissent completely changes\n     the meaning of this sentence by omitting the emphasis on\n     \"any.' See Dissent at 694. The dissent ignores the\n     sentence immediately preceding sentence which says that \"it\n     is apparent that prejudice to the existing parties other\n     than that caused by the would-be intervenor's failure to act\n     promptly was not a factor meant to be considered where\n     intervention was sought under section (a).\" Stallworth, 558\n     F.2d at 265.\n\n          The dissent's complaint that the majority fails to\n     distinguish between permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)\n     and intervention as of right under Rule 24(a) with respect\n     to the application of this factor completely ignores the\n     fact that the majority only considered prejudice resulting\n     from the Appellants' delay in filing their motions to\n     intervene.\n\n                                47\n\fin exactly the same situation if Appellants had filed their motions\n\nto intervene for appeal only on the day this case was filed.\n\n     Perhaps more importantly, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n) creates an\n\n\"unusual circumstance\" under the fourth factor of the Stallworth\n\nanalysis.   Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n), if Appellants were denied\n\nentirely the right to intervene in this action, they would be\n\nprecluded from raising any challenge to the consent decree.    The\n\nfact that the district court initially denied Appellants motions to\n\nintervene without prejudice to refiling for the purpose of appeal\n\nremoved the effect of 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(n) from the \"unusual\n\ncircumstances\" in factor four of the Stallworth test.

While this too is true as far as it goes, it\n     ignores the fact that 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(n)(2)(A) explicitly\n     provides that those amendments shall not be construed to\n     alter the standards for intervention under Rule 24.

Neither intervenors nor objectors are entitled to hold\n\nconsent decrees hostage and require a full-blown trial in lieu of\n\na fairness hearing.    The issue here is how much process appellants\n\nwere due.     Even if appellants had been designated as intervenors,\n\n\n                                  50\n\fthey still got the process they were due.\n\n     The district court afforded Appellants de facto intervenor\n\nstatus   at   the    fairness     hearing      and    found   their   objections\n\nunconvincing.       Appellants have not shown that the district court\n\nwas wrong or that they would have been any more convincing at the\n\nfairness hearing if they had been designated intervenors rather\n\nthan objectors.      Appellants suffered no prejudice by the district\n\ncourt's failure to designate them intervenors apart from denying\n\nthem their right of appeal on the merits.               We have remedied that\n\nerror.\n\n     For the reasons set out in the majority opinion and in this\n\nspecial concurrence,       I    agree   with    the    majority   that   we    have\n\njurisdiction to review the merits of Appellants' claims.                      After\n\nconducting such a review, I agree that any error in denying\n\nAppellants' motions to intervene was harmless.                Although I agree\n\nthat the district court acted within its discretion in denying\n\nAppellants' initial motions to intervene, I do not believe that\n\nthat determination is critical to the outcome of this case;               if the\n\ninitial motions to intervene were improperly denied, I would reach\n\nthe same result.\n\n     DeMOSS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n     With some of the trepidation that I suspect was in the mind of\n\nDavid when he stepped forward to face Goliath, I write to express\n\nmy dissent and disagreement with the analysis and conclusions\n\nreached by my distinguished colleagues in the foregoing opinion.\n\n     I disagree with the panel majority's extrapolation from the\n\n\n                                        51\n\frecord that the district judge denied the motions for intervention\n\nbecause of \"untimeliness.\"          In my view, if the district judge\n\narticulated    any   reason   for    his    denial   of    the   motions   for\n\nintervention, it was because he felt that the right to object at\n\nthe fairness hearing was all he was obligated to afford to the\n\nwould-be intervenors.\n\n     I dissent and disagree with the majority panel conclusion that\n\nthe district judge's denial of the motion for intervention because\n\nof \"untimeliness\" was not clearly erroneous.              In my view, such a\n\nruling is clearly inconsistent with and not supported by any prior\n\ncase law nor by an appropriate construction of the newly adopted\n\namendment to the Civil Rights Act which speaks to this question.\n\n     I dissent and disagree with the panel majority's conclusion\n\nthat denial of a motion to intervene \"for appeal only\" is a final\n\njudgment which vests this court with appellate jurisdiction, when\n\na prior motion to intervene in the main case has been denied and\n\nsustained on appeal by the court.          In my view, there is nothing in\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which contemplates a motion at\n\nthe trial court level to intervene for appeal purposes only and\n\nthere is nothing in the newly enacted amendment to the Civil Rights\n\nAct which evidences an intention to create an appeal from the\n\nfairness hearing.\n\n     Some history is necessary to put this case and my dissent in\n\nperspective.

That balance is best achieved when all interested\n\nparties are allowed to participate in a single proceeding.              As the\n\nJudiciary Committee stated:\n\n     [T]he Wilks decision imposes inefficient and inequitable rules\n     on Title VII litigation.     Once an employment dispute has\n     reached the courts, the parties, all non-litigants with a\n     stake in its outcome, and the public have a strong interest in\n     bringing the litigation to an expeditious end.      Thus, all\n     related interests and claims should ordinarily be adjudicated\n     in one proceeding. (emphasis added). H.R.Rep.

It is\n\nsimilar in content to the pre-Wilks case law, although it imposes\n\nsome    new    requirements        (i.e.,    \"actual      notice   of    the   proposed\n\njudgment\") which were not requirements of that prior law.\n\n       Subsection n(2) sets forth the various circumstances in which\n\nsubsequent attack on a Title VII consent decree will not be\n\nprecluded.       Congress expressly stated its intent to include all\n\nrelevant parties in Subsection n(2)(A) which provides that nothing\n\nin   the      Subsection      is    intended      to   \"alter   the     standards   for\n\nintervention under Rule 24.\"             Although the majority opinion makes\n\nno mention of the effect these amendments, I believe that we should\n\nreconcile and address their effect on this suit.\n\n       With this general legal background in mind, I need to add some\n\ncomments about this particular lawsuit.                  It is a \"disparate impact\n\ncase\" and not an \"intentional discrimination case.\"                       It was filed\n\nAugust 19, 1992. As the majority opinion indicates, two previously\n\nexisting lawsuits, Kelly and Comeaux were consolidated into this\n\ncase.      Kelly, filed in 1975, and Comeaux, filed in 1976, both\n\nincluded assertions of disparate impact similar to those in the\n\ncurrent case.         The City of Houston filed an answer in this case on\n\nSeptember       30,   1992,    and    denied      generally     the   allegations    of\n\n                                             55\n\fdisparate impact in this case, just as it had done in the prior\n\ncases of Kelly and Comeaux.    The disparate impact is alleged to\n\noccur \"in racially discriminatory promotional examinations for the\n\nranks of sergeant and lieutenant in the Houston Police Department.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs sought certification by the trial court of two\n\nclasses of plaintiffs, African American and Hispanic American\n\nmembers of the police department who took examinations for sergeant\n\nand lieutenant during the years in question.   As I understand the\n\nrecord, the process for promotion in the Houston Police Department\n\nconsists of the following steps:\n\n1. The police officers who have served a defined number of years in\n     a lower grade are eligible to take the examination for\n     promotion to a higher grade.\n\n2. The officers who take and pass the promotional examination with\n     at least the established passing grade are eligible for\n     promotion.\n\n3. All eligible officers are then placed in rank order on a list of\n     those eligible for promotion in accordance with the sum of:\n\n          a. their actual score on that examination, plus\n\n          b. additional points, based on their years of service\n               with the police department.\n\n4.   As vacancies occur (resulting from death, withdrawal,\n      retirement, resignation, or from expansion of the force by\n      action of the City Council) these vacancies are filled from\n      the top of the list of eligibles downward until all vacancies\n      are filled.\n\nThis system produces the following general results:\n\n1. Individual police officers who make the highest scores on the\n     examination and have the largest number of points for years of\n     service are the first ones to be promoted; and\n\n2. The number of promotions actually made is a function of the\n     number of vacancies and not the number of eligibles on the\n     list.\n\n\n                                56\n\fThe plaintiffs tendered various statistical studies which showed\n\nthat comparing \"test takers\" and \"numbers of promotions\" for each\n\nof the categories of whites, blacks, and hispanics, there was a\n\nvariation in promotion rates for blacks and hispanics sufficiently\n\nlarge to rule out chance as the determining factor, and therefore\n\nthere was an adverse discriminatory impact.     This adverse impact\n\nwas attributed by plaintiffs to certain questions (not identified\n\neither by number or by content) on the examinations, which blacks\n\nand hispanics were alleged to have answered incorrectly more\n\nfrequently than whites.   However, in my judgment, the theory upon\n\nwhich the plaintiffs plead and supported their claims (as indicated\n\nby paragraphs 24-39 of the findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nwhich the plaintiffs prepared and persuaded the trial judge to sign\n\nin this case) suffer two fundamental conceptual breakdowns which\n\nrender their claims questionable:\n\nA. First of all, to prove \"disparate impact\" in the giving and\n     taking of an examination, one must compare \"test takers\" and\n     \"test passers.\" Not only did the plaintiffs not proffer any\n     statistical testimony based on this comparison, they alibied\n     out of the task (and got the district court to sign a finding)\n     on the grounds that the expense of making such a determination\n     was prohibitive.\n\nB. Secondly, to prove \"disparate impact\" in the promotion system\n     used by the city, you must compare the number of individuals\n     eligible for promotion with the number of individuals actually\n     promoted in each of the racial categories.\n\n     As I explained earlier, to be eligible for promotion, each\n\npolice officer, of all racial categories, must achieve the same\n\nminimum score;   and it is important to note in this case that there\n\nis no contention that the minimum passing score for blacks and/or\n\nhispanics was any different from that for whites.      But in their\n\n                                 57\n\fstatistical data, for purposes of comparison with the actual\n\npromotions in each minority category, the plaintiffs utilize a\n\nconcept of \"availability\" (the percentage of blacks and hispanics\n\nof all test takers ) as the starting point for determining a\n\nconcept of \"expected promotions\" (the number of minorities who\n\nwould be promoted if you applied the \"availability\" percentage to\n\nthe total number of actual promotions of all categories.) Clearly,\n\nin my judgment, the factor of \"available percentage\" should have\n\nbeen determined by determining the percentage of each minority\n\ncategory of all \"test passers\" (not test takers ) and the number of\n\n\"expected promotions\" would then be the percentage attributable to\n\neach minority group which were eligible for promotions as applied\n\nto the total number of promotions actually made.\n\n      If the statistical data incorporated in the findings of fact\n\nwas   the   same   data   presented   to   the   City   of   Houston   in   the\n\nsettlement negotiations, I am genuinely surprised that the city\n\nwould buy into the fundamental premises of the plaintiffs' case.\n\nObviously,     the    city   had   faced    similar     \"disparate     impact\"\n\ncontentions in the Kelly and Comeaux cases for more than ten years,\n\nand had consistently declined to recognize the validity of such\n\ncontentions.       The net results of the plaintiffs' claims and the\n\ncity's capitulation thereto, is a determination of a \"short fall\"\n\nin promotions to each of the minority groups and a determination to\n\naward \"remedial promotions\" to each of these minority groups on the\n\nbasis of such \"short fall.\"           There is, however, no evidence or\n\nfindings which can determine any individual as to which these\n\n\n                                      58\n\fremedial promotions should be granted.           In fact, under the consent\n\ndecree, these promotions will be awarded to whomever the city\n\nchooses from among the two minority groups.           I am deeply troubled\n\nby the decision of the city to use a consent decree from the\n\nfederal court as a crutch to achieve that which it could not\n\naccomplish as a matter of its own independent decision making,\n\ni.e., expand the composition of the police department by 96 new\n\nsergeants slots and award those slots on the basis of race.\n\n       At about this point, various other groups of police officers\n\nsought to intervene in this case.            Some of these groups are\n\nrepresentative of other minorities, i.e., women and Asians. Others\n\nof   these    groups   represent    associations    and   unions   of   police\n\nofficers.     Some of these groups sought to intervene as plaintiffs,\n\nalleging that they too had been victims of \"disparate impact\" in\n\nthe promotion process and that they should be entitled to share in\n\nthe assignment of the new sergeant and lieutenant slots authorized\n\nby the city council.      Other groups sought to intervene, in effect\n\non the side of the City of Houston, as defendants, asserting that\n\nthe examinations given for promotions were legitimate \"job related\"\n\nexaminations, and consistent with the \"business necessity\" and\n\nprofessional desire to see that the most qualified individuals were\n\npromoted to positions of leadership.         Some of these latter groups\n\nplead and proffered testimony that would show that the statistical\n\ndata   upon    which   plaintiffs    contended     \"disparate   impact\"   had\n\noccurred was flawed in concept or factually insupportable.                And\n\nthese contentions bring us to what I consider to be the \"gut\" issue\n\n\n                                      59\n\fin this lawsuit, i.e., \"Did the trial court properly dispose of\n\nthese motions to intervene?\"\n\n       The trial court set a hearing to consider the motions to\n\nintervene.    This hearing began at 9:30 a.m., continued without a\n\nrecess, and concluded after generating only 65 pages of transcribed\n\ntestimony.    Approximately the first 30 pages of this transcription\n\nset forth a dialogue between the trial judge and plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel regarding the nature and content of plaintiffs' asserted\n\ndiscrimination claims and the remedy provisions of some of the\n\naspects of the proposed consent decree.          About mid-way through the\n\nhearing, counsel for one of the would-be intervenors (the Houston\n\nPolice Patrolmen's Union) asked the court to direct its attention\n\nto the issue of intervention, which was the purpose of the hearing,\n\nand twice advised the court regarding the applicability of 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(n) as it relates to the subject of intervention.\n\nThe trial court, however, ignored such references to subsection\n\n(n).    Furthermore, at this hearing, supposedly on the subject of\n\nintervention, the court made no reference to Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a),\n\n24(b)   or   to   any   of   the   factors   relating   to   the   subject   of\n\nintervention under those rules.              There was no mention of the\n\nStallworth case, nor the four factors for determining a question of\n\ntimeliness thereunder. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court\n\nannounced its ruling from the bench as follows:\n\n       The motions to intervene are denied without prejudice to them\n       being reasserted after the objections are heard for purposes\n       of appealing the decision itself as opposed to any ruling of\n       the preparation of this issue. [sic]\n\n       Three days after the intervention hearing the district judge\n\n                                       60\n\ffiled a \"order on intervention\" which read, in its entirety, as\n\nfollows:\n\n1. The motions to intervene in this case as full active parties\n     representative by women, Asians, the airport police and park\n     police, and by Houston Police Patrolmen's Union and Park\n     Police Association are denied.\n\n2. The court will consider motions to intervene for purposes of\n     appeal. These motions must be filed by April 19, 1993.\n\n      The   district   judge   did   not   file   any   memorandum   opinion\n\nsupporting this \"order on intervention.\"           Notices of appeal from\n\nthe denial of the motions to intervene were timely filed within 30\n\ndays after the entry of such order.         These notices of appeal were\n\ndocketed under Appeal No. 93-2315 of this court.\n\n      As we begin the task of assessing the propriety of the trial\n\ncourt's denial of the motion to intervene, and particularly the\n\nissue of \"timeliness\" which is at the heart of that determination,\n\nI think it is imperative to have a clear sense as to the procedural\n\nposture of the main case when the motions to intervene were filed.\n\nThe intervention motions were essentially filed on or around March\n\n12, 1993.     As of that date, the original parties, (i.e., the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendant City of Houston):\n\nA. Had not filed any proposed order determining the class or\n     classes to be certified pursuant to Rule 23(c) even though\n     subpart (1) of that rule states that such action would be\n     taken \"as soon as practicable after the commencement of an\n     action brought as a class action;\"\n\nB.   Had not entered into any scheduling order under Rule 16\n      establishing time tables for \"joinder of parties, amendment of\n      pleadings, or completion of discovery\" as contemplated by that\n      rule;\n\nC. Had not engaged in any discovery activities or taken any\n    deposition pursuant to notices filed under Rule 26;\n\n\n                                     61\n\fD. Had not conducted any pretrial conferences for the purpose of\n     establishing a trial date; and\n\nE. Had not, obviously, undertaken any steps to implement any of the\n     changes or procedures contemplated by the proposed consent\n     decree.\n\n      As this court stated in Stallworth, \"timeliness is not limited\n\nto chronological considerations but \"is to be determined from all\n\nthe circumstances.' \"       Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n263 (1977) (quoting United States v. United States Steel Corp., 548\n\nF.2d at 1235).       Viewed in the light of \"all the circumstances\" I\n\nwould say that this case was still early in its normal procedural\n\nhistory and that there is no question that the motions to intervene\n\nwere timely under \"all the circumstances.\"          The City of Houston\n\nfiled its answer on September 30, 1992, approximately 40 days after\n\nthe plaintiffs filed their original petition.        In that answer, the\n\nCity of Houston, as defendant, denied the essential elements of the\n\nplaintiffs' claim, called on the plaintiffs to prove \"disparate\n\nimpact,\" and tendered proof by the city in support of the business\n\nnecessity of the promotional examinations. The docket sheet of the\n\ncourt reflects absolutely no entries of any kind after September\n\n30, 1992, until November 19, 1992, when the parties filed a consent\n\norder on \"confidentiality of documents,\" which order was finally\n\nsigned and filed on December 14, 1992.       The next significant entry\n\non the court's docket was January 20, 1993, indicating a memorandum\n\nof   a   telephone    conference   which   made   arrangements   for   the\n\npreparation of a notice form to be sent out and established\n\npreliminary time tables for the return of objections and a pretrial\n\nconference. Consequently, for a period of almost four months, from\n\n                                    62\n\fthe date of the city's answer on September 30, 1992 to the entry of\n\nthe conference memorandum on January 20, 1993, there were no docket\n\nentries on the registry of the court which would have given any\n\nthird party who might be interested in the status of this case any\n\nreal substantive clue as to what was going on.    During this time,\n\nof course, the plaintiffs and the City of Houston initiated private\n\nsettlement discussions (sometime in late November) and Chief Nuchia\n\nsent out his circular to the police department on December 16.\n\n(See n. 8 of majority opinion, supra.)   However, it is evident from\n\nChief Nuchia's December 16th circular both that the consent decree\n\nwas not a done deal and that the details had not been released.\n\nThe panel majority attribute great significance to this December\n\n16th circular which I am not inclined to give, primarily because of\n\nthe tentative and preliminary nature of the information contained\n\ntherein. But, even assuming that it was sufficient notice to start\n\nsome \"timeliness\" clock ticking against the would-be intervenors,\n\nthe would-be intervenors took no more time to ultimately file their\n\nmotions to intervene than it took the city and plaintiffs to arrive\n\nat some preliminary concept of a consent decree.          The panel\n\nmajority admits that this time interval by itself \"would probably\n\nnot merit a finding of untimeliness\" but it nonetheless affirms the\n\ntrial court by relying principally on the second and third factors\n\nof the Stallworth analysis.\n\n     Stallworth's second factor relates to the prejudice which\n\nmight result to existing parties.    As Stallworth makes absolutely\n\nclear, such determination of prejudice as to existing parties is\n\n\n                                63\n\fapplicable primarily to motions for intervention under Rule 24(b)\n\n(permissive intervention) and has very limited application to\n\nmotions for intervention under Rule 24(a). Stallworth, 558 F.2d at\n\n265.       This is because the language about prejudice to existing\n\nparties exists only in the language of Rule 24(b).                   Therefore, to\n\ntake into account any prejudice that the existing parties may incur\n\nif intervention were allowed as part of the rubric of timeliness\n\nwould      be   to    rewrite   Rule       24(a)   by   creating    an   additional\n\nprerequisite to intervention as of right.                 Id.\n\n       This is precisely what the majority does in their opinion.\n\nAmazingly they cite Corley v. Jackson Police Dep't as authority for\n\nthat conclusion.         In Corley the motion to intervene was filed some\n\nfour       years     after   entry    of     the    consent     decree   and   after\n\nimplementation          of   the     consent       decree,    neither    of    which\n\ncircumstances exist in this case.                Corley v. Jackson Police Dep't,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448901\"><a href=\"/opinion/448901/charlie-corley-and-levaughn-carter-individually-etc-v-jackson-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir.1985).              Furthermore, although the would-be\n\nintervenors in this case sought to intervene under both Rule 24(a)\n\nand Rule 24(b), the majority does not even mention the distinction\n\nclearly established by Stallworth between those two rules on the\n\nsubject of prejudice to the existing parties.4\n\n       Likewise, when we turn to Stallworth's third and fourth\n\n\n       4\n      In essence what the majority opinion and the special\nconcurring opinion would establish as precedent for cases\ninvolving consent decrees is a rule that once the original\nparties to the litigation agree on the terms and conditions of a\nconsent decree and issue the notices required by subsection (n),\nany attempt by a third party to intervene is untimely as a matter\nof law. In my view, that just cannot be what Congress intended\nby the adoption of subsection (n).\n\n                                            64\n\ftimeliness factors, I think the trial judge and the panel majority\n\ncompletely    missed    the    boat.        The   boat    in    this   case     is    the\n\nsignificant impact which subsection (n) brings to the table of\n\ndiscussion about timeliness.           The panel majority dismisses factor\n\n4 by simply concluding that there were no unusual circumstances.\n\nAs to factor 3 the panel majority concludes that the would-be\n\nintervenors   \"had     their   day     in   court,\"      stating,      \"there    is    no\n\nprejudice to the appellants [the would-be intervenors] because\n\ntheir participation in the fairness hearing in effect gave them all\n\nthe rights they would have had they been made parties to the\n\nlawsuit.\"     The majority reaches this conclusion without even\n\nmentioning    the    language     of    subsection        (n)    which     obviously\n\nprejudices the would-be appellant's rights by foreclosing the\n\npossibility of subsequent challenge.               Rather than sanction this\n\nresult, Congress expressly tried to prevent it by encouraging\n\ninclusion of all interests in one proceeding.                   For example,\n\n     Subsection   (n)(2)(A)  states  that  the   standards  for\n     intervention under Rule 24 are not \"altered\" by (n)(1)(B),\n     regarding notice and an opportunity to present objections;\n     and\n\n     subsection (n)(2)(A) also states that the rights of parties\n     who have \"successfully intervened,\" pursuant to Rule 24, are\n     not altered by (n)(1)(B).\n\nIn my view these provisions contemplate that intervention could\n\noccur in the proceeding in which the notice and opportunity to\n\npresent objections would occur under (n)(1)(B), otherwise there\n\nwould have been no need to include the second part of (n)(2)(A).\n\n     Finally I note that there is nothing in subsection (n) which\n\nspeaks to the rights of parties who have been denied intervention;\n\n                                        65\n\fand there is nothing in subsection (n) which gives persons to whom\n\nnotice and opportunity to present objections have been afforded\n\nunder paragraph (1)(B) the right to appeal the entry of the\n\njudgment or order described in subparagraph (1)(A).\n\n     I submit that it is self evident from the face of the statute\n\nthat the provisions for notice and an opportunity to present\n\nobjections were not intended to take the place of intervention\n\nrights under Rule 24(a) or (b).               If any legislative history is\n\nnecessary to support this conclusion, I cite the following:\n\n     A person wishing to challenge an employment practice that\n     implements a court decree will thus retain the right under\n     Rule 24 to seek to intervene in the proceeding in which the\n     decree was entered and, the court will determine whether\n     intervention is appropriate through reference to the\n     principles that have developed under Rule 24. Similarly, the\n     preclusion rules do not apply to the rights of parties who\n     successfully intervene pursuant to Rule 24. H.R.Rep. 40(I),\n     102d Cong. (1991), reprinted in, 137 Cong.Rec. 597 (1991),\n     U.S.Cong. & Admin.News 1991, 597.\n\n     Furthermore,      in   the   same    legislative    history,   the   house\n\ncommittee report states as follows:\n\n     They [the provisions regarding notice and a reasonable\n     opportunity to be heard] advance the important goal of\n     judicial finality by permitting all interests affected by a\n     Title VII consent decree to be considered fully and fairly in\n     a single proceeding, prior to entry of the decree.       These\n     provisions also embody the principle that third parties are\n     best left to decide for themselves (after receiving sufficient\n     notice) whether to enter pending litigation, rather than being\n     forcibly joined, regardless of their wishes or intentions, as\n     the Wilks rule requires. Id. at 594 (emphasis added).\n\n     Finally,    the    legislators       specified     that   subsection   (n)\n\nprovides   for   the   inclusion     \"of      all   reasonably   ascertainable\n\ninterested parties in a single proceeding\" and precludes subsequent\n\nchallenges \"only where preclusion is consistent with due process.\"\n\n\n                                         66\n\fId. at 597.\n\n     Given the plain language of the statute and this legislative\n\nhistory, I submit that subsection (n) affords an individual who has\n\nreceived actual notice of a consent decree which might adversely\n\naffect his interests, three options.   They are:\n\nA. He may do nothing, in which event he will be precluded from\n     challenging the judgment or order;\n\nB. He may elect to present his objections on or before the date set\n     by the notice, in which event he has no right to appeal from\n     whatever disposition the court makes of his objections, and he\n     will be precluded from challenging the judgment ultimately\n     entered; or\n\nC. He may move to intervene in the proceeding, in which event one\n     or the other of the following results may occur:\n\n1. If his motion to intervene is granted, he would be granted all\n     of the rights of a normal party litigant therein, would not be\n     precluded from asserting his rights under the Constitution or\n     Federal Civil Rights Laws, would be afforded the right to\n     appeal from the final judgment therein, and would be bound by\n     principles of res judicata to the final judgment established\n     therein; or\n\n2. If his motion to intervene is denied, he would have the right to\n     appeal such denial as may be afforded under Rule 24; and he\n     may elect to participate or not participate in the opportunity\n     to present objections, but in such latter event he would be\n     precluded from challenging the judgment or order finally\n     entered therein unless an appellate court determined that his\n     motion to intervene was improperly denied by the trial court.\n\n     Under this analysis, the requirements of subsection (n) create\n\nspecial and unusual circumstances under Stallworth's fourth factor\n\nwhich requires that the timeliness of would-be intervenors' motions\n\nto intervene be assessed in light of the notice required under\n\nsubsection (n)(1)(B).   Likewise, the assessment under Stallworth's\n\nthird factor, the prejudice which the would-be intervenor will\n\nsuffer if intervention is denied, should be assessed in light of\n\n\n                                 67\n\fthe preclusive effect which subsection (n) produces as a result of\n\nsuch denial.    Courts have often rationalized denying intervention\n\non the grounds that the would-be intervenors could later bring\n\ntheir own separate suit to assert their particular remedies. Under\n\nsubsection (n) this will no longer be true.            Consequently, in my\n\nview, the proper course for our trial courts to follow when faced\n\nwith a motion to intervene in a Title VII proceeding, is to permit\n\nsuch intervention when the motion for intervention is filed prior\n\nto the entry of the final decree, and prior to the date set for\n\nresponse   in   the   notices   sent    out   under   Paragraph   (1)(B)   of\n\nsubsection (n). Such course of action is fully consistent with the\n\nstatements of policy reflected by the legislative history quoted\n\nabove and fully reconciles the two great policy considerations\n\nwhich motivated Congress to pass subsection (n).            The majority's\n\nposition, finding intervention untimely even when filed before\n\nentry of the consent decree and before the date for responses, is\n\ninconsistent with our well-established precedent and effectively\n\nforecloses   meaningful    participation      by   non-minority   and   other\n\ninterested groups in Title VII litigation.5           Such a bold departure\n\n     5\n      Our decisions finding intervention untimely have all\ninvolved motions filed well after entry of the consent decree.\nSee Corley v.

Our\n\n                                       68\n\ffrom precedent should at least be acknowledged and discussed by the\n\nmajority.\n\n       Having disposed of the motions to intervene, the trial court\n\nmoved on to conduct what has been euphemistically referred to as\n\nthe \"fairness hearing.\"         This hearing occurred two days after the\n\nhearing on the motions to intervene, began at 9:00 a.m., had a\n\nlunch break, and was concluded at about 5:00 p.m.             A large part of\n\nthis    hearing   consisted     of    dialogue   between   counsel    for    the\n\nplaintiffs, the city, and the \"objectors\" and between those counsel\n\nand the court.      In essence, the \"hearing\" consisted of a verbal\n\nrehash of the terms and conditions of the consent decree and the\n\ncontent   of    written   objections     which   had   been   filed    by    many\n\nindividuals and by the would-be intervenors.            Some live testimony\n\nwas presented by the police chief and by the statistical expert for\n\nplaintiffs.       The court declined, however, to accept any live\n\ntestimony tendered by an expert of HPPU, one of the would-be\n\nintervenors-objectors.         The document labeled \"Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law\" which contains 102 pages, and which the trial\n\ncourt signed and filed the next day, was pre-drafted apparently by\n\nthe plaintiffs and was present, and frequently referred to, during\n\nthe fairness hearing.          In my view, this \"fairness hearing\" was\n\nnothing more than a drill to permit the district court to rubber\n\nstamp   its    approval   of    the   pre-drafted   findings    of    fact   and\n\n\n\nlandmark decision in Stallworth found intervention timely when\nfiled one month after entry of judgment. See Stallworth, 558\nF.2d at 266. (The mere fact judgment has already been entered\nshould not require that intervention be denied as untimely.)\n\n                                        69\n\fconclusions of law, and ultimately the consent decree.                       To label\n\nthis    hearing,   as     the    majority       does    in   their    discussion    of\n\nStallworth's third factor, as in effect affording the would-be\n\nintervenors \"their day in court\" is to render that historical\n\nfigure of speech meaningless.              In my view, to \"have your day in\n\ncourt\" means that one is a party to the litigation, having all of\n\nthe rights of discovery, rights of presentation of evidence and\n\nwitnesses, the right to have disputed issues determined by an\n\nimpartial trier of fact in accordance with the rules of evidence,\n\nand ultimately the right to appeal.               I do not mean to say that the\n\ntrial    judge    erred    in    failing     to    afford     such    a    full   blown\n\nevidentiary hearing to the objectors. Clearly, Paragraph (1)(B) of\n\nsubsection (n) speaks only of \"a reasonable opportunity to present\n\nobjections\" as the second requirement after sufficient notice.\n\nThis statutory provision does not even contain the word \"hearing\"\n\nmuch less the words \"evidentiary hearing\" in defining the manner in\n\nwhich objections are to be presented.                  But, what I do mean to say,\n\nis that the status of \"objector\" under Paragraph (1)(B) is a far\n\ncry from    the    status       of   \"a   party   intervenor\"        and   \"reasonable\n\nopportunity to present objections\" is not the same as \"a day in\n\ncourt.\"     For the majority to support its conclusion that the\n\nwould-be intervenors suffered no prejudice because they had their\n\nday in court is nothing but an empty rationalization.\n\n            MOTION TO INTERVENE FOR APPEAL PURPOSES ONLY\n\n       During the course of the so-called intervention hearing, the\n\nidea that such would-be intervenors might be permitted to intervene\n\n\n                                           70\n\ffor appeal purposes only was floated by the plaintiffs and the City\n\nof Houston.   The district court picked up on this idea and included\n\nit in the second paragraph of its brief order denying intervention\n\nin the underlying action.     On April 19, 1993, the date specified by\n\nthe district judge's invitation, the would-be intervenors filed\n\nsuch motions to intervene for appeal purposes only.                On May 20,\n\n1993, the district court entered an order denying the motions to\n\nintervene for purposes of appeal, and filed therewith an \"Opinion\n\non Denial of Intervention for Appeal\" (\"Opinion\").                 Since this\n\ndocument is the best evidence of what the district judge really had\n\nin his mind in ruling on the various motions, I quote two portions\n\nthereof which I think are extremely relevant:\n\n1. These various groups argue that the consent decree does not help\n     them, and worse, it hurts them. They assert that the remedy\n     here injured them. Their remedy is not to intervene, but to\n     object to the decree. They did, and they were not persuasive.\n     (emphasis added) Opinion, at 3.\n\n2. The non-parties assert that they should be allowed to intervene\n     so that they can address on appeal the fact that their\n     objections to the consent decree were overruled, and that they\n     were not allowed to intervene in the case as parties. Their\n     motions are made in a vacuum; they lack substance, support,\n     and persuasion. Id. at 5.\n\n     While the first of the quoted paragraphs above was written\n\nsome two months after the district court originally ruled on the\n\nprimary   motions   to   intervene   in   the   main   case,   I   think   the\n\nunderlined portion of that paragraph clearly indicates that the\n\ndistrict court operated under a mistake of law as to the impact of\n\nsubsection (n).     For the reasons which I have set forth earlier, I\n\nthink the explicit language of the statute and the supporting\n\nlegislative history makes clear that rights of intervention under\n\n                                     71\n\fRule 24(a) or (b) were not changed by the passage of subsection\n\n(n).    Again, it is important to note that nowhere in its Opinion\n\ndid the district court mention Rule 24(a) or (b), or subsection\n\n(n), or the Stallworth case, or any of the four factors defined in\n\nStallworth as considerations to determine timeliness.                     Given this\n\nlanguage used in the Opinion, I think the majority's conclusion\n\nthat   the    trial    judge    based   his        decision   on   \"timeliness\"     is\n\ninsupportable.\n\n       The second quoted paragraph above gives the district court's\n\nexplanation for denying the motions to intervene for purposes of\n\nappeal only.        I think the district court was correct in denying\n\nsuch   motions,     but   for   reasons        entirely   different       from   those\n\nmentioned by the district court.           First of all, I find no authority\n\nin any federal rule of civil procedure for the filing of a motion\n\nto intervene for purposes of appeal only.                     Nothing in Rule 24\n\nrefers to such a motion and no one has cited any statute which\n\ncreates      such     right.      While        I    recognize      that   Stallworth\n\ncharacterizes our circuit's rule regarding appeal of denial of a\n\nmotion to intervene as \"anomalous,\" the majority's tacit approval\n\nof the filing of a motion to intervene for appeal only, and\n\nconsideration on appeal of the denial of such a motion, carries our\n\ncircuit practice beyond the area of anomaly into the area of shear\n\nnonsense.     A would-be intervenor certainly has a right to appeal\n\nfrom the denial of his motion to intervene under our practice, but\n\nif the trial court was right in denying such motion, then the\n\nwould-be intervenor is finished, through, out-of-the case and in my\n\n\n                                          72\n\fjudgment should not be permitted to file further motions or notices\n\nin that case.     On the other hand, if the trial court was wrong in\n\ndenying the     motion     for   intervention,    then   the   relief    at    the\n\nappellate level is to vacate the judgment entered into without the\n\nwould-be intervenor's participation, and remand the case with\n\ninstructions to permit the intervention and proceed with a retrial.\n\nIn either such event, the concept of a motion to intervene for\n\nappeal purposes only is surplusage.\n\n     Secondly, it is perfectly clear that subsection (n) does not\n\ncontemplate any appellate review process after the \"reasonable\n\nopportunity to present objections.\"              That would clearly be the\n\nsituation if no one ever attempted to intervene in the main\n\nproceeding and simply decided to file a motion to intervene for\n\nappeal purposes only after the trial judge has conducted the\n\n\"fairness hearing\" and was unpersuaded by their objections.                   I do\n\nnot think   the    court    should   infer   an   appellate    process    where\n\nCongress has not prescribed one, especially not as to the merits of\n\nthe case.   In this case, the would-be intervenors whose original\n\nmotions to intervene were denied, should not be able to intervene\n\nfor appeal purposes only in order to appeal the court's rejections\n\nof their objections. Since they have already given their notice of\n\nappeal as to the denial of their original motions to intervene,\n\nthere really is nothing further which could be considered by a\n\nmotion to intervene for appeal purposes only.\n\n     Consequently, I would conclude that this court does not have\n\nappellate jurisdiction to consider the denial of a motion to\n\n\n                                      73\n\fintervene for appeal purposes only in a Title VII action.              I think\n\nthe panel majority errs in undertaking that task.               I note with\n\ninterest however, that the panel majority proceeds to find (i) that\n\nthe trial court erred in denying such motions, (ii) that the\n\nwould-be   intervenors      had   an   interest   sufficient      to   support\n\nintervention as of right and were so situated that disposition of\n\nthe action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede their\n\nability to protect that interest, and (iii) that the existing\n\nparties, i.e., the plaintiffs and the City of Houston, did not\n\nadequately represent the interest of the would-be intervenors.             In\n\nso doing, the panel majority makes clear that, but for their\n\nconclusion that the original motions to intervene were \"untimely,\"\n\nthe would-be intervenors would have satisfied all of the other\n\nrequirements of Rule 24(a) to justify intervention.            Even assuming\n\nthe   trial   court   had    denied     intervention   on   the    basis   of\n\nuntimeliness, and I do not believe it did, finding a motion to\n\nintervene untimely when filed both before the fairness hearing and\n\nbefore entry of judgment sets bold and, in my opinion, unwise new\n\nprecedent.    I am at a loss to understand the majority's reasoning.\n\n      Having affirmed the district court's denial of the original\n\nmotion to intervene on the basis of \"untimeliness,\" and having\n\ndismissed the appeals relating thereto, the majority now turns\n\naround and takes appellate consideration of the trial court's\n\ndenial of motions to intervene for appeal purposes only, filed by\n\nindividuals and groups who were no longer in the case, and reverses\n\nthe denial of such motions on the grounds that these same persons\n\n\n                                       74\n\fand groups met all of the requirements of Rule 24(a) to intervene.\n\n                     MERITS OF CONSENT DECREE\n\n     As pointed out by the majority opinion, neither the City of\n\nHouston nor the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the final\n\njudgment of the district court approving and adopting the consent\n\ndecree.   This is not surprising since those parties had agreed to\n\nthe entry of the consent decree in the first place.       The only\n\npersons and groups who filed notices of appeal as to the entry of\n\nthe final judgment were the would-be intervenors who filed those\n\nnotices as part of the notices of appeal relating to the denial of\n\ntheir motions to intervene.     These notices were filed in the\n\ninterval between the filing of their motions to intervene for\n\npurposes of appeal and the order of the trial court denying such\n\nmotions to intervene for purposes of appeal.    Consequently at the\n\ntime the notices of appeal relating to the merits of the consent\n\ndecree were filed, the would-be intervenors were clearly not\n\nparties to the proceeding, because their motions to intervene\n\noriginally had been denied and their motions to intervene for\n\npurposes of appeal only had not been acted upon.         So, in my\n\njudgment, we face another enigma quite similar to the one discussed\n\nin the preceding section, and it boils down to this question:   \"Can\n\nour court take appellate jurisdiction of an appeal originating from\n\na notice of appeal filed by parties and groups who were not at that\n\ntime either original parties or intervenors and whose motions to\n\nintervene for appeal purposes only had been filed but not acted\n\nupon by the district court?\"   My answer to the question would be,\n\n\n                                75\n\f\"surely not.\"   Non-parties whose motions to intervene in the main\n\ncase have been denied have standing to appeal only the denial of\n\nsuch intervention.    As to other and further proceedings in that\n\ncase, they remain non-parties until the appellate court reverses\n\nthe denial of their motion to intervene, which the panel majority\n\nhas concluded not to do in this case.            Had the district court\n\ndecided to permit their intervention for appeal purposes only, some\n\nargument might be made that permission should relate back to the\n\nnotices of appeal which they previously filed regarding the merits\n\nof the consent decree.       But, in this case, the district court\n\ndenied their motions to intervene for appeal purposes only, so no\n\nrelation back concept could be at work here.          In addition to the\n\nproblem of standing for filing notices of appeal, we face once\n\nagain the   problem   that   subsection   (n)    clearly   does    not   make\n\nprovision for any appeals from whatever the trial court decides to\n\ndo in light of the filing of objections.        Surely, when Congress has\n\nnot made provision for an appeal, the courts should not \"legislate\"\n\nthat there be one.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, I think the panel majority makes a\n\nmistake in addressing the merits of the consent decree.           I realize,\n\nof course, that the would-be intervenors (\"appellants\") spend a\n\nconsiderable portion of their briefs arguing the merits and the\n\nplaintiffs and the City of Houston, to a lesser extent, respond.\n\nHowever, this court has frequently stated that we are a court of\n\nlimited appellate jurisdiction, that we can and should address sua\n\nsponte whether our jurisdiction exists, and that neither the\n\n\n                                  76\n\fparties' expressed nor implied consent can vest our court with\n\njurisdiction when it does not, in fact, exist.                       E.g., U.S. v.\n\nGarner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir.1985).                 I realize also that in an\n\nearlier portion of this dissent, I made derogatory comments about\n\nthe theory of the plaintiffs' claims of \"disparate impact.\"                    I did\n\nso not to try to evaluate the merits of those claims, but to\n\nindicate, that in my judgment the claims asserted by the would-be\n\nintervenors were sufficient to create a good faith controversy, and\n\nfor the good of all concerned, employers and opposing groups or\n\nfactions   of   employees,   the   place           and   time   to   resolve   those\n\ncontroversies is in one single proceeding.                When the employer is a\n\npublic entity (as in this case) and when the relief proposed is\n\nremedial promotions and adjustments in seniority based directly on\n\nrace, I think the role of a federal judge presented with a proposed\n\nconsent decree takes on extremely critical importance.                    When the\n\nnotices sent out under subsection (n) generate motions to intervene\n\nby individuals and groups of the quantity and quality as occurred\n\nin this case, i.e., the Houston Police Patrolmen's Union, the\n\nHouston Police Officers Association, the Houston Airport Police\n\nOfficers Association, the Park Police Officers Association, the\n\nAsian American Police Officers Association, and the Female Police\n\nOfficers Association, then the court should be extremely careful in\n\nrushing to judgment on the basis of the proposed consent decree\n\napproved by the initial parties. Our system of justice is premised\n\non the idea that truth can best be arrived at by subjecting the\n\ncontentions     of   each   side   to        the    critical     and   adversarial\n\n\n                                        77\n\fexamination by the other side.                  And whether, as in this case,\n\n\"disparate impact\" has in fact occurred, and whether, as in this\n\ncase, remedies for such \"disparate impact\" have been carefully and\n\nnarrowly tailored to cure only the \"disparate impact\" can best be\n\ndetermined by submitting the controversies to impartial jury and\n\njudge. When all parties potentially affected and involved agree on\n\nthe    essential       findings    and    conclusions,   a   consent   decree   is\n\ncertainly appropriate.6           But when real and substantial segments of\n\nthe employee population assert that \"disparate impact\" did not\n\noccur and that the remedial changes go beyond the scope of the\n\nalleged \"disparate impact\" and affect their individual interests,\n\nthen       they    should   be   allowed   to    intervene   and   present   those\n\ncontentions ultimately, if necessary, to the jury and judge.\n\nObviously, that may produce more work for the court and some delay\n\nat arriving at a final determination, but the provisions of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure are clearly adequate to provide\n\nfor    the        prompt    elimination    of    frivolous   and   insupportable\n\ncontentions, the severance of the process into separate liability\n\nand remedy determinations, and the entry of either summary or\n\npost-trial judgments which will truly be binding upon all of the\n\n\n       6\n      Such a case was relied on, inappropriately I believe, by\nthe trial judge. At the hearings and in the Findings of Fact and\nConclusions of Law, the trial judge and the original parties\nrelied upon evidence generated in the case involving Houston\nFirefighters. Houston Chapter of the Int'l Ass'n of Black\nProfessional Firefighters v. City of Houston, 56 Fair\nEmpl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 445, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">340296</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991). In that case,\nhowever, the non-minority interests were certified as a class,\nparticipated in the negotiations and signed the proposed consent\ndecree.\n\n                                           78\n\fparties and interests and thoroughly satisfy the public interest in\n\nthe finality of such determinations.\n\n     In conclusion, I do not agree that the trial court denied the\n\nmotions to intervene on the basis of untimeliness.                  Instead, the\n\nopaque statements quoted by the majority and the district court's\n\nopinion denying intervention for purposes of appeal suggest that\n\nthe trial judge believed that subsection (n) of the 1991 amendments\n\nto the Civil Rights Act established a new threshold for due\n\nprocess:     substituting notice and an opportunity to object for a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time.                However,\n\neven if I agreed that this was the court's rationale, the decision\n\ntoday flies in the face of established precedent as well as the\n\nstated policy of subsection (n) of the 1991 amendments to the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991.          As far as I know, we have never found\n\nintervention     filed    before   entry    of   the    consent    decree   to   be\n\nuntimely. I believe the would-be intervenors in this case acted as\n\nquickly    as   possible    by   moving    approximately     six    weeks   after\n\nstatutorily anticipated notice, before the expiration of the time\n\nallotted for objections and before the fairness hearing.\n\n     I do not agree that they had their \"day in court\" either in\n\nthe trial court below or here on appeal.                  Our decision today\n\nappears    to   condone    judicial   approval     of    privately    negotiated\n\nconsent decrees      without     consideration     of    potentially    affected\n\ninterests.      Considering the preclusive effect of subsection (n) of\n\nthe 1991 amendments to the Civil Rights Act, I do not think such an\n\napproach affords due process.\n\n\n                                      79\n\f     Finally, neither the denial of the so-called \"motions to\n\nintervene for purposes of appeal only,\" for which I can find no\n\nbasis in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, nor the substantive\n\nmerits of the consent decree, which were appealed only by persons\n\nwho were not party to this suit, were properly before this court.\n\n     For all of the foregoing reasons, I would REVERSE the decision\n\nof the trial court denying the original motions for intervention,\n\nVACATE the final judgment approving the consent decree, and REMAND\n\nthis case to the trial court for further proceedings.   I would also\n\nDISMISS the appeal of the denial of the motion to intervene for\n\nappeal purposes only, and DISMISS the appeal as to the merits of\n\nthe final judgment entered by the trial court, on the grounds of\n\nlack of appellate jurisdiction in both cases.\n\n                            * * * * * *\n\n\n\n\n                                80\n\f</pre>",
