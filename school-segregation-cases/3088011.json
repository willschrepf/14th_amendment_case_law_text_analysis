(MTI), McDonald\n\nTransit Associates, Inc. (MTA), and LeShawn Vaughn (the transit defendants) in\n\nthe suit brought by Appellee Michelle Rodriguez, denied Rodriguez’s motion for\n\npartial summary judgment, and denied all parties’ requests for attorney’s fees.\n\nBoth sides appealed.\n\n        In her appeal, Rodriguez argues that the trial court erred by granting partial\n\njudgment for the transit defendants, by dismissing her claims against Vaughn,\n\nand by denying her motion for partial summary judgment. In their appeal, the\n\ntransit defendants complain of the trial court’s denial of their requested attorney’s\n\nfees.\n\n        Because we hold (1) that the trial court erred by granting the transit\n\ndefendants’ motion for partial summary judgment, dismissing Rodriguez’s claims,\n\nand denying Rodriguez’s motion for summary judgment in part and (2) that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by granting the interpleader based on the transit\n\ndefendants’ arguments about the statutory cap on their liability, we reverse the\n\n\n\n\n        1\n            See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\n\n                                            2\n\ftrial court’s judgment in part. We affirm the trial court’s judgment as to its denial\n\nof attorney’s fees to the transit defendants.\n\n                                  A. Background\n\n      This appeal is from two consolidated lawsuits arising out of the death of\n\nRodriguez’s mother, Judith Peterson. Peterson was struck and killed by a bus\n\ndriven by Vaughn. Vaughn is an employee of MTI. MTI and MTA are both\n\nindependent contractors of FWTA. Cross-Appellee New Hampshire Insurance\n\nCompany (Insurance) paid worker’s compensation death benefits to Rodriguez.\n\n      Rodriguez filed a wrongful death suit against the transit defendants in the\n\n153rd District Court of Tarrant County. In a separate suit against only FWTA and\n\nVaughn, Insurance brought claims in subrogation for negligent entrustment and\n\nrespondeat superior.2 Insurance filed its suit in the 67th District Court of Tarrant\n\nCounty.\n\n      In Insurance’s suit, MTI filed a petition in intervention and interpleader.\n\nMTI stated that it had been sued by Rodriguez and that it would not deny its\n\n      2\n        See Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 417.001 (West 2015) (providing subrogation\nright for worker’s compensation insurance carriers); Franks v. Sematech, Inc.,\n936 S.W.2d 959, 960 (Tex. 1997) (construing section 417.001 and its\npredecessor, stating that “[t]here is but one cause of action for an employee’s\ninjuries, and it belongs to the employee,” that “[i]f the employee claims\ncompensation benefits, the insurance carrier is subrogated to the employee’s\nrights against a third party who caused the injuries,” that “a carrier who asserts a\nsubrogation claim asserts a claim that belongs to the employee,” that “[t]he\ncarrier can assert its subrogation claim independently of the employee, . . . but\nthat claim is still derivative of the employee’s claim,” and that “[t]he carrier can\nrecover damages greater than the benefits it has paid but must remit the\ndifference to the employee”).\n\n\n                                          3\n\fliability or “[p]laintiff’s injuries and damages as alleged in the lawsuits.” But MTI\n\nfurther alleged that under section 101.023(b) of the Texas Tort Claims Act\n\n(TTCA),3 the liability of FWTA, MTI, and their employees was capped at\n\n$100,000 for all claims arising out of Peterson’s death and that Rodriguez and\n\nInsurance had competing claims against that $100,000. MTI asserted that it was\n\ntendering the limit of $100,000 into the registry of the court under rule of civil\n\nprocedure 43.4 It asked that it “and all current and future parties which are\n\nentitled to the protections of the [TTCA], be dismissed from this cause, With\n\nPrejudice” and that it recover its attorney’s fees and costs.\n\n      Insurance nonsuited all of its claims.      On motions filed by the transit\n\ndefendants, Rodriguez’s case was transferred to the 67th District Court, and the\n\ntwo suits were consolidated.5\n\n      The transit defendants filed a combined amended interpleader petition and\n\nrequest for declaratory relief, which, unlike MTI’s original interpleader petition,\n\nincluded all of the transit defendants. They gave the same legal basis for the\n\ninterpleader as MTI had in its previous interpleader petition—a liability cap of\n\n\n      3\n          Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.023 (West 2011).\n      4\n          Tex. R. Civ. P. 43.\n      5\n      Cf. Franks, 936 S.W.2d at 960–61 (stating that while a worker’s\ncompensation carrier may assert its subrogation claim independently of the\nemployee to whom worker’s compensation benefits have been paid, the\nemployee could intervene in the subrogation suit and recover any damages\nexceeding the benefits the insurer had paid or was obligated to pay).\n\n\n                                          4\n\f$100,000 shared among all four defendants. This amended interpleader petition\n\nasserted that Rodriguez’s claims were defensible, but they would not defend\n\nagainst them if the court accepted their interpleader to resolve all of Rodriguez’s\n\nclaims.\n\n      Both sides filed motions for partial summary judgment.         In the transit\n\ndefendants’ motion, they reiterated their arguments that a single limit of $100,000\n\napplied to Rodriguez’s wrongful death claim, and they asserted that Vaughn was\n\nentitled to be dismissed under the TTCA as an employee of a governmental unit.\n\n      Rodriguez filed an amended petition for a declaratory judgment that FWTA,\n\nMTI, and MTA each had a liability limit of $100,000 and that Vaughn’s liability was\n\nnot limited. In her response to the transit defendants’ summary judgment motion,\n\nRodriguez acknowledged that the liability limits of the TTCA applied, but she\n\ndisagreed that the TTCA capped the total from all defendants at a combined total of\n\n$100,000. She argued that the interpleader was improper and must be denied.\n\n      In Rodriguez’s motion for partial summary judgment, she asserted that\n\nthere was no evidence that MTI had unconditionally tendered funds into the\n\nregistry of the court, that it was exposed to double liability, or that it was an\n\ninnocent, disinterested stakeholder. She asserted the same grounds, among\n\nothers, framed as traditional summary judgment grounds. And she asked for a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the liability limits in the TTCA applied separately to\n\nFWTA, MTA, and MTI, and that Vaughn’s liability was not limited by the TTCA.\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f      The trial court denied Rodriguez’s motion for partial summary judgment and\n\ngranted that of the transit defendants.      In its order granting partial summary\n\njudgment for the transit defendants, the trial court granted the requested\n\ninterpleader and dismissed all claims against the transit defendants. It found that\n\nthe claims against Vaughn should be dismissed based on section 101.106(b) of the\n\nTTCA6 and that Rodriguez’s total amount of recovery against all of the defendants\n\ncumulatively was no more than $100,000 under the TTCA.\n\n      After a hearing, the trial court denied the transit defendants’ request for\n\nattorney’s fees.    It then rendered a final judgment that further ordered that\n\nRodriguez recover $100,000 after the exhaustion of all appeals and dismissing\n\nRodriguez’s claims with prejudice.\n\n                                  B. Discussion\n\n          1. The grant of summary judgment for the transit defendants\n\n      In Rodriguez’s first issue, she asserts that the trial court erred by granting\n\nthe transit defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment. Under this issue,\n\nshe argues that the tort-liability limits applicable to multiple defendants apply\n\nseparately to each defendant and that Vaughn is not an employee of a\n\ngovernmental unit under the TTCA.\n\n\n\n\n      6\n          Tex.

They contended that their argument was supported by\n\na unanimous line of case authority. In support of these contentions, the transit\n\ndefendants cited transportation code subsections 452.0561(c) and 452.056(d),\n\nas well as a Fifth Circuit case28 holding that those sections’ “only to the extent”\n\nlanguage gives derivative sovereign immunity to independent contractors of\n\nregional transportation authorities.\n\n      In Rodriguez’s brief, she directs our attention to the text of the TTCA to\n\nargue that the liability limitation in the TTCA applies individually and separately to\n\neach governmental unit sued, rather than collectively.          She notes that the\n\nsubsections setting out the liability limits reference governmental units\n\nindividually, rather than referring collectively to “all units”: “[a] governmental unit\n\n\n      27\n           Id.\n      28\n           GLF Constr.

Crossland.30 In that case, this court considered the amount for which two\n\ngovernment defendants—the State of Texas and a regional water district—could\n\nbe jointly and severally liable.31     The jury found the water district liable for\n\n$79,800 (under the $100,000 cap applicable to the entity) and the State liable for\n\n$229,25032 (above the $100,000 cap applicable to the State).33 We held that the\n\nState’s liability was capped at $100,000, that the total amount of the judgment\n\ntherefore would be $179,800, and that neither entity could be held jointly and\n\nseverally liable for more than the cap applicable to it—that is, the plaintiff could\n\n      29\n           See Tex.

Id.\n      33\n           Id.\n\n\n                                           12\n\fnot recover the full amount of damages from only one of the defendants.34 We\n\ndid not hold that the plaintiff’s total damages recoverable from the two\n\ndefendants together were limited to $100,000.35\n\n      Rodriguez distinguishes City of Austin v. Cooksey,36 a case that the transit\n\ndefendants had relied on in their motion.          She states that in Cooksey, the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas recognized that the plaintiff could have recovered more\n\nfrom a defendant city if the plaintiff had given the city proper notice of the claims.\n\nIn that case, the court stated that “[w]hen one person is injured or killed, and one\n\nplaintiff brings suit [against the State], the applicable limit of liability is $100,000,”\n\nand “[t]hat limit should not change simply because the deceased is survived by\n\ntwo or more statutory beneficiaries under the wrongful death statute.”37             The\n\ncourt held that the phrase “per person” in the predecessor to section 101.023\n\n“refers to the person or persons who sustain injury.”38 Thus, in a suit against the\n\nState for the death of one person, the State cannot be held liable for more than\n\n$100,000 regardless of the number of plaintiffs in the suit.39\n\n\n      34\n           Id.\n      35\n           Id.\n      36\n           570 S.W.2d 386 (Tex. 1978).\n      37\n           Id. at 387–88.\n      38\n           Id. at 388.\n      39\n           See id.\n\n\n                                           13\n\f      The court in Cooksey did not affirmatively hold that, but for the lack of\n\nnotice, the plaintiffs could have recovered against both the State and the city.\n\nWe therefore do not agree with Rodriguez’s reading of the case.             But as\n\nRodriguez stated in her brief, the only reason discussed by the court for why the\n\nplaintiff could not recover against the city was that the plaintiff had not provided\n\nproper notice.40 The court’s holding that the plaintiffs’ damages were limited was\n\nbased on how the statutory limit applies in a wrongful death case with multiple\n\nplaintiffs. The court did not address how to cap a plaintiff’s damages in a case\n\nwith multiple defendants, each with limited liability. Thus, Rodriguez is correct\n\nthat the case does not support the transit defendants’ position.\n\n      Rodriguez then looks at transportation code section 452.056(d) and\n\nasserts that, because under that provision MTI and MTA are liable to the extent\n\nthat FWTA would be, they each may be liable for an amount up to the same cap\n\nthat applies to FWTA. Rodriguez states that it is undisputed that FWTA is a\n\nregional transportation authority, and thus FWTA, MTI, and MTA may each be\n\nheld liable for damages up to the cap applicable to FWTA.\n\n      In their motion for partial summary judgment, the transit defendants cited\n\nboth section 452.056 and section 452.0561 in support of their arguments. As\n\nnoted above, section 452.056 applies only to regional transportation authorities\n\n\n\n\n      40\n           Id.\n\n\n                                        14\n\fcreated under chapter 452 or its predecessor, and section 452.0561 applies to\n\ndifferent kinds of transportation entities.\n\n      The transit defendants did not produce any evidence that FWTA is a\n\ntransportation entity covered by section 452.0561. Their summary judgment\n\nevidence included FWTA’s contract with MTI and MTA, and that contract stated\n\nthat MTI and MTA “are independent contractors of the FWTA, as that term is\n\ndefined or understood pursuant to § 452.056(d)” of the transportation code.\n\n[Emphasis added.] And in support of their motion, they pointed to a case in\n\nwhich the Supreme Court of Texas referred to FWTA as a regional transportation\n\nauthority.41   Because the summary judgment evidence indicated that section\n\n452.056 applied, and because the transit defendants did not establish the\n\napplicability of section 452.0561 and specifically relied on a case indicating that\n\nsection 452.056 applies, summary judgment could only have been granted on\n\nthe basis of section 452.056, not section 452.0561. Our review of the summary\n\njudgment is therefore limited to consideration of section 452.056.\n\n      We have found only nine Texas cases citing section 452.056. Three of\n\nthose cases involve issues not relevant to this appeal.42 We briefly discuss the\n\nother six.\n\n\n      41\n       See Oncor Elec. Delivery Co. LLC v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369\nS.W.3d 845, 847 (Tex. 2012).\n      42\n       See Gilbert Tex. Constr., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London, 327\nS.W.3d 118, 135 n.11 (Tex. 2010) (referencing section 452.056 but not\naddressing the appellee’s argument that the appellant had immunity under that\n\n                                          15\n\f      In Brown & Gay Engineering, Inc. v. Olivares, “a private company that\n\nperformed allegedly negligent acts in carrying out a contract with a governmental\n\nunit [sought] to invoke the same immunity that the government itself enjoys.”43\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court referenced sections 452.056 and the similar section\n\n452.0561, but it did not apply those sections to its holdings or rely on them in its\n\ndisposition.      After reviewing Texas cases on when sovereign immunity is\n\nextended to government contractors, the court held that “we cannot adopt Brown\n\n& Gay’s contention that it is entitled to share in the [Fort Bend County Toll Road]\n\nAuthority’s sovereign immunity solely because the Authority was statutorily\n\nauthorized to engage Brown & Gay’s services and would have been immune had\n\nit performed those services itself.”44\n\n      In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Hecht cited the language in section\n\n452.0561 (which is substantially similar to section 452.056) as an example of\n\nwhen an independent contractor may act as the government, “in effect becoming\n\nthe government for limited purposes.”45 Chief Justice Hecht opined that in that\n\n\nsection); Dallas Area Rapid Transit v.

Cammerino.47 The court in that case made several\n\nholdings that are relevant to the issues in this case. Castro, an employee of a\n\nDallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) contractor, was driving a DART bus when he\n\nstruck Cammerino.48 When Cammerino sued him, Castro argued that he was\n\nentitled to the damages cap under TTCA section 101.106.49\n\n      The court construed the version of the TTCA in effect at the time, which\n\nprovided that an “employee” under that Act meant “a person, including an officer\n\nor agent, who is in the paid service of the governmental unit by competent\n\nauthority, but does not include an independent contractor . . . or employee of an\n\nindependent contractor.”50 The court then looked at section 452.056 and article\n\n6550d of the revised civil statutes.51 The court held that under those provisions,\n\n\n      46\n           Id.\n      47\n           186 S.W.3d 671 (Tex.

The court held that because DART would not have been\n\nliable for the property damage at issue in the case, then, under section 452.056,\n\nneither was DART’s independent contractor.58 This opinion was distinguished by\n\nthe Dallas court in the appeal after remand in the Eby case.59 In Eby II, the court\n\ndeclined to revisit its prior holding in Eby I that section 452.056 did not give\n\nLAN/STV immunity.60\n\n      Finally, the Houston Fourteenth Court of Appeals discussed the section in\n\n2014 in Belehu v.

Thus, Rodriguez’s claims against\n\nMTI and MTA appear to be based on those entities’ performance of a function of\n\nFWTA.        Accordingly, MTI’s liability would be capped under the TTCA at\n\n$100,000, as would MTA’s liability. Rodriguez’s potential damages under the\n\nTTCA are limited to $300,000, and she may recover up to that amount, assuming\n\nof course that she can establish the liability of each entity and the damages\n\ncaused by each.\n\n      In their brief, the transit defendants argue that this interpretation of the\n\napplicable statutes expands the tort liability of regional transportation systems.\n\n      69\n           See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.023(b).\n      70\n         See Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 452.056(d); Eby I, 205 S.W.3d at 20\n(deciding whether the contractor had immunity from liability based on an analysis\nof the function it performed and not based on the characterization of the plaintiff’s\nclaim).\n\n\n                                         21\n\fBut even under our reading of the applicable statutes, FWTA is not liable for\n\nmore than $100,000 no matter how many defendants Rodriguez successfully\n\nsues in this wrongful death action.        And without the language in section\n\n452.056(d), there would be no limitation to the amount that Rodriguez could\n\nrecover against MTI and MTA. The section, however, caps their liability. This\n\nreading does not expand the tort liability of regional transportation systems.\n\n      The transit defendants further argue that Rodriguez does not address the\n\ncontract among the transit defendants that invoked the transportation code and\n\nthe TTCA.     They say that “Rodriguez’s argument runs afoul not only of the\n\nstatute, but it also contravenes the portions of the agreement between the parties\n\nwhich adopt the tort liability protections authorized by the Legislature.”       Our\n\nholding is consistent with the language in the agreement, which adopts the\n\nlanguage of the transportation code and recognizes the liability limit of MTI and\n\nMTA under the transportation code. We decline to read the transportation code\n\nas giving a regional transportation authority to confer onto a private contractor\n\nmore limited liability than the legislature has provided.\n\n      Next the transit defendants assert that the legislature’s use of the word\n\n“only” in the phrase “only to the extent” in section 452.056 means that damage\n\ncaps cannot be stacked to recover up to $100,000 each from a regional\n\ntransportation entity and its independent contractors. They argue that this court\n\nrejected stacking in Crossland.\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\f      The transit defendants assert that in Crossland, the Department of\n\nHighways and the Parks Department “were distinct governmental units\n\nperforming independent governmental functions,” and this court capped their\n\ncombined liability at $100,000. But those entities were not “distinct governmental\n\nunits” for purposes of liability limits; they were both departments of the State of\n\nTexas, and a judgment against either would be a judgment against the State.71\n\nThus, the combined damages against those two departments could not exceed\n\nthe liability cap applicable to the State.72 As we stated above, we did not hold in\n\nCrossland that a plaintiff may not recover more than $100,000 in a suit against\n\nmultiple entities with liability limits under the TTCA, no matter how many\n\ngovernmental entities are defendants. And in this case, a judgment against MTI\n\nor MTA is not a judgment against FWTA. Crossland does not help the transit\n\ndefendants.\n\n      Because we have held that the $100,000 cap applies to MTI and to MTA,\n\neven if Rodriguez prevails on her claims against them, neither will be liable for\n\nmore than that amount. And assuming that Rodriguez establishes the liability of\n\neach entity, the most that she may recover from all three defendants in total is\n\n$300,000.\n\n\n      71\n        Crossland, 781 S.W.2d at 438 (stating that under the jury’s verdict, “the\nState of Texas was liable for $297,250 (45% for Parks and Wildlife Department\nplus 30% for the Highway Department)”).\n      72\n           See id. (holding that the State’s liability was capped at $100,000).\n\n\n                                           23\n\f      The transit defendants also repeat arguments from their summary\n\njudgment motion that “[i]t is hard to fathom that the Legislature intended unlimited\n\nliability of regional transportation authorities based upon the number of\n\nindependent contractors that are necessary to execute its governmental\n\nfunctions” and that Rodriguez’s proposed construction of the relevant statutes\n\n“fails in any way to shield the public from unlimited exposure.”\n\n      The Supreme Court of Texas stated in Brown & Gay that “[s]overeign\n\nimmunity has never been defended as a mechanism to avoid any and all\n\nincreases in public expenditures.”73 The doctrine “was designed to guard against\n\nthe ‘unforeseen expenditures’ associated with the government’s defending\n\nlawsuits and paying judgments ‘that could hamper government functions’ by\n\ndiverting funds from their allocated purposes.”74          The court stated that\n\n“[i]mmunizing a private contractor in no way furthers this rationale,” and “private\n\ncompanies can and do manage their risk exposure by obtaining insurance.”75\n\n      Further, regardless of the consideration that the legislature may have given\n\nto the number of independent contractors FWTA would need to execute its\n\nfunctions, this argument does not address the issues in this case.

Our\n\nreading of the statutes at issue does not subject regional transportation\n\nauthorities or their independent contractors to unlimited exposure.\n\n      We sustain this part of Rodriguez’s first issue.\n\nVaughn’s Employment Status\n\n      In the part of the transit defendants’ summary judgment motion addressing\n\nthe claims against Vaughn, Vaughn asserted several arguments for why she\n\nshould be treated as the employee of a governmental unit and therefore\n\ndismissed under the election of remedies provision of TTCA section 101.106.\n\nFirst, she distinguished Castro, arguing that Castro construed the former version\n\nof section 101.106, and that, since then, the legislature had completely rewritten\n\nthat section and had greatly enhanced the protection of employees performing\n\ngovernmental functions.\n\n      The part of Castro to which Vaugh refers is its holding that the caps in the\n\nTTCA on government liability “are not transmitted to the ‘employees’ of the\n\ngovernmental unit or the ‘employees’ of the independent contractor.”76 The court\n\nnoted that governmental employees were not left unprotected because, under\n\nthe then-effective version of section 101.106, “‘[a] judgment in an action or a\n\nsettlement of a claim under [the TTCA] bars any action involving the same\n\n\n\n\n      76\n           Castro, 186 S.W.3d at 678.\n\n\n                                        25\n\fsubject matter by the claimant against the employee of the governmental unit\n\nwhose act or omission gave rise to the claim.’”77\n\n      The court considered “[p]ivotal” the fact that “the employees of\n\nindependent contractors are not included in former section 101.106, and they are\n\nspecifically excluded from the definition of an ‘employee’ under the [TTCA].”78\n\nThe court held that, “[a]ccordingly, the statutory framework providing the ‘damage\n\ncaps’ and the ‘bar’ does not include the employees of independent contractors of\n\ngovernmental units.”79\n\n      Vaughn stated in her summary judgment motion that the former version of\n\nsection 101.106 applied only after a judgment or settlement had been reached\n\nwith a governmental entity. “In essence, that was the limited holding of Castro;\n\nnamely, [the former version of section 101.106] did not apply to protect the driver\n\nin that case because no prior judgment or settlement existed.” And, she argued,\n\nplaced in this context, Castro was not dispositive of Vaughn’s fate in this case.\n\nThus, Castro was limited “to being a historical anachronism.”\n\n      Vaughn further argued that Castro was “plainly wrong” when it concluded\n\nthere was no language in the transportation code supporting the bus driver’s\n\nclaim of derivative governmental immunity. She pointed to section 452.056(d),\n\n\n      77\n           Id.\n      78\n           Id.\n      79\n           Id.\n\n\n                                        26\n\fstating that the legislature’s use of the word “except” in that subsection “is a\n\nstatement of legislative intent.” She argues, “[t]he only reason the word ‘except’\n\nis in the statute is to activate the Legislature’s desire to treat ‘independent\n\ncontractors’ under the statute as ‘public entities’ for the purpose of tort claim\n\nlimits.”\n\n       Finally, Vaughn asserted that the Supreme Court of Texas’s Franka v.\n\nVelasquez80 is a “sweeping decision embracing the concept of derivative\n\nsovereign immunity.” She stated that Franka holds that a court may look to\n\nstatutes outside the TTCA to determine if an employee can be considered a\n\ngovernment employee for purposes of TTCA section 101.106. The trial court in\n\nthis case agreed with Vaughn, and it granted summary judgment for Vaughn and\n\ndismissed Rodriguez’s claims against her.\n\n       In Rodriguez’s brief, she argues that Vaughn was not entitled to have her\n\nclaims dismissed under section 101.106 because there is no dispute that Vaughn\n\nwas, at all material times, the employee of a private contractor of FWTA, and her\n\nliability was therefore not capped. She counters Vaughn’s characterization of\n\nCastro by stating that the actual basis for the court’s conclusion in Castro is\n\n“explicitly clear”—that employees of independent contractors are not included in\n\nsection 101.106. She states that the Castro court specifically said that its holding\n\ndid not depend on whether the transit authority had first been found liable.\n\n\n       80\n            332 S.W.3d 367 (Tex. 2011).\n\n\n                                          27\n\f      Rodriguez further argues that, as amended, section 101.106 still applies to\n\nonly employees of governmental units, and the TTCA’s definition of “employee”\n\nstill does not include an independent contractor’s employee. She states that\n\nFranka does not support Vaughn’s point about looking outside the TTCA to\n\ndetermine whether a person is a governmental entity’s employee because, unlike\n\nthe extra-TTCA statute relied on by Vaughn, the statute in Franka specifically set\n\nout when the category of employee to which the defendant belonged would be\n\nconsidered an employee of a state agency for purposes of determining liability.\n\n      We agree with Rodriguez. As noted by the transit defendants, in Castro,\n\nthe court construed the prior version of the TTCA section 101.106. However,\n\nCastro’s analysis was unaffected by the statute’s amendment. The opinion’s\n\nholdings depend on the same statutory provisions that we rely on—transportation\n\ncode section 452.046(d) and the definition of “employee” in the TTCA.81 Under\n\nthe version of the TTCA applicable to Rodriguez’s claims, section 101.106\n\napplies to employees of a governmental unit, and the definition of “employee”\n\nunder the chapter specifically excludes the employees of independent\n\ncontractors,82 just like in Castro. Accordingly, Vaughn is not an employee of a\n\ngovernmental unit, and section 101.106 does not apply to her.\n\n\n\n      81\n           Castro, 186 S.W.3d at 678–79.\n      82\n       Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.106(a), (e), (f); see also id. §\n101.001(2) (defining “employee”).\n\n\n                                           28\n\f      The word “except” in transportation code section 452.056(d) does not alter\n\nour determination that Vaughn is not a governmental unit’s employee under the\n\nTTCA.       The statute does not state that a transportation authority’s private\n\ncontractor is not a public entity unless it performs a function of the authority. It\n\nstates that an independent contractor is not a public entity, except that such an\n\nentity is liable for damages to the extent that the authority would be liable if it\n\nwere performing the function.83 In other words, a contractor of a transportation\n\nauthority is not a public entity, but whatever limits of liability apply to a transit\n\nauthority, those same limits apply to an independent contractor when that\n\ncontractor performs the functions of the authority.\n\n      To see the statutes in the proper light, we note that governmental units\n\nhave immunity from suit and liability, except to the extent that immunity is\n\nwaived.84     The TTCA is a limited waiver of that immunity, in that it waives\n\nimmunity from suit for some claims and immunity from liability up to a certain\n\namount. On the other hand, independent contractors of governmental units do\n\nnot have immunity from suit or from liability, except to the extent that immunity is\n\nconferred upon them by the legislature. Transportation code section 452.056(d)\n\nis a limited conferment of immunity from liability, such that independent\n\ncontractors have no more immunity than the regional transportation authority with\n\n\n      83\n           Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 452.056(d).\n      84\n           Rusk State Hosp. v. Black, 392 S.W.3d 88, 93 (Tex. 2012).\n\n\n                                         29\n\fwhich they have contracted would have to the extent they perform a function of\n\nthat authority.85 Dictating that courts treat an entity the same way for liability\n\npurposes that a governmental unit would be treated is not the same as making\n\nan entity itself a governmental unit, such that its employees are employees of a\n\ngovernmental unit.\n\n      Further support for our reading of the relevant statutes comes from the\n\nTTCA’s unambiguous instruction that the employee of a governmental unit’s\n\ncontractor is not an employee of a government unit.86 If an authority’s contractor\n\nwere a governmental unit, then its employee would be the employee of a\n\ngovernmental unit.\n\n      We also agree with Rodriguez that Franka is of no help to Vaughn. In that\n\ncase, as Vaughn said, the court looked at a statute outside of the TTCA to see if\n\nthe employee in question was an employee of a governmental unit for purposes\n\nof section 101.106.87      The employee in the case was a medical resident\n\nemployed by one governmental unit and paid by a different governmental unit.88\n\nThe statute outside the TTCA that the court looked to was a provision in the\n\n\n      85\n         Cf. Eby 1, 205 S.W.3d at 20 (rejecting the defendant contractor’s\ninterpretation of the transportation code, which would have placed the contractor\nin a better position than the authority with which it had contracted).\n      86\n           Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.001(2).\n      87\n           Franka, 332 S.W.3d at 374.\n      88\n           Id. at 373.\n\n\n                                        30\n\fhealth and safety code that explicitly provided that a medical unit or supported\n\nmedical school is a state agency, and further provided that a resident of a\n\nmedical unit or supported medical school “is an employee of a state agency for\n\npurposes of . . . determining the liability, if any, of the person for the person’s acts\n\nor omissions while engaged in the coordinated or cooperative activities of the\n\nunit.”89\n\n       Transportation code section 452.056(d), on the other hand, does not make\n\nan independent contractor’s employee the employee of a governmental unit. It\n\ndoes not mention employees at all. That section therefore does not override the\n\nprovisions of the TTCA that exclude independent contractors’ employees from\n\nthe definition of “employee” under the TTCA. And the statute at issue in Franka\n\nsupports our decision because it shows that the legislature knows how to\n\ndesignate an entity as a governmental unit and to designate an employee as an\n\nemployee of a governmental unit for purposes of liability. Vaughn did not show\n\nher entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the claims\n\nagainst her should be dismissed under TTCA section 101.106.\n\n       We sustain the second part of Rodriguez’s first issue. Having done so, we\n\ndo not consider her alternative argument under the open courts provision of the\n\nTexas Constitution.90\n\n\n       89\n       Id. at 373–74 (quoting Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 312.007(a)\n(West 2010)).\n       90\n            See Tex. Const. art. I, § 13.\n\n\n                                            31\n\f         2. The denial of Rodriguez’s motion for summary judgment\n\n      In Rodriguez’s second issue, she argues that the trial court erred by\n\ndenying her motion for partial summary judgment.           In her motion, Rodriguez\n\nincluded as summary judgment grounds that the TTCA’s liability limits apply\n\nseparately to each defendant and that liability against Vaughn is not capped. On\n\nappeal, Rodriguez asserts that the trial court erred by not granting partial\n\nsummary judgment on these grounds. She asks this court to render a partial\n\njudgment making those two declarations and also declaring that she is entitled to\n\nrecover the $100,000 tendered by MTI in satisfaction only of MTI’s liability to her\n\nand that she have and recover judgment from MTI in that amount. Given our\n\ndisposition of Rodriguez’s first issue, we sustain her second issue as to the\n\nquestions of liability caps and Vaughn’s potential liability.\n\n      As for the second part of this issue, the record does not indicate that\n\nRodriguez is entitled to the relief she requests.       In Rodriguez’s petition, she\n\nalleged that the transit defendants had waived any right to relief under the\n\ninterpleader action and that their interpleader action was barred by limitations. In\n\nher motion for summary judgment, Rodriguez asserted that MTI had not\n\nunconditionally tendered funds into the registry of the court, that, as a matter of\n\nlaw, it was not an innocent, disinterested stakeholder, and that MTI’s interpleader\n\nclaims were barred by limitations. She further sought a no-evidence summary\n\njudgment on MTI’s claim for interpleader. But she also asserted that because\n\nMTI had acknowledged and admitted its liability of $100,000, she was entitled to\n\n\n                                          32\n\fhave that amount awarded to her.           Because the trial court granted the\n\ninterpleader, she essentially asks us to affirm that part of the trial court’s\n\njudgment against MTI.\n\n      While MTI did not contest liability in its initial interpleader petition, in the\n\namended petition adding the other transit defendants, the transit defendants took\n\na different position. They asserted that Rodriguez’s claims were defensible, but if\n\nthe trial court accepted the interpleader and dismissed all of the claims against\n\nthem, they would choose not to put up a defense.            In essence, the transit\n\ndefendants made a settlement offer. That is, their willingness to pay $100,000\n\nwithout a trial on liability or damages was contingent on the trial court accepting\n\ntheir terms—that among them they would pay no more than $100,000 total, and\n\nthat, upon that payment, the claims against all of the transit defendants would be\n\ndismissed. Setting aside the question of whether the nature of MTI’s attempted\n\ninterpleader met the requirements for an interpleader—an issue contested in the\n\ntrial court—the conditions for the transit defendants’ offer have not been met.\n\n      The trial court’s judgment accepting the interpleader was based on the trial\n\ncourt’s acceptance of the transit defendant’s position that the caps cannot be\n\nstacked and that Vaughn and the other transit defendants were entitled to be\n\ndismissed from the suit. Rodriguez has not accepted those terms, and we have\n\nagreed with her that under the law she is not limited to $100,000 total. We\n\ncannot render judgment as requested by Rodriguez because we reversed the\n\njudgment of interpleader and the liability of MTI has not been established. We do\n\n\n                                         33\n\fnot address whether interpleader is available to the transit defendants.91\n\nRodriguez did not raise it as an issue on appeal, and such a holding is not\n\nnecessary to our disposition. We overrule this part of Rodriguez’s second issue.\n\n     3. The denial of trial and appellate fees for the transit defendants\n\n      In the transit defendants’ cross-issue, they argue that a trial court may not\n\nignore expert evidence of reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and award\n\n$0 in trial and appellate fees after properly granting an interpleader.        In its\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court concluded that the transit\n\ndefendants had failed to segregate their fees. The court further concluded that\n\nalthough the transit defendants were required to put on evidence to support their\n\nbilling under the lodestar method, they had not done so.92\n\n\n\n      91\n          See Tex. R. Civ. P. 43 (providing the right of interpleader when a person\nis or may be exposed to double or multiple liability); Tex. Lab. Code Ann. §\n417.001 (providing for subrogation); Franks, 936 S.W.2d at 960–61 (construing\nsection 417.001 and its predecessor and stating that between the injured\nemployee and the worker’s compensation carrier, there is but one claim\nbelonging to the employee, and that a carrier may recover for benefits it has paid,\nbut damages recovered over that amount belong to the employee).

She argues that the transit defendants did not establish that\n\nthey are innocent, disinterested stakeholders,93 did not unconditionally tender the\n\ninterpleader fund into the registry of the trial court,94 were not exposed to double\n\nor multiple liability,95 unreasonably delayed filing the interpleader action,96 and\n\npresented insufficient evidence to require any award of attorney’s fees.97 She\n\nfurther argues that MTI voluntarily attempted to subject itself to double or multiple\n\n\n\n\n      93\n         See United States v.

Tex. Commerce Bank, 660 S.W.2d 151, 153 (Tex.\nApp.—Fort Worth 1983, no writ) (“An interpleader suit is authorized by Rule\n43 . . . when a stakeholder ‘is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability.’”).\n      96\n        See Hanzel, 80 S.W.3d at 173 (stating that the elements of an\ninterpleader action include that “the party has not unreasonably delayed filing an\naction for interpleader”).\n      97\n           See Enzo Invs., 468 S.W.3d at 653.\n\n\n                                         35\n\fliability by intervening as a defendant in Insurance’s suit.98 Insurance similarly\n\nargues that the transit defendants were not entitled to attorney’s fees because\n\nthey were required but failed to segregate their fees, that they failed to present\n\nproper evidence to support an award of attorney’s fees, and that they are the\n\nnegligent parties or responsible for the conduct of a negligent party that caused\n\nthe damages sought by Rodriguez and Insurance.99\n\n      As we have said, the transit defendants offered the $100,000 on the\n\ncondition that the trial court find that liability against them was capped and that\n\nVaughn was an employee of a governmental unit entitled to dismissal. The trial\n\ncourt granted summary judgment on those bases, and we have held that the trial\n\ncourt erred by doing so. Because we have reversed the trial court’s summary\n\njudgment granting the interpleader, we cannot say that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying the requested trial and appellate attorney’s fees for the\n\ntransit defendants.\n\n      Further, the trial court was correct that the transit defendants did not\n\nprovide sufficient evidence of the work they had done up to that point to support\n\ntheir requested fees. The Supreme Court of Texas has held that “generalities\n\nabout tasks performed provide insufficient information for the fact finder to\n\n      98\n         Brown v.

When asked about what\n\nother tasks the attorney took before Insurance nonsuited its claims, the attorney\n\ntestified that he made phone calls and sent letters to Rodriguez’s attorney. That\n\nattorney could not say how many phone calls because he did not have his bill in\n\nfront of him. He could not answer how many hours he spent on Insurance’s suit\n\nbetween the filing of the interpleader and Insurance’s dismissal because “[he]\n\n[did not] have [his] bills in front of [him].” The transit defendants’ other attorney\n\nalso testified, but his testimony was no more specific than that of the first\n\nattorney. No other evidence in the record before the trial court provided evidence\n\nof the time spent on specific tasks.\n\n      This case illustrates the Supreme Court of Texas’s statements in El Apple\n\nthat while time records or billing statements are not required to establish a\n\nlodestar fee, “in all but the simplest cases, the attorney would probably have to\n\nrefer to some type of record or documentation to provide” the information\n\nrequired to establish a lodestar fee.104 The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\n\n      104\n            El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763.\n\n\n                                           38\n\fby not awarding attorney’s fees to the transit defendants.

We render declaratory judgment that the tort-liability limits applicable\n\nto FWTA, MTA, and MTI apply separately to each defendant and that the\n\npotential tort liability of Vaughn is not capped under the TTCA. We remand this\n\ncase for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  /s/ Lee Ann Dauphinot\n                                                  LEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n                                                  JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, WALKER, and MEIER, JJ.\n\nWALKER, J. and MEIER, J., concur without opinion.\n\nDELIVERED: June 23, 2016\n\n\n\n\n                                       39\n\f",

Background\n\n      This appeal is from two consolidated lawsuits arising out of the death of\n\nRodriguez’s mother, Judith Peterson. Peterson was struck and killed by a bus\n\ndriven by Vaughn. Vaughn is an employee of MTI. MTI and MTA are both\n\nindependent contractors of FWTA. Cross-Appellee New Hampshire Insurance\n\nCompany (Insurance) paid worker’s compensation death benefits to Rodriguez.\n\n      Rodriguez filed a wrongful death suit against the transit defendants in the\n\n153rd District Court of Tarrant County. In a separate suit against only FWTA and\n\nVaughn, Insurance brought claims in subrogation for negligent entrustment and\n\nrespondeat superior.2 Insurance filed its suit in the 67th District Court of Tarrant\n\nCounty.\n\n      In Insurance’s suit, MTI filed a petition in intervention and interpleader.\n\nMTI stated that it had been sued by Rodriguez and that it would not deny its\n\n      2\n        See Tex.

Franks, 936 S.W.2d at 960–61 (stating that while a worker’s\ncompensation carrier may assert its subrogation claim independently of the\nemployee to whom worker’s compensation benefits have been paid, the\nemployee could intervene in the subrogation suit and recover any damages\nexceeding the benefits the insurer had paid or was obligated to pay).\n\n\n                                          4\n\f$100,000 shared among all four defendants. This amended interpleader petition\n\nasserted that Rodriguez’s claims were defensible, but they would not defend\n\nagainst them if the court accepted their interpleader to resolve all of Rodriguez’s\n\nclaims.\n\n      Both sides filed motions for partial summary judgment.         In the transit\n\ndefendants’ motion, they reiterated their arguments that a single limit of $100,000\n\napplied to Rodriguez’s wrongful death claim, and they asserted that Vaughn was\n\nentitled to be dismissed under the TTCA as an employee of a governmental unit.\n\n      Rodriguez filed an amended petition for a declaratory judgment that FWTA,\n\nMTI, and MTA each had a liability limit of $100,000 and that Vaughn’s liability was\n\nnot limited. In her response to the transit defendants’ summary judgment motion,\n\nRodriguez acknowledged that the liability limits of the TTCA applied, but she\n\ndisagreed that the TTCA capped the total from all defendants at a combined total of\n\n$100,000. She argued that the interpleader was improper and must be denied.\n\n      In Rodriguez’s motion for partial summary judgment, she asserted that\n\nthere was no evidence that MTI had unconditionally tendered funds into the\n\nregistry of the court, that it was exposed to double liability, or that it was an\n\ninnocent, disinterested stakeholder. She asserted the same grounds, among\n\nothers, framed as traditional summary judgment grounds. And she asked for a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the liability limits in the TTCA applied separately to\n\nFWTA, MTA, and MTI, and that Vaughn’s liability was not limited by the TTCA.\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f      The trial court denied Rodriguez’s motion for partial summary judgment and\n\ngranted that of the transit defendants.      In its order granting partial summary\n\njudgment for the transit defendants, the trial court granted the requested\n\ninterpleader and dismissed all claims against the transit defendants. It found that\n\nthe claims against Vaughn should be dismissed based on section 101.106(b) of the\n\nTTCA6 and that Rodriguez’s total amount of recovery against all of the defendants\n\ncumulatively was no more than $100,000 under the TTCA.\n\n      After a hearing, the trial court denied the transit defendants’ request for\n\nattorney’s fees.    It then rendered a final judgment that further ordered that\n\nRodriguez recover $100,000 after the exhaustion of all appeals and dismissing\n\nRodriguez’s claims with prejudice.\n\n                                  B. Discussion\n\n          1. The grant of summary judgment for the transit defendants\n\n      In Rodriguez’s first issue, she asserts that the trial court erred by granting\n\nthe transit defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment. Under this issue,\n\nshe argues that the tort-liability limits applicable to multiple defendants apply\n\nseparately to each defendant and that Vaughn is not an employee of a\n\ngovernmental unit under the TTCA.\n\n\n\n\n      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>\n          <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

They contended that their argument was supported by\n\na unanimous line of case authority. In support of these contentions, the transit\n\ndefendants cited transportation code subsections 452.0561(c) and 452.056(d),\n\nas well as a Fifth Circuit case28 holding that those sections’ “only to the extent”\n\nlanguage gives derivative sovereign immunity to independent contractors of\n\nregional transportation authorities.\n\n      In Rodriguez’s brief, she directs our attention to the text of the TTCA to\n\nargue that the liability limitation in the TTCA applies individually and separately to\n\neach governmental unit sued, rather than collectively.

Cooksey,36 a case that the transit\n\ndefendants had relied on in their motion.          She states that in Cooksey, the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas recognized that the plaintiff could have recovered more\n\nfrom a defendant city if the plaintiff had given the city proper notice of the claims.\n\nIn that case, the court stated that “[w]hen one person is injured or killed, and one\n\nplaintiff brings suit [against the State], the applicable limit of liability is $100,000,”\n\nand “[t]hat limit should not change simply because the deceased is survived by\n\ntwo or more statutory beneficiaries under the wrongful death statute.”37             The\n\ncourt held that the phrase “per person” in the predecessor to section 101.023\n\n“refers to the person or persons who sustain injury.”38 Thus, in a suit against the\n\nState for the death of one person, the State cannot be held liable for more than\n\n$100,000 regardless of the number of plaintiffs in the suit.39\n\n\n      34\n           Id.\n      35\n           Id.\n      36\n           </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2409058\"><a href=\"/opinion/2409058/city-of-austin-v-cooksey/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1978).\n      37\n           Id. at 387–88.\n      38\n           Id. at 388.\n      39\n           See id.\n\n\n                                           13\n\f      The court in Cooksey did not affirmatively hold that, but for the lack of\n\nnotice, the plaintiffs could have recovered against both the State and the city.\n\nWe therefore do not agree with Rodriguez’s reading of the case.             But as\n\nRodriguez stated in her brief, the only reason discussed by the court for why the\n\nplaintiff could not recover against the city was that the plaintiff had not provided\n\nproper notice.40 The court’s holding that the plaintiffs’ damages were limited was\n\nbased on how the statutory limit applies in a wrongful death case with multiple\n\nplaintiffs. The court did not address how to cap a plaintiff’s damages in a case\n\nwith multiple defendants, each with limited liability. Thus, Rodriguez is correct\n\nthat the case does not support the transit defendants’ position.\n\n      Rodriguez then looks at transportation code section 452.056(d) and\n\nasserts that, because under that provision MTI and MTA are liable to the extent\n\nthat FWTA would be, they each may be liable for an amount up to the same cap\n\nthat applies to FWTA. Rodriguez states that it is undisputed that FWTA is a\n\nregional transportation authority, and thus FWTA, MTI, and MTA may each be\n\nheld liable for damages up to the cap applicable to FWTA.\n\n      In their motion for partial summary judgment, the transit defendants cited\n\nboth section 452.056 and section 452.0561 in support of their arguments. As\n\nnoted above, section 452.056 applies only to regional transportation authorities\n\n\n\n\n      40\n           Id.\n\n\n                                        14\n\fcreated under chapter 452 or its predecessor, and section 452.0561 applies to\n\ndifferent kinds of transportation entities.\n\n      The transit defendants did not produce any evidence that FWTA is a\n\ntransportation entity covered by section 452.0561. Their summary judgment\n\nevidence included FWTA’s contract with MTI and MTA, and that contract stated\n\nthat MTI and MTA “are independent contractors of the FWTA, as that term is\n\ndefined or understood pursuant to § 452.056(d)” of the transportation code.\n\n[Emphasis added.] And in support of their motion, they pointed to a case in\n\nwhich the Supreme Court of Texas referred to FWTA as a regional transportation\n\nauthority.41   Because the summary judgment evidence indicated that section\n\n452.056 applied, and because the transit defendants did not establish the\n\napplicability of section 452.0561 and specifically relied on a case indicating that\n\nsection 452.056 applies, summary judgment could only have been granted on\n\nthe basis of section 452.056, not section 452.0561. Our review of the summary\n\njudgment is therefore limited to consideration of section 452.056.\n\n      We have found only nine Texas cases citing section 452.056.

Thus, Rodriguez’s claims against\n\nMTI and MTA appear to be based on those entities’ performance of a function of\n\nFWTA.        Accordingly, MTI’s liability would be capped under the TTCA at\n\n$100,000, as would MTA’s liability. Rodriguez’s potential damages under the\n\nTTCA are limited to $300,000, and she may recover up to that amount, assuming\n\nof course that she can establish the liability of each entity and the damages\n\ncaused by each.\n\n      In their brief, the transit defendants argue that this interpretation of the\n\napplicable statutes expands the tort liability of regional transportation systems.\n\n      69\n           See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.023(b).\n      70\n         See Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 452.056(d); Eby I, 205 S.W.3d at 20\n(deciding whether the contractor had immunity from liability based on an analysis\nof the function it performed and not based on the characterization of the plaintiff’s\nclaim).\n\n\n                                         21\n\fBut even under our reading of the applicable statutes, FWTA is not liable for\n\nmore than $100,000 no matter how many defendants Rodriguez successfully\n\nsues in this wrongful death action.        And without the language in section\n\n452.056(d), there would be no limitation to the amount that Rodriguez could\n\nrecover against MTI and MTA. The section, however, caps their liability. This\n\nreading does not expand the tort liability of regional transportation systems.\n\n      The transit defendants further argue that Rodriguez does not address the\n\ncontract among the transit defendants that invoked the transportation code and\n\nthe TTCA.     They say that “Rodriguez’s argument runs afoul not only of the\n\nstatute, but it also contravenes the portions of the agreement between the parties\n\nwhich adopt the tort liability protections authorized by the Legislature.”       Our\n\nholding is consistent with the language in the agreement, which adopts the\n\nlanguage of the transportation code and recognizes the liability limit of MTI and\n\nMTA under the transportation code. We decline to read the transportation code\n\nas giving a regional transportation authority to confer onto a private contractor\n\nmore limited liability than the legislature has provided.\n\n      Next the transit defendants assert that the legislature’s use of the word\n\n“only” in the phrase “only to the extent” in section 452.056 means that damage\n\ncaps cannot be stacked to recover up to $100,000 each from a regional\n\ntransportation entity and its independent contractors. They argue that this court\n\nrejected stacking in Crossland.\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\f      The transit defendants assert that in Crossland, the Department of\n\nHighways and the Parks Department “were distinct governmental units\n\nperforming independent governmental functions,” and this court capped their\n\ncombined liability at $100,000. But those entities were not “distinct governmental\n\nunits” for purposes of liability limits; they were both departments of the State of\n\nTexas, and a judgment against either would be a judgment against the State.71\n\nThus, the combined damages against those two departments could not exceed\n\nthe liability cap applicable to the State.72 As we stated above, we did not hold in\n\nCrossland that a plaintiff may not recover more than $100,000 in a suit against\n\nmultiple entities with liability limits under the TTCA, no matter how many\n\ngovernmental entities are defendants. And in this case, a judgment against MTI\n\nor MTA is not a judgment against FWTA. Crossland does not help the transit\n\ndefendants.\n\n      Because we have held that the $100,000 cap applies to MTI and to MTA,\n\neven if Rodriguez prevails on her claims against them, neither will be liable for\n\nmore than that amount. And assuming that Rodriguez establishes the liability of\n\neach entity, the most that she may recover from all three defendants in total is\n\n$300,000.\n\n\n      71\n        Crossland, 781 S.W.2d at 438 (stating that under the jury’s verdict, “the\nState of Texas was liable for $297,250 (45% for Parks and Wildlife Department\nplus 30% for the Highway Department)”).\n      72\n           See id. (holding that the State’s liability was capped at $100,000).\n\n\n                                           23\n\f      The transit defendants also repeat arguments from their summary\n\njudgment motion that “[i]t is hard to fathom that the Legislature intended unlimited\n\nliability of regional transportation authorities based upon the number of\n\nindependent contractors that are necessary to execute its governmental\n\nfunctions” and that Rodriguez’s proposed construction of the relevant statutes\n\n“fails in any way to shield the public from unlimited exposure.”\n\n      The Supreme Court of Texas stated in Brown & Gay that “[s]overeign\n\nimmunity has never been defended as a mechanism to avoid any and all\n\nincreases in public expenditures.”73 The doctrine “was designed to guard against\n\nthe ‘unforeseen expenditures’ associated with the government’s defending\n\nlawsuits and paying judgments ‘that could hamper government functions’ by\n\ndiverting funds from their allocated purposes.”74          The court stated that\n\n“[i]mmunizing a private contractor in no way furthers this rationale,” and “private\n\ncompanies can and do manage their risk exposure by obtaining insurance.”75\n\n      Further, regardless of the consideration that the legislature may have given\n\nto the number of independent contractors FWTA would need to execute its\n\nfunctions, this argument does not address the issues in this case. Under the\n\nconstruction we have applied, FWTA, MTI, and MTA will not be subject to\n\n\n      73\n           Brown & Gay, 461 S.W.3d at 123.\n      74\n           Id.\n      75\n           Id.\n\n\n                                         24\n\funlimited liability, given that a statutory cap on liability applies to them. Our\n\nreading of the statutes at issue does not subject regional transportation\n\nauthorities or their independent contractors to unlimited exposure.\n\n      We sustain this part of Rodriguez’s first issue.\n\nVaughn’s Employment Status\n\n      In the part of the transit defendants’ summary judgment motion addressing\n\nthe claims against Vaughn, Vaughn asserted several arguments for why she\n\nshould be treated as the employee of a governmental unit and therefore\n\ndismissed under the election of remedies provision of TTCA section 101.106.\n\nFirst, she distinguished Castro, arguing that Castro construed the former version\n\nof section 101.106, and that, since then, the legislature had completely rewritten\n\nthat section and had greatly enhanced the protection of employees performing\n\ngovernmental functions.\n\n      The part of Castro to which Vaugh refers is its holding that the caps in the\n\nTTCA on government liability “are not transmitted to the ‘employees’ of the\n\ngovernmental unit or the ‘employees’ of the independent contractor.”76 The court\n\nnoted that governmental employees were not left unprotected because, under\n\nthe then-effective version of section 101.106, “‘[a] judgment in an action or a\n\nsettlement of a claim under [the TTCA] bars any action involving the same\n\n\n\n\n      76\n           Castro, 186 S.W.3d at 678.\n\n\n                                        25\n\fsubject matter by the claimant against the employee of the governmental unit\n\nwhose act or omission gave rise to the claim.’”77\n\n      The court considered “[p]ivotal” the fact that “the employees of\n\nindependent contractors are not included in former section 101.106, and they are\n\nspecifically excluded from the definition of an ‘employee’ under the [TTCA].”78\n\nThe court held that, “[a]ccordingly, the statutory framework providing the ‘damage\n\ncaps’ and the ‘bar’ does not include the employees of independent contractors of\n\ngovernmental units.”79\n\n      Vaughn stated in her summary judgment motion that the former version of\n\nsection 101.106 applied only after a judgment or settlement had been reached\n\nwith a governmental entity. “In essence, that was the limited holding of Castro;\n\nnamely, [the former version of section 101.106] did not apply to protect the driver\n\nin that case because no prior judgment or settlement existed.” And, she argued,\n\nplaced in this context, Castro was not dispositive of Vaughn’s fate in this case.\n\nThus, Castro was limited “to being a historical anachronism.”\n\n      Vaughn further argued that Castro was “plainly wrong” when it concluded\n\nthere was no language in the transportation code supporting the bus driver’s\n\nclaim of derivative governmental immunity. She pointed to section 452.056(d),\n\n\n      77\n           Id.\n      78\n           Id.\n      79\n           Id.\n\n\n                                        26\n\fstating that the legislature’s use of the word “except” in that subsection “is a\n\nstatement of legislative intent.” She argues, “[t]he only reason the word ‘except’\n\nis in the statute is to activate the Legislature’s desire to treat ‘independent\n\ncontractors’ under the statute as ‘public entities’ for the purpose of tort claim\n\nlimits.”\n\n       Finally, Vaughn asserted that the Supreme Court of Texas’s Franka v.\n\nVelasquez80 is a “sweeping decision embracing the concept of derivative\n\nsovereign immunity.” She stated that Franka holds that a court may look to\n\nstatutes outside the TTCA to determine if an employee can be considered a\n\ngovernment employee for purposes of TTCA section 101.106. The trial court in\n\nthis case agreed with Vaughn, and it granted summary judgment for Vaughn and\n\ndismissed Rodriguez’s claims against her.\n\n       In Rodriguez’s brief, she argues that Vaughn was not entitled to have her\n\nclaims dismissed under section 101.106 because there is no dispute that Vaughn\n\nwas, at all material times, the employee of a private contractor of FWTA, and her\n\nliability was therefore not capped. She counters Vaughn’s characterization of\n\nCastro by stating that the actual basis for the court’s conclusion in Castro is\n\n“explicitly clear”—that employees of independent contractors are not included in\n\nsection 101.106. She states that the Castro court specifically said that its holding\n\ndid not depend on whether the transit authority had first been found liable.\n\n\n       80\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895288\"><a href=\"/opinion/895288/franka-v-velasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011).\n\n\n                                          27\n\f      Rodriguez further argues that, as amended, section 101.106 still applies to\n\nonly employees of governmental units, and the TTCA’s definition of “employee”\n\nstill does not include an independent contractor’s employee. She states that\n\nFranka does not support Vaughn’s point about looking outside the TTCA to\n\ndetermine whether a person is a governmental entity’s employee because, unlike\n\nthe extra-TTCA statute relied on by Vaughn, the statute in Franka specifically set\n\nout when the category of employee to which the defendant belonged would be\n\nconsidered an employee of a state agency for purposes of determining liability.\n\n      We agree with Rodriguez. As noted by the transit defendants, in Castro,\n\nthe court construed the prior version of the TTCA section 101.106. However,\n\nCastro’s analysis was unaffected by the statute’s amendment. The opinion’s\n\nholdings depend on the same statutory provisions that we rely on—transportation\n\ncode section 452.046(d) and the definition of “employee” in the TTCA.81 Under\n\nthe version of the TTCA applicable to Rodriguez’s claims, section 101.106\n\napplies to employees of a governmental unit, and the definition of “employee”\n\nunder the chapter specifically excludes the employees of independent\n\ncontractors,82 just like in Castro. Accordingly, Vaughn is not an employee of a\n\ngovernmental unit, and section 101.106 does not apply to her.\n\n\n\n      81\n           Castro, 186 S.W.3d at 678–79.\n      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span>\n       <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The statute does not state that a transportation authority’s private\n\ncontractor is not a public entity unless it performs a function of the authority. It\n\nstates that an independent contractor is not a public entity, except that such an\n\nentity is liable for damages to the extent that the authority would be liable if it\n\nwere performing the function.83 In other words, a contractor of a transportation\n\nauthority is not a public entity, but whatever limits of liability apply to a transit\n\nauthority, those same limits apply to an independent contractor when that\n\ncontractor performs the functions of the authority.\n\n      To see the statutes in the proper light, we note that governmental units\n\nhave immunity from suit and liability, except to the extent that immunity is\n\nwaived.84     The TTCA is a limited waiver of that immunity, in that it waives\n\nimmunity from suit for some claims and immunity from liability up to a certain\n\namount. On the other hand, independent contractors of governmental units do\n\nnot have immunity from suit or from liability, except to the extent that immunity is\n\nconferred upon them by the legislature.

It\n\ndoes not mention employees at all. That section therefore does not override the\n\nprovisions of the TTCA that exclude independent contractors’ employees from\n\nthe definition of “employee” under the TTCA. And the statute at issue in Franka\n\nsupports our decision because it shows that the legislature knows how to\n\ndesignate an entity as a governmental unit and to designate an employee as an\n\nemployee of a governmental unit for purposes of liability. Vaughn did not show\n\nher entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the claims\n\nagainst her should be dismissed under TTCA section 101.106.\n\n       We sustain the second part of Rodriguez’s first issue. Having done so, we\n\ndo not consider her alternative argument under the open courts provision of the\n\nTexas Constitution.90\n\n\n       89\n       Id. at 373–74 (quoting Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 312.007(a)\n(West 2010)).\n       90\n            See Tex. Const. art. I, § 13.\n\n\n                                            31\n\f         2. The denial of Rodriguez’s motion for summary judgment\n\n      In Rodriguez’s second issue, she argues that the trial court erred by\n\ndenying her motion for partial summary judgment.           In her motion, Rodriguez\n\nincluded as summary judgment grounds that the TTCA’s liability limits apply\n\nseparately to each defendant and that liability against Vaughn is not capped. On\n\nappeal, Rodriguez asserts that the trial court erred by not granting partial\n\nsummary judgment on these grounds. She asks this court to render a partial\n\njudgment making those two declarations and also declaring that she is entitled to\n\nrecover the $100,000 tendered by MTI in satisfaction only of MTI’s liability to her\n\nand that she have and recover judgment from MTI in that amount. Given our\n\ndisposition of Rodriguez’s first issue, we sustain her second issue as to the\n\nquestions of liability caps and Vaughn’s potential liability.\n\n      As for the second part of this issue, the record does not indicate that\n\nRodriguez is entitled to the relief she requests.       In Rodriguez’s petition, she\n\nalleged that the transit defendants had waived any right to relief under the\n\ninterpleader action and that their interpleader action was barred by limitations. In\n\nher motion for summary judgment, Rodriguez asserted that MTI had not\n\nunconditionally tendered funds into the registry of the court, that, as a matter of\n\nlaw, it was not an innocent, disinterested stakeholder, and that MTI’s interpleader\n\nclaims were barred by limitations. She further sought a no-evidence summary\n\njudgment on MTI’s claim for interpleader. But she also asserted that because\n\nMTI had acknowledged and admitted its liability of $100,000, she was entitled to\n\n\n                                          32\n\fhave that amount awarded to her.           Because the trial court granted the\n\ninterpleader, she essentially asks us to affirm that part of the trial court’s\n\njudgment against MTI.\n\n      While MTI did not contest liability in its initial interpleader petition, in the\n\namended petition adding the other transit defendants, the transit defendants took\n\na different position. They asserted that Rodriguez’s claims were defensible, but if\n\nthe trial court accepted the interpleader and dismissed all of the claims against\n\nthem, they would choose not to put up a defense.            In essence, the transit\n\ndefendants made a settlement offer. That is, their willingness to pay $100,000\n\nwithout a trial on liability or damages was contingent on the trial court accepting\n\ntheir terms—that among them they would pay no more than $100,000 total, and\n\nthat, upon that payment, the claims against all of the transit defendants would be\n\ndismissed. Setting aside the question of whether the nature of MTI’s attempted\n\ninterpleader met the requirements for an interpleader—an issue contested in the\n\ntrial court—the conditions for the transit defendants’ offer have not been met.\n\n      The trial court’s judgment accepting the interpleader was based on the trial\n\ncourt’s acceptance of the transit defendant’s position that the caps cannot be\n\nstacked and that Vaughn and the other transit defendants were entitled to be\n\ndismissed from the suit. Rodriguez has not accepted those terms, and we have\n\nagreed with her that under the law she is not limited to $100,000 total. We\n\ncannot render judgment as requested by Rodriguez because we reversed the\n\njudgment of interpleader and the liability of MTI has not been established. We do\n\n\n                                         33\n\fnot address whether interpleader is available to the transit defendants.91\n\nRodriguez did not raise it as an issue on appeal, and such a holding is not\n\nnecessary to our disposition. We overrule this part of Rodriguez’s second issue.\n\n     3. The denial of trial and appellate fees for the transit defendants\n\n      In the transit defendants’ cross-issue, they argue that a trial court may not\n\nignore expert evidence of reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and award\n\n$0 in trial and appellate fees after properly granting an interpleader.        In its\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court concluded that the transit\n\ndefendants had failed to segregate their fees. The court further concluded that\n\nalthough the transit defendants were required to put on evidence to support their\n\nbilling under the lodestar method, they had not done so.92\n\n\n\n      91\n          See Tex.

App.—\nAmarillo 1981, writ dism’d) (“When an interpleading party is responsible for the\nconflicting claims to the funds, the party is not entitled to attorneys’ fees incurred\nin interpleading the claimants.”).\n      99\n           See id.\n\n\n                                         36\n\fmeaningfully review whether the tasks and hours were reasonable and\n\nnecessary under the lodestar method.”100 An attorney requesting fees under the\n\nlodestar method is not required to introduce his time sheets or billing records.101\n\nBut what is required is, “at a minimum, evidence ‘of the services performed, who\n\nperformed them and at what hourly rate, when they were performed, and how\n\nmuch time the work required.’”102 An attorney’s evidence of fees is insufficient if\n\nthe attorney fails to provide evidence of the time devoted to specific tasks.103\n\n      At the hearing on attorney’s fees, one of the transit defendants’ attorneys\n\nwas asked if he was basing his fee request on the lodestar method.                 He\n\nanswered, “I assume so.”         Insurance’s attorney then asked him a series of\n\nquestions about what specific tasks he had worked on and how long those tasks\n\nhad taken.\n\n      First Insurance’s attorney asked the transit defendants’ attorney about the\n\ntime he had spent preparing the interpleader.\n\n      Q. How long did that take?\n\n      A. How long did what take?\n\n      Q. Preparing the interpleader.\n\n      100\n            Long v.

The pleading itself? I don’t have the bill in front of me, but—\n\n      Q. You don’t [know] how long that task took?\n\n      A. Well, it took a number of hours to research the applicability of the\n      impleader and to put the pleading together.\n\n      Q. But you can’t give me a specific number as we sit here today?\n\n      A. I don’t have it in front of me, no.\n\n      The rest of the attorney’s testimony was similar. When asked about what\n\nother tasks the attorney took before Insurance nonsuited its claims, the attorney\n\ntestified that he made phone calls and sent letters to Rodriguez’s attorney. That\n\nattorney could not say how many phone calls because he did not have his bill in\n\nfront of him. He could not answer how many hours he spent on Insurance’s suit\n\nbetween the filing of the interpleader and Insurance’s dismissal because “[he]\n\n[did not] have [his] bills in front of [him].” The transit defendants’ other attorney\n\nalso testified, but his testimony was no more specific than that of the first\n\nattorney. No other evidence in the record before the trial court provided evidence\n\nof the time spent on specific tasks.\n\n      This case illustrates the Supreme Court of Texas’s statements in El Apple\n\nthat while time records or billing statements are not required to establish a\n\nlodestar fee, “in all but the simplest cases, the attorney would probably have to\n\nrefer to some type of record or documentation to provide” the information\n\nrequired to establish a lodestar fee.104 The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\n\n      104\n            El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at 763.\n\n\n                                           38\n\fby not awarding attorney’s fees to the transit defendants. We overrule the transit\n\ndefendants’ sole issue.\n\n                                 C. Conclusion\n\n      Having overruled the transit defendants’ sole issue, and having sustained\n\nRodriguez’s first issue and her second issue in part, we reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment. We render declaratory judgment that the tort-liability limits applicable\n\nto FWTA, MTA, and MTI apply separately to each defendant and that the\n\npotential tort liability of Vaughn is not capped under the TTCA. We remand this\n\ncase for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  /s/ Lee Ann Dauphinot\n                                                  LEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n                                                  JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, WALKER, and MEIER, JJ.\n\nWALKER, J. and MEIER, J., concur without opinion.\n\nDELIVERED: June 23, 2016\n\n\n\n\n                                       39\n\f</pre>",
