After entering into the elementary school parking lot, the buses pull into the bus lane.  The first and second buses park bumper to bumper. Directly behind the tail end of the second bus is a crosswalk. Buses do not park on the crosswalk.  The third bus leaves a space behind the second bus and parks without covering the crosswalk.

Two yellow lines and a large blue handicap symbol are painted on the pavement directly opposite the sidewalk cutout.

Children and staff coming from this parking area are \"expected to cross\" at the crosswalk.  Teachers or personnel act as safety patrol in the crosswalk area.</p>\n<p>Haynal testified that the bumper to bumper parking of the third and fourth buses completely blocks the sidewalk cutout. When Haynal's bus was in the fourth position she refused to park bumper to bumper with the third bus.
