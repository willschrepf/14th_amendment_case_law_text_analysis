(“WHM”) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (“Exxon”) and dismissing\n\nappellant’s pattern and practice discrimination claims against WHM and Exxon with\n\nprejudice for lack of jurisdiction; (2) granting summary judgment in favor of WHM on\n\nappellant’s claims for discrimination, retaliation, and defamation; (3) granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Exxon on appellant’s claims for discrimination, retaliation,\n\ndefamation, negligence, and tortious interference with a contract; and (4) granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of appellee DISA, Inc. (“DISA”) on appellant’s claims for\n\ndefamation, negligence, tortious interference with a contract, and breach of contract.\n\n       For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the trial court erred in the\n\nfollowing respects: (1) dismissing appellant’s pattern and practice discrimination claims\n\nagainst WHM and Exxon for lack of jurisdiction; and (2) granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of DISA on appellant’s negligence and tortious interference with a contract claims.\n\nWe overrule appellant’s other issues. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is\n\naffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       This is an employment-related case involving, among other things, a dispute over\n\nthe accuracy of a workplace drug test and allegations of discrimination based on race or\n\nnational origin. As set forth below, the issues in this case are hotly disputed. The\n\nfollowing facts are not in dispute.\n\n       On April 10, 2008, DISA selected appellant for a random drug test. The parties\n\nagree that, at that time, appellant was employed by WHM and that WHM had engaged\n\nthe services of DISA for purposes of administering its drug and alcohol policy.\n\nAppellant maintains that he was also employed by Exxon, but Exxon denies any\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\femployment relationship. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that appellant worked for WHM\n\nat a facility in Baytown, Texas that is owned and operated by Exxon.\n\n      On April 14, 2008, WHM’s human resources manager, Mark Carter, informed\n\nappellant that there was a “problem” with his test and that he could not return to work for\n\nWHM or be assigned to work at Exxon facilities until he was “active” in DISA.\n\nSubsequently, appellant learned that he had allegedly failed his drug test because his\n\nurine sample allegedly tested positive for marijuana use. Appellant denies that he used\n\nmarijuana, denies that his urine sample tested positive, and denies that he failed his\n\ndrug test. As set forth below, appellant took a second drug test, conducted by a second\n\nfacility, and the second test was negative for marijuana use. Appellant informed DISA\n\nand WHM of his second test.                Nevertheless, appellant’s DISA status remained\n\n“inactive,” and he was not assigned further work.\n\n      On or about August 17, 2008, appellant filed for unemployment benefits with the\n\nTexas Workforce Commission (“TWC”). In September 2008, appellant received a letter\n\nfrom the TWC denying benefits on the basis that his employment with WHM had been\n\nterminated for drug use. On or about November 24, 2008, appellant filed a charge of\n\ndiscrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and the\n\nTexas Workforce Commission Civil Rights Division (“TWC-CRD”). Appellant named\n\nWHM and Exxon as his employers. On May 26, 2009, appellant received a “Notice of\n\nRight to File Civil Action” letter from the TWC-CRD dated May 21, 2009.\n\n      Thereafter, appellant filed suit against WHM, Exxon, DISA, and others.2\n\nAppellant asserted claims against WHM for discrimination, retaliation, and defamation.\n\nAppellant asserted claims against Exxon for discrimination, retaliation, defamation,\n      2\n          WHM, Exxon, and DISA are the only appellees before the Court in this matter.\n\n                                                   3\n\fnegligence, and tortious interference with a contract. Appellant asserted claims against\n\nDISA for defamation, negligence, and tortious interference with a contract. In his fifth\n\namended petition, appellant also asserted a claim against DISA for breach of contract.\n\n       On March 23, 2010, the trial court granted Exxon’s no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment on appellant’s discrimination, retaliation, and defamation claims. On\n\nMarch 23, 2010, the trial court also granted Exxon’s traditional motion for summary\n\njudgment on appellant’s discrimination, retaliation, and defamation claims.             On\n\nNovember 16, 2010, the trial court entered the following orders:\n\n          (1) order granting Exxon and DISA’s motion to strike appellant’s fifth\n              amended original petition;\n\n          (2) order granting WHM and Exxon’s motion to dismiss;\n\n          (3) order granting DISA’s motion for summary judgment;\n\n          (4) order granting Exxon’s traditional and no-evidence motion for\n              summary judgment on all claims; and\n\n          (5) order granting WHM’s traditional and no-evidence motion for\n              summary judgment.\n\nThe trial court did not state the basis for any of its rulings. Appellant non-suited all\n\nclaims that were not dismissed by the trial court. This appeal ensued.\n\n                    II. PATTERN AND PRACTICE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS\n\n       In his first issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his\n\npattern and practice discrimination claims against WHM and Exxon for lack of\n\njurisdiction.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       The Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (“TCHRA”) “is modeled after\n\nfederal law with the purpose of executing the policies set forth in Title VII of the federal\n\n                                             4\n\fCivil Rights Act of 1964.” Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Zeltwanger, 144 S.W.3d 438, 445\n\n(Tex. 2004) (citing Green v. Indus. Specialty Contractors, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 126, 131 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.)). The TCHRA requires a complainant to first\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies before filing a civil action. Lueck v. State, 325\n\nS.W.3d 752, 761 (Tex. App.—Austin 2010, pet. denied).                    Failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies creates a jurisdictional bar to suit.        Schroeder v. Tex. Iron\n\nWorks, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 483, 488 (Tex. 1991). A subsequent suit “is limited to the\n\ncomplaints made in the discrimination charge and factually related claims that could\n\nreasonably be expected to grow out of the Commission’s investigation of the charge.”\n\nJohnson v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 127 S.W.3d 875, 878 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n2004, no pet.).\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\n        A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea that seeks to defeat a cause of action\n\nby questioning the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction and should be decided “without\n\ndelving into the merits of the case.” Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554\n\n(Tex. 2000). Subject matter jurisdiction is at the heart of a court’s power to decide a\n\ncase.    See id.   “We review a trial court’s order granting or denying a plea to the\n\njurisdiction de novo.” Houston Mun. Employees Pension Sys. v. Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d\n\n151, 156 (Tex. 2007). In our review, we examine the plaintiff’s petition and evidence\n\nsubmitted by the parties “to the extent it is relevant to the jurisdictional issue.” Id.\n\n        When a trial court’s decision concerning a plea to the jurisdiction is based on the\n\nplaintiff’s pleadings, we accept as true all factual allegations in the pleadings to\n\ndetermine if the plaintiff has met its burden to plead facts sufficient to confer jurisdiction\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fon the court. Dallas Area Rapid Transit v. Whitley, 104 S.W.3d 540, 542 (Tex. 2003).\n\nWe examine the pleader’s intent and construe the pleadings in the plaintiff’s favor.\n\nCounty of Cameron v. Brown, 80 S.W.3d 549, 555 (Tex. 2002); Tex. Dep't of Transp. v.\n\nRamirez, 74 S.W.3d 864, 867 (Tex. 2002) (per curiam). A plea to the jurisdiction may\n\nbe granted without allowing the plaintiff to amend if the pleadings affirmatively negate\n\nthe existence of jurisdiction. Brown, 80 S.W.3d at 555; Ramirez, 74 S.W.3d at 867.\n\nC. Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n       In his live petition, appellant alleged a claim for pattern and practice\n\ndiscrimination as follows:\n\n       Plaintiff Gilberto Rincones asserts and intends to prove that the treatment\n       received by him from the Defendants WHM and EXXON was part of a\n       pattern and practice engaged in by the Defendant employers and their\n       employees towards several individuals similarly situated. This unwritten\n       plan or scheme was to discriminate against, retaliate against, discharge or\n       take some adverse employment action against Plaintiff and other similarly\n       situated Hispanics of Mexican heritage/decent, thereby creating a hostile\n       work environment.\n\nAttached to appellant’s live petition was a copy of his charge of discrimination, filed with\n\nthe EEOC and TWC-CRD, which stated in relevant part as follows:\n\n       I am a 37 year old Hispanic male who worked for WHM since 2007. While\n       working with WHM, I was assigned to work for Exxon, under their direction\n       and control as a Technician. I was a loyal, hardworking, and dedicated\n       employee at all times. As a requirement to work at Exxon, I was required\n       to take a drug test. On April 10, 2008, I was given a random drug test by\n       Turn Around Incorporated, along with other non-Hispanic employees.\n       Thereafter, I was terminated due to allegedly being tested positive for drug\n       use, even though I told my employers that the test was mixed up or false.\n       On April 14, 2008, I went to a lab where I paid for a test to be done, with\n       my own money, which was negative, I provided this information to my\n       employers and complained that other non Hispanic employees were\n       treated differently because they were retested or allowed to prove the test\n       was wrong. However, I was refused my position. I feel I am being\n       discriminated against because I am Hispanic.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       I believe that I was discriminated against because of my race in the\n       manner described above, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n       1964, as amended; and in violation of the Texas Commission on Human\n       Right[s] Act, and retaliat[ed] against for reporting the harassment and\n       discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as\n       amended, and in violation of the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act.\n\nD. WHM’s and Exxon’s Motion to Dismiss\n\n       In their motion to dismiss, WHM and Exxon argued that the trial court lacked\n\njurisdiction with respect to appellant’s pattern and practice discrimination claims:\n\n       In his pleadings, Plaintiff Gilberto Rincones alleges, among other things,\n       that he was the victim of a purported unidentified pattern and practice of\n       discrimination towards Hispanics generally. However, prior to bringing suit\n       for alleged employment discrimination, all Plaintiffs are required to meet\n       certain statutory prerequisites, such as filing a written, sworn complaint\n       with the Texas Commission of Human Rights, now the Texas Workforce\n       Commission – Civil Rights Division (“TWC-CRD”), and exhausting the\n       administrative procedures of the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act\n       (“TCHRA”). The prerequisites also require that the charge filed identify\n       the particular acts of discrimination alleged.\n\n       Here, Plaintiff . . . failed to comply with the statutory mandate of filing a\n       charge with the TWC-CRD as to his alleged pattern and practice claim.\n       Although Plaintiff partially met the requirements by filing a charge, his\n       charge specifically fails to include facts or allegations that present a\n       “pattern and practice” claim of discrimination. Rather, Plaintiff’s charge\n       only alleges individual discrimination (as opposed to alleging facts that an\n       employer treats a class of individuals in this manner). Accordingly,\n       Plaintiff’s failure to file a charge alleging facts relating to a pattern and\n       practice of discrimination deprives this Court of subject matter jurisdiction\n       over his alleged “pattern and practice” cause of action. Therefore, the\n       Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s claim concerning any alleged pattern and\n       practice of discriminatory conduct based on a lack of subject matter\n       jurisdiction.\n\nE. Appellant’s Response to WHM and Exxon’s Motion to Dismiss\n\n       In his response, appellant argued that there was no merit to the jurisdictional\n\nchallenge made by WHM and Exxon:\n\n       Defendants Exxon and WHM seek to have Plaintiff’s discrimination claims\n       dismissed alleging that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear such\n\n                                             7\n\f      claims because Plaintiff did not use the term “pattern and practice” in the\n      Charge. Because the Charge was sufficient to put Defendants Exxon and\n      WHM on notice of Plaintiff’s discrimination claims and the basis for same\n      (e.g. race/national origin discrimination against Plaintiff, a Hispanic\n      employee), he is entitled to bring all claims reasonably expected to grow\n      from the scope of the agency’s investigation into the Plaintiff’s allegations\n      to the TWC-CRD. As such, Defendants[’] motion to dismiss must be\n      denied.\n\n      Appellant also argued as follows:\n\n      There is no question that Plaintiff’s charge made allegations of improper\n      and discriminatory conduct in regards to the Defendants[’] drug testing\n      policy because he is Hispanic. The evidence developed to date and on\n      file with this Court is clear that non-Hispanic employees were treated\n      differently and allowed to gain “active” status and continue to work in\n      regards to the drug policy, while Plaintiff, a Hispanic individual, was not\n      allowed to regain “active” [status] and was ultimately fired. An EEOC\n      investigation of whether other Hispanics were discriminated against in\n      regards to the implementation of the drug testing policy could reasonably\n      grow out of these [sic] investigation. Therefore, as the 5th Circuit and\n      Texas appellate courts have consistently ruled, Plaintiff’s allegations in the\n      Charge of Discrimination, in and of itself, are sufficient to provide the trial\n      court jurisdiction regarding the allegations or theories which may prove\n      discrimination, including pattern and practice allegations.\n\nF. Discussion of WHM’s and Exxon’s Motion to Dismiss\n\n      As set forth above, a lawsuit under the TCHRA “is limited to the complaints made\n\nin the discrimination charge and factually related claims that could reasonably be\n\nexpected to grow out of the Commission’s investigation of the charge.” Johnson, 127\n\nS.W.3d at 878.    In this case, we conclude that appellant’s claims for pattern and\n\npractice discrimination are factually related to his claims for discrimination based on\n\nrace and national origin. In his charge, appellant alleged that non-Hispanic employees\n\nwere being treated differently. This allegation suggests a group-wide discriminatory\n\npractice in which non-Hispanic employees were treated more favorably than Hispanic\n\nemployees.    Therefore, we conclude that the trial court has jurisdiction to hear\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fappellant’s pattern and practice discrimination claims because they are “factually related\n\nclaims that could reasonably be expected to grow out of the Commission’s investigation\n\nof the charge.” Id.\n\n       Accordingly, appellant’s first issue is sustained.\n\n                         III. DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS AGAINST WHM\n\n       In his second issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of WHM on his claims for discrimination based on race or\n\nnational origin.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color,\n\ndisability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n   (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n       discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\n       compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n   (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment\n       in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any\n       employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the status\n       of an employee.\n\nTEX. LABOR CODE ANN. § 21.051 (West 2006); see Waffle House, Inc. v. Williams, 313\n\nS.W.3d 796, 805 (Tex. 2010) (“The TCHRA contemplates discrimination affecting the\n\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment.”). “Subsection (1) concerns ‘disparate\n\ntreatment’ claims; subsection (2) concerns ‘disparate impact’ claims.” Nw. Res. Co. v.\n\nBanks, 4 S.W.3d 92, 93 (Tex. App.—Waco 1999, pet. denied). “[D]isparate-treatment\n\ndiscrimination addresses employment actions that treat an employee worse than others\n\nbased on the employee’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Ojo v. Farmers\n\nGroup, Inc., 356 S.W.3d 421, 426 (Tex. 2011) (quotations omitted). “In such disparate-\n\n                                              9\n\ftreatment cases, proof and finding of discriminatory motive is required.” Id. (quotations\n\nomitted). “[D]isparate impact claims . . . involve facially neutral practices that operate to\n\nexclude a disproportionate percentage of persons in a protected group and cannot be\n\njustified by business necessity.” Id. (quotations omitted).3 “The United States Supreme\n\nCourt has similarly distinguished between disparate treatment discrimination and\n\ndisparate impact discrimination, noting that the former is discrimination against others\n\nbecause of their race, while the latter encompasses practices that are facially neutral\n\nbut that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another.” Id. (citing Int’l Bhd. of\n\nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335–36 n.15 (1976)). The parties agree that\n\nthis case involves allegations of disparate treatment.\n\n        There are two types of employment discrimination claims involving disparate\n\ntreatment, “each requiring different elements of proof.” See Quantum Chem. Corp. v.\n\nToennies, 47 S.W.3d 473, 476 (Tex. 2001). “The first type is the ‘pretext’ case, in which\n\nthe plaintiff’s ultimate goal is to show that the employer’s stated reason for the adverse\n\naction was a pretext for discrimination.” Id. “The plaintiff can usually provide sufficient\n\nevidence of discriminatory intent by showing that the employer’s proffered reason for\n\nthe adverse action is false.” Id. “The second type of case is the ‘mixed-motive’ case, in\n\nwhich the plaintiff has direct evidence of discriminatory animus.”                   Id.   “This direct\n\nevidence shifts the burden of proof to the employer to show that legitimate reasons\n\nwould have led to the same decision regardless of any discriminatory motives.” Id.\n\n“[H]ow a case will be classified depends entirely upon the presence or absence of direct\n\n        3\n          See TEX. LABOR CODE ANN. § 21.122(a)(1) (West 2006) (“An unlawful employment practice\nbased on disparate impact is established under this chapter only if a complainant demonstrates that a\nrespondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race . . .\nand the respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job-related for the position in\nquestion and consistent with business necessity . . . .”).\n\n                                                   10\n\fevidence.” Id. “If the plaintiff has only circumstantial evidence of discrimination, it will\n\nbe classified as a pretext case regardless of how many motives the employer had.” Id.\n\nat 477. The parties agree that this is a pretext case.\n\nB. McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Analysis\n\n       “The [United States] Supreme Court defined the order and allocation of proof for\n\na pretext case in McDonnell Douglas and Burdine.” Id.; see Tex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs\n\nv. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n792, 802–05 (1973); Russo v. Smith Int’l, Inc., 93 S.W.3d 428, 438–39 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (“Texas courts invoke McDonnell Douglas in\n\nemployment discrimination cases brought under state law.”).             The United State\n\nSupreme Court has summarized the allocation of the burden of proof in employment\n\ndiscrimination cases as follows:\n\n       First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the\n       evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff\n       succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the\n       defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the\n       employee's rejection. Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the\n       plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the\n       evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its\n       true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\n\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 252–53 (quotations and citations omitted); see also Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc. v. Canchola, 121 S.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex. 2003) (“In discrimination cases that\n\nhave not been fully tried on the merits, we apply the burden-shifting analysis established\n\nby the United States Supreme Court.”).\n\n       “In discrimination cases brought under the TCHRA, a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination is made by showing that the plaintiff (1) is within a protected group, (2)\n\nwas adversely affected or suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) similarly\n\n                                            11\n\fsituated nonprotected class members were not treated similarly.” Herbert v. City of\n\nForest Hill, 189 S.W.3d 369, 375 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006, no pet.). Appellant’s\n\n“burden at this stage of the case is not onerous.” Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nGarcia, 372 S.W.3d 629, 634 (Tex. 2012). “The prima facie case raises an inference of\n\ndiscrimination only because we presume these acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more\n\nlikely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.” Id.\n\n       “After the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts\n\nto the employer to articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for any allegedly\n\nunequal treatment.”     Herbert, 189 S.W.3d at 375.        “If the defendant presents a\n\nlegitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the burden shifts back to the\n\nplaintiff to show either (1) the stated reason was a pretext for discrimination, or (2) the\n\ndefendant’s reason, while true, is only one reason, and discrimination was another,\n\n‘motivating,’ factor.” Gonzalez v. Champion Techs., Inc., 384 S.W.3d 462, 466 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.).          “A plaintiff demonstrates pretext by\n\nproducing evidence that (1) the reason given by the employer was not its true reason for\n\nthe employment action but rather a pretext for discrimination or (2) the reason given\n\nwas unworthy of credence.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Hines, 252 S.W.3d 496, 508 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied); see also Quantum Chem., 47 S.W.3d at\n\n476 (“The plaintiff can usually provide sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent by\n\nshowing that the employer’s proffered reason for the adverse action is false.”).\n\nC. Standard of Review\n\n       We review summary judgments de novo. Alejandro v. Bell, 84 S.W.3d 383, 390\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.).         In a traditional motion for summary\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fjudgment, the movant has the burden of showing both that there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c);\n\nsee also Swilley v. Hughes, 488 S.W.2d 64, 67 (Tex. 1972); Ortega v. City Nat’l Bank,\n\n97 S.W.3d 765, 772 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2003, no pet.). In deciding whether\n\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact, evidence favorable to the nonmovant is taken\n\nas true, and all reasonable inferences are made, and all doubts are resolved, in favor of\n\nthe nonmovant.     Am. Tobacco Co. v. Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex. 1997).\n\nSummary judgment is proper if the movant disproves at least one element of each of\n\nthe plaintiff’s claims or affirmatively establishes each element of an affirmative defense\n\nto each claim. Id.; see also Duvall v. Tex. Dep’t of Human Servs., 82 S.W.3d 474, 477\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 2002, no pet.) (“A defendant who moves for [traditional] summary\n\njudgment must disprove at least one essential element of the plaintiff’s causes of\n\naction.”). The nonmovant has no burden to respond to a traditional summary judgment\n\nmotion unless the movant conclusively establishes its cause of action or defense.\n\nSwilley, 488 S.W.2d at 68.\n\n      A no-evidence summary judgment is equivalent to a pretrial directed verdict, and\n\nwe apply the same legal sufficiency standard on review. Zapata v. Children's Clinic,\n\n997 S.W.2d 745, 747 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1999, pet. denied). We review the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, disregarding all contrary\n\nevidence and inferences. See Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye, 907 S.W.2d 497, 499\n\n(Tex. 1995); see also Buck v. Palmer, 381 S.W.3d 525, 527 (Tex. 2012) (“We must\n\nreview the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, indulging every\n\nreasonable inference and resolving any doubts against the motion.”). “A motion for\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\fsummary judgment must be granted if: (1) the moving party asserts that there is no\n\nevidence of one or more specified elements of a claim or defense on which the adverse\n\nparty would have the burden of proof at trial; and (2) the respondent produces no\n\nsummary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on those\n\nelements.” Sudan v. Sudan, 199 S.W.3d 291, 292 (Tex. 2006) (per curiam).\n\n       If the nonmovant produces evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact,\n\nsummary judgment is improper. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i); Buck, 381 S.W.3d at 527 n.2\n\n(“The ultimate question is simply whether a fact issue exists.”). All that is required of the\n\nnon-movant is to produce more than a scintilla of probative evidence to raise a genuine\n\nissue of material fact. Zapata, 997 S.W.2d at 747. “When the evidence offered to prove\n\na vital fact is so weak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or suspicion of its\n\nexistence, the evidence is no more than a scintilla and, in legal effect, is no evidence.”\n\nKindred v. Con/Chem, Inc., 650 S.W.2d 61, 63 (Tex. 1983). Conversely, more than a\n\nscintilla exists when the evidence “rises to a level that would enable reasonable and\n\nfair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.” Transp. Ins. Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W.2d\n\n10, 25 (Tex. 1994). The burden of producing evidence is entirely on the non-movant;\n\nthe movant has no burden to attach any evidence to the motion. See TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n166a(i). “Undisputed evidence may be conclusive of the absence of a material fact\n\nissue, but only if reasonable people could not differ in their conclusions as to that\n\nevidence.” Buck, 381 S.W.3d at 527.\n\n       WHM’s motion for summary judgment was a hybrid motion for summary\n\njudgment, raising five traditional and no-evidence grounds. Both WHM and appellant\n\nbrought forth summary judgment evidence in the context of this hybrid motion.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fTherefore, the “ultimate question is simply whether a fact issue exists.”                      Buck, 381\n\nS.W.3d at 527 n.2 (“Both parties brought forth summary judgment evidence in the\n\ncontext of this hybrid no-evidence and traditional motion, so the differing burdens of the\n\ntwo forms of summary judgment motion are of no import here. The ultimate question is\n\nsimply whether a fact issue exists.”).            For this Court to reach a final disposition of\n\nappellant’s second issue, it is only necessary to address the fifth ground for summary\n\njudgment asserted in WHM’s hybrid motion. Accordingly, our discussion of appellant’s\n\nsecond issue will be limited to that ground for summary judgment. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n47.1.4\n\nD. WHM’s Fifth Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n         The fifth ground for summary judgment raised in WHM’s hybrid motion for\n\nsummary judgment is the following:\n\n         To support a claim for disparate treatment as alleged by Plaintiff, he must\n         demonstrate that he was treated differently than other similarly situated\n         persons. In Texas, similarly situated is an exacting standard such that the\n         person used by a plaintiff to support his claim must be “nearly identical.”\n         To be “similarly situated,” Plaintiff must show that the circumstances are\n         comparable in all material respects, including the same conduct, same\n         personnel/supervisor, same job title of employee and same standards.\n\n         It is undisputed that WHM had no involvement in the selection of Plaintiff\n         of any person for random drug testing. Furthermore, Plaintiff has no\n         evidence that non-Hispanics were treated differently. Plaintiff only has\n         hearsay knowledge that some non-Hispanics failed a drug test, but no\n         knowledge as to the circumstances, job description, timing, whether the\n         persons continued working etc. Plaintiff cannot identify any persons to\n         support that non-Hispanics were treated differently in any manner by\n         WHM. Plaintiff cannot identify any other WHM employees that were\n         tested by DISA in April 2008. Plaintiff’s essential complaint is that WHM\n\n         4\n           Specifically, as a result of our holding with respect to WHM’s fifth ground for summary judgment,\nwe conclude that “[t]he issues presented [with respect to WHM’s other grounds] are [consequently] no\nlonger ‘live.’” Bd. of Adjustment of San Antonio v. Wende, 92 S.W.3d 424, 427 (Tex. 2002). Our decision\nmust be limited to only those issues “raised and necessary to final disposition of the appeal.” TEX. R. APP.\nP. 47.1.\n\n                                                    15\n\f      simply would not accept Plaintiff’s drug test result from a different, non-\n      DISA approved facility (San Benito Medical Associates) to continue\n      working for WHM at ExxonMobil Baytown. There is no evidence that\n      WHM or DISA or ExxonMobil has ever accepted such a test to substitute\n      for a positive DISA test. Moreover, the complaint is unrelated to any\n      allegations of race/national origin discrimination, and Plaintiff’s conclusory\n      allegations and subjective beliefs are not enough to defeat a properly\n      supported motion for summary judgment.\n\n      Alternatively, Plaintiff may be asserting that non-Hispanics have been\n      allowed to “retest.” However, WHM is not aware of any persons allowed\n      to retest. Simply put, WHMS’s Agreement with ExxonMobil requires that\n      all persons who work on ExxonMobil facilities be DISA active regardless of\n      race/national origin.     Therefore, the evidence shows that Plaintiff’s\n      allegations are without merit, and the Court should grant summary\n      judgment.\n\nIn addition, in its third ground for summary judgment, WHM also argued that there was\n\nno evidence (1) that any person was treated differently or (2) that DISA applied its\n\npolicies and procedures differently to appellant as opposed to any other person. We\n\nconstrue the foregoing as a no-evidence ground for summary judgment.\n\n      As set forth above, WHM argued that there was no evidence that similarly\n\nsituated nonprotected class members were not treated similarly. Specifically, WHM\n\nargued that “Plaintiff cannot identify any persons to support that non-Hispanics were\n\ntreated differently in any manner by WHM.” Thus, to avoid summary judgment, all that\n\nwas required of appellant, as the non-movant, was to produce more than a scintilla of\n\nprobative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether\n\nsimilarly situated nonprotected class members were not treated similarly. See Acosta v.\n\nGov’t Employees Credit Union, 351 S.W.3d 637, 641 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, no\n\npet.) (explaining that plaintiff “was required to establish, among other things, that she\n\nwas treated less favorably than a similarly situated non-Hispanic employee”).\n\nE. Appellant’s Response to WHM’s Fifth Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n                                           16\n\f      In his response, appellant argued that he “had identified at least 3 other non-\n\nHispanic employees who failed drug tests [and] were allowed to continue working for\n\nWHM at Exxon facilities.” In relevant part, appellant argued as follows:\n\n      Defendant alleges that there [is] no issue of fact regarding Plaintiff’s\n      random selection for drug testing. Plaintiff’s discrimination claim is not\n      based on his selection for drug testing; rather, Plaintiff alleges that\n      Plaintiff, a Hispanic employee of Mexican descent, was treated differently\n      than other, non-Hispanic employees who also tested positive for drugs.\n      For this reason, Plaintiff’s response will focus solely on why that is an\n      issue of material fact.\n\n      Plaintiff identified 3 different WHM employees that were allowed to\n      continue working for WHM after testing positive for drugs. Tom Davis and\n      Mark Sweet (both Anglo Males) and Cooper (Black Male). WHM points to\n      various aspects of Plaintiff’s deposition testimony in support of its position\n      that there is no evidence [of] retaliation; however, Plaintiff’s testimony was\n      clear that when he was told by WHM in April 2008 that he would have to\n      deal with DISA to “work it out,” he did as he was instructed. However,\n      DISA, the designated testing agent for WHM (and by contract EXXON),\n      refused to accept his San Benito test results or allow him to retest, in\n      violation of their own policies. Thereafter, he complained to Mark Carter\n      and 2 other WHM supervisors that WHM employees Davis, Sweet and\n      Cooper who failed the test were allowed to continue working for WHM.\n      Plaintiff was officially terminated approximately 6 months later.\n\n      Plaintiff testified that he complained to WHM that non-Hispanic employees\n      who failed a drug test[] were allowed to continue working after DISA failed\n      to assist him in resolving the issue and prior to his ultimate termination.\n      The affidavit of WHM employee attached as Exhibit “A” to WHM’s motion\n      confirms that Plaintiff complained off [sic] other employees [with] similar\n      situations, who happen to be non-Hispanic, although he denies that\n      Plaintiff mentioned race or national origin. Clearly, material fact issues\n      [exist] regarding Plaintiff’s discrimination claims, and the summary\n      judgment should be denied.\n\n      In its motion for summary judgment, WHM argued the following with respect to\n\nappellant’s testimony: “Importantly, Plaintiff admitted in his deposition that he has no\n\npersonal knowledge that other employees of WHM were treated differently and that his\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fknowledge regarding Tony Davis, or any other person, is based on ‘rumors or hearsay.’”\n\nWHM also argued the following:\n\n      Plaintiff alleges that two WHM employees, Tony Davis and Mark Sweet,\n      were allowed to retest to obtain an “active” DISA status. However it is\n      undisputed that Plaintiff’s allegation is based on rumor and hearsay\n      knowledge. Thus, there is no evidence that any person was treated\n      differently. . . .\n\n      Plaintiff has no evidence that non-Hispanics were treated differently.\n      Plaintiff only has hearsay knowledge that some non-Hispanics failed a\n      drug test, but no knowledge as to the circumstances, job description,\n      timing, whether the persons continued working, etc. Plaintiff cannot\n      identify any persons to support that non-Hispanics were treated differently\n      in any manner by WHM.\n\n      In his response, appellant clarified the nature of his evidence:\n\n      Plaintiff’s evidence is his own testimony. Plaintiffs [sic] have sought\n      relevant discovery to confirm Plaintiff’s allegation; however, Defendant\n      WHM has failed to provide discovery. Plaintiff has a motion to compel on\n      this issue pending with the Court.\n\nIn his response, appellant also stated as follows:\n\n      To be clear, Plaintiff also offers the evidence of the 3 non-Hispanic\n      employees who allegedly failed drug tests but [were] allowed to continue\n      working for WHM as other evidence . . . . However, because Defendants\n      have failed and/or refused to allow discovery regarding these 3\n      [e]mployees, [Plaintiff] can offer nothing more than his own testimony.\n\nF. WHM’s Written Objections to Appellant’s Summary Judgment Evidence\n\n      In addition to the arguments made in its motion for summary judgment, WHM\n\nalso filed objections to appellant’s summary judgment evidence on the following basis:\n\n      Plaintiff’s Response relies on the deposition testimony of Plaintiff, Gilberto\n      Rincones, to establish that other non-Hispanic persons who tested\n      positive were treated differently than Plaintiff (Hispanic) because they\n      were allowed to re-test or continue to work. Specifically, Defendant[]\n      object[]s to Plaintiff’s evidence in paragraph 22, page 15 that “Plaintiff\n      identified 3 different WHM employees that were allowed to continue\n      working for WHM after testing positive for drugs: Tom Davis and Mark\n      Sweet (both Anglo Males) and Cooper (Black Male).” Plaintiff’s purported\n\n                                            18\n\f      evidence is not competent summary judgment evidence as it is\n      inadmissible hearsay and lacks foundation. See TRE 802. See also\n      Plaintiff’s deposition page 210 - 213 (Plaintiff claims “he was told” others\n      tested positive but allowed to work).           The Court should sustain\n      Defendants’ objection and not consider Plaintiff’s evidence.\n\nG. Discussion of WHM’s Fifth Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n      We conclude that appellant’s testimony was not competent summary judgment\n\nevidence. “To constitute competent summary judgment evidence, the evidence must be\n\nadmissible.” Estate of Denman, 362 S.W.3d 134, 141 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011,\n\npet. denied). “[N]o difference obtains between the standards for evidence that would be\n\nadmissible in a summary judgment proceeding and those applicable at a regular trial.”\n\nUnited Blood Servs. v. Longoria, 938 S.W.2d 29, 30 (Tex. 1997) (per curiam). Appellant\n\ntestified to hearing an out-of-court statement by WHM’s human resources director, Mark\n\nCarter, to the effect that three other WHM employees had tested positive for drug use\n\nand were able to return to work. Appellant’s testimony based solely on his conversation\n\nwith Mark Carter is hearsay. See TEX. R. EVID. 801(d) (“Hearsay” is “a statement, other\n\nthan one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\n\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.”); Southland Corp. v. Lewis, 940\n\nS.W.2d 83, 85 (Tex. 1997) (“Mr. Long’s affidavit, which was based solely on his notes\n\nfrom the interview, is clearly inadmissible hearsay which was properly objected to by 7-\n\nEleven.   Accordingly, it is not competent summary judgment proof.”).         Hearsay is\n\ngenerally inadmissible. See TEX. R. EVID. 802 (“Hearsay is not admissible except as\n\nprovided by statute or these rules or by other rules prescribed pursuant to statutory\n\nauthority.”). Appellant’s testimony does not fit within any exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nTherefore, “[it] may not be made the basis of a summary judgment.” Youngstown Sheet\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f& Tube Co. v. Penn, 363 S.W.2d 230, 233 (Tex. 1962). We conclude that appellant’s\n\ntestimony was inadmissible hearsay.\n\n       Furthermore, the remainder of appellant’s testimony “is so weak as to do no\n\nmore than create a mere surmise or suspicion” that similarly situated nonprotected class\n\nmembers were not treated similarly. See Montemayor v. Ortiz, 208 S.W.3d 627, 648\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2007, pet. denied) (“The evidence is no more than a scintilla\n\nand, in legal effect, is no evidence when the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is so\n\nweak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or suspicion of its existence.”)\n\n(quotations omitted).   Appellant’s deposition testimony does not rise to a level that\n\nwould enable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach different conclusions. See id.\n\n(“Conversely, more than a scintilla exists when the evidence rises to a level that would\n\nenable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.”). The only\n\nconclusion that can be reached is that there is a complete absence of evidence of vital\n\nfacts involving the circumstances of the three employees that appellant alleges were\n\n“similarly situated.”   Therefore, appellant failed to meet his burden of producing\n\ncompetent summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact\n\nregarding whether similarly situated nonprotected class members were not treated\n\nsimilarly. See Herbert, 189 S.W.3d at 375. We conclude that summary judgment was\n\nappropriate on this basis. See Greathouse v. Alvin Indep. Sch. Dist., 17 S.W.3d 419,\n\n426 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.)          (“Summary judgment for the\n\ndefendant is proper when a plaintiff claiming race discrimination presents only\n\nconclusory allegations, improbable inferences, unsupportable speculation, or subjective\n\nbeliefs and feelings.”); see also Wadewitz v. Montgomery, 951 S.W.2d 464, 466 (Tex.\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\f1997) (“Conclusory statements . . . are insufficient to support or defeat summary\n\njudgment.”).\n\n      Appellant’s second issue is overruled.\n\n                           IV. RETALIATION CLAIM AGAINST WHM\n\n      In his third issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of WHM on his retaliation claim.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n      Section 21.055 of the Texas Labor Code provides as follows:\n\n      An employer, labor union, or employment agency commits an unlawful\n      employment practice if the employer, labor union, or employment agency\n      retaliates or discriminates against a person who, under this chapter:\n\n               (1) opposes a discriminatory practice;\n\n               (2) makes or files a charge;\n\n               (3) files a complaint; or\n\n               (4) testifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an\n               investigation, proceeding, or hearing.\n\nTEX. LABOR CODE ANN. § 21.055 (West 2006).\n\n      “A prima facie case of retaliation consists of the following elements: (1) the\n\nplaintiff engaged in a protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred;\n\nand (3) there was a causal connection between participation in the protected activity\n\nand the adverse employment decision.” West v. Maint. Tool & Supply Co., 89 S.W.3d\n\n96, 105 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.). “An employer’s action is an adverse\n\nemployment action for purposes of a retaliation claim when it is harmful to the point that\n\nit could dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of\n\ndiscrimination.” Cox v. Waste Mgmt. of Tex., Inc., 300 S.W.3d 424, 438 (Tex. App.—\n\n                                              21\n\fFort Worth 2009, pet. denied). “A plaintiff asserting a retaliation claim must establish\n\nthat, without his protected activity, the employer’s prohibited conduct would not have\n\noccurred when it did.” Herbert, 189 S.W.3d at 377. “That is, the plaintiff must establish\n\na ‘but for’ causal nexus between the protected activity and the employer’s prohibited\n\nconduct.” Id. “The plaintiff need not establish that the protected activity was the sole\n\ncause of the employer’s prohibited conduct.” Id. “The burden then shifts in the same\n\nmanner as it does with regard to discrimination claims.” Id.; see also Niu v. Revcor\n\nMolded Prods. Co., 206 S.W.3d 723, 730 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006, no pet.) (“A\n\nburden-shifting analysis, similar to the wrongful-discharge burden-shifting analysis,\n\napplies to retaliation claims.”).\n\nB. Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n       In his live petition, appellant alleged that the following occurred after he informed\n\nDISA and WHM of the negative results of the “San Benito” test:\n\n       Plaintiff further requested to be tested again, and/or inquired as to what\n       else needed to be done so that he could go back to work; however,\n       Defendants failed and/or refused his requests and failed to follow all the\n       Defendants[’] drug testing policies.\n\n       Plaintiff also complained that he was aware of other non-Hispanic\n       employees that were allowed to retest as a result of a false positive result\n       and allowed to return to work. Despite Plaintiff’s requests and complaints,\n       Defendants refused and/or failed to provide the opportunity to take\n       another drug test, and [as] a result[,] Defendants WHM and EXXON\n       refused to allow Plaintiff to return to work.\n\n       On or about September 11, 2008[,] Plaintiff learned for the first time that\n       he had been fired after testing positive for drug use. Plaintiff again\n       immediately contacted Defendants WHM and/or Exxon and again\n       complained that other non-Hispanic employees were treated differently\n       because they were either retested or allowed to prove the test was wrong,\n       and were not terminated. However, Plaintiff—a Hispanic-American of\n       Mexican descent/heritage—was refused this opportunity and was told he\n       had been fired.\n\n                                            22\n\f       ...\n\n       Mr. Rincones asserts that he was wrongfully and illegally retaliated against\n       following his opposition and complaint of discrimination.\n\nC. WHM’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n       In its motion for summary judgment, WHM argued as follows:\n\n       Plaintiff was randomly drug tested on April 10, 2008, and his only alleged\n       protected activity was that he complained to WHM on or about April 14,\n       2008. At that time, DISA and WHM informed Plaintiff that he was not\n       allowed to return to an ExxonMobil facility until he became “active” in\n       DISA.\n\n       However, Plaintiff admits that he never complained to WHM that the\n       random drug testing was discriminatory because of his race/national origin\n       (Hispanic). Plaintiff admits that he never “complained [to WHM] that other\n       non-Hispanic employees were being treated differently.” [P]laintiff testified\n       that he only complained to his lawyer. Rather, Plaintiff’s sole complaint at\n       the time was that he never used drugs and the test had to be wrong.\n       Having never complained or opposed any discriminatory practice of which\n       WHM was aware, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of\n       retaliation, and WHM is entitled to summary judgment.\n\n       Additionally, WHM first became aware of any complaint by Plaintiff\n       alleging any form of discrimination when it received the charge of\n       discrimination dated November 24, 2008. On this date, all of the alleged\n       adverse action—being selected for the testing, the test results and the\n       inability to return to work at an ExxonMobil facility—had already occurred\n       and cannot form the basis of any retaliation claim as a matter of law.\n\n       Finally, it is undisputed that WHM took no adverse action in response to\n       Plaintiff’s charge of discrimination. At the time the charge of discrimination\n       was received by WHM, Plaintiff still had the same inactive DISA status\n       and was “ineligible” to work on ExxonMobil property. Plaintiff’s status was\n       the same as it had been since the notification on April 14, 2008. Plaintiff\n       admits that he was not fired by WHM, and he just needed to obtain an\n       active status with DISA to work for WHM on ExxonMobil’s properties.\n       Accordingly, WHM took no adverse action against Plaintiff that can\n       support a claim for retaliation, and summary judgment should be granted.\n\nWe construe the foregoing as a traditional ground for summary judgment, challenging\n\nall three elements of appellant’s prima facie case of retaliation: (1) appellant engaged in\n\n                                            23\n\fa protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) there was a\n\ncausal connection between appellant’s participation in the protected activity and the\n\nadverse employment decision. See West, 89 S.W.3d at 105.\n\nD. WHM’s First Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n      In his live petition, appellant alleged two different protected activities:     (1)\n\nopposing disparate treatment; and (2) filing a charge of discrimination. “[O]pposition to\n\na discriminatory practice is a protected activity under the TCHRA.” Cox & Smith Inc. v.\n\nCook, 974 S.W.2d 217, 224 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied). “Under the\n\nfirst prong, to establish that the employee opposed a discriminatory practice, the\n\nemployee must demonstrate a good faith reasonable belief that the underlying\n\ndiscriminatory practice of the employer violated the law.” Id. “The employee is not\n\nrequired to show that there was actual existence of an unlawful practice, only that she\n\nheld a good faith reasonable belief that the employer engaged in activity made unlawful\n\nby Title VII or the TCHRA.” Id. “Second, the employee must demonstrate that she\n\nreported the challenged activity to the employer.” Id.\n\n      According to WHM, the summary judgment evidence establishes that appellant\n\nnever reported the challenged activity to WHM. WHM relies on appellant’s deposition\n\ntestimony:\n\n      Q      Now, it says here you complained that other non-Hispanic\n             employees were treated differently. Who did you complain to?\n\n      A      Where does it say that?\n\n      Q      The fourth line up from the bottom of the text of the large paragraph\n             on Page 1 . . . . “And complained that other non-Hispanic\n             employees were treated differently.” You see that?\n\n      A      Yes.\n\n                                           24\n\fQ     Who did you complain to?\n\nA     I told my lawyer.\n\nQ     Okay. Anybody else?\n\nA     No.\n\n...\n\nQ     Now, when did you say that, “This was because I’m Hispanic?”\n\nA     When did I say that?\n\nQ     Yes, sir.\n\nA     You want a time frame?\n\nQ     Yeah. I want to know who you told that to.\n\nA     I didn’t tell anybody that.\n\nQ     You never told anybody that, “This is because I’m Hispanic,” did\n      you?\n\nA     No. I don’t recall saying that.\n\n...\n\nQ     You say you complained. And all you complained of is—what\n      you’re calling complained is you questioned why some other people\n      were working that you believed tested positive?\n\nA     That I believe, yes.\n\nQ     Okay. Had nothing to do with your race?          And you never\n      mentioned your race, did you?\n\nA     To who?\n\nQ     When you complained.\n\nA     They knew my race.\n\nQ     Did you even mention it?\n\n                                        25\n\f      A      No.\n\n      Q      Okay. You never said, “This is because of my race”?\n\n      A      I told them how come—why—why—why those two other guys had\n             been able to work . . . . And the black guy. And I wasn’t.\n\n      Q      You didn’t say—did you say, “Why am I being denied work because\n             I’m Hispanic”? Did you mention that?\n\n      ...\n\n      A      I don’t recall.\n\n      Q      Okay. Did you say, “Why are you letting black guys work”?\n\n      A      No, I didn’t.\n\n      Q      You just said, “Why does Tony Davis get to work,” right?\n\n      A      Yes.\n\n      Q      “And why is Mr. Cooper getting . . . [to work],” correct?\n\n      A      Correct.\n\n      Q      That’s all you said; is that correct?\n\n      A    Yes.\n      We conclude that the foregoing demonstrates that appellant never actually\n\ncomplained to WHM that he was being treated differently based on his race or national\n\norigin. Appellant testified that he told his lawyer that non-Hispanic employees were\n\nbeing treated differently. However, appellant testified that he never complained to WHM\n\nthat he was being treated differently because he was Hispanic. According to appellant,\n\nhe asked WHM why two other employees were allowed to work and he was not.\n\nAppellant asked why he was being treated differently. He did not state that he was\n\nbeing treated differently because of his race or national origin. He did not state that\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fnon-Hispanic employees were being treated differently.                   He did not complain about\n\ndiscrimination.5 He did not voice opposition to any alleged discrimination. See City of\n\nWaco v. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 152 (Tex. 2008) (“[A]ctionable retaliation exists when\n\nan employer makes an adverse employment decision against an employee who voices\n\nopposition to conduct made unlawful under the [T]CHRA, regardless of whether the\n\nemployee has already filed a formal complaint with the Commission.”).                           At most,\n\nappellant’s questions may have hinted at the vague possibility of discrimination, which is\n\nnot sufficient to be protected activity. See Azubuike v. Fiesta Mart, 970 S.W.2d 60, 65\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1988, no writ) (“A vague charge of discrimination will\n\nnot invoke protection under the statute.”). Accordingly, we conclude that the burden\n\nshifted to appellant to produce competent summary judgment evidence raising a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding whether he engaged in protected activity. See\n\nM. D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 23 (Tex. 2000) (“The\n\nnonmovant has no burden to respond to a summary judgment motion unless the\n\nmovant conclusively establishes its cause of action or defense.”).\n\nE. Appellant’s Response to WHM’s First Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n        In his response, appellant argued as follows:\n\n\n\n\n        5\n           See Marsaglia v. Univ. of Tex., 22 S.W.3d 1, 4–5 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1999, pet. denied)\n(“Appellant’s deposition testimony establishes that she spoke with Dr. Keller on more than one occasion\nregarding what she believed to be Dr. Pingitore’s sexual harassment of others. Appellant testified that\nshe followed the UTEP sexual harassment policy by reporting what she believed to be sexually harassing\nconduct to her supervisor, Dr. Keller. She also testified that she let Dr. Pingitore know by her actions and\nbody language that she found certain comments to be offensive. Obviously, sexual harassment is an\nunlawful employment practice.”); see also Attieh v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, No. 03-04-00450-CV, 2005\nTex. App. LEXIS 4662, at *15 (Tex. App.—Austin June 16, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.) (“In complaining\nabout the changes under the new Chair, Attieh never mentioned race or national origin. Therefore, Attieh\ndid not put the University on notice that she was complaining about unlawful discrimination, as opposed\nto administrative decisions. Consequently, her complaints about changes in the Department do not\nconstitute a protected activity.”).\n\n                                                    27\n\f       Plaintiff has provided some evidence that he was terminated after he\n       complained that other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug tests were\n       allowed to continue working for Exxon . . . . After WHM refused to allow\n       him back to work at Exxon, Plaintiff complained to WHM management and\n       supervisors that other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug tests were\n       allowed to continue working. Plaintiff was fired for allegedly failing a drug\n       test in September 2008, after he had complained of the disparate\n       treatment of other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug tests but were\n       allowed to continue working for WHM and Exxon . . . . Plaintiff complained\n       to Mark Carter and 2 other WHM supervisors that WHM employees Davis,\n       Sweet and Cooper who failed the test were allowed to continue working\n       for WHM. Plaintiff was officially terminated approximately 6 months later.\n\nIn his response, appellant cited to his deposition testimony:\n\n       Q      Did you ever complain about that to anyone at WHM?\n\n       A      I think I told my brother-in-law.\n\n       Q      Okay.\n\n       A      I told him, “Well, how come Tony Davis is allowed to work and I’m\n              not?”\n\n       ...\n\n       Q      What is your brother-in-law’s name again?\n\n       A      Raul Gonzalez.\n\n       Q      And who does he work for?\n\n       A      WHM.\n\n       Q      And what position does he keep?\n\n       A      Superintendant.\n\n       ...\n\n       Q      Is there anyone else other than your brother-in-law that you told at\n              WHM?\n\n       A      I believe I told—I did tell Ruben Padilla once.\n\n       ...\n\n                                             28\n\f       Q      And what is Mr. Padilla’s position?\n\n       A      He’s a superintendant also.\n\n       Q      For who?\n\n       A      WHM.\n\n       ...\n\n       Q      Anyone other than your brother-in-law and Ruben Padilla with\n              WHM?\n\n       A      Mark Carter.\n\n       ...\n\n       Q      What do you remember telling Mark Carter?\n\n       A      That—man, I called him and told him how come Tony Davis was\n              still working and I couldn’t. And he didn’t explain to me why. He\n              just told me, “Well, he’s working in Louisiana, but he can no longer\n              work in Baytown.”\n\nF. Discussion of WHM’s First Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n       Although appellant argued that this evidence establishes that he “complained of\n\nthe disparate treatment of other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug tests but were\n\nallowed to continue working for WHM,” we disagree.              According to appellant’s\n\ntestimony, he asked why the other employees were allowed to continue working. He\n\ndid not state that he was being treated differently because of his race or national origin.\n\nAppellant’s questions did not “voice opposition” to any alleged discrimination. See City\n\nof Waco, 259 S.W.3d at 152. Again, appellant’s questions may have hinted at a vague\n\npossibility of discrimination, but that is not protected activity. See Azubuike, 970 S.W.2d\n\nat 65. Even if appellant believed otherwise, his deposition testimony does not establish\n\nthat he actually reported discriminatory conduct to WHM.         See Cox & Smith, 974\n\n                                            29\n\fS.W.2d at 224; see also Niu v. Revcor Molded Prods. Co., 206 S.W.3d 723, 731 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2006, no pet.) (“[A]n employee’s subjective beliefs of retaliation are\n\nmerely conclusions and do not raise a fact issue precluding summary judgment in a\n\nretaliatory discharge claim.”).   Accordingly, we conclude that WHM established that\n\nappellant did not engage in the protected activity of opposing a discriminatory practice.\n\n       As set forth above, however, appellant did engage in the protected activity of\n\nfiling a charge of discrimination. Accordingly, we consider WHM’s grounds for summary\n\njudgment with respect to appellant’s claim of retaliation based on this protected activity.\n\nG. WHM’s Second Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n       As set forth above, WHM also moved for summary judgment on the basis that it\n\nhad negated the element of adverse action.         WHM’s summary judgment evidence\n\nestablished that appellant’s charge of discrimination was dated November 24, 2008.\n\nAccording to WHM, “[o]n this date, all of the alleged adverse action—being selected for\n\nthe testing, the test results and the inability to return to work at an ExxonMobil—had\n\nalready occurred and cannot form the basis of any retaliation claim as a matter of law.”\n\nAccording to WHM, “[a]t the time the charge of discrimination was received by WHM,\n\nPlaintiff still had the same inactive DISA status and was ‘ineligible’ to work on\n\nExxonMobil property.      Plaintiff’s status was the same as it had been since the\n\nnotification on April 14, 2008.” Accordingly, we conclude that the burden shifted to\n\nappellant to produce competent summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding whether he suffered an adverse employment action as a result of\n\nhis charge of discrimination. See M. D. Anderson, 28 S.W.3d at 23.\n\nH. Appellant’s Response to WHM’s Second Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\f      In his response, appellant argued that he had produced “some evidence” that he\n\nwas terminated “after he complained other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug\n\ntests were allowed to continue working for Exxon.” In his response, however, appellant\n\nalso states that “Defendant WHM officially terminated Plaintiff on September 2008.”\n\nI. Discussion of WHM’s Second Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n      In his response, appellant did not argue or attempt to offer evidence that he\n\nsuffered any adverse employment action after he was terminated in September 2008.\n\nMoreover, appellant did not argue or offer any evidence to establish that he suffered\n\nany adverse employment action in response to his charge of discrimination dated\n\nNovember 24, 2008.      Accordingly, we conclude that WHM established that it was\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n      Appellant’s third issue is overruled.\n\n              V. DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION CLAIMS AGAINST EXXON\n\n      In his fourth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting Exxon’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on his claims for discrimination and retaliation because\n\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether Exxon was his employer\n\nunder a theory of indirect employment. In his fifth issue, appellant argues that the trial\n\ncourt erred in granting Exxon’s motion for summary judgment on his claims for\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation because there is a genuine issue of material fact with\n\nregard to whether Exxon was his employer under a theory of joint employment.\n\nA. Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued that it was\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on appellant’s claim for discrimination because,\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\famong other things, there is no evidence that “non-protected class employees (non-\n\nHispanics) were treated differently.”6 In addition, Exxon argued that it was entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law on appellant’s claims for retaliation because, among other\n\nthings, there is no evidence that appellant opposed a discriminatory practice or\n\ncomplained to Exxon about a discriminatory practice prior to his termination.7 As noted\n\nabove, the trial court granted Exxon’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment.\n\nB. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n        In his response, appellant argued in relevant part as follows:\n\n        [T]here is ample evidence attached that . . . other non-Hispanic employees\n        were allowed to continue working for Exxon after failing drug tests. In\n        addition, Plaintiff has provided some evidence that he was terminated\n        after he complained that other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug\n        tests were allowed to continue working for Exxon. Therefore, Plaintiff has\n        supported the elements for his discrimination and retaliation claims\n        [against Exxon.]\n\nThe evidence on which appellant relied was his deposition testimony, which we quoted\n\nin relevant part in our analysis of appellant’s second and third issues.\n\nC. Discussion\n\n        Assuming without deciding that Exxon was appellant’s employer, we conclude\n\nthat Exxon nevertheless established its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on\n\nboth claims. For the reasons set forth above in our discussion of appellant’s second\n\nissue, we conclude that there is no competent evidence that similarly situated\n\nnonprotected class members were not treated similarly.                   See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\nAccordingly, summary judgment in favor of Exxon was appropriate on appellant’s\n\n        6\n          As set forth above in our discussion of appellant’s second issue, this is an essential element of\nappellant’s prima facie case of discrimination based on race or national origin.\n        7\n          As set forth above in our discussion of appellant’s third issue, this is an essential element of\nappellant’s prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n                                                    32\n\fdiscrimination claim. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i). In addition, for the reasons set forth\n\nabove in our discussion of appellant’s third issue, we conclude that appellant did not\n\npresent competent evidence to raise a genuine issue of material of fact regarding his\n\nalleged opposition to a discriminatory practice prior to his termination. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 47.1.    Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of Exxon was appropriate on\n\nappellant’s retaliation claim. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n       Appellant’s fourth and fifth issues are overruled.\n\n                           VI. DEFAMATION CLAIM AGAINST WHM\n\n       In his sixth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of WHM on his defamation claim.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       A defamation claim of a private plaintiff against a non-media defendant consists\n\nof five elements:\n\n       1.     the defendant published a factual statement about the plaintiff;\n\n       2.     the statement was defamatory;\n\n       3.     the statement was false;\n\n       4.     the defendant acted with negligence concerning the truth of the\n              statement; and\n\n       5.     the plaintiff suffered injury.\n\nWFAA-TV, Inc. v. McLemore, 978 S.W.2d 568, 571 (Tex. 1998); French v. French, 385\n\nS.W.3d 61, 72 (Tex. App.—Waco 2012, pet. denied). “A statement is defamatory if the\n\nwords tend to injure a person’s reputation, exposing the person to public hatred,\n\ncontempt, ridicule, or financial injury.” Austin v. Inet Techs., Inc., 118 S.W.3d 491, 496\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, no pet.); see also TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 73.001\n\n                                               33\n\f(West 2011). “A statement that falsely charges a person with the commission of a crime\n\nis defamatory per se.” French, 385 S.W.3d at 72.\n\n          “[A]n employer has a conditional or qualified privilege that attaches to\n\ncommunications made in the course of an investigation following a report of employee\n\nwrongdoing.” Randall’s Food Mkts. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 646 (Tex. 1995).\n\n“The privilege remains intact as long as communications pass only to persons having an\n\ninterest or duty in the matter to which the communications relate.” Id. “Proof that a\n\nstatement was motivated by actual malice existing at the time of publication defeats the\n\nprivilege.” Id. “In the defamation context, a statement is made with actual malice when\n\nthe statement is made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard as to its\n\ntruth.”     Id.   “To invoke the privilege on summary judgment, an employer must\n\nconclusively establish that the allegedly defamatory statement was made with an\n\nabsence of malice.” Id.\n\nB. Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n          In his live petition, appellant alleged the following with respect to his defamation\n\nclaims:\n\n          Defendants, by and through their agents, servants and employees,\n          through the careless, inaccurate and negligent drug testing of Plaintiff,\n          made certain statements about the Plaintiff that were false; namely, that\n          Plaintiff tested positive for illicit and/or illegal drug use. Defendants\n          continued to make such false and malicious statements even after [they\n          were] provided with proof that such statements were false which raised\n          concerns that Plaintiff had abused illicit and illegal drugs, thus attacking\n          and damaging Plaintiff’s reputation, character, credibility, and integrity.\n          The inaccurate test results not only directly caused Plaintiff to lose his job,\n          but damaged Plaintiff’s reputation, credibility, and integrity, as he has a\n          history of being an honest individual who never used illicit drugs. Further,\n          these statements were published, in the form of the false and inaccurate\n          test results, to the Plaintiff and others, including Plaintiff’s current\n          employer, L & F Distributors. These publications were made with malice\n\n                                                34\n\fand lack of good faith. These defamatory statements have injured the\nPlaintiff in his business, trade, occupation and/or profession, and in his\nability to obtain future similar employment.\n\nDefendants disseminated and further published the inaccurate test results\nto other parties, namely the Texas Work Force Commission and others,\nfurther damaging the Plaintiff’s reputation, credibility and integrity. In\naddition, because the Defendant employers relied on the false-positive\ndrug test as the reason or basis of their termination and/or refusal to put\nPlaintiff to work, they knew or should have known that Plaintiff would have\nto publish this fact to future or prospective employers, which in fact\nPlaintiff was required to do. As such, Plaintiff was forced to disclose, and\ndid disclose to his current employer, L & F Distributors, the reasons for his\ntermination from the Defendants.\n\nDefendants knew that Plaintiff had obtained drug test results that\ncontradicted the results of the first test by the Defendant laboratory, knew\nthat Plaintiff complained that there were problems with the drug test that\nquestioned its veracity, but callously failed to include that fact when they\ndisseminated and published the Plaintiff’s alleged illicit drug use to the\nTexas Work Force Commission and others. Further, Defendants knew or\nshould have known that by using a questionable drug test that falsely\naccused Plaintiff of illicit and illegal drug use to a government entity,\nthereby making it public record, would require Plaintiff to disclose that fact\nto others, including potential employers, and in fact Plaintiff was forced to\ndisclose, and did disclose to his current employer, L & F Distributors.\nThese publications were made with malice and/or a lack of good faith and\nhave injured the Plaintiff in his business, trade, occupation and/or\nprofession, and in his ability to obtain future similar employment.\n\nA reasonably prudent person and/or company would have known and\nforeseen that Plaintiff would have been compelled to communicate the\nreason and basis of his termination to third parties when Plaintiff sought\nemployment, particularly since it was used as the basis for Plaintiff’s\ntermination and denial of Plaintiff’s unemployment benefits. Additionally,\nPlaintiff was compelled to communicate the reason for his termination to\nthird parties on several occasions, including to Plaintiff’s current employer,\nL & F Distributors. Defendants are liable for the repetition of the reason\nfor and the basis of Plaintiff’s termination. Further, Defendants, by and\nthrough their agents, servants, and employees communicated to others\nthat Plaintiff had tested positive for illicit drug use, when in fact he\ncontested the validity of the test, provided proof to Defendants that the\ntests were incorrect, and requested re-testing.\n\nIn addition, appellant also alleged an agency relationship as follows:\n\n\n\n                                     35\n\f       At all times whenever an employee, supervisor, manager, agent, attorney,\n       representative, contractor, and/or servant of Defendants DISA, Dallas\n       Mentor, and SAFETY TURN-A-ROUND performed some act in relation to\n       the incident made the basis of this lawsuit, such individual was performing\n       acts in such a manner that Defendants WHM and Exxon are liable for the\n       misconduct of Defendant DISA, Dallas Mentor, and SAFETY TURN-A-\n       ROUND employees, supervisors, managers, agents, representatives,\n       contractors, and/or servants.\n\nC. WHM’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n       In its traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment, WHM argued in\n\nrelevant part as follows:\n\n       Plaintiff has not identified any false statement by WHM and has admitted\n       that he has no evidence of any false statement by WHM that can support\n       a claim for defamation. Plaintiff admitted that he has no evidence that his\n       April 10, 2008 drug screen is false or inaccurate. Plaintiff was advised\n       that he could retest the same sample with DISA, but he did not. Plaintiff\n       admitted that he took no action to prove that his sample provided and\n       tested by DISA standards was not in fact his own. Plaintiff testified that he\n       did not request a DNA test on his April 10, 2008 sample. As an initial\n       premise, however, as stated above, WHM has never made a defamatory\n       statement. As admitted by Plaintiff all that WHM has ever stated is that\n       Plaintiff needed to get it (his test results) cleared with DISA. Plaintiff has\n       repeatedly indicated that WHM’s statements are literally true. Plaintiff has\n       not identified any false statement to support a claim of defamation.\n       Consequently, WHM is entitled to summary judgment.\n\n       In addition to the foregoing, WHM also argued that it was entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law because any alleged statement by WHM was protected by qualified or\n\nabsolute privilege:\n\n       Plaintiff cannot identify any false statements made by WHM or any\n       statements made with malice that are not protected by the qualified\n       privilege. Moreover, even if any false statements were made, Plaintiff has\n       no evidence that any statement made by WHM was not privileged or that it\n       was motivated by actual malice to defeat such privilege. The only\n       asserted defamatory statement was the notice from the Texas Workforce\n       Commission relating to Plaintiff’s unemployment benefits. Plaintiff claims\n       it was defamatory to be “terminated.” Plaintiff has not identified any\n       persons other than ExxonMobil and the Texas Workforce Commission to\n       which any communication occurred, any statements made by WHM are\n\n                                            36\n\f       protected by qualified privilege because they were limited to parties with a\n       legitimate business interest (Exxon Mobil) and in response to Plaintiff’s\n       claim with the Texas Workforce Commission, which Plaintiff initiated\n       himself.    Statements made during Texas Workforce Commission\n       proceedings are privileged. Moreover, as a condition of Plaintiff’s\n       employment with WHM, Plaintiff consented to become and remain DISA\n       active. Thus, Plaintiff’s defamation claims fail, and summary judgment for\n       WHM is proper.\n\n       With respect to appellant’s self-compelled defamation allegations, WHM argued\n\nas follows:\n\n       Plaintiff also makes a claim for “self-compelled” defamation. In particular,\n       he claims that he was compelled to tell family members and his current\n       employer that he was discharged because he failed a drug test.\n\n       ...\n\n       Even assuming, arguendo, that WHM’s comments to Plaintiff were\n       somehow defamatory, to establish self-compelled defamation Plaintiff\n       must provide evidence that he was unaware of the alleged defamatory\n       nature of the communication at the time he published his positive drug test\n       results to third parties.\n\n       Clearly, Plaintiff was aware of the derogatory content of his own\n       statements, and he told several third parties that he tested positive for\n       marijuana, including his current employer. Notably, this information did\n       not prevent his current employer from hiring him or cause him to lose\n       friends or acquaintances. Thus, no evidence exists to support Plaintiff’s\n       claim of self-compelled defamation, and WHM is entitled to judgment as a\n       matter of law.\n\nD. Appellant’s Response to WHM’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n       In his response, appellant argued in relevant part as follows:\n\n       WHM alleges that there is no evidence that it made any statements\n       regarding Plaintiff’s failed drug test. However, WHM fails to acknowledge\n       the potential liability for the defamatory statements made by its agent,\n       Defendant DISA and/or its laboratory Defendant Dallas Mentor, to whom\n       WHM gave express and implied authority to carry out its drug testing\n       policy. There is no question DISA and/or Dallas Mentor have stated that\n       Plaintiff used marijuana, and failed a random drug test. As set forth\n       above, the attached evidence clearly shows that there is a genuine issue\n       of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff did, in fact, use illegal drugs\n\n                                            37\n\f      and fail the drug test, including a second “clean” drug test taken a few\n      days later. As such, the defamatory statements of DISA and/or Dallas\n      Mentor, which are WHM’s (as well as Exxon’s agents) agents and\n      representatives for drug testing, are impugned to WHM for these false\n      statements.\n\n      WHM also argues that there is no evidence that it published any false\n      statements regarding Plaintiff. First, as indicated above, DISA’s and/or\n      Dallas Mentor’s conduct of falsely accusing Plaintiff of using drugs and\n      failing a drug test is impugned to WHM, as its agent for the\n      implementation of it’s [sic] drug policy. Second, while WHM is correct that\n      the Texas Supreme Court has not expressly accepted or rejected the\n      doctrine of self-publication, several courts of appeals, including the 13th\n      Court, have accepted the doctrine. Further, WHM misstates the law that\n      these appellate courts require a showing that the Plaintiff must not know\n      the statement was defamatory when he self-published it, nor is that the\n      standard set forth by the 13th Court of Appeals.\n\nE. Discussion\n\n      On appeal, appellant argues the following:\n\n      Rincones does not deny that WHM and Exxon may have an affirmative\n      defense of qualified privilege. The privilege, however, is not absolute; it is\n      lost when statements are made with actual malice . . . .\n\n      Inasmuch as Rincones submitted evidence that WHM republished the\n      DISA drug test results after it knew he alleged they were false, and\n      provided proof to WHM that they were false, without also publishing those\n      facts, WHM’s and Exxon’s qualified immunity does not apply because they\n      were made with actual malice. At the very least, genuine issues of\n      material fact exist regarding whether the privilege applies, and the trial\n      court’s granting of summary judgment was error.\n\n      As set forth above, the trial court did not specify the grounds on which it granted\n\nWHM’s motion for summary judgment on appellant’s claim for defamation. Therefore,\n\nto successfully challenge the summary judgment on appeal, it is appellant’s burden to\n\nnegate each possible ground for summary judgment. See Kiger v. Balestri, 376 S.W.3d\n\n287, 290 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.) (“When, as in this case, the trial court does\n\nnot state the basis for granting summary judgment, the appellant must show on appeal\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\fthat each independent ground alleged is insufficient to support the summary judgment\n\ngranted.”); Wrenn v. G.A.T.X. Logistics, Inc., 73 S.W.3d 489, 493 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2002, pet. denied) (“When, as in this case, the trial court’s judgment rests or may\n\nrest upon more than one independent ground or defense, the aggrieved party must\n\nassign error to each ground, or the judgment will be affirmed on the ground to which no\n\ncomplaint is made.”). One such ground is the affirmative defense of qualified privilege.\n\nSee Johnson, 891 S.W.2d at 646.\n\n      Appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on this\n\nbasis because he presented summary judgment evidence to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding whether the privilege applies; however, as noted above, in his\n\nresponse to WHM’s motion for summary judgment, appellant did not make this\n\nargument or direct the trial court’s attention to the evidence that arguably raises a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact. See Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d\n\n671, 678 (Tex. 1979) (“Under the new rule, the non-movant may not urge on appeal as\n\nreason for reversal of the summary judgment any and every new ground that he can\n\nthink of, nor can he resurrect grounds that he abandoned at the hearing.”). “A summary\n\njudgment may not be reversed on a ground not raised in the trial court.” Swinehart v.\n\nStubbeman, 48 S.W.3d 865, 885 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied);\n\nsee also Shelton v. Sargent, 144 S.W.3d 113, 129 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, pet.\n\ndenied). Therefore, appellant cannot challenge this ground for summary judgment for\n\nthe first time on appeal. See Roark v. Stallworth Oil & Gas, 813 S.W.2d 492, 495 (Tex.\n\n1991) (“Under rule 166a(c) of our Rules of Civil Procedure, issues that are not expressly\n\npresented to the trial court by written motion, answer or response will not serve as\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\fgrounds for reversal of a summary judgment on appeal.”); Pinnacle Anesthesia\n\nConsultants, P.A. v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., 359 S.W.3d 389, 397 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2012, pet. denied) (“[W]e cannot reverse a summary judgment on a ground not raised\n\nbelow.”). Accordingly, we conclude that appellant has not demonstrated that the trial\n\ncourt committed reversible error in granting summary judgment in favor of WHM on his\n\ndefamation claim.\n\n      Appellant’s sixth issue is overruled.\n\n                        VII. DEFAMATION CLAIM AGAINST EXXON\n\n      In his seventh issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Exxon on his defamation claim.\n\nA. Exxon’s No-Evidence Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued that it was\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on appellant’s defamation claim on the following\n\ngrounds:\n\n      In this case, Plaintiff has no evidence of any written or oral false statement\n      made by ExxonMobil to support any claim of defamation. To be sure,\n      Plaintiff has not and cannot identify any false statement made by\n      ExxonMobil to support his defamation claim. Thus, without evidence of\n      any written or oral false statement made by ExxonMobil, Plaintiff’s\n      defamation claims fail. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate.\n\n      ...\n\n      Although the Texas Supreme Court has yet to adopt or approve a cause\n      of action for self-compelled defamation, some authorities indicate that self-\n      publication of a defamatory statement occurs: (1) if the defamed person’s\n      communication of the defamatory statements to the third person was\n      made without an awareness of their defamatory nature; and (2) if the\n      circumstances indicated that communication to a third party was likely. As\n      noted above, truth is a complete defense to a defamation case.\n\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\f     Here, Plaintiff’s self-compelled defamation claim fails as he has no\n     evidence of any false statement made by ExxonMobil. Further, Plaintiff’s\n     self-compelled defamation claim fails because he has no evidence of and\n     cannot prove that he was unaware of the nature of publishing his positive\n     test results to third-parties, including his current employer. Moreover,\n     because truth, even substantial truth, is a defendant to defamation claims,\n     Plaintiff’s claim is defeated by the fact that he has no evidence that the\n     drug test result he received for the sample he provided to DISA on April\n     10, 2008 was false. Thus, based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s claim for self-\n     compelled defamation also fails, and summary judgment should be\n     granted.\n\nB. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s No-Evidence Grounds\n\n     In his response, appellant argued as follows:\n\n     Defendant Exxon alleged that there is no evidence that Defendant Exxon\n     made any statement regarding Plaintiff’s failed drug test. However, Exxon\n     fails to acknowledge the potential liability for the defamatory statements\n     made by its agent, Defendants DICA [sic] and/or Dallas Mentor, to whom\n     Exxon gave express and implied authority to carry out its drug testing\n     policy. There is no question that Defendants DICA [sic] and/or Dallas\n     Mentor have stated that Plaintiff used marijuana, and failed a random drug\n     test. As set forth above, the attached evidence clearly shows that there is\n     a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff did, in fact, use\n     illegal drugs and fail the drug test, as alleged by Defendants DICA [sic]\n     and/or Dallas Mentor. As such, the defamatory statements of Defendants\n     DICA [sic] and/or Dallas Mentor, which are Exxon’s agents and\n     representative for drug testing, are impugned to Defendant Exxon for\n     these false statements.\n\n     Defendant Exxon also alleges that there is no evidence that it published\n     any false statements regarding Plaintiff. First, as indicated above,\n     Defendant DICA’s [sic] and/or Dallas Mentor’s conduct of falsely accusing\n     Plaintiff of using illegal drugs and failing a drug test is impugned to\n     Defendant Exxon, as its agent for the implementation of Exxon’s drug\n     policy. Second, while Defendant Exxon is correct that the Texas Supreme\n     Court has not expressly accepted or rejected the doctrine of self-\n     publication, several courts of appeals, including the 13th Court, have\n     accepted that doctrine based upon whether it was reasonably foreseeable\n     that a plaintiff would be required to advise others, including potential\n     employers, of the defamatory statements.\n\n\n\nC. Discussion of Exxon’s No-Evidence Grounds\n\n                                          41\n\f      To avoid summary judgment, appellant had the burden to produce more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence to establish that Exxon made a false statement about him. See\n\nZapata, 997 S.W.2d at 747. In his response, appellant relied on summary judgment\n\nevidence that established that DISA stated to WHM that appellant had failed his random\n\ndrug test. As noted above, appellant pled an agency relationship between DISA and\n\nExxon.   In his response, appellant argued that Exxon had failed to address the\n\nstatement DISA made to WHM, which appellant maintains was false and also imputed\n\nto Exxon by virtue of the alleged agency relationship. Exxon did not argue by written\n\nmotion, answer, or response that the allegedly false statement made by DISA to WHM\n\nwas not imputed to Exxon by virtue of the agency relationship alleged by appellant. See\n\nState Farm Lloyds v. Page, 315 S.W.3d 525, 532 (Tex. 2010) (“Summary judgment may\n\nnot be affirmed on appeal on a ground not presented to the trial court in the motion.”).\n\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that appellant produced more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence to defeat Exxon’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment on his\n\ndefamation claim.\n\nD. Exxon’s Traditional Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its traditional motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued, among other\n\nthings, that “Plaintiff cannot identify any false statements made by ExxonMobil or any\n\nstatements made with malice that are not protected by the qualified privilege.”\n\nE. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s Traditional Grounds\n\n      We have reviewed the record, and there is no indication that appellant filed a\n\nresponse to Exxon’s traditional motion for summary judgment.\n\nF. Discussion of Exxon’s Traditional Grounds\n\n\n\n                                           42\n\f      As set forth above, in his appellate brief, appellant does not dispute that Exxon\n\nhas an affirmative defense based on qualified privilege, but he maintains that the\n\nprivilege does not apply to statements made with malice. Although appellant maintains\n\nthat his summary judgment evidence was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material\n\nfact about whether the statements at issue were made with malice, he failed to make\n\nthat argument in a written response to Exxon’s traditional motion for summary judgment.\n\nSee Swinehart, 48 S.W.3d at 885 (“A summary judgment may not be reversed on a\n\nground not raised in the trial court.”). Therefore, appellant cannot make this argument\n\nfor the first time on appeal. See Roark, 813 S.W.2d at 495; Pinnacle Anesthesia, 359\n\nS.W.3d at 397 (“[W]e cannot reverse a summary judgment on a ground not raised\n\nbelow.”). Accordingly, we conclude that appellant has not established that the trial court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Exxon on his defamation claim.\n\n      Appellant’s seventh issue is overruled.\n\n                        VIII. NEGLIGENCE CLAIM AGAINST EXXON\n\n      In his eighth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Exxon on his negligence claim.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n      “Negligence is no more than breach of a legal duty; the tort becomes actionable\n\nwhen the breach causes injury.” Rosas v. Buddies Food Store, 518 S.W.2d 534, 536\n\n(Tex. 1975). “The common law doctrine of negligence consists of three elements: 1) a\n\nlegal duty owed by one person to another; 2) a breach of that duty; and 3) damages\n\nproximately resulting from the breach.” Greater Houston Transp. Co. v. Phillips, 801\n\nS.W.2d 523, 525 (Tex. 1990). “The threshold inquiry in a negligence case is duty.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f“The plaintiff must establish both the existence and the violation of a duty owed to the\n\nplaintiff by the defendant to establish liability in tort.” Id. “Moreover, the existence of\n\nduty is a question of law for the court to decide from the facts surrounding the\n\noccurrence in question.” Id.\n\nB. Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n       In his live petition, appellant alleged the following:\n\n       The Defendants DISA, DALLAS MENTOR, AND SAFETY TURN-A-\n       ROUND and EXXON owed a duty to Plaintiff to properly and accurately\n       test and analyze Plaintiff’s drug test results, as well as follow its rules,\n       regulations and protocol for such testing. Through their acts and\n       omissions herein set forth, these Defendants breached that duty to\n       Plaintiff. Specifically, these Defendants were negligent as follows:\n\n         a. Improperly administering a random drug test to Plaintiff;\n\n         b. Inaccurately analyzing the drug test results;\n\n         c. Failing to thoroughly investigate and compare its test results with the\n            test results obtained by Plaintiff through LabCorp Houston, once it\n            was informed by Plaintiff of the second test results; and\n\n         d. Failing to follow the Federal Drug Administration’s recommendations\n            that positive results be confirmed using a different test method;\n\n         e. Failing to advise Plaintiff’s employers that a positive test result does\n            not always mean a person took illegal drugs, as a variety of facts\n            can influence the reliability of drug tests;\n\n         f. Disseminating the drug test results, without thoroughly verifying their\n            accuracy, to Plaintiff’s employers, which they knew, or should have\n            known, would lead to Plaintiff’s termination; and\n\n         g. Failing to allow Plaintiff to properly retest to contest the false positive\n            result.\n\n       The acts and/or omissions of these Defendants as set forth above are the\n       proximate cause of damages sustained by Plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n                                              44\n\fIn addition to the foregoing, appellant also pled that “[a]t all times, Defendant EXXON\n\nsupervised and/or controlled Plaintiff’s work assignments, schedule and duties; as such,\n\nDefendant EXXON was also Plaintiff’s employer for all intents and purposes.”\n\nC. Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued\n\nfor summary judgment on the following grounds:\n\n      Plaintiff waived any and all claims related to substance abuse testing\n      based on his consent to WHM’s Substance Abuse Policy. As a condition\n      of Plaintiff’s employment, he was required to enroll with DISA pursuant to\n      WHM’s Substance Abuse Policy. Plaintiff agreed to this policy and was a\n      DISA participant. Importantly, the Agreement signed by Plaintiff includes\n      a waiver of claims. The Agreement and consent form states that Plaintiff\n      agrees to “hold WHM . . . harmless from any and all liability in connection\n      with the testing for drug[s].” Because Plaintiff expressly agreed to waive\n      any and all claims based on substance abuse testing, his remaining\n      claims alleged in his [live petition (i.e., negligence and tortious interference\n      with a contract)] fail, and summary judgment is appropriate.\n\n      ...\n\n      Plaintiff alleges that ExxonMobil is liable for negligence based on an\n      agency theory for the alleged acts or omissions of Dallas Mentor (a DISA-\n      approved substance abuse testing collection site) and DISA (a third-party\n      substance abuse testing administrator). Thus, Plaintiff must prove that\n      Defendant owed Plaintiff a legal duty, breached the legal duty and that\n      damages proximately resulted from the breach. However, Plaintiff cannot\n      prove the essential elements of this cause of action. Moreover, even if he\n      could, Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the\n      Texas Workers’ Compensation Act.          Thus, summary judgment for\n      ExxonMobil on Plaintiff’s negligence claims is proper.\n\n      ...\n\n      Plaintiff has no evidence that ExxonMobil owed any duty to Plaintiff.\n      ExxonMobil was not Plaintiff’s employer. ExxonMobil did not have a\n      contract with Plaintiff, DISA or Dallas Mentor. Notwithstanding, even if a\n      duty existed, Plaintiff has no evidence of a breach of any supposed duty.\n      Thus, summary judgment is proper.\n\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\f     Under an agency theory, Plaintiff alleges that ExxonMobil is liable for the\n     alleged acts of third parties—DISA and Dallas Mentor. However, Plaintiff\n     has no evidence of any agency relationship between ExxonMobil and\n     either Dallas Mentor (DISA-approved substance abuse testing collection\n     site) or DISA (the third party substance abuse testing administrator). In\n     fact, ExxonMobil has no contractual relationship with either DISA or Dallas\n     Mentor and denies any agency relationship. ExxonMobil does not control\n     the means or manner that DISA or Dallas Mentor operate their companies.\n     ExxonMobil does not have any employees onsite at DISA or Dallas\n     Mentor. Plaintiff has no evidence to indicate that anyone at ExxonMobil\n     was present or participated in any way related to his substance abuse\n     testing. To be clear, DISA’s contractual relationship is with WHM, not\n     ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil has no role in selecting Dallas Mentor as the\n     collection site for Rincones to submit his drug testing sample on or about\n     April 10, 2008. In accordance with its Agreement with WHM, ExxonMobil\n     is only concerned with the information it receives from WHM as to whether\n     individuals are qualified to work under Exhibit H to the Agreement. Thus,\n     summary judgment is proper.\n\nD. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n     In his response, appellant argued as follows:\n\n     First and foremost, nowhere in the alleged release is Defendant WHM’s\n     sole client, Exxon, mentioned in the alleged waiver. Second, even if\n     Exxon was listed, the release relied on by Defendant Exxon is neither\n     conspicuous nor sufficiently specific to put Plaintiff on notice of his waiver\n     of claims as required by the Texas Supreme Court . . . . Third, Exxon has\n     produced no evidence that the alleged waiver was supported by any\n     consideration, a requirement for a valid, enforceable contract . . . .\n\n     For this reason, Defendant Exxon’s basis for summary judgment must fail.\n\n     ...\n\n     Exxon [also] argues that it had no duty to Plaintiff in regards to the drug\n     testing it required WHM and its employees (including Plaintiff) [to] undergo\n     in order to work at Exxon facilities.\n\n     The existence of a duty is generally a question of law. Generally\n     speaking, foreseeability of the risk is the most important factor courts look\n     at to determine if a duty exists, which includes whether the injury to the\n     plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable. It is undisputed that the results of a\n     positive drug test—even one in error—was that Plaintiff would be\n     “inactive” and unable to work at an Exxon facility, which is the sole source\n     or location for WHM employees. As such, a false positive drug test which\n\n                                          46\n\f      requires that Plaintiff not be allowed to work and/or would cause Plaintiff to\n      lose his job was clearly foreseeable, and a duty does exist for Exxon.\n\n      Further, Plaintiff is not making any failure-to-warn or negligent\n      misrepresentation claim against Exxon. Rather, Plaintiff is alleging that\n      Defendant DISA owed a duty to Plaintiff to use reasonable care in\n      performing the tests and reporting the results, and that Exxon and WHM\n      empowered DISA (as well as other TPAs) as agents to implement its drug\n      testing policy. As such, Exxon is liable as the principal where DISA and/or\n      its drug testing contractors are negligent in performing the test. An agent\n      is a person who is authorized by the principal to transact business or\n      manage some affair on the principal’s behalf, such as the implementing of\n      Exxon’s and WHM’s drug testing policy.\n\n      In addition, because Exxon specifically required WHM, Plaintiff’s\n      employer, to use one of a limited number of specific third-party\n      administrators (TPAs) to perform drug testing and follow rigid testing\n      guidelines, Exxon has a duty to ensure that the TPAs are proper, valid\n      entities that use proper protocol and guidelines for testing. The evidence\n      attached to this motion is that the TPA, Defendant DISA, did not follow the\n      proper protocol and guidelines, and in fact mixed-up Plaintiff’s urine so\n      that a false result was found that [sic] which prevented Plaintiff from being\n      able to work with WHM. While Exxon and WHM want to argue that it was\n      not the employer and did not choose the specific TPA (i.e. DISA) that\n      performed the bad test, these arguments merely illustrate the fact that\n      there are material issue of fact regarding Exxon’s duty.\n\n      Exxon argues that even if a duty can be found, it cannot be held liable\n      under the Texas Workers Compensation Act (TWCA) exclusive remedy\n      bar. Despite arguing ad nausea that Exxon was not Plaintiff’s employer\n      (and in fact was one of the basis for this Court’s previous granting of\n      Exxon’s first summary judgment), Exxon seeks to invoke the exclusive\n      remedy of the Texas Workers without clearly defining how it takes\n      advantage of this defense while maintaining its position that it was not\n      Plaintiff’s employer. The TWCA exclusive remedy defense is available to\n      employers only.\n\nE. Discussion of Exxon’s Fourth Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its fourth ground, Exxon argued that, even if there was evidence of a duty,\n\nthere was no evidence of a breach.       In his response, appellant argued that “[t]he\n\nevidence . . . is that the TPA, Defendant DISA, did not follow the proper protocols and\n\nguidelines.” Yet, this argument was made with respect to the existence of a duty, not\n\n                                           47\n\fwith respect to the challenged element of breach.          We have reviewed appellant’s\n\nresponse and conclude that appellant failed to respond to Exxon’s no-evidence point\n\nregarding the element of breach. See Roark, 813 S.W.2d at 495 (“Under rule 166a(c) of\n\nour Rules of Civil Procedure, issues that are not expressly presented to the trial court by\n\nwritten motion, answer or response will not serve as grounds for reversal of a summary\n\njudgment on appeal.”). In his response, appellant did not direct the trial court’s attention\n\nto any evidence that arguably raised a fact issue about whether Exxon breached a duty\n\nowed to appellant. In his appellate brief, appellant does not address the element of\n\nbreach or whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on that basis.\n\nSee Kiger, 376 S.W.3d at 290 (“When, as in this case, the trial court does not state the\n\nbasis for granting summary judgment, the appellant must show on appeal that each\n\nindependent ground alleged is insufficient to support the summary judgment granted.”).\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that appellant has failed to meet his burden to negate all\n\npossible grounds for the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of Exxon on his\n\nnegligence claim.\n\n       Appellant’s eighth issue is overruled.\n\n         IX. CLAIM AGAINST EXXON FOR TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT\n\n       In his ninth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Exxon on his tortious interference with a contract claim.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       A claim for tortious interference with a contract consists of four elements: (1) the\n\nexistence of a contract subject to interference; (2) willful and intentional interference; (3)\n\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\finterference that proximately caused damage; and (4) actual damage or loss. ACS\n\nInvs., Inc. v. McLaughlin, 943 S.W.2d 426, 430 (Tex. 1997).\n\nB. Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n      In his live petition, appellant alleged the following:\n\n      The Defendants DISA, Dallas Mentor, SAFETY TURN-A-ROUND and\n      EXXON knew of Plaintiff’s employment by Defendants [sic] WHM and that\n      if he failed a drug test, he would not be allowed to continue to work. By\n      disseminating and publishing the inaccurate drug test results as set forth\n      above, these Defendants not only damaged Plaintiff’s reputation and\n      character, but cast doubt on Plaintiff’s ability to perform his job. Plaintiff\n      was ultimately terminated from his employment by his employers,\n      Defendants WHM and/or EXXON, as a direct result of these inaccurate\n      test results. Furthermore, because of the negligence of Defendants DISA,\n      Dallas Mentor, SAFETY TURN-A-ROUND and EXXON, it was reported\n      that Plaintiff tested positive for drug use, which was false, and prevented\n      [Plaintiff] from working for Defendant EXXON through Defendant WHM.\n\n      Moreover, Defendants DISA, Dallas Mentor, SAFETY TURN-A-ROUND\n      and EXXON failed to properly investigate and/or perform a comparison\n      analysis of why the second drug test, taken by Plaintiff a mere four (4)\n      days after the initial test, came out negative for any illicit drug use. As a\n      result of their acts and omissions, these Defendants directly influenced\n      Plaintiff’s employers to terminate him, thus causing them to breach their\n      employment contract and/or business relations with Plaintiff.\n\nC. Exxon’s Grounds Summary Judgment\n\n      In its motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued the following:\n\n      First, Plaintiff has no evidence of a contract subject to interference.\n      Plaintiff was an at-will employee of WHM. Despite Plaintiff’s deposition\n      testimony to the contrary, Plaintiff pleads that ExxonMobil is his employer.\n      However, Plaintiff admitted that he has no contract with ExxonMobil with\n      which to interfere. ExxonMobil denies that Plaintiff was its employee.\n      There is no evidence that ExxonMobil interfered in any way with Plaintiff’s\n      employment with WHM. To be sure, ExxonMobil did not have a contract\n      with Plaintiff, DISA or Dallas Mentor. While ExxonMobil did have a\n      contract with WHM, it is black letter law that a party cannot interfere with\n      its own contract. Thus, Plaintiff’s tortious interference with contract claim\n      fails, and summary judgment in favor of ExxonMobil should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                             49\n\f      Moreover, Plaintiff admitted that he was not fired by his employer WHM,\n      and he just needed to obtain “active” status with DISA to work for WHM.\n      Plaintiff’s employment relationship with WHM is conditioned upon\n      Plaintiff’s own actions, to become DISA “active.” To date, Plaintiff has not\n      retested or taken any action to obtain “active” DISA status. The onus is on\n      Plaintiff to obtain “active” DISA status to receive work assignments from\n      WHM, not ExxonMobil.\n\n      Likewise, Plaintiff failed to identify any intentional tort allegedly committed\n      by ExxonMobil. In fact, there is no evidence of any allegedly willful or\n      intentional interference with any contract committed by ExxonMobil . . . .\n\n      Finally, Plaintiff has no evidence that any alleged interference by\n      ExxonMobil proximately caused him any damages.\n\nD. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In his response, appellant argued the following:\n\n      Exxon claims Plaintiff cannot meet elements (1) [an existing contract] and\n      (2) [an intentional and willful act of interference] because he as [sic] at will\n      employee of WHM and there is no evidence of any intentional or willful act\n      of interference. However, the fact that the contract interfered with is\n      terminable at will is no defense. In addition, according to Exxon’s own\n      affidavit, Exxon informed WHM that Plaintiff could not work at its facilities\n      after it became aware of Plaintiff’s discrimination claim with the EEOC,\n      even though it knew that Plaintiff informed the EEOC and WHM that the\n      drug test was false. This, in effect, amounted to Plaintiff’s termination,\n      since Exxon is the sole and/or major client of WHM, and WHM admits that\n      it had no other work for Plaintiff. Intentional interference does not require\n      intent to injure. Rather, the actor must desire to cause the consequences\n      of his or her act or believe those consequences are substantially certain to\n      result from it.\n\nE. Discussion of Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      As set forth above, Exxon moved for summary judgment on the basis that there\n\nis “no evidence that any alleged interference by ExxonMobil proximately caused\n\n[appellant] any damages.” We have reviewed appellant’s response and conclude that\n\nappellant did not address this challenged element in his response. See Roark, 813\n\nS.W.2d at 495. Nor has appellant addressed this challenged element on appeal. See\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\fKiger, 376 S.W.3d at 290. Accordingly, we conclude that the summary judgment must\n\nbe affirmed on this ground. See Harris v. Ebby Halliday Real Estate, Inc., 345 S.W.3d\n\n756, 760 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, no pet.) (“Because the Harrises failed to address\n\nHalliday’s no-evidence challenge to the standard of care element, the judgment on their\n\nnegligence claim may be affirmed on that ground alone.”).\n\n       Appellant’s ninth issue is overruled.\n\n                                X. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\n       In his tenth issue, appellant contends that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of DISA on appellant’s claims for defamation, negligence,\n\nand tortious interference with a contract based on the statute of limitations.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       “A defendant moving for summary judgment on the affirmative defense of\n\nlimitations has the burden to conclusively establish that defense.” KPMG Peat Marwick\n\nv. Harrison County Hous. Fin. Corp., 988 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex. 1999). The Texas\n\nSupreme Court has explained the standard as follows:\n\n       [T]he defendant must (1) conclusively prove when the cause of action\n       accrued, and (2) negate the discovery rule, if it applies and has been\n       pleaded or otherwise raised, by proving as a matter of law that there is no\n       genuine issue of material fact about when the plaintiff discovered, or in the\n       exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the nature of its\n       injury. If the movant establishes that the statute of limitations bars the\n       action, the nonmovant must then adduce summary judgment proof raising\n       a fact issue in avoidance of the statute of limitations.\n\nId.\n\nB. Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n       In his live petition, appellant did not plead the discovery rule or any other tolling\n\nprovision for the applicable statute of limitations on his claims. In its original answer to\n\n                                               51\n\fappellant’s live petition, DISA alleged that appellant’s claims were barred by the\n\napplicable statute of limitations.\n\nC. DISA’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n       In its motion for summary judgment, DISA argued in relevant part as follows:\n\n       Rincones asserts three causes of action against DISA: (1) negligence; (2)\n       tortious interference with contract; and (3) defamation (libel and slander).\n       It has long been the law in Texas that “a cause of action accrues when a\n       party has been injured by actions or omissions of another.” Taking\n       Rincones’ allegations in [his live petition] as true as the Court must on\n       summary judgment, these three causes of action began to accrue against\n       DISA on April 14, 2008. On that day, Rincones learned to his “surprise\n       and amazement” that he had tested positive for drug use, but believed the\n       result was erroneous because Rincones “has never used illicit and/or\n       illegal drugs[,]” and also learned that WHM and Exxon refused to allow\n       him to return to work until he contacted DISA to resolve this issue.\n\n       The statute of limitations for a negligence cause of action under Texas law\n       is two years. The statute of limitations for a tortious interference with\n       contract claim is also two years. The statute of limitations for defamation\n       (libel and slander) is one year.\n\n       Rincones, however, failed to assert any claims against DISA until he filed\n       his Fourth Amended Petition on August 10, 2010—two years and four\n       months after the statute of limitations on these three claims began to\n       accrue. Said differently, the statute of limitations on Rincones’ defamation\n       claim against DISA expired on April 14, 2009. When Rincones first\n       asserted this claim against DISA on August 10, 2010, the statute of\n       limitations had been expired for nearly one year and four months.\n       Similarly, the statute of limitations on Rincones’ negligence and tortious\n       interference with contract claims against DISA expired on April 14, 2010.\n       When Rincones first asserted these claims against DISA on August 10,\n       2010, the statute of limitations had been expired for almost four months.\n\n       DISA has met its summary judgment burden by conclusively proving\n       Rincones’ three claims against DISA are barred by the applicable statute\n       of limitations. The Court should grant summary judgment for DISA and\n       dismiss DISA from this lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, DISA also argued that appellant’s claims were barred under\n\nthe doctrine of misidentification:\n\n\n\n                                           52\n\f      This is a case of misidentification: Rincones sued the wrong party and the\n      statute of limitations expired before he corrected his error. DISA is not\n      associated with, and has no connection to, any business organization\n      named DICA. Although Rincones knew about WHM’s Deposition of\n      Written Questions to DISA in August 2009 and testified extensively about\n      DISA in his November 2009 deposition, he chose to add DICA as a\n      defendant to this lawsuit in his Third Amended Petition on February 23,\n      2010 and, in fact, served DICA on June 11, 2010. . .\n\n      Moreover, this is not a case where the proper defendant had notice of the\n      suit or would not be disadvantaged by the mistake. It is undisputed that\n      DISA had no notice of Plaintiff’s Third Amended Petition until it was served\n      on August 26, 2010 with Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition. It is also\n      undisputed that DISA has no corporate relationship—or any relationship at\n      all—with DICA. Rincones’ decision to add DISA to this lawsuit three\n      months before trial would not only place DISA at a severe disadvantage,\n      but would also result in unnecessarily delayed justice to all other parties\n      involved in this case.\n\n      Plaintiff sued the wrong party on February 23, 2010. His claims against\n      DISA . . . are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, DISA also argued as follows:\n\n      Even if the Court finds Rincones merely misnamed “DISA” as “DICA” in\n      his Third Amended Petition, . . . his claims against DISA are still barred as\n      a matter of law.\n\n      First, Rincones’ defamation claims against DISA remain barred by the\n      applicable one year statute of limitations. Even assuming Rincones first\n      put DISA on notice of this lawsuit when he filed his Third Amended\n      Petition on February 23, 2010, which DISA denies, the statute of\n      limitations on Rincones’ defamation claims expired on April 14, 2009,\n      more than 10 months before asserting the claims.\n\n      Moreover, Rincones’ negligence and tortious interference with contract\n      claims are barred as a matter of law because Rincones failed to exercise\n      diligence in serving DICA and DISA. The filing of a lawsuit will not toll the\n      running of limitations unless due diligence is exercised in the issuance and\n      service of citation. . .\n\n      Rincones first asserted negligence and tortious interference [with] contract\n      claims against DICA on February 23, 2010, a little less than two months\n      before the statute of limitations on these claims expired. Rincones,\n      however, did not serve DICA with notice of these claims until June 11,\n      2010, nearly four months after first naming DICA as a defendant, and two\n\n                                           53\n\f     months after the statute of limitation expired. Likewise, Rincones did not\n     serve DISA with notice of these claims until August 26, 2010, more than\n     six months after Rincones first brought DICA into this lawsuit, and more\n     than four months after the statute of limitations expired.\n\n     Rincones cannot justify his failure to timely serve DISA. He has known of\n     DISA’s role in his April 11, 2008 positive drug test since April 14, 2008.\n     He certainly received a copy of WHM’s Deposition on Written Questions in\n     August 2009, and, more critically, testified extensively about DISA during\n     his November 2009 deposition. As a matter of law, Rincones failed to\n     exercise the diligence in service necessary to toll the statute of limitations\n     on his negligence and tortious interference with contract claims.\n\nD. Appellant’s Response to DISA’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n     In his response, appellant argued in relevant part as follows:\n\n     There . . . is no fact question that Plaintiff has not been allowed to\n     continue working because he alleged[ly] failed a drug test performed by\n     DISA and its specimen collector agent, Turnaround, and that WHM listed\n     him as “Fired” with the TWC on September 11, 2008 for allegedly failing a\n     drug test.     As such, Plaintiff[’]s tortious interference of the at-will\n     employment contract action did not accrue until September 11, 2008, the\n     date of his termination, and the suit against DISA is timely because it was\n     sued and served with process prior to August 2010, within 2 years of the\n     date of his termination.\n\n     Further, it is undisputed that DISA had a duty to counsel Plaintiff after he\n     allegedly tested positive for drugs so that he can regain “active” status.\n     Plaintiff was an employee in “inactive” status until he was officially\n     terminated by WHM on September 11, 2008. Every day that Defendant\n     DISA failed to meet its duty while Plaintiff was an employee meant that he\n     was “inactive” and could not work and earn a living, thereby causing him\n     injury on a daily basis until his September 11, 2008 termination, when that\n     obligation (and Plaintiff’s employment) ceased.\n\n     A cause of action accrues on the date a defendant’s wrongful act causes a\n     legal injury. In addition, because Defendant DISA’s duty continued until\n     his termination, and the continued violations of that duty prevented Plaintiff\n     from becoming “active” and not able to work, the cause of action accrues\n     when the tortious conduct ceases, which would have been when Plaintiff\n     was officially terminated, e.g. September 11, 2008. As such, the\n     continuing tort doctrine applies, the limitations period began on the date\n     the cause of action accrued, which was Plaintiff’s termination date of\n     September 11, 2008, and Plaintiff’s suing and serving DISA in August\n     2010 is timely.\n\n                                          54\n\f       ...\n\n       Even if the accrual date is April 2008, as DISA argues and Plaintiff denies,\n       the limitations should be tolled under the facts of the case, Plaintiff’s due\n       diligence creates a fact issue regarding limitations, and/or DISA and its\n       agents cannot complain when they were clearly aware of suit and their\n       actions prevented timely service.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, appellant also argued the following:\n\n       Plaintiff attempted to bring in the DISA defendant for the first time in\n       February 2010 with the filing of Plaintiff’s Third Amended Petition, well\n       within the statute of limitations period as argued by Defendant DISA. . .\n\n       The pleadings stated “DICA” although the correct entity which Plaintiff’s\n       counsel [later learned] was the proper DISA defendant was listed as\n       “DISA” with the Texas Secretary of State. Plaintiff believed it had the right\n       party and did not take further steps to identify the proper party and/or\n       obtain service based on the representations of Robynn Brown, the owner\n       of Turnaround, Inc. and agent for DISA, that Plaintiff had sued the correct\n       entities and that no further service was necessary. Therefore, simple\n       spelling error was made at the time of filing suit, or attempt to file suit,\n       against DISA in February 2010, and the proper party to the suit was aware\n       of and recognized the suit, and falsely represented that further service\n       was not necessary and that an answer would be filed.\n\n       The statute of limitations is tolled in cases of misnomer where the correct\n       party has been served or is put on notice that he, she, or it is the intended\n       defendant. Under these circumstances, the naming of DISA is a\n       misnomer and the correction in August 2010 relates back to the February\n       2010 filing, since the agent of the correct party, Robynn Brown, was aware\n       of the suit and allegations. Further, Defendant DISA also alleges that\n       even if Plaintiff’s Third Amended Petition filed in February 2010 is a\n       misnomer situation, Plaintiff failed to use due diligence to serve process\n       on either the misnamed defendant or the correct defendant until August\n       2010, which DISA argues is beyond the limitations period. Plaintiff offers\n       the affidavit of his counsel . . . to explain the delay.\n\n       Specifically, based on Ms. Brown’s representations that the correct party\n       had been identified, that no service was necessary, and that an answer for\n       both DISA and Turnaround would be made upon her receipt of the\n       petition, Plaintiff’s counsel did not take any further action to either identify\n       the proper party and/or serve the party it had sued in February until it\n       realized in August 2010 that the correct party has not been included in the\n       petition. In addition to Ms. Brown’s representations, Plaintiff was also\n\n                                             55\n\f       unable to make that determination earlier because the DISA defendant it\n       did sue failed to file any answer after proper service, and the Defendants\n       that had already answered (Exxon and WHM) failed to identify DISA and\n       Turnaround as potential parties pursuant to their obligation of TRCP Rule\n       194.2(b). As such, due diligence in identifying and serving Defendant\n       DISA was clearly used in this case, and at the very least the issue of due\n       diligence as a prerequisite to the tolling of limitations is a fact issue.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, appellant also argued the following:\n\n       In addition, the Texas Supreme Court has recognized that “where a\n       plaintiff has made a mistake in the parties as to the defendant that should\n       have been sued,” like Plaintiff has done in this case, he should be given\n       an opportunity to show that the defendant was aware of the suit, was not\n       misled, or placed at a disadvantage in obtaining evidence to defend the\n       suit before summary judgment is granted. Since this summary judgment\n       was filed mere days after filing an answer, Plaintiff is only seeking the\n       relief that the Texas Supreme Court has said he should be entitled [to]\n       under the circumstances. Again, as the affidavit of Plaintiff’s counsel\n       shows, Defendant DISA’s agent, Robynn Brown, was aware of this suit\n       and claims against DISA and Turnaround in March 2010, within the\n       limitations time period as calculated by Defendants. That was 8 months\n       before the previous November 2010 trial setting in this case and 5 months\n       before the discovery cut-off date as per the Agree Scheduling Order.\n       Further, since the Court has continued the case, Defendant DISA cannot\n       argue that it will be prejudiced or disadvantaged in this case by allowing\n       Plaintiff’s claims to proceed. Lastly, there is no question that there is a\n       relationship between Defendant Brown and Defendant DISA, as Brown\n       and her company, Turnaround, was the authorized agent for DISA where\n       Plaintiff was directed to provide his specimen.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, appellant also argued the following:\n\n       In the unlikely event the Court agrees that limitations accrued in April 2008\n       as argued by DISA, they should not be allowed to assert the defense\n       under the equitable estoppel[] doctrine because DISA and/or its agents\n       caused the delay of which they now complain. There is no question that\n       Plaintiff sued the wrong DISA Defendant on February 23, 2010, which is\n       within the 2 year status [sic] of limitations. However, the reason the\n       proper DISA Defendant was not identified and sued earlier is because its\n       agent Turnaround made false representations to Plaintiff’s counsel which\n       were relied upon to Plaintiff’s detriment.\n\n       Specifically, on or about March 25, 2010, Plaintiff’s counsel was contacted\n       by Robynn Brown via telephone who represented that she was the owner\n       of “the drug testing company”, and requested a copy of the lawsuit to\n\n                                            56\n\f      provide to her attorney. Because of the difficulty in identifying the proper\n      parties and obtaining service, Plaintiff[’]s counsel asked Ms. Brown\n      several times which entity she represented, but she failed and/or refused\n      to clarify. However, Ms. Brown did represent that service was not\n      necessary and that her attorney would be filing an answer on behalf of\n      both DISA and Turnaround once she received the lawsuit, since it was her\n      company that performed the drug testing made the basis of this lawsuit.\n      The following day, Ms. Brown emailed Plaintiff’s counsel again requesting\n      a copy of the lawsuit, to which Plaintiff forwarded to Ms. Brown via email\n      on March 29, 2010. Unfortunately, Ms. Brown never responded again and\n      has yet to be served.\n\n      ...\n\n      The evidence developed to date is clear that Turnaround is the authorized\n      agent for specimen collection for Defendant DISA, the agent that took\n      Plaintiff’s sample for DISA which is the basis of this claim, and that Ms.\n      Brown was at one time the owner of the company. Further, it is clear that\n      Defendants EXXON and WHM, the entities that contracted with, approved,\n      and/or hired DISA and/or Turnaround, failed to properly identify these\n      parties, which left Plaintiff’s counsel guessing on which party to sue.\n      Plaintiff’s counsel used due diligence in trying to find the correct defendant\n      by searching the Texas Secretary of State website and discussing with\n      counsel for Defendants EXXON and WHM on who the proper party was,\n      but to no avail.       Further, Plaintiff and his counsel relied on the\n      representations of the reputed owner of Turnaround, Inc. and/or the agent\n      of Defendant DISA when she said that the proper parties had been found,\n      service was not necessary, and that she would instruct her attorney to file\n      an answer for both defendants. The elements for equitable estoppel[] are\n      met, and DISA should be stopped from asserting a limitations defense.\n\nE. Discussion of DISA’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      First, with respect to appellant’s defamation claim, DISA established that the\n\ncause of action accrued on April 14, 2008, when the allegedly defamatory statement\n\nwas published. See Pitts & Collard, L.L.P. v. Schechter, 369 S.W.3d 301, 323 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (“A defamation cause of action ordinarily\n\naccrues on the date the defamatory matter is published or circulated.”). DISA also\n\nestablished that appellant’s defamation claim has a one-year statute of limitations that\n\nexpired on April 14, 2009. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 16.002(a) (West\n\n                                           57\n\f2002). As set forth above, appellant asserted the continuing-tort doctrine and argued\n\nthat his causes of action accrued in September 2008 (when his employment was\n\nallegedly terminated). Even if that were true with respect to appellant’s defamation\n\nclaim, the claim would still be barred because the one-year limitations period would\n\nhave expired in September 2009, well before appellant filed his third amended petition\n\nin February 2010 and his fourth amended petition in August 2010. As set forth above,\n\nappellant also argued that equitable estoppel barred DISA’s statute of limitations\n\ndefense; however, this argument was not made with respect to appellant’s defamation\n\nclaim. Accordingly, we conclude that DISA established its entitlement to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on appellant’s defamation claim based on its affirmative defense of\n\nlimitations.\n\n       Second, with respect to appellant’s negligence and tortious interference with\n\ncontract claims, appellant asserted that under the continuing-tort doctrine, his causes of\n\naction did not accrue until September 2008. See Markwardt v. Tex. Indus., Inc., 325\n\nS.W.3d 876, 893 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (“[A] continuing tort is\n\nan ongoing wrong causing a continuing injury [that] does not accrue until the tortious act\n\nceases.”). If so, then the two-year limitations period on those claims did not expire until\n\nSeptember 2010 and his claims filed in August 2010 would not be time-barred. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 16.003(a) (West Supp. 2011).\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court has neither “endorsed nor addressed” the continuing-\n\ntort doctrine.   Creditwatch, Inc. v. Jackson, 157 S.W.3d 814, 816 n.8 (Tex. 2005).\n\nTherefore, it is unclear whether the doctrine is viable, as appellant contends. In its\n\nmotion for summary judgment, DISA did not address or attempt to negate the\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\fcontinuing-tort doctrine as a basis for suspending the statute of limitations. See State\n\nFarm Lloyds, 315 S.W.3d at 532 (“Summary judgment may not be affirmed on appeal\n\non a ground not presented to the trial court in the motion.”). Thus, DISA failed to meet\n\nits burden to conclusively establish the limitations bar. See Ray v. O’Neal, 922 S.W.2d\n\n314, 317 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, writ denied) (“When summary judgment is\n\nsought on the ground that limitations has expired, it is the movant’s burden to\n\nconclusively establish the limitations bar, including the negation of a tolling or\n\nsuspension statute raised by the nonmovant.”).\n\n       Furthermore, as set forth above, appellant argued that even if the causes of\n\naction accrued on April 14, 2008, DISA was prohibited from asserting limitations as an\n\naffirmative defense based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel. See Rendon v. Roman\n\nCatholic Diocese of Amarillo, 60 S.W.3d 389, 391 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, pet.\n\ndenied) (“[E]stoppel may be invoked to defeat a claim of limitations.”); see also Johnson\n\n& Higgins of Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d 507, 515–16 (Tex. 1998)\n\n(“[T]he doctrine of equitable estoppel requires: (1) a false representation or concealment\n\nof material facts; (2) made with knowledge, actual or constructive, of those facts; (3)\n\nwith the intention that it should be acted on; (4) to a party without knowledge or means\n\nof   obtaining   knowledge   of   the   facts;    (5)   who   detrimentally relies   on   the\n\nrepresentations.”). DISA did not address or attempt to negate equitable estoppel in its\n\nmotion for summary judgment. See State Farm Lloyds, 315 S.W.3d at 532. Thus,\n\nDISA failed to meet its burden to conclusively establish the limitations bar. See Ray,\n\n922 S.W.2d at 317.\n\n\n\n\n                                             59\n\f       Finally, as set forth above, DISA attempted to negate tolling based on misnomer\n\nby establishing that this was a case of misidentification. “Texas courts have recognized\n\na distinction between misnomer and misidentification.” Enserch Corp. v. Parker, 794\n\nS.W.2d 2, 4 (Tex. 1990).        “If the plaintiff merely misnames the correct defendant\n\n(misnomer), limitations is tolled and a subsequent amendment of the petition relates\n\nback to the date of the original petition.” Id. at 4–5. “If, however, the plaintiff is mistaken\n\nas to which of two defendants is the correct one and there is actually existing a\n\ncorporation with the name of the erroneously named defendant (misidentification), then\n\nthe plaintiff has sued the wrong party and limitations is not tolled.” Id. at 5. In his\n\nresponse, appellant argued that this is a case of misnomer and thus limitations was\n\ntolled. We have already concluded that DISA failed to meet its summary judgment\n\nburden to negate appellant’s assertion of the continuing-tort doctrine and equitable\n\nestoppel. Therefore, it is unnecessary to decide whether DISA negated appellant’s\n\nassertion of misnomer. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n       Accordingly, appellant’s tenth issue is sustained with respect to his causes of\n\naction for negligence and tortious interference with contract and overruled with respect\n\nto his cause of action for defamation.\n\n                      XI. BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST DISA\n\n       In his eleventh issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of DISA on his breach of contract claim. DISA did not move\n\nfor summary judgment on appellant’s breach of contract claim. The trial court’s order\n\ndid not purport to grant summary judgment on appellant’s breach of contract claim. The\n\nclaim was asserted by appellant for the first time in his fifth amended petition, which was\n\n\n\n                                              60\n\fstruck by the trial court. Appellant’s live petition, his fourth amended petition, did not\n\nallege a breach of contract claim. See Randle v. NCNB Tex. Nat’l Bank, 812 S.W.2d\n\n381, 384 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991, no writ) (affirming trial court’s use of first amended\n\noriginal petition as live pleading after court struck second amended original pleading).\n\nTherefore, appellant has not demonstrated that the trial court committed any error\n\ninvolving his purported breach of contract claim.\n\n      Appellant’s eleventh issue is overruled.\n\n                                    XII. CONCLUSION\n\n      The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, as stated\n\nherein, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                       ____________________\n                                                       ROGELIO VALDEZ\n                                                       Chief Justice\n\nDelivered and filed the\n2nd day of May, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n                                           61\n\f",

(“WHM”) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (“Exxon”) and dismissing\n\nappellant’s pattern and practice discrimination claims against WHM and Exxon with\n\nprejudice for lack of jurisdiction; (2) granting summary judgment in favor of WHM on\n\nappellant’s claims for discrimination, retaliation, and defamation; (3) granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Exxon on appellant’s claims for discrimination, retaliation,\n\ndefamation, negligence, and tortious interference with a contract; and (4) granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of appellee DISA, Inc. (“DISA”) on appellant’s claims for\n\ndefamation, negligence, tortious interference with a contract, and breach of contract.\n\n       For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the trial court erred in the\n\nfollowing respects: (1) dismissing appellant’s pattern and practice discrimination claims\n\nagainst WHM and Exxon for lack of jurisdiction; and (2) granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of DISA on appellant’s negligence and tortious interference with a contract claims.\n\nWe overrule appellant’s other issues. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is\n\naffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n       This is an employment-related case involving, among other things, a dispute over\n\nthe accuracy of a workplace drug test and allegations of discrimination based on race or\n\nnational origin. As set forth below, the issues in this case are hotly disputed. The\n\nfollowing facts are not in dispute.\n\n       On April 10, 2008, DISA selected appellant for a random drug test. The parties\n\nagree that, at that time, appellant was employed by WHM and that WHM had engaged\n\nthe services of DISA for purposes of administering its drug and alcohol policy.\n\nAppellant maintains that he was also employed by Exxon, but Exxon denies any\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\femployment relationship. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that appellant worked for WHM\n\nat a facility in Baytown, Texas that is owned and operated by Exxon.\n\n      On April 14, 2008, WHM’s human resources manager, Mark Carter, informed\n\nappellant that there was a “problem” with his test and that he could not return to work for\n\nWHM or be assigned to work at Exxon facilities until he was “active” in DISA.\n\nSubsequently, appellant learned that he had allegedly failed his drug test because his\n\nurine sample allegedly tested positive for marijuana use. Appellant denies that he used\n\nmarijuana, denies that his urine sample tested positive, and denies that he failed his\n\ndrug test. As set forth below, appellant took a second drug test, conducted by a second\n\nfacility, and the second test was negative for marijuana use. Appellant informed DISA\n\nand WHM of his second test.                Nevertheless, appellant’s DISA status remained\n\n“inactive,” and he was not assigned further work.\n\n      On or about August 17, 2008, appellant filed for unemployment benefits with the\n\nTexas Workforce Commission (“TWC”). In September 2008, appellant received a letter\n\nfrom the TWC denying benefits on the basis that his employment with WHM had been\n\nterminated for drug use. On or about November 24, 2008, appellant filed a charge of\n\ndiscrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and the\n\nTexas Workforce Commission Civil Rights Division (“TWC-CRD”). Appellant named\n\nWHM and Exxon as his employers. On May 26, 2009, appellant received a “Notice of\n\nRight to File Civil Action” letter from the TWC-CRD dated May 21, 2009.\n\n      Thereafter, appellant filed suit against WHM, Exxon, DISA, and others.2\n\nAppellant asserted claims against WHM for discrimination, retaliation, and defamation.\n\nAppellant asserted claims against Exxon for discrimination, retaliation, defamation,\n      2\n          WHM, Exxon, and DISA are the only appellees before the Court in this matter.\n\n                                                   3\n\fnegligence, and tortious interference with a contract. Appellant asserted claims against\n\nDISA for defamation, negligence, and tortious interference with a contract. In his fifth\n\namended petition, appellant also asserted a claim against DISA for breach of contract.\n\n       On March 23, 2010, the trial court granted Exxon’s no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment on appellant’s discrimination, retaliation, and defamation claims. On\n\nMarch 23, 2010, the trial court also granted Exxon’s traditional motion for summary\n\njudgment on appellant’s discrimination, retaliation, and defamation claims.             On\n\nNovember 16, 2010, the trial court entered the following orders:\n\n          (1) order granting Exxon and DISA’s motion to strike appellant’s fifth\n              amended original petition;\n\n          (2) order granting WHM and Exxon’s motion to dismiss;\n\n          (3) order granting DISA’s motion for summary judgment;\n\n          (4) order granting Exxon’s traditional and no-evidence motion for\n              summary judgment on all claims; and\n\n          (5) order granting WHM’s traditional and no-evidence motion for\n              summary judgment.\n\nThe trial court did not state the basis for any of its rulings.

Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n       In his live petition, appellant alleged a claim for pattern and practice\n\ndiscrimination as follows:\n\n       Plaintiff Gilberto Rincones asserts and intends to prove that the treatment\n       received by him from the Defendants WHM and EXXON was part of a\n       pattern and practice engaged in by the Defendant employers and their\n       employees towards several individuals similarly situated. This unwritten\n       plan or scheme was to discriminate against, retaliate against, discharge or\n       take some adverse employment action against Plaintiff and other similarly\n       situated Hispanics of Mexican heritage/decent, thereby creating a hostile\n       work environment.\n\nAttached to appellant’s live petition was a copy of his charge of discrimination, filed with\n\nthe EEOC and TWC-CRD, which stated in relevant part as follows:\n\n       I am a 37 year old Hispanic male who worked for WHM since 2007. While\n       working with WHM, I was assigned to work for Exxon, under their direction\n       and control as a Technician. I was a loyal, hardworking, and dedicated\n       employee at all times. As a requirement to work at Exxon, I was required\n       to take a drug test. On April 10, 2008, I was given a random drug test by\n       Turn Around Incorporated, along with other non-Hispanic employees.\n       Thereafter, I was terminated due to allegedly being tested positive for drug\n       use, even though I told my employers that the test was mixed up or false.\n       On April 14, 2008, I went to a lab where I paid for a test to be done, with\n       my own money, which was negative, I provided this information to my\n       employers and complained that other non Hispanic employees were\n       treated differently because they were retested or allowed to prove the test\n       was wrong. However, I was refused my position. I feel I am being\n       discriminated against because I am Hispanic.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f       I believe that I was discriminated against because of my race in the\n       manner described above, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n       1964, as amended; and in violation of the Texas Commission on Human\n       Right[s] Act, and retaliat[ed] against for reporting the harassment and\n       discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as\n       amended, and in violation of the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act.\n\nD. WHM’s and Exxon’s Motion to Dismiss\n\n       In their motion to dismiss, WHM and Exxon argued that the trial court lacked\n\njurisdiction with respect to appellant’s pattern and practice discrimination claims:\n\n       In his pleadings, Plaintiff Gilberto Rincones alleges, among other things,\n       that he was the victim of a purported unidentified pattern and practice of\n       discrimination towards Hispanics generally. However, prior to bringing suit\n       for alleged employment discrimination, all Plaintiffs are required to meet\n       certain statutory prerequisites, such as filing a written, sworn complaint\n       with the Texas Commission of Human Rights, now the Texas Workforce\n       Commission – Civil Rights Division (“TWC-CRD”), and exhausting the\n       administrative procedures of the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act\n       (“TCHRA”). The prerequisites also require that the charge filed identify\n       the particular acts of discrimination alleged.\n\n       Here, Plaintiff . . . failed to comply with the statutory mandate of filing a\n       charge with the TWC-CRD as to his alleged pattern and practice claim.\n       Although Plaintiff partially met the requirements by filing a charge, his\n       charge specifically fails to include facts or allegations that present a\n       “pattern and practice” claim of discrimination. Rather, Plaintiff’s charge\n       only alleges individual discrimination (as opposed to alleging facts that an\n       employer treats a class of individuals in this manner). Accordingly,\n       Plaintiff’s failure to file a charge alleging facts relating to a pattern and\n       practice of discrimination deprives this Court of subject matter jurisdiction\n       over his alleged “pattern and practice” cause of action. Therefore, the\n       Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s claim concerning any alleged pattern and\n       practice of discriminatory conduct based on a lack of subject matter\n       jurisdiction.\n\nE. Appellant’s Response to WHM and Exxon’s Motion to Dismiss\n\n       In his response, appellant argued that there was no merit to the jurisdictional\n\nchallenge made by WHM and Exxon:\n\n       Defendants Exxon and WHM seek to have Plaintiff’s discrimination claims\n       dismissed alleging that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear such\n\n                                             7\n\f      claims because Plaintiff did not use the term “pattern and practice” in the\n      Charge. Because the Charge was sufficient to put Defendants Exxon and\n      WHM on notice of Plaintiff’s discrimination claims and the basis for same\n      (e.g. race/national origin discrimination against Plaintiff, a Hispanic\n      employee), he is entitled to bring all claims reasonably expected to grow\n      from the scope of the agency’s investigation into the Plaintiff’s allegations\n      to the TWC-CRD. As such, Defendants[’] motion to dismiss must be\n      denied.\n\n      Appellant also argued as follows:\n\n      There is no question that Plaintiff’s charge made allegations of improper\n      and discriminatory conduct in regards to the Defendants[’] drug testing\n      policy because he is Hispanic. The evidence developed to date and on\n      file with this Court is clear that non-Hispanic employees were treated\n      differently and allowed to gain “active” status and continue to work in\n      regards to the drug policy, while Plaintiff, a Hispanic individual, was not\n      allowed to regain “active” [status] and was ultimately fired. An EEOC\n      investigation of whether other Hispanics were discriminated against in\n      regards to the implementation of the drug testing policy could reasonably\n      grow out of these [sic] investigation. Therefore, as the 5th Circuit and\n      Texas appellate courts have consistently ruled, Plaintiff’s allegations in the\n      Charge of Discrimination, in and of itself, are sufficient to provide the trial\n      court jurisdiction regarding the allegations or theories which may prove\n      discrimination, including pattern and practice allegations.\n\nF. Discussion of WHM’s and Exxon’s Motion to Dismiss\n\n      As set forth above, a lawsuit under the TCHRA “is limited to the complaints made\n\nin the discrimination charge and factually related claims that could reasonably be\n\nexpected to grow out of the Commission’s investigation of the charge.” Johnson, 127\n\nS.W.3d at 878.    In this case, we conclude that appellant’s claims for pattern and\n\npractice discrimination are factually related to his claims for discrimination based on\n\nrace and national origin. In his charge, appellant alleged that non-Hispanic employees\n\nwere being treated differently. This allegation suggests a group-wide discriminatory\n\npractice in which non-Hispanic employees were treated more favorably than Hispanic\n\nemployees.    Therefore, we conclude that the trial court has jurisdiction to hear\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fappellant’s pattern and practice discrimination claims because they are “factually related\n\nclaims that could reasonably be expected to grow out of the Commission’s investigation\n\nof the charge.” Id.\n\n       Accordingly, appellant’s first issue is sustained.\n\n                         III. DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS AGAINST WHM\n\n       In his second issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of WHM on his claims for discrimination based on race or\n\nnational origin.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color,\n\ndisability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n   (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n       discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with\n       compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n   (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment\n       in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any\n       employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the status\n       of an employee.\n\nTEX.

For this Court to reach a final disposition of\n\nappellant’s second issue, it is only necessary to address the fifth ground for summary\n\njudgment asserted in WHM’s hybrid motion. Accordingly, our discussion of appellant’s\n\nsecond issue will be limited to that ground for summary judgment. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n47.1.4\n\nD. WHM’s Fifth Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n         The fifth ground for summary judgment raised in WHM’s hybrid motion for\n\nsummary judgment is the following:\n\n         To support a claim for disparate treatment as alleged by Plaintiff, he must\n         demonstrate that he was treated differently than other similarly situated\n         persons. In Texas, similarly situated is an exacting standard such that the\n         person used by a plaintiff to support his claim must be “nearly identical.”\n         To be “similarly situated,” Plaintiff must show that the circumstances are\n         comparable in all material respects, including the same conduct, same\n         personnel/supervisor, same job title of employee and same standards.\n\n         It is undisputed that WHM had no involvement in the selection of Plaintiff\n         of any person for random drug testing. Furthermore, Plaintiff has no\n         evidence that non-Hispanics were treated differently. Plaintiff only has\n         hearsay knowledge that some non-Hispanics failed a drug test, but no\n         knowledge as to the circumstances, job description, timing, whether the\n         persons continued working etc. Plaintiff cannot identify any persons to\n         support that non-Hispanics were treated differently in any manner by\n         WHM. Plaintiff cannot identify any other WHM employees that were\n         tested by DISA in April 2008. Plaintiff’s essential complaint is that WHM\n\n         4\n           Specifically, as a result of our holding with respect to WHM’s fifth ground for summary judgment,\nwe conclude that “[t]he issues presented [with respect to WHM’s other grounds] are [consequently] no\nlonger ‘live.’” Bd. of Adjustment of San Antonio v. Wende, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1752426\"><a href=\"/opinion/1752426/board-of-adjustment-of-san-antonio-v-wende/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (Tex. 2002). Our decision\nmust be limited to only those issues “raised and necessary to final disposition of the appeal.” TEX. R. APP.\nP. 47.1.\n\n                                                    15\n\f      simply would not accept Plaintiff’s drug test result from a different, non-\n      DISA approved facility (San Benito Medical Associates) to continue\n      working for WHM at ExxonMobil Baytown. There is no evidence that\n      WHM or DISA or ExxonMobil has ever accepted such a test to substitute\n      for a positive DISA test. Moreover, the complaint is unrelated to any\n      allegations of race/national origin discrimination, and Plaintiff’s conclusory\n      allegations and subjective beliefs are not enough to defeat a properly\n      supported motion for summary judgment.\n\n      Alternatively, Plaintiff may be asserting that non-Hispanics have been\n      allowed to “retest.” However, WHM is not aware of any persons allowed\n      to retest. Simply put, WHMS’s Agreement with ExxonMobil requires that\n      all persons who work on ExxonMobil facilities be DISA active regardless of\n      race/national origin.     Therefore, the evidence shows that Plaintiff’s\n      allegations are without merit, and the Court should grant summary\n      judgment.\n\nIn addition, in its third ground for summary judgment, WHM also argued that there was\n\nno evidence (1) that any person was treated differently or (2) that DISA applied its\n\npolicies and procedures differently to appellant as opposed to any other person. We\n\nconstrue the foregoing as a no-evidence ground for summary judgment.\n\n      As set forth above, WHM argued that there was no evidence that similarly\n\nsituated nonprotected class members were not treated similarly. Specifically, WHM\n\nargued that “Plaintiff cannot identify any persons to support that non-Hispanics were\n\ntreated differently in any manner by WHM.” Thus, to avoid summary judgment, all that\n\nwas required of appellant, as the non-movant, was to produce more than a scintilla of\n\nprobative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether\n\nsimilarly situated nonprotected class members were not treated similarly. See Acosta v.\n\nGov’t Employees Credit Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2537425\"><a href=\"/opinion/2537425/acosta-v-government-employees-credit-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 641 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, no\n\npet.) (explaining that plaintiff “was required to establish, among other things, that she\n\nwas treated less favorably than a similarly situated non-Hispanic employee”).\n\nE. Appellant’s Response to WHM’s Fifth Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n                                           16\n\f      In his response, appellant argued that he “had identified at least 3 other non-\n\nHispanic employees who failed drug tests [and] were allowed to continue working for\n\nWHM at Exxon facilities.” In relevant part, appellant argued as follows:\n\n      Defendant alleges that there [is] no issue of fact regarding Plaintiff’s\n      random selection for drug testing. Plaintiff’s discrimination claim is not\n      based on his selection for drug testing; rather, Plaintiff alleges that\n      Plaintiff, a Hispanic employee of Mexican descent, was treated differently\n      than other, non-Hispanic employees who also tested positive for drugs.\n      For this reason, Plaintiff’s response will focus solely on why that is an\n      issue of material fact.\n\n      Plaintiff identified 3 different WHM employees that were allowed to\n      continue working for WHM after testing positive for drugs. Tom Davis and\n      Mark Sweet (both Anglo Males) and Cooper (Black Male). WHM points to\n      various aspects of Plaintiff’s deposition testimony in support of its position\n      that there is no evidence [of] retaliation; however, Plaintiff’s testimony was\n      clear that when he was told by WHM in April 2008 that he would have to\n      deal with DISA to “work it out,” he did as he was instructed. However,\n      DISA, the designated testing agent for WHM (and by contract EXXON),\n      refused to accept his San Benito test results or allow him to retest, in\n      violation of their own policies. Thereafter, he complained to Mark Carter\n      and 2 other WHM supervisors that WHM employees Davis, Sweet and\n      Cooper who failed the test were allowed to continue working for WHM.\n      Plaintiff was officially terminated approximately 6 months later.\n\n      Plaintiff testified that he complained to WHM that non-Hispanic employees\n      who failed a drug test[] were allowed to continue working after DISA failed\n      to assist him in resolving the issue and prior to his ultimate termination.\n      The affidavit of WHM employee attached as Exhibit “A” to WHM’s motion\n      confirms that Plaintiff complained off [sic] other employees [with] similar\n      situations, who happen to be non-Hispanic, although he denies that\n      Plaintiff mentioned race or national origin. Clearly, material fact issues\n      [exist] regarding Plaintiff’s discrimination claims, and the summary\n      judgment should be denied.\n\n      In its motion for summary judgment, WHM argued the following with respect to\n\nappellant’s testimony: “Importantly, Plaintiff admitted in his deposition that he has no\n\npersonal knowledge that other employees of WHM were treated differently and that his\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fknowledge regarding Tony Davis, or any other person, is based on ‘rumors or hearsay.’”\n\nWHM also argued the following:\n\n      Plaintiff alleges that two WHM employees, Tony Davis and Mark Sweet,\n      were allowed to retest to obtain an “active” DISA status. However it is\n      undisputed that Plaintiff’s allegation is based on rumor and hearsay\n      knowledge. Thus, there is no evidence that any person was treated\n      differently. . . .\n\n      Plaintiff has no evidence that non-Hispanics were treated differently.\n      Plaintiff only has hearsay knowledge that some non-Hispanics failed a\n      drug test, but no knowledge as to the circumstances, job description,\n      timing, whether the persons continued working, etc. Plaintiff cannot\n      identify any persons to support that non-Hispanics were treated differently\n      in any manner by WHM.\n\n      In his response, appellant clarified the nature of his evidence:\n\n      Plaintiff’s evidence is his own testimony. Plaintiffs [sic] have sought\n      relevant discovery to confirm Plaintiff’s allegation; however, Defendant\n      WHM has failed to provide discovery. Plaintiff has a motion to compel on\n      this issue pending with the Court.\n\nIn his response, appellant also stated as follows:\n\n      To be clear, Plaintiff also offers the evidence of the 3 non-Hispanic\n      employees who allegedly failed drug tests but [were] allowed to continue\n      working for WHM as other evidence . . . . However, because Defendants\n      have failed and/or refused to allow discovery regarding these 3\n      [e]mployees, [Plaintiff] can offer nothing more than his own testimony.\n\nF. WHM’s Written Objections to Appellant’s Summary Judgment Evidence\n\n      In addition to the arguments made in its motion for summary judgment, WHM\n\nalso filed objections to appellant’s summary judgment evidence on the following basis:\n\n      Plaintiff’s Response relies on the deposition testimony of Plaintiff, Gilberto\n      Rincones, to establish that other non-Hispanic persons who tested\n      positive were treated differently than Plaintiff (Hispanic) because they\n      were allowed to re-test or continue to work. Specifically, Defendant[]\n      object[]s to Plaintiff’s evidence in paragraph 22, page 15 that “Plaintiff\n      identified 3 different WHM employees that were allowed to continue\n      working for WHM after testing positive for drugs: Tom Davis and Mark\n      Sweet (both Anglo Males) and Cooper (Black Male).” Plaintiff’s purported\n\n                                            18\n\f      evidence is not competent summary judgment evidence as it is\n      inadmissible hearsay and lacks foundation. See TRE 802. See also\n      Plaintiff’s deposition page 210 - 213 (Plaintiff claims “he was told” others\n      tested positive but allowed to work).           The Court should sustain\n      Defendants’ objection and not consider Plaintiff’s evidence.\n\nG.

Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n       In his live petition, appellant alleged that the following occurred after he informed\n\nDISA and WHM of the negative results of the “San Benito” test:\n\n       Plaintiff further requested to be tested again, and/or inquired as to what\n       else needed to be done so that he could go back to work; however,\n       Defendants failed and/or refused his requests and failed to follow all the\n       Defendants[’] drug testing policies.\n\n       Plaintiff also complained that he was aware of other non-Hispanic\n       employees that were allowed to retest as a result of a false positive result\n       and allowed to return to work. Despite Plaintiff’s requests and complaints,\n       Defendants refused and/or failed to provide the opportunity to take\n       another drug test, and [as] a result[,] Defendants WHM and EXXON\n       refused to allow Plaintiff to return to work.\n\n       On or about September 11, 2008[,] Plaintiff learned for the first time that\n       he had been fired after testing positive for drug use. Plaintiff again\n       immediately contacted Defendants WHM and/or Exxon and again\n       complained that other non-Hispanic employees were treated differently\n       because they were either retested or allowed to prove the test was wrong,\n       and were not terminated. However, Plaintiff—a Hispanic-American of\n       Mexican descent/heritage—was refused this opportunity and was told he\n       had been fired.\n\n                                            22\n\f       ...\n\n       Mr. Rincones asserts that he was wrongfully and illegally retaliated against\n       following his opposition and complaint of discrimination.\n\nC. WHM’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n       In its motion for summary judgment, WHM argued as follows:\n\n       Plaintiff was randomly drug tested on April 10, 2008, and his only alleged\n       protected activity was that he complained to WHM on or about April 14,\n       2008. At that time, DISA and WHM informed Plaintiff that he was not\n       allowed to return to an ExxonMobil facility until he became “active” in\n       DISA.\n\n       However, Plaintiff admits that he never complained to WHM that the\n       random drug testing was discriminatory because of his race/national origin\n       (Hispanic). Plaintiff admits that he never “complained [to WHM] that other\n       non-Hispanic employees were being treated differently.” [P]laintiff testified\n       that he only complained to his lawyer. Rather, Plaintiff’s sole complaint at\n       the time was that he never used drugs and the test had to be wrong.\n       Having never complained or opposed any discriminatory practice of which\n       WHM was aware, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of\n       retaliation, and WHM is entitled to summary judgment.\n\n       Additionally, WHM first became aware of any complaint by Plaintiff\n       alleging any form of discrimination when it received the charge of\n       discrimination dated November 24, 2008. On this date, all of the alleged\n       adverse action—being selected for the testing, the test results and the\n       inability to return to work at an ExxonMobil facility—had already occurred\n       and cannot form the basis of any retaliation claim as a matter of law.\n\n       Finally, it is undisputed that WHM took no adverse action in response to\n       Plaintiff’s charge of discrimination. At the time the charge of discrimination\n       was received by WHM, Plaintiff still had the same inactive DISA status\n       and was “ineligible” to work on ExxonMobil property. Plaintiff’s status was\n       the same as it had been since the notification on April 14, 2008. Plaintiff\n       admits that he was not fired by WHM, and he just needed to obtain an\n       active status with DISA to work for WHM on ExxonMobil’s properties.\n       Accordingly, WHM took no adverse action against Plaintiff that can\n       support a claim for retaliation, and summary judgment should be granted.\n\nWe construe the foregoing as a traditional ground for summary judgment, challenging\n\nall three elements of appellant’s prima facie case of retaliation: (1) appellant engaged in\n\n                                            23\n\fa protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) there was a\n\ncausal connection between appellant’s participation in the protected activity and the\n\nadverse employment decision. See West, 89 S.W.3d at 105.\n\nD. WHM’s First Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n      In his live petition, appellant alleged two different protected activities:     (1)\n\nopposing disparate treatment; and (2) filing a charge of discrimination. “[O]pposition to\n\na discriminatory practice is a protected activity under the TCHRA.” Cox & Smith Inc. v.\n\nCook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418667\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418667/cox-smith-inc-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (Tex.

WHM relies on appellant’s deposition\n\ntestimony:\n\n      Q      Now, it says here you complained that other non-Hispanic\n             employees were treated differently. Who did you complain to?\n\n      A      Where does it say that?\n\n      Q      The fourth line up from the bottom of the text of the large paragraph\n             on Page 1 . . . . “And complained that other non-Hispanic\n             employees were treated differently.” You see that?\n\n      A      Yes.\n\n                                           24\n\fQ     Who did you complain to?\n\nA     I told my lawyer.\n\nQ     Okay.

I want to know who you told that to.\n\nA     I didn’t tell anybody that.\n\nQ     You never told anybody that, “This is because I’m Hispanic,” did\n      you?\n\nA     No. I don’t recall saying that.\n\n...\n\nQ     You say you complained. And all you complained of is—what\n      you’re calling complained is you questioned why some other people\n      were working that you believed tested positive?\n\nA     That I believe, yes.\n\nQ     Okay. Had nothing to do with your race?          And you never\n      mentioned your race, did you?\n\nA     To who?\n\nQ     When you complained.\n\nA     They knew my race.\n\nQ     Did you even mention it?\n\n                                        25\n\f      A      No.\n\n      Q      Okay. You never said, “This is because of my race”?\n\n      A      I told them how come—why—why—why those two other guys had\n             been able to work . . . . And the black guy. And I wasn’t.\n\n      Q      You didn’t say—did you say, “Why am I being denied work because\n             I’m Hispanic”? Did you mention that?\n\n      ...\n\n      A      I don’t recall.\n\n      Q      Okay. Did you say, “Why are you letting black guys work”?\n\n      A      No, I didn’t.\n\n      Q      You just said, “Why does Tony Davis get to work,” right?\n\n      A      Yes.\n\n      Q      “And why is Mr. Cooper getting . . . [to work],” correct?\n\n      A      Correct.\n\n      Q      That’s all you said; is that correct?\n\n      A    Yes.\n      We conclude that the foregoing demonstrates that appellant never actually\n\ncomplained to WHM that he was being treated differently based on his race or national\n\norigin. Appellant testified that he told his lawyer that non-Hispanic employees were\n\nbeing treated differently. However, appellant testified that he never complained to WHM\n\nthat he was being treated differently because he was Hispanic. According to appellant,\n\nhe asked WHM why two other employees were allowed to work and he was not.\n\nAppellant asked why he was being treated differently. He did not state that he was\n\nbeing treated differently because of his race or national origin. He did not state that\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fnon-Hispanic employees were being treated differently.

After WHM refused to allow\n       him back to work at Exxon, Plaintiff complained to WHM management and\n       supervisors that other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug tests were\n       allowed to continue working. Plaintiff was fired for allegedly failing a drug\n       test in September 2008, after he had complained of the disparate\n       treatment of other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug tests but were\n       allowed to continue working for WHM and Exxon . . . .

Discussion of WHM’s First Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n       Although appellant argued that this evidence establishes that he “complained of\n\nthe disparate treatment of other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug tests but were\n\nallowed to continue working for WHM,” we disagree.              According to appellant’s\n\ntestimony, he asked why the other employees were allowed to continue working. He\n\ndid not state that he was being treated differently because of his race or national origin.\n\nAppellant’s questions did not “voice opposition” to any alleged discrimination. See City\n\nof Waco, 259 S.W.3d at 152. Again, appellant’s questions may have hinted at a vague\n\npossibility of discrimination, but that is not protected activity. See Azubuike, 970 S.W.2d\n\nat 65. Even if appellant believed otherwise, his deposition testimony does not establish\n\nthat he actually reported discriminatory conduct to WHM.         See Cox & Smith, 974\n\n                                            29\n\fS.W.2d at 224; see also Niu v. Revcor Molded Prods.

(“[A]n employee’s subjective beliefs of retaliation are\n\nmerely conclusions and do not raise a fact issue precluding summary judgment in a\n\nretaliatory discharge claim.”).   Accordingly, we conclude that WHM established that\n\nappellant did not engage in the protected activity of opposing a discriminatory practice.\n\n       As set forth above, however, appellant did engage in the protected activity of\n\nfiling a charge of discrimination. Accordingly, we consider WHM’s grounds for summary\n\njudgment with respect to appellant’s claim of retaliation based on this protected activity.\n\nG. WHM’s Second Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n       As set forth above, WHM also moved for summary judgment on the basis that it\n\nhad negated the element of adverse action.         WHM’s summary judgment evidence\n\nestablished that appellant’s charge of discrimination was dated November 24, 2008.\n\nAccording to WHM, “[o]n this date, all of the alleged adverse action—being selected for\n\nthe testing, the test results and the inability to return to work at an ExxonMobil—had\n\nalready occurred and cannot form the basis of any retaliation claim as a matter of law.”\n\nAccording to WHM, “[a]t the time the charge of discrimination was received by WHM,\n\nPlaintiff still had the same inactive DISA status and was ‘ineligible’ to work on\n\nExxonMobil property.      Plaintiff’s status was the same as it had been since the\n\nnotification on April 14, 2008.” Accordingly, we conclude that the burden shifted to\n\nappellant to produce competent summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding whether he suffered an adverse employment action as a result of\n\nhis charge of discrimination. See M. D. Anderson, 28 S.W.3d at 23.\n\nH. Appellant’s Response to WHM’s Second Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\f      In his response, appellant argued that he had produced “some evidence” that he\n\nwas terminated “after he complained other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug\n\ntests were allowed to continue working for Exxon.” In his response, however, appellant\n\nalso states that “Defendant WHM officially terminated Plaintiff on September 2008.”\n\nI. Discussion of WHM’s Second Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n      In his response, appellant did not argue or attempt to offer evidence that he\n\nsuffered any adverse employment action after he was terminated in September 2008.\n\nMoreover, appellant did not argue or offer any evidence to establish that he suffered\n\nany adverse employment action in response to his charge of discrimination dated\n\nNovember 24, 2008.      Accordingly, we conclude that WHM established that it was\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n      Appellant’s third issue is overruled.\n\n              V. DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION CLAIMS AGAINST EXXON\n\n      In his fourth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting Exxon’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on his claims for discrimination and retaliation because\n\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether Exxon was his employer\n\nunder a theory of indirect employment. In his fifth issue, appellant argues that the trial\n\ncourt erred in granting Exxon’s motion for summary judgment on his claims for\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation because there is a genuine issue of material fact with\n\nregard to whether Exxon was his employer under a theory of joint employment.\n\nA. Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued that it was\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on appellant’s claim for discrimination because,\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\famong other things, there is no evidence that “non-protected class employees (non-\n\nHispanics) were treated differently.”6 In addition, Exxon argued that it was entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law on appellant’s claims for retaliation because, among other\n\nthings, there is no evidence that appellant opposed a discriminatory practice or\n\ncomplained to Exxon about a discriminatory practice prior to his termination.7 As noted\n\nabove, the trial court granted Exxon’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment.\n\nB. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n        In his response, appellant argued in relevant part as follows:\n\n        [T]here is ample evidence attached that . . . other non-Hispanic employees\n        were allowed to continue working for Exxon after failing drug tests. In\n        addition, Plaintiff has provided some evidence that he was terminated\n        after he complained that other non-Hispanic employees who failed drug\n        tests were allowed to continue working for Exxon. Therefore, Plaintiff has\n        supported the elements for his discrimination and retaliation claims\n        [against Exxon.]\n\nThe evidence on which appellant relied was his deposition testimony, which we quoted\n\nin relevant part in our analysis of appellant’s second and third issues.\n\nC. Discussion\n\n        Assuming without deciding that Exxon was appellant’s employer, we conclude\n\nthat Exxon nevertheless established its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on\n\nboth claims. For the reasons set forth above in our discussion of appellant’s second\n\nissue, we conclude that there is no competent evidence that similarly situated\n\nnonprotected class members were not treated similarly.                   See TEX. R. APP.

DEFAMATION CLAIM AGAINST WHM\n\n       In his sixth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of WHM on his defamation claim.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       A defamation claim of a private plaintiff against a non-media defendant consists\n\nof five elements:\n\n       1.     the defendant published a factual statement about the plaintiff;\n\n       2.     the statement was defamatory;\n\n       3.     the statement was false;\n\n       4.     the defendant acted with negligence concerning the truth of the\n              statement; and\n\n       5.     the plaintiff suffered injury.\n\nWFAA-TV, Inc. v.

Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n          In his live petition, appellant alleged the following with respect to his defamation\n\nclaims:\n\n          Defendants, by and through their agents, servants and employees,\n          through the careless, inaccurate and negligent drug testing of Plaintiff,\n          made certain statements about the Plaintiff that were false; namely, that\n          Plaintiff tested positive for illicit and/or illegal drug use. Defendants\n          continued to make such false and malicious statements even after [they\n          were] provided with proof that such statements were false which raised\n          concerns that Plaintiff had abused illicit and illegal drugs, thus attacking\n          and damaging Plaintiff’s reputation, character, credibility, and integrity.\n          The inaccurate test results not only directly caused Plaintiff to lose his job,\n          but damaged Plaintiff’s reputation, credibility, and integrity, as he has a\n          history of being an honest individual who never used illicit drugs. Further,\n          these statements were published, in the form of the false and inaccurate\n          test results, to the Plaintiff and others, including Plaintiff’s current\n          employer, L & F Distributors. These publications were made with malice\n\n                                                34\n\fand lack of good faith. These defamatory statements have injured the\nPlaintiff in his business, trade, occupation and/or profession, and in his\nability to obtain future similar employment.\n\nDefendants disseminated and further published the inaccurate test results\nto other parties, namely the Texas Work Force Commission and others,\nfurther damaging the Plaintiff’s reputation, credibility and integrity. In\naddition, because the Defendant employers relied on the false-positive\ndrug test as the reason or basis of their termination and/or refusal to put\nPlaintiff to work, they knew or should have known that Plaintiff would have\nto publish this fact to future or prospective employers, which in fact\nPlaintiff was required to do. As such, Plaintiff was forced to disclose, and\ndid disclose to his current employer, L & F Distributors, the reasons for his\ntermination from the Defendants.\n\nDefendants knew that Plaintiff had obtained drug test results that\ncontradicted the results of the first test by the Defendant laboratory, knew\nthat Plaintiff complained that there were problems with the drug test that\nquestioned its veracity, but callously failed to include that fact when they\ndisseminated and published the Plaintiff’s alleged illicit drug use to the\nTexas Work Force Commission and others. Further, Defendants knew or\nshould have known that by using a questionable drug test that falsely\naccused Plaintiff of illicit and illegal drug use to a government entity,\nthereby making it public record, would require Plaintiff to disclose that fact\nto others, including potential employers, and in fact Plaintiff was forced to\ndisclose, and did disclose to his current employer, L & F Distributors.\nThese publications were made with malice and/or a lack of good faith and\nhave injured the Plaintiff in his business, trade, occupation and/or\nprofession, and in his ability to obtain future similar employment.\n\nA reasonably prudent person and/or company would have known and\nforeseen that Plaintiff would have been compelled to communicate the\nreason and basis of his termination to third parties when Plaintiff sought\nemployment, particularly since it was used as the basis for Plaintiff’s\ntermination and denial of Plaintiff’s unemployment benefits. Additionally,\nPlaintiff was compelled to communicate the reason for his termination to\nthird parties on several occasions, including to Plaintiff’s current employer,\nL & F Distributors. Defendants are liable for the repetition of the reason\nfor and the basis of Plaintiff’s termination. Further, Defendants, by and\nthrough their agents, servants, and employees communicated to others\nthat Plaintiff had tested positive for illicit drug use, when in fact he\ncontested the validity of the test, provided proof to Defendants that the\ntests were incorrect, and requested re-testing.\n\nIn addition, appellant also alleged an agency relationship as follows:\n\n\n\n                                     35\n\f       At all times whenever an employee, supervisor, manager, agent, attorney,\n       representative, contractor, and/or servant of Defendants DISA, Dallas\n       Mentor, and SAFETY TURN-A-ROUND performed some act in relation to\n       the incident made the basis of this lawsuit, such individual was performing\n       acts in such a manner that Defendants WHM and Exxon are liable for the\n       misconduct of Defendant DISA, Dallas Mentor, and SAFETY TURN-A-\n       ROUND employees, supervisors, managers, agents, representatives,\n       contractors, and/or servants.\n\nC. WHM’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n       In its traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment, WHM argued in\n\nrelevant part as follows:\n\n       Plaintiff has not identified any false statement by WHM and has admitted\n       that he has no evidence of any false statement by WHM that can support\n       a claim for defamation. Plaintiff admitted that he has no evidence that his\n       April 10, 2008 drug screen is false or inaccurate. Plaintiff was advised\n       that he could retest the same sample with DISA, but he did not. Plaintiff\n       admitted that he took no action to prove that his sample provided and\n       tested by DISA standards was not in fact his own. Plaintiff testified that he\n       did not request a DNA test on his April 10, 2008 sample. As an initial\n       premise, however, as stated above, WHM has never made a defamatory\n       statement. As admitted by Plaintiff all that WHM has ever stated is that\n       Plaintiff needed to get it (his test results) cleared with DISA. Plaintiff has\n       repeatedly indicated that WHM’s statements are literally true. Plaintiff has\n       not identified any false statement to support a claim of defamation.\n       Consequently, WHM is entitled to summary judgment.\n\n       In addition to the foregoing, WHM also argued that it was entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law because any alleged statement by WHM was protected by qualified or\n\nabsolute privilege:\n\n       Plaintiff cannot identify any false statements made by WHM or any\n       statements made with malice that are not protected by the qualified\n       privilege. Moreover, even if any false statements were made, Plaintiff has\n       no evidence that any statement made by WHM was not privileged or that it\n       was motivated by actual malice to defeat such privilege. The only\n       asserted defamatory statement was the notice from the Texas Workforce\n       Commission relating to Plaintiff’s unemployment benefits. Plaintiff claims\n       it was defamatory to be “terminated.” Plaintiff has not identified any\n       persons other than ExxonMobil and the Texas Workforce Commission to\n       which any communication occurred, any statements made by WHM are\n\n                                            36\n\f       protected by qualified privilege because they were limited to parties with a\n       legitimate business interest (Exxon Mobil) and in response to Plaintiff’s\n       claim with the Texas Workforce Commission, which Plaintiff initiated\n       himself.    Statements made during Texas Workforce Commission\n       proceedings are privileged. Moreover, as a condition of Plaintiff’s\n       employment with WHM, Plaintiff consented to become and remain DISA\n       active. Thus, Plaintiff’s defamation claims fail, and summary judgment for\n       WHM is proper.\n\n       With respect to appellant’s self-compelled defamation allegations, WHM argued\n\nas follows:\n\n       Plaintiff also makes a claim for “self-compelled” defamation. In particular,\n       he claims that he was compelled to tell family members and his current\n       employer that he was discharged because he failed a drug test.\n\n       ...\n\n       Even assuming, arguendo, that WHM’s comments to Plaintiff were\n       somehow defamatory, to establish self-compelled defamation Plaintiff\n       must provide evidence that he was unaware of the alleged defamatory\n       nature of the communication at the time he published his positive drug test\n       results to third parties.\n\n       Clearly, Plaintiff was aware of the derogatory content of his own\n       statements, and he told several third parties that he tested positive for\n       marijuana, including his current employer. Notably, this information did\n       not prevent his current employer from hiring him or cause him to lose\n       friends or acquaintances. Thus, no evidence exists to support Plaintiff’s\n       claim of self-compelled defamation, and WHM is entitled to judgment as a\n       matter of law.\n\nD. Appellant’s Response to WHM’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n       In his response, appellant argued in relevant part as follows:\n\n       WHM alleges that there is no evidence that it made any statements\n       regarding Plaintiff’s failed drug test. However, WHM fails to acknowledge\n       the potential liability for the defamatory statements made by its agent,\n       Defendant DISA and/or its laboratory Defendant Dallas Mentor, to whom\n       WHM gave express and implied authority to carry out its drug testing\n       policy. There is no question DISA and/or Dallas Mentor have stated that\n       Plaintiff used marijuana, and failed a random drug test. As set forth\n       above, the attached evidence clearly shows that there is a genuine issue\n       of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff did, in fact, use illegal drugs\n\n                                            37\n\f      and fail the drug test, including a second “clean” drug test taken a few\n      days later. As such, the defamatory statements of DISA and/or Dallas\n      Mentor, which are WHM’s (as well as Exxon’s agents) agents and\n      representatives for drug testing, are impugned to WHM for these false\n      statements.\n\n      WHM also argues that there is no evidence that it published any false\n      statements regarding Plaintiff. First, as indicated above, DISA’s and/or\n      Dallas Mentor’s conduct of falsely accusing Plaintiff of using drugs and\n      failing a drug test is impugned to WHM, as its agent for the\n      implementation of it’s [sic] drug policy. Second, while WHM is correct that\n      the Texas Supreme Court has not expressly accepted or rejected the\n      doctrine of self-publication, several courts of appeals, including the 13th\n      Court, have accepted the doctrine. Further, WHM misstates the law that\n      these appellate courts require a showing that the Plaintiff must not know\n      the statement was defamatory when he self-published it, nor is that the\n      standard set forth by the 13th Court of Appeals.\n\nE. Discussion\n\n      On appeal, appellant argues the following:\n\n      Rincones does not deny that WHM and Exxon may have an affirmative\n      defense of qualified privilege. The privilege, however, is not absolute; it is\n      lost when statements are made with actual malice . . . .\n\n      Inasmuch as Rincones submitted evidence that WHM republished the\n      DISA drug test results after it knew he alleged they were false, and\n      provided proof to WHM that they were false, without also publishing those\n      facts, WHM’s and Exxon’s qualified immunity does not apply because they\n      were made with actual malice. At the very least, genuine issues of\n      material fact exist regarding whether the privilege applies, and the trial\n      court’s granting of summary judgment was error.\n\n      As set forth above, the trial court did not specify the grounds on which it granted\n\nWHM’s motion for summary judgment on appellant’s claim for defamation. Therefore,\n\nto successfully challenge the summary judgment on appeal, it is appellant’s burden to\n\nnegate each possible ground for summary judgment. See Kiger v.

One such ground is the affirmative defense of qualified privilege.\n\nSee Johnson, 891 S.W.2d at 646.\n\n      Appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on this\n\nbasis because he presented summary judgment evidence to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding whether the privilege applies; however, as noted above, in his\n\nresponse to WHM’s motion for summary judgment, appellant did not make this\n\nargument or direct the trial court’s attention to the evidence that arguably raises a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.

Accordingly, we conclude that appellant has not demonstrated that the trial\n\ncourt committed reversible error in granting summary judgment in favor of WHM on his\n\ndefamation claim.\n\n      Appellant’s sixth issue is overruled.\n\n                        VII. DEFAMATION CLAIM AGAINST EXXON\n\n      In his seventh issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Exxon on his defamation claim.\n\nA. Exxon’s No-Evidence Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued that it was\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on appellant’s defamation claim on the following\n\ngrounds:\n\n      In this case, Plaintiff has no evidence of any written or oral false statement\n      made by ExxonMobil to support any claim of defamation. To be sure,\n      Plaintiff has not and cannot identify any false statement made by\n      ExxonMobil to support his defamation claim. Thus, without evidence of\n      any written or oral false statement made by ExxonMobil, Plaintiff’s\n      defamation claims fail. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate.\n\n      ...\n\n      Although the Texas Supreme Court has yet to adopt or approve a cause\n      of action for self-compelled defamation, some authorities indicate that self-\n      publication of a defamatory statement occurs: (1) if the defamed person’s\n      communication of the defamatory statements to the third person was\n      made without an awareness of their defamatory nature; and (2) if the\n      circumstances indicated that communication to a third party was likely. As\n      noted above, truth is a complete defense to a defamation case.\n\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\f     Here, Plaintiff’s self-compelled defamation claim fails as he has no\n     evidence of any false statement made by ExxonMobil. Further, Plaintiff’s\n     self-compelled defamation claim fails because he has no evidence of and\n     cannot prove that he was unaware of the nature of publishing his positive\n     test results to third-parties, including his current employer. Moreover,\n     because truth, even substantial truth, is a defendant to defamation claims,\n     Plaintiff’s claim is defeated by the fact that he has no evidence that the\n     drug test result he received for the sample he provided to DISA on April\n     10, 2008 was false. Thus, based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s claim for self-\n     compelled defamation also fails, and summary judgment should be\n     granted.\n\nB. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s No-Evidence Grounds\n\n     In his response, appellant argued as follows:\n\n     Defendant Exxon alleged that there is no evidence that Defendant Exxon\n     made any statement regarding Plaintiff’s failed drug test. However, Exxon\n     fails to acknowledge the potential liability for the defamatory statements\n     made by its agent, Defendants DICA [sic] and/or Dallas Mentor, to whom\n     Exxon gave express and implied authority to carry out its drug testing\n     policy. There is no question that Defendants DICA [sic] and/or Dallas\n     Mentor have stated that Plaintiff used marijuana, and failed a random drug\n     test. As set forth above, the attached evidence clearly shows that there is\n     a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff did, in fact, use\n     illegal drugs and fail the drug test, as alleged by Defendants DICA [sic]\n     and/or Dallas Mentor. As such, the defamatory statements of Defendants\n     DICA [sic] and/or Dallas Mentor, which are Exxon’s agents and\n     representative for drug testing, are impugned to Defendant Exxon for\n     these false statements.\n\n     Defendant Exxon also alleges that there is no evidence that it published\n     any false statements regarding Plaintiff. First, as indicated above,\n     Defendant DICA’s [sic] and/or Dallas Mentor’s conduct of falsely accusing\n     Plaintiff of using illegal drugs and failing a drug test is impugned to\n     Defendant Exxon, as its agent for the implementation of Exxon’s drug\n     policy. Second, while Defendant Exxon is correct that the Texas Supreme\n     Court has not expressly accepted or rejected the doctrine of self-\n     publication, several courts of appeals, including the 13th Court, have\n     accepted that doctrine based upon whether it was reasonably foreseeable\n     that a plaintiff would be required to advise others, including potential\n     employers, of the defamatory statements.\n\n\n\nC. Discussion of Exxon’s No-Evidence Grounds\n\n                                          41\n\f      To avoid summary judgment, appellant had the burden to produce more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence to establish that Exxon made a false statement about him. See\n\nZapata, 997 S.W.2d at 747. In his response, appellant relied on summary judgment\n\nevidence that established that DISA stated to WHM that appellant had failed his random\n\ndrug test. As noted above, appellant pled an agency relationship between DISA and\n\nExxon.   In his response, appellant argued that Exxon had failed to address the\n\nstatement DISA made to WHM, which appellant maintains was false and also imputed\n\nto Exxon by virtue of the alleged agency relationship. Exxon did not argue by written\n\nmotion, answer, or response that the allegedly false statement made by DISA to WHM\n\nwas not imputed to Exxon by virtue of the agency relationship alleged by appellant.

Exxon’s Traditional Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its traditional motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued, among other\n\nthings, that “Plaintiff cannot identify any false statements made by ExxonMobil or any\n\nstatements made with malice that are not protected by the qualified privilege.”\n\nE. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s Traditional Grounds\n\n      We have reviewed the record, and there is no indication that appellant filed a\n\nresponse to Exxon’s traditional motion for summary judgment.\n\nF. Discussion of Exxon’s Traditional Grounds\n\n\n\n                                           42\n\f      As set forth above, in his appellate brief, appellant does not dispute that Exxon\n\nhas an affirmative defense based on qualified privilege, but he maintains that the\n\nprivilege does not apply to statements made with malice. Although appellant maintains\n\nthat his summary judgment evidence was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material\n\nfact about whether the statements at issue were made with malice, he failed to make\n\nthat argument in a written response to Exxon’s traditional motion for summary judgment.\n\nSee Swinehart, 48 S.W.3d at 885 (“A summary judgment may not be reversed on a\n\nground not raised in the trial court.”). Therefore, appellant cannot make this argument\n\nfor the first time on appeal. See Roark, 813 S.W.2d at 495; Pinnacle Anesthesia, 359\n\nS.W.3d at 397 (“[W]e cannot reverse a summary judgment on a ground not raised\n\nbelow.”). Accordingly, we conclude that appellant has not established that the trial court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Exxon on his defamation claim.\n\n      Appellant’s seventh issue is overruled.\n\n                        VIII. NEGLIGENCE CLAIM AGAINST EXXON\n\n      In his eighth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Exxon on his negligence claim.\n\nA.

Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n       In his live petition, appellant alleged the following:\n\n       The Defendants DISA, DALLAS MENTOR, AND SAFETY TURN-A-\n       ROUND and EXXON owed a duty to Plaintiff to properly and accurately\n       test and analyze Plaintiff’s drug test results, as well as follow its rules,\n       regulations and protocol for such testing. Through their acts and\n       omissions herein set forth, these Defendants breached that duty to\n       Plaintiff. Specifically, these Defendants were negligent as follows:\n\n         a. Improperly administering a random drug test to Plaintiff;\n\n         b. Inaccurately analyzing the drug test results;\n\n         c. Failing to thoroughly investigate and compare its test results with the\n            test results obtained by Plaintiff through LabCorp Houston, once it\n            was informed by Plaintiff of the second test results; and\n\n         d. Failing to follow the Federal Drug Administration’s recommendations\n            that positive results be confirmed using a different test method;\n\n         e. Failing to advise Plaintiff’s employers that a positive test result does\n            not always mean a person took illegal drugs, as a variety of facts\n            can influence the reliability of drug tests;\n\n         f. Disseminating the drug test results, without thoroughly verifying their\n            accuracy, to Plaintiff’s employers, which they knew, or should have\n            known, would lead to Plaintiff’s termination; and\n\n         g. Failing to allow Plaintiff to properly retest to contest the false positive\n            result.\n\n       The acts and/or omissions of these Defendants as set forth above are the\n       proximate cause of damages sustained by Plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n                                              44\n\fIn addition to the foregoing, appellant also pled that “[a]t all times, Defendant EXXON\n\nsupervised and/or controlled Plaintiff’s work assignments, schedule and duties; as such,\n\nDefendant EXXON was also Plaintiff’s employer for all intents and purposes.”\n\nC. Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued\n\nfor summary judgment on the following grounds:\n\n      Plaintiff waived any and all claims related to substance abuse testing\n      based on his consent to WHM’s Substance Abuse Policy. As a condition\n      of Plaintiff’s employment, he was required to enroll with DISA pursuant to\n      WHM’s Substance Abuse Policy. Plaintiff agreed to this policy and was a\n      DISA participant. Importantly, the Agreement signed by Plaintiff includes\n      a waiver of claims. The Agreement and consent form states that Plaintiff\n      agrees to “hold WHM . . . harmless from any and all liability in connection\n      with the testing for drug[s].” Because Plaintiff expressly agreed to waive\n      any and all claims based on substance abuse testing, his remaining\n      claims alleged in his [live petition (i.e., negligence and tortious interference\n      with a contract)] fail, and summary judgment is appropriate.\n\n      ...\n\n      Plaintiff alleges that ExxonMobil is liable for negligence based on an\n      agency theory for the alleged acts or omissions of Dallas Mentor (a DISA-\n      approved substance abuse testing collection site) and DISA (a third-party\n      substance abuse testing administrator). Thus, Plaintiff must prove that\n      Defendant owed Plaintiff a legal duty, breached the legal duty and that\n      damages proximately resulted from the breach. However, Plaintiff cannot\n      prove the essential elements of this cause of action. Moreover, even if he\n      could, Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the\n      Texas Workers’ Compensation Act.          Thus, summary judgment for\n      ExxonMobil on Plaintiff’s negligence claims is proper.\n\n      ...\n\n      Plaintiff has no evidence that ExxonMobil owed any duty to Plaintiff.\n      ExxonMobil was not Plaintiff’s employer. ExxonMobil did not have a\n      contract with Plaintiff, DISA or Dallas Mentor. Notwithstanding, even if a\n      duty existed, Plaintiff has no evidence of a breach of any supposed duty.\n      Thus, summary judgment is proper.\n\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\f     Under an agency theory, Plaintiff alleges that ExxonMobil is liable for the\n     alleged acts of third parties—DISA and Dallas Mentor. However, Plaintiff\n     has no evidence of any agency relationship between ExxonMobil and\n     either Dallas Mentor (DISA-approved substance abuse testing collection\n     site) or DISA (the third party substance abuse testing administrator). In\n     fact, ExxonMobil has no contractual relationship with either DISA or Dallas\n     Mentor and denies any agency relationship. ExxonMobil does not control\n     the means or manner that DISA or Dallas Mentor operate their companies.\n     ExxonMobil does not have any employees onsite at DISA or Dallas\n     Mentor. Plaintiff has no evidence to indicate that anyone at ExxonMobil\n     was present or participated in any way related to his substance abuse\n     testing. To be clear, DISA’s contractual relationship is with WHM, not\n     ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil has no role in selecting Dallas Mentor as the\n     collection site for Rincones to submit his drug testing sample on or about\n     April 10, 2008. In accordance with its Agreement with WHM, ExxonMobil\n     is only concerned with the information it receives from WHM as to whether\n     individuals are qualified to work under Exhibit H to the Agreement. Thus,\n     summary judgment is proper.\n\nD. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n     In his response, appellant argued as follows:\n\n     First and foremost, nowhere in the alleged release is Defendant WHM’s\n     sole client, Exxon, mentioned in the alleged waiver. Second, even if\n     Exxon was listed, the release relied on by Defendant Exxon is neither\n     conspicuous nor sufficiently specific to put Plaintiff on notice of his waiver\n     of claims as required by the Texas Supreme Court . . . . Third, Exxon has\n     produced no evidence that the alleged waiver was supported by any\n     consideration, a requirement for a valid, enforceable contract . . . .\n\n     For this reason, Defendant Exxon’s basis for summary judgment must fail.\n\n     ...\n\n     Exxon [also] argues that it had no duty to Plaintiff in regards to the drug\n     testing it required WHM and its employees (including Plaintiff) [to] undergo\n     in order to work at Exxon facilities.\n\n     The existence of a duty is generally a question of law. Generally\n     speaking, foreseeability of the risk is the most important factor courts look\n     at to determine if a duty exists, which includes whether the injury to the\n     plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable. It is undisputed that the results of a\n     positive drug test—even one in error—was that Plaintiff would be\n     “inactive” and unable to work at an Exxon facility, which is the sole source\n     or location for WHM employees. As such, a false positive drug test which\n\n                                          46\n\f      requires that Plaintiff not be allowed to work and/or would cause Plaintiff to\n      lose his job was clearly foreseeable, and a duty does exist for Exxon.\n\n      Further, Plaintiff is not making any failure-to-warn or negligent\n      misrepresentation claim against Exxon. Rather, Plaintiff is alleging that\n      Defendant DISA owed a duty to Plaintiff to use reasonable care in\n      performing the tests and reporting the results, and that Exxon and WHM\n      empowered DISA (as well as other TPAs) as agents to implement its drug\n      testing policy. As such, Exxon is liable as the principal where DISA and/or\n      its drug testing contractors are negligent in performing the test. An agent\n      is a person who is authorized by the principal to transact business or\n      manage some affair on the principal’s behalf, such as the implementing of\n      Exxon’s and WHM’s drug testing policy.\n\n      In addition, because Exxon specifically required WHM, Plaintiff’s\n      employer, to use one of a limited number of specific third-party\n      administrators (TPAs) to perform drug testing and follow rigid testing\n      guidelines, Exxon has a duty to ensure that the TPAs are proper, valid\n      entities that use proper protocol and guidelines for testing. The evidence\n      attached to this motion is that the TPA, Defendant DISA, did not follow the\n      proper protocol and guidelines, and in fact mixed-up Plaintiff’s urine so\n      that a false result was found that [sic] which prevented Plaintiff from being\n      able to work with WHM. While Exxon and WHM want to argue that it was\n      not the employer and did not choose the specific TPA (i.e. DISA) that\n      performed the bad test, these arguments merely illustrate the fact that\n      there are material issue of fact regarding Exxon’s duty.\n\n      Exxon argues that even if a duty can be found, it cannot be held liable\n      under the Texas Workers Compensation Act (TWCA) exclusive remedy\n      bar. Despite arguing ad nausea that Exxon was not Plaintiff’s employer\n      (and in fact was one of the basis for this Court’s previous granting of\n      Exxon’s first summary judgment), Exxon seeks to invoke the exclusive\n      remedy of the Texas Workers without clearly defining how it takes\n      advantage of this defense while maintaining its position that it was not\n      Plaintiff’s employer. The TWCA exclusive remedy defense is available to\n      employers only.\n\nE. Discussion of Exxon’s Fourth Ground for Summary Judgment\n\n      In its fourth ground, Exxon argued that, even if there was evidence of a duty,\n\nthere was no evidence of a breach.       In his response, appellant argued that “[t]he\n\nevidence . . . is that the TPA, Defendant DISA, did not follow the proper protocols and\n\nguidelines.” Yet, this argument was made with respect to the existence of a duty, not\n\n                                           47\n\fwith respect to the challenged element of breach.          We have reviewed appellant’s\n\nresponse and conclude that appellant failed to respond to Exxon’s no-evidence point\n\nregarding the element of breach. See Roark, 813 S.W.2d at 495 (“Under rule 166a(c) of\n\nour Rules of Civil Procedure, issues that are not expressly presented to the trial court by\n\nwritten motion, answer or response will not serve as grounds for reversal of a summary\n\njudgment on appeal.”). In his response, appellant did not direct the trial court’s attention\n\nto any evidence that arguably raised a fact issue about whether Exxon breached a duty\n\nowed to appellant. In his appellate brief, appellant does not address the element of\n\nbreach or whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on that basis.\n\nSee Kiger, 376 S.W.3d at 290 (“When, as in this case, the trial court does not state the\n\nbasis for granting summary judgment, the appellant must show on appeal that each\n\nindependent ground alleged is insufficient to support the summary judgment granted.”).\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that appellant has failed to meet his burden to negate all\n\npossible grounds for the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of Exxon on his\n\nnegligence claim.\n\n       Appellant’s eighth issue is overruled.\n\n         IX. CLAIM AGAINST EXXON FOR TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT\n\n       In his ninth issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Exxon on his tortious interference with a contract claim.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       A claim for tortious interference with a contract consists of four elements: (1) the\n\nexistence of a contract subject to interference; (2) willful and intentional interference; (3)\n\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\finterference that proximately caused damage; and (4) actual damage or loss.

McLaughlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788581\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788581/acs-investors-inc-v-mclaughlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430 (Tex. 1997).\n\nB. Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n      In his live petition, appellant alleged the following:\n\n      The Defendants DISA, Dallas Mentor, SAFETY TURN-A-ROUND and\n      EXXON knew of Plaintiff’s employment by Defendants [sic] WHM and that\n      if he failed a drug test, he would not be allowed to continue to work. By\n      disseminating and publishing the inaccurate drug test results as set forth\n      above, these Defendants not only damaged Plaintiff’s reputation and\n      character, but cast doubt on Plaintiff’s ability to perform his job. Plaintiff\n      was ultimately terminated from his employment by his employers,\n      Defendants WHM and/or EXXON, as a direct result of these inaccurate\n      test results. Furthermore, because of the negligence of Defendants DISA,\n      Dallas Mentor, SAFETY TURN-A-ROUND and EXXON, it was reported\n      that Plaintiff tested positive for drug use, which was false, and prevented\n      [Plaintiff] from working for Defendant EXXON through Defendant WHM.\n\n      Moreover, Defendants DISA, Dallas Mentor, SAFETY TURN-A-ROUND\n      and EXXON failed to properly investigate and/or perform a comparison\n      analysis of why the second drug test, taken by Plaintiff a mere four (4)\n      days after the initial test, came out negative for any illicit drug use. As a\n      result of their acts and omissions, these Defendants directly influenced\n      Plaintiff’s employers to terminate him, thus causing them to breach their\n      employment contract and/or business relations with Plaintiff.\n\nC. Exxon’s Grounds Summary Judgment\n\n      In its motion for summary judgment, Exxon argued the following:\n\n      First, Plaintiff has no evidence of a contract subject to interference.\n      Plaintiff was an at-will employee of WHM. Despite Plaintiff’s deposition\n      testimony to the contrary, Plaintiff pleads that ExxonMobil is his employer.\n      However, Plaintiff admitted that he has no contract with ExxonMobil with\n      which to interfere. ExxonMobil denies that Plaintiff was its employee.\n      There is no evidence that ExxonMobil interfered in any way with Plaintiff’s\n      employment with WHM. To be sure, ExxonMobil did not have a contract\n      with Plaintiff, DISA or Dallas Mentor. While ExxonMobil did have a\n      contract with WHM, it is black letter law that a party cannot interfere with\n      its own contract. Thus, Plaintiff’s tortious interference with contract claim\n      fails, and summary judgment in favor of ExxonMobil should be granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                             49\n\f      Moreover, Plaintiff admitted that he was not fired by his employer WHM,\n      and he just needed to obtain “active” status with DISA to work for WHM.\n      Plaintiff’s employment relationship with WHM is conditioned upon\n      Plaintiff’s own actions, to become DISA “active.” To date, Plaintiff has not\n      retested or taken any action to obtain “active” DISA status. The onus is on\n      Plaintiff to obtain “active” DISA status to receive work assignments from\n      WHM, not ExxonMobil.\n\n      Likewise, Plaintiff failed to identify any intentional tort allegedly committed\n      by ExxonMobil. In fact, there is no evidence of any allegedly willful or\n      intentional interference with any contract committed by ExxonMobil . . . .\n\n      Finally, Plaintiff has no evidence that any alleged interference by\n      ExxonMobil proximately caused him any damages.\n\nD. Appellant’s Response to Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      In his response, appellant argued the following:\n\n      Exxon claims Plaintiff cannot meet elements (1) [an existing contract] and\n      (2) [an intentional and willful act of interference] because he as [sic] at will\n      employee of WHM and there is no evidence of any intentional or willful act\n      of interference. However, the fact that the contract interfered with is\n      terminable at will is no defense. In addition, according to Exxon’s own\n      affidavit, Exxon informed WHM that Plaintiff could not work at its facilities\n      after it became aware of Plaintiff’s discrimination claim with the EEOC,\n      even though it knew that Plaintiff informed the EEOC and WHM that the\n      drug test was false. This, in effect, amounted to Plaintiff’s termination,\n      since Exxon is the sole and/or major client of WHM, and WHM admits that\n      it had no other work for Plaintiff. Intentional interference does not require\n      intent to injure. Rather, the actor must desire to cause the consequences\n      of his or her act or believe those consequences are substantially certain to\n      result from it.\n\nE. Discussion of Exxon’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      As set forth above, Exxon moved for summary judgment on the basis that there\n\nis “no evidence that any alleged interference by ExxonMobil proximately caused\n\n[appellant] any damages.” We have reviewed appellant’s response and conclude that\n\nappellant did not address this challenged element in his response. See Roark, 813\n\nS.W.2d at 495. Nor has appellant addressed this challenged element on appeal. See\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\fKiger, 376 S.W.3d at 290. Accordingly, we conclude that the summary judgment must\n\nbe affirmed on this ground. See Harris v. Ebby Halliday Real Estate, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541987\"><a href=\"/opinion/2541987/harris-v-ebby-halliday-real-estate-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760 (Tex.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\n       In his tenth issue, appellant contends that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of DISA on appellant’s claims for defamation, negligence,\n\nand tortious interference with a contract based on the statute of limitations.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n       “A defendant moving for summary judgment on the affirmative defense of\n\nlimitations has the burden to conclusively establish that defense.” KPMG Peat Marwick\n\nv. Harrison County Hous. Fin. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2424965\"><a href=\"/opinion/2424965/kpmg-peat-marwick-v-harrison-county-housing-finance-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 748 (Tex. 1999). The Texas\n\nSupreme Court has explained the standard as follows:\n\n       [T]he defendant must (1) conclusively prove when the cause of action\n       accrued, and (2) negate the discovery rule, if it applies and has been\n       pleaded or otherwise raised, by proving as a matter of law that there is no\n       genuine issue of material fact about when the plaintiff discovered, or in the\n       exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the nature of its\n       injury. If the movant establishes that the statute of limitations bars the\n       action, the nonmovant must then adduce summary judgment proof raising\n       a fact issue in avoidance of the statute of limitations.\n\nId.\n\nB. Appellant’s Relevant Pleadings\n\n       In his live petition, appellant did not plead the discovery rule or any other tolling\n\nprovision for the applicable statute of limitations on his claims. In its original answer to\n\n                                               51\n\fappellant’s live petition, DISA alleged that appellant’s claims were barred by the\n\napplicable statute of limitations.\n\nC. DISA’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n       In its motion for summary judgment, DISA argued in relevant part as follows:\n\n       Rincones asserts three causes of action against DISA: (1) negligence; (2)\n       tortious interference with contract; and (3) defamation (libel and slander).\n       It has long been the law in Texas that “a cause of action accrues when a\n       party has been injured by actions or omissions of another.” Taking\n       Rincones’ allegations in [his live petition] as true as the Court must on\n       summary judgment, these three causes of action began to accrue against\n       DISA on April 14, 2008. On that day, Rincones learned to his “surprise\n       and amazement” that he had tested positive for drug use, but believed the\n       result was erroneous because Rincones “has never used illicit and/or\n       illegal drugs[,]” and also learned that WHM and Exxon refused to allow\n       him to return to work until he contacted DISA to resolve this issue.\n\n       The statute of limitations for a negligence cause of action under Texas law\n       is two years. The statute of limitations for a tortious interference with\n       contract claim is also two years. The statute of limitations for defamation\n       (libel and slander) is one year.\n\n       Rincones, however, failed to assert any claims against DISA until he filed\n       his Fourth Amended Petition on August 10, 2010—two years and four\n       months after the statute of limitations on these three claims began to\n       accrue. Said differently, the statute of limitations on Rincones’ defamation\n       claim against DISA expired on April 14, 2009. When Rincones first\n       asserted this claim against DISA on August 10, 2010, the statute of\n       limitations had been expired for nearly one year and four months.\n       Similarly, the statute of limitations on Rincones’ negligence and tortious\n       interference with contract claims against DISA expired on April 14, 2010.\n       When Rincones first asserted these claims against DISA on August 10,\n       2010, the statute of limitations had been expired for almost four months.\n\n       DISA has met its summary judgment burden by conclusively proving\n       Rincones’ three claims against DISA are barred by the applicable statute\n       of limitations. The Court should grant summary judgment for DISA and\n       dismiss DISA from this lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, DISA also argued that appellant’s claims were barred under\n\nthe doctrine of misidentification:\n\n\n\n                                           52\n\f      This is a case of misidentification: Rincones sued the wrong party and the\n      statute of limitations expired before he corrected his error. DISA is not\n      associated with, and has no connection to, any business organization\n      named DICA. Although Rincones knew about WHM’s Deposition of\n      Written Questions to DISA in August 2009 and testified extensively about\n      DISA in his November 2009 deposition, he chose to add DICA as a\n      defendant to this lawsuit in his Third Amended Petition on February 23,\n      2010 and, in fact, served DICA on June 11, 2010. . .\n\n      Moreover, this is not a case where the proper defendant had notice of the\n      suit or would not be disadvantaged by the mistake. It is undisputed that\n      DISA had no notice of Plaintiff’s Third Amended Petition until it was served\n      on August 26, 2010 with Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition. It is also\n      undisputed that DISA has no corporate relationship—or any relationship at\n      all—with DICA. Rincones’ decision to add DISA to this lawsuit three\n      months before trial would not only place DISA at a severe disadvantage,\n      but would also result in unnecessarily delayed justice to all other parties\n      involved in this case.\n\n      Plaintiff sued the wrong party on February 23, 2010. His claims against\n      DISA . . . are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, DISA also argued as follows:\n\n      Even if the Court finds Rincones merely misnamed “DISA” as “DICA” in\n      his Third Amended Petition, . . . his claims against DISA are still barred as\n      a matter of law.\n\n      First, Rincones’ defamation claims against DISA remain barred by the\n      applicable one year statute of limitations. Even assuming Rincones first\n      put DISA on notice of this lawsuit when he filed his Third Amended\n      Petition on February 23, 2010, which DISA denies, the statute of\n      limitations on Rincones’ defamation claims expired on April 14, 2009,\n      more than 10 months before asserting the claims.\n\n      Moreover, Rincones’ negligence and tortious interference with contract\n      claims are barred as a matter of law because Rincones failed to exercise\n      diligence in serving DICA and DISA. The filing of a lawsuit will not toll the\n      running of limitations unless due diligence is exercised in the issuance and\n      service of citation. . .\n\n      Rincones first asserted negligence and tortious interference [with] contract\n      claims against DICA on February 23, 2010, a little less than two months\n      before the statute of limitations on these claims expired. Rincones,\n      however, did not serve DICA with notice of these claims until June 11,\n      2010, nearly four months after first naming DICA as a defendant, and two\n\n                                           53\n\f     months after the statute of limitation expired. Likewise, Rincones did not\n     serve DISA with notice of these claims until August 26, 2010, more than\n     six months after Rincones first brought DICA into this lawsuit, and more\n     than four months after the statute of limitations expired.\n\n     Rincones cannot justify his failure to timely serve DISA. He has known of\n     DISA’s role in his April 11, 2008 positive drug test since April 14, 2008.\n     He certainly received a copy of WHM’s Deposition on Written Questions in\n     August 2009, and, more critically, testified extensively about DISA during\n     his November 2009 deposition. As a matter of law, Rincones failed to\n     exercise the diligence in service necessary to toll the statute of limitations\n     on his negligence and tortious interference with contract claims.\n\nD. Appellant’s Response to DISA’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n     In his response, appellant argued in relevant part as follows:\n\n     There . . . is no fact question that Plaintiff has not been allowed to\n     continue working because he alleged[ly] failed a drug test performed by\n     DISA and its specimen collector agent, Turnaround, and that WHM listed\n     him as “Fired” with the TWC on September 11, 2008 for allegedly failing a\n     drug test.     As such, Plaintiff[’]s tortious interference of the at-will\n     employment contract action did not accrue until September 11, 2008, the\n     date of his termination, and the suit against DISA is timely because it was\n     sued and served with process prior to August 2010, within 2 years of the\n     date of his termination.\n\n     Further, it is undisputed that DISA had a duty to counsel Plaintiff after he\n     allegedly tested positive for drugs so that he can regain “active” status.\n     Plaintiff was an employee in “inactive” status until he was officially\n     terminated by WHM on September 11, 2008. Every day that Defendant\n     DISA failed to meet its duty while Plaintiff was an employee meant that he\n     was “inactive” and could not work and earn a living, thereby causing him\n     injury on a daily basis until his September 11, 2008 termination, when that\n     obligation (and Plaintiff’s employment) ceased.\n\n     A cause of action accrues on the date a defendant’s wrongful act causes a\n     legal injury. In addition, because Defendant DISA’s duty continued until\n     his termination, and the continued violations of that duty prevented Plaintiff\n     from becoming “active” and not able to work, the cause of action accrues\n     when the tortious conduct ceases, which would have been when Plaintiff\n     was officially terminated, e.g. September 11, 2008. As such, the\n     continuing tort doctrine applies, the limitations period began on the date\n     the cause of action accrued, which was Plaintiff’s termination date of\n     September 11, 2008, and Plaintiff’s suing and serving DISA in August\n     2010 is timely.\n\n                                          54\n\f       ...\n\n       Even if the accrual date is April 2008, as DISA argues and Plaintiff denies,\n       the limitations should be tolled under the facts of the case, Plaintiff’s due\n       diligence creates a fact issue regarding limitations, and/or DISA and its\n       agents cannot complain when they were clearly aware of suit and their\n       actions prevented timely service.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, appellant also argued the following:\n\n       Plaintiff attempted to bring in the DISA defendant for the first time in\n       February 2010 with the filing of Plaintiff’s Third Amended Petition, well\n       within the statute of limitations period as argued by Defendant DISA. . .\n\n       The pleadings stated “DICA” although the correct entity which Plaintiff’s\n       counsel [later learned] was the proper DISA defendant was listed as\n       “DISA” with the Texas Secretary of State. Plaintiff believed it had the right\n       party and did not take further steps to identify the proper party and/or\n       obtain service based on the representations of Robynn Brown, the owner\n       of Turnaround, Inc. and agent for DISA, that Plaintiff had sued the correct\n       entities and that no further service was necessary. Therefore, simple\n       spelling error was made at the time of filing suit, or attempt to file suit,\n       against DISA in February 2010, and the proper party to the suit was aware\n       of and recognized the suit, and falsely represented that further service\n       was not necessary and that an answer would be filed.\n\n       The statute of limitations is tolled in cases of misnomer where the correct\n       party has been served or is put on notice that he, she, or it is the intended\n       defendant. Under these circumstances, the naming of DISA is a\n       misnomer and the correction in August 2010 relates back to the February\n       2010 filing, since the agent of the correct party, Robynn Brown, was aware\n       of the suit and allegations. Further, Defendant DISA also alleges that\n       even if Plaintiff’s Third Amended Petition filed in February 2010 is a\n       misnomer situation, Plaintiff failed to use due diligence to serve process\n       on either the misnamed defendant or the correct defendant until August\n       2010, which DISA argues is beyond the limitations period. Plaintiff offers\n       the affidavit of his counsel . . . to explain the delay.\n\n       Specifically, based on Ms. Brown’s representations that the correct party\n       had been identified, that no service was necessary, and that an answer for\n       both DISA and Turnaround would be made upon her receipt of the\n       petition, Plaintiff’s counsel did not take any further action to either identify\n       the proper party and/or serve the party it had sued in February until it\n       realized in August 2010 that the correct party has not been included in the\n       petition. In addition to Ms. Brown’s representations, Plaintiff was also\n\n                                             55\n\f       unable to make that determination earlier because the DISA defendant it\n       did sue failed to file any answer after proper service, and the Defendants\n       that had already answered (Exxon and WHM) failed to identify DISA and\n       Turnaround as potential parties pursuant to their obligation of TRCP Rule\n       194.2(b). As such, due diligence in identifying and serving Defendant\n       DISA was clearly used in this case, and at the very least the issue of due\n       diligence as a prerequisite to the tolling of limitations is a fact issue.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, appellant also argued the following:\n\n       In addition, the Texas Supreme Court has recognized that “where a\n       plaintiff has made a mistake in the parties as to the defendant that should\n       have been sued,” like Plaintiff has done in this case, he should be given\n       an opportunity to show that the defendant was aware of the suit, was not\n       misled, or placed at a disadvantage in obtaining evidence to defend the\n       suit before summary judgment is granted. Since this summary judgment\n       was filed mere days after filing an answer, Plaintiff is only seeking the\n       relief that the Texas Supreme Court has said he should be entitled [to]\n       under the circumstances. Again, as the affidavit of Plaintiff’s counsel\n       shows, Defendant DISA’s agent, Robynn Brown, was aware of this suit\n       and claims against DISA and Turnaround in March 2010, within the\n       limitations time period as calculated by Defendants. That was 8 months\n       before the previous November 2010 trial setting in this case and 5 months\n       before the discovery cut-off date as per the Agree Scheduling Order.\n       Further, since the Court has continued the case, Defendant DISA cannot\n       argue that it will be prejudiced or disadvantaged in this case by allowing\n       Plaintiff’s claims to proceed. Lastly, there is no question that there is a\n       relationship between Defendant Brown and Defendant DISA, as Brown\n       and her company, Turnaround, was the authorized agent for DISA where\n       Plaintiff was directed to provide his specimen.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, appellant also argued the following:\n\n       In the unlikely event the Court agrees that limitations accrued in April 2008\n       as argued by DISA, they should not be allowed to assert the defense\n       under the equitable estoppel[] doctrine because DISA and/or its agents\n       caused the delay of which they now complain. There is no question that\n       Plaintiff sued the wrong DISA Defendant on February 23, 2010, which is\n       within the 2 year status [sic] of limitations. However, the reason the\n       proper DISA Defendant was not identified and sued earlier is because its\n       agent Turnaround made false representations to Plaintiff’s counsel which\n       were relied upon to Plaintiff’s detriment.\n\n       Specifically, on or about March 25, 2010, Plaintiff’s counsel was contacted\n       by Robynn Brown via telephone who represented that she was the owner\n       of “the drug testing company”, and requested a copy of the lawsuit to\n\n                                            56\n\f      provide to her attorney. Because of the difficulty in identifying the proper\n      parties and obtaining service, Plaintiff[’]s counsel asked Ms. Brown\n      several times which entity she represented, but she failed and/or refused\n      to clarify. However, Ms. Brown did represent that service was not\n      necessary and that her attorney would be filing an answer on behalf of\n      both DISA and Turnaround once she received the lawsuit, since it was her\n      company that performed the drug testing made the basis of this lawsuit.\n      The following day, Ms. Brown emailed Plaintiff’s counsel again requesting\n      a copy of the lawsuit, to which Plaintiff forwarded to Ms. Brown via email\n      on March 29, 2010. Unfortunately, Ms. Brown never responded again and\n      has yet to be served.\n\n      ...\n\n      The evidence developed to date is clear that Turnaround is the authorized\n      agent for specimen collection for Defendant DISA, the agent that took\n      Plaintiff’s sample for DISA which is the basis of this claim, and that Ms.\n      Brown was at one time the owner of the company. Further, it is clear that\n      Defendants EXXON and WHM, the entities that contracted with, approved,\n      and/or hired DISA and/or Turnaround, failed to properly identify these\n      parties, which left Plaintiff’s counsel guessing on which party to sue.\n      Plaintiff’s counsel used due diligence in trying to find the correct defendant\n      by searching the Texas Secretary of State website and discussing with\n      counsel for Defendants EXXON and WHM on who the proper party was,\n      but to no avail.       Further, Plaintiff and his counsel relied on the\n      representations of the reputed owner of Turnaround, Inc. and/or the agent\n      of Defendant DISA when she said that the proper parties had been found,\n      service was not necessary, and that she would instruct her attorney to file\n      an answer for both defendants. The elements for equitable estoppel[] are\n      met, and DISA should be stopped from asserting a limitations defense.\n\nE. Discussion of DISA’s Grounds for Summary Judgment\n\n      First, with respect to appellant’s defamation claim, DISA established that the\n\ncause of action accrued on April 14, 2008, when the allegedly defamatory statement\n\nwas published. See Pitts & Collard, L.L.P. v. Schechter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (“A defamation cause of action ordinarily\n\naccrues on the date the defamatory matter is published or circulated.”). DISA also\n\nestablished that appellant’s defamation claim has a one-year statute of limitations that\n\nexpired on April 14, 2009. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 16.002(a) (West\n\n                                           57\n\f2002). As set forth above, appellant asserted the continuing-tort doctrine and argued\n\nthat his causes of action accrued in September 2008 (when his employment was\n\nallegedly terminated). Even if that were true with respect to appellant’s defamation\n\nclaim, the claim would still be barred because the one-year limitations period would\n\nhave expired in September 2009, well before appellant filed his third amended petition\n\nin February 2010 and his fourth amended petition in August 2010. As set forth above,\n\nappellant also argued that equitable estoppel barred DISA’s statute of limitations\n\ndefense; however, this argument was not made with respect to appellant’s defamation\n\nclaim. Accordingly, we conclude that DISA established its entitlement to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law on appellant’s defamation claim based on its affirmative defense of\n\nlimitations.\n\n       Second, with respect to appellant’s negligence and tortious interference with\n\ncontract claims, appellant asserted that under the continuing-tort doctrine, his causes of\n\naction did not accrue until September 2008. See Markwardt v. Tex. Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276559\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276559/markwardt-v-texas-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 893 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (“[A] continuing tort is\n\nan ongoing wrong causing a continuing injury [that] does not accrue until the tortious act\n\nceases.”). If so, then the two-year limitations period on those claims did not expire until\n\nSeptember 2010 and his claims filed in August 2010 would not be time-barred. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 16.003(a) (West Supp. 2011).\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court has neither “endorsed nor addressed” the continuing-\n\ntort doctrine.   Creditwatch, Inc. v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894643\"><a href=\"/opinion/894643/creditwatch-inc-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 816 n.8 (Tex. 2005).\n\nTherefore, it is unclear whether the doctrine is viable, as appellant contends. In its\n\nmotion for summary judgment, DISA did not address or attempt to negate the\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\fcontinuing-tort doctrine as a basis for suspending the statute of limitations. See State\n\nFarm Lloyds, 315 S.W.3d at 532 (“Summary judgment may not be affirmed on appeal\n\non a ground not presented to the trial court in the motion.”). Thus, DISA failed to meet\n\nits burden to conclusively establish the limitations bar. See Ray v. O’Neal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462680\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462680/ray-v-oneal/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, writ denied) (“When summary judgment is\n\nsought on the ground that limitations has expired, it is the movant’s burden to\n\nconclusively establish the limitations bar, including the negation of a tolling or\n\nsuspension statute raised by the nonmovant.”).\n\n       Furthermore, as set forth above, appellant argued that even if the causes of\n\naction accrued on April 14, 2008, DISA was prohibited from asserting limitations as an\n\naffirmative defense based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel. See Rendon v. Roman\n\nCatholic Diocese of Amarillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1881662\"><a href=\"/opinion/1881662/rendon-v-roman-catholic-diocese/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, pet.\n\ndenied) (“[E]stoppel may be invoked to defeat a claim of limitations.”); see also Johnson\n\n& Higgins of Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774526\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774526/johnson-higgins-of-tx-inc-v-kenneco-energy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515–16 (Tex. 1998)\n\n(“[T]he doctrine of equitable estoppel requires: (1) a false representation or concealment\n\nof material facts; (2) made with knowledge, actual or constructive, of those facts; (3)\n\nwith the intention that it should be acted on; (4) to a party without knowledge or means\n\nof   obtaining   knowledge   of   the   facts;    (5)   who   detrimentally relies   on   the\n\nrepresentations.”). DISA did not address or attempt to negate equitable estoppel in its\n\nmotion for summary judgment. See State Farm Lloyds, 315 S.W.3d at 532. Thus,\n\nDISA failed to meet its burden to conclusively establish the limitations bar. See Ray,\n\n922 S.W.2d at 317.\n\n\n\n\n                                             59\n\f       Finally, as set forth above, DISA attempted to negate tolling based on misnomer\n\nby establishing that this was a case of misidentification. “Texas courts have recognized\n\na distinction between misnomer and misidentification.” Enserch Corp. v. Parker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2437952\"><a href=\"/opinion/2437952/enserch-corp-v-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (Tex. 1990).        “If the plaintiff merely misnames the correct defendant\n\n(misnomer), limitations is tolled and a subsequent amendment of the petition relates\n\nback to the date of the original petition.” Id. at 4–5. “If, however, the plaintiff is mistaken\n\nas to which of two defendants is the correct one and there is actually existing a\n\ncorporation with the name of the erroneously named defendant (misidentification), then\n\nthe plaintiff has sued the wrong party and limitations is not tolled.” Id. at 5. In his\n\nresponse, appellant argued that this is a case of misnomer and thus limitations was\n\ntolled. We have already concluded that DISA failed to meet its summary judgment\n\nburden to negate appellant’s assertion of the continuing-tort doctrine and equitable\n\nestoppel. Therefore, it is unnecessary to decide whether DISA negated appellant’s\n\nassertion of misnomer. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n       Accordingly, appellant’s tenth issue is sustained with respect to his causes of\n\naction for negligence and tortious interference with contract and overruled with respect\n\nto his cause of action for defamation.\n\n                      XI. BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST DISA\n\n       In his eleventh issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of DISA on his breach of contract claim. DISA did not move\n\nfor summary judgment on appellant’s breach of contract claim. The trial court’s order\n\ndid not purport to grant summary judgment on appellant’s breach of contract claim. The\n\nclaim was asserted by appellant for the first time in his fifth amended petition, which was\n\n\n\n                                              60\n\fstruck by the trial court. Appellant’s live petition, his fourth amended petition, did not\n\nallege a breach of contract claim. See Randle v. NCNB Tex.
