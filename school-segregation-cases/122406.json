James Owens, an Illinois prisoner,\nwas housed at the Menard Correctional Center when\n\n\n\n\n  After examining the briefs and the record, we have\nconcluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal\nis submitted on the briefs and the record. See F ED . R. A PP .\nP. 34(a)(2)(C).\n\f2                                                  No. 09-3618\n\nhe filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The place of\nconfinement is all that connects his hodgepodge of allega-\ntions, which the district court organized into seven\nclaims (some with subparts) against the 15 named defen-\ndants. The court dismissed five of those claims at screen-\ning, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, and granted summary judg-\nment for the defendants on the other two. Finding no\nmerit in any of Owens’s arguments on appeal, we affirm.\n  The number of claims and defendants reflected\nOwens’s failure to observe the requirements of Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 20(a)(2) with respect to joinder\nof parties. We emphasized in George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605,\n607 (7th Cir. 2007), that unrelated claims against different\ndefendants belong in separate lawsuits, not only “to\nprevent the sort of morass” produced by multi-claim,\nmulti-defendant suits like this one, but also to ensure\nthat prisoners pay all fees required under the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b), (g). Com-\nplaints like this one from Owens should be rejected,\nGeorge, 507 F.3d at 607, either by severing the action into\nseparate lawsuits or by dismissing improperly joined\ndefendants, see FED. R. C IV. P. 21; DirectTV, Inc. v. Leto, 467\nF.3d 842, 844-45 (3d Cir. 2006); Elmore v. Henderson, 227\nF.3d 1009, 1012 (7th Cir. 2000); Michaels Bldg. Co. v.\nAmeritrust Co., N.A., 848 F.2d 674, 682 (6th Cir. 1988). This\nis not, however, a jurisdictional flaw, and so we pro-\nceed to analyze Owens’s allegations.\n  The evidence before the district court at summary\njudgment can be summarized as follows. Owens began\na hunger strike in April 2004 to protest what he viewed\n\fNo. 09-3618                                              3\n\nas indifference to his grievances about conditions at\nMenard. He publicized his strike by communicating\nwith state officials and prison employees. After 21 days\nOwens went to the infirmary, where he remained for\nfour days. He then voluntarily ended his hunger strike\nafter being assured that his grievances would be ad-\ndressed. Owens, who is 5’ 4” and averages 195 pounds,\nlost about 20 pounds during the hunger strike but\nregained all of that weight. There is no evidence that\nhe suffered medical complications.\n  Believing that his grievances were still being ignored,\nOwens began a second hunger strike in June 2004. After\n25 days prison officials moved him from his cell to the\ninfirmary, where for almost three more weeks he\nrefused to eat. At that point administrators obtained an\norder from a state court allowing them to force-feed\nOwens, who ended the hunger strike on August 5 after\nthe first use of a feeding tube. This time he had lost over\n30 pounds, but again there is no evidence of medical\ncomplications. On August 8 he submitted a grievance to\nhis counselor complaining that during the two hunger\nstrikes he was left in his cell without medical moni-\ntoring for a total of 49 days. Owens maintained that he\nshould have been housed in the infirmary all that time.\nHis counselor did not respond.\n  In January 2005, Owens was placed in disciplinary\nsegregation and assigned to a cell with inmate Gordon.\nFor a month the two got along, but then without warning\nor explanation Gordon hit Owens in the mouth, splitting\nhis lip. Gordon also threatened to hit him again. Owens\n\f4                                              No. 09-3618\n\nreported the punch to the guards on duty—defendants\nAnderson and Niepert—but at summary judgment\nhe never said whether he also disclosed Gordon’s threat.\nThe two guards remained silent when Owens asked to\nbe released from his cell. Later that afternoon, when a\ndifferent guard was in view, Gordon swung again. Owens\nevaded the punches, and the guard quickly intervened.\nOwens was taken to the infirmary and given a salt-\nwater rinse to treat the small lacerations left in his\nmouth by Gordon’s earlier punch. (Owens says in his\ncomplaint and appellate brief that he was left with a\nscar on his lip, but he submitted no admissible evidence\nto substantiate this allegation.)\n  Owens next was housed with inmate Autin. For a\nmonth they coexisted peacefully, but Autin ran out of\ndrugs to control his mental illness and cautioned Owens\nto move elsewhere because he might lose control. Owens\ntold no one about this warning. On Autin’s fourth day\nwithout medication, he swung at Owens but landed\nno punches. Owens told a guard—defendant Smith—\nabout the incident, and Autin chimed in that he would\ngo after Owens again. Owens asked to be moved, but\nSmith said he could not do anything that day. Hours\nlater Owens was conversing with another guard about\nmoving when Autin rushed from behind and shoved\nhim into the bars. The guard took Owens to the infirmary\nwith a bump on his forehead and a small abrasion on\none elbow.\n  These events underlie four of the claims in Owens’s\ncomplaint. In one of these claims he contends that unspeci-\n\fNo. 09-3618                                                5\n\nfied officials violated the Constitution by ignoring his\nmany and varied grievances; in another he insists that\nhis “right to peaceful demonstration” was infringed\nwhen his second hunger strike was forcibly ended. At\nscreening the district court dismissed both of these\nclaims as frivolous, and we concur with this assess-\nment. Prison grievance procedures are not mandated by\nthe First Amendment and do not by their very existence\ncreate interests protected by the Due Process Clause, and\nso the alleged mishandling of Owens’s grievances by\npersons who otherwise did not cause or participate in\nthe underlying conduct states no claim. See George,\n507 F.3d at 609; Grieveson v. Anderson, 538 F.3d 763, 772 &\nn.3 (7th Cir. 2008); Antonelli v. Sheahan, 81 F.3d 1422, 1430\n(7th Cir. 1996). And as we said in Freeman v. Berge, 441 F.3d\n543, 546-47 (7th Cir. 2006), an inmate conducting a\nhunger strike does not have a constitutionally protected\nright to refuse life-saving medical treatment.\n  Two other claims proceeded to summary judgment.\nOwens contended that he should have been moved to the\ninfirmary for the duration of both hunger strikes and,\nbecause he was not, that several named defendants had\nbeen deliberately indifferent to the state of his health.\nHe also asserted that guards Anderson, Niepert, and\nSmith violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to\nprotect him from the second assaults by Gordon and\nAutin. The district court concluded that Owens had\nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies for the\nhealthcare claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Dole v. Chandler,\n438 F.3d 804, 809 (7th Cir. 2006). The court rejected\nOwens’s failure-to-protect claims for lack of an eviden-\n\f6                                              No. 09-3618\n\ntiary showing that could have supported a verdict in his\nfavor.\n  The latter ruling is correct. On the evidence presented\nat summary judgment, a jury could not reasonably find\nthat the guards, by declining to move Owens immedi-\nately to another cell, deliberately ignored a substantial\nrisk that he would suffer serious harm at the hands of\nhis cellmates. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 F.3d 825, 834\n(1994); Klebanowski v. Sheahan, 540 F.3d 633, 637 (7th Cir.\n2008). Gordon’s one surprise punch and Autin’s wild\nswings did not give the defendants reason to believe\nthat Owens faced an imminent and substantial threat to\nhis safety. The litigants did not submit testimony from\nAnderson, Niepert, or Smith, and so the record does not\nreveal whether they reported the initial scraps to their\nsuperiors or took other reasonable steps to prevent a\nrepetition. It does not matter. Even if the three\ndefendants shrugged off the minor fisticuffs, the\nevidence at summary judgment shows only that they\nmisjudged the rifts between Owens and the cellmates\nhe had bunked with amicably for a month. Owens\noffered no evidence that he told Anderson or Niepert\nabout Gordon’s threat to strike again, and Smith had\nno reason to suspect that Autin, who had not managed\nto land a punch, was a serious threat to Owens. Nothing\nindicates that the risk either time to Owens was more\nthan minimal, see Dale v. Poston, 548 F.3d 563, 569 (7th\nCir. 2008), and when another scuffle signaled that\ntension remained, prison staff quickly stepped in and\nseparated the inmates. Summary judgment for the\nguards was appropriate.\n\fNo. 09-3618                                                7\n\n   The district court’s ruling on the medical-care claim\nrequires a closer look. At summary judgment Owens\ntendered a copy of his grievance, dated August 8, 2004,\nalleging that he was left in his cell without medical atten-\ntion during substantial portions of his hunger strikes.\nAccording to Owens, he gave this grievance to his coun-\nselor but never received a reply, and so he forwarded\ncopies to the grievance officer in February 2005 and\nto the Administrative Review Board in June 2005.\nThe district court acknowledged the significance of this\ngrievance but concluded that, since Owens had not dis-\ncussed it in an affidavit or deposition, he lacked admis-\nsible evidence that he gave the grievance to prison offi-\ncials. In this respect, the court erred. Owens verified\nhis response in opposition to the defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment, and that was enough to make his\nallegations admissible. See 28 U.S.C. § 1746. As the\ndistrict court noted, Owens’s submission was not\nliterally an “affidavit” because he did not swear to the\ncontent in the presence of someone authorized to ad-\nminister oaths. See Elder-Keep v. Aksamit, 460 F.3d 979, 984\n(8th Cir. 2006); Pfeil v. Rogers, 757 F.2d 850, 859 (7th Cir.\n1985); B LACK ’ S L AW D ICTIONARY 66 (9th ed. 2009). Never-\ntheless, a declaration under § 1746 is equivalent to an\naffidavit for purposes of summary judgment. See, e.g.,\nPretka v. Kolter City Plaza II, Inc., 608 F.3d 744, 749 n.5\n(11th Cir. 2010); El Bey v. Roop, 530 F.3d 407, 414 (6th Cir.\n2008); Dale v. Lappin, 376 F.3d 652, 655 (7th Cir. 2004);\nFord v. Wilson, 90 F.3d 245, 246 (7th Cir. 1996).\n  Yet even taking Owens at his word, we conclude that\nhe failed to exhaust. When an informal resolution is not\n\f8                                              No. 09-3618\n\nachieved by talking to a counselor, an inmate in Illinois\nhas 60 days from the date of the underlying incident to\nsubmit a written grievance to the facility’s designated\ngrievance officer. 20 ILL. A DMIN. C ODE § 504.810; Dole,\n438 F.3d at 809; Dixon v. Page, 291 F.3d 485, 489 (7th Cir.\n2002). Owens ended his second hunger strike three days\nbefore he drafted the August 8 grievance, and so he\nhad until early October 2004 to give it to the grievance\nofficer. By his own admission, Owens inexplicably\nwaited until February 2005. By then it was too late.\n  In the alternative the defendants argue that a lack of\nevidence provided an independent basis for dismissing\nthis claim. We agree with this point as well. Owens’s\ncomplete deposition was tendered at summary judg-\nment, and his testimony confirms that he lost weight\nand became weak while on his hunger strikes but\nsuffered no medical complications. Prison administrators\nhave a right and a duty to step in and force an inmate\nto take nourishment if a hunger strike has progressed to\nthe point where continuation risks serious injury or\ndeath. Freeman, 441 F.3d at 546-47. But if weight loss\nand temporary discomfort are the only consequences of\nrefusing to eat, then the inmate’s choice to go on a\nhunger strike raises no Eighth Amendment concern.\nSee id. at 547; Rodriguez v. Briley, 403 F.3d 952, 953 (7th\nCir. 2005). From all that we can see, Owens’s claim is\nbaseless. Either this ground, on our de novo review, or\nhis failure to exhaust leads to the same conclusion: dis-\nmissal was required.\n  That leaves the other three claims dismissed at\nscreening, in which Owens principally alleges that he\n\fNo. 09-3618                                                9\n\nsuffered retaliation for filing grievances and was denied\nmedical and dental care. At screening the district court\nsignaled that it would have allowed these claims to\nproceed except that Owens had not linked his allega-\ntions of unconstitutional conduct to identifiable de-\nfendants (or, in a few instances, had named only defen-\ndants who could not personally have been involved in\nthe alleged violations). See Collins v. Kibort, 143 F.3d 331,\n334 (7th Cir. 1998) (“A plaintiff cannot state a claim\nagainst a defendant by including the defendant’s name\nin the caption.”). These claims were dismissed without\nprejudice. Owens does not argue that the court’s basis\nfor dismissal was erroneous, but instead contends that\nhis proposed amended complaint, which does identify\nspecific defendants, should have been allowed.\n  Owens filed his amended complaint in March 2007,\neight months after he filed suit and three months after\nthe district court had screened the original complaint.\nThe 246-paragraph document adds 21 pages and 29\ndefendants to the original complaint, and many of its\nallegations date back several years, some as far as 2001. A\nmagistrate judge struck the new complaint. See F ED. R. C IV.\nP. 72(a); S.D. ILL. L. R. 72.1(a)(1). The court was uncertain\nwhether the document had arrived in the clerk’s\noffice before a joint answer filed by several defendants,\nsee F ED. R. C IV. P. 15(a), but since Owens had not\ncomplied with local procedure for amending a com-\nplaint, the court struck the proposed pleading, see S.D.\nILL . L. R. 15.1. The court’s order offered corrective in-\nstructions in the event that Owens wanted to try again,\nbut when he did the following month he apparently\n\f10                                              No. 09-3618\n\nresubmitted the same complaint. This time the magistrate\njudge denied leave to amend because Owens had\nrealleged the two claims that were dismissed with preju-\ndice at screening.\n  We review a denial of leave to amend only for abuse of\ndiscretion, Foster v. DeLuca, 545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir.\n2008); Soltys v. Costello, 520 F.3d 737, 743 (7th Cir. 2008),\nand we find none here. Even if Owens made progress\nin curing the deficiencies in the three claims that were\ndismissed without prejudice at screening, he also tried\nto evade the § 1915A ruling by pressing forward with\nthe claims that were dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim. And this action could not have been inadvertent;\nOwens expanded the two claims to four times their\noriginal length. The magistrate judge was not obligated\nto reward intransigence; these claims are frivolous and\nagain would have faced immediate dismissal. We have\nheld that leave to amend may be denied if the new com-\nplaint does not cure deficiencies in the old one and is\ndoomed to the same fate. E.g., Hukic v. Aurora Loan Servs.,\n588 F.3d 420, 432 (7th Cir. 2009); Duda v. Bd. of Educ. of\nFranklin Park Pub. Sch. Dist., 133 F.3d 1054, 1057 n.4 (7th\nCir. 1998).\n  We have considered the remaining issues in Owens’s\nbrief and conclude that none has merit. For these\nreasons the judgment is A FFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                           3-18-11\n\f",

Complaints like this one from Owens should be rejected, <i>George,</i> 507 F.3d at 607, either by severing the action into separate lawsuits or by dismissing improperly joined defendants, see FED.R.CIV.P. 21; <i>DirecTV, Inc. v. Leto,</i> 467 F.3d 842, 844-45 (3d Cir.2006); <i>Elmore v. Henderson,</i> 227 F.3d 1009, 1012 (7th Cir.2000); <i>Michaels Bldg. Co. v. Ameritrust Co., N.A.,</i> 848 F.2d 674, 682 (6th Cir.1988). This is not, however, a jurisdictional flaw, and so we proceed to analyze Owens's allegations.</p>\n<p>The evidence before the district court at summary judgment can be summarized as follows. Owens began a hunger strike in April 2004 to protest what he viewed as indifference to his grievances about conditions at Menard. He publicized his strike by communicating with state officials and prison employees. After 21 days Owens <span class=\"star-pagination\">*953</span> went to the infirmary, where he remained for four days. He then voluntarily ended his hunger strike after being assured that his grievances would be addressed. Owens, who is 5' 4\" and averages 195 pounds, lost about 20 pounds during the hunger strike but regained all of that weight. There is no evidence that he suffered medical complications.</p>\n<p>Believing that his grievances were still being ignored, Owens began a second hunger strike in June 2004. After 25 days prison officials moved him from his cell to the infirmary, where for almost three more weeks he refused to eat. At that point administrators obtained an order from a state court allowing them to force-feed Owens, who ended the hunger strike on August 5 after the first use of a feeding tube. This time he had lost over 30 pounds, but again there is no evidence of medical complications. On August 8 he submitted a grievance to his counselor complaining that during the two hunger strikes he was left in his cell without medical monitoring for a total of 49 days. Owens maintained that he should have been housed in the infirmary all that time. His counselor did not respond.</p>\n<p>In January 2005, Owens was placed in disciplinary segregation and assigned to a cell with inmate Gordon. For a month the two got along, but then without warning or explanation Gordon hit Owens in the mouth, splitting his lip. Gordon also threatened to hit him again. Owens reported the punch to the guards on duty defendants Anderson and Niepertbut at summary judgment he never said whether he also disclosed Gordon's threat. The two guards remained silent when Owens asked to be released from his cell. Later that afternoon, when a different guard was in view, Gordon swung again. Owens evaded the punches, and the guard quickly intervened. Owens was taken to the infirmary and given a saltwater rinse to treat the small lacerations left in his mouth by Gordon's earlier punch. (Owens says in his complaint and appellate brief that he was left with a scar on his lip, but he submitted no admissible evidence to substantiate this allegation.)</p>\n<p>Owens next was housed with inmate Autin. For a month they coexisted peacefully, but Autin ran out of drugs to control his mental illness and cautioned Owens to move elsewhere because he might lose control. Owens told no one about this warning. On Autin's fourth day without medication, he swung at Owens but landed no punches. Owens told a guarddefendant Smithabout the incident, and Autin chimed in that he would go after Owens again. Owens asked to be moved, but Smith said he could not do anything that day. Hours later Owens was conversing with another guard about moving when Autin rushed from behind and shoved him into the bars. The guard took Owens to the infirmary with a bump on his forehead and a small abrasion on one elbow.</p>\n<p>These events underlie four of the claims in Owens's complaint. In one of these claims he contends that unspecified officials violated the Constitution by ignoring his many and varied grievances; in another he insists that his \"right to peaceful demonstration\" was infringed when his second hunger strike was forcibly ended. At screening the district court dismissed both of these claims as frivolous, and we concur with this assessment. Prison grievance procedures are not mandated by the First Amendment and do not by their very existence create interests protected by the Due Process Clause, and so the alleged mishandling of Owens's grievances by persons who otherwise did not cause or participate in the underlying conduct states no claim. See <i>George,</i> 507 F.3d at 609; <i>Grieveson v. Anderson,</i> 538 F.3d 763, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*954</span> 772 &amp; n. 3 (7th Cir.2008); <i>Antonelli v. Sheahan,</i> 81 F.3d 1422, 1430 (7th Cir. 1996). And as we said in <i>Freeman v. Berge,</i> 441 F.3d 543, 546-47 (7th Cir.2006), an inmate conducting a hunger strike does not have a constitutionally protected right to refuse life-saving medical treatment.</p>\n<p>Two other claims proceeded to summary judgment. Owens contended that he should have been moved to the infirmary for the duration of both hunger strikes and, because he was not, that several named defendants had been deliberately indifferent to the state of his health. He also asserted that guards Anderson, Niepert, and Smith violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect him from the second assaults by Gordon and Autin. The district court concluded that Owens had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies for the healthcare claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); <i>Dole v. Chandler,</i> 438 F.3d 804, 809 (7th Cir.2006). The court rejected Owens's failure-to-protect claims for lack of an evidentiary showing that could have supported a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p>The latter ruling is correct. On the evidence presented at summary judgment, a jury could not reasonably find that the guards, by declining to move Owens immediately to another cell, deliberately ignored a substantial risk that he would suffer serious harm at the hands of his cellmates. See <i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <i>Klebanowski v. Sheahan,</i> 540 F.3d 633, 637 (7th Cir.2008). Gordon's one surprise punch and Autin's wild swings did not give the defendants reason to believe that Owens faced an imminent and substantial threat to his safety. The litigants did not submit testimony from Anderson, Niepert, or Smith, and so the record does not reveal whether they reported the initial scraps to their superiors or took other reasonable steps to prevent a repetition. It does not matter. Even if the three defendants shrugged off the minor fisticuffs, the evidence at summary judgment shows only that they misjudged the rifts between Owens and the cellmates he had bunked with amicably for a month. Owens offered no evidence that he told Anderson or Niepert about Gordon's threat to strike again, and Smith had no reason to suspect that Autin, who had not managed to land a punch, was a serious threat to Owens. Nothing indicates that the risk either time to Owens was more than minimal, see <i>Dale v. Poston,</i> 548 F.3d 563, 569 (7th Cir.2008), and when another scuffle signaled that tension remained, prison staff quickly stepped in and separated the inmates. Summary judgment for the guards was appropriate.</p>\n<p>The district court's ruling on the medical-care claim requires a closer look. At summary judgment Owens tendered a copy of his grievance, dated August 8, 2004, alleging that he was left in his cell without medical attention during substantial portions of his hunger strikes. According to Owens, he gave this grievance to his counselor but never received a reply, and so he forwarded copies to the grievance officer in February 2005 and to the Administrative Review Board in June 2005. The district court acknowledged the significance of this grievance but concluded that, since Owens had not discussed it in an affidavit or deposition, he lacked admissible evidence that he gave the grievance to prison officials. In this respect, the court erred. Owens verified his response in opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and that was enough to make his allegations admissible. See 28 U.S.C. § 1746. As the district court noted, Owens's submission was not literally an \"affidavit\" because he did not swear to the content in the presence of someone authorized to administer oaths. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*955</span> See <i>Elder-Keep v. Aksamit,</i> 460 F.3d 979, 984 (8th Cir.2006); <i>Pfeil v. Rogers,</i> 757 F.2d 850, 859 (7th Cir.1985); BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 66 (9th ed. 2009). Nevertheless, a declaration under § 1746 is equivalent to an affidavit for purposes of summary judgment. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Pretka v. Kolter City Plaza II, Inc.,</i> 608 F.3d 744, 749 n. 5 (11th Cir.2010); <i>El Bey v. Roop,</i> 530 F.3d 407, 414 (6th Cir.2008); <i>Dale v. Lappin,</i> 376 F.3d 652, 655 (7th Cir.2004); <i>Ford v. Wilson,</i> 90 F.3d 245, 246 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p>Yet even taking Owens at his word, we conclude that he failed to exhaust. When an informal resolution is not achieved by talking to a counselor, an inmate in Illinois has 60 days from the date of the underlying incident to submit a written grievance to the facility's designated grievance officer. 20 ILL. ADMIN. CODE § 504.810; <i>Dole,</i> 438 F.3d at 809; <i>Dixon v. Page,</i> 291 F.3d 485, 489 (7th Cir.2002). Owens ended his second hunger strike three days before he drafted the August 8 grievance, and so he had until early October 2004 to give it to the grievance officer. By his own admission, Owens inexplicably waited until February 2005. By then it was too late.</p>\n<p>In the alternative the defendants argue that a lack of evidence provided an independent basis for dismissing this claim. We agree with this point as well. Owens's complete deposition was tendered at summary judgment, and his testimony confirms that he lost weight and became weak while on his hunger strikes but suffered no medical complications. Prison administrators have a right and a duty to step in and force an inmate to take nourishment if a hunger strike has progressed to the point where continuation risks serious injury or death. <i>Freeman,</i> 441 F.3d at 546-47. But if weight loss and temporary discomfort are the only consequences of refusing to eat, then the inmate's choice to go on a hunger strike raises no Eighth Amendment concern. See <i>id.</i> at 547; <i>Rodriguez v. Briley,</i> 403 F.3d 952, 953 (7th Cir.2005). From all that we can see, Owens's claim is baseless. Either this ground, on our <i>de novo</i> review, or his failure to exhaust leads to the same conclusion: dismissal was required.</p>\n<p>That leaves the other three claims dismissed at screening, in which Owens principally alleges that he suffered retaliation for filing grievances and was denied medical and dental care. At screening the district court signaled that it would have allowed these claims to proceed except that Owens had not linked his allegations of unconstitutional conduct to identifiable defendants (or, in a few instances, had named only defendants who could not personally have been involved in the alleged violations). See <i>Collins v. Kibort,</i> 143 F.3d 331, 334 (7th Cir.1998) (\"A plaintiff cannot state a claim against a defendant by including the defendant's name in the caption.\"). These claims were dismissed without prejudice. Owens does not argue that the court's basis for dismissal was erroneous, but instead contends that his proposed amended complaint, which does identify specific defendants, should have been allowed.</p>\n<p>Owens filed his amended complaint in March 2007, eight months after he filed suit and three months after the district court had screened the original complaint. The 246-paragraph document adds 21 pages and 29 defendants to the original complaint, and many of its allegations date back several years, some as far as 2001. A magistrate judge struck the new complaint. See FED.R.CIV.P. 72(a); S.D. ILL. L.R. 72.1(a)(1). The court was uncertain whether the document had arrived in the clerk's office before a joint answer filed by several defendants, see FED.R.CIV.P. 15(a), but since Owens had not complied with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*956</span> local procedure for amending a complaint, the court struck the proposed pleading, see S.D. ILL. L.R. 15.1. The court's order offered corrective instructions in the event that Owens wanted to try again, but when he did the following month he apparently resubmitted the same complaint. This time the magistrate judge denied leave to amend because Owens had realleged the two claims that were dismissed with prejudice at screening.</p>\n<p>We review a denial of leave to amend only for abuse of discretion, <i>Foster v. DeLuca,</i> 545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008); <i>Soltys v. Costello,</i> 520 F.3d 737, 743 (7th Cir.2008), and we find none here. Even if Owens made progress in curing the deficiencies in the three claims that were dismissed without prejudice at screening, he also tried to evade the § 1915A ruling by pressing forward with the claims that were dismissed for failure to state a claim. And this action could not have been inadvertent; Owens expanded the two claims to four times their original length. The magistrate judge was not obligated to reward intransigence; these claims are frivolous and again would have faced immediate dismissal. We have held that leave to amend may be denied if the new complaint does not cure deficiencies in the old one and is doomed to the same fate. <i>E.g., </i><i>Hukic v. Aurora Loan Servs.,</i> 588 F.3d 420, 432 (7th Cir.2009); <i>Duda v. Bd. of Educ. of Franklin Park Pub. Sch. Dist.,</i> 133 F.3d 1054, 1057 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p>We have considered the remaining issues in Owens's brief and conclude that none has merit. For these reasons the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. See FED. R.APP. P. 34(a)(2)(C).</p>\n\n</div>",

The place of confinement is all that connects his hodgepodge of allegations, which the district court organized into seven claims (some with subparts) against the 15 named Defendants. The court dismissed five of those claims at screening, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, and granted summary judgment for the defendants on the other two. Finding no merit in any of Owens's arguments on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p>The number of claims and defendants reflected Owens's failure to observe the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20(a)(2) with respect to joinder of parties. We emphasized in <i>George v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435220\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435220/george-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 607 (7th Cir.2007), that unrelated claims against different defendants belong in separate lawsuits, not only \"to prevent the sort of morass\" produced by multi-claim, multi-defendants suits like this one, but also to ensure that prisoners pay all fees required under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b), (g).

This is not, however, a jurisdictional flaw, and so we proceed to analyze Owens's allegations.</p>\n<p>The evidence before the district court at summary judgment can be summarized as follows. Owens began a hunger strike in April 2004 to protest what he viewed as indifference to his grievances about conditions at Menard. He publicized his strike by communicating with state officials and prison employees. After 21 days Owens <span class=\"star-pagination\">*953</span> went to the infirmary, where he remained for four days. He then voluntarily ended his hunger strike after being assured that his grievances would be addressed. Owens, who is 5' 4\" and averages 195 pounds, lost about 20 pounds during the hunger strike but regained all of that weight. There is no evidence that he suffered medical complications.</p>\n<p>Believing that his grievances were still being ignored, Owens began a second hunger strike in June 2004. After 25 days prison officials moved him from his cell to the infirmary, where for almost three more weeks he refused to eat. At that point administrators obtained an order from a state court allowing them to force-feed Owens, who ended the hunger strike on August 5 after the first use of a feeding tube. This time he had lost over 30 pounds, but again there is no evidence of medical complications. On August 8 he submitted a grievance to his counselor complaining that during the two hunger strikes he was left in his cell without medical monitoring for a total of 49 days. Owens maintained that he should have been housed in the infirmary all that time. His counselor did not respond.</p>\n<p>In January 2005, Owens was placed in disciplinary segregation and assigned to a cell with inmate Gordon. For a month the two got along, but then without warning or explanation Gordon hit Owens in the mouth, splitting his lip. Gordon also threatened to hit him again. Owens reported the punch to the guards on duty defendants Anderson and Niepertbut at summary judgment he never said whether he also disclosed Gordon's threat. The two guards remained silent when Owens asked to be released from his cell. Later that afternoon, when a different guard was in view, Gordon swung again. Owens evaded the punches, and the guard quickly intervened. Owens was taken to the infirmary and given a saltwater rinse to treat the small lacerations left in his mouth by Gordon's earlier punch. (Owens says in his complaint and appellate brief that he was left with a scar on his lip, but he submitted no admissible evidence to substantiate this allegation.)</p>\n<p>Owens next was housed with inmate Autin. For a month they coexisted peacefully, but Autin ran out of drugs to control his mental illness and cautioned Owens to move elsewhere because he might lose control. Owens told no one about this warning. On Autin's fourth day without medication, he swung at Owens but landed no punches. Owens told a guarddefendant Smithabout the incident, and Autin chimed in that he would go after Owens again. Owens asked to be moved, but Smith said he could not do anything that day. Hours later Owens was conversing with another guard about moving when Autin rushed from behind and shoved him into the bars. The guard took Owens to the infirmary with a bump on his forehead and a small abrasion on one elbow.</p>\n<p>These events underlie four of the claims in Owens's complaint. In one of these claims he contends that unspecified officials violated the Constitution by ignoring his many and varied grievances; in another he insists that his \"right to peaceful demonstration\" was infringed when his second hunger strike was forcibly ended. At screening the district court dismissed both of these claims as frivolous, and we concur with this assessment. Prison grievance procedures are not mandated by the First Amendment and do not by their very existence create interests protected by the Due Process Clause, and so the alleged mishandling of Owens's grievances by persons who otherwise did not cause or participate in the underlying conduct states no claim. See <i>George,</i> 507 F.3d at 609; <i>Grieveson v. Anderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1443143\"><a href=\"/opinion/1443143/grieveson-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*954</span> 772 &amp; n. 3 (7th Cir.2008); <i>Antonelli v.

And as we said in <i>Freeman v. Berge,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793696\"><a href=\"/opinion/793696/berrell-freeman-v-gerald-a-berge/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span>, 546-47 (7th Cir.2006), an inmate conducting a hunger strike does not have a constitutionally protected right to refuse life-saving medical treatment.</p>\n<p>Two other claims proceeded to summary judgment. Owens contended that he should have been moved to the infirmary for the duration of both hunger strikes and, because he was not, that several named defendants had been deliberately indifferent to the state of his health. He also asserted that guards Anderson, Niepert, and Smith violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect him from the second assaults by Gordon and Autin. The district court concluded that Owens had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies for the healthcare claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); <i>Dole v. Chandler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793392\"><a href=\"/opinion/793392/joseph-dole-v-correctional-officer-chandler-sergeant-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 809 (7th Cir.2006). The court rejected Owens's failure-to-protect claims for lack of an evidentiary showing that could have supported a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p>The latter ruling is correct. On the evidence presented at summary judgment, a jury could not reasonably find that the guards, by declining to move Owens immediately to another cell, deliberately ignored a substantial risk that he would suffer serious harm at the hands of his cellmates.

The 246-paragraph document adds 21 pages and 29 defendants to the original complaint, and many of its allegations date back several years, some as far as 2001. A magistrate judge struck the new complaint. See FED.R.CIV.P. 72(a); S.D. ILL. L.R. 72.1(a)(1). The court was uncertain whether the document had arrived in the clerk's office before a joint answer filed by several defendants, see FED.R.CIV.P. 15(a), but since Owens had not complied with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*956</span> local procedure for amending a complaint, the court struck the proposed pleading, see S.D. ILL. L.R. 15.1. The court's order offered corrective instructions in the event that Owens wanted to try again, but when he did the following month he apparently resubmitted the same complaint. This time the magistrate judge denied leave to amend because Owens had realleged the two claims that were dismissed with prejudice at screening.</p>\n<p>We review a denial of leave to amend only for abuse of discretion, <i>Foster v. DeLuca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195944\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195944/foster-v-deluca/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 584 (7th Cir. 2008); <i>Soltys v. Costello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201348/soltys-v-costello/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 743 (7th Cir.2008), and we find none here. Even if Owens made progress in curing the deficiencies in the three claims that were dismissed without prejudice at screening, he also tried to evade the § 1915A ruling by pressing forward with the claims that were dismissed for failure to state a claim. And this action could not have been inadvertent; Owens expanded the two claims to four times their original length. The magistrate judge was not obligated to reward intransigence; these claims are frivolous and again would have faced immediate dismissal. We have held that leave to amend may be denied if the new complaint does not cure deficiencies in the old one and is doomed to the same fate. <i>E.g., </i><i>Hukic v. Aurora Loan Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1309442\"><a href=\"/opinion/1309442/hukic-v-aurora-loan-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 432 (7th Cir.2009); <i>Duda v. Bd. of Educ. of Franklin Park Pub. Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750633\"><a href=\"/opinion/750633/john-duda-v-board-of-education-of-franklin-park-public-school-district-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>, 1057 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p>We have considered the remaining issues in Owens's brief and conclude that none has merit. For these reasons the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. See FED. R.APP. P. 34(a)(2)(C).</p>\n\n</div>",
