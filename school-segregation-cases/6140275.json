Page 2\n\n\n                                       _________________\n\n                                            OPINION\n                                       _________________\n\n       BOGGS, Circuit Judge. In 2010, Congress passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance\nAct (FATCA), a law aimed at reducing tax evasion by United States taxpayers holding funds in\nforeign accounts. FATCA imposes account-reporting requirements (and hefty penalties for\nnoncompliance) on both individual taxpayers and foreign financial institutions (FFIs). FFIs are\nfurther required to deduct and withhold a “tax” equal to 30% of every payment made by the FFI\nto a noncompliant (or “recalcitrant”) account holder. To implement FATCA worldwide, the\nUnited States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nhave concluded intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), which facilitate FFIs’ disclosure of\nfinancial-account information to the United States government, with more than seventy\ncountries. Separately from FATCA and the IGAs, the Bank Secrecy Act imposes a foreign bank\naccount reporting (FBAR) requirement on Americans living abroad who have aggregate foreign-\naccount balances over $10,000; willful failure to file an FBAR invites a penalty of 50% of the\nvalue of the reportable accounts or $100,000, whichever is greater.\n\n       Plaintiffs—who include Senator Rand Paul and several individuals who claim to be\nsubject to FATCA and the FBAR—sought to enjoin the enforcement of FATCA, the IGAs, and\nthe FBAR, and they now appeal the dismissal of their lawsuit for lack of standing. For the\nreasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                                 I\n\n                                          A. The Parties\n\n       Plaintiffs’ original verified complaint asserts claims against three defendants: Treasury,\nwhich administers FATCA and the FBAR; the IRS (an office of Treasury that also administers\nFATCA and the FBAR); and the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(FinCEN), a Treasury Department bureau with administrative authority over the FBAR. Each of\nthe seven plaintiffs alleges a unique set of harms:\n\f No. 16-3539                  Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.       Page 3\n\n\n                                             Mark Crawford\n\n       Plaintiff Mark Crawford is an American citizen living in Albania with a residence in\nDayton, Ohio. Crawford owns Aksioner, a brokerage firm in Albania that is a partner of Saxo\nBank in Copenhagen. Crawford alleges injury because Saxo will not allow Aksioner to accept\nclients who are United States citizens “in part because the bank does not wish to assume the\nburdens that would be foisted on it by FATCA.” Crawford also claims that Aksioner—which he\nowns—denied Crawford’s own application for a brokerage account, and that Crawford has\nsuffered financial harm because FATCA is “forcing him to turn away prospective American\nclients living in Albania.”\n\n                                           Senator Rand Paul\n\n       Senator Rand Paul claims that he “has been denied the opportunity to exercise his\nconstitutional right as a member of the U.S. Senate to vote against the FATCA IGAs.” Senator\nPaul claims that he would vote against the IGAs if they were submitted to the Senate for advice\nand consent under Article II, Section 2, of the United States Constitution, or if they were\nsubmitted to the whole Congress for approval as “congressional-executive agreements.” Senator\nPaul does not otherwise challenge FATCA, and he does not in any way challenge the FBAR.\n\n                                             Roger Johnson\n\n       Plaintiff Roger Johnson is an American citizen living in Brno, Czech Republic. Johnson\nis married to Katerina Johnson, a Czech citizen with whom Johnson previously shared joint\nfinancial accounts before they separated their accounts to avoid subjecting Katerina’s account\ninformation to disclosure under FATCA.\n\n                                             Stephen J. Kish\n\n       Plaintiff Stephen J. Kish is a Canadian citizen living in Toronto. Kish was also an\nAmerican citizen at the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed, but he has since renounced his\nAmerican citizenship. Kish and his wife, a Canadian citizen, share a joint bank account at a\nCanadian bank. Kish alleges that “FATCA has at times caused some discord between” Kish and\nhis wife because Kish’s wife “strongly opposes the disclosure of her personal financial\n\f No. 16-3539                Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.            Page 4\n\n\ninformation from [the] joint bank account to the U.S. government.” Kish’s wife, however, is\nneither a plaintiff nor a proposed plaintiff in this litigation.\n\n                                             Daniel Kuettel\n\n        Plaintiff Daniel Kuettel is a Swiss citizen and former American citizen living in\nBremgarten, Switzerland. Kuettel and his wife—a citizen of Switzerland and the Philippines—\nhave a daughter (a citizen of the United States, the Philippines, and Switzerland) and a son (a\ncitizen of the Philippines and Switzerland), both minors. Kuettel alleges that he renounced his\ncitizenship in 2012 “because of difficulties caused by FATCA.” For instance, Kuettel alleges\nthat before renunciation, his efforts to refinance his mortgage with Swiss banks were\nunsuccessful but that he “was able to refinance his home with a Swiss bank shortly thereafter.”\nKuettel also alleges that he has a college-savings account for his daughter in his own name at a\nSwiss bank and wishes to transfer it to his daughter, but that he has refrained from doing so for\nfear that if he does, either he or his daughter or the account will be subject to the FBAR penalty\n“if the IRS determines that his daughter has ‘wilfully’ failed to file an FBAR.” Kuettel alleges\nthat his daughter is incapable of filing the FBAR or of renouncing her United States citizenship\nbecause “she is only ten years old and too young to shoulder such an obligation,” and Kuettel\ndoes not wish to file the FBAR on his daughter’s behalf as FinCEN would ordinarily require the\nparent of a minor child to do.\n\n                                          Donna-Lane Nelson\n\n        Plaintiff Donna-Lane Nelson is a Swiss citizen and former American citizen living in\nboth Geneva, Switzerland, and Argèles-sur-Mer, France. Nelson claims that she renounced her\ncitizenship when, after FATCA was enacted, her Swiss bank (UBS) “notified her that she would\nnot be able to open a new account if she ever closed her existing one[,] because she was an\nAmerican.” Nelson subsequently married an American citizen with whom she shares a joint\nbank account at BNP Paribas in France. Nelson alleges that she “has had her private financial\naccount information disclosed to the IRS and the Treasury Department despite the fact that she is\nnot a U.S. citizen,” although Plaintiffs’ pleadings provide no further insight as to the nature of\nthis alleged disclosure, such as who made it, when it was made, or what it contained. Nelson has\n\f No. 16-3539                  Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 5\n\n\nalso had to prove or explain to UBS, BNP Paribas, and Raiffeisen (another European bank) that\nshe is not a United States citizen.\n\n                                              L. Marc Zell\n\n       Plaintiff L. Marc Zell is an American and Israeli citizen living in Israel. Zell, an attorney,\nalleges that “[b]ecause of FATCA, [he] and his firm have been required by their Israeli banking\ninstitutions to complete IRS withholding forms . . . as a precondition for opening trust accounts\nfor both U.S. and non-U.S. persons and entities” (emphasis added). Zell alleges that the “Israeli\nbanking officials have stated that they will require such submissions regardless of whether the\nbeneficiary is a U.S. person . . . because the trustee is or may be a U.S. person,” and that, as a\nresult, “banks have required [him] and his firm to close the trust account in some cases, and in\nother instances the banks have refused to open the requested trust account.” Zell alleges that he\nholds in trust certain client securities that are required by Israeli financial regulations to be “held\nby a qualified Israeli financial institution,” but Zell’s Israeli financial institution has requested\nZell to transfer the securities elsewhere “because both he and the beneficiary in this instance are\nU.S. citizens.” Finally, Zell alleges that his non-United States clients have been required by\nIsraeli banks “to fill out the IRS forms even though they have no connection with the United\nStates,” and that “banking officials have stated that the mere fact a U.S. person trustee or his law\nfirm is acting as a fiduciary is reason enough to require non-U.S. person beneficiaries to” report\ntheir identities and assets to the United States. Zell alleges that in “a few such instances,” the\nclient-beneficiary has terminated the attorney-client relationship, “resulting in palpable financial\nloss” to Zell and his firm.\n\n                                      Proposed Additional Plaintiffs\n\n       In addition to these seven plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ Proposed Amended Complaint sought to\nadd three new plaintiffs: Plaintiff Johnson’s wife Katerina Johnson, Plaintiff Kuettel’s daughter\nLois Kuettel, and Plaintiff Nelson’s husband Richard Adams. The amended complaint also\nincludes statements, absent from the original complaint, that some of Plaintiffs’ bank balances\nexceeded the threshold amounts at which FATCA or FBAR requirements might apply, but the\namended complaint otherwise recites the same claims and substantially the same facts as the\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 6\n\n\noriginal complaint. Importantly, none of the original plaintiffs or proposed plaintiffs alleges that\nthey have faced direct consequences such as the imposition or threatened imposition of a\nfinancial penalty for noncompliance with FATCA, the IGAs, or the FBAR.\n\n                              B. FATCA, the IGAs, and the FBAR\n\n       Plaintiffs assert challenges against five sets of laws: (1) FATCA’s individual-reporting\nrequirements; (2) FATCA’s “FFI Penalty”; (3) FATCA’s “Passthru Penalty”; (4) the IGAs; and\n(5) the FBAR Willfulness Penalty.\n\n                          1. FATCA’s Individual-Reporting Requirements\n\n       FATCA requires United States taxpayers with “specified foreign financial assets” to file a\nspecial report with their annual tax returns that discloses the name and address of the financial\ninstitution that maintains each specified account; the name and address of any issuers of\nspecified stocks or securities; information necessary to identify other specified instruments,\ncontracts, or interests and their issuers; and the maximum value of each specified asset during the\ntaxable year. 26 U.S.C. § 6038D(b)–(c). The reporting requirement applies to any United States\ntaxpayer when the “aggregate value of all [specified] assets exceeds $50,000 (or such higher\ndollar amount as the secretary may prescribe).” § 6038D(a) (emphasis added). Notably, the\nSecretary of the Treasury has prescribed higher dollar amounts for many taxpayers depending on\ntheir marital status, maximum asset value during the tax year, and place of residence. The\nfollowing individual-reporting thresholds have been in place since at least 2012:\n\n                                                                                Asset Value at Any\n                                                       Asset Value on Last\n                                                                                Time During Tax\n                                                        Day of Tax Year\n                                                                                Year\nIf living in the United States\n  Unmarried; married filing separately                       $50,000                  $75,000\n  Married filing jointly                                    $100,000                 $150,000\nIf living outside the United States\n  Unmarried; married filing separately                      $200,000                 $300,000\n Married filing jointly                                     $400,000                 $600,000\n\f No. 16-3539                    Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                             Page 7\n\n\nSee 26 C.F.R. § 1.6038D-2(a); see also Treasury Insp. Gen. for Tax Admin., U.S. Dept. of\nTreasury, “The Internal Revenue Service Has Made Progress in Implementing the Foreign\nAccount Tax Compliance Act,” Fig. 1., Ref. No. 2015-30-085 (Sept. 23, 2015).\n\n         Plaintiffs’ pleadings below and principal brief on appeal acknowledge only the $50,000\nand $75,000 values applicable to single filers residing in the United States. See, e.g., Appellants’\nBr. 2. Plaintiffs’ reply brief obliquely acknowledges the $200,000/$300,000 threshold values\nthat would seem to apply to most of the Plaintiffs on account of their overseas residences, noting\nthat “the secretary has recently increased the triggering amount for individuals living abroad,”\nbut Plaintiffs argue that “the threshold could be lowered to the statutory minimum at any time,\nthus triggering reporting for Plaintiffs.” Reply Br. 7.\n\n         Failure to report carries a penalty of up to $10,000 per violation plus 40% of the amount\nof any underpaid tax “attributable to” the assets for which disclosure was required. 26 U.S.C.\n§§ 6038D(d) (“[S]uch person shall pay a penalty of . . . .”) (emphasis added), 6662(j)(3). No\npenalty is due, however, if failure to report is “due to reasonable cause and not due to willful\nneglect.” Id. § 6038D(g).\n\n         Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the statutory reporting requirement, 26 U.S.C. § 6038D; the\nregulation that implements the reporting requirement, 26 C.F.R. § 1.6038D-4(a)(5); a regulation\nthat requires disclosing the opening or closing of a specified foreign account, 26 C.F.R.\n§ 1.6038D-4(a)(6); and a regulation that requires disclosing “income, gain, loss, deduction, or\ncredit recognized . . . with respect to” specified assets, 26 C.F.R. § 1.6038D-4(a)(8).\n\n  2. FATCA’s Institutional-Reporting Requirements, the FFI Penalty, and the Passthru Penalty\n\n         FATCA also imposes an institutional-reporting requirement on FFIs,1 which an FFI can\nsatisfy in one of three ways as set forth in 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3). First, the\n\n\n         1\n             A “foreign financial institution” (FFI) is “any financial institution which is a foreign entity.” 26 U.S.C.\n§ 1471(d)(4). Financial institutions include any entity that “accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or\nsimilar business,” “holds financial assets for the account of others” “as a substantial portion of its business,” or “is\nengaged (or holding itself out as being engaged) primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in\nsecurities . . . , partnership interests, commodities . . . , or any interest” in the same. 26 U.S.C. § 1471(d)(5).\nFATCA thus reaches across the globe, although its extraterritorial reach is not directly at issue in this litigation, nor\nis it at issue at all in the present appeal, which concerns only the Plaintiffs’ standing to sue.\n\f No. 16-3539                   Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.

United States persons include citizens and residents of the United States, domestic partnerships\nand corporations, estates other than foreign estates, and trusts subject to primary administrative supervision by a\ncourt of the United States where a United States person has authority to control “all substantial decisions” of the\ntrust. 26 U.S.C. § 7701.\n        3\n           A “passthru payment” is defined as “any withholdable payment or other payment to the extent attributable\nto a withholdable payment.” 26 U.S.C. § 1471(d)(7). Withholdable payments include “(i) any payment of interest\n(including any original issue discount), dividends, rents, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations,\nremunerations, emoluments, and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income, if such\npayment is from sources within the United States, and (ii) any gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of\nany property of a type which can produce interest or dividends from sources within the United States.” Id.\n§ 1473(1)(A). The “withholding agent” with respect to each withholdable payment is obligated to deduct and\nwithhold the 30% tax. Withholding agents include “all persons, in whatever capacity acting, having the control,\nreceipt, custody, disposal, or payment of any withholdable payment.” Id. § 1473(4).\n        4\n          “Recalcitrant account holder” means any account holder that fails to comply with an FFI’s “reasonable\nrequests” for information necessary to determine which accounts are United States accounts; fails to provide name,\naddress, Taxpayer Identification Number, and account-number information to an FFI for United States accounts; or\nfails, upon an FFI’s request, to waive the applicability of a foreign law that would (but for a valid and effective\nwaiver by the account holder) otherwise prohibit disclosure of such information. 26 U.S.C. § 1471(d)(6).\n\f No. 16-3539                 Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.           Page 9\n\n\n       Second, the FFI “may be treated by the Secretary as meeting the requirements of”\nFATCA if the FFI either “complies with such procedures as the Secretary may prescribe to\nensure that such institution does not maintain United States accounts” or “is a member of a class\nof institutions with respect to which the Secretary has determined that the application of\n[FATCA’s reporting requirement] is not necessary.” 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(2). As we discuss\nbelow, FFIs subject to the jurisdiction of countries that have signed IGAs with Treasury may be\ndeemed compliant under 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(2) by virtue of their (and their country’s)\ncompliance with an IGA.\n\n       Third, the FFI may “elect” to withhold a tax from payments sent to the FFI from\n“accounts held by recalcitrant account holders or foreign financial institutions which do not meet\nthe requirements of this subsection” rather than agreeing to withhold the 30% tax from the FFI’s\npayments to recalcitrant account holders or noncompliant FFIs. 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(3).\n\n       If an FFI fails to meet FATCA’s institutional-reporting requirement in one of these three\nways, then the FFI is subject to having “a tax equal to 30 percent” deducted and withheld from\nall withholdable payments sent to the FFI. 26 U.S.C. § 1471(a). Plaintiffs assert and the\ngovernment does not dispute that this tax—the so-called “FFI Penalty”—applies to United\nStates-sourced income payable to the FFI as well as foreign-sourced income payable to the FFI\nfrom other FFIs. See 26 C.F.R. § 1.1471-2; Compl. 29; Appellees’ Br. 4.\n\n       In short, if an FFI is not subject to the jurisdiction of a country that has concluded an\nIGA, the FFI must either comply with FATCA (and withhold the Passthru Penalty from\npayments it makes to recalcitrant account holders and noncompliant FFIs) or elect to have a\n30% tax withheld from incoming payments from recalcitrant account holders or noncompliant\nFFIs; otherwise, the FFI becomes noncompliant itself and thus subject to the FFI Penalty of 30%\nof all withholdable payments5 it receives from any source whatsoever.\n\n       Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the enforcement of the reporting requirement, the withholding\nprovisions, the regulations implementing these provisions, and the IRS’s use of Form 8966,\n“FATCA Report,” on which FFIs make FATCA disclosures. Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin the\n\n       5\n           See n.3, supra.\n\f No. 16-3539                    Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.          Page 10\n\n\nenforcement of the Passthru Penalty, which is the 30% “tax”6 that FFIs deduct and withhold\nfrom payments to recalcitrant account holders or noncompliant FFIs under 26 U.S.C.\n§ 1471(b)(1)(D). See also 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.1471-4(a)(1), 1.1471-4T(b)(1).\n\n                                                   3. The IGAs\n\n       Treasury, on behalf of the United States, has reached agreements with dozens of foreign\ngovernments to “facilitate the implementation of FATCA.” 26 C.F.R. § 1.1471-1(b)(79). These\nintergovernmental agreements (IGAs) take two forms: “Model 1” IGAs and “Model 2” IGAs.\n\n       Under a Model 1 IGA, the foreign government agrees to collect the financial information\nthat FATCA would otherwise require FFIs to report, and the foreign government itself reports\nthat information directly to the IRS. Notably, the Model 1 IGA makes clear that as long as the\nforeign government “complies with its obligations under” the IGA, any FFI within that\ngovernment’s jurisdiction that also complies with its own obligations under the IGA (such as\nsending accountholder information to the foreign government) “shall be treated as complying\nwith” FATCA7 and is exempt from FATCA reporting, penalties, and withholding. See, e.g.,\nU.S. Dept. of Treasury FATCA Resource Center, Model 1A IGA Reciprocal, Preexisting TIEA\nor DTC, Art. 4, § 1, (Nov. 30, 2014), http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-\npolicy/treaties/Documents/FATCA-Reciprocal-Model-1A-Agreement-Preexisting-TIEA-or-\nDTC-11-30-14.pdf.\n\n       Treasury has signed Model 1 IGAs with Canada (in force June 27, 2014), Czech Republic\n(in force December 18, 2014), Israel (in force August 29, 2016), France (in force October 14,\n2014), and Denmark (in force September 30, 2015). Plaintiffs’ original complaint, in which they\nsought to enjoin the Canadian, Czech, and Israeli IGAs, was filed July 14, 2015; Plantiffs sought\nleave to file their proposed amended complaint, which would also enjoin the French and the\nDanish IGAs, on October 30, 2015. Neither complaint mentions that although all the above-\nmentioned Model 1 IGAs were signed on June 30, 2014, the Israeli IGA was not yet in force at\n\n\n       6\n           We decline to address whether the 30% deduction is a tax or a penalty.\n       7\n         The IGAs are the principal means by which an FFI may be treated as complying with FATCA under\n26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(2), discussed above.\n\f No. 16-3539                Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.            Page 11\n\n\nthe time of filing either complaint.        U.S. Dept. of Treasury FATCA Resource Center,\nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-16-27.pdf.      Indeed, the Israeli Knesset did not approve\nregulations implementing FATCA until August 4, 2016. Nevertheless, Treasury has declared\nthat any foreign jurisdiction that signed an IGA before November 30, 2014, would be treated “as\nif [it had] an IGA in effect” and would thus be exempt from FATCA reporting, penalties, and\nwithholding—including penalties against recalcitrant account holders—“as long as the\njurisdiction is taking the steps necessary to bring the IGA into force within a reasonable period of\ntime.”       See IRS Announcement 2016-27, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-16-27.pdf; IRS\nAnnouncement 2013-43, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-43.pdf. One such announcement\nset December 31, 2016, as the date by which jurisdictions whose IGAs were not yet in force\nowed “a detailed explanation” to Treasury. See IRS Announcement 2016-27 at 2–3. The result\nof the Treasury notices and the pending IGA is that from the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed\nuntil well after the district-court record closed, neither FATCA nor any IGA had any legal effect\nin Israel.\n\n         Under a Model 2 IGA, the foreign government agrees to modify its laws to the extent\nnecessary to enable its FFIs to report their United States account information directly to the IRS.\nTreasury has signed a Model 2 IGA with Switzerland (in force June 2, 2014), in which the Swiss\ngovernment has agreed to “direct all Reporting Swiss Financial Institutions” to “register with the\nIRS” and comply with applicable FATCA provisions. Swiss IGA Art. 3 § 1. One provision of\nthe Swiss IGA, Article 5, is not yet in force because it requires that a separate “Protocol”—an\namendment to a bilateral tax treaty that was signed by the United States and Switzerland in\n2009—first come into force, but the United States Senate has not yet approved that Protocol,\nleaving Article 5 inoperative. Article 5 would authorize the United States to make “group\nrequests” to the Swiss Federal Department of Finance or its designee for aggregated reportable-\naccount information. Swiss IGA Art. 2 § 1; Art. 5. Despite the fact that Article 5 is inoperative,\nhowever, the Swiss Model 2 IGA, somewhat like the Model 1 IGAs, provides that Swiss FFIs\nthat register with the IRS and comply with an “FFI Agreement” (essentially, an agreement\nbetween an individual Swiss FFI and the United States government to report United States\naccount information) “shall be treated as complying with” FATCA and are thus exempt from any\nprovisions of FATCA beyond those incorporated into the IGA or FFI Agreement. Swiss IGA\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                 Page 12\n\n\nArt. 6. Swiss FFIs’ obligations are lighter under the IGA than under FATCA: for example, as\nlong as a Swiss FFI complies with the registration and reporting requirements in Article 3 of the\nIGA, it is not required to withhold the passthru tax from recalcitrant account holders or to close\nany account holders’ accounts. Swiss IGA Art. 7 § 1.\n\n        Plaintiffs seek to invalidate the Canadian, Czech, Israeli, French, Danish, and Swiss\nIGAs.\n\n                                 4. The FBAR Willfulness Penalty\n\n        The last set of laws at issue is the foreign-bank-account-reporting (FBAR) requirement of\nthe Bank Secrecy Act, which requires any United States person with “a financial interest in or\nsignature authority over at least one financial account located outside of the United States” to file\nFinCEN Form 114 (also referred to as the FBAR) with Treasury annually. Reporting is required\nfor accounts held during the previous calendar year if “the aggregate value of all foreign\nfinancial accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year reported.”               See\n31 U.S.C. § 5314; 31 C.F.R. §§ 1010.306(c), .350. The FBAR appears to have nothing to do\nwith FATCA or the IGAs other than that presumably most if not all individuals subject to\nFATCA’s reporting requirement are also required to file an FBAR, since the reporting threshold\nfor the FBAR is lower than any reporting threshold for FATCA.\n\n        Nevertheless,   Plaintiffs   challenge   the   FBAR’s     willful-failure-to-report    penalty\n(“Willfulness Penalty”), which provides that “[t]he Secretary of the Treasury may impose” a\npenalty equal to the greater of $100,000 or half the value in the reportable account(s) at the time\nof the violation. 31 U.S.C. § 5321(a)(5)(A), (C) (emphasis added). The ordinary penalty (absent\na showing of willfulness), which Plaintiffs do not challenge, is $10,000 per violation. Id.\n§ 5321(a)(5)(B)(i).     Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin the FBAR account-balance-reporting\nrequirement—that is, the requirement to complete FinCEN Form 114.\n\n                           C. Counts Enumerated in the Complaint\n\n        In both the original complaint and the proposed amended complaint, Plaintiffs brought\neight counts against Defendants. A brief summary of the counts is provided here as relevant\n\f No. 16-3539              Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.             Page 13\n\n\nbackground, although Plaintiffs need not demonstrate that they are likely to prevail as to any of\nthese counts in order to have standing to bring them.\n\n                   Counts 1 & 2: The IGAs Were Unconstitutionally Executed\n\n        Plaintiffs claim in Count 1 that the IGAs are “unconstitutional sole executive\nagreements” that exceed the scope of the President’s constitutional power because they are not\nauthorized by Congress through the ordinary legislative process. Compl. 37. Plaintiffs claim\nthat the only constitutionally permissible means by which the executive branch may make\ninternational agreements are by the Treaty Clause, an Act of Congress, a provision in an existing\ntreaty, or the President’s independent constitutional foreign-affairs power—which Plaintiffs\nclaim does not include the power to impose a tax or to create a tax-collection mechanism like the\nIGAs.\n\n        Alternatively, in Count 2, Plaintiffs claim that the IGAs are impermissible because they\nare “inconsistent with legislation enacted by Congress in the exercise of its constitutional\nauthority”—namely, FATCA—to the extent that they, among other things, allow FFIs to report\nto their national governments rather than to the IRS. Amended Compl. 49 (quoting State\nDepartment Foreign Affairs Manual). Plaintiffs thus claim that the IGAs “override” FATCA and\n“must be held unlawful and set aside” because “Treasury and the IRS have acted contrary to the\nPresident’s constitutional power” in entering into the IGAs.\n\n                 Count 3: The FATCA, IGA, and FBAR Reporting Requirements\n                              Violate the Equal Protection Clause\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that compared to the various data reported to the IRS about foreign\naccounts under FATCA, the IGAs, and the FBAR, “[t]he only financial information reported to\nthe IRS about domestic accounts is the amount of interest paid to the accounts during a calendar\nyear.” Plaintiffs thus claim that United States citizens living abroad are treated differently than\nUnited States citizens living in the United States, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\nEqual Protection Clause (as incorporated against the federal government through the Fifth\nAmendment Due Process Clause). See United States v. Ovalle, 136 F.3d 1092, 1095 n.2 (6th\nCir. 1998).\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.            Page 14\n\n\n              Counts 4–6: The FFI Penalty, Passthru Penalty, and FBAR Willfulness\n                       Penalty Impose Unconstitutionally Excessive Fines\n\n         In Count 4, Plaintiffs challenge the FFI Penalty, which is imposed directly upon FFIs for\nnoncompliance with FATCA, as an unconstitutionally excessive fine, claiming that “[t]he\npenalty is used as a hammer to coerce compliance by [FFIs] everywhere in the world.” Plaintiffs\nclaim that the penalty is unconstitutional because it “is grossly disproportional to the gravity of\nthe offense it seeks to punish.” In Count 5, Plaintiffs lodge the same attack against the Passthru\nPenalty, which FFIs apply to recalcitrant account holders under FATCA. In Count 6, Plaintiffs\nlodge the same attack against the FBAR Willfulness Penalty.\n\n         Counts 7 & 8: The Institutional-Reporting Requirements of FATCA and the IGAs\n                     Violate Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment Right to Privacy\n\n         In Count 7, Plaintiffs claim that FATCA’s requirement that FFIs report account data to\nthe United States constitutes a warrantless search in violation of Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment\nprotection against unreasonable searches and seizures. In Count 8, Plaintiffs claim that the\nIGAs’ requirement that FFIs report account data either to their governments or to the United\nStates likewise violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\n                                     D. Procedural History\n\n         Plaintiffs filed their original complaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Ohio on July 14, 2015. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which\nthe district court denied, holding that Plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits because\nthey lacked standing and, alternatively, because they had brought allegations that failed as a\nmatter of law. On October 30, 2015, Plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaint. The\ngovernment filed both a motion to dismiss and an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to\namend.\n\n         On April 26, 2016, the district court granted the government’s motion to dismiss for lack\nof standing, declined to reach the government’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and\ndenied Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend. The district court denied leave to amend only after\nconsidering the new plaintiffs and their new claims and after determining that even if leave to\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 15\n\n\namend were granted, Plaintiffs still would not have standing to sue, rendering leave to amend\nfutile. This timely appeal followed.\n\n       In the interest of simplicity, we will discuss whether Plaintiffs have standing in light of\nthe facts pleaded in both the original complaint and the proposed amended complaint. For the\nreasons that follow, the district court rightly held that none of the plaintiffs had standing to sue,\nand that granting leave to amend would not cure the defect in standing.\n\n                                                 II\n\n                                    A. Elements of Standing\n\n       Federal courts have constitutional authority to decide only “cases” and “controversies.”\nU.S. Const. art. III § 2; see Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911). The requirement of\nstanding is “rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or controversy.” Spokeo, Inc. v.\nRobins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). To bring suit, Plaintiffs must have “alleged such a\npersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which\nsharpens the presentation of issues” before the court. Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962).\n\n       The “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing is that for each claim, each\nplaintiff must allege an actual or imminent injury that is traceable to the defendant and\nredressable by the court. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–62 (1992) (holding\nwildlife-conservation organizations lacked standing to seek injunctive relief against the Secretary\nof the Interior’s interpretation of the Endangered Species Act where organization members’ harm\nwas the endangering of wild animals in Sri Lanka but where the members had no current plans to\ngo to Sri Lanka to observe the animals); see Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.,\n528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000) (agreeing that “a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for\neach form of relief sought”).\n\n                                             1. Injury\n\n       The injury must be an “injury in fact,” meaning “an invasion of a legally protected\ninterest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) ‘actual or imminent, not “conjectural” or\n“hypothetical.”’” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (emphasis added) (citations omitted) (first quoting\n\f No. 16-3539              Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.            Page 16\n\n\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984); then quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149,\n155 (1990) (quoting Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983))).\n\n        There is no “legally protected interest” in maintaining the privacy of one’s bank records\nfrom government access. United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 442 (1976) (holding bank clients\nhad no legitimate expectation of privacy in banking information revealed to a third party); United\nStates v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 288 (6th Cir. 2010) (noting that Miller involved “business\nrecords” as opposed to “confidential communications”).\n\n        The requirement that an injury be “concrete and particularized” has two discrete parts:\nconcreteness, which is the requirement that the injury be “real,” and not “abstract,” Spokeo,\n136 S. Ct. at 1548, and particularization, which is the requirement that the plaintiff “personally\n[have] suffered some actual or threatened injury” as opposed to bringing a generalized grievance.\nValley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,\n454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982) (emphasis added).\n\n        Concreteness. “Abstract, intellectual problems,” FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 20 (1998),\n“abstract concern,” Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 67 (1986), and “[a]bstract injury,” Lyons,\n461 U.S. at 101, do not present concrete injuries. That said, concrete is not synonymous with\ntangible: intangible harms such as those produced by defamation or the denial of individual\nrights may certainly be concrete enough to constitute an injury in fact. Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at\n1549.\n\n        Particularization. Additionally, “a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance\nabout government—claiming only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in proper application\nof the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him\nthan it does the public at large—does not state an Article III case or controversy.” Lujan, 504\nU.S. at 573–74 (emphasis added); see also Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923)\n(denying municipal taxpayer standing to challenge federal spending measure because the\ntaxpayer’s “interest in the moneys of the Treasury—partly realized from taxation and partly from\nother sources—is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable”);\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                Page 17\n\n\nHollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652, 2662 (2013) (“[A]n asserted right to have the\nGovernment act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone[.]”).\n\n       Legislative standing. The general rule that individual legislators lack standing to sue in\ntheir official capacity as congressman or senator follows from the requirement that an injury\nmust be concrete and particularized. See Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 816, 821 (1997) (in\naction by members of Congress to challenge the Line Item Veto Act, “loss of political power”—\nas opposed to loss of a private right—was not a concrete injury, and any institutional injury to\nCongress arising from the Act was not particularized to any individual plaintiff). An apparent\nexception to the general rule against legislative standing arises when the legislators are suing on\na vote-nullification theory and allege that if their votes had been given effect, those votes would\nhave been sufficient to defeat or enact a specific legislative action. Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S.\n433, 438 (1939) (holding that where forty-member Kansas State Senate had deadlocked twenty-\nto-twenty in voting on a proposed constitutional amendment, the twenty senators who had voted\nagainst the amendment had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the lieutenant\ngovernor’s tie-breaking vote in favor of the amendment, because the lieutenant governor’s vote\neffectively nullified the plaintiffs’ votes and the plaintiffs’ votes would have been sufficient to\nprevent ratification of the amendment); see also Baird v. Norton, 266 F.3d 408, 410 (6th Cir.\n2001) (holding that a Michigan House member and a Michigan state senator lacked standing to\nchallenge gaming compacts that were approved by a concurrent-resolution procedure requiring\nonly a majority of votes cast rather than by the ordinary legislative process that would have\nrequired a majority of the votes of all members in each house).\n\n       We held in Baird that to the extent that the legislators complained of the deprivation of\nprocedural safeguards built into the ordinary legislative process, they had “at most, a generalized\ngrievance shared by all Michigan residents alike,” and thus lacked the sort of particularized\ninjury in fact that standing requires. Baird, 266 F.3d at 411. And we held that the legislators\ncould not show a Coleman-like vote-nullification injury because their votes “would not have\nbeen sufficient to defeat either the concurrent resolution . . . or legislation to similar effect.” Id.\nat 412. In such circumstances, legislators’ remedy lies not with the courts but with the legislative\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.

Standing can derive from an imminent, rather than an actual,\ninjury, but only when “the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct.” Davis v. FEC, 554\nU.S. 724, 734 (2008) (holding candidate for House of Representatives had standing to challenge\nelection regulation exempting opponents of self-financing candidates from certain campaign-\ncontribution limits where plaintiff candidate had declared his candidacy and was demonstrably a\nself-financing candidate whose opponents would imminently receive expanded access to\ncampaign funding).\n\n       In a pre-enforcement challenge to a federal statute, the Supreme Court has held that a\nplaintiff satisfies the injury requirement of standing by alleging “an intention to engage in a\ncourse of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and\n[that] there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.”       Susan B. Anthony List v.\nDriehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2342 (2014) (quoting Babbitt v. Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289, 298\n(1979)); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975); Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro.\nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264 (1977) (holding that one of the plaintiffs had standing to\nchallenge a discriminatory zoning law where an injunction against the law would have produced\n“at least a ‘substantial probability,’ Warth, 422 U.S. at 504, that” the plaintiff’s desired housing\nproject would “materialize”).\n\n       The mere possibility of prosecution, however—no matter how strong the plaintiff’s intent\nto engage in forbidden conduct may be—does not amount to a “credible threat” of prosecution.\nInstead, the threat of prosecution “must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact.”\nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147 (2013) (quoting Whitmore, 495 U.S. at\n158). Putting the Supreme Court’s language in Warth, Driehaus, and Clapper together: to have\nstanding to bring a pre-enforcement challenge to a federal statute, there must be a substantial\nprobability that the plaintiff actually will engage in conduct that is arguably affected with a\nconstitutional interest, and there must be a certain threat of prosecution if the plaintiff does\nindeed engage in that conduct.\n\f No. 16-3539                 Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.

Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495–96 (1974)).\n\n        Third-party standing. Generally, “a plaintiff must ‘assert his own legal rights and\ninterests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.’”\nCoyne ex rel. Ohio v. Am. Tobacco Co., 183 F.3d 488, 494 (6th Cir. 1999) (quoting Warth,\n422 U.S. at 499); see also Ovalle, 136 F.3d at 1100–01; Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410\n(1991)). The rare “third-party standing” exception to this requirement allows federal courts to\nhear cases in which a plaintiff can “show that (1) it has suffered an injury in fact; (2) it has a\nclose relationship to the third party; and (3) there is some hindrance to the third party’s ability to\nprotect his or her own interests.” Mount Elliott Cemetery Ass’n v. City of Troy, 171 F.3d 398,\n404 (6th Cir. 1999); see also Connection Distrib. Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 295 (6th Cir. 1998).\nPlaintiffs have expressly stated that they “rely neither on third-party standing nor [on] the harms\nof others,” Appellants’ Br. 24, but the Government contends that without invoking third-party\nstanding, Plaintiffs would have no way to attack the FFI Penalty, which is imposed only on\nfinancial institutions that are not parties to this litigation.\n\n                                              2. Causation\n\n        Even if a plaintiff alleges an actual or imminent injury that is concrete and particularized,\nthe plaintiff must also show that the injury is “fairly traceable to the defendant’s allegedly\nunlawful conduct.” Allen, 468 U.S. at 751 (holding parents of schoolchildren lacked standing to\nsue IRS to challenge private schools’ tax exemptions where the parents’ alleged harm of\nincreased school segregation was caused by the private schools’ choice to racially discriminate\nand was not fairly traceable to the IRS). When a plaintiff’s alleged injury is the result of “the\nindependent action of some third party not before the court,” the plaintiff generally lacks\n\f No. 16-3539                 Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.           Page 20\n\n\nstanding to seek its redress. Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 42 (1976); see\nalso Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61; Shearson v. Holder, 725 F.3d 588, 592 (6th Cir. 2013); Ammex,\nInc. v. United States, 367 F.3d 530, 533 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that a retailer lacked standing to\nchallenge a federal excise tax assessed against a third-party fuel supplier, even where the retailer\nwas required by contract to pay the supplier an amount equal to the excise tax upfront at the time\nof purchase, since the “alleged injury . . . in the form of increased fuel costs was not occasioned\nby the Government”).\n\n        Neither is injury caused by market conditions fairly traceable to a regulation that happens\nto regulate that market.      Warth, 422 U.S. at 506 (holding Rochester-area residents lacked\nstanding to challenge suburb’s zoning as unconstitutionally excluding low- and moderate-income\nresidents where plaintiffs were unable to allege other than in conclusory terms that they had been\ninjured; where none of the plaintiffs personally owned property in the suburb or had been denied\na variance or permit by the suburb; and where the plaintiffs’ “inability to reside in [the suburb\nwas] the consequence of the economics of the area housing market, rather than respondents’\nassertedly illegal acts”).\n\n        Nor is an injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s conduct if the plaintiffs have\n“inflict[ed] [the] harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm.” Clapper,\n133 S. Ct. at 1151.\n\n        As we noted above, Plaintiffs do not rely on third-party standing. Rather, Plaintiffs argue\nthat they have suffered “indirect” harm. An indirect harm is an injury caused to a plaintiff when\nthe defendant’s unlawful conduct harms a third party who in turn causes the plaintiff’s harm—\nunlike in third-party standing cases, a plaintiff claiming indirect harm is seeking to vindicate the\nplaintiff’s own rights and not a third party’s. Appellants’ Br. 23 (citing Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S.\n113, 124 (1973)). Plaintiffs rely heavily on Roe: they argue that the law challenged in Roe\ndirectly harmed abortionists, not women seeking abortions, but that the indirect harm to women\nseeking abortions was nevertheless fairly traceable to the law. Plaintiffs argue that in Roe, the\ndoctors had only two options (provide abortions and thus break the law, or comply with the law\nby declining to provide abortions); Plaintiffs argue that in this case, similarly, FFIs have only\n\f No. 16-3539                     Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                           Page 21\n\n\ntwo options: disregard FATCA and thus become subject to the 30% FFI Penalty, or comply with\nFATCA by refusing to do business with certain United States persons.\n\n         But Plaintiffs’ analogy overlooks a third option available here and not in Roe: FFIs may\ncomply with FATCA and do business with United States persons—without imposing additional\nrequirements on their clients beyond what FATCA and the IGAs themselves require.8 As we\nwill discuss, several of Plaintiffs’ alleged harms arise not from FFIs’ acting under the command\nof FATCA or an IGA, but rather from the FFIs’ voluntary choice to go above and beyond\nFATCA and the IGAs. FFIs may do so, for example, by gathering FATCA-compliance-related\ninformation from non-United States persons, or by choosing not to do business with certain\nindividuals, whether to protect their own interests in FATCA compliance or for some other\nreason. See, e.g., Amended Compl. 12 (“[R]ather than reporting information about U.S. clients,\nSaxo Bank is turning away U.S. citizens like Mark.”). And although an injury “produced by” a\ndefendant’s “determinative or coercive effect” upon a third party (such as the injury of inability\nto obtain an abortion, produced by the determinative effect of the challenged law in Roe upon\nabortionists) may suffice for standing, an injury that results from the third party’s voluntary and\nindependent actions or omissions does not. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).\n\n                                                  3. Redressability\n\n         Finally, a plaintiff must also plead facts sufficient to establish that the court is capable of\nproviding relief that would redress the alleged injury. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561–62.\n\n\n\n         8\n           Plaintiffs’ Roe analogy also fails when individual account holders are compared to the plaintiffs in Roe:\nthe account holders’ options are not “close your account or pay the penalty,” but rather “close your account, pay the\npenalty, or keep your account open while filing the required paperwork to do so.” This is unlike Roe where a\nwoman seeking an abortion that was not otherwise permitted had no “third option”: the only options were to seek an\nillicit abortion or to decline to have the abortion in the first place. A similar analogy could be drawn to highway-\nspeed laws: a motorist wishing to travel quickly, perhaps to transport perishable goods or to visit an ill relative, has\nonly the option to speed (and risk a traffic citation) or to comply with the law (and risk having spoiled goods or\nmissing the death of a relative). In such a situation, the motorist might well be able to argue that the injury of having\nspoiled goods or missing the death of the relative was fairly traceable to the speed-limit law. But this situation\nwould not be like the Plaintiffs’ situation here—rather, it would be analogous to the Plaintiffs’ situation here if the\nmotorist had a third option of speeding upon condition of filing paperwork with the state attesting to the reasons why\nspeeding is necessary. Perhaps if that paperwork itself were difficult to file, an injury could arise from the time and\ntrouble spent filing it—but, notably, Plaintiffs stated at oral argument that they do not assert that the time and trouble\nof filing FATCA paperwork is itself an injury for standing purposes.\n\f No. 16-3539              Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.             Page 22\n\n\n                        B. Burden of Proof and Standard of Review\n\n       Each plaintiff has the burden “clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper\nparty to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute.” Warth, 422 U.S. at 518. “[W]e assess\nstanding as of the time a suit is filed.” Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1157. And standing must remain\n“extant at all stages of review.” Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 67\n(1997) (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975)).\n\n       “Standing cannot be ‘inferred argumentatively from averments in the pleadings,’”\nFW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990) (quoting Grace v. American Central\nIns. Co., 109 U.S. 278, 284 (1883)), or even from the government’s concession of standing, “but\nrather ‘must affirmatively appear in the record.’”      FW/PBS, 493 U.S. at 231–36 (quoting\nMansfield C. & L.M.R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, 392 (1884)) (holding certain plaintiffs did not\nhave standing to attack ordinance governing sexually oriented businesses where the record did\nnot reveal that any one of these plaintiffs was subject to the ordinance, even though the city\nattorney conceded at oral argument before the Supreme Court that “one or two” of them had had\ntheir licenses denied under the ordinance). The Supreme Court has “always insisted on strict\ncompliance with this jurisdictional standing requirement,” Raines, 521 U.S. at 819. And the\ninquiry into whether plaintiffs have standing is “especially rigorous” where, as here, “reaching\nthe merits of the dispute would force [a court] to decide whether an action taken by one of the\nother two branches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.” Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at\n1147 (quoting Raines, 521 U.S. at 819–20).\n\n       We review de novo the district court’s dismissal for lack of standing, we accept as true all\nthe material allegations in the Plaintiffs’ complaints, and we construe Plaintiffs’ complaints in\nPlaintiffs’ favor. See Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421–22 (1969); Haines v. Fed. Motor\nCarrier Safety Admin., 814 F.3d 417, 423 (6th Cir. 2016).\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.             Page 23\n\n\n                        C. No Plaintiff Has Standing as to Any Claim\n\n                       1. No Plaintiff Has Standing to Challenge FATCA\n\n       No Plaintiff has standing to challenge FATCA’s individual-reporting requirements or the\nPassthru Penalty because no Plaintiff (or proposed Plaintiff) has alleged either an actual injury\nthat is fairly traceable to FATCA or an imminent threat of prosecution from noncompliance with\nFATCA.\n\n       First, no Plaintiff has alleged any actual enforcement of FATCA such as a demand for\ncompliance with the individual-reporting requirement, the imposition of a penalty for\nnoncompliance, or an FFI’s deduction of the Passthru Penalty from a payment to or from a\nforeign account.\n\n       Second, no Plaintiff can satisfy the Driehaus test for standing to bring a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to FATCA because no Plaintiff claims to hold enough foreign assets to be subject to\nthe individual-reporting requirement, and, as a result, no Plaintiff can claim that there is a\n“credible threat” of either prosecution for failing to comply with FATCA or imposition of a\nPassthru Penalty by an FFI. All but two of the Plaintiffs either fail to state the value of their\nforeign assets altogether or allege only that they have foreign accounts with an aggregate value\n“greater than $10,000”—but FATCA’s individual-reporting requirement applies only to\nindividuals with at least $50,000 worth of assets held in foreign accounts, with significantly\nhigher thresholds in some cases. See, e.g., Amended Compl. 12, 19, 21, 28, 30, 34.\n\n       The two exceptions are Johnson and Zell. Johnson has alleged that “[t]he aggregate\nvalue of [his] foreign accounts has been greater than $75,000 in 2014 and 2015[,] which subjects\nhim to both FATCA individual reporting and FBAR reporting.” Id. at 16. But Johnson lives\noutside the United States and would thus have to hold foreign accounts with an aggregate value\nin excess of $200,000 to be subject to the individual-reporting requirement. That Treasury might\nsomeday lower the threshold from $200,000 to $50,000 (the statutory minimum) or $75,000 or\nany other level does not change the fact that, now and at the time Plaintiffs filed suit, Johnson is\nnot subject to FATCA. Nor is it of any consequence that Johnson’s foreign banks may be\nsubject to FATCA’s institutional-reporting requirement on account of Johnson’s ownership of\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.               Page 24\n\n\naccounts exceeding $75,000 in value.         Johnson cannot challenge the individual-reporting\nrequirement or the Passthru Penalty without showing that Johnson himself is subject to those\nprovisions, and based on the facts as stated in Plaintiffs’ pleadings, Johnson is not.\n\n       Further, Johnson—like all Plaintiffs—lacks standing to challenge FATCA’s FFI Penalty\n(the penalty imposed upon financial institutions for their noncompliance with FATCA) because\nsuch a challenge would require either that the foreign banks themselves bring suit or that\nPlaintiffs rely on third-party standing, and Plaintiffs have made clear that they do not.\n\n       As for Zell, he alleges that he “had signatory authority over accounts with an aggregate\nyear-end balance of greater than $200,000 in 2014, which would subject him to FATCA\nindividual reporting.” Id. at 34 (emphasis added). But, although the Israeli IGA imposes a\nreporting requirement for trust accounts like Zell’s, FATCA itself does not require reporting\nwhere, as here, the trust accounts are held entirely for the benefit of non-United States persons.\nAnd although the Israeli IGA appears as of August 2016 to be in force in Israel, it was not in\nforce prior to then.     Zell could not have been subject to FATCA’s individual-reporting\nrequirement, either at the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed or at the time Plaintiffs sought\nleave to amend their complaint, based either on Zell’s own accounts (for which he alleges only\nan aggregate value exceeding $10,000) or on Zell’s “signatory authority” over his clients’ trust\naccounts, because only the Israeli IGA, not FATCA itself, required (or requires) reporting of\naccounts based on signatory authority, and the Israeli IGA was not in effect when Plaintiffs filed\nor sought to amend their complaint.\n\n       Finally, some Plaintiffs allege other harms arising from FATCA apart from its individual-\nreporting requirement or its Passthru Penalty. But none of these alleged harms are injuries that\nare fairly traceable to FATCA.        Crawford alleges that Saxo Bank’s decision not to allow\nCrawford (or Aksioner, Crawford’s brokerage firm) to accept United States clients, is an injury;\neven if it is, however, it is not fairly traceable to FATCA but rather, as in Allen and Ammex, to\nSaxo Bank’s own independent actions. The Johnsons’ decision to separate their own assets to\navoid disclosing Katerina Johnson’s financial affairs to the United States government when there\nis no allegation that FATCA has actually compelled any such disclosure, similarly, is traceable to\nthe Johnsons’ own independent actions, not to FATCA.\n\f No. 16-3539                Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                Page 25\n\n\n       Nelson alleges that she has “had her private financial account information disclosed to\nthe IRS and the Treasury Department despite the fact that she is not a U.S. citizen.” Amended\nCompl. 28. But Nelson has stated no facts whatsoever indicating that her account information\nwas disclosed because of FATCA—and thus any injury resulting from this disclosure cannot\nfairly be traced to FATCA.\n\n       In Plaintiffs’ complaint, Adams and Zell have alleged that they have had difficulty\nobtaining banking services from foreign banks. Zell specifically alleges that he has been told to\nmove securities out of an Israeli bank and that he has been informed that his non-United States\nclients are required to complete IRS forms at the request of Israeli banks. But, again, a foreign\nbank’s choice either not to do business with Adams or Zell, or (as in Zell’s case) to require Zell’s\nnon-United States clients to make financial or other disclosures even though these clients are not\nsubject to FATCA, is a choice voluntarily made by the bank and is not fairly traceable to\nFATCA. And the resulting choice of any of Zell’s clients not to do business with Zell is fairly\ntraceable to the clients or perhaps to the Israeli banks, but is not fairly traceable to FATCA.\nLikewise with Kuettel, who alleges that he had difficulty refinancing his mortgage until after he\nrenounced his American citizenship: such difficulty cannot serve as the basis for standing\nbecause it is, at best, past injury that is insufficient to warrant injunctive relief (it is past injury\nbecause Kuettel has renounced his American citizenship and no longer claims to have difficulty\nrefinancing his mortgage), and, in any event, it is traceable only to the foreign banks and not to\nFATCA because nothing in FATCA prevented the foreign banks from refinancing Kuettel’s\nmortgage.\n\n       Several plaintiffs allege injuries that are not concrete. Kish, for example, alleges that\n“FATCA has at times caused some discord between” him and his wife. Id. at 19. But marital\ndiscord, particularized though it may be, is not the sort of concrete injury that can give rise to\nstanding. Neither is Crawford or Johnson’s discomfort with FATCA’s reporting requirements,\nor Nelson’s “resent[ment],” id. at 28, at having to prove to European banks that she is no longer\na United States citizen in order to obtain banking services.\n\n       In sum, no Plaintiff has standing to challenge FATCA’s individual-reporting\nrequirements, the Passthru Penalty, or the FFI Penalty, because no Plaintiff has suffered direct\n\f No. 16-3539                   Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                       Page 26\n\n\nharm that is fairly traceable to any of these challenged provisions, and because no Plaintiff has\nalleged sufficient facts to show a credible threat of prosecution for noncompliance with any of\nthese challenged provisions. At best, Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries are the second-order effects of\ngovernment regulation on the market for international banking services. But “consequence[s] of\nthe economics” of holding foreign assets are not, on their own, injuries in fact for the purpose of\ndemonstrating Article III standing. Warth, 422 U.S. at 506. Because the burden of establishing\nstanding falls squarely on the plaintiff, and because we are constrained to examine the district-\ncourt pleadings alone to determine whether standing existed at the time the complaint was filed,\nwe hold that no Plaintiff has standing to challenge FATCA.\n\n                           2. No Plaintiff Has Standing to Challenge the IGAs\n\n       Senator Paul challenges the constitutionality of the IGAs. Senator Paul alleges harm\nbecause he “has been denied the opportunity to exercise his constitutional right as a member of\nthe U.S. Senate to vote against the FATCA IGAs.” Id. at 13. But, as in Raines, any incursion\nupon Senator Paul’s political power is not a concrete injury like the loss of a private right, and\nany diminution in the Senate’s lawmaking power is not particularized but is rather a generalized\ngrievance.      Unlike in Coleman, in which the plaintiff-legislators’ votes would have been\nsufficient to defeat the contested legislation, Senator Paul has not pleaded that his vote on its\nown would have been sufficient to forestall the IGAs. Rather, Senator Paul has a remedy in the\nlegislature, which is to seek repeal or amendment of FATCA itself, under the aegis of which\nTreasury is executing the IGAs.9 Senator Paul therefore lacks legislative standing to challenge\nthe IGAs. None of the other Plaintiffs have alleged injuries that are traceable to the IGAs. The\nother Plaintiffs thus also lack standing to challenge the IGAs.\n\n                           3. No Plaintiff Has Standing to Challenge the FBAR\n\n       Although most Plaintiffs have alleged foreign account balances over $10,000 so as to be\nsubject to the FBAR requirement, no Plaintiff has alleged both an intent to violate the FBAR\nrequirement and a credible threat of the imposition of a failure-to-file penalty, as Driehaus\nwould require in order for there to be standing to bring a pre-enforcement challenge to the FBAR\n\n       9\n           We note that Senator Paul introduced a bill to repeal FATCA in April 2017. S. 869, 115th Cong. (2017).\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.            Page 27\n\n\npenalty. Other than Zell, no Plaintiff has alleged any intent to violate the FBAR requirement.\nZell has alleged that he “is not currently complying with” the FBAR. Amended Compl. 34. But\nZell has not alleged any facts that would show a credible threat of enforcement against him.\nEven if there were a credible threat of enforcement, the FBAR penalty is a discretionary penalty\nunder 31 U.S.C. § 5321(a)(5)(A). Zell has not alleged any facts that show that the Willfulness\nPenalty, as opposed to the lower ordinary penalty (which Plaintiffs do not challenge, see Part\nI.B.4, supra), would be imposed for Zell’s noncompliance with the FBAR.\n\n        Further, no Plaintiff has alleged any actual injury arising from the FBAR other than Lois\nKuettel. Lois has alleged that she would like to have a college-savings account placed in her\nname that her father is currently holding for her benefit in his own name, but that her father does\nnot want to transfer the account to her for fear that it will trigger an FBAR requirement for Lois.\nThis injury, however, is traceable to Daniel Kuettel’s personal choice not to transfer the account,\nand not to the FBAR.\n\n        In sum, none of the plaintiffs have standing to sue, and the district court was correct to\ndismiss their suit.\n\n                                                III\n\n                      The District Court Properly Denied Leave to Amend\n\n        We generally review a district court’s decision to deny leave to file an amended\ncomplaint, other than amendments as a matter of course under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1), for abuse\nof discretion. United States ex rel. Bledsoe v. Cmty. Health Sys., 342 F.3d 634, 644 (6th Cir.\n2003). When a district court bases its denial of a motion to amend “on the legal conclusion that\nthe proposed amendment would not survive a motion to dismiss,” however, we review the\ndistrict court’s decision de novo. Greenberg v. Life Ins. Co. of Va., 177 F.3d 507, 522 (6th Cir.\n1999). Here, even if Plaintiffs were granted leave to amend their complaint in order to bring\nclaims by Katerina Johnson, Lois Kuettel, and Richard Adams, and in order to plead additional\nfacts such as some of the Plaintiffs’ account balances, no plaintiff would have standing to bring\nany of the claims in the proposed amended complaint for the reasons set forth above. The\ndistrict court thoroughly reviewed all of the proposed new parties and proposed new claims in\n\f No. 16-3539                Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.               Page 28\n\n\nthe amended complaint, and the district court properly held that leave to amend would be futile.\nAccordingly, we affirm the ruling of the district court denying Plaintiff’s motion for leave to\namend.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n         FATCA imposes far-reaching reporting obligations on individuals and financial\ninstitutions, which, like many government regulations, undoubtedly exact monetary and other\ncosts of compliance. The IGAs, to be sure, are part of an unprecedented scheme of international\ntax enforcement. And the FBAR Willfulness Penalty, if it were to be imposed, is admittedly\nsteep: it could theoretically bring a $100,000 fine for failure to report a foreign account with a\nbalance of $10,000.01.\n\n         None of these considerations, however, help these Plaintiffs at this time to clear the initial\njurisdictional hurdle of standing.\n\n         Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court, and we DENY as moot\nDefendants’ motion to strike.\n\f",

Page 2\n\n\n                                       _________________\n\n                                            OPINION\n                                       _________________\n\n       BOGGS, Circuit Judge. In 2010, Congress passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance\nAct (FATCA), a law aimed at reducing tax evasion by United States taxpayers holding funds in\nforeign accounts. FATCA imposes account-reporting requirements (and hefty penalties for\nnoncompliance) on both individual taxpayers and foreign financial institutions (FFIs). FFIs are\nfurther required to deduct and withhold a “tax” equal to 30% of every payment made by the FFI\nto a noncompliant (or “recalcitrant”) account holder. To implement FATCA worldwide, the\nUnited States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nhave concluded intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), which facilitate FFIs’ disclosure of\nfinancial-account information to the United States government, with more than seventy\ncountries. Separately from FATCA and the IGAs, the Bank Secrecy Act imposes a foreign bank\naccount reporting (FBAR) requirement on Americans living abroad who have aggregate foreign-\naccount balances over $10,000; willful failure to file an FBAR invites a penalty of 50% of the\nvalue of the reportable accounts or $100,000, whichever is greater.\n\n       Plaintiffs—who include Senator Rand Paul and several individuals who claim to be\nsubject to FATCA and the FBAR—sought to enjoin the enforcement of FATCA, the IGAs, and\nthe FBAR, and they now appeal the dismissal of their lawsuit for lack of standing. For the\nreasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                                 I\n\n                                          A. The Parties\n\n       Plaintiffs’ original verified complaint asserts claims against three defendants: Treasury,\nwhich administers FATCA and the FBAR; the IRS (an office of Treasury that also administers\nFATCA and the FBAR); and the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(FinCEN), a Treasury Department bureau with administrative authority over the FBAR. Each of\nthe seven plaintiffs alleges a unique set of harms:\n\f No. 16-3539                  Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.       Page 3\n\n\n                                             Mark Crawford\n\n       Plaintiff Mark Crawford is an American citizen living in Albania with a residence in\nDayton, Ohio. Crawford owns Aksioner, a brokerage firm in Albania that is a partner of Saxo\nBank in Copenhagen. Crawford alleges injury because Saxo will not allow Aksioner to accept\nclients who are United States citizens “in part because the bank does not wish to assume the\nburdens that would be foisted on it by FATCA.” Crawford also claims that Aksioner—which he\nowns—denied Crawford’s own application for a brokerage account, and that Crawford has\nsuffered financial harm because FATCA is “forcing him to turn away prospective American\nclients living in Albania.”\n\n                                           Senator Rand Paul\n\n       Senator Rand Paul claims that he “has been denied the opportunity to exercise his\nconstitutional right as a member of the U.S. Senate to vote against the FATCA IGAs.” Senator\nPaul claims that he would vote against the IGAs if they were submitted to the Senate for advice\nand consent under Article II, Section 2, of the United States Constitution, or if they were\nsubmitted to the whole Congress for approval as “congressional-executive agreements.” Senator\nPaul does not otherwise challenge FATCA, and he does not in any way challenge the FBAR.\n\n                                             Roger Johnson\n\n       Plaintiff Roger Johnson is an American citizen living in Brno, Czech Republic. Johnson\nis married to Katerina Johnson, a Czech citizen with whom Johnson previously shared joint\nfinancial accounts before they separated their accounts to avoid subjecting Katerina’s account\ninformation to disclosure under FATCA.\n\n                                             Stephen J. Kish\n\n       Plaintiff Stephen J. Kish is a Canadian citizen living in Toronto. Kish was also an\nAmerican citizen at the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed, but he has since renounced his\nAmerican citizenship. Kish and his wife, a Canadian citizen, share a joint bank account at a\nCanadian bank. Kish alleges that “FATCA has at times caused some discord between” Kish and\nhis wife because Kish’s wife “strongly opposes the disclosure of her personal financial\n\f No. 16-3539                Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.            Page 4\n\n\ninformation from [the] joint bank account to the U.S. government.” Kish’s wife, however, is\nneither a plaintiff nor a proposed plaintiff in this litigation.\n\n                                             Daniel Kuettel\n\n        Plaintiff Daniel Kuettel is a Swiss citizen and former American citizen living in\nBremgarten, Switzerland. Kuettel and his wife—a citizen of Switzerland and the Philippines—\nhave a daughter (a citizen of the United States, the Philippines, and Switzerland) and a son (a\ncitizen of the Philippines and Switzerland), both minors. Kuettel alleges that he renounced his\ncitizenship in 2012 “because of difficulties caused by FATCA.” For instance, Kuettel alleges\nthat before renunciation, his efforts to refinance his mortgage with Swiss banks were\nunsuccessful but that he “was able to refinance his home with a Swiss bank shortly thereafter.”\nKuettel also alleges that he has a college-savings account for his daughter in his own name at a\nSwiss bank and wishes to transfer it to his daughter, but that he has refrained from doing so for\nfear that if he does, either he or his daughter or the account will be subject to the FBAR penalty\n“if the IRS determines that his daughter has ‘wilfully’ failed to file an FBAR.” Kuettel alleges\nthat his daughter is incapable of filing the FBAR or of renouncing her United States citizenship\nbecause “she is only ten years old and too young to shoulder such an obligation,” and Kuettel\ndoes not wish to file the FBAR on his daughter’s behalf as FinCEN would ordinarily require the\nparent of a minor child to do.\n\n                                          Donna-Lane Nelson\n\n        Plaintiff Donna-Lane Nelson is a Swiss citizen and former American citizen living in\nboth Geneva, Switzerland, and Argèles-sur-Mer, France. Nelson claims that she renounced her\ncitizenship when, after FATCA was enacted, her Swiss bank (UBS) “notified her that she would\nnot be able to open a new account if she ever closed her existing one[,] because she was an\nAmerican.” Nelson subsequently married an American citizen with whom she shares a joint\nbank account at BNP Paribas in France. Nelson alleges that she “has had her private financial\naccount information disclosed to the IRS and the Treasury Department despite the fact that she is\nnot a U.S. citizen,” although Plaintiffs’ pleadings provide no further insight as to the nature of\nthis alleged disclosure, such as who made it, when it was made, or what it contained. Nelson has\n\f No. 16-3539                  Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 5\n\n\nalso had to prove or explain to UBS, BNP Paribas, and Raiffeisen (another European bank) that\nshe is not a United States citizen.\n\n                                              L. Marc Zell\n\n       Plaintiff L. Marc Zell is an American and Israeli citizen living in Israel. Zell, an attorney,\nalleges that “[b]ecause of FATCA, [he] and his firm have been required by their Israeli banking\ninstitutions to complete IRS withholding forms . . . as a precondition for opening trust accounts\nfor both U.S. and non-U.S. persons and entities” (emphasis added). Zell alleges that the “Israeli\nbanking officials have stated that they will require such submissions regardless of whether the\nbeneficiary is a U.S. person . . . because the trustee is or may be a U.S. person,” and that, as a\nresult, “banks have required [him] and his firm to close the trust account in some cases, and in\nother instances the banks have refused to open the requested trust account.” Zell alleges that he\nholds in trust certain client securities that are required by Israeli financial regulations to be “held\nby a qualified Israeli financial institution,” but Zell’s Israeli financial institution has requested\nZell to transfer the securities elsewhere “because both he and the beneficiary in this instance are\nU.S. citizens.” Finally, Zell alleges that his non-United States clients have been required by\nIsraeli banks “to fill out the IRS forms even though they have no connection with the United\nStates,” and that “banking officials have stated that the mere fact a U.S. person trustee or his law\nfirm is acting as a fiduciary is reason enough to require non-U.S. person beneficiaries to” report\ntheir identities and assets to the United States. Zell alleges that in “a few such instances,” the\nclient-beneficiary has terminated the attorney-client relationship, “resulting in palpable financial\nloss” to Zell and his firm.\n\n                                      Proposed Additional Plaintiffs\n\n       In addition to these seven plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ Proposed Amended Complaint sought to\nadd three new plaintiffs: Plaintiff Johnson’s wife Katerina Johnson, Plaintiff Kuettel’s daughter\nLois Kuettel, and Plaintiff Nelson’s husband Richard Adams. The amended complaint also\nincludes statements, absent from the original complaint, that some of Plaintiffs’ bank balances\nexceeded the threshold amounts at which FATCA or FBAR requirements might apply, but the\namended complaint otherwise recites the same claims and substantially the same facts as the\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.              Page 6\n\n\noriginal complaint. Importantly, none of the original plaintiffs or proposed plaintiffs alleges that\nthey have faced direct consequences such as the imposition or threatened imposition of a\nfinancial penalty for noncompliance with FATCA, the IGAs, or the FBAR.\n\n                              B. FATCA, the IGAs, and the FBAR\n\n       Plaintiffs assert challenges against five sets of laws: (1) FATCA’s individual-reporting\nrequirements; (2) FATCA’s “FFI Penalty”; (3) FATCA’s “Passthru Penalty”; (4) the IGAs; and\n(5) the FBAR Willfulness Penalty.\n\n                          1. FATCA’s Individual-Reporting Requirements\n\n       FATCA requires United States taxpayers with “specified foreign financial assets” to file a\nspecial report with their annual tax returns that discloses the name and address of the financial\ninstitution that maintains each specified account; the name and address of any issuers of\nspecified stocks or securities; information necessary to identify other specified instruments,\ncontracts, or interests and their issuers; and the maximum value of each specified asset during the\ntaxable year. 26 U.S.C. § 6038D(b)–(c). The reporting requirement applies to any United States\ntaxpayer when the “aggregate value of all [specified] assets exceeds $50,000 (or such higher\ndollar amount as the secretary may prescribe).” § 6038D(a) (emphasis added). Notably, the\nSecretary of the Treasury has prescribed higher dollar amounts for many taxpayers depending on\ntheir marital status, maximum asset value during the tax year, and place of residence. The\nfollowing individual-reporting thresholds have been in place since at least 2012:\n\n                                                                                Asset Value at Any\n                                                       Asset Value on Last\n                                                                                Time During Tax\n                                                        Day of Tax Year\n                                                                                Year\nIf living in the United States\n  Unmarried; married filing separately                       $50,000                  $75,000\n  Married filing jointly                                    $100,000                 $150,000\nIf living outside the United States\n  Unmarried; married filing separately                      $200,000                 $300,000\n Married filing jointly                                     $400,000                 $600,000\n\f No. 16-3539                    Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                             Page 7\n\n\nSee 26 C.F.R. § 1.6038D-2(a); see also Treasury Insp. Gen. for Tax Admin., U.S. Dept. of\nTreasury, “The Internal Revenue Service Has Made Progress in Implementing the Foreign\nAccount Tax Compliance Act,” Fig. 1., Ref. No. 2015-30-085 (Sept. 23, 2015).\n\n         Plaintiffs’ pleadings below and principal brief on appeal acknowledge only the $50,000\nand $75,000 values applicable to single filers residing in the United States. See, e.g., Appellants’\nBr. 2. Plaintiffs’ reply brief obliquely acknowledges the $200,000/$300,000 threshold values\nthat would seem to apply to most of the Plaintiffs on account of their overseas residences, noting\nthat “the secretary has recently increased the triggering amount for individuals living abroad,”\nbut Plaintiffs argue that “the threshold could be lowered to the statutory minimum at any time,\nthus triggering reporting for Plaintiffs.” Reply Br. 7.\n\n         Failure to report carries a penalty of up to $10,000 per violation plus 40% of the amount\nof any underpaid tax “attributable to” the assets for which disclosure was required. 26 U.S.C.\n§§ 6038D(d) (“[S]uch person shall pay a penalty of . . . .”) (emphasis added), 6662(j)(3). No\npenalty is due, however, if failure to report is “due to reasonable cause and not due to willful\nneglect.” Id. § 6038D(g).\n\n         Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the statutory reporting requirement, 26 U.S.C. § 6038D; the\nregulation that implements the reporting requirement, 26 C.F.R. § 1.6038D-4(a)(5); a regulation\nthat requires disclosing the opening or closing of a specified foreign account, 26 C.F.R.\n§ 1.6038D-4(a)(6); and a regulation that requires disclosing “income, gain, loss, deduction, or\ncredit recognized . . . with respect to” specified assets, 26 C.F.R. § 1.6038D-4(a)(8).\n\n  2. FATCA’s Institutional-Reporting Requirements, the FFI Penalty, and the Passthru Penalty\n\n         FATCA also imposes an institutional-reporting requirement on FFIs,1 which an FFI can\nsatisfy in one of three ways as set forth in 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3). First, the\n\n\n         1\n             A “foreign financial institution” (FFI) is “any financial institution which is a foreign entity.” 26 U.S.C.\n§ 1471(d)(4). Financial institutions include any entity that “accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or\nsimilar business,” “holds financial assets for the account of others” “as a substantial portion of its business,” or “is\nengaged (or holding itself out as being engaged) primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in\nsecurities . . . , partnership interests, commodities . . . , or any interest” in the same. 26 U.S.C. § 1471(d)(5).\nFATCA thus reaches across the globe, although its extraterritorial reach is not directly at issue in this litigation, nor\nis it at issue at all in the present appeal, which concerns only the Plaintiffs’ standing to sue.\n\f No. 16-3539                   Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                        Page 8\n\n\nFFI may enter into an agreement with Treasury whereby the FFI agrees, among other things, to\ntake the following five actions:\n\n        (1) “to obtain such information regarding each holder of each account maintained by\n            such institution as is necessary to determine which (if any) of such accounts are\n            United States accounts”;2\n        (2) to make annual reports to Treasury providing details on United States accounts,\n            including the “name, address, and [Taxpayer Identification Number] of each account\n            holder which is a specified United States person and, in the case of any account\n            holder which is a United States owned foreign entity, the name, address, and\n            [Taxpayer Identification Number] of each substantial United States owner of such\n            entity”; the account number; the account balance or value; and “the gross receipts and\n            gross withdrawals or payments from the account”;\n        (3) “to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 30 percent of . . . any passthru payment3 which\n            is made by such institution to a recalcitrant account holder4 or another foreign\n            financial institution which does not meet the requirements of this subsection”—the\n            so-called Passthru Penalty;\n        (4) to attempt to obtain a waiver from each account holder of any foreign law that would\n            (but for such a waiver) prohibit the disclosure of the required information to the\n            United States; and\n        (5) to close the accounts of any account holders from which such a waiver “is not\n            obtained . . . within a reasonable period of time.” 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(1).\n\n\n        2\n          A “United States account” is “any financial account which is held by one or more specified United States\npersons or United States owned foreign entities,” subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. 26 U.S.C.\n§ 1471(d)(1)(A). United States persons include citizens and residents of the United States, domestic partnerships\nand corporations, estates other than foreign estates, and trusts subject to primary administrative supervision by a\ncourt of the United States where a United States person has authority to control “all substantial decisions” of the\ntrust. 26 U.S.C. § 7701.\n        3\n           A “passthru payment” is defined as “any withholdable payment or other payment to the extent attributable\nto a withholdable payment.” 26 U.S.C. § 1471(d)(7). Withholdable payments include “(i) any payment of interest\n(including any original issue discount), dividends, rents, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations,\nremunerations, emoluments, and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income, if such\npayment is from sources within the United States, and (ii) any gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of\nany property of a type which can produce interest or dividends from sources within the United States.” Id.\n§ 1473(1)(A). The “withholding agent” with respect to each withholdable payment is obligated to deduct and\nwithhold the 30% tax. Withholding agents include “all persons, in whatever capacity acting, having the control,\nreceipt, custody, disposal, or payment of any withholdable payment.” Id. § 1473(4).\n        4\n          “Recalcitrant account holder” means any account holder that fails to comply with an FFI’s “reasonable\nrequests” for information necessary to determine which accounts are United States accounts; fails to provide name,\naddress, Taxpayer Identification Number, and account-number information to an FFI for United States accounts; or\nfails, upon an FFI’s request, to waive the applicability of a foreign law that would (but for a valid and effective\nwaiver by the account holder) otherwise prohibit disclosure of such information. 26 U.S.C. § 1471(d)(6).\n\f No. 16-3539                 Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.           Page 9\n\n\n       Second, the FFI “may be treated by the Secretary as meeting the requirements of”\nFATCA if the FFI either “complies with such procedures as the Secretary may prescribe to\nensure that such institution does not maintain United States accounts” or “is a member of a class\nof institutions with respect to which the Secretary has determined that the application of\n[FATCA’s reporting requirement] is not necessary.” 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(2). As we discuss\nbelow, FFIs subject to the jurisdiction of countries that have signed IGAs with Treasury may be\ndeemed compliant under 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(2) by virtue of their (and their country’s)\ncompliance with an IGA.\n\n       Third, the FFI may “elect” to withhold a tax from payments sent to the FFI from\n“accounts held by recalcitrant account holders or foreign financial institutions which do not meet\nthe requirements of this subsection” rather than agreeing to withhold the 30% tax from the FFI’s\npayments to recalcitrant account holders or noncompliant FFIs. 26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(3).\n\n       If an FFI fails to meet FATCA’s institutional-reporting requirement in one of these three\nways, then the FFI is subject to having “a tax equal to 30 percent” deducted and withheld from\nall withholdable payments sent to the FFI. 26 U.S.C. § 1471(a). Plaintiffs assert and the\ngovernment does not dispute that this tax—the so-called “FFI Penalty”—applies to United\nStates-sourced income payable to the FFI as well as foreign-sourced income payable to the FFI\nfrom other FFIs. See 26 C.F.R. § 1.1471-2; Compl. 29; Appellees’ Br. 4.\n\n       In short, if an FFI is not subject to the jurisdiction of a country that has concluded an\nIGA, the FFI must either comply with FATCA (and withhold the Passthru Penalty from\npayments it makes to recalcitrant account holders and noncompliant FFIs) or elect to have a\n30% tax withheld from incoming payments from recalcitrant account holders or noncompliant\nFFIs; otherwise, the FFI becomes noncompliant itself and thus subject to the FFI Penalty of 30%\nof all withholdable payments5 it receives from any source whatsoever.\n\n       Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the enforcement of the reporting requirement, the withholding\nprovisions, the regulations implementing these provisions, and the IRS’s use of Form 8966,\n“FATCA Report,” on which FFIs make FATCA disclosures. Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin the\n\n       5\n           See n.3, supra.\n\f No. 16-3539                    Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.          Page 10\n\n\nenforcement of the Passthru Penalty, which is the 30% “tax”6 that FFIs deduct and withhold\nfrom payments to recalcitrant account holders or noncompliant FFIs under 26 U.S.C.\n§ 1471(b)(1)(D). See also 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.1471-4(a)(1), 1.1471-4T(b)(1).\n\n                                                   3. The IGAs\n\n       Treasury, on behalf of the United States, has reached agreements with dozens of foreign\ngovernments to “facilitate the implementation of FATCA.” 26 C.F.R. § 1.1471-1(b)(79). These\nintergovernmental agreements (IGAs) take two forms: “Model 1” IGAs and “Model 2” IGAs.\n\n       Under a Model 1 IGA, the foreign government agrees to collect the financial information\nthat FATCA would otherwise require FFIs to report, and the foreign government itself reports\nthat information directly to the IRS. Notably, the Model 1 IGA makes clear that as long as the\nforeign government “complies with its obligations under” the IGA, any FFI within that\ngovernment’s jurisdiction that also complies with its own obligations under the IGA (such as\nsending accountholder information to the foreign government) “shall be treated as complying\nwith” FATCA7 and is exempt from FATCA reporting, penalties, and withholding. See, e.g.,\nU.S. Dept. of Treasury FATCA Resource Center, Model 1A IGA Reciprocal, Preexisting TIEA\nor DTC, Art. 4, § 1, (Nov. 30, 2014), http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-\npolicy/treaties/Documents/FATCA-Reciprocal-Model-1A-Agreement-Preexisting-TIEA-or-\nDTC-11-30-14.pdf.\n\n       Treasury has signed Model 1 IGAs with Canada (in force June 27, 2014), Czech Republic\n(in force December 18, 2014), Israel (in force August 29, 2016), France (in force October 14,\n2014), and Denmark (in force September 30, 2015). Plaintiffs’ original complaint, in which they\nsought to enjoin the Canadian, Czech, and Israeli IGAs, was filed July 14, 2015; Plantiffs sought\nleave to file their proposed amended complaint, which would also enjoin the French and the\nDanish IGAs, on October 30, 2015. Neither complaint mentions that although all the above-\nmentioned Model 1 IGAs were signed on June 30, 2014, the Israeli IGA was not yet in force at\n\n\n       6\n           We decline to address whether the 30% deduction is a tax or a penalty.\n       7\n         The IGAs are the principal means by which an FFI may be treated as complying with FATCA under\n26 U.S.C. § 1471(b)(2), discussed above.\n\f No. 16-3539                Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.            Page 11\n\n\nthe time of filing either complaint.        U.S. Dept. of Treasury FATCA Resource Center,\nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-16-27.pdf.      Indeed, the Israeli Knesset did not approve\nregulations implementing FATCA until August 4, 2016. Nevertheless, Treasury has declared\nthat any foreign jurisdiction that signed an IGA before November 30, 2014, would be treated “as\nif [it had] an IGA in effect” and would thus be exempt from FATCA reporting, penalties, and\nwithholding—including penalties against recalcitrant account holders—“as long as the\njurisdiction is taking the steps necessary to bring the IGA into force within a reasonable period of\ntime.”       See IRS Announcement 2016-27, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-16-27.pdf; IRS\nAnnouncement 2013-43, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-43.pdf. One such announcement\nset December 31, 2016, as the date by which jurisdictions whose IGAs were not yet in force\nowed “a detailed explanation” to Treasury. See IRS Announcement 2016-27 at 2–3. The result\nof the Treasury notices and the pending IGA is that from the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed\nuntil well after the district-court record closed, neither FATCA nor any IGA had any legal effect\nin Israel.\n\n         Under a Model 2 IGA, the foreign government agrees to modify its laws to the extent\nnecessary to enable its FFIs to report their United States account information directly to the IRS.\nTreasury has signed a Model 2 IGA with Switzerland (in force June 2, 2014), in which the Swiss\ngovernment has agreed to “direct all Reporting Swiss Financial Institutions” to “register with the\nIRS” and comply with applicable FATCA provisions. Swiss IGA Art. 3 § 1. One provision of\nthe Swiss IGA, Article 5, is not yet in force because it requires that a separate “Protocol”—an\namendment to a bilateral tax treaty that was signed by the United States and Switzerland in\n2009—first come into force, but the United States Senate has not yet approved that Protocol,\nleaving Article 5 inoperative. Article 5 would authorize the United States to make “group\nrequests” to the Swiss Federal Department of Finance or its designee for aggregated reportable-\naccount information. Swiss IGA Art. 2 § 1; Art. 5. Despite the fact that Article 5 is inoperative,\nhowever, the Swiss Model 2 IGA, somewhat like the Model 1 IGAs, provides that Swiss FFIs\nthat register with the IRS and comply with an “FFI Agreement” (essentially, an agreement\nbetween an individual Swiss FFI and the United States government to report United States\naccount information) “shall be treated as complying with” FATCA and are thus exempt from any\nprovisions of FATCA beyond those incorporated into the IGA or FFI Agreement. Swiss IGA\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                 Page 12\n\n\nArt. 6. Swiss FFIs’ obligations are lighter under the IGA than under FATCA: for example, as\nlong as a Swiss FFI complies with the registration and reporting requirements in Article 3 of the\nIGA, it is not required to withhold the passthru tax from recalcitrant account holders or to close\nany account holders’ accounts. Swiss IGA Art. 7 § 1.\n\n        Plaintiffs seek to invalidate the Canadian, Czech, Israeli, French, Danish, and Swiss\nIGAs.\n\n                                 4. The FBAR Willfulness Penalty\n\n        The last set of laws at issue is the foreign-bank-account-reporting (FBAR) requirement of\nthe Bank Secrecy Act, which requires any United States person with “a financial interest in or\nsignature authority over at least one financial account located outside of the United States” to file\nFinCEN Form 114 (also referred to as the FBAR) with Treasury annually. Reporting is required\nfor accounts held during the previous calendar year if “the aggregate value of all foreign\nfinancial accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year reported.”               See\n31 U.S.C. § 5314; 31 C.F.R. §§ 1010.306(c), .350. The FBAR appears to have nothing to do\nwith FATCA or the IGAs other than that presumably most if not all individuals subject to\nFATCA’s reporting requirement are also required to file an FBAR, since the reporting threshold\nfor the FBAR is lower than any reporting threshold for FATCA.\n\n        Nevertheless,   Plaintiffs   challenge   the   FBAR’s     willful-failure-to-report    penalty\n(“Willfulness Penalty”), which provides that “[t]he Secretary of the Treasury may impose” a\npenalty equal to the greater of $100,000 or half the value in the reportable account(s) at the time\nof the violation. 31 U.S.C. § 5321(a)(5)(A), (C) (emphasis added). The ordinary penalty (absent\na showing of willfulness), which Plaintiffs do not challenge, is $10,000 per violation. Id.\n§ 5321(a)(5)(B)(i).     Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin the FBAR account-balance-reporting\nrequirement—that is, the requirement to complete FinCEN Form 114.\n\n                           C. Counts Enumerated in the Complaint\n\n        In both the original complaint and the proposed amended complaint, Plaintiffs brought\neight counts against Defendants. A brief summary of the counts is provided here as relevant\n\f No. 16-3539              Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.             Page 13\n\n\nbackground, although Plaintiffs need not demonstrate that they are likely to prevail as to any of\nthese counts in order to have standing to bring them.\n\n                   Counts 1 & 2: The IGAs Were Unconstitutionally Executed\n\n        Plaintiffs claim in Count 1 that the IGAs are “unconstitutional sole executive\nagreements” that exceed the scope of the President’s constitutional power because they are not\nauthorized by Congress through the ordinary legislative process. Compl. 37. Plaintiffs claim\nthat the only constitutionally permissible means by which the executive branch may make\ninternational agreements are by the Treaty Clause, an Act of Congress, a provision in an existing\ntreaty, or the President’s independent constitutional foreign-affairs power—which Plaintiffs\nclaim does not include the power to impose a tax or to create a tax-collection mechanism like the\nIGAs.\n\n        Alternatively, in Count 2, Plaintiffs claim that the IGAs are impermissible because they\nare “inconsistent with legislation enacted by Congress in the exercise of its constitutional\nauthority”—namely, FATCA—to the extent that they, among other things, allow FFIs to report\nto their national governments rather than to the IRS. Amended Compl. 49 (quoting State\nDepartment Foreign Affairs Manual). Plaintiffs thus claim that the IGAs “override” FATCA and\n“must be held unlawful and set aside” because “Treasury and the IRS have acted contrary to the\nPresident’s constitutional power” in entering into the IGAs.\n\n                 Count 3: The FATCA, IGA, and FBAR Reporting Requirements\n                              Violate the Equal Protection Clause\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that compared to the various data reported to the IRS about foreign\naccounts under FATCA, the IGAs, and the FBAR, “[t]he only financial information reported to\nthe IRS about domestic accounts is the amount of interest paid to the accounts during a calendar\nyear.” Plaintiffs thus claim that United States citizens living abroad are treated differently than\nUnited States citizens living in the United States, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\nEqual Protection Clause (as incorporated against the federal government through the Fifth\nAmendment Due Process Clause).

In Count 6, Plaintiffs\nlodge the same attack against the FBAR Willfulness Penalty.\n\n         Counts 7 & 8: The Institutional-Reporting Requirements of FATCA and the IGAs\n                     Violate Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment Right to Privacy\n\n         In Count 7, Plaintiffs claim that FATCA’s requirement that FFIs report account data to\nthe United States constitutes a warrantless search in violation of Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment\nprotection against unreasonable searches and seizures. In Count 8, Plaintiffs claim that the\nIGAs’ requirement that FFIs report account data either to their governments or to the United\nStates likewise violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\n                                     D. Procedural History\n\n         Plaintiffs filed their original complaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Ohio on July 14, 2015. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, which\nthe district court denied, holding that Plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits because\nthey lacked standing and, alternatively, because they had brought allegations that failed as a\nmatter of law. On October 30, 2015, Plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaint. The\ngovernment filed both a motion to dismiss and an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to\namend.\n\n         On April 26, 2016, the district court granted the government’s motion to dismiss for lack\nof standing, declined to reach the government’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and\ndenied Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend. The district court denied leave to amend only after\nconsidering the new plaintiffs and their new claims and after determining that even if leave to\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v.

This timely appeal followed.\n\n       In the interest of simplicity, we will discuss whether Plaintiffs have standing in light of\nthe facts pleaded in both the original complaint and the proposed amended complaint. For the\nreasons that follow, the district court rightly held that none of the plaintiffs had standing to sue,\nand that granting leave to amend would not cure the defect in standing.\n\n                                                 II\n\n                                    A.

An indirect harm is an injury caused to a plaintiff when\nthe defendant’s unlawful conduct harms a third party who in turn causes the plaintiff’s harm—\nunlike in third-party standing cases, a plaintiff claiming indirect harm is seeking to vindicate the\nplaintiff’s own rights and not a third party’s.

Plaintiffs rely heavily on Roe: they argue that the law challenged in Roe\ndirectly harmed abortionists, not women seeking abortions, but that the indirect harm to women\nseeking abortions was nevertheless fairly traceable to the law. Plaintiffs argue that in Roe, the\ndoctors had only two options (provide abortions and thus break the law, or comply with the law\nby declining to provide abortions); Plaintiffs argue that in this case, similarly, FFIs have only\n\f No. 16-3539                     Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                           Page 21\n\n\ntwo options: disregard FATCA and thus become subject to the 30% FFI Penalty, or comply with\nFATCA by refusing to do business with certain United States persons.\n\n         But Plaintiffs’ analogy overlooks a third option available here and not in Roe: FFIs may\ncomply with FATCA and do business with United States persons—without imposing additional\nrequirements on their clients beyond what FATCA and the IGAs themselves require.8 As we\nwill discuss, several of Plaintiffs’ alleged harms arise not from FFIs’ acting under the command\nof FATCA or an IGA, but rather from the FFIs’ voluntary choice to go above and beyond\nFATCA and the IGAs. FFIs may do so, for example, by gathering FATCA-compliance-related\ninformation from non-United States persons, or by choosing not to do business with certain\nindividuals, whether to protect their own interests in FATCA compliance or for some other\nreason. See, e.g., Amended Compl. 12 (“[R]ather than reporting information about U.S. clients,\nSaxo Bank is turning away U.S. citizens like Mark.”). And although an injury “produced by” a\ndefendant’s “determinative or coercive effect” upon a third party (such as the injury of inability\nto obtain an abortion, produced by the determinative effect of the challenged law in Roe upon\nabortionists) may suffice for standing, an injury that results from the third party’s voluntary and\nindependent actions or omissions does not.

Redressability\n\n         Finally, a plaintiff must also plead facts sufficient to establish that the court is capable of\nproviding relief that would redress the alleged injury. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561–62.\n\n\n\n         8\n           Plaintiffs’ Roe analogy also fails when individual account holders are compared to the plaintiffs in Roe:\nthe account holders’ options are not “close your account or pay the penalty,” but rather “close your account, pay the\npenalty, or keep your account open while filing the required paperwork to do so.” This is unlike Roe where a\nwoman seeking an abortion that was not otherwise permitted had no “third option”: the only options were to seek an\nillicit abortion or to decline to have the abortion in the first place. A similar analogy could be drawn to highway-\nspeed laws: a motorist wishing to travel quickly, perhaps to transport perishable goods or to visit an ill relative, has\nonly the option to speed (and risk a traffic citation) or to comply with the law (and risk having spoiled goods or\nmissing the death of a relative). In such a situation, the motorist might well be able to argue that the injury of having\nspoiled goods or missing the death of the relative was fairly traceable to the speed-limit law. But this situation\nwould not be like the Plaintiffs’ situation here—rather, it would be analogous to the Plaintiffs’ situation here if the\nmotorist had a third option of speeding upon condition of filing paperwork with the state attesting to the reasons why\nspeeding is necessary. Perhaps if that paperwork itself were difficult to file, an injury could arise from the time and\ntrouble spent filing it—but, notably, Plaintiffs stated at oral argument that they do not assert that the time and trouble\nof filing FATCA paperwork is itself an injury for standing purposes.\n\f No. 16-3539              Crawford, et al. v.

No Plaintiff Has Standing to Challenge FATCA\n\n       No Plaintiff has standing to challenge FATCA’s individual-reporting requirements or the\nPassthru Penalty because no Plaintiff (or proposed Plaintiff) has alleged either an actual injury\nthat is fairly traceable to FATCA or an imminent threat of prosecution from noncompliance with\nFATCA.\n\n       First, no Plaintiff has alleged any actual enforcement of FATCA such as a demand for\ncompliance with the individual-reporting requirement, the imposition of a penalty for\nnoncompliance, or an FFI’s deduction of the Passthru Penalty from a payment to or from a\nforeign account.\n\n       Second, no Plaintiff can satisfy the Driehaus test for standing to bring a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to FATCA because no Plaintiff claims to hold enough foreign assets to be subject to\nthe individual-reporting requirement, and, as a result, no Plaintiff can claim that there is a\n“credible threat” of either prosecution for failing to comply with FATCA or imposition of a\nPassthru Penalty by an FFI. All but two of the Plaintiffs either fail to state the value of their\nforeign assets altogether or allege only that they have foreign accounts with an aggregate value\n“greater than $10,000”—but FATCA’s individual-reporting requirement applies only to\nindividuals with at least $50,000 worth of assets held in foreign accounts, with significantly\nhigher thresholds in some cases. See, e.g., Amended Compl. 12, 19, 21, 28, 30, 34.\n\n       The two exceptions are Johnson and Zell. Johnson has alleged that “[t]he aggregate\nvalue of [his] foreign accounts has been greater than $75,000 in 2014 and 2015[,] which subjects\nhim to both FATCA individual reporting and FBAR reporting.” Id. at 16. But Johnson lives\noutside the United States and would thus have to hold foreign accounts with an aggregate value\nin excess of $200,000 to be subject to the individual-reporting requirement. That Treasury might\nsomeday lower the threshold from $200,000 to $50,000 (the statutory minimum) or $75,000 or\nany other level does not change the fact that, now and at the time Plaintiffs filed suit, Johnson is\nnot subject to FATCA. Nor is it of any consequence that Johnson’s foreign banks may be\nsubject to FATCA’s institutional-reporting requirement on account of Johnson’s ownership of\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.               Page 24\n\n\naccounts exceeding $75,000 in value.         Johnson cannot challenge the individual-reporting\nrequirement or the Passthru Penalty without showing that Johnson himself is subject to those\nprovisions, and based on the facts as stated in Plaintiffs’ pleadings, Johnson is not.\n\n       Further, Johnson—like all Plaintiffs—lacks standing to challenge FATCA’s FFI Penalty\n(the penalty imposed upon financial institutions for their noncompliance with FATCA) because\nsuch a challenge would require either that the foreign banks themselves bring suit or that\nPlaintiffs rely on third-party standing, and Plaintiffs have made clear that they do not.\n\n       As for Zell, he alleges that he “had signatory authority over accounts with an aggregate\nyear-end balance of greater than $200,000 in 2014, which would subject him to FATCA\nindividual reporting.” Id. at 34 (emphasis added). But, although the Israeli IGA imposes a\nreporting requirement for trust accounts like Zell’s, FATCA itself does not require reporting\nwhere, as here, the trust accounts are held entirely for the benefit of non-United States persons.\nAnd although the Israeli IGA appears as of August 2016 to be in force in Israel, it was not in\nforce prior to then.     Zell could not have been subject to FATCA’s individual-reporting\nrequirement, either at the time Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed or at the time Plaintiffs sought\nleave to amend their complaint, based either on Zell’s own accounts (for which he alleges only\nan aggregate value exceeding $10,000) or on Zell’s “signatory authority” over his clients’ trust\naccounts, because only the Israeli IGA, not FATCA itself, required (or requires) reporting of\naccounts based on signatory authority, and the Israeli IGA was not in effect when Plaintiffs filed\nor sought to amend their complaint.\n\n       Finally, some Plaintiffs allege other harms arising from FATCA apart from its individual-\nreporting requirement or its Passthru Penalty. But none of these alleged harms are injuries that\nare fairly traceable to FATCA.        Crawford alleges that Saxo Bank’s decision not to allow\nCrawford (or Aksioner, Crawford’s brokerage firm) to accept United States clients, is an injury;\neven if it is, however, it is not fairly traceable to FATCA but rather, as in Allen and Ammex, to\nSaxo Bank’s own independent actions. The Johnsons’ decision to separate their own assets to\navoid disclosing Katerina Johnson’s financial affairs to the United States government when there\nis no allegation that FATCA has actually compelled any such disclosure, similarly, is traceable to\nthe Johnsons’ own independent actions, not to FATCA.\n\f No. 16-3539                Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                Page 25\n\n\n       Nelson alleges that she has “had her private financial account information disclosed to\nthe IRS and the Treasury Department despite the fact that she is not a U.S. citizen.” Amended\nCompl. 28. But Nelson has stated no facts whatsoever indicating that her account information\nwas disclosed because of FATCA—and thus any injury resulting from this disclosure cannot\nfairly be traced to FATCA.\n\n       In Plaintiffs’ complaint, Adams and Zell have alleged that they have had difficulty\nobtaining banking services from foreign banks. Zell specifically alleges that he has been told to\nmove securities out of an Israeli bank and that he has been informed that his non-United States\nclients are required to complete IRS forms at the request of Israeli banks. But, again, a foreign\nbank’s choice either not to do business with Adams or Zell, or (as in Zell’s case) to require Zell’s\nnon-United States clients to make financial or other disclosures even though these clients are not\nsubject to FATCA, is a choice voluntarily made by the bank and is not fairly traceable to\nFATCA. And the resulting choice of any of Zell’s clients not to do business with Zell is fairly\ntraceable to the clients or perhaps to the Israeli banks, but is not fairly traceable to FATCA.\nLikewise with Kuettel, who alleges that he had difficulty refinancing his mortgage until after he\nrenounced his American citizenship: such difficulty cannot serve as the basis for standing\nbecause it is, at best, past injury that is insufficient to warrant injunctive relief (it is past injury\nbecause Kuettel has renounced his American citizenship and no longer claims to have difficulty\nrefinancing his mortgage), and, in any event, it is traceable only to the foreign banks and not to\nFATCA because nothing in FATCA prevented the foreign banks from refinancing Kuettel’s\nmortgage.\n\n       Several plaintiffs allege injuries that are not concrete. Kish, for example, alleges that\n“FATCA has at times caused some discord between” him and his wife. Id. at 19. But marital\ndiscord, particularized though it may be, is not the sort of concrete injury that can give rise to\nstanding. Neither is Crawford or Johnson’s discomfort with FATCA’s reporting requirements,\nor Nelson’s “resent[ment],” id. at 28, at having to prove to European banks that she is no longer\na United States citizen in order to obtain banking services.\n\n       In sum, no Plaintiff has standing to challenge FATCA’s individual-reporting\nrequirements, the Passthru Penalty, or the FFI Penalty, because no Plaintiff has suffered direct\n\f No. 16-3539                   Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.                       Page 26\n\n\nharm that is fairly traceable to any of these challenged provisions, and because no Plaintiff has\nalleged sufficient facts to show a credible threat of prosecution for noncompliance with any of\nthese challenged provisions. At best, Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries are the second-order effects of\ngovernment regulation on the market for international banking services. But “consequence[s] of\nthe economics” of holding foreign assets are not, on their own, injuries in fact for the purpose of\ndemonstrating Article III standing. Warth, 422 U.S. at 506. Because the burden of establishing\nstanding falls squarely on the plaintiff, and because we are constrained to examine the district-\ncourt pleadings alone to determine whether standing existed at the time the complaint was filed,\nwe hold that no Plaintiff has standing to challenge FATCA.\n\n                           2. No Plaintiff Has Standing to Challenge the IGAs\n\n       Senator Paul challenges the constitutionality of the IGAs. Senator Paul alleges harm\nbecause he “has been denied the opportunity to exercise his constitutional right as a member of\nthe U.S. Senate to vote against the FATCA IGAs.” Id. at 13. But, as in Raines, any incursion\nupon Senator Paul’s political power is not a concrete injury like the loss of a private right, and\nany diminution in the Senate’s lawmaking power is not particularized but is rather a generalized\ngrievance.      Unlike in Coleman, in which the plaintiff-legislators’ votes would have been\nsufficient to defeat the contested legislation, Senator Paul has not pleaded that his vote on its\nown would have been sufficient to forestall the IGAs. Rather, Senator Paul has a remedy in the\nlegislature, which is to seek repeal or amendment of FATCA itself, under the aegis of which\nTreasury is executing the IGAs.9 Senator Paul therefore lacks legislative standing to challenge\nthe IGAs. None of the other Plaintiffs have alleged injuries that are traceable to the IGAs. The\nother Plaintiffs thus also lack standing to challenge the IGAs.\n\n                           3. No Plaintiff Has Standing to Challenge the FBAR\n\n       Although most Plaintiffs have alleged foreign account balances over $10,000 so as to be\nsubject to the FBAR requirement, no Plaintiff has alleged both an intent to violate the FBAR\nrequirement and a credible threat of the imposition of a failure-to-file penalty, as Driehaus\nwould require in order for there to be standing to bring a pre-enforcement challenge to the FBAR\n\n       9\n           We note that Senator Paul introduced a bill to repeal FATCA in April 2017. S. 869, 115th Cong. (2017).\n\f No. 16-3539               Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.            Page 27\n\n\npenalty. Other than Zell, no Plaintiff has alleged any intent to violate the FBAR requirement.\nZell has alleged that he “is not currently complying with” the FBAR. Amended Compl. 34. But\nZell has not alleged any facts that would show a credible threat of enforcement against him.\nEven if there were a credible threat of enforcement, the FBAR penalty is a discretionary penalty\nunder 31 U.S.C. § 5321(a)(5)(A). Zell has not alleged any facts that show that the Willfulness\nPenalty, as opposed to the lower ordinary penalty (which Plaintiffs do not challenge, see Part\nI.B.4, supra), would be imposed for Zell’s noncompliance with the FBAR.\n\n        Further, no Plaintiff has alleged any actual injury arising from the FBAR other than Lois\nKuettel. Lois has alleged that she would like to have a college-savings account placed in her\nname that her father is currently holding for her benefit in his own name, but that her father does\nnot want to transfer the account to her for fear that it will trigger an FBAR requirement for Lois.\nThis injury, however, is traceable to Daniel Kuettel’s personal choice not to transfer the account,\nand not to the FBAR.\n\n        In sum, none of the plaintiffs have standing to sue, and the district court was correct to\ndismiss their suit.\n\n                                                III\n\n                      The District Court Properly Denied Leave to Amend\n\n        We generally review a district court’s decision to deny leave to file an amended\ncomplaint, other than amendments as a matter of course under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1), for abuse\nof discretion. United States ex rel. Bledsoe v. Cmty. Health Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783447\"><a href=\"/opinion/783447/united-states-of-america-ex-rel-sean-bledsoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644 (6th Cir.\n2003). When a district court bases its denial of a motion to amend “on the legal conclusion that\nthe proposed amendment would not survive a motion to dismiss,” however, we review the\ndistrict court’s decision de novo. Greenberg v. Life Ins. Co. of Va., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764168\"><a href=\"/opinion/764168/peggy-greenberg-and-pamela-rossmann-individually-and-on-behalf-of-others/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (6th Cir.\n1999). Here, even if Plaintiffs were granted leave to amend their complaint in order to bring\nclaims by Katerina Johnson, Lois Kuettel, and Richard Adams, and in order to plead additional\nfacts such as some of the Plaintiffs’ account balances, no plaintiff would have standing to bring\nany of the claims in the proposed amended complaint for the reasons set forth above. The\ndistrict court thoroughly reviewed all of the proposed new parties and proposed new claims in\n\f No. 16-3539                Crawford, et al. v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, et al.               Page 28\n\n\nthe amended complaint, and the district court properly held that leave to amend would be futile.\nAccordingly, we affirm the ruling of the district court denying Plaintiff’s motion for leave to\namend.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n         FATCA imposes far-reaching reporting obligations on individuals and financial\ninstitutions, which, like many government regulations, undoubtedly exact monetary and other\ncosts of compliance. The IGAs, to be sure, are part of an unprecedented scheme of international\ntax enforcement. And the FBAR Willfulness Penalty, if it were to be imposed, is admittedly\nsteep: it could theoretically bring a $100,000 fine for failure to report a foreign account with a\nbalance of $10,000.01.\n\n         None of these considerations, however, help these Plaintiffs at this time to clear the initial\njurisdictional hurdle of standing.\n\n         Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court, and we DENY as moot\nDefendants’ motion to strike.\n\f</pre>",
