Technicians keep the company van at their homes overnight. Sears pays for\n\nall commuting expenses related to the van, including gas, maintenance, and\n\ninsurance. Technicians participating in the HDP are not paid for the first thirty-\n\nfive minutes of their morning and evening commutes, that is, they are not paid for\n\nthe first thirty-five minutes of the travel to the location of the first customer of the\n\nday, nor for the first thirty-five minutes of the trip to the technician’s home from\n\nthe last service call of the day. Technicians are compensated for time spent\n\ncommuting from the first and last service calls in excess of thirty-five minutes,\n\n\n\n            5\n       See Home Dispatch Implementation, Exh C. to Chambers’ Response, at SC05615,\nSC05686.\n           6\n          Deposition of Joseph Torre (“Torre Deposition”) [Doc. # 44-14], at 29-30.

Thus, assuming that a technician’s travel to the first assignment of the\n\nday does not exceed thirty-five minutes, the technician’s compensable work day\n\nbegins when he arrives at the first customer’s location. Similarly, assuming that\n\nthe commute from the last stop of the day home does not exceed thirty-five\n\nminutes, his compensable work day ends when he finishes his activities at the last\n\ncustomer’s location.\n\n            Not all Sears technicians participate in the HDP.7 Those that do not\n\nparticipate also use company vans to complete their service calls, but report every\n\nday to an office or alternative location where the company van is parked\n\novernight. These technicians commute each day to the office or alternative\n\nlocation to pick up the van, and then proceed to the first customer’s home. Non-\n\nHDP technicians are not paid for their commutes to and from the parking\n\nlocations. Non-HDP technicians’ compensable day begins when they pick up the\n\nvans and ends when they return the vans to the parking location at the end of the\n\nday.\n\n            Both Chambers and Werchan participated in the HDP.\n\n            A technician’s participation in the HDP is governed by instructions and\n\nprocedures set forth in a manual called the SST Help System Manual (“Help\n\n\n            7\n        A Sears representative estimated that over 90 percent of its technicians participate\nin the HDP.

HDP—Service Route/Workday\n\n            As noted, Sears technicians are compensated for time spent traveling\n\nbetween service calls during the workday, as well as for all time spent repairing\n\nappliances and other work-related activities during the workday.\n\n            Technicians who work longer than five and a half hours in a work day are\n\nrequired to take a thirty minute unpaid lunch break each day. Technicians are\n\nresponsible for logging their time on the SST for each service call, and for\n\nclocking in and out for the lunch break.\n\n                        3.          HDP—End of Route Activities\n\n            After completing the last service call of the day, the technician makes an\n\nentry on the SST signaling that the last call is completed. The SST prompts the\n\ntechnician to print out final reports for the day.21 Prior to beginning the commute\n\nhome, and while still on the clock, the technician is to engage in “winding down”\n\nactivities such as completing paperwork, putting funds from the day’s calls in\n\n\n\n\n            20\n                 Sears’ Chambers Motion, at 9.\n            21\n        Torre Deposition [Doc. # 44-14], at 94-96; SST Help Manual [Doc. # 44-11], at\nSC2635-366.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        10\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 11   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nenvelopes and documenting parts usage.22 “[I]f time permits, [the technician]\n\ntakes care of any housekeeping in the van, including restocking and reordering\n\nparts.”23 The technician then ends the day’s route by entering the van’s mileage\n\nbefore driving home.24 Upon arriving home, the technician clicks “end day” on\n\nthe SST to allow for the calculation of the portion of the evening commute, if any,\n\nthat will be paid by Sears. Technicians are paid from the time they arrive at the\n\nfirst service call and enter that they are “starting the route” until they finish the last\n\nservice call and enter the van’s mileage, with the exception of lunch breaks.25 The\n\nSST automatically makes any adjustments to technician pay based upon commutes\n\nin excess of thirty-five minutes.26\n\n                        4.          HDP—Other Activities\n\n            Technicians receive by UPS packages “truck stock replenishment parts” at\n\ntheir homes. Under the HDP, the frequency of these deliveries varies from daily\n\nto once a week depending on usage. Technicians are directed to place the boxes\n\n\n\n            22\n        Torre Deposition [Doc. # 44-14], at 94-96; SST Help Manual [Doc. # 44-11], at\nSC2635-36.\n            23\n         Cartia Affidavit, ¶ 26; see also Dorenkamp Deposition, at 185-186; SST Help Manual\n[Doc. # 44-11], at SC2635-36.\n           24\n          Cartia Affidavit, ¶ 26; Dorenkamp Deposition, at 185-186; SST Help Manual [Doc.\n# 44-11], at SC2635-36.\n            25\n                 Cartia Affidavit, ¶ 28; SST Help Manual [Doc. # 44-11], at SC2659-60.\n            26\n                 Cartia Affidavit, ¶ 28; SST Help Manual [Doc. # 44-11], at SC2659-60.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        11\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 12   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nof parts, unopened, into the van at a time of their choosing. The parts are not to be\n\nsorted and placed in the appropriate bins until sometime during working hours.27\n\n            Technicians are also instructed to perform other tasks, such as depositing\n\ncustomer payments, mailing cash envelopes, turning over credit-card-receipt\n\nenvelopes to management, returning unused parts, disposing of trash, or picking\n\nup uniforms or large parts during working hours or at a regularly scheduled\n\nmeeting at the office.28 Technicians are directed to inform their managers when\n\ntheir van needs service. The manager then schedules time into the technician’s\n\npaid working day for the service.29\n\n            B.          Plaintiffs’ Claims\n\n            Both Plaintiff Chambers and Plaintiff Werchan allege that under the HDP,\n\nthey were required on a daily basis to perform compensable work without being\n\npaid. Accordingly, both Plaintiffs allege that Sears has failed to pay overtime\n\ncompensation in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.\n\n(“FLSA”).

Sears has moved for summary judgment on all claims against both\n\nPlaintiffs. Because Sears’ Motions for Summary Judgment are potentially\n\ndispositive of this dispute, the Court address those Motions first.\n\nII.         SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n\n            Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates the entry of\n\nsummary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a\n\nparty who fails to make a sufficient showing of the existence of an element\n\nessential to the party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden at trial.\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37\n\nF.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc); see also Baton Rouge Oil and Chem.\n\nWorkers Union v. ExxonMobil Corp., 289 F.3d 373, 375 (5th Cir. 2002).\n\nSummary judgment “should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and\n\ndisclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue\n\nas to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322–23; Weaver v. CCA Indus.,\n\nInc., 529 F.3d 335, 339 (5th Cir. 2008).\n\n            For summary judgment, the initial burden falls on the movant to identify\n\nareas essential to the non-movant’s claim in which there is an “absence of a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.” Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co. v. Reyna, 401 F.3d 347, 349\n\n(5th Cir. 2005). The moving party, however, need not negate the elements of the\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        13\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 14   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nnon-movant’s case. See Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th\n\nCir. 2005). The moving party may meet its burden by pointing out “‘the absence\n\nof evidence supporting the nonmoving party’s case.’” Duffy v. Leading Edge\n\nProducts, Inc., 44 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir. 1995) (quoting Skotak v. Tenneco\n\nResins, Inc., 953 F.2d 909, 913 (5th Cir. 1992)).\n\n            If the moving party meets its initial burden, the non-movant must go beyond\n\nthe pleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact for trial. Littlefield v. Forney Indep. Sch. Dist., 268 F.3d 275, 282\n\n(5th Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted). “An issue is material if its resolution\n\ncould affect the outcome of the action. A dispute as to a material fact is genuine if\n\nthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\n\nnonmoving party.” DIRECT TV Inc. v. Robson, 420 F.3d 532, 536 (5th Cir. 2006)\n\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n            In deciding whether a genuine and material fact issue has been created, the\n\ncourt reviews the facts and inferences to be drawn from them in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Reaves Brokerage Co. v. Sunbelt Fruit &\n\nVegetable Co., 336 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir. 2003). A genuine issue of material fact\n\nexists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for\n\nthe non-movant. Tamez v. Manthey, 589 F.3d 764, 769 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).                     The non-movant’s\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        14\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 15   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nburden is not met by mere reliance on the allegations or denials in the non-\n\nmovant’s pleadings. See Diamond Offshore Co. v. A&B Builders, Inc., 302 F.3d\n\n531, 545 n.13 (5th Cir. 2002). Likewise, “conclusory allegations” or\n\n“unsubstantiated assertions” do not meet the non-movant’s burden. Delta & Pine\n\nLand Co. v. Nationwide Agribusiness Ins. Co., 530 F.3d 395, 399 (5th Cir. 2008).\n\nInstead, the nonmoving party must present specific facts which show “the\n\nexistence of a genuine issue concerning every essential component of its case.”\n\nAm. Eagle Airlines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, Int’l, 343 F.3d 401, 405 (5th Cir.\n\n2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In the absence of any\n\nproof, the court will not assume that the non-movant could or would prove the\n\nnecessary facts. Little, 37 F.3d at 1075 (citing Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497\n\nU.S. 871, 888 (1990)).\n\n            The Court may make no credibility determinations or weigh any evidence,\n\nand must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not\n\nrequired to believe. See Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d 219, 229 (5th\n\nCir. 2010) (citing Reaves Brokerage Co., 336 F.3d at 412-413). The Court is not\n\nrequired to accept the nonmovant’s conclusory allegations, speculation, and\n\nunsubstantiated assertions which are either entirely unsupported, or supported by a\n\nmere scintilla of evidence. Id. (citing Reaves Brokerage, 336 F.3d at 413).\n\nAffidavits cannot preclude summary judgment unless they contain competent and\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        15\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 16   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\notherwise admissible evidence.

A party’s self-serving and\n\nunsupported statement in an affidavit will not defeat summary judgment where the\n\nevidence in the record is to the contrary. See In re Hinsley, 201 F.3d 638, 643 (5th\n\nCir. 2000) (“A party's self-serving and unsupported claim that she lacked the\n\nrequisite intent is not sufficient to defeat summary judgment where the evidence\n\notherwise supports a finding of fraud.” (citation omitted)).\n\n            Finally, “[w]hen evidence exists in the summary judgment record but the\n\nnonmovant fails even to refer to it in the response to the motion for summary\n\njudgment, that evidence is not properly before the district court.” Malacara v.\n\nGarber, 353 F.3d 393, 405 (5th Cir. 2003). “Rule 56 does not impose upon the\n\ndistrict court a duty to sift through the record in search of evidence to support a\n\nparty’s opposition to summary judgment.” See id (internal citations and\n\nquotations omitted); see also de la O v. Hous’g Auth. of El Paso, 417 F.3d 495,\n\n501 (5th Cir. 2005) (“Judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in\n\nbriefs.”) (quoting United States v. Dunkel, 927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir. 1991)).\n\nFurther, the Court has no obligation to raise and analyze a party’s position in the\n\nabsence of that party’s meaningfully briefing the point. Cf. United States v.\n\n\n\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        16\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 17   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nGriffith, 522 F.3d 607, 610 (5th Cir. 2008) (“It is a well-worn principle that the\n\nfailure to raise an issue on appeal constitutes waiver of that argument”).\n\nIII.        ANALYSIS\n\n            A.          Plaintiffs’ Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) Claims\n\n                        1.          Applicable Law\n\n            Plaintiffs allege that they have been denied overtime compensation in\n\nviolation of the FLSA, which provides that “no employer shall employ any of his\n\nemployees . . . for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee\n\nreceives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified\n\nat a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is\n\nemployed.” 29 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1). An employee bringing an FLSA action for\n\nunpaid overtime compensation “must first demonstrate that she has performed\n\nwork for which she alleges she was not compensated.” Harvill v. Westward\n\nCommc'ns, L.L.C., 433 F.3d 428, 441 (5th Cir. 2005).\n\n            Neither “work” nor “workweek” is defined by the statute. IDP, Inc. v.\n\nAlvarez, 546 U.S. 21, 25 (2005). The Supreme Court’s “early cases defined those\n\nterms broadly.” Id. (citing, inter alia, Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda\n\nLocal No. 123, 321 U.S. 590, 598 (1944) (defining “work or employment” as\n\n“physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not) controlled or required\n\n\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        17\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 18   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nby the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the\n\nemployer and his business”), Armour & Co. v. Wantock, 323 U.S. 126, 133 (1944)\n\n(clarifying that “exertion” was not necessary to establish “work” under the FLSA\n\nbecause “an employer, if he chooses, may hire a man to do nothing, or to do\n\nnothing but wait for something to happen”)). Thus, in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens\n\nPottery Co., the Supreme Court held that time spent by employees walking from\n\ntime clocks near a factory entrance gate to their workstations must be considered\n\npart of the workweek. 328 U.S. 680, 691-92 (1946).\n\n            One year after the Supreme Court’s decision in Anderson, Congress, finding\n\nthat the judiciary’s interpretations of the FLSA had superseded “long-established\n\ncustoms, practices, and contracts between employers and employees, thereby\n\ncreating wholly unexpected liabilities,” amended the FLSA by passing the Portal-\n\nto-Portal Act. Alvarez, 546 U.S. at 26 (citing 61 Stat. 84). The Portal-to-Portal\n\nAct narrows the scope of compensable activities by excepting two categories of\n\nactivities that had been compensable under prior Supreme Court precedent. Id.; 29\n\nU.S.C. § 254(a). Under the Portal-to-Portal Act, employers are not liable under\n\nthe FLSA for failing to compensate employees for:\n\n            (1)         walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of\n                        performance of the principal activity or activities which such\n                        employee is employed to perform, and\n\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        18\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 19   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            (2)         activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said\n                        principal activity or activities,\n\n            which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at\n            which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any\n            particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or\n            activities.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 254(a); Alvarez, 546 U.S. at 27.\n\n            “Principal activity is not defined by the statute. The Fifth Circuit\n\n“traditionally has construed the term ‘principal activity’ to include activities\n\n‘performed as part of the regular work of the employees in the ordinary course of\n\nbusiness . . . [the] work is necessary to the business and is performed by the\n\nemployees, primarily for the benefit of the employer. . . .” Vega v. Gasper, 36\n\nF.3d 417, 424 (5th Cir. 1994) (citing Dunlop v. City Elect., Inc., 527 F.2d 394, 401\n\n(5th Cir. 1976). The Supreme Court has held that any activity that is “integral and\n\nindispensable” to a compensable “principal activity” is itself a compensable\n\n“principal activity” for purposes of the Portal-to-Portal Act. Alvarez, 546 U.S. at\n\n37; Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U.S. 247, 252-53 (1956).\n\n            Congress amended the Portal-to-Portal Act in 1996 with the passage of the\n\nEmployment Commute Flexibility Act (“ECFA”), which clarifies the applicability\n\nof the Portal-to-Portal Act to the payment of wages to employees who use\n\nemployer-provided vehicles.

It is clear that an\n\nemployee’s ordinary commute to and from work is generally non-compensable\n\nunder the Portal-to-Portal Act.\n\n            As noted, Congress passed the ECFA to clarify that an employee’s commute\n\nin a company car is not compensable if the two statutory conditions are met.\n\nPlaintiffs do not contest that they participated in the HDP subject to an agreement,\n\nand thus the second condition — that the employee’s use of the vehicle be subject\n\nto an agreement with the employer — is met. Plaintiffs focus on the first\n\ncondition and contend that the HDP fails to meet the ECFA criteria because it\n\nrequires travel outside the “normal commuting area.” Plaintiffs also argue that\n\nvarious conditions placed on the employee’s use of the van take the program\n\noutside the scope of non-compensability intended by Congress in passing the\n\nECFA.\n\n                                    a.           “Normal Commuting Area”\n\n            For travel to meet the requirements of the ECFA, it must be “within the\n\nnormal commuting area for the employer’s business or establishment.” 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 254(a). Plaintiffs contend that under a plain language analysis, the normal\n\ncommuting area must be defined by distance, not as a function of time. Plaintiffs\n\nurge that defining commute by time is problematic, first, because the commuting\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932         22\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 23   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\narea may change from day to day based on factors such as traffic and weather.\n\nSecond, Plaintiffs note that Sears defines the normal commute time under the HDP\n\nas thirty-five minutes nationwide (with the sole exceptions of the State of\n\nWashington and Saint Louis),31 and that this does not take into account differences\n\nbetween urban, suburban and rural locations.\n\n            Plaintiffs’ attack on the HDP’s definition of a normal commute is\n\nunpersuasive. Plaintiffs cite no authority for the thesis that a normal commute\n\nmust be defined by distance and not time, and nothing in the statutory language\n\ncompels such a result. The statute requires only that the travel be within the\n\n“normal commuting area for the employer’s business or establishment.” Indeed,\n\nin light of the fact that wages are paid by the hour—not by miles traveled—it is\n\nnot unreasonable to define a commute by travel time rather than by distance.\n\n            Guidance from the Department of Labor (“DOL”) confirms this\n\ninterpretation. In a 1999 Opinion Letter interpreting the ECFA, the DOL stated\n\nthat a home-based employee traveling in a company van would not need to be\n\ncompensated for travel from home to a work site unless “the time involved is\n\nextraordinary.” U.S. Dep’t Lab. Op. Ltr. (January 29, 1999). The Opinion Letter\n\ncontinued:\n\n            31\n                 See Torre Deposition [Doc. # 44-14], at 42.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        23\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 24   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            For example, where a field engineer’s commute to the first job site in\n            the morning takes four hours, we would consider the greater portion\n            of travel time compensable under the principles described in 29\n            C.F.R. § 785.37. That rule allows a portion of the total commute time\n            to be considered non-compensable home-to-home travel. If the\n            employer treated three of the four hours as compensable travel, we\n            would not question such practice.\n\nId. The DOL reasoning thus confirms not only that time is appropriate to measure\n\nwhat constitutes a normal commute for purposes of the ECFA, but also that\n\ncommute times of up to one hour would comply with that statute. Other courts\n\nhave ruled that commutes far longer than thirty-five minutes are within the\n\ndefinition of ordinary home to work travel and are hence non-compensable under\n\nthe Portal-to-Portal Act. See, e.g., Smith v. Aztec Well Serv’g Co., 462 F.3d 1274,\n\n1288-90 (10th Cir. 2006) (commutes of up to three and half hours non-\n\ncompensable); Vega, 36 F.3d at 424 (daily commutes of up to four hours non-\n\ncompensable).\n\n            The uncontradicted record evidence shows that Sears conducted studies of\n\nemployee commutes before establishing a thirty-five minute commute time.32\n\nPlaintiffs have produced no evidence that their commutes were greater than the\n\nthirty-five minute allotment or that this period is otherwise not “normal” for their\n\n“employer’s business or establishment.” Moreover, under the HDP, to the extent\n\n            32\n                 Torre Deposition [Doc. # 44-14], at 68-69.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        24\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012      Page: 25   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                        No. 10-20360\n\nthat an employee’s commute exceeds thirty-five minutes, the employee is\n\ncompensated for the overage. Plaintiffs’ complaints about a lack of predictability\n\nare thus misplaced. To the extent that an employee’s commute unexpectedly takes\n\nlonger than thirty-five minutes, the employee is paid for the excess part of the\n\ncommute. The Court holds that Sears’ HDP complies with both prongs of the\n\nECFA.\n\n                                    b.           Conditions on Employees’ Use of Company Vans\n\n             Plaintiffs next argue that conditions placed upon employees’ use of\n\ncompany vans make the ECFA inapplicable to this dispute because commutes\n\nunder the HDP are not “normal.” Specifically, Plaintiffs complain that under the\n\nHDP they are not permitted to use the company van “(1) on days off for personal\n\nor non-company use; (2) to pick up children from school; or (3) for any personal\n\nerrands unless they are short in duration (e.g. stopping to get a cup of coffee).”33\n\nPlaintiffs note that technicians are not permitted to meet family or friends during\n\ntheir morning or evening commute times, and that they are required to drive home\n\ndirectly from their last call—no detours are permitted unless short in duration.34\n\nPlaintiffs also point out that they are required to transport tools and parts in the\n\n\n            33\n                 Chambers Response, at 12-13.\n            34\n                 Id.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932          25\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 26   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\ncompany van during the morning and evening commutes.35 Plaintiffs contend that\n\nthese restrictions on the use of the van during the morning and evening commute\n\nprevent technicians from using this time as they otherwise would and therefore\n\nmake the commute times compensable.\n\n            The Court is entirely unpersuaded. Nothing in the statutory scheme\n\nrequires, or even implies, that such conditions on an employee’s use of a company\n\ncar, including the transportation of parts or tools, can transform an otherwise non-\n\ncompensable commute in to a compensable one. In fact, the ECFA expressly\n\nprovides that “activities performed by an employee which are incidental to the use\n\nof [the employer’s] vehicle for commuting shall not be considered part of the\n\nemployee’s principal activities.” 29 U.S.C. § 254(a). Again, Plaintiffs cite no\n\nauthority for the proposition that conditions like those Sears placed upon\n\nPlaintiffs’ use of the company vans make commute time compensable under the\n\nECFA.36 Moreover, reported decisions do not support Plaintiffs’ contentions. See\n\nRutti, 596 F.3d at 1053-54; Buzek, 501 F.Supp.2d at 877, 886-87 (employee’s\n\ncommute in company vehicle was not rendered compensable by rules that he not\n\n\n            35\n                 See, e.g., id. at 20.\n            36\n          Indeed, Plaintiffs cite only to the minority report in the legislative history of the\nECFA.

See Rutti, 596\n\nF.3d at 1053-54. In Rutti, a home-based technician sought compensation for his\n\ncommutes in a company vehicle to and from the first and last customer call of the\n\nday, and for certain activities he performed before he left home for work and after\n\nhe returned. Id. at 1049. The technician argued, inter alia, that the employer’s\n\n“restrictions against using the vehicle for personal pursuits and transporting\n\npassengers, the requirement that he drive directly from home to work and from\n\nwork to home, and the requirement that he have his cell phone on” exceeded the\n\nscope of “incidental” activities under the ECFA and made his commute an integral\n\nand indispensable part of his principal activities for the employer.

The House\n\nReport for the bill states that:\n\n            Activities which are merely incidental to the use of an\n            employer-provided vehicle for commuting at the beginning and end\n            of the workday are similarly not considered part of the employee’s\n            principal activity or activities and therefore need not be compensable.\n            It is not possible to define in all circumstances what specific tasks and\n            activities would be considered ‘incidental’ to the use of an employer’s\n            vehicle for commuting. Communication between the employee and\n            employer to receive assignments, or instructions or to transmit advice\n            on work progress or completion, is required in order for these\n            programs to exist. Likewise, routine vehicle safety inspections or\n            other minor tasks have long been considered preliminary or\n            postliminary activities and are therefore not compensable. Merely\n            transporting tools or supplies should not change the noncompensable\n            nature of the travel.\n\nH.R. REP. NO. 104-585 at 5; Rutti, 596 at 1053. Conversely, the minority report on\n\nthe ECFA, without success, expressed objections to the bill on the ground that\n\n“non-employee passengers in such vehicles are uniformly prohibited” and an\n\nemployee could be “effectively prohibited from engaging in the very common and\n\noften necessary family task of dropping off his or her child at school on the way to\n\nwork.” H.R.

App’x 448, 454 (5th\n\nCir. 2009) (“To be ‘integral and indispensable,’ an activity must be necessary to\n\nthe principal work performed and done for the benefit of the employer.”).\n\n            The ECFA, in turn, expressly provides that “the use of an employer’s\n\nvehicle for travel by an employee and activities performed by an employee which\n\nare incidental to the use of such vehicle for commuting shall not be considered part\n\n\n            37\n           Section 4(a)(1) of the Portal-to Portal Act provides that employers are not liable for\ntime spent by employees: “walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of\nperformance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\n. . .” 29 U.S.C. § 254(a)(1); Steiner, 350 U.S. at 253 n.2.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        30\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 31   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nof the employee’s principal activities.” 29 U.S.C. § 254(a) (emphasis added).\n\nThus, under the foregoing law, if the disputed activities were “incidental” to the\n\nuse of the company van for commuting, they are not principal activities. On the\n\nother hand, if these activities were “integral and indispensable” to Sears’\n\n“principal activity or activities,” they are compensable.38\n\n            Finally, even if Plaintiffs’ activities are integral and indispensable to a\n\nprincipal activity, they nevertheless may be non-compensable if they are de\n\nminimis. In Anderson, the Supreme Court held that when “the matter in issue\n\nconcerns only a few seconds or minutes of work beyond the scheduled working\n\nhours, such trifles may be disregarded.” 328 U.S. at 692. “It is only when an\n\n\n            38\n           Plaintiffs argue that an activity can be incidental to the employee’s use of the\nemployer’s vehicle for the commute under the ECFA, but nevertheless compensable as integral\nand indispensable to an employer’s principal activity. In this connection, Plaintiffs assail the\nBuzek court’s holding that the ECFA created a third exemption from compensability under the\nPortal-to-Portal Act, see Buzek, 501 F.Supp.2d at 885-886, and cite to two unpublished cases\nholding that the ECFA merely clarifies the limits of the Portal-to-Portal exemptions. See\nBurton v. Hillsborough County, 181 F. App’x 829, 835 (11th Cir. 2006); Reich v. Brenaman\nElec. Serv., 1997 WL 164235, at *5-*6 (E.D.Pa. Mar. 28, 1997). The Court disagrees with\nPlaintiffs’ analysis of the law. First, Plaintiff’s interpretation would render the ECFA\nmeaningless. The ECFA provides by its express terms that “the use of an employer’s vehicle\nfor travel by an employee and activities performed by an employee which are incidental to the\nuse of such vehicle for commuting shall not be considered part of the employee’s principal\nactivities.” 29 U.S.C. § 254(a) (emphasis added). Whether the addition of this language to the\nPortal-to-Portal Act created a new category of activities exempted from compensability, or\nmerely clarified that these activities were never intended to be compensable in the first place,\nis of no moment in the case at bar. Either way, with the enactment of the ECFA, Congress\nmade clear that activities within its scope are not compensable. See id.; see also H.R. REP . NO .\n585-104, at 5 (“Activities which are merely incidental to the use of an employer-provided\nvehicle for commuting at the beginning and end of the workday. . .need not be compensable.”\n(emphasis added)).\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        31\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 32   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nemployee is required to give up a substantial measure of his time and effort that\n\ncompensable working time is involved.” Id. “The de minimis rule provides that\n\nan employer, in recording working time, may disregard ‘insubstantial or\n\ninsignificant periods of time beyond the scheduled working hours, which cannot\n\nas a practical administrative matter be precisely recorded for payroll purposes.’”\n\nMireles v.

As detailed in the factual background above, under the HDP,\n\ntechnicians are required to log onto the SST in the morning to learn their first\n\nassignment. Sears has produced uncontradicted expert testimony that this process\n\ntakes approximately 8.5 seconds.46 If the technician discovers that the automatic,\n\novernight upload/download process was not successful, he is to perform this\n\nfunction manually with a “a few key strokes.” If the manual process is\n\nunsuccessful, the technician is compensated for any additional time spent\n\ntroubleshooting the SST. After logging on and receiving the location of the day’s\n\nfirst service call, the technician is required to unplug the SST and carry it to the\n\nvan, where it is plugged into a docking station. The technician then commutes to\n\nthe first service call of the day, transporting any parts and supplies that are present\n\nin the van. At the end of the day, the technician unplugs the SST from the van,\n\ncarries it into his house, and plugs it into an electrical outlet and phone line so that\n\nit can automatically upload information regarding the current day’s service stops\n\nand download the next morning’s assignment overnight.\n\n\n\n\n            46\n          As noted above, Plaintiffs report, respectively, that their respective morning, off-the-\nclock activities took thirty and ten to twenty minutes.

Although the statute does not define “incidental,” the\n\nECFA’s legislative history makes clear that Congress intended these types of\n\nactivities to be non-compensable. As noted above, the House Report for the\n\nECFA stated that though it was not “possible to define in all circumstances what\n\nspecific tasks and activities would be considered ‘incidental’ to the use of an\n\nemployer’s vehicle for commuting[, c]ommunication between the employee and\n\nemployer to receive assignments, or instructions or to transmit advice on work\n\nprogress or completion, is required in order for these programs to exist.” H.R.\n\nREP. NO. 104-585 at 5. Here, the home use of the SST, both with regard to\n\nlogging in to receive the first assignment in the morning, and plugging it in so that\n\nassignment may be transmitted at night, is for communication with the employer\n\nin order to receive assignments.47\n\n\n       47\n          While it is true that plugging the SST into the phone line at the end of the day is also\nfor the purpose of uploading information about assignments completed during the current day,\nthe cited legislative history specifically contemplates that this type of activity would be non-\ncompensable. See H.R. REP . NO . 104-585 at 5 (“Communication between the employee and\nemployer to . . . transmit advice on work progress or completion, is required in order for\nthese programs to exist.”). In any event, it is necessary to plug the SST to receive the next\nday’s assignment, an activity that is clearly incidental to the commute.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd 110615.0932 38\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 39   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            Similarly, the House Report specifically states that “merely transporting\n\ntools or supplies should not change the noncompensable nature of the travel.” Id.\n\nThere is no evidence that transporting the parts and tools under the HDP increased\n\na technician’s commute times in any respect.\n\n            Because these activities relate to the employee’s commute, and not the\n\nprincipal activities of the employer, they are non-compensable. See Rutti, 506\n\nF.3d at 1057 (holding that the technician’s morning activities of “receiving,\n\nmapping and prioritizing jobs and routes for assignments,” are related to his\n\ncommute, clearly distinct from his principal activities from his employer, and not\n\ncompensable); Buzek, 501 F.Supp.2d at 886 (home-based technicians’\n\ntransportation of tools in company car (and completion of end-of-day reports at\n\nhome) were incidental to commute and thus non-compensable); Doyle v.

The technicians were directed\n\nto place the boxes into the van, outside the workday because this task must be\n\nperformed when the vans are at technicians’ homes. Technicians may, however,\n\nload the boxes at a time of their choosing. The technicians specifically are\n\ninstructed, however, not to unpack the boxes or sort the parts outside of the\n\nworkday.50 In fact, this instruction was “stamped right on the box” in which the\n\ntools were sent.51\n\n            This loading task (which is short in duration) appears to be incidental to the\n\nuse of Sears’ vans for the commute, because loading of supplies is “required in\n\n            49\n              (...continued)\n            In the case at bar, Sears does not require technicians to monitor the SST after they\n            plug it in as the technicians were required to do in Rutti. On the record presented, it\n            appears that if any problems arise with the SST, they arise in the morning when the\n            technician attempts to log in. Unlike in Rutti, to the extent a technician had to spend\n            an appreciable amount of time troubleshooting the SST, he was compensated for this\n            effort under the HDP.\n            50\n                 Chambers Deposition, at 48; Werchan Deposition, at 77-78.\n            51\n                 Chambers Deposition, at 48.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        41\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012       Page: 42   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                         No. 10-20360\n\norder for [the HDP] to exist.” See H.R. REP. NO. 104-585 at 5. Even if not\n\nincidental, the Court holds that the time it takes for a technician to place boxes of\n\nreplenishment parts into his van is de minimis. Both Plaintiffs testified that they\n\nreceived the boxes of parts sporadically. Chambers testified that he mostly\n\nreceived shipments once or twice a week.52 Werchan testified that the frequency\n\nof shipments varied, but that he might get two or three deliveries a week.53\n\nPlaintiffs cite to no evidence indicating that placing the boxes in the vans was\n\nparticularly difficult or required more than a couple of minutes at most. It would\n\nalso be administratively difficult to track the amount of time technicians spent\n\nplacing unopened boxes of parts in their vans a couple of times per week. This is\n\nespecially true since technicians were allowed to place the boxes in the vans at\n\ntheir leisure, including during the morning walk to the van that was already\n\nnecessary to begin the commute, a non-compensable event. The periodic\n\nplacement of boxes of parts in the service vans under the HDP is not compensable\n\nunder FLSA.\n\n                                    c.

Both Plaintiffs allege that they removed trash from the van in the\n\nmorning, conducted pre- and post-trip vehicle safety inspections, ensured that the\n\nvan was neat and tidy in the evening, unpacked and sorted parts, prepared and\n\ntransmitted end of day reports via the SST, ensured that customer payments are\n\nproperly accounted for, made bank deposits, and placed credit card receipts and\n\nother paperwork in envelopes and mailed them to Sears.54 Werchan also claims\n\n\n\n\n            54\n            Plaintiffs assert in their affidavits, without any support or detail, that they were “required” to\nperform the listed activities either before or after work, or both. As set forth above, the evidence of record\nestablishes that, under the HDP rules, the activities to which Plaintiffs refer were not to be performed off-the-\nclock. Further, in some respects Plaintiffs’ affidavits contradict their deposition testimony and will not be\nconsidered. See S.W.S. Erectors, Inc v. Infax, Inc., 72 F.3d 489, 495-96 (5th Cir. 1996) (a party cannot\n“defeat a motion for summary judgment using an affidavit that impeaches, without explanation, sworn\ntestimony”). For example, Plaintiffs acknowledged in their depositions that they were instructed not to\nunpack and sort replenishment parts outside the workday, Chambers Deposition, at 48; Werchan Deposition,\nat 77-78, and thus implicitly concede that this was the HDP policy. Another example is that the SST Help\nManual is clear that banking and mailing envelopes is to be done during the workday after arriving at the first\ncustomer’s location. SST Help Manual [Doc. # 42-6], at SW2918, SW2922. Plaintiffs do not directly\ncontrovert this evidence. They assert instead in their affidavits that they had “no choice” but to perform such\nactivities off-the-clock because of pressure to complete as many service calls during the day as possible.\nChambers Affidavit, ¶ 19; Werchan Affidavit, ¶ 18. This assertion of rules violations does not address the\npending issue of whether Sears knew of their alleged off-the-clock work.\n\n            In any event, Plaintiffs’ averments that various activities were “required” to be performed outside\n            the workday is a bald conclusory assertion that does not create a genuine issue of fact that Sears in\n            fact required such tasks in this fashion.

See Newton v. City of Henderson, 47 F.3d 746, 748 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n“Work not requested but suffered or permitted is work time.” 29 C.F.R. § 785.15.\n\n            Turning first to the activities that both Plaintiffs claim they performed off-\n\nthe-clock, Plaintiffs fail to cite to any direct evidence that Sears had actual or\n\nconstructive knowledge that they were performing these tasks outside of the\n\nworking day. Instead, Plaintiffs argue circumstantially that Sears had constructive\n\nknowledge that they were working off-the-clock because the stated purpose of the\n\nHDP was to decrease the amount of time technicians spend on clerical and non-\n\nvalue added tasks and to maximize the number of service calls made per day.\n\n\n\n\n            55\n          It is not clear from the record whether refueling the service van, performing vehicle\nsafety inspections, and tidying up the van, were occasionally to be performed off-the-clock\nunder the HDP. In any event, these activities are clearly incidental to the commute under the\nECFA and thus non-compensable. See H.R. REP . NO . 104-585 at 5 (“routine vehicle safety inspections\nor other minor tasks have long been considered preliminary or postliminary activities and are therefore not\ncompensable.”). These activities are also de minimis. Cf.

The fact that Sears encouraged workers to be\n\nefficient does not constitute evidence of Sears’ knowledge of Plaintiffs’\n\nperformance of specific tasks or practices. This is evidence, at best, of a motive\n\nfor Sears’ creation of the HDP. The motive simply does not raise a genuine issue\n\nof material fact that Sears had actual or constructive knowledge that Plaintiffs in\n\nfact were performing work outside the workday.\n\n            Similarly, Chambers’ averment that he was reprimanded for not completing\n\nenough service calls per day does not suffice to raise a fact issue that his\n\nsupervisors had actual or constructive knowledge that his solution to this issue\n\nwas to work off-the-clock.56\n\n            Plaintiff Werchan has produced some evidence he claims shows that Sears\n\nknew that, prior to the start of the workday, he placed phone calls to the first\n\ncustomer of the day. Specifically, Werchan points to a document he claims Sears\n\nprovided to him stating “Technician needs to ‘Call Ahead.’ If customer is not at\n\nhome, the technician needs to run the call.”57 This instruction does not establish\n\n\n            56\n                 See Chambers Affidavit, ¶ 20.\n            57\n                 Werchan Affidavit II, at 3.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        45\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 46   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nthat Werchan or any technician was instructed to call the first customer of the day\n\nprior to arriving at the customer’s address. However, Werchan also testified that\n\nhe informed his manager that he was calling the first customer of the day either\n\nbefore or during his drive.58 The Court deems Werchan to have raised a genuine\n\nissue of material fact that Sears was aware that he made these phone calls off-the-\n\nclock.\n\n            The Court nevertheless concludes that any “call ahead” phone calls are not\n\ncompensable under the FLSA. First, calling the first customer of the day to\n\nconfirm an appointment is arguably incidental to the commute under the ECFA.\n\nThis task is analogous to an employee communicating with an employer to receive\n\nthe assignment in the first place, i.e., the call confirms the employee’s travel\n\ndirectly from home to the customer’s location. Alternatively, to the extent that\n\nthis activity is not incidental to the commute and instead is integral and\n\nindispensable to a principal work activity of a technician, the time required for\n\nthese calls is de minimis. There is no evidence that making a phone call each day\n\nto confirm an appointment would take more than a minute or so, if that. It would\n\nbe difficult to record this time under any circumstances, but particularly where\n\nWerchan apparently often performed this task during his commute.

Plaintiffs’ Other Theories of Relief Under FLSA\n\n            Plaintiffs also argue that even if the morning and evening commutes as well\n\nas other off-the-clock activities are non-compensable under the ECFA, they may\n\nnevertheless be compensable based on “custom or practice” at the employer’s\n\nestablishment, the “continuous workday rule,” or as “wait time” or “on-call” time.\n\nThe Court addresses each contention in turn.\n\n                                    a.           Custom or Practice\n\n            Plaintiffs argue that their commutes and other off-the-clock activities under\n\nthe HDP are compensable because of “custom or practice” in effect at the\n\nemployer’s establishment. Subsection (b) of the Portal-to-Portal Act provides that\n\neven if an activity would be exempted from compensability under subsection (a),\n\nan employer will still be liable for the activity if it is compensable because of\n\n            a custom or practice in effect, at the time of such activity, at the\n            establishment or other place where such employee is employed,\n            covering such activity, not inconsistent with a written or nonwritten\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932           47\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 48   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            contract, in effect at the time of such activity, between such\n            employee, his agent, or collective-bargaining representative and his\n            employer.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 254(b)(2). Plaintiffs argue that prior to the implementation of the\n\nHDP in 2001, Sears compensated technicians for their morning and evening\n\ncommutes as well as certain activities performed prior to and after the service\n\nrun.59 Accordingly, they contend, these activities are still compensable as a\n\ncustom or practice.\n\n            Plaintiffs’ custom or practice contention is unavailing. The custom or\n\npractice to which the statute refers must be in effect at the time of the activity for\n\nwhich the plaintiff employee seeks compensation. Id. § 254(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. §\n\n790.11 (“the compensability of [an activity alleged to be compensable by custom\n\nor practice], and its inclusion in computation of hours worked, is not determinable\n\nby a custom or practice which had been terminated before the activity was\n\nengaged in . . .”). The undisputed evidence shows that the HDP was implemented\n\nin 2001, and that approximately 90 percent of technicians have participated. It is\n\nalso undisputed that, under the HDP, Sears has not compensated its technicians for\n\ntheir morning or evening commutes or for the other activities noted by Plaintiffs.\n\nIndeed, this is the very essence of Plaintiffs’ claims.

Thus, even assuming that Plaintiffs correctly characterize Sears’ pre-\n\nHDP practices, it is clear that there was no custom or practice of compensating the\n\ntechnicians for the disputed activities, “in effect, at the time of [the allegedly\n\ncompensable] activity.” 29 U.S.C. § 254(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. § 790.11. The\n\nregulations “permit recognition of changes in customs, practices and agreements\n\nwhich reflect changes in labor-management relations or policies.” 29 C.F.R. §\n\n790.11.

Plaintiffs rely on the District of\n\nMassachusetts decision in Dooley v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 307 F.Supp.2d\n\n234, 242-243 (D. Mass. 2004). In Dooley, the District of Massachusetts held that,\n\nunder the continuous workday rule, home-based appraisers’ commutes to and from\n\nthe first and last customer calls of the day were compensable if the appraisers\n\nperformed principal activities, such as checking email and voice mail, preparing\n\ntheir computers for use, and returning telephone calls, before leaving home for the\n\nfirst assignment of the day and after returning home from the last assignment\n\nrespectively. Id. Because the Court has concluded that Sears’ technicians’ pre-\n\ncommute morning activities and post-commute evening activities under the HDP\n\nare non-compensable as incidental to the commute and/or de minimis, Dooley is\n\ninapposite.\n\n            60\n                 Chambers Response, at 29.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        50\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 51   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            The Court rejects also Plaintiffs’ subsidiary point that when technicians\n\nspend compensable time troubleshooting the SST in the morning, this activity\n\ncommences the workday and transforms the commute to the first service call into\n\ncompensable time.61 Significantly, the implementing regulations for the FLSA\n\nestablish that the continuous workday rule is not absolute. Section 785.15 of Title\n\n29 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides that “periods during which an\n\nemployee is completely relieved from duty and which are long enough to enable\n\nhim to use the time effectively for his own purposes are not hours worked.”62\n\nWhile the HDP requires that employees spend time troubleshooting the SST under\n\ncertain circumstances, Plaintiffs have adduced no evidence that technicians are\n\nrequired to perform this activity at a particular time. Rather, there is only a\n\nrequirement that technicians try to arrive at the first service call by 8:00 a.m., at\n\nwhich time the technician is to “clock in” on the SST.

See 29 C.F.R. §\n\n785.16(a); Rutti, 596 F.3d at 1060-61.\n\n            The Court’s conclusion is consistent with the recent opinion of the Ninth\n\nCircuit in Rutti. See 596 F.3d at 1060-61. As mentioned, the Ninth Circuit held in\n\nthat case that a home-based technician’s commutes in a company car to and from\n\nhis first and last service calls of the day were not compensable. The Rutti court\n\nheld, however, that a fact question existed as to the compensability of one of the\n\ntechnician’s post evening-commute activities—completing a transmission from a\n\nhandheld computer. Id. at 1058-59. However, the court held that this activity,\n\neven if compensable, would not extend the workday to encompass the technician’s\n\ncommute home. Id. at 1060-61. Noting that the technician at issue was merely\n\nrequired to send the transmission at some point between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.,\n\nand that he was “completely relieved from duty the moment he completed his last\n\nservice stop of the day,” the court held that the technician was effectively able to\n\nuse the time after his last stop for his own purposes and the continuous workday\n\n\n\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        52\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012      Page: 53   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                        No. 10-20360\n\nrule thus did not extend the workday to include the commute home. Id.63 The\n\nsame holds true in the case at bar.64\n\n            Plaintiffs’ continuous workday argument fails for another reason: Neither\n\nPlaintiff has cited to any evidence of specific instances of Sears failing to\n\ncompensate them for commuting and performing other off-the-clock activities\n\nafter troubleshooting the SST. Delta & Pine Land Co. v. Nationwide Agribusiness\n\nIns. Co., 530 F.3d 395, 399 (5th Cir. 2008) (“conclusory allegations” or\n\n“unsubstantiated assertions” do not meet the non-movant’s summary judgment\n\nburden).\n\n            Plaintiffs accordingly have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact\n\nthat their morning and evening commutes and other off-the-clock activities under\n\nthe HDP are rendered compensable because of the continuous workday doctrine.\n\n                                    c.           Wait Time and On-Call Time\n\n           63\n          The Court notes that the facts in Dooley, a District of Massachusetts court’s decision\nthat is not authority binding on this court, are distinguishable from the case at bar. The\nDooley court found that the appraisers before it engaged in numerous principal activities at\nhome that resulted in “the first and last trip of the day. . . not [being] a commute in the\nordinary sense of the word—it is a trip between their office, where administrative work is\nperformed, and an off-site work location.” Dooley, 307 F.Supp.2d at 245. Here, the technicians’\nhomes are not like offices. As set forth above, the only compensable activity performed there\nis the occasional troubleshooting of the SST.\n           64\n         A 1999 DOL Opinion Letter is consistent with this interpretation: “Communication\nbetween the employee and the employer at home or in a hotel with respect to assignments,\ninstructions, work progress or completion would not, per se, affect the compensability of travel\ntime.” U.S. Dep’t Lab.

(quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 137 (1944)). An employee is\n\nengaged to wait, and thus must be compensated, when he is unable to use waiting\n\ntime “effectively for his own purposes,” and the time “belongs to and is controlled\n\nby the employer.” Id. § 785.15; see also Vega, 36 F.3d at 425 (“waiting time is\n\ncompensable if the wait predominantly benefits the employer”) (citing Mireles v.\n\nFrio Foods, Inc., 899 F.2d 1407, 1411 (5th Cir. 1990)). Plaintiffs contend that\n\ntechnicians are “engaged to wait” during their morning and evening commutes\n\nunder the HDP because they cannot use that time effectively for their own\n\npurposes. They argue that this time belongs to and is controlled by Sears. In\n\nsupport of this argument, Plaintiffs rehash their complaints regarding the\n\nconditions placed on employees’ use of the company’s vans discussed above.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        54\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 55   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            This argument is rejected. “Wait time is compensable when it is part of a\n\nprincipal activity of the employee, but not if it is a preliminary or postliminary\n\nactivity.” Vega, 36 F.3d at 425 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 254). As noted,\n\nnotwithstanding Sears’ restrictions on employees’ use of the vans, commutes of up\n\nto thirty-five minutes under the HDP fit within the ECFA’s exclusion for an\n\nemployee’s commute in a company vehicle and the exclusion for activities\n\nincidental to use of that vehicle for the commute. Accordingly, these commute\n\nperiods are not principal activities and are thus not compensable as “wait time”\n\nunder FLSA. See id.\n\n            Plaintiffs’ argument that the commutes are compensable because of\n\nregulations pertaining to “on-call time” also fails. “An employee who is required\n\nto remain on call on the employer’s premises or so close thereto that he cannot use\n\nthe time effectively for his own purposes is working while ‘on call.’” 29 C.F.R. §\n\n785.17. Plaintiffs again argue that technicians cannot use their commute time\n\neffectively for their own purposes because of the restrictions placed on the use of\n\nthe company vans. As stated above, this argument fails because the morning and\n\nevening commutes under the HDP comply with the ECFA and are thus non-\n\ncompensable. Moreover, Plaintiffs cite no evidence that the technicians are, in\n\nfact, on-call for work for Sears during the employees’ commute times.

Plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that their morning and evening\n\ncommutes were compensable as wait time or on-call time.\n\n            In sum, Plaintiffs have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that\n\ntheir morning and evening commutes and other off-the-clock activities are\n\ncompensable under the FLSA. Sears is therefore entitled to summary judgment on\n\nPlaintiffs’ FLSA claims.\n\n            B.          Plaintiff Chambers’ State Law Claims\n\n            Plaintiff Chambers also claims that his morning and evening commutes and\n\nother off-the-clock activities are compensable under the Texas Minimum Wage\n\nAct (“TMWA”), which requires that employers pay employees the federal\n\nminimum wage. See TEX. LAB. CODE § 62.051. Chambers couples this claim with\n\na prayer for relief under the Texas Payday Law for payment of wages due. Id. §\n\n61.011.65 The Texas Payday Law was enacted to require “certain types of\n\n            65\n                 The Texas Payday Law, TEXAS LABOR CODE § 61.011, provides in pertinent part:\n\n                        (a)    An employer shall pay wages to each employee who is exempt\n                        from the overtime pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of\n                        1938 (29 U.S.C. Section 201 et seq.) at least once a month.\n                                                                                     (continued...)\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        56\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 57   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nemployers to promptly and regularly pay employees the full amount of wages\n\ndue.” Igal v. Brightstar Info. Tech., Inc., 250 S.W.3d 78, 82 (Tex. 2008).66\n\n            The TMWA expressly provides that its provisions “do not apply to a person\n\ncovered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Section 201 et seq.).”\n\nTEX. LAB. CODE § 62.151.67 From this premise, Chambers argues that if the Court\n\nfinds that the disputed activities in this case “are not covered by the FLSA,” then\n\nthe TMWA must apply in its stead.68\n\n            Chambers’ contention is rejected. There is no dispute that Chambers’\n\nemployment with Sears is covered by the FLSA. The Court does not hold that\n\nChambers’ employment was not covered by the FLSA. Rather, the Court holds\n\nthat the activities in question are not compensable under that statute. If Chambers’\n\ninterpretation of the TMWA was correct, an absurd result would occur: A plaintiff\n\n\n\n            65\n                 (...continued)\n                       (b)    An employer shall pay wages to an employee other than an\n                       employee covered by Subsection (a) at least twice a month.\n\n\n            66\n          Chambers did not plead a claim under the TMWA per se. Sears argues that this\nclaim is thus foreclosed, as the Texas Payday Law itself does not provide a right to wages, but\nmerely regulates the paying of wages owed. Because the Court reaches the merits of\nChambers TMWA contention, it need not resolve the pleading dispute.\n            67\n         Similarly, the Texas Payday Law applies only to employees who are “exempt from\nthe overtime pay provisions of the [FLSA].” TX .

The TMWA does not apply to\n\nChambers’ employment with Sears, and Sears is entitled to summary judgment on\n\nthat claim.\n\n            To the extent the Texas Payday Law claim is severable under Chambers’\n\ntheory, Chambers has not raised a genuine issue of material fact that Sears owed\n\nhim any wages.

CONCLUSION\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the Court holds that Plaintiffs have failed to raise\n\na genuine issue of material fact that the disputed activities in this case are\n\ncompensable under the FLSA.

Technicians keep the company van at their homes overnight. Sears pays for\n\nall commuting expenses related to the van, including gas, maintenance, and\n\ninsurance. Technicians participating in the HDP are not paid for the first thirty-\n\nfive minutes of their morning and evening commutes, that is, they are not paid for\n\nthe first thirty-five minutes of the travel to the location of the first customer of the\n\nday, nor for the first thirty-five minutes of the trip to the technician’s home from\n\nthe last service call of the day.

Similarly, assuming that\n\nthe commute from the last stop of the day home does not exceed thirty-five\n\nminutes, his compensable work day ends when he finishes his activities at the last\n\ncustomer’s location.\n\n            Not all Sears technicians participate in the HDP.7 Those that do not\n\nparticipate also use company vans to complete their service calls, but report every\n\nday to an office or alternative location where the company van is parked\n\novernight. These technicians commute each day to the office or alternative\n\nlocation to pick up the van, and then proceed to the first customer’s home. Non-\n\nHDP technicians are not paid for their commutes to and from the parking\n\nlocations. Non-HDP technicians’ compensable day begins when they pick up the\n\nvans and ends when they return the vans to the parking location at the end of the\n\nday.\n\n            Both Chambers and Werchan participated in the HDP.\n\n            A technician’s participation in the HDP is governed by instructions and\n\nprocedures set forth in a manual called the SST Help System Manual (“Help\n\n\n            7\n        A Sears representative estimated that over 90 percent of its technicians participate\nin the HDP.

It is clear that an\n\nemployee’s ordinary commute to and from work is generally non-compensable\n\nunder the Portal-to-Portal Act.\n\n            As noted, Congress passed the ECFA to clarify that an employee’s commute\n\nin a company car is not compensable if the two statutory conditions are met.\n\nPlaintiffs do not contest that they participated in the HDP subject to an agreement,\n\nand thus the second condition — that the employee’s use of the vehicle be subject\n\nto an agreement with the employer — is met. Plaintiffs focus on the first\n\ncondition and contend that the HDP fails to meet the ECFA criteria because it\n\nrequires travel outside the “normal commuting area.” Plaintiffs also argue that\n\nvarious conditions placed on the employee’s use of the van take the program\n\noutside the scope of non-compensability intended by Congress in passing the\n\nECFA.\n\n                                    a.           “Normal Commuting Area”\n\n            For travel to meet the requirements of the ECFA, it must be “within the\n\nnormal commuting area for the employer’s business or establishment.” 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 254(a). Plaintiffs contend that under a plain language analysis, the normal\n\ncommuting area must be defined by distance, not as a function of time. Plaintiffs\n\nurge that defining commute by time is problematic, first, because the commuting\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932         22\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 23   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\narea may change from day to day based on factors such as traffic and weather.\n\nSecond, Plaintiffs note that Sears defines the normal commute time under the HDP\n\nas thirty-five minutes nationwide (with the sole exceptions of the State of\n\nWashington and Saint Louis),31 and that this does not take into account differences\n\nbetween urban, suburban and rural locations.\n\n            Plaintiffs’ attack on the HDP’s definition of a normal commute is\n\nunpersuasive. Plaintiffs cite no authority for the thesis that a normal commute\n\nmust be defined by distance and not time, and nothing in the statutory language\n\ncompels such a result. The statute requires only that the travel be within the\n\n“normal commuting area for the employer’s business or establishment.” Indeed,\n\nin light of the fact that wages are paid by the hour—not by miles traveled—it is\n\nnot unreasonable to define a commute by travel time rather than by distance.\n\n            Guidance from the Department of Labor (“DOL”) confirms this\n\ninterpretation. In a 1999 Opinion Letter interpreting the ECFA, the DOL stated\n\nthat a home-based employee traveling in a company van would not need to be\n\ncompensated for travel from home to a work site unless “the time involved is\n\nextraordinary.” U.S. Dep’t Lab. Op. Ltr. (January 29, 1999). The Opinion Letter\n\ncontinued:\n\n            31\n                 See Torre Deposition [Doc. # 44-14], at 42.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        23\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 24   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            For example, where a field engineer’s commute to the first job site in\n            the morning takes four hours, we would consider the greater portion\n            of travel time compensable under the principles described in 29\n            C.F.R. § 785.37. That rule allows a portion of the total commute time\n            to be considered non-compensable home-to-home travel. If the\n            employer treated three of the four hours as compensable travel, we\n            would not question such practice.\n\nId. The DOL reasoning thus confirms not only that time is appropriate to measure\n\nwhat constitutes a normal commute for purposes of the ECFA, but also that\n\ncommute times of up to one hour would comply with that statute. Other courts\n\nhave ruled that commutes far longer than thirty-five minutes are within the\n\ndefinition of ordinary home to work travel and are hence non-compensable under\n\nthe Portal-to-Portal Act.

Nothing in the statutory scheme\n\nrequires, or even implies, that such conditions on an employee’s use of a company\n\ncar, including the transportation of parts or tools, can transform an otherwise non-\n\ncompensable commute in to a compensable one. In fact, the ECFA expressly\n\nprovides that “activities performed by an employee which are incidental to the use\n\nof [the employer’s] vehicle for commuting shall not be considered part of the\n\nemployee’s principal activities.” 29 U.S.C. § 254(a). Again, Plaintiffs cite no\n\nauthority for the proposition that conditions like those Sears placed upon\n\nPlaintiffs’ use of the company vans make commute time compensable under the\n\nECFA.36 Moreover, reported decisions do not support Plaintiffs’ contentions.

In Rutti, a home-based technician sought compensation for his\n\ncommutes in a company vehicle to and from the first and last customer call of the\n\nday, and for certain activities he performed before he left home for work and after\n\nhe returned. Id. at 1049. The technician argued, inter alia, that the employer’s\n\n“restrictions against using the vehicle for personal pursuits and transporting\n\npassengers, the requirement that he drive directly from home to work and from\n\nwork to home, and the requirement that he have his cell phone on” exceeded the\n\nscope of “incidental” activities under the ECFA and made his commute an integral\n\nand indispensable part of his principal activities for the employer. Id.

The House\n\nReport for the bill states that:\n\n            Activities which are merely incidental to the use of an\n            employer-provided vehicle for commuting at the beginning and end\n            of the workday are similarly not considered part of the employee’s\n            principal activity or activities and therefore need not be compensable.\n            It is not possible to define in all circumstances what specific tasks and\n            activities would be considered ‘incidental’ to the use of an employer’s\n            vehicle for commuting. Communication between the employee and\n            employer to receive assignments, or instructions or to transmit advice\n            on work progress or completion, is required in order for these\n            programs to exist. Likewise, routine vehicle safety inspections or\n            other minor tasks have long been considered preliminary or\n            postliminary activities and are therefore not compensable. Merely\n            transporting tools or supplies should not change the noncompensable\n            nature of the travel.\n\nH.R. REP. NO. 104-585 at 5; Rutti, 596 at 1053. Conversely, the minority report on\n\nthe ECFA, without success, expressed objections to the bill on the ground that\n\n“non-employee passengers in such vehicles are uniformly prohibited” and an\n\nemployee could be “effectively prohibited from engaging in the very common and\n\noften necessary family task of dropping off his or her child at school on the way to\n\nwork.” H.R.

In 1955, the Supreme Court held that despite the general rule that\n\npreliminary and postliminary activities are not compensable,\n\n            activities performed either before or after the regular work shift, on or\n            off the production line, are compensable under the portal-to-portal\n            provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act if those activities are an\n            integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which\n\n\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        29\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 30   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            covered workmen are employed and are not specifically excluded by\n            Section 4(a)(1).37\n\nSteiner, 350 U.S. at 256. Stated another way, “the Portal-to-Portal Act does not\n\nremove activities which are ‘integral and indispensable’ to ‘principal activities’\n\nfrom FLSA coverage precisely because such activities are themselves ‘principal\n\nactivities.’” Alvarez, 546 U.S. at 340. The Fifth Circuit has held that the test for\n\nwhether an activity is a principal activity, or an integral and indispensable part of\n\nsuch an activity, is “whether the activity is performed as part of the regular work\n\nof the employees in the ordinary course of business. . . . [W]hat is important is that\n\nthe work is necessary to the business and is performed by the employees,\n\nprimarily for the benefit of the employer.” Dunlop, 527 F.2d at 400-401; see also\n\nVon Friewalde v. Boeing Aerospace Operations, Inc., 339 F. App’x 448, 454 (5th\n\nCir. 2009) (“To be ‘integral and indispensable,’ an activity must be necessary to\n\nthe principal work performed and done for the benefit of the employer.”).\n\n            The ECFA, in turn, expressly provides that “the use of an employer’s\n\nvehicle for travel by an employee and activities performed by an employee which\n\nare incidental to the use of such vehicle for commuting shall not be considered part\n\n\n            37\n           Section 4(a)(1) of the Portal-to Portal Act provides that employers are not liable for\ntime spent by employees: “walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of\nperformance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\n. . .” 29 U.S.C. § 254(a)(1); Steiner, 350 U.S. at 253 n.2.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        30\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 31   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nof the employee’s principal activities.” 29 U.S.C. § 254(a) (emphasis added).\n\nThus, under the foregoing law, if the disputed activities were “incidental” to the\n\nuse of the company van for commuting, they are not principal activities. On the\n\nother hand, if these activities were “integral and indispensable” to Sears’\n\n“principal activity or activities,” they are compensable.38\n\n            Finally, even if Plaintiffs’ activities are integral and indispensable to a\n\nprincipal activity, they nevertheless may be non-compensable if they are de\n\nminimis. In Anderson, the Supreme Court held that when “the matter in issue\n\nconcerns only a few seconds or minutes of work beyond the scheduled working\n\nhours, such trifles may be disregarded.” 328 U.S. at 692. “It is only when an\n\n\n            38\n           Plaintiffs argue that an activity can be incidental to the employee’s use of the\nemployer’s vehicle for the commute under the ECFA, but nevertheless compensable as integral\nand indispensable to an employer’s principal activity. In this connection, Plaintiffs assail the\nBuzek court’s holding that the ECFA created a third exemption from compensability under the\nPortal-to-Portal Act, see Buzek, 501 F.Supp.2d at 885-886, and cite to two unpublished cases\nholding that the ECFA merely clarifies the limits of the Portal-to-Portal exemptions.

Mar. 28, 1997). The Court disagrees with\nPlaintiffs’ analysis of the law. First, Plaintiff’s interpretation would render the ECFA\nmeaningless. The ECFA provides by its express terms that “the use of an employer’s vehicle\nfor travel by an employee and activities performed by an employee which are incidental to the\nuse of such vehicle for commuting shall not be considered part of the employee’s principal\nactivities.” 29 U.S.C. § 254(a) (emphasis added). Whether the addition of this language to the\nPortal-to-Portal Act created a new category of activities exempted from compensability, or\nmerely clarified that these activities were never intended to be compensable in the first place,\nis of no moment in the case at bar. Either way, with the enactment of the ECFA, Congress\nmade clear that activities within its scope are not compensable. See id.; see also H.R. REP . NO .\n585-104, at 5 (“Activities which are merely incidental to the use of an employer-provided\nvehicle for commuting at the beginning and end of the workday. . .need not be compensable.”\n(emphasis added)).\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        31\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 32   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nemployee is required to give up a substantial measure of his time and effort that\n\ncompensable working time is involved.” Id. “The de minimis rule provides that\n\nan employer, in recording working time, may disregard ‘insubstantial or\n\ninsignificant periods of time beyond the scheduled working hours, which cannot\n\nas a practical administrative matter be precisely recorded for payroll purposes.’”\n\nMireles v.

As detailed in the factual background above, under the HDP,\n\ntechnicians are required to log onto the SST in the morning to learn their first\n\nassignment.

After logging on and receiving the location of the day’s\n\nfirst service call, the technician is required to unplug the SST and carry it to the\n\nvan, where it is plugged into a docking station. The technician then commutes to\n\nthe first service call of the day, transporting any parts and supplies that are present\n\nin the van. At the end of the day, the technician unplugs the SST from the van,\n\ncarries it into his house, and plugs it into an electrical outlet and phone line so that\n\nit can automatically upload information regarding the current day’s service stops\n\nand download the next morning’s assignment overnight.\n\n\n\n\n            46\n          As noted above, Plaintiffs report, respectively, that their respective morning, off-the-\nclock activities took thirty and ten to twenty minutes.

Although the statute does not define “incidental,” the\n\nECFA’s legislative history makes clear that Congress intended these types of\n\nactivities to be non-compensable. As noted above, the House Report for the\n\nECFA stated that though it was not “possible to define in all circumstances what\n\nspecific tasks and activities would be considered ‘incidental’ to the use of an\n\nemployer’s vehicle for commuting[, c]ommunication between the employee and\n\nemployer to receive assignments, or instructions or to transmit advice on work\n\nprogress or completion, is required in order for these programs to exist.” H.R.\n\nREP. NO. 104-585 at 5. Here, the home use of the SST, both with regard to\n\nlogging in to receive the first assignment in the morning, and plugging it in so that\n\nassignment may be transmitted at night, is for communication with the employer\n\nin order to receive assignments.47\n\n\n       47\n          While it is true that plugging the SST into the phone line at the end of the day is also\nfor the purpose of uploading information about assignments completed during the current day,\nthe cited legislative history specifically contemplates that this type of activity would be non-\ncompensable. See H.R. REP . NO . 104-585 at 5 (“Communication between the employee and\nemployer to . . . transmit advice on work progress or completion, is required in order for\nthese programs to exist.”). In any event, it is necessary to plug the SST to receive the next\nday’s assignment, an activity that is clearly incidental to the commute.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd 110615.0932 38\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 39   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            Similarly, the House Report specifically states that “merely transporting\n\ntools or supplies should not change the noncompensable nature of the travel.” Id.\n\nThere is no evidence that transporting the parts and tools under the HDP increased\n\na technician’s commute times in any respect.\n\n            Because these activities relate to the employee’s commute, and not the\n\nprincipal activities of the employer, they are non-compensable.

See Rutti, 596 F.3d at 1057 (holding that morning activities\n\nincluding filling out paperwork were de minimis because there was “nothing to\n\nsuggest that this took more than a minute or so”). It would be administratively\n\ndifficult to keep track of this time because each individual SST-related activity is\n\nof such fleeting duration.48 Further, one cannot segregate time spent walking to\n\nand from the van in the morning and evening with the SST from merely\n\ncommuting, which is non-compensable.49\n\n\n            48\n         This conclusion assumes no computer problems that required technical specialists’\nintervention. If the specialists are necessary, Sears concurs that the technicians’ time is\ncompensable under the HDP.\n            49\n          Notably, plugging the SST into a phone line and electrical outlet at the end of the day\nis not like the end of day transmissions in Rutti, which were also performed at the employee’s\nhome. There, the technicians were required to upload information about work performed\nduring the day by plugging a portable data terminal into a modem provided the company.\nRutti, 596 F.3d at 1057. The technicians were required to check to ensure that the\ntransmission was complete, and there was evidence that it often took more than one attempt.\nId. at 1050. Further, the technicians were not to transmit within ten minutes before or after\nthe turn of the hour because the corporate computer system reset itself at that time. Id. at\n1050. Technicians were instructed to wait an hour if they encountered technical difficulties\nbefore trying again. Id. If transmission was still unsuccessful after two attempts, the\ntechnicians were instructed to call the host computer and document the problems.

The daily SST activities and transportation of parts and tools are not\n\ncompensable.\n\n            Placing Replenishment Parts in the Van.— Under the HDP, Sears sent\n\nreplenishment parts by UPS to technicians’ homes. The technicians were directed\n\nto place the boxes into the van, outside the workday because this task must be\n\nperformed when the vans are at technicians’ homes. Technicians may, however,\n\nload the boxes at a time of their choosing. The technicians specifically are\n\ninstructed, however, not to unpack the boxes or sort the parts outside of the\n\nworkday.50 In fact, this instruction was “stamped right on the box” in which the\n\ntools were sent.51\n\n            This loading task (which is short in duration) appears to be incidental to the\n\nuse of Sears’ vans for the commute, because loading of supplies is “required in\n\n            49\n              (...continued)\n            In the case at bar, Sears does not require technicians to monitor the SST after they\n            plug it in as the technicians were required to do in Rutti. On the record presented, it\n            appears that if any problems arise with the SST, they arise in the morning when the\n            technician attempts to log in. Unlike in Rutti, to the extent a technician had to spend\n            an appreciable amount of time troubleshooting the SST, he was compensated for this\n            effort under the HDP.\n            50\n                 Chambers Deposition, at 48; Werchan Deposition, at 77-78.\n            51\n                 Chambers Deposition, at 48.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        41\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012       Page: 42   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                         No. 10-20360\n\norder for [the HDP] to exist.” See H.R. REP. NO. 104-585 at 5. Even if not\n\nincidental, the Court holds that the time it takes for a technician to place boxes of\n\nreplenishment parts into his van is de minimis. Both Plaintiffs testified that they\n\nreceived the boxes of parts sporadically. Chambers testified that he mostly\n\nreceived shipments once or twice a week.52 Werchan testified that the frequency\n\nof shipments varied, but that he might get two or three deliveries a week.53\n\nPlaintiffs cite to no evidence indicating that placing the boxes in the vans was\n\nparticularly difficult or required more than a couple of minutes at most. It would\n\nalso be administratively difficult to track the amount of time technicians spent\n\nplacing unopened boxes of parts in their vans a couple of times per week. This is\n\nespecially true since technicians were allowed to place the boxes in the vans at\n\ntheir leisure, including during the morning walk to the van that was already\n\nnecessary to begin the commute, a non-compensable event. The periodic\n\nplacement of boxes of parts in the service vans under the HDP is not compensable\n\nunder FLSA.\n\n                                    c.

Both Plaintiffs allege that they removed trash from the van in the\n\nmorning, conducted pre- and post-trip vehicle safety inspections, ensured that the\n\nvan was neat and tidy in the evening, unpacked and sorted parts, prepared and\n\ntransmitted end of day reports via the SST, ensured that customer payments are\n\nproperly accounted for, made bank deposits, and placed credit card receipts and\n\nother paperwork in envelopes and mailed them to Sears.54 Werchan also claims\n\n\n\n\n            54\n            Plaintiffs assert in their affidavits, without any support or detail, that they were “required” to\nperform the listed activities either before or after work, or both. As set forth above, the evidence of record\nestablishes that, under the HDP rules, the activities to which Plaintiffs refer were not to be performed off-the-\nclock.

For example, Plaintiffs acknowledged in their depositions that they were instructed not to\nunpack and sort replenishment parts outside the workday, Chambers Deposition, at 48; Werchan Deposition,\nat 77-78, and thus implicitly concede that this was the HDP policy. Another example is that the SST Help\nManual is clear that banking and mailing envelopes is to be done during the workday after arriving at the first\ncustomer’s location. SST Help Manual [Doc. # 42-6], at SW2918, SW2922. Plaintiffs do not directly\ncontrovert this evidence. They assert instead in their affidavits that they had “no choice” but to perform such\nactivities off-the-clock because of pressure to complete as many service calls during the day as possible.\nChambers Affidavit, ¶ 19; Werchan Affidavit, ¶ 18. This assertion of rules violations does not address the\npending issue of whether Sears knew of their alleged off-the-clock work.\n\n            In any event, Plaintiffs’ averments that various activities were “required” to be performed outside\n            the workday is a bald conclusory assertion that does not create a genuine issue of fact that Sears in\n            fact required such tasks in this fashion.

Instead, Plaintiffs argue circumstantially that Sears had constructive\n\nknowledge that they were working off-the-clock because the stated purpose of the\n\nHDP was to decrease the amount of time technicians spend on clerical and non-\n\nvalue added tasks and to maximize the number of service calls made per day.\n\n\n\n\n            55\n          It is not clear from the record whether refueling the service van, performing vehicle\nsafety inspections, and tidying up the van, were occasionally to be performed off-the-clock\nunder the HDP. In any event, these activities are clearly incidental to the commute under the\nECFA and thus non-compensable. See H.R. REP . NO . 104-585 at 5 (“routine vehicle safety inspections\nor other minor tasks have long been considered preliminary or postliminary activities and are therefore not\ncompensable.”). These activities are also de minimis. Cf.

The fact that Sears encouraged workers to be\n\nefficient does not constitute evidence of Sears’ knowledge of Plaintiffs’\n\nperformance of specific tasks or practices. This is evidence, at best, of a motive\n\nfor Sears’ creation of the HDP. The motive simply does not raise a genuine issue\n\nof material fact that Sears had actual or constructive knowledge that Plaintiffs in\n\nfact were performing work outside the workday.\n\n            Similarly, Chambers’ averment that he was reprimanded for not completing\n\nenough service calls per day does not suffice to raise a fact issue that his\n\nsupervisors had actual or constructive knowledge that his solution to this issue\n\nwas to work off-the-clock.56\n\n            Plaintiff Werchan has produced some evidence he claims shows that Sears\n\nknew that, prior to the start of the workday, he placed phone calls to the first\n\ncustomer of the day. Specifically, Werchan points to a document he claims Sears\n\nprovided to him stating “Technician needs to ‘Call Ahead.’ If customer is not at\n\nhome, the technician needs to run the call.”57 This instruction does not establish\n\n\n            56\n                 See Chambers Affidavit, ¶ 20.\n            57\n                 Werchan Affidavit II, at 3.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        45\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 46   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\nthat Werchan or any technician was instructed to call the first customer of the day\n\nprior to arriving at the customer’s address. However, Werchan also testified that\n\nhe informed his manager that he was calling the first customer of the day either\n\nbefore or during his drive.58 The Court deems Werchan to have raised a genuine\n\nissue of material fact that Sears was aware that he made these phone calls off-the-\n\nclock.\n\n            The Court nevertheless concludes that any “call ahead” phone calls are not\n\ncompensable under the FLSA. First, calling the first customer of the day to\n\nconfirm an appointment is arguably incidental to the commute under the ECFA.\n\nThis task is analogous to an employee communicating with an employer to receive\n\nthe assignment in the first place, i.e., the call confirms the employee’s travel\n\ndirectly from home to the customer’s location. Alternatively, to the extent that\n\nthis activity is not incidental to the commute and instead is integral and\n\nindispensable to a principal work activity of a technician, the time required for\n\nthese calls is de minimis. There is no evidence that making a phone call each day\n\nto confirm an appointment would take more than a minute or so, if that. It would\n\nbe difficult to record this time under any circumstances, but particularly where\n\nWerchan apparently often performed this task during his commute.

Plaintiffs’ Other Theories of Relief Under FLSA\n\n            Plaintiffs also argue that even if the morning and evening commutes as well\n\nas other off-the-clock activities are non-compensable under the ECFA, they may\n\nnevertheless be compensable based on “custom or practice” at the employer’s\n\nestablishment, the “continuous workday rule,” or as “wait time” or “on-call” time.\n\nThe Court addresses each contention in turn.\n\n                                    a.           Custom or Practice\n\n            Plaintiffs argue that their commutes and other off-the-clock activities under\n\nthe HDP are compensable because of “custom or practice” in effect at the\n\nemployer’s establishment. Subsection (b) of the Portal-to-Portal Act provides that\n\neven if an activity would be exempted from compensability under subsection (a),\n\nan employer will still be liable for the activity if it is compensable because of\n\n            a custom or practice in effect, at the time of such activity, at the\n            establishment or other place where such employee is employed,\n            covering such activity, not inconsistent with a written or nonwritten\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932           47\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 48   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            contract, in effect at the time of such activity, between such\n            employee, his agent, or collective-bargaining representative and his\n            employer.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 254(b)(2). Plaintiffs argue that prior to the implementation of the\n\nHDP in 2001, Sears compensated technicians for their morning and evening\n\ncommutes as well as certain activities performed prior to and after the service\n\nrun.59 Accordingly, they contend, these activities are still compensable as a\n\ncustom or practice.\n\n            Plaintiffs’ custom or practice contention is unavailing. The custom or\n\npractice to which the statute refers must be in effect at the time of the activity for\n\nwhich the plaintiff employee seeks compensation. Id. § 254(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. §\n\n790.11 (“the compensability of [an activity alleged to be compensable by custom\n\nor practice], and its inclusion in computation of hours worked, is not determinable\n\nby a custom or practice which had been terminated before the activity was\n\nengaged in . . .”). The undisputed evidence shows that the HDP was implemented\n\nin 2001, and that approximately 90 percent of technicians have participated. It is\n\nalso undisputed that, under the HDP, Sears has not compensated its technicians for\n\ntheir morning or evening commutes or for the other activities noted by Plaintiffs.\n\nIndeed, this is the very essence of Plaintiffs’ claims. It is apparent also that Sears,\n\n            59\n                 Chambers Response, at 25-26.

In Dooley, the District of Massachusetts held that,\n\nunder the continuous workday rule, home-based appraisers’ commutes to and from\n\nthe first and last customer calls of the day were compensable if the appraisers\n\nperformed principal activities, such as checking email and voice mail, preparing\n\ntheir computers for use, and returning telephone calls, before leaving home for the\n\nfirst assignment of the day and after returning home from the last assignment\n\nrespectively.

Section 785.15 of Title\n\n29 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides that “periods during which an\n\nemployee is completely relieved from duty and which are long enough to enable\n\nhim to use the time effectively for his own purposes are not hours worked.”62\n\nWhile the HDP requires that employees spend time troubleshooting the SST under\n\ncertain circumstances, Plaintiffs have adduced no evidence that technicians are\n\nrequired to perform this activity at a particular time. Rather, there is only a\n\nrequirement that technicians try to arrive at the first service call by 8:00 a.m., at\n\nwhich time the technician is to “clock in” on the SST.

As mentioned, the Ninth Circuit held in\n\nthat case that a home-based technician’s commutes in a company car to and from\n\nhis first and last service calls of the day were not compensable. The Rutti court\n\nheld, however, that a fact question existed as to the compensability of one of the\n\ntechnician’s post evening-commute activities—completing a transmission from a\n\nhandheld computer. Id. at 1058-59. However, the court held that this activity,\n\neven if compensable, would not extend the workday to encompass the technician’s\n\ncommute home. Id. at 1060-61. Noting that the technician at issue was merely\n\nrequired to send the transmission at some point between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.,\n\nand that he was “completely relieved from duty the moment he completed his last\n\nservice stop of the day,” the court held that the technician was effectively able to\n\nuse the time after his last stop for his own purposes and the continuous workday\n\n\n\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        52\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012      Page: 53   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                        No. 10-20360\n\nrule thus did not extend the workday to include the commute home.

The\nDooley court found that the appraisers before it engaged in numerous principal activities at\nhome that resulted in “the first and last trip of the day. . . not [being] a commute in the\nordinary sense of the word—it is a trip between their office, where administrative work is\nperformed, and an off-site work location.” Dooley, 307 F.Supp.2d at 245.

As set forth above, the only compensable activity performed there\nis the occasional troubleshooting of the SST.\n           64\n         A 1999 DOL Opinion Letter is consistent with this interpretation: “Communication\nbetween the employee and the employer at home or in a hotel with respect to assignments,\ninstructions, work progress or completion would not, per se, affect the compensability of travel\ntime.” U.S. Dep’t Lab.

An employee is\n\nengaged to wait, and thus must be compensated, when he is unable to use waiting\n\ntime “effectively for his own purposes,” and the time “belongs to and is controlled\n\nby the employer.” Id. § 785.15; see also Vega, 36 F.3d at 425 (“waiting time is\n\ncompensable if the wait predominantly benefits the employer”) (citing Mireles v.\n\nFrio Foods, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539190\"><a href=\"/opinion/539190/maria-mireles-cross-appellees-v-frio-foods-inc-cross-appellant/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1411 (5th Cir. 1990)). Plaintiffs contend that\n\ntechnicians are “engaged to wait” during their morning and evening commutes\n\nunder the HDP because they cannot use that time effectively for their own\n\npurposes. They argue that this time belongs to and is controlled by Sears. In\n\nsupport of this argument, Plaintiffs rehash their complaints regarding the\n\nconditions placed on employees’ use of the company’s vans discussed above.\nH:\\shared\\OPCLERK\\NPOP\\10-20360.0.wpd   110615.0932        54\n\f    Case: 10-20360                      Document: 00511509012    Page: 55   Date Filed: 06/15/2011\n\n\n\n\n                                                      No. 10-20360\n\n            This argument is rejected. “Wait time is compensable when it is part of a\n\nprincipal activity of the employee, but not if it is a preliminary or postliminary\n\nactivity.” Vega, 36 F.3d at 425 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 254). As noted,\n\nnotwithstanding Sears’ restrictions on employees’ use of the vans, commutes of up\n\nto thirty-five minutes under the HDP fit within the ECFA’s exclusion for an\n\nemployee’s commute in a company vehicle and the exclusion for activities\n\nincidental to use of that vehicle for the commute. Accordingly, these commute\n\nperiods are not principal activities and are thus not compensable as “wait time”\n\nunder FLSA. See id.\n\n            Plaintiffs’ argument that the commutes are compensable because of\n\nregulations pertaining to “on-call time” also fails. “An employee who is required\n\nto remain on call on the employer’s premises or so close thereto that he cannot use\n\nthe time effectively for his own purposes is working while ‘on call.’” 29 C.F.R. §\n\n785.17. Plaintiffs again argue that technicians cannot use their commute time\n\neffectively for their own purposes because of the restrictions placed on the use of\n\nthe company vans. As stated above, this argument fails because the morning and\n\nevening commutes under the HDP comply with the ECFA and are thus non-\n\ncompensable. Moreover, Plaintiffs cite no evidence that the technicians are, in\n\nfact, on-call for work for Sears during the employees’ commute times.

Because the Court reaches the merits of\nChambers TMWA contention, it need not resolve the pleading dispute.\n            67\n         Similarly, the Texas Payday Law applies only to employees who are “exempt from\nthe overtime pay provisions of the [FLSA].” TX .
