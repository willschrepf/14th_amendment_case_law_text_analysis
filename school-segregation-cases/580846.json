INTRODUCTION\n               A mother appeals the termination of her parental rights to her child. She\nchallenges the superior court’s rulings that: (1) the child was a child in need of aid under\n\fAS 47.10.011; (2) she failed to remedy the conduct that placed the child in need of aid;\n(3) the Office of Children’s Services (OCS) made reasonable efforts to reunify the\nfamily; and (4) termination of her parental rights was in the child’s best interests.1\nBecause all of the superior court’s rulings are supported by the record, we affirm the\ncourt’s decision to terminate the mother’s parental rights.\nII.   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n             Cheyenne C.2 was born to Casey K. and Cash C. in May 2005. Cash was\nviolent toward Casey; at least once during their relationship he was convicted of\nviolating a domestic violence protective order. Casey and Cash initially tried to raise\nCheyenne together, but they split up in 2009 or 2010 and began sharing custody of\nCheyenne on an informal, unscheduled basis. Neither parent established a stable home,\nand Cheyenne moved frequently among temporary living situations.\n             On September 9, 2010, OCS received a report of concern involving\n“[a]llegations of parental substance abuse and neglect” of Cheyenne, but the report was\nscreened out because the family could not be located. Less than two weeks later, OCS\nreceived another report that was similar in nature. This time, OCS was able to locate the\nfamily and opened an investigation.\n             OCS social worker Cathy Gray conducted interviews with Cheyenne, Cash,\nand Casey as part of OCS’s investigation. Gray reported that Cheyenne “stated her\nmother smokes [marijuana] in front of her.” Casey admitted to occasionally smoking\nmarijuana but denied ever using in front of her daughter. Gray requested that Cash,\nCasey, and Casey’s boyfriend (with whom she was living at the time) complete\n\n      1\n              Although the superior court’s decision also terminated the father’s parental\nrights, he did not appeal; thus we address only the termination of the mother’s parental\nrights.\n      2\n             Pseudonyms are used for the family to protect their privacy.\n\n                                           -2-                                      6837\n\furinalysis (UA) tests, but none of them complied. OCS continued to receive reports that\nboth parents were using drugs and that Cheyenne lacked a stable living situation.\n             In November 2010 Cash was arrested while Cheyenne was with him. The\narresting officer contacted Casey’s mother, Brenda, and one of Cash’s friends dropped\nCheyenne off at Brenda’s house. Brenda tried to locate Casey but was unable to do so,\nand OCS was notified of Cash’s arrest. Rather than take immediate legal custody of\nCheyenne, OCS worked out a safety plan with Casey whereby Cheyenne would remain\nin Brenda’s care and Casey would submit UA test results to verify her sobriety. Casey\nunderwent four of the scheduled UAs: the first two did not produce a sample; the third\ntested positive for THC; and the fourth tested negative for all substances.\n             OCS took legal custody of Cheyenne on December 10, 2010, and Cheyenne\nremained in Brenda’s care. At a contested probable cause hearing OCS explained why\nit had concluded that Cheyenne was a child in need of aid. OCS stated it was concerned\nabout Casey’s and Cash’s drug use, their lack of stable housing, Casey’s ongoing\nrelationships with alleged drug dealers and perpetrators of domestic violence, and\nCheyenne’s possible exposure to domestic violence. OCS also asserted that Cheyenne\nhad missed eight days of school by the third week of September while in Cash’s and\nCasey’s care, though it was unclear whether the missed days occurred when Cheyenne\nwas with Cash or with Casey.\n             Brenda also testified that Cheyenne was exhibiting troubling behaviors. For\nexample, soon after Cheyenne moved in with her, Brenda discovered that Cheyenne kept\na bag under her bed with a change of clothes, stuffed animals, and food. Cheyenne\nreferred to this bag as her “getaway bag” and explained to Brenda that she kept it in case\nshe had to leave quickly, because when she was with Cash or Casey she sometimes had\nto leave places in the middle of the night and never knew whether she would return.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-                                      6837\n\n\fBrenda also noted that Cheyenne was hoarding items, such as half-eaten candies and\nscraps of paper.\n             The superior court found that probable cause existed to believe Cheyenne\nwas a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.011(8)(b)(ii) (domestic violence) and\nAS 47.10.011(9) (neglect) and granted OCS temporary custody.3 Cheyenne stayed in\nBrenda’s care, where she has remained ever since.\n             In January 2011 OCS established a case plan requiring Casey to complete\nrandom UAs twice a week, obtain a substance abuse assessment and follow treatment\nrecommendations, enroll in a domestic violence program and follow all\nrecommendations, visit Cheyenne regularly, and maintain safe and stable housing. OCS\nagreed to pay for UA testing, substance abuse assessments, all necessary referrals, and\ntransportation costs.\n             OCS case worker Brooke Antonich, who was assigned to the case in March\n2011, did not have contact information for Casey and “pretty much just didn’t know\nwhere she was or how to get a hold of her.” In May 2011 Casey visited the OCS office\nand left a note with a phone number, but Casey did not answer when Antonich tried to\ncall, and the voice mailbox was full. Casey visited the office again the following month\nand left another note with a different phone number, and Antonich was able to make\ncontact after leaving several messages.\n             Casey was incarcerated on criminal impersonation charges for just over a\nweek in June and July 2011. Soon after her release she met with Antonich to discuss her\ncase plan for the first time. After the meeting Casey set up an appointment for a\nsubstance abuse evaluation with a treatment program, but OCS failed to timely submit\n\n\n\n      3\n             The superior court also found probable cause under AS 47.10.011(10)\n(substance abuse), but this finding pertained only to Cash.\n\n                                          -4-                                     6837\n\frequired collateral information to the assessor. Lacking the collateral information, the\nassessor relied exclusively on Casey’s self-reporting during the evaluation and concluded\nthat Casey did not need any substance abuse treatment. OCS sent the required collateral\ninformation about three weeks after the July 21, 2011 evaluation, but an updated\nevaluation was not available until March 2012, due in part to OCS’s delay.\n               As part of Casey’s case plan OCS arranged for Casey to visit Cheyenne at\nBrenda’s house at least twice a week. Casey’s visits were sporadic: a visitation log\nrevealed that Casey was late or failed to show up for nearly two-thirds of the visits from\nSeptember to November 2011, and Brenda testified this was typical behavior for Casey.\nCasey also failed to show up to two meetings with Antonich in October and November,\nand Antonich rarely knew where Casey was living. Casey’s participation in the random\nUA testing program was equally minimal: Antonich testified that Casey only completed\ntwo or three UAs during OCS’s involvement in the case over the span of two years even\nthough random UA testing was always part of her case plan.\n               Casey was convicted of eluding a peace officer and incarcerated for over\na month during December 2011 and January 2012. Casey made efforts to adhere to her\ncase plan while incarcerated, completing a parenting class offered by the corrections\nsystem.    However, Brenda did not bring Cheyenne to see Casey while she was\nincarcerated because of a mental health provider’s recommendation and earlier\ndiscussions with Cash and Casey in which they all agreed that Cheyenne would never\nvisit either parent in jail.\n               After her release Casey started attending domestic violence education\nclasses, and Antonich noted “an improvement” in Casey’s progress as her visits with\nCheyenne became more consistent. Casey met with Antonich to discuss her case plan\nagain in March 2012, and Antonich updated the case plan. Casey informed Antonich\nthat she had yet to secure an apartment for herself, but she was staying with her father\n\n                                           -5-                                      6837\n\n\fand intended to move into her own apartment soon. Antonich never heard anything\nfurther about the apartment, however, and she was unable to locate Casey at her father’s\nhouse or elsewhere. Casey spoke with Antonich again in April, but she was unable to\nprovide Antonich with her contact information. Antonich also expressed concern that\nalthough Casey had nearly completed the domestic violence education classes, she\ncontinued to associate with past partners who had been accused of committing domestic\nviolence.\n             Casey was again arrested and incarcerated in April 2012, this time for\nattempting to falsify a UA by using a device containing another person’s urine. Casey\nwas convicted of tampering with physical evidence and sentenced to two years’\nimprisonment, with one year suspended. Casey was housed in segregation in the\ncorrectional facility because she allegedly attempted to escape from a pre-trial detention\nfacility. As a result, Casey was unable to take advantage of the substance abuse,\ndomestic violence, anger management, and parenting programs offered by the\ncorrections system. According to her probation officer, Casey was also “written up . . .\nfor various incidents” of misconduct while incarcerated. At the time of the termination\ntrial, Casey was still incarcerated and housed in segregation, and the escape allegations\nwere still under investigation.\n             Although Cheyenne did not visit Casey at the jail, Casey saw her daughter\nwhen she was released on a temporary furlough to attend a family funeral in July. That\nvisit went well, and Casey was very attentive to Cheyenne. Casey also wrote letters to\nCheyenne from prison and spoke to her by phone on one occasion. But phone\ncommunication had to be arranged by OCS because Casey was housed in segregation,\nand it is unclear whether Casey requested OCS to arrange for additional phone visitation.\n             The superior court held a termination trial in November 2012, nearly two\nyears after OCS took legal custody of Cheyenne. Antonich testified that it would be in\n\n                                           -6-                                      6837\n\n\fCheyenne’s best interests to be freed for adoption by her grandparents. Antonich\nexpressed concern that it would take at least six to eight months after Casey’s release\nfrom prison before Casey and Cheyenne could be reunified, and she did not think it was\nappropriate “to delay [Cheyenne’s] permanency any longer.”\n             Casey testified to why her parental rights should not be terminated. Casey\nstated that she expected to be released in December, at which time she intended to move\nin with her family, go back to work, obtain a college degree, and follow her case plan so\nshe could regain custody. When asked whether her parental rights should be terminated,\nCasey responded, “I know that I wasn’t as serious as I should have been before, and I —\nit’s my own fault for not doing all of it like I should have. But I believe I deserve\nanother chance, at least another six months to get everything done.” Casey also stated\nshe believed it would take her no more than six months to achieve stability.\n             Brenda testified that Cheyenne knew her and her husband as her primary\ncaregivers, and she agreed that it would not be in Cheyenne’s best interests to “stay in\nlimbo” by putting the termination decision off for another year or so while Casey and\nCash worked on their case plans. Brenda acknowledged that the termination decision\nwas “really, really hard” and stated that she fully intended to encourage Cheyenne to\nmaintain relationships with her birth parents.\n             At the conclusion of the termination trial Superior Court Judge Eric Smith\nissued oral findings, which were followed the next month by a written order terminating\nCasey’s parental rights. The superior court found by clear and convincing evidence that\nCheyenne was a child in need of aid pursuant to AS 47.10.011(1) (abandonment), (9)\n(neglect), and (10) (substance abuse).4 The court found that Casey had done “very little\n\n\n\n      4\n            The superior court also found Cheyenne to be a child in need of aid under\nAS 47.10.011(2) (incarceration), but this finding pertained only to Cash.\n\n                                           -7-                                     6837\n\fon her case plan”; that “there was ample and credible testimony of neglect of [Cheyenne]\nwhile she was living with her folks due to the drug use and the lifestyles that were\ninduced by the drug use, as well as the fact that both parents have been . . . unavailable\nto [Cheyenne] because they were incarcerated due to their drug use”; and that Casey had\nan “ongoing substance abuse addiction.”\n              The superior court also found by clear and convincing evidence that Casey\nhad not “remedied the conduct or conditions in the home that put the child at substantial\nrisk of harm,” and that OCS “made timely and reasonable efforts as required by\nAS 47.10.086 to effectuate reunification between the parents and the child . . . .” Finally,\nthe superior court found by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of Casey’s\nparental rights was in Cheyenne’s best interests.\n              Casey appeals from the termination order.\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              In a child in need of aid (CINA) termination proceeding we review a\nsuperior court’s factual findings for clear error.5 Factual findings “are clearly erroneous\nif review of the entire record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake\nhas been made.”6 “Conflicting evidence is generally insufficient to overturn the superior\ncourt, and we will not reweigh evidence when the record provides clear support for the\nsuperior court’s ruling.”7 “Whether a child is in need of aid and whether the parent failed\n\n\n       5\n             Christina J. v.

DISCUSSION\n                In order to terminate parental rights under AS 47.10.088, a superior court\nmust find by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) a child is in need of aid under at\nleast one of the subsections listed in AS 47.10.011; (2) the parent has not remedied the\nconduct or conditions that caused the child to be in need of aid or that returning the child\nto the parent would put the child at substantial risk of physical or mental injury; and (3)\nOCS has made reasonable efforts to provide family support services to the child and to\nthe parent.12    The court must also find by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       (...continued)\nomitted).\n       8\n             Id.

Servs., Office of Children’s\nServs., 290 P.3d 421, 428 (Alaska 2012).\n       10\n                Id.\n       11\n                J.S. v.

Casey does not appeal the superior court’s finding that\nCheyenne was a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.011(9) (neglect) or (10) (substance\nabuse); she appeals only the court’s finding that she abandoned Cheyenne under\nAS 47.10.011(1). But only one statutory basis is required for a CINA finding. See G.C.\nv. State, Dep’t of Health & Soc. Servs., Div. of Family & Youth Servs., 67 P.3d 648, 651\n(Alaska 2003) (affirming superior court’s finding that child was in need of aid under\nAS 47.10.011(1) and declining to review the court’s findings under AS 47.10.011(2) or\n(9) or AS 25.23.180(c)(3), “since one statutory basis is sufficient for finding a child to\nbe in need of aid in a termination proceeding”). Casey has therefore waived any\nchallenge to the superior court’s finding that Cheyenne was a child in need of aid. See\nAlyssa B. v. State, Dep’t of Health & Soc.

Casey repeatedly failed to participate in the UA testing program required by\nher case plan; Antonich testified that Casey only completed two or three UAs during\nOCS’s nearly two-year involvement in the case even though random UA testing was\nalways part of her case plan.16 These missed UAs counted against Casey as failed UAs.\nMoreover, as late as several months before the termination trial, Casey attempted to\nfalsify a UA. Casey’s substance abuse directly resulted in her current incarceration,\nwhich itself prevented Casey from having in-person contact with her daughter. The\nsuperior court did not clearly err in finding that Cheyenne was a child in need of aid\nunder AS 47.10.011(10) and, as we explained above, Casey does not contest this finding\non appeal.\n              Because we affirm the superior court’s finding that Casey’s substance abuse\nissues placed her child in need of aid under AS 47.10.011(10), we need not consider\nwhether the superior court’s findings that Cheyenne was a child in need of aid under the\nother subsections of AS 47.10.011 were clearly erroneous.17\n\n\n\n       15\n            David S. v.

It is unclear whether Antonich’s statement about the number of UAs Casey\ncompleted took into account only those UAs Casey completed after her case plan was\ncreated or whether Antonich did not include those UAs that did not produce a sample.\nEither way, the record demonstrates that Casey’s participation in the random UA testing\nprogram was minimal.\n       17\n              See G.C., 67 P.3d at 651.\n\n                                           -11-                                     6837\n\n\f       B.\t    The Superior Court Did Not Err In Finding That Casey Did Not\n              Remedy Her Substance Abuse Issues In A Reasonable Amount Of\n              Time.\n              In order to terminate parental rights, the superior court must find by clear\nand convincing evidence that the parent has failed, within a reasonable time, to remedy\nthe conduct that placed the child at substantial risk of harm.18           In making this\ndetermination, the court may consider “any fact relating to the best interests of the child,”\nincluding: (1) the likelihood of returning the child to the parent within a reasonable time\nbased on the child’s age or needs; (2) the amount of effort by the parent to remedy the\nconduct or the conditions in the home; (3) the harm caused to the child; (4) the likelihood\nthat the harmful conduct will continue; and (5) the history of conduct by or conditions\ncreated by the parent.19 “The superior court is entitled to rely on a parent’s documented\nhistory of conduct as a predictor of future behavior.”20\n              In finding there was clear and convincing evidence that Casey had not\nremedied the conduct or conditions in the home that put Cheyenne at substantial risk of\nharm, the superior court cited Casey’s failure to complete substance abuse treatment, her\nfailure to comply with her probation program, and her lack of “concrete plans” following\nher release from prison.      Casey argues she made “substantial progress” toward\nremedying her conduct and, but for OCS’s failure to provide the collateral information\nfor her substance abuse evaluation, she would have done so within a reasonable amount\nof time.

OCS contends that “[w]ere it not for\nCasey’s seven-month failure to engage, sporadic contacts with OCS, continued pattern\nof poor decision-making, and commission of criminal acts leading to incarceration and\nsegregation, she would have had ample time to complete substance abuse treatment and\ndemonstrate sobriety within the two years preceding the termination trial.”\n             Casey exaggerates the extent to which she complied with her case plan. As\ndescribed above, Casey made no efforts to participate in her case plan or remedy her\nconduct for the first seven months after OCS took custody of Cheyenne, and Antonich\ntestified that she was unable to get in contact with Casey for a four-month period when\nshe was first assigned to the case. Casey completed only two to four UAs during the\nentire period of OCS’s involvement even though random UA testing was always\nrequired by her case plan. All of her missed or incomplete UAs were properly\nconsidered failed UAs. And although Casey’s progress improved in early 2012, she was\nagain incarcerated in April 2012, this time for conduct directly related to her substance\naddictions: Casey attempted to falsify her UA test result by substituting another person’s\nurine for her own. At the time of the termination trial, Casey was still incarcerated,\nhoused in segregation, and had an unknown release date.\n             Casey properly notes that OCS’s failure to timely provide required\ncollateral information to the substance abuse treatment assessor prevented her from\nreceiving an accurate substance abuse evaluation for eight months. Although this failure\nmay have made it more difficult for Casey to receive immediate treatment for her\nsubstance abuse issues, it did not preclude her from remedying her substance abuse\nproblems within a reasonable time. Cheyenne had been in OCS’s custody for nearly two\nyears at the time of the parental rights termination trial, and yet Casey remained\n\n                                          -13-                                      6837\n\n\fincarcerated with an unknown release date. Moreover, Casey received the accurate\nsubstance abuse evaluation in March 2012, yet she was incarcerated for tampering with\na UA device a month later.21\n             The record suggests that although Casey made some progress toward\nremedying her conduct for a two-month period in the spring of 2012, her overall efforts\nover the nearly two-year period of OCS’s involvement were minimal and sporadic. The\nsuperior court did not clearly err in finding that Casey failed to remedy her conduct in\na reasonable time.\n      C.\t    The Superior Court Did Not Err In Finding That OCS Made\n             Reasonable Efforts To Reunify Casey With Cheyenne.\n             Casey challenges the superior court’s finding that OCS made reasonable\nefforts to reunify her with Cheyenne, arguing there is insufficient evidence in the record\nto support this finding. Before terminating parental rights, the court must find by clear\nand convincing evidence that OCS has made reasonable efforts to effectuate reunification\nbetween the parent and the child.22 Alaska Statute 47.10.086 requires OCS to “make\ntimely, reasonable efforts to provide family support services to the child and to the\nparents or guardian of the child that are designed to prevent out-of-home placement of\nthe child or to enable the safe return of the child to the family home, when appropriate,\nif the child is in an out-of-home placement.”23 As part of these “reasonable efforts,” OCS\nmust identify, “actively offer,” and refer the parent to family support services that will\n\n\n      21\n             We also note that the treatment assessor’s initial assessment of Casey was\nbased exclusively on information which Casey provided. Thus, to the extent the provider\nerroneously concluded that Casey did not need treatment, this error was presumably\ncaused by Casey’s own misstatements in her self-reporting.\n      22\n             AS 47.10.088(a)(3).\n      23\n             AS 47.10.086(a).\n\n                                          -14-\t                                     6837\n\n\fassist him or her in remedying the conduct or conditions in the home that made the child\na child in need of aid.24 OCS must also document its actions.25 When making\ndeterminations under AS 47.10.086, “the primary consideration is the child’s best\ninterests.”26\n                “The efforts that OCS makes must be reasonable but need not be perfect.”27\nWe have recognized that OCS maintains “some discretion in determining what efforts\nto pursue and whether the timing is reasonable.”28 Additionally, “[a] parent’s willingness\nto participate in services is relevant to the scope of the efforts OCS must provide.”29\n                The superior court found that OCS’s efforts included the development of\nan initial safety plan; the development of case plans; referrals for UAs and substance\nabuse assessments; provision of funds for UAs and assessments; the establishment of an\n“open and liberal” visitation schedule; and the provision of programs by the Department\nof Corrections (DOC) while Casey was incarcerated. The court further found that OCS\n“provided extensive services for the child and there was ongoing contact between [OCS]\nand the parents including phone calls, attempted phone calls to return the parents’ calls\n\n\n         24\n                Id.\n         25\n                Id.\n         26\n                AS 47.10.086(f).\n         27\n                Audrey H. v.

This three-week\noversight resulted in Casey having to wait for eight months to receive an accurate\nsubstance abuse evaluation. But the reasonableness of OCS’s efforts must be viewed “in\nlight of the entire history of services” provided,30 and we have repeatedly held that a brief\nlapse in OCS’s provision of services does not foreclose a finding that OCS made\nreasonable efforts toward reunification.31 Thus, OCS’s delay in providing the collateral\ninformation to the substance abuse evaluators did not in itself render OCS’s efforts\nunreasonable.

Casey completed a parenting program offered\nby DOC when she was first incarcerated, but she was unable to take advantage of this\nor other programs during her most recent incarceration because she was housed in\nsegregation due to her alleged escape attempt.36 Thus, the “practical circumstances” of\nCasey’s situation had a “direct bearing” on the services OCS and DOC could offer her.37\nCheyenne did not visit Casey while she was incarcerated, but this lack of visitation was\nagain due to the parties’ consensus that it would be unhealthy for Cheyenne to visit the\njail. And although OCS only arranged one phone call between Casey and Cheyenne\nwhile Casey was housed in segregation, the parties disputed whether Casey requested\nincreased phone contact.\n             Finally, Casey’s own lack of participation in the services offered by OCS\nsupports the superior court’s finding that OCS made reasonable efforts toward\nreunification.38 As described above, Casey consistently failed to follow her case plan\n\n      35\n             A.A. v.

The court found that Cheyenne needed permanency, which\nCasey was unable to provide to her; that there was no evidence that Casey was going to\nchange her behavior, and “without change, the best predictor of future behavior is past\nbehavior”; that once released, it would take Casey up to two years to prove her sobriety\nand stability; and that it was not in Cheyenne’s best interests “to give [Casey] an\nunlimited amount of time to remedy the harm [she] pose[d]” to Cheyenne.\n             Casey argues that “[c]onsidering the bond between mother and child, the\n\n      38\n        (...continued)\nServs., Div. of Family & Youth Servs., 66 P.3d 1, 8 (Alaska 2003).\n      39\n             AS 47.10.088(c); CINA Rule 18(c)(3).\n      40\n             AS 47.10.088(b).\n      41\n            Sean B. v.

But Casey again\nmischaracterizes the extent to which she complied with her case plan and the extent to\nwhich OCS’s failure to provide the collateral information for her substance abuse\nevaluation impeded her progress. As described above, Casey failed to participate in or\neven discuss her case plan for the first seven months of OCS’s involvement, and her\nparticipation remained sporadic and minimal for the next six or seven months. Casey\ncomplied with some aspects of her case plan for two months in the spring of 2012, but\nshe was incarcerated soon after. Casey stated that she thought she would be released in\nDecember 2012, just a month after the termination trial, and once released it would take\nher no more than six months to achieve stability. But Casey’s actual release date was\nunknown at the time of the trial because she was facing pending escape charges. And\nAntonich testified that it would take at least six to eight months of stability — including\n“clean UAs, working a case plan, steady employment, housing, safe housing, stable\nhousing” — before Cheyenne and Casey could be reunified. Notwithstanding the\nevidence of Casey’s bond with Cheyenne,42 it was appropriate for the superior court to\nemphasize Cheyenne’s need for permanency and stability in determining whether\n\n\n       42\n              Brenda also testified that she intended to encourage Cheyenne to maintain\nrelationships with her birth parents, indicating that the bond between Cheyenne and\nCasey will not necessarily be severed by the termination of Casey’s parental rights.\n\n                                           -20-                                      6837\n\ftermination was in her best interests.43 Casey’s incarceration, Casey’s past behavior, and\nAntonich’s time-frame estimation all supported the court’s conclusion that Casey would\nbe unable to meet Cheyenne’s needs.\n              Casey also argues there was “limited to no evidence presented concerning\nthe harm Cheyenne suffered,” and “little history to show any harm” committed by Casey.\nBut there was evidence in the record that Cheyenne was “way behind” in school and in\ndanger of being held back a grade “because she had missed so much [school]” while in\nCasey’s and Cash’s custody; that Cheyenne maintained a “getaway bag” because she was\naccustomed to hurriedly having to leave places where she would stay with her parents;\nthat Cheyenne exhibited “hoarding behavior”; and that Casey’s failure to adhere to the\nvisitation schedule upset Cheyenne. The record thus supported the superior court’s\nfinding that Casey had harmed Cheyenne in the past, and this past behavior supported\nthe court’s finding that termination of Casey’s parental rights would be in Cheyenne’s\nbest interests.\n              Finally, the presence of Brenda as a favorable placement supported the\nsuperior court’s conclusion that termination was in Cheyenne’s best interests.44 Antonich\n\n\n\n       43\n              See Barbara P. v.

INTRODUCTION\n               A mother appeals the termination of her parental rights to her child. She\nchallenges the superior court’s rulings that: (1) the child was a child in need of aid under\n\fAS 47.10.011; (2) she failed to remedy the conduct that placed the child in need of aid;\n(3) the Office of Children’s Services (OCS) made reasonable efforts to reunify the\nfamily; and (4) termination of her parental rights was in the child’s best interests.1\nBecause all of the superior court’s rulings are supported by the record, we affirm the\ncourt’s decision to terminate the mother’s parental rights.\nII.   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n             Cheyenne C.2 was born to Casey K. and Cash C. in May 2005. Cash was\nviolent toward Casey; at least once during their relationship he was convicted of\nviolating a domestic violence protective order. Casey and Cash initially tried to raise\nCheyenne together, but they split up in 2009 or 2010 and began sharing custody of\nCheyenne on an informal, unscheduled basis. Neither parent established a stable home,\nand Cheyenne moved frequently among temporary living situations.\n             On September 9, 2010, OCS received a report of concern involving\n“[a]llegations of parental substance abuse and neglect” of Cheyenne, but the report was\nscreened out because the family could not be located. Less than two weeks later, OCS\nreceived another report that was similar in nature. This time, OCS was able to locate the\nfamily and opened an investigation.\n             OCS social worker Cathy Gray conducted interviews with Cheyenne, Cash,\nand Casey as part of OCS’s investigation. Gray reported that Cheyenne “stated her\nmother smokes [marijuana] in front of her.” Casey admitted to occasionally smoking\nmarijuana but denied ever using in front of her daughter. Gray requested that Cash,\nCasey, and Casey’s boyfriend (with whom she was living at the time) complete\n\n      1\n              Although the superior court’s decision also terminated the father’s parental\nrights, he did not appeal; thus we address only the termination of the mother’s parental\nrights.\n      2\n             Pseudonyms are used for the family to protect their privacy.\n\n                                           -2-                                      6837\n\furinalysis (UA) tests, but none of them complied. OCS continued to receive reports that\nboth parents were using drugs and that Cheyenne lacked a stable living situation.\n             In November 2010 Cash was arrested while Cheyenne was with him. The\narresting officer contacted Casey’s mother, Brenda, and one of Cash’s friends dropped\nCheyenne off at Brenda’s house. Brenda tried to locate Casey but was unable to do so,\nand OCS was notified of Cash’s arrest. Rather than take immediate legal custody of\nCheyenne, OCS worked out a safety plan with Casey whereby Cheyenne would remain\nin Brenda’s care and Casey would submit UA test results to verify her sobriety. Casey\nunderwent four of the scheduled UAs: the first two did not produce a sample; the third\ntested positive for THC; and the fourth tested negative for all substances.\n             OCS took legal custody of Cheyenne on December 10, 2010, and Cheyenne\nremained in Brenda’s care. At a contested probable cause hearing OCS explained why\nit had concluded that Cheyenne was a child in need of aid. OCS stated it was concerned\nabout Casey’s and Cash’s drug use, their lack of stable housing, Casey’s ongoing\nrelationships with alleged drug dealers and perpetrators of domestic violence, and\nCheyenne’s possible exposure to domestic violence. OCS also asserted that Cheyenne\nhad missed eight days of school by the third week of September while in Cash’s and\nCasey’s care, though it was unclear whether the missed days occurred when Cheyenne\nwas with Cash or with Casey.\n             Brenda also testified that Cheyenne was exhibiting troubling behaviors. For\nexample, soon after Cheyenne moved in with her, Brenda discovered that Cheyenne kept\na bag under her bed with a change of clothes, stuffed animals, and food. Cheyenne\nreferred to this bag as her “getaway bag” and explained to Brenda that she kept it in case\nshe had to leave quickly, because when she was with Cash or Casey she sometimes had\nto leave places in the middle of the night and never knew whether she would return.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-                                      6837\n\n\fBrenda also noted that Cheyenne was hoarding items, such as half-eaten candies and\nscraps of paper.\n             The superior court found that probable cause existed to believe Cheyenne\nwas a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.011(8)(b)(ii) (domestic violence) and\nAS 47.10.011(9) (neglect) and granted OCS temporary custody.3 Cheyenne stayed in\nBrenda’s care, where she has remained ever since.\n             In January 2011 OCS established a case plan requiring Casey to complete\nrandom UAs twice a week, obtain a substance abuse assessment and follow treatment\nrecommendations, enroll in a domestic violence program and follow all\nrecommendations, visit Cheyenne regularly, and maintain safe and stable housing. OCS\nagreed to pay for UA testing, substance abuse assessments, all necessary referrals, and\ntransportation costs.\n             OCS case worker Brooke Antonich, who was assigned to the case in March\n2011, did not have contact information for Casey and “pretty much just didn’t know\nwhere she was or how to get a hold of her.” In May 2011 Casey visited the OCS office\nand left a note with a phone number, but Casey did not answer when Antonich tried to\ncall, and the voice mailbox was full. Casey visited the office again the following month\nand left another note with a different phone number, and Antonich was able to make\ncontact after leaving several messages.\n             Casey was incarcerated on criminal impersonation charges for just over a\nweek in June and July 2011. Soon after her release she met with Antonich to discuss her\ncase plan for the first time. After the meeting Casey set up an appointment for a\nsubstance abuse evaluation with a treatment program, but OCS failed to timely submit\n\n\n\n      3\n             The superior court also found probable cause under AS 47.10.011(10)\n(substance abuse), but this finding pertained only to Cash.\n\n                                          -4-                                     6837\n\frequired collateral information to the assessor. Lacking the collateral information, the\nassessor relied exclusively on Casey’s self-reporting during the evaluation and concluded\nthat Casey did not need any substance abuse treatment. OCS sent the required collateral\ninformation about three weeks after the July 21, 2011 evaluation, but an updated\nevaluation was not available until March 2012, due in part to OCS’s delay.\n               As part of Casey’s case plan OCS arranged for Casey to visit Cheyenne at\nBrenda’s house at least twice a week. Casey’s visits were sporadic: a visitation log\nrevealed that Casey was late or failed to show up for nearly two-thirds of the visits from\nSeptember to November 2011, and Brenda testified this was typical behavior for Casey.\nCasey also failed to show up to two meetings with Antonich in October and November,\nand Antonich rarely knew where Casey was living. Casey’s participation in the random\nUA testing program was equally minimal: Antonich testified that Casey only completed\ntwo or three UAs during OCS’s involvement in the case over the span of two years even\nthough random UA testing was always part of her case plan.\n               Casey was convicted of eluding a peace officer and incarcerated for over\na month during December 2011 and January 2012. Casey made efforts to adhere to her\ncase plan while incarcerated, completing a parenting class offered by the corrections\nsystem.    However, Brenda did not bring Cheyenne to see Casey while she was\nincarcerated because of a mental health provider’s recommendation and earlier\ndiscussions with Cash and Casey in which they all agreed that Cheyenne would never\nvisit either parent in jail.\n               After her release Casey started attending domestic violence education\nclasses, and Antonich noted “an improvement” in Casey’s progress as her visits with\nCheyenne became more consistent. Casey met with Antonich to discuss her case plan\nagain in March 2012, and Antonich updated the case plan. Casey informed Antonich\nthat she had yet to secure an apartment for herself, but she was staying with her father\n\n                                           -5-                                      6837\n\n\fand intended to move into her own apartment soon. Antonich never heard anything\nfurther about the apartment, however, and she was unable to locate Casey at her father’s\nhouse or elsewhere. Casey spoke with Antonich again in April, but she was unable to\nprovide Antonich with her contact information. Antonich also expressed concern that\nalthough Casey had nearly completed the domestic violence education classes, she\ncontinued to associate with past partners who had been accused of committing domestic\nviolence.\n             Casey was again arrested and incarcerated in April 2012, this time for\nattempting to falsify a UA by using a device containing another person’s urine. Casey\nwas convicted of tampering with physical evidence and sentenced to two years’\nimprisonment, with one year suspended. Casey was housed in segregation in the\ncorrectional facility because she allegedly attempted to escape from a pre-trial detention\nfacility. As a result, Casey was unable to take advantage of the substance abuse,\ndomestic violence, anger management, and parenting programs offered by the\ncorrections system. According to her probation officer, Casey was also “written up . . .\nfor various incidents” of misconduct while incarcerated. At the time of the termination\ntrial, Casey was still incarcerated and housed in segregation, and the escape allegations\nwere still under investigation.\n             Although Cheyenne did not visit Casey at the jail, Casey saw her daughter\nwhen she was released on a temporary furlough to attend a family funeral in July. That\nvisit went well, and Casey was very attentive to Cheyenne. Casey also wrote letters to\nCheyenne from prison and spoke to her by phone on one occasion. But phone\ncommunication had to be arranged by OCS because Casey was housed in segregation,\nand it is unclear whether Casey requested OCS to arrange for additional phone visitation.\n             The superior court held a termination trial in November 2012, nearly two\nyears after OCS took legal custody of Cheyenne. Antonich testified that it would be in\n\n                                           -6-                                      6837\n\n\fCheyenne’s best interests to be freed for adoption by her grandparents. Antonich\nexpressed concern that it would take at least six to eight months after Casey’s release\nfrom prison before Casey and Cheyenne could be reunified, and she did not think it was\nappropriate “to delay [Cheyenne’s] permanency any longer.”\n             Casey testified to why her parental rights should not be terminated. Casey\nstated that she expected to be released in December, at which time she intended to move\nin with her family, go back to work, obtain a college degree, and follow her case plan so\nshe could regain custody. When asked whether her parental rights should be terminated,\nCasey responded, “I know that I wasn’t as serious as I should have been before, and I —\nit’s my own fault for not doing all of it like I should have. But I believe I deserve\nanother chance, at least another six months to get everything done.” Casey also stated\nshe believed it would take her no more than six months to achieve stability.\n             Brenda testified that Cheyenne knew her and her husband as her primary\ncaregivers, and she agreed that it would not be in Cheyenne’s best interests to “stay in\nlimbo” by putting the termination decision off for another year or so while Casey and\nCash worked on their case plans. Brenda acknowledged that the termination decision\nwas “really, really hard” and stated that she fully intended to encourage Cheyenne to\nmaintain relationships with her birth parents.\n             At the conclusion of the termination trial Superior Court Judge Eric Smith\nissued oral findings, which were followed the next month by a written order terminating\nCasey’s parental rights. The superior court found by clear and convincing evidence that\nCheyenne was a child in need of aid pursuant to AS 47.10.011(1) (abandonment), (9)\n(neglect), and (10) (substance abuse).4 The court found that Casey had done “very little\n\n\n\n      4\n            The superior court also found Cheyenne to be a child in need of aid under\nAS 47.10.011(2) (incarceration), but this finding pertained only to Cash.\n\n                                           -7-                                     6837\n\fon her case plan”; that “there was ample and credible testimony of neglect of [Cheyenne]\nwhile she was living with her folks due to the drug use and the lifestyles that were\ninduced by the drug use, as well as the fact that both parents have been . . . unavailable\nto [Cheyenne] because they were incarcerated due to their drug use”; and that Casey had\nan “ongoing substance abuse addiction.”\n              The superior court also found by clear and convincing evidence that Casey\nhad not “remedied the conduct or conditions in the home that put the child at substantial\nrisk of harm,” and that OCS “made timely and reasonable efforts as required by\nAS 47.10.086 to effectuate reunification between the parents and the child . . . .” Finally,\nthe superior court found by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of Casey’s\nparental rights was in Cheyenne’s best interests.\n              Casey appeals from the termination order.\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              In a child in need of aid (CINA) termination proceeding we review a\nsuperior court’s factual findings for clear error.5 Factual findings “are clearly erroneous\nif review of the entire record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake\nhas been made.”6 “Conflicting evidence is generally insufficient to overturn the superior\ncourt, and we will not reweigh evidence when the record provides clear support for the\nsuperior court’s ruling.”7 “Whether a child is in need of aid and whether the parent failed\n\n\n       5\n             Christina J. v.

Casey does not appeal the superior court’s finding that\nCheyenne was a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.011(9) (neglect) or (10) (substance\nabuse); she appeals only the court’s finding that she abandoned Cheyenne under\nAS 47.10.011(1). But only one statutory basis is required for a CINA finding. See G.C.\nv. State, Dep’t of Health & Soc.

OCS contends that “[w]ere it not for\nCasey’s seven-month failure to engage, sporadic contacts with OCS, continued pattern\nof poor decision-making, and commission of criminal acts leading to incarceration and\nsegregation, she would have had ample time to complete substance abuse treatment and\ndemonstrate sobriety within the two years preceding the termination trial.”\n             Casey exaggerates the extent to which she complied with her case plan. As\ndescribed above, Casey made no efforts to participate in her case plan or remedy her\nconduct for the first seven months after OCS took custody of Cheyenne, and Antonich\ntestified that she was unable to get in contact with Casey for a four-month period when\nshe was first assigned to the case. Casey completed only two to four UAs during the\nentire period of OCS’s involvement even though random UA testing was always\nrequired by her case plan. All of her missed or incomplete UAs were properly\nconsidered failed UAs. And although Casey’s progress improved in early 2012, she was\nagain incarcerated in April 2012, this time for conduct directly related to her substance\naddictions: Casey attempted to falsify her UA test result by substituting another person’s\nurine for her own. At the time of the termination trial, Casey was still incarcerated,\nhoused in segregation, and had an unknown release date.\n             Casey properly notes that OCS’s failure to timely provide required\ncollateral information to the substance abuse treatment assessor prevented her from\nreceiving an accurate substance abuse evaluation for eight months. Although this failure\nmay have made it more difficult for Casey to receive immediate treatment for her\nsubstance abuse issues, it did not preclude her from remedying her substance abuse\nproblems within a reasonable time. Cheyenne had been in OCS’s custody for nearly two\nyears at the time of the parental rights termination trial, and yet Casey remained\n\n                                          -13-                                      6837\n\n\fincarcerated with an unknown release date. Moreover, Casey received the accurate\nsubstance abuse evaluation in March 2012, yet she was incarcerated for tampering with\na UA device a month later.21\n             The record suggests that although Casey made some progress toward\nremedying her conduct for a two-month period in the spring of 2012, her overall efforts\nover the nearly two-year period of OCS’s involvement were minimal and sporadic. The\nsuperior court did not clearly err in finding that Casey failed to remedy her conduct in\na reasonable time.\n      C.\t    The Superior Court Did Not Err In Finding That OCS Made\n             Reasonable Efforts To Reunify Casey With Cheyenne.\n             Casey challenges the superior court’s finding that OCS made reasonable\nefforts to reunify her with Cheyenne, arguing there is insufficient evidence in the record\nto support this finding. Before terminating parental rights, the court must find by clear\nand convincing evidence that OCS has made reasonable efforts to effectuate reunification\nbetween the parent and the child.22 Alaska Statute 47.10.086 requires OCS to “make\ntimely, reasonable efforts to provide family support services to the child and to the\nparents or guardian of the child that are designed to prevent out-of-home placement of\nthe child or to enable the safe return of the child to the family home, when appropriate,\nif the child is in an out-of-home placement.”23 As part of these “reasonable efforts,” OCS\nmust identify, “actively offer,” and refer the parent to family support services that will\n\n\n      21\n             We also note that the treatment assessor’s initial assessment of Casey was\nbased exclusively on information which Casey provided. Thus, to the extent the provider\nerroneously concluded that Casey did not need treatment, this error was presumably\ncaused by Casey’s own misstatements in her self-reporting.\n      22\n             AS 47.10.088(a)(3).\n      23\n             AS 47.10.086(a).\n\n                                          -14-\t                                     6837\n\n\fassist him or her in remedying the conduct or conditions in the home that made the child\na child in need of aid.24 OCS must also document its actions.25 When making\ndeterminations under AS 47.10.086, “the primary consideration is the child’s best\ninterests.”26\n                “The efforts that OCS makes must be reasonable but need not be perfect.”27\nWe have recognized that OCS maintains “some discretion in determining what efforts\nto pursue and whether the timing is reasonable.”28 Additionally, “[a] parent’s willingness\nto participate in services is relevant to the scope of the efforts OCS must provide.”29\n                The superior court found that OCS’s efforts included the development of\nan initial safety plan; the development of case plans; referrals for UAs and substance\nabuse assessments; provision of funds for UAs and assessments; the establishment of an\n“open and liberal” visitation schedule; and the provision of programs by the Department\nof Corrections (DOC) while Casey was incarcerated. The court further found that OCS\n“provided extensive services for the child and there was ongoing contact between [OCS]\nand the parents including phone calls, attempted phone calls to return the parents’ calls\n\n\n         24\n                Id.\n         25\n                Id.\n         26\n                AS 47.10.086(f).\n         27\n                Audrey H. v.

The court found that Cheyenne needed permanency, which\nCasey was unable to provide to her; that there was no evidence that Casey was going to\nchange her behavior, and “without change, the best predictor of future behavior is past\nbehavior”; that once released, it would take Casey up to two years to prove her sobriety\nand stability; and that it was not in Cheyenne’s best interests “to give [Casey] an\nunlimited amount of time to remedy the harm [she] pose[d]” to Cheyenne.\n             Casey argues that “[c]onsidering the bond between mother and child, the\n\n      38\n        (...continued)\nServs., Div. of Family & Youth Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2637527\"><a href=\"/opinion/2637527/erica-a-v-state-dept-of-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (Alaska 2003).\n      39\n             AS 47.10.088(c); CINA Rule 18(c)(3).\n      40\n             AS 47.10.088(b).\n      41\n            Sean B. v.

But Casey again\nmischaracterizes the extent to which she complied with her case plan and the extent to\nwhich OCS’s failure to provide the collateral information for her substance abuse\nevaluation impeded her progress. As described above, Casey failed to participate in or\neven discuss her case plan for the first seven months of OCS’s involvement, and her\nparticipation remained sporadic and minimal for the next six or seven months. Casey\ncomplied with some aspects of her case plan for two months in the spring of 2012, but\nshe was incarcerated soon after. Casey stated that she thought she would be released in\nDecember 2012, just a month after the termination trial, and once released it would take\nher no more than six months to achieve stability. But Casey’s actual release date was\nunknown at the time of the trial because she was facing pending escape charges. And\nAntonich testified that it would take at least six to eight months of stability — including\n“clean UAs, working a case plan, steady employment, housing, safe housing, stable\nhousing” — before Cheyenne and Casey could be reunified. Notwithstanding the\nevidence of Casey’s bond with Cheyenne,42 it was appropriate for the superior court to\nemphasize Cheyenne’s need for permanency and stability in determining whether\n\n\n       42\n              Brenda also testified that she intended to encourage Cheyenne to maintain\nrelationships with her birth parents, indicating that the bond between Cheyenne and\nCasey will not necessarily be severed by the termination of Casey’s parental rights.\n\n                                           -20-                                      6837\n\ftermination was in her best interests.43 Casey’s incarceration, Casey’s past behavior, and\nAntonich’s time-frame estimation all supported the court’s conclusion that Casey would\nbe unable to meet Cheyenne’s needs.\n              Casey also argues there was “limited to no evidence presented concerning\nthe harm Cheyenne suffered,” and “little history to show any harm” committed by Casey.\nBut there was evidence in the record that Cheyenne was “way behind” in school and in\ndanger of being held back a grade “because she had missed so much [school]” while in\nCasey’s and Cash’s custody; that Cheyenne maintained a “getaway bag” because she was\naccustomed to hurriedly having to leave places where she would stay with her parents;\nthat Cheyenne exhibited “hoarding behavior”; and that Casey’s failure to adhere to the\nvisitation schedule upset Cheyenne. The record thus supported the superior court’s\nfinding that Casey had harmed Cheyenne in the past, and this past behavior supported\nthe court’s finding that termination of Casey’s parental rights would be in Cheyenne’s\nbest interests.\n              Finally, the presence of Brenda as a favorable placement supported the\nsuperior court’s conclusion that termination was in Cheyenne’s best interests.44 Antonich\n\n\n\n       43\n              See Barbara P. v.
