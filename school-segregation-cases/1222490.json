On August 21, 2010, after\n\nmore than a month of planning, teams from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office\n\ndescended on multiple target locations. They blocked the entrances and exits to\n\nthe parking lots so no one could leave and no one could enter. With some team\n\nmembers dressed in ballistic vests and masks, and with guns drawn, the deputies\n\nrushed into their target destinations, handcuffed the stunned occupants—and\n\ndemanded to see their barbers’ licenses. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office was\n\nproviding muscle for the Florida Department of Business and Professional\n\nRegulation’s administrative inspection of barbershops to discover licensing\n\nviolations.\n\n      We first held nineteen years ago that conducting a run-of-the-mill\n\nadministrative inspection as though it is a criminal raid, when no indication exists\n\nthat safety will be threatened by the inspection, violates clearly established Fourth\n\nAmendment rights. See Swint v. City of Wadley, 51 F.3d 988 (11th Cir. 1995). We\n\nreaffirmed that principle in 2007 when we held that other deputies of the very same\n\nOrange County Sheriff’s Office who participated in a similar warrantless criminal\n\nraid under the guise of executing an administrative inspection were not entitled to\n\nqualified immunity. See Bruce v. Beary, 498 F.3d 1232 (11th Cir. 2007). Today,\n\n                                         2\n\f              Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 3 of 44\n\n\nwe repeat that same message once again. We hope that the third time will be the\n\ncharm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      The instant case arises from an unannounced, warrantless inspection of a\n\nbarbershop by officers of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office (“OCSO”) and\n\nrepresentatives from the Florida Department of Business and Professional\n\nRegulation (“DBPR”). On August 21, 2010, OCSO and the DBPR conducted\n\nplanned sweeps of several barbershops, located in predominantly Hispanic and\n\nAfrican-American neighborhoods, with the purported intent of discovering\n\nviolations of state licensing laws.\n\n      Plaintiff-Appellee Brian Berry is the sole owner of Strictly Skillz\n\nBarbershop, one of the targets of the operation. Berry is a licensed barber and has\n\nbeen operating Strictly Skillz since 2007. Plaintiffs-Appellees Edwyn Durant,\n\nReginald Trammon, and Jermario Anderson are licensed barbers who rent\n\nbarbering chairs at Strictly Skillz for a weekly rental fee. All four plaintiffs, who\n\nwere subject to OCSO and the DBPR’s “administrative inspection” of Strictly\n\nSkillz, sued several OCSO officers, including Appellants Corporal Keith Vidler\n\nand Deputy Travis Leslie, alleging that the officers violated their Fourth\n\nAmendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                 Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014       Page: 4 of 44\n\n\n                                                   II.\n\n      The DBPR is tasked with regulating and enforcing statutes and rules\n\nassociated with professional licenses. Barbershops are subject to this regulatory\n\nframework and are governed by § 476.184, Fla. Stat., and its implementing rules.\n\nUnder the rules, DBPR inspectors are authorized to conduct biennial inspections to\n\nensure that barbershops are in compliance with state licensing and sanitation laws.\n\nBut the DBPR is not empowered to take law-enforcement action and must rely on\n\nlocal law enforcement to address violations of state law.\n\n      The impetus for the sting operation stemmed from a chance encounter\n\nbetween DBPR inspector Amanda Fields and Corporal Vidler, during which Fields\n\ncomplained of some of the difficulties that she had encountered in conducting her\n\nbarbershop inspections. Upon discovering that barbering without a license is a\n\nsecond-degree misdemeanor under Florida law, see Fla. Stat. § 476.194,1 Vidler\n\n\n      1\n          Section 476.194, Fla. Stat., provides,\n\n                (1) It is unlawful for any person to:\n\n                       (a) Engage in the practice of barbering without an active\n                       license as a barber issued pursuant to the provisions of this\n                       act by the department.\n\n                       (b) Hire or employ any person to engage in the practice of\n                       barbering unless such person holds a valid license as a\n                       barber.\n\n                       (c) Obtain or attempt to obtain a license for money other\n                       than the required fee or any other thing of value or by\n                       fraudulent misrepresentations.\n                                                   4\n\f                Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014       Page: 5 of 44\n\n\nbecame intrigued by the possibility of a collaboration between the DBPR and\n\nOCSO and spent over a month, together with other OCSO officers and DBPR\n\nrepresentatives, developing a plan for a joint sweep operation of various\n\nbarbershops and salons. The barbershops chosen for the operation were apparently\n\nselected because they or barbers within them had on previous occasions failed to\n\ncooperate with DBPR inspectors.2                  All of the targeted barbershops were\n\nbusinesses that serviced primarily African-American and Hispanic clientele.\n\n       Vidler prepared the OCSO Operations Plan, which provided that the sweeps\n\nwould be executed by two teams, each consisting of a supervisor, a narcotics agent,\n\na plain-clothes deputy, three uniformed deputies, and two DBPR agents. Although\n\nthe stated goal of the operation was “to assist the DBPR in the detention and\n\n\n\n                       (d) Own, operate, maintain, open, establish, conduct, or\n                       have charge of, either alone or with another person or\n                       persons, a barbershop:\n\n                              1. Which is not licensed under the provisions of this\n                              chapter; or\n\n                              2. In which a person not licensed as a barber is\n                              permitted to perform services.\n\n                       (e) Use or attempt to use a license to practice barbering\n                       when said license is suspended or revoked.\n       (2) Any person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of\n       the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.\n       2\n          Strictly Skillz was included on this list because during two routine inspections in 2007,\na DBPR inspector reported that barbers had refused to produce their licenses when asked to do\nso. It is not clear from the record whether these incidents occurred before or after Berry\npurchased the business.\n                                                 5\n\f               Case: 13-14092   Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 6 of 44\n\n\nidentification of unlicensed barbers and hair stylist[s],” the plan also contemplated\n\nother law-enforcement objectives.      For example, the plan provided that any\n\ncontraband discovered during the inspection had to be turned over to OCSO for\n\nprosecution and that the officers, with the assistance of narcotics agents, would\n\nidentify and handle any narcotics, gather intelligence, and interview potential\n\nconfidential informants.\n\n      On August 19, 2010, two days before the sweep, Inspector Fields and\n\nanother DBPR inspector conducted walkthroughs of six of the target locations,\n\nincluding Strictly Skillz. Though the purpose of the walkthrough was to gather\n\ninformation for the operation, the inspectors did so under the guise of performing a\n\nroutine inspection, verifying that the barbers’ licenses were current and valid and\n\ninspecting the barbers’ workstations. During the inspection of Strictly Skillz, the\n\nbarbers were cooperative, no violations were found, and no citations were issued.\n\nInspector Fields even commended Berry on the tremendous progress he had made\n\nin the shop.\n\n      Despite the fact that just two days earlier Strictly Skillz had passed\n\ninspection without any problems whatsoever and that the DBPR is permitted to\n\nconduct inspections only once every two years, on August 21, 2010, OCSO and the\n\nDBPR conducted a second inspection as part of the sting operation. The record,\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, reveals that the sweep of\n\n                                         6\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 7 of 44\n\n\nStrictly Skillz occurred as follows: Two plain clothes officers initially entered the\n\nbarbershop to observe any potential violations. Five or six barbers were on duty at\n\nthe time, and the shop was filled with anywhere from ten to twenty-five waiting\n\ncustomers. As the first day of the school year was approaching, several of the\n\ncustomers in the shop were children.\n\n      Shortly after the arrival of the plain-clothes officers, a “whole bunch” of\n\npolice cars pulled into the shopping plaza and completely blocked off the parking\n\nlot, preventing all ingress and egress. Officers then “rushed into” Strictly Skillz\n\n“like [a] SWAT team.” Based on the plaintiffs’ collective recollection, it appears\n\nthat somewhere between eight and ten officers, including narcotics agents,\n\ndescended upon the barbershop, along with a DBPR inspector.              Some of the\n\nofficers donned masks and bulletproof vests and had their guns drawn.            The\n\nofficers immediately ordered all of the customers to exit the shop and announced\n\nthat the shop was “closed down indefinitely.”\n\n      Plaintiffs Trammon, Anderson, and Durant were in the barbershop when the\n\nofficers stormed in. The officers directed Anderson and Durant to present their\n\ndriver’s licenses for identification, and Inspector Fields instructed Anderson to\n\nretrieve his barbering license from his work station. Trammon and Anderson, who\n\nwere in the process of cutting customers’ hair, were then immediately patted down\n\nand handcuffed with plastic zip ties. Anderson was handcuffed by a masked\n\n                                         7\n\f              Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 8 of 44\n\n\nofficer, and Trammon was restrained by two deputies who were not wearing\n\nmasks. Sometime after Trammon was handcuffed, he informed the officers that he\n\nwas in possession of a concealed firearm for which he had a valid concealed-\n\nweapons permit. The officers patted him down to retrieve the weapon and located\n\nthe permit without incident.\n\n      Vidler, who was the supervisor on the scene, admits that he ordered deputies\n\nto detain Trammon. When Trammon argued to one of the officers that he had done\n\nnothing wrong, the officer responded, “It’s a pretty big book, I’m pretty sure I can\n\nfind something in here to take you to jail for.” Durant, though told to “sit down\n\nand shut up,” was not handcuffed and was eventually permitted to leave the shop.\n\n      Shortly thereafter, Berry, who had been behind the shop in the parking lot\n\nwhen the officers initially entered, walked into Strictly Skillz through the back\n\nentrance. Upon seeing that Trammon and Anderson were in handcuffs and being\n\npatted down by officers, Berry made his way to the front of the shop, identified\n\nhimself as the owner, and demanded to know what was going on and why\n\nTrammon and Anderson were in handcuffs.            Deputy Leslie then immediately\n\nplaced Berry into metal handcuffs and patted him down. Though angry, Berry did\n\nnot physically resist and complied with the officers’ instructions.\n\n      While Trammon, Anderson, and Berry were restrained, Inspector Fields and\n\nthe OCSO officers conducted their “inspection” of the barbershop. OCSO officers\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 9 of 44\n\n\ncalled in the barbers’ driver’s license information to ascertain whether any of them\n\nhad outstanding warrants, and Inspector Fields, for the second time in two days,\n\nchecked the barbering licenses to ensure that they were still valid and current. The\n\nofficers, along with Inspector Fields, then searched the premises by inspecting each\n\nof the barbers’ workstations and looking through their drawers. OCSO officers\n\nalso went to the back of the shop without Inspector Fields and searched through an\n\nunlocked storage room where no barbering services were rendered.\n\n      At the conclusion of the inspection, it was determined that all of the barbers\n\nhad valid licenses and that the barbershop was in compliance with all safety and\n\nsanitation rules. No criminal violations were discovered, and Berry, Anderson, and\n\nTrammon were released from their handcuffs.             The entire inspection lasted\n\napproximately one hour.        After the officers and Inspector Fields left, the\n\nbarbershop resumed operations.3\n\n                                          III.\n\n      Following the search of Strictly Skillz, the plaintiffs filed the present suit\n\nagainst a number of the officers involved, including Vidler and Leslie, alleging,\n\namong other things, that the barbershop inspection constituted an unlawful search\n\nin violation of the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights. Vidler and Leslie each\n\nmoved for summary judgment on qualified-immunity grounds. The district court\n\n      3\n        After the August 21 sweep, OCSO and the DBPR conducted a second barbershop sting\non September 17, 2010, targeting two barbershops and a hair and nail salon.\n                                            9\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 10 of 44\n\n\ndenied summary judgment as to the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims, finding\n\nthat although OCSO and the DBPR validly invoked their statutory authority to\n\ninspect Strictly Skillz to determine whether barbers were operating without a\n\nlicense, the law regarding administrative searches was clearly established, and a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the administrative search was\n\nappropriately limited in scope. The district court also found that the plaintiffs had\n\nsufficiently established a causal link between the officers’ involvement and the\n\nalleged constitutional violations.   Vidler and Leslie now appeal the denial of\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                        IV.\n\n      We review de novo a district court’s denial of summary judgment based on\n\nqualified immunity, applying the same legal standards that governed the district\n\ncourt. Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, 707 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2013)\n\n(citing Edwards v. Shanley, 666 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir. 2012)).         Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\n\nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\nIn making this determination, the Court must view the facts and make all\n\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n\nKesinger ex rel. Estate of Kesinger v. Herrington, 381 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 11 of 44\n\n\n2004) (citing Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1486 (11th Cir. 1996)). Thus, we\n\naccept the plaintiffs’ version of the facts, as supported by evidence in the record.\n\n                                          V.\n\n      The sole question that we address on this appeal is whether the district court\n\ncorrectly concluded that Vidler and Leslie are not entitled to qualified immunity on\n\nsummary judgment. Qualified immunity protects government officials performing\n\ndiscretionary functions from liability “unless their conduct violates clearly\n\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\n\nhave known.” Cottone v. Jenne, 326 F.3d 1352, 1357 (11th Cir. 2003) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). This doctrine protects “all but the plainly incompetent\n\nor one who is knowingly violating the federal law.” Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d\n\n1188, 1194 (11th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      To obtain qualified immunity, a defendant must first demonstrate that he\n\nwas acting within his discretionary authority when the alleged violation occurred.\n\nOliver v. Fiorino, 586 F.3d 898, 905 (11th Cir. 2009). Here, the parties do not\n\ndispute that Vidler and Leslie were acting within the scope of their discretionary\n\nduties.\n\n      Therefore, the burden shifts to the plaintiffs “‘to show that the grant of\n\nqualified immunity is inappropriate.’” Id. (quoting McCullough v. Antolini, 559\n\nF.3d 1201, 1205 (11th Cir. 2009)). To do this, the plaintiffs must establish both\n\n                                          11\n\f             Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 12 of 44\n\n\nthat a violation of their constitutional rights occurred and that the violated rights\n\nwere “clearly established” at the time of the incident in question. Franklin v.\n\nCurry, 738 F.3d 1246, 1249 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (citing Keating v. City of\n\nMiami, 598 F.3d 753, 762 (11th Cir. 2010). The plaintiffs must also show a causal\n\nnexus between the defendants’ acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional\n\nviolations. Zatler v. Wainwright, 802 F.2d 397, 401 (11th Cir. 1986) (per curiam)\n\n(citing Williams v. Bennett, 689 F.2d 1370, 1380 (11th Cir. 1982)). As explained\n\nbelow, we find that the district court did not err in concluding that the plaintiffs\n\nsatisfied all of these showings.\n\n                                            A.\n\n      Berry, Anderson, Trammon, and Durant assert that Vidler and Leslie\n\nviolated their Fourth Amendment rights by subjecting them to an unreasonable\n\nsearch and seizure. The Fourth Amendment guarantees “[t]he right of the people\n\nto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\n\nsearches and seizures.”       U.S. Const. amend. IV. Its protections apply to\n\n“commercial premises, as well as to private homes.” New York v. Burger, 482\n\nU.S. 691, 699, 107 S. Ct. 2636, 2642 (1987). In general, the Fourth Amendment\n\nrequires a warrant supported by probable cause to effectuate a constitutional\n\nsearch. See id. at 702, 107 S. Ct. at 2643.      Indeed, this Court has explained, “The\n\nbasic premise of search and seizure doctrine is that searches undertaken without a\n\n                                            12\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 13 of 44\n\n\nwarrant issued upon probable cause are ‘per se unreasonable under the Fourth\n\nAmendment—subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated\n\nexceptions.’” Swint v. City of Wadley, 51 F.3d 988, 995 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Alexander, 835 F.2d 1406, 1408 (11th Cir. 1988)).\n\n      One of those limited exceptions involves administrative inspections of\n\n“closely regulated” industries. See Burger, 482 U.S. at 702, 107 S. Ct. at 2643.\n\nBecause an owner or operator of commercial property “has a reduced expectation\n\nof privacy” in this context, the standard for what may be reasonable under the\n\nFourth Amendment is correspondingly broader. See id. at 702−03, 107 S. Ct. at\n\n2643–44.\n\n      To fall within this exception, a warrantless inspection must satisfy three\n\ncriteria: (1) “a ‘substantial’ government interest [must] inform[] the regulatory\n\nscheme pursuant to which the inspection is made,” id. at 702, 107 S. Ct. at 2644;\n\n(2) the inspection “must be necessary to further [the] regulatory scheme,” id.\n\n(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); and (3) “the statute’s\n\ninspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application,\n\n[must] provid[e] a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant[,]” id. at 703,\n\n107 S. Ct. at 2644 (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\nregulatory “statute must [also] be sufficiently comprehensive and defined” such\n\nthat it “limits the discretion of inspecting officers.” United States v. Steed, 548\n\n                                         13\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 14 of 44\n\n\nF.3d 961, 968, 973 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). “‘Where a statute authorizes the\n\ninspection but makes no rules governing the procedures that inspectors must\n\nfollow, the Fourth Amendment and its various restrictive rules apply.’” Bruce v.\n\nBeary, 498 F.3d 1232, 1240 (quoting Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States,\n\n397 U.S. 72, 77, 90 S. Ct. 774 (1970)).\n\n      But even when the criteria set forth above are met, to satisfy the Fourth\n\nAmendment, an administrative inspection must be “appropriately limited” in both\n\nscope and execution and may not serve as a backdoor for undertaking a warrantless\n\nsearch unsupported by probable cause. Bruce, 498 F.3d at 1239−40 (citations\n\nomitted).   Above all, such inspections may never circumvent the Fourth\n\nAmendment’s requirement for reasonableness. See id. at 1244 (“As with any\n\nsearch, then, the scope and execution of an administrative inspection must be\n\nreasonable in order to be constitutional.”).    In this regard, “an administrative\n\nscreening search must be as limited in its intrusiveness as is consistent with\n\nsatisfaction of the administrative need that justifies it.” Id. at 1248 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      As detailed earlier, the regulatory framework for barbershop inspections in\n\nFlorida is embodied in Fla. Stat. § 476.184 and its implementing rules.           In\n\nparticular, § 476.184 requires all barbershops to have a license issued by the DBPR\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                 Case: 13-14092       Date Filed: 09/16/2014       Page: 15 of 44\n\n\nand directs the Florida Barbers’ Board 4 to “adopt rules governing the operation and\n\nperiodic inspection of barbershops licensed” in Florida. Rule 61G3-19.015(1), Fla.\n\nAdmin. Code, in turn, provides that the DBPR may conduct inspections biennially\n\non a “random, unannounced basis.” 5 The regulatory framework, which sets forth\n\nwho may conduct such inspections, notifies barbers that only the DBPR is so\n\nauthorized. See Burger, 482 U.S. at 711, 107 S. Ct. at 2648 (finding that the\n\nstatute at issue in that case provided a “constitutionally adequate substitute for a\n\nwarrant,” in part because “it notifie[d] the operator as to who [was] authorized to\n\nconduct an inspection”). In this case, no one disputes that the DBPR possesses\n\nstatutory authority to conduct warrantless inspections of barbershops, nor do the\n\nparties assert that the statute authorizing such inspections is constitutionally\n\nimpermissible.\n\n       Instead, the plaintiffs contend that the search of Strictly Skillz, which they\n\nallege was undertaken with an inordinate display of force, failed to conform to the\n\nFourth Amendment’s requirement for reasonableness. Because we have twice\n\n\n       4\n       Section 476.184, Fla. Stat., authorizes the creation of the Barbers’ Board within the\nDepartment of Business and Professional Regulation.\n       5\n           Rule 61G3-19.015(1), Fla. Admin. Code, reads, in its entirety,\n                 Inspections conducted by the Department of Business and\n                 Professional Regulation of barbershops to determine whether such\n                 barbershops are in compliance with the applicable provisions of\n                 Chapter 476, [Fla. Stat.], and the rules promulgated thereunder\n                 shall be conducted biennially, effective July 1, 2010, on a random\n                 unannounced basis, unless otherwise practicable.\n                                                 15\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 16 of 44\n\n\nheld, on facts disturbingly similar to those presented here, that a criminal raid\n\nexecuted under the guise of an administrative inspection is constitutionally\n\nunreasonable, we agree.\n\n      We first undertook this analysis in Swint v. City of Wadley, where we\n\nreviewed the constitutionality of two law-enforcement raids on a nightclub. The\n\nraids were executed with the aid of SWAT team members, several of the officers\n\npointed their weapons at patrons, and the club patrons and employees were\n\nsearched and detained for over an hour and a half. Swint, 51 F.3d at 993. Based\n\non these facts, we rejected the officers’ contention that the searches were valid\n\nadministrative inspections, specifically noting that the “massive show of force and\n\nexcessive intrusion” displayed during the raids far exceeded that of previous\n\nadministrative inspections of the club. Id. at 999. We also emphasized that no\n\nreasonable officer in the defendants’ position could have believed that the raids\n\nwere lawful, administrative searches. Id.\n\n      More recently, in Bruce v. Beary, this Court again detailed the\n\nconstitutionally permissible scope of administration inspections. Bruce, 498 F.3d\n\nat 1232.   There, officers of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office—the same\n\norganization involved in the barbershop sweeps—conducted a raid on an auto-\n\nbody repair shop. See id. at 1236. The search involved a group of twenty officers\n\nwho surrounded the premises and blocked all of the exits. Id. Some of the officers\n\n                                        16\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 17 of 44\n\n\nwere dressed in SWAT uniforms with ballistic vests. Id. The officers entered the\n\nshop with guns drawn, ordering all of the employees to line up along a fence. Id.\n\nThen the officers patted down and searched the employees. Id. Under these\n\ncircumstances, we held that the search, which was more akin to a criminal raid\n\nthan a routine inspection, exceeded the bounds of the Fourth Amendment. See id.\n\nat 1245. As the inspection of books and records “does not require exits to be\n\nblocked, an automatic shotgun to be stuck into an employee’s back, employees to\n\nbe lined up along a fence and patted down and deprived of their identification,” we\n\nconcluded that the search far surpassed its statutory authorization and was\n\nconstitutionally unreasonable. Id.\n\n       The facts of this case, which bear striking similarities to those described\n\nabove, cannot escape the tight grasp of Swint and Bruce.            Unlike previous\n\ninspections of Strictly Skillz, which were all conducted by a single DBPR\n\ninspector without the aid of law enforcement, the August 21 search was executed\n\nwith a tremendous and disproportionate show of force, and no evidence exists that\n\nsuch force was justified. Despite the fact that neither OCSO nor the DBPR had\n\nany reason to believe that the inspection of Strictly Skillz posed a threat to officer\n\nsafety, the record indicates that several OCSO officers entered the barbershop\n\nwearing masks and bulletproof vests, and with guns drawn; surrounded the\n\nbuilding and blocked all of the exits; forced all of the children and other customers\n\n                                         17\n\f               Case: 13-14092       Date Filed: 09/16/2014       Page: 18 of 44\n\n\nto leave; announced that the business was “closed down indefinitely”; and\n\nhandcuffed and conducted pat-down searches of the employees while the officers\n\nsearched the premises. Such a search, which bears no resemblance to a routine\n\ninspection for barbering licenses, is certainly not reasonable in scope and\n\nexecution. Rather, “[i]t is the conduct of officers conducting a raid.” Bruce, 498\n\nF.3d at 1245.6\n\n       The show of force and search were all the more unreasonable in view of the\n\nfact that DBPR inspectors visited Strictly Skillz a mere two days before the search\n\nand had already determined that the barbershop and its employees were in\n\ncompliance with state regulations. Thus, the subsequent sting operation at Strictly\n\nSkillz, the very purpose of which was to check for licensing violations, was\n\ngratuitous at best. Moreover, as the DBPR’s implementing rules contemplate only\n\nbiennial inspections, see Fla. Admin. Code 61G3-19.015, and no violation\n\n\n       6\n          To be clear, our basis for concluding that the search of Strictly Skillz was\nunconstitutional does not rest on the existence of any pretext on the part of OCSO and the\nDBPR. Indeed, we have previously recognized that administrative searches are not rendered\ninvalid because they are accompanied by some degree of suspicion, see Bruce, 498 F.3d at 1242,\nand the Supreme Court has similarly noted that suspicion of criminal activity will not defeat an\notherwise permissible administrative search, see United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U.S.\n579, 584 n.3, 103 S. Ct. 2573, 2577 n.3 (1983)). Accordingly, we do not consider whether the\nsting operation was pretextual; rather, our decision is based solely on our determination that the\nmanner in which the so-called inspection was executed far exceeded the bounds of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment. See Bruce, 498 F.3d at 1250 (Carnes, J.,\nconcurring) (“There was a Fourth Amendment violation in this case because the scope of the law\nenforcement intrusion exceeded that which is permissible during an administrative search alone.\nWhat happened in this case was more of a full scale raid and the kind of prolonged, top to bottom\nsearch that requires a warrant than it was an administrative search to determine compliance with\nlaws applicable to a closely regulated business.”).\n                                               18\n\f              Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 19 of 44\n\n\nwarranting a follow-up inspection had occurred, the second inspection also\n\nexceeded the scope of the DBPR’s statutory authority.\n\n      Not only that, but the statute authorizing administrative inspections of\n\nbarbershops vests authority to conduct the inspections in the DBPR alone. See Fla.\n\nStat. § 476.184; Fla. Admin. Code 61G3-19.015.            While law enforcement is\n\ncertainly permitted to accompany DBPR inspectors during their inspections to\n\nprovide any needed assistance and to arrest individuals whom the DBPR’s\n\ninspections determine to be in violation of the law, the administrative framework\n\ndoes not bestow upon police officers the authority to themselves conduct the\n\nbarbershop inspections. Despite this fact, OCSO officers did exactly that and\n\nmore; they themselves opened drawers in barbers’ workstations and searched a\n\nstorage closet in the back of Strictly Skillz.\n\n      Because the facts of this case—when viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nthe plaintiffs—adequately establish that the “inspection” of Strictly Skillz\n\namounted to an unconstitutional search and that the unconstitutionality of such a\n\nsearch was clearly established at the time that the search was executed, the\n\nplaintiffs have met their burden, and the district court properly determined that\n\nqualified immunity is inappropriate at this juncture.\n\n                                           B.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 20 of 44\n\n\n       In affirming the denial of Vidler and Leslie’s qualified-immunity defense,\n\nwe do not depart from the long-standing principle that individual liability under §\n\n1983 must be premised on each defendant’s participation in the plaintiff’s\n\nconstitutional injury. Indeed, it is well established that in order to prevail on a §\n\n1983 claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate an “affirmative causal connection”\n\nbetween the official and the alleged deprivation. See Zatler, 802 F.2d at 401.\n\nMoreover, we recognize that each defendant is entitled to an independent analysis\n\nof the applicability of the qualified-immunity doctrine to his actions.\n\n      To establish the requisite causal link, a plaintiff must show that the official\n\nwas personally involved in the acts that resulted in the constitutional deprivation.\n\nZatler, 802 F.2d at 401 (citing Ancata v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 769 F.2d 700,\n\n706 (11th Cir. 1985)). “[T]he inquiry into causation must be a directed one,\n\nfocusing on the duties and responsibilities of each of the individual defendants\n\nwhose acts or omissions are alleged to have resulted in a constitutional\n\ndeprivation.” Williams, 689 F.2d at 1381. But this does not mean that a plaintiff\n\nmust catalog each and every specific action in which a defendant engaged if that\n\ndefendant was integrally involved in what was, from the outset, clearly an\n\nunreasonable search in violation of the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights. See\n\nSwint, 51 F.3d at 994 (where the defendants “personally participated” in an\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 21 of 44\n\n\n“inspection” conducted like a criminal raid, they were not entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity).\n\n      Vidler and Leslie argue that the district court did not adequately identify\n\ntheir personal involvement in the plaintiffs’ constitutional injuries for purposes of\n\nqualified immunity. We disagree.\n\n      The record clearly supports a finding that Vidler and Leslie were both active\n\nand full participants in the unconstitutional intrusion, which was unconstitutional\n\nfrom the moment that OCSO burst into Strictly Skillz in raid mode for the\n\nostensible purpose of helping DBPR review Strictly Skillz’s barbers’ licenses that\n\nit had just inspected two days earlier. Vidler was the catalyst for the entire\n\noperation and was primarily responsible for its planning and organization. He was\n\nalso present during the “inspection” and was the supervising officer on the scene.\n\nAs for Leslie, it is undisputed that he placed one of the plaintiffs in handcuffs and\n\nhelped to execute the unconstitutional search of the shop and barbering stations.\n\nThese alleged acts sufficiently demonstrate both Vidler and Leslie’s core\n\nparticipation in the warrantless search of Strictly Skillz and, if proven, violated the\n\nplaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.\n\n      Nor, as the dissent suggests, does declining to reverse the district court’s\n\ndenial of qualified immunity with respect to Trammon, Durant, and Anderson’s\n\nclaims against Leslie somehow “bend the law to resolve this appeal with a feel-\n\n                                          21\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 22 of 44\n\n\ngood ending from a box-office hit.” First, under the facts viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiffs, the only “hit” that happened in this case was on Strictly\n\nSkillz. Second, we highly doubt that the plaintiffs felt “good” when Vidler, Leslie,\n\nand the rest of the OCSO officers invaded their place of business with mask-and-\n\nbullet-proof-vest-donning officers with guns drawn, kicked their customers out on\n\none of the busiest days of the year and advised customers that Strictly Skillz was\n\n“closed down indefinitely,” and handcuffed the plaintiffs in the very spaces they\n\nrented.\n\n      And third, as for the law, we agree with our dissenting brother that judges\n\nshould not “bend the law” to make it fit their personal views. That is why we must\n\naffirm the district court’s denial of qualified immunity to Officer Leslie with\n\nregard to the claims of Trammon, Durant, and Anderson. Quite simply, binding\n\nprecedent requires it. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a straighter application of\n\nbinding precedent than Swint to the facts of this case. In Swint, 30 to 40 officers\n\nconducted “raids” of a nightclub under the guise of performing “administrative\n\nsearches.” 51 F.3d at 993. The plaintiffs in that case included Swint and Spradley,\n\nwho owned the club; James, who was a club employee who was present during\n\nboth raids; and Lewis, who was a club patron present only for the second raid.\n\nThey sued three individual defendants:         Freddie Morgan, the police chief;\n\nDendinger, a police officer; and James C. Morgan, the sheriff.\n\n                                         22\n\f            Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 23 of 44\n\n\n      This Court described the raids at issue in that case as follows:\n\n            [In the first raid,] [t]he Task Force officers pointed their\n            weapons at plaintiffs Spradley and James and others who\n            were present. Participants in the raid searched the\n            Club’s cash register and door receipts, and some currency\n            was confiscated from the door receipts. Persons inside\n            the Club were prohibited from moving or leaving until\n            the raid, which lasted one to one and one-half hours, was\n            over. Those present were not allowed to go to the\n            restroom.      When one man asked for permission,\n            [defendant] Officer Dendinger replied, “Shut up, or I’ll\n            shut you up myself.” When plaintiff James told\n            [defendant] Chief Morgan that she was so scared that she\n            had to go to the restroom, he said no. . . .\n\n            ...\n\n            During this second raid, law enforcement officials\n            chambered rounds of ammunition into their weapons,\n            pointed them, and ordered persons in the Club to get\n            down on the floor. Some of those present in the Club\n            during this raid were searched, including plaintiff Lewis.\n            During the process of being searched, Lewis was pushed\n            outside the Club, grabbed and shoved against a wall.\n            After being searched, Lewis was forced to go back inside\n            the Club until the raid was concluded. Another patron\n            was pushed off a bar stool. Some of the employees,\n            including plaintiff James, had guns held on them during\n            the raid, which lasted from one to one and one-half\n            hours. At one point, an officer, with his finger on the\n            trigger, pointed a shotgun at Lewis’ face. . . .\n\nId. (emphasis added). Other than these facts, Swint states no specific facts about\n\nthe roles of Officer Dendinger and Chief Morgan in the searches, except to note,\n\n“Chief Morgan and Officer Dendinger personally participated in both raids.” Id.\n\nat 994 (emphasis added). Thus, nothing in the facts set forth in Swint identifies\n                                         23\n\f              Case: 13-14092   Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 24 of 44\n\n\nwhat Dendinger did directly or particularly to any of the plaintiffs, other than that\n\nhe told someone who was not a plaintiff to “shut up,” thus showing only that\n\nDendinger personally participated in the raids. And, other than Chief Morgan’s\n\nrefusal to allow James to use the restroom, which also necessarily demonstrates\n\nChief Morgan’s personal participation in the raids, the opinion contains no\n\nindication that the plaintiffs identified anything specific that Chief Morgan did to\n\nthem.\n\n        As for the opinion’s description of the second raid—the only one for which\n\nplaintiff Lewis was even present—it does not even identify a particular action in\n\nwhich either Chief Morgan or Dendinger engaged at all. Moreover, because the\n\nopinion describes the raids as occurring with 30 to 40 officers, we cannot infer\n\nfrom the facts set forth that Dendinger or Chief Morgan personally conducted the\n\nactual search or pushing of Lewis about which Lewis complained.\n\n        Nonetheless, and despite specifically acknowledging Zatler’s rule that §\n\n1983 requires proof of an affirmative causal connection between the official’s acts\n\nor omissions and the alleged constitutional deprivation, this Court concluded in\n\nSwint that qualified immunity had to be denied to all three officers with respect to\n\nall four plaintiffs because, among other reasons, “[n]o reasonable officer in the\n\ndefendants’ position could have believed that these were lawful, warrantless\n\nadministrative searches.” Id. at 999.\n\n                                         24\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 25 of 44\n\n\n      Our dissenting colleague suggests that we are not bound by what Swint held\n\nwhen, because of the individual defendants’ core personal participation in a\n\nwarrantless search that was illegal from the outset, this Court denied qualified\n\nimmunity to each of the individual defendants against each of the individual\n\nplaintiffs. By making this argument, the dissent effectively concedes that Swint\n\ndid exactly what we are doing in this case. Only the dissent reasons that we are\n\nfree to ignore what Swint did for three reasons.\n\n      First, the dissent asserts that “Swint did not consider at all the argument\n\nraised by Deputy Leslie in this appeal—whether an officer can be liable for\n\nviolations of clearly established constitutional rights that he did not commit or that\n\nwere not pursuant to a policy that he approved.” Dissent at 5. But there is nothing\n\nnew in this case that the Court in Swint did not consider.\n\n      The dissent’s contention assumes that Deputy Leslie did not engage in\n\nviolations of clearly established constitutional rights. But Leslie is not being\n\ndenied qualified immunity for violations of clearly established constitutional rights\n\nthat he did not commit or that were not pursuant to a policy that he approved. On\n\nthe contrary, just like the defendant officers in Swint, Leslie is being held\n\nresponsible for his core personal participation in what was, according to our\n\nbinding precedent, clearly from the start, an unlawful, warrantless search that\n\naffected each and every one of the plaintiffs. Each of the plaintiff barbers had a\n\n                                         25\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 26 of 44\n\n\ncognizable Fourth Amendment interest in the property that was illegally searched\n\nand a cognizable Fourth Amendment right not to have been seized by the raiding\n\nunit, under the circumstances. Just as Dendinger and Chief Morgan’s “personal[]\n\nparticipat[ion]” in the illegal raids in Swint required the denial of qualified\n\nimmunity for each of the defendants with regard to each of the plaintiffs, despite\n\nthe absence of facts showing exactly what each officer did to each plaintiff whose\n\nrights were violated by the raids, Leslie’s core participation in the illegal search of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ property and the unlawful detention of the plaintiffs violated each of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ clearly established rights and requires the denial of qualified\n\nimmunity.\n\n      This reading of Swint’s requirements—that an officer’s core “personal[]\n\nparticipation” in a warrantless search that is unlawful from its inception violates\n\nthe clearly established rights of the people whose property was searched and who\n\nwere seized, where the participating officers had clear notice from our prior case\n\nlaw that participation in a search of that particular type violates the Fourth\n\nAmendment—is the only reading of Swint that does not require us to ignore\n\nsignificant portions of the opinion. It also describes precisely the fact pattern that\n\noccurred in this case.\n\n      Second, the dissent attempts to distance itself from Swint and suggests that\n\nSwint does not compel the conclusion that qualified immunity must be denied to\n\n                                          26\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 27 of 44\n\n\nLeslie with respect to the claims of Trammon, Durant, and Anderson because in\n\nSwint, this Court did not consider whether the Swint plaintiffs had established that\n\neach of the defendant officers had engaged in specific, identified actions with\n\nregard to each of the particular plaintiffs. See Dissent at 7-8. We respectfully\n\ndisagree with the dissent.\n\n      In Swint, we expressly identified the requirement that a specific inquiry be\n\nmade into the relationship between each defendant’s actions and each plaintiff’s\n\nalleged injuries. In this regard, we quoted Zatler’s requirement of “proof of an\n\naffirmative causal connection between the official’s acts or omissions and the\n\nalleged constitutional deprivation . . . .” Swint, 498 F.3d at 999 (quoting Zatler,\n\n802 F.2d at 401) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). We further\n\nrecognized in Swint that “it is clear that the inquiry into causation must be a\n\ndirected one, focusing on the duties and responsibilities of each of the individual\n\ndefendants whose acts or omissions are alleged to have resulted in a constitutional\n\ndeprivation.” Swint, 51 F.3d at 999 (quoting Williams v. Bennett, 689 F.2d 1370,\n\n1381 (11th Cir. 1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). It\n\nwould be strange, indeed, for us to have acknowledged these requirements and\n\nthen not have actually considered them in our analysis. But to reach the dissent’s\n\nconclusion, that is precisely what we would have had to have done.\n\n\n\n\n                                        27\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 28 of 44\n\n\n      Moreover, besides talking the talk, we walked the walk with regard to all\n\nthree defendants. That is, we actually applied the Zatler causation requirements to\n\nall three defendants. The dissent seems to suggest that we considered only Sheriff\n\nMorgan’s argument that the plaintiffs did not allege facts showing that he\n\nspecifically violated their particular rights and that we did not consider that\n\nargument with respect to Dendinger or Chief Morgan. See Dissent at 7-8. But the\n\nopinion in Swint reflects that we specifically considered this very argument as it\n\npertained to all three Swint defendants: Sheriff Morgan, Dendinger, and Chief\n\nMorgan.\n\n      With regard to Sheriff Morgan, we first described the sheriff’s argument as\n\nfollows: “According to the Sheriff, ‘the focus must center on the actions taken by\n\n[him] and the information he possessed in taking those actions.’” Id. at 999\n\n(emphasis added). We then explained that Sheriff Morgan’s argument failed for\n\ntwo reasons. First, we said, “although § 1983 does require proof of an affirmative\n\ncausal connection between the official’s acts or omissions and the alleged\n\nconstitutional deprivation, ‘[p]ersonal participation . . . is only one of several ways\n\nto establish the requisite causal connection.’” id. (quoting Zatler, 802 F.2d at\n\n401) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).            Put simply, we\n\nannounced that we were considering whether Zatler’s causal-connection\n\nrequirement was met. We reasoned that liability could be imposed on Sheriff\n\n                                          28\n\f              Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 29 of 44\n\n\nMorgan because a causal connection between his actions and the plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional deprivations existed, although he was present for neither raid, based\n\non Sheriff Morgan’s approval of an improper policy regarding the raids.\n\n       Second, we concluded that Sheriff Morgan’s argument that the plaintiffs did\n\nnot adequately demonstrate that he was responsible for their constitutional\n\ndeprivations failed because “even if Sheriff Morgan had a reasonable basis for\n\nbelieving that his policies and training were adequate going into the first raid, that\n\nfails to explain why he authorized exactly the same conduct three months later in\n\nMarch of 1991, when he had reason to know better.” Id.\n\n       As for Dendinger and Chief Morgan, significantly, the very next sentence\n\nand paragraph in the opinion start with the word “similarly” and then go on to\n\napply the same logic just applied to Sheriff Morgan to Chief Morgan and\n\nDendinger, demonstrating that we also specifically considered whether Chief\n\nMorgan and Dendinger should be denied qualified immunity where the record\n\ncontained no allegations concerning their specific actions with respect to particular\n\nplaintiffs:\n\n              Similarly, even if Chief Morgan and Officer Dendinger\n              had not been fully aware of the Task Force’s plan of\n              attack before the first raid, as participants in the first raid\n              they had ample opportunity to determine before the\n              second raid was conducted whether the first had\n              comported with constitutional requirements.              Upon\n              learning of the manner in which the first raid was\n              conducted, reasonable law enforcement officials would\n                                            29\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 30 of 44\n\n\n             have been on notice that clearly established Fourth\n             Amendment rights had been violated. Willingness to\n             engage in the second raid demonstrated deliberate\n             indifference to those rights, and it reflected accession to\n             and adoption of the policies and procedures employed.\n\nId. at 999-1000 (emphasis added). In other words, we denied qualified immunity\n\nas to Lewis’s claims against Chief Morgan and Officer Dendinger based on Chief\n\nMorgan and Officer Dendinger’s mere personal participation in the second raid\n\nwhen they should have known that participation in such a warrantless search\n\nclearly violated the Fourth Amendment. Thus, it is clear that we did, in fact,\n\nconsider in Swint whether the general allegations concerning Chief Morgan and\n\nDendinger’s core “personal[] participat[ion]” in the warrantless searches satisfied\n\nZatler’s requirement that a directed inquiry into the actions of the defendants with\n\nrespect to the plaintiffs had been satisfied, and we concluded that it had. As a\n\nresult, Swint put Vidler and Leslie on notice that engaging in the type of\n\nwarrantless search conducted in Swint clearly violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\nNor does the fact that the district court did not cite Swint in its opinion and the\n\nplaintiffs did not cite it in their appellate brief somehow make Swint any less\n\nbinding precedent.\n\n      Finally, implicitly conceding that the raid in the instant case violated clearly\n\nestablished Fourth Amendment law, the dissent argues in its last attempt to resist\n\nthe constraints of Swint that we\n\n                                         30\n\f               Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014        Page: 31 of 44\n\n\n               conflate[] two distinct questions: whether a search\n               violates clearly established law, and who can sue whom\n               on the basis of that violation. The majority relies on\n               Swint’s conclusion that the officers in Swint knew the\n               planned raid violated “clearly established Fourth\n               Amendment rights,”[7] to draw the unrelated conclusion\n               that mere participation in such a raid is enough to expose\n               any officer to liability to any plaintiff.”\n\nDissent at 8. The problem with this argument arises from the fact that it does not\n\nacknowledge what we actually wrote in Swint. In addition to holding that the\n\nofficers knew that the raids in Swint violated clearly established Fourth\n\nAmendment rights, we found Zatler’s requirement of a causal connection between\n\nthe defendants’ actions and the plaintiffs’ constitutional deprivation to have been\n\nsatisfied by the Swint defendants’ personal participation in unlawfully searching\n\nthe club, in violation of the plaintiff owners’ rights, and detaining the plaintiff\n\nemployee and plaintiff patron, in violation of their respective rights.\n\n       Indeed, we said as much when we concluded with respect to Dendinger and\n\nChief Morgan’s personal participation in the second raid, “Upon learning of the\n\nmanner in which the first raid was conducted, reasonable law enforcement officials\n\nwould have been on notice that clearly established Fourth Amendment rights had\n\n\n\n       7\n         Here, the dissent appears to acknowledge that Swint concluded that raids of the type\nconducted in that case and in this one violate clearly established Fourth Amendment rights,\ndespite the dissent’s suggestion to the contrary three sentences later. See Dissent at 8 (“That is,\nthe decision that the majority cites as clearly establishing what these individual officers should\nhave known was never even mentioned by either the learned district judge or the plaintiffs’ own\ncounsel.”).\n                                                31\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 32 of 44\n\n\nbeen violated. Willingness to engage in the second raid demonstrated deliberate\n\nindifference to those rights . . . .” Swint, 51 F.3d at 999. This passage is composed\n\nof two distinct thoughts: the first sentence recognizes that the raids violated clearly\n\nestablished Fourth Amendment rights, while the second sentence takes the next\n\nstep and, based on the Swint defendants’ “deliberate indifference to [the Swint\n\nplaintiffs’ clearly established Fourth Amendment] rights” by engaging in the raids\n\ndespite their knowledge that the raids violated clearly established Fourth\n\nAmendment rights, finds a causal connection between the actions of the Swint\n\ndefendants and the constitutional injuries of the Swint plaintiffs and attaches\n\nliability to the defendants against the Swint plaintiffs whose clearly established\n\nFourth Amendment rights they violated. Thus, neither the Court in Swint nor we\n\nconflate the clearly established requirement and the causal-connection requirement.\n\n      If the facts of this case differ in any material manner from those of Swint, it\n\nis only that they are even more compelling. Whereas the Swint facts say nothing\n\nmore with respect to the second raid than that Dendinger and Chief Morgan\n\n“personally participated” in it, here, the plaintiffs have alleged not only that both\n\nVidler and Leslie “personally participated” in the search of Strictly Skillz, but that\n\nVidler planned and supervised the raid, and Leslie participated in the search of the\n\nshop used by all of the plaintiffs to earn a living and then slapped handcuffs on\n\nBerry when he expressed displeasure with the treatment of the other plaintiffs.\n\n                                          32\n\f               Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014        Page: 33 of 44\n\n\n       As in Swint, “[n]o reasonable officer in the defendants’ position could have\n\nbelieved that these were lawful, warrantless administrative searches.” See id. at\n\n999. Where, as alleged here, officers participate in a search that was clearly\n\nestablished to be illegal from its inception, they are simply not entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity any more than an officer who enters and searches a person’s home\n\nwithout a warrant or an applicable warrant exception. This is not a case where a\n\ngroup of officers entered a location to execute a validly obtained search warrant,\n\nand, without the approval of the other officers participating in the authorized\n\nsearch, one or two officers went off on an unconstitutional frolic of their own.\n\nHere, the entire search itself was unlawful from the beginning, and Vidler and\n\nLeslie, who fully participated in it, could reasonably be found to have violated the\n\nrights of all of the barbers searched and all of the barbers with a Fourth\n\nAmendment interest in Strictly Skillz’s space, regardless of what each officer did\n\none on one to each particular plaintiff barber.\n\n       Each officer’s discrete actions in what was clearly an unlawful search from\n\nthe outset are not the focus of our inquiry here. Rather, the conduct under scrutiny\n\nis the officers’ core participation in the warrantless search itself. 8 Vidler and\n\n\n\n       8\n         Several of our sister circuits have similarly held that personal participation in an\nunconstitutional search is sufficient to establish liability. See, e.g., James by James v. Sadler,\n909 F.2d 834, 837–38 (5th Cir. 1990) (“[A]ll defendants’ participation in the search and\ndetention would be sufficient to impose liability under § 1983.”); Melear v. Spears, 862 F.2d\n1177, 1186 (5th Cir. 1989) (“[The officer] was a full, active participant in the search, not a mere\n                                                33\n\f                Case: 13-14092         Date Filed: 09/16/2014        Page: 34 of 44\n\n\nLeslie were not alleged to have engaged in segregable conduct outside of the\n\nclearly unlawful search that was otherwise occurring while they happened to be\n\npresent and engaging in lawful activity.                   Instead, Vidler and Leslie were\n\nentrenched participants in the warrantless search, which, from the start, violated\n\nthe Fourth Amendment.\n\n        It has long been clearly established that a warrantless administrative\n\ninspection must be narrowly tailored to the administrative need that justifies it.\n\nHere—where the authorized purpose of the inspection was simply to check for\n\nbarbering licenses and sanitation violations, and there is no indication that the\n\ndefendants had any reason to believe that the inspection would be met with\n\nviolence—the manner in which the supposed inspection of Strictly Skillz was\n\nundertaken was unreasonable from its inception and was, in fact, a search. Our\n\ncases and those of the Supreme Court have long and repeatedly put officers on\n\nnotice of these facts. Because, under the facts alleged by the plaintiffs in this case,\n\nVidler and Leslie were active participants in the unconstitutional search of Strictly\n\n\n\n\nbystander. . . . Because the jury could properly have found that the search was unconstitutional, it\nwas also justified in finding both officers liable for their integral participation in the violation.”);\nHopkins v. Bonvicino, 573 F.3d 752, 770 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[T]he ‘integral participant’ rule . . .\nextends liability to those actors who were integral participants in the constitutional violation,\neven if they did not directly engage in the unconstitutional conduct themselves.”); Russo v.\nMassullo, 927 F.2d 605 (6th Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (“The defendants attempt to evade liability\nby pointing to each other. However, their arguments are unpersuasive in light of cases holding\nthat all members of the team are liable where there is a team effort or where the members were\nan integral part of an unlawful search and seizure.”).\n                                                  34\n\f            Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 35 of 44\n\n\nSkillz, a jury could find them liable for the plaintiffs’ resulting constitutional\n\ninjuries. We therefore AFFIRM the order below.\n\n\n\n\n                                       35\n\f             Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 36 of 44\n\n\nWILLIAM PRYOR, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n        I agree with the majority opinion that the search of the barbershop\n\nexceeded the scope of a reasonable administrative inspection and that the barbers\n\npresented evidence that Corporal Keith Vidler, as the supervisor, violated their\n\nclearly established constitutional rights. I also agree that Brian Berry presented\n\nevidence that Deputy Travis Leslie, who handcuffed Berry and patted him down,\n\nviolated his clearly established constitutional rights. But Edwyn Durant, Reginald\n\nTrammon, and Jermario Anderson presented no evidence that Deputy Travis Leslie\n\nviolated their constitutional rights. Even though the inspection of the barbershop\n\nappeared to be “a scene right out of a Hollywood movie” (Majority Op. at 1), we\n\ncannot bend the law to resolve this appeal with a feel-good ending from a box-\n\noffice hit. The law entitles Leslie to qualified immunity against any barber who\n\nfailed to present evidence that Leslie personally deprived him of a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional right. Durant, Trammon, and Anderson failed to prove an\n\naffirmative causal connection between their specific injuries and Leslie’s conduct.\n\nFor that reason, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n      I agree with the majority that, to establish “an ‘affirmative causal\n\nconnection’ between the official and the alleged deprivation,” the barbers “must\n\nshow that the official was personally involved in the acts that resulted in the\n\nconstitutional deprivation.” (Majority Op. at 20 (quoting Zatler v. Wainwright, 802\n\n                                          36\n\f             Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 37 of 44\n\n\nF.2d 397, 401 (11th Cir. 1986)).) And counsel for the barbers acknowledged at oral\n\nargument that our precedents “require” us to compare “each officer’s actions” to\n\nthe injury suffered by “each individual plaintiff.” But, after reciting the correct\n\ngoverning law, the majority fails to consider whether each barber proved a causal\n\nconnection between his specific injury and Deputy Leslie’s conduct.\n\n      Durant, Trammon, and Anderson failed to present evidence that Leslie\n\npersonally violated their constitutional rights. Durant testified that a male deputy\n\nwearing a uniform searched his workstation and ordered him to sit down, but he\n\nfailed to identify that male deputy as Leslie. Although Leslie wore a uniform, more\n\nthan one uniformed, male deputy participated in the search. Trammon testified that\n\ntwo female deputies handcuffed and searched him. Trammon also testified that a\n\nfemale inspector and another officer searched his workstation, but he failed to\n\nidentify the other officer as Leslie. And counsel for the barbers conceded at oral\n\nargument that “there is no evidence that [Leslie] did anything personally to . . .\n\nTramm[on].” Finally, Anderson testified that a short, male deputy wearing a mask\n\nand bulletproof vest handcuffed him and searched his workstation. But Leslie was\n\nnot wearing a bulletproof vest and was not wearing a mask. And, despite having\n\nseen Leslie handcuff Berry, none of the barbers testified that the officer who\n\nsearched him was the same officer who handcuffed Berry.\n\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\f              Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 38 of 44\n\n\n      The majority asserts that “[t]he record clearly supports a finding that” Leslie\n\nwas an “active and full participant[] in the unconstitutional intrusion” because\n\nLeslie “placed [Brian Berry] in handcuffs and helped to execute the\n\nunconstitutional search of the shop and barbering stations,” (id. at 21), but “the\n\ninquiry into causation must be a directed one, focusing on the duties and\n\nresponsibilities of each of the individual defendants whose acts or omissions are\n\nalleged to have resulted in a constitutional deprivation,” Swint v. City of Wadley,\n\nAla., 51 F.3d 988, 999 (11th Cir. 1995). We must recall that the barbers sued Leslie\n\nin his individual capacity for money damages. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n\n800, 814, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 2736 (1982). To be sure, each barber suffered a\n\nviolation of his constitutional rights, and each barber has a valid claim against any\n\nofficer who participated in that barber’s injury. But the other barbers cannot\n\npiggyback on the violation of Berry’s constitutional rights to obtain damages from\n\nLeslie’s pocket for violations caused by other officers. And Leslie’s general\n\n“help[] . . . execut[ing]” the search, (Majority Op. at 21), is not sufficient to\n\ndeprive him of qualified immunity, see Zatler, 802 F.2d at 401; see also Rizzo v.\n\nGoode, 423 U.S. 362, 371, 96 S. Ct. 598, 604 (1976) (dismissing a claim under\n\nsection 1983 because the plaintiffs proved only that “[i]ndividual police officers\n\nnot named as parties to the action were found to have violated the constitutional\n\nrights of particular individuals, only a few of whom were parties plaintiff” and thus\n\n                                           38\n\f              Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 39 of 44\n\n\nthere was no “affirmative link” between the actual defendants and the plaintiffs)\n\n(emphasis omitted); cf. Brown v. City of Huntsville, Ala., 608 F.3d 724, 737 (11th\n\nCir. 2010) (“Merely being present . . . at the scene is not enough.”). Unlike Berry,\n\nDurant, Trammon, and Anderson failed to present any evidence that Deputy Leslie\n\nparticipated in any way in inflicting the constitutional injuries that they suffered.\n\n      The majority boasts that “it is difficult to imagine a straighter application of\n\nbinding precedent than Swint to the facts of this case,” but its reading of Swint is\n\nfar from “a straight[] application of binding precedent.” (Majority Op. at 22.) The\n\nmajority points out that “nothing in the facts set forth in Swint identifies what [the\n\nofficer] or [the police chief] did directly or particularly to any of the plaintiffs” and\n\nyet the Swint court ruled “that qualified immunity had to be denied to all three\n\nofficers with respect to all four plaintiffs because, among other reasons, ‘no\n\nreasonable officer in the defendants’ position could have believed that these were\n\nlawful, warrantless administrative searches.’” (Majority Op. at 24–25 (quoting\n\nSwint, 51 F.3d at 999).) The majority construes this lack of discussion as a binding\n\ncommand not to engage in a particularized analysis of each plaintiff’s injury and\n\neach defendant’s conduct. According to that reading, the four plaintiffs in Swint,\n\nplus every other employee and patron, would have a valid claim against not only\n\nthe police chief, sheriff, and officer, but also all “30 to 40 officers” who\n\nparticipated in the raid. (Majority Op. at 24.) But Swint holds nothing of the kind.\n\n                                           39\n\f             Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 40 of 44\n\n\nAt the very least, the police chief in Swint was a supervisor who, like Vidler, could\n\nbe liable for the violations of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights even without\n\npersonally participating in the violations, so the court would have no reason to\n\nanalyze his conduct as related to each plaintiff’s injury. And we can only speculate\n\nwhy the court did not discuss the officer’s role in each plaintiff’s injury—perhaps\n\nthe officer failed to raise the defense. Our decision in Swint did not consider at all\n\nthe argument raised by Deputy Leslie in this appeal—whether an officer can be\n\nliable for violations of clearly established constitutional rights that he did not\n\ncommit or that were not pursuant to a policy that he approved.\n\n      Let’s be clear about what the majority reads Swint to require. Under the\n\nmajority’s reading, every officer at the scene of an invalid search is liable for every\n\nviolation of every plaintiff’s rights. Even those officers who do not so much as\n\nlook in the direction of a plaintiff, or so much as breathe on a plaintiff’s property,\n\nor have any supervisory responsibility over the offending officers, will\n\nnevertheless be liable to every plaintiff due to the officers’ “mere personal\n\nparticipation” when they “should have known that participation in such a . . .\n\nsearch clearly violated the Fourth Amendment.” (Majority Op. at 30.) And so the\n\nmajority holds Deputy Leslie is subject to liability, despite no record evidence that\n\nLeslie touched Durant, Trammon, or Anderson, no record evidence that Leslie\n\ntouched any property belonging to Durant, Trammon, or Anderson, and no record\n\n                                           40\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 41 of 44\n\n\nevidence that Leslie supervised any of the officers who searched or seized property\n\nof Durant, Trammon, and Anderson.\n\n      Let’s be just as clear that this is not what Swint requires. Swint proceeded, in\n\nrelevant part, by addressing only three arguments raised by the officers in that\n\nappeal. First, the “[d]efendants argued” that “the search . . . was pursuant to\n\nprobable cause and exigent circumstances.” 51 F.3d at 996 (alteration and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). As to probable cause, the officers argued that both\n\ngeneral information about the club and the “drug transactions that preceded each of\n\nthe raids” provided probable cause for the search. Id. at 997. After recounting the\n\npolice chief’s and sheriff’s testimony, we ruled that the general information about\n\nthe club did not amount to arguable probable cause and that “[p]robable cause to\n\narrest one suspect . . . did not give the officers carte blanche to seize everyone who\n\nhappened to be in the Club when the two raids took place.” Id. And we explained\n\nthat “[w]e need not address defendants’ exigent circumstances argument,” because\n\nwe had already concluded that the officers lacked probable cause and “it is well-\n\nsettled that . . . warrantless searches and seizures require that both probable cause\n\nand exigent circumstances exist.” Id. at 998 (alteration and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Second, the “[d]efendants argue[d]” that “the two raids were\n\nadministrative searches of the Club to which the Club owners had previously\n\nconsented.” Id. We ruled that the facts “simply [did] not support an administrative\n\n                                          41\n\f              Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 42 of 44\n\n\nsearch theory” because the raids involved a “massive show of force and excessive\n\nintrusion,” and “the officers did not simply search for violations of the liquor\n\nlaws.” Id. at 998–99. Third, “Sheriff Morgan advance[d] another argument on the\n\nquestion of . . . whether he engaged in conduct violative of the rights established\n\nby clearly-established law.” Id. at 999 (emphasis added) (alteration and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). As to this argument raised only by the sheriff, we\n\nexplained that, “although § 1983 does require proof of an affirmative causal\n\nconnection between the official’s acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional\n\ndeprivation, personal participation is only one of several ways to establish the\n\nrequisite causal connection.” Id. (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWe explained that we also may impose liability “due to the existence of an\n\nimproper policy.” Id. (internal quotation mark omitted). We then considered the\n\ninformation known to the sheriff and ruled that he had authorized an improper\n\npolicy. Id.\n\n      To be sure, Swint clearly established that the information known to the\n\nofficers about the club does not amount to arguable probable cause for a raid; that a\n\nsingle drug transaction does not amount to arguable probable cause to search an\n\nentire establishment; that massive shows of force amount to unreasonable\n\nadministrative inspections; and that owners and patrons can establish an\n\naffirmative causal connection between the violations of their constitutional rights\n\n                                          42\n\f              Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 43 of 44\n\n\nand a supervisor, like the sheriff, if the supervisor approved a policy that allowed\n\nthe violations. But Swint said nothing at all about—much less clearly established—\n\nwhether every person present during an unreasonable search has a valid claim\n\nagainst every officer who participated in that search.\n\n       I part ways with the majority because it conflates two distinct questions:\n\nwhether a search violates clearly established law, and who can sue whom on the\n\nbasis of that violation. The majority relies on Swint’s conclusion that the officers in\n\nSwint knew the planned raid violated “clearly established Fourth Amendment\n\nrights,” to draw the unrelated conclusion that mere participation in such a raid is\n\nenough to expose any officer to liability to any plaintiff. (Majority Op. at 30\n\n(quoting Swint, 51 F.3d at 999–1000).) But the central issue in Swint was whether\n\nthe officers would have been on notice that the raid violated clearly established\n\nFourth Amendment rights. The answer to that question does not establish whose\n\nFourth Amendment rights they violated. Perhaps for that reason, neither the district\n\ncourt in its order nor the barbers in their brief even cite to Swint at all. That is, the\n\ndecision that the majority cites as clearly establishing what these individual\n\nofficers should have known was never even mentioned by either the learned\n\ndistrict judge or the plaintiffs’ own counsel.\n\n       Because Durant, Trammon, and Anderson failed to prove a causal link\n\nbetween Deputy Leslie’s conduct and their constitutional deprivations, I\n\n                                            43\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 44 of 44\n\n\nrespectfully concur in part and dissent in part. I would reverse the denial of\n\nsummary judgment for the claims brought by Anderson, Durant, and Trammon\n\nagainst Leslie and render partial summary judgment in his favor.\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\f",

On August 21, 2010, after\n\nmore than a month of planning, teams from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office\n\ndescended on multiple target locations. They blocked the entrances and exits to\n\nthe parking lots so no one could leave and no one could enter. With some team\n\nmembers dressed in ballistic vests and masks, and with guns drawn, the deputies\n\nrushed into their target destinations, handcuffed the stunned occupants—and\n\ndemanded to see their barbers’ licenses. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office was\n\nproviding muscle for the Florida Department of Business and Professional\n\nRegulation’s administrative inspection of barbershops to discover licensing\n\nviolations.\n\n      We first held nineteen years ago that conducting a run-of-the-mill\n\nadministrative inspection as though it is a criminal raid, when no indication exists\n\nthat safety will be threatened by the inspection, violates clearly established Fourth\n\nAmendment rights.

We hope that the third time will be the\n\ncharm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      The instant case arises from an unannounced, warrantless inspection of a\n\nbarbershop by officers of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office (“OCSO”) and\n\nrepresentatives from the Florida Department of Business and Professional\n\nRegulation (“DBPR”). On August 21, 2010, OCSO and the DBPR conducted\n\nplanned sweeps of several barbershops, located in predominantly Hispanic and\n\nAfrican-American neighborhoods, with the purported intent of discovering\n\nviolations of state licensing laws.\n\n      Plaintiff-Appellee Brian Berry is the sole owner of Strictly Skillz\n\nBarbershop, one of the targets of the operation. Berry is a licensed barber and has\n\nbeen operating Strictly Skillz since 2007. Plaintiffs-Appellees Edwyn Durant,\n\nReginald Trammon, and Jermario Anderson are licensed barbers who rent\n\nbarbering chairs at Strictly Skillz for a weekly rental fee. All four plaintiffs, who\n\nwere subject to OCSO and the DBPR’s “administrative inspection” of Strictly\n\nSkillz, sued several OCSO officers, including Appellants Corporal Keith Vidler\n\nand Deputy Travis Leslie, alleging that the officers violated their Fourth\n\nAmendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                 Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014       Page: 4 of 44\n\n\n                                                   II.\n\n      The DBPR is tasked with regulating and enforcing statutes and rules\n\nassociated with professional licenses. Barbershops are subject to this regulatory\n\nframework and are governed by § 476.184, Fla. Stat., and its implementing rules.\n\nUnder the rules, DBPR inspectors are authorized to conduct biennial inspections to\n\nensure that barbershops are in compliance with state licensing and sanitation laws.\n\nBut the DBPR is not empowered to take law-enforcement action and must rely on\n\nlocal law enforcement to address violations of state law.\n\n      The impetus for the sting operation stemmed from a chance encounter\n\nbetween DBPR inspector Amanda Fields and Corporal Vidler, during which Fields\n\ncomplained of some of the difficulties that she had encountered in conducting her\n\nbarbershop inspections. Upon discovering that barbering without a license is a\n\nsecond-degree misdemeanor under Florida law, see Fla. Stat. § 476.194,1 Vidler\n\n\n      1\n          Section 476.194, Fla. Stat., provides,\n\n                (1) It is unlawful for any person to:\n\n                       (a) Engage in the practice of barbering without an active\n                       license as a barber issued pursuant to the provisions of this\n                       act by the department.\n\n                       (b) Hire or employ any person to engage in the practice of\n                       barbering unless such person holds a valid license as a\n                       barber.\n\n                       (c) Obtain or attempt to obtain a license for money other\n                       than the required fee or any other thing of value or by\n                       fraudulent misrepresentations.\n                                                   4\n\f                Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014       Page: 5 of 44\n\n\nbecame intrigued by the possibility of a collaboration between the DBPR and\n\nOCSO and spent over a month, together with other OCSO officers and DBPR\n\nrepresentatives, developing a plan for a joint sweep operation of various\n\nbarbershops and salons. The barbershops chosen for the operation were apparently\n\nselected because they or barbers within them had on previous occasions failed to\n\ncooperate with DBPR inspectors.2                  All of the targeted barbershops were\n\nbusinesses that serviced primarily African-American and Hispanic clientele.\n\n       Vidler prepared the OCSO Operations Plan, which provided that the sweeps\n\nwould be executed by two teams, each consisting of a supervisor, a narcotics agent,\n\na plain-clothes deputy, three uniformed deputies, and two DBPR agents. Although\n\nthe stated goal of the operation was “to assist the DBPR in the detention and\n\n\n\n                       (d) Own, operate, maintain, open, establish, conduct, or\n                       have charge of, either alone or with another person or\n                       persons, a barbershop:\n\n                              1. Which is not licensed under the provisions of this\n                              chapter; or\n\n                              2. In which a person not licensed as a barber is\n                              permitted to perform services.\n\n                       (e) Use or attempt to use a license to practice barbering\n                       when said license is suspended or revoked.\n       (2) Any person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of\n       the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.\n       2\n          Strictly Skillz was included on this list because during two routine inspections in 2007,\na DBPR inspector reported that barbers had refused to produce their licenses when asked to do\nso. It is not clear from the record whether these incidents occurred before or after Berry\npurchased the business.\n                                                 5\n\f               Case: 13-14092   Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 6 of 44\n\n\nidentification of unlicensed barbers and hair stylist[s],” the plan also contemplated\n\nother law-enforcement objectives.      For example, the plan provided that any\n\ncontraband discovered during the inspection had to be turned over to OCSO for\n\nprosecution and that the officers, with the assistance of narcotics agents, would\n\nidentify and handle any narcotics, gather intelligence, and interview potential\n\nconfidential informants.\n\n      On August 19, 2010, two days before the sweep, Inspector Fields and\n\nanother DBPR inspector conducted walkthroughs of six of the target locations,\n\nincluding Strictly Skillz. Though the purpose of the walkthrough was to gather\n\ninformation for the operation, the inspectors did so under the guise of performing a\n\nroutine inspection, verifying that the barbers’ licenses were current and valid and\n\ninspecting the barbers’ workstations. During the inspection of Strictly Skillz, the\n\nbarbers were cooperative, no violations were found, and no citations were issued.\n\nInspector Fields even commended Berry on the tremendous progress he had made\n\nin the shop.\n\n      Despite the fact that just two days earlier Strictly Skillz had passed\n\ninspection without any problems whatsoever and that the DBPR is permitted to\n\nconduct inspections only once every two years, on August 21, 2010, OCSO and the\n\nDBPR conducted a second inspection as part of the sting operation. The record,\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, reveals that the sweep of\n\n                                         6\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 7 of 44\n\n\nStrictly Skillz occurred as follows: Two plain clothes officers initially entered the\n\nbarbershop to observe any potential violations. Five or six barbers were on duty at\n\nthe time, and the shop was filled with anywhere from ten to twenty-five waiting\n\ncustomers. As the first day of the school year was approaching, several of the\n\ncustomers in the shop were children.\n\n      Shortly after the arrival of the plain-clothes officers, a “whole bunch” of\n\npolice cars pulled into the shopping plaza and completely blocked off the parking\n\nlot, preventing all ingress and egress. Officers then “rushed into” Strictly Skillz\n\n“like [a] SWAT team.” Based on the plaintiffs’ collective recollection, it appears\n\nthat somewhere between eight and ten officers, including narcotics agents,\n\ndescended upon the barbershop, along with a DBPR inspector.              Some of the\n\nofficers donned masks and bulletproof vests and had their guns drawn.            The\n\nofficers immediately ordered all of the customers to exit the shop and announced\n\nthat the shop was “closed down indefinitely.”\n\n      Plaintiffs Trammon, Anderson, and Durant were in the barbershop when the\n\nofficers stormed in. The officers directed Anderson and Durant to present their\n\ndriver’s licenses for identification, and Inspector Fields instructed Anderson to\n\nretrieve his barbering license from his work station. Trammon and Anderson, who\n\nwere in the process of cutting customers’ hair, were then immediately patted down\n\nand handcuffed with plastic zip ties. Anderson was handcuffed by a masked\n\n                                         7\n\f              Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 8 of 44\n\n\nofficer, and Trammon was restrained by two deputies who were not wearing\n\nmasks. Sometime after Trammon was handcuffed, he informed the officers that he\n\nwas in possession of a concealed firearm for which he had a valid concealed-\n\nweapons permit. The officers patted him down to retrieve the weapon and located\n\nthe permit without incident.\n\n      Vidler, who was the supervisor on the scene, admits that he ordered deputies\n\nto detain Trammon. When Trammon argued to one of the officers that he had done\n\nnothing wrong, the officer responded, “It’s a pretty big book, I’m pretty sure I can\n\nfind something in here to take you to jail for.” Durant, though told to “sit down\n\nand shut up,” was not handcuffed and was eventually permitted to leave the shop.\n\n      Shortly thereafter, Berry, who had been behind the shop in the parking lot\n\nwhen the officers initially entered, walked into Strictly Skillz through the back\n\nentrance. Upon seeing that Trammon and Anderson were in handcuffs and being\n\npatted down by officers, Berry made his way to the front of the shop, identified\n\nhimself as the owner, and demanded to know what was going on and why\n\nTrammon and Anderson were in handcuffs.            Deputy Leslie then immediately\n\nplaced Berry into metal handcuffs and patted him down. Though angry, Berry did\n\nnot physically resist and complied with the officers’ instructions.\n\n      While Trammon, Anderson, and Berry were restrained, Inspector Fields and\n\nthe OCSO officers conducted their “inspection” of the barbershop. OCSO officers\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 9 of 44\n\n\ncalled in the barbers’ driver’s license information to ascertain whether any of them\n\nhad outstanding warrants, and Inspector Fields, for the second time in two days,\n\nchecked the barbering licenses to ensure that they were still valid and current. The\n\nofficers, along with Inspector Fields, then searched the premises by inspecting each\n\nof the barbers’ workstations and looking through their drawers. OCSO officers\n\nalso went to the back of the shop without Inspector Fields and searched through an\n\nunlocked storage room where no barbering services were rendered.\n\n      At the conclusion of the inspection, it was determined that all of the barbers\n\nhad valid licenses and that the barbershop was in compliance with all safety and\n\nsanitation rules. No criminal violations were discovered, and Berry, Anderson, and\n\nTrammon were released from their handcuffs.             The entire inspection lasted\n\napproximately one hour.        After the officers and Inspector Fields left, the\n\nbarbershop resumed operations.3\n\n                                          III.\n\n      Following the search of Strictly Skillz, the plaintiffs filed the present suit\n\nagainst a number of the officers involved, including Vidler and Leslie, alleging,\n\namong other things, that the barbershop inspection constituted an unlawful search\n\nin violation of the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights. Vidler and Leslie each\n\nmoved for summary judgment on qualified-immunity grounds. The district court\n\n      3\n        After the August 21 sweep, OCSO and the DBPR conducted a second barbershop sting\non September 17, 2010, targeting two barbershops and a hair and nail salon.\n                                            9\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 10 of 44\n\n\ndenied summary judgment as to the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims, finding\n\nthat although OCSO and the DBPR validly invoked their statutory authority to\n\ninspect Strictly Skillz to determine whether barbers were operating without a\n\nlicense, the law regarding administrative searches was clearly established, and a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the administrative search was\n\nappropriately limited in scope. The district court also found that the plaintiffs had\n\nsufficiently established a causal link between the officers’ involvement and the\n\nalleged constitutional violations.   Vidler and Leslie now appeal the denial of\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                        IV.\n\n      We review de novo a district court’s denial of summary judgment based on\n\nqualified immunity, applying the same legal standards that governed the district\n\ncourt.

See Burger, 482 U.S. at 702, 107 S. Ct. at 2643.\n\nBecause an owner or operator of commercial property “has a reduced expectation\n\nof privacy” in this context, the standard for what may be reasonable under the\n\nFourth Amendment is correspondingly broader. See id. at 702−03, 107 S. Ct. at\n\n2643–44.\n\n      To fall within this exception, a warrantless inspection must satisfy three\n\ncriteria: (1) “a ‘substantial’ government interest [must] inform[] the regulatory\n\nscheme pursuant to which the inspection is made,” id. at 702, 107 S.

Bruce, 498 F.3d at 1239−40 (citations\n\nomitted).   Above all, such inspections may never circumvent the Fourth\n\nAmendment’s requirement for reasonableness. See id. at 1244 (“As with any\n\nsearch, then, the scope and execution of an administrative inspection must be\n\nreasonable in order to be constitutional.”).    In this regard, “an administrative\n\nscreening search must be as limited in its intrusiveness as is consistent with\n\nsatisfaction of the administrative need that justifies it.” Id. at 1248 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      As detailed earlier, the regulatory framework for barbershop inspections in\n\nFlorida is embodied in Fla. Stat. § 476.184 and its implementing rules.           In\n\nparticular, § 476.184 requires all barbershops to have a license issued by the DBPR\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                 Case: 13-14092       Date Filed: 09/16/2014       Page: 15 of 44\n\n\nand directs the Florida Barbers’ Board 4 to “adopt rules governing the operation and\n\nperiodic inspection of barbershops licensed” in Florida. Rule 61G3-19.015(1), Fla.\n\nAdmin. Code, in turn, provides that the DBPR may conduct inspections biennially\n\non a “random, unannounced basis.” 5 The regulatory framework, which sets forth\n\nwho may conduct such inspections, notifies barbers that only the DBPR is so\n\nauthorized. See Burger, 482 U.S. at 711, 107 S. Ct. at 2648 (finding that the\n\nstatute at issue in that case provided a “constitutionally adequate substitute for a\n\nwarrant,” in part because “it notifie[d] the operator as to who [was] authorized to\n\nconduct an inspection”). In this case, no one disputes that the DBPR possesses\n\nstatutory authority to conduct warrantless inspections of barbershops, nor do the\n\nparties assert that the statute authorizing such inspections is constitutionally\n\nimpermissible.\n\n       Instead, the plaintiffs contend that the search of Strictly Skillz, which they\n\nallege was undertaken with an inordinate display of force, failed to conform to the\n\nFourth Amendment’s requirement for reasonableness. Because we have twice\n\n\n       4\n       Section 476.184, Fla. Stat., authorizes the creation of the Barbers’ Board within the\nDepartment of Business and Professional Regulation.\n       5\n           Rule 61G3-19.015(1), Fla. Admin. Code, reads, in its entirety,\n                 Inspections conducted by the Department of Business and\n                 Professional Regulation of barbershops to determine whether such\n                 barbershops are in compliance with the applicable provisions of\n                 Chapter 476, [Fla. Stat.], and the rules promulgated thereunder\n                 shall be conducted biennially, effective July 1, 2010, on a random\n                 unannounced basis, unless otherwise practicable.\n                                                 15\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 16 of 44\n\n\nheld, on facts disturbingly similar to those presented here, that a criminal raid\n\nexecuted under the guise of an administrative inspection is constitutionally\n\nunreasonable, we agree.\n\n      We first undertook this analysis in Swint v. City of Wadley, where we\n\nreviewed the constitutionality of two law-enforcement raids on a nightclub. The\n\nraids were executed with the aid of SWAT team members, several of the officers\n\npointed their weapons at patrons, and the club patrons and employees were\n\nsearched and detained for over an hour and a half. Swint, 51 F.3d at 993. Based\n\non these facts, we rejected the officers’ contention that the searches were valid\n\nadministrative inspections, specifically noting that the “massive show of force and\n\nexcessive intrusion” displayed during the raids far exceeded that of previous\n\nadministrative inspections of the club. Id. at 999. We also emphasized that no\n\nreasonable officer in the defendants’ position could have believed that the raids\n\nwere lawful, administrative searches. Id.\n\n      More recently, in Bruce v. Beary, this Court again detailed the\n\nconstitutionally permissible scope of administration inspections. Bruce, 498 F.3d\n\nat 1232.   There, officers of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office—the same\n\norganization involved in the barbershop sweeps—conducted a raid on an auto-\n\nbody repair shop. See id. at 1236. The search involved a group of twenty officers\n\nwho surrounded the premises and blocked all of the exits. Id. Some of the officers\n\n                                        16\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 17 of 44\n\n\nwere dressed in SWAT uniforms with ballistic vests. Id. The officers entered the\n\nshop with guns drawn, ordering all of the employees to line up along a fence. Id.\n\nThen the officers patted down and searched the employees. Id. Under these\n\ncircumstances, we held that the search, which was more akin to a criminal raid\n\nthan a routine inspection, exceeded the bounds of the Fourth Amendment. See id.\n\nat 1245. As the inspection of books and records “does not require exits to be\n\nblocked, an automatic shotgun to be stuck into an employee’s back, employees to\n\nbe lined up along a fence and patted down and deprived of their identification,” we\n\nconcluded that the search far surpassed its statutory authorization and was\n\nconstitutionally unreasonable. Id.\n\n       The facts of this case, which bear striking similarities to those described\n\nabove, cannot escape the tight grasp of Swint and Bruce.            Unlike previous\n\ninspections of Strictly Skillz, which were all conducted by a single DBPR\n\ninspector without the aid of law enforcement, the August 21 search was executed\n\nwith a tremendous and disproportionate show of force, and no evidence exists that\n\nsuch force was justified. Despite the fact that neither OCSO nor the DBPR had\n\nany reason to believe that the inspection of Strictly Skillz posed a threat to officer\n\nsafety, the record indicates that several OCSO officers entered the barbershop\n\nwearing masks and bulletproof vests, and with guns drawn; surrounded the\n\nbuilding and blocked all of the exits; forced all of the children and other customers\n\n                                         17\n\f               Case: 13-14092       Date Filed: 09/16/2014       Page: 18 of 44\n\n\nto leave; announced that the business was “closed down indefinitely”; and\n\nhandcuffed and conducted pat-down searches of the employees while the officers\n\nsearched the premises. Such a search, which bears no resemblance to a routine\n\ninspection for barbering licenses, is certainly not reasonable in scope and\n\nexecution. Rather, “[i]t is the conduct of officers conducting a raid.” Bruce, 498\n\nF.3d at 1245.6\n\n       The show of force and search were all the more unreasonable in view of the\n\nfact that DBPR inspectors visited Strictly Skillz a mere two days before the search\n\nand had already determined that the barbershop and its employees were in\n\ncompliance with state regulations. Thus, the subsequent sting operation at Strictly\n\nSkillz, the very purpose of which was to check for licensing violations, was\n\ngratuitous at best. Moreover, as the DBPR’s implementing rules contemplate only\n\nbiennial inspections, see Fla. Admin. Code 61G3-19.015, and no violation\n\n\n       6\n          To be clear, our basis for concluding that the search of Strictly Skillz was\nunconstitutional does not rest on the existence of any pretext on the part of OCSO and the\nDBPR. Indeed, we have previously recognized that administrative searches are not rendered\ninvalid because they are accompanied by some degree of suspicion, see Bruce, 498 F.3d at 1242,\nand the Supreme Court has similarly noted that suspicion of criminal activity will not defeat an\notherwise permissible administrative search, see United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110973\"><a href=\"/opinion/110973/united-states-v-villamonte-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 584 n.3, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110973\"><a href=\"/opinion/110973/united-states-v-villamonte-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, we do not consider whether the\nsting operation was pretextual; rather, our decision is based solely on our determination that the\nmanner in which the so-called inspection was executed far exceeded the bounds of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment. See Bruce, 498 F.3d at 1250 (Carnes, J.,\nconcurring) (“There was a Fourth Amendment violation in this case because the scope of the law\nenforcement intrusion exceeded that which is permissible during an administrative search alone.\nWhat happened in this case was more of a full scale raid and the kind of prolonged, top to bottom\nsearch that requires a warrant than it was an administrative search to determine compliance with\nlaws applicable to a closely regulated business.”).\n                                               18\n\f              Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 19 of 44\n\n\nwarranting a follow-up inspection had occurred, the second inspection also\n\nexceeded the scope of the DBPR’s statutory authority.\n\n      Not only that, but the statute authorizing administrative inspections of\n\nbarbershops vests authority to conduct the inspections in the DBPR alone. See Fla.\n\nStat. § 476.184; Fla. Admin. Code 61G3-19.015.            While law enforcement is\n\ncertainly permitted to accompany DBPR inspectors during their inspections to\n\nprovide any needed assistance and to arrest individuals whom the DBPR’s\n\ninspections determine to be in violation of the law, the administrative framework\n\ndoes not bestow upon police officers the authority to themselves conduct the\n\nbarbershop inspections. Despite this fact, OCSO officers did exactly that and\n\nmore; they themselves opened drawers in barbers’ workstations and searched a\n\nstorage closet in the back of Strictly Skillz.\n\n      Because the facts of this case—when viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nthe plaintiffs—adequately establish that the “inspection” of Strictly Skillz\n\namounted to an unconstitutional search and that the unconstitutionality of such a\n\nsearch was clearly established at the time that the search was executed, the\n\nplaintiffs have met their burden, and the district court properly determined that\n\nqualified immunity is inappropriate at this juncture.\n\n                                           B.\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 20 of 44\n\n\n       In affirming the denial of Vidler and Leslie’s qualified-immunity defense,\n\nwe do not depart from the long-standing principle that individual liability under §\n\n1983 must be premised on each defendant’s participation in the plaintiff’s\n\nconstitutional injury. Indeed, it is well established that in order to prevail on a §\n\n1983 claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate an “affirmative causal connection”\n\nbetween the official and the alleged deprivation. See Zatler, 802 F.2d at 401.\n\nMoreover, we recognize that each defendant is entitled to an independent analysis\n\nof the applicability of the qualified-immunity doctrine to his actions.\n\n      To establish the requisite causal link, a plaintiff must show that the official\n\nwas personally involved in the acts that resulted in the constitutional deprivation.\n\nZatler, 802 F.2d at 401 (citing Ancata v.

But this does not mean that a plaintiff\n\nmust catalog each and every specific action in which a defendant engaged if that\n\ndefendant was integrally involved in what was, from the outset, clearly an\n\nunreasonable search in violation of the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights. See\n\nSwint, 51 F.3d at 994 (where the defendants “personally participated” in an\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 21 of 44\n\n\n“inspection” conducted like a criminal raid, they were not entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity).\n\n      Vidler and Leslie argue that the district court did not adequately identify\n\ntheir personal involvement in the plaintiffs’ constitutional injuries for purposes of\n\nqualified immunity. We disagree.\n\n      The record clearly supports a finding that Vidler and Leslie were both active\n\nand full participants in the unconstitutional intrusion, which was unconstitutional\n\nfrom the moment that OCSO burst into Strictly Skillz in raid mode for the\n\nostensible purpose of helping DBPR review Strictly Skillz’s barbers’ licenses that\n\nit had just inspected two days earlier. Vidler was the catalyst for the entire\n\noperation and was primarily responsible for its planning and organization. He was\n\nalso present during the “inspection” and was the supervising officer on the scene.\n\nAs for Leslie, it is undisputed that he placed one of the plaintiffs in handcuffs and\n\nhelped to execute the unconstitutional search of the shop and barbering stations.\n\nThese alleged acts sufficiently demonstrate both Vidler and Leslie’s core\n\nparticipation in the warrantless search of Strictly Skillz and, if proven, violated the\n\nplaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.\n\n      Nor, as the dissent suggests, does declining to reverse the district court’s\n\ndenial of qualified immunity with respect to Trammon, Durant, and Anderson’s\n\nclaims against Leslie somehow “bend the law to resolve this appeal with a feel-\n\n                                          21\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 22 of 44\n\n\ngood ending from a box-office hit.” First, under the facts viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiffs, the only “hit” that happened in this case was on Strictly\n\nSkillz. Second, we highly doubt that the plaintiffs felt “good” when Vidler, Leslie,\n\nand the rest of the OCSO officers invaded their place of business with mask-and-\n\nbullet-proof-vest-donning officers with guns drawn, kicked their customers out on\n\none of the busiest days of the year and advised customers that Strictly Skillz was\n\n“closed down indefinitely,” and handcuffed the plaintiffs in the very spaces they\n\nrented.\n\n      And third, as for the law, we agree with our dissenting brother that judges\n\nshould not “bend the law” to make it fit their personal views. That is why we must\n\naffirm the district court’s denial of qualified immunity to Officer Leslie with\n\nregard to the claims of Trammon, Durant, and Anderson. Quite simply, binding\n\nprecedent requires it. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a straighter application of\n\nbinding precedent than Swint to the facts of this case. In Swint, 30 to 40 officers\n\nconducted “raids” of a nightclub under the guise of performing “administrative\n\nsearches.” 51 F.3d at 993. The plaintiffs in that case included Swint and Spradley,\n\nwho owned the club; James, who was a club employee who was present during\n\nboth raids; and Lewis, who was a club patron present only for the second raid.\n\nThey sued three individual defendants:         Freddie Morgan, the police chief;\n\nDendinger, a police officer; and James C. Morgan, the sheriff.\n\n                                         22\n\f            Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 23 of 44\n\n\n      This Court described the raids at issue in that case as follows:\n\n            [In the first raid,] [t]he Task Force officers pointed their\n            weapons at plaintiffs Spradley and James and others who\n            were present. Participants in the raid searched the\n            Club’s cash register and door receipts, and some currency\n            was confiscated from the door receipts. Persons inside\n            the Club were prohibited from moving or leaving until\n            the raid, which lasted one to one and one-half hours, was\n            over. Those present were not allowed to go to the\n            restroom.      When one man asked for permission,\n            [defendant] Officer Dendinger replied, “Shut up, or I’ll\n            shut you up myself.” When plaintiff James told\n            [defendant] Chief Morgan that she was so scared that she\n            had to go to the restroom, he said no. . . .\n\n            ...\n\n            During this second raid, law enforcement officials\n            chambered rounds of ammunition into their weapons,\n            pointed them, and ordered persons in the Club to get\n            down on the floor. Some of those present in the Club\n            during this raid were searched, including plaintiff Lewis.\n            During the process of being searched, Lewis was pushed\n            outside the Club, grabbed and shoved against a wall.\n            After being searched, Lewis was forced to go back inside\n            the Club until the raid was concluded. Another patron\n            was pushed off a bar stool. Some of the employees,\n            including plaintiff James, had guns held on them during\n            the raid, which lasted from one to one and one-half\n            hours. At one point, an officer, with his finger on the\n            trigger, pointed a shotgun at Lewis’ face. . . .\n\nId. (emphasis added). Other than these facts, Swint states no specific facts about\n\nthe roles of Officer Dendinger and Chief Morgan in the searches, except to note,\n\n“Chief Morgan and Officer Dendinger personally participated in both raids.” Id.\n\nat 994 (emphasis added). Thus, nothing in the facts set forth in Swint identifies\n                                         23\n\f              Case: 13-14092   Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 24 of 44\n\n\nwhat Dendinger did directly or particularly to any of the plaintiffs, other than that\n\nhe told someone who was not a plaintiff to “shut up,” thus showing only that\n\nDendinger personally participated in the raids. And, other than Chief Morgan’s\n\nrefusal to allow James to use the restroom, which also necessarily demonstrates\n\nChief Morgan’s personal participation in the raids, the opinion contains no\n\nindication that the plaintiffs identified anything specific that Chief Morgan did to\n\nthem.\n\n        As for the opinion’s description of the second raid—the only one for which\n\nplaintiff Lewis was even present—it does not even identify a particular action in\n\nwhich either Chief Morgan or Dendinger engaged at all. Moreover, because the\n\nopinion describes the raids as occurring with 30 to 40 officers, we cannot infer\n\nfrom the facts set forth that Dendinger or Chief Morgan personally conducted the\n\nactual search or pushing of Lewis about which Lewis complained.\n\n        Nonetheless, and despite specifically acknowledging Zatler’s rule that §\n\n1983 requires proof of an affirmative causal connection between the official’s acts\n\nor omissions and the alleged constitutional deprivation, this Court concluded in\n\nSwint that qualified immunity had to be denied to all three officers with respect to\n\nall four plaintiffs because, among other reasons, “[n]o reasonable officer in the\n\ndefendants’ position could have believed that these were lawful, warrantless\n\nadministrative searches.” Id. at 999.\n\n                                         24\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 25 of 44\n\n\n      Our dissenting colleague suggests that we are not bound by what Swint held\n\nwhen, because of the individual defendants’ core personal participation in a\n\nwarrantless search that was illegal from the outset, this Court denied qualified\n\nimmunity to each of the individual defendants against each of the individual\n\nplaintiffs. By making this argument, the dissent effectively concedes that Swint\n\ndid exactly what we are doing in this case. Only the dissent reasons that we are\n\nfree to ignore what Swint did for three reasons.\n\n      First, the dissent asserts that “Swint did not consider at all the argument\n\nraised by Deputy Leslie in this appeal—whether an officer can be liable for\n\nviolations of clearly established constitutional rights that he did not commit or that\n\nwere not pursuant to a policy that he approved.” Dissent at 5. But there is nothing\n\nnew in this case that the Court in Swint did not consider.\n\n      The dissent’s contention assumes that Deputy Leslie did not engage in\n\nviolations of clearly established constitutional rights. But Leslie is not being\n\ndenied qualified immunity for violations of clearly established constitutional rights\n\nthat he did not commit or that were not pursuant to a policy that he approved. On\n\nthe contrary, just like the defendant officers in Swint, Leslie is being held\n\nresponsible for his core personal participation in what was, according to our\n\nbinding precedent, clearly from the start, an unlawful, warrantless search that\n\naffected each and every one of the plaintiffs. Each of the plaintiff barbers had a\n\n                                         25\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 26 of 44\n\n\ncognizable Fourth Amendment interest in the property that was illegally searched\n\nand a cognizable Fourth Amendment right not to have been seized by the raiding\n\nunit, under the circumstances. Just as Dendinger and Chief Morgan’s “personal[]\n\nparticipat[ion]” in the illegal raids in Swint required the denial of qualified\n\nimmunity for each of the defendants with regard to each of the plaintiffs, despite\n\nthe absence of facts showing exactly what each officer did to each plaintiff whose\n\nrights were violated by the raids, Leslie’s core participation in the illegal search of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ property and the unlawful detention of the plaintiffs violated each of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ clearly established rights and requires the denial of qualified\n\nimmunity.\n\n      This reading of Swint’s requirements—that an officer’s core “personal[]\n\nparticipation” in a warrantless search that is unlawful from its inception violates\n\nthe clearly established rights of the people whose property was searched and who\n\nwere seized, where the participating officers had clear notice from our prior case\n\nlaw that participation in a search of that particular type violates the Fourth\n\nAmendment—is the only reading of Swint that does not require us to ignore\n\nsignificant portions of the opinion. It also describes precisely the fact pattern that\n\noccurred in this case.\n\n      Second, the dissent attempts to distance itself from Swint and suggests that\n\nSwint does not compel the conclusion that qualified immunity must be denied to\n\n                                          26\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014   Page: 27 of 44\n\n\nLeslie with respect to the claims of Trammon, Durant, and Anderson because in\n\nSwint, this Court did not consider whether the Swint plaintiffs had established that\n\neach of the defendant officers had engaged in specific, identified actions with\n\nregard to each of the particular plaintiffs. See Dissent at 7-8. We respectfully\n\ndisagree with the dissent.\n\n      In Swint, we expressly identified the requirement that a specific inquiry be\n\nmade into the relationship between each defendant’s actions and each plaintiff’s\n\nalleged injuries. In this regard, we quoted Zatler’s requirement of “proof of an\n\naffirmative causal connection between the official’s acts or omissions and the\n\nalleged constitutional deprivation . . . .” Swint, 498 F.3d at 999 (quoting Zatler,\n\n802 F.2d at 401) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). We further\n\nrecognized in Swint that “it is clear that the inquiry into causation must be a\n\ndirected one, focusing on the duties and responsibilities of each of the individual\n\ndefendants whose acts or omissions are alleged to have resulted in a constitutional\n\ndeprivation.” Swint, 51 F.3d at 999 (quoting Williams v. Bennett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409367\"><a href=\"/opinion/409367/bobby-williams-v-larry-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1381 (11th Cir. 1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). It\n\nwould be strange, indeed, for us to have acknowledged these requirements and\n\nthen not have actually considered them in our analysis. But to reach the dissent’s\n\nconclusion, that is precisely what we would have had to have done.\n\n\n\n\n                                        27\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 28 of 44\n\n\n      Moreover, besides talking the talk, we walked the walk with regard to all\n\nthree defendants. That is, we actually applied the Zatler causation requirements to\n\nall three defendants. The dissent seems to suggest that we considered only Sheriff\n\nMorgan’s argument that the plaintiffs did not allege facts showing that he\n\nspecifically violated their particular rights and that we did not consider that\n\nargument with respect to Dendinger or Chief Morgan. See Dissent at 7-8. But the\n\nopinion in Swint reflects that we specifically considered this very argument as it\n\npertained to all three Swint defendants: Sheriff Morgan, Dendinger, and Chief\n\nMorgan.\n\n      With regard to Sheriff Morgan, we first described the sheriff’s argument as\n\nfollows: “According to the Sheriff, ‘the focus must center on the actions taken by\n\n[him] and the information he possessed in taking those actions.’” Id. at 999\n\n(emphasis added). We then explained that Sheriff Morgan’s argument failed for\n\ntwo reasons. First, we said, “although § 1983 does require proof of an affirmative\n\ncausal connection between the official’s acts or omissions and the alleged\n\nconstitutional deprivation, ‘[p]ersonal participation . . . is only one of several ways\n\nto establish the requisite causal connection.’” id. (quoting Zatler, 802 F.2d at\n\n401) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).            Put simply, we\n\nannounced that we were considering whether Zatler’s causal-connection\n\nrequirement was met. We reasoned that liability could be imposed on Sheriff\n\n                                          28\n\f              Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 29 of 44\n\n\nMorgan because a causal connection between his actions and the plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional deprivations existed, although he was present for neither raid, based\n\non Sheriff Morgan’s approval of an improper policy regarding the raids.\n\n       Second, we concluded that Sheriff Morgan’s argument that the plaintiffs did\n\nnot adequately demonstrate that he was responsible for their constitutional\n\ndeprivations failed because “even if Sheriff Morgan had a reasonable basis for\n\nbelieving that his policies and training were adequate going into the first raid, that\n\nfails to explain why he authorized exactly the same conduct three months later in\n\nMarch of 1991, when he had reason to know better.” Id.\n\n       As for Dendinger and Chief Morgan, significantly, the very next sentence\n\nand paragraph in the opinion start with the word “similarly” and then go on to\n\napply the same logic just applied to Sheriff Morgan to Chief Morgan and\n\nDendinger, demonstrating that we also specifically considered whether Chief\n\nMorgan and Dendinger should be denied qualified immunity where the record\n\ncontained no allegations concerning their specific actions with respect to particular\n\nplaintiffs:\n\n              Similarly, even if Chief Morgan and Officer Dendinger\n              had not been fully aware of the Task Force’s plan of\n              attack before the first raid, as participants in the first raid\n              they had ample opportunity to determine before the\n              second raid was conducted whether the first had\n              comported with constitutional requirements.              Upon\n              learning of the manner in which the first raid was\n              conducted, reasonable law enforcement officials would\n                                            29\n\f             Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 30 of 44\n\n\n             have been on notice that clearly established Fourth\n             Amendment rights had been violated. Willingness to\n             engage in the second raid demonstrated deliberate\n             indifference to those rights, and it reflected accession to\n             and adoption of the policies and procedures employed.\n\nId. at 999-1000 (emphasis added). In other words, we denied qualified immunity\n\nas to Lewis’s claims against Chief Morgan and Officer Dendinger based on Chief\n\nMorgan and Officer Dendinger’s mere personal participation in the second raid\n\nwhen they should have known that participation in such a warrantless search\n\nclearly violated the Fourth Amendment. Thus, it is clear that we did, in fact,\n\nconsider in Swint whether the general allegations concerning Chief Morgan and\n\nDendinger’s core “personal[] participat[ion]” in the warrantless searches satisfied\n\nZatler’s requirement that a directed inquiry into the actions of the defendants with\n\nrespect to the plaintiffs had been satisfied, and we concluded that it had. As a\n\nresult, Swint put Vidler and Leslie on notice that engaging in the type of\n\nwarrantless search conducted in Swint clearly violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\nNor does the fact that the district court did not cite Swint in its opinion and the\n\nplaintiffs did not cite it in their appellate brief somehow make Swint any less\n\nbinding precedent.\n\n      Finally, implicitly conceding that the raid in the instant case violated clearly\n\nestablished Fourth Amendment law, the dissent argues in its last attempt to resist\n\nthe constraints of Swint that we\n\n                                         30\n\f               Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014        Page: 31 of 44\n\n\n               conflate[] two distinct questions: whether a search\n               violates clearly established law, and who can sue whom\n               on the basis of that violation. The majority relies on\n               Swint’s conclusion that the officers in Swint knew the\n               planned raid violated “clearly established Fourth\n               Amendment rights,”[7] to draw the unrelated conclusion\n               that mere participation in such a raid is enough to expose\n               any officer to liability to any plaintiff.”\n\nDissent at 8. The problem with this argument arises from the fact that it does not\n\nacknowledge what we actually wrote in Swint. In addition to holding that the\n\nofficers knew that the raids in Swint violated clearly established Fourth\n\nAmendment rights, we found Zatler’s requirement of a causal connection between\n\nthe defendants’ actions and the plaintiffs’ constitutional deprivation to have been\n\nsatisfied by the Swint defendants’ personal participation in unlawfully searching\n\nthe club, in violation of the plaintiff owners’ rights, and detaining the plaintiff\n\nemployee and plaintiff patron, in violation of their respective rights.\n\n       Indeed, we said as much when we concluded with respect to Dendinger and\n\nChief Morgan’s personal participation in the second raid, “Upon learning of the\n\nmanner in which the first raid was conducted, reasonable law enforcement officials\n\nwould have been on notice that clearly established Fourth Amendment rights had\n\n\n\n       7\n         Here, the dissent appears to acknowledge that Swint concluded that raids of the type\nconducted in that case and in this one violate clearly established Fourth Amendment rights,\ndespite the dissent’s suggestion to the contrary three sentences later. See Dissent at 8 (“That is,\nthe decision that the majority cites as clearly establishing what these individual officers should\nhave known was never even mentioned by either the learned district judge or the plaintiffs’ own\ncounsel.”).\n                                                31\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 32 of 44\n\n\nbeen violated. Willingness to engage in the second raid demonstrated deliberate\n\nindifference to those rights . . . .” Swint, 51 F.3d at 999. This passage is composed\n\nof two distinct thoughts: the first sentence recognizes that the raids violated clearly\n\nestablished Fourth Amendment rights, while the second sentence takes the next\n\nstep and, based on the Swint defendants’ “deliberate indifference to [the Swint\n\nplaintiffs’ clearly established Fourth Amendment] rights” by engaging in the raids\n\ndespite their knowledge that the raids violated clearly established Fourth\n\nAmendment rights, finds a causal connection between the actions of the Swint\n\ndefendants and the constitutional injuries of the Swint plaintiffs and attaches\n\nliability to the defendants against the Swint plaintiffs whose clearly established\n\nFourth Amendment rights they violated. Thus, neither the Court in Swint nor we\n\nconflate the clearly established requirement and the causal-connection requirement.\n\n      If the facts of this case differ in any material manner from those of Swint, it\n\nis only that they are even more compelling. Whereas the Swint facts say nothing\n\nmore with respect to the second raid than that Dendinger and Chief Morgan\n\n“personally participated” in it, here, the plaintiffs have alleged not only that both\n\nVidler and Leslie “personally participated” in the search of Strictly Skillz, but that\n\nVidler planned and supervised the raid, and Leslie participated in the search of the\n\nshop used by all of the plaintiffs to earn a living and then slapped handcuffs on\n\nBerry when he expressed displeasure with the treatment of the other plaintiffs.\n\n                                          32\n\f               Case: 13-14092        Date Filed: 09/16/2014        Page: 33 of 44\n\n\n       As in Swint, “[n]o reasonable officer in the defendants’ position could have\n\nbelieved that these were lawful, warrantless administrative searches.” See id. at\n\n999. Where, as alleged here, officers participate in a search that was clearly\n\nestablished to be illegal from its inception, they are simply not entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity any more than an officer who enters and searches a person’s home\n\nwithout a warrant or an applicable warrant exception. This is not a case where a\n\ngroup of officers entered a location to execute a validly obtained search warrant,\n\nand, without the approval of the other officers participating in the authorized\n\nsearch, one or two officers went off on an unconstitutional frolic of their own.\n\nHere, the entire search itself was unlawful from the beginning, and Vidler and\n\nLeslie, who fully participated in it, could reasonably be found to have violated the\n\nrights of all of the barbers searched and all of the barbers with a Fourth\n\nAmendment interest in Strictly Skillz’s space, regardless of what each officer did\n\none on one to each particular plaintiff barber.\n\n       Each officer’s discrete actions in what was clearly an unlawful search from\n\nthe outset are not the focus of our inquiry here. Rather, the conduct under scrutiny\n\nis the officers’ core participation in the warrantless search itself. 8 Vidler and\n\n\n\n       8\n         Several of our sister circuits have similarly held that personal participation in an\nunconstitutional search is sufficient to establish liability.

I also agree that Brian Berry presented\n\nevidence that Deputy Travis Leslie, who handcuffed Berry and patted him down,\n\nviolated his clearly established constitutional rights. But Edwyn Durant, Reginald\n\nTrammon, and Jermario Anderson presented no evidence that Deputy Travis Leslie\n\nviolated their constitutional rights. Even though the inspection of the barbershop\n\nappeared to be “a scene right out of a Hollywood movie” (Majority Op. at 1), we\n\ncannot bend the law to resolve this appeal with a feel-good ending from a box-\n\noffice hit. The law entitles Leslie to qualified immunity against any barber who\n\nfailed to present evidence that Leslie personally deprived him of a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional right. Durant, Trammon, and Anderson failed to prove an\n\naffirmative causal connection between their specific injuries and Leslie’s conduct.\n\nFor that reason, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n      I agree with the majority that, to establish “an ‘affirmative causal\n\nconnection’ between the official and the alleged deprivation,” the barbers “must\n\nshow that the official was personally involved in the acts that resulted in the\n\nconstitutional deprivation.” (Majority Op. at 20 (quoting Zatler v. Wainwright, 802\n\n                                          36\n\f             Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 37 of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401 (11th Cir. 1986)).) And counsel for the barbers acknowledged at oral\n\nargument that our precedents “require” us to compare “each officer’s actions” to\n\nthe injury suffered by “each individual plaintiff.” But, after reciting the correct\n\ngoverning law, the majority fails to consider whether each barber proved a causal\n\nconnection between his specific injury and Deputy Leslie’s conduct.\n\n      Durant, Trammon, and Anderson failed to present evidence that Leslie\n\npersonally violated their constitutional rights. Durant testified that a male deputy\n\nwearing a uniform searched his workstation and ordered him to sit down, but he\n\nfailed to identify that male deputy as Leslie. Although Leslie wore a uniform, more\n\nthan one uniformed, male deputy participated in the search. Trammon testified that\n\ntwo female deputies handcuffed and searched him. Trammon also testified that a\n\nfemale inspector and another officer searched his workstation, but he failed to\n\nidentify the other officer as Leslie. And counsel for the barbers conceded at oral\n\nargument that “there is no evidence that [Leslie] did anything personally to . . .\n\nTramm[on].” Finally, Anderson testified that a short, male deputy wearing a mask\n\nand bulletproof vest handcuffed him and searched his workstation. But Leslie was\n\nnot wearing a bulletproof vest and was not wearing a mask. And, despite having\n\nseen Leslie handcuff Berry, none of the barbers testified that the officer who\n\nsearched him was the same officer who handcuffed Berry.\n\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\f              Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 38 of 44\n\n\n      The majority asserts that “[t]he record clearly supports a finding that” Leslie\n\nwas an “active and full participant[] in the unconstitutional intrusion” because\n\nLeslie “placed [Brian Berry] in handcuffs and helped to execute the\n\nunconstitutional search of the shop and barbering stations,” (id. at 21), but “the\n\ninquiry into causation must be a directed one, focusing on the duties and\n\nresponsibilities of each of the individual defendants whose acts or omissions are\n\nalleged to have resulted in a constitutional deprivation,” Swint v.

To be sure, each barber suffered a\n\nviolation of his constitutional rights, and each barber has a valid claim against any\n\nofficer who participated in that barber’s injury.

Unlike Berry,\n\nDurant, Trammon, and Anderson failed to present any evidence that Deputy Leslie\n\nparticipated in any way in inflicting the constitutional injuries that they suffered.\n\n      The majority boasts that “it is difficult to imagine a straighter application of\n\nbinding precedent than Swint to the facts of this case,” but its reading of Swint is\n\nfar from “a straight[] application of binding precedent.” (Majority Op. at 22.) The\n\nmajority points out that “nothing in the facts set forth in Swint identifies what [the\n\nofficer] or [the police chief] did directly or particularly to any of the plaintiffs” and\n\nyet the Swint court ruled “that qualified immunity had to be denied to all three\n\nofficers with respect to all four plaintiffs because, among other reasons, ‘no\n\nreasonable officer in the defendants’ position could have believed that these were\n\nlawful, warrantless administrative searches.’” (Majority Op. at 24–25 (quoting\n\nSwint, 51 F.3d at 999).) The majority construes this lack of discussion as a binding\n\ncommand not to engage in a particularized analysis of each plaintiff’s injury and\n\neach defendant’s conduct. According to that reading, the four plaintiffs in Swint,\n\nplus every other employee and patron, would have a valid claim against not only\n\nthe police chief, sheriff, and officer, but also all “30 to 40 officers” who\n\nparticipated in the raid. (Majority Op. at 24.) But Swint holds nothing of the kind.\n\n                                           39\n\f             Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 40 of 44\n\n\nAt the very least, the police chief in Swint was a supervisor who, like Vidler, could\n\nbe liable for the violations of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights even without\n\npersonally participating in the violations, so the court would have no reason to\n\nanalyze his conduct as related to each plaintiff’s injury. And we can only speculate\n\nwhy the court did not discuss the officer’s role in each plaintiff’s injury—perhaps\n\nthe officer failed to raise the defense. Our decision in Swint did not consider at all\n\nthe argument raised by Deputy Leslie in this appeal—whether an officer can be\n\nliable for violations of clearly established constitutional rights that he did not\n\ncommit or that were not pursuant to a policy that he approved.\n\n      Let’s be clear about what the majority reads Swint to require. Under the\n\nmajority’s reading, every officer at the scene of an invalid search is liable for every\n\nviolation of every plaintiff’s rights. Even those officers who do not so much as\n\nlook in the direction of a plaintiff, or so much as breathe on a plaintiff’s property,\n\nor have any supervisory responsibility over the offending officers, will\n\nnevertheless be liable to every plaintiff due to the officers’ “mere personal\n\nparticipation” when they “should have known that participation in such a . . .\n\nsearch clearly violated the Fourth Amendment.” (Majority Op. at 30.) And so the\n\nmajority holds Deputy Leslie is subject to liability, despite no record evidence that\n\nLeslie touched Durant, Trammon, or Anderson, no record evidence that Leslie\n\ntouched any property belonging to Durant, Trammon, or Anderson, and no record\n\n                                           40\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 41 of 44\n\n\nevidence that Leslie supervised any of the officers who searched or seized property\n\nof Durant, Trammon, and Anderson.\n\n      Let’s be just as clear that this is not what Swint requires. Swint proceeded, in\n\nrelevant part, by addressing only three arguments raised by the officers in that\n\nappeal. First, the “[d]efendants argued” that “the search . . . was pursuant to\n\nprobable cause and exigent circumstances.” 51 F.3d at 996 (alteration and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). As to probable cause, the officers argued that both\n\ngeneral information about the club and the “drug transactions that preceded each of\n\nthe raids” provided probable cause for the search. Id. at 997. After recounting the\n\npolice chief’s and sheriff’s testimony, we ruled that the general information about\n\nthe club did not amount to arguable probable cause and that “[p]robable cause to\n\narrest one suspect . . . did not give the officers carte blanche to seize everyone who\n\nhappened to be in the Club when the two raids took place.” Id. And we explained\n\nthat “[w]e need not address defendants’ exigent circumstances argument,” because\n\nwe had already concluded that the officers lacked probable cause and “it is well-\n\nsettled that . . . warrantless searches and seizures require that both probable cause\n\nand exigent circumstances exist.” Id. at 998 (alteration and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Second, the “[d]efendants argue[d]” that “the two raids were\n\nadministrative searches of the Club to which the Club owners had previously\n\nconsented.” Id. We ruled that the facts “simply [did] not support an administrative\n\n                                          41\n\f              Case: 13-14092    Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 42 of 44\n\n\nsearch theory” because the raids involved a “massive show of force and excessive\n\nintrusion,” and “the officers did not simply search for violations of the liquor\n\nlaws.” Id. at 998–99. Third, “Sheriff Morgan advance[d] another argument on the\n\nquestion of . . . whether he engaged in conduct violative of the rights established\n\nby clearly-established law.” Id. at 999 (emphasis added) (alteration and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). As to this argument raised only by the sheriff, we\n\nexplained that, “although § 1983 does require proof of an affirmative causal\n\nconnection between the official’s acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional\n\ndeprivation, personal participation is only one of several ways to establish the\n\nrequisite causal connection.” Id. (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWe explained that we also may impose liability “due to the existence of an\n\nimproper policy.” Id. (internal quotation mark omitted). We then considered the\n\ninformation known to the sheriff and ruled that he had authorized an improper\n\npolicy. Id.\n\n      To be sure, Swint clearly established that the information known to the\n\nofficers about the club does not amount to arguable probable cause for a raid; that a\n\nsingle drug transaction does not amount to arguable probable cause to search an\n\nentire establishment; that massive shows of force amount to unreasonable\n\nadministrative inspections; and that owners and patrons can establish an\n\naffirmative causal connection between the violations of their constitutional rights\n\n                                          42\n\f              Case: 13-14092      Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 43 of 44\n\n\nand a supervisor, like the sheriff, if the supervisor approved a policy that allowed\n\nthe violations. But Swint said nothing at all about—much less clearly established—\n\nwhether every person present during an unreasonable search has a valid claim\n\nagainst every officer who participated in that search.\n\n       I part ways with the majority because it conflates two distinct questions:\n\nwhether a search violates clearly established law, and who can sue whom on the\n\nbasis of that violation. The majority relies on Swint’s conclusion that the officers in\n\nSwint knew the planned raid violated “clearly established Fourth Amendment\n\nrights,” to draw the unrelated conclusion that mere participation in such a raid is\n\nenough to expose any officer to liability to any plaintiff. (Majority Op. at 30\n\n(quoting Swint, 51 F.3d at 999–1000).) But the central issue in Swint was whether\n\nthe officers would have been on notice that the raid violated clearly established\n\nFourth Amendment rights. The answer to that question does not establish whose\n\nFourth Amendment rights they violated. Perhaps for that reason, neither the district\n\ncourt in its order nor the barbers in their brief even cite to Swint at all. That is, the\n\ndecision that the majority cites as clearly establishing what these individual\n\nofficers should have known was never even mentioned by either the learned\n\ndistrict judge or the plaintiffs’ own counsel.\n\n       Because Durant, Trammon, and Anderson failed to prove a causal link\n\nbetween Deputy Leslie’s conduct and their constitutional deprivations, I\n\n                                            43\n\f             Case: 13-14092     Date Filed: 09/16/2014    Page: 44 of 44\n\n\nrespectfully concur in part and dissent in part. I would reverse the denial of\n\nsummary judgment for the claims brought by Anderson, Durant, and Trammon\n\nagainst Leslie and render partial summary judgment in his favor.\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\f</pre>",
