          "plain_text": "PRESENT:   All the Justices\n\nSAMIR ALLEN FARHOUMAND\n                                            OPINION BY\nv.   Record No. 140012                JUSTICE DONALD W. LEMONS\n                                          October 31, 2014\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n             FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA\n\n      In this appeal, we consider whether the term \"expose,\" as\n\nused in Code § 18.2-370, includes tactile contact or is\n\nlimited to situations where \"sexual or genital parts\" are\n\n\"exposed\" to sight.   We also consider whether the evidence is\n\nsufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Samir Allen\n\nFarhoumand (\"Farhoumand\") exposed his genitalia in violation\n\nof Code § 18.2-370(A)(1).\n\n                         I. Proceedings Below\n\n      In January 2012, S.F., a minor child, told his family he\n\nhad been sexually abused over the course of several years by\n\nhis older cousin, Samir Farhoumand.    On May 21, 2012,\n\nFarhoumand was indicted in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County\n\n(\"trial court\") on four counts of \"expos[ing] his sexual or\n\ngenital parts\" to a child under fifteen years of age in\n\nviolation of Code § 18.2-370(A)(1).    The indictments covered a\n\nperiod of two years, divided into four consecutive time\n\fperiods, with a single act of exposure charged in each\n\nindictment. 1\n\n     A trial commenced on August 27, 2012, before the\n\nHonorable Randy I. Bellows, Circuit Judge for Fairfax County,\n\nwithout a jury.   At the close of the Commonwealth's evidence,\n\nthe defense moved to strike all four indictments.    The trial\n\ncourt dismissed the first indictment, but found there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support the remaining three\n\nindictments, and denied the motion to strike as to those\n\ncounts.\n\n     After presenting its evidence, the defense moved to\n\nstrike the remaining three indictments.   The trial court\n\ndenied the second motion to strike, and found Farhoumand\n\nguilty of the remaining three counts of \"expos[ing] his . . .\n\nsexual or genital parts\" to a minor child in violation of Code\n\n§ 18.2-370(A)(1).   The trial court relied, in part, upon the\n\nunpublished decision of the Court of Appeals of Virginia in\n\nMason v. Commonwealth, Record No. 0309-97-2, slip op. at 4\n\n(November 10, 1998)(en banc), which held: \"[e]xposure means\n\nnot only to 'lay open to view' but also to 'lay open to feel\n\nor to touch.'\"\n\n     1\n       Indictment 1 –\"on or between\" Sept. 3, 2009 and Dec.\n31, 2009; Indictment 2 – \"on or between\" Jan. 1, 2010 and\nSept. 3, 2010; Indictment 3 – \"on or between\" Sept. 4, 2010\nand Dec. 31, 2010; Indictment 4 – \"on or between\" Jan. 1, 2011\nand Sept. 3, 2011.\n\n                               2\n\f     On November 15, 2012, Farhoumand argued two motions to\n\nset aside the verdict, claiming that the trial court had\n\napplied an improper definition of the term \"expose,\" and that\n\nthe evidence failed to establish with requisite specificity\n\nwhether any particular act of exposure occurred within the\n\ntime frames of the individual indictments.   The trial court\n\ndenied both motions.   The trial court sentenced Farhoumand to\n\nconcurrent terms of 10 years imprisonment with 6 years\n\nsuspended on each of the three counts, with active probation\n\nfor ten years from the date of the defendant's release from\n\nprison.\n\n     Farhoumand appealed his convictions to the Court of\n\nAppeals, which affirmed the trial court's judgment.    In an\n\nunpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals held that there is\n\n          no compelling reason to conclude that the\n          display of nudity must be limited to a\n          visual display. Indeed, if exposure is\n          defined as \"make known\" or \"lay bare,\"\n          such a definition encompasses a tactile\n          exposure as well as visual.\n\n                          . . . .\n\n               We find the reasoning in Mason\n          persuasive, in that \"expose\" means not\n          only to lay bare to view, but to feel or\n          touch. . . . We conclude that because\n          appellant \"made known\" his bare penis to\n          the victim's touch, he physically and\n          tactilely exposed his penis to the victim.\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fFarhoumand v. Commonwealth, Record No. 2087-12-4, 2013 Va.\n\nApp. LEXIS 353, at *6-7 (Dec. 3, 2013).\n\n     Farhoumand appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals\n\nto this Court, and we awarded an appeal on the following\n\nassignments of error:\n\n   1. The Court of Appeals erred   in holding that\n      \"exposure\" is proven where   genitalia is felt but\n      not seen and in failing to   dismiss the indictments\n      where the evidence did not   prove that his\n      genitalia was \"exposed\" to   sight.\n\n   2. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the\n      evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant's\n      convictions whether \"exposure\" is proven where\n      genitalia is seen or felt.\n\n         II.   Meaning of \"Expose\" in Code § 18.2-370\n\n     Whether the term \"expose,\" as used in Code § 18.2-370, is\n\nlimited to visual exposure, or includes tactile exposure, is a\n\nquestion of statutory interpretation reviewed de novo.       David\n\nv. David, 287 Va. 231, 237, 754 S.E.2d 285, 289 (2014).\n\n     Code § 18.2-370(A)(1) provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n          Any person 18 years of age or over, who,\n          with lascivious intent, knowingly and\n          intentionally . . . [e]xpose[s] his or her\n          sexual or genital parts to any child\n          [under the age of 15 years] to whom such\n          person is not legally married or\n          propose[s] that any such child expose his\n          or her sexual or genital parts to such\n          person [is guilty of a Class 5 felony.]\n\n  A. Plain Meaning\n\n\n                               4\n\f     We construe statutes to \"ascertain and give effect to the\n\nintention\" of the General Assembly.    Rutter v. Oakwood Living\n\nCtrs. of Va., Inc., 282 Va. 4, 9, 710 S.E.2d 460, 462 (2011)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).   Because the General\n\nAssembly's intent \"is usually self-evident from the statutory\n\nlanguage,\" we apply the plain meaning of the words used in the\n\nstatute.    Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);\n\nsee also Boynton v. Kilgore, 271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922,\n\n925-26 (2006).\n\n     Webster's Third New International Dictionary 802 (1993)\n\ndefines expose as \"to lay open to view\" or \"lay bare.\"    It\n\nalso offers the definitions to \"make known\" or \"set forth,\"\n\nwith the qualifying example: \"[E]ach had started exposing his\n\nviews.\"    The Webster's New College Dictionary 252 (3d ed.\n\n2008), defines \"expose\" as \"to lay bare or uncover.\"   Merriam-\n\nWebster's Collegiate Dictionary 441 (11th ed. 2003), defines\n\n\"expose\" as \"caus[ing] to be visible or open to view.\"      In\n\nThe American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 625\n\n(5th ed. 2011), \"expose\" is defined simply as \"to make\n\nvisible.\"   Each of these definitions supports our conclusion\n\nthat, in the context of Code § 18.2-370, \"expose\"\n\nunambiguously means revealing one's genitalia to sight.\n\n  B. Legislative History\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f     The legislative history of Code § 18.2-370 further\n\nsupports our conclusion that the General Assembly intended\n\nexposure to be limited to instances of visual display.\n\nSubsection 2 of Code § 18.2-370(A) previously criminalized\n\nfondling.   It read:\n\n            Any person eighteen years of age or over,\n            who, with lascivious intent, shall\n            knowingly and intentionally . . . . [i]n\n            any manner fondle or feel, or attempt to\n            fondle or feel, the sexual or genital part\n            of any child, or the breast of any such\n            female child . . . . shall be guilty of a\n            Class 6 felony.\n\nFormer Code § 18.2-370(A)(Cum. Supp. 1980).   However, in 1981,\n\nthe General Assembly repealed Subsection 2 and re-codified its\n\nprovisions in two closely related statutes: Code §§ 18.2-67.3\n\nand 18.2-67.4.   1981 Acts ch. 397.\n\n     Subsection (A)(4)(a) of Code § 18.2-67.3, Virginia's\n\naggravated sexual battery statute, prohibits \"sexually\n\nabus[ing] the complaining witness [if] . . . [t]he act is\n\naccomplished against the will of the complaining witness by\n\nforce, threat or intimidation, and [t]he complaining witness\n\nis at least 13 but less than 15 years of age.\"   Code § 18.2-\n\n67.4(A) provides: \"An accused is guilty of sexual battery if\n\nhe sexually abuses, as defined in § 18.2-67.10, (i) the\n\ncomplaining witness against the will of the complaining\n\nwitness, by force, threat, intimidation, or ruse . . . .\"    In\n\n\n\n                                6\n\fturn, Code § 18.2-67.10 defines \"sexual abuse,\" in pertinent\n\npart, as:\n\n             an act committed with the intent to\n             sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any\n             person, where:\n                  a. The accused intentionally touches\n             the complaining witness's intimate parts\n             or material directly covering such\n             intimate parts; [or]\n                  b. The accused forces the complaining\n             witness to touch the accused's, the\n             witness's own, or another person's\n             intimate parts or material directly\n             covering such intimate parts.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Additionally, in 2007, the General Assembly\n\nenacted Code § 18.2-67.4:2, which provides that an accused is\n\nguilty of sexual abuse of a child under 15 if he \"with\n\nlascivious intent, commits an act of sexual abuse, as defined\n\nin § 18.2-67.10, with any child 13 years of age or older but\n\nunder 15 years of age.\"    2007 Acts ch. 463.\n\n     Because the General Assembly specifically removed\n\nSubsection 2 from Code § 18.2-370(A) and re-codified it as\n\nCode §§ 18.2-67.3, 18.2-67.4 and 18.2-67.10, and as recently\n\nas 2007 enacted Code § 18.2-67.4:2, we conclude that the\n\nGeneral Assembly did not intend for Code § 18.2-370(A) to\n\ncontinue to criminalize fondling, or situations where the\n\naccused forces the complaining witness to touch the accused's\n\ngenitalia.    The interpretation given by the Court of Appeals\n\nrenders at least one of these statutes superfluous and ignores\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fthe General Assembly's specific act of segregating the crime\n\nof fondling/molestation from the crime of taking indecent\n\nliberties with minors.   Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred\n\nby holding that Code § 18.2-370(A) proscribes the same conduct\n\nas Code §§ 18.2-67.3, 18.2-67.4, 18.2-67.4:2 and 18.2-67.10.\n\n  C. Precedent\n\n     In Noblett v. Commonwealth, 194 Va. 241, 247, 72 S.E.2d\n\n241, 244 (1952), we held that, under the common law, indecent\n\nexposure required proof that the defendant's private parts\n\nwere \"likely to have been seen by persons using the street.\"\n\nSimilarly, in Wicks v. City of Charlottesville, 215 Va. 274,\n\n276, 208 S.E.2d 752, 755 (1974), we construed a\n\nCharlottesville City Code provision making it illegal to\n\nindecently \"expose\" oneself as proscribing \"an intentional and\n\nindecent exposure in a public place where it is likely to be\n\nseen, whether actually seen by one or several persons.\"\n\nHowever, we have never specifically addressed whether the\n\nmeaning of the word \"expose,\" within the context of Code §\n\n18.2-370(A)(1), requires the possibility of a visual sighting.\n\n     The Court of Appeals has discussed the meaning of\n\n\"expose\" in several recent published cases.   In Siquina v.\n\nCommonwealth, 28 Va. App. 694, 697-99, 508 S.E.2d 350, 352-53\n\n(1998), the Court of Appeals held that \"[Code § 18.2-370]\n\nproscribes the intentional display by an adult, with\n\n\n                               8\n\flascivious intent, of his or her genitals in the presence of a\n\nchild where a reasonable probability exists that they might be\n\nseen by that child, regardless of the child's actual\n\nperception of such a display.\"        In affirming the defendant's\n\nconviction in that case, the Court of Appeals concluded that\n\nthe victim had a reasonable probability of seeing the\n\ndefendant's genitalia when the two were in a bathroom together\n\nand the defendant's \"pants and underwear were pulled down to\n\nhis feet.\"      Id.\n\n     In Moses v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 357, 611 S.E.2d 607\n\n(2005), the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, addressed the\n\ndifference between \"display\" and \"expose\" as used in Code §\n\n18.2-387. 2    It held that:\n\n                   Unless the word \"display\" is\n              superfluous, it must mean something\n              different from \"exposure.\" If \"exposure\"\n              can only mean some degree of nudity, then\n              \"display\" necessarily means something\n              different. And so it does. Among the\n              definitions of \"display\" in ordinary\n              speech (particularly where, as here, it is\n              used as a noun rather than a verb) is the\n              \"demonstration or manifestation of\n              something.\" It is just that definition we\n\n\n2\n  Code § 18.2-387, Virginia's indecent exposure statute,\nprovides: \"Every person who intentionally makes an obscene\ndisplay or exposure of his person, or the private parts\nthereof, in any public place, or in any place where others are\npresent, or procures another to so expose himself, shall be\nguilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. No person shall be deemed to\nbe in violation of this section for breastfeeding a child in\nany public place or any place where others are present.\"\n\n                                  9\n\f            give to the word \"display\" when used in\n            other provisions of the Code.\n\n                            . . . .\n\n                 Properly understood, every visible\n            exposure of one's genitals necessarily\n            involves a display of one's genitals. But\n            that does not prove the reverse: that\n            every display necessarily includes an\n            exposure. Hence, a robber can still\n            display a handgun in his pocket while not\n            exposing it to sight. So too a man\n            masturbating in public can still display\n            his \"person\" or \"private parts\" while not\n            exposing his penis to sight. We thus\n            reject Moses's claim that the display-or-\n            exposure formulation in Code § 18.2-387\n            codifies a mere semantic redundancy, a\n            pairing of interchangeable synonyms.\n\nMoses, 45 Va. App. at 363-64, 611 S.E.2d at 610 (citation\n\nomitted).    In affirming Moses' conviction under Code § 18.2-\n\n387, the Court of Appeals determined that he had \"displayed\"\n\nhis genitalia by \"exercising his penis\" underneath \"his\n\npants.\"     Id. at 359, 611 S.E.2d at 608.\n\n     The Court of Appeals diverged from its reasoning in\n\nSiquina and Moses in several unpublished decisions – including\n\nits opinion in this case.    In Mason, Record No. 0309-97-2,\n\nslip op. at 4 (Nov. 10, 1998), the Court of Appeals held that:\n\n\"[e]xposure means not only to 'lay open to view' but also to\n\n'lay open to feel or to touch.'\"      The Court of Appeals cited\n\nno authority for this proposition, noting only that the\n\n\"[c]ommon usage of the word 'expose'\" encompasses more than\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fvisual exposure, such as when \"a person is exposed to a toxin\n\neven though the person may have no visual perception of the\n\nsubstance.\"   Id.\n\n     In this case, the Court of Appeals found:\n\n          the reasoning in Mason persuasive, in that\n          \"expose\" means not only to lay bare to\n          view, but to feel or touch. This\n          conclusion is consistent with the\n          dictionary definition of \"expose.\"\n          Further, to limit exposure to visual\n          observation unduly limits the behavior\n          that the statute intends to prevent.\n          Children should not be subjected in any\n          sensory capacity to the sexual or genital\n          parts of an adult who harbors lascivious\n          intent.\n\nFarhoumand, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 353, at *7.   These conclusions\n\nconflict with the published decisions of the Court of Appeals\n\nin Siquina, 28 Va. App. at 697-99, 508 S.E.2d at 352-53, and\n\nMoses, 45 Va. App. at 363-64, 611 S.E.2d at 610, which state,\n\nrespectively, that proof of \"exposure\" requires \"a reasonable\n\nprobability . . . that [the defendant's genitals] might be\n\nseen by that child\" and that \"'exposure' can only mean some\n\ndegree of nudity.\"\n\n     The panel of the Court of Appeals erred in this case by\n\napplying Mason, an unpublished decision, in place of its\n\nearlier published opinions.   We hold that the word \"expose,\"\n\nas it is used in Code § 18.2-370, requires a visual display\n\nwhere the genitalia are seen, or where there is a possibility\n\n\n\n                               11\n\fthat they could be seen.   Accordingly, exposure does not\n\ninclude situations where the genitalia are felt but are\n\notherwise covered or obscured from view.\n\n               III.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     Having found that the Court of Appeals erred in applying\n\na tactile definition of exposure to the facts of this case, we\n\nmust now review the all of the relevant evidence supporting\n\nFarhoumand's conviction under each indictment.   Then, applying\n\nthe correct definition, we must determine whether the evidence\n\noffered under each indictment was sufficient to prove that\n\nFarhoumand \"expose[d]\" his \"genital or sexual parts\" in\n\nviolation of Code § 18.2-370(A)(1).\n\n  A. Relevant Facts\n\n     At trial, S.F. testified that all of the abuse occurred\n\nwhile Farhoumand was staying with S.F.'s family during\n\nFarhoumand's school breaks.   The abuse allegedly began shortly\n\nbefore Farhoumand graduated from the University of Virginia\n\nand continued while he was attending dental school at the\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles.   While S.F. testified\n\nthat the first incident of sexual abuse occurred during the\n\nwinter of 2009, during his seventh grade year, the time\n\nperiods covered by the indictments only encompassed S.F.'s\n\neighth and ninth grade years.\n\n\n\n\n                                12\n\f         S.F. testified that the first incident of abuse\n\noccurred in the middle of the night.    S.F. stated that he\n\n\"woke up\" and saw Farhoumand \"fondling [him].\"     He testified\n\nthat the second incident of abuse occurred days later and\n\ninvolved the \"same thing.\"\n\nIndictment No. 2: Jan. 1, 2010 - Sept. 3, 2010 3\n\n     Indictment No. 2 covered the spring of S.F.'s eighth\n\ngrade year and the following summer.    S.F. testified that in\n\n\"the beginning, and throughout eighth grade\" there were\n\nincidents where \"[Farhoumand] would take [S.F.'s] hand, put it\n\non [Farhoumand's] penis\" and \"masturbate himself\" with it.\n\nWhen Farhoumand placed S.F.'s hand on Farhoumand's penis, S.F.\n\nwould \"sometimes . . . [be] turn[ed] to his side . . . [a]way\n\nfrom [Farhoumand].\"    During these acts, S.F. stated that\n\nFarhoumand's underwear \"was not fully down, sometimes it\n\nwasn't at all.   Very rarely was it fully down.\"   However, S.F.\n\ntestified that \"occasionally [Farhoumand's penis] was exposed,\n\nbut most of the time it was inside [his underwear].\"    S.F.\n\ndescribed these acts with clarity, but could not remember\n\nprecisely when they occurred:\n\n     3\n       Indictment 1, which covered September 3, 2009 through\nDecember 31, 2009, the fall and early winter of S.F.’s eighth\ngrade year, was dismissed at trial. The evidence under this\nindictment was almost entirely duplicative of the evidence\noffered under Indictment No. 2; therefore, we will move\ndirectly to reciting the facts offered at trial that support\nIndictment No. 2.\n\n                                13\n\f          Q    When you say, \"over time,\" do you know how\n     long afterwards that occurred?\n\n          A    Unh-huh.\n\n          Q    Do you remember what grade you were in\n     when that occurred?\n\n          A    No.\n\n          Q    Did you ever see your cousin's penis?\n\n          A    Yes, I did.\n\n          Q    And how often did that happen?\n\n          A    I'm not certain – rarely.\n\nWhen asked again to specify when the defendant first began\n\nplacing S.F.'s hand on the defendant's penis, S.F. testified:\n\n          THE WITNESS: It – I can be for sure that it\n     happened, like, before ninth grade began, was the\n     first incident. So all throughout ninth grade, but\n     the first incident basically must have been, I can\n     pretty much assure the Court, that it was before\n     ninth grade.\n\n          THE COURT: You're saying the first incident\n     occurred before ninth grade?\n\n          THE WITNESS: Yes.\n\n          THE COURT: And then after that – you mean,\n     where he took your hand and put it on his penis?\n\n          THE WITNESS: Yes.\n\n     During the defense's case-in-chief, Farhoumand testified\n\non his own behalf and was cross-examined by the Commonwealth.\n\nHe explained that he that graduated from the University of\n\nVirginia in December of 2009 and lived \"the majority of the\n\n\n\n                              14\n\ftime\" at S.F.'s house from January 1, 2010 to March 30, 2010.\n\nFarhoumand took several trips that spring and summer but the\n\nevidence shows that he was back in Virginia: May 2, 2010 to\n\nMay 21, 2010; May 24, 2010 to June 2, 2010; June 8, 2010 to\n\nJuly 26, 2010; August 2, 2010 to August 22, 2010; and August\n\n25, 2010 to September 4, 2010.\n\n     During these periods, Farhoumand admitted to being a\n\nfrequent house guest at S.F.'s home, sometimes sleeping in the\n\nsame bed with S.F., and that between March 2010 and August\n\n2010 Farhoumand \"may have touched [S.F.] [o]n eight\n\noccasions.\"   On cross examination, he acknowledged admitting\n                                             4\nto \"fondling\" S.F., \"four to eight times.\"       However,\n\nFarhoumand denied ever forcing S.F. to touch his penis, and he\n\nalso disavowed ever visually exposing his genitalia to S.F.\n\nIndictment No. 3: Sept. 4, 2010 – Dec. 31, 2010\n\n     Indictment No. 3 covers the fall and early winter of\n\nS.F.'s ninth grade year.   As described above, S.F. testified\n\nthat the incidents when S.F. was made to touch Farhoumand's\n\npenis continued to occur \"[d]uring the course of ninth grade.\"\n\nHowever, S.F. said that the abuse that happened \"during ninth\n\ngrade\" was \"probably the most traumatic.\"    S.F. stated:\n\n\n     4\n       Two Los Angeles police officers, Kenneth Gutierrez and\nTony Im, testified during the Commonwealth’s case-in-chief\nthat Farhoumand had confessed to them that he had touched his\ncousin’s penis \"four times.\"\n\n                                 15\n\f\"[Farhoumand] would essentially turn me over to face him, and\n\nessentially place his penis touching mine, and masturbate it\n\nor put my hand on it and masturbate it.\"      S.F. provided the\n\nfollowing details about these incidents:\n\n             Q    And how were your cousin's clothes?\n\n             A    They were pulled down, or again through the\n        fly. I didn't really look, so I wasn't sure.\n\n             Q    And did you ever see his penis during those –\n\n             A    Once, because I didn't – I wasn't sure what was\n        happening, but once I figured it out, I wouldn't look.\n\n             Q    And were you able to feel his penis?\n\n             A    Yeah.   That was strange.\n\nS.F. also testified that he could see Farhoumand's face during\n\nthe abuse that involved penis-to-penis contact.\n\n        During the time frame covered by Indictment No. 3,\n\nFarhoumand's testimony supports that he was in Virginia\n\nSeptember 4 to September 11 and December 11 to December 31,\n\n2010.    While Farhoumand testified that S.F. went out of the\n\ncountry from December 22 through the remainder of the\n\nindictment period, at least 17 days remain where he was in\n\nVirginia and had access to the victim.\n\nIndictment No. 4: Jan. 1, 2011 - Sept. 3, 2011\n\n        Indictment No. 4 covers the late winter and early spring\n\nof S.F.'s ninth grade year and the following summer.\n\nFarhoumand testified that he was only in Virginia from June 12\n\n\n                                  16\n\fto June 24 and September 1 through September 3, 2011 during\n\nthis time period.\n\n      As mentioned under Indictment No. 3, S.F. testified that\n\nhe saw Farhoumand's penis \"once\" during the ninth grade.    He\n\nalso testified, as described above, that he was made to touch\n\nFarhoumand's penis \"during the course of ninth grade\" and that\n\nFarhoumand had placed his uncovered penis against S.F.'s penis\n\n\"in ninth grade.\"\n\n     S.F. claimed that the last incident of abuse occurred on\n\nSeptember 2, 2013, \"right before tenth grade began, a day\n\nbefore [S.F.'s fifteenth] birthday.\"   S.F. testified that on\n\nthis occasion he also had a friend sleeping over in his room.\n\nS.F. slept on the floor and S.F.'s friend slept on the bed.\n\nS.F. stated that Farhoumand came next to him on the floor and\n\n\"proceeded to fondle\" him.   S.F. explained that this incident\n\nwas \"actually less severe than other times.\"\n\n     On cross-examination, when asked whether Farhoumand had\n\nplaced S.F.'s hand on Farhoumand's penis during that\n\nencounter, S.F. replied, \"to be quite honest, it's difficult\n\nto remember but if I had to say . . . today for the court\n\nofficially, I would say yes.\"   There was no evidence offered\n\nas to whether Farhoumand's penis was ever uncovered during\n\nthis incident.\n\n  B. Analysis\n\n\n                                17\n\f     We review the sufficiency of the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the Commonwealth, and only reverse the\n\njudgment of the circuit court when its decision is plainly\n\nwrong or without evidence to support it.    Maldonado-Mejia v.\n\nCommonwealth, 287 Va. 49, 54, 752 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2014).\n\n     Farhoumand argues that each of his convictions must be\n\nreversed because \"[t]he Commonwealth . . . failed to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's penis was\n\nexposed to sight during any one of the time periods covered by\n\nthe three indictments.\"    The Commonwealth responds that an\n\nindictment is not invalid if omits or misstates the time at\n\nwhich an offense occurs when time is not an element of an\n\noffense.    The Commonwealth further argues that there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support the convictions under each\n\nindictment.\n\n     Code § 19.2-226 provides that \"no indictment or other\n\naccusation shall be quashed or deemed invalid . . . [f]or\n\nomitting to state, or stating imperfectly, the time at which\n\nthe offense was committed when time is not the essence of the\n\noffense.\"    In Harris v. Commonwealth, 185 Va. 26, 37 S.E.2d\n\n868 (1946), we reaffirmed the longstanding principle that,\n\n\"[i]n a felony case the Commonwealth may prove the commission\n\nof a crime charged on a date different from that alleged in\n\n\n\n\n                                18\n\fthe indictment.\"   Id. at 33, 37 S.E.2d at 871 (citing Puckett\n\nv. Commonwealth, 134 Va. 574, 585, 113 S.E. 853, 856 (1922)).\n\n     Several federal circuits agree, holding that \"[t]ime is\n\nnot a material element of a criminal offense unless made so by\n\nthe statute creating the offense.\" United States v. Stuckey,\n\n220 F.3d 976, 982 (8th Cir. 2000)(citing Ledbetter v. United\n\nStates, 170 U.S. 606, 612 (1898)(stating that it is not\n\n\"necessary to prove that the offence was committed on the day\n\nalleged, unless a particular day be made material by the\n\nstatute creating the offence\").     See also Real v. Shannon, 600\n\nF.3d 302, 308 (3rd Cir. 2010); United States v. Creamer, 721\n\nF.2d 342, 343 (11th Cir. 1983)(\"reject[ing] the contention\n\nthat time becomes a material element of a criminal offense\n\nmerely because the defense of alibi is advanced.\"); United\n\nStates v. King, 703 F.2d 119, 123-24 (5th Cir. 1983).\n\n     While an indictment is not invalid if it omits or\n\nmisstates the time at which an offense occurs when time is not\n\nan element of the offense, each indictment must meet due\n\nprocess requirements:\n\n     These criteria are, first, whether the indictment\n     \"contains the elements of the offense intended to be\n     charged, 'and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what\n     he must be prepared to meet,'\" and, secondly, \"'in case\n     any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar\n     offence, whether the record shows with accuracy to what\n     extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\fRussell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 763-64\n\n(1962)(collecting cases).\n\n     In Clinebell v. Commonwealth, 235 Va. 319, 321, 368\n\nS.E.2d 263, 264 (1988), the defendant was convicted of five\n\ncounts of sexual assault against his daughter. On appeal, he\n\nargued that the indictments were fatally defective because\n\nthey failed to specify the precise dates of the offenses for\n\nwhich he was convicted.     Id.   We concluded that the\n\nindictments were legally sufficient and adopted the holding\n\nand rationale of the Court of Appeals. 5    Id.   In that\n\nreferenced opinion, the Court of Appeals observed:\n\n     In most criminal cases, there is no doubt that a crime\n     occurred; the only issue is who committed the crime. An\n     alibi-based defense is offered in such cases to prove\n     that it was impossible for the defendant to have\n     committed the offense because he was not at the scene of\n     the crime during its commission.\n          The question in most parent-child sexual abuse\n     cases, however, is not who committed the crime, but\n     whether a crime was ever committed.\n\nClinebell v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 362, 367, 349 S.E.2d\n\n676, 679 (1986).\n\n     The evidence shows that Farhoumand was a frequent house\n\nguest in S.F.'s family home during the time periods alleged in\n\n     5\n       In Clinebell, we did not review the rationale\nsupporting our holding, but rather directly adopted the\nrationale of the Court of Appeals in that case: \"We conclude\nthat the indictments are legally sufficient, and on this\nissue, we affirm the holding and rationale of the Court of\nAppeals. See Clinebell, 3 Va. App. at 364-67, 349 S.E.2d at\n677-79.\" 235 Va. at 321, 368 S.E.2d at 264.\n\n                                  20\n\fthe indictments.    By his own admission, Farhoumand was alone\n\nwith, and fondled, S.F. on at least four to eight separate\n\noccasions.   The question here, like the question presented in\n\nClinebell, is not who committed the crime, but whether the\n\ncrime charged in each of the indictments was committed.\n\nIndictment No. 2: Jan. 1, 2010 - Sept. 3, 2010\n\n     S.F. testified that the first time Farhoumand placed\n\nS.F.'s hand on Farhoumand's penis and \"masturbated himself\"\n\nwith it was \"before ninth grade began.\"     S.F. stated that when\n\nFarhoumand placed S.F.'s hand on Farhoumand's penis, that the\n\ndefendant's underwear \"was not fully down, sometimes it wasn't\n\nat all.   Very rarely was it fully down.\"   However, S.F.\n\ntestified that Farhoumand's penis was \"occasionally\" exposed.\n\nFarhoumand acknowledged that during the time frame covered by\n\nIndictment No. 2, he lived \"the majority of the time\" at\n\nS.F.'s house, except for a few trips that he took during the\n\nsummer of 2010.    He also admitted that he had at least eight\n\nopportunities to molest S.F., and that he fondled S.F. four to\n\neight times between March and August of 2010.    Viewing this\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we\n\ncannot conclude that the trial court's judgment convicting\n\nFarhoumand on this count is plainly wrong or without evidence\n\nto support it; therefore we will affirm the conviction as to\n\nIndictment No. 2.\n\n\n                                21\n\fIndictment No. 3: Sept. 4, 2010 – Dec. 31, 2010\n\n     S.F.'s testimony that he saw Farhoumand's penis \"once\"\n\nduring ninth grade and that Farhoumand touched his uncovered\n\npenis to S.F.'s penis \"during ninth grade,\" combined with\n\nFarhoumand's access to S.F. for at least 17 days during the\n\nindictment period and evidence of contact with S.F. during\n\nthat time, support the trial court's judgment convicting the\n\ndefendant.   Therefore, under Indictment No. 3, we find that\n\nthe evidence was sufficient to prove that Farhoumand visually\n\nexposed his penis in violation of Code § 18.2-370(A)(1).\n\nIndictment No. 4: Jan. 1, 2011 - Sept. 3, 2011 6\n\n     S.F. testified that he saw Farhoumand's penis \"once\"\n\nduring the ninth grade.   He also testified, as described\n\nabove, that he was made to touch Farhoumand's penis \"during\n\nthe course of ninth grade\" and that Farhoumand had placed his\n\nuncovered penis against S.F.'s penis \"in ninth grade.\"\n\nHowever, this is the same evidence used to support the\n\n\n\n\n6\n  September 3, 2011, S.F's fifteenth birthday, was included\nwithin the time frame alleged in Indictment No. 4. There was\nconflicting evidence at trial as to whether the final act of\nabuse occurred on September 2, 2011, which would have made any\nconduct constituting an act of exposure a felony, or September\n3, which would have made the same conduct a misdemeanor.\nHowever, we need not address this issue, because we find that\nthe evidence offered with respect to the final incident of\nabuse was insufficient to support the allegation that the\ndefendant visually exposed his \"sexual or genital parts.\"\n\n                               22\n\fconviction under Indictment No. 3 and cannot be used to\n\nsupport a second conviction under Indictment No. 4.\n\n     The only other specific evidence of abuse offered under\n\nIndictment No. 4 was the final incident on September 2, 2013.\n\nNo evidence was offered as to whether Farhoumand's penis was\n\never uncovered during this incident.     Therefore, we conclude\n\nthat the evidence in the record was insufficient to sustain a\n\nconviction under Indictment No. 4.\n\n                           IV.   Conclusion\n\n     Accordingly, we will reverse and vacate Farhoumand's\n\nconviction under Indictment No. 4 (FE-2012-707) because the\n\nevidence was insufficient to prove that a distinguishable act\n\nof visual exposure occurred during the time period stated in\n\nthe indictment. 7   To the extent that the trial court relied on\n\na tactile definition of exposure in convicting Farhoumand\n\nunder Indictment No. 2 and Indictment No. 3, we hold that such\n\nreliance was error.    Nevertheless, after reviewing the\n\nevidence, we will affirm Farhoumand's convictions under\n\nIndictment No. 2 (FE-2012-705) and Indictment No. 3 (FE-2012-\n\n706) because there was sufficient evidence to prove that the\n\ndefendant visually \"expose[d]\" his penis to S.F., a minor\n\n\n7\n  Because Farhoumand received a sentence of 10 years with 6\nyears suspended on each charge, and those sentences were\nordered to be served concurrently, we do not need to remand\nthe case for resentencing.\n\n                                 23\n\fchild, in violation of Code § 18.2-370(A)(1), during the time\n\nframes alleged.\n\n     We reject the conclusion set forth by the Court of\n\nAppeals that \"expose\" under Code § 18.2-370(A)(1) includes\n\ntactile exposure.   The plain meaning of the statute, the\n\nlegislative history, our decisions interpreting \"exposure,\"\n\nand the published decisions of the Court of Appeals all\n\nsupport our conclusion that exposure is limited to a visual\n\ndisplay where the child saw, or could have seen, the uncovered\n\ngenitalia.\n\n                                         Affirmed in part,\n                                         reversed in part,\n                                         and final judgment.\n\n\nJUSTICE McCLANAHAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n     The General Assembly placed no limitation on the nature\n\nof the knowing and intentional \"expos[ure]\" of one's sexual or\n\ngenital parts to a child, with lascivious intent, in\n\ncriminalizing such act under Code § 18.2-370.   Thus, the legal\n\nquestion before this Court as posed by the majority opinion -\n\n\"[w]hether the term 'expose,' as used in Code § 18.2-370, is\n\nlimited to visual exposure, or includes tactile exposure\" - is\n\nanswered in the asking.   Because tactile exposure is indeed a\n\nform of exposure, it is proscribed under the statute.\n\n\n\n\n                               24\n\f     \"Expose\" is defined as to \"lay open to view[,] lay\n\nbare[,] make known[,] exhibit.\"     Webster's Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 802 (1993).     Based on this\n\ndefinition, I find no compelling reason to conclude that the\n\nproscribed conduct must be limited to a visual exposure.\n\nIndeed, because exposure is defined as \"make known\" or \"lay\n\nbare,\" such a definition encompasses a tactile exposure as\n\nwell as visual.\n\n     I concur in the result reached by the majority opinion on\n\nIndictment Numbers 2 and 3 because I conclude there was\n\nsufficient evidence to convict Farhoumand as to these two\n\nindecent liberties charges based on proof of visual, as well\n\nas, tactile exposure.   But, I would also affirm Farhoumand's\n\nconviction on Indictment Number 4 as I conclude, like the\n\nCourt of Appeals, that there was also sufficient evidence of\n\ntactile exposure on this charge.\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\f",

Record No. 140012                JUSTICE DONALD W. LEMONS\n                                          October 31, 2014\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n             FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA\n\n      In this appeal, we consider whether the term \"expose,\" as\n\nused in Code § 18.2-370, includes tactile contact or is\n\nlimited to situations where \"sexual or genital parts\" are\n\n\"exposed\" to sight.   We also consider whether the evidence is\n\nsufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Samir Allen\n\nFarhoumand (\"Farhoumand\") exposed his genitalia in violation\n\nof Code § 18.2-370(A)(1).\n\n                         I. Proceedings Below\n\n      In January 2012, S.F., a minor child, told his family he\n\nhad been sexually abused over the course of several years by\n\nhis older cousin, Samir Farhoumand.    On May 21, 2012,\n\nFarhoumand was indicted in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County\n\n(\"trial court\") on four counts of \"expos[ing] his sexual or\n\ngenital parts\" to a child under fifteen years of age in\n\nviolation of Code § 18.2-370(A)(1).    The indictments covered a\n\nperiod of two years, divided into four consecutive time\n\fperiods, with a single act of exposure charged in each\n\nindictment. 1\n\n     A trial commenced on August 27, 2012, before the\n\nHonorable Randy I. Bellows, Circuit Judge for Fairfax County,\n\nwithout a jury.   At the close of the Commonwealth's evidence,\n\nthe defense moved to strike all four indictments.    The trial\n\ncourt dismissed the first indictment, but found there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support the remaining three\n\nindictments, and denied the motion to strike as to those\n\ncounts.\n\n     After presenting its evidence, the defense moved to\n\nstrike the remaining three indictments.   The trial court\n\ndenied the second motion to strike, and found Farhoumand\n\nguilty of the remaining three counts of \"expos[ing] his . . .\n\nsexual or genital parts\" to a minor child in violation of Code\n\n§ 18.2-370(A)(1).   The trial court relied, in part, upon the\n\nunpublished decision of the Court of Appeals of Virginia in\n\nMason v. Commonwealth, Record No. 0309-97-2, slip op. at 4\n\n(November 10, 1998)(en banc), which held: \"[e]xposure means\n\nnot only to 'lay open to view' but also to 'lay open to feel\n\nor to touch.'\"\n\n     1\n       Indictment 1 –\"on or between\" Sept. 3, 2009 and Dec.\n31, 2009; Indictment 2 – \"on or between\" Jan. 1, 2010 and\nSept. 3, 2010; Indictment 3 – \"on or between\" Sept. 4, 2010\nand Dec. 31, 2010; Indictment 4 – \"on or between\" Jan. 1, 2011\nand Sept. 3, 2011.\n\n                               2\n\f     On November 15, 2012, Farhoumand argued two motions to\n\nset aside the verdict, claiming that the trial court had\n\napplied an improper definition of the term \"expose,\" and that\n\nthe evidence failed to establish with requisite specificity\n\nwhether any particular act of exposure occurred within the\n\ntime frames of the individual indictments.   The trial court\n\ndenied both motions.   The trial court sentenced Farhoumand to\n\nconcurrent terms of 10 years imprisonment with 6 years\n\nsuspended on each of the three counts, with active probation\n\nfor ten years from the date of the defendant's release from\n\nprison.\n\n     Farhoumand appealed his convictions to the Court of\n\nAppeals, which affirmed the trial court's judgment.    In an\n\nunpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals held that there is\n\n          no compelling reason to conclude that the\n          display of nudity must be limited to a\n          visual display. Indeed, if exposure is\n          defined as \"make known\" or \"lay bare,\"\n          such a definition encompasses a tactile\n          exposure as well as visual.\n\n                          . . . .\n\n               We find the reasoning in Mason\n          persuasive, in that \"expose\" means not\n          only to lay bare to view, but to feel or\n          touch. . . . We conclude that because\n          appellant \"made known\" his bare penis to\n          the victim's touch, he physically and\n          tactilely exposed his penis to the victim.\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fFarhoumand v. Commonwealth, Record No. 2087-12-4, 2013 Va.\n\nApp. LEXIS 353, at *6-7 (Dec. 3, 2013).\n\n     Farhoumand appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals\n\nto this Court, and we awarded an appeal on the following\n\nassignments of error:\n\n   1. The Court of Appeals erred   in holding that\n      \"exposure\" is proven where   genitalia is felt but\n      not seen and in failing to   dismiss the indictments\n      where the evidence did not   prove that his\n      genitalia was \"exposed\" to   sight.\n\n   2. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the\n      evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant's\n      convictions whether \"exposure\" is proven where\n      genitalia is seen or felt.\n\n         II.   Meaning of \"Expose\" in Code § 18.2-370\n\n     Whether the term \"expose,\" as used in Code § 18.2-370, is\n\nlimited to visual exposure, or includes tactile exposure, is a\n\nquestion of statutory interpretation reviewed de novo.

Legislative History\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f     The legislative history of Code § 18.2-370 further\n\nsupports our conclusion that the General Assembly intended\n\nexposure to be limited to instances of visual display.\n\nSubsection 2 of Code § 18.2-370(A) previously criminalized\n\nfondling.   It read:\n\n            Any person eighteen years of age or over,\n            who, with lascivious intent, shall\n            knowingly and intentionally . . . .

Supp. 1980).   However, in 1981,\n\nthe General Assembly repealed Subsection 2 and re-codified its\n\nprovisions in two closely related statutes: Code §§ 18.2-67.3\n\nand 18.2-67.4.   1981 Acts ch. 397.\n\n     Subsection (A)(4)(a) of Code § 18.2-67.3, Virginia's\n\naggravated sexual battery statute, prohibits \"sexually\n\nabus[ing] the complaining witness [if] . . . [t]he act is\n\naccomplished against the will of the complaining witness by\n\nforce, threat or intimidation, and [t]he complaining witness\n\nis at least 13 but less than 15 years of age.\"   Code § 18.2-\n\n67.4(A) provides: \"An accused is guilty of sexual battery if\n\nhe sexually abuses, as defined in § 18.2-67.10, (i) the\n\ncomplaining witness against the will of the complaining\n\nwitness, by force, threat, intimidation, or ruse . . . .\"    In\n\n\n\n                                6\n\fturn, Code § 18.2-67.10 defines \"sexual abuse,\" in pertinent\n\npart, as:\n\n             an act committed with the intent to\n             sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any\n             person, where:\n                  a. The accused intentionally touches\n             the complaining witness's intimate parts\n             or material directly covering such\n             intimate parts; [or]\n                  b. The accused forces the complaining\n             witness to touch the accused's, the\n             witness's own, or another person's\n             intimate parts or material directly\n             covering such intimate parts.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Additionally, in 2007, the General Assembly\n\nenacted Code § 18.2-67.4:2, which provides that an accused is\n\nguilty of sexual abuse of a child under 15 if he \"with\n\nlascivious intent, commits an act of sexual abuse, as defined\n\nin § 18.2-67.10, with any child 13 years of age or older but\n\nunder 15 years of age.\"    2007 Acts ch. 463.\n\n     Because the General Assembly specifically removed\n\nSubsection 2 from Code § 18.2-370(A) and re-codified it as\n\nCode §§ 18.2-67.3, 18.2-67.4 and 18.2-67.10, and as recently\n\nas 2007 enacted Code § 18.2-67.4:2, we conclude that the\n\nGeneral Assembly did not intend for Code § 18.2-370(A) to\n\ncontinue to criminalize fondling, or situations where the\n\naccused forces the complaining witness to touch the accused's\n\ngenitalia.    The interpretation given by the Court of Appeals\n\nrenders at least one of these statutes superfluous and ignores\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fthe General Assembly's specific act of segregating the crime\n\nof fondling/molestation from the crime of taking indecent\n\nliberties with minors.   Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred\n\nby holding that Code § 18.2-370(A) proscribes the same conduct\n\nas Code §§ 18.2-67.3, 18.2-67.4, 18.2-67.4:2 and 18.2-67.10.\n\n  C.

And so it does. Among the\n              definitions of \"display\" in ordinary\n              speech (particularly where, as here, it is\n              used as a noun rather than a verb) is the\n              \"demonstration or manifestation of\n              something.\" It is just that definition we\n\n\n2\n  Code § 18.2-387, Virginia's indecent exposure statute,\nprovides: \"Every person who intentionally makes an obscene\ndisplay or exposure of his person, or the private parts\nthereof, in any public place, or in any place where others are\npresent, or procures another to so expose himself, shall be\nguilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. No person shall be deemed to\nbe in violation of this section for breastfeeding a child in\nany public place or any place where others are present.\"\n\n                                  9\n\f            give to the word \"display\" when used in\n            other provisions of the Code.\n\n                            . . . .\n\n                 Properly understood, every visible\n            exposure of one's genitals necessarily\n            involves a display of one's genitals. But\n            that does not prove the reverse: that\n            every display necessarily includes an\n            exposure. Hence, a robber can still\n            display a handgun in his pocket while not\n            exposing it to sight. So too a man\n            masturbating in public can still display\n            his \"person\" or \"private parts\" while not\n            exposing his penis to sight. We thus\n            reject Moses's claim that the display-or-\n            exposure formulation in Code § 18.2-387\n            codifies a mere semantic redundancy, a\n            pairing of interchangeable synonyms.\n\nMoses, 45 Va. App. at 363-64, 611 S.E.2d at 610 (citation\n\nomitted).    In affirming Moses' conviction under Code § 18.2-\n\n387, the Court of Appeals determined that he had \"displayed\"\n\nhis genitalia by \"exercising his penis\" underneath \"his\n\npants.\"     Id. at 359, 611 S.E.2d at 608.\n\n     The Court of Appeals diverged from its reasoning in\n\nSiquina and Moses in several unpublished decisions – including\n\nits opinion in this case.    In Mason, Record No. 0309-97-2,\n\nslip op. at 4 (Nov. 10, 1998), the Court of Appeals held that:\n\n\"[e]xposure means not only to 'lay open to view' but also to\n\n'lay open to feel or to touch.'\"      The Court of Appeals cited\n\nno authority for this proposition, noting only that the\n\n\"[c]ommon usage of the word 'expose'\" encompasses more than\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fvisual exposure, such as when \"a person is exposed to a toxin\n\neven though the person may have no visual perception of the\n\nsubstance.\"   Id.\n\n     In this case, the Court of Appeals found:\n\n          the reasoning in Mason persuasive, in that\n          \"expose\" means not only to lay bare to\n          view, but to feel or touch. This\n          conclusion is consistent with the\n          dictionary definition of \"expose.\"\n          Further, to limit exposure to visual\n          observation unduly limits the behavior\n          that the statute intends to prevent.\n          Children should not be subjected in any\n          sensory capacity to the sexual or genital\n          parts of an adult who harbors lascivious\n          intent.\n\nFarhoumand, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 353, at *7.   These conclusions\n\nconflict with the published decisions of the Court of Appeals\n\nin Siquina, 28 Va. App. at 697-99, 508 S.E.2d at 352-53, and\n\nMoses, 45 Va. App. at 363-64, 611 S.E.2d at 610, which state,\n\nrespectively, that proof of \"exposure\" requires \"a reasonable\n\nprobability . . . that [the defendant's genitals] might be\n\nseen by that child\" and that \"'exposure' can only mean some\n\ndegree of nudity.\"\n\n     The panel of the Court of Appeals erred in this case by\n\napplying Mason, an unpublished decision, in place of its\n\nearlier published opinions.   We hold that the word \"expose,\"\n\nas it is used in Code § 18.2-370, requires a visual display\n\nwhere the genitalia are seen, or where there is a possibility\n\n\n\n                               11\n\fthat they could be seen.   Accordingly, exposure does not\n\ninclude situations where the genitalia are felt but are\n\notherwise covered or obscured from view.\n\n               III.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     Having found that the Court of Appeals erred in applying\n\na tactile definition of exposure to the facts of this case, we\n\nmust now review the all of the relevant evidence supporting\n\nFarhoumand's conviction under each indictment.   Then, applying\n\nthe correct definition, we must determine whether the evidence\n\noffered under each indictment was sufficient to prove that\n\nFarhoumand \"expose[d]\" his \"genital or sexual parts\" in\n\nviolation of Code § 18.2-370(A)(1).\n\n  A. Relevant Facts\n\n     At trial, S.F. testified that all of the abuse occurred\n\nwhile Farhoumand was staying with S.F.'s family during\n\nFarhoumand's school breaks.   The abuse allegedly began shortly\n\nbefore Farhoumand graduated from the University of Virginia\n\nand continued while he was attending dental school at the\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles.   While S.F. testified\n\nthat the first incident of sexual abuse occurred during the\n\nwinter of 2009, during his seventh grade year, the time\n\nperiods covered by the indictments only encompassed S.F.'s\n\neighth and ninth grade years.\n\n\n\n\n                                12\n\f         S.F. testified that the first incident of abuse\n\noccurred in the middle of the night.    S.F. stated that he\n\n\"woke up\" and saw Farhoumand \"fondling [him].\"     He testified\n\nthat the second incident of abuse occurred days later and\n\ninvolved the \"same thing.\"\n\nIndictment No. 2: Jan. 1, 2010 - Sept. 3, 2010 3\n\n     Indictment No. 2 covered the spring of S.F.'s eighth\n\ngrade year and the following summer.    S.F. testified that in\n\n\"the beginning, and throughout eighth grade\" there were\n\nincidents where \"[Farhoumand] would take [S.F.'s] hand, put it\n\non [Farhoumand's] penis\" and \"masturbate himself\" with it.\n\nWhen Farhoumand placed S.F.'s hand on Farhoumand's penis, S.F.\n\nwould \"sometimes . . .

So all throughout ninth grade, but\n     the first incident basically must have been, I can\n     pretty much assure the Court, that it was before\n     ninth grade.\n\n          THE COURT: You're saying the first incident\n     occurred before ninth grade?\n\n          THE WITNESS: Yes.\n\n          THE COURT: And then after that – you mean,\n     where he took your hand and put it on his penis?\n\n          THE WITNESS: Yes.\n\n     During the defense's case-in-chief, Farhoumand testified\n\non his own behalf and was cross-examined by the Commonwealth.\n\nHe explained that he that graduated from the University of\n\nVirginia in December of 2009 and lived \"the majority of the\n\n\n\n                              14\n\ftime\" at S.F.'s house from January 1, 2010 to March 30, 2010.\n\nFarhoumand took several trips that spring and summer but the\n\nevidence shows that he was back in Virginia: May 2, 2010 to\n\nMay 21, 2010; May 24, 2010 to June 2, 2010; June 8, 2010 to\n\nJuly 26, 2010; August 2, 2010 to August 22, 2010; and August\n\n25, 2010 to September 4, 2010.\n\n     During these periods, Farhoumand admitted to being a\n\nfrequent house guest at S.F.'s home, sometimes sleeping in the\n\nsame bed with S.F., and that between March 2010 and August\n\n2010 Farhoumand \"may have touched [S.F.] [o]n eight\n\noccasions.\"   On cross examination, he acknowledged admitting\n                                             4\nto \"fondling\" S.F., \"four to eight times.\"       However,\n\nFarhoumand denied ever forcing S.F. to touch his penis, and he\n\nalso disavowed ever visually exposing his genitalia to S.F.\n\nIndictment No. 3: Sept. 4, 2010 – Dec. 31, 2010\n\n     Indictment No. 3 covers the fall and early winter of\n\nS.F.'s ninth grade year.   As described above, S.F. testified\n\nthat the incidents when S.F. was made to touch Farhoumand's\n\npenis continued to occur \"[d]uring the course of ninth grade.\"\n\nHowever, S.F. said that the abuse that happened \"during ninth\n\ngrade\" was \"probably the most traumatic.\"    S.F. stated:\n\n\n     4\n       Two Los Angeles police officers, Kenneth Gutierrez and\nTony Im, testified during the Commonwealth’s case-in-chief\nthat Farhoumand had confessed to them that he had touched his\ncousin’s penis \"four times.\"\n\n                                 15\n\f\"[Farhoumand] would essentially turn me over to face him, and\n\nessentially place his penis touching mine, and masturbate it\n\nor put my hand on it and masturbate it.\"      S.F. provided the\n\nfollowing details about these incidents:\n\n             Q    And how were your cousin's clothes?\n\n             A    They were pulled down, or again through the\n        fly. I didn't really look, so I wasn't sure.\n\n             Q    And did you ever see his penis during those –\n\n             A    Once, because I didn't – I wasn't sure what was\n        happening, but once I figured it out, I wouldn't look.\n\n             Q    And were you able to feel his penis?\n\n             A    Yeah.   That was strange.\n\nS.F. also testified that he could see Farhoumand's face during\n\nthe abuse that involved penis-to-penis contact.\n\n        During the time frame covered by Indictment No. 3,\n\nFarhoumand's testimony supports that he was in Virginia\n\nSeptember 4 to September 11 and December 11 to December 31,\n\n2010.    While Farhoumand testified that S.F. went out of the\n\ncountry from December 22 through the remainder of the\n\nindictment period, at least 17 days remain where he was in\n\nVirginia and had access to the victim.\n\nIndictment No. 4: Jan. 1, 2011 - Sept. 3, 2011\n\n        Indictment No. 4 covers the late winter and early spring\n\nof S.F.'s ninth grade year and the following summer.\n\nFarhoumand testified that he was only in Virginia from June 12\n\n\n                                  16\n\fto June 24 and September 1 through September 3, 2011 during\n\nthis time period.\n\n      As mentioned under Indictment No. 3, S.F. testified that\n\nhe saw Farhoumand's penis \"once\" during the ninth grade.    He\n\nalso testified, as described above, that he was made to touch\n\nFarhoumand's penis \"during the course of ninth grade\" and that\n\nFarhoumand had placed his uncovered penis against S.F.'s penis\n\n\"in ninth grade.\"\n\n     S.F. claimed that the last incident of abuse occurred on\n\nSeptember 2, 2013, \"right before tenth grade began, a day\n\nbefore [S.F.'s fifteenth] birthday.\"   S.F. testified that on\n\nthis occasion he also had a friend sleeping over in his room.\n\nS.F. slept on the floor and S.F.'s friend slept on the bed.\n\nS.F. stated that Farhoumand came next to him on the floor and\n\n\"proceeded to fondle\" him.   S.F. explained that this incident\n\nwas \"actually less severe than other times.\"\n\n     On cross-examination, when asked whether Farhoumand had\n\nplaced S.F.'s hand on Farhoumand's penis during that\n\nencounter, S.F. replied, \"to be quite honest, it's difficult\n\nto remember but if I had to say . . . today for the court\n\nofficially, I would say yes.\"   There was no evidence offered\n\nas to whether Farhoumand's penis was ever uncovered during\n\nthis incident.\n\n  B.

See Clinebell, 3 Va. App. at 364-67, 349 S.E.2d at\n677-79.\" 235 Va. at 321, 368 S.E.2d at 264.\n\n                                  20\n\fthe indictments.    By his own admission, Farhoumand was alone\n\nwith, and fondled, S.F. on at least four to eight separate\n\noccasions.   The question here, like the question presented in\n\nClinebell, is not who committed the crime, but whether the\n\ncrime charged in each of the indictments was committed.\n\nIndictment No. 2: Jan. 1, 2010 - Sept. 3, 2010\n\n     S.F. testified that the first time Farhoumand placed\n\nS.F.'s hand on Farhoumand's penis and \"masturbated himself\"\n\nwith it was \"before ninth grade began.\"     S.F. stated that when\n\nFarhoumand placed S.F.'s hand on Farhoumand's penis, that the\n\ndefendant's underwear \"was not fully down, sometimes it wasn't\n\nat all.   Very rarely was it fully down.\"   However, S.F.\n\ntestified that Farhoumand's penis was \"occasionally\" exposed.\n\nFarhoumand acknowledged that during the time frame covered by\n\nIndictment No. 2, he lived \"the majority of the time\" at\n\nS.F.'s house, except for a few trips that he took during the\n\nsummer of 2010.    He also admitted that he had at least eight\n\nopportunities to molest S.F., and that he fondled S.F. four to\n\neight times between March and August of 2010.    Viewing this\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we\n\ncannot conclude that the trial court's judgment convicting\n\nFarhoumand on this count is plainly wrong or without evidence\n\nto support it; therefore we will affirm the conviction as to\n\nIndictment No. 2.\n\n\n                                21\n\fIndictment No. 3: Sept. 4, 2010 – Dec. 31, 2010\n\n     S.F.'s testimony that he saw Farhoumand's penis \"once\"\n\nduring ninth grade and that Farhoumand touched his uncovered\n\npenis to S.F.'s penis \"during ninth grade,\" combined with\n\nFarhoumand's access to S.F. for at least 17 days during the\n\nindictment period and evidence of contact with S.F. during\n\nthat time, support the trial court's judgment convicting the\n\ndefendant.   Therefore, under Indictment No. 3, we find that\n\nthe evidence was sufficient to prove that Farhoumand visually\n\nexposed his penis in violation of Code § 18.2-370(A)(1).\n\nIndictment No. 4: Jan. 1, 2011 - Sept. 3, 2011 6\n\n     S.F. testified that he saw Farhoumand's penis \"once\"\n\nduring the ninth grade.   He also testified, as described\n\nabove, that he was made to touch Farhoumand's penis \"during\n\nthe course of ninth grade\" and that Farhoumand had placed his\n\nuncovered penis against S.F.'s penis \"in ninth grade.\"\n\nHowever, this is the same evidence used to support the\n\n\n\n\n6\n  September 3, 2011, S.F's fifteenth birthday, was included\nwithin the time frame alleged in Indictment No. 4. There was\nconflicting evidence at trial as to whether the final act of\nabuse occurred on September 2, 2011, which would have made any\nconduct constituting an act of exposure a felony, or September\n3, which would have made the same conduct a misdemeanor.\nHowever, we need not address this issue, because we find that\nthe evidence offered with respect to the final incident of\nabuse was insufficient to support the allegation that the\ndefendant visually exposed his \"sexual or genital parts.\"\n\n                               22\n\fconviction under Indictment No. 3 and cannot be used to\n\nsupport a second conviction under Indictment No. 4.\n\n     The only other specific evidence of abuse offered under\n\nIndictment No. 4 was the final incident on September 2, 2013.\n\nNo evidence was offered as to whether Farhoumand's penis was\n\never uncovered during this incident.     Therefore, we conclude\n\nthat the evidence in the record was insufficient to sustain a\n\nconviction under Indictment No. 4.\n\n                           IV.   Conclusion\n\n     Accordingly, we will reverse and vacate Farhoumand's\n\nconviction under Indictment No. 4 (FE-2012-707) because the\n\nevidence was insufficient to prove that a distinguishable act\n\nof visual exposure occurred during the time period stated in\n\nthe indictment. 7   To the extent that the trial court relied on\n\na tactile definition of exposure in convicting Farhoumand\n\nunder Indictment No. 2 and Indictment No. 3, we hold that such\n\nreliance was error.    Nevertheless, after reviewing the\n\nevidence, we will affirm Farhoumand's convictions under\n\nIndictment No. 2 (FE-2012-705) and Indictment No. 3 (FE-2012-\n\n706) because there was sufficient evidence to prove that the\n\ndefendant visually \"expose[d]\" his penis to S.F., a minor\n\n\n7\n  Because Farhoumand received a sentence of 10 years with 6\nyears suspended on each charge, and those sentences were\nordered to be served concurrently, we do not need to remand\nthe case for resentencing.\n\n                                 23\n\fchild, in violation of Code § 18.2-370(A)(1), during the time\n\nframes alleged.\n\n     We reject the conclusion set forth by the Court of\n\nAppeals that \"expose\" under Code § 18.2-370(A)(1) includes\n\ntactile exposure.   The plain meaning of the statute, the\n\nlegislative history, our decisions interpreting \"exposure,\"\n\nand the published decisions of the Court of Appeals all\n\nsupport our conclusion that exposure is limited to a visual\n\ndisplay where the child saw, or could have seen, the uncovered\n\ngenitalia.\n\n                                         Affirmed in part,\n                                         reversed in part,\n                                         and final judgment.\n\n\nJUSTICE McCLANAHAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n     The General Assembly placed no limitation on the nature\n\nof the knowing and intentional \"expos[ure]\" of one's sexual or\n\ngenital parts to a child, with lascivious intent, in\n\ncriminalizing such act under Code § 18.2-370.   Thus, the legal\n\nquestion before this Court as posed by the majority opinion -\n\n\"[w]hether the term 'expose,' as used in Code § 18.2-370, is\n\nlimited to visual exposure, or includes tactile exposure\" - is\n\nanswered in the asking.   Because tactile exposure is indeed a\n\nform of exposure, it is proscribed under the statute.\n\n\n\n\n                               24\n\f     \"Expose\" is defined as to \"lay open to view[,] lay\n\nbare[,] make known[,] exhibit.\"     Webster's Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 802 (1993).     Based on this\n\ndefinition, I find no compelling reason to conclude that the\n\nproscribed conduct must be limited to a visual exposure.\n\nIndeed, because exposure is defined as \"make known\" or \"lay\n\nbare,\" such a definition encompasses a tactile exposure as\n\nwell as visual.\n\n     I concur in the result reached by the majority opinion on\n\nIndictment Numbers 2 and 3 because I conclude there was\n\nsufficient evidence to convict Farhoumand as to these two\n\nindecent liberties charges based on proof of visual, as well\n\nas, tactile exposure.   But, I would also affirm Farhoumand's\n\nconviction on Indictment Number 4 as I conclude, like the\n\nCourt of Appeals, that there was also sufficient evidence of\n\ntactile exposure on this charge.\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\f</pre>",
