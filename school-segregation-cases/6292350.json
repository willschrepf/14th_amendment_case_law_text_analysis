Currently pending before the Court are ten motions in limine to exclude the\n\nopinions and testimony of seven experts proffered by the United States and three experts\n\nproffered by defendants Toyobo Co. Ltd. and Toyobo America, Inc. (collectively, “Toyobo”).\n\nAt the request of the parties, the Court held a Daubert hearing with respect to one of Toyobo’s\n\nproffered experts, Dr. Kazuyki Yabuki, on January 23, 2018. The parties agreed to rest on their\n\npapers with respect to the remaining motions. See Joint Report re: Daubert Hearings [Dkt. No.\n\n503]. The Court has carefully reviewed the expert reports and supplemental reports of each\n\nexpert; the testimony of Dr. Yabuki at the Daubert hearing and the arguments presented by\n\ncounsel with respect to Dr. Yabuki; and the motions in limine filed by the parties and the\n\noppositions and replies thereto with respect to why the proponent believes the testimony should\n\fbe admitted and why the opponent believes it should be excluded. The Court’s rulings with\n\nrespect to these ten proffered experts follow. 1\n\n\n                                      I.

In Kumho, the Court made clear that the gatekeeper function applies to\n\nall expert testimony, not just scientifically-based testimony.\n\n               Rule 702 provides that if the Court finds that “scientific, technical, or other\n\nspecialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact\n\nin issue,” and if the Court finds that the witness “is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,\n\nexperience, training, or education,” then the Court may permit the witness to testify – so long as\n\nthe witness’s “testimony is based on sufficient facts or data,” “the testimony is the product of\n\nreliable principles and methods,” and the witness has “reliably applied the principles and\n\nmethods to the facts of the case.” FED. R. EVID. 702. The party seeking to introduce the expert\n\ntestimony must demonstrate its admissibility under Rule 702 by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nSee Meister v. Med. Eng’r Corp., 267 F.3d 1123, 1127 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (citing Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. at 592 n.10); Rothe Dev., Inc. v. Dep’t of Defense, 107 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 183, 197 (D.D.C. 2015). The Court has “broad discretion in determining whether to\n\nadmit or exclude expert testimony.” U.S. ex rel. Miller v. Bill Harbert Int’l Constr., Inc., 608\n\nF.3d 871, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Gatling, 96 F.3d 1511, 1523 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996)).\n\n               “[T]he twin requirements for the admissibility of expert testimony are evidentiary\n\nreliability and relevance.” FTC v. Whole Foods Mkt., Inc., No. 07-1021, 2007 WL 7632283, at\n\n*1 (D.D.C. July 27, 2007). “With respect to evidentiary reliability, the Court’s focus must be on\n\nthe methodology or reasoning employed by application of the factors in Rule 702 and the non-\n\nexhaustive list of factors set forth in Daubert and Kumho.” Id.; see Daubert v. Merrell Dow\n\nPharm., Inc., 509 U.S. at 595 (holding that the “focus, of course, must be solely on principles and\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fmethodology, not on the conclusions they generate”); Ambrosini v. LaBarraque, 101 F.3d 129,\n\n140 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“[T]he admissibility inquiry focuses not on conclusions but on\n\napproaches . . . .”). These factors include: “(1) whether the theory or technique can be and has\n\nbeen tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and\n\npublication; (3) the method’s known or potential rate of error; and (4) whether the theory or\n\ntechnique finds general acceptance in the relevant scientific community.” Ambrosini v.\n\nLabarraque, 101 F.3d at 134 (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. at 593-94).\n\nThe Court is not bound by only these factors when considering reliability. As the D.C. Circuit\n\nhas noted, “[t]he test of reliability is ‘flexible’ and ‘the law grants a district court the same broad\n\nlatitude when it decides how to determine reliability as it enjoys [with] respect to its ultimate\n\nreliability determination.’” Gilmore v. Palestinian Interim Self-Gov’t Auth., 843 F.3d 958, 972\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. at 142).\n\n                “With respect to relevance, the Court must determine whether the proffered\n\ntestimony is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case and whether it will aid the factfinder in\n\nresolving a factual dispute.” FTC v. Whole Foods Mkt., Inc., 2007 WL 7632283, at *1 (citing\n\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. at 592-93). This is a consideration of “fit.”\n\nAmbrosini v. Labarraque, 101 F.3d at 134 (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S.\n\nat 591). “‘Fit’ is not always obvious, and scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily\n\nscientific validity for other, unrelated purposes.” Id. (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm.,\n\nInc., 509 U.S. at 591).\n\n\n                    II. EXPERTS PROFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES\n\n                Toyobo moves to exclude the opinions and testimony of seven experts proffered\n\nby the United States: (1) Dr. S. Leigh Phoenix; (2) Dr. Alan J. Lesser; (3) Dr. David S.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fBrookstein; (4) Dr. Michael A. Riley; (5) Kirk Rice; (6) Joseph T. Anastasi; and (7) Dr. A.S.\n\nAbhiraman. The Court notes at the outset that the rulings set forth in this Opinion pertain to the\n\nexpert reports filed in this action, United States ex rel. Westrick v. Second Chance Body Armor,\n\nInc. (Civil Action No. 04-0280), and not the related action, United States v. Toyobo Co., Ltd.\n\n(Civil Action No. 07-1144). In addition, the portions of the pending motions relating to Dr.\n\nAllen L. Price and Dr. Bradley S. Field are now moot, as Toyobo has withdrawn its designations\n\nof those two proffered experts. See Joint Report re: Daubert Hearings [Dkt. No. 503].\n\nSeparately, in response to the Court’s summary judgment rulings on September 4, 2015, see\n\nUnited States ex rel. Westrick v. Second Chance Body Armor, Inc., 128 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C.\n\n2015), the parties have withdrawn their arguments related to the commercial warranty provided\n\nby Second Chance Body Armor, Inc. (“Second Chance”). See Joint Submission Regarding\n\nPreviously Filed Daubert Motions [Dkt. No. 456].\n\n\n                                    A. Dr. S. Leigh Phoenix\n\n               Dr. S. Leigh Phoenix is a tenured professor of mechanical and aerospace\n\nengineering at Cornell University proffered by the United States to opine on the relationship\n\nbetween fiber properties and ballistic performance. Dr. Phoenix holds a Doctorate in Theoretical\n\nand Applied Mechanics from Cornell University. See March 2012 Report, Phoenix Mot. Ex. 1 at\n\n1 (“Phoenix Report”) [Dkt. No. 382-3]. His primary areas of research include the ballistic\n\nimpact of fibrous structures, statistical and micromechanical modeling, and fracture mechanics\n\nand fatigue modeling in metals. Id. Dr. Phoenix has authored over one hundred peer-reviewed\n\narticles, including four articles on ballistic modeling. See Phoenix Opp. at 3.\n\n               Dr. Phoenix has submitted three expert reports in this case: (i) an affirmative\n\nreport dated March 15, 2012; (ii) a supplemental report dated October 3, 2012, submitted in\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fresponse to one of Toyobo’s proffered experts, Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki; and (iii) a declaration\n\ndated May 15, 2013. 2 Toyobo has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 382] to exclude Dr. Phoenix’s\n\nopinions in their entirety, a motion which the United States opposes. While the parties agree that\n\nDr. Phoenix is qualified to opine on properties of Zylon fiber, they disagree over whether Dr.\n\nPhoenix may reliably opine on fiber properties as they relate to ballistic applications and\n\nToyobo’s disclosures to body armor manufacturers. The Court therefore will focus its analysis\n\non the reliability and fit of Dr. Phoenix’s proffered opinions.\n\n\n                                  1. Opinions Regarding Ballistics\n\n               Dr. Phoenix opines that fiber tensile strength is a critical factor in determining the\n\nballistic performance of body armor: if fiber tensile strength decreases by a significant amount,\n\nso too will the ballistic performance of that fiber. See Phoenix Report at 5-6. Toyobo seeks to\n\nexclude this opinion and Dr. Phoenix’s other opinions regarding ballistics on the grounds that\n\nthey are not reliable, will not assist the jury in deciding the issues in this case, and would invade\n\nthe province of the jury. Phoenix Mot. at 10.\n\n               Toyobo argues that Dr. Phoenix relied solely on mathematical models and did not\n\nconduct any tests using “real bullets” to ensure that his models accurately predict the real-life\n\nperformance of Zylon fiber incorporated into a bulletproof vest. Phoenix Mot. at 4. Toyobo\n\nfurther asserts that Dr. Phoenix’s ballistic models apply to only a subset of the bulletproof vests\n\nat issue, ignore the effects of vest design and construction, are not used to design or test body\n\narmor, and do not accurately predict the results of ballistic testing done by Second Chance on its\n\nused Zylon vests. Id. at 10-14. In addition, Toyobo contends that Dr. Phoenix has neither\n\n\n       2       Dr. Phoenix has also submitted a rebuttal report dated May 23, 2012 in response\nto Dr. Allen Price and Dr. Field who, as noted, have been withdrawn.\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fdesigned nor manufactured bulletproof vests and thus lacks relevant professional experience to\n\nsupport his conclusions regarding ballistic performance. Id. at 14. Permitting Dr. Phoenix’s\n\ntestimony under these circumstances, Toyobo argues, would be unfairly prejudicial to Toyobo.\n\nId.\n\n               The Court disagrees. Dr. Phoenix’s opinions regarding ballistics and ballistic\n\nperformance are based on a sound methodology and would aid the jury in evaluating the\n\nsuitability of Zylon for use in bulletproof vests. Dr. Phoenix used his expertise in fiber\n\nproperties and ballistic modeling to analyze Toyobo’s testing data measuring the tensile strength\n\nof Zylon fiber over time. See, e.g., Phoenix Report at 6-10. Dr. Phoenix’s ballistic impact\n\nmodeling is generally accepted science that has been cited forty-nine times in peer-reviewed\n\narticles. Phoenix Opp. at 13. Dr. Phoenix need not have experience designing or manufacturing\n\nbulletproof vests to reliably assess the behavior of Zylon fiber incorporated into bulletproof vests\n\nusing peer-reviewed ballistic modeling. Furthermore, Toyobo’s concerns over the lack of\n\nballistic testing using “real bullets” or the limits of Dr. Phoenix’s ballistic models go to the\n\nweight to be accorded to his testimony and not its admissibility under Daubert or Rule 702. See\n\nRobinson v. District of Columbia, 75 F. Supp. 3d 190, 200 (D.D.C. 2014). The Court therefore\n\nwill admit Dr. Phoenix’s proffered opinions regarding ballistics and ballistic performance.\n\n               Separately, Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Phoenix’s opinion that Second Chance’s\n\nused-vest testing showed that some Zylon vests would fall below the standards set by the\n\nNational Institute of Justice (“NIJ”) before five years. Phoenix Mot. at 15-16; Phoenix Report at\n\n42. Toyobo characterizes this opinion as pertaining to “the durability of Second Chance’s Zylon\n\nvests.” Phoenix Mot. at 15. The United States responds that Dr. Phoenix does not offer an\n\nopinion on the durability of Second Chance vests, but rather questions Second Chance’s\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\finterpretation of its used-vest testing data. Phoenix Opp. at 29-30. Based on Dr. Phoenix’s\n\nreport and his deposition testimony, however, it appears that Dr. Phoenix does indeed offer an\n\nopinion that “one can crudely estimate [that] some vests would likely fall below the NIJ standard\n\nwell before 5 years . . . .” See Phoenix Report at 42; 01/17/13 Phoenix Dep. at 913:16-915:8\n\n[Dkt. No. 382-15]. Because this opinion is admittedly based on a “crude” estimate, the Court\n\nwill exclude it.\n\n                              2. Opinions Regarding Toyobo’s Disclosures\n\n                   In 2001, Toyobo periodically tested the strength retention of thirteen spools of\n\nZylon fiber that had been continuously exposed to conditions of 40°C and 80% relative\n\nhumidity. Toyobo then disclosed the results of that testing to body armor manufacturers and\n\nothers in the body armor industry. Dr. Phoenix opines that Toyobo’s disclosures were improper\n\nfor several reasons: (i) Toyobo “suppressed” the fact that each spool had a different level of\n\nstrength retention by disclosing averaged data rather than raw data for each spool; (ii) Toyobo\n\nselected spools with higher “Na/P ratios” in order to boost the results of the fiber strength testing;\n\n(iii) Toyobo deleted outlier data points; and (iv) Toyobo delayed the disclosure of its testing data.\n\n                   Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Phoenix’s opinions about Toyobo’s disclosures for\n\ntwo main reasons. First, Toyobo asserts that Dr. Phoenix’s opinions about the impact of the\n\ndisclosures on the body armor industry are based on speculation rather than on reliable principles\n\nor accepted data-reporting standards in the fiber and ballistics industries. Phoenix Mot. at 18-20.\n\nToyobo argues that Dr. Phoenix does not know what body armor manufacturers did with the\n\ninformation from Toyobo, whether they were misled, what expectations they had of Toyobo,\n\nwhether they asked to receive raw data for each spool of Zylon, or what information they found\n\nimportant. Id. Toyobo further argues that Dr. Phoenix has not worked for a fiber supplier, has\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fnot designed a bulletproof vest, and is not familiar with the data reporting methods of fiber\n\nsuppliers. Id. Second, Toyobo contends that Dr. Phoenix’s opinions about Toyobo’s internal\n\nknowledge and motives are speculative and would invade the province of the jury. Id. at 20-21.\n\nToyobo asserts that Dr. Phoenix has no reliable basis to proffer opinions about what Toyobo\n\nknew or intended when it conducted its testing and disclosed data to the body armor industry. Id.\n\n               The Court will admit certain portions of Dr. Phoenix’s proffered opinions and\n\nexclude others. Dr. Phoenix’s methodology is reliable insofar as he used his expertise in fiber\n\nproperties to compare Toyobo’s internal testing data to the representations made in its\n\ndisclosures. Dr. Phoenix need not have experience as a fiber supplier or in bulletproof vest\n\ndesign to reliably interpret Toyobo’s data generated from testing Zylon fiber. Due to the\n\ntechnical nature of Toyobo’s data and disclosures, Dr. Phoenix’s opinions would aid the jury in\n\nevaluating whether Toyobo’s disclosures were misleading. The Court therefore will admit Dr.\n\nPhoenix’s opinions comparing Toyobo’s testing data to the data presented in its disclosures and\n\nexplaining how a reasonable person would have interpreted the disclosures. See In re Rail\n\nFreight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., No. 07-mc-0489, 2017 WL 5311533, at *40 n.25\n\n(D.D.C. Nov. 13, 2017) (admitting expert’s opinion that defendants’ behavior was consistent\n\nwith collusion but excluding his opinion that defendants intended to collude). For instance, Dr.\n\nPhoenix may explain the results of Toyobo’s testing, describe what information Toyobo did or\n\ndid not disclose (e.g., reporting averaged data rather than raw data and removing certain data\n\npoints), opine on whether and why certain spools of Zylon fiber performed better than others,\n\nand describe the amount of time between disclosures.\n\n               The Court will exclude, however, opinions regarding Toyobo’s knowledge or\n\nintentions with respect to its disclosures to body armor manufacturers. Such testimony would be\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\ftoo speculative to satisfy the reliability threshold of Rule 702 and would touch upon the ultimate\n\nissue for the jury of whether Toyobo’s disclosures were misleading. See SEC v. Johnson, 525 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 70, 78-79 (D.D.C. 2007) (excluding expert’s opinion that employees intended to\n\ndeceive auditors and that defendants misled auditors). Specifically, Dr. Phoenix will not be\n\npermitted to opine on what Toyobo knew about Zylon degradation, why Toyobo made the\n\ndecision to test certain spools over others, why Toyobo chose to disclose or withhold certain\n\ndata, why Toyobo chose to present certain data in the manner that it did, or whether Toyobo was\n\nmotivated by business or other concerns. See Sykes v. Napolitano, 634 F. Supp. 2d 1, 9 (D.D.C.\n\n2009) (excluding expert’s conclusion that a party was motivated by “self promotion and a fervent\n\nquest to discredit the Plaintiff”); see also In re Chantix (Varenicline) Prod. Liab. Litig., 889 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1272, 1287 (N.D. Ala. 2012) (excluding expert testimony as to what defendant “knew”\n\nor that defendant “misled” the FDA, but admitting testimony as to what information defendant\n\nprovided to the FDA).\n\n               Relatedly, the Court will exclude bald assertions based on the documentary record\n\nregarding Toyobo’s intent or motivations. Dr. Phoenix includes these statements in some of his\n\ndiscussion of the documentary record and Toyobo’s testing. See, e.g., Phoenix Report at 12\n\n(“Documents show . . . [that] there was marketing pressure to increase the production speed [of\n\nspools of Zylon fiber].”). The jury is competent to read and interpret the evidence without Dr.\n\nPhoenix’s proffered opinions. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 2017 WL\n\n5311533, at *21 (holding that “an economist’s testimony is not admissible where he or she\n\nsimply reads and interprets evidence of collusion as any juror might, or where an economist\n\ninfers intent to collude from mere documentary evidence, unrelated to his or her economic\n\nexpertise”).\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f                 For similar reasons, the Court will exclude portions of Dr. Phoenix’s opinions\n\nregarding whether body armor manufacturers were misled by Toyobo’s disclosures, what\n\ninformation should have been conveyed to body armor manufacturers, and what information was\n\nimportant to body armor manufacturers. Dr. Phoenix’s expertise in fiber properties and ballistic\n\nmodeling does not support his opinions on norms governing the disclosure of testing data within\n\nthe body armor industry.\n\n\n                          3. Opinions in Response to Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki\n\n                 Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Phoenix’s opinions provided in response to one of\n\nToyobo’s proffered experts, Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki. Dr. Phoenix and Dr. Yabuki disagree over\n\nthe relationship between “Na/P ratio” and the strength retention of Zylon. In Dr. Phoenix’s\n\nopinion, Na/P ratio is an important indicator of how quickly Zylon fiber will degrade due to\n\nexposure to heat and humidity. See October 2012 Report, Phoenix Mot. Ex. 3 at 5-6 [Dkt. No.\n\n382-5]. Dr. Phoenix opines that Dr. Yabuki incorrectly concludes that there is a weak correlation\n\nbetween Na/P ratio and Zylon degradation. Toyobo argues that Dr. Phoenix is not a polymer\n\nchemist and thus lacks relevant experience, training, or education to reliably opine on the\n\nrelationship between Na/P ratio and strength retention. Phoenix Mot. at 23-24.\n\n                 The Court is not persuaded that Dr. Phoenix’s opinion and testimony on this topic\n\nshould be excluded. Dr. Phoenix employed a reliable methodology by using his expertise in\n\nmathematical modeling to compare Toyobo’s testing data tracking the Na/P ratio and strength\n\nretention of various samples of Zylon fiber tested under conditions of 40°C and 80% relative\n\nhumidity. Dr. Phoenix need not be a polymer chemist to perform this type of data analysis. Dr.\n\nPhoenix’s opinions proffered in response to Dr. Yabuki therefore will be admitted for the jury’s\n\nconsideration.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f                                      B. Dr. Alan J. Lesser\n\n               Dr. Alan J. Lesser is a tenured professor of polymer science at the University of\n\nMassachusetts, Amherst proffered by the United States as an expert in fiber properties and\n\nballistic performance. Dr. Lesser holds a Doctorate in Civil Engineering from Case Western\n\nReserve University and worked as a research scientist in the Polymeric Materials Department for\n\nShell Development Company prior to entering academia. March 2012 Report, Lesser Mot. Ex. 1\n\nat 1 and Appendix A (“Lesser Report”) [Dkt. No. 374]. His research interests include fracture\n\nand adhesion of fibers and environmental stress cracking and chemical degradation of polymer-\n\nbased materials. Id. at 1. Dr. Lesser has significant research experience in polymer chemistry\n\nand fiber properties and has authored ninety-four peer-reviewed papers, including ten papers\n\ndetailing the impacts of environmental effects on the behavior of polymers and polymer-based\n\nfibers. Lesser Report at 5.\n\n               Dr. Lesser has submitted an affirmative report dated March 15, 2012 in this case.\n\nToyobo has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 374] to exclude portions of Dr. Lesser’s opinions, a motion\n\nwhich the United States opposes. The Court will address each of Toyobo’s objections in turn.\n\n\n                     1. Opinions Regarding Ballistics and Vest Performance\n\n               Dr. Lesser opines that various properties of Zylon fiber render Zylon “so\n\nmechanically and chemically fragile” that it is not suitable for use in bulletproof vests. Lesser\n\nReport at 19. According to Toyobo, this opinion and Dr. Lesser’s other opinions related to\n\nballistic performance are unreliable because he lacks relevant ballistics experience – including\n\ndesigning, manufacturing, or testing bulletproof vests – and did not conduct ballistic testing to\n\nconfirm that his opinions accurately reflect the behavior of Zylon fiber incorporated into a\n\nbulletproof vest. Lesser Mot. at 7. Toyobo also contends that Dr. Lesser merely parrots a model\n\n\n                                                12\n\fof ballistic performance developed by another United States expert, Phillip M. Cunniff, that is\n\nintended to be used in conjunction with ballistic testing. Id. at 7-9.\n\n               The Court will admit Dr. Lesser’s opinions regarding ballistic performance and\n\nthe suitability of Zylon for use in bulletproof vests. Dr. Lesser is qualified to offer opinions on\n\nthese topics based on his experience studying and working with fibers and ballistic impact\n\nmodels. He reached his opinions through a reliable methodology, in which he applied his\n\nknowledge of fiber properties to assess Toyobo’s degradation data using the Cunniff model of\n\nballistic performance. See, e.g., Lesser Report at 7-9. The Cunniff model – which predicts the\n\nperformance of soft body armor based on alterations in various fiber properties – has been peer-\n\nreviewed and is generally accepted in the scientific community. Id. at 8. Dr. Lesser’s opinions\n\non the properties of fibers and their impact on ballistic performance would assist the jury in\n\nassessing the suitability of Zylon fiber for use in bulletproof vests.\n\n               Contrary to Toyobo’s assertion, Dr. Lesser does not merely parrot the Cunniff\n\nmodel, but rather applies his own expertise to compare the results of the Cunniff model against\n\nother ballistic models to measure ballistic performance. See Lesser Report at 7-9; McReynolds\n\nv. Sodexho Marriott Servs., Inc., 349 F. Supp. 2d 30, 36 (D.D.C. 2004) (“An expert witness is\n\npermitted to use assistants in formulating his expert opinion.” (quoting Dura Auto. Sys. of Ind.,\n\nInc. v. CTS Corp., 285 F.3d 609, 612 (7th Cir. 2002)); see also Lee Valley Tools, Ltd. v. Indus.\n\nBlade Co., 288 F.R.D. 254, 266 (W.D.N.Y. 2013) (“Where the expert was directly involved in\n\nthe research, analysis or drafting of the report, even with substantial assistance from a colleague\n\nor associate, his involvement in and knowledge of the report are matters of weight, not\n\nadmissibility.”). Dr. Lesser’s lack of experience designing or manufacturing bulletproof vests\n\ndoes not render his opinions regarding ballistic performance and the suitability of Zylon in\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fbulletproof vests unreliable. Furthermore, Toyobo’s objections regarding the lack of ballistic\n\ntesting and the purported limitations of the Cunniff model go to weight and not admissibility.\n\nSee Robinson v. District of Columbia, 75 F. Supp. 3d at 200. The Court therefore will admit Dr.\n\nLesser’s opinions on ballistic performance and Zylon’s suitability for use in bulletproof vests.\n\n\n                           2. Opinions Regarding Toyobo’s Disclosures\n\n               Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Lesser’s opinion that Toyobo communicated\n\n“misleading” disclosures to body armor manufacturers. Lesser Mot. at 15-19. Dr. Lesser opines\n\nthat Toyobo presented data that overestimated Zylon’s strength retention, made inappropriate\n\npredictions about service life, continually altered the manner in which it presented data, used\n\nmetrics that misled customers with respect to durability, and misrepresented data by removing\n\ndata points from graphs sent to manufacturers. Lesser Report at 20-28. Toyobo argues that these\n\nopinions are speculative because Dr. Lesser does not know what information body armor\n\nmanufacturers sought or expected from Toyobo or how they interpreted the disclosures. Lesser\n\nMot. at 15-19. In addition, Toyobo asserts that opining on the effect of the disclosures on the\n\nbody armor industry is speculative and would invade the province of the jury. Lesser Reply at\n\n10-12.\n\n               For the same reasons discussed in connection with Dr. Phoenix, the Court will\n\nadmit certain portions of Dr. Lesser’s proffered opinion and exclude others. Dr. Lesser’s\n\nmethodology is reliable insofar as he uses his expertise in polymer science and fiber properties to\n\ncompare Toyobo’s internal testing data to the representations made in its disclosures. Dr. Lesser\n\nneed not have experience as a fiber supplier or in bulletproof vest design to reliably interpret\n\nToyobo’s data generated from testing Zylon fiber. Dr. Lesser’s comparisons would assist the\n\njury in evaluating, inter alia, whether Toyobo’s disclosures regarding its fiber testing results were\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fmisleading. The Court therefore will admit Dr. Lesser’s opinions comparing Toyobo’s testing\n\ndata to the data presented in its disclosures and explaining how a reasonable person would have\n\ninterpreted the disclosures. For instance, Dr. Lesser may describe the results of Toyobo’s\n\ntesting, the information that Toyobo did or did not disclose, and the manner in which the data\n\nwas presented. See, e.g., Lesser Report at 28 (“Each of these [alterations in the way the data was\n\npresented] make it difficult for customers to independently evaluate appropriate service life of\n\nproducts based on strength retention.”).\n\n               The Court will exclude, however, opinions regarding Toyobo’s knowledge or\n\nintentions with respect to its disclosures to body armor manufacturers. Such testimony would be\n\nbased on unsupported speculation and would invade the province of the jury. In particular, Dr.\n\nLesser will not be permitted to opine on what Toyobo knew about Zylon degradation at a given\n\ntime, why Toyobo chose to disclose or withhold certain data, why Toyobo chose to present\n\ncertain data in the manner that it did, or whether Toyobo was motivated by business or other\n\ninterests.\n\n               The Court will also exclude bald conclusions based on the documentary record\n\nregarding Toyobo’s intent or motivations or other topics beyond the scope of Dr. Lesser’s\n\nexpertise. For example, Dr. Lesser opines that “[t]he pressure from the business and sales part\n\nof . . . Toyobo’s organization over this period of time caused considerable tension between the\n\nvarious individuals and groups in the company” and that “numerous internal documents from\n\nToyobo support the immense difficulty they incurred while trying to neutralize the residual PPA\n\nin Zylon AS fiber.” Lesser Report at 17. This will not be permitted. The jury is competent to\n\nread and interpret the evidence relevant to these topics without Dr. Lesser’s proffered opinions.\n\nAs another example, Dr. Lesser provides opinions on Toyobo’s quality control procedures, but\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fhas not established any specialized expertise in quality control procedures beyond reading\n\ninternal Toyobo documents: “[S]ince Toyobo has no methods in place to control this\n\nconcentration at the time of delivery to their customers, they have no way to insure that any of\n\ntheir products meet their own specifications.” Id. at 13; see id. at 17 (“This becomes particularly\n\ncritical since simply identifying a product as ‘red’ is too subjective and cannot be used as a\n\ncriterion for quality control.”). The Court therefore will exclude this type of proffered testimony.\n\n                 For similar reasons, the Court will exclude Dr. Lesser’s opinions regarding\n\nwhether body armor manufacturers were misled by Toyobo’s disclosures, what information\n\nshould have been conveyed to body armor manufacturers, and what information was important to\n\nbody armor manufacturers. See, e.g., Lesser Report at 20 (“Toyobo communicated misleading\n\nresults to customers.”). Dr. Lesser’s expertise in polymer science and fiber properties does not\n\nsupport his opinions on norms applicable to the disclosure of testing data within the fiber and\n\nballistics industries.\n\n\n                                    C. Dr. David S. Brookstein\n\n                 Dr. David S. Brookstein has a Bachelor’s Degree in Textile Engineering from the\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology, and both a Master of Science Degree in Textile Technology and\n\na Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nBrookstein Opp. at 4. From 1994 to 2010, he served as the Dean of the School of Engineering\n\nand Textiles at Philadelphia University and a professor of engineering. Id. Prior to that time, Dr.\n\nBrookstein spent fourteen years as the Associate Director of the Albany International Research\n\nCompany, a commercial research laboratory where he conducted a wide range of research and\n\ndevelopment projects involving high-performance fibers such as Kevlar. See March 15, 2012\n\nReport, Brookstein Mot. Ex. 1 at 1 (“Brookstein Report”) [Dkt. No. 384-3].\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f               Dr. Brookstein has submitted one affirmative expert report dated March 15,\n\n2012. 3 Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Brookstein’s testimony that Zylon is unsuitable for use in\n\nballistic applications. Brookstein Mot. at 8. According to Toyobo, Dr. Brookstein’s\n\nmethodology is not reliable because he lacks expertise in ballistics – including vest design,\n\nconstruction, or manufacturing – and has not conducted ballistic testing to confirm how Zylon\n\nfiber behaves once it is incorporated into a bulletproof vest. Id. at 9; Brookstein Reply at 4-7. In\n\naddition, Toyobo asserts that Dr. Brookstein could not pinpoint what makes Zylon defective or\n\nexplain why other fibers that have kink bands and undergo hydrolysis are not similarly defective.\n\nBrookstein Mot. at 12-13. Toyobo also urges the Court to exclude Dr. Brookstein’s opinions\n\nabout Toyobo’s manufacturing, quality assurance, and quality control processes, Brookstein Mot.\n\nat 14-18, and his opinion that Toyobo misled the body armor industry. Id. at 19-21.\n\n               After reviewing his expert report, the Court has questions about Dr. Brookstein’s\n\nmethodology and the bases for many of his opinions and conclusions. Beyond that, many of his\n\nobservations are conclusory or speculative, clearly are not proper for testimony by an expert,\n\nintrude upon the function of the jury, attribute motives to Toyobo that are beyond his ken, or are\n\npejorative in tone (e.g., that “Toyobo was derelict” and the manufacturing process “was out of\n\ncontrol”). His chart of “what Toyobo knew and when it first knew it regarding the strength\n\nretention of Zylon fiber used in the ballistics industry,” Brookstein Report at 54-56, clearly is\n\nbeyond the pale. Furthermore, many of Dr. Brookstein’s opinions regarding Toyobo’s\n\n\n\n       3        Dr. Brookstein has also submitted a supplemental report dated May 23, 2012 in\nresponse to Dr. Price and Dr. Field who, as noted, have been withdrawn. The supplemental\nreport also responds to opinions offered by a third Toyobo expert, Herbert Heuchert. Because\nthe Court will exclude Mr. Heuchert’s testimony, infra at 47-51, the Court need not address the\nportions of Dr. Brookstein’s May 23, 2012 supplemental report pertaining to Mr. Heuchert’s\nproffered opinions.\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fdisclosures are not admissible for the same reasons explained with respect to Dr. Phoenix and\n\nDr. Lesser.\n\n                Should the United States still wish to offer Dr. Brookstein as an expert witness for\n\nlimited purposes, it should indicate in writing which opinions it still seeks to offer at trial, after\n\nwhich the Court will hear testimony from Dr. Brookstein at a further Daubert hearing in advance\n\nof trial.\n\n\n                                      D. Dr. Michael A. Riley\n\n                Dr. Michael A. Riley is a body armor researcher proffered by the United States as\n\nan expert in ballistic testing and ballistic performance of Zylon body armor. Because Dr. Riley\n\nis neither a retained expert nor an individual whose duties regularly involve giving expert\n\ntestimony, he did not provide an expert report but rather provided a letter summarizing his\n\nqualifications and affirmative expert opinions. See FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a)(2)(C).\n\n                Dr. Riley holds a Doctorate in Civil Engineering from the State University of\n\nNew York at Buffalo. Riley Opp. at 4. He joined the National Institute of Standards and\n\nTechnology (“NIST”) in 1997 and currently serves as the Program Manager for Test and\n\nEvaluation in the Protective Systems Research Group of the Office of Law Enforcement\n\nStandards. Id. at 3-4. In that capacity, Dr. Riley oversees ballistic testing of body armor,\n\ndevelops proficiency tests for ballistic armor testing laboratories, and assesses commercial\n\nlaboratories’ abilities to perform body armor testing. Id. at 3. He also advises the NIJ on the\n\ndevelopment of new body armor standards. Id. In addition, Dr. Riley helped revise the NIJ\n\nStandard for testing law enforcement body armor and evaluate the safety of Zylon vests in the\n\nfield. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f                Toyobo has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 380] to exclude only the following opinion\n\nproffered by Dr. Riley: “Fiber suppliers such as Toyobo Co. should provide a product to\n\nweavers and body armor manufacturers that is consistent with purchasing specifications –\n\nincluding documentation about normal production variations, how the material ages, and factors\n\nthat influence aging – and does not significantly change from those purchasing specifications\n\nover warranty periods of active use.” November 9, 2012 Affirmative Opinions Letter, Riley\n\nMot. Ex. 4 at 2 (Opinion Six) [Dkt. No. 380-6]. 4\n\n                Toyobo argues that Dr. Riley is not qualified and has no reliable basis to opine on\n\nthe relationship between a fiber supplier and a weaver or body armor manufacturer, or the duties\n\nallegedly owed by a fiber supplier. Riley Mot. at 8. Toyobo contends that Dr. Riley fails to\n\nexplain how his research and experience in Zylon degradation and fiber properties qualify him to\n\nopine on the type of information a fiber supplier should provide in purchasing specifications.\n\nRiley Reply at 11-14. According to Toyobo, Dr. Riley has had no conversations with body\n\narmor manufacturers or weavers about what information they expect to receive from fiber\n\nsuppliers in purchasing specifications; has neither worked for fiber suppliers, weavers or body\n\narmor manufacturers, nor designed a bulletproof vest; has not seen a Zylon weaver’s purchasing\n\nspecifications for Zylon fiber; and is not aware of purchasing specifications that require the type\n\nof information that Dr. Riley opines Toyobo and other fiber suppliers should provide. Riley\n\nMot. at 8-10. Toyobo points out that although Dr. Riley has spoken to three fiber suppliers, he\n\nhas little information about how fiber suppliers and body armor manufacturers worked together\n\nprior to 2005, the period relevant to this case. Id. at 9.\n\n\n        4      Toyobo has also moved to exclude another opinion offered by Dr. Riley\npertaining to Second Chance’s commercial warranty, which is no longer at issue. See Joint\nSubmission Regarding Previously Filed Daubert Motions [Dkt. No. 456].\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f               The Court is not persuaded that this opinion should be excluded. As the project\n\nmanager responsible for overseeing ballistic testing of law enforcement body armor on behalf of\n\nthe United States, Dr. Riley is qualified to opine on whether fiber suppliers should provide a\n\nproduct that meets its purchasing specifications. Dr. Riley has experience using Zylon fiber\n\nspecifications to study the effect of aging on Zylon and determining when a product fails to meet\n\nits purchasing specifications. As for his experience working with fiber suppliers, Dr. Riley has\n\nhad “extensive discussions with some fiber suppliers and [he has] spent a great deal of time\n\nlooking through some of their literature to understand what’s provided.” 03/12/13 Riley Dep. at\n\n879:4-13 [Dkt. No. 400-2]. Dr. Riley has also spoken with procurement officials whose jobs are\n\nto purchase armor for officers in their agencies. Riley Reply Ex. 5 at 4. Toyobo’s arguments\n\nthat those conversations occurred after the time period at issue here and did not involve\n\npurchasing specifications go to the weight of Dr. Riley’s opinion and not its admissibility.\n\n               In addition, the Court concludes that Dr. Riley’s knowledge and experience as a\n\nresearcher in the field of safety standards provides a sound basis for his opinion. At his\n\ndeposition, Dr. Riley explained that he based his opinion on literature related to fiber suppliers\n\nand discussions with three fiber suppliers. Furthermore, rather than opining that Toyobo failed\n\nto meet a particular requirement or satisfy a legal duty, Dr. Riley opines that fiber suppliers\n\nshould provide a product that is consistent with purchasing specifications and remains so over a\n\ngiven period of time. That Dr. Riley has never worked for a fiber supplier, bulletproof vest\n\nmanufacturer, or weaver goes to weight and not admissibility. In addition, it appears that\n\nToyobo largely agrees with Dr. Riley on this point and that its disagreement concerns the scope\n\nof Dr. Riley’s opinion. See Riley Reply at 11 n.28 (“Toyobo largely agrees” with the\n\nproposition that “fiber manufacturers should provide a product consistent with its purchasing\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fspecifications. . . .”). The Court therefore will admit Dr. Riley’s opinion regarding purchasing\n\nspecifications.\n\n\n                                            E. Kirk Rice\n\n                  Kirk Rice is a body armor researcher proffered by the United States as an expert\n\nin ballistic testing and ballistic performance of Zylon body armor. Because Mr. Rice is neither a\n\nretained expert nor an individual whose duties regularly involve giving expert testimony, he did\n\nnot provide an expert report but rather provided a letter summarizing his qualifications and\n\naffirmative expert opinions. See FED. R. CIV.

Toyobo argues that Mr. Rice is not\n\nqualified and has no reliable basis to opine on the relationship between a fiber supplier and a\n\nweaver or body armor manufacturer, or the duties allegedly owed by a fiber supplier. Rice Mot.\n\nat 1. Toyobo contends that Mr. Rice has only a general, academic understanding of the types of\n\nmaterial used by body armor manufacturers, rather than real-world experience. Id. at 7. Toyobo\n\nargues that Mr. Rice has never worked for a fiber supplier or body armor manufacturer; has\n\nnever designed, developed, or sold a bulletproof vest; has not seen a weaver’s purchasing\n\nspecification for Zylon fiber; and is not aware of any purchasing specifications that require the\n\ninformation that he opines Toyobo and other fiber suppliers should provide. Id. Toyobo further\n\nasserts that Mr. Rice did not speak to any fiber suppliers about the type of information they\n\ntypically provide to weavers and body armor manufacturers in purchasing specifications.\n\n               The Court concludes that Mr. Rice is qualified to offer this opinion and has an\n\nadequate basis for his opinion. As the lead scientist for the United States on body armor systems\n\nand standards, Mr. Rice is qualified to opine on whether fiber suppliers should provide a product\n\nthat meets its purchasing specifications. He also has significant experience with fiber\n\nspecifications. At deposition, Mr. Rice testified that his opinion is informed by his discussions\n\nwith several fiber suppliers and his involvement in fiber degradation research. Rice Opp. at 18.\n\n\n       5     Toyobo has also moved to exclude another opinion offered by Mr. Rice pertaining\nto Second Chance’s commercial warranty, which is no longer at issue. See Joint Submission\nRegarding Previously Filed Daubert Motions [Dkt. No. 456].\n\n\n                                                22\n\fToyobo’s arguments that those conversations occurred after the time period at issue here and did\n\nnot involve purchasing specifications go to weight and not admissibility. Moreover, rather than\n\nopining that Toyobo failed to meet a particular requirement or satisfy a legal duty, Mr. Rice\n\nopines that fiber suppliers should provide a product that is consistent with purchasing\n\nspecifications and that remains so over a given period of time. It appears that Toyobo largely\n\nagrees with Mr. Rice on this point and that its disagreement concerns the scope of Mr. Rice’s\n\nopinion. See Rice Reply at 11 n.30 (“Toyobo largely agrees” with the proposition that “fiber\n\nmanufacturers should provide a product consistent with its purchasing specifications . . . .”). The\n\nCourt therefore will admit Mr. Rice’s opinion regarding purchasing specifications.\n\n\n                                     F. Joseph T. Anastasi\n\n               Joseph T. Anastasi is a certified public accountant proffered by the United States\n\nas an expert witness in forensic accounting and the performance of damages analysis for matters\n\nin litigation. He has filed two expert reports in this case, one dated March 15, 2012, and the\n\nother dated September 14, 2012. In addition, by Memorandum Opinion and Order of January\n\n17, 2018, the Court permitted the United States to file a supplemental expert report of Mr.\n\nAnastasi dated December 22, 2017. See Mem. Op. and Order [Dkt. No. 514]. Toyobo has filed\n\na motion [Dkt. No. 375] to exclude the opinions and testimony of Mr. Anastasi, a motion which\n\nthe United States opposes.\n\n               Mr. Anastasi holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Accounting from\n\nPennsylvania State University. Mr. Anastasi is a managing director at the Berkeley Research\n\nGroup, a financial and economic consulting firm. He has also served variously as the Global\n\nPractice Leader for the Forensic & Investigative Service Practice at Deloitte and a Managing\n\nPartner at PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n\n                                                23\n\f                Toyobo argues that Mr. Anastasi has no basis to opine on damages in this case\n\nboth because his methodology is flawed and unreliable and because, as a matter of law, what the\n\nUnited States paid Second Chance does not answer the ultimate question of what damages the\n\nUnited States actually suffered because the product sold had more than zero value. In other\n\nwords, Toyobo contends that the United States’ expenditures or payments do not equate with\n\ndamages. Anastasi Mot. at 10. Rather, Toyobo maintains, the proper measure of damages is the\n\ndifference between the value of the goods or services actually provided and the value they would\n\nhave had if delivered as promised. Anastasi Reply at 5-6. The United States responds that\n\nMr. Anastasi is being offered as an expert witness to provide the jury with an understanding of\n\nthe vast sales data at issue in the case, his testing of that sales data, and his quantification of the\n\ndata. It maintains that the methodologies he used to analyze this massive amount of sales data\n\nwere painstaking and reliable and that his analysis would be helpful to the jury. Anastasi Opp. at\n\n17-18. As for the legal question, the United States argues that the law is clear: False Claims Act\n\ndamages in a case involving the sale of defective products is a straight-forward analysis of how\n\nmuch the United States paid for the defective product since the defect renders the product sold\n\nand delivered valueless. Anastasi Opp. at 9.\n\n                The Court has carefully reviewed Mr. Anastasi’s March 2012 and September\n\n2012 expert reports and his proffered supplemental report of December 22, 2017. In his reports,\n\nMr. Anastasi separately reviewed (1) the sales made directly by Second Chance to United States\n\nagencies through the General Services Administration (“GSA”) and (2) reimbursements made by\n\nthe United States to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies under the Bulletproof Vest\n\nPartnership Act (“BVP”). In the case of the GSA sales, Mr. Anastasi and his staff examined\n\n17,000 line items and twenty-three boxes of Second Chance sales invoices and other\n\n\n\n                                                   24\n\fdocumentation and matched spreadsheets to supporting invoices, order forms and other kinds of\n\ndocumentation. Anastasi Opp. at 1-2, 17-18. He found that the vast majority of the electronic\n\nsales records were supported by Second Chance invoices and other forms of documentation.\n\nDoing further calculations to account for instances where they did not match or where there were\n\npossible overcharges, he made corrections and calculated an amount. Id. at 17-18. With respect\n\nto the BVP reimbursements, Mr. Anastasi relied primarily on calculations done by Linda\n\nHammond-Deckard, but he then did his own analysis and calculated an amount in BVP\n\nreimbursements made by the United States to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn his September 2012 report, he engaged in random sampling techniques and corroborated the\n\nearlier analysis he had done with respect to the BVP sales. In his supplemental report of\n\nDecember 22, 2017, Mr. Anastasi provided a payments analysis – to supplement his earlier sales\n\nanalysis – with respect to orders for sales to federal agencies under GSA contracts as to which he\n\nhad already provided an analysis of sales data. 6\n\n               The Court agrees with the United States that Mr. Anastasi’s analysis, both with\n\nrespect to the GSA payments and the BVP reimbursements, is thorough and that his\n\nmethodologies are sound. His work with respect to GSA payments went well beyond the realm\n\nof simple mathematics, contrary to Toyobo’s assertion, and required the extensive review of\n\ntwenty-three boxes of invoices and other sales documents, as well as the application of\n\nrecognized forensic accounting techniques and statistical analysis. Indeed, his forensic\n\naccounting analysis resulted in his making downward adjustments to the underlying sales data\n\n\n       6        In that supplemental report, Mr. Anastasi also revised the start date for his\ncalculations to conform to this Court’s July 14, 2017 ruling. See United States ex rel. Westrick\nv. Second Chance Body Armor, Inc., 266 F. Supp. 3d 110 (D.D.C. 2017). Toyobo does not\noppose the supplementation of Mr. Anastasi’s earlier reports, calculations, and opinions to revise\nthe start date.\n\n\n                                                    25\n\fnumbers because of errors, credits, overcharges, and the like, which he discovered. With respect\n\nto Mr. Anastasi’s BVP reimbursements analysis, it is true that he relied heavily on Ms.\n\nHammond-Deckard, but he did not simply rubber stamp or “parrot” her work. He also\n\nconducted an independent review of a significant sample of the data, which confirmed that the\n\nBVP reimbursements data that had been compiled by Ms. Hammond-Deckard were supported by\n\nentries in the BVP accounting system database. See, e.g., SEC v. e-Smart Techs., Inc., 85 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 300, 312 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Experts at IDTP, moreover, did not simply parrot opinions\n\narticulated elsewhere. They examined data, verified results, gathered their own data, and ran tests\n\nof their own. Their approach to the technical issues in this case was appropriate to support expert\n\ntestimony.”); Dura Auto. Sys. of Ind., Inc. v. CTS Corp., 285 F.3d at 612 (“An expert witness is\n\npermitted to use assistants in formulating his expert opinion.”). In both instances, Mr. Anastasi’s\n\nanalyses conformed to accepted forensic accounting methods, and their presentation at trial will\n\nbe extremely helpful to the jury. For all of these reasons, the Court will admit Mr. Anastasi’s\n\nopinions and testimony at trial, subject to the following reservation.\n\n               The Court need not now opine on the legal question raised by the parties –\n\nwhether payments or expenditures made by the United States are the appropriate measure of\n\ndamages in a False Claims Act case involving the sale of defective products, or whether the price\n\npaid must be reduced by value received in order to calculate damages. 7 That determination can\n\nbe postponed until the Court has had a further opportunity to review the various court decisions\n\ncited by the parties and any additional authority they wish to provide. Furthermore, the parties\n\n\n\n       7       Each side cites numerous cases in support of their legal arguments, but the\ntouchstone in this jurisdiction must be United States v. Science Applications Int’l Corp., 626\nF.3d 1257, 1277-80 (D.C. Cir. 2010). See also JOHN T. BOESE, CIVIL FALSE CLAIM S AND QUI\nTAM ACTIONS §§ 3.01 [B], 3.01 [C], 3.01 [D] (4th ed. 2011).\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fwill soon submit proposed jury instructions, including instructions with respect to damages,\n\nwhich will, of course, be supported by case citations and references to standard instructions used\n\nin other similar cases. The only open question as it relates to Mr. Anastasi’s opinions and\n\ntestimony to be offered at trial is whether he will be permitted to characterize the numbers about\n\nwhich he testifies as a result of his calculations and analyses as “damages” or as something else. 8\n\n\n                                        G. Dr. A.S. Abhiraman\n\n               Dr. A.S. Abhiraman is a fiber scientist proffered by the United States as a rebuttal\n\nwitness to respond to one of Toyobo’s proffered experts, Herbert Heuchert. Such rebuttal\n\ntestimony is not necessary, however, because Mr. Heuchert will not be permitted to testify for\n\nthe reasons discussed infra at 47-51.\n\n\n\n                           II. EXPERTS PROFFERED BY TOYOBO\n\n               The Court turns next to the expert witnesses proffered by Toyobo. The United\n\nStates moves to exclude portions of the opinions and testimony of three expert witnesses\n\nproffered by Toyobo: (i) Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki; (ii) Dr. Robert M. Nowak; and (iii) Herbert\n\nHeuchert.\n\n                                        A. Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki\n\n               Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki is an industrial fiber researcher and chemist. See May 2012\n\nReport, Yabuki Mot. Ex. 1 at 1 (“Yabuki Report”) [Dkt. No. 385-3]. He holds a Doctorate in\n\nEngineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology and joined Toyobo as a researcher in 1972.\n\n\n\n       8      Furthermore, Toyobo has filed a motion in limine [Dkt. No. 499] on the measure\nof damages which raises this issue and the parties will shortly be filing proposed jury\ninstructions.\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fSee Yabuki Opp. at 3-4. While employed at Toyobo, Dr. Yabuki served variously as a research\n\nchemist, chief research engineer, and director of research and development at Toyobo. Id. at 3-4,\n\n6. Between 1994 and 2000, Dr. Yabuki oversaw the development and commercialization of\n\nZylon fiber, which involved overseeing technical aspects of Zylon development including\n\nspinning, polymerization, and construction of the commercial production plant for Zylon. Id. at\n\n1, 3-4; Transcript of Daubert Hearing With Respect to Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki (“Yabuki Hearing\n\nTranscript”) at 36:7-38:6 (Jan. 23, 2018). In December 2000, Dr. Yabuki left his position\n\noverseeing the day-to-day aspects of Zylon to take on broader management roles at Toyobo.\n\nYabuki Report at 4. Between 2009 and his retirement in 2013, he served as a corporate auditor\n\nresponsible for ensuring that Toyobo’s board of directors properly discharged its duties. Dr.\n\nYabuki has also been a visiting professor at several universities in Japan. Id. at 4, 6. He has\n\npublished twenty-seven articles on Zylon, as well as several other research papers on fiber\n\nproperties. Id.\n\n                  Dr. Yabuki has been designated as a rebuttal witness to respond to three experts\n\nproffered by the United States – Dr. Phoenix, Dr. Lesser, and Dr. Brookstein. Dr. Yabuki has\n\nsubmitted one rebuttal report dated May 23, 2012. The United States filed a motion [Dkt. No.\n\n385] to exclude Dr. Yabuki’s opinions in their entirety, a motion which Toyobo opposes. The\n\nCourt will refer to each opinion by the number of the corresponding section in Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nreport where the opinion is discussed.\n\n                  The Court held a Daubert hearing on January 23, 2018, at which Dr. Yabuki\n\ntestified. During the hearing, Toyobo withdrew Opinion Eight, regarding Toyobo’s efforts to\n\ndevelop stronger Zylon fiber through the “ZKP Project,” and Opinion Ten, regarding the\n\n“forthcoming and reasonable” nature of Toyobo’s disclosures. See Yabuki Hearing Transcript at\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f8:24-9:25, 71:14-18. Toyobo also withdrew Opinion Eleven, with the exception of the final two\n\nparagraphs discussing “Na/P ratio” and the use of Zylon vests in 2003. Id. 9\n\n               The United States asserts three global objections to Dr. Yabuki’s proffered\n\nopinions. First, it argues that Dr. Yabuki’s reports were prepared in significant part by other\n\nToyobo employees with expertise beyond the scope of Dr. Yabuki’s own expertise and whose\n\nwork Dr. Yabuki “blindly” accepted without independent verification. Yabuki Mot. at 8-14, 18-\n\n21. 10 Second, the United States contends that Dr. Yabuki either did not read certain references\n\ncited in his report or read them many years ago. Id. at 15-24. Third, the United States asserts\n\nthat Dr. Yabuki’s opinions do not fit the facts of the case because Dr. Yabuki offers opinions\n\nabout Toyobo’s manufacturing process and quality control system but does not know how either\n\nsystem operated. 11\n\n               Toyobo responds that Dr. Yabuki’s reliance on other Toyobo employees was\n\nproper because he “directed and supervised all of [the] work [of these employees], personally\n\ndrafted his expert report, and reviewed and verified their work to confirm its accuracy.” Yabuki\n\nOpp. at 7. Toyobo asserts that Dr. Yabuki employed a sound methodology by using his\n\nprofessional experience working with Zylon fiber and his expertise in various fiber properties to\n\n\n\n       9      The Court will reserve judgment on Opinions 14-17 proffered only in the related\nToyobo action (Civil Action No. 07-1144).\n       10      The United States argues that it did not have the opportunity to cross-examine\nthese employees. Yabuki Mot. at 11-15. The Court finds this argument unavailing, however, as\nthe United States could have moved to compel the depositions of these employees but declined\nto do so.\n       11      The United States also seeks to preclude Dr. Yabuki from offering certain\nopinions that he agreed not to offer at his deposition. See Yabuki Mot. at 41-43. Because the\nparties represented that they would resolve this issue through a joint stipulation, the Court need\nnot address the issue here. See Yabuki Hearing Transcript at 74:19-75:15.\n\n\n                                                29\n\fanalyze facts provided by these employees. See id. at 8-10. Toyobo argues that these employees\n\nhad specialties that were “very similar” to his own and that Dr. Yabuki opined on topics that fall\n\nwithin his areas of expertise. Id. at 11. In light of Dr. Yabuki’s sound methodology, Toyobo\n\ncontends, his failure to read certain references or to read them recently goes to the weight of his\n\nopinions rather than to their admissibility. Id. at 33-35.\n\n                Upon careful review of Dr. Yabuki’s report, deposition testimony, and testimony\n\nbefore the Court at the January 23 Daubert hearing, the Court will admit certain portions of his\n\nproffered opinions and exclude others. While the Court acknowledges the concerns expressed by\n\nthe United States with respect to Dr. Yabuki’s reliance on other Toyobo employees and his\n\nfailure to read certain references in his report, the Court finds that these concerns do not\n\npermeate all of Dr. Yabuki’s reports, testimony and opinions. Yabuki Mot. at 2. Accordingly,\n\nthe Court will address each of Dr. Yabuki’s opinions in turn.\n\n\n                                    1. Opinion One (Kink Bands)\n\n                Dr. Yabuki concludes that the opinions of Dr. Phoenix and Dr. Brookstein\n\nregarding the presence of “kink bands” in Zylon fiber – damage to fiber structure due to\n\ncompression or bending – are incorrect for several reasons. Yabuki Report at 3-5. For instance,\n\nDr. Yabuki opines that kink bands are not unique to Zylon and do not necessarily cause a\n\nsignificant loss in tensile strength, and that it is “well known in the ballistic industry that fiber\n\ndamage due to weaving can decrease [ballistic] performance.” Id. Dr. Yabuki further opines\n\nthat “Toyobo has no control over how Zylon is woven, handled and/or treated” once it leaves\n\nToyobo’s plant and that weavers and end-product manufacturers are “in the best position to\n\ndetermine what impact post-manufacturing processing has on a fiber.” Id. Dr. Yabuki also\n\n\n\n\n                                                   30\n\fopines that “Second Chance had the information it needed to account for the impacts of the\n\nweaving process on Zylon fiber when designing its Zylon vests.” Id.\n\n               The Court will admit Opinion One for the jury’s consideration. Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nconclusions regarding kink band formation and whether kink bands render Zylon defective are\n\nbased on a sound methodology grounded in Dr. Yabuki’s extensive experience with industrial\n\nfibers and supported by references to multiple research papers. 12 With respect to Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nconclusions regarding fiber damage caused by the weaving process – (i) that it is “well known\n\nthat fibers are susceptible to [the formation of kink bands] during the weaving process”; (ii) that\n\nit is “well known in the ballistic industry that fiber damage due to weaving can decrease [ballistic\n\nperformance]”; and (iii) that “[t]hese facts were known to body armor makers and others in the\n\nballistics industry” – it appears that Dr. Yabuki drew upon his extensive experience developing\n\nfibers for commercialization and use by manufacturers in various end-products. As a fiber\n\nchemist who was intimately involved in Toyobo’s efforts to develop Zylon fiber and bring it to\n\nmarket, Dr. Yabuki may reliably opine on whether it was “well known” that fiber damage due to\n\nweaving, including the formation of kinks bands, could decrease ballistic performance. To be\n\nsure, Dr. Yabuki testified at his deposition that he is “not too knowledgeable about [ballistics]”\n\nand relied on Mr. Kuroki in preparing his opinions about manufacturing for ballistic applications.\n\nSee 8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 17:11-23 [Dkt. No. 385-6]; Yabuki Hearing Transcript at 53:21-\n\n55:18, 59:10-20. Dr. Yabuki appears to be opining, however, on whether body armor\n\n\n\n       12       Dr. Yabuki withdrew one of the references cited in this section of his report – a\nPowerPoint prepared by one of the government’s experts, Dr. Amanda Forster – because he had\nnot read it. See 8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 58:7-59:18, 73:1-5 [Dkt. No. 385-6]. The Court is not\npersuaded that Opinion One is “so unreliable . . . that is fails Daubert’s reliability prong” based\non this single withdrawn reference. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 2017\nWL 5311533, at *37.\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fmanufacturers, as consumers of fiber for use in bulletproof vests, would have known that fiber is\n\nsusceptible to damage due to the weaving process and may affect ballistic performance as a\n\nresult. The Court therefore will admit Opinion One for whatever weight the jury may deem\n\nappropriate.\n\n\n                                  2. Opinion Two (Microvoids)\n\n               Dr. Yabuki responds to the opinions of Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein regarding\n\nmicrovoids – fiber swelling due to moisture – by explaining that microvoids are not unique to\n\nZylon and do not render Zylon defective. Yabuki Report at 5-10. Dr. Yabuki describes how\n\nmicrovoids form, draws comparisons to microvoids in Kevlar, and critiques the analysis applied\n\nby Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein. Yabuki Report at 6-8. He also opines that “end-product\n\nmanufacturers must protect Zylon from external moisture . . . .” Id. at 10.\n\n               The Court will admit Opinion Two for the jury’s consideration. Dr. Yabuki\n\napplied a reliable methodology grounded in his knowledge of industrial fibers and personal\n\ninvolvement in the development of Zylon fiber. Dr. Yabuki cites multiple research papers to\n\nsupport his opinion, including four that he co-authored, as well as other research conducted by\n\nToyobo. Yabuki Report at 5-10. With respect to Dr. Yabuki’s reliance on other Toyobo\n\nemployees, Dr. Yabuki testified at his deposition that Dr. Abe prepared the calculations for\n\nFigure 2 and that he “had Dr. Kitigawa check Dr. Lesser’s calculations.” See 8/22/12 Yabuki\n\nDep. at 17:6-10, 39:18-40:6 [Dkt. No. 385-6]. Accordingly, as to Opinion Two, it appears that\n\nDr. Yabuki relied on other Toyobo employees to verify and plot certain data. Furthermore, to\n\nthe extent that Dr. Yabuki relied on other Toyobo employees for their expertise in\n\nmicrostructures, morphology, and x-ray scattering, Dr. Yabuki testified that he also has expertise\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\fin those areas. See 08/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 38:20-39:24 [Dkt. No. 385-6] (“So between or\n\namong Dr. Murase, Dr. Kitigawa and myself, our specialties are very similar.”).\n\n                  The United States argues that Dr. Yabuki read three references cited in support of\n\nOpinion Two many years ago. See 8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 83:3-85:13 [Dkt. No. 385-6]\n\n(explaining that he read the book chapter by Young cited at footnote 16 in his report in 1990);\n\n8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 90:19-91:18 [Dkt. No. 385-6] (explaining that he read the Northholt\n\npaper cited at footnote 18 in his report in 1990 or 1991 and “perhaps” did not read the entirety of\n\nthe paper in preparing his reports but “confirmed and checked” the paper); 8/23/12 Yabuki Dep.\n\nat 102:1-105:4 [Dkt. No. 385-6] (explaining that he read the Martin paper cited at footnote 20 in\n\nhis report in 1998 and re-read certain pages in preparing his report). Because Dr. Yabuki appears\n\nto have read each of these references at some point, and in light of the other references cited in\n\nsupport of Opinion Two, the Court concludes that this issue does not render Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nopinion “so unreliable . . . that is fails Daubert’s reliability prong.” See In re Rail Freight Fuel\n\nSurcharge Antitrust Litig., 2017 WL 5311533, at *37. The Court finds that the United States’\n\nfurther efforts to discredit Dr. Yabuki’s methodology by asserting that the book chapter by Dr.\n\nYoung cited in Dr. Yabuki’s report stands for the opposite proposition than that for which it is\n\ncited goes to weight rather than admissibility. See Ambrosini v. Labarraque, 101 F.3d at 140;\n\nMcReynolds v. Sodexho Marriott Servs., Inc., 349 F. Supp. 2d at 39; SEC v. Johnson, 525 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 76.\n\n\n                                 3. Opinion Three (Moisture Regain)\n\n                  Dr. Yabuki responds to Dr. Lesser’s and Dr. Brookstein’s conclusions that the\n\nmoisture regain in Zylon fiber renders the fiber defective by explaining that moisture regain is “a\n\nwell understood phenomenon in polymer chemistry” and is not unique to Zylon. Yabuki Report\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fat 11. Dr. Yabuki opines that the “end product manufacturer should design its product so as to\n\nprotect the polymer . . . from external moisture.” Id. at 11. Dr. Yabuki also offers multiple\n\nopinions in response to Dr. Brookstein’s conclusions about Toyobo’s manufacturing process and\n\nquality control procedures. Id.\n\n               The Court will admit certain portions of Opinion Three and exclude others. Dr.\n\nYabuki may offer opinions on: (i) the fiber properties of Zylon as they relate to moisture regain;\n\n(ii) the duration of exposure to sunlight sufficient to cause degradation; (iii) whether Toyobo has\n\ncontrol over Zylon fiber once it leaves Toyobo’s plant; and (iv) whether end-product\n\nmanufacturers or weavers could take steps to protect the fiber from moisture. These opinions\n\nwere reached through a reliable methodology grounded in Dr. Yabuki’s extensive experience\n\nwith fiber properties and his knowledge of the certain aspects of the manufacturing process (e.g.,\n\nexposure to light or water) that may affect fiber properties.\n\n               The Court will exclude, however, certain opinions regarding Toyobo’s quality\n\ncontrol procedures or those of weavers and Second Chance. Although Dr. Yabuki may properly\n\nopine that “were any light or ambient condition-induced degradation to occur, it would be\n\nreflected in the fiber properties that are measured after Zylon is ‘exposed’ to light and ambient\n\nconditions at the plant,” he may not opine that “the spool would be downgraded under Toyobo’s\n\n[quality control] procedures” as a result. Yabuki Report at 11. Furthermore, he may not opine\n\nthat “weavers checked the fiber properties of Zylon fiber when it arrived at their plant, and with\n\nthe exception of long red yarn and shipping-related physical damage (unrelated to light or\n\nhygrothermal degradation), there is no evidence that any shipments of Zylon were rejected\n\nbecause the fiber properties were outside of specification” or that “weaver [quality control]\n\nprocesses demonstrated that the Zylon that arrived at the weaver’s factories met Toyobo’s Zylon\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fspecification.” Id. at 11. Dr. Yabuki has not established any specialized expertise in Toyobo’s\n\nquality control procedures or those of weavers of ballistic fibers. Indeed, it appears that his\n\nknowledge of Toyobo’s quality control procedures is based solely on information provided by\n\nother Toyobo employees, namely Mr. Kuroki and Mr. Teramoto. See, e.g., 8/22/12 Yabuki Dep.\n\nat 41:6-13 [Dkt. No. 385-6].\n\n\n                           4. Opinions Regarding Residual Phosphorous\n\n               Opinions Four, Five, and Six address the presence of residual phosphorus in\n\nZylon fiber, which can lower tensile strength and resistance to thermal degradation. In\n\nparticular, Opinion Four challenges Dr. Brookstein’s and Dr. Lesser’s conclusion that Toyobo\n\nallows excessive phosphorus to remain in Zylon fiber. Yabuki Report at 12-13. Relatedly, in\n\nOpinion Five, Dr. Yabuki concludes that Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein wrongly suggest that\n\n“residual PPA” (residual phosphoric acid) is not adequately neutralized and contributes to\n\nhydrolytic degradation (moisture damage) in Zylon. Yabuki Report at 13. Similarly, Opinion\n\nSix provides that Dr. Lesser’s opinions about the existence of residual phosphorus in Zylon as a\n\nmono-aryl phosphate ester are incorrect. Id. at 14-16. Dr. Yabuki describes Toyobo’s research\n\non this topic and concludes that PBO mono-phosphate does not catalyze hydrolysis. Id. at 15-16.\n\n               The Court will admit Opinions Four, Five, and Six, subject to the exceptions\n\nbelow. These opinions are based in large part on a reliable methodology grounded in his\n\nextensive experience analyzing fiber properties and his personal involvement in the research\n\nefforts of Toyobo and Dow Chemical. The Court will exclude, however, the following portions\n\nof Opinion Four and Opinion Five regarding Toyobo’s quality control procedures for confirming\n\nthat the fiber was properly neutralized:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f       Opinion Four: [T]he evidence establishes that the Zylon Toyobo sold was well\n       within the residual P target of 5,000 ppm or less. For example, the manufacturing\n       process that was designed to reduce residual P to levels at or below 5,000 ppm and\n       production conditions (e.g., residence time and wash temperature) was tightly\n       controlled to ensure that this was accomplished. . . .Toyobo frequently checked the\n       residual P content and, in all instances except one, found that Zylon contained less\n       than 5,000 ppm residual P. With respect to the one exception, residual P was only\n       slightly more than 5,000 ppm and Toyobo did not ship the fiber for use in bullet-\n       resistant applications.\n\n       Opinion Five: As a quality assurance measure, Toyobo checked the color of the\n       Zylon fiber in the fourth washing cabinet to confirm neutralization. This verified\n       that the Zylon produced was neutralized. And during production, Toyobo\n       frequently checked the residual sodium and phosphorous content in Zylon, and used\n       the data to calculate Na/P molar ratios. This testing consistently confirmed that the\n       Zylon produced for commercial sale was properly neutralized, and that the Na/P\n       ratio remained within the specified range.\n\nYabuki Report at 12-14. Dr. Yabuki has not established that he has specialized expertise in this\n\narea and appears to have relied solely on Mr. Teramoto and certain Toyobo documents. See\n\n8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 41:6-13 [Dkt. No. 385-6].\n\n               With respect to Opinion Six, the United States argues that Dr. Yabuki cited the\n\nwrong paper written by Dr. Ying-Hung So. See 8/23/12 Yabuki Dep. at 143:3-144:25 [Dkt. No.\n\n385-6]. The United States asserts that Dr. Yabuki also misstated or overstated Dr. So’s research\n\nfindings because, inter alia, Dr. So’s research required more than just adding “a drop of water” to\n\nremove the mono-aryl phosphate ester from the PBO molecule. 8/23/12 Yabuki Dep. at 155:17-\n\n21 [Dkt. No. 385-6]. The Court is not persuaded that Opinion Six is “so unreliable . . . that it\n\nfails Daubert’s reliability prong” based on the citation to the incorrect article by the same author\n\nin one instance. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 2017 WL 5311533, at\n\n*37. The Court further concludes that the objection that Dr .Yabuki overstated the article’s\n\nfindings goes to weight and not admissibility. See SEC v. Johnson, 525 F. Supp. 2d at 76.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f                                 5. Opinion Seven (Strength Loss)\n\n               Dr. Yabuki opines that Dr. Phoenix, Dr. Lesser, and Dr. Brookstein incorrectly\n\nsuggest that Zylon is defective because it is susceptible to strength loss over time. Yabuki\n\nReport at 16-21. Dr. Yabuki opines that all materials, including fibers like Zylon, are susceptible\n\nto degradation. Id. at 16-17. Dr. Yabuki explains that Kevlar, like Zylon, degrades under certain\n\nconditions and is not considered to be “sub-standard.” Id. at 17-19. Dr. Yabuki also opines that\n\nthe rate of hydrolysis can be reduced if “the end-product manufacturers protect Zylon from\n\nexposure to external moisture.” Id. at 19. Dr. Yabuki relies on a NIST study regarding the\n\ndegradation of Zylon due to moisture to show that “if the Zylon fiber is protected from exposure\n\nto external moisture once it has been incorporated into a vest, there should be little or no\n\ndegradation of the strength of the Zylon fiber.” Id. at 19-20.\n\n               The United States raises two primary objections to Opinion Seven. First, the\n\nUnited States argues that the NIST study that Dr. Yabuki relied on was issued two years after\n\nZylon stopped being sold. See Yabuki Hearing Transcript 36:7-38:6 [Dkt. No. 385-6]; Yabuki\n\nReport at 19 n.62. Second, the United States argues that at his deposition, Dr. Yabuki identified\n\ntwo “commercially available and well-known methods” for protecting Zylon against external\n\nmoisture using seaweed and aluminum film. 11/8/12 Yabuki Dep. at 293:4-294:25. The United\n\nStates argues that these opinions do not fit the facts of this case because Dr. Yabuki does not\n\nknow if these methods can be used to protect Zylon from external moisture in ballistic\n\napplications or whether Toyobo informed body armor manufacturers about the need to protect\n\nZylon from moisture degradation.\n\n               The Court will admit Opinion Seven for the jury’s consideration. Dr. Yabuki\n\napplied a sound methodology by applying his knowledge of fiber properties as well as research\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\ffrom papers that he co-authored to assess Zylon fiber’s susceptibility to moisture degradation\n\nand strength loss. His partial reliance on the NIST study that was issued two years after Zylon\n\nwas no longer being sold is permissible, as Dr. Yabuki testified at the Daubert hearing that the\n\nfindings and the study mainly confirmed an established scientific fact that he had always known.\n\nSee Yabuki Hearing Transcript 36:7-38:6. Opinion Seven would assist the jury in assessing the\n\nsuitability of Zylon fiber for use in ballistic applications.\n\n                As for his references to the protective qualities of seaweed and aluminum film,\n\nDr. Yabuki does not purport to opine on whether the methods are feasible to protect body armor\n\nmade from Zylon fiber from moisture or whether these methods were communicated to body\n\narmor manufacturers. Rather, he offered these suggestions in response to a question asked by\n\ncounsel for the United States. 11/08/12 Yabuki Dep. at 293:9-294:6 [Dkt. No. 385-6]. Counsel\n\nmay cross examine Dr. Yabuki on this point.\n\n\n                                    6. Opinion Nine (Red Thread)\n\n                According to Dr. Yabuki, Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein incorrectly conclude that\n\nthe presence of red thread indicates that Zylon is defective. Yabuki Report at 21. Dr. Yabuki\n\nopines that there is no evidence that Second Chance used Zylon fabric containing red thread,\n\nToyobo had quality control processes in place to inspect for red thread, and weavers and body\n\narmor manufacturers had quality control systems in place to segregate non-conforming fiber. Id.\n\nat 21-22. Dr. Yabuki opines that “my review of the record shows that these stops worked\n\nbecause weavers and Second Chance caught red thread during their [quality assurance and\n\nquality control] processes, and Toyobo never received a report of red fiber being used in the\n\nmanufacture of a bullet-resistant vest.” Id. at 22.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   38\n\f               The Court will exclude Opinion Nine in its entirety. Dr. Yabuki’s opinion\n\nappears to be based on his “review of the record” and information conveyed by Toyobo\n\nemployees rather than on any specialized expertise in Toyobo’s quality control processes.\n\n11/8/12 Yabuki Dep. at 304:7-307:4 [Dkt. No. 385-6] (explaining that Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nunderstanding of Toyobo’s quality assurance and quality control procedures discussed in his\n\nreports to detect red thread was based on what he was told by Mr. Teramoto or Mr. Tanaka);\n\nYabuki Hearing Transcript at 56:4-58:8. Dr. Yabuki does not analyze red thread in terms of its\n\nimpact on Zylon fiber or its formation during the manufacturing process, but rather focuses on\n\nwhether Toyobo’s quality control procedures were designed to identify and segregate Zylon fiber\n\ncontaining red thread. Opinion Nine therefore will be excluded. 13\n\n\n                                7. Opinion Eleven (Na/P Ratio)\n\n               In the portion of Opinion Eleven that Toyobo has not withdrawn, Dr. Yabuki\n\nopines that Dr. Phoenix miscalculated the correlation between Na/P ratio and strength retention.\n\nYabuki Report at 30-32. After re-plotting the same data used by Dr. Phoenix, Dr. Yabuki found\n\na weaker correlation than the figures reported by Dr. Phoenix. Id. Separately, Dr. Yabuki opines\n\nthat Dr. Brookstein “ignores the fact that Second Chance continued to use Zylon in Triflex vests\n\neven after Toyobo’s October 2003 disclosures and Second Chance’s warranty exchange\n\nprogram.” Id. at 32.\n\n               Because Dr. Yabuki’s correlation analysis is based on the same data that Dr.\n\nPhoenix used and Dr. Yabuki merely disagrees with Dr. Phoenix’s conclusions, the Court will\n\n\n\n       13     Because the Court will exclude Opinion Nine, the Court need not address the\narguments raised by the United States with respect to the expert report of Herbert Heuchert or the\nHexcel Corporation documents cited on page 22 of Dr. Yabuki’s report.\n\n\n                                               39\n\fadmit Dr. Yabuki’s correlation analysis in Opinion Eleven. See Ambrosini v. LaBarraque, 101\n\nF.3d at 140 (“[T]he admissibility inquiry focuses not on conclusions but on approaches . . . .”).\n\nThe Court will exclude, however, the final paragraph of Opinion Eleven regarding Second\n\nChance’s continued use of Triflex vests after 2003. This portion of Dr. Yabuki’s proffered\n\nopinion reads more like a lawyer’s argument than an expert opinion based on specialized\n\nknowledge of or experience with Toyobo’s disclosures to body armor manufacturers.\n\n\n                            8. Opinion Twelve (Use of Averaged Data)\n\n               In Opinion Twelve, Dr. Yabuki opines that, contrary to the conclusions reached\n\nby Dr. Phoenix, Dr. Lesser, and Dr. Brookstein, Toyobo properly accounted for data scatter in\n\ntensile strength measurements by averaging the results of Toyobo’s strength testing. Yabuki\n\nReport at 32. The Court will admit Opinion Twelve, except for the following sentence:\n\n“Toyobo’s handling of the data is consistent with JIS L1013 and ASTEM 0885.” Id. Dr. Yabuki\n\ntestified at his deposition that he read JIS L1013 or ASTEM 0885 many years ago and did not re-\n\nread them in preparation for his report and relied on Toyobo’s quality control and quality\n\nassurance department to confirm that Toyobo’s procedures had conformed to these standards.\n\n11/9/12 Yabuki Dep. at 398:14-399:23 [Dkt. 385-6].\n\n\n                            9. Opinion Thirteen (Ballistic Application)\n\n               In Opinion Thirteen, Dr. Yabuki disagrees with Dr. Brookstein’s opinion that\n\nToyobo was responsible for determining the suitability of Zylon for use in a given end-product.\n\nYabuki Report at 32-33. First, Dr. Yabuki opines that the “final determination of suitability for\n\nuse lies with the end-product manufacturers – here, Second Chance.” Yabuki Report at 33.\n\nWith respect to fiber used in ballistic applications, Dr. Yabuki opines, inter alia, that “there are\n\n\n\n                                                  40\n\fmany different end-product designs” and that “fiber manufacturers cannot test their fiber for each\n\nof the infinite array of product designs with respect to vests using Zylon, and the use of Zylon\n\nwith other ballistic materials.” Id. The Court will admit these portions of Opinion Thirteen for\n\nthe jury’s consideration.\n\n               Second, Dr. Yabuki opines that “in my experience the end users like Second\n\nChance consider their end product design to be proprietary and do not share the designs with a\n\nraw material supplier like Toyobo.” Yabuki Report at 33. He also opines that “fiber suppliers\n\ndo not control end-product designs, including how the fiber is processed and whether it is\n\nprotected from sources of environmental damage, such as light degradation or external moisture,\n\nor how much Zylon is incorporated into the end design.” Id. He concludes: “For all of these\n\nreasons, it is customary in the high performance fiber industry for high performance fiber\n\nsuppliers not to provide any warranties or guarantees regarding the use of the fiber in end\n\napplications.” Id.\n\n               The Court will exclude these portions of Opinion Thirteen. Dr. Yabuki fails to\n\ncite a single publication, article, or other resource setting forth industry standards or other\n\nconventions to support his opinions regarding the specific practices of Second Chance or other\n\nbody armor manufacturers. Although Dr. Yabuki has extensive professional experience as a raw\n\nfiber supplier at Toyobo, he has not established how that experience informs or supports his\n\nopinions regarding the “customary” practices of body armor manufacturers. Absent such a\n\nshowing, Dr. Yabuki’s opinions are grounded in speculation rather than a reliable methodology.\n\n\n                                     B. Dr. Robert M. Nowak\n\n               Dr. Robert M. Nowak is a polymer chemist proffered by Toyobo as a rebuttal\n\nwitness to respond to two experts proffered by the United States, Dr. David S. Brookstein and\n\n\n                                                  41\n\fDr. Alan J. Lesser. Dr. Nowak holds a Doctorate in Chemistry from the University of Illinois.\n\nNowak Opp. at 2-3. He spent thirty-seven years at Dow Chemical Company, where he served as\n\nChief Scientist and Head of Central Research until retiring in 1993. Id. While employed at Dow\n\nChemical, Dr. Nowak oversaw the development of a number of synthetic polymers, including\n\nZylon. Id. Since that time, Dr. Nowak has spent fifteen years as the President and CEO of the\n\nMichigan Molecular Institute, a polymer research institute. Id. Dr. Nowak has published\n\neighteen papers on organic reaction mechanisms and reinforced plastics. Id.\n\n                Dr. Nowak has submitted a rebuttal report dated May 23, 2012. The United\n\nStates has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 383] to exclude certain opinions proffered by Dr. Nowak, a\n\nmotion which Toyobo opposes. Specifically, the United States seeks to exclude Opinions One,\n\nTwo, Three, Four, Five and Twelve in their entirety. Nowak Mot. at 3. The United States also\n\nseeks to exclude opinions on four additional topics: (i) analogies or comparisons of degradation\n\nin Zylon fiber or its polymer to degradation of human skin in sunlight and to metal fatigue in\n\naircraft parts and resulting aircraft crashes; (ii) whether Zylon’s aging characteristics and\n\nvulnerabilities had been quantified and its susceptibility to degradation could be addressed when\n\ndesigning a product; (iii) whether the results of testing used Zylon vests were more important\n\nthan testing Zylon fiber in a laboratory; and (iv) whether Toyobo had any control over Zylon\n\nafter it was shipped. 14\n\n\n\n\n        14       The United States also seeks to exclude “any topic on which Dr. Nowak testified\nat his deposition that he had no opinion.” Nowak Mot. at 4, 27. The United States attached a\nProposed Order to its motion identifying seventeen topics as to which Dr. Nowak purportedly\ntestified that he had no opinion. See Proposed Order [Dkt. No. 383-5]. Because the United\nStates’ request does not clearly identify which numbered opinions it seeks to exclude, the parties\nare directed to submit a joint stipulation identifying which opinions, if any, listed in Dr. Nowak’s\nreport remain in dispute in light of this Opinion.\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f                              1. Opinions One & Two (Strength Loss)\n\n                In response to Dr. Brookstein’s opinions that Toyobo should not have continued\n\nto sell Zylon because it could not resolve the Zylon degradation problem and that, because of its\n\ndegradation problem, Zylon was not suitable for use in ballistic applications, Dr. Nowak opines\n\nthat all materials degrade over time and degradation vulnerabilities – such as fiber tensile\n\nstrength loss – must be considered by the end-product manufacturer when designing end\n\nproducts. May 2012 Nowak Report, Mot. Ex. 1 at 3 (“Nowak Report”) [Dkt. No. 383-3]. The\n\nUnited States argues that Opinions One and Two are based on “junk science” rather than a\n\nreliable methodology and are generalized opinions which do not fit the facts of this case.\n\n                First, the United States seeks to exclude Dr. Nowak’s comparisons of Zylon\n\ndegradation to degradation of human skin in sunlight and metal fatigue in aircraft parts. Nowak\n\nMot. at 9-14. In support of Opinions One and Two, Dr. Nowak explains that steps can be taken\n\nto protect polymers from degradation sources like heat, light, and moisture, such as using\n\nsunscreen to protect skin (a natural polymer) from sun damage. Nowak Report at 7-8. In\n\nsupport of Opinion Two, Dr. Nowak explains that aluminum is used in aircraft parts even though\n\nit is susceptible to fatigue and corrosion in order to illustrate that Zylon’s susceptibility to\n\ndegradation does not render it defective. Id. at 8-9.\n\n                According to the United States, because Dr. Nowak did not explain the\n\nrelationship between human skin or metal and Zylon, the comparisons are not the product of a\n\nreliable methodology. Nowak Mot. at 9. The United States asserts that Dr. Nowak lacks the\n\ntraining or expertise to draw such a comparison because he is not a doctor or a metallurgist. Id.\n\nat 11-12. In addition, the United States contends that Dr. Nowak’s analogies risk confusing the\n\njury by conveying that degradation is either easily solved or an accident. Id. at 12-13. Toyobo\n\n\n\n                                                  43\n\fresponds that Dr. Nowak’s comparisons are mere “illustrations” and that Dr. Nowak does not\n\nanalogize Zylon degradation to sun degradation in skin or metal fatigue in aircrafts. Nowak\n\nOpp. at 9. Rather, Dr. Nowak based his opinions concerning degradation on polymer chemistry.\n\nToyobo argues that he used the examples only to show that all materials degrade (albeit\n\ndifferently) but may still be used so long as appropriate steps are taken by the end-product\n\nmanufacturer. Id. at 9-10.\n\n               The Court concludes that Dr. Nowak’s proffered comparisons are admissible for\n\nthe purpose for which they are offered – to show that all materials degrade over time and that\n\nsusceptibility to degradation can be addressed when designing a product. Dr. Nowak used a\n\nreliable methodology by applying his knowledge of and experience in principles of polymer\n\nchemistry and fiber properties. The jury can decide what weight to give to the examples he\n\ninvokes in support of his opinions regarding degradation. Furthermore, Dr. Nowak expressly\n\nacknowledged that these two materials are not analogous, thus minimizing the risk of confusion\n\nto the jury.\n\n               Second, the United States contends that Dr. Nowak’s opinion that body armor\n\nmanufacturers could use Zylon degradation information to design their vests does not fit the facts\n\nof the case. The United States argues that Dr. Nowak did not opine on whether Toyobo provided\n\nsufficient information to body armor manufacturers to design a vest to account for degradation.\n\nId. at 16. The United States further contends that his suggestion that the vest manufacturers\n\n“would go back to Toyobo and ask for more information” does not fit the facts because Second\n\nChance did not ask Toyobo to conduct any testing on its vests. Id. at 18.\n\n               The Court will admit Dr. Nowak’s opinion that degradation vulnerabilities must\n\nbe considered by the end-product manufacturer when designing end products. The Court finds\n\n\n\n                                                44\n\fthat the United States’ concerns regarding whether the information disclosed by Toyobo was\n\nsufficient or whether Second Chance asked Toyobo for further testing go to weight rather than\n\nadmissibility.\n\n\n                                  2. Opinion Four (Kink Bands)\n\n                 In Opinion Four, Dr. Nowak concludes that “[k]ink bands are a common\n\noccurrence in lyotropic LCPs like Kevlar, Zylon, M5 and others and are presumed to lower the\n\nmechanical properties of the polymer slightly. This is not a major problem and does not cause a\n\nfurther decay in properties over time.” Nowak Report at 13. The United States seeks to exclude\n\nthis opinion because it does not fit the facts of the case. It argues that Dr. Nowak incorrectly\n\nassumed that Toyobo did not have control over Zylon fiber after it left the Toyobo\n\nmanufacturing plant. Nowak Opp. at 24. 15 The United States argues that this assumption is\n\nbelied by the facts because Toyobo played a role in selecting weavers, worked with Second\n\nChance during the development of certain bulletproof vests, provided information and advice\n\nabout weaving to Second Chance and the weavers, and knew that the vests were 100% Zylon.\n\nId. at 25-26. The United States further argues that Dr. Nowak’s opinion that kink bands are not a\n\nmajor issue is improper because he is not a ballistics expert and cannot reliably opine on whether\n\nthe ballistics industry was aware of the extent of the damage that weaving caused in Zylon. Id. at\n\n26-27.\n\n                 The Court will admit Opinion Four. Dr. Nowak relied on his decades of\n\nexperience in polymer chemistry and working with synthetic polymers like Zylon and Kevlar to\n\nanalyze the factual record and reach his conclusions regarding the impact of kink bands on\n\n\n         15    This appears to be one of the bases for excluding Opinion Three, which the\nUnited States does not directly address in its briefing.\n\n\n                                                 45\n\fZylon’s suitability for use in bulletproof vests. The United States’ objections regarding whether\n\nToyobo exercised any control over Zylon fiber after it left the plant do not establish that Dr.\n\nNowak’s methodology is unsound, but rather express disagreement with his conclusions.\n\n\n                                    3. Opinion Five (Hydrolysis)\n\n               In Opinion Five, Dr. Nowak states that “studying the hydrolysis of a polymer\n\nunder laboratory conditions is very important data, but there is no substitute for evaluating the\n\nproduct containing that polymer under real life conditions by the manufacturer of the end\n\nproduct.” Nowak Report at 15. 16 The United States seeks to exclude the opinion that, as the\n\nUnited States puts it, “ballistic testing of the vests is more important than testing the fiber,” as\n\nunreliable in light of Dr. Nowak’s prior testimony about the results of Second Chance’s used vest\n\ntesting. The United States argues that this opinion does not fit the facts of this case because\n\nSecond Chance did provide Toyobo with the data from the testing of its used Zylon vests.\n\nNowak Mot. at 22-23.\n\n               The United States has mischaracterized Dr. Nowak’s opinion – Dr. Nowak merely\n\nopines that end-product testing is important, not that is it “more important.” Furthermore, if\n\nthere are inconsistencies between Dr. Nowak’s report and his prior testimony, this may be\n\nfruitful ground for cross examination. The Court therefore will admit Opinion Five.\n\n\n                                  4. Opinion Twelve (Red Thread)\n\n               In Opinion Twelve, Dr. Nowak opines that Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein\n\noverstate the “problem” with red thread and that Dr. Brookstein’s conclusion that Zylon should\n\n\n\n       16      This also appears to be one of the bases for excluding Opinion Three, which the\nUnited States does not directly address in its briefing.\n\n\n                                                  46\n\fnever have been sold is incorrect. Nowak Report at 21. He opines that quality control personnel\n\n“constantly monitor the process to catch any irregularities in production.” Id. The United States\n\nseeks to exclude this opinion on the ground that Dr. Nowak’s opinions about Toyobo’s quality\n\ncontrol for red thread are speculative because he did not about how the quality control processes\n\nfunctioned. The Court agrees. Dr. Nowak has not established that his testimony regarding\n\nToyobo’s quality control procedures is based on anything other than his review of internal\n\nToyobo documents rather than specialized expertise. The Court therefore will exclude Opinion\n\nTwelve.\n\n                                       C. Herbert Heuchert\n\n                Herbert Heuchert is a consultant proffered by Toyobo as an expert in the\n\nmanufacture of “safety-related products.” Mr. Heuchert has over thirty years of manufacturing\n\nexperience in the tire industry. Heuchert Opp. at 3-5. Between 1960 and 1993, Mr. Heuchert\n\nworked for Uniroyal Goodrich, a tire manufacturer, where he served variously as an industrial\n\nengineer, vice president of engineering and process development, and senior vice president of\n\noperations. While employed at Uniroyal, Mr. Heuchert oversaw the manufacture of rubber and\n\nother raw materials used in tires, fire protection gear, and other products. Id. at 4, 9-10. Mr.\n\nHeuchert was also responsible for evaluating the suitability of high-performance fibers like\n\nKevlar for use in tires and implementing quality control systems at multiple tire manufacturing\n\nplants and rubber suppliers. Id. at 4-5, 10-11. Since leaving Uniroyal in 1993, Mr. Heuchert has\n\nmanaged his own consulting company that provides manufacturing and quality control expertise\n\nprimarily in the tire industry. Id.\n\n                Mr. Heuchert has submitted an affirmative report dated March 15, 2012 and a\n\nrebuttal report dated May 23, 2012 in response to one of the United States’ experts, Dr. David S.\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\fBrookstein. The United States has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 379] to exclude Mr. Heuchert’s\n\nproffered opinions in their entirety, a motion which Toyobo opposes. 17\n\n               Mr. Heuchert’s proffered opinions focus on the respective roles and\n\nresponsibilities of Toyobo and body armor manufacturers as participants in a supply chain\n\nwherein Toyobo provided the raw material (Zylon) to the end-use manufacturers (Second\n\nChance and other body armor manufacturers) for use in bulletproof vests. Mr. Heuchert\n\nconcludes that Toyobo met its duties and obligations as a supplier of raw material and that body\n\narmor manufacturers and Toyobo employed appropriate quality control procedures. March 2012\n\nReport, Heuchert Motion Ex. 1 at 4-5 [Dkt. No. 379-1]. In his rebuttal report, Mr. Heuchert\n\nresponds to Dr. Brookstein’s criticisms of Zylon fiber and Toyobo’s manufacturing process by\n\nopining that “the design and assembly stages of end product development are when the\n\nsensitivities and vulnerabilities of raw materials should be examined and the measures taken to\n\nprotect against those sensitivities,” and that Toyobo implemented appropriate quality control\n\nprocedures to identify and isolate defective Zylon fiber. May 2012 Rebuttal Report, Heuchert\n\nMot. Ex. 3 at 4, 8 [Dkt. No. 379-1].\n\n               The United States seeks to exclude Mr. Heuchert’s opinions as unreliable and\n\nirrelevant because his experience is limited to the tire industry. Heuchert Mot. at 7. According\n\nto the United States, Mr. Heuchert has not shown how his experience – limited to the tire\n\nindustry – applies to the manufacture of high-performance fibers used in the ballistics industry.\n\nId. at 10, 15. The United States also contends that Mr. Heuchert has failed to explain how the\n\nduties and expectations of Uniroyal, a tire manufacturer that conducts its own testing of raw\n\n\n       17    The parties have withdrawn their arguments related to Second Chance’s\ncommercial warranty. See Joint Submission Regarding Previously Filed Daubert Motions [Dkt.\nNo. 456].\n\n\n                                                48\n\fmaterials incorporated into its tires, are comparable to those of Toyobo or Second Chance in\n\nterms of designing, testing, and manufacturing Zylon for use in bulletproof vests. Id. at 9, 13-15.\n\n                Toyobo takes a broader view of Mr. Heuchert’s expertise. Toyobo acknowledges\n\nthat Mr. Heuchert is not an expert in the ballistics industry but maintains that he has relevant\n\nexpertise by virtue of his experience as an end-product manufacturer and a raw material supplier\n\nin the “safety-related industry.” Heuchert Opp. 1, 12. Toyobo explains that Mr. Heuchert also\n\nhas extensive experience with the development, implementation, and ongoing supervision of\n\nquality control management systems at multiple raw materials and safety-related end-product\n\nmanufacturing plants. Id. at 1. According to Toyobo, Mr. Heuchert’s opinions on\n\nmanufacturing standards and quality control processes would aid the jury in understanding the\n\nrelationship between a raw material supplier and an end-product manufacturer in a “safety-\n\nrelated industry.” Id. at 2, 17.\n\n                The Court finds that Mr. Heuchert’s opinions are neither reliable nor relevant.\n\nMr. Heuchert bases his opinions exclusively on his extensive manufacturing and consulting\n\nexperience in the tire industry. Mr. Heuchert fails, however, to explain how his experience in the\n\ntire industry supports his opinions about the manufacture of high-performance fibers in the\n\nballistics industry or how these industries are comparable. See Arias v. DynCorp., 928 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 10, 15-16 (D.D.C. 2013) (holding that an expert witness relying solely or primarily on his\n\nor her experience to form the basis of his or her opinions must explain “how that experience\n\nleads to the conclusions reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion and\n\nhow that experience is reliably applied to the facts” (quoting FED. R. EVID. 702 advisory\n\ncommittee notes)). While safety may be a significant concern in both industries, it is hardly\n\nadequate to say that “[t]ires, like bullet resistant vests, are safety-critical products.” Opp. at 3-4.\n\n\n\n                                                  49\n\fMr. Heuchert has not explained whether or how practices of the tire industry apply to the\n\nballistics industry. See McClain v. Metabolife Int’l, Inc., 401 F.3d 1233, 1244-45 (11th Cir.\n\n2005) (reversing district court’s admission of expert testimony where witness could not\n\ndemonstrate that the drug at issue and the drug that the expert had knowledge of acted in the\n\nsame manner). Moreover, Mr. Heuchert does not cite any accepted industry standards or\n\nrelevant articles in either of his reports, relying instead solely on documents and testimony from\n\nthis case.\n\n               Toyobo attempts to furnish the missing link between Mr. Heuchert’s tire industry\n\nexperience and his opinions regarding the ballistics industry through a chart matching the topics\n\non which he opined to his experience. See Heuchert Opp. Ex. 5 [Dkt. No. 394-6]. The chart,\n\nhowever, only further demonstrates the gap between Mr. Heuchert’s experience and his proffered\n\nopinions. For instance, in support of his opinion that end-product manufacturers are responsible\n\nfor durability testing, Toyobo cites Mr. Heuchert’s “experience as both a raw material supplier\n\nand end product manufacturer.” Heuchert Opp. Ex. 5 at 2 [Dkt. No. 394-6]. This assertion\n\nmerely reinforces the fact that Mr. Heuchert has not explained whether or how standards in the\n\ntire industry may be applied to the ballistics industry.\n\n               Similarly, Mr. Heuchert has not shown how his opinions about conduct in the tire\n\nindustry are relevant to manufacturing fiber for ballistic use. His proffered opinions would not\n\naid the jury in assessing the responsibility of suppliers and manufacturers in the industry at issue.\n\nIndeed, his opinions would risk confusing the jury regarding the standards applicable to the body\n\narmor industry. Mr. Heuchert offers opinions about standards generally applicable to the\n\n“safety-related industry” without any experience working in or studying the particular industry at\n\nissue – fibers manufactured for ballistic use. See, e.g., SEC v. Tourre, 950 F. Supp. 2d 666, 674-\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\f75 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (excluding expert with expertise in “general area of structured finance,” but\n\nno experience in particular industry of collateralized debt obligations).\n\n               In sum, Mr. Heuchert has not worked in the ballistics industry and is not an expert\n\nin the field of fiber science or ballistics. His expertise in “safety-related products” is so broad a\n\ncategory as to be meaningless. The Court therefore will exclude Mr. Heuchert’s opinions in their\n\nentirety.\n\n                                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons set forth in this Opinion, the Court will admit certain opinions and\n\ntestimony offered by the parties’ expert witnesses and exclude others. Counsel shall prepare\n\ntheir experts to avoid the excluded subject matter.

EXPERTS PROFFERED BY THE UNITED STATES\n\n                Toyobo moves to exclude the opinions and testimony of seven experts proffered\n\nby the United States: (1) Dr. S. Leigh Phoenix; (2) Dr. Alan J. Lesser; (3) Dr. David S.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fBrookstein; (4) Dr. Michael A. Riley; (5) Kirk Rice; (6) Joseph T. Anastasi; and (7) Dr. A.S.\n\nAbhiraman. The Court notes at the outset that the rulings set forth in this Opinion pertain to the\n\nexpert reports filed in this action, United States ex rel. Westrick v. Second Chance Body Armor,\n\nInc. (Civil Action No. 04-0280), and not the related action, United States v. Toyobo Co., Ltd.\n\n(Civil Action No. 07-1144). In addition, the portions of the pending motions relating to Dr.\n\nAllen L. Price and Dr. Bradley S. Field are now moot, as Toyobo has withdrawn its designations\n\nof those two proffered experts. See Joint Report re: Daubert Hearings [Dkt. No. 503].\n\nSeparately, in response to the Court’s summary judgment rulings on September 4, 2015, see\n\nUnited States ex rel. Westrick v. Second Chance Body Armor, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C.\n\n2015), the parties have withdrawn their arguments related to the commercial warranty provided\n\nby Second Chance Body Armor, Inc. (“Second Chance”). See Joint Submission Regarding\n\nPreviously Filed Daubert Motions [Dkt. No. 456].\n\n\n                                    A. Dr. S. Leigh Phoenix\n\n               Dr. S. Leigh Phoenix is a tenured professor of mechanical and aerospace\n\nengineering at Cornell University proffered by the United States to opine on the relationship\n\nbetween fiber properties and ballistic performance. Dr. Phoenix holds a Doctorate in Theoretical\n\nand Applied Mechanics from Cornell University. See March 2012 Report, Phoenix Mot. Ex. 1 at\n\n1 (“Phoenix Report”) [Dkt. No. 382-3]. His primary areas of research include the ballistic\n\nimpact of fibrous structures, statistical and micromechanical modeling, and fracture mechanics\n\nand fatigue modeling in metals. Id. Dr. Phoenix has authored over one hundred peer-reviewed\n\narticles, including four articles on ballistic modeling. See Phoenix Opp. at 3.\n\n               Dr. Phoenix has submitted three expert reports in this case: (i) an affirmative\n\nreport dated March 15, 2012; (ii) a supplemental report dated October 3, 2012, submitted in\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fresponse to one of Toyobo’s proffered experts, Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki; and (iii) a declaration\n\ndated May 15, 2013. 2 Toyobo has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 382] to exclude Dr. Phoenix’s\n\nopinions in their entirety, a motion which the United States opposes. While the parties agree that\n\nDr. Phoenix is qualified to opine on properties of Zylon fiber, they disagree over whether Dr.\n\nPhoenix may reliably opine on fiber properties as they relate to ballistic applications and\n\nToyobo’s disclosures to body armor manufacturers. The Court therefore will focus its analysis\n\non the reliability and fit of Dr. Phoenix’s proffered opinions.\n\n\n                                  1. Opinions Regarding Ballistics\n\n               Dr. Phoenix opines that fiber tensile strength is a critical factor in determining the\n\nballistic performance of body armor: if fiber tensile strength decreases by a significant amount,\n\nso too will the ballistic performance of that fiber. See Phoenix Report at 5-6. Toyobo seeks to\n\nexclude this opinion and Dr. Phoenix’s other opinions regarding ballistics on the grounds that\n\nthey are not reliable, will not assist the jury in deciding the issues in this case, and would invade\n\nthe province of the jury. Phoenix Mot. at 10.\n\n               Toyobo argues that Dr. Phoenix relied solely on mathematical models and did not\n\nconduct any tests using “real bullets” to ensure that his models accurately predict the real-life\n\nperformance of Zylon fiber incorporated into a bulletproof vest. Phoenix Mot. at 4. Toyobo\n\nfurther asserts that Dr. Phoenix’s ballistic models apply to only a subset of the bulletproof vests\n\nat issue, ignore the effects of vest design and construction, are not used to design or test body\n\narmor, and do not accurately predict the results of ballistic testing done by Second Chance on its\n\nused Zylon vests. Id. at 10-14. In addition, Toyobo contends that Dr. Phoenix has neither\n\n\n       2       Dr. Phoenix has also submitted a rebuttal report dated May 23, 2012 in response\nto Dr. Allen Price and Dr. Field who, as noted, have been withdrawn.\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fdesigned nor manufactured bulletproof vests and thus lacks relevant professional experience to\n\nsupport his conclusions regarding ballistic performance. Id. at 14. Permitting Dr. Phoenix’s\n\ntestimony under these circumstances, Toyobo argues, would be unfairly prejudicial to Toyobo.\n\nId.\n\n               The Court disagrees. Dr. Phoenix’s opinions regarding ballistics and ballistic\n\nperformance are based on a sound methodology and would aid the jury in evaluating the\n\nsuitability of Zylon for use in bulletproof vests. Dr. Phoenix used his expertise in fiber\n\nproperties and ballistic modeling to analyze Toyobo’s testing data measuring the tensile strength\n\nof Zylon fiber over time. See, e.g., Phoenix Report at 6-10. Dr. Phoenix’s ballistic impact\n\nmodeling is generally accepted science that has been cited forty-nine times in peer-reviewed\n\narticles. Phoenix Opp. at 13. Dr. Phoenix need not have experience designing or manufacturing\n\nbulletproof vests to reliably assess the behavior of Zylon fiber incorporated into bulletproof vests\n\nusing peer-reviewed ballistic modeling. Furthermore, Toyobo’s concerns over the lack of\n\nballistic testing using “real bullets” or the limits of Dr. Phoenix’s ballistic models go to the\n\nweight to be accorded to his testimony and not its admissibility under Daubert or Rule 702. See\n\nRobinson v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (D.D.C. 2014). The Court therefore\n\nwill admit Dr. Phoenix’s proffered opinions regarding ballistics and ballistic performance.\n\n               Separately, Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Phoenix’s opinion that Second Chance’s\n\nused-vest testing showed that some Zylon vests would fall below the standards set by the\n\nNational Institute of Justice (“NIJ”) before five years. Phoenix Mot. at 15-16; Phoenix Report at\n\n42. Toyobo characterizes this opinion as pertaining to “the durability of Second Chance’s Zylon\n\nvests.” Phoenix Mot. at 15. The United States responds that Dr. Phoenix does not offer an\n\nopinion on the durability of Second Chance vests, but rather questions Second Chance’s\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\finterpretation of its used-vest testing data. Phoenix Opp. at 29-30. Based on Dr. Phoenix’s\n\nreport and his deposition testimony, however, it appears that Dr. Phoenix does indeed offer an\n\nopinion that “one can crudely estimate [that] some vests would likely fall below the NIJ standard\n\nwell before 5 years . . . .” See Phoenix Report at 42; 01/17/13 Phoenix Dep. at 913:16-915:8\n\n[Dkt. No. 382-15]. Because this opinion is admittedly based on a “crude” estimate, the Court\n\nwill exclude it.\n\n                              2. Opinions Regarding Toyobo’s Disclosures\n\n                   In 2001, Toyobo periodically tested the strength retention of thirteen spools of\n\nZylon fiber that had been continuously exposed to conditions of 40°C and 80% relative\n\nhumidity. Toyobo then disclosed the results of that testing to body armor manufacturers and\n\nothers in the body armor industry. Dr. Phoenix opines that Toyobo’s disclosures were improper\n\nfor several reasons: (i) Toyobo “suppressed” the fact that each spool had a different level of\n\nstrength retention by disclosing averaged data rather than raw data for each spool; (ii) Toyobo\n\nselected spools with higher “Na/P ratios” in order to boost the results of the fiber strength testing;\n\n(iii) Toyobo deleted outlier data points; and (iv) Toyobo delayed the disclosure of its testing data.\n\n                   Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Phoenix’s opinions about Toyobo’s disclosures for\n\ntwo main reasons. First, Toyobo asserts that Dr. Phoenix’s opinions about the impact of the\n\ndisclosures on the body armor industry are based on speculation rather than on reliable principles\n\nor accepted data-reporting standards in the fiber and ballistics industries. Phoenix Mot. at 18-20.\n\nToyobo argues that Dr. Phoenix does not know what body armor manufacturers did with the\n\ninformation from Toyobo, whether they were misled, what expectations they had of Toyobo,\n\nwhether they asked to receive raw data for each spool of Zylon, or what information they found\n\nimportant. Id. Toyobo further argues that Dr. Phoenix has not worked for a fiber supplier, has\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fnot designed a bulletproof vest, and is not familiar with the data reporting methods of fiber\n\nsuppliers. Id. Second, Toyobo contends that Dr. Phoenix’s opinions about Toyobo’s internal\n\nknowledge and motives are speculative and would invade the province of the jury. Id. at 20-21.\n\nToyobo asserts that Dr. Phoenix has no reliable basis to proffer opinions about what Toyobo\n\nknew or intended when it conducted its testing and disclosed data to the body armor industry. Id.\n\n               The Court will admit certain portions of Dr. Phoenix’s proffered opinions and\n\nexclude others. Dr. Phoenix’s methodology is reliable insofar as he used his expertise in fiber\n\nproperties to compare Toyobo’s internal testing data to the representations made in its\n\ndisclosures. Dr. Phoenix need not have experience as a fiber supplier or in bulletproof vest\n\ndesign to reliably interpret Toyobo’s data generated from testing Zylon fiber. Due to the\n\ntechnical nature of Toyobo’s data and disclosures, Dr. Phoenix’s opinions would aid the jury in\n\nevaluating whether Toyobo’s disclosures were misleading. The Court therefore will admit Dr.\n\nPhoenix’s opinions comparing Toyobo’s testing data to the data presented in its disclosures and\n\nexplaining how a reasonable person would have interpreted the disclosures. See In re Rail\n\nFreight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., No. 07-mc-0489, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5311533</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *40 n.25\n\n(D.D.C. Nov. 13, 2017) (admitting expert’s opinion that defendants’ behavior was consistent\n\nwith collusion but excluding his opinion that defendants intended to collude). For instance, Dr.\n\nPhoenix may explain the results of Toyobo’s testing, describe what information Toyobo did or\n\ndid not disclose (e.g., reporting averaged data rather than raw data and removing certain data\n\npoints), opine on whether and why certain spools of Zylon fiber performed better than others,\n\nand describe the amount of time between disclosures.\n\n               The Court will exclude, however, opinions regarding Toyobo’s knowledge or\n\nintentions with respect to its disclosures to body armor manufacturers. Such testimony would be\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\ftoo speculative to satisfy the reliability threshold of Rule 702 and would touch upon the ultimate\n\nissue for the jury of whether Toyobo’s disclosures were misleading. See SEC v. Johnson, 525 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 70, 78-79 (D.D.C. 2007) (excluding expert’s opinion that employees intended to\n\ndeceive auditors and that defendants misled auditors). Specifically, Dr. Phoenix will not be\n\npermitted to opine on what Toyobo knew about Zylon degradation, why Toyobo made the\n\ndecision to test certain spools over others, why Toyobo chose to disclose or withhold certain\n\ndata, why Toyobo chose to present certain data in the manner that it did, or whether Toyobo was\n\nmotivated by business or other concerns. See Sykes v. Napolitano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2571268\"><a href=\"/opinion/2571268/sykes-v-napolitano/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Liab. Litig., 889 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1272, 1287 (N.D. Ala. 2012) (excluding expert testimony as to what defendant “knew”\n\nor that defendant “misled” the FDA, but admitting testimony as to what information defendant\n\nprovided to the FDA).\n\n               Relatedly, the Court will exclude bald assertions based on the documentary record\n\nregarding Toyobo’s intent or motivations. Dr. Phoenix includes these statements in some of his\n\ndiscussion of the documentary record and Toyobo’s testing. See, e.g., Phoenix Report at 12\n\n(“Documents show . . . [that] there was marketing pressure to increase the production speed [of\n\nspools of Zylon fiber].”). The jury is competent to read and interpret the evidence without Dr.\n\nPhoenix’s proffered opinions. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">5311533</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *21 (holding that “an economist’s testimony is not admissible where he or she\n\nsimply reads and interprets evidence of collusion as any juror might, or where an economist\n\ninfers intent to collude from mere documentary evidence, unrelated to his or her economic\n\nexpertise”).\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f                 For similar reasons, the Court will exclude portions of Dr. Phoenix’s opinions\n\nregarding whether body armor manufacturers were misled by Toyobo’s disclosures, what\n\ninformation should have been conveyed to body armor manufacturers, and what information was\n\nimportant to body armor manufacturers. Dr. Phoenix’s expertise in fiber properties and ballistic\n\nmodeling does not support his opinions on norms governing the disclosure of testing data within\n\nthe body armor industry.\n\n\n                          3. Opinions in Response to Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki\n\n                 Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Phoenix’s opinions provided in response to one of\n\nToyobo’s proffered experts, Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki. Dr. Phoenix and Dr. Yabuki disagree over\n\nthe relationship between “Na/P ratio” and the strength retention of Zylon. In Dr. Phoenix’s\n\nopinion, Na/P ratio is an important indicator of how quickly Zylon fiber will degrade due to\n\nexposure to heat and humidity. See October 2012 Report, Phoenix Mot. Ex. 3 at 5-6 [Dkt. No.\n\n382-5]. Dr. Phoenix opines that Dr. Yabuki incorrectly concludes that there is a weak correlation\n\nbetween Na/P ratio and Zylon degradation. Toyobo argues that Dr. Phoenix is not a polymer\n\nchemist and thus lacks relevant experience, training, or education to reliably opine on the\n\nrelationship between Na/P ratio and strength retention. Phoenix Mot. at 23-24.\n\n                 The Court is not persuaded that Dr. Phoenix’s opinion and testimony on this topic\n\nshould be excluded. Dr. Phoenix employed a reliable methodology by using his expertise in\n\nmathematical modeling to compare Toyobo’s testing data tracking the Na/P ratio and strength\n\nretention of various samples of Zylon fiber tested under conditions of 40°C and 80% relative\n\nhumidity. Dr. Phoenix need not be a polymer chemist to perform this type of data analysis. Dr.\n\nPhoenix’s opinions proffered in response to Dr. Yabuki therefore will be admitted for the jury’s\n\nconsideration.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f                                      B. Dr. Alan J. Lesser\n\n               Dr. Alan J. Lesser is a tenured professor of polymer science at the University of\n\nMassachusetts, Amherst proffered by the United States as an expert in fiber properties and\n\nballistic performance. Dr. Lesser holds a Doctorate in Civil Engineering from Case Western\n\nReserve University and worked as a research scientist in the Polymeric Materials Department for\n\nShell Development Company prior to entering academia. March 2012 Report, Lesser Mot. Ex. 1\n\nat 1 and Appendix A (“Lesser Report”) [Dkt. No. 374]. His research interests include fracture\n\nand adhesion of fibers and environmental stress cracking and chemical degradation of polymer-\n\nbased materials. Id. at 1. Dr. Lesser has significant research experience in polymer chemistry\n\nand fiber properties and has authored ninety-four peer-reviewed papers, including ten papers\n\ndetailing the impacts of environmental effects on the behavior of polymers and polymer-based\n\nfibers. Lesser Report at 5.\n\n               Dr. Lesser has submitted an affirmative report dated March 15, 2012 in this case.\n\nToyobo has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 374] to exclude portions of Dr. Lesser’s opinions, a motion\n\nwhich the United States opposes. The Court will address each of Toyobo’s objections in turn.\n\n\n                     1. Opinions Regarding Ballistics and Vest Performance\n\n               Dr. Lesser opines that various properties of Zylon fiber render Zylon “so\n\nmechanically and chemically fragile” that it is not suitable for use in bulletproof vests. Lesser\n\nReport at 19. According to Toyobo, this opinion and Dr. Lesser’s other opinions related to\n\nballistic performance are unreliable because he lacks relevant ballistics experience – including\n\ndesigning, manufacturing, or testing bulletproof vests – and did not conduct ballistic testing to\n\nconfirm that his opinions accurately reflect the behavior of Zylon fiber incorporated into a\n\nbulletproof vest. Lesser Mot. at 7. Toyobo also contends that Dr. Lesser merely parrots a model\n\n\n                                                12\n\fof ballistic performance developed by another United States expert, Phillip M. Cunniff, that is\n\nintended to be used in conjunction with ballistic testing. Id. at 7-9.\n\n               The Court will admit Dr. Lesser’s opinions regarding ballistic performance and\n\nthe suitability of Zylon for use in bulletproof vests. Dr. Lesser is qualified to offer opinions on\n\nthese topics based on his experience studying and working with fibers and ballistic impact\n\nmodels. He reached his opinions through a reliable methodology, in which he applied his\n\nknowledge of fiber properties to assess Toyobo’s degradation data using the Cunniff model of\n\nballistic performance. See, e.g., Lesser Report at 7-9. The Cunniff model – which predicts the\n\nperformance of soft body armor based on alterations in various fiber properties – has been peer-\n\nreviewed and is generally accepted in the scientific community. Id. at 8. Dr. Lesser’s opinions\n\non the properties of fibers and their impact on ballistic performance would assist the jury in\n\nassessing the suitability of Zylon fiber for use in bulletproof vests.\n\n               Contrary to Toyobo’s assertion, Dr. Lesser does not merely parrot the Cunniff\n\nmodel, but rather applies his own expertise to compare the results of the Cunniff model against\n\nother ballistic models to measure ballistic performance.

Lesser Mot. at 15-19. Dr. Lesser opines\n\nthat Toyobo presented data that overestimated Zylon’s strength retention, made inappropriate\n\npredictions about service life, continually altered the manner in which it presented data, used\n\nmetrics that misled customers with respect to durability, and misrepresented data by removing\n\ndata points from graphs sent to manufacturers. Lesser Report at 20-28. Toyobo argues that these\n\nopinions are speculative because Dr. Lesser does not know what information body armor\n\nmanufacturers sought or expected from Toyobo or how they interpreted the disclosures. Lesser\n\nMot. at 15-19. In addition, Toyobo asserts that opining on the effect of the disclosures on the\n\nbody armor industry is speculative and would invade the province of the jury. Lesser Reply at\n\n10-12.\n\n               For the same reasons discussed in connection with Dr. Phoenix, the Court will\n\nadmit certain portions of Dr. Lesser’s proffered opinion and exclude others. Dr. Lesser’s\n\nmethodology is reliable insofar as he uses his expertise in polymer science and fiber properties to\n\ncompare Toyobo’s internal testing data to the representations made in its disclosures. Dr. Lesser\n\nneed not have experience as a fiber supplier or in bulletproof vest design to reliably interpret\n\nToyobo’s data generated from testing Zylon fiber. Dr. Lesser’s comparisons would assist the\n\njury in evaluating, inter alia, whether Toyobo’s disclosures regarding its fiber testing results were\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fmisleading. The Court therefore will admit Dr. Lesser’s opinions comparing Toyobo’s testing\n\ndata to the data presented in its disclosures and explaining how a reasonable person would have\n\ninterpreted the disclosures. For instance, Dr. Lesser may describe the results of Toyobo’s\n\ntesting, the information that Toyobo did or did not disclose, and the manner in which the data\n\nwas presented. See, e.g., Lesser Report at 28 (“Each of these [alterations in the way the data was\n\npresented] make it difficult for customers to independently evaluate appropriate service life of\n\nproducts based on strength retention.”).\n\n               The Court will exclude, however, opinions regarding Toyobo’s knowledge or\n\nintentions with respect to its disclosures to body armor manufacturers. Such testimony would be\n\nbased on unsupported speculation and would invade the province of the jury. In particular, Dr.\n\nLesser will not be permitted to opine on what Toyobo knew about Zylon degradation at a given\n\ntime, why Toyobo chose to disclose or withhold certain data, why Toyobo chose to present\n\ncertain data in the manner that it did, or whether Toyobo was motivated by business or other\n\ninterests.\n\n               The Court will also exclude bald conclusions based on the documentary record\n\nregarding Toyobo’s intent or motivations or other topics beyond the scope of Dr. Lesser’s\n\nexpertise. For example, Dr. Lesser opines that “[t]he pressure from the business and sales part\n\nof . . . Toyobo’s organization over this period of time caused considerable tension between the\n\nvarious individuals and groups in the company” and that “numerous internal documents from\n\nToyobo support the immense difficulty they incurred while trying to neutralize the residual PPA\n\nin Zylon AS fiber.” Lesser Report at 17. This will not be permitted. The jury is competent to\n\nread and interpret the evidence relevant to these topics without Dr. Lesser’s proffered opinions.\n\nAs another example, Dr. Lesser provides opinions on Toyobo’s quality control procedures, but\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fhas not established any specialized expertise in quality control procedures beyond reading\n\ninternal Toyobo documents: “[S]ince Toyobo has no methods in place to control this\n\nconcentration at the time of delivery to their customers, they have no way to insure that any of\n\ntheir products meet their own specifications.” Id. at 13; see id. at 17 (“This becomes particularly\n\ncritical since simply identifying a product as ‘red’ is too subjective and cannot be used as a\n\ncriterion for quality control.”). The Court therefore will exclude this type of proffered testimony.\n\n                 For similar reasons, the Court will exclude Dr. Lesser’s opinions regarding\n\nwhether body armor manufacturers were misled by Toyobo’s disclosures, what information\n\nshould have been conveyed to body armor manufacturers, and what information was important to\n\nbody armor manufacturers. See, e.g., Lesser Report at 20 (“Toyobo communicated misleading\n\nresults to customers.”). Dr. Lesser’s expertise in polymer science and fiber properties does not\n\nsupport his opinions on norms applicable to the disclosure of testing data within the fiber and\n\nballistics industries.\n\n\n                                    C. Dr. David S. Brookstein\n\n                 Dr. David S. Brookstein has a Bachelor’s Degree in Textile Engineering from the\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology, and both a Master of Science Degree in Textile Technology and\n\na Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nBrookstein Opp. at 4. From 1994 to 2010, he served as the Dean of the School of Engineering\n\nand Textiles at Philadelphia University and a professor of engineering. Id. Prior to that time, Dr.\n\nBrookstein spent fourteen years as the Associate Director of the Albany International Research\n\nCompany, a commercial research laboratory where he conducted a wide range of research and\n\ndevelopment projects involving high-performance fibers such as Kevlar. See March 15, 2012\n\nReport, Brookstein Mot. Ex. 1 at 1 (“Brookstein Report”) [Dkt. No. 384-3].\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f               Dr. Brookstein has submitted one affirmative expert report dated March 15,\n\n2012. 3 Toyobo seeks to exclude Dr. Brookstein’s testimony that Zylon is unsuitable for use in\n\nballistic applications. Brookstein Mot. at 8. According to Toyobo, Dr. Brookstein’s\n\nmethodology is not reliable because he lacks expertise in ballistics – including vest design,\n\nconstruction, or manufacturing – and has not conducted ballistic testing to confirm how Zylon\n\nfiber behaves once it is incorporated into a bulletproof vest. Id. at 9; Brookstein Reply at 4-7. In\n\naddition, Toyobo asserts that Dr. Brookstein could not pinpoint what makes Zylon defective or\n\nexplain why other fibers that have kink bands and undergo hydrolysis are not similarly defective.\n\nBrookstein Mot. at 12-13. Toyobo also urges the Court to exclude Dr. Brookstein’s opinions\n\nabout Toyobo’s manufacturing, quality assurance, and quality control processes, Brookstein Mot.\n\nat 14-18, and his opinion that Toyobo misled the body armor industry. Id. at 19-21.\n\n               After reviewing his expert report, the Court has questions about Dr. Brookstein’s\n\nmethodology and the bases for many of his opinions and conclusions. Beyond that, many of his\n\nobservations are conclusory or speculative, clearly are not proper for testimony by an expert,\n\nintrude upon the function of the jury, attribute motives to Toyobo that are beyond his ken, or are\n\npejorative in tone (e.g., that “Toyobo was derelict” and the manufacturing process “was out of\n\ncontrol”). His chart of “what Toyobo knew and when it first knew it regarding the strength\n\nretention of Zylon fiber used in the ballistics industry,” Brookstein Report at 54-56, clearly is\n\nbeyond the pale. Furthermore, many of Dr. Brookstein’s opinions regarding Toyobo’s\n\n\n\n       3        Dr. Brookstein has also submitted a supplemental report dated May 23, 2012 in\nresponse to Dr. Price and Dr. Field who, as noted, have been withdrawn. The supplemental\nreport also responds to opinions offered by a third Toyobo expert, Herbert Heuchert. Because\nthe Court will exclude Mr. Heuchert’s testimony, infra at 47-51, the Court need not address the\nportions of Dr. Brookstein’s May 23, 2012 supplemental report pertaining to Mr. Heuchert’s\nproffered opinions.\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fdisclosures are not admissible for the same reasons explained with respect to Dr. Phoenix and\n\nDr. Lesser.\n\n                Should the United States still wish to offer Dr. Brookstein as an expert witness for\n\nlimited purposes, it should indicate in writing which opinions it still seeks to offer at trial, after\n\nwhich the Court will hear testimony from Dr. Brookstein at a further Daubert hearing in advance\n\nof trial.\n\n\n                                      D. Dr. Michael A. Riley\n\n                Dr. Michael A. Riley is a body armor researcher proffered by the United States as\n\nan expert in ballistic testing and ballistic performance of Zylon body armor. Because Dr. Riley\n\nis neither a retained expert nor an individual whose duties regularly involve giving expert\n\ntestimony, he did not provide an expert report but rather provided a letter summarizing his\n\nqualifications and affirmative expert opinions. See FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a)(2)(C).\n\n                Dr. Riley holds a Doctorate in Civil Engineering from the State University of\n\nNew York at Buffalo. Riley Opp. at 4. He joined the National Institute of Standards and\n\nTechnology (“NIST”) in 1997 and currently serves as the Program Manager for Test and\n\nEvaluation in the Protective Systems Research Group of the Office of Law Enforcement\n\nStandards. Id. at 3-4. In that capacity, Dr. Riley oversees ballistic testing of body armor,\n\ndevelops proficiency tests for ballistic armor testing laboratories, and assesses commercial\n\nlaboratories’ abilities to perform body armor testing. Id. at 3. He also advises the NIJ on the\n\ndevelopment of new body armor standards. Id. In addition, Dr. Riley helped revise the NIJ\n\nStandard for testing law enforcement body armor and evaluate the safety of Zylon vests in the\n\nfield. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f                Toyobo has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 380] to exclude only the following opinion\n\nproffered by Dr. Riley: “Fiber suppliers such as Toyobo Co. should provide a product to\n\nweavers and body armor manufacturers that is consistent with purchasing specifications –\n\nincluding documentation about normal production variations, how the material ages, and factors\n\nthat influence aging – and does not significantly change from those purchasing specifications\n\nover warranty periods of active use.” November 9, 2012 Affirmative Opinions Letter, Riley\n\nMot. Ex. 4 at 2 (Opinion Six) [Dkt. No. 380-6]. 4\n\n                Toyobo argues that Dr. Riley is not qualified and has no reliable basis to opine on\n\nthe relationship between a fiber supplier and a weaver or body armor manufacturer, or the duties\n\nallegedly owed by a fiber supplier. Riley Mot. at 8. Toyobo contends that Dr. Riley fails to\n\nexplain how his research and experience in Zylon degradation and fiber properties qualify him to\n\nopine on the type of information a fiber supplier should provide in purchasing specifications.\n\nRiley Reply at 11-14. According to Toyobo, Dr. Riley has had no conversations with body\n\narmor manufacturers or weavers about what information they expect to receive from fiber\n\nsuppliers in purchasing specifications; has neither worked for fiber suppliers, weavers or body\n\narmor manufacturers, nor designed a bulletproof vest; has not seen a Zylon weaver’s purchasing\n\nspecifications for Zylon fiber; and is not aware of purchasing specifications that require the type\n\nof information that Dr. Riley opines Toyobo and other fiber suppliers should provide. Riley\n\nMot. at 8-10. Toyobo points out that although Dr. Riley has spoken to three fiber suppliers, he\n\nhas little information about how fiber suppliers and body armor manufacturers worked together\n\nprior to 2005, the period relevant to this case. Id. at 9.\n\n\n        4      Toyobo has also moved to exclude another opinion offered by Dr. Riley\npertaining to Second Chance’s commercial warranty, which is no longer at issue. See Joint\nSubmission Regarding Previously Filed Daubert Motions [Dkt. No. 456].\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f               The Court is not persuaded that this opinion should be excluded. As the project\n\nmanager responsible for overseeing ballistic testing of law enforcement body armor on behalf of\n\nthe United States, Dr. Riley is qualified to opine on whether fiber suppliers should provide a\n\nproduct that meets its purchasing specifications. Dr. Riley has experience using Zylon fiber\n\nspecifications to study the effect of aging on Zylon and determining when a product fails to meet\n\nits purchasing specifications. As for his experience working with fiber suppliers, Dr. Riley has\n\nhad “extensive discussions with some fiber suppliers and [he has] spent a great deal of time\n\nlooking through some of their literature to understand what’s provided.” 03/12/13 Riley Dep. at\n\n879:4-13 [Dkt. No. 400-2]. Dr. Riley has also spoken with procurement officials whose jobs are\n\nto purchase armor for officers in their agencies. Riley Reply Ex. 5 at 4. Toyobo’s arguments\n\nthat those conversations occurred after the time period at issue here and did not involve\n\npurchasing specifications go to the weight of Dr. Riley’s opinion and not its admissibility.\n\n               In addition, the Court concludes that Dr. Riley’s knowledge and experience as a\n\nresearcher in the field of safety standards provides a sound basis for his opinion. At his\n\ndeposition, Dr. Riley explained that he based his opinion on literature related to fiber suppliers\n\nand discussions with three fiber suppliers. Furthermore, rather than opining that Toyobo failed\n\nto meet a particular requirement or satisfy a legal duty, Dr. Riley opines that fiber suppliers\n\nshould provide a product that is consistent with purchasing specifications and remains so over a\n\ngiven period of time. That Dr. Riley has never worked for a fiber supplier, bulletproof vest\n\nmanufacturer, or weaver goes to weight and not admissibility. In addition, it appears that\n\nToyobo largely agrees with Dr. Riley on this point and that its disagreement concerns the scope\n\nof Dr. Riley’s opinion. See Riley Reply at 11 n.28 (“Toyobo largely agrees” with the\n\nproposition that “fiber manufacturers should provide a product consistent with its purchasing\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fspecifications. . . .”). The Court therefore will admit Dr. Riley’s opinion regarding purchasing\n\nspecifications.\n\n\n                                            E. Kirk Rice\n\n                  Kirk Rice is a body armor researcher proffered by the United States as an expert\n\nin ballistic testing and ballistic performance of Zylon body armor. Because Mr. Rice is neither a\n\nretained expert nor an individual whose duties regularly involve giving expert testimony, he did\n\nnot provide an expert report but rather provided a letter summarizing his qualifications and\n\naffirmative expert opinions. See FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a)(2)(C).\n\n                  Mr. Rice holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering from the\n\nUniversity of Maryland and a Master’s Degree in Engineering Administration from George\n\nWashington University. Rice Opp. at 3. Mr. Rice is the lead government scientist working on\n\nbody armor systems at NIST. His title is Supervisory Physical Scientist serving as Program\n\nManager for Protective Systems Research in the Office of Law Enforcement Standards. Id. In\n\nthat role, Mr. Rice oversees a team of engineers and chemists studying body armor and develops\n\nperformance standards and test protocols for body armor. Id. Mr. Rice is also responsible for\n\nthe introduction of the NIJ’s Stab-Resistant Body Armor Standard and Ballistic-Resistant Body\n\nArmor Standard. Rice Mot. Ex. 1 at 75. He was a key participant in establishing the formal\n\nbody armor testing laboratory accreditation program relied upon by NIJ for its compliance\n\ntesting. Id.\n\n                  Toyobo has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 381] to exclude only the following opinion\n\nproffered by Mr. Rice: “Fiber suppliers such as Toyobo Co. should provide a product to weavers\n\nand body armor manufacturers that is consistent with purchasing specifications – including\n\ndocumentation about normal production variations, how the material ages, and factors that\n\n\n                                                  21\n\finfluence aging – and does not significantly change from those purchasing specifications over\n\nwarranty periods of active use.” November 9, 2012 Affirmative Opinions Letter, Rice Mot. Ex.\n\n4 at 2 (Opinion Six) [Dkt. No. 381-6]. 5\n\n               Toyobo’s arguments largely mirror those raised in support of its motion to\n\nexclude an identical opinion proffered by Dr. Riley. Toyobo argues that Mr. Rice is not\n\nqualified and has no reliable basis to opine on the relationship between a fiber supplier and a\n\nweaver or body armor manufacturer, or the duties allegedly owed by a fiber supplier. Rice Mot.\n\nat 1. Toyobo contends that Mr. Rice has only a general, academic understanding of the types of\n\nmaterial used by body armor manufacturers, rather than real-world experience. Id. at 7. Toyobo\n\nargues that Mr. Rice has never worked for a fiber supplier or body armor manufacturer; has\n\nnever designed, developed, or sold a bulletproof vest; has not seen a weaver’s purchasing\n\nspecification for Zylon fiber; and is not aware of any purchasing specifications that require the\n\ninformation that he opines Toyobo and other fiber suppliers should provide. Id. Toyobo further\n\nasserts that Mr. Rice did not speak to any fiber suppliers about the type of information they\n\ntypically provide to weavers and body armor manufacturers in purchasing specifications.\n\n               The Court concludes that Mr. Rice is qualified to offer this opinion and has an\n\nadequate basis for his opinion. As the lead scientist for the United States on body armor systems\n\nand standards, Mr. Rice is qualified to opine on whether fiber suppliers should provide a product\n\nthat meets its purchasing specifications. He also has significant experience with fiber\n\nspecifications. At deposition, Mr. Rice testified that his opinion is informed by his discussions\n\nwith several fiber suppliers and his involvement in fiber degradation research. Rice Opp. at 18.\n\n\n       5     Toyobo has also moved to exclude another opinion offered by Mr. Rice pertaining\nto Second Chance’s commercial warranty, which is no longer at issue. See Joint Submission\nRegarding Previously Filed Daubert Motions [Dkt. No. 456].\n\n\n                                                22\n\fToyobo’s arguments that those conversations occurred after the time period at issue here and did\n\nnot involve purchasing specifications go to weight and not admissibility. Moreover, rather than\n\nopining that Toyobo failed to meet a particular requirement or satisfy a legal duty, Mr. Rice\n\nopines that fiber suppliers should provide a product that is consistent with purchasing\n\nspecifications and that remains so over a given period of time. It appears that Toyobo largely\n\nagrees with Mr. Rice on this point and that its disagreement concerns the scope of Mr. Rice’s\n\nopinion. See Rice Reply at 11 n.30 (“Toyobo largely agrees” with the proposition that “fiber\n\nmanufacturers should provide a product consistent with its purchasing specifications . . . .”). The\n\nCourt therefore will admit Mr. Rice’s opinion regarding purchasing specifications.\n\n\n                                     F. Joseph T. Anastasi\n\n               Joseph T. Anastasi is a certified public accountant proffered by the United States\n\nas an expert witness in forensic accounting and the performance of damages analysis for matters\n\nin litigation. He has filed two expert reports in this case, one dated March 15, 2012, and the\n\nother dated September 14, 2012. In addition, by Memorandum Opinion and Order of January\n\n17, 2018, the Court permitted the United States to file a supplemental expert report of Mr.\n\nAnastasi dated December 22, 2017. See Mem. Op. and Order [Dkt. No. 514]. Toyobo has filed\n\na motion [Dkt. No. 375] to exclude the opinions and testimony of Mr. Anastasi, a motion which\n\nthe United States opposes.\n\n               Mr. Anastasi holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Accounting from\n\nPennsylvania State University. Mr. Anastasi is a managing director at the Berkeley Research\n\nGroup, a financial and economic consulting firm. He has also served variously as the Global\n\nPractice Leader for the Forensic & Investigative Service Practice at Deloitte and a Managing\n\nPartner at PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n\n                                                23\n\f                Toyobo argues that Mr. Anastasi has no basis to opine on damages in this case\n\nboth because his methodology is flawed and unreliable and because, as a matter of law, what the\n\nUnited States paid Second Chance does not answer the ultimate question of what damages the\n\nUnited States actually suffered because the product sold had more than zero value. In other\n\nwords, Toyobo contends that the United States’ expenditures or payments do not equate with\n\ndamages. Anastasi Mot. at 10. Rather, Toyobo maintains, the proper measure of damages is the\n\ndifference between the value of the goods or services actually provided and the value they would\n\nhave had if delivered as promised. Anastasi Reply at 5-6. The United States responds that\n\nMr. Anastasi is being offered as an expert witness to provide the jury with an understanding of\n\nthe vast sales data at issue in the case, his testing of that sales data, and his quantification of the\n\ndata. It maintains that the methodologies he used to analyze this massive amount of sales data\n\nwere painstaking and reliable and that his analysis would be helpful to the jury. Anastasi Opp. at\n\n17-18. As for the legal question, the United States argues that the law is clear: False Claims Act\n\ndamages in a case involving the sale of defective products is a straight-forward analysis of how\n\nmuch the United States paid for the defective product since the defect renders the product sold\n\nand delivered valueless. Anastasi Opp. at 9.\n\n                The Court has carefully reviewed Mr. Anastasi’s March 2012 and September\n\n2012 expert reports and his proffered supplemental report of December 22, 2017. In his reports,\n\nMr. Anastasi separately reviewed (1) the sales made directly by Second Chance to United States\n\nagencies through the General Services Administration (“GSA”) and (2) reimbursements made by\n\nthe United States to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies under the Bulletproof Vest\n\nPartnership Act (“BVP”). In the case of the GSA sales, Mr. Anastasi and his staff examined\n\n17,000 line items and twenty-three boxes of Second Chance sales invoices and other\n\n\n\n                                                   24\n\fdocumentation and matched spreadsheets to supporting invoices, order forms and other kinds of\n\ndocumentation. Anastasi Opp. at 1-2, 17-18. He found that the vast majority of the electronic\n\nsales records were supported by Second Chance invoices and other forms of documentation.\n\nDoing further calculations to account for instances where they did not match or where there were\n\npossible overcharges, he made corrections and calculated an amount. Id. at 17-18. With respect\n\nto the BVP reimbursements, Mr. Anastasi relied primarily on calculations done by Linda\n\nHammond-Deckard, but he then did his own analysis and calculated an amount in BVP\n\nreimbursements made by the United States to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn his September 2012 report, he engaged in random sampling techniques and corroborated the\n\nearlier analysis he had done with respect to the BVP sales. In his supplemental report of\n\nDecember 22, 2017, Mr. Anastasi provided a payments analysis – to supplement his earlier sales\n\nanalysis – with respect to orders for sales to federal agencies under GSA contracts as to which he\n\nhad already provided an analysis of sales data. 6\n\n               The Court agrees with the United States that Mr. Anastasi’s analysis, both with\n\nrespect to the GSA payments and the BVP reimbursements, is thorough and that his\n\nmethodologies are sound. His work with respect to GSA payments went well beyond the realm\n\nof simple mathematics, contrary to Toyobo’s assertion, and required the extensive review of\n\ntwenty-three boxes of invoices and other sales documents, as well as the application of\n\nrecognized forensic accounting techniques and statistical analysis. Indeed, his forensic\n\naccounting analysis resulted in his making downward adjustments to the underlying sales data\n\n\n       6        In that supplemental report, Mr. Anastasi also revised the start date for his\ncalculations to conform to this Court’s July 14, 2017 ruling. See United States ex rel. Westrick\nv. Second Chance Body Armor, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2017). Toyobo does not\noppose the supplementation of Mr. Anastasi’s earlier reports, calculations, and opinions to revise\nthe start date.\n\n\n                                                    25\n\fnumbers because of errors, credits, overcharges, and the like, which he discovered. With respect\n\nto Mr. Anastasi’s BVP reimbursements analysis, it is true that he relied heavily on Ms.\n\nHammond-Deckard, but he did not simply rubber stamp or “parrot” her work. He also\n\nconducted an independent review of a significant sample of the data, which confirmed that the\n\nBVP reimbursements data that had been compiled by Ms. Hammond-Deckard were supported by\n\nentries in the BVP accounting system database. See, e.g., SEC v. e-Smart Techs., Inc., 85 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 300, 312 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Experts at IDTP, moreover, did not simply parrot opinions\n\narticulated elsewhere. They examined data, verified results, gathered their own data, and ran tests\n\nof their own. Their approach to the technical issues in this case was appropriate to support expert\n\ntestimony.”); Dura Auto. Sys. of Ind., Inc. v. CTS Corp., 285 F.3d at 612 (“An expert witness is\n\npermitted to use assistants in formulating his expert opinion.”). In both instances, Mr. Anastasi’s\n\nanalyses conformed to accepted forensic accounting methods, and their presentation at trial will\n\nbe extremely helpful to the jury. For all of these reasons, the Court will admit Mr. Anastasi’s\n\nopinions and testimony at trial, subject to the following reservation.\n\n               The Court need not now opine on the legal question raised by the parties –\n\nwhether payments or expenditures made by the United States are the appropriate measure of\n\ndamages in a False Claims Act case involving the sale of defective products, or whether the price\n\npaid must be reduced by value received in order to calculate damages. 7 That determination can\n\nbe postponed until the Court has had a further opportunity to review the various court decisions\n\ncited by the parties and any additional authority they wish to provide. Furthermore, the parties\n\n\n\n       7       Each side cites numerous cases in support of their legal arguments, but the\ntouchstone in this jurisdiction must be United States v.

BOESE, CIVIL FALSE CLAIM S AND QUI\nTAM ACTIONS §§ 3.01 [B], 3.01 [C], 3.01 [D] (4th ed. 2011).\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fwill soon submit proposed jury instructions, including instructions with respect to damages,\n\nwhich will, of course, be supported by case citations and references to standard instructions used\n\nin other similar cases. The only open question as it relates to Mr. Anastasi’s opinions and\n\ntestimony to be offered at trial is whether he will be permitted to characterize the numbers about\n\nwhich he testifies as a result of his calculations and analyses as “damages” or as something else. 8\n\n\n                                        G. Dr. A.S. Abhiraman\n\n               Dr. A.S. Abhiraman is a fiber scientist proffered by the United States as a rebuttal\n\nwitness to respond to one of Toyobo’s proffered experts, Herbert Heuchert. Such rebuttal\n\ntestimony is not necessary, however, because Mr. Heuchert will not be permitted to testify for\n\nthe reasons discussed infra at 47-51.\n\n\n\n                           II. EXPERTS PROFFERED BY TOYOBO\n\n               The Court turns next to the expert witnesses proffered by Toyobo. The United\n\nStates moves to exclude portions of the opinions and testimony of three expert witnesses\n\nproffered by Toyobo: (i) Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki; (ii) Dr. Robert M. Nowak; and (iii) Herbert\n\nHeuchert.\n\n                                        A. Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki\n\n               Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki is an industrial fiber researcher and chemist. See May 2012\n\nReport, Yabuki Mot. Ex. 1 at 1 (“Yabuki Report”) [Dkt. No. 385-3]. He holds a Doctorate in\n\nEngineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology and joined Toyobo as a researcher in 1972.\n\n\n\n       8      Furthermore, Toyobo has filed a motion in limine [Dkt. No. 499] on the measure\nof damages which raises this issue and the parties will shortly be filing proposed jury\ninstructions.\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fSee Yabuki Opp. at 3-4. While employed at Toyobo, Dr. Yabuki served variously as a research\n\nchemist, chief research engineer, and director of research and development at Toyobo. Id. at 3-4,\n\n6. Between 1994 and 2000, Dr. Yabuki oversaw the development and commercialization of\n\nZylon fiber, which involved overseeing technical aspects of Zylon development including\n\nspinning, polymerization, and construction of the commercial production plant for Zylon. Id. at\n\n1, 3-4; Transcript of Daubert Hearing With Respect to Dr. Kazuyuki Yabuki (“Yabuki Hearing\n\nTranscript”) at 36:7-38:6 (Jan. 23, 2018). In December 2000, Dr. Yabuki left his position\n\noverseeing the day-to-day aspects of Zylon to take on broader management roles at Toyobo.\n\nYabuki Report at 4. Between 2009 and his retirement in 2013, he served as a corporate auditor\n\nresponsible for ensuring that Toyobo’s board of directors properly discharged its duties. Dr.\n\nYabuki has also been a visiting professor at several universities in Japan. Id. at 4, 6. He has\n\npublished twenty-seven articles on Zylon, as well as several other research papers on fiber\n\nproperties. Id.\n\n                  Dr. Yabuki has been designated as a rebuttal witness to respond to three experts\n\nproffered by the United States – Dr. Phoenix, Dr. Lesser, and Dr. Brookstein. Dr. Yabuki has\n\nsubmitted one rebuttal report dated May 23, 2012. The United States filed a motion [Dkt. No.\n\n385] to exclude Dr. Yabuki’s opinions in their entirety, a motion which Toyobo opposes. The\n\nCourt will refer to each opinion by the number of the corresponding section in Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nreport where the opinion is discussed.\n\n                  The Court held a Daubert hearing on January 23, 2018, at which Dr. Yabuki\n\ntestified. During the hearing, Toyobo withdrew Opinion Eight, regarding Toyobo’s efforts to\n\ndevelop stronger Zylon fiber through the “ZKP Project,” and Opinion Ten, regarding the\n\n“forthcoming and reasonable” nature of Toyobo’s disclosures. See Yabuki Hearing Transcript at\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f8:24-9:25, 71:14-18. Toyobo also withdrew Opinion Eleven, with the exception of the final two\n\nparagraphs discussing “Na/P ratio” and the use of Zylon vests in 2003. Id. 9\n\n               The United States asserts three global objections to Dr. Yabuki’s proffered\n\nopinions. First, it argues that Dr. Yabuki’s reports were prepared in significant part by other\n\nToyobo employees with expertise beyond the scope of Dr. Yabuki’s own expertise and whose\n\nwork Dr. Yabuki “blindly” accepted without independent verification. Yabuki Mot. at 8-14, 18-\n\n21. 10 Second, the United States contends that Dr. Yabuki either did not read certain references\n\ncited in his report or read them many years ago. Id. at 15-24. Third, the United States asserts\n\nthat Dr. Yabuki’s opinions do not fit the facts of the case because Dr. Yabuki offers opinions\n\nabout Toyobo’s manufacturing process and quality control system but does not know how either\n\nsystem operated. 11\n\n               Toyobo responds that Dr. Yabuki’s reliance on other Toyobo employees was\n\nproper because he “directed and supervised all of [the] work [of these employees], personally\n\ndrafted his expert report, and reviewed and verified their work to confirm its accuracy.” Yabuki\n\nOpp. at 7. Toyobo asserts that Dr. Yabuki employed a sound methodology by using his\n\nprofessional experience working with Zylon fiber and his expertise in various fiber properties to\n\n\n\n       9      The Court will reserve judgment on Opinions 14-17 proffered only in the related\nToyobo action (Civil Action No. 07-1144).\n       10      The United States argues that it did not have the opportunity to cross-examine\nthese employees. Yabuki Mot. at 11-15. The Court finds this argument unavailing, however, as\nthe United States could have moved to compel the depositions of these employees but declined\nto do so.\n       11      The United States also seeks to preclude Dr. Yabuki from offering certain\nopinions that he agreed not to offer at his deposition. See Yabuki Mot. at 41-43. Because the\nparties represented that they would resolve this issue through a joint stipulation, the Court need\nnot address the issue here. See Yabuki Hearing Transcript at 74:19-75:15.\n\n\n                                                29\n\fanalyze facts provided by these employees. See id. at 8-10. Toyobo argues that these employees\n\nhad specialties that were “very similar” to his own and that Dr. Yabuki opined on topics that fall\n\nwithin his areas of expertise. Id. at 11. In light of Dr. Yabuki’s sound methodology, Toyobo\n\ncontends, his failure to read certain references or to read them recently goes to the weight of his\n\nopinions rather than to their admissibility. Id. at 33-35.\n\n                Upon careful review of Dr. Yabuki’s report, deposition testimony, and testimony\n\nbefore the Court at the January 23 Daubert hearing, the Court will admit certain portions of his\n\nproffered opinions and exclude others. While the Court acknowledges the concerns expressed by\n\nthe United States with respect to Dr. Yabuki’s reliance on other Toyobo employees and his\n\nfailure to read certain references in his report, the Court finds that these concerns do not\n\npermeate all of Dr. Yabuki’s reports, testimony and opinions. Yabuki Mot. at 2. Accordingly,\n\nthe Court will address each of Dr. Yabuki’s opinions in turn.\n\n\n                                    1. Opinion One (Kink Bands)\n\n                Dr. Yabuki concludes that the opinions of Dr. Phoenix and Dr. Brookstein\n\nregarding the presence of “kink bands” in Zylon fiber – damage to fiber structure due to\n\ncompression or bending – are incorrect for several reasons. Yabuki Report at 3-5. For instance,\n\nDr. Yabuki opines that kink bands are not unique to Zylon and do not necessarily cause a\n\nsignificant loss in tensile strength, and that it is “well known in the ballistic industry that fiber\n\ndamage due to weaving can decrease [ballistic] performance.” Id. Dr. Yabuki further opines\n\nthat “Toyobo has no control over how Zylon is woven, handled and/or treated” once it leaves\n\nToyobo’s plant and that weavers and end-product manufacturers are “in the best position to\n\ndetermine what impact post-manufacturing processing has on a fiber.” Id. Dr. Yabuki also\n\n\n\n\n                                                   30\n\fopines that “Second Chance had the information it needed to account for the impacts of the\n\nweaving process on Zylon fiber when designing its Zylon vests.” Id.\n\n               The Court will admit Opinion One for the jury’s consideration. Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nconclusions regarding kink band formation and whether kink bands render Zylon defective are\n\nbased on a sound methodology grounded in Dr. Yabuki’s extensive experience with industrial\n\nfibers and supported by references to multiple research papers. 12 With respect to Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nconclusions regarding fiber damage caused by the weaving process – (i) that it is “well known\n\nthat fibers are susceptible to [the formation of kink bands] during the weaving process”; (ii) that\n\nit is “well known in the ballistic industry that fiber damage due to weaving can decrease [ballistic\n\nperformance]”; and (iii) that “[t]hese facts were known to body armor makers and others in the\n\nballistics industry” – it appears that Dr. Yabuki drew upon his extensive experience developing\n\nfibers for commercialization and use by manufacturers in various end-products. As a fiber\n\nchemist who was intimately involved in Toyobo’s efforts to develop Zylon fiber and bring it to\n\nmarket, Dr. Yabuki may reliably opine on whether it was “well known” that fiber damage due to\n\nweaving, including the formation of kinks bands, could decrease ballistic performance. To be\n\nsure, Dr. Yabuki testified at his deposition that he is “not too knowledgeable about [ballistics]”\n\nand relied on Mr. Kuroki in preparing his opinions about manufacturing for ballistic applications.\n\nSee 8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 17:11-23 [Dkt. No. 385-6]; Yabuki Hearing Transcript at 53:21-\n\n55:18, 59:10-20. Dr. Yabuki appears to be opining, however, on whether body armor\n\n\n\n       12       Dr. Yabuki withdrew one of the references cited in this section of his report – a\nPowerPoint prepared by one of the government’s experts, Dr. Amanda Forster – because he had\nnot read it. See 8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 58:7-59:18, 73:1-5 [Dkt. No. 385-6]. The Court is not\npersuaded that Opinion One is “so unreliable . . . that is fails Daubert’s reliability prong” based\non this single withdrawn reference. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5311533</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *37.\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fmanufacturers, as consumers of fiber for use in bulletproof vests, would have known that fiber is\n\nsusceptible to damage due to the weaving process and may affect ballistic performance as a\n\nresult. The Court therefore will admit Opinion One for whatever weight the jury may deem\n\nappropriate.\n\n\n                                  2. Opinion Two (Microvoids)\n\n               Dr. Yabuki responds to the opinions of Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein regarding\n\nmicrovoids – fiber swelling due to moisture – by explaining that microvoids are not unique to\n\nZylon and do not render Zylon defective. Yabuki Report at 5-10. Dr. Yabuki describes how\n\nmicrovoids form, draws comparisons to microvoids in Kevlar, and critiques the analysis applied\n\nby Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein. Yabuki Report at 6-8. He also opines that “end-product\n\nmanufacturers must protect Zylon from external moisture . . . .” Id. at 10.\n\n               The Court will admit Opinion Two for the jury’s consideration. Dr. Yabuki\n\napplied a reliable methodology grounded in his knowledge of industrial fibers and personal\n\ninvolvement in the development of Zylon fiber. Dr. Yabuki cites multiple research papers to\n\nsupport his opinion, including four that he co-authored, as well as other research conducted by\n\nToyobo. Yabuki Report at 5-10. With respect to Dr. Yabuki’s reliance on other Toyobo\n\nemployees, Dr. Yabuki testified at his deposition that Dr. Abe prepared the calculations for\n\nFigure 2 and that he “had Dr. Kitigawa check Dr. Lesser’s calculations.” See 8/22/12 Yabuki\n\nDep. at 17:6-10, 39:18-40:6 [Dkt. No. 385-6]. Accordingly, as to Opinion Two, it appears that\n\nDr. Yabuki relied on other Toyobo employees to verify and plot certain data. Furthermore, to\n\nthe extent that Dr. Yabuki relied on other Toyobo employees for their expertise in\n\nmicrostructures, morphology, and x-ray scattering, Dr. Yabuki testified that he also has expertise\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\fin those areas. See 08/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 38:20-39:24 [Dkt. No. 385-6] (“So between or\n\namong Dr. Murase, Dr. Kitigawa and myself, our specialties are very similar.”).\n\n                  The United States argues that Dr. Yabuki read three references cited in support of\n\nOpinion Two many years ago. See 8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 83:3-85:13 [Dkt. No. 385-6]\n\n(explaining that he read the book chapter by Young cited at footnote 16 in his report in 1990);\n\n8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 90:19-91:18 [Dkt. No. 385-6] (explaining that he read the Northholt\n\npaper cited at footnote 18 in his report in 1990 or 1991 and “perhaps” did not read the entirety of\n\nthe paper in preparing his reports but “confirmed and checked” the paper); 8/23/12 Yabuki Dep.\n\nat 102:1-105:4 [Dkt. No. 385-6] (explaining that he read the Martin paper cited at footnote 20 in\n\nhis report in 1998 and re-read certain pages in preparing his report). Because Dr. Yabuki appears\n\nto have read each of these references at some point, and in light of the other references cited in\n\nsupport of Opinion Two, the Court concludes that this issue does not render Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nopinion “so unreliable . . . that is fails Daubert’s reliability prong.” See In re Rail Freight Fuel\n\nSurcharge Antitrust Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5311533</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *37. The Court finds that the United States’\n\nfurther efforts to discredit Dr. Yabuki’s methodology by asserting that the book chapter by Dr.\n\nYoung cited in Dr. Yabuki’s report stands for the opposite proposition than that for which it is\n\ncited goes to weight rather than admissibility. See Ambrosini v. Labarraque, 101 F.3d at 140;\n\nMcReynolds v. Sodexho Marriott Servs., Inc., 349 F. Supp. 2d at 39; SEC v. Johnson, 525 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 76.\n\n\n                                 3. Opinion Three (Moisture Regain)\n\n                  Dr. Yabuki responds to Dr. Lesser’s and Dr. Brookstein’s conclusions that the\n\nmoisture regain in Zylon fiber renders the fiber defective by explaining that moisture regain is “a\n\nwell understood phenomenon in polymer chemistry” and is not unique to Zylon. Yabuki Report\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fat 11. Dr. Yabuki opines that the “end product manufacturer should design its product so as to\n\nprotect the polymer . . . from external moisture.” Id. at 11. Dr. Yabuki also offers multiple\n\nopinions in response to Dr. Brookstein’s conclusions about Toyobo’s manufacturing process and\n\nquality control procedures. Id.\n\n               The Court will admit certain portions of Opinion Three and exclude others. Dr.\n\nYabuki may offer opinions on: (i) the fiber properties of Zylon as they relate to moisture regain;\n\n(ii) the duration of exposure to sunlight sufficient to cause degradation; (iii) whether Toyobo has\n\ncontrol over Zylon fiber once it leaves Toyobo’s plant; and (iv) whether end-product\n\nmanufacturers or weavers could take steps to protect the fiber from moisture. These opinions\n\nwere reached through a reliable methodology grounded in Dr. Yabuki’s extensive experience\n\nwith fiber properties and his knowledge of the certain aspects of the manufacturing process (e.g.,\n\nexposure to light or water) that may affect fiber properties.\n\n               The Court will exclude, however, certain opinions regarding Toyobo’s quality\n\ncontrol procedures or those of weavers and Second Chance. Although Dr. Yabuki may properly\n\nopine that “were any light or ambient condition-induced degradation to occur, it would be\n\nreflected in the fiber properties that are measured after Zylon is ‘exposed’ to light and ambient\n\nconditions at the plant,” he may not opine that “the spool would be downgraded under Toyobo’s\n\n[quality control] procedures” as a result. Yabuki Report at 11. Furthermore, he may not opine\n\nthat “weavers checked the fiber properties of Zylon fiber when it arrived at their plant, and with\n\nthe exception of long red yarn and shipping-related physical damage (unrelated to light or\n\nhygrothermal degradation), there is no evidence that any shipments of Zylon were rejected\n\nbecause the fiber properties were outside of specification” or that “weaver [quality control]\n\nprocesses demonstrated that the Zylon that arrived at the weaver’s factories met Toyobo’s Zylon\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fspecification.” Id. at 11. Dr. Yabuki has not established any specialized expertise in Toyobo’s\n\nquality control procedures or those of weavers of ballistic fibers. Indeed, it appears that his\n\nknowledge of Toyobo’s quality control procedures is based solely on information provided by\n\nother Toyobo employees, namely Mr. Kuroki and Mr. Teramoto. See, e.g., 8/22/12 Yabuki Dep.\n\nat 41:6-13 [Dkt. No. 385-6].\n\n\n                           4. Opinions Regarding Residual Phosphorous\n\n               Opinions Four, Five, and Six address the presence of residual phosphorus in\n\nZylon fiber, which can lower tensile strength and resistance to thermal degradation. In\n\nparticular, Opinion Four challenges Dr. Brookstein’s and Dr. Lesser’s conclusion that Toyobo\n\nallows excessive phosphorus to remain in Zylon fiber. Yabuki Report at 12-13. Relatedly, in\n\nOpinion Five, Dr. Yabuki concludes that Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein wrongly suggest that\n\n“residual PPA” (residual phosphoric acid) is not adequately neutralized and contributes to\n\nhydrolytic degradation (moisture damage) in Zylon. Yabuki Report at 13. Similarly, Opinion\n\nSix provides that Dr. Lesser’s opinions about the existence of residual phosphorus in Zylon as a\n\nmono-aryl phosphate ester are incorrect. Id. at 14-16. Dr. Yabuki describes Toyobo’s research\n\non this topic and concludes that PBO mono-phosphate does not catalyze hydrolysis. Id. at 15-16.\n\n               The Court will admit Opinions Four, Five, and Six, subject to the exceptions\n\nbelow. These opinions are based in large part on a reliable methodology grounded in his\n\nextensive experience analyzing fiber properties and his personal involvement in the research\n\nefforts of Toyobo and Dow Chemical. The Court will exclude, however, the following portions\n\nof Opinion Four and Opinion Five regarding Toyobo’s quality control procedures for confirming\n\nthat the fiber was properly neutralized:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\f       Opinion Four: [T]he evidence establishes that the Zylon Toyobo sold was well\n       within the residual P target of 5,000 ppm or less. For example, the manufacturing\n       process that was designed to reduce residual P to levels at or below 5,000 ppm and\n       production conditions (e.g., residence time and wash temperature) was tightly\n       controlled to ensure that this was accomplished. . . .Toyobo frequently checked the\n       residual P content and, in all instances except one, found that Zylon contained less\n       than 5,000 ppm residual P. With respect to the one exception, residual P was only\n       slightly more than 5,000 ppm and Toyobo did not ship the fiber for use in bullet-\n       resistant applications.\n\n       Opinion Five: As a quality assurance measure, Toyobo checked the color of the\n       Zylon fiber in the fourth washing cabinet to confirm neutralization. This verified\n       that the Zylon produced was neutralized. And during production, Toyobo\n       frequently checked the residual sodium and phosphorous content in Zylon, and used\n       the data to calculate Na/P molar ratios. This testing consistently confirmed that the\n       Zylon produced for commercial sale was properly neutralized, and that the Na/P\n       ratio remained within the specified range.\n\nYabuki Report at 12-14. Dr. Yabuki has not established that he has specialized expertise in this\n\narea and appears to have relied solely on Mr. Teramoto and certain Toyobo documents. See\n\n8/22/12 Yabuki Dep. at 41:6-13 [Dkt. No. 385-6].\n\n               With respect to Opinion Six, the United States argues that Dr. Yabuki cited the\n\nwrong paper written by Dr. Ying-Hung So. See 8/23/12 Yabuki Dep. at 143:3-144:25 [Dkt. No.\n\n385-6]. The United States asserts that Dr. Yabuki also misstated or overstated Dr. So’s research\n\nfindings because, inter alia, Dr. So’s research required more than just adding “a drop of water” to\n\nremove the mono-aryl phosphate ester from the PBO molecule. 8/23/12 Yabuki Dep. at 155:17-\n\n21 [Dkt. No. 385-6]. The Court is not persuaded that Opinion Six is “so unreliable . . . that it\n\nfails Daubert’s reliability prong” based on the citation to the incorrect article by the same author\n\nin one instance. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5311533</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*37. The Court further concludes that the objection that Dr .Yabuki overstated the article’s\n\nfindings goes to weight and not admissibility. See SEC v. Johnson, 525 F. Supp. 2d at 76.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f                                 5. Opinion Seven (Strength Loss)\n\n               Dr. Yabuki opines that Dr. Phoenix, Dr. Lesser, and Dr. Brookstein incorrectly\n\nsuggest that Zylon is defective because it is susceptible to strength loss over time. Yabuki\n\nReport at 16-21. Dr. Yabuki opines that all materials, including fibers like Zylon, are susceptible\n\nto degradation. Id. at 16-17. Dr. Yabuki explains that Kevlar, like Zylon, degrades under certain\n\nconditions and is not considered to be “sub-standard.” Id. at 17-19. Dr. Yabuki also opines that\n\nthe rate of hydrolysis can be reduced if “the end-product manufacturers protect Zylon from\n\nexposure to external moisture.” Id. at 19. Dr. Yabuki relies on a NIST study regarding the\n\ndegradation of Zylon due to moisture to show that “if the Zylon fiber is protected from exposure\n\nto external moisture once it has been incorporated into a vest, there should be little or no\n\ndegradation of the strength of the Zylon fiber.” Id. at 19-20.\n\n               The United States raises two primary objections to Opinion Seven. First, the\n\nUnited States argues that the NIST study that Dr. Yabuki relied on was issued two years after\n\nZylon stopped being sold. See Yabuki Hearing Transcript 36:7-38:6 [Dkt. No. 385-6]; Yabuki\n\nReport at 19 n.62. Second, the United States argues that at his deposition, Dr. Yabuki identified\n\ntwo “commercially available and well-known methods” for protecting Zylon against external\n\nmoisture using seaweed and aluminum film. 11/8/12 Yabuki Dep. at 293:4-294:25. The United\n\nStates argues that these opinions do not fit the facts of this case because Dr. Yabuki does not\n\nknow if these methods can be used to protect Zylon from external moisture in ballistic\n\napplications or whether Toyobo informed body armor manufacturers about the need to protect\n\nZylon from moisture degradation.\n\n               The Court will admit Opinion Seven for the jury’s consideration. Dr. Yabuki\n\napplied a sound methodology by applying his knowledge of fiber properties as well as research\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\ffrom papers that he co-authored to assess Zylon fiber’s susceptibility to moisture degradation\n\nand strength loss. His partial reliance on the NIST study that was issued two years after Zylon\n\nwas no longer being sold is permissible, as Dr. Yabuki testified at the Daubert hearing that the\n\nfindings and the study mainly confirmed an established scientific fact that he had always known.\n\nSee Yabuki Hearing Transcript 36:7-38:6. Opinion Seven would assist the jury in assessing the\n\nsuitability of Zylon fiber for use in ballistic applications.\n\n                As for his references to the protective qualities of seaweed and aluminum film,\n\nDr. Yabuki does not purport to opine on whether the methods are feasible to protect body armor\n\nmade from Zylon fiber from moisture or whether these methods were communicated to body\n\narmor manufacturers. Rather, he offered these suggestions in response to a question asked by\n\ncounsel for the United States. 11/08/12 Yabuki Dep. at 293:9-294:6 [Dkt. No. 385-6]. Counsel\n\nmay cross examine Dr. Yabuki on this point.\n\n\n                                    6. Opinion Nine (Red Thread)\n\n                According to Dr. Yabuki, Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein incorrectly conclude that\n\nthe presence of red thread indicates that Zylon is defective. Yabuki Report at 21. Dr. Yabuki\n\nopines that there is no evidence that Second Chance used Zylon fabric containing red thread,\n\nToyobo had quality control processes in place to inspect for red thread, and weavers and body\n\narmor manufacturers had quality control systems in place to segregate non-conforming fiber. Id.\n\nat 21-22. Dr. Yabuki opines that “my review of the record shows that these stops worked\n\nbecause weavers and Second Chance caught red thread during their [quality assurance and\n\nquality control] processes, and Toyobo never received a report of red fiber being used in the\n\nmanufacture of a bullet-resistant vest.” Id. at 22.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   38\n\f               The Court will exclude Opinion Nine in its entirety. Dr. Yabuki’s opinion\n\nappears to be based on his “review of the record” and information conveyed by Toyobo\n\nemployees rather than on any specialized expertise in Toyobo’s quality control processes.\n\n11/8/12 Yabuki Dep. at 304:7-307:4 [Dkt. No. 385-6] (explaining that Dr. Yabuki’s\n\nunderstanding of Toyobo’s quality assurance and quality control procedures discussed in his\n\nreports to detect red thread was based on what he was told by Mr. Teramoto or Mr. Tanaka);\n\nYabuki Hearing Transcript at 56:4-58:8. Dr. Yabuki does not analyze red thread in terms of its\n\nimpact on Zylon fiber or its formation during the manufacturing process, but rather focuses on\n\nwhether Toyobo’s quality control procedures were designed to identify and segregate Zylon fiber\n\ncontaining red thread. Opinion Nine therefore will be excluded. 13\n\n\n                                7. Opinion Eleven (Na/P Ratio)\n\n               In the portion of Opinion Eleven that Toyobo has not withdrawn, Dr. Yabuki\n\nopines that Dr. Phoenix miscalculated the correlation between Na/P ratio and strength retention.\n\nYabuki Report at 30-32. After re-plotting the same data used by Dr. Phoenix, Dr. Yabuki found\n\na weaker correlation than the figures reported by Dr. Phoenix. Id. Separately, Dr. Yabuki opines\n\nthat Dr. Brookstein “ignores the fact that Second Chance continued to use Zylon in Triflex vests\n\neven after Toyobo’s October 2003 disclosures and Second Chance’s warranty exchange\n\nprogram.” Id. at 32.\n\n               Because Dr. Yabuki’s correlation analysis is based on the same data that Dr.\n\nPhoenix used and Dr. Yabuki merely disagrees with Dr. Phoenix’s conclusions, the Court will\n\n\n\n       13     Because the Court will exclude Opinion Nine, the Court need not address the\narguments raised by the United States with respect to the expert report of Herbert Heuchert or the\nHexcel Corporation documents cited on page 22 of Dr. Yabuki’s report.\n\n\n                                               39\n\fadmit Dr. Yabuki’s correlation analysis in Opinion Eleven. See Ambrosini v. LaBarraque, 101\n\nF.3d at 140 (“[T]he admissibility inquiry focuses not on conclusions but on approaches . . . .”).\n\nThe Court will exclude, however, the final paragraph of Opinion Eleven regarding Second\n\nChance’s continued use of Triflex vests after 2003. This portion of Dr. Yabuki’s proffered\n\nopinion reads more like a lawyer’s argument than an expert opinion based on specialized\n\nknowledge of or experience with Toyobo’s disclosures to body armor manufacturers.\n\n\n                            8. Opinion Twelve (Use of Averaged Data)\n\n               In Opinion Twelve, Dr. Yabuki opines that, contrary to the conclusions reached\n\nby Dr. Phoenix, Dr. Lesser, and Dr. Brookstein, Toyobo properly accounted for data scatter in\n\ntensile strength measurements by averaging the results of Toyobo’s strength testing. Yabuki\n\nReport at 32. The Court will admit Opinion Twelve, except for the following sentence:\n\n“Toyobo’s handling of the data is consistent with JIS L1013 and ASTEM 0885.” Id. Dr. Yabuki\n\ntestified at his deposition that he read JIS L1013 or ASTEM 0885 many years ago and did not re-\n\nread them in preparation for his report and relied on Toyobo’s quality control and quality\n\nassurance department to confirm that Toyobo’s procedures had conformed to these standards.\n\n11/9/12 Yabuki Dep. at 398:14-399:23 [Dkt. 385-6].\n\n\n                            9. Opinion Thirteen (Ballistic Application)\n\n               In Opinion Thirteen, Dr. Yabuki disagrees with Dr. Brookstein’s opinion that\n\nToyobo was responsible for determining the suitability of Zylon for use in a given end-product.\n\nYabuki Report at 32-33. First, Dr. Yabuki opines that the “final determination of suitability for\n\nuse lies with the end-product manufacturers – here, Second Chance.” Yabuki Report at 33.\n\nWith respect to fiber used in ballistic applications, Dr. Yabuki opines, inter alia, that “there are\n\n\n\n                                                  40\n\fmany different end-product designs” and that “fiber manufacturers cannot test their fiber for each\n\nof the infinite array of product designs with respect to vests using Zylon, and the use of Zylon\n\nwith other ballistic materials.” Id. The Court will admit these portions of Opinion Thirteen for\n\nthe jury’s consideration.\n\n               Second, Dr. Yabuki opines that “in my experience the end users like Second\n\nChance consider their end product design to be proprietary and do not share the designs with a\n\nraw material supplier like Toyobo.” Yabuki Report at 33. He also opines that “fiber suppliers\n\ndo not control end-product designs, including how the fiber is processed and whether it is\n\nprotected from sources of environmental damage, such as light degradation or external moisture,\n\nor how much Zylon is incorporated into the end design.” Id. He concludes: “For all of these\n\nreasons, it is customary in the high performance fiber industry for high performance fiber\n\nsuppliers not to provide any warranties or guarantees regarding the use of the fiber in end\n\napplications.” Id.\n\n               The Court will exclude these portions of Opinion Thirteen. Dr. Yabuki fails to\n\ncite a single publication, article, or other resource setting forth industry standards or other\n\nconventions to support his opinions regarding the specific practices of Second Chance or other\n\nbody armor manufacturers. Although Dr. Yabuki has extensive professional experience as a raw\n\nfiber supplier at Toyobo, he has not established how that experience informs or supports his\n\nopinions regarding the “customary” practices of body armor manufacturers. Absent such a\n\nshowing, Dr. Yabuki’s opinions are grounded in speculation rather than a reliable methodology.\n\n\n                                     B. Dr. Robert M. Nowak\n\n               Dr. Robert M. Nowak is a polymer chemist proffered by Toyobo as a rebuttal\n\nwitness to respond to two experts proffered by the United States, Dr. David S. Brookstein and\n\n\n                                                  41\n\fDr. Alan J. Lesser. Dr. Nowak holds a Doctorate in Chemistry from the University of Illinois.\n\nNowak Opp. at 2-3. He spent thirty-seven years at Dow Chemical Company, where he served as\n\nChief Scientist and Head of Central Research until retiring in 1993. Id. While employed at Dow\n\nChemical, Dr. Nowak oversaw the development of a number of synthetic polymers, including\n\nZylon. Id. Since that time, Dr. Nowak has spent fifteen years as the President and CEO of the\n\nMichigan Molecular Institute, a polymer research institute. Id. Dr. Nowak has published\n\neighteen papers on organic reaction mechanisms and reinforced plastics. Id.\n\n                Dr. Nowak has submitted a rebuttal report dated May 23, 2012. The United\n\nStates has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 383] to exclude certain opinions proffered by Dr. Nowak, a\n\nmotion which Toyobo opposes. Specifically, the United States seeks to exclude Opinions One,\n\nTwo, Three, Four, Five and Twelve in their entirety. Nowak Mot. at 3. The United States also\n\nseeks to exclude opinions on four additional topics: (i) analogies or comparisons of degradation\n\nin Zylon fiber or its polymer to degradation of human skin in sunlight and to metal fatigue in\n\naircraft parts and resulting aircraft crashes; (ii) whether Zylon’s aging characteristics and\n\nvulnerabilities had been quantified and its susceptibility to degradation could be addressed when\n\ndesigning a product; (iii) whether the results of testing used Zylon vests were more important\n\nthan testing Zylon fiber in a laboratory; and (iv) whether Toyobo had any control over Zylon\n\nafter it was shipped. 14\n\n\n\n\n        14       The United States also seeks to exclude “any topic on which Dr. Nowak testified\nat his deposition that he had no opinion.” Nowak Mot. at 4, 27. The United States attached a\nProposed Order to its motion identifying seventeen topics as to which Dr. Nowak purportedly\ntestified that he had no opinion. See Proposed Order [Dkt. No. 383-5]. Because the United\nStates’ request does not clearly identify which numbered opinions it seeks to exclude, the parties\nare directed to submit a joint stipulation identifying which opinions, if any, listed in Dr. Nowak’s\nreport remain in dispute in light of this Opinion.\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f                              1. Opinions One & Two (Strength Loss)\n\n                In response to Dr. Brookstein’s opinions that Toyobo should not have continued\n\nto sell Zylon because it could not resolve the Zylon degradation problem and that, because of its\n\ndegradation problem, Zylon was not suitable for use in ballistic applications, Dr. Nowak opines\n\nthat all materials degrade over time and degradation vulnerabilities – such as fiber tensile\n\nstrength loss – must be considered by the end-product manufacturer when designing end\n\nproducts. May 2012 Nowak Report, Mot. Ex. 1 at 3 (“Nowak Report”) [Dkt. No. 383-3]. The\n\nUnited States argues that Opinions One and Two are based on “junk science” rather than a\n\nreliable methodology and are generalized opinions which do not fit the facts of this case.\n\n                First, the United States seeks to exclude Dr. Nowak’s comparisons of Zylon\n\ndegradation to degradation of human skin in sunlight and metal fatigue in aircraft parts. Nowak\n\nMot. at 9-14. In support of Opinions One and Two, Dr. Nowak explains that steps can be taken\n\nto protect polymers from degradation sources like heat, light, and moisture, such as using\n\nsunscreen to protect skin (a natural polymer) from sun damage. Nowak Report at 7-8. In\n\nsupport of Opinion Two, Dr. Nowak explains that aluminum is used in aircraft parts even though\n\nit is susceptible to fatigue and corrosion in order to illustrate that Zylon’s susceptibility to\n\ndegradation does not render it defective. Id. at 8-9.\n\n                According to the United States, because Dr. Nowak did not explain the\n\nrelationship between human skin or metal and Zylon, the comparisons are not the product of a\n\nreliable methodology. Nowak Mot. at 9. The United States asserts that Dr. Nowak lacks the\n\ntraining or expertise to draw such a comparison because he is not a doctor or a metallurgist. Id.\n\nat 11-12. In addition, the United States contends that Dr. Nowak’s analogies risk confusing the\n\njury by conveying that degradation is either easily solved or an accident. Id. at 12-13. Toyobo\n\n\n\n                                                  43\n\fresponds that Dr. Nowak’s comparisons are mere “illustrations” and that Dr. Nowak does not\n\nanalogize Zylon degradation to sun degradation in skin or metal fatigue in aircrafts. Nowak\n\nOpp. at 9. Rather, Dr. Nowak based his opinions concerning degradation on polymer chemistry.\n\nToyobo argues that he used the examples only to show that all materials degrade (albeit\n\ndifferently) but may still be used so long as appropriate steps are taken by the end-product\n\nmanufacturer. Id. at 9-10.\n\n               The Court concludes that Dr. Nowak’s proffered comparisons are admissible for\n\nthe purpose for which they are offered – to show that all materials degrade over time and that\n\nsusceptibility to degradation can be addressed when designing a product. Dr. Nowak used a\n\nreliable methodology by applying his knowledge of and experience in principles of polymer\n\nchemistry and fiber properties. The jury can decide what weight to give to the examples he\n\ninvokes in support of his opinions regarding degradation. Furthermore, Dr. Nowak expressly\n\nacknowledged that these two materials are not analogous, thus minimizing the risk of confusion\n\nto the jury.\n\n               Second, the United States contends that Dr. Nowak’s opinion that body armor\n\nmanufacturers could use Zylon degradation information to design their vests does not fit the facts\n\nof the case. The United States argues that Dr. Nowak did not opine on whether Toyobo provided\n\nsufficient information to body armor manufacturers to design a vest to account for degradation.\n\nId. at 16. The United States further contends that his suggestion that the vest manufacturers\n\n“would go back to Toyobo and ask for more information” does not fit the facts because Second\n\nChance did not ask Toyobo to conduct any testing on its vests. Id. at 18.\n\n               The Court will admit Dr. Nowak’s opinion that degradation vulnerabilities must\n\nbe considered by the end-product manufacturer when designing end products. The Court finds\n\n\n\n                                                44\n\fthat the United States’ concerns regarding whether the information disclosed by Toyobo was\n\nsufficient or whether Second Chance asked Toyobo for further testing go to weight rather than\n\nadmissibility.\n\n\n                                  2. Opinion Four (Kink Bands)\n\n                 In Opinion Four, Dr. Nowak concludes that “[k]ink bands are a common\n\noccurrence in lyotropic LCPs like Kevlar, Zylon, M5 and others and are presumed to lower the\n\nmechanical properties of the polymer slightly. This is not a major problem and does not cause a\n\nfurther decay in properties over time.” Nowak Report at 13. The United States seeks to exclude\n\nthis opinion because it does not fit the facts of the case. It argues that Dr. Nowak incorrectly\n\nassumed that Toyobo did not have control over Zylon fiber after it left the Toyobo\n\nmanufacturing plant. Nowak Opp. at 24. 15 The United States argues that this assumption is\n\nbelied by the facts because Toyobo played a role in selecting weavers, worked with Second\n\nChance during the development of certain bulletproof vests, provided information and advice\n\nabout weaving to Second Chance and the weavers, and knew that the vests were 100% Zylon.\n\nId. at 25-26. The United States further argues that Dr. Nowak’s opinion that kink bands are not a\n\nmajor issue is improper because he is not a ballistics expert and cannot reliably opine on whether\n\nthe ballistics industry was aware of the extent of the damage that weaving caused in Zylon. Id. at\n\n26-27.\n\n                 The Court will admit Opinion Four. Dr. Nowak relied on his decades of\n\nexperience in polymer chemistry and working with synthetic polymers like Zylon and Kevlar to\n\nanalyze the factual record and reach his conclusions regarding the impact of kink bands on\n\n\n         15    This appears to be one of the bases for excluding Opinion Three, which the\nUnited States does not directly address in its briefing.\n\n\n                                                 45\n\fZylon’s suitability for use in bulletproof vests. The United States’ objections regarding whether\n\nToyobo exercised any control over Zylon fiber after it left the plant do not establish that Dr.\n\nNowak’s methodology is unsound, but rather express disagreement with his conclusions.\n\n\n                                    3. Opinion Five (Hydrolysis)\n\n               In Opinion Five, Dr. Nowak states that “studying the hydrolysis of a polymer\n\nunder laboratory conditions is very important data, but there is no substitute for evaluating the\n\nproduct containing that polymer under real life conditions by the manufacturer of the end\n\nproduct.” Nowak Report at 15. 16 The United States seeks to exclude the opinion that, as the\n\nUnited States puts it, “ballistic testing of the vests is more important than testing the fiber,” as\n\nunreliable in light of Dr. Nowak’s prior testimony about the results of Second Chance’s used vest\n\ntesting. The United States argues that this opinion does not fit the facts of this case because\n\nSecond Chance did provide Toyobo with the data from the testing of its used Zylon vests.\n\nNowak Mot. at 22-23.\n\n               The United States has mischaracterized Dr. Nowak’s opinion – Dr. Nowak merely\n\nopines that end-product testing is important, not that is it “more important.” Furthermore, if\n\nthere are inconsistencies between Dr. Nowak’s report and his prior testimony, this may be\n\nfruitful ground for cross examination. The Court therefore will admit Opinion Five.\n\n\n                                  4. Opinion Twelve (Red Thread)\n\n               In Opinion Twelve, Dr. Nowak opines that Dr. Lesser and Dr. Brookstein\n\noverstate the “problem” with red thread and that Dr. Brookstein’s conclusion that Zylon should\n\n\n\n       16      This also appears to be one of the bases for excluding Opinion Three, which the\nUnited States does not directly address in its briefing.\n\n\n                                                  46\n\fnever have been sold is incorrect. Nowak Report at 21. He opines that quality control personnel\n\n“constantly monitor the process to catch any irregularities in production.” Id. The United States\n\nseeks to exclude this opinion on the ground that Dr. Nowak’s opinions about Toyobo’s quality\n\ncontrol for red thread are speculative because he did not about how the quality control processes\n\nfunctioned. The Court agrees. Dr. Nowak has not established that his testimony regarding\n\nToyobo’s quality control procedures is based on anything other than his review of internal\n\nToyobo documents rather than specialized expertise. The Court therefore will exclude Opinion\n\nTwelve.\n\n                                       C. Herbert Heuchert\n\n                Herbert Heuchert is a consultant proffered by Toyobo as an expert in the\n\nmanufacture of “safety-related products.” Mr. Heuchert has over thirty years of manufacturing\n\nexperience in the tire industry. Heuchert Opp. at 3-5. Between 1960 and 1993, Mr. Heuchert\n\nworked for Uniroyal Goodrich, a tire manufacturer, where he served variously as an industrial\n\nengineer, vice president of engineering and process development, and senior vice president of\n\noperations. While employed at Uniroyal, Mr. Heuchert oversaw the manufacture of rubber and\n\nother raw materials used in tires, fire protection gear, and other products. Id. at 4, 9-10. Mr.\n\nHeuchert was also responsible for evaluating the suitability of high-performance fibers like\n\nKevlar for use in tires and implementing quality control systems at multiple tire manufacturing\n\nplants and rubber suppliers. Id. at 4-5, 10-11. Since leaving Uniroyal in 1993, Mr. Heuchert has\n\nmanaged his own consulting company that provides manufacturing and quality control expertise\n\nprimarily in the tire industry. Id.\n\n                Mr. Heuchert has submitted an affirmative report dated March 15, 2012 and a\n\nrebuttal report dated May 23, 2012 in response to one of the United States’ experts, Dr. David S.\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\fBrookstein. The United States has filed a motion [Dkt. No. 379] to exclude Mr. Heuchert’s\n\nproffered opinions in their entirety, a motion which Toyobo opposes. 17\n\n               Mr. Heuchert’s proffered opinions focus on the respective roles and\n\nresponsibilities of Toyobo and body armor manufacturers as participants in a supply chain\n\nwherein Toyobo provided the raw material (Zylon) to the end-use manufacturers (Second\n\nChance and other body armor manufacturers) for use in bulletproof vests. Mr. Heuchert\n\nconcludes that Toyobo met its duties and obligations as a supplier of raw material and that body\n\narmor manufacturers and Toyobo employed appropriate quality control procedures. March 2012\n\nReport, Heuchert Motion Ex. 1 at 4-5 [Dkt. No. 379-1]. In his rebuttal report, Mr. Heuchert\n\nresponds to Dr. Brookstein’s criticisms of Zylon fiber and Toyobo’s manufacturing process by\n\nopining that “the design and assembly stages of end product development are when the\n\nsensitivities and vulnerabilities of raw materials should be examined and the measures taken to\n\nprotect against those sensitivities,” and that Toyobo implemented appropriate quality control\n\nprocedures to identify and isolate defective Zylon fiber. May 2012 Rebuttal Report, Heuchert\n\nMot. Ex. 3 at 4, 8 [Dkt. No. 379-1].\n\n               The United States seeks to exclude Mr. Heuchert’s opinions as unreliable and\n\nirrelevant because his experience is limited to the tire industry. Heuchert Mot. at 7. According\n\nto the United States, Mr. Heuchert has not shown how his experience – limited to the tire\n\nindustry – applies to the manufacture of high-performance fibers used in the ballistics industry.\n\nId. at 10, 15. The United States also contends that Mr. Heuchert has failed to explain how the\n\nduties and expectations of Uniroyal, a tire manufacturer that conducts its own testing of raw\n\n\n       17    The parties have withdrawn their arguments related to Second Chance’s\ncommercial warranty. See Joint Submission Regarding Previously Filed Daubert Motions [Dkt.\nNo. 456].\n\n\n                                                48\n\fmaterials incorporated into its tires, are comparable to those of Toyobo or Second Chance in\n\nterms of designing, testing, and manufacturing Zylon for use in bulletproof vests. Id. at 9, 13-15.\n\n                Toyobo takes a broader view of Mr. Heuchert’s expertise. Toyobo acknowledges\n\nthat Mr. Heuchert is not an expert in the ballistics industry but maintains that he has relevant\n\nexpertise by virtue of his experience as an end-product manufacturer and a raw material supplier\n\nin the “safety-related industry.” Heuchert Opp. 1, 12. Toyobo explains that Mr. Heuchert also\n\nhas extensive experience with the development, implementation, and ongoing supervision of\n\nquality control management systems at multiple raw materials and safety-related end-product\n\nmanufacturing plants. Id. at 1. According to Toyobo, Mr. Heuchert’s opinions on\n\nmanufacturing standards and quality control processes would aid the jury in understanding the\n\nrelationship between a raw material supplier and an end-product manufacturer in a “safety-\n\nrelated industry.” Id. at 2, 17.\n\n                The Court finds that Mr. Heuchert’s opinions are neither reliable nor relevant.\n\nMr. Heuchert bases his opinions exclusively on his extensive manufacturing and consulting\n\nexperience in the tire industry. Mr. Heuchert fails, however, to explain how his experience in the\n\ntire industry supports his opinions about the manufacture of high-performance fibers in the\n\nballistics industry or how these industries are comparable.

R. EVID. 702 advisory\n\ncommittee notes)). While safety may be a significant concern in both industries, it is hardly\n\nadequate to say that “[t]ires, like bullet resistant vests, are safety-critical products.” Opp. at 3-4.\n\n\n\n                                                  49\n\fMr. Heuchert has not explained whether or how practices of the tire industry apply to the\n\nballistics industry. See McClain v. Metabolife Int’l, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76908\"><a href=\"/opinion/76908/johnny-c-mcclain-v-metabolife-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1244-45 (11th Cir.\n\n2005) (reversing district court’s admission of expert testimony where witness could not\n\ndemonstrate that the drug at issue and the drug that the expert had knowledge of acted in the\n\nsame manner). Moreover, Mr. Heuchert does not cite any accepted industry standards or\n\nrelevant articles in either of his reports, relying instead solely on documents and testimony from\n\nthis case.\n\n               Toyobo attempts to furnish the missing link between Mr. Heuchert’s tire industry\n\nexperience and his opinions regarding the ballistics industry through a chart matching the topics\n\non which he opined to his experience. See Heuchert Opp. Ex. 5 [Dkt. No. 394-6]. The chart,\n\nhowever, only further demonstrates the gap between Mr. Heuchert’s experience and his proffered\n\nopinions. For instance, in support of his opinion that end-product manufacturers are responsible\n\nfor durability testing, Toyobo cites Mr. Heuchert’s “experience as both a raw material supplier\n\nand end product manufacturer.” Heuchert Opp. Ex. 5 at 2 [Dkt. No. 394-6]. This assertion\n\nmerely reinforces the fact that Mr. Heuchert has not explained whether or how standards in the\n\ntire industry may be applied to the ballistics industry.\n\n               Similarly, Mr. Heuchert has not shown how his opinions about conduct in the tire\n\nindustry are relevant to manufacturing fiber for ballistic use. His proffered opinions would not\n\naid the jury in assessing the responsibility of suppliers and manufacturers in the industry at issue.\n\nIndeed, his opinions would risk confusing the jury regarding the standards applicable to the body\n\narmor industry. Mr. Heuchert offers opinions about standards generally applicable to the\n\n“safety-related industry” without any experience working in or studying the particular industry at\n\nissue – fibers manufactured for ballistic use. See, e.g., SEC v. Tourre, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674-\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\f75 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (excluding expert with expertise in “general area of structured finance,” but\n\nno experience in particular industry of collateralized debt obligations).\n\n               In sum, Mr. Heuchert has not worked in the ballistics industry and is not an expert\n\nin the field of fiber science or ballistics. His expertise in “safety-related products” is so broad a\n\ncategory as to be meaningless. The Court therefore will exclude Mr. Heuchert’s opinions in their\n\nentirety.\n\n                                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons set forth in this Opinion, the Court will admit certain opinions and\n\ntestimony offered by the parties’ expert witnesses and exclude others. Counsel shall prepare\n\ntheir experts to avoid the excluded subject matter. A separate Order consistent with the decisions\n\nexpressed herein will be issued this same day.\n\n               SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      /s/\n                                                        PAUL L.
