ARNOLD, Chief Judge, HEANEY and WOLLMAN, Circuit Judges.\n                                ___________\n\n\nRICHARD S. ARNOLD, Chief Judge.\n\n\n     In 1992, the long-running desegregation case involving the three\nschool districts in Pulaski County, Arkansas, was settled.        A consent\ndecree, embodying the agreement of all the parties, was entered on April\n29, 1992.   Under this Court’s opinion in Little Rock School District v.\nPulaski County Special School District, 921\n\f F.2d 1371 (8th Cir. 1990), the District Court was given the job of\nmonitoring the settlement agreement to ensure that all parties complied\nwith it.    The question presented in this case is whether the District Court\nhad the authority, as an aspect of this enforcement responsibility, to\nforbid a strike by the teachers of the Pulaski County Special School\nDistrict.\n\n\n     On August 19, 1996, the District’s teachers, represented by the\nPulaski Association of Classroom Teachers, went on strike.        Three days\nlater, on August 22, certain parents of PCSSD students filed suit in the\nChancery Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas, and sought a preliminary\ninjunction against the strike, alleging state-law grounds in support of\ntheir request.    The next day, after a hearing on the motion, the Chancery\nCourt denied injunctive relief on the ground that no showing of irreparable\nharm had been made.     Wilson v. Pulaski Ass’n of Classroom Teachers, No.\nIJ96-5788 (slip op. Ark. Ch. Ct. Aug., 23, 1996).       Another hearing was\nscheduled for September 19.     This state-court case is now pending before\nthe Supreme Court of Arkansas on PCSSD’s appeal.\n\n\n     In the meantime, on August 27, the District itself made a motion in\nthe federal district court for injunctive relief against the strike.\nSchool opened on August 28.     The District used teachers who were willing\nto cross the picket line and others to staff its classrooms.    On that same\nday, the District Court held a hearing on PCSSD’s motion.             At the\nconclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the teachers to return to work\non September 3.   The teachers complied with this order, and PCSSD’s schools\nhave been open ever since.\n     At the heart of this case lies the question of the District Court’s\nauthority to enjoin the strike.    The teachers and their Union were parties\nto the school-desegregation case, having been\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fallowed to intervene.     See Little Rock School District v. Pulaski County\nSpecial School District, 839 F.2d 1296, 1314-15 (8th Cir.), cert. denied,\n488 U.S. 869 (1988).    Like all other parties, they agreed to the settlement\nagreement embodied in the consent decree entered in 1992.               The difficulty\nis that the settlement agreement says nothing about the teachers’ right to\nstrike.      The job of the District Court is to enforce the settlement\nagreement.    But since the agreement is silent on the subject of a strike\nby the teachers, the authority of the District Court to issue its order\nmust be found elsewhere, if at all.\n\n\n     The fact that the case has been settled does not make the three\nschool    districts   involved   wards    of   the    Court.       They    are    not   in\nreceivership.     Except as provided in the settlement agreement, or by\nreasonable implication therefrom, the rights and duties of the three school\ndistricts and those with whom they do business, including employees and\norganizations of employees, are governed by other applicable law, primarily\nstate law.     As we explained in 1988, a federal district court does have\nremedial   authority,   in   necessary    cases,     to   modify   or     even   abrogate\nagreements that perpetuate segregation or impede a desegregation plan.\nSuch action, however, can be taken only “after an evidentiary hearing and\nupon a finding that the change is essential to the desegregation remedy,”\n839 F.2d at 1315, unless, of course, the parties have agreed otherwise, an\nevent which, as we have explained, has not occurred in this case.\n     It is suggested, though without much force, that the failure of PCSSD\nto increase teachers’ salaries may be a violation of state law, Act 917 of\n1995, Ark. Code. Ann. § 6-17-1001 (Michie 1995).          It is also suggested that\nthe collective-bargaining agreement between the teachers and PCSSD may, by\nimplication, forbid a strike, because the agreement contains certain\nprocedures for\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fresolving disputes, including declaration of an impasse and factfinding by\nsome   neutral person.     These arguments have nothing to do with the\nsettlement agreement and depend on state law.   Likewise, the suggestion on\nthe other side that state law forbids strikes by public employees raises\nno issue within the particular competence of the federal courts.     Because\nthis case has   been settled, the settlement agreement becomes, in a sense,\na particularization of federal law applicable to these parties.          The\njurisdiction of the District Court to enforce that agreement does not\ninclude the authority to resolve other disputes among the parties or to\nadjust their legal rights and responsibilities arising from other sources.\nNo   independent basis of jurisdiction has been suggested.         In these\ncircumstances, and especially in view of the fact that an earlier-filed\ncase is now pending in the state courts, we think it best to leave issues\nof state law and contract interpretation to those courts.\n       PCSSD argues that if it cannot hold school at all, it cannot carry\nout the desegregation plan, and this is perhaps the most appealing argument\nthe school district has.   The trouble with the argument is that it proves\ntoo much.   If, for example, the school district’s water bill were raised\nto an exorbitant level, making it financially difficult or impossible to\noperate, we do not think that the District Court, as an aspect of its\nauthority to monitor the settlement agreement, would have power to order\nthe utility furnishing the water ro reduce its rates.   No doubt the example\nis an extreme one, but it makes the point.        The teachers, unlike the\nputative water utility, are parties to the settlement agreement, but the\nagreement does not address their right to strike.       Indeed, it refers to\nexisting collective-bargaining arrangements in such a way as to reinforce,\nrather than abrogate, their effectiveness.      In addition, as a matter of\nfact, the school district was not rendered inoperable by the strike, and\nwas making plans to open its doors\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fwithout the help of the striking teachers when the District Court issued\nits injunction.     The operation of the schools would unquestionably have\nbeen impaired to some extent, but we do not think that the proof was\nsufficiently striking to justify the action taken.          So long as the\nsettlement agreement is complied with, the school district must make its\nown way through the ordinary difficulties of life as an employer.    Another\ncase would be presented if the teachers were to take action pointedly aimed\nat interfering with desegregation as such (to use another extreme example\nin order to make a point).\n\n\n        Finally, and perhaps as an afterthought, the school district asserts\nthat the injunction against the strike can be upheld as a modification of\nthe settlement agreement.     The District Court of course has power, after\na proper showing, to modify the settlement agreement.        In theory, such\npower could be exercised in such a way as to affect the rights of the\nteachers.    This suggestion, however, is wholly foreign to the present case.\nNo one asked the District Court to modify the settlement agreement, it did\nnot say that it was modifying the agreement, and the agreement in fact\nstands unmodified to this day.\n\n\n        We understand the concerns that led the District Court to protect\nPCSSD and its school children from the effects of a teachers’ strike.    But\nwe cannot agree that the settlement agreement, even by implication, took\naway the right to strike, assuming such a right exists under state law, nor\ncan we find any other source of authority for the action the District Court\ntook.    The order granting an injunction against the teachers’ strike is\ntherefore\n\n\n        Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fA true copy.\n\n\n     Attest:\n\n\n           CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                            -6-\n\f",
