Sec. 12132, by the manner in which it operates its attendant care and nursing home programs.  Idell S. alleges that DPW is violating the ADA by requiring that she receive required care services in the segregated setting of a nursing home rather than through DPW's attendant care program.  That program would allow her to receive those services in her own home where she could reside with her children.  The district court ruled that DPW is not violating the ADA because it is not discriminating against Idell S.  For the reasons that follow we will reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 1994, Idell S. filed an uncontested motion to join a lawsuit which had previously been filed by Beverly D., and Ilene F., who were also nursing home residents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The suit alleged that DPW had violated Title II of the ADA by providing services in a nursing home rather than in the \"most integrated setting appropriate\" to the plaintiffs' needs, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Beverly D. and Ilene F. filed for an uncontested voluntary dismissal of their claim because they had been discharged from the nursing home.  At the same time, Idell S. moved for summary judgment based upon an Amended Stipulation of Facts.  Prior to ruling on the joinder and voluntary dismissal motions, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order dated January 27, 1994, granting summary judgment against Beverly D. and Ilene F. and in favor of DPW.  On February 2, 1994, the district court issued an Order dismissing Beverly D. and Ilene F. as plaintiffs and adding Idell S. as a plaintiff.  The court also ruled that \"[f]or the reasons stated in the Memorandum filed January 27, 1994, the motion for summary judgment of Idell S. is denied and judgment is entered in favor of defendants and against ... Idell S.....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Idell S. then filed this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Idell S. is 43 years old and the mother of two children ages 22 and 14.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In 1973 she contracted meningitis which left her paralyzed from the waist down and greatly reduced her ability to care for herself.  As a result, she has been a patient at the Philadelphia Nursing Home since December 26, 1989.  Idell S. uses a wheelchair for locomotion and requires assistance with certain activities of daily living including bathing, laundry, shopping, getting in and out of bed, and house cleaning.  She is able to cook, dress herself (except for her shoes and socks), attend to her personal hygiene (using a transfer board to access the toilet) and to her grooming.  The parties agree that, although Idell S. is not capable of fully independent living, she is not so incapacitated that she needs the custodial care of a nursing home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DPW operates two different programs that provide physically disabled persons with assistance in daily living.  DPW funds nursing home residence through the Medical Assistance program (\"Medicaid\"), and it operates an \"attendant care program\" under 62 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. Secs. 3051-3055 (the \"Care Act\").  The attendant care program provides \"[t]hose basic and ancillary services which enable an individual [with physical disabilities] to live in his[/her] home and community rather than in an institution and to carry out functions of daily living, self care and mobility.\"   62 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. Secs. 3052, 3054.  DPW's average cost of caring for a person in a nursing home is $45,000 per year.  The Commonwealth pays 44% of this amount ($19,800) and the difference ($24,200) is paid by the federal government.  DPW's average cost of caring for a person in the attendant care program is $10,500 per year.  That amount is totally borne by the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Homemaker Service of the Metropolitan Area, Inc.  (\"HSMA\") contracts with DPW to operate an attendant care program.  \"The [s]ervice [provided by HSMA] consists of those basic and ancillary services which enable eligible individuals to live in their own homes and communities rather than in institutions and to carry out functions of daily living, self-care and mobility.\"   Amended Stipulation of Facts, p 35.  The program thus allows eligible individuals:  \"1.  [t]o live in the least restrictive environment as independently as possible;  2.  [t]o remain in their homes and to prevent their inappropriate institutionalization....\"  Id. at p 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, HSMA evaluated Idell S. and determined that she was eligible for attendant care services.  However, because of a lack of funding, she was placed on a waiting list for that program and continues living in a nursing home, separated from her children.  The parties agree that if Idell S. were enrolled in the attendant care program, nursing home care would be inappropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Except for access to skilled nursing care which she neither needs nor wants, Idell S. receives the same kind of services in the nursing home that the attendant care program would provide.  \"DPW has not applied for reimbursement under the Medical Assistance statute for personal care/attendant care services in the community,\" Amended Stipulation of Facts p 41, nor has it \"requested Medical Assistance dollars be available for Attendant Care Services in the Community.\"   Id. at p 37.  Consequently, the Commonwealth continues to spend approximately $45,000 a year to keep Idell S. confined in a nursing home rather then spend considerably less to provide her with appropriate care in her own home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because she is required to receive services in a nursing home, Idell S. has no contacts with non-disabled persons other than the staff of the nursing home and visits from her two children.  Idell S. claims that this violates Title II of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review applicable to a grant of summary judgment is plenary.  Bixler v. Central Pa.  Teamsters Health &amp; Welfare Fund, 12 F.3d 1292, 1297 (3d Cir.1993).  \"On review, the appellate court is required to apply the same test the district court should have utilized initially.\"  Goodman v. Mead Johnson &amp; Co., 534 F.2d 566, 573 (3d Cir.1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1038, 97 S.Ct. 732, 50 L.Ed.2d 748 (1977).  A motion for summary judgment shall be granted if the court determines \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  The district court's interpretation of a federal regulation is a question of law subject to plenary review.  ADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d 1184, 1191 n. 6 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Idell S. was</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[d]enied attendant care services because of a lack of funds.  [The record] does not demonstrate that [she has] been denied funding for attendant care services because [she] is disabled.  [Her] failure to show that [she] has been excluded from the attendant care services program on the basis of [her] disability is fatal to [her] claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Memorandum Opinion at 11.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794, was the first broad federal statute aimed at eradicating discrimination against individuals with disabilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  \"Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, [is] commonly known as the civil rights bill of the disabled.\"  ADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d at 1187.   Section 504 now reads in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>No otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 794 (Supp.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Section 504's sponsors described it as a response to \" 'previous societal neglect' \" and introduced it to rectify \"the country's 'shameful oversights' which caused the handicapped to live among society 'shunted aside, hidden and ignored.' \"  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 296, 105 S.Ct. 712, 717, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 1976 then-President Gerald Ford signed Executive Order No. 11914, 3 C.F.R. 117 (1977), which authorized the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to coordinate enforcement of section 504 and which required the Secretary of HEW to promulgate regulations for enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Subsequently, HEW's section 504 rulemaking and enforcement authority was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\").  See 20 U.S.C. Sec. 3508.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 2, 1980, President Carter signed Executive Order No. 12250, 45 Fed.Reg. 72995, entitled \"Leadership and Coordination of Nondiscrimination Laws\".  That Executive Order transferred HHS's coordination and enforcement authority to the Attorney General.  Section 1-105 of that Executive Order provided that the HHS guidelines \"shall be deemed to have been issued by the Attorney General pursuant to this Order and shall continue in effect until revoked or modified by the Attorney General.\"   Thereafter, the Department of Justice adopted the HHS coordination and enforcement regulations and transferred them from 45 C.F.R. part 84 to 28 C.F.R. part 41, 46 Fed.Reg. 40686 (the \"coordination regulations.\")   The section 504 coordination regulations begin by stating that the purpose of 28 C.F.R. part 41 is to \"implement Executive Order 12250, which requires the Department of Justice to coordinate the implementation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\"  28 C.F.R. Sec. 41.1.  A subsequent section requires all federal agencies to issue regulations \"to implement section 504 with respect to programs and activities to which it provides assistance.\"  28 C.F.R. Sec. 41.4.  The coordination regulations contain a separate section which lists a number of general prohibitions against disability-based discrimination.  28 C.F.R. Sec. 41.51.  That section mandates that all recipients of federal financial assistance \"shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.\"  28 C.F.R. Sec. 41.51(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Section 504 has been called \"the cornerstone of the civil rights movement of the mobility-impaired\", ADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d at 1205 (3d Cir.1989) (concurring opinion), its shortcomings and deficiencies quickly became apparent.  See, e.g., Cook, The Americans with Disabilities Act:  The Move to Integration, 64 Temp.L.Rev. 393, 394-408 (1991) (The Rehabilitation Act and its regulations have been practically a dead letter as a remedy for segregated public services).  One commentator has written that the weaknesses of section 504 arise from its statutory language,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> the limited extent of its coverage, inadequate enforcement mechanisms and erratic judicial interpretations.  Burgdorf, The Americans with Disabilities Act:  Analysis and Implications of a Second-Generation Civil Rights Statute, 26 Harv.C.R.--C.L.L.Rev. 413, 431 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toward the end of the 1980's the United States Senate and the House of Representatives both recognized that then current laws were \"inadequate\" to combat \"the pervasive problems of discrimination that people with disabilities are facing.\"   S.Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1989);  H.R.Rep. No. 485(II), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 47 (1990).  The Senate recognized the need for \"omnibus civil rights legislation\" for the disabled.  S.Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 19 (1989).  Similarly, the House addressed the need for legislation that \"will finally set in place the necessary civil rights protections for people with disabilities.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 485(II), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 40 (1990).  Both branches of Congress concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>[T]here is a compelling need to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities and for the integration of persons with disabilities into the economic and social mainstream of American life.  Further, there is a need to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 116, 20;  H.R.Rep. No. 485(II), 50 (emphasis added).  It was against this backdrop that the ADA was enacted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 12131-12134, incorporates the \"non-discrimination principles\" of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and extends them to state and local governments.  Easley v. Snider, 36 F.3d 297, 300 (3d Cir.1994).  Section 202 of Title II provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. Sec. 12132.  The Act directs the Attorney General to promulgate regulations necessary to implement Title II.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12134(a).  The Act further commands that those regulations \"be consistent with this chapter and with the coordination regulations under part 41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations ... applicable ... [under Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973].\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 12134(b).  Accordingly, the regulations that the Department of Justice promulgated under Title II are patterned after the section 504 coordination regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Title II was enacted with broad language and directed the Department of Justice to promulgate regulations as set forth above, the regulations which the Department promulgated are entitled to substantial deference.  Blum v. Bacon, 457 U.S. 132, 141, 102 S.Ct. 2355, 2361, 72 L.Ed.2d 728 (1982).  (\"[T]he interpretation of [the] agency charged with the administration of [this] statute is entitled to substantial deference.\")  \"[C]onsiderable weight should be accorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer.\"  Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  Unless the regulations are \"arbitrary, capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute\", the agency's regulations are \"given controlling weight\".  Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., 467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, because Congress mandated that the ADA regulations be patterned after the section 504 coordination regulations, the former regulations have the force of law.  When Congress re-enacts a statute and voices its approval of an administrative interpretation of that statute, that interpretation acquires the force of law and courts are bound by the regulation.  United States v. Board of Comm'rs of Sheffield, Alabama, 435 U.S. 110, 134, 98 S.Ct. 965, 980, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978).  The same is true when Congress agrees with an administrative interpretation of a statute which Congress is re-enacting.  See Don E. Williams Co. v. Commissioner, 429 U.S. 569, 574-77, 97 S.Ct. 850, 854-55, 51 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977).  Although Title II of the ADA is not a re-enactment of section 504, it does extend section 504's anti-discrimination principles to public entities.  Furthermore, the legislative history of the ADA shows that Congress agreed with the coordination regulations promulgated under section 504.  See, e.g., S.Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 44 (1989) (\"The first purpose of [Title II] is to make applicable the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability, currently set out in regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, to ... state and local governments....\");  H.R.Rep. No. 485(III), 101st Cong., 2d.  Sess. 50.  (\"The general prohibitions set forth in the section 504 regulations are applicable to all programs and activities in Title II\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Idell S.'s challenge to DPW's treatment of her is based upon 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.130(d).  That ADA regulation states that:  \"A public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\"   This regulation is almost identical to the section 504 integration regulation which has been in effect since 1981.  See 28 C.F.R. Sec. 41.51(d) (1981).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  As Congress has voiced its approval of that coordination regulation, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.130(d) has the force of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In enacting the ADA, Congress found that \"[h]istorically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and ... such forms of discrimination ... continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101(a)(2) (emphasis added).  Congress also concluded that \"[i]ndividuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including ... segregation....\", 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101(a)(5) (emphasis added).  The House Report on the ADA noted that:  \"Unlike the other titles in this Act, title II does not list all of the forms of discrimination that the title is intended to prohibit.   Therefore, the purpose of [section 204] is to direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth the forms of discrimination prohibited.\"   H.R.Rep.

Our holding in Clark is not based upon the ADA nor section 504, but upon the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  There, a forty-five year old, mentally retarded woman had been committed to a state-run mental institution since she was fifteen years old.  She filed a complaint against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the County of Philadelphia alleging various Constitutional violations as well as a violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  She alleged that her confinement was illegal and sought placement in a community-living arrangement supervised by the County of Philadelphia.  Clark based her Rehabilitation Act claim upon the fact that the Commonwealth was providing community living arrangements to persons with disabilities similar to hers while requiring her to remain in an institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Clark had not established disability-based discrimination, but ruled that her confinement was unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> 7]  Clark v. Cohen, 613 F.Supp. 684, 696-705 (E.D.Pa.1985).  In affirming the district court's judgment we stated \"[s]ection 504 prohibits discrimination against the handicapped in federally funded programs[,] [i]t imposes no affirmative obligations on the states to furnish services.\"  Clark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d at 85, n. 3.   However, we were not there concerned with the integration mandate of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  Plaintiff in Clark relied primarily upon section 504 and 45 C.F.R. Secs. 84.4(b)(1)(i)-(iv).  The prohibitions contained in the later regulations are under a regulation which states \"Discriminatory actions prohibited.\"  45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.4(b)(1).  That regulation does not state that the actions set forth are prohibited per se.  Rather, it states that recipients of federal funds may not engage in the enumerated acts \"on the basis of handicap.\"  45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.4(b)(1).  Thus, the section 504 inquiry in Clark had to include a determination of the basis for the allegedly discriminatory actions.  The language of 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.130(d) is very different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we note that the court in Williams was troubled by difficulties of proof that are not present here.  The plaintiffs in Williams had attempted to use a statistical analysis to establish that disabled persons were more likely to be adversely affected by the state's policy than non-disabled persons.  The court rejected that proof stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>The plaintiffs' use of a system-wide percentage of DMH clients ... ignores the fact that the ADA does not mandate particular system-wide percentages for allocations of community placements.

A mere percentage, standing alone, does not establish a presumption of inappropriate placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., at 414 Mass. 551, 557-58, 609 N.E.2d 447, 453.

The court stated that \"any interpretation of the ADA must consider the same practicalities that the United States Supreme Court acknowledged in its examination of the Federal Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Alexander v. Choate, ... \".  Id. at 557, 609 N.E.2d at 453 (citations omitted).  Choate did not involve 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.130(d).  The claim there was based upon plaintiffs' assertion that Tennessee's planned cutbacks in Medicaid reimbursement for in-patient hospital stays would disproportionately disadvantage handicapped persons in violation of section 504.  However, to the extent that Choate is relevant to our analysis, it supports our holding that Congress did not intend to condition the protection of the ADA upon a finding of \"discrimination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Choate, the Supreme Court emphasized the factors which led to enactment of section 504.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>Discrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congress to be most often the product, not of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference--of benign neglect.   Thus, Representative Vanik, introducing the predecessor to Sec. 504 in the House described the treatment of the handicapped as one of the country's 'shameful oversights' which caused the handicapped to live among society 'shunted aside, hidden, and ignored.'   Similarly, Senator Humphrey ... asserted that, 'we can no longer tolerate the invisibility of the handicapped in America....'  And Senator Cranston ... described the Act as a response to 'previous societal neglect' ... Federal agencies and commentators on the plight of the handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is primarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">469 U.S. at 295, 105 S.Ct. at 717-18 (emphasis added) (citations and footnotes omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the ADA evolved from an attempt to remedy the effects of \"benign neglect\" resulting from the \"invisibility\" of the disabled, Congress could not have intended to limit the Act's protections and prohibitions to circumstances involving deliberate discrimination.  Such discrimination arises from \"affirmative animus\" which was not the focus of the ADA or section 504.  The Supreme Court elaborates upon this distinction noting that, although discrimination against the disabled normally results from \"thoughtlessness\" and \"indifference,\" not \"invidious animus\", such \"animus\" did exist.  469 U.S. at 295 n. 12, 105 S.Ct. at 717 n. 12.  (\"To be sure, well-cataloged instances of invidious discrimination against the handicapped do exist\").  However, that was not the focus of section 504, or the ADA.  Rather, the ADA attempts to eliminate the effects of that \"benign neglect,\" \"apathy,\" and \"indifference.\"   The 504 coordination regulations, and the ADA \"make clear that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities in the provision of public services is itself a form of discrimination within the meaning of those statutes, independent of the discrimination that arises when individuals with disabilities receive different services than those provided to individuals without disabilities.\"   Brief of Amicus at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA is intended to insure that qualified individuals receive services in a manner consistent with basic human dignity rather than a manner which shunts them aside, hides, and ignores them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  \"[M]uch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing the Rehabilitation Act [and the ADA] would be difficult if not impossible to reach were the Act[s] construed to proscribe only conduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.\"  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. at 296-97, 105 S.Ct. at 718.   Thus, we will not eviscerate the ADA by conditioning its protections upon a finding of intentional or overt \"discrimination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DPW quotes Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 548, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 1382, 99 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988) to argue that there can be no improper discrimination here because the services at issue are only provided to persons with disabilities.  See Brief of Appellee at 25-6.  However, Traynor is easily distinguished.  Traynor concerned the legality of 38 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1662 which allowed for an extension of time to use veteran's benefits if a disability precluded the veteran from using the benefits within the time frame established by law.  However, the veteran only qualified if he/she could establish \"a physical or mental disorder which was not the result of [his/her] own willful misconduct.\"  Id. at 535, 108 S.Ct. at 1372.   Traynor was an honorably discharged veteran who suffered from alcoholism unrelated to any psychiatric disorder.  Under applicable V.A. regulations, such alcoholism was defined as \"willful misconduct\" thus precluding him from relying upon his \"disorder\" to enlarge the period of time that he could use his benefits.  Traynor challenged this limitation on behalf of himself, and other similarly situated veterans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying the claim, the court noted that section 504 had been part of the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act which were passed in 1978 and which extended the scope of that legislation to \"any program or activity conducted by any Executive Agency.\"  Id. at 547, 108 S.Ct. at 1381.   The court noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>petitioners can prevail under the Rehabilitation Act claim only if the 1978 legislation can be deemed to have implicitly repealed the willful misconduct provision of the 1977 legislation or forbade the Veterans' Administration to classify primary alcoholism as willful misconduct.  They must thereby overcome the cardinal rule ... that repeals by implication are not favored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citations and internal quotes omitted).  The court reasoned that it was not at liberty to assume that the subsequent enactment of the Rehabilitation Act implicitly repealed the prior act unless \"such a construction is absolutely necessary ... in order that [the] words [of the latter statute] shall have any meaning at all.\"  Id. (brackets in original).  These two enactments were \"capable of co-existence\" as the \"willful misconduct\" provision did not undermine the central purpose of section 504.  That purpose was to \"assure that handicapped individuals receive 'evenhanded treatment' in relation to nonhandicapped individuals.\"  Id. at 548, 108 S.Ct. at 1382 (citing Alexander v. Choate ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then noted that the program at issue did not treat handicapped persons less favorably than nonhandicapped persons as only handicapped persons could apply for an extension of time.  \"In other words Sec. 1662(a)(1) merely provides a special benefit to disabled veterans who bear no responsibility for their disabilities that is not provided to other disabled veterans or to any able-bodied veterans.\"  Id.  The court then stated \"[t]here is nothing in the Rehabilitation Act that requires that any benefit extended to one category of handicapped persons also be extended to all other categories of handicapped persons.\"  Id.  However, the court was not concerned with the application of the integration mandate, or anything analogous to it, and the holding is not germane to our analysis.  As noted above, Congress has stated that \"discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as ... institutionalization.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101(3).  If Congress were only concerned about disparate treatment of the disabled as compared to their nondisabled counterparts, this statement would be a non sequitur as only disabled persons are institutionalized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DPW also relies upon Johnson v.

(\"[W]here the handicapping condition is related to the condition(s) being treated, it will rarely, if ever, be possible to say ... that a particular decision was 'discriminatory' \") (citation omitted).  See Brief of Appellee at 7.  Johnson is also inapposite.  There, the court was asked to hold that different levels of medical treatment given to differently classified infants affected with spina bifida violated section 504.  The case did not involve any claim that the integration mandate of 504 or the ADA had been violated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DPW also attempts to defeat Idell S.'s claim by labelling it a claim for \"community care\" or \"deinstitutionalization\"--something which the ADA does not require.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  See Brief of Appellee at 10.  Idell S. is not asserting a right to community care or deinstitutionalization per se.  She properly concedes that DPW is under no obligation to provide her with any care at all.

The Court disagreed and held that section 504 imposes no obligation to engage in \"affirmative action.\"  Id. at 411, 99 S.Ct. at 2369.   In Choate, the Court explained that \"affirmative action\" as used in Davis \"[r]eferred to those 'changes,' 'adjustments,' or 'modifications' to existing programs that would be 'substantial' or that would constitute 'fundamental alteration[s]' in the nature of a program ...,' rather than to those changes that would be reasonable accommodations.\"  (citations omitted).

The only explanation DPW has offered for this position is its assertion that funding for nursing home and attendant care for fiscal year 1993-1994 has already been appropriated by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania and that it cannot, under state constitutional law, shift funds from the nursing care appropriation to attendant care.

It is not now up to us to invent a funding mechanism whereby the Commonwealth can properly finance its nursing home and attendant care programs.

DPW can not rely upon a funding mechanism of the General Assembly to justify administering its attendant care program in a manner that discriminates and then argue that it can not comply with the ADA without fundamentally altering its program.  We dismissed a similar contention in Delaware Valley Citizen's Council for Clean Air v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 678 F.2d 470 (3rd Cir.1982).  There, plaintiff sought to hold certain members of the executive branch of state government in contempt for failing to comply with a consent decree in which the officials had agreed to establish an admissions inspection program.

Sec. 12132, by the manner in which it operates its attendant care and nursing home programs.  Idell S. alleges that DPW is violating the ADA by requiring that she receive required care services in the segregated setting of a nursing home rather than through DPW's attendant care program.  That program would allow her to receive those services in her own home where she could reside with her children.  The district court ruled that DPW is not violating the ADA because it is not discriminating against Idell S.  For the reasons that follow we will reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 1994, Idell S. filed an uncontested motion to join a lawsuit which had previously been filed by Beverly D., and Ilene F., who were also nursing home residents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The suit alleged that DPW had violated Title II of the ADA by providing services in a nursing home rather than in the \"most integrated setting appropriate\" to the plaintiffs' needs, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Beverly D. and Ilene F. filed for an uncontested voluntary dismissal of their claim because they had been discharged from the nursing home.  At the same time, Idell S. moved for summary judgment based upon an Amended Stipulation of Facts.  Prior to ruling on the joinder and voluntary dismissal motions, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order dated January 27, 1994, granting summary judgment against Beverly D. and Ilene F. and in favor of DPW.  On February 2, 1994, the district court issued an Order dismissing Beverly D. and Ilene F. as plaintiffs and adding Idell S. as a plaintiff.  The court also ruled that \"[f]or the reasons stated in the Memorandum filed January 27, 1994, the motion for summary judgment of Idell S. is denied and judgment is entered in favor of defendants and against ...

Idell S. uses a wheelchair for locomotion and requires assistance with certain activities of daily living including bathing, laundry, shopping, getting in and out of bed, and house cleaning.  She is able to cook, dress herself (except for her shoes and socks), attend to her personal hygiene (using a transfer board to access the toilet) and to her grooming.  The parties agree that, although Idell S. is not capable of fully independent living, she is not so incapacitated that she needs the custodial care of a nursing home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DPW operates two different programs that provide physically disabled persons with assistance in daily living.  DPW funds nursing home residence through the Medical Assistance program (\"Medicaid\"), and it operates an \"attendant care program\" under 62 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. Secs. 3051-3055 (the \"Care Act\").  The attendant care program provides \"[t]hose basic and ancillary services which enable an individual [with physical disabilities] to live in his[/her] home and community rather than in an institution and to carry out functions of daily living, self care and mobility.\"   62 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. Secs. 3052, 3054.  DPW's average cost of caring for a person in a nursing home is $45,000 per year.  The Commonwealth pays 44% of this amount ($19,800) and the difference ($24,200) is paid by the federal government.  DPW's average cost of caring for a person in the attendant care program is $10,500 per year.

In affirming the district court's judgment we stated \"[s]ection 504 prohibits discrimination against the handicapped in federally funded programs[,] [i]t imposes no affirmative obligations on the states to furnish services.\"  Clark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d at 85, n. 3.   However, we were not there concerned with the integration mandate of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  Plaintiff in Clark relied primarily upon section 504 and 45 C.F.R. Secs. 84.4(b)(1)(i)-(iv).  The prohibitions contained in the later regulations are under a regulation which states \"Discriminatory actions prohibited.\"  45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.4(b)(1).  That regulation does not state that the actions set forth are prohibited per se.  Rather, it states that recipients of federal funds may not engage in the enumerated acts \"on the basis of handicap.\"  45 C.F.R. Sec. 84.4(b)(1).  Thus, the section 504 inquiry in Clark had to include a determination of the basis for the allegedly discriminatory actions.  The language of 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.130(d) is very different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we note that the court in Williams was troubled by difficulties of proof that are not present here.

The court stated that \"any interpretation of the ADA must consider the same practicalities that the United States Supreme Court acknowledged in its examination of the Federal Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Alexander v. Choate, ... \".  Id. at 557, 609 N.E.2d at 453 (citations omitted).  Choate did not involve 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.130(d).  The claim there was based upon plaintiffs' assertion that Tennessee's planned cutbacks in Medicaid reimbursement for in-patient hospital stays would disproportionately disadvantage handicapped persons in violation of section 504.  However, to the extent that Choate is relevant to our analysis, it supports our holding that Congress did not intend to condition the protection of the ADA upon a finding of \"discrimination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Choate, the Supreme Court emphasized the factors which led to enactment of section 504.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>Discrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congress to be most often the product, not of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference--of benign neglect.   Thus, Representative Vanik, introducing the predecessor to Sec. 504 in the House described the treatment of the handicapped as one of the country's 'shameful oversights' which caused the handicapped to live among society 'shunted aside, hidden, and ignored.'   Similarly, Senator Humphrey ... asserted that, 'we can no longer tolerate the invisibility of the handicapped in America....'  And Senator Cranston ... described the Act as a response to 'previous societal neglect' ... Federal agencies and commentators on the plight of the handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is primarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">469 U.S. at 295, 105 S.Ct. at 717-18 (emphasis added) (citations and footnotes omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the ADA evolved from an attempt to remedy the effects of \"benign neglect\" resulting from the \"invisibility\" of the disabled, Congress could not have intended to limit the Act's protections and prohibitions to circumstances involving deliberate discrimination.  Such discrimination arises from \"affirmative animus\" which was not the focus of the ADA or section 504.  The Supreme Court elaborates upon this distinction noting that, although discrimination against the disabled normally results from \"thoughtlessness\" and \"indifference,\" not \"invidious animus\", such \"animus\" did exist.  469 U.S. at 295 n. 12, 105 S.Ct. at 717 n. 12.  (\"To be sure, well-cataloged instances of invidious discrimination against the handicapped do exist\").  However, that was not the focus of section 504, or the ADA.  Rather, the ADA attempts to eliminate the effects of that \"benign neglect,\" \"apathy,\" and \"indifference.\"   The 504 coordination regulations, and the ADA \"make clear that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities in the provision of public services is itself a form of discrimination within the meaning of those statutes, independent of the discrimination that arises when individuals with disabilities receive different services than those provided to individuals without disabilities.\"   Brief of Amicus at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA is intended to insure that qualified individuals receive services in a manner consistent with basic human dignity rather than a manner which shunts them aside, hides, and ignores them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  \"[M]uch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing the Rehabilitation Act [and the ADA] would be difficult if not impossible to reach were the Act[s] construed to proscribe only conduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.\"  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. at 296-97, 105 S.Ct. at 718.

See Brief of Appellee at 25-6.  However, Traynor is easily distinguished.  Traynor concerned the legality of 38 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1662 which allowed for an extension of time to use veteran's benefits if a disability precluded the veteran from using the benefits within the time frame established by law.  However, the veteran only qualified if he/she could establish \"a physical or mental disorder which was not the result of [his/her] own willful misconduct.\"  Id. at 535, 108 S.Ct. at 1372.   Traynor was an honorably discharged veteran who suffered from alcoholism unrelated to any psychiatric disorder.  Under applicable V.A. regulations, such alcoholism was defined as \"willful misconduct\" thus precluding him from relying upon his \"disorder\" to enlarge the period of time that he could use his benefits.  Traynor challenged this limitation on behalf of himself, and other similarly situated veterans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying the claim, the court noted that section 504 had been part of the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act which were passed in 1978 and which extended the scope of that legislation to \"any program or activity conducted by any Executive Agency.\"  Id. at 547, 108 S.Ct. at 1381.   The court noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>petitioners can prevail under the Rehabilitation Act claim only if the 1978 legislation can be deemed to have implicitly repealed the willful misconduct provision of the 1977 legislation or forbade the Veterans' Administration to classify primary alcoholism as willful misconduct.  They must thereby overcome the cardinal rule ... that repeals by implication are not favored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citations and internal quotes omitted).  The court reasoned that it was not at liberty to assume that the subsequent enactment of the Rehabilitation Act implicitly repealed the prior act unless \"such a construction is absolutely necessary ... in order that [the] words [of the latter statute] shall have any meaning at all.\"  Id. (brackets in original).  These two enactments were \"capable of co-existence\" as the \"willful misconduct\" provision did not undermine the central purpose of section 504.  That purpose was to \"assure that handicapped individuals receive 'evenhanded treatment' in relation to nonhandicapped individuals.\"  Id. at 548, 108 S.Ct. at 1382 (citing Alexander v. Choate ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then noted that the program at issue did not treat handicapped persons less favorably than nonhandicapped persons as only handicapped persons could apply for an extension of time.  \"In other words Sec. 1662(a)(1) merely provides a special benefit to disabled veterans who bear no responsibility for their disabilities that is not provided to other disabled veterans or to any able-bodied veterans.\"  Id.  The court then stated \"[t]here is nothing in the Rehabilitation Act that requires that any benefit extended to one category of handicapped persons also be extended to all other categories of handicapped persons.\"  Id.  However, the court was not concerned with the application of the integration mandate, or anything analogous to it, and the holding is not germane to our analysis.  As noted above, Congress has stated that \"discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as ... institutionalization.\"  42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101(3).  If Congress were only concerned about disparate treatment of the disabled as compared to their nondisabled counterparts, this statement would be a non sequitur as only disabled persons are institutionalized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DPW also relies upon Johnson v.

It is not now up to us to invent a funding mechanism whereby the Commonwealth can properly finance its nursing home and attendant care programs.
