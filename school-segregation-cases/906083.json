Michael Howard and Shannon Poole were awarded a four-million-dollar jury verdict\n\nagainst InTown,1 an extended-stay motel, for injuries each sustained as victims of an armed\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      InTown Lessee Associates, LLC, InTown Lessee Services, LLC, IT Tenants RBS,\nLLC, and Timothy Tucker will collectively be referred to as “InTown.”\n\frobbery in the motel. Aggrieved, InTown appealed. Finding no error, this Court affirms the\n\ntrial court’s judgment.\n\n                                           Facts\n\n¶2.    Michael Keith Howard and Shannon Poole had rented a room at InTown in June 2008,\n\nwhere the couple temporarily resided while waiting for a home to become available in\n\nBelhaven, a residential area in Jackson, Mississippi. On June 27, 2008, at approximately\n\n9:30 p.m., Howard left the motel room to take his dog for a walk. As he was returning to the\n\nroom, three men burst through the door, demanded money from the couple, and ransacked\n\nthe room. One of the assailants hit Howard in the face with a hand gun, then pointed the gun\n\nat Poole’s head and demanded money. Howard and Poole denied having money in the room.\n\nUndeterred, one of the assailants flipped the mattress off the bed, while Poole was on top of\n\nthe mattress, causing her to be pushed against a wall. The men found between $700 and\n\n$900 under the mattress. The assailants took the money, Howard’s and Poole’s drivers’\n\nlicenses, and Poole’s cell phone. Following the altercation, Howard and Poole were treated\n\nfor various injuries that each had sustained during the attack. Initially, Howard was treated\n\nfor broken bones in his face and numerous contusions and lacerations to his body. Prior to\n\ntrial, Howard had to undergo facial reconstructive surgery. Poole sustained contusions and\n\nbruises in the attack, followed by soreness and severe psychological damage. Howard and\n\nPoole were under the continuing care of physicians and psychiatrists. No arrests were made\n\nin connection with the armed robbery and physical assaults.\n\n¶3.    Howard and Poole filed their joint complaint against the defendants on July 18, 2008,\n\nalleging: (1) that they were invitees of InTown; (2) that they were seriously injured because\n\n\n                                             2\n\fthe defendants had failed to fulfill their joint, several, and collective duties to use reasonable\n\ncare and to take adequate and reasonable security precautions or measures to protect invitees\n\nof InTown, including the plaintiffs, from foreseeable harm and danger, including the harm\n\nsuffered by Plaintiffs; (3) that, before June 27, 2008, InTown knew or should have known\n\nthat it had inadequate security, that strangers, trespassers and loiterers frequently came onto\n\nits property, that the wooden fence surrounding part of its property was in disrepair, that the\n\nlocks on the guest room doors were not working properly, and that the property was not\n\nreasonably safe; (4) that InTown had failed to remedy or repair the unsafe conditions and\n\ninadequacies of the property; (5) that InTown had a duty to the plaintiffs to make sure that\n\nthe facilities, including all common areas, as well as guest rooms, were secure, safe, and fit\n\nfor their particular purposes, that reasonable security measures were provided and\n\nmaintained, that the property, including the fences surrounding part of the property and the\n\nlocks on all guest room doors, were properly maintained, and that general upkeep of the\n\nproperty was performed; (6) that InTown had specific control and authority to make\n\nmanagement decisions material to the personal safety and security of the plaintiffs; (7) that\n\nInTown had specific control and authority to make management decisions pertaining to the\n\nhiring, firing, and suspension of employees or security at the motel; (8) that InTown’s agents\n\nand/or employees had warranted and/or covenanted that the property where Howard and\n\nPoole were staying as invitees was secure, safe, fit for its particular purpose, properly\n\nmaintained, under proper upkeep, and reasonable security measures were provided and\n\nmaintained for the plaintiffs, that security would be adequate to both protect the room where\n\nthe plaintiffs were staying, as well as control and maintain the property and enforce security\n\n                                                3\n\fprocedures, including but not limited to stopping loiterers and trespassers from entering the\n\nproperty and/or removing trespassers and loiterers from the property; (9) that InTown had\n\nfailed to provide adequate first aid to the plaintiffs and had failed to instruct its employees\n\non providing first aid to the plaintiffs; and (10) that InTown had failed to warn Howard and\n\nPoole of the atmosphere of violence that existed on and around the property, had failed to\n\nprovide notice of the prior crimes occurring on and around the property, and had failed to\n\nwarn the plaintiffs of the previous assaults and robberies occurring on and around the\n\nproperty.\n\n¶4.    Trial commenced on September 21, 2009, and the jury returned a general verdict in\n\nfavor of Howard and Poole on September 23, 2009.\n\n¶5.    Numerous Jackson police officers testified at trial regarding calls for service at\n\nInTown. One officer had been called to InTown Suites as many as thirty times to respond\n\nto “armed robberies, auto burglaries, car jackings, just auto thefts; different things of that\n\nnature . . . primarily major crimes.” The officer had advised the manager of InTown that the\n\ncrime problem on the property could be eliminated by hiring professional security.\n\n¶6.    A lieutenant with the Jackson Police Department testified that “InTown Suites . . . had\n\na number of problems on their property. Specifically they’ve had robberies. They’ve had\n\nburglaries. Cars have been stolen. There’s prostitution, drugs on the property; just anything\n\nyou can think of.” The lieutenant testified that he was “advised that [InTown] had a courtesy\n\nofficer. He was not a security officer, nor a security guard . . . . [T]he difference is a\n\ncourtesy officer, he was not armed and was not properly trained to handle any type situations\n\nthat would come up. He was only to call the police . . . if he saw something there on the\n\n\n                                              4\n\fproperty criminal in nature.” The lieutenant also testified that he had told the manager of\n\nInTown that off-duty officers “would be more than willing to come out there and work off\n\nduty after we got off work to patrol the property . . . .” The lieutenant further testified that\n\nhe had instructed the manager that InTown should be informing its customers of the problems\n\nthat had been occurring on the property, and that the manager had indicated that InTown\n\nwould have no customers if such a warning were given.\n\n¶7.    Another officer testified that he was a part of the “delta strike force,” which the\n\nJackson Police Department had formed in an effort to deter crimes along the Interstate 55\n\ncorridor. He testified that InTown Suites was a target area that the delta strike force was to\n\npatrol. He explained that the delta strike force’s duty was to “go through [InTown’s] parking\n\nlot, make sure there was no cars broke into, no illegal happenings on the streets or on the\n\nproperty itself. Mostly we were there to try to answer calls and be quick as possible in\n\nresponding to calls that may happen at InTown Suites or other locations.” He also testified\n\nthat, when the task force was on InTown property, no criminal activity transpired. He further\n\ntestified that he had informed the manager of InTown that there was a crime problem on its\n\nproperty and that “they should try to go ahead and get a professionally trained security\n\nservice” to solve the crime problem on the property.\n\n¶8.    Charles Campbell, the property manager of InTown Suites in Jackson on the date that\n\nHoward and Poole were attacked in their room, testified that one of InTown’s duties was “to\n\nensure that customers were provided adequate protection from crime that would occur on the\n\nproperty.” He also testified that he was in contact with his regional manager on a daily basis\n\nand that he often informed regional and corporate officials that there was a crime problem\n\n\n                                               5\n\fat the Jackson property. Campbell testified that he had asked his regional manager to provide\n\nsecurity at the Jackson location of InTown Suites on more than one occasion, and that the\n\nregional manager always had told him that InTown had insufficient funds to hire armed\n\nsecurity.\n\n¶9.    Several expert witnesses also were called to testify. Kenneth Goodrum, a commander\n\nwith the Jackson Police Department, was accepted without objection as a plaintiffs’ expert\n\n“in the area of security with emphasis in the area of premises.” Commander Goodrum\n\ntestified that he had reviewed “all the documentation and the evidence that was given to\n\n[him,] as well as the depositions and offense reports” in this case. Commander Goodrum had\n\ncompleted a crime history report of the Jackson location of InTown, and was able to\n\ndetermine that, in the two-and-a-half-year period prior to Howard and Poole’s injuries, “eight\n\narmed robberies, 32 auto thefts, 55 auto burglaries, six hold-up alarms, 15 simple assaults .\n\n. . three armed robberies of businesses, four men with a gun, two vandalisms, 48 disturbances\n\nand 12 threats” had occurred on the property of InTown. Without objection, Commander\n\nGoodrum testified that the assault of Michael Howard and Shannon Poole “was preventable.\n\nAnd my opinion is that if they would have hired off-duty police officers or armed security\n\nguards to patrol that parking lot and patrol their property, it would have been able to be\n\nprevented.”\n\n¶10.   Plaintiffs deposed David Groves, a regional director of operations for InTown.\n\nGroves testified that approximately twelve InTown properties have armed security on the\n\nproperty, and that the decision to provide armed security guards at a particular property is\n\ndecided on a case-by-case basis. Groves said that the general manager would have to request\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthat armed security be provided, and then the decision to provide security personnel would\n\nbe up to InTown’s corporate officials. Part of Groves’s deposition was read into the record\n\nat trial. InTown objected, but the trial court reasoned that “it still is a part of that testimony\n\nwhich shows notice with reference – and it goes to the issue of foreseeability, which is an\n\nissue in this case. And I think it probably deals with the issue of security in its entirety. As\n\nsuch, I’m going to allow the testimony with reference to . . . Groves.”\n\n¶11.   The plaintiffs offered an economist, who testified regarding Poole’s claim for future\n\nloss of wages. The economist opined that Poole’s future loss of income ranged from\n\n$574,209 to $1,922,589. InTown did not object at trial to the testimony or methodology of\n\nthe economist. Dinesh Goel, M.D., a board-certified general surgeon and accepted expert\n\nin the fields of general surgery and family medicine, testified at trial. Dr. Goel had treated\n\nboth Howard and Poole for their injuries sustained after being attacked at InTown. Dr. Goel\n\ntestified that Howard was treated for a fractured cheek bone and orbit bone of his left eye,\n\nwhich required multiple surgeries. Dr. Goel did not perform Howard’s surgeries; however,\n\nhe had reviewed the surgical records. Dr. Goel further testified that Howard would need\n\nadditional surgeries to correct those injuries completely. Dr. Goel said that the estimated cost\n\nof Howard’s future surgery would be between $5,000 and $8,000.\n\n¶12.   Dr. Goel testified that, in addition to Howard’s badly broken cheek bone and orbit\n\nbone, he had suffered a broken jaw, a head injury, and a bulging disk. Additionally, Howard\n\nhad suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the attack at InTown. As a result of\n\nhis injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, Howard had headaches, nightmares, sleep loss,\n\nand exhibited symptoms of depression, for which Dr. Goel had referred Howard to a\n\n\n                                                7\n\fpsychiatrist for treatment. Dr. Goel further testified that he did not “expect [Howard’s\n\nsymptoms] to get cured, but they’re going to wax and [wane]. They’re going to get better\n\nat times, they’re going to get worse at times, but he’s going to live with it.”\n\n¶13.   Regarding Dr. Goel’s future treatment of Howard, he testified that Howard would\n\n“need a follow-up on a monthly basis and even quarterly later on,” and that the cost of that\n\ntreatment would be approximately $3,000 to $4,000 per year, plus the cost of medications.\n\n¶14.   Dr. Goel testified that Poole had suffered head, back, and neck injuries as a result of\n\nbeing attacked at InTown on June 27, 2008. He said that he initially had treated her with\n\npain medications, and later referred her to a psychiatrist for treatment of her post-traumatic\n\nstress disorder, headaches, nightmares, and sleep loss. Dr. Goel said that Poole would need\n\nto have medical follow-ups on a regular basis, and that the future cost of her medical care\n\nwould be approximately $1,000 to $2,000 per year. Further, Dr. Goel said that her condition\n\nis “going to wax and [wane], but it’s not going to go away. It’s been more than a year she’s\n\nbeen hurting and suffering with it. I think she’s going to stay with it.”\n\n¶15.   Krishan Gupta, M.D., a psychiatrist, treated Howard and Poole for post-traumatic\n\nstress disorder. Dr. Gupta testified that his initial diagnosis of Howard was “adjustment\n\ndisorder and acute stress disorder. As time progresses, we can find the signs and symptoms\n\nof post traumatic stress disorder. And we gave a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder.”\n\nDr. Gupta also testified that Howard was “doing a little better, but still needs continuous\n\npsychotherapy and medication management.” Dr. Gupta further testified that post-traumatic\n\nstress disorder “is a psychological scar in the brain. This will not go away. It’s not a\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fphysical injury you can see like [Howard’s] face was reconstructed, but psychological cannot\n\nbe. So they’re going to be there as long as [Howard] is living on this earth.”\n\n¶16.   Dr. Gupta said that “in the initial evaluation [Poole] was very anxious, so I gave her\n\na diagnosis of acute stress disorder. As the time progressed as we understand more about\n\n[Poole], we gave a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder later on.” Dr. Gupta said that\n\nPoole had suffered from panic attacks, but that most of the panic attacks were from her post-\n\ntraumatic stress disorder. Further, Dr. Gupta testified that Poole was “not making much\n\nprogress. She needs more counseling, and she needs more intensive therapies which will\n\nhelp her to come out and function like [Howard] is doing right now. [Howard] is holding a\n\njob at this time. [Poole] is not able to do that at this time at all.” He also said that Poole\n\nwould need continued treatment with medication.\n\n¶17.   Dr. Gupta testified that, over the lifetime of both Howard and Poole, the cost of each\n\nindividual’s psychiatric treatment would be, at a minimum, $500,000.\n\n¶18.   At the close of the plaintiffs’ case-in-chief, InTown rested without presenting\n\nevidence. The jury returned a general verdict in the amount of $2,000,000 for Howard and\n\n$2,000,000 for Poole.\n\n                                           Issues\n\n¶19.   On appeal, InTown raises the following issues:\n\n       I.     Whether the trial court erred in denying InTown’s motion for directed\n              verdict and motion for JNOV.\n       II.    Whether InTown owed a duty to Plaintiffs to warn them of the alleged\n              generalized “atmosphere of violence” on and around the Jackson\n              property.\n       III.   Whether the cumulative effect of the admission of irrelevant and\n              inadmissible evidence was highly prejudicial to InTown.\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       IV.    Whether the trial court erred by refusing InTown’s comparative\n              negligence instructions.\n       V.     Whether the trial court failed to comply with the statutory cap on\n              noneconomic damages; alternatively, whether the trial court erred in\n              denying InTown’s request for remittitur.\n\n                                          Discussion\n\nI.     Whether the trial court erred in denying InTown’s motion for directed verdict and\n       motion for JNOV.\n\n¶20.   At the close of all of the evidence, InTown moved for a directed verdict on the issue\n\nof causation. InTown began its argument with the following statement: “I realize the\n\nplaintiffs have established a duty was owed, and that’s admitted. But I believe the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to establish . . . that regardless of security that was present or regardless of any\n\nactions that were taken, the plaintiff failed to show that any additional security or any\n\nadditional acts could have prevented the event from happening.” The trial court denied\n\nInTown’s motion for directed verdict. InTown filed a post-trial “Motion for Judgment\n\nNotwithstanding the Verdict, or in the alternative, Motion for a New Trial, or, in the\n\nalternative, Motion for a Remittitur and/or Motion to Amend the Verdict,” arguing that “[t]he\n\njury’s verdict reflected a finding that the alleged inadequacy of security was the proximate\n\ncause of the Plaintiffs’ [injuries]” because “the evidence presented at trial failed to establish\n\nthat this alleged inadequate security was the sole cause of the subject incident.” The trial\n\ncourt denied InTown’s post-trial motion.\n\n¶21.   On appeal, InTown argues that Howard and Poole “failed to meet their burden to\n\nestablish that the proximate cause of their assault was the failure of InTown to employ an\n\narmed, off-duty JPD officer to provide security at the Jackson property.” InTown argues that\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fthe plaintiffs “were required to proffer sufficient evidence to establish that the failure of\n\nInTown to employ an armed, off-duty JPD officer was a substantial factor in bringing about\n\ntheir injuries, and had InTown employed an armed, off-duty JPD officer the harm would not\n\nhave occurred.” Further, InTown alleges that “[t]he only record evidence on the issue of\n\nwhether InTown’s failure to employ an armed, off-duty officer was the proximate cause of\n\nPlaintiffs’ assault is the conclusory statement of Plaintiffs’ proffered ‘expert’ JPD Officer\n\nKenneth Goodrum.” InTown argues that the plaintiffs failed to meet that burden; therefore,\n\nit was entitled to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We disagree and affirm the trial\n\ncourt on this issue.\n\n¶22.   “The standard of review for the denial of a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict (JNOV) is de novo.” U.S. Auto. Ass’n (USAA) v. Lisanby, 47 So. 3d 1172, 1176\n\n(Miss. 2010) (citing U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co. of Miss. v. Martin, 998 So. 2d 956, 964 (Miss.\n\n2008)). “A motion for JNOV is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence, and this\n\nCourt will affirm the denial of a JNOV if there is substantial evidence to support the verdict.”\n\nAdcock v. Miss. Transp. Comm’n, 981 So. 2d 942, 948 (Miss. 2008) (citing Johnson v. St.\n\nDominics-Jackson Mem’l Hosp., 967 So. 2d 20, 22 (Miss. 2007)). “This Court will consider\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee, giving the party the benefit of all\n\nfavorable inference[s] that may be reasonably drawn from the evidence.” Spotlite Skating\n\nRink, Inc. v. Barnes ex rel. Barnes, 988 So. 2d 364, 368 (Miss. 2008) (quoting Ala. Great\n\nS. R.R. Co. v. Lee, 826 So. 2d 1232, 1235 (Miss. 2002)). “In essence, judgments as a matter\n\nof law present both the trial court and the appellate court with the same question – whether\n\nthe evidence, as applied to the elements of a party’s case, is either so indisputable, or so\n\n                                              11\n\fdeficient, that the necessity of a trier of fact has been obviated.” USAA, 47 So. 3d at 1176\n\n(quoting White v. Stewman, 932 So. 2d 27, 32 (Miss. 2006)). “[T]his Court applies the same\n\nstandard of review as it applies when reviewing the denial of directed verdict or JNOV.”\n\nSolanki v. Ervin, 21 So. 3d 552, 557 (Miss. 2009).\n\n¶23.   The substantial evidence submitted by the plaintiffs was more than legally sufficient,\n\nand included a stipulation that InTown’s management and employees had been the victims\n\nof three armed robberies that had closely preceded these attacks.2 InTown rested without\n\ncalling a single witness to rebut the plaintiffs’ substantial lay and expert witness testimony.\n\nBy the presentation of their lay and expert witnesses, the plaintiffs had created a question\n\nsufficient for the jury’s determination. The evidence, as applied to the plaintiffs’ case, is not\n\n“so indisputable, or so deficient, that the necessity of a trier of fact has been obviated.”\n\nUSAA, 47 So. 3d at 1176.\n\nII.    Whether InTown owed a duty to the plaintiffs to warn them of the alleged generalized\n       “atmosphere of violence” on and around the Jackson property.\n\n¶24.   InTown argues for the first time on appeal that the trial court erred in giving a jury\n\ninstruction that provided that the jury could find against InTown if it found that InTown had\n\nfailed “to warn Michael Keith Howard and Shannon Poole of the existence of a known\n\ndangerous condition.”      InTown argues that Jury Instruction Number 11 “improperly\n\npermitted the jury to find InTown liable if the jury agreed with Plaintiffs’ novel theory and\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       These armed robberies occurred on November 6, 2007, January 3, 2008, and May\n23, 2008.\n\n                                               12\n\fbelieved that InTown breached a duty to warn Plaintiffs of the generalized ‘atmosphere of\n\nviolence’ on and around the Jackson property.”\n\n¶25.   This Court “has held that unless substantial rights are affected, issues not presented\n\nto the trial judge are procedurally barred from being raised for the first time on appeal.” Ill.\n\nCent. R.R. Co. v. Byrd, 44 So. 3d 943, 948 (Miss. 2010) (citing Dora v. State, 986 So. 2d\n\n917, 925 (Miss. 2008)).      Intown did not make a contemporaneous objection to jury\n\ninstruction number 11. InTown was afforded an opportunity to object to the plaintiffs’ theory\n\nof liability and supporting jury instruction before the trial court; however, InTown failed to\n\navail itself of that opportunity, and is procedurally barred from attempting to do so for the\n\nfirst time on appeal. Id.\n\nIII.   Whether the cumulative effect of the admission of irrelevant and inadmissible\n       evidence was highly prejudicial to InTown.\n\n¶26.   InTown argues that the “trial court erred in admitting testimony regarding (a) the\n\nprofitability of the Jackson property; (b) armed security provided by InTown at other\n\nlocations across the South without requiring Plaintiffs to lay a proper foundation that the\n\ncircumstances surrounding those other properties were similar to the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the Jackson property; and (c) the alleged motive/reason why InTown did not\n\nemploy an armed, off-duty JPD officer at the Jackson property.”\n\n¶27.   “The standard of review regarding admission or exclusion of evidence is abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Where error involves the admission or exclusion of evidence, this Court ‘will not\n\nreverse unless the error adversely affects a substantial right of a party.’” Whitten v. Cox, 799\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fSo. 2d 1, 13 (Miss. 2000) (quoting Floyd v. City of Crystal Springs, 749 So. 2d 110, 113\n\n(Miss. 1999)).\n\n       A.     Whether the trial court erred in allowing Howard and Poole to offer evidence\n              regarding the financial condition/profitability of the Jackson property.\n\n¶28.   InTown argues that it was highly prejudicial for the trial court to allow the plaintiffs\n\nto adduce testimony regarding the profitability of InTown for the year preceding the armed\n\nrobbery of Howard and Poole. However, InTown failed to make a contemporaneous\n\nobjection to this line of questioning at trial.3 Our longstanding case law is clear “that the\n\nfailure to make a contemporaneous objection to the evidence waives the issue on appeal.”\n\nHyundai Motor America v. Applewhite, 53 So. 3d 749, 755 (Miss. 2011). Because InTown\n\ndid not make a contemporaneous objection to the plaintiffs’ eliciting InTown’s profitability\n\nfor the year 2007, it is procedurally barred from pursuing the issue for the first time on\n\nappeal.\n\n       B.     Whether the trial court erred in allowing Howard and Poole to offer evidence\n              regarding armed security provided by InTown at other locations across the\n              South without requiring them to lay a proper foundation for such evidence.\n\n¶29.   Portions of the deposition of David Groves were read in the presence of the jury, over\n\nInTown’s objection. The trial court allowed the evidence to be presented to the jury,\n\nreasoning that “it still is a part of that testimony which shows notice with reference – and it\n\ngoes to the issue of foreseeability, which is an issue in this case. And I think it probably\n\ndeals with the issue of security in its entirety. As such, I’m going to allow the testimony with\n\nreference to . . . Groves.” Assuming, arguendo, that the admission of this evidence was in\n\n       3\n       InTown objected to plaintiffs’ counsel leading the witness during that line of\nquestioning, but failed to object to the substance of the questions and answers.\n\n                                              14\n\ferror, the remaining evidence of foreseeability and need for additional security was clearly\n\nestablished, and was not contested by the appellants.4 The admission of that portion of\n\nGroves’s deposition did not affect a substantial right belonging to InTown. See Whitten, 799\n\nSo. 2d at 13.\n\n       C.        Whether the trial court erred in allowing Howard and Poole to offer evidence\n                 regarding the alleged motive/reason why InTown did not employ an armed,\n                 off-duty JPD officer at the Jackson property.\n\n¶30.   InTown argues that plaintiffs’ counsel improperly argued that InTown’s motive for\n\nnot employing an armed security officer was because InTown did not want to provide the\n\nfunding for such an officer. InTown argues for the first time on appeal that plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel made inappropriate comments during opening arguments. InTown did not make a\n\ncontemporaneous objection to plaintiffs’ counsel’s opening argument.\n\n¶31.   InTown also complains of the following questions by plaintiffs’ counsel and Charlie\n\nCampbell’s responses:\n\n       Q.        Did [InTown’s regional manager] ever ask about security at the\n                 property?\n       A.        No. We talked about it, but I mean it really didn’t do any good to talk\n                 about it because the answer was always we don’t have the money.\n                 ...\n       Q.        What, if anything, did you ask from corporate after the second robbery?\n       A.        I asked if they could either get me a bullet proof glass up there or armed\n                 security.\n       Q.        What was corporate’s response to your request as the manner of\n                 InTown Suites?\n       A.        We don’t have the money for that.\n       ...\n       Q.        All right. Is there any doubt in your mind that the information you’re\n                 sending to corporate, that it’s getting there?\n       A.        Oh, yes, it was getting there.\n\n       4\n           Appellants’ motion for directed verdict was based on causation, see supra ¶ 22.\n\n                                                15\n\f       Q.     How do you know it’s getting there?\n       A.     Because of discussions with my boss at the time.\n       Q.     What discussions were you having?\n       A.     I mean I would ask – if he’d come by, I’d ask, you know, what are we\n              going to do about security. And his answer was always we don’t have\n              the money, you know. And I finally asked do we have the money for\n              my life, you know, and didn’t get an answer.\n\nInTown failed to interpose a contemporaneous objection to that line of questioning. Because\n\nof its failure to make a contemporaneous objection to the opening statement or the questions\n\non cross-examination, InTown waives the issue on appeal; InTown is procedurally barred\n\nfrom raising this issue. Hyundai, 53 So. 3d at 755.\n\nIV.    Whether the trial court erred by refusing InTown’s comparative negligence\n       instructions.\n\n¶32.   InTown argues that it was entitled to a comparative fault instruction because the jury\n\ncould have apportioned the Plaintiffs “some fault for their personal injuries.” InTown argues\n\nthat Howard and Poole should have immediately given their money and possessions to the\n\nthree assailants who had broken into their room, rather than insisting that they did not have\n\nmoney. InTown argues that the plaintiffs’ injuries would have been less severe if they had\n\ndone as the robbers had insisted.\n\n¶33.   “It is well settled that jury instructions generally are within the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt, so the standard of review for the denial of jury instructions is abuse of discretion.”\n\nNewell v. State, 49 So. 3d 66, 73 (Miss. 2010). “Jury instructions must fairly announce the\n\nlaw of the case and not create an injustice against the defendant. This rule is summed up as\n\nfollows: ‘In other words, if all instructions taken as a whole fairly, but not necessarily\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fperfectly, announce the applicable rules of law, no error results.’” Davis v. State, 18 So. 3d\n\n842, 847 (Miss. 2009) (quoting Milano v. State, 790 So. 2d 179, 184 (Miss. 2001)).\n\n¶34.   Mississippi Code Section 11-7-15 provides that:\n\n       In all actions hereafter brought for personal injuries, or where such injuries\n       have resulted in death, or for injury to property, the fact that the person\n       injured, or the owner of the property, or person having control over the\n       property may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a\n       recovery, but damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the\n       amount of negligence attributable to the person injured, or the owner of the\n       property, or the person having control over the property.\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 11-7-15 (Rev. 2004). Moreover, our case law provides that “[e]vidence\n\nof the plaintiff’s own negligence may operate to reduce the plaintiff’s damages. Indeed, we\n\nhave a number of cases where we have sensitively assessed a plaintiff’s own negligence\n\nwhen he makes the charge that the jury’s damage award is grossly insufficient.” Flight Line,\n\nInc. v. Tanksley, 608 So. 2d 1149, 1162 (Miss. 1992). However, we have no case law that\n\nsupports InTown’s argument that the victims of this armed robbery had a duty to mitigate\n\ntheir damages by abiding by the robber’s demands. The cases from other states cited by\n\nInTown in support of their argument are clearly distinguishable. To penalize a crime victim\n\nfor his failure to cooperate with his assailant would constitute a bizarre and perverse\n\nmisapplication of the doctrine of comparative fault. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying InTown’s request for a comparative negligence instruction.\n\nV.     Whether the trial court failed to comply with the statutory cap on noneconomic\n       damages; alternatively, whether the trial court erred in denying InTown’s request for\n       remittitur.\n\n¶35.   In its post-trial “Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, or in the\n\nalternative, Motion for a New Trial, or, in the alternative, Motion for a Remittitur and/or\n\n                                             17\n\fMotion to Amend the Verdict,” InTown attacked the expert testimony used to calculate the\n\nplaintiffs’ economic damages, although it had not objected to that testimony at trial. It\n\nfurther argued that “[t]he fact that these two [p]laintiffs were awarded the exact same amount\n\n[of damages] after presenting such differing testimony as to how they were affected by this\n\nincident, and that their alleged economic losses were significantly different should be\n\noverwhelming evidence of bias, passion or prejudice. As a result, the judgment should be\n\nreduced.” InTown then argued that “Plaintiffs are capped in their recovery for non-economic\n\ndamages, the judgment is excessive in light of the relevant testimony and Defendants\n\nrespectfully move [the trial court] for a remittitur or a new trial on the issue of damages.”\n\nFinally, InTown moved the trial court “for a remittitur or, in the alternative, to amend the\n\njudgment to properly reflect an amount in damages which is substantiated by the evidence\n\nin law, and to amend the judgment to comply with Mississippi statutory and case law.” The\n\ntrial court denied InTown’s post-trial motion.\n\n¶36.   On appeal, InTown argues that the trial court should have given the jury “a verdict\n\nform that would require the jury to segregate economic damages from non-economic\n\ndamages[,] enabling the trial judge to perform her statutory duty to apply the $1,000,000 cap\n\non non-economic damages.” InTown also argues that “the failure of the trial judge to either\n\nsubmit to the jury a verdict form that would require the jury to segregate economic damages\n\nfrom non-economic damages, or to inquire of the jury post-verdict how it arrived at its\n\ndamage calculation requires a new trial.” InTown did not object to the jury instruction on\n\nthe form of the verdict, and InTown did not request a jury instruction that the form of the\n\nverdict should segregate economic damages from noneconomic damages.\n\n\n                                             18\n\f¶37.    Finally, on appeal, InTown attacks the plaintiffs’ experts’ testimony and argues that\n\n“[g]iving [the plaintiffs] the benefit of the full $1,000,000 cap on noneconomic damages, the\n\nmaximum amount of damages, based on the trial testimony, that could have been awarded\n\nto Howard is $1,692,400,” and the maximum amount of damages “that could have been\n\nawarded to Poole is $1,853,800.” InTown argues that the trial court erred in denying its\n\nremittitur, and that this Court should “order the trial court [to] reduce [the plaintiffs’] damage\n\naward . . . .”\n\n        A.       Whether the trial court failed to comply with the statutory cap on noneconomic\n                 damages.\n\n¶38.    Mississippi Code Section 11-1-60 provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\n        (2)(b) In any civil action filed on or after September 1, 2004, other than those\n        actions described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, in the event the trier of\n        fact finds the defendant liable, they shall not award the plaintiff more than One\n        Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for noneconomic damages.\n\n        (c) The trier of fact shall not be advised of the limitations imposed by this\n        subsection (2) and the judge shall appropriately reduce any award of\n        noneconomic damages that exceeds the applicable limitation.\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 11-1-60(2)(b), (c) (Supp. 2010).\n\n¶39.    InTown argues that the jury returned a verdict in which it is unable to determine what\n\namount was awarded for economic damages and what amount was awarded for noneconomic\n\ndamages, and because the two types of damages were indistinguishable, the trial court “erred\n\nby failing to take sufficient steps to enable her to discharge her statutory duty to apply the\n\ncap on noneconomic damages and reduce the jury verdict in accordance with Miss. Code §\n\n11-1-60(2)(b).” InTown further argues that “[w]hile in some cases it may be possible for the\n\nappellate court to review the trial testimony and make a determination regarding the amount\n\n\n                                               19\n\fof economic and non-economic damages awarded by the jury, in this case, the jury awarded\n\neach Plaintiff exactly $2,000,000 in damages based on testimony that provided a range of\n\npossible amounts for each element of damages calculation, as opposed to exact amounts for\n\neach element of the damage calculation.” InTown alleges that “it is not possible for this\n\nCourt to determine with any degree of accuracy how much the jury awarded each Plaintiff\n\nfor economic damages and non-economic damages thus enabling this Court to apply the\n\nstatutory cap on non-economic damages,” and asserts that “it should not be deprived of its\n\nright to have the statutory cap on non-economic damages applied to Plaintiff[s]’ damage\n\nawards due to the error of the trial judge.”\n\n¶40.   Jury Instruction Number 12 provided that:\n\n              You are instructed that “damages” is the word which expresses in\n       dollars and cents the injury sustained by Michael Keith Howard and Shannon\n       Poole, if any, that you find by a preponderance of the evidence.\n              In order to recover damages, they must be shown with reasonable\n       probability both as to their nature and as to their cause. However, a plaintiff\n       does not lose his/her right to recover damages because he/she is unable to\n       prove with absolute certainty the mathematical value of his/her injury. If the\n       cause of the injury is reasonably probable, you may reasonably estimate the\n       damages, and the assessment thereof is with[in] the sole discretion of the jury.\n\n¶41.   Jury Instruction Number 13 provided that:\n\n               The Court instructs the jury that if your verdict be for the Plaintiffs\n       Michael Keith Howard and Shannon Poole of (sic) in this cause, in arriving at\n       the amount of your verdict, you may take into consideration any or all of the\n       following elements of damages, if any, which you find from a preponderance\n       of the evidence in this case to have resulted from the negligence, if any, of the\n       Defendants.\n               (a) All past present and future pain, suffering and mental anguish, if\n       any, sustained by the Plaintiffs.\n               (b) All past and future lost earnings, if any, proximately resulting from\n       Plaintiff Shannon Poole’s injuries.\n               (c) Any past and future medical costs and surgeries if any.\n\n\n                                               20\n\f               In arriving at the amount of your verdict, you may award the plaintiffs\n       Michael Keith Howard and Shannon Poole such an amount of money which\n       you feel will adequately and reasonably compensate the Plaintiffs for any and\n       all of the above listed elements of damage, if any, which you find from a\n       preponderance of the evidence in this case to have resulted from the\n       negligence, if any, of the Defendants.\n\n¶42.   Jury Instruction Number 14 provided that:\n\n       You are instructed that if you find for Plaintiffs, Michael Howard and Shannon\n       Poole, in this case, you are not authorized to find for any amount beyond\n       reasonable compensation for the injuries sustained, if any. You are not\n       authorized to award any damages in the nature of a penalty or attorney’s fees,\n       nor are you bound by any estimates of damages made by the attorneys\n       representing the parties in this suit. If you find for the Plaintiffs, you must\n       therefore confine your verdict to a reasonable compensation for the injuries\n       actually sustained, if any, by the Plaintiffs as a result of the incident in\n       question. You are further instructed that these Defendants are not responsible\n       for any physical or mental problems that the Plaintiffs might have had prior to\n       the incident in question, nor any physical or mental problem that is not related\n       to any injury the Plaintiffs might have suffered as a result of the incident in\n       question.\n\n¶43.   Jury Instruction Number 18 provided that:\n\n             The Court instructs you that if you find for the Plaintiffs and against the\n       Defendants your verdict should be in the following form:\n             “We the jury, find for the Plaintiffs and against Defendants Intown\n       Lessee Associates, LLS; Intown Lessee Services, LLS; IT Tenant RBS, LLC\n       and Timothy Tucker compensatory damages in the amount of\n       $____________________ to Michael Keith Howard and compensatory\n       damages in the amount of $ ____________________ to Shannon Poole.”\n       And you will write your verdict upon a separate piece of paper.\n             If you find against the Plaintiffs and in favor of the Defendants, then the\n       form of your verdict shall be as follows:\n       “We the jury find in favor of the Defendants.”\n\n¶44.   InTown did not object to these jury instructions. Because it did not object to the form\n\nof the verdict jury instruction at trial, InTown is procedurally barred from doing so on appeal.\n\nSee Hyundai, 53 So. 3d at 755. Additionally, because InTown did not ask the trial court to\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fgive a jury instruction that separated economic and noneconomic damages, it cannot\n\ncomplain on appeal that such an instruction was not given. See King v. State, 857 So. 2d\n\n702, 720 (Miss. 2003) (Defendant is “procedurally barred from asserting the absence of an\n\nindividualized instruction,” and “a trial judge will not be put in error on a matter which was\n\nnot presented to him for his decision.”).     This Court does not engage in speculation or\n\nconjecture, and it would be nothing more than supposition for us to try to guess what amount\n\nthe jury awarded in economic damages and what amount it awarded in noneconomic\n\ndamages.\n\n       B.     Whether the trial court erred in denying InTown’s request for a remittitur.\n\n¶45.   Alternatively, InTown argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for a\n\nremittitur. InTown argues that Howard’s damages should be remitted from $2,000,000 to\n\n$1,692,400, and Poole’s damages should be remitted from $2,000,000 to $1,853,800.\n\nInTown argues that Howard’s economic damages ranged from $651,800 to $692,400, which\n\nwould make his damages, at most, $1,692,400, including noneconomic damages, and that\n\nPoole’s economic damages ranged from $813,400 to $853,800, which would make her\n\ndamages, at most, $1,853,800.\n\n¶46.   “The standard of review for trial court decisions regarding a remittitur is the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard.” U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co. of Miss., 998 So. 2d at 969. “However, this\n\nCourt has held that it ‘has the responsibility to see that such judicial discretion is exercised\n\nsoundly and, if not, to reverse.” Id. (quoting Holmes County Bank & Trust Co. v. Staple\n\nCotton Coop. Assoc., 495 So. 2d 447, 451 (Miss. 1986)). The standard for granting an\n\nadditur or remittitur is whether or not “the court finds that the jury was influenced by bias,\n\n                                              22\n\fprejudice, or passion or . . . if the damages were contrary to the overwhelming weight of\n\ncredible evidence.” Rodgers v. Pascagoula Pub. Sch. Dist., 611 So. 2d 942, 944 (Miss.\n\n1992).\n\n¶47.     InTown does not cite any law supporting its contention that it is entitled to a\n\nremittitur. See Bowen v. State, 607 So. 2d 1159, 1161 (Miss. 1992) (“An argument\n\nunsupported by competent authority will not be considered on appeal); M.R.A.P. 28(a)(6)\n\n(“The argument shall contain the contentions of appellant with respect to the issues\n\npresented, and the reasons for those contentions, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and\n\nparts of the record relied on.”). Moreover, in light of the general verdict and InTown’s\n\nfailure to request a special verdict or special interrogatories, we cannot conclude that the trial\n\njudge abused her discretion in denying the remittitur.\n\n¶48.     Accordingly, the judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds\n\nCounty is affirmed.\n\n¶49.     AFFIRMED.\n\n     CARLSON AND DICKINSON, P.JJ., RANDOLPH, LAMAR, CHANDLER,\nPIERCE AND KING, JJ., CONCUR.

Michael Howard and Shannon Poole were awarded a four-million-dollar jury verdict\n\nagainst InTown,1 an extended-stay motel, for injuries each sustained as victims of an armed\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      InTown Lessee Associates, LLC, InTown Lessee Services, LLC, IT Tenants RBS,\nLLC, and Timothy Tucker will collectively be referred to as “InTown.”\n\frobbery in the motel. Aggrieved, InTown appealed. Finding no error, this Court affirms the\n\ntrial court’s judgment.\n\n                                           Facts\n\n¶2.    Michael Keith Howard and Shannon Poole had rented a room at InTown in June 2008,\n\nwhere the couple temporarily resided while waiting for a home to become available in\n\nBelhaven, a residential area in Jackson, Mississippi. On June 27, 2008, at approximately\n\n9:30 p.m., Howard left the motel room to take his dog for a walk. As he was returning to the\n\nroom, three men burst through the door, demanded money from the couple, and ransacked\n\nthe room. One of the assailants hit Howard in the face with a hand gun, then pointed the gun\n\nat Poole’s head and demanded money. Howard and Poole denied having money in the room.\n\nUndeterred, one of the assailants flipped the mattress off the bed, while Poole was on top of\n\nthe mattress, causing her to be pushed against a wall. The men found between $700 and\n\n$900 under the mattress. The assailants took the money, Howard’s and Poole’s drivers’\n\nlicenses, and Poole’s cell phone. Following the altercation, Howard and Poole were treated\n\nfor various injuries that each had sustained during the attack. Initially, Howard was treated\n\nfor broken bones in his face and numerous contusions and lacerations to his body. Prior to\n\ntrial, Howard had to undergo facial reconstructive surgery. Poole sustained contusions and\n\nbruises in the attack, followed by soreness and severe psychological damage. Howard and\n\nPoole were under the continuing care of physicians and psychiatrists. No arrests were made\n\nin connection with the armed robbery and physical assaults.\n\n¶3.    Howard and Poole filed their joint complaint against the defendants on July 18, 2008,\n\nalleging: (1) that they were invitees of InTown; (2) that they were seriously injured because\n\n\n                                             2\n\fthe defendants had failed to fulfill their joint, several, and collective duties to use reasonable\n\ncare and to take adequate and reasonable security precautions or measures to protect invitees\n\nof InTown, including the plaintiffs, from foreseeable harm and danger, including the harm\n\nsuffered by Plaintiffs; (3) that, before June 27, 2008, InTown knew or should have known\n\nthat it had inadequate security, that strangers, trespassers and loiterers frequently came onto\n\nits property, that the wooden fence surrounding part of its property was in disrepair, that the\n\nlocks on the guest room doors were not working properly, and that the property was not\n\nreasonably safe; (4) that InTown had failed to remedy or repair the unsafe conditions and\n\ninadequacies of the property; (5) that InTown had a duty to the plaintiffs to make sure that\n\nthe facilities, including all common areas, as well as guest rooms, were secure, safe, and fit\n\nfor their particular purposes, that reasonable security measures were provided and\n\nmaintained, that the property, including the fences surrounding part of the property and the\n\nlocks on all guest room doors, were properly maintained, and that general upkeep of the\n\nproperty was performed; (6) that InTown had specific control and authority to make\n\nmanagement decisions material to the personal safety and security of the plaintiffs; (7) that\n\nInTown had specific control and authority to make management decisions pertaining to the\n\nhiring, firing, and suspension of employees or security at the motel; (8) that InTown’s agents\n\nand/or employees had warranted and/or covenanted that the property where Howard and\n\nPoole were staying as invitees was secure, safe, fit for its particular purpose, properly\n\nmaintained, under proper upkeep, and reasonable security measures were provided and\n\nmaintained for the plaintiffs, that security would be adequate to both protect the room where\n\nthe plaintiffs were staying, as well as control and maintain the property and enforce security\n\n                                                3\n\fprocedures, including but not limited to stopping loiterers and trespassers from entering the\n\nproperty and/or removing trespassers and loiterers from the property; (9) that InTown had\n\nfailed to provide adequate first aid to the plaintiffs and had failed to instruct its employees\n\non providing first aid to the plaintiffs; and (10) that InTown had failed to warn Howard and\n\nPoole of the atmosphere of violence that existed on and around the property, had failed to\n\nprovide notice of the prior crimes occurring on and around the property, and had failed to\n\nwarn the plaintiffs of the previous assaults and robberies occurring on and around the\n\nproperty.\n\n¶4.    Trial commenced on September 21, 2009, and the jury returned a general verdict in\n\nfavor of Howard and Poole on September 23, 2009.\n\n¶5.    Numerous Jackson police officers testified at trial regarding calls for service at\n\nInTown. One officer had been called to InTown Suites as many as thirty times to respond\n\nto “armed robberies, auto burglaries, car jackings, just auto thefts; different things of that\n\nnature . . . primarily major crimes.” The officer had advised the manager of InTown that the\n\ncrime problem on the property could be eliminated by hiring professional security.\n\n¶6.    A lieutenant with the Jackson Police Department testified that “InTown Suites . . . had\n\na number of problems on their property. Specifically they’ve had robberies. They’ve had\n\nburglaries. Cars have been stolen. There’s prostitution, drugs on the property; just anything\n\nyou can think of.” The lieutenant testified that he was “advised that [InTown] had a courtesy\n\nofficer. He was not a security officer, nor a security guard . . . . [T]he difference is a\n\ncourtesy officer, he was not armed and was not properly trained to handle any type situations\n\nthat would come up. He was only to call the police . . . if he saw something there on the\n\n\n                                              4\n\fproperty criminal in nature.” The lieutenant also testified that he had told the manager of\n\nInTown that off-duty officers “would be more than willing to come out there and work off\n\nduty after we got off work to patrol the property . . . .” The lieutenant further testified that\n\nhe had instructed the manager that InTown should be informing its customers of the problems\n\nthat had been occurring on the property, and that the manager had indicated that InTown\n\nwould have no customers if such a warning were given.\n\n¶7.    Another officer testified that he was a part of the “delta strike force,” which the\n\nJackson Police Department had formed in an effort to deter crimes along the Interstate 55\n\ncorridor. He testified that InTown Suites was a target area that the delta strike force was to\n\npatrol. He explained that the delta strike force’s duty was to “go through [InTown’s] parking\n\nlot, make sure there was no cars broke into, no illegal happenings on the streets or on the\n\nproperty itself. Mostly we were there to try to answer calls and be quick as possible in\n\nresponding to calls that may happen at InTown Suites or other locations.” He also testified\n\nthat, when the task force was on InTown property, no criminal activity transpired. He further\n\ntestified that he had informed the manager of InTown that there was a crime problem on its\n\nproperty and that “they should try to go ahead and get a professionally trained security\n\nservice” to solve the crime problem on the property.\n\n¶8.    Charles Campbell, the property manager of InTown Suites in Jackson on the date that\n\nHoward and Poole were attacked in their room, testified that one of InTown’s duties was “to\n\nensure that customers were provided adequate protection from crime that would occur on the\n\nproperty.” He also testified that he was in contact with his regional manager on a daily basis\n\nand that he often informed regional and corporate officials that there was a crime problem\n\n\n                                               5\n\fat the Jackson property. Campbell testified that he had asked his regional manager to provide\n\nsecurity at the Jackson location of InTown Suites on more than one occasion, and that the\n\nregional manager always had told him that InTown had insufficient funds to hire armed\n\nsecurity.\n\n¶9.    Several expert witnesses also were called to testify. Kenneth Goodrum, a commander\n\nwith the Jackson Police Department, was accepted without objection as a plaintiffs’ expert\n\n“in the area of security with emphasis in the area of premises.” Commander Goodrum\n\ntestified that he had reviewed “all the documentation and the evidence that was given to\n\n[him,] as well as the depositions and offense reports” in this case. Commander Goodrum had\n\ncompleted a crime history report of the Jackson location of InTown, and was able to\n\ndetermine that, in the two-and-a-half-year period prior to Howard and Poole’s injuries, “eight\n\narmed robberies, 32 auto thefts, 55 auto burglaries, six hold-up alarms, 15 simple assaults .\n\n. . three armed robberies of businesses, four men with a gun, two vandalisms, 48 disturbances\n\nand 12 threats” had occurred on the property of InTown. Without objection, Commander\n\nGoodrum testified that the assault of Michael Howard and Shannon Poole “was preventable.\n\nAnd my opinion is that if they would have hired off-duty police officers or armed security\n\nguards to patrol that parking lot and patrol their property, it would have been able to be\n\nprevented.”\n\n¶10.   Plaintiffs deposed David Groves, a regional director of operations for InTown.\n\nGroves testified that approximately twelve InTown properties have armed security on the\n\nproperty, and that the decision to provide armed security guards at a particular property is\n\ndecided on a case-by-case basis. Groves said that the general manager would have to request\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthat armed security be provided, and then the decision to provide security personnel would\n\nbe up to InTown’s corporate officials. Part of Groves’s deposition was read into the record\n\nat trial. InTown objected, but the trial court reasoned that “it still is a part of that testimony\n\nwhich shows notice with reference – and it goes to the issue of foreseeability, which is an\n\nissue in this case. And I think it probably deals with the issue of security in its entirety. As\n\nsuch, I’m going to allow the testimony with reference to . . . Groves.”\n\n¶11.   The plaintiffs offered an economist, who testified regarding Poole’s claim for future\n\nloss of wages. The economist opined that Poole’s future loss of income ranged from\n\n$574,209 to $1,922,589. InTown did not object at trial to the testimony or methodology of\n\nthe economist. Dinesh Goel, M.D., a board-certified general surgeon and accepted expert\n\nin the fields of general surgery and family medicine, testified at trial. Dr. Goel had treated\n\nboth Howard and Poole for their injuries sustained after being attacked at InTown. Dr. Goel\n\ntestified that Howard was treated for a fractured cheek bone and orbit bone of his left eye,\n\nwhich required multiple surgeries. Dr. Goel did not perform Howard’s surgeries; however,\n\nhe had reviewed the surgical records. Dr. Goel further testified that Howard would need\n\nadditional surgeries to correct those injuries completely. Dr. Goel said that the estimated cost\n\nof Howard’s future surgery would be between $5,000 and $8,000.\n\n¶12.   Dr. Goel testified that, in addition to Howard’s badly broken cheek bone and orbit\n\nbone, he had suffered a broken jaw, a head injury, and a bulging disk. Additionally, Howard\n\nhad suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the attack at InTown. As a result of\n\nhis injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, Howard had headaches, nightmares, sleep loss,\n\nand exhibited symptoms of depression, for which Dr. Goel had referred Howard to a\n\n\n                                                7\n\fpsychiatrist for treatment. Dr. Goel further testified that he did not “expect [Howard’s\n\nsymptoms] to get cured, but they’re going to wax and [wane]. They’re going to get better\n\nat times, they’re going to get worse at times, but he’s going to live with it.”\n\n¶13.   Regarding Dr. Goel’s future treatment of Howard, he testified that Howard would\n\n“need a follow-up on a monthly basis and even quarterly later on,” and that the cost of that\n\ntreatment would be approximately $3,000 to $4,000 per year, plus the cost of medications.\n\n¶14.   Dr. Goel testified that Poole had suffered head, back, and neck injuries as a result of\n\nbeing attacked at InTown on June 27, 2008. He said that he initially had treated her with\n\npain medications, and later referred her to a psychiatrist for treatment of her post-traumatic\n\nstress disorder, headaches, nightmares, and sleep loss. Dr. Goel said that Poole would need\n\nto have medical follow-ups on a regular basis, and that the future cost of her medical care\n\nwould be approximately $1,000 to $2,000 per year. Further, Dr. Goel said that her condition\n\nis “going to wax and [wane], but it’s not going to go away. It’s been more than a year she’s\n\nbeen hurting and suffering with it. I think she’s going to stay with it.”\n\n¶15.   Krishan Gupta, M.D., a psychiatrist, treated Howard and Poole for post-traumatic\n\nstress disorder. Dr. Gupta testified that his initial diagnosis of Howard was “adjustment\n\ndisorder and acute stress disorder. As time progresses, we can find the signs and symptoms\n\nof post traumatic stress disorder. And we gave a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder.”\n\nDr. Gupta also testified that Howard was “doing a little better, but still needs continuous\n\npsychotherapy and medication management.” Dr. Gupta further testified that post-traumatic\n\nstress disorder “is a psychological scar in the brain. This will not go away. It’s not a\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fphysical injury you can see like [Howard’s] face was reconstructed, but psychological cannot\n\nbe. So they’re going to be there as long as [Howard] is living on this earth.”\n\n¶16.   Dr. Gupta said that “in the initial evaluation [Poole] was very anxious, so I gave her\n\na diagnosis of acute stress disorder. As the time progressed as we understand more about\n\n[Poole], we gave a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder later on.” Dr. Gupta said that\n\nPoole had suffered from panic attacks, but that most of the panic attacks were from her post-\n\ntraumatic stress disorder. Further, Dr. Gupta testified that Poole was “not making much\n\nprogress. She needs more counseling, and she needs more intensive therapies which will\n\nhelp her to come out and function like [Howard] is doing right now. [Howard] is holding a\n\njob at this time. [Poole] is not able to do that at this time at all.” He also said that Poole\n\nwould need continued treatment with medication.\n\n¶17.   Dr. Gupta testified that, over the lifetime of both Howard and Poole, the cost of each\n\nindividual’s psychiatric treatment would be, at a minimum, $500,000.\n\n¶18.   At the close of the plaintiffs’ case-in-chief, InTown rested without presenting\n\nevidence. The jury returned a general verdict in the amount of $2,000,000 for Howard and\n\n$2,000,000 for Poole.\n\n                                           Issues\n\n¶19.   On appeal, InTown raises the following issues:\n\n       I.     Whether the trial court erred in denying InTown’s motion for directed\n              verdict and motion for JNOV.\n       II.    Whether InTown owed a duty to Plaintiffs to warn them of the alleged\n              generalized “atmosphere of violence” on and around the Jackson\n              property.\n       III.   Whether the cumulative effect of the admission of irrelevant and\n              inadmissible evidence was highly prejudicial to InTown.\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       IV.    Whether the trial court erred by refusing InTown’s comparative\n              negligence instructions.\n       V.     Whether the trial court failed to comply with the statutory cap on\n              noneconomic damages; alternatively, whether the trial court erred in\n              denying InTown’s request for remittitur.\n\n                                          Discussion\n\nI.     Whether the trial court erred in denying InTown’s motion for directed verdict and\n       motion for JNOV.\n\n¶20.   At the close of all of the evidence, InTown moved for a directed verdict on the issue\n\nof causation. InTown began its argument with the following statement: “I realize the\n\nplaintiffs have established a duty was owed, and that’s admitted. But I believe the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to establish . . . that regardless of security that was present or regardless of any\n\nactions that were taken, the plaintiff failed to show that any additional security or any\n\nadditional acts could have prevented the event from happening.” The trial court denied\n\nInTown’s motion for directed verdict. InTown filed a post-trial “Motion for Judgment\n\nNotwithstanding the Verdict, or in the alternative, Motion for a New Trial, or, in the\n\nalternative, Motion for a Remittitur and/or Motion to Amend the Verdict,” arguing that “[t]he\n\njury’s verdict reflected a finding that the alleged inadequacy of security was the proximate\n\ncause of the Plaintiffs’ [injuries]” because “the evidence presented at trial failed to establish\n\nthat this alleged inadequate security was the sole cause of the subject incident.” The trial\n\ncourt denied InTown’s post-trial motion.\n\n¶21.   On appeal, InTown argues that Howard and Poole “failed to meet their burden to\n\nestablish that the proximate cause of their assault was the failure of InTown to employ an\n\narmed, off-duty JPD officer to provide security at the Jackson property.” InTown argues that\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fthe plaintiffs “were required to proffer sufficient evidence to establish that the failure of\n\nInTown to employ an armed, off-duty JPD officer was a substantial factor in bringing about\n\ntheir injuries, and had InTown employed an armed, off-duty JPD officer the harm would not\n\nhave occurred.” Further, InTown alleges that “[t]he only record evidence on the issue of\n\nwhether InTown’s failure to employ an armed, off-duty officer was the proximate cause of\n\nPlaintiffs’ assault is the conclusory statement of Plaintiffs’ proffered ‘expert’ JPD Officer\n\nKenneth Goodrum.” InTown argues that the plaintiffs failed to meet that burden; therefore,\n\nit was entitled to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We disagree and affirm the trial\n\ncourt on this issue.\n\n¶22.   “The standard of review for the denial of a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict (JNOV) is de novo.” U.S. Auto.

The substantial evidence submitted by the plaintiffs was more than legally sufficient,\n\nand included a stipulation that InTown’s management and employees had been the victims\n\nof three armed robberies that had closely preceded these attacks.2 InTown rested without\n\ncalling a single witness to rebut the plaintiffs’ substantial lay and expert witness testimony.\n\nBy the presentation of their lay and expert witnesses, the plaintiffs had created a question\n\nsufficient for the jury’s determination. The evidence, as applied to the plaintiffs’ case, is not\n\n“so indisputable, or so deficient, that the necessity of a trier of fact has been obviated.”\n\nUSAA, 47 So. 3d at 1176.\n\nII.    Whether InTown owed a duty to the plaintiffs to warn them of the alleged generalized\n       “atmosphere of violence” on and around the Jackson property.\n\n¶24.   InTown argues for the first time on appeal that the trial court erred in giving a jury\n\ninstruction that provided that the jury could find against InTown if it found that InTown had\n\nfailed “to warn Michael Keith Howard and Shannon Poole of the existence of a known\n\ndangerous condition.”      InTown argues that Jury Instruction Number 11 “improperly\n\npermitted the jury to find InTown liable if the jury agreed with Plaintiffs’ novel theory and\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       These armed robberies occurred on November 6, 2007, January 3, 2008, and May\n23, 2008.\n\n                                               12\n\fbelieved that InTown breached a duty to warn Plaintiffs of the generalized ‘atmosphere of\n\nviolence’ on and around the Jackson property.”\n\n¶25.

Id.\n\nIII.   Whether the cumulative effect of the admission of irrelevant and inadmissible\n       evidence was highly prejudicial to InTown.\n\n¶26.   InTown argues that the “trial court erred in admitting testimony regarding (a) the\n\nprofitability of the Jackson property; (b) armed security provided by InTown at other\n\nlocations across the South without requiring Plaintiffs to lay a proper foundation that the\n\ncircumstances surrounding those other properties were similar to the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the Jackson property; and (c) the alleged motive/reason why InTown did not\n\nemploy an armed, off-duty JPD officer at the Jackson property.”\n\n¶27.   “The standard of review regarding admission or exclusion of evidence is abuse of\n\ndiscretion.

Whether the trial court erred in allowing Howard and Poole to offer evidence\n              regarding the financial condition/profitability of the Jackson property.\n\n¶28.   InTown argues that it was highly prejudicial for the trial court to allow the plaintiffs\n\nto adduce testimony regarding the profitability of InTown for the year preceding the armed\n\nrobbery of Howard and Poole. However, InTown failed to make a contemporaneous\n\nobjection to this line of questioning at trial.3 Our longstanding case law is clear “that the\n\nfailure to make a contemporaneous objection to the evidence waives the issue on appeal.”\n\nHyundai Motor America v. Applewhite, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755 (Miss. 2011). Because InTown\n\ndid not make a contemporaneous objection to the plaintiffs’ eliciting InTown’s profitability\n\nfor the year 2007, it is procedurally barred from pursuing the issue for the first time on\n\nappeal.\n\n       B.     Whether the trial court erred in allowing Howard and Poole to offer evidence\n              regarding armed security provided by InTown at other locations across the\n              South without requiring them to lay a proper foundation for such evidence.\n\n¶29.   Portions of the deposition of David Groves were read in the presence of the jury, over\n\nInTown’s objection. The trial court allowed the evidence to be presented to the jury,\n\nreasoning that “it still is a part of that testimony which shows notice with reference – and it\n\ngoes to the issue of foreseeability, which is an issue in this case. And I think it probably\n\ndeals with the issue of security in its entirety. As such, I’m going to allow the testimony with\n\nreference to . . . Groves.” Assuming, arguendo, that the admission of this evidence was in\n\n       3\n       InTown objected to plaintiffs’ counsel leading the witness during that line of\nquestioning, but failed to object to the substance of the questions and answers.\n\n                                              14\n\ferror, the remaining evidence of foreseeability and need for additional security was clearly\n\nestablished, and was not contested by the appellants.4 The admission of that portion of\n\nGroves’s deposition did not affect a substantial right belonging to InTown. See Whitten, 799\n\nSo. 2d at 13.\n\n       C.        Whether the trial court erred in allowing Howard and Poole to offer evidence\n                 regarding the alleged motive/reason why InTown did not employ an armed,\n                 off-duty JPD officer at the Jackson property.\n\n¶30.   InTown argues that plaintiffs’ counsel improperly argued that InTown’s motive for\n\nnot employing an armed security officer was because InTown did not want to provide the\n\nfunding for such an officer. InTown argues for the first time on appeal that plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel made inappropriate comments during opening arguments. InTown did not make a\n\ncontemporaneous objection to plaintiffs’ counsel’s opening argument.\n\n¶31.   InTown also complains of the following questions by plaintiffs’ counsel and Charlie\n\nCampbell’s responses:\n\n       Q.        Did [InTown’s regional manager] ever ask about security at the\n                 property?\n       A.        No. We talked about it, but I mean it really didn’t do any good to talk\n                 about it because the answer was always we don’t have the money.\n                 ...\n       Q.        What, if anything, did you ask from corporate after the second robbery?\n       A.        I asked if they could either get me a bullet proof glass up there or armed\n                 security.\n       Q.        What was corporate’s response to your request as the manner of\n                 InTown Suites?\n       A.        We don’t have the money for that.\n       ...\n       Q.        All right. Is there any doubt in your mind that the information you’re\n                 sending to corporate, that it’s getting there?\n       A.        Oh, yes, it was getting there.\n\n       4\n           Appellants’ motion for directed verdict was based on causation, see supra ¶ 22.\n\n                                                15\n\f       Q.     How do you know it’s getting there?\n       A.     Because of discussions with my boss at the time.\n       Q.     What discussions were you having?\n       A.     I mean I would ask – if he’d come by, I’d ask, you know, what are we\n              going to do about security. And his answer was always we don’t have\n              the money, you know. And I finally asked do we have the money for\n              my life, you know, and didn’t get an answer.\n\nInTown failed to interpose a contemporaneous objection to that line of questioning. Because\n\nof its failure to make a contemporaneous objection to the opening statement or the questions\n\non cross-examination, InTown waives the issue on appeal; InTown is procedurally barred\n\nfrom raising this issue. Hyundai, 53 So. 3d at 755.\n\nIV.    Whether the trial court erred by refusing InTown’s comparative negligence\n       instructions.\n\n¶32.   InTown argues that it was entitled to a comparative fault instruction because the jury\n\ncould have apportioned the Plaintiffs “some fault for their personal injuries.” InTown argues\n\nthat Howard and Poole should have immediately given their money and possessions to the\n\nthree assailants who had broken into their room, rather than insisting that they did not have\n\nmoney. InTown argues that the plaintiffs’ injuries would have been less severe if they had\n\ndone as the robbers had insisted.\n\n¶33.   “It is well settled that jury instructions generally are within the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt, so the standard of review for the denial of jury instructions is abuse of discretion.”\n\nNewell v.

Mississippi Code Section 11-7-15 provides that:\n\n       In all actions hereafter brought for personal injuries, or where such injuries\n       have resulted in death, or for injury to property, the fact that the person\n       injured, or the owner of the property, or person having control over the\n       property may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a\n       recovery, but damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the\n       amount of negligence attributable to the person injured, or the owner of the\n       property, or the person having control over the property.\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 11-7-15 (Rev. 2004). Moreover, our case law provides that “[e]vidence\n\nof the plaintiff’s own negligence may operate to reduce the plaintiff’s damages. Indeed, we\n\nhave a number of cases where we have sensitively assessed a plaintiff’s own negligence\n\nwhen he makes the charge that the jury’s damage award is grossly insufficient.” Flight Line,\n\nInc. v. Tanksley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1842736\"><a href=\"/opinion/1842736/flight-line-inc-v-tanksley/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1162 (Miss. 1992). However, we have no case law that\n\nsupports InTown’s argument that the victims of this armed robbery had a duty to mitigate\n\ntheir damages by abiding by the robber’s demands. The cases from other states cited by\n\nInTown in support of their argument are clearly distinguishable. To penalize a crime victim\n\nfor his failure to cooperate with his assailant would constitute a bizarre and perverse\n\nmisapplication of the doctrine of comparative fault. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying InTown’s request for a comparative negligence instruction.\n\nV.     Whether the trial court failed to comply with the statutory cap on noneconomic\n       damages; alternatively, whether the trial court erred in denying InTown’s request for\n       remittitur.\n\n¶35.   In its post-trial “Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, or in the\n\nalternative, Motion for a New Trial, or, in the alternative, Motion for a Remittitur and/or\n\n                                             17\n\fMotion to Amend the Verdict,” InTown attacked the expert testimony used to calculate the\n\nplaintiffs’ economic damages, although it had not objected to that testimony at trial. It\n\nfurther argued that “[t]he fact that these two [p]laintiffs were awarded the exact same amount\n\n[of damages] after presenting such differing testimony as to how they were affected by this\n\nincident, and that their alleged economic losses were significantly different should be\n\noverwhelming evidence of bias, passion or prejudice. As a result, the judgment should be\n\nreduced.” InTown then argued that “Plaintiffs are capped in their recovery for non-economic\n\ndamages, the judgment is excessive in light of the relevant testimony and Defendants\n\nrespectfully move [the trial court] for a remittitur or a new trial on the issue of damages.”\n\nFinally, InTown moved the trial court “for a remittitur or, in the alternative, to amend the\n\njudgment to properly reflect an amount in damages which is substantiated by the evidence\n\nin law, and to amend the judgment to comply with Mississippi statutory and case law.” The\n\ntrial court denied InTown’s post-trial motion.\n\n¶36.   On appeal, InTown argues that the trial court should have given the jury “a verdict\n\nform that would require the jury to segregate economic damages from non-economic\n\ndamages[,] enabling the trial judge to perform her statutory duty to apply the $1,000,000 cap\n\non non-economic damages.” InTown also argues that “the failure of the trial judge to either\n\nsubmit to the jury a verdict form that would require the jury to segregate economic damages\n\nfrom non-economic damages, or to inquire of the jury post-verdict how it arrived at its\n\ndamage calculation requires a new trial.” InTown did not object to the jury instruction on\n\nthe form of the verdict, and InTown did not request a jury instruction that the form of the\n\nverdict should segregate economic damages from noneconomic damages.\n\n\n                                             18\n\f¶37.    Finally, on appeal, InTown attacks the plaintiffs’ experts’ testimony and argues that\n\n“[g]iving [the plaintiffs] the benefit of the full $1,000,000 cap on noneconomic damages, the\n\nmaximum amount of damages, based on the trial testimony, that could have been awarded\n\nto Howard is $1,692,400,” and the maximum amount of damages “that could have been\n\nawarded to Poole is $1,853,800.” InTown argues that the trial court erred in denying its\n\nremittitur, and that this Court should “order the trial court [to] reduce [the plaintiffs’] damage\n\naward . . . .”\n\n        A.       Whether the trial court failed to comply with the statutory cap on noneconomic\n                 damages.\n\n¶38.    Mississippi Code Section 11-1-60 provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\n        (2)(b) In any civil action filed on or after September 1, 2004, other than those\n        actions described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, in the event the trier of\n        fact finds the defendant liable, they shall not award the plaintiff more than One\n        Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for noneconomic damages.\n\n        (c) The trier of fact shall not be advised of the limitations imposed by this\n        subsection (2) and the judge shall appropriately reduce any award of\n        noneconomic damages that exceeds the applicable limitation.\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 11-1-60(2)(b), (c) (Supp. 2010).\n\n¶39.    InTown argues that the jury returned a verdict in which it is unable to determine what\n\namount was awarded for economic damages and what amount was awarded for noneconomic\n\ndamages, and because the two types of damages were indistinguishable, the trial court “erred\n\nby failing to take sufficient steps to enable her to discharge her statutory duty to apply the\n\ncap on noneconomic damages and reduce the jury verdict in accordance with Miss. Code §\n\n11-1-60(2)(b).” InTown further argues that “[w]hile in some cases it may be possible for the\n\nappellate court to review the trial testimony and make a determination regarding the amount\n\n\n                                               19\n\fof economic and non-economic damages awarded by the jury, in this case, the jury awarded\n\neach Plaintiff exactly $2,000,000 in damages based on testimony that provided a range of\n\npossible amounts for each element of damages calculation, as opposed to exact amounts for\n\neach element of the damage calculation.” InTown alleges that “it is not possible for this\n\nCourt to determine with any degree of accuracy how much the jury awarded each Plaintiff\n\nfor economic damages and non-economic damages thus enabling this Court to apply the\n\nstatutory cap on non-economic damages,” and asserts that “it should not be deprived of its\n\nright to have the statutory cap on non-economic damages applied to Plaintiff[s]’ damage\n\nawards due to the error of the trial judge.”\n\n¶40.   Jury Instruction Number 12 provided that:\n\n              You are instructed that “damages” is the word which expresses in\n       dollars and cents the injury sustained by Michael Keith Howard and Shannon\n       Poole, if any, that you find by a preponderance of the evidence.\n              In order to recover damages, they must be shown with reasonable\n       probability both as to their nature and as to their cause. However, a plaintiff\n       does not lose his/her right to recover damages because he/she is unable to\n       prove with absolute certainty the mathematical value of his/her injury. If the\n       cause of the injury is reasonably probable, you may reasonably estimate the\n       damages, and the assessment thereof is with[in] the sole discretion of the jury.\n\n¶41.   Jury Instruction Number 13 provided that:\n\n               The Court instructs the jury that if your verdict be for the Plaintiffs\n       Michael Keith Howard and Shannon Poole of (sic) in this cause, in arriving at\n       the amount of your verdict, you may take into consideration any or all of the\n       following elements of damages, if any, which you find from a preponderance\n       of the evidence in this case to have resulted from the negligence, if any, of the\n       Defendants.\n               (a) All past present and future pain, suffering and mental anguish, if\n       any, sustained by the Plaintiffs.\n               (b) All past and future lost earnings, if any, proximately resulting from\n       Plaintiff Shannon Poole’s injuries.\n               (c) Any past and future medical costs and surgeries if any.\n\n\n                                               20\n\f               In arriving at the amount of your verdict, you may award the plaintiffs\n       Michael Keith Howard and Shannon Poole such an amount of money which\n       you feel will adequately and reasonably compensate the Plaintiffs for any and\n       all of the above listed elements of damage, if any, which you find from a\n       preponderance of the evidence in this case to have resulted from the\n       negligence, if any, of the Defendants.\n\n¶42.   Jury Instruction Number 14 provided that:\n\n       You are instructed that if you find for Plaintiffs, Michael Howard and Shannon\n       Poole, in this case, you are not authorized to find for any amount beyond\n       reasonable compensation for the injuries sustained, if any. You are not\n       authorized to award any damages in the nature of a penalty or attorney’s fees,\n       nor are you bound by any estimates of damages made by the attorneys\n       representing the parties in this suit. If you find for the Plaintiffs, you must\n       therefore confine your verdict to a reasonable compensation for the injuries\n       actually sustained, if any, by the Plaintiffs as a result of the incident in\n       question. You are further instructed that these Defendants are not responsible\n       for any physical or mental problems that the Plaintiffs might have had prior to\n       the incident in question, nor any physical or mental problem that is not related\n       to any injury the Plaintiffs might have suffered as a result of the incident in\n       question.\n\n¶43.   Jury Instruction Number 18 provided that:\n\n             The Court instructs you that if you find for the Plaintiffs and against the\n       Defendants your verdict should be in the following form:\n             “We the jury, find for the Plaintiffs and against Defendants Intown\n       Lessee Associates, LLS; Intown Lessee Services, LLS; IT Tenant RBS, LLC\n       and Timothy Tucker compensatory damages in the amount of\n       $____________________ to Michael Keith Howard and compensatory\n       damages in the amount of $ ____________________ to Shannon Poole.”\n       And you will write your verdict upon a separate piece of paper.\n             If you find against the Plaintiffs and in favor of the Defendants, then the\n       form of your verdict shall be as follows:\n       “We the jury find in favor of the Defendants.”\n\n¶44.   InTown did not object to these jury instructions. Because it did not object to the form\n\nof the verdict jury instruction at trial, InTown is procedurally barred from doing so on appeal.\n\nSee Hyundai, 53 So. 3d at 755. Additionally, because InTown did not ask the trial court to\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fgive a jury instruction that separated economic and noneconomic damages, it cannot\n\ncomplain on appeal that such an instruction was not given.

This Court does not engage in speculation or\n\nconjecture, and it would be nothing more than supposition for us to try to guess what amount\n\nthe jury awarded in economic damages and what amount it awarded in noneconomic\n\ndamages.\n\n       B.     Whether the trial court erred in denying InTown’s request for a remittitur.\n\n¶45.   Alternatively, InTown argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for a\n\nremittitur. InTown argues that Howard’s damages should be remitted from $2,000,000 to\n\n$1,692,400, and Poole’s damages should be remitted from $2,000,000 to $1,853,800.\n\nInTown argues that Howard’s economic damages ranged from $651,800 to $692,400, which\n\nwould make his damages, at most, $1,692,400, including noneconomic damages, and that\n\nPoole’s economic damages ranged from $813,400 to $853,800, which would make her\n\ndamages, at most, $1,853,800.\n\n¶46.   “The standard of review for trial court decisions regarding a remittitur is the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard.” U.S. Fid. and Guar.

Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1924799\"><a href=\"/opinion/1924799/rodgers-v-pascagoula-public-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944 (Miss.\n\n1992).\n\n¶47.     InTown does not cite any law supporting its contention that it is entitled to a\n\nremittitur. See Bowen v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1142631\"><a href=\"/opinion/1142631/bowen-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1161 (Miss. 1992) (“An argument\n\nunsupported by competent authority will not be considered on appeal); M.R.A.P. 28(a)(6)\n\n(“The argument shall contain the contentions of appellant with respect to the issues\n\npresented, and the reasons for those contentions, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and\n\nparts of the record relied on.”). Moreover, in light of the general verdict and InTown’s\n\nfailure to request a special verdict or special interrogatories, we cannot conclude that the trial\n\njudge abused her discretion in denying the remittitur.\n\n¶48.     Accordingly, the judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds\n\nCounty is affirmed.\n\n¶49.
