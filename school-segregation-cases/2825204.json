FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\nfax, Virginia, for Appellee. ON BRIEF: Jennifer L. Redmond,\nBLANKINGSHIP & KEITH, Fairfax, Virginia; Thomas J. Cawley,\nHUNTON & WILLIAMS, McLean, Virginia, for Appellee.\n\n\n                              OPINION\n\nDUNCAN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   AW, a disabled student in Fairfax County, Virginia, appeals the\ndistrict court’s judgment in favor of the Fairfax County School Board\n(\"FCSB\") in his suit under the Individuals with Disabilities Education\nAct, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487 (West 2000 & Supp. 2003) (\"the\nIDEA\"). In his complaint, AW asserted that the FCSB improperly\nrefused to allow him to enroll at his preferred junior high school after\na pattern of misbehavior in the preceding school year resulted in his\nmid-year transfer to an elementary school that sent its students on to\na different junior high school. Specifically, AW alleged that the\nFCSB’s transfer decision violated the procedural and substantive pro-\ntections afforded him under the IDEA, including its \"stay-put\" provi-\nsion requiring that the student’s \"educational placement\" not change\nwhile disciplinary proceedings are pending. Because we conclude that\nthe term \"educational placement\" as used in the stay-put provision\nrefers to the overall educational environment rather than the precise\nlocation in which the disabled student is educated, we affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   In March 2002, AW was a sixth-grade student assigned to the\n\"gifted and talented\" program (the \"GT program\") at his elementary\nschool. During the prior school year, a committee at AW’s school\nconcluded that AW was eligible to receive special education assis-\ntance under the IDEA as a student with an emotional disability. That\ndetermination resulted in the formulation of an Individualized Educa-\ntional Program (\"IEP\") for AW that devoted one hour of each school\nweek to specialized education intended to alleviate AW’s \"difficulty\nmaintaining focus and completing academic tasks as required\" and\navoidance of \"many tasks, especially when they involve writing.\" J.A.\n135. AW successfully completed the remainder of his fifth-grade\n\f                AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                     3\nyear, and his IEP was revised the following year in accordance with\nIDEA procedure.\n\n   As a sixth-grader, AW began exhibiting behavior problems he had\nnot displayed during the first year of his IDEA program. These disci-\nplinary issues culminated in a March 2002 incident in which AW per-\nsuaded another student to place a threatening note in the computer file\nof a student that AW disliked.2 In the ensuing inquiry, AW admitted\nthat his intent was to scare the targeted student away from school.\nBased on his admission and past behavioral problems, school admin-\nistrators suspended AW from school for two school weeks and initi-\nated proceedings to expel AW.\n\n   As required by the IDEA, school officials convened a Manifesta-\ntion Determination Review (\"MDR\") committee in order to determine\nthe extent to which AW could be disciplined. Under the IDEA, a dis-\nabled student may not be disciplined by his school unless an MDR\ncommittee concludes that the student’s IEP was appropriate relative\nto his qualifying disability and that the student’s disability did not\ninhibit his capacity either to appreciate that his behavior was inappro-\npriate or to conform his behavior to expectations. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(k)(4) (2000). On the ninth day of AW’s suspension, the MDR\ncommittee concluded that AW’s IEP appropriately compensated for\nhis emotional disability and that AW’s disability did not prevent him\nfrom either understanding that his actions violated school rules or\nbehaving appropriately. This finding opened the door for the FCSB\nto discipline AW as it would any other student. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(k)(5) (2000). The following day, however, a FCSB adminis-\ntrator rejected the expulsion recommendation from the administrators\nof AW’s school and directed instead that AW be transferred to the GT\nprogram at another FCSB elementary school for the remainder of the\nschool year. It is undisputed that AW would continue to receive the\none hour per week of special education at this new location.\n\n   Despite the transfer determination, AW returned to his original\nschool at the conclusion of his suspension to complete the final week\nof school before spring break. During this week, AW continued to\n  2\n   That message, which appeared anonymously in the targeted student’s\naccount, read \"DEATH AWAITS YOU.\"\n\f4              AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\nreceive GT program course work but was separated from his class and\nassigned instead to an empty classroom. As the week drew to a close,\nAW’s parents invoked their right under the due process procedures of\nthe IDEA to a review of the MDR determination. The appointed due\nprocess review officer (\"DPR Officer\") issued a pre-hearing decision\nstaying the FCSB administrator’s transfer decision, and AW returned\nto his original school following spring break.\n\n   At the April 17, 2002 hearing regarding the MDR committee’s\nfindings, AW’s psychologist testified that AW had Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\") and Oppositional Defiance Disor-\nder (\"ODD\"). AW’s psychologist opined that AW’s IEP failed to ade-\nquately compensate for ODD and that AW’s combination of\nconditions figured prominently in the behavior for which he was dis-\nciplined. Nevertheless, the DPR Officer concluded that the MDR\ncommittee’s conclusion was sound and that the FCSB could transfer\nAW to a nearby school with a comparable GT program, based in part\non his conclusion that the evidence did not support the findings of\nAW’s psychologist. The DPR Officer’s order released the FCSB to\ntransfer AW to another elementary school located approximately five\nmiles away from AW’s original school, and AW completed his sixth-\ngrade year at that school.\n\n   Following their unsuccessful attempts to enroll AW at the junior\nhigh he would likely have attended but for his transfer, AW’s parents\nfiled the complaint in this case on AW’s behalf on August 16, 2002.\nThe complaint alleged that the FCSB violated the IDEA’s \"stay-put\"\nprovision by transferring AW despite the ongoing challenge to the\nMDR committee’s determination under the IDEA’s review proce-\ndures, and that the MDR committee erred in concluding that AW\ncould be disciplined as any other student. The district court granted\njudgment in favor of the FCSB, and AW timely appealed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n  This Court reviews the district court’s interpretation of the IDEA\nde novo. Wagner v. Bd. of Educ., 335 F.3d 297, 301 (4th Cir. 2003).\nWhen a district court reviews a state administrative decision under the\nIDEA, that court must make an \"independent decision based on a pre-\nponderance of the evidence.\" Doyle v. Arlington County Sch. Bd., 953\n\f                AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                        5\nF.2d 100, 103 (4th Cir. 1991). In doing so, however, the court must\naccord the administrative findings \"due weight,\" as \"the primary\nresponsibility for formulating the education to be accorded a handi-\ncapped child, and for choosing the educational method most suitable\nto the child’s needs, was left by the IDEA to state and local educa-\ntional agencies in cooperation with the parents or guardian of the\nchild.\" Springer v. Fairfax County Sch. Bd., 134 F.3d 659, 663 (4th\nCir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n   The IDEA confers upon disabled students substantive and proce-\ndural rights that ensure the child’s right to \"public education in partic-\nipating States.\" Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 310 (1988).\nSubstantively, the IDEA requires participating states to provide all\ndisabled children with a free appropriate public education (\"FAPE\")\nas a condition to the receipt of federal funds. See 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1400(d)(1)(A), 1412(a)(1) (2000).3 As an adjunct to this require-\nment, school officials must create an IEP for each qualifying child to\nensure that the school district is properly discharging this obligation\nwith respect to each disabled student. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1414(d)(1)(2000). Procedurally, the IDEA \"guarantee[s] parents\nboth an opportunity for meaningful input into all decisions affecting\ntheir child’s education and the right to seek review of any decisions\nthey think inappropriate.\" Honig, 484 U.S. at 311-12. This includes\nthe \"opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter\nrelating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of\nthe child.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6)(2000)(emphasis added).4\n\n   AW presents two issues in this appeal. First, AW asserts that his\nmid-year transfer by the FCSB violates the \"stay-put\" provision of the\nIDEA, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j)(2000), as the due process review guaran-\nteed to AW’s parents under the IDEA was still proceeding. Second,\nAW challenges the substantive determination by the MDR committee\nthat allowed the FCSB to discipline AW in the same manner as any\nnon-disabled student. We consider each issue in turn.\n  3\n     A FAPE constitutes an education that is specifically designed \"to\nmeet the unique needs of the [disabled] child, supported by such services\nas are necessary to permit the child to benefit from the instruction.\" Todd\nv. Duneland Sch. Corp., 299 F.3d 899, 905 (7th Cir. 2002).\n   4\n     See also Honig, 484 U.S. at 312 (discussing prior version of section).\n\f6               AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\n                                  III.\n\n   The first issue raised by AW in this appeal is whether the FCSB’s\ndecision to transfer him mid-year to the GT program at another school\nviolated the \"stay-put\" provision of the IDEA. This provision man-\ndates that \"during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursu-\nant to this section, . . . the child shall remain in the then-current\neducational placement of such child,\" absent the consent of school\nofficials and the parents. Id. (emphasis added). AW argues that the\nterm \"educational placement\" encompasses not simply the particular\nschool to which the student is assigned, but the very classroom in\nwhich he or she receives his or her instruction. According to AW, the\n\"stay-put\" provision thus requires the FCSB to keep him not only in\nthe GT program, but to keep him in the specific GT program class-\nroom to which he was originally assigned. In response, the FCSB\nargues that \"educational placement\" cannot have so specific a defini-\ntion. The FCSB maintains that the \"stay-put\" provision protects\nagainst a change in overall educational environment, rather than phys-\nical location. We must therefore determine what Congress meant by\nthe term \"educational placement\" and whether the FCSB’s transfer of\nAW constituted a change in his then-current educational placement.\n\n                                  A.\n\n   In interpreting a statute, we start with the text of the provision at\nissue, which here states that school officials may not change a stu-\ndent’s \"then-current educational placement\" while disciplinary pro-\nceedings are pending. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j). By mandating that the\nstudent’s \"educational placement\" remain undisturbed for the duration\nof any proceedings related to the disciplinary decision, the \"stay-put\"\nprovision circumscribes school officials’ ability to unilaterally disci-\npline students covered by the IDEA. See Erickson v. Albuquerque\nPublic Schs., 199 F.3d 1116, 1121 (10th Cir. 1999); Susquenita Sch.\nDist. v. Raelee S. ex rel. Heidi S., 96 F.3d 78, 83 (3d Cir. 1996). How-\never, \"[n]either the statute nor the legislative history provides guid-\nance for a reviewing court on how to identify ‘the then current\neducational placement.’\" Ms. S. ex rel. G. v. Vashon Island Sch. Dist.,\n337 F.3d 1115, 1133 n.22 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (quoting Drinker ex rel. Drinker v. Colonial Sch. Dist., 78\nF.3d 859, 865 n.13 (3d Cir. 1996)). Indeed, the IDEA does not define\n\f                  AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                         7\nthe term \"educational placement.\" Erickson, 199 F.3d at 1121. While\nundefined terms in a statute must be given their ordinary meaning,\nAsgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179, 187 (1995), and the\nterms \"educational\" and \"placement\" do have such definitions, it is\nclear that Congress intended these words to be construed together as\na term of art. Hence, a recitation of the ordinary meaning of these\nindependent terms is of little utility. Cf. In re S. Star Foods, Inc., 201\nB.R. 291, 293 (Bankr. E.D. Okla. 1996) (noting that an undefined\nterm of art that may be read narrowly or broadly is ambiguous).\n\n   Judicial construction of the term \"educational placement\" has gen-\nerally failed to provide significant clarification. Rather, courts have\nalternatively defined the term narrowly or broadly depending on the\ncircumstances. Thus, for example, educational placement has been\nfound to refer to anything from \"the physical school attended by a\nchild [to] the abstract goals of a child’s IEP\" in varying contexts. Bd.\nof Educ. v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ., 103 F.3d 545, 548-549 (7th Cir.\n1996) (collecting cases).5 We do not find such an elastic approach to\nprovide guidance here.6\n  5\n    At least one court has attempted to synthesize these definitions by\nstating that\n      [a] transfer to a different school building for . . . reasons unre-\n      lated to the disabled child has generally not been deemed a\n      change in placement, whereas an expulsion from school or some\n      other change in location made on account of the disabled child\n      or his behavior has usually been deemed a change in educational\n      placement that violates the stay-put provision if made unilater-\n      ally.\nHale ex rel. Hale v. Poplar Bluffs R-I Sch. Dist., 280 F.3d 831, 834 (8th\nCir. 2002). However, courts like Hale have reached such conclusions in\nthe context of expulsions and similar changes in location that result in the\ndenial of educational services altogether.\n   6\n     On occasion, of course, the Supreme Court has concluded that it is\nappropriate to allow the definition of a statutory term to be defined by\nthe factual context in which it is to be applied. In Commissioner v.\nGroetzinger, the Court declined to adopt a universal definition of \"trade\nor business\" under the Internal Revenue Code due to \"the Code’s wide\nutilization in various contexts of the term ‘trade or business,’ in the\nabsence of an all-purpose definition\" and the concern that \"an attempt\n\f8               AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\n   The Supreme Court, however, has indirectly provided insight into\nthe definition of \"educational placement\" through its discussions of\nthe proper application of the \"stay-put\" provision. In discussing pre-\ncursors to the current \"stay-put\" provision, the Court has twice indi-\ncated that its purpose was to \"prevent school officials from removing\na child from the regular public school classroom over the parents’\nobjection pending completion of the review proceedings.\" Sch.\nComm. v. Dep’t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 373 (1985); see also Honig,\n484 U.S. at 323 (noting the \"stay-put\" provision was intended \"to strip\nschools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to\nexclude disabled students, particularly emotionally disturbed students,\nfrom school\" (second emphasis added)).\n\n   The Court has also indicated that the IDEA was not intended to\n\"leave educators hamstrung.\" Id. at 325. To that end, the Court has\nheld that the \"stay-put\" provision is not so limiting as to prevent\nschool officials from resorting to temporary changes short of exclu-\nsion, including \"the use of study carrels, timeouts, detention, or the\nrestriction of privileges.\" Id. According to the Court, such options\nconstitute only minor departures from prior assignments and \"do[ ]\nnot carry the potential for total exclusion that Congress found so\nobjectionable.\" Id. at 325-26 & n.8. Thus, any definition of \"educa-\ntional placement\" must reflect the fact that the \"stay-put\" provision is\nnot implicated by temporary changes that track previous assignments\nas closely as possible and do not affect a student’s FAPE.7 See United\n\njudicially to formulate and impose a test for all situations would be coun-\nterproductive, unhelpful, and even somewhat precarious for the overall\nintegrity of the Code.\" 480 U.S. 23, 36 (1987). Nevertheless, we are not\npersuaded that multiple definitions of the same term are necessary in this\ncontext, and the parties have failed to indicate a basis from which to con-\nclude that Congress intended a definition of \"educational placement\" that\nis predicated on the factual context in which its application arises.\nAlthough the terms underlying the IDEA’s statutory scheme \"tend[ ]\ntoward the cryptic rather than the comprehensive, . . . that is scarcely a\nreason for abandoning the quest for legislative intent.\" Bd. of Educ. v.\nRowley, 458 U.S. 176, 188 (1982).\n   7\n     Other provisions in the IDEA beyond the \"stay-put\" provision reflect\nHonig’s influence. In particular, § 1415(k)(1) notes that a school offi-\n\f                AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                        9\nStates v. Langley, 62 F.3d 602, 605 (4th Cir. 1995) (noting that it may\nbe presumed that Congress \"acts with knowledge of existing law, and\nthat absent a clear manifestation of contrary intent, a newly-enacted\nor revised statute is presumed to be harmonious with existing law and\nits judicial construction\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   The foregoing \"stay-put\" jurisprudence indicates that the provision\nis certainly violated by a change in location that leads to an outright\ndenial of educational services. However, the Supreme Court has clari-\nfied that temporary changes in location do not violate the \"stay-put\"\nprovision provided they do not result in a diminution of the educa-\ntional services to which the student is entitled. Since the circum-\nstances of AW’s transfer do not fall into either category, resolution\nof this appeal requires a clearer definition of the term \"educational\nplacement.\"\n\n                                    B.\n\n   Because the IDEA does not define \"educational placement\" and, as\na term of art, the term lacks an ordinary meaning, we must examine\n\ncial’s decision to temporarily assign a student to an \"interim alternative\neducational setting [or] another setting,\" or to suspend the student, con-\nstitutes an explicitly authorized \"change in the placement of a child with\na disability.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1415(k)(1)(A)(i) (2000). This provision tracks\nthe holding in Honig: that school officials may resort to temporary sus-\npensions or lesser disciplinary measures without effecting a change in the\nstudent’s \"educational placement.\" 484 U.S. at 325. Although the IDEA\ndoes not define \"placement\" or \"setting\" either, it uses these terms in the\ncontext of a disciplinary provision which places them in contradistinction\nto a student’s educational environment prior to being disciplined. See\n§ 1415(k)(1)(A)(i). The least dramatic departure from the student’s envi-\nronment authorized by the IDEA is an assignment to an \"interim alterna-\ntive educational setting,\" which the IDEA describes as a setting that\nallows the student to continue his educational program without interrup-\ntion. See §§ 1415(k)(1)(A)(i), (3)(B)(i). At the other end of the spectrum\nis suspension, an option which permits the school to deny the student\naccess to both his or her regular educational program and the school\nitself. Thus, a change in \"placement\" occurs when a school places the\nstudent in a setting that is distinguishable from the educational environ-\nment to which the student was previously assigned.\n\f10              AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\nthe IDEA to distill a definition that \"can most fairly be said to be in\nthe statute, in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and\nwith the general purposes that Congress manifested.\" Comm’r v.\nEngle, 464 U.S. 206, 217 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nToward that end, we note that the IDEA rests on two primary prem-\nises: that all disabled students receive a FAPE and that each disabled\nstudent receive instruction in the \"least restrictive environment\"\n(\"LRE\") possible. See, e.g., Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176,\n180-82 (1982) (discussing precursor to the IDEA); Bd. of Educ. v. Ill.\nState Bd. of Educ., 184 F.3d 912, 915 (7th Cir. 1999) (discussing 34\nC.F.R. § 300.550 (2003)).\n\n   As noted above, the FAPE requirement addresses the substantive\ncontent of the educational services the disabled student is entitled to\nreceive under the IDEA. The LRE requirement reflects the IDEA’s\npreference that \"[t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with\ndisabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other\ncare facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled.\" See\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5) (2000); 34 C.F.R. § 300.550(b)(1). However,\nthis preference for \"mainstreaming\" disabled students is not absolute;\n§ 1412(a)(5) permits the delivery of educational services to disabled\nstudents in less integrated settings as necessitated by the student’s dis-\nability. A.B. ex rel. D.B. v. Lawson, 354 F.3d 315, 330 (4th Cir.\n2004).\n\n   Although the foregoing indicates that the definition of \"educational\nplacement\" should reflect the \"mainstreaming\" ideal of the LRE\nrequirement, it does not appear that the term also includes the precise\nphysical location where a disabled student is educated. The LRE\nrequirement directs that the disabled student be assigned to a setting\nthat resembles as closely as possible the setting to which he would be\nassigned if not disabled. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 202-03 & n.24. The\nIDEA’s concern with location thus focuses on the degree to which\nany particular assignment segregates a disabled student from non-\ndisabled students, rather than on the precise location of the assign-\nment itself. Given the IDEA’s concern with \"mainstreaming\" and\nappropriate educational content, we find little support in the IDEA’s\nunderlying principles for AW’s assertion that \"educational placement\"\nshould be construed to secure his right to attend school in a particular\nclassroom at a particular location.\n\f                AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                      11\n                                   C.\n\n   The IDEA’s emphasis on educational content and instructional\nenvironment are reflected in the regulations promulgated by the\nDepartment of Education. Indeed, in a recent case, the parents of a\ndisabled student challenged the school district’s decision to transfer\ntheir disabled child to another school as violative of the IDEA’s \"stay-\nput\" provision by citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.552 (2003), which provides\ncriteria for determining a disabled student’s \"‘educational place-\nment.’\" White ex rel. White v. Ascension Parish Sch. Bd., 343 F.3d\n373 at 379-80 (5th Cir. 2003). Noting the directive in § 300.552 that\nthe \"placement\" assignment be \"as close as possible to the child’s\nhome\" and that the child be \"educated in the school that he or she\nwould attend if nondisabled,\" the parents argued that \"educational\nplacement\" extends to the particular building to which their child was\nassigned. 343 F.3d at 379-80.\n\n   As noted by the White court, however, another provision in the reg-\nulations undercuts this interpretation and suggests that the regulations\ncontinue the IDEA’s concern with the extent to which any particular\nassignment reflected the \"mainstreaming\" ideal, rather than the pre-\ncise location of that assignment. Section 300.551 describes different\n\"placement\" options that school boards must make available to dis-\nabled students, including \"regular classes, special classes, special\nschools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institu-\ntions.\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.551 (2003). Noting that these options were\ndifferentiated from each other by the extent to which they departed\nfrom a \"mainstream\" assignment, the court concluded that the term\n\"placement\" as used in the regulations refers only to the setting in\nwhich the student is educated, rather than the precise location. See\n343 F.3d at 380. To the extent § 300.552(b) states that school officials\nshall ensure that the placement \"is as close as possible to the child’s\nhome,\" this language does not mandate that the student be assigned\nto the closest school, but simply to one that is as \"close as possible.\"8\n  8\n   At argument, counsel for AW argued that the school officials and\nhearing officer in question lacked the authority to transfer AW during the\nschool year, apparently relying on 8 Va. Admin. Code § 20-80-68(C)\n(2001). While we are aware of cases holding that \"state standards that\n\f12               AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\n   Consideration of the structure and the goals of the IDEA as a\nwhole, in addition to its implementing regulations, reinforces our con-\nclusion that the touchstone of the term \"educational placement\" is not\nthe location to which the student is assigned but rather the environ-\nment in which educational services are provided. To the extent that\na new setting replicates the educational program contemplated by the\nstudent’s original assignment and is consistent with the principles of\n\"mainstreaming\" and affording access to a FAPE, the goal of protect-\ning the student’s \"educational placement\" served by the \"stay-put\"\nprovision appears to be met. Likewise, where a change in location\nresults in a dilution of the quality of a student’s education or a depar-\nture from the student’s LRE-compliant setting, a change in \"educa-\ntional placement\" occurs.9\n\n                                    D.\n\n   In light of our conclusion that \"educational placement\" fixes the\noverall instructional setting in which the student receives his educa-\ntion, rather than the precise location of that setting, we conclude that\nAW’s transfer between such materially identical settings does not\nimplicate the \"stay-put\" provision of § 1415(j). See White, 343 F.3d\nat 380. The parties do not dispute that the GT program at the nearby\nelementary school to which the FCSB transferred AW was materially\nidentical in its educational offerings and that AW would be placed in\nan identical setting (a regular GT program classroom). Moreover,\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that the new location selected\n\nimpose a greater duty to educate disabled children,\" if consistent with\nfederal standards, \"are enforceable in federal court under the IDEA,\"\nErickson, 199 F.3d at 1122 (internal quotations omitted), § 20-80-68(C)\naddresses \"[l]ong-term removals\" and, as noted above, the transfer did\nnot constitute a removal from AW’s setting.\n  9\n    We recognize the possibility that a transfer to a different school might\nentail a commute so long or arduous as to negatively impact the student’s\nability to excel in the otherwise identical setting. However, we are not\nconfronted by this issue in this appeal. The materials provided by the\nparties indicate that the schools at issue are separated by less than five\nmiles; the school to which AW was transferred is less than two miles far-\nther away from his home.\n\f                 AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                       13\nfor AW by the FCSB would work such a change in the student’s rou-\ntine that the new location cannot fairly be described as an identical\nsetting.10\n\n   We note further that our interpretation of \"educational placement\"\nwould not change the result of the cases on which AW relies. The\nnumerous cases cited by AW reached their conclusions in the context\nof a clear change in setting under the definition described above, such\nas an indefinite expulsion. See, e.g., Honig, 484 U.S. at 312 (two\nemotionally disturbed students expelled indefinitely); Sch. Bd. of\nPrince William County v. Malone, 762 F.2d 1210, 1212 (4th Cir.\n  10\n    In his brief, AW notes that his February 2002 IEP, implemented just\ndays before the incident for which he was suspended, states that AW\n\"will be attending the GT center at Kilmer [Middle School],\" the school\nto which he would likely have continued, \"in 7th grade.\" J.A. 158. We\nare not persuaded that AW’s characterization of this statement as control-\nling of his future placement is correct, however. As a threshold matter,\nthe IDEA only requires that an IEP specify the location where the stu-\ndent’s special education and related services are to be received, not\nwhere the student pursues his general educational program. See\n§ 1414(d)(1)(A)(vi). Given that there are separate statutory and regula-\ntory provisions regarding \"placement,\" including provisions suggesting\nthat the IEP and placement issues are separate and successive consider-\nations, see, e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 300.300(a)(3)(ii) (stating that placement\ndecisions should be made based on the child’s \"unique needs\"); 34\nC.F.R. pt. 300, app. A (noting that \"[t]he appropriate placement for a par-\nticular child . . . cannot be determined until after decisions have been\nmade about the child’s needs and the services that the public agency will\nprovide\"), we find it incongruous to conclude that any statement in a cur-\nrent IEP regarding future placement should be controlling. Second,\nAW’s February 2002 IEP was superseded in April when AW’s IEP team\nreconvened in the wake of AW’s suspension as required by § 1415(k)\nand instituted a revised IEP that omitted any reference to future place-\nment. Although AW’s parents indicated their dissatisfaction with AW’s\nApril IEP by declining to sign it, the right conferred by the IDEA on par-\nents to participate in the formulation of their child’s IEP does not consti-\ntute a veto power over the IEP team’s decisions. See White, 343 F.3d at\n380 (collecting cases). Third, our review of the materials in the joint\nappendix reveals no other basis to conclude the FCSB could not unilater-\nally elect to deny AW enrollment at the junior high of his choice had the\nMarch 2002 incident not occurred.\n\f14               AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\n1985) (expulsion for remainder of school year); Kaelin v. Grubbs, 682\nF.2d 595, 598 (6th Cir. 1982) (expulsion for remainder of school\nyear); S-1 v. Turlington, 635 F.2d 342, 348 (5th Cir. 1981)\n(\"[E]xpulsion is still a proper disciplinary tool under the (Education\nfor all Handicapped Children Act) . . . when proper procedures are\nutilized and under proper circumstances.\"), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Honig, 484 U.S. at 317; cf. Hale, 280 F.3d at 832 (transfer\nfrom home schooling to a school). Under our interpretation of \"educa-\ntional placement,\" such actions would still violate the \"stay-put\" pro-\nvision as they constitute clear and permanent changes in setting.\nBecause the FCSB’s decision to change the location of AW’s assign-\nment did not result in a change in educational setting, we find the\ntransfer decision did not violate the \"stay-put\" provision.11\n\n                                     IV.\n\n   AW’s substantive challenge to the FCSB’s transfer decision\naddresses the adequacy of the MDR committee’s determination that\nhis disability did not factor into the conduct for which he was sus-\npended. As noted above, the IDEA requires that before any school\ncan discipline a student, the school must determine whether the stu-\ndent’s misconduct is related to the student’s disability. If it is, the\nschool officials are confined to the limited disciplinary measures\n  11\n     Finally, even if the \"stay-put\" provision were violated here, the cir-\ncumstances of this case appear to foreclose the possibility of relief. At\nthe time of the transfer in April 2002, AW was just months away from\ngraduating from sixth grade and moving on to the seventh grade at\nanother school. While the \"stay-put\" provision does remain in effect until\nthe conclusion of both administrative and judicial review, including this\nappeal and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court, Verhoeven v.\nBrunswick Sch. Comm., 207 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1999), it would be\nunworkable at this juncture to return AW to his \"then-current educational\nplacement\" as defined in his brief. AW does not seek to use the \"stay-\nput\" provision, as he interprets it, to return to his educational placement\nas it existed prior to his transfer: his sixth-grade classroom at his original\nschool. Rather he seeks to return to the junior high school track that\nwould have flowed from the earlier assignment. However, AW would\nhave been subject to the transfer at the conclusion of the review process,\nmaking the junior high school track applicable to the school to which he\nwas ultimately transferred the appropriate one.\n\f                AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                     15\ndescribed in § 1415(k)(1)(A)(i). However, if the MDR committee\nconcludes that the child’s disability did not factor into the student’s\nconduct, then the school may discipline that student as it would any\nother. See § 1415(k)(5).\n\n   The issues the MDR committee must consider are clearly defined\nby the IDEA. The MDR committee must gather \"all relevant informa-\ntion,\" including any \"evaluation or diagnostic results,\" any \"observa-\ntions of the child,\" and \"the child’s IEP and placement.\" See\n§ 1415(k)(4)(C)(i). The MDR committee must then decide whether:\n(1) \"the child’s IEP and placement were appropriate and the special\neducation services . . . were provided consistent with the child’s IEP\nand placement\"; (2) the child’s disability impaired his ability to\nunderstand \"the impact and consequences of the behavior subject to\ndisciplinary action\"; and (3) the child’s disability impaired his ability\n\"to control the behavior subject to disciplinary action.\"\n§ 1415(k)(4)(C)(ii).\n\n    The parties disagree as to the nature of AW’s disability. Although\nit is undisputed that AW suffers from ADHD and ODD, the hearing\nofficer and district court concluded that these disorders did not figure\nin the \"emotional disability,\" J.A. 72, that rendered AW eligible for\nspecial education under the IDEA. The hearing officer and district\ncourt concluded instead that these conditions constituted \"social mal-\nadjustment,\" id., which was not a basis for coverage under the IDEA,\nand therefore the MDR committee need not have inquired whether\nthese conditions impacted the adequacy of AW’s IEP or his conduct.\n\n   Based on our review of the record, we conclude the MDR commit-\ntee’s conclusion was sound, although for slightly different reasons\nthan relied on by the district court. AW’s IDEA eligibility form is\nonly marginally instructive, as it states that AW is eligible based on\nhis \"difficulties maintaining focus and completing academic tasks as\nrequired\" and avoiding \"many tasks, especially when they involve\nwriting.\" J.A. 135. Additionally, the form notes that \"Social Malad-\njustment has been ruled out as the PRIMARY cause of identified\ncharacteristics,\" id., but does not exclude the possibility that it plays\na secondary role in his qualifying disability.\n\n  A psychological and educational evaluation conducted in Decem-\nber 2000, however, indicates that while ADHD was a central feature\n\f16              AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\nof the emotional disability that qualified AW for special education\nservices under the IDEA, ODD was not. In that evaluation, a psychol-\nogist at AW’s elementary school concluded that AW’s primary diffi-\nculty was his inability to concentrate and hyperactivity, two\nundisputed symptoms of ADHD. Although the evaluation also noted\nAW’s tendency towards \"frequent confrontations with authority fig-\nures,\" and that \"[t]his behavioral pattern may also lead to difficulties\nrelating to peers at times,\" id. at 171 (emphasis added), the evaluation\nnevertheless makes clear that AW’s primary difficulty was behavior\nassociated with ADHD that hampered his ability to thrive education-\nally. The psychologist concluded that \"structure, consistency, predict-\nability, and immediate feedback are critical in the development of any\nplan to address difficulties related to attention, impulsivity and con-\ncentration,\" and recommended that due to AW’s hyperactivity,\n\"teachers [should] consider a variety of modifications in his school\nprogram,\" which would apparently include the very special education\nservices subsequently implemented through AW’s IEP. Id. at 173\n(emphasis added). By contrast, with respect to AW’s \"interpersonal\nand emotional difficulties,\" the evaluation concluded that outside\ncounseling should be encouraged. Id. This evaluation strongly sug-\ngests that ADHD figured prominently in AW’s qualifying disability,\nbut ODD did not.\n\n   We therefore find no error in the MDR committee’s conclusion that\nAW’s IEP and placement in a general curriculum GT program was\nappropriate, and that his ADHD did not figure into the behavior for\nwhich he was to be disciplined. With respect to the adequacy of AW’s\nIEP, we note that the IEPs of February 2001 and February 2002\nfocused on the complications occasioned in AW’s schoolwork by his\nADHD and identified his \"social/emotional\" difficulties as a matter\nfor out-of-school counseling with a private counselor. This approach\nconforms to the recommendations made by the school psychologist in\nhis evaluation of AW just prior to AW’s IDEA eligibility determina-\ntion. Moreover, nothing in the IEPs or the school psychologist’s eval-\nuation suggests that AW’s interpersonal difficulties were so\nsubstantial that they could not be managed by outside counseling or\nthat they would be exacerbated by being placed in the general GT cur-\nriculum with other students.\n\n   We likewise find no basis in the administrative record to conclude\nthat ADHD figured into the conduct for which AW was disciplined.\n\f               AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                    17\nIt is undisputed that AW is an intelligent student, and that AW was\nnot only aware of the consequences of sending the threatening mes-\nsage to the targeted student, but anticipated them by enlisting another\nstudent to actually place the note. To the extent that students with\nADHD may be described as impulsive, the circumstances of the con-\nduct for which AW was disciplined indicated forethought and investi-\ngation, as he had to figure out a way to gain access to his target’s\npersonal folder. Given these circumstances, we find no error in the\nMDR committee’s conclusion that AW’s IEP and placement were\nappropriate to his ADHD, and that his ADHD did not figure into the\nconduct for which he was disciplined by the FCSB.\n\n                                  V.\n\n   Because we find that the specific location where the student is\nbeing educated is not controlling in a determination of educational\nplacement in this context, and that the MDR committee’s evaluation\nwas appropriate given the nature of AW’s disability, we find no error\nin the reasoning of the DPR Officer or the district court. Accordingly,\nthe district court’s order is\n\n                                                         AFFIRMED.\n\f",

FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\nfax, Virginia, for Appellee. ON BRIEF: Jennifer L. Redmond,\nBLANKINGSHIP & KEITH, Fairfax, Virginia; Thomas J. Cawley,\nHUNTON & WILLIAMS, McLean, Virginia, for Appellee.\n\n\n                              OPINION\n\nDUNCAN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   AW, a disabled student in Fairfax County, Virginia, appeals the\ndistrict court’s judgment in favor of the Fairfax County School Board\n(\"FCSB\") in his suit under the Individuals with Disabilities Education\nAct, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487 (West 2000 & Supp. 2003) (\"the\nIDEA\"). In his complaint, AW asserted that the FCSB improperly\nrefused to allow him to enroll at his preferred junior high school after\na pattern of misbehavior in the preceding school year resulted in his\nmid-year transfer to an elementary school that sent its students on to\na different junior high school. Specifically, AW alleged that the\nFCSB’s transfer decision violated the procedural and substantive pro-\ntections afforded him under the IDEA, including its \"stay-put\" provi-\nsion requiring that the student’s \"educational placement\" not change\nwhile disciplinary proceedings are pending. Because we conclude that\nthe term \"educational placement\" as used in the stay-put provision\nrefers to the overall educational environment rather than the precise\nlocation in which the disabled student is educated, we affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   In March 2002, AW was a sixth-grade student assigned to the\n\"gifted and talented\" program (the \"GT program\") at his elementary\nschool. During the prior school year, a committee at AW’s school\nconcluded that AW was eligible to receive special education assis-\ntance under the IDEA as a student with an emotional disability. That\ndetermination resulted in the formulation of an Individualized Educa-\ntional Program (\"IEP\") for AW that devoted one hour of each school\nweek to specialized education intended to alleviate AW’s \"difficulty\nmaintaining focus and completing academic tasks as required\" and\navoidance of \"many tasks, especially when they involve writing.\" J.A.\n135. AW successfully completed the remainder of his fifth-grade\n\f                AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                     3\nyear, and his IEP was revised the following year in accordance with\nIDEA procedure.\n\n   As a sixth-grader, AW began exhibiting behavior problems he had\nnot displayed during the first year of his IDEA program. These disci-\nplinary issues culminated in a March 2002 incident in which AW per-\nsuaded another student to place a threatening note in the computer file\nof a student that AW disliked.2 In the ensuing inquiry, AW admitted\nthat his intent was to scare the targeted student away from school.\nBased on his admission and past behavioral problems, school admin-\nistrators suspended AW from school for two school weeks and initi-\nated proceedings to expel AW.\n\n   As required by the IDEA, school officials convened a Manifesta-\ntion Determination Review (\"MDR\") committee in order to determine\nthe extent to which AW could be disciplined. Under the IDEA, a dis-\nabled student may not be disciplined by his school unless an MDR\ncommittee concludes that the student’s IEP was appropriate relative\nto his qualifying disability and that the student’s disability did not\ninhibit his capacity either to appreciate that his behavior was inappro-\npriate or to conform his behavior to expectations. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(k)(4) (2000). On the ninth day of AW’s suspension, the MDR\ncommittee concluded that AW’s IEP appropriately compensated for\nhis emotional disability and that AW’s disability did not prevent him\nfrom either understanding that his actions violated school rules or\nbehaving appropriately. This finding opened the door for the FCSB\nto discipline AW as it would any other student. See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(k)(5) (2000). The following day, however, a FCSB adminis-\ntrator rejected the expulsion recommendation from the administrators\nof AW’s school and directed instead that AW be transferred to the GT\nprogram at another FCSB elementary school for the remainder of the\nschool year. It is undisputed that AW would continue to receive the\none hour per week of special education at this new location.\n\n   Despite the transfer determination, AW returned to his original\nschool at the conclusion of his suspension to complete the final week\nof school before spring break. During this week, AW continued to\n  2\n   That message, which appeared anonymously in the targeted student’s\naccount, read \"DEATH AWAITS YOU.\"\n\f4              AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\nreceive GT program course work but was separated from his class and\nassigned instead to an empty classroom. As the week drew to a close,\nAW’s parents invoked their right under the due process procedures of\nthe IDEA to a review of the MDR determination. The appointed due\nprocess review officer (\"DPR Officer\") issued a pre-hearing decision\nstaying the FCSB administrator’s transfer decision, and AW returned\nto his original school following spring break.\n\n   At the April 17, 2002 hearing regarding the MDR committee’s\nfindings, AW’s psychologist testified that AW had Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\") and Oppositional Defiance Disor-\nder (\"ODD\"). AW’s psychologist opined that AW’s IEP failed to ade-\nquately compensate for ODD and that AW’s combination of\nconditions figured prominently in the behavior for which he was dis-\nciplined. Nevertheless, the DPR Officer concluded that the MDR\ncommittee’s conclusion was sound and that the FCSB could transfer\nAW to a nearby school with a comparable GT program, based in part\non his conclusion that the evidence did not support the findings of\nAW’s psychologist. The DPR Officer’s order released the FCSB to\ntransfer AW to another elementary school located approximately five\nmiles away from AW’s original school, and AW completed his sixth-\ngrade year at that school.\n\n   Following their unsuccessful attempts to enroll AW at the junior\nhigh he would likely have attended but for his transfer, AW’s parents\nfiled the complaint in this case on AW’s behalf on August 16, 2002.\nThe complaint alleged that the FCSB violated the IDEA’s \"stay-put\"\nprovision by transferring AW despite the ongoing challenge to the\nMDR committee’s determination under the IDEA’s review proce-\ndures, and that the MDR committee erred in concluding that AW\ncould be disciplined as any other student. The district court granted\njudgment in favor of the FCSB, and AW timely appealed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n  This Court reviews the district court’s interpretation of the IDEA\nde novo.

See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1414(d)(1)(2000). Procedurally, the IDEA \"guarantee[s] parents\nboth an opportunity for meaningful input into all decisions affecting\ntheir child’s education and the right to seek review of any decisions\nthey think inappropriate.\" Honig, 484 U.S. at 311-12.

First, AW asserts that his\nmid-year transfer by the FCSB violates the \"stay-put\" provision of the\nIDEA, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j)(2000), as the due process review guaran-\nteed to AW’s parents under the IDEA was still proceeding. Second,\nAW challenges the substantive determination by the MDR committee\nthat allowed the FCSB to discipline AW in the same manner as any\nnon-disabled student. We consider each issue in turn.\n  3\n     A FAPE constitutes an education that is specifically designed \"to\nmeet the unique needs of the [disabled] child, supported by such services\nas are necessary to permit the child to benefit from the instruction.\" Todd\nv.

FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\n                                  III.\n\n   The first issue raised by AW in this appeal is whether the FCSB’s\ndecision to transfer him mid-year to the GT program at another school\nviolated the \"stay-put\" provision of the IDEA. This provision man-\ndates that \"during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursu-\nant to this section, . . . the child shall remain in the then-current\neducational placement of such child,\" absent the consent of school\nofficials and the parents. Id. (emphasis added). AW argues that the\nterm \"educational placement\" encompasses not simply the particular\nschool to which the student is assigned, but the very classroom in\nwhich he or she receives his or her instruction. According to AW, the\n\"stay-put\" provision thus requires the FCSB to keep him not only in\nthe GT program, but to keep him in the specific GT program class-\nroom to which he was originally assigned. In response, the FCSB\nargues that \"educational placement\" cannot have so specific a defini-\ntion. The FCSB maintains that the \"stay-put\" provision protects\nagainst a change in overall educational environment, rather than phys-\nical location. We must therefore determine what Congress meant by\nthe term \"educational placement\" and whether the FCSB’s transfer of\nAW constituted a change in his then-current educational placement.\n\n                                  A.\n\n   In interpreting a statute, we start with the text of the provision at\nissue, which here states that school officials may not change a stu-\ndent’s \"then-current educational placement\" while disciplinary pro-\nceedings are pending. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j). By mandating that the\nstudent’s \"educational placement\" remain undisturbed for the duration\nof any proceedings related to the disciplinary decision, the \"stay-put\"\nprovision circumscribes school officials’ ability to unilaterally disci-\npline students covered by the IDEA.

To that end, the Court has\nheld that the \"stay-put\" provision is not so limiting as to prevent\nschool officials from resorting to temporary changes short of exclu-\nsion, including \"the use of study carrels, timeouts, detention, or the\nrestriction of privileges.\" Id.

However, the Supreme Court has clari-\nfied that temporary changes in location do not violate the \"stay-put\"\nprovision provided they do not result in a diminution of the educa-\ntional services to which the student is entitled. Since the circum-\nstances of AW’s transfer do not fall into either category, resolution\nof this appeal requires a clearer definition of the term \"educational\nplacement.\"\n\n                                    B.\n\n   Because the IDEA does not define \"educational placement\" and, as\na term of art, the term lacks an ordinary meaning, we must examine\n\ncial’s decision to temporarily assign a student to an \"interim alternative\neducational setting [or] another setting,\" or to suspend the student, con-\nstitutes an explicitly authorized \"change in the placement of a child with\na disability.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1415(k)(1)(A)(i) (2000). This provision tracks\nthe holding in Honig: that school officials may resort to temporary sus-\npensions or lesser disciplinary measures without effecting a change in the\nstudent’s \"educational placement.\" 484 U.S. at 325. Although the IDEA\ndoes not define \"placement\" or \"setting\" either, it uses these terms in the\ncontext of a disciplinary provision which places them in contradistinction\nto a student’s educational environment prior to being disciplined. See\n§ 1415(k)(1)(A)(i). The least dramatic departure from the student’s envi-\nronment authorized by the IDEA is an assignment to an \"interim alterna-\ntive educational setting,\" which the IDEA describes as a setting that\nallows the student to continue his educational program without interrup-\ntion. See §§ 1415(k)(1)(A)(i), (3)(B)(i). At the other end of the spectrum\nis suspension, an option which permits the school to deny the student\naccess to both his or her regular educational program and the school\nitself. Thus, a change in \"placement\" occurs when a school places the\nstudent in a setting that is distinguishable from the educational environ-\nment to which the student was previously assigned.\n\f10              AW v.

See, e.g., Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n180-82 (1982) (discussing precursor to the IDEA); Bd. of Educ. v.

The LRE requirement reflects the IDEA’s\npreference that \"[t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with\ndisabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other\ncare facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled.\" See\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5) (2000); 34 C.F.R. § 300.550(b)(1). However,\nthis preference for \"mainstreaming\" disabled students is not absolute;\n§ 1412(a)(5) permits the delivery of educational services to disabled\nstudents in less integrated settings as necessitated by the student’s dis-\nability. A.B. ex rel. D.B. v. Lawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784649\"><a href=\"/opinion/784649/ab-a-minor-by-his-parent-and-next-friend-db-db-v-kenneth-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (4th Cir.\n2004).\n\n   Although the foregoing indicates that the definition of \"educational\nplacement\" should reflect the \"mainstreaming\" ideal of the LRE\nrequirement, it does not appear that the term also includes the precise\nphysical location where a disabled student is educated. The LRE\nrequirement directs that the disabled student be assigned to a setting\nthat resembles as closely as possible the setting to which he would be\nassigned if not disabled. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 202-03 & n.24. The\nIDEA’s concern with location thus focuses on the degree to which\nany particular assignment segregates a disabled student from non-\ndisabled students, rather than on the precise location of the assign-\nment itself. Given the IDEA’s concern with \"mainstreaming\" and\nappropriate educational content, we find little support in the IDEA’s\nunderlying principles for AW’s assertion that \"educational placement\"\nshould be construed to secure his right to attend school in a particular\nclassroom at a particular location.\n\f                AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                      11\n                                   C.\n\n   The IDEA’s emphasis on educational content and instructional\nenvironment are reflected in the regulations promulgated by the\nDepartment of Education. Indeed, in a recent case, the parents of a\ndisabled student challenged the school district’s decision to transfer\ntheir disabled child to another school as violative of the IDEA’s \"stay-\nput\" provision by citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.552 (2003), which provides\ncriteria for determining a disabled student’s \"‘educational place-\nment.’\" White ex rel. White v. Ascension Parish Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"32147\"><a href=\"/opinion/32147/white-v-ascension-parish-sch/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 379-80 (5th Cir. 2003). Noting the directive in § 300.552 that\nthe \"placement\" assignment be \"as close as possible to the child’s\nhome\" and that the child be \"educated in the school that he or she\nwould attend if nondisabled,\" the parents argued that \"educational\nplacement\" extends to the particular building to which their child was\nassigned. 343 F.3d at 379-80.\n\n   As noted by the White court, however, another provision in the reg-\nulations undercuts this interpretation and suggests that the regulations\ncontinue the IDEA’s concern with the extent to which any particular\nassignment reflected the \"mainstreaming\" ideal, rather than the pre-\ncise location of that assignment. Section 300.551 describes different\n\"placement\" options that school boards must make available to dis-\nabled students, including \"regular classes, special classes, special\nschools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institu-\ntions.\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.551 (2003). Noting that these options were\ndifferentiated from each other by the extent to which they departed\nfrom a \"mainstream\" assignment, the court concluded that the term\n\"placement\" as used in the regulations refers only to the setting in\nwhich the student is educated, rather than the precise location. See\n343 F.3d at 380. To the extent § 300.552(b) states that school officials\nshall ensure that the placement \"is as close as possible to the child’s\nhome,\" this language does not mandate that the student be assigned\nto the closest school, but simply to one that is as \"close as possible.\"8\n  8\n   At argument, counsel for AW argued that the school officials and\nhearing officer in question lacked the authority to transfer AW during the\nschool year, apparently relying on 8 Va. Admin. Code § 20-80-68(C)\n(2001). While we are aware of cases holding that \"state standards that\n\f12               AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\n   Consideration of the structure and the goals of the IDEA as a\nwhole, in addition to its implementing regulations, reinforces our con-\nclusion that the touchstone of the term \"educational placement\" is not\nthe location to which the student is assigned but rather the environ-\nment in which educational services are provided. To the extent that\na new setting replicates the educational program contemplated by the\nstudent’s original assignment and is consistent with the principles of\n\"mainstreaming\" and affording access to a FAPE, the goal of protect-\ning the student’s \"educational placement\" served by the \"stay-put\"\nprovision appears to be met. Likewise, where a change in location\nresults in a dilution of the quality of a student’s education or a depar-\nture from the student’s LRE-compliant setting, a change in \"educa-\ntional placement\" occurs.9\n\n                                    D.\n\n   In light of our conclusion that \"educational placement\" fixes the\noverall instructional setting in which the student receives his educa-\ntion, rather than the precise location of that setting, we conclude that\nAW’s transfer between such materially identical settings does not\nimplicate the \"stay-put\" provision of § 1415(j). See White, 343 F.3d\nat 380. The parties do not dispute that the GT program at the nearby\nelementary school to which the FCSB transferred AW was materially\nidentical in its educational offerings and that AW would be placed in\nan identical setting (a regular GT program classroom). Moreover,\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that the new location selected\n\nimpose a greater duty to educate disabled children,\" if consistent with\nfederal standards, \"are enforceable in federal court under the IDEA,\"\nErickson, 199 F.3d at 1122 (internal quotations omitted), § 20-80-68(C)\naddresses \"[l]ong-term removals\" and, as noted above, the transfer did\nnot constitute a removal from AW’s setting.\n  9\n    We recognize the possibility that a transfer to a different school might\nentail a commute so long or arduous as to negatively impact the student’s\nability to excel in the otherwise identical setting. However, we are not\nconfronted by this issue in this appeal. The materials provided by the\nparties indicate that the schools at issue are separated by less than five\nmiles; the school to which AW was transferred is less than two miles far-\nther away from his home.\n\f                 AW v.

The\nnumerous cases cited by AW reached their conclusions in the context\nof a clear change in setting under the definition described above, such\nas an indefinite expulsion.

We\nare not persuaded that AW’s characterization of this statement as control-\nling of his future placement is correct, however. As a threshold matter,\nthe IDEA only requires that an IEP specify the location where the stu-\ndent’s special education and related services are to be received, not\nwhere the student pursues his general educational program. See\n§ 1414(d)(1)(A)(vi). Given that there are separate statutory and regula-\ntory provisions regarding \"placement,\" including provisions suggesting\nthat the IEP and placement issues are separate and successive consider-\nations, see, e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 300.300(a)(3)(ii) (stating that placement\ndecisions should be made based on the child’s \"unique needs\"); 34\nC.F.R. pt. 300, app. A (noting that \"[t]he appropriate placement for a par-\nticular child . . . cannot be determined until after decisions have been\nmade about the child’s needs and the services that the public agency will\nprovide\"), we find it incongruous to conclude that any statement in a cur-\nrent IEP regarding future placement should be controlling. Second,\nAW’s February 2002 IEP was superseded in April when AW’s IEP team\nreconvened in the wake of AW’s suspension as required by § 1415(k)\nand instituted a revised IEP that omitted any reference to future place-\nment. Although AW’s parents indicated their dissatisfaction with AW’s\nApril IEP by declining to sign it, the right conferred by the IDEA on par-\nents to participate in the formulation of their child’s IEP does not consti-\ntute a veto power over the IEP team’s decisions. See White, 343 F.3d at\n380 (collecting cases). Third, our review of the materials in the joint\nappendix reveals no other basis to conclude the FCSB could not unilater-\nally elect to deny AW enrollment at the junior high of his choice had the\nMarch 2002 incident not occurred.\n\f14               AW v.

Hale, 280 F.3d at 832 (transfer\nfrom home schooling to a school). Under our interpretation of \"educa-\ntional placement,\" such actions would still violate the \"stay-put\" pro-\nvision as they constitute clear and permanent changes in setting.\nBecause the FCSB’s decision to change the location of AW’s assign-\nment did not result in a change in educational setting, we find the\ntransfer decision did not violate the \"stay-put\" provision.11\n\n                                     IV.\n\n   AW’s substantive challenge to the FCSB’s transfer decision\naddresses the adequacy of the MDR committee’s determination that\nhis disability did not factor into the conduct for which he was sus-\npended. As noted above, the IDEA requires that before any school\ncan discipline a student, the school must determine whether the stu-\ndent’s misconduct is related to the student’s disability. If it is, the\nschool officials are confined to the limited disciplinary measures\n  11\n     Finally, even if the \"stay-put\" provision were violated here, the cir-\ncumstances of this case appear to foreclose the possibility of relief. At\nthe time of the transfer in April 2002, AW was just months away from\ngraduating from sixth grade and moving on to the seventh grade at\nanother school. While the \"stay-put\" provision does remain in effect until\nthe conclusion of both administrative and judicial review, including this\nappeal and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court, Verhoeven v.\nBrunswick Sch. Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198645\"><a href=\"/opinion/198645/verhoeven-v-brunswick-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 1999), it would be\nunworkable at this juncture to return AW to his \"then-current educational\nplacement\" as defined in his brief. AW does not seek to use the \"stay-\nput\" provision, as he interprets it, to return to his educational placement\nas it existed prior to his transfer: his sixth-grade classroom at his original\nschool. Rather he seeks to return to the junior high school track that\nwould have flowed from the earlier assignment. However, AW would\nhave been subject to the transfer at the conclusion of the review process,\nmaking the junior high school track applicable to the school to which he\nwas ultimately transferred the appropriate one.\n\f                AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                     15\ndescribed in § 1415(k)(1)(A)(i). However, if the MDR committee\nconcludes that the child’s disability did not factor into the student’s\nconduct, then the school may discipline that student as it would any\nother. See § 1415(k)(5).\n\n   The issues the MDR committee must consider are clearly defined\nby the IDEA. The MDR committee must gather \"all relevant informa-\ntion,\" including any \"evaluation or diagnostic results,\" any \"observa-\ntions of the child,\" and \"the child’s IEP and placement.\" See\n§ 1415(k)(4)(C)(i). The MDR committee must then decide whether:\n(1) \"the child’s IEP and placement were appropriate and the special\neducation services . . . were provided consistent with the child’s IEP\nand placement\"; (2) the child’s disability impaired his ability to\nunderstand \"the impact and consequences of the behavior subject to\ndisciplinary action\"; and (3) the child’s disability impaired his ability\n\"to control the behavior subject to disciplinary action.\"\n§ 1415(k)(4)(C)(ii).\n\n    The parties disagree as to the nature of AW’s disability. Although\nit is undisputed that AW suffers from ADHD and ODD, the hearing\nofficer and district court concluded that these disorders did not figure\nin the \"emotional disability,\" J.A. 72, that rendered AW eligible for\nspecial education under the IDEA. The hearing officer and district\ncourt concluded instead that these conditions constituted \"social mal-\nadjustment,\" id., which was not a basis for coverage under the IDEA,\nand therefore the MDR committee need not have inquired whether\nthese conditions impacted the adequacy of AW’s IEP or his conduct.\n\n   Based on our review of the record, we conclude the MDR commit-\ntee’s conclusion was sound, although for slightly different reasons\nthan relied on by the district court. AW’s IDEA eligibility form is\nonly marginally instructive, as it states that AW is eligible based on\nhis \"difficulties maintaining focus and completing academic tasks as\nrequired\" and avoiding \"many tasks, especially when they involve\nwriting.\" J.A. 135. Additionally, the form notes that \"Social Malad-\njustment has been ruled out as the PRIMARY cause of identified\ncharacteristics,\" id., but does not exclude the possibility that it plays\na secondary role in his qualifying disability.\n\n  A psychological and educational evaluation conducted in Decem-\nber 2000, however, indicates that while ADHD was a central feature\n\f16              AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD\nof the emotional disability that qualified AW for special education\nservices under the IDEA, ODD was not. In that evaluation, a psychol-\nogist at AW’s elementary school concluded that AW’s primary diffi-\nculty was his inability to concentrate and hyperactivity, two\nundisputed symptoms of ADHD. Although the evaluation also noted\nAW’s tendency towards \"frequent confrontations with authority fig-\nures,\" and that \"[t]his behavioral pattern may also lead to difficulties\nrelating to peers at times,\" id. at 171 (emphasis added), the evaluation\nnevertheless makes clear that AW’s primary difficulty was behavior\nassociated with ADHD that hampered his ability to thrive education-\nally. The psychologist concluded that \"structure, consistency, predict-\nability, and immediate feedback are critical in the development of any\nplan to address difficulties related to attention, impulsivity and con-\ncentration,\" and recommended that due to AW’s hyperactivity,\n\"teachers [should] consider a variety of modifications in his school\nprogram,\" which would apparently include the very special education\nservices subsequently implemented through AW’s IEP. Id. at 173\n(emphasis added). By contrast, with respect to AW’s \"interpersonal\nand emotional difficulties,\" the evaluation concluded that outside\ncounseling should be encouraged. Id. This evaluation strongly sug-\ngests that ADHD figured prominently in AW’s qualifying disability,\nbut ODD did not.\n\n   We therefore find no error in the MDR committee’s conclusion that\nAW’s IEP and placement in a general curriculum GT program was\nappropriate, and that his ADHD did not figure into the behavior for\nwhich he was to be disciplined. With respect to the adequacy of AW’s\nIEP, we note that the IEPs of February 2001 and February 2002\nfocused on the complications occasioned in AW’s schoolwork by his\nADHD and identified his \"social/emotional\" difficulties as a matter\nfor out-of-school counseling with a private counselor. This approach\nconforms to the recommendations made by the school psychologist in\nhis evaluation of AW just prior to AW’s IDEA eligibility determina-\ntion. Moreover, nothing in the IEPs or the school psychologist’s eval-\nuation suggests that AW’s interpersonal difficulties were so\nsubstantial that they could not be managed by outside counseling or\nthat they would be exacerbated by being placed in the general GT cur-\nriculum with other students.\n\n   We likewise find no basis in the administrative record to conclude\nthat ADHD figured into the conduct for which AW was disciplined.\n\f               AW v. FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD                    17\nIt is undisputed that AW is an intelligent student, and that AW was\nnot only aware of the consequences of sending the threatening mes-\nsage to the targeted student, but anticipated them by enlisting another\nstudent to actually place the note. To the extent that students with\nADHD may be described as impulsive, the circumstances of the con-\nduct for which AW was disciplined indicated forethought and investi-\ngation, as he had to figure out a way to gain access to his target’s\npersonal folder. Given these circumstances, we find no error in the\nMDR committee’s conclusion that AW’s IEP and placement were\nappropriate to his ADHD, and that his ADHD did not figure into the\nconduct for which he was disciplined by the FCSB.\n\n                                  V.\n\n   Because we find that the specific location where the student is\nbeing educated is not controlling in a determination of educational\nplacement in this context, and that the MDR committee’s evaluation\nwas appropriate given the nature of AW’s disability, we find no error\nin the reasoning of the DPR Officer or the district court. Accordingly,\nthe district court’s order is\n\n                                                         AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
