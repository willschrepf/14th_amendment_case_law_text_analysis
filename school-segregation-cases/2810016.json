We deny appellant's motion for rehearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe City of Dripping Springs entered into agreements with two landowners in the\r\nCity's extraterritorial jurisdiction, Cypress-Hays, L.P. and Mak Foster Ranch, L.P.  The agreements\r\ncontemplated the landowners' development of portions of their property for residential, commercial,\r\nand recreational use.  The agreements were approved by the city council in public meetings during\r\nApril 2001.  Appellant Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. (\"SOS Alliance\") filed suit alleging that the\r\nagreements would result in added pollution to the environmentally sensitive Edwards Aquifer.  In\r\nits petition, SOS Alliance sought a declaration that the agreements violated the Texas Constitution,\r\nand alleged that the public notices regarding the city council's approval of the agreements did\r\nnot sufficiently communicate the subject matter of the meetings as required by the Texas Open\r\nMeetings Act.  The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on SOS Alliance's\r\nOpen Meetings Act claim, granted the defendants' pleas to the jurisdiction on the remaining claims\r\nbased on SOS Alliance's lack of standing, and awarded the defendants attorneys' fees.  We affirm\r\nthe judgment of the district court.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Factual and Procedural Background</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter notice and a public hearing on April 10, 2001, the City of Dripping Springs\r\nentered into a \"Development Agreement\" with Cypress-Hays, L.P.  This agreement authorized\r\ndevelopment on approximately 2,724 acres of land owned by Cypress-Hays in the City's\r\nextraterritorial jurisdiction in Hays County.  After notice and a public hearing on April 19, 2001,\r\nthe City entered into a similar \"Development Agreement\" with Mak Foster Ranch, L.P.  This\r\nagreement authorized development on approximately 1,611 acres of land owned by Mak Foster\r\nin the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction in Hays County.  Both Development Agreements\r\ncontemplated development of the land as master-planned, mixed-use communities with commercial\r\nand residential uses, as well as park and recreational facilities.  Under the Agreements, Cypress-Hays\r\nand Mak Foster could develop the land according to agreed-upon standards, in exchange for\r\nthe City's pledge that the standards would remain consistent for a period of 15 years (with up to two\r\n5-year extensions).<sup> (1)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to protecting the Barton Springs\r\nsegment of the Edwards Aquifer, which is located almost entirely in Hays and Travis Counties. \r\nAccording to SOS Alliance, water from the aquifer's \"contributing zone,\" in which the City of\r\nDripping Springs is located, flows eastward on creeks into the \"recharge zone,\" where the water\r\nmoves underground through caves, sinkholes, and other openings to fill or \"recharge\" the aquifer. \r\nMost of the water from this segment of the aquifer emerges at Barton Springs in Austin, Texas,\r\nwhich is on the northeast corner of the two zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn November 2002, SOS Alliance filed suit against the City of Dripping Springs and\r\nTodd Purcell in his official capacity as mayor of the City of Dripping Springs (collectively, the\r\n\"City\"), challenging the municipality's authority to enter into the Development Agreements and the\r\nsufficiency of the information in the public notices for the meetings at which the Agreements were\r\nconsidered and approved.<sup> (2)</sup>  Four months later, SOS Alliance added Cypress-Hays and appellee\r\nMak Foster as defendants in the lawsuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAlthough some authority existed for cities to enter into certain types of development\r\nagreements for land in their extraterritorial jurisdiction, <em>see</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. § 42.044\r\n(West 2008), the legislature expanded cities' authority to enter into such agreements during the\r\n2003 legislative session. <em> See</em> Act of May 24, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 522, § 1, 2003 Tex. Gen.\r\nLaws 1788, 1788-89 (codified at Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 212.171-.174 (West 2008)).  The\r\n2003 legislation included a provision that resulted in the retroactive validation of the\r\nDevelopment Agreements.  <em>See</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. § 212.172(h).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter this legislation was enacted, on May 11, 2004, SOS Alliance filed its\r\nsecond amended petition--the live pleading in this case when judgment was entered--seeking\r\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys' fees.  In its petition, SOS Alliance alleged that the\r\nDevelopment Agreements violate the Texas Constitution by impinging on the right of local self-government, impairing the preservation of a republican form of government, and contracting away\r\nlegislative powers.  SOS Alliance further alleged that the City violated the Texas Open Meetings Act\r\nby issuing public notices that insufficiently stated the subject of the Development Agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment, and the defendants also\r\nfiled pleas to the jurisdiction challenging SOS Alliance's standing to pursue its claims.  On July 26,\r\n2004, the district court granted the defendants' pleas to the jurisdiction as to all of SOS Alliance's\r\nclaims except the alleged violations of the Open Meetings Act and, after a hearing, granted\r\nsummary judgment in favor of appellees as to the Open Meetings Act claim.  The parties and the\r\ncourt agreed to try the remaining issue of attorneys' fees on written submission, and the court\r\nsubsequently granted the defendants' requested fees.  The district court entered a final judgment on\r\nNovember 29, 2004, incorporating all of its prior orders.  SOS Alliance appeals.<sup> (3)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Standing</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn its first and second points on appeal, SOS Alliance asserts that the district court's\r\ngranting of appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction as to SOS Alliance's claims that do not relate to the\r\nOpen Meetings Act was in error.  A plea to the jurisdiction challenges the trial court's authority\r\nto determine the subject matter of a specific cause of action.  <em>See Texas Dep't of Parks &amp; Wildlife\r\nv. Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d 217, 225-26 (Tex. 2004).  We review de novo whether a court has subject-matter jurisdiction and whether the plaintiff has alleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate subject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em> at 226.  In deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, we are not to consider\r\nthe merits of the plaintiff's claims beyond the extent necessary to resolve the jurisdiction issue,\r\nbut consider the plaintiff's pleadings, construed in the plaintiff's favor, and evidence pertinent\r\nto the jurisdictional inquiry.  <em>Id.</em> at 227-28; <em>County of Cameron v. Brown</em>, 80 S.W.3d 549, 555\r\n(Tex. 2002).  SOS Alliance contends that its pleadings and jurisdictional evidence are sufficient to\r\nestablish jurisdiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSubject-matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a case,\r\nand standing is a component of subject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>See Texas Ass'n of Bus. v. Texas Air\r\nControl Bd.</em>, 852 S.W.2d 440, 443-45 (Tex. 1993).  A plaintiff must have standing for the court\r\nto have subject-matter jurisdiction to decide the merits of the plaintiff's claims.  <em>See id.</em>; <em>Farmers\r\nTex. County Mut. Ins. Co. v. Romo</em>, 250 S.W.3d 527, 532 (Tex. App.--Austin 2008, no pet.).  The\r\nplaintiff must allege facts that affirmatively demonstrate the court's jurisdiction to hear the cause. \r\n<em>Texas Ass'n of Bus.</em>, 852 S.W.2d at 446.  The general test for standing is whether there is a real\r\ncontroversy between the parties that will actually be determined by the judicial declaration sought. \r\n<em>Id.</em>  Standing focuses on the question of who may bring a lawsuit.  <em>Patterson v. Planned Parenthood</em>,\r\n971 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex. 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance sues on behalf of its members.  An association has standing to sue\r\non behalf of its members when (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own\r\nright, (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose, and (3) neither\r\nthe claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the\r\nlawsuit.  <em>Texas Ass'n of Bus.</em>, 852 S.W.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver.\r\nComm'n</em>, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  The first prong of associational standing may be satisfied\r\nif at least one of the organization's members would have standing individually.  <em>See Hays County\r\nv. Hays County Water Planning P'ship</em>, 106 S.W.3d 349, 357 (Tex. App.--Austin 2003, no pet.). \r\nThe Supreme Court has observed that the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\" of individual\r\nstanding contains three elements:  (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact,\" an invasion\r\nof a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized, and that is actual or imminent rather\r\nthan conjectural or hypothetical, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the\r\ndefendant and not the independent action of a third party not before the court, and (3) it must\r\nbe likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife</em>,\r\n504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); <em>see Brown v. Todd</em>, 53 S.W.3d 297, 305 (Tex. 2001) (\"[W]e may look\r\nto the similar federal standing requirements for guidance.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance alleges several distinct injuries to its members by which it asserts to\r\nhave standing in this lawsuit:  (1) members who enjoy Barton Springs pool and its surroundings\r\nfor its recreational, scenic, or scientific value allege injury from increased pollution in the aquifer;\r\n(2) members who live near the land subject to the Development Agreements and who use well water\r\nexpress concern of pollution to the water; (3) members who are residents of Dripping Springs\r\nallege that the Agreements injured their procedural interests in using democratic means to prevent\r\ndevelopment activities that would further pollute Barton Springs; (4) members who pay property\r\ntaxes to the City allege injury from the City's expenditure of public funds under the Agreements; and\r\n(5) members who live near the land subject to the Agreements express concern about increased lights\r\nduring the nighttime, increased road traffic, and decreased property values.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<em>Injury to Environmental, Scientific, and Recreational Interests in Barton Springs</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance argues that it has standing due to environmental injury related to\r\nthe Barton Springs pool in Austin.  SOS Alliance alleges that many of its members regularly swim\r\nin the Barton Springs pool, and many of them enjoy Barton Springs and Barton Creek for other\r\nrecreational activities and for purposes of observing and contemplating nature.  One member claimed\r\nthat, as a scientist, he has a professional and educational interest in the Barton Springs salamander. \r\nSOS Alliance alleges that the Development Agreements will result in an increase in pollution in the\r\naquifer, which will contribute to the declining health of Barton Springs--including the reduction of\r\nwater quality, plant life, numbers of fish, and population of the Barton Springs salamander--which\r\nwill in turn injure SOS Alliance's members' \"environmental, scientific, and recreational interests.\" \r\nSOS Alliance contends that injury to these types of interests has been \"widely recognized\" to\r\nconfer standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Texas cases cited by SOS Alliance to support standing based on environmental\r\nharm involve plaintiffs who own property affected by the defendant's actions.  In <em>Lake Medina\r\nConservation Society v. Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission</em>, an organization sued\r\nfor review of a state commission's order authorizing a water control and improvement district's\r\ndiversion of water from a lake.  980 S.W.2d 511, 513-15 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. denied). \r\nThis Court held that the organization's members would have standing in their own right because they\r\nowned waterfront property, waterfront businesses, and private wells in the area.  <em>See id.</em> at 515-16. \r\nIn <em>Heat Energy Advanced Technology, Inc. v. West Dallas Coalition for Environmental Justice</em>,\r\nan application for a renewal permit for a hazardous and industrial waste storage and processing\r\nfacility was challenged by a coalition of nearby residents, but the administrative agency determined\r\nthe coalition did not have standing to participate in the hearing.  962 S.W.2d 288, 289-90\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. denied).  This Court held that the agency erred in its determination,\r\nconcluding that the proximity of a member's home to the facility, combined with that member's\r\nallegation of odors affecting his breathing, was sufficient to confer standing.  <em>See id.</em> at 295.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also relies on this Court's opinion in <em>Texas Rivers Protection Ass'n\r\nv. Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission</em>, 910 S.W.2d 147 (Tex. App.--Austin 1995,\r\nwrit denied).  In that case, a state commission granted a permit for the diversion of water from\r\nthe Guadalupe River, despite a challenge by the Texas Rivers Protection Association (TRPA) to\r\nthe application.  <em>See</em> 910 S.W.2d at 150-51.  On appeal, the party to whom the permit was issued\r\nchallenged the TRPA's standing to seek judicial review of the permit.  <em>See id.</em> at 151-52.  A member\r\nof the TRPA owned property fronting the affected area of the river and testified that the diversion\r\nof water would injure his \"aesthetic and recreational interests in the river.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 151.  This Court\r\nstated, \"An injury need not affect 'vested' property rights to confer standing; the harm may be\r\neconomic, recreational, or environmental.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 151-52.  SOS Alliance contends that because its\r\nmembers have alleged recreational and environmental harm, it has shown a sufficient injury in fact\r\nfor purposes of standing.  However, this Court's view of the type of harm that can constitute an\r\ninjury in fact for purposes of standing in <em>Texas Rivers</em> was coupled with the determination that\r\nthe TRPA member's \"riparian ownership alone sufficiently distinguishes [his] injury from that of\r\nthe public at large.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 151.  The plaintiff in <em>Texas Rivers </em>had no vested right in the river itself,\r\nbut had property rights affected by the defendant's actions upstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe <em>Texas Rivers</em> case, therefore, does not stand for the proposition that an allegation\r\nof any type of recreational or environmental impact, by itself, constitutes an injury in fact sufficient\r\nto confer standing.  Instead, this Court in <em>Texas Rivers</em> concluded that while environmental harm\r\nmay be a cognizable injury for purposes of standing, it was the harm to the plaintiff's riparian\r\ninterests that made the injury sufficiently particularized so as to distinguish the harm from that\r\nexperienced by the general public.  <em>See id.</em> at 151-52; <em>Brown</em>, 53 S.W.3d at 302 (\"Our decisions have\r\nalways required a plaintiff to allege some injury distinct from that sustained by the public at large.\"). \r\nIn sum, we do not find any Texas case in which an alleged injury to a plaintiff's environmental,\r\nscientific, or recreational interests conferred standing in the absence of allegations that the plaintiff\r\nhas an interest in property affected by the defendants' actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLacking a member with a property interest in Barton Springs (the land alleged to\r\nbe polluted as a result of the Development Agreements contrary to SOS Alliance members'\r\nenvironmental, scientific, or recreational interests) or with property rights otherwise affected\r\nby Baron Springs's alleged pollution, SOS Alliance turns to federal case law to support its assertion\r\nof environmental standing.  SOS Alliance is correct that federal courts have recognized that\r\nenvironmental harm can constitute a cognizable injury for purposes of constitutional standing.  <em>See\r\nSierra Club v. Morton</em>, 405 U.S. 727, 734 (1972) (\"We do not question that this type of harm [to\r\nscenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife of a national park] may amount to an 'injury in\r\nfact' sufficient to lay the basis for standing . . . .\").  Moreover, federal courts have found standing\r\nfor this type of harm in the absence of the plaintiff possessing a property right where harm occurs. \r\nUnder federal case law, environmental plaintiffs adequately allege a particularized injury in\r\nfact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and\r\nrecreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.  <em>See Friends of the Earth,\r\nInc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc.</em>, 528 U.S. 167, 183 (2000).  SOS Alliance contends that we should\r\nfollow the federal courts' lead on this issue by determining that SOS Alliance's members'\r\nenvironmental interests are particularized, legally protected interests, even in the absence of\r\nownership of property impacted by the environmental harm.  <em>See Texas Ass'n of Bus.</em>, 852 S.W.2d\r\nat 444 (\"Because standing is a constitutional prerequisite to maintaining a suit under both federal and\r\nTexas law, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience of the federal courts on this\r\nsubject for any guidance it may yield.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tHowever, the federal cases cited by SOS Alliance, in which environmental harm\r\nis held to constitute an injury in fact for purposes of standing, involve the application of\r\nfederal environmental-protection statutes that prohibited the types of conduct alleged by the plaintiffs\r\nin those cases to have occurred.  The majority of the federal cases cited by SOS Alliance to\r\ndemonstrate that an injury in fact for purposes of standing may be environmental involve claims\r\nunder the federal Clean Water Act (CWA).<sup> (4)</sup>  <em>See</em> 33 U.S.C. § 1251 <em>et seq</em> (2001).  The CWA itself\r\nprovides for a private right of action.  A suit to enforce an effluent standard or limitation under\r\nthe CWA may be brought by any \"citizen,\" which is defined as \"a person or persons having an\r\ninterest which is or may be adversely affected.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 1365(a), (g).  This provision \"confers standing\r\nto enforce the Clean Water Act to the full extent allowed by the Constitution.\"  <em>Friends of the Earth,\r\nInc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp.</em>, 204 F.3d 149, 152 (4th Cir. 2000).  In these cases, then, the\r\nplaintiffs possessed a legally protected interest for purposes of standing by virtue of a federal statute. \r\n<em>See id.</em> at 156-57 (\"injury required by Article III may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal\r\nrights, the invasion of which creates standing\" (quoting <em>Warth v. Seldin</em>, 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975))).<sup> (5)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe few federal cases cited by SOS Alliance not involving the CWA--which\r\nhas a citizen-enforcement provision--also involved environmental-protection statutes.  In <em>Cantrell\r\nv. City of Long Beach</em>, 241 F.3d 674 (9th Cir. 2001), for example, the federal law sought to be\r\nenforced--the National Environmental Policy Act--included a federal policy to \"preserve important\r\nhistoric, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage.\"  241 F.3d at 679 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\r\n§ 4331(b)(4) (2003)).  Thus, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged\r\nan injury in fact for constitutional standing purposes in that they \"observed and enjoyed\" endangered\r\nbirds that could be evicted by the defendants' actions.  <em>Id.</em> at 679-82.  In short, each of the\r\nfederal cases cited by SOS Alliance that found the existence of standing where the alleged harm\r\nwas to environmental, scientific, or recreational interests involved a federal statute protecting those\r\nsame interests.<sup> (6)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tBased on this state and federal case law, we must address whether SOS Alliance\r\nhas established standing under Texas law to pursue its claims under the Uniform Declaratory\r\nJudgments Act (UDJA).  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§ 37.001-.011 (West 2008). \r\nUnder the UDJA, SOS Alliance must establish standing by alleging an injury in fact to a \"legally\r\nprotected interest which is . . . concrete and particularized.\"  <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U.S. at 560;\r\n<em>see Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue</em>, 34 S.W.3d 547, 555-56 (Tex. 2000) (as general rule, standing\r\nrequires interest distinct from general public, unless standing conferred by statute); <em>Texas Ass'n\r\nof Bus.</em>, 852 S.W.2d at 444 (UDJA \"merely a procedural device for deciding cases already within\r\na court's jurisdiction rather than a legislative enlargement of a court's power\"); <em>Frasier v. Yanes</em>,\r\n9 S.W.3d 422, 427 (Tex. App.--Austin 1999, no pet.) (\"A declaratory judgment declares the rights\r\nand duties or the status of parties in a justiciable controversy.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThere is no Texas authority for the proposition that the type of injury alleged by\r\nSOS Alliance in this case--injury to its members' environmental, scientific, and recreational\r\ninterests generally and without any interest in or connection to the real property involved--is the\r\ntype of interference with a legally protected interest or injury that confers standing as a matter of\r\nstate law.  SOS Alliance must show a particularized, legally protected interest that is actually\r\nor imminently affected by the alleged harm.  <em>See Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U.S. at 560-61.  SOS\r\nAlliance has alleged neither an environmental interest provided for or protected by statute (as is\r\npresent in the federal cases cited by SOS Alliance) nor a property interest subject to the recreational\r\nor environmental harm (as is present in the state cases cited by SOS Alliance).  Absent such\r\nallegations, there is no particularized, legally protected interest at stake in this context, as there\r\nis nothing to distinguish the environmental, scientific, or recreational concerns of SOS Alliance's\r\nmembers from the same concerns experienced by the public in general.  <em>See id.</em> at 560; <em>Nobles\r\nv. Marcus</em>, 533 S.W.2d 923, 927 (Tex. 1976).  Based on the existing state and federal case law, to\r\nfind standing under the circumstances here would, we think, be to expand Texas's standing\r\njurisprudence, and it is not our proper role as an intermediate appellate court to do so.  <em>See Petco\r\nAnimal Supplies, Inc. v. Schuster</em>, 144 S.W.3d 554, 565 (Tex. App.--Austin 2004, no pet.). \r\nTherefore, we decline to conclude that the environmental, scientific, and recreational interests\r\nasserted by SOS Alliance result in a \"concrete and particularized\" injury in fact, as is necessary to\r\nestablish standing under Texas law.<sup> (7)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<em>Injury to Landowners' Well Water</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also bases its assertion of standing on its members' concern about\r\npollution to their residential water use.  SOS Alliance relies on the affidavits of two members who\r\nuse well water for residential use.  One member alleges that he lives \"about one-quarter mile\" west\r\nof the Cypress Hays land and is \"concerned\" about \"pollution from Cypress' proposed golf courses\r\nand other development,\" and the other member alleges that she lives \"within the extraterritorial\r\njurisdiction of the City of Dripping Springs,\" owns an undeveloped residential lot \"within 200 feet\"\r\nof the Cypress Hays development, and is \"concerned\" about \"how pollution from a large\r\ndevelopment in the recharge zone of the Aquifer would [a]ffect the quality of the Aquifer water.\" \r\nWe need not determine whether the members' \"concern\" about pollution to well water on their\r\nproperty is a sufficiently particularized injury in fact for purposes of standing, because we conclude\r\nthat SOS Alliance has failed to demonstrate that the alleged harm is actual or imminent, rather than\r\nhypothetical or conjectural.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo have standing, SOS Alliance must allege an injury that is \"actual or imminent,\r\nnot hypothetical.\"  <em>See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Inman</em>, 252 S.W.3d 299, 304-05 (Tex. 2008).  The\r\ntwo members concerned about pollution to their water supply do not allege any connection between\r\nthe Development Agreements and their well water.  Neither member makes any reference to the\r\nproperty subject to the Mak Foster Development Agreement, and the only reference to the\r\nCypress Hays Development Agreement property is one of proximity.  According to SOS Alliance's\r\nexperts' affidavits, the Mak Foster development is located in the contributing zone, the Rutherford\r\nRanch development is located within the \"uniquely sensitive\" recharge zone, and both will\r\n\"contribute to the pollution load within wells in the Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer.\"  It is not\r\nenough, however, to allege that the Development Agreements will pollute <em>some</em> well water in\r\nthe area and that an SOS Alliance member uses well water in the area.  The potential harm to the\r\nmembers' well water must be more than speculative.  There must be some allegation or evidence\r\nthat would tend to show that the well water of the members in question will be affected by the action\r\nof which they complain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAccording to SOS Alliance's experts' affidavits, rainfall on the contributing zone\r\nflows east to the recharge zone, where it enters the underground aquifer, and then flows north\r\nand mostly resurfaces at the Barton Springs pool.  The experts further aver that pollutants from the\r\ndevelopments would be added to this run-off into the aquifer, and that there is already evidence\r\nof increased pollutants at the Barton Springs pool.  Given the specific description contained in\r\nSOS Alliance's jurisdictional evidence of the flow direction toward and within the aquifer, there\r\nmust be evidence in the record to show that the properties of the members who express concern\r\nabout pollution to their water supply are in a location that is at least potentially \"downflow\" from\r\nthe developments.  SOS Alliance did not present any allegations or evidence on this point.<sup> (8)</sup>  The fact\r\nthat the Mak Foster property is somewhere in the contributing zone and an SOS member's well\r\nis somewhere in the recharge zone is not, by itself, sufficient to show harm that is imminent and\r\nnot merely conjectural or speculative.  SOS Alliance has failed to allege or provide evidence of any\r\nactual or imminent impact from the approvals of the Development Agreements on the amount of\r\npollution to SOS Alliance's members' residential water supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<em>Procedural Injury</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance next points to its claims in its pleadings that the Development\r\nAgreements violate the Texas Constitution in that they impinge on the right of local self-government\r\n(citing Tex. Const. art. I, § 1), impair the preservation of a republican form of government (citing\r\nTex. Const. art. I, § 2), and contract away legislative and police powers (citing Tex. Const. art. I,\r\n§ 17).  According to SOS Alliance, some of its members reside within the city limits of\r\nDripping Springs or its extraterritorial jurisdiction and are opposed to the developments, and their\r\nability to act on their opposition has been eliminated as a result of the Development Agreements'\r\n\"immediate and certain effect of closing off the democratic process and democratic controls over the\r\ndevelopment of that tract of property for at least 15 years.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo establish standing to assert these alleged constitutional violations, SOS Alliance\r\nmust show an injury in fact.  <em>See Neeley v. West Orange-Cove Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 176 S.W.3d\r\n746, 774 (Tex. 2005) (\"Standing to assert a constitutional violation depends on whether the claimant\r\nasserts a particularized, concrete injury.\").  While SOS Alliance contends that the Development\r\nAgreements \"adversely and immediately impinge\" on its members' constitutional rights, the only\r\ninjury identified by SOS Alliance is \"procedural injury\" suffered by those members who reside\r\nwithin the city limits of Dripping Springs or its extraterritorial jurisdiction.  SOS Alliance relies on\r\ntwo federal cases for the proposition that injury to its members' procedural interests can be an injury\r\nin fact sufficient to show standing--<em>Sierra Club v. Marita</em>, 46 F.3d 606 (7th Cir. 1995), and <em>Natural\r\nResources Defense Council v. Abraham</em>, 223 F. Supp. 2d 162 (D.D.C. 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn <em>Marita</em>, the Seventh Circuit considered a \"forest management plan\" created by\r\nthe defendant, a plan with which subsequent natural resource management activities in the covered\r\narea had to comply.  <em>See</em> 46 F.3d at 610-11.  The court concluded that, for purposes of standing,\r\nthere was actual or imminent injury underlying the alleged procedural default even if the plan was\r\nnot implemented immediately.  <em>See id.</em> at 612.  The court was able to reach this conclusion because,\r\nas the Supreme Court has recognized, a plaintiff in federal court does not need to meet the normal\r\nstanding requirement of imminence when he seeks to assert a procedural right.  <em>See Defenders of\r\nWildlife</em>, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7.  However, for this to apply, the plaintiff must first be accorded the\r\nprocedural right.  <em>See id.</em>  The National Environmental Policy Act, which the court in <em>Marita</em> was\r\nconstruing, <em>see </em>46 F.3d at 612-13, is \"essentially a procedural statute,\" such that \"injury alleged\r\nto have occurred as a result of violating this procedural right confers standing.\"  <em>Idaho Conservation\r\nLeague v. Mumma</em>, 956 F.2d 1508, 1514 (9th Cir. 1992).  Thus, the court in <em>Marita</em>, in concluding\r\nthat the plaintiff had standing based on its procedural interests, was construing a statute that\r\nspecifically provided for the procedural rights at issue, the violation of which could confer standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLikewise, in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, the court's conclusion that\r\nthe plaintiffs had standing based on procedural injury was in the context of a statute that accorded\r\nthe plaintiffs specific procedural rights.  223 F. Supp. 2d at 178-79.  In that case, the plaintiffs\r\nalleged violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.  <em>See id.</em> at 167.  According to the court,\r\nthis federal law established procedural requirements, the requirements were \"designed to protect\r\nsome threatened concrete interest\" of the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged harm from\r\nthe defendant's failure to comply with those procedural requirements.  <em>Id.</em> at 178-80.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tUnlike in <em>Marita</em> and <em>Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, SOS Alliance does not\r\nsue based on a statute that accords SOS Alliance or its members specified procedural rights. \r\nSOS Alliance does not provide any argument or authority for the proposition that the constitutional\r\nprovisions, under which SOS Alliance asserts its claims, provide procedural protections akin to the\r\nfederal statutes at issue in the two federal cases cited, or that any such procedural protections exist\r\nin the absence of a statute that would accrue to the benefit of SOS Alliance or its members. \r\nTherefore, we decline to hold that SOS Alliance has standing based on harm to its members' non-specified procedural interests.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i); <em>Valadez v. Avitia</em>, 238 S.W.3d 843, 845\r\n(Tex. App.--El Paso 2007, no pet.) (\"Failure to cite legal authority or provide substantive analysis\r\nof the legal issue presented results in waiver of the complaint.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<em>Taxpayer Standing</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tNext, SOS Alliance asserts standing based on the taxpayer status of its members. \r\nTaxpayer standing is an exception to the general rule that the plaintiff must show a particularized\r\ninjury distinct from that suffered by the public.  <em>See Bland Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 34 S.W.3d at 555-56;\r\n<em>Hendee v. Dewhurst</em>, 228 S.W.3d 354, 373-74 (Tex. App.--Austin 2007, pet. denied).  A plaintiff\r\nrelying on taxpayer standing can seek to enjoin prospective expenditures of public funds, but cannot\r\nrecover funds already expended.  <em>Williams v. Huff</em>, 52 S.W.3d 171, 180 (Tex. 2001).  To establish\r\ntaxpayer standing, the plaintiff must show that (1) he is a taxpayer, and (2) public funds are to be\r\nexpended on the allegedly illegal activity.  <em>Id.</em> at 179.  SOS Alliance alleges that it has at least one\r\nmember who resides within the City of Dripping Springs and who pays property taxes on her\r\nhomestead.  SOS Alliance further alleges that the Development Agreements obligate the City to\r\nspend money on attorneys' fees defending the Development Agreements from challenges such as\r\nthis lawsuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo show that the City will expend public funds on attorneys' fees, SOS Alliance\r\nrefers to the Development Agreements' provision that in the event of a third-party lawsuit relating to\r\na Development Agreement, the City and the developer \"agree to cooperate in the defense of such suit\r\nor claim, and to use their respective best efforts to resolve the suit or claim.\"  This provision, by its\r\nplain terms, does not require the expenditure of public funds.  It does not address expenditures at all. \r\nRather, a separate provision of the Development Agreements addresses expenditures.  That provision\r\nrequires the developer to pay the City a deposit \"intended to cover all City legal . . . fees and\r\nadministrative expenses\" associated with the Agreement.  In the event fees and expenses incurred\r\nexceed the initial deposit, the developer is obligated to \"pay the additional fees and expenses upon\r\nthe City's request.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe decline to grant taxpayer standing based on expenses that taxpayers will never\r\nbear, given the developers' obligation to reimburse the City.  SOS Alliance has not shown that\r\nany public funds have been or will be expended by the City as a result of the allegedly illegal\r\nDevelopment Agreements.  Therefore, SOS Alliance has failed to establish taxpayer standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<em>Landowners' Non-Water-Related Concerns</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also points to its members' concerns about injuries that are distinct\r\nfrom increased pollution to the water entering the aquifer, specifically:  (1) increased traffic\r\ncongestion caused by the new residents of the developments, which in turn might increase traffic\r\nsafety hazards, (2) increased light interfering with appreciation of nighttime skies, and (3) decreased\r\nproperty value due to the prospect of nearby high-density development.  SOS Alliance asserts that\r\nit has standing because of these concerns of its members who live near the developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tEven assuming these members may have standing to sue in their own right, to have\r\nassociational standing SOS Alliance must show that the interests it seeks to protect are germane\r\nto the organization's purpose (the second prong of associational standing).  <em>See Texas Ass'n of Bus.</em>,\r\n852 S.W.2d at 447.  We note that, in this lawsuit, SOS Alliance seeks to protect its members'\r\nenvironmental interests, which <em>are</em> germane to its purpose.  However, to have associational standing,\r\nwe conclude that the interest that is \"germane to the organization's purpose\"--thereby satisfying the\r\nsecond prong--must also relate to the interest by which its members would \"have standing to sue\r\nin their own right\"--thereby satisfying the first prong.  <em>See Hays County v. Hays County Water\r\nPlanning P'Ship</em>, 106 S.W.3d 349, 357 (Tex. App.--Austin 2003, no pet.) (association was created\r\nto address \"these kinds of community issues\" by which its members showed standing to sue on their\r\nown behalf).  We do not think the associational standing factors are intended to permit an association\r\nthat has an interest against a challenged activity to obtain standing by adding a member who has\r\nindividual standing to sue based on his own unrelated interest against the same activity.  Therefore,\r\nSOS Alliance cannot satisfy the second prong of associational standing based on its members'\r\nenvironmental concerns, while satisfying the first prong solely based on certain members' unrelated\r\nconcerns regarding their property values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo establish standing based on its members' non-water-related concerns, then,\r\nSOS Alliance must show that <em>those</em> interests are germane to its purpose.  According to its petition,\r\nSOS Alliance is \"formed for the purpose of protecting the Edwards Aquifer with particular emphasis\r\non preventing further pollution of Barton Springs and reversing the water quality degradation of\r\nBarton Springs that has already occurred.\"  We are unpersuaded that increased time and danger for\r\nautomobile travel, impaired viewing of the night sky, and decreased property value for landowners\r\nin the Barton Springs contributing and recharge zones is \"germane to\" SOS Alliance's purpose of\r\nreducing water pollution in Barton Springs.  We recognize that SOS Alliance's mission to protect\r\nthe water that feeds Barton Springs would generally result in opposition to developments in\r\nthe contributing and recharge zones.  According to the affidavit of SOS Alliance's communications\r\ndirector, \"[a] significant amount of the activities of SOS Alliance are devoted to preventing or\r\nstopping governments from granting special favors to landowners and developers that facilitate\r\ndestructive development in the recharge and contributing zones.\"  It is equally apparent that a\r\nsuccessful opposition to development can, in turn, benefit such interests as low traffic and low\r\nlight levels for residents in the area.  However, the fact that SOS Alliance's mission would\r\nbenefit a member's interest does not mean that particular interest is included in--or germane\r\nto--SOS Alliance's purpose.<sup> (9)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance refers to two federal cases in which members of an environmental\r\norganization had standing based on diminished property value resulting from the defendant's\r\nconduct.  <em>See Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.</em>, 528 U.S. at 182-83; <em>Gaston Copper Recycling</em>, 204 F.3d at 156. \r\nAlthough neither case addresses the second prong of associational standing, we note that in both\r\ncases, the alleged decrease in property value was attributable to pollution by the defendant.  <em>See\r\nLaidlaw Envtl. Servs.</em>, 528 U.S. at 182-83 (member \"believed the pollutant discharges accounted for\r\nsome of the discrepancy\" in home value); <em>Gaston Copper Recycling</em>, 204 F.3d at 156 (member\r\nclaimed \"the pollution or threat of pollution has diminished the value of his property\").  Therefore,\r\nin those cases, the interest of the members who had standing individually (combating the pollution\r\nthat was lowering their property values) was germane to the purpose of the organization (combating\r\npollution in general).  Unlike in those cases, the SOS Alliance member who alleged a decrease in\r\nproperty value attributed the decrease solely to the fact that it was a \"high-density development.\" \r\nSOS Alliance's members' concerns that neighboring high-density developments will cause artificial\r\nlight sources to increase, road traffic to increase, and property values to decrease are not germane\r\nto SOS Alliance's mission to protect the Edwards Aquifer water.  Therefore, SOS Alliance has not\r\nmet the second prong of associational standing by alleging its members' concerns as landowners not\r\nrelated to Edwards Aquifer water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe affirm the district court's granting of appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction as to\r\nSOS Alliance's claims that are not related to the Open Meetings Act.<sup> (10)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Sufficiency of City's Public Notices</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn its third point on appeal, SOS Alliance contends that the district court erred in\r\ngranting summary judgment to appellees on SOS Alliance's cause of action under the Texas Open\r\nMeetings Act (the \"Act\").  In its petition, SOS Alliance alleged that the City's public notices\r\nregarding the Development Agreements failed to comply with the Act's requirement that the subject\r\nof a meeting be sufficiently set forth.  Section 551.041 of the Act requires that a governmental body\r\n\"give written notice of the date, hour, place, and <em>subject</em> of each meeting held by the governmental\r\nbody.\"  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.041 (West 2004) (emphasis added).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe review summary judgments de novo.  <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott</em>,\r\n128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2003).  Under the standard applicable to a traditional motion for\r\nsummary judgment, the motion should be granted only when the movant establishes that there\r\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); <em>Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co.</em>, 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985). \r\nWhen both parties move for summary judgment and the trial court grants one party's motion and\r\ndenies the other party's, as occurred in this case, the reviewing court should review both sides'\r\nsummary judgment evidence and determine all questions presented.  <em>FM Props. Operating Co.\r\nv. City of Austin</em>, 22 S.W.3d 868, 872 (Tex. 2000).  Thus, if the district court erred, we will reverse\r\nand render the judgment the court should have rendered.  <em>Id.</em>  In the event that the City's notices were\r\ninsufficient under the Act, the City's actions taken in connection with the defective portions of the\r\nnotices are voidable.  <em>See</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.141 (West 2004); <em>Point Isabel Indep. Sch.\r\nDist. v. Hinojosa</em>, 797 S.W.2d 176, 182-83 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1990, writ denied).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe public notice concerning the Cypress-Hays Development Agreement stated\r\nas follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Consider Approving a Development Agreement with Cypress-Hays, L.P., including\r\nadopting Ordinance No. 1280.1 Designating a District under Section 42.044 of the\r\nTexas Local Government Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The public notice concerning the Mak Foster Development Agreement, posted ten days\r\nlater, contained identical language, except that \"Cypress-Hays, L.P.\" was replaced with \"Mak Foster\r\nRanch, L.P.,\" and \"Ordinance No. 1280.1\" was replaced with \"Ordinance No. 1280.2.\" \r\nSOS Alliance complains that these notices insufficiently communicate the subject of the\r\nDevelopment Agreements because they do not alert a member of the public to the Agreements'\r\nsubstantial impact--including thousands of homes, central water and wastewater systems,\r\ncommercial development, and golf courses.  Moreover, the notices do not refer to the property\r\nlocations, the multiple variances from City ordinances,<sup> (11)</sup> or the time periods for which the\r\nAgreements could not be altered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Texas Supreme Court has noted that, under the notice requirements of the Act,\r\n\"less than full disclosure is not substantial compliance.\"  <em>Cox Enters., Inc. v. Board of Trs. of Austin\r\nIndep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 706 S.W.2d 956, 960 (Tex. 1986).  However, the supreme court has also held\r\nthat it is not necessary to \"state all of the consequences which may necessarily flow from the\r\nconsideration of the subject stated.\"  <em>Texas Turnpike Auth. v. City of Fort Worth</em>, 554 S.W.2d 675,\r\n676 (Tex. 1977).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe are guided by this Court's analysis in <em>Friends of Canyon Lake, Inc. v. Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority</em>, 96 S.W.3d 519 (Tex. App.--Austin 2002, pet. denied).  In that case, this\r\nCourt concluded that the following notice sufficiently described the applicable subject matter of\r\nthe meeting:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Water Purchase Contract among GBRA, CRWA, City of Cibolo, City of Marion,\r\nCity of Schertz, ECWSC, GVSUD, SHWSC, &amp; BMWD; Outline of Preliminary\r\nAgreement concerning joint participation in a treated water supply for portions of\r\nComal, Kendall, &amp; Bexar Counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>96 S.W.3d at 530.  The plaintiff complained that the notice was insufficient to inform the public\r\nthat the river authority would seek to double the amount of water to which it was entitled on an\r\nannual basis, sell a portion of the water outside its ten-county area, and require the construction of\r\n$75 million in improvements.  <em>See id.</em>  This Court recognized that the notice \"might not inform the\r\ncasual reader of the precise consequences\" of the agreements at issue, but held nonetheless that\r\nthe notice was sufficiently descriptive to satisfy the Act.  <em>See id.</em> at 531 (citing <em>Texas Turnpike Auth.</em>,\r\n554 S.W.2d at 676).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn this case, like the notice at issue in <em>Friends of Canyon Lake</em>, the City's\r\nnotices identified the applicable parties to the agreements and stated the type of agreement\r\nat issue--a development agreement.  Moreover, just as the notice in <em>Friends of Canyon Lake</em> set\r\nout the counties affected without specifying the precise area, the notices here referenced\r\nsection 42.044 of the local government code, which governs the creation of \"industrial districts\"\r\nwithin a municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. § 42.044(b)\r\n(West 2008).  Section 42.044 also provides that the municipality's contract with a landowner in\r\nthe industrial district can guarantee the district's immunity from annexation by the municipality\r\n\"for a period not to exceed 15 years.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 42.044(c)(1).  Therefore, a reader of the notices would\r\nbe informed that the subject of the meetings would include the potential approval of agreements\r\nwith Mak Foster and Cypress Hays that involved development, on property in the City's\r\nextraterritorial jurisdiction, and potentially with restrictions lasting up to 15 years.  The City was not\r\nobligated to state all the consequences that would flow from these Development Agreements.  <em>See</em>\r\n<em>Texas Turnpike Auth.</em>, 554 S.W.2d at 676.  Indeed, had the notices listed all the consequences that\r\nwould follow from the Development Agreements, including the variances to be provided and\r\nthe other issues highlighted by SOS Alliance, the result may have been to overwhelm, rather\r\nthan inform, the reader.  <em>See City of San Antonio v. Fourth Court of Appeals</em>, 820 S.W.2d 762, 766\r\n(Tex. 1991) (\"Far from serving the purposes of the Act, this degree of specificity would so\r\noverwhelm readers that it would prove even less informative than the current notice.\"); <em>see also\r\nTexas Turnpike Auth.</em>, 554 S.W.2d at 676 (not necessary to \"post copies of proposed resolutions\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance argues that the notices' omission of the location or size of the property\r\nsubject to the proposed Development Agreements is at variance from the City's standard notice\r\npractice.  SOS Alliance relies on <em>River Road Neighborhood Ass'n v. South Texas Sports</em>, which\r\nfound a notice insufficient under the Act based on \"the well established custom and practice\" of\r\nthe governmental body.  720 S.W.2d 551, 557 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1986, writ dism'd w.o.j.). \r\nIn that case, four public meetings had involved a similar subject matter, with the notices identifying\r\nthe purpose as \"discussion/action.\"  Because the notice for the fifth meeting stated only \"discussion,\"\r\nthe court held that the public was not properly alerted to the possibility that action would be taken. \r\n<em>See id.</em>  Here, however, SOS Alliance does not identify a \"well established custom and practice\"\r\napplicable to development agreements.  Instead, SOS Alliance refers to notice postings that involved\r\nzoning decisions.  The Development Agreements do not involve zoning.  <em>Cf.</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 212.003(a) (West 2008) (restricting municipality's ability to regulate in its extraterritorial\r\njurisdiction).  With no other public notice posting related to development agreements with the City\r\nin the record, SOS Alliance has not shown any well-established custom and practice that would be\r\nrelevant to the notices' sufficiency.<sup> (12)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also argues that a more detailed description of the subject matter was\r\nrequired because of the \"high level of public interest in these developments.\"  To show a heightened\r\npublic interest, SOS Alliance relies on affidavits of residents in the extraterritorial jurisdiction\r\nwho assert that they were among many citizens who attended subsequent city council meetings\r\nto raise their concerns regarding the Development Agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tEven assuming SOS Alliance has demonstrated a heightened public interest, we\r\nare not convinced that the notices' description of subject matter should be deemed insufficient as a\r\nresult.  In <em>Cox Enterprises</em>, the Texas Supreme Court held that, taking into account an increased level\r\nof public interest, the bare description \"personnel\" was insufficient to describe the selection of a\r\nnew school superintendent and the description \"litigation\" was insufficient to describe \"a major\r\ndesegregation lawsuit which has occupied the Board's time for a number of years, and whose\r\neffect will be felt for years to come.\"  706 S.W.2d at 959.  The City's notices in this case are much\r\nmore detailed than those in <em>Cox Enterprises</em>.  The City's notices state the parties involved, the\r\ntype of agreement at issue, that the extraterritorial jurisdiction would be impacted (based on the\r\nstatute included in the notice), and that the agreements might be approved as a result of the meeting. \r\nA reader interested in development in the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction would have had\r\nsufficient notice that the City was considering action relevant thereto.  <em>See Fourth Court of Appeals</em>,\r\n820 S.W.2d at 766; <em>Rettberg v. Texas Dep't of Health</em>, 873 S.W.2d 408, 411 (Tex. App.--Austin\r\n1994, no writ) (\"notice is sufficient under the Act when it alerts a reader that some action will be\r\ntaken relative to a topic\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tHaving concluded that the notices were sufficiently descriptive so as to state the\r\nsubjects of the meetings in accordance with section 551.041 of the Open Meetings Act, we overrule\r\nSOS Alliance's third point on appeal.<sup> (13)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Attorneys' Fees</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn its remaining points on appeal, SOS Alliance asserts that, even if we affirm the\r\ntrial court's granting of appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction and motions for summary judgment,\r\nthe district court erred in awarding attorneys' fees to Mak Foster.<sup> (14)</sup>  In a proceeding under the\r\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act, a court may award \"reasonable and necessary attorney's fees\r\nas are equitable and just.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009.  A trial court's award of\r\nattorneys' fees under the UDJA is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  <em>See Bocquet v. Herring</em>,\r\n972 S.W.2d 19, 20-21 (Tex. 1998).  A trial court abuses its discretion by awarding fees when there\r\nis insufficient evidence that the fees were reasonable and necessary, or when the award is inequitable\r\nor unjust.  <em>Id.</em> at 21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAs an initial matter, SOS Alliance argues that Mak Foster failed to segregate between\r\nits defense of claims for which recovery of attorneys' fees was proper and those for which\r\nsuch recovery was not proper.  <em>See West Beach Marina, Ltd. v. Erdeljac</em>, 94 S.W.3d 248, 267\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 2002, no pet.).  However, SOS Alliance fails to provide a reason for which any\r\nof its particular claims independently would not provide a valid basis for Mak Foster's recovery of\r\nattorneys' fees.  Regarding its Open Meetings Act claim, SOS Alliance refers to section 551.142 of\r\nthe Act, which permits a court to award the defendant reasonable attorneys' fees in an action by\r\nmandamus or injunction regarding a potential violation of the Act, provided that the court consider\r\nwhether the action was brought in good faith.  <em>See</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.142 (West 2004). \r\nAccording to its petition, however, SOS Alliance brought its Open Meetings Act claim as an action\r\nunder the UDJA, not as an action by mandamus or injunction under section 551.142.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.004(a).  Regarding its other claims, SOS Alliance questions whether\r\nthe district court had jurisdiction to award attorneys' fees that were incurred in connection with\r\nclaims over which the court determined it had no subject-matter jurisdiction.  The district court did\r\nhave this authority.<sup> (15)</sup>  <em>See id.</em> § 37.009 (court may award attorneys' fees in <em>any</em> proceeding under the\r\nUDJA); <em>Galveston County Comm'rs' Court v. Lohec</em>, 814 S.W.2d 751, 755 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 1991) (op. on reh'g) (court may award attorneys' fees incurred in defense of UDJA\r\nclaims brought by party without standing), <em>rev'd on other grounds</em>, 841 S.W.3d 361 (Tex. 1992).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also argues that Mak Foster failed to segregate between its defense of\r\nclaims asserted by SOS Alliance and those asserted by Friendship Alliance, the co-plaintiff\r\nthat settled with appellees.  \"A party seeking attorney fees has a duty . . . to segregate the fees owed\r\nby different parties.\"  <em>See French v. Moore</em>, 169 S.W.3d 1, 17 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.]\r\n2004, no pet.).  There is no duty to segregate, however, when the causes of action are dependent\r\nupon the same set of facts or circumstances and are intertwined to the point of being inseparable. \r\n<em>Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d 1, 11 (Tex. 1991).  Mak Foster relies on\r\nSOS Alliance's motion to consolidate to show that the claims asserted by the co-plaintiffs were\r\nintertwined,<sup> (16)</sup> but that motion is not in the appellate record.  Similarly, Friendship Alliance's petition\r\nis not in the record for our review.  We are limited to the appellate record provided.  <em>See</em> Tex. R.\r\nApp. P. 34.1; <em>Merchandise Ctr., Inc. v. WNS, Inc.</em>, 85 S.W.3d 389, 394 (Tex. App.--Texarkana\r\n2002, no pet.) (\"Materials outside the record . . . that are improperly included in or attached to a\r\nparty's brief . . . may not be considered by an appellate court in its review of the appeal on its\r\nmerits.\").  However, our review of what the record does contain gives us no reason to conclude\r\nthat Friendship Alliance's lawsuit did not involve the same set of facts and circumstances.  <em>See\r\nEnterprise Leasing Co. v. Barrios</em>, 156 S.W.3d 547, 550 (Tex. 2004) (\"If the pertinent\r\nsummary judgment evidence considered by the trial court is not included in the appellate record, an\r\nappellate court must presume that the omitted evidence supports the trial court's judgment.\").  We\r\nconclude that Mak Foster had no duty to segregate the fees owed by the co-plaintiffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tNext, SOS Alliance asserts that the evidence is insufficient to support an award\r\nof attorneys' fees in the amount requested by Mak Foster.  As a general rule, the party seeking\r\nto recover attorneys' fees carries the burden of proof.  <em>Stewart Title Guar. Co.</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 10. \r\nWhether an award of attorneys' fees is reasonable and necessary is a fact question.  <em>Bocquet</em>,\r\n972 S.W.2d at 21.  SOS Alliance contends that Mak Foster's evidence of attorneys' fees \"consists\r\nentirely of the conclusory, self-serving, affidavit[] of lead counsel[].\"  However, contrary to\r\nSOS Alliance's contention, that affidavit sets out the attorneys who performed the work, the number\r\nof hours billed by each, their hourly rates, and a description of the tasks for which legal services were\r\nperformed.  The affiant stated his qualifications and experience, and averred that:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>I am familiar with usual and customary rates charged by attorneys in the area for\r\ncases with comparable complexity and amounts in controversy, and the fees\r\ndescribed above are those customarily charged in this area for the same or similar\r\nservices by those with similar experience, reputation, and ability, considering the type\r\nof controversy, the time limitations imposed, the work involved, the results obtained\r\nand length of the firm's relationship with Mak Foster.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>SOS Alliance suggests that only fee bills with unredacted entries would be sufficient evidence of\r\nattorneys' fee amounts, but does not base its position on any legal authority.  We conclude that the\r\nevidence was sufficient to show Mak Foster's attorneys' fees were reasonable and necessary.  <em>See\r\nTexas Commerce Bank v. New</em>, 3 S.W.3d 515, 517-18 (Tex. 1999) (affidavit testimony in support\r\nof attorneys' fees legally sufficient where attorney detailed the services rendered and testified he was\r\nduly licensed attorney, he was familiar with usual and customary attorneys' fees in locality, and the\r\nfees sought were reasonable); <em>Brockie v. Webb</em>, 244 S.W.3d 905, 909-10 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2008,\r\npet. denied) (\"Generally, the nature and extent of the attorney's services are expressed by the number\r\nof hours and the hourly rate.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also contends that the attorneys' fees amount awarded to\r\nMak Foster--$86,200--is \"inequitable and unjust under the circumstances of this case for\r\na nonprofit organization dedicated to the public good.\"  Similar arguments were stated by\r\namicus curiae, who expressed concern that \"full fee awards for bringing environmental and\r\nopen government claims\" are a \"threat of financial intimidation\" that \"can only have a chilling effect\r\non the ability of community organizations to bring citizen suits on behalf of their members.\"  We\r\nreview whether attorneys' fees awarded under the UDJA are equitable and just under an abuse of\r\ndiscretion standard.  <em>See Bocquet</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 21.  An award can be inequitable or unjust even\r\nwhen the fees are reasonable and necessary.  <em>See id.</em>  However, when reviewing matters committed\r\nto the trial court's discretion, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\ntrial judge, and a trial court does not abuse its discretion merely because it decides a discretionary\r\nmatter differently than the appellate court would under similar circumstances.  <em>Baylor Univ. Med.\r\nCtr. v. Rosa</em>, 240 S.W.3d 565, 569 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2007, pet. denied).  The test for an abuse\r\nof discretion is whether the court acted without reference to guiding rules and principles.  <em>See Cire\r\nv. Cummings</em>, 134 S.W.3d 835, 838-39 (Tex. 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo show that the attorneys' fees award was not just and equitable, SOS Alliance\r\nrelies on its being a \"nonprofit organization dedicated to the public good\" and the \"significance\r\nof the matters at stake in this lawsuit and that SOS Alliance was at least somewhat successfully\r\naddressed.\"  We do not consider this, standing alone, to make the award of attorneys' fees to\r\nMak Foster inequitable or unjust.  It may very well have been equitable and just for the district court\r\n<em>not</em> to have awarded fees or to award some other amount, but that does not make this award\r\ninequitable or unjust.  <em>See Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. Lazy Nine Mun. Util. Dist.</em>, 198 S.W.3d\r\n300, 318-19 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2006, pet. denied) (holding that trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in awarding attorneys' fees to defendant in UDJA action, even though SOS Alliance was\r\n\"a local nonprofit organization,\" because \"reasonable minds can differ concerning whether the\r\nattorney's fees are just and equitable\").  The award was a matter of the district court's discretion, and\r\nwe do not consider the court to have abused its discretion in reaching the decision it did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tHaving concluded that the district court did not err in awarding attorneys' fees to\r\nMak Foster, we overrule SOS Alliance's remaining points on appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t__________________________________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tG. Alan Waldrop, Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Chief Justice Law, Justices Pemberton and Waldrop;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>     Chief Justice Law Not Participating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Affirmed on Motion for Rehearing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filed:   February 11, 2010\r\n</p><p>1.   Given that SOS Alliance's interests against the Development Agreements spring from\r\nenvironmental concerns, we note that the Agreements contain several environmental-protection\r\nprovisions, requiring the developers to (1) comply with applicable state rules \"designed to protect\r\nthe quality of the Edwards Aquifer,\" (2) obtain and comply with any required \"no-discharge\" permits\r\nregarding treated sewage effluent, (3) comply with any U.S. Army Corps of Engineers authorizations\r\nunder section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, (4) prepare and implement a \"stormwater pollution\r\nprevention plan,\" (5) ensure no adverse effect on listed endangered species or their critical habitat\r\nin accordance with the federal Endangered Species Act, and (6) implement certain voluntary\r\nenvironmental protection measures, including an integrated pest management program at any golf\r\ncourse, education of property owners, and buffering of sensitive drainage areas.\r\n</p><p>2.   During the same time period, another organization, Friendship Alliance, filed suit\r\nagainst the City challenging the legality of the Development Agreements.  The two lawsuits were\r\nconsolidated in early 2003.  Friendship Alliance settled its lawsuit in 2004 after certain amendments\r\nto the Agreements had been negotiated.\r\n</p><p>3.   SOS Alliance has dismissed its claims against Cypress-Hays, which is no longer a party\r\nto this case.  <em>See Save Our Springs Alliance v. City of Dripping Springs</em>, No. 03-04-00683-CV\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin Dec. 7, 2007) (per curiam) (order).  Also, on April 27, 2007, this Court issued\r\nan order staying the appeal due to SOS Alliance's declaration of bankruptcy.  On September 15,\r\n2008, on the motion of appellee Mak Foster, we reinstated the appeal.\r\n</p><p>4.   <em>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc.</em>, 528 U.S. 167, 173 (2000);\r\n<em>American Canoe Ass'n v. Murphy Farms, Inc.</em>, 326 F.3d 505, 509 (4th Cir. 2003); <em>Friends of the\r\nEarth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp.</em>, 204 F.3d 149, 153 (4th Cir. 2000); <em>Sierra Club\r\nv. Cedar Point Oil Co.</em>, 73 F.3d 546, 553 (5th Cir. 1996), <em>cert. denied</em>, 519 U.S. 811 (1996);\r\n<em>Sierra Club v. Simkins Indus., Inc.</em>, 847 F.2d 1109, 1111-12 (4th Cir. 1988), <em>cert. denied</em>, 491 U.S.\r\n904 (1989); <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Chevron Chem. Co.</em>, 900 F. Supp. 67, 70 (E.D. Tex. 1995).\r\n</p><p>5.   SOS Alliance asserts that section 26.177 of the Texas Water Code \"articulates standing\r\nrights at least as broad as the standing granted under the federal Clean Water Act.\"  Section 26.177\r\nauthorizes \"[a]ny person affected by any ruling, order, decision, ordinance, program, resolution, or\r\nother act of a city relating to water pollution control and abatement outside the corporate limits of\r\nsuch city\" adopted pursuant to statute to appeal such action to district court.  Tex. Water Code Ann.\r\n§ 26.177(d) (West 2008).  However, such a lawsuit must be filed within 60 days of the challenged\r\nact of the city.  <em>See id.</em>  Regardless of whether section 26.177 could apply to SOS Alliance and would\r\nprovide standing as broad as the CWA, SOS Alliance does not allege that it satisfied the 60-day\r\nrequirement.  The Development Agreements were approved in April 2001.  This lawsuit was filed\r\nin November 2002.  SOS Alliance has not asserted any claims under section 26.177, nor could it\r\nhave.  Moreover, SOS Alliance does not allege any other statute on which its standing to assert its\r\nclaims not related to the Open Meetings Act might be based.\r\n</p><p>6.   We note that this Court's holding in <em>Texas Rivers</em> that harm for purposes of\r\nstanding may be \"economic, recreational, or environmental\" appears to be connected to federal case\r\nlaw in which a federal statute protected such interests.  The Texas case from which the \"economic,\r\nrecreational, or environmental\" language originates is <em>Housing Authority of Harlingen v. State</em> in its\r\ngeneral statement of the test for standing.  539 S.W.2d 911, 913-14 (Tex. Civ. App.--Corpus Christi\r\n1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  As authority for the language, the court in <em>Housing Authority of Harlingen</em>\r\ncited several United States Supreme Court opinions, and appears to have taken its description of the\r\nscope of an injury in fact from <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp</em>,\r\n397 U.S. 150 (1970).  In that case, the Supreme Court observed that the legal interest required for\r\npurposes of standing \"may reflect 'aesthetic, conservational, and recreational' as well as economic\r\nvalues,\" provided that \"the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the\r\nzone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\" \r\n397 U.S. at 153-54.\r\n</p><p>7.   SOS Alliance contends that this conclusion ignores SOS Alliance's \"long and proud\r\nhistory\" of obtaining standing to challenge government actions.  SOS Alliance relies on <em>Save Our\r\nSprings Alliance, Inc. v. Lowry</em>, 934 S.W.2d 161 (Tex. App.--Austin 1996, orig. proceeding),\r\nas indicative of such standing.  However, that case involved standing based on a statute--the\r\nTexas Open Meetings Act.  <em>See </em>934 S.W.2d at 162.  That Act authorizes an \"interested person\" to\r\nfile suit.  <em>See</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.142(a) (West 2004).  According to <em>Lowry</em>, this statutory\r\nprovision dispenses with the standing requirement of an injury distinct from that of the general\r\npublic.  <em>Lowry</em>, 934 S.W.2d at 163.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tSimilarly, the San Marcos River Foundation (SMRF) filed a letter brief as amicus curiae,\r\nexpressing its concern that a determination in this case that SOS Alliance does not have standing\r\nbased on environmental harm would impair SMRF's future ability to litigate.  We note that in\r\n<em>City of San Marcos v. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality</em>--by which, SMRF asserts,\r\nit was successful in protecting the San Marcos River--a statute specifically authorized\r\njudicial review.  128 S.W.3d 264, 266 (Tex. App.--Austin 2004, pet. denied) (citing Tex. Water\r\nCode Ann. § 5.351 (West 2008)).  Thus, our adjudication of SOS Alliance's standing in the absence\r\nof such statutory provision will not likely affect SMRF's future ability to again file suit under\r\nthe same statute.\r\n</p><p>8.   SOS Alliance argues that it should not be required to \"hire experts to map and\r\ncalculate local hydrogeological flows to engage in debates about gradients of flows\" at this stage. \r\nWhether or not this is the case, SOS Alliance must at least provide evidence that a member \"used\r\nan area subject to contamination from the discharge.\" <em> American Canoe Ass'n</em>, 326 F.3d at 520.  In\r\nthe cases SOS Alliance cites on this issue, unlike here, there was evidence from which the court\r\ncould find that the consequences of the challenged action of the defendant would in fact extend to\r\nthe plaintiff.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> (members' use of river was downstream from polluting defendant); <em>Barshop\r\nv. Medina County Underground Water Conservation Dist.</em>, 925 S.W.2d 618, 624, 627 (Tex. 1996)\r\n(landowner over Edwards Aquifer challenges constitutionality of statute governing entire aquifer);\r\n<em>City of Canyon v. McBroom</em>, 121 S.W.3d 410, 415 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 2003, no pet.) (landowner\r\nin flood plain complaining of increased risk of flooding); <em>Lake Medina Conservation Soc'y v. Texas\r\nNatural Res. Conservation Comm'n</em>, 980 S.W.2d 511, 515-16 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. denied)\r\n(owners of lakefront property challenging removal of water from lake); <em>Texas Rivers Prot. Ass'n\r\nv. Texas Natural Res. Conservation Comm'n</em>, 910 S.W.2d 147, 151 (Tex. App.--Austin 1995,\r\nwrit denied) (property owners \"fronting the affected area of the river\" challenging diversion of\r\nwater from river).\r\n</p><p>9.   In fact, it appears more feasible that many of these members' interests as landowners might\r\neven be <em>contrary</em> to SOS Alliance's purpose.  SOS Alliance would likely welcome declining property\r\nvalues if they would enable SOS Alliance to place more watershed land into long-term conservation\r\neasements, and would likely welcome inconveniences such as increased traffic and light if the result\r\nwas surrounding areas becoming less desirable for home buyers and future real estate developers. \r\nMoreover, in the event that Mak Foster and Cypress Hays successfully develop their properties in\r\naccordance with the Development Agreements, we question whether SOS Alliance would\r\nsubsequently seek to protect those developments' interests in increasing property values as well.\r\n</p><p>10.   In its second point on appeal, SOS Alliance contends that the district court erred in\r\ngranting appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction based on the case not being ripe for adjudication as to\r\nany land that had not become subject to a finally approved plat, and based on the case being moot\r\nas to land that was subject to a finally approved plat that SOS Alliance neither appealed nor\r\nchallenged.  Given that we have determined that the court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction\r\nbased on standing, we need not consider the issues of ripeness or mootness.\r\n</p><p>11.   SOS Alliance alleges that the Cypress-Hays Development Agreement contains more than\r\n32 variances, including reduction of minimum lot size, reduction of minimum setbacks, and\r\nreduction of plat review and approval time.\r\n</p><p>12.   In fact, given that the Development Agreements were apparently without precedent as to\r\nthe City (SOS Alliance itself describes the developments as \"unprecedented in size and density for\r\nDripping Springs\"), it appears that the City actually followed its usual custom and practice.  The\r\nsecond notice--for the Mak Foster Development Agreement--was essentially identical to the first\r\nnotice--for the Cypress Hays Development Agreement.\r\n</p><p>13.   Appellees argue that any potential violations of the Act were validated by the legislature\r\nin 2003.  <em>See</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. § 212.172(h) (West 2008) (\"An agreement between a\r\nmunicipality and a landowner entered into prior to the effective date of this section and that complies\r\nwith this section is validated.\").  Because we conclude that SOS Alliance has not shown a violation\r\nof the Act, we need not address this argument.\r\n</p><p>14.   Due to a partial settlement between SOS Alliance and the City, SOS Alliance does not\r\nseek appellate review of the attorneys' fees awarded to the City.\r\n</p><p>15.   Neither of the cases cited by SOS Alliance suggests otherwise.  In <em>Gregg County\r\nAppraisal District v. Laidlaw Waste Systems, Inc.</em>, the statute at issue allowed attorneys' fees for a\r\nproperty owner who prevailed in his tax appeal.  907 S.W.2d 12, 21 (Tex. App.--Tyler 1995,\r\nwrit denied).  To the extent the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the owner's claims, he did\r\nnot \"prevail\" and, therefore, by statute was not entitled to attorneys' fees.  <em>Id.</em>  In <em>Lipshy Motorcars,\r\nInc. v. Sovereign Associates, Inc.</em>, 944 S.W.2d 68 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1997, no writ), an <em>appellate</em>\r\ncourt determined it had no jurisdiction to consider a motion for sanctions and attorneys' fees against\r\nan appellant who attempted to appeal a non-appealable interlocutory order.  944 S.W.2d at 70-72.\r\n</p><p>16.   According to Mak Foster, SOS Alliance represented in its motion to consolidate that the\r\nplaintiffs' lawsuits were \"based on identical facts and circumstances,\" asked for \"identical\r\ndeclaratory and nearly identical injunctive relief,\" and were based on \"identical legal grounds.\"</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

The agreements\r\ncontemplated the landowners' development of portions of their property for residential, commercial,\r\nand recreational use.  The agreements were approved by the city council in public meetings during\r\nApril 2001.  Appellant Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. (\"SOS Alliance\") filed suit alleging that the\r\nagreements would result in added pollution to the environmentally sensitive Edwards Aquifer.  In\r\nits petition, SOS Alliance sought a declaration that the agreements violated the Texas Constitution,\r\nand alleged that the public notices regarding the city council's approval of the agreements did\r\nnot sufficiently communicate the subject matter of the meetings as required by the Texas Open\r\nMeetings Act.  The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on SOS Alliance's\r\nOpen Meetings Act claim, granted the defendants' pleas to the jurisdiction on the remaining claims\r\nbased on SOS Alliance's lack of standing, and awarded the defendants attorneys' fees.  We affirm\r\nthe judgment of the district court.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Factual and Procedural Background</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter notice and a public hearing on April 10, 2001, the City of Dripping Springs\r\nentered into a \"Development Agreement\" with Cypress-Hays, L.P.  This agreement authorized\r\ndevelopment on approximately 2,724 acres of land owned by Cypress-Hays in the City's\r\nextraterritorial jurisdiction in Hays County.  After notice and a public hearing on April 19, 2001,\r\nthe City entered into a similar \"Development Agreement\" with Mak Foster Ranch, L.P.  This\r\nagreement authorized development on approximately 1,611 acres of land owned by Mak Foster\r\nin the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction in Hays County.  Both Development Agreements\r\ncontemplated development of the land as master-planned, mixed-use communities with commercial\r\nand residential uses, as well as park and recreational facilities.  Under the Agreements, Cypress-Hays\r\nand Mak Foster could develop the land according to agreed-upon standards, in exchange for\r\nthe City's pledge that the standards would remain consistent for a period of 15 years (with up to two\r\n5-year extensions).<sup> (1)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to protecting the Barton Springs\r\nsegment of the Edwards Aquifer, which is located almost entirely in Hays and Travis Counties. \r\nAccording to SOS Alliance, water from the aquifer's \"contributing zone,\" in which the City of\r\nDripping Springs is located, flows eastward on creeks into the \"recharge zone,\" where the water\r\nmoves underground through caves, sinkholes, and other openings to fill or \"recharge\" the aquifer. \r\nMost of the water from this segment of the aquifer emerges at Barton Springs in Austin, Texas,\r\nwhich is on the northeast corner of the two zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn November 2002, SOS Alliance filed suit against the City of Dripping Springs and\r\nTodd Purcell in his official capacity as mayor of the City of Dripping Springs (collectively, the\r\n\"City\"), challenging the municipality's authority to enter into the Development Agreements and the\r\nsufficiency of the information in the public notices for the meetings at which the Agreements were\r\nconsidered and approved.<sup> (2)</sup>  Four months later, SOS Alliance added Cypress-Hays and appellee\r\nMak Foster as defendants in the lawsuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAlthough some authority existed for cities to enter into certain types of development\r\nagreements for land in their extraterritorial jurisdiction, <em>see</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. § 42.044\r\n(West 2008), the legislature expanded cities' authority to enter into such agreements during the\r\n2003 legislative session. <em> See</em> Act of May 24, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 522, § 1, 2003 Tex. Gen.\r\nLaws 1788, 1788-89 (codified at Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 212.171-.174 (West 2008)).  The\r\n2003 legislation included a provision that resulted in the retroactive validation of the\r\nDevelopment Agreements.  <em>See</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. § 212.172(h).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAfter this legislation was enacted, on May 11, 2004, SOS Alliance filed its\r\nsecond amended petition--the live pleading in this case when judgment was entered--seeking\r\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys' fees.  In its petition, SOS Alliance alleged that the\r\nDevelopment Agreements violate the Texas Constitution by impinging on the right of local self-government, impairing the preservation of a republican form of government, and contracting away\r\nlegislative powers.  SOS Alliance further alleged that the City violated the Texas Open Meetings Act\r\nby issuing public notices that insufficiently stated the subject of the Development Agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment, and the defendants also\r\nfiled pleas to the jurisdiction challenging SOS Alliance's standing to pursue its claims.  On July 26,\r\n2004, the district court granted the defendants' pleas to the jurisdiction as to all of SOS Alliance's\r\nclaims except the alleged violations of the Open Meetings Act and, after a hearing, granted\r\nsummary judgment in favor of appellees as to the Open Meetings Act claim.  The parties and the\r\ncourt agreed to try the remaining issue of attorneys' fees on written submission, and the court\r\nsubsequently granted the defendants' requested fees.  The district court entered a final judgment on\r\nNovember 29, 2004, incorporating all of its prior orders.  SOS Alliance appeals.<sup> (3)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Standing</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn its first and second points on appeal, SOS Alliance asserts that the district court's\r\ngranting of appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction as to SOS Alliance's claims that do not relate to the\r\nOpen Meetings Act was in error.  A plea to the jurisdiction challenges the trial court's authority\r\nto determine the subject matter of a specific cause of action.  <em>See Texas Dep't of Parks &amp; Wildlife\r\nv.

The general test for standing is whether there is a real\r\ncontroversy between the parties that will actually be determined by the judicial declaration sought. \r\n<em>Id.</em>  Standing focuses on the question of who may bring a lawsuit.  <em>Patterson v.

An association has standing to sue\r\non behalf of its members when (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own\r\nright, (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose, and (3) neither\r\nthe claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the\r\nlawsuit.  <em>Texas Ass'n of Bus.</em>, 852 S.W.2d at 447 (quoting <em>Hunt v.

SOS Alliance alleges that many of its members regularly swim\r\nin the Barton Springs pool, and many of them enjoy Barton Springs and Barton Creek for other\r\nrecreational activities and for purposes of observing and contemplating nature.  One member claimed\r\nthat, as a scientist, he has a professional and educational interest in the Barton Springs salamander. \r\nSOS Alliance alleges that the Development Agreements will result in an increase in pollution in the\r\naquifer, which will contribute to the declining health of Barton Springs--including the reduction of\r\nwater quality, plant life, numbers of fish, and population of the Barton Springs salamander--which\r\nwill in turn injure SOS Alliance's members' \"environmental, scientific, and recreational interests.\" \r\nSOS Alliance contends that injury to these types of interests has been \"widely recognized\" to\r\nconfer standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe Texas cases cited by SOS Alliance to support standing based on environmental\r\nharm involve plaintiffs who own property affected by the defendant's actions.  In <em>Lake Medina\r\nConservation Society v. Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission</em>, an organization sued\r\nfor review of a state commission's order authorizing a water control and improvement district's\r\ndiversion of water from a lake.  980 S.W.2d 511, 513-15 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. denied). \r\nThis Court held that the organization's members would have standing in their own right because they\r\nowned waterfront property, waterfront businesses, and private wells in the area.  <em>See id.</em> at 515-16. \r\nIn <em>Heat Energy Advanced Technology, Inc. v. West Dallas Coalition for Environmental Justice</em>,\r\nan application for a renewal permit for a hazardous and industrial waste storage and processing\r\nfacility was challenged by a coalition of nearby residents, but the administrative agency determined\r\nthe coalition did not have standing to participate in the hearing.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774522/heat-energy-adv-technology-inc-v-west-dallas-coalit/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 289-90\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. denied).  This Court held that the agency erred in its determination,\r\nconcluding that the proximity of a member's home to the facility, combined with that member's\r\nallegation of odors affecting his breathing, was sufficient to confer standing.  <em>See id.</em> at 295.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also relies on this Court's opinion in <em>Texas Rivers Protection Ass'n\r\nv. Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1638214\"><a href=\"/opinion/1638214/texas-rivers-protection-v-nat-res-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span> (Tex. App.--Austin 1995,\r\nwrit denied).  In that case, a state commission granted a permit for the diversion of water from\r\nthe Guadalupe River, despite a challenge by the Texas Rivers Protection Association (TRPA) to\r\nthe application.  <em>See</em> 910 S.W.2d at 150-51.  On appeal, the party to whom the permit was issued\r\nchallenged the TRPA's standing to seek judicial review of the permit.  <em>See id.</em> at 151-52.  A member\r\nof the TRPA owned property fronting the affected area of the river and testified that the diversion\r\nof water would injure his \"aesthetic and recreational interests in the river.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 151.  This Court\r\nstated, \"An injury need not affect 'vested' property rights to confer standing; the harm may be\r\neconomic, recreational, or environmental.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 151-52.  SOS Alliance contends that because its\r\nmembers have alleged recreational and environmental harm, it has shown a sufficient injury in fact\r\nfor purposes of standing.  However, this Court's view of the type of harm that can constitute an\r\ninjury in fact for purposes of standing in <em>Texas Rivers</em> was coupled with the determination that\r\nthe TRPA member's \"riparian ownership alone sufficiently distinguishes [his] injury from that of\r\nthe public at large.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 151.  The plaintiff in <em>Texas Rivers </em>had no vested right in the river itself,\r\nbut had property rights affected by the defendant's actions upstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThe <em>Texas Rivers</em> case, therefore, does not stand for the proposition that an allegation\r\nof any type of recreational or environmental impact, by itself, constitutes an injury in fact sufficient\r\nto confer standing.  Instead, this Court in <em>Texas Rivers</em> concluded that while environmental harm\r\nmay be a cognizable injury for purposes of standing, it was the harm to the plaintiff's riparian\r\ninterests that made the injury sufficiently particularized so as to distinguish the harm from that\r\nexperienced by the general public.  <em>See id.</em> at 151-52; <em>Brown</em>, 53 S.W.3d at 302 (\"Our decisions have\r\nalways required a plaintiff to allege some injury distinct from that sustained by the public at large.\"). \r\nIn sum, we do not find any Texas case in which an alleged injury to a plaintiff's environmental,\r\nscientific, or recreational interests conferred standing in the absence of allegations that the plaintiff\r\nhas an interest in property affected by the defendants' actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLacking a member with a property interest in Barton Springs (the land alleged to\r\nbe polluted as a result of the Development Agreements contrary to SOS Alliance members'\r\nenvironmental, scientific, or recreational interests) or with property rights otherwise affected\r\nby Baron Springs's alleged pollution, SOS Alliance turns to federal case law to support its assertion\r\nof environmental standing.  SOS Alliance is correct that federal courts have recognized that\r\nenvironmental harm can constitute a cognizable injury for purposes of constitutional standing.  <em>See\r\nSierra Club v. Morton</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108502\"><a href=\"/opinion/108502/sierra-club-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 734 (1972) (\"We do not question that this type of harm [to\r\nscenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife of a national park] may amount to an 'injury in\r\nfact' sufficient to lay the basis for standing . . . .\").  Moreover, federal courts have found standing\r\nfor this type of harm in the absence of the plaintiff possessing a property right where harm occurs. \r\nUnder federal case law, environmental plaintiffs adequately allege a particularized injury in\r\nfact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons for whom the aesthetic and\r\nrecreational values of the area will be lessened by the challenged activity.  <em>See Friends of the Earth,\r\nInc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 183 (2000).  SOS Alliance contends that we should\r\nfollow the federal courts' lead on this issue by determining that SOS Alliance's members'\r\nenvironmental interests are particularized, legally protected interests, even in the absence of\r\nownership of property impacted by the environmental harm.  <em>See Texas Ass'n of Bus.</em>, 852 S.W.2d\r\nat 444 (\"Because standing is a constitutional prerequisite to maintaining a suit under both federal and\r\nTexas law, we look to the more extensive jurisprudential experience of the federal courts on this\r\nsubject for any guidance it may yield.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tHowever, the federal cases cited by SOS Alliance, in which environmental harm\r\nis held to constitute an injury in fact for purposes of standing, involve the application of\r\nfederal environmental-protection statutes that prohibited the types of conduct alleged by the plaintiffs\r\nin those cases to have occurred.  The majority of the federal cases cited by SOS Alliance to\r\ndemonstrate that an injury in fact for purposes of standing may be environmental involve claims\r\nunder the federal Clean Water Act (CWA).<sup> (4)</sup>  <em>See</em> 33 U.S.C. § 1251 <em>et seq</em> (2001).  The CWA itself\r\nprovides for a private right of action.  A suit to enforce an effluent standard or limitation under\r\nthe CWA may be brought by any \"citizen,\" which is defined as \"a person or persons having an\r\ninterest which is or may be adversely affected.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 1365(a), (g).  This provision \"confers standing\r\nto enforce the Clean Water Act to the full extent allowed by the Constitution.\"  <em>Friends of the Earth,\r\nInc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767710\"><a href=\"/opinion/767710/friends-of-the-earth-incorporated-citizens-local-environmental-action/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 152 (4th Cir. 2000).  In these cases, then, the\r\nplaintiffs possessed a legally protected interest for purposes of standing by virtue of a federal statute. \r\n<em>See id.</em> at 156-57 (\"injury required by Article III may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal\r\nrights, the invasion of which creates standing\" (quoting <em>Warth v.

In <em>Cantrell\r\nv. City of Long Beach</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772240\"><a href=\"/opinion/772240/anne-cantrell-an-individual-lou-anna-denison-an-individual-kenneth-n/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 2001), for example, the federal law sought to be\r\nenforced--the National Environmental Policy Act--included a federal policy to \"preserve important\r\nhistoric, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage.\"  241 F.3d at 679 (quoting 42 U.S.C.\r\n§ 4331(b)(4) (2003)).  Thus, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged\r\nan injury in fact for constitutional standing purposes in that they \"observed and enjoyed\" endangered\r\nbirds that could be evicted by the defendants' actions.  <em>Id.</em> at 679-82.  In short, each of the\r\nfederal cases cited by SOS Alliance that found the existence of standing where the alleged harm\r\nwas to environmental, scientific, or recreational interests involved a federal statute protecting those\r\nsame interests.<sup> (6)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tBased on this state and federal case law, we must address whether SOS Alliance\r\nhas established standing under Texas law to pursue its claims under the Uniform Declaratory\r\nJudgments Act (UDJA).  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§ 37.001-.011 (West 2008). \r\nUnder the UDJA, SOS Alliance must establish standing by alleging an injury in fact to a \"legally\r\nprotected interest which is . . . concrete and particularized.\"  <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U.S. at 560;\r\n<em>see Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v.

(\"A declaratory judgment declares the rights\r\nand duties or the status of parties in a justiciable controversy.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tThere is no Texas authority for the proposition that the type of injury alleged by\r\nSOS Alliance in this case--injury to its members' environmental, scientific, and recreational\r\ninterests generally and without any interest in or connection to the real property involved--is the\r\ntype of interference with a legally protected interest or injury that confers standing as a matter of\r\nstate law.  SOS Alliance must show a particularized, legally protected interest that is actually\r\nor imminently affected by the alleged harm.  <em>See Defenders of Wildlife</em>, 504 U.S. at 560-61.  SOS\r\nAlliance has alleged neither an environmental interest provided for or protected by statute (as is\r\npresent in the federal cases cited by SOS Alliance) nor a property interest subject to the recreational\r\nor environmental harm (as is present in the state cases cited by SOS Alliance).  Absent such\r\nallegations, there is no particularized, legally protected interest at stake in this context, as there\r\nis nothing to distinguish the environmental, scientific, or recreational concerns of SOS Alliance's\r\nmembers from the same concerns experienced by the public in general.  <em>See id.</em> at 560; <em>Nobles\r\nv. Marcus</em>, 533 S.W.2d 923, 927 (Tex. 1976).  Based on the existing state and federal case law, to\r\nfind standing under the circumstances here would, we think, be to expand Texas's standing\r\njurisprudence, and it is not our proper role as an intermediate appellate court to do so.  <em>See Petco\r\nAnimal Supplies, Inc. v. Schuster</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2119954\"><a href=\"/opinion/2119954/petco-animal-supplies-inc-v-schuster/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 565 (Tex. App.--Austin 2004, no pet.). \r\nTherefore, we decline to conclude that the environmental, scientific, and recreational interests\r\nasserted by SOS Alliance result in a \"concrete and particularized\" injury in fact, as is necessary to\r\nestablish standing under Texas law.<sup> (7)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t<em>Injury to Landowners' Well Water</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also bases its assertion of standing on its members' concern about\r\npollution to their residential water use.  SOS Alliance relies on the affidavits of two members who\r\nuse well water for residential use.  One member alleges that he lives \"about one-quarter mile\" west\r\nof the Cypress Hays land and is \"concerned\" about \"pollution from Cypress' proposed golf courses\r\nand other development,\" and the other member alleges that she lives \"within the extraterritorial\r\njurisdiction of the City of Dripping Springs,\" owns an undeveloped residential lot \"within 200 feet\"\r\nof the Cypress Hays development, and is \"concerned\" about \"how pollution from a large\r\ndevelopment in the recharge zone of the Aquifer would [a]ffect the quality of the Aquifer water.\" \r\nWe need not determine whether the members' \"concern\" about pollution to well water on their\r\nproperty is a sufficiently particularized injury in fact for purposes of standing, because we conclude\r\nthat SOS Alliance has failed to demonstrate that the alleged harm is actual or imminent, rather than\r\nhypothetical or conjectural.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo have standing, SOS Alliance must allege an injury that is \"actual or imminent,\r\nnot hypothetical.\"  <em>See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Inman</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1384486\"><a href=\"/opinion/1384486/daimlerchrysler-corp-v-inman/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 304-05 (Tex. 2008).  The\r\ntwo members concerned about pollution to their water supply do not allege any connection between\r\nthe Development Agreements and their well water.  Neither member makes any reference to the\r\nproperty subject to the Mak Foster Development Agreement, and the only reference to the\r\nCypress Hays Development Agreement property is one of proximity.  According to SOS Alliance's\r\nexperts' affidavits, the Mak Foster development is located in the contributing zone, the Rutherford\r\nRanch development is located within the \"uniquely sensitive\" recharge zone, and both will\r\n\"contribute to the pollution load within wells in the Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer.\"  It is not\r\nenough, however, to allege that the Development Agreements will pollute <em>some</em> well water in\r\nthe area and that an SOS Alliance member uses well water in the area.  The potential harm to the\r\nmembers' well water must be more than speculative.  There must be some allegation or evidence\r\nthat would tend to show that the well water of the members in question will be affected by the action\r\nof which they complain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAccording to SOS Alliance's experts' affidavits, rainfall on the contributing zone\r\nflows east to the recharge zone, where it enters the underground aquifer, and then flows north\r\nand mostly resurfaces at the Barton Springs pool.  The experts further aver that pollutants from the\r\ndevelopments would be added to this run-off into the aquifer, and that there is already evidence\r\nof increased pollutants at the Barton Springs pool.  Given the specific description contained in\r\nSOS Alliance's jurisdictional evidence of the flow direction toward and within the aquifer, there\r\nmust be evidence in the record to show that the properties of the members who express concern\r\nabout pollution to their water supply are in a location that is at least potentially \"downflow\" from\r\nthe developments.  SOS Alliance did not present any allegations or evidence on this point.<sup> (8)</sup>  The fact\r\nthat the Mak Foster property is somewhere in the contributing zone and an SOS member's well\r\nis somewhere in the recharge zone is not, by itself, sufficient to show harm that is imminent and\r\nnot merely conjectural or speculative.  SOS Alliance has failed to allege or provide evidence of any\r\nactual or imminent impact from the approvals of the Development Agreements on the amount of\r\npollution to SOS Alliance's members' residential water supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<em>Procedural Injury</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance next points to its claims in its pleadings that the Development\r\nAgreements violate the Texas Constitution in that they impinge on the right of local self-government\r\n(citing Tex. Const. art. I, § 1), impair the preservation of a republican form of government (citing\r\nTex. Const. art. I, § 2), and contract away legislative and police powers (citing Tex. Const. art. I,\r\n§ 17).  According to SOS Alliance, some of its members reside within the city limits of\r\nDripping Springs or its extraterritorial jurisdiction and are opposed to the developments, and their\r\nability to act on their opposition has been eliminated as a result of the Development Agreements'\r\n\"immediate and certain effect of closing off the democratic process and democratic controls over the\r\ndevelopment of that tract of property for at least 15 years.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo establish standing to assert these alleged constitutional violations, SOS Alliance\r\nmust show an injury in fact.  <em>See Neeley v. West Orange-Cove Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894693\"><a href=\"/opinion/894693/neeley-v-west-orange-cove/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>, 774 (Tex. 2005) (\"Standing to assert a constitutional violation depends on whether the claimant\r\nasserts a particularized, concrete injury.\").  While SOS Alliance contends that the Development\r\nAgreements \"adversely and immediately impinge\" on its members' constitutional rights, the only\r\ninjury identified by SOS Alliance is \"procedural injury\" suffered by those members who reside\r\nwithin the city limits of Dripping Springs or its extraterritorial jurisdiction.  SOS Alliance relies on\r\ntwo federal cases for the proposition that injury to its members' procedural interests can be an injury\r\nin fact sufficient to show standing--<em>Sierra Club v. Marita</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687640\"><a href=\"/opinion/687640/sierra-club-wisconsin-forest-conservation-task-force-and-wisconsin-audubon/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span> (7th Cir. 1995), and <em>Natural\r\nResources Defense Council v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span> (D.D.C. 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn <em>Marita</em>, the Seventh Circuit considered a \"forest management plan\" created by\r\nthe defendant, a plan with which subsequent natural resource management activities in the covered\r\narea had to comply.  <em>See</em> 46 F.3d at 610-11.  The court concluded that, for purposes of standing,\r\nthere was actual or imminent injury underlying the alleged procedural default even if the plan was\r\nnot implemented immediately.  <em>See id.</em> at 612.  The court was able to reach this conclusion because,\r\nas the Supreme Court has recognized, a plaintiff in federal court does not need to meet the normal\r\nstanding requirement of imminence when he seeks to assert a procedural right.  <em>See Defenders of\r\nWildlife</em>, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7.  However, for this to apply, the plaintiff must first be accorded the\r\nprocedural right.  <em>See id.</em>  The National Environmental Policy Act, which the court in <em>Marita</em> was\r\nconstruing, <em>see </em>46 F.3d at 612-13, is \"essentially a procedural statute,\" such that \"injury alleged\r\nto have occurred as a result of violating this procedural right confers standing.\"  <em>Idaho Conservation\r\nLeague v. Mumma</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578191\"><a href=\"/opinion/578191/idaho-conservation-league-idaho-wildlife-federation-idaho-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1508</span></a></span>, 1514 (9th Cir. 1992).  Thus, the court in <em>Marita</em>, in concluding\r\nthat the plaintiff had standing based on its procedural interests, was construing a statute that\r\nspecifically provided for the procedural rights at issue, the violation of which could confer standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tLikewise, in <em>Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, the court's conclusion that\r\nthe plaintiffs had standing based on procedural injury was in the context of a statute that accorded\r\nthe plaintiffs specific procedural rights.  223 F. Supp. 2d at 178-79.  In that case, the plaintiffs\r\nalleged violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.  <em>See id.</em> at 167.  According to the court,\r\nthis federal law established procedural requirements, the requirements were \"designed to protect\r\nsome threatened concrete interest\" of the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged harm from\r\nthe defendant's failure to comply with those procedural requirements.  <em>Id.</em> at 178-80.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tUnlike in <em>Marita</em> and <em>Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, SOS Alliance does not\r\nsue based on a statute that accords SOS Alliance or its members specified procedural rights. \r\nSOS Alliance does not provide any argument or authority for the proposition that the constitutional\r\nprovisions, under which SOS Alliance asserts its claims, provide procedural protections akin to the\r\nfederal statutes at issue in the two federal cases cited, or that any such procedural protections exist\r\nin the absence of a statute that would accrue to the benefit of SOS Alliance or its members. \r\nTherefore, we decline to hold that SOS Alliance has standing based on harm to its members' non-specified procedural interests.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i); <em>Valadez v.

(\"Failure to cite legal authority or provide substantive analysis\r\nof the legal issue presented results in waiver of the complaint.\").</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<em>Taxpayer Standing</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tNext, SOS Alliance asserts standing based on the taxpayer status of its members. \r\nTaxpayer standing is an exception to the general rule that the plaintiff must show a particularized\r\ninjury distinct from that suffered by the public.  <em>See Bland Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 34 S.W.3d at 555-56;\r\n<em>Hendee v. Dewhurst</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2357141\"><a href=\"/opinion/2357141/hendee-v-dewhurst/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 373-74 (Tex. App.--Austin 2007, pet. denied).  A plaintiff\r\nrelying on taxpayer standing can seek to enjoin prospective expenditures of public funds, but cannot\r\nrecover funds already expended.  <em>Williams v. Huff</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743723/williams-v-lara/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 180 (Tex. 2001).  To establish\r\ntaxpayer standing, the plaintiff must show that (1) he is a taxpayer, and (2) public funds are to be\r\nexpended on the allegedly illegal activity.  <em>Id.</em> at 179.  SOS Alliance alleges that it has at least one\r\nmember who resides within the City of Dripping Springs and who pays property taxes on her\r\nhomestead.  SOS Alliance further alleges that the Development Agreements obligate the City to\r\nspend money on attorneys' fees defending the Development Agreements from challenges such as\r\nthis lawsuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo show that the City will expend public funds on attorneys' fees, SOS Alliance\r\nrefers to the Development Agreements' provision that in the event of a third-party lawsuit relating to\r\na Development Agreement, the City and the developer \"agree to cooperate in the defense of such suit\r\nor claim, and to use their respective best efforts to resolve the suit or claim.\"  This provision, by its\r\nplain terms, does not require the expenditure of public funds.  It does not address expenditures at all. \r\nRather, a separate provision of the Development Agreements addresses expenditures.  That provision\r\nrequires the developer to pay the City a deposit \"intended to cover all City legal . . . fees and\r\nadministrative expenses\" associated with the Agreement.  In the event fees and expenses incurred\r\nexceed the initial deposit, the developer is obligated to \"pay the additional fees and expenses upon\r\nthe City's request.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe decline to grant taxpayer standing based on expenses that taxpayers will never\r\nbear, given the developers' obligation to reimburse the City.  SOS Alliance has not shown that\r\nany public funds have been or will be expended by the City as a result of the allegedly illegal\r\nDevelopment Agreements.  Therefore, SOS Alliance has failed to establish taxpayer standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t<em>Landowners' Non-Water-Related Concerns</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also points to its members' concerns about injuries that are distinct\r\nfrom increased pollution to the water entering the aquifer, specifically:  (1) increased traffic\r\ncongestion caused by the new residents of the developments, which in turn might increase traffic\r\nsafety hazards, (2) increased light interfering with appreciation of nighttime skies, and (3) decreased\r\nproperty value due to the prospect of nearby high-density development.  SOS Alliance asserts that\r\nit has standing because of these concerns of its members who live near the developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tEven assuming these members may have standing to sue in their own right, to have\r\nassociational standing SOS Alliance must show that the interests it seeks to protect are germane\r\nto the organization's purpose (the second prong of associational standing).  <em>See Texas Ass'n of Bus.</em>,\r\n852 S.W.2d at 447.  We note that, in this lawsuit, SOS Alliance seeks to protect its members'\r\nenvironmental interests, which <em>are</em> germane to its purpose.  However, to have associational standing,\r\nwe conclude that the interest that is \"germane to the organization's purpose\"--thereby satisfying the\r\nsecond prong--must also relate to the interest by which its members would \"have standing to sue\r\nin their own right\"--thereby satisfying the first prong.  <em>See Hays County v. Hays County Water\r\nPlanning P'Ship</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1635752\"><a href=\"/opinion/1635752/hays-county-v-hays-cty-water-plan-partn/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 357 (Tex. App.--Austin 2003, no pet.) (association was created\r\nto address \"these kinds of community issues\" by which its members showed standing to sue on their\r\nown behalf).  We do not think the associational standing factors are intended to permit an association\r\nthat has an interest against a challenged activity to obtain standing by adding a member who has\r\nindividual standing to sue based on his own unrelated interest against the same activity.  Therefore,\r\nSOS Alliance cannot satisfy the second prong of associational standing based on its members'\r\nenvironmental concerns, while satisfying the first prong solely based on certain members' unrelated\r\nconcerns regarding their property values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo establish standing based on its members' non-water-related concerns, then,\r\nSOS Alliance must show that <em>those</em> interests are germane to its purpose.  According to its petition,\r\nSOS Alliance is \"formed for the purpose of protecting the Edwards Aquifer with particular emphasis\r\non preventing further pollution of Barton Springs and reversing the water quality degradation of\r\nBarton Springs that has already occurred.\"  We are unpersuaded that increased time and danger for\r\nautomobile travel, impaired viewing of the night sky, and decreased property value for landowners\r\nin the Barton Springs contributing and recharge zones is \"germane to\" SOS Alliance's purpose of\r\nreducing water pollution in Barton Springs.  We recognize that SOS Alliance's mission to protect\r\nthe water that feeds Barton Springs would generally result in opposition to developments in\r\nthe contributing and recharge zones.  According to the affidavit of SOS Alliance's communications\r\ndirector, \"[a] significant amount of the activities of SOS Alliance are devoted to preventing or\r\nstopping governments from granting special favors to landowners and developers that facilitate\r\ndestructive development in the recharge and contributing zones.\"  It is equally apparent that a\r\nsuccessful opposition to development can, in turn, benefit such interests as low traffic and low\r\nlight levels for residents in the area.  However, the fact that SOS Alliance's mission would\r\nbenefit a member's interest does not mean that particular interest is included in--or germane\r\nto--SOS Alliance's purpose.<sup> (9)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance refers to two federal cases in which members of an environmental\r\norganization had standing based on diminished property value resulting from the defendant's\r\nconduct.  <em>See Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.</em>, 528 U.S. at 182-83; <em>Gaston Copper Recycling</em>, 204 F.3d at 156. \r\nAlthough neither case addresses the second prong of associational standing, we note that in both\r\ncases, the alleged decrease in property value was attributable to pollution by the defendant.  <em>See\r\nLaidlaw Envtl. Servs.</em>, 528 U.S. at 182-83 (member \"believed the pollutant discharges accounted for\r\nsome of the discrepancy\" in home value); <em>Gaston Copper Recycling</em>, 204 F.3d at 156 (member\r\nclaimed \"the pollution or threat of pollution has diminished the value of his property\").  Therefore,\r\nin those cases, the interest of the members who had standing individually (combating the pollution\r\nthat was lowering their property values) was germane to the purpose of the organization (combating\r\npollution in general).  Unlike in those cases, the SOS Alliance member who alleged a decrease in\r\nproperty value attributed the decrease solely to the fact that it was a \"high-density development.\" \r\nSOS Alliance's members' concerns that neighboring high-density developments will cause artificial\r\nlight sources to increase, road traffic to increase, and property values to decrease are not germane\r\nto SOS Alliance's mission to protect the Edwards Aquifer water.  Therefore, SOS Alliance has not\r\nmet the second prong of associational standing by alleging its members' concerns as landowners not\r\nrelated to Edwards Aquifer water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe affirm the district court's granting of appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction as to\r\nSOS Alliance's claims that are not related to the Open Meetings Act.<sup> (10)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Sufficiency of City's Public Notices</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn its third point on appeal, SOS Alliance contends that the district court erred in\r\ngranting summary judgment to appellees on SOS Alliance's cause of action under the Texas Open\r\nMeetings Act (the \"Act\").  In its petition, SOS Alliance alleged that the City's public notices\r\nregarding the Development Agreements failed to comply with the Act's requirement that the subject\r\nof a meeting be sufficiently set forth.  Section 551.041 of the Act requires that a governmental body\r\n\"give written notice of the date, hour, place, and <em>subject</em> of each meeting held by the governmental\r\nbody.\"  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.041 (West 2004) (emphasis added).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tWe review summary judgments de novo.  <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v.

App.--Austin 2002, pet. denied).  In that case, this\r\nCourt concluded that the following notice sufficiently described the applicable subject matter of\r\nthe meeting:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Water Purchase Contract among GBRA, CRWA, City of Cibolo, City of Marion,\r\nCity of Schertz, ECWSC, GVSUD, SHWSC, &amp; BMWD; Outline of Preliminary\r\nAgreement concerning joint participation in a treated water supply for portions of\r\nComal, Kendall, &amp; Bexar Counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>96 S.W.3d at 530.  The plaintiff complained that the notice was insufficient to inform the public\r\nthat the river authority would seek to double the amount of water to which it was entitled on an\r\nannual basis, sell a portion of the water outside its ten-county area, and require the construction of\r\n$75 million in improvements.  <em>See id.</em>  This Court recognized that the notice \"might not inform the\r\ncasual reader of the precise consequences\" of the agreements at issue, but held nonetheless that\r\nthe notice was sufficiently descriptive to satisfy the Act.  <em>See id.</em> at 531 (citing <em>Texas Turnpike Auth.</em>,\r\n554 S.W.2d at 676).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn this case, like the notice at issue in <em>Friends of Canyon Lake</em>, the City's\r\nnotices identified the applicable parties to the agreements and stated the type of agreement\r\nat issue--a development agreement.  Moreover, just as the notice in <em>Friends of Canyon Lake</em> set\r\nout the counties affected without specifying the precise area, the notices here referenced\r\nsection 42.044 of the local government code, which governs the creation of \"industrial districts\"\r\nwithin a municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction.  <em>See</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. § 42.044(b)\r\n(West 2008).  Section 42.044 also provides that the municipality's contract with a landowner in\r\nthe industrial district can guarantee the district's immunity from annexation by the municipality\r\n\"for a period not to exceed 15 years.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 42.044(c)(1).  Therefore, a reader of the notices would\r\nbe informed that the subject of the meetings would include the potential approval of agreements\r\nwith Mak Foster and Cypress Hays that involved development, on property in the City's\r\nextraterritorial jurisdiction, and potentially with restrictions lasting up to 15 years.  The City was not\r\nobligated to state all the consequences that would flow from these Development Agreements.  <em>See</em>\r\n<em>Texas Turnpike Auth.</em>, 554 S.W.2d at 676.  Indeed, had the notices listed all the consequences that\r\nwould follow from the Development Agreements, including the variances to be provided and\r\nthe other issues highlighted by SOS Alliance, the result may have been to overwhelm, rather\r\nthan inform, the reader.  <em>See City of San Antonio v. Fourth Court of Appeals</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1522067\"><a href=\"/opinion/1522067/city-of-san-antonio-v-fourth-court-of-appeals/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span>, 766\r\n(Tex. 1991) (\"Far from serving the purposes of the Act, this degree of specificity would so\r\noverwhelm readers that it would prove even less informative than the current notice.\"); <em>see also\r\nTexas Turnpike Auth.</em>, 554 S.W.2d at 676 (not necessary to \"post copies of proposed resolutions\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance argues that the notices' omission of the location or size of the property\r\nsubject to the proposed Development Agreements is at variance from the City's standard notice\r\npractice.  SOS Alliance relies on <em>River Road Neighborhood Ass'n v. South Texas Sports</em>, which\r\nfound a notice insufficient under the Act based on \"the well established custom and practice\" of\r\nthe governmental body.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1526110\"><a href=\"/opinion/1526110/river-road-neighborhood-v-south-texas-sports/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 557 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1986, writ dism'd w.o.j.). \r\nIn that case, four public meetings had involved a similar subject matter, with the notices identifying\r\nthe purpose as \"discussion/action.\"  Because the notice for the fifth meeting stated only \"discussion,\"\r\nthe court held that the public was not properly alerted to the possibility that action would be taken. \r\n<em>See id.</em>  Here, however, SOS Alliance does not identify a \"well established custom and practice\"\r\napplicable to development agreements.  Instead, SOS Alliance refers to notice postings that involved\r\nzoning decisions.  The Development Agreements do not involve zoning.  <em>Cf.</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 212.003(a) (West 2008) (restricting municipality's ability to regulate in its extraterritorial\r\njurisdiction).  With no other public notice posting related to development agreements with the City\r\nin the record, SOS Alliance has not shown any well-established custom and practice that would be\r\nrelevant to the notices' sufficiency.<sup> (12)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tSOS Alliance also argues that a more detailed description of the subject matter was\r\nrequired because of the \"high level of public interest in these developments.\"  To show a heightened\r\npublic interest, SOS Alliance relies on affidavits of residents in the extraterritorial jurisdiction\r\nwho assert that they were among many citizens who attended subsequent city council meetings\r\nto raise their concerns regarding the Development Agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tEven assuming SOS Alliance has demonstrated a heightened public interest, we\r\nare not convinced that the notices' description of subject matter should be deemed insufficient as a\r\nresult.  In <em>Cox Enterprises</em>, the Texas Supreme Court held that, taking into account an increased level\r\nof public interest, the bare description \"personnel\" was insufficient to describe the selection of a\r\nnew school superintendent and the description \"litigation\" was insufficient to describe \"a major\r\ndesegregation lawsuit which has occupied the Board's time for a number of years, and whose\r\neffect will be felt for years to come.\"  706 S.W.2d at 959.  The City's notices in this case are much\r\nmore detailed than those in <em>Cox Enterprises</em>.  The City's notices state the parties involved, the\r\ntype of agreement at issue, that the extraterritorial jurisdiction would be impacted (based on the\r\nstatute included in the notice), and that the agreements might be approved as a result of the meeting. \r\nA reader interested in development in the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction would have had\r\nsufficient notice that the City was considering action relevant thereto.  <em>See Fourth Court of Appeals</em>,\r\n820 S.W.2d at 766; <em>Rettberg v. Texas Dep't of Health</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433100\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433100/rettberg-v-texas-dept-of-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 411 (Tex. App.--Austin\r\n1994, no writ) (\"notice is sufficient under the Act when it alerts a reader that some action will be\r\ntaken relative to a topic\").</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tHaving concluded that the notices were sufficiently descriptive so as to state the\r\nsubjects of the meetings in accordance with section 551.041 of the Open Meetings Act, we overrule\r\nSOS Alliance's third point on appeal.<sup> (13)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Attorneys' Fees</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tIn its remaining points on appeal, SOS Alliance asserts that, even if we affirm the\r\ntrial court's granting of appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction and motions for summary judgment,\r\nthe district court erred in awarding attorneys' fees to Mak Foster.<sup> (14)</sup>  In a proceeding under the\r\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act, a court may award \"reasonable and necessary attorney's fees\r\nas are equitable and just.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009.  A trial court's award of\r\nattorneys' fees under the UDJA is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  <em>See Bocquet v. Herring</em>,\r\n972 S.W.2d 19, 20-21 (Tex. 1998).  A trial court abuses its discretion by awarding fees when there\r\nis insufficient evidence that the fees were reasonable and necessary, or when the award is inequitable\r\nor unjust.  <em>Id.</em> at 21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tAs an initial matter, SOS Alliance argues that Mak Foster failed to segregate between\r\nits defense of claims for which recovery of attorneys' fees was proper and those for which\r\nsuch recovery was not proper.  <em>See West Beach Marina, Ltd. v. Erdeljac</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774060\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774060/west-beach-marina-ltd-v-erdeljac/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 267\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 2002, no pet.).  However, SOS Alliance fails to provide a reason for which any\r\nof its particular claims independently would not provide a valid basis for Mak Foster's recovery of\r\nattorneys' fees.  Regarding its Open Meetings Act claim, SOS Alliance refers to section 551.142 of\r\nthe Act, which permits a court to award the defendant reasonable attorneys' fees in an action by\r\nmandamus or injunction regarding a potential violation of the Act, provided that the court consider\r\nwhether the action was brought in good faith.  <em>See</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.142 (West 2004). \r\nAccording to its petition, however, SOS Alliance brought its Open Meetings Act claim as an action\r\nunder the UDJA, not as an action by mandamus or injunction under section 551.142.  <em>See</em> Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.004(a).  Regarding its other claims, SOS Alliance questions whether\r\nthe district court had jurisdiction to award attorneys' fees that were incurred in connection with\r\nclaims over which the court determined it had no subject-matter jurisdiction.  The district court did\r\nhave this authority.<sup> (15)</sup>  <em>See id.</em> § 37.009 (court may award attorneys' fees in <em>any</em> proceeding under the\r\nUDJA); <em>Galveston County Comm'rs' Court v.

There is no duty to segregate, however, when the causes of action are dependent\r\nupon the same set of facts or circumstances and are intertwined to the point of being inseparable. \r\n<em>Stewart Title Guar.

Mak Foster relies on\r\nSOS Alliance's motion to consolidate to show that the claims asserted by the co-plaintiffs were\r\nintertwined,<sup> (16)</sup> but that motion is not in the appellate record.  Similarly, Friendship Alliance's petition\r\nis not in the record for our review.  We are limited to the appellate record provided.  <em>See</em> Tex.

(\"Materials outside the record . . . that are improperly included in or attached to a\r\nparty's brief . . . may not be considered by an appellate court in its review of the appeal on its\r\nmerits.\").  However, our review of what the record does contain gives us no reason to conclude\r\nthat Friendship Alliance's lawsuit did not involve the same set of facts and circumstances.  <em>See\r\nEnterprise Leasing Co. v. Barrios</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894617\"><a href=\"/opinion/894617/enterprise-leasing-co-of-houston-v-barrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 550 (Tex. 2004) (\"If the pertinent\r\nsummary judgment evidence considered by the trial court is not included in the appellate record, an\r\nappellate court must presume that the omitted evidence supports the trial court's judgment.\").  We\r\nconclude that Mak Foster had no duty to segregate the fees owed by the co-plaintiffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tNext, SOS Alliance asserts that the evidence is insufficient to support an award\r\nof attorneys' fees in the amount requested by Mak Foster.  As a general rule, the party seeking\r\nto recover attorneys' fees carries the burden of proof.  <em>Stewart Title Guar. Co.</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 10. \r\nWhether an award of attorneys' fees is reasonable and necessary is a fact question.  <em>Bocquet</em>,\r\n972 S.W.2d at 21.  SOS Alliance contends that Mak Foster's evidence of attorneys' fees \"consists\r\nentirely of the conclusory, self-serving, affidavit[] of lead counsel[].\"  However, contrary to\r\nSOS Alliance's contention, that affidavit sets out the attorneys who performed the work, the number\r\nof hours billed by each, their hourly rates, and a description of the tasks for which legal services were\r\nperformed.  The affiant stated his qualifications and experience, and averred that:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>I am familiar with usual and customary rates charged by attorneys in the area for\r\ncases with comparable complexity and amounts in controversy, and the fees\r\ndescribed above are those customarily charged in this area for the same or similar\r\nservices by those with similar experience, reputation, and ability, considering the type\r\nof controversy, the time limitations imposed, the work involved, the results obtained\r\nand length of the firm's relationship with Mak Foster.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>SOS Alliance suggests that only fee bills with unredacted entries would be sufficient evidence of\r\nattorneys' fee amounts, but does not base its position on any legal authority.  We conclude that the\r\nevidence was sufficient to show Mak Foster's attorneys' fees were reasonable and necessary.  <em>See\r\nTexas Commerce Bank v.

An award can be inequitable or unjust even\r\nwhen the fees are reasonable and necessary.  <em>See id.</em>  However, when reviewing matters committed\r\nto the trial court's discretion, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\r\ntrial judge, and a trial court does not abuse its discretion merely because it decides a discretionary\r\nmatter differently than the appellate court would under similar circumstances.  <em>Baylor Univ.

The test for an abuse\r\nof discretion is whether the court acted without reference to guiding rules and principles.  <em>See Cire\r\nv. Cummings</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894518\"><a href=\"/opinion/894518/cire-v-cummings/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span>, 838-39 (Tex. 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\tTo show that the attorneys' fees award was not just and equitable, SOS Alliance\r\nrelies on its being a \"nonprofit organization dedicated to the public good\" and the \"significance\r\nof the matters at stake in this lawsuit and that SOS Alliance was at least somewhat successfully\r\naddressed.\"  We do not consider this, standing alone, to make the award of attorneys' fees to\r\nMak Foster inequitable or unjust.  It may very well have been equitable and just for the district court\r\n<em>not</em> to have awarded fees or to award some other amount, but that does not make this award\r\ninequitable or unjust.  <em>See Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v.

Given that SOS Alliance's interests against the Development Agreements spring from\r\nenvironmental concerns, we note that the Agreements contain several environmental-protection\r\nprovisions, requiring the developers to (1) comply with applicable state rules \"designed to protect\r\nthe quality of the Edwards Aquifer,\" (2) obtain and comply with any required \"no-discharge\" permits\r\nregarding treated sewage effluent, (3) comply with any U.S. Army Corps of Engineers authorizations\r\nunder section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, (4) prepare and implement a \"stormwater pollution\r\nprevention plan,\" (5) ensure no adverse effect on listed endangered species or their critical habitat\r\nin accordance with the federal Endangered Species Act, and (6) implement certain voluntary\r\nenvironmental protection measures, including an integrated pest management program at any golf\r\ncourse, education of property owners, and buffering of sensitive drainage areas.\r\n</p><p>2.   During the same time period, another organization, Friendship Alliance, filed suit\r\nagainst the City challenging the legality of the Development Agreements.  The two lawsuits were\r\nconsolidated in early 2003.  Friendship Alliance settled its lawsuit in 2004 after certain amendments\r\nto the Agreements had been negotiated.\r\n</p><p>3.   SOS Alliance has dismissed its claims against Cypress-Hays, which is no longer a party\r\nto this case.  <em>See Save Our Springs Alliance v.

SOS Alliance asserts that section 26.177 of the Texas Water Code \"articulates standing\r\nrights at least as broad as the standing granted under the federal Clean Water Act.\"  Section 26.177\r\nauthorizes \"[a]ny person affected by any ruling, order, decision, ordinance, program, resolution, or\r\nother act of a city relating to water pollution control and abatement outside the corporate limits of\r\nsuch city\" adopted pursuant to statute to appeal such action to district court.  Tex. Water Code Ann.\r\n§ 26.177(d) (West 2008).  However, such a lawsuit must be filed within 60 days of the challenged\r\nact of the city.  <em>See id.</em>  Regardless of whether section 26.177 could apply to SOS Alliance and would\r\nprovide standing as broad as the CWA, SOS Alliance does not allege that it satisfied the 60-day\r\nrequirement.  The Development Agreements were approved in April 2001.  This lawsuit was filed\r\nin November 2002.  SOS Alliance has not asserted any claims under section 26.177, nor could it\r\nhave.  Moreover, SOS Alliance does not allege any other statute on which its standing to assert its\r\nclaims not related to the Open Meetings Act might be based.\r\n</p><p>6.   We note that this Court's holding in <em>Texas Rivers</em> that harm for purposes of\r\nstanding may be \"economic, recreational, or environmental\" appears to be connected to federal case\r\nlaw in which a federal statute protected such interests.  The Texas case from which the \"economic,\r\nrecreational, or environmental\" language originates is <em>Housing Authority of Harlingen v. State</em> in its\r\ngeneral statement of the test for standing.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1730349\"><a href=\"/opinion/1730349/hous-authority-etc-v-state-ex-rel-velasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span>, 913-14 (Tex. Civ. App.--Corpus Christi\r\n1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  As authority for the language, the court in <em>Housing Authority of Harlingen</em>\r\ncited several United States Supreme Court opinions, and appears to have taken its description of the\r\nscope of an injury in fact from <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108088\"><a href=\"/opinion/108088/association-of-data-processing-service-organizations-inc-v-camp/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span> (1970).  In that case, the Supreme Court observed that the legal interest required for\r\npurposes of standing \"may reflect 'aesthetic, conservational, and recreational' as well as economic\r\nvalues,\" provided that \"the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the\r\nzone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\" \r\n397 U.S. at 153-54.\r\n</p><p>7.   SOS Alliance contends that this conclusion ignores SOS Alliance's \"long and proud\r\nhistory\" of obtaining standing to challenge government actions.  SOS Alliance relies on <em>Save Our\r\nSprings Alliance, Inc. v. Lowry</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1657647\"><a href=\"/opinion/1657647/save-our-springs-alliance-inc-v-lowry/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span> (Tex. App.--Austin 1996, orig. proceeding),\r\nas indicative of such standing.  However, that case involved standing based on a statute--the\r\nTexas Open Meetings Act.  <em>See </em>934 S.W.2d at 162.  That Act authorizes an \"interested person\" to\r\nfile suit.  <em>See</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 551.142(a) (West 2004).  According to <em>Lowry</em>, this statutory\r\nprovision dispenses with the standing requirement of an injury distinct from that of the general\r\npublic.  <em>Lowry</em>, 934 S.W.2d at 163.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tSimilarly, the San Marcos River Foundation (SMRF) filed a letter brief as amicus curiae,\r\nexpressing its concern that a determination in this case that SOS Alliance does not have standing\r\nbased on environmental harm would impair SMRF's future ability to litigate.  We note that in\r\n<em>City of San Marcos v. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality</em>--by which, SMRF asserts,\r\nit was successful in protecting the San Marcos River--a statute specifically authorized\r\njudicial review.  128 S.W.3d 264, 266 (Tex. App.--Austin 2004, pet. denied) (citing Tex. Water\r\nCode Ann. § 5.351 (West 2008)).  Thus, our adjudication of SOS Alliance's standing in the absence\r\nof such statutory provision will not likely affect SMRF's future ability to again file suit under\r\nthe same statute.\r\n</p><p>8.   SOS Alliance argues that it should not be required to \"hire experts to map and\r\ncalculate local hydrogeological flows to engage in debates about gradients of flows\" at this stage. \r\nWhether or not this is the case, SOS Alliance must at least provide evidence that a member \"used\r\nan area subject to contamination from the discharge.\" <em> American Canoe Ass'n</em>, 326 F.3d at 520.  In\r\nthe cases SOS Alliance cites on this issue, unlike here, there was evidence from which the court\r\ncould find that the consequences of the challenged action of the defendant would in fact extend to\r\nthe plaintiff.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> (members' use of river was downstream from polluting defendant); <em>Barshop\r\nv.

In fact, it appears more feasible that many of these members' interests as landowners might\r\neven be <em>contrary</em> to SOS Alliance's purpose.  SOS Alliance would likely welcome declining property\r\nvalues if they would enable SOS Alliance to place more watershed land into long-term conservation\r\neasements, and would likely welcome inconveniences such as increased traffic and light if the result\r\nwas surrounding areas becoming less desirable for home buyers and future real estate developers. \r\nMoreover, in the event that Mak Foster and Cypress Hays successfully develop their properties in\r\naccordance with the Development Agreements, we question whether SOS Alliance would\r\nsubsequently seek to protect those developments' interests in increasing property values as well.\r\n</p><p>10.   In its second point on appeal, SOS Alliance contends that the district court erred in\r\ngranting appellees' pleas to the jurisdiction based on the case not being ripe for adjudication as to\r\nany land that had not become subject to a finally approved plat, and based on the case being moot\r\nas to land that was subject to a finally approved plat that SOS Alliance neither appealed nor\r\nchallenged.  Given that we have determined that the court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction\r\nbased on standing, we need not consider the issues of ripeness or mootness.\r\n</p><p>11.   SOS Alliance alleges that the Cypress-Hays Development Agreement contains more than\r\n32 variances, including reduction of minimum lot size, reduction of minimum setbacks, and\r\nreduction of plat review and approval time.\r\n</p><p>12.   In fact, given that the Development Agreements were apparently without precedent as to\r\nthe City (SOS Alliance itself describes the developments as \"unprecedented in size and density for\r\nDripping Springs\"), it appears that the City actually followed its usual custom and practice.  The\r\nsecond notice--for the Mak Foster Development Agreement--was essentially identical to the first\r\nnotice--for the Cypress Hays Development Agreement.\r\n</p><p>13.   Appellees argue that any potential violations of the Act were validated by the legislature\r\nin 2003.  <em>See</em> Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. § 212.172(h) (West 2008) (\"An agreement between a\r\nmunicipality and a landowner entered into prior to the effective date of this section and that complies\r\nwith this section is validated.\").  Because we conclude that SOS Alliance has not shown a violation\r\nof the Act, we need not address this argument.\r\n</p><p>14.   Due to a partial settlement between SOS Alliance and the City, SOS Alliance does not\r\nseek appellate review of the attorneys' fees awarded to the City.\r\n</p><p>15.   Neither of the cases cited by SOS Alliance suggests otherwise.  In <em>Gregg County\r\nAppraisal District v. Laidlaw Waste Systems, Inc.</em>, the statute at issue allowed attorneys' fees for a\r\nproperty owner who prevailed in his tax appeal.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742524\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742524/gregg-cty-appraisal-v-laidlaw-waste/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 21 (Tex. App.--Tyler 1995,\r\nwrit denied).  To the extent the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the owner's claims, he did\r\nnot \"prevail\" and, therefore, by statute was not entitled to attorneys' fees.  <em>Id.</em>  In <em>Lipshy Motorcars,\r\nInc. v. Sovereign Associates, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2440985\"><a href=\"/opinion/2440985/lipshy-motorcars-inc-v-sovereign/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span> (Tex. App.--Dallas 1997, no writ), an <em>appellate</em>\r\ncourt determined it had no jurisdiction to consider a motion for sanctions and attorneys' fees against\r\nan appellant who attempted to appeal a non-appealable interlocutory order.  944 S.W.2d at 70-72.\r\n</p><p>16.   According to Mak Foster, SOS Alliance represented in its motion to consolidate that the\r\nplaintiffs' lawsuits were \"based on identical facts and circumstances,\" asked for \"identical\r\ndeclaratory and nearly identical injunctive relief,\" and were based on \"identical legal grounds.\"</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
