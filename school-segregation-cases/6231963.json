He also regularly worked as a media strategist on\n\npolitical campaigns. Following an incident in Appellant’s classroom in April 2013 in\n\nwhich he made an inappropriate comment to his students, Appellant was suspended,\n\ninvestigated, and recommended for dismissal. Appellant initiated this action against the\n\nschool principal, the superintendent, the board of education, a board member, and a\n\nmember of the North Carolina House of Representatives alleging the suspension,\n\ninvestigation, and recommendation of dismissal were in retaliation for his political\n\nspeech.\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to Appellees and dismissed the case.\n\nBecause Appellant has not put forward evidence beyond mere speculation in support of\n\nhis claims, he cannot make a prima facie showing of retaliation. Accordingly, we affirm\n\nthe decision of the district court.\n\n                                           I.\n\n                                          A.\n\n       We view the relevant facts “in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,”\n\nAppellant. Grutzmacher v. Howard Cty., 851 F.3d 332, 342 (4th Cir. 2017). From 2006\n\nto April 2013, Appellant taught high school civics at MHS. During this time, Appellant\n\nwas generally well respected among the students and had a near-spotless personnel record\n\nat MHS.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       In 2004, 2006, and 2008, Appellant also worked on campaigns of politicians\n\nrunning against North Carolina House of Representatives Member Robert Gillespie\n\n(“Gillespie”). As early as 2006 and continuing through 2012, Gillespie vocalized his\n\ndisdain for Appellant to MHS’s former principal, Ben Talbert (“Talbert”), and former\n\nsuperintendent, Mike Murray (“Murray”). After these conversations, Talbert and Murray\n\nwarned Appellant that Gillespie wanted him terminated. Additionally, as a result of\n\nAppellant’s campaign work, Gillespie allegedly threatened Appellant directly saying he\n\nwould pay Appellant back and “beat [him] like a bad drum.” J.A. 785:13–14. 1\n\n      At the beginning of the 2012–2013 school year, Gillespie toured MHS with the\n\nnewly hired superintendent, Gerri Martín (“Martín”). During the tour, Gillespie refused\n\nto enter Appellant’s classroom, explaining to Martín that Appellant had “worked against\n\n[Gillespie] in previous elections.”    J.A. 663:3–664:9.     When Gillespie and Martín\n\napproached Appellant’s classroom doorway, Gillespie allegedly pulled Martín back and\n\nsaid “that’s the one I’ve been telling you about.” Id. at 475:1–7. On the same day,\n\nGillespie also approached Talbert to remind him of Gillespie’s contempt for Appellant.\n\n                                            B.\n\n      Fast forward to April 17, 2013.       On that day, during AP Government class,\n\nAppellant told his students, “There is a study out there that says that men think about sex\n\nevery six seconds, unless you happen to be sitting next to your girlfriend, and it might be\n\n\n      1\n          Citations to the “J.A.” refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this\nappeal.\n\n\n                                             4\n\fmore like four seconds.” J.A. 381:9–19. Two students, a boyfriend and girlfriend, were\n\nseated next to each other when Appellant made this comment. The girlfriend became\n\nupset, believing it to be directed at her. During the mid-class lunch break that day,\n\nAppellant apologized to the girlfriend.      Later in the day, Appellant witnessed the\n\ngirlfriend crying in the library during his planning period. He went back and forth to the\n\nlibrary to “find out what was going on.” Id. at 393:15. Then, when the girlfriend exited\n\nthe library, Appellant sought her out and confronted her in a stairwell. Appellant’s stated\n\ngoal for stopping the girlfriend in the stairwell was to prevent her from going to the\n\nprincipal.   See id. at 387:18–21 (“Q.      Well, would your goal, when you spoke to\n\n[girlfriend] at 3-something in the afternoon, to, the end result be, that she would not go to\n\nthe principal?   A.   Yes.”).   The girlfriend, through her mother, ultimately reported\n\nAppellant to school administrators.\n\n                                             C.\n\n        After the girlfriend’s mother complained about Appellant, the newly hired\n\nprincipal, Natalie Gouge (“Gouge”), contacted the assistant superintendent, Mark Garrett\n\n(“Garrett”), who instructed Gouge to begin an investigation. On April 18, 2013, Gouge\n\nmet with the girlfriend to discuss the comment. The girlfriend gave Gouge handwritten\n\nnotes of her recollection of the incident. The notes reflect that Appellant targeted her and\n\nher boyfriend by saying “What are you guys laughing about? Oh [boyfriend], I bet you\n\nknow all about that don’t you? Only it’s every four seconds since your girlfriend is\n\nsitting right next to you. I bet it’s six seconds any other time. Right, [girlfriend]?” J.A.\n\n1169.    The same day, Gouge interviewed Appellant and other students.               During\n\n                                             5\n\fAppellant’s interview, he admitted that the in-class comment was not part of his\n\ncurriculum.   During the student interviews, Gouge also learned of an inappropriate\n\nFacebook exchange between Appellant and a student. The exchange was a series of\n\ncomments on a shirtless photo of the student. The exchange is as follows:\n\n              Appellant: [Student], I’m going to have to de-friend you if\n              you don’t put some clothes on. Are you trying to join\n              NAMBLA! 2\n\n              Student: Mr. Penly [sic], why are you checking me out with\n              no clothes on.\n\n              Appellant: Hey, you sent that pic to me. You know i’m [sic]\n              happily married. And you obviously have [started] playing\n              for the other TEAM!\n\n              Student: Hahahahaha I meant to send it to Julia sorry.\n\nId. at 536.\n\n       After these interviews, Gouge drafted a letter of reprimand dated April 22, 2013.\n\nBefore delivering the letter to Appellant, Gouge consulted with Martín. Martín declined\n\nto issue a letter of reprimand and instead opted to suspend Appellant with pay pending\n\nfurther action. Martín instructed that a more in-depth investigation take place.\n\n       As part of this further in-depth investigation, on April 24, 2013, Gouge\n\ninterviewed all of the students present in Appellant’s class when the offending comment\n\nwas made. In the interviews, some of the students’ accounts supported the claim that\n\nAppellant directed his statement at the girlfriend and boyfriend. Other students could not\n\n       2\n        NAMBLA is an acronym for the North American Man-Boy Love Association,\nan advocacy group for pedophilia and pederasty.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fremember what was said or what happened. Significantly, none of the students said that\n\nthe comment was not directed at the girlfriend and boyfriend. Furthermore, on May 6,\n\n2013, Appellant participated in a recorded interview with Martín and two other\n\nadministrators related to the comment, the Facebook exchange, and other inappropriate\n\nbehavior uncovered by the investigation. 3 Appellant admitted during this interview: “I\n\nwish I could take back everything” and “[w]hen I realized I had hurt [the girlfriend], I felt\n\nawful. I feel terrible.” J.A. 616, 617.\n\n                                              D.\n\n       On August 21, 2013, Martín issued a notice of intent to recommend dismissal\n\n(“Notice”) to Appellant. The Notice contained six alleged violations: (i) immorality; (ii)\n\ninsubordination; (iii) neglect of duty; (iv) failure to fulfill the duties and responsibilities\n\nimposed upon teachers by the general statutes of North Carolina; (v) failure to comply\n\nwith such reasonable requirements as the board may prescribe; and (vi) any cause which\n\nconstitutes grounds for the revocation of the career teacher’s teaching license. Then, in\n\nSeptember 2013, Martín left her position as superintendent, and Garrett became the\n\ninterim superintendent.\n\n\n\n       3\n         Appellant was also interviewed about reported in-class discussions of gays and\nlesbians having sex in the school bathrooms and Appellant’s Facebook activity, including\nhis Facebook friendship with students, the inappropriate Facebook exchange between\nhim and a student, and his online Facebook activity during school hours. Further,\nAppellant was questioned about the relevance to his curriculum of a story he told in class\nabout Lorena Bobbitt. Lastly, Appellant was confronted about his in-class use of\nYouTube.\n\n\n                                              7\n\f      Appellant requested that the grounds for Martín’s Notice be reviewed by a hearing\n\nofficer at an administrative hearing. In late October 2013, an administrative hearing was\n\nconducted regarding the Notice.      Appellant was able to present evidence and cross\n\nexamine witnesses.      Ultimately, the hearing officer found that the evidence against\n\nAppellant did not warrant Appellant’s termination. Garrett then reinstated Appellant to a\n\nposition at a different institution, Early College, in McDowell County.\n\n      Also in the fall of 2013, Appellant attended a teachers’ rally at the McDowell\n\nCounty courthouse. Two incumbent McDowell County Board of Education members\n\nand one former Board member also attended the rally. Appellant alleges that the Board\n\nmembers told him that another Board member, Russell H. Neighbors (“Neighbors”), and\n\nMartín were conniving to have Appellant terminated and that the charges against him\n\n“were garbage concocted by . . . Martin [sic].” J.A. 508:10–11.\n\n                                            E.\n\n      Appellant filed his initial complaint in the Western District of North Carolina on\n\nJuly 7, 2014, against the Board, Gillespie, Martín, Gouge, and Neighbors (collectively,\n\n“Appellees”). He filed an amended complaint on September 12, 2014, alleging the\n\nfollowing six claims:\n\n             (1)     Count I – First Amendment Retaliation pursuant to 42\n                     U.S.C § 1983 against Neighbors, Martín, and Gouge in\n                     their individual capacities and Gillespie and the Board;\n\n             (2)     Count II – Civil Conspiracy against Martín, Neighbors,\n                     Gouge, and Gillespie in their individual capacities;\n\n             (3)     Count III – North Carolina constitutional violations (in\n                     the alternative) against Neighbors, Martín, and Gouge\n                                            8\n\f                      in their individual capacities and Gillespie and the\n                      Board;\n\n                (4)   Count IV – Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n                      against Martín, Gouge and Gillespie; 4\n\n                (5)   Count V – Tortious Interference with Contract against\n                      Gillespie; and\n\n                (6)   Count VI – Malicious Prosecution against Martín in\n                      her individual capacity.\n\n       On April 22, 2016, all Appellees filed motions for summary judgment. After\n\nbriefing and oral argument, the district court granted the motions and dismissed the\n\namended complaint in its entirety. Appellant timely appealed.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       “We review a district court’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo,\n\napplying the same legal standards as the district court and viewing all facts and\n\nreasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”\n\nGrutzmacher v. Howard Cty., 851 F.3d 332, 342 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Smith v.\n\nGilchrist, 749 F.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2014)). Summary judgment is appropriate “if the\n\nmovant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Count IV was voluntarily dismissed on September 18, 2015.\n\n\n                                             9\n\f                                           III.\n\n                                            A.\n\n                               First Amendment Retaliation\n\n      As explained below, all Appellees are entitled to summary judgment on\n\nAppellant’s First Amendment retaliation claim. The Board is not subject to municipal\n\nliability, and Appellant is unable to present a prima facie case against the remaining\n\nAppellees.    For these reasons, we affirm the district court on Appellant’s First\n\nAmendment retaliation claim.\n\n                                            1.\n\n                           The Board and Municipal Liability\n\n      “To hold a municipality (a local government entity) liable for a constitutional\n\nviolation under § 1983, the plaintiff must show that the execution of a policy or custom\n\nof the municipality caused the violation.” Love-Lane v. Martin, 355 F.3d 766, 782 (4th\n\nCir. 2004) (citing Hall v. Marion Sch. Dist. No. 2, 31 F.3d 183, 195 (4th Cir. 1994)).\n\n“[M]unicipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal policy-makers\n\nunder appropriate circumstances.” Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480\n\n(1986). However, “[t]o hold a municipality liable for a single decision (or violation), the\n\ndecisionmaker must possess ‘final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to\n\nthe action ordered.’” Love-Lane, 355 F.3d at 782 (quoting Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 481).\n\nAnd, a county board of education may only be held liable for “officially sanctioned or\n\nordered” acts. Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       Appellant asserts that Martín had “full . . . and final authority” to issue the Notice\n\nand suspend Appellant with and without pay and thus was the final policymaker for these\n\ndiscrete actions. Appellant’s Reply Br. 25 (emphasis in original); see also Appellant’s\n\nBr. 53–54.    Moreover, Appellant admits that the Board “has no authority to act”\n\nregarding the Notice and suspensions. Appellant’s Reply Br. 24. Nonetheless, Appellant\n\nbelieves that the Board’s lack of oversight with regard to these actions consequently\n\nmakes Martín the final policymaker, and as such, her actions imputable to the Board.\n\nThis argument is meritless. A county board of education “cannot be held liable for\n\npersonnel decisions over which it did not retain final review authority; that is, it is not\n\nliable for decisions committed to [the superintendent’s] discretion because there is no\n\nrespondeat superior liability under § 1983.” Love-Lane, 355 F.3d at 782.\n\n       In order to prevail, Appellant must show that the Board “was aware of the\n\n[alleged] constitutional violation and either participated in, or otherwise condoned it.”\n\nLove-Lane, 355 F.3d at 783. Here, there is no evidence that the Board participated in or\n\ncondoned Appellant’s suspensions or investigation, or that it was aware of a potential\n\nconstitutional violation. Indeed, Appellant admitted that the “[s]uperintendent alone . . .\n\ncan decide to initiate charges and issue a Notice.” Appellant’s Reply Br. 25. Moreover,\n\nalthough at the administrative hearing Appellant argued that his recommended dismissal\n\nwas retaliatory in nature for his involvement in political campaigns, the Board was never\n\ninvolved in the hearing procedure and therefore was not on notice of Appellant’s alleged\n\nconstitutional violations. This is underscored by the fact that Garrett did not directly ask\n\nthe Board to terminate Appellant.       Instead, Garrett, on his own accord, reinstated\n\n                                             11\n\fAppellant. For these reasons, the Board is not subject to municipal liability in this case\n\nand the district court’s decision is affirmed as to the Board.\n\n                                              2.\n\n                                   Remaining Appellees\n\n                                              a.\n\n       Where a public employee sues a government employer for First Amendment\n\nretaliation pursuant to § 1983, the employee must prove:\n\n              (1) [He] was speaking as a citizen upon a matter of public\n              concern [and not] as an employee about a matter of personal\n              interest; (2) [His] interest in speaking upon the matter of\n              public concern outweighed the government’s interest in\n              providing effective and efficient services to the public; and\n              (3) [His] speech was a substantial factor in the employee’s\n              [adverse employment] decision.\n\nMcVey v. Stacy, 157 F.3d 271, 277–78 (4th Cir. 1998) (the “McVey test”); accord\n\nGrutzmacher v. Howard Cty., 851 F.3d 332, 342 (4th Cir. 2017). Here, the parties only\n\ndispute prong three of this test -- also called the causation prong.\n\n       This court recently reiterated a two-step process for analyzing the requisite “but\n\nfor” causation necessary to satisfy the causation prong of the McVey test.\n\n              The plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving that his\n              exercise of his First Amendment rights was a substantial or\n              motivating factor in the employer’s [adverse employment]\n              decision . . . . And if the plaintiff satisfies that burden, the\n              defendant will avoid liability if he can demonstrate, by a\n              preponderance of the evidence, that he would have made the\n              same employment decision absent the protected expression.\n\nBland v. Roberts, 730 F.3d 368, 375 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal citations and quotations\n\nomitted); see also Ridpath v. Bd. of Gov’rs Marshall Univ., 447 F.3d 292, 318 (4th Cir.\n                                              12\n\f2006) (“The causation requirement is ‘rigorous’ in that the protected expression must\n\nhave been the ‘but for’ cause of the adverse employment action alleged.”). This two-step\n\nprocess is consistent with Supreme Court precedent. See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd.\n\nof Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977) (holding if a plaintiff can show a prima facie\n\ncase of First Amendment retaliation, the district court should go on to determine whether\n\nthe defendant has shown “by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached\n\nthe same decision . . . even in the absence of the protected conduct”).\n\n                                             b.\n\n       This court has repeatedly stated that where causal facts are in dispute, giving rise\n\nto a genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment is not appropriate. See, e.g., Love-\n\nLane, 355 F.3d at 779 (“If the causal facts about the [adverse employment action] are in\n\ndispute, summary judgment is not appropriate.”); id. at 776 (“Causation can be decided\n\non summary judgment only in those instances when there are no causal facts in dispute.”\n\n(internal quotations omitted)). If there is no genuine issue of material fact on causation\n\nand the plaintiff can prove a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to prove\n\n“by a preponderance of the evidence, that he would have made the same employment\n\ndecision absent the protected expression.” Bland, 730 F.3d at 375. To make a prima\n\nfacie showing of causation, Appellant must put forward evidence beyond speculation that\n\nprovides a sufficient basis for a reasonable inference of causation. See id. at 383–84.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f                                            i.\n\n                           Appellees Neighbors and Gillespie\n\n      Appellant has not offered even a mere scintilla of evidence that Neighbors or\n\nGillespie caused his alleged adverse employment action. See Constantine v. Rectors &\n\nVisitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 499 (4th Cir. 2005) (“A plaintiff seeking\n\nto recover for First Amendment retaliation must allege that . . . the defendants took some\n\naction that adversely affected her First Amendment rights . . . .” (emphasis supplied));\n\nGoldstein v. Chestnut Ridge Volunteer Fire Co., 218 F.3d 337, 352 (4th Cir. 2000)\n\n(“[T]he employee must establish retaliation of some kind -- that he was deprived of a\n\nvaluable government benefit or adversely affected in a manner that, at the very least,\n\nwould tend to chill his exercise of First Amendment rights.”). Indeed, neither Gillespie\n\nnor Neighbors took any action with regard to Appellant’s employment, much less any\n\nadverse employment action. Without such evidence, Appellant cannot make out a prima\n\nfacie case of First Amendment retaliation against Neighbors or Gillespie. Accordingly,\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate as to Neighbors and Gillespie.\n\n                                            ii.\n\n                                    Appellee Gouge\n\n      As to Gouge, although she conducted and participated in the investigation,\n\nAppellant lacks sufficient evidence to prove the requisite causal connection. Indeed,\n\nAppellant admitted as much during his deposition:\n\n             Q: Okay. Do you have any actual evidence that Ms. Gouge’s\n             actions were motivated by a desire to punish you for your\n             political activities?\n\n                                           14\n\f              A: I do not.\n\nJ.A. 504:25–505:3.\n\n       Student declarations claiming both that Gouge pressured them to make certain\n\nstatements during interviews and that her notes from these interviews are inaccurate are\n\nAppellant’s only circumstantial evidence of causation. But these statements only speak\n\nto the propriety of the investigation. They do not create a causal link between Gouge’s\n\ninvestigation and Appellant’s political speech.           Moreover, Gouge’s extended\n\ninvestigation was conducted at the behest of Martín, Gouge’s superior, who simply\n\ndirected Gouge to investigate further due to the seriousness of the allegations. This was a\n\nquite reasonable directive under the circumstances. Therefore, no reasonable jury could\n\nconclude that Appellant’s speech was a substantial factor in Gouge’s investigation.\n\n                                            iii.\n\n                                     Appellee Martín\n\n       Appellant also cannot satisfy the causation prong of the prima facie case against\n\nMartín. In retaliation cases, a causal connection may exist where the employer takes\n\nadverse employment action against an employee shortly after learning of the protected\n\nactivity. See Tobey v. Jones, 706 F.3d 379, 387–88 (4th Cir. 2013) (examining causal\n\nconnection for First Amendment retaliation claim); Price v. Thompson, 380 F.3d 209,\n\n213 (4th Cir. 2004) (examining causal relationship in Title VII context); see also Saleh v.\n\nUpadhyay, 11 F. App’x 241, 256–57 (4th Cir. 2001) (per curiam).            It follows that\n\n“generally the passage of time . . . tends to negate the inference of [causation].” Price,\n\n380 F.3d at 213; see Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty in Roanoke Valley, 145 F.3d\n\n                                            15\n\f653, 657 (4th Cir. 1998) (“A lengthy time lapse between the employer becoming aware\n\nof the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action . . . negates any\n\ninference that a causal connection exists between the two.”). Where a plaintiff rests his\n\ncase on temporal proximity alone, the temporal proximity must be very close. See Clark\n\nCty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) (“The cases that accept mere\n\ntemporal proximity between an employer’s knowledge of protected activity and an\n\nadverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie\n\ncase uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be very close.” (internal quotations\n\nomitted) (emphasis supplied)).\n\n      With regard to Martín, Appellant primarily rests his argument on temporal\n\nproximity, but Appellant and Martín dispute when Martín knew of Appellant’s work in\n\nopposition to Gillespie.   Martín claims in her declaration that she was unaware of\n\nAppellant’s political speech as of April 21, 2013, but Appellant claims Martín knew of\n\nthe protected speech during the tour of MHS due to Gillespie’s comments. See J.A.\n\n663:22–664:9 (informing Martín Appellant had “worked against [Gillespie] in previous\n\nelections”), 475:1–7 (telling Martín, “that’s the one I’ve been telling you about”). On\n\nsummary judgment review, we accept the contention of the nonmoving party, Appellant,\n\nthat Martín knew of the protected speech eight to nine months prior to initiating the\n\ninvestigation. Regardless, this fact is “simply not a sufficient basis for a reasonable\n\ninference [of causation].” Bland, 730 F.3d at 384. Standing alone, knowledge eight to\n\nnine months prior is not “very close.” Breeden, 532 U.S. at 273; see Booth v. Maryland,\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f337 F. App’x 301, 310 (4th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (concluding that a nine month lapse\n\nwas too remote to prove a causal connection alone).\n\n       Further, Appellant’s additional circumstantial evidence of causation does little, if\n\nanything, to help his case. In this vein, Appellant proffers the following: (1) Martín’s\n\nadmission that she did not review Appellant’s personnel file and did not consult with\n\nother administrators about disciplinary action; (2) evidence suggesting allegations\n\nsupporting Appellant’s suspension were not based on legitimate policies and, to the\n\nextent that these policies were applied, they were applied inconsistently; (3) student\n\ndeclarations stating that during the investigation, students were pressured to lie about\n\nAppellant’s actions and that notes of student interviews contain inaccurate information;\n\nand (4) the hearing officer’s report rejecting the grounds for Appellant’s dismissal. 5 This\n\ncircumstantial evidence does nothing more to demonstrate that Appellant’s protected\n\nspeech was a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment action. The only\n\npiece of evidence connecting the speech to the investigation is that Martín learned of the\n\nprotected speech eight to nine months earlier. In this case, eight to nine months is too\n\ndistant to raise an inference of causation.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        Appellees assert that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the court should\nnot consider the hearing officer’s report because it is inadmissible hearsay, is unreliable,\nand because none of the Appellees were party to the administrative hearing. See\nAppellees’ Br. 36. But, the hearing report is not hearsay because it is not offered simply\nto prove the truth of the matter asserted. Instead, it is offered to show that the charges\nwere rejected by the hearing officer.\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       Appellant relies on Price v. Thompson, 380 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 2004), to\n\nsupport the position that the eight to nine month time frame is sufficient to create an\n\ninference of causation. However, Price is not persuasive in this context. In Price, we\n\nassumed without deciding that “in the failure-to-hire context, the employer’s knowledge\n\ncoupled with an adverse action taken at the first opportunity [nine to ten months later]\n\nsatisfies the causal connection element of the prima facie case.” Id. We noted in Price\n\nthat causation was a “close question” but found that a reasonable trier of fact could\n\nconclude that the defendant knew of the protected activity and because of the protected\n\nactivity, the defendant, at the first available opportunity, declined to hire the plaintiff. Id.\n\nThe “first available opportunity” notion discussed in Price is specific to the failure-to-\n\nhire context and, therefore, is inapplicable here. Thus, Price does not save Appellant.\n\n                                              3.\n\n                                    Mt. Healthy Defense\n\n       In Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977), the\n\nSupreme Court held that if a plaintiff can prove a prima facie case of First Amendment\n\nretaliation, a defendant will avoid liability if it demonstrates “by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that it would have reached the same decision . . . even in the absence of the\n\nprotected conduct.” Id. (the “Mt. Healthy defense”); accord Bland, 730 F.3d at 375.\n\nHere, even assuming Appellant could prove a prima facie case of retaliation, Appellees\n\nhave demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the investigation,\n\nsuspensions, and Notice would have been issued even in the absence of the protected\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fconduct. Indeed, the initiation of the investigation in this case was taken in response to\n\nthe comment Appellant himself admits was inappropriate.\n\n       The investigation was initiated by Gouge, approved by Garrett, and extended by\n\nMartín. The suspensions and Notice were both imposed by Martín. Appellees submitted\n\ndeclarations of two veteran superintendents who concurred in the reasonableness of the\n\nprocedures. The Notice lays out ample grounds for its issuance, even if they were\n\nultimately found not to warrant termination. And significantly, Appellant himself admits\n\nthat he “would hope” that if a student “went to the administration [with her complaint],\n\nthe administration would take some sort of action, at least an investigation,” and that if a\n\nteacher denies the allegation, the administration “should investigate” it “thoroughly.”\n\nJ.A. 395:21–396:8.\n\n       Ultimately, Appellant asks this court to invade the realm of local administration of\n\nschool systems reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment. We decline to do so. It\n\nis difficult to fathom how a school and its administrators could be liable for investigating\n\nand taking disciplinary action for the legitimately inappropriate behavior to which\n\nAppellant has admitted in this case. See J.A. 613 (“I crossed the line. I’m so sorry.”),\n\n618 (“I messed up. I said something I shouldn’t have said. . . . I had no idea I was being\n\ninappropriate.”), 374:6–11 (admitting it would be inappropriate to say a student was a\n\npedophile), 390:15–25 (admitting that if Appellant said what the girlfriend reported, it\n\nwould be inappropriate and the girlfriend would have a legitimate reason to complain).\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f                                            B.\n\n                                     Civil Conspiracy\n\n       “To establish a conspiracy claim under § 1983, a plaintiff ‘must present evidence\n\nthat the [defendants] acted jointly in concert and that some overt act was done in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy which resulted in [the] deprivation of a constitutional\n\nright.’” Massey v. Ojaniit, 759 F.3d 343, 357–58 (4th Cir. 2014) (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting Hinkle v. City of Clarksburg, 81 F.3d 416, 421 (4th Cir. 1996)). This burden is\n\n“weighty.” Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 421. “While they need not produce direct evidence of a\n\nmeeting of the minds, [plaintiffs] must come forward with specific circumstantial\n\nevidence that each member of the alleged conspiracy shared the same conspiratorial\n\nobjective.” Id. The evidence “must, at least, reasonably lead to the inference that [the\n\ndefendants] positively or tacitly came to a mutual understanding to try to accomplish a\n\ncommon and unlawful plan.” Id.\n\n       Here, the district court determined that Appellant’s conspiracy claim failed\n\nbecause there had been no constitutional deprivation due to the failure of Appellant’s\n\nFirst Amendment claim. In the alternative, the district court decided that the conspiracy\n\nclaim failed because Appellant “failed to come forward with any evidence, either\n\ncircumstantial or direct, that would allow a jury to find the existence of a conspiracy.”\n\nJ.A. 1250.     Because Appellant’s “evidence amounts to nothing more than rank\n\nspeculation and conjecture[,]” we agree with the district court. Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 422.\n\n       This court has “recognize[d] that direct evidence of a conspiracy is not always\n\navailable” but the court “cannot use this fact as an excuse to forgive Appellant[’s] failure\n\n                                            20\n\fto prove [his] case.” Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 423. Appellant’s allegation of a conspiracy\n\nagainst Appellees here is not supported by any evidence rising above mere speculation\n\nand shows only that Appellees knew each other.             Acquaintanceships alone are\n\ninsufficient to prove a conspiracy. “There is a reason why we do not allow this level of\n\nconjecture to determine lawsuits: such adventures of the mind tend to be unreliable.” Id.\n\n                                            1.\n\n                                   Appellee Neighbors\n\n      In his deposition, Appellant quite clearly admitted that he has no direct evidence\n\nthat Neighbors conspired with any other Appellee:\n\n             Q. Do you have any evidence that Russell Neighbors in any\n             way influenced Dr. Martin in the disciplinary proceedings\n             against you?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             ...\n\n             Q. Well, do you have any evidence . . . that Mitch Gillespie\n             and Russell Neighbors ever had a discussion or\n             communication about you before this lawsuit was filed?\n\n             A. I do not have actual evidence, no.\n\n             Q. Do you have any evidence that Russell Neighbors had a\n             communication with anybody about you before you were\n             suspended from your job?\n\n             A. I do not.\n\n             Q. Do you have any evidence that Russell Neighbors\n             communicated with anybody concerning you prior to the\n             decision by the superintendent to recommend termination?\n\n\n                                           21\n\f             A. I do not.\n\nJ.A. 330:19–22, 506:25–507:13. Appellant further admitted he did not have any evidence\n\nthat “Russell Neighbors was telling . . . Martín what to do with respect to [Appellant’s]\n\nemployment at any time prior to the end of April 2013.” Id. at 530:17–21.\n\n      Despite these admissions, Appellant attempts to rest his case against Neighbors on\n\nthree pieces of circumstantial evidence: (1) deposition testimony demonstrating that\n\nNeighbors was a mutual friend of Gillespie and Martín; (2) text messages showing\n\nNeighbors was helping Martín find other employment; and (3) Appellant’s account of\n\nstatements made to him by other board members implicating Neighbors in a scheme to\n\nhave him fired.\n\n      Friendship or acquaintanceship, standing alone, is insufficient to “reasonably lead\n\nto the inference that Appellees positively or tacitly came to a mutual understanding to try\n\nto accomplish a common and unlawful plan.” Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 421; cf. United States\n\nv. Burgos, 94 F.3d 849, 869–70 (4th Cir. 1996) (concluding that for a criminal\n\nconspiracy, acquaintanceship constitutes circumstantial evidence that may, along with\n\nother evidence, support a conviction).           At base, Appellant’s evidence requires\n\n“speculation and the piling of inferences” and is inadequate to show any “mutual\n\nunderstanding” reached by Neighbors and any other Appellee. Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 421,\n\n423. Therefore, Appellant’s civil conspiracy claim against Neighbors fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f                                           2.\n\n                                    Appellee Gouge\n\n      Likewise, Appellant has offered no direct evidence that Gouge conspired with any\n\nother Appellees. During deposition, Appellant admitted the following:\n\n             Q. Well, can you point me to any evidence where it says that\n             Ms. Gouge did these things in order to curry favor with Dr.\n             Martin [sic]?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             ...\n\n             Q. Do you have any evidence that Ms. Gouge was trying to\n             curry favor with Mr. Neighbors as part of the disciplinary\n             process?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             Q. Okay. Do you have any evidence that Ms. Gouge was\n             trying to curry favor with Mr. Gillespie as part of the\n             disciplinary process?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             ...\n\n             Q: Okay. Sitting here today, do you have any actual evidence\n             that Natalie Gouge entered into a conspiracy or an agreement\n             with anybody to pursue a disciplinary proceeding in order to\n             punish you for your political activities?\n\n             A: I -- I have no actual evidence. I have circumstantial\n             evidence in that she built a case of lies and made things up\n             about me, and I believe that she did that to win favor with the\n             new superintendent as well as others.\n\nJ.A. 470:17–20, 491:2–9, 504:15–25.\n\n\n                                           23\n\f      Appellant rests his conspiracy case against Gouge on the same circumstantial\n\nevidence offered in support of his First Amendment retaliation claim -- that she pressured\n\nstudents in interviews and took inaccurate notes. If anything, this evidence evinces\n\nnothing more than misconduct on Gouge’s part.          The link to any animus is pure\n\nspeculation. No reasonable trier of fact could conclude, based on this evidence, that\n\nGouge reached any mutual understanding with any of the other Appellees in this case.\n\n                                            3.\n\n                             Appellees Gillespie and Martín\n\n      As for Gillespie and Martín, Appellant again puts forth no direct evidence of a\n\nconspiracy. Appellant admitted:\n\n             Q. Do you have any actual evidence that Mitch Gillespie\n             actually did anything to either cause or encourage Dr.\n             Martin’s [sic] suspension or recommendation of termination?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             ...\n\n             Q. Well, do you have any evidence that Dr. Martin [sic] was\n             taking action as to you as part of this conspiracy with Mr.\n             Gillespie and Mr. Neighbors? Do you have any actual\n             evidence?\n\n             A. No. No.\n\nId. at 319:23–320:2, 328:20–24.      Although Appellant has presented circumstantial\n\nevidence that Gillespie communicated his disdain for Appellant to Martín, there is no\n\nevidence beyond conjecture that the two ever had a mutual understanding to retaliate\n\nagainst Appellant for his protected speech. There is no specific circumstantial evidence\n\n                                           24\n\fconnecting Gillespie’s animus to Martín’s action weighty enough to create a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to these two defendants.\n\n                                             4.\n\n                                   Conspiracy Evidence\n\n       Appellant has not met his burden to come forward with “specific circumstantial\n\nevidence that each member of the alleged conspiracy shared the same conspiratorial\n\nobjective.” Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 421. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment on the Appellant’s civil conspiracy claim.\n\n                                             C.\n\n                                North Carolina Constitution\n\n       In his Amended Complaint, Appellant asserts an alternative claim for retaliation\n\nbased on the exercise of his rights under Sections 12 and 14 of Article I of the North\n\nCarolina constitution.    Appellant brought this claim against Gouge, Martín, and\n\nNeighbors in their official capacities, and the Board and Gillespie. The district court\n\ndisposed of these claims for the same reasons it disposed of Appellant’s First\n\nAmendment retaliation claim. We do the same.\n\n       In North Carolina, “[t]he standards for free speech retaliation claims under the\n\nstate constitution are the same as those for free speech claims under the federal\n\nconstitution.” Sheaffer v. Cty. of Chatham, 337 F. Supp. 2d 709, 729 (M.D.N.C. 2004);\n\nsee Evans v. Cowan, 510 S.E.2d 170, 175–76 (N.C. Ct. App. 1999). As discussed,\n\nAppellant’s First Amendment retaliation claim fails on the merits as to Gouge, Gillespie,\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fMartín, and Neighbors. Accordingly, his North Carolina constitutional claim similarly\n\nfails as to these Appellees.\n\n       In North Carolina, a plaintiff can only proceed under the state constitution against\n\nthe state if no other adequate state law remedy exists. See Corum v. Univ. of N.C.\n\nThrough Bd. of Gov’rs, 413 S.E.2d 276, 289 (N.C. 1992) (“[I]n the absence of an\n\nadequate state remedy, one whose state constitutional rights have been abridged has a\n\ndirect claim against the State under our Constitution.”). Here, Appellant has not alleged\n\nany other state law claims against the Board so he has not otherwise attempted to gain an\n\nadequate remedy under state law. Moreover, Appellant has not shown (or even argued)\n\nthat he does not have any other adequate state remedy. See Craig ex rel. Craig v. New\n\nHanover Cty. Bd. of Ed., 678 S.E.2d 351, 355 (N.C. 2009) (“[T]o be considered adequate\n\nin redressing a constitutional wrong, a plaintiff must have at least the opportunity to enter\n\nthe courthouse doors and present his claim.”). Because a claim against North Carolina\n\nunder the North Carolina constitution is only available in the absence of an adequate state\n\nremedy, Appellant does not have a claim against the Board. Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt is affirmed as to Appellant’s North Carolina constitutional claim.\n\n                                             D.\n\n                                   Tortious Interference\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on\n\nAppellant’s tortious interference claim because, according to Appellant, Gillespie did not\n\nchallenge this claim in his motion for summary judgment.           But his motion clearly\n\nrequested summary judgment on “all claims against him.” J.A. 271. While courts are not\n\n                                             26\n\fobligated to do the work of the litigants, even if Gillespie presented no argument or\n\nauthority on the tortious interference claim, district courts may enter summary judgment\n\nsua sponte “so long as the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with\n\nall of her evidence.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326 (1986). Here, Gillespie\n\nmoved for summary judgment on “all claims against him.” J.A. 271. Appellant had\n\nraised five claims against Gillespie, including the tortious interference claim.\n\nAccordingly, Appellant was on notice “to come forward with all . . . evidence” relevant\n\nto his tortious interference claim, satisfying Celotex. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 326; see\n\nalso Allstate Ins. Co. v. Fritz, 452 F.3d 316, 323 (4th Cir. 2006) (finding adequate notice\n\nwhere one of two defendants moved for summary judgment on negligence claim).\n\n       We agree with the district court that Appellant has failed to put forward adequate\n\nevidence to demonstrate that Gillespie intentionally induced any other Appellee to breach\n\nAppellant’s employment contract with the Board. Accordingly, the district court did not\n\nerr.\n\n                                             E.\n                                  Malicious Prosecution\n\n       Finally, Appellant alleges a state law claim for malicious prosecution against\n\nMartín for the initiation of dismissal proceedings and prosecution of the charges\n\ncontained in the Notice. The district court determined that “[b]ecause Plaintiff . . . failed\n\nto establish a genuine issue of material fact as to malice and lack of probable cause,\n\nsummary judgment [was] appropriate on Plaintiff’s claim for malicious prosecution.”\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fJ.A. 1258. We agree that Appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to show a lack\n\nof probable cause.\n\n       Under North Carolina law, in order to establish a claim for malicious prosecution,\n\n“a plaintiff must show that the defendant (1) initiated or participated in the earlier\n\nproceeding; (2) did so maliciously; (3) without probable cause; and (4) the earlier\n\nproceeding ended in favor of the plaintiff.” Turner v. Thomas, 794 S.E.2d 439, 444 (N.C.\n\n2016). The parties here do not dispute the first or fourth elements. “Where the claim is\n\none for malicious prosecution, [p]robable cause . . . has been properly defined as the\n\nexistence of such facts and circumstances, known to [the defendant] at the time, as would\n\ninduce a reasonable man to commence a prosecution.” Best v. Duke Univ., 448 S.E.2d\n\n506, 510 (N.C. 1994) (alterations in original) (internal quotations omitted).\n\n       In fact, the grounds set forth in the Notice outline the facts and circumstances\n\nknown to Martín at the commencement of the prosecution. This is undisputed. But,\n\nAppellant has not produced evidence sufficient to support a finding that, in light of these\n\nfacts and circumstances known to Martín, it was unreasonable to commence a\n\nprosecution.   To show unreasonableness, Appellant relies on Gouge’s preliminary\n\ndetermination that a letter of reprimand was the appropriate disciplinary action for\n\nAppellant’s inappropriate comment. Appellant compares Martín’s Notice to Gouge’s\n\nletter of reprimand.     The difference in severity of discipline, Appellant argues,\n\ndemonstrates that the facts would not induce a reasonable person to commence a\n\nprosecution.    However, the letter of reprimand does not reflect the totality of\n\ncircumstances justifying Martín’s later decision to prosecute.       Martín recommended\n\n                                            28\n\fAppellant’s termination based on all of Appellant’s inappropriate behavior as a\n\n“conglomeration of the whole thing” and not “one isolated event.” J.A. 741:25–742:1,\n\n743:5–6. She stated, “One event led to an investigation and that revealed multiple\n\noffenses.” Id. at 743:6–8. Gouge’s letter of reprimand was drafted in response to the\n\noffending comment on April 17, 2013.                Moreover, Appellant arguably concedes\n\nreasonableness by stating that he “hope[d]” the administration would “take some sort of\n\naction, at least an investigation” in response to a complaint by a student of inappropriate\n\nconduct. Id. at 395:21–396:8.\n\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellant, Appellant cannot\n\nshow that the grounds stated in the Notice, as facts and circumstances known to Martín at\n\nthe time she initiated the proceedings, would not induce a reasonable person to\n\ncommence a prosecution. Therefore, summary judgment was proper on these grounds.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       In light of the foregoing, the decision of the district court is\n\n                                                                             AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\fWILKINSON, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n       I am pleased to concur in Judge Thacker’s fine opinion. This case presents a\n\nschool system personnel problem of the sort that occurs in hundreds, if not thousands, of\n\nschool systems across the country every day. Here the plaintiff, a teacher, allegedly\n\nsingled out two students’ sexual proclivities in front of their entire AP Government class,\n\ndriving the young woman involved to tears and the woman’s mother to complain to\n\nschool administrators.\n\n       Of course school administrators looked into it. It would have been a dereliction of\n\nduty not to do so. Their investigation revealed further inappropriate statements the\n\nteacher made to a student on Facebook, speculating about the student’s possible\n\nmembership in the North American Man-Boy Love Association. Whether all this conduct\n\nmerited a reprimand, suspension, or termination was well within the administrators’\n\ndiscretion. For their efforts, they were hit with this litigation, which has been going on for\n\nover three years and in which the joint appendix alone has swelled to over 1200 pages.\n\n       I am unable to detect the slightest scintilla of educational benefit from all the\n\nchurning in this lawsuit. In fact, it has drained the time of educators and the resources of\n\na school district already burdened, as most districts are, with the steep compliance costs\n\nof federal regulation. Far be it from me to entertain the quaint notion that the efforts of\n\neducators should be spent on education, but that was assuredly not where this lawsuit\n\ndirected them.\n\n       I do not think any section 1983 suit should evince such a profound lack of faith in\n\nthe ability of local school systems to address their own personnel issues. There are\n\n                                             30\n\fteachers, parents, principals, superintendents, school boards, and state courts and\n\nlegislatures all engaged in that task. By and large, they do a fine job and draw upon\n\ncommunity input, not just courtroom arguments.\n\n      Education has long been a matter of paramount state and local concern. While\n\nfederal authority has sometimes played a crucial role, school systems have come a long\n\nway since the unlawful and immoral practice of racial segregation left federal courts with\n\nno choice but to intervene. It is high time that the federal-state balance in this area be\n\nrestored, and that litigation be viewed through the prism of the progress states have made\n\nand their rightful role in our constitutional structure. Federal judges otherwise risk\n\nbecoming unnecessary chefs in an overcrowded kitchen without the educational\n\nunderstanding or the community involvement required to achieve a palatable outcome.\n\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\f",

He also regularly worked as a media strategist on\n\npolitical campaigns. Following an incident in Appellant’s classroom in April 2013 in\n\nwhich he made an inappropriate comment to his students, Appellant was suspended,\n\ninvestigated, and recommended for dismissal. Appellant initiated this action against the\n\nschool principal, the superintendent, the board of education, a board member, and a\n\nmember of the North Carolina House of Representatives alleging the suspension,\n\ninvestigation, and recommendation of dismissal were in retaliation for his political\n\nspeech.\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to Appellees and dismissed the case.\n\nBecause Appellant has not put forward evidence beyond mere speculation in support of\n\nhis claims, he cannot make a prima facie showing of retaliation.

Grutzmacher v. Howard Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (4th Cir. 2017). From 2006\n\nto April 2013, Appellant taught high school civics at MHS. During this time, Appellant\n\nwas generally well respected among the students and had a near-spotless personnel record\n\nat MHS.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       In 2004, 2006, and 2008, Appellant also worked on campaigns of politicians\n\nrunning against North Carolina House of Representatives Member Robert Gillespie\n\n(“Gillespie”). As early as 2006 and continuing through 2012, Gillespie vocalized his\n\ndisdain for Appellant to MHS’s former principal, Ben Talbert (“Talbert”), and former\n\nsuperintendent, Mike Murray (“Murray”). After these conversations, Talbert and Murray\n\nwarned Appellant that Gillespie wanted him terminated. Additionally, as a result of\n\nAppellant’s campaign work, Gillespie allegedly threatened Appellant directly saying he\n\nwould pay Appellant back and “beat [him] like a bad drum.” J.A. 785:13–14. 1\n\n      At the beginning of the 2012–2013 school year, Gillespie toured MHS with the\n\nnewly hired superintendent, Gerri Martín (“Martín”). During the tour, Gillespie refused\n\nto enter Appellant’s classroom, explaining to Martín that Appellant had “worked against\n\n[Gillespie] in previous elections.”    J.A. 663:3–664:9.     When Gillespie and Martín\n\napproached Appellant’s classroom doorway, Gillespie allegedly pulled Martín back and\n\nsaid “that’s the one I’ve been telling you about.” Id. at 475:1–7. On the same day,\n\nGillespie also approached Talbert to remind him of Gillespie’s contempt for Appellant.\n\n                                            B.\n\n      Fast forward to April 17, 2013.       On that day, during AP Government class,\n\nAppellant told his students, “There is a study out there that says that men think about sex\n\nevery six seconds, unless you happen to be sitting next to your girlfriend, and it might be\n\n\n      1\n          Citations to the “J.A.” refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this\nappeal.\n\n\n                                             4\n\fmore like four seconds.” J.A. 381:9–19. Two students, a boyfriend and girlfriend, were\n\nseated next to each other when Appellant made this comment. The girlfriend became\n\nupset, believing it to be directed at her. During the mid-class lunch break that day,\n\nAppellant apologized to the girlfriend.      Later in the day, Appellant witnessed the\n\ngirlfriend crying in the library during his planning period. He went back and forth to the\n\nlibrary to “find out what was going on.” Id. at 393:15. Then, when the girlfriend exited\n\nthe library, Appellant sought her out and confronted her in a stairwell. Appellant’s stated\n\ngoal for stopping the girlfriend in the stairwell was to prevent her from going to the\n\nprincipal.   See id. at 387:18–21 (“Q.      Well, would your goal, when you spoke to\n\n[girlfriend] at 3-something in the afternoon, to, the end result be, that she would not go to\n\nthe principal?   A.   Yes.”).   The girlfriend, through her mother, ultimately reported\n\nAppellant to school administrators.\n\n                                             C.\n\n        After the girlfriend’s mother complained about Appellant, the newly hired\n\nprincipal, Natalie Gouge (“Gouge”), contacted the assistant superintendent, Mark Garrett\n\n(“Garrett”), who instructed Gouge to begin an investigation. On April 18, 2013, Gouge\n\nmet with the girlfriend to discuss the comment. The girlfriend gave Gouge handwritten\n\nnotes of her recollection of the incident. The notes reflect that Appellant targeted her and\n\nher boyfriend by saying “What are you guys laughing about? Oh [boyfriend], I bet you\n\nknow all about that don’t you? Only it’s every four seconds since your girlfriend is\n\nsitting right next to you. I bet it’s six seconds any other time. Right, [girlfriend]?” J.A.\n\n1169.    The same day, Gouge interviewed Appellant and other students.               During\n\n                                             5\n\fAppellant’s interview, he admitted that the in-class comment was not part of his\n\ncurriculum.   During the student interviews, Gouge also learned of an inappropriate\n\nFacebook exchange between Appellant and a student. The exchange was a series of\n\ncomments on a shirtless photo of the student. The exchange is as follows:\n\n              Appellant: [Student], I’m going to have to de-friend you if\n              you don’t put some clothes on. Are you trying to join\n              NAMBLA! 2\n\n              Student: Mr. Penly [sic], why are you checking me out with\n              no clothes on.\n\n              Appellant: Hey, you sent that pic to me. You know i’m [sic]\n              happily married. And you obviously have [started] playing\n              for the other TEAM!\n\n              Student: Hahahahaha I meant to send it to Julia sorry.\n\nId. at 536.\n\n       After these interviews, Gouge drafted a letter of reprimand dated April 22, 2013.\n\nBefore delivering the letter to Appellant, Gouge consulted with Martín. Martín declined\n\nto issue a letter of reprimand and instead opted to suspend Appellant with pay pending\n\nfurther action. Martín instructed that a more in-depth investigation take place.\n\n       As part of this further in-depth investigation, on April 24, 2013, Gouge\n\ninterviewed all of the students present in Appellant’s class when the offending comment\n\nwas made. In the interviews, some of the students’ accounts supported the claim that\n\nAppellant directed his statement at the girlfriend and boyfriend. Other students could not\n\n       2\n        NAMBLA is an acronym for the North American Man-Boy Love Association,\nan advocacy group for pedophilia and pederasty.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fremember what was said or what happened. Significantly, none of the students said that\n\nthe comment was not directed at the girlfriend and boyfriend. Furthermore, on May 6,\n\n2013, Appellant participated in a recorded interview with Martín and two other\n\nadministrators related to the comment, the Facebook exchange, and other inappropriate\n\nbehavior uncovered by the investigation. 3 Appellant admitted during this interview: “I\n\nwish I could take back everything” and “[w]hen I realized I had hurt [the girlfriend], I felt\n\nawful. I feel terrible.” J.A. 616, 617.\n\n                                              D.\n\n       On August 21, 2013, Martín issued a notice of intent to recommend dismissal\n\n(“Notice”) to Appellant. The Notice contained six alleged violations: (i) immorality; (ii)\n\ninsubordination; (iii) neglect of duty; (iv) failure to fulfill the duties and responsibilities\n\nimposed upon teachers by the general statutes of North Carolina; (v) failure to comply\n\nwith such reasonable requirements as the board may prescribe; and (vi) any cause which\n\nconstitutes grounds for the revocation of the career teacher’s teaching license. Then, in\n\nSeptember 2013, Martín left her position as superintendent, and Garrett became the\n\ninterim superintendent.\n\n\n\n       3\n         Appellant was also interviewed about reported in-class discussions of gays and\nlesbians having sex in the school bathrooms and Appellant’s Facebook activity, including\nhis Facebook friendship with students, the inappropriate Facebook exchange between\nhim and a student, and his online Facebook activity during school hours. Further,\nAppellant was questioned about the relevance to his curriculum of a story he told in class\nabout Lorena Bobbitt. Lastly, Appellant was confronted about his in-class use of\nYouTube.\n\n\n                                              7\n\f      Appellant requested that the grounds for Martín’s Notice be reviewed by a hearing\n\nofficer at an administrative hearing. In late October 2013, an administrative hearing was\n\nconducted regarding the Notice.      Appellant was able to present evidence and cross\n\nexamine witnesses.      Ultimately, the hearing officer found that the evidence against\n\nAppellant did not warrant Appellant’s termination. Garrett then reinstated Appellant to a\n\nposition at a different institution, Early College, in McDowell County.\n\n      Also in the fall of 2013, Appellant attended a teachers’ rally at the McDowell\n\nCounty courthouse. Two incumbent McDowell County Board of Education members\n\nand one former Board member also attended the rally. Appellant alleges that the Board\n\nmembers told him that another Board member, Russell H. Neighbors (“Neighbors”), and\n\nMartín were conniving to have Appellant terminated and that the charges against him\n\n“were garbage concocted by . . . Martin [sic].” J.A. 508:10–11.\n\n                                            E.\n\n      Appellant filed his initial complaint in the Western District of North Carolina on\n\nJuly 7, 2014, against the Board, Gillespie, Martín, Gouge, and Neighbors (collectively,\n\n“Appellees”).

Appellant’s Reply Br. 25 (emphasis in original); see also Appellant’s\n\nBr. 53–54.    Moreover, Appellant admits that the Board “has no authority to act”\n\nregarding the Notice and suspensions. Appellant’s Reply Br. 24. Nonetheless, Appellant\n\nbelieves that the Board’s lack of oversight with regard to these actions consequently\n\nmakes Martín the final policymaker, and as such, her actions imputable to the Board.\n\nThis argument is meritless. A county board of education “cannot be held liable for\n\npersonnel decisions over which it did not retain final review authority; that is, it is not\n\nliable for decisions committed to [the superintendent’s] discretion because there is no\n\nrespondeat superior liability under § 1983.” Love-Lane, 355 F.3d at 782.\n\n       In order to prevail, Appellant must show that the Board “was aware of the\n\n[alleged] constitutional violation and either participated in, or otherwise condoned it.”\n\nLove-Lane, 355 F.3d at 783. Here, there is no evidence that the Board participated in or\n\ncondoned Appellant’s suspensions or investigation, or that it was aware of a potential\n\nconstitutional violation. Indeed, Appellant admitted that the “[s]uperintendent alone . . .\n\ncan decide to initiate charges and issue a Notice.” Appellant’s Reply Br. 25. Moreover,\n\nalthough at the administrative hearing Appellant argued that his recommended dismissal\n\nwas retaliatory in nature for his involvement in political campaigns, the Board was never\n\ninvolved in the hearing procedure and therefore was not on notice of Appellant’s alleged\n\nconstitutional violations. This is underscored by the fact that Garrett did not directly ask\n\nthe Board to terminate Appellant.       Instead, Garrett, on his own accord, reinstated\n\n                                             11\n\fAppellant.

But these statements only speak\n\nto the propriety of the investigation. They do not create a causal link between Gouge’s\n\ninvestigation and Appellant’s political speech.           Moreover, Gouge’s extended\n\ninvestigation was conducted at the behest of Martín, Gouge’s superior, who simply\n\ndirected Gouge to investigate further due to the seriousness of the allegations. This was a\n\nquite reasonable directive under the circumstances.

Martín claims in her declaration that she was unaware of\n\nAppellant’s political speech as of April 21, 2013, but Appellant claims Martín knew of\n\nthe protected speech during the tour of MHS due to Gillespie’s comments. See J.A.\n\n663:22–664:9 (informing Martín Appellant had “worked against [Gillespie] in previous\n\nelections”), 475:1–7 (telling Martín, “that’s the one I’ve been telling you about”). On\n\nsummary judgment review, we accept the contention of the nonmoving party, Appellant,\n\nthat Martín knew of the protected speech eight to nine months prior to initiating the\n\ninvestigation. Regardless, this fact is “simply not a sufficient basis for a reasonable\n\ninference [of causation].” Bland, 730 F.3d at 384. Standing alone, knowledge eight to\n\nnine months prior is not “very close.” Breeden, 532 U.S. at 273; see Booth v. Maryland,\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f337 F. App’x 301, 310 (4th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (concluding that a nine month lapse\n\nwas too remote to prove a causal connection alone).\n\n       Further, Appellant’s additional circumstantial evidence of causation does little, if\n\nanything, to help his case. In this vein, Appellant proffers the following: (1) Martín’s\n\nadmission that she did not review Appellant’s personnel file and did not consult with\n\nother administrators about disciplinary action; (2) evidence suggesting allegations\n\nsupporting Appellant’s suspension were not based on legitimate policies and, to the\n\nextent that these policies were applied, they were applied inconsistently; (3) student\n\ndeclarations stating that during the investigation, students were pressured to lie about\n\nAppellant’s actions and that notes of student interviews contain inaccurate information;\n\nand (4) the hearing officer’s report rejecting the grounds for Appellant’s dismissal. 5 This\n\ncircumstantial evidence does nothing more to demonstrate that Appellant’s protected\n\nspeech was a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment action. The only\n\npiece of evidence connecting the speech to the investigation is that Martín learned of the\n\nprotected speech eight to nine months earlier. In this case, eight to nine months is too\n\ndistant to raise an inference of causation.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        Appellees assert that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the court should\nnot consider the hearing officer’s report because it is inadmissible hearsay, is unreliable,\nand because none of the Appellees were party to the administrative hearing. See\nAppellees’ Br. 36. But, the hearing report is not hearsay because it is not offered simply\nto prove the truth of the matter asserted. Instead, it is offered to show that the charges\nwere rejected by the hearing officer.\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       Appellant relies on Price v.

However, Price is not persuasive in this context. In Price, we\n\nassumed without deciding that “in the failure-to-hire context, the employer’s knowledge\n\ncoupled with an adverse action taken at the first opportunity [nine to ten months later]\n\nsatisfies the causal connection element of the prima facie case.” Id. We noted in Price\n\nthat causation was a “close question” but found that a reasonable trier of fact could\n\nconclude that the defendant knew of the protected activity and because of the protected\n\nactivity, the defendant, at the first available opportunity, declined to hire the plaintiff. Id.\n\nThe “first available opportunity” notion discussed in Price is specific to the failure-to-\n\nhire context and, therefore, is inapplicable here. Thus, Price does not save Appellant.\n\n                                              3.\n\n                                    Mt. Healthy Defense\n\n       In Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist.

The suspensions and Notice were both imposed by Martín. Appellees submitted\n\ndeclarations of two veteran superintendents who concurred in the reasonableness of the\n\nprocedures. The Notice lays out ample grounds for its issuance, even if they were\n\nultimately found not to warrant termination. And significantly, Appellant himself admits\n\nthat he “would hope” that if a student “went to the administration [with her complaint],\n\nthe administration would take some sort of action, at least an investigation,” and that if a\n\nteacher denies the allegation, the administration “should investigate” it “thoroughly.”\n\nJ.A. 395:21–396:8.\n\n       Ultimately, Appellant asks this court to invade the realm of local administration of\n\nschool systems reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment. We decline to do so. It\n\nis difficult to fathom how a school and its administrators could be liable for investigating\n\nand taking disciplinary action for the legitimately inappropriate behavior to which\n\nAppellant has admitted in this case. See J.A. 613 (“I crossed the line. I’m so sorry.”),\n\n618 (“I messed up. I said something I shouldn’t have said. . . . I had no idea I was being\n\ninappropriate.”), 374:6–11 (admitting it would be inappropriate to say a student was a\n\npedophile), 390:15–25 (admitting that if Appellant said what the girlfriend reported, it\n\nwould be inappropriate and the girlfriend would have a legitimate reason to complain).\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f                                            B.\n\n                                     Civil Conspiracy\n\n       “To establish a conspiracy claim under § 1983, a plaintiff ‘must present evidence\n\nthat the [defendants] acted jointly in concert and that some overt act was done in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy which resulted in [the] deprivation of a constitutional\n\nright.’” Massey v.

Because Appellant’s “evidence amounts to nothing more than rank\n\nspeculation and conjecture[,]” we agree with the district court. Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 422.\n\n       This court has “recognize[d] that direct evidence of a conspiracy is not always\n\navailable” but the court “cannot use this fact as an excuse to forgive Appellant[’s] failure\n\n                                            20\n\fto prove [his] case.” Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 423.

If anything, this evidence evinces\n\nnothing more than misconduct on Gouge’s part.          The link to any animus is pure\n\nspeculation.

Although Appellant has presented circumstantial\n\nevidence that Gillespie communicated his disdain for Appellant to Martín, there is no\n\nevidence beyond conjecture that the two ever had a mutual understanding to retaliate\n\nagainst Appellant for his protected speech. There is no specific circumstantial evidence\n\n                                           24\n\fconnecting Gillespie’s animus to Martín’s action weighty enough to create a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to these two defendants.\n\n                                             4.\n\n                                   Conspiracy Evidence\n\n       Appellant has not met his burden to come forward with “specific circumstantial\n\nevidence that each member of the alleged conspiracy shared the same conspiratorial\n\nobjective.” Hinkle, 81 F.3d at 421. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting\n\nsummary judgment on the Appellant’s civil conspiracy claim.\n\n                                             C.\n\n                                North Carolina Constitution\n\n       In his Amended Complaint, Appellant asserts an alternative claim for retaliation\n\nbased on the exercise of his rights under Sections 12 and 14 of Article I of the North\n\nCarolina constitution.    Appellant brought this claim against Gouge, Martín, and\n\nNeighbors in their official capacities, and the Board and Gillespie. The district court\n\ndisposed of these claims for the same reasons it disposed of Appellant’s First\n\nAmendment retaliation claim. We do the same.\n\n       In North Carolina, “[t]he standards for free speech retaliation claims under the\n\nstate constitution are the same as those for free speech claims under the federal\n\nconstitution.” Sheaffer v.

This is undisputed. But,\n\nAppellant has not produced evidence sufficient to support a finding that, in light of these\n\nfacts and circumstances known to Martín, it was unreasonable to commence a\n\nprosecution.   To show unreasonableness, Appellant relies on Gouge’s preliminary\n\ndetermination that a letter of reprimand was the appropriate disciplinary action for\n\nAppellant’s inappropriate comment. Appellant compares Martín’s Notice to Gouge’s\n\nletter of reprimand.     The difference in severity of discipline, Appellant argues,\n\ndemonstrates that the facts would not induce a reasonable person to commence a\n\nprosecution.    However, the letter of reprimand does not reflect the totality of\n\ncircumstances justifying Martín’s later decision to prosecute.       Martín recommended\n\n                                            28\n\fAppellant’s termination based on all of Appellant’s inappropriate behavior as a\n\n“conglomeration of the whole thing” and not “one isolated event.” J.A. 741:25–742:1,\n\n743:5–6. She stated, “One event led to an investigation and that revealed multiple\n\noffenses.” Id. at 743:6–8. Gouge’s letter of reprimand was drafted in response to the\n\noffending comment on April 17, 2013.                Moreover, Appellant arguably concedes\n\nreasonableness by stating that he “hope[d]” the administration would “take some sort of\n\naction, at least an investigation” in response to a complaint by a student of inappropriate\n\nconduct. Id. at 395:21–396:8.\n\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellant, Appellant cannot\n\nshow that the grounds stated in the Notice, as facts and circumstances known to Martín at\n\nthe time she initiated the proceedings, would not induce a reasonable person to\n\ncommence a prosecution. Therefore, summary judgment was proper on these grounds.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       In light of the foregoing, the decision of the district court is\n\n                                                                             AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\fWILKINSON, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n       I am pleased to concur in Judge Thacker’s fine opinion. This case presents a\n\nschool system personnel problem of the sort that occurs in hundreds, if not thousands, of\n\nschool systems across the country every day. Here the plaintiff, a teacher, allegedly\n\nsingled out two students’ sexual proclivities in front of their entire AP Government class,\n\ndriving the young woman involved to tears and the woman’s mother to complain to\n\nschool administrators.\n\n       Of course school administrators looked into it. It would have been a dereliction of\n\nduty not to do so. Their investigation revealed further inappropriate statements the\n\nteacher made to a student on Facebook, speculating about the student’s possible\n\nmembership in the North American Man-Boy Love Association. Whether all this conduct\n\nmerited a reprimand, suspension, or termination was well within the administrators’\n\ndiscretion. For their efforts, they were hit with this litigation, which has been going on for\n\nover three years and in which the joint appendix alone has swelled to over 1200 pages.\n\n       I am unable to detect the slightest scintilla of educational benefit from all the\n\nchurning in this lawsuit. In fact, it has drained the time of educators and the resources of\n\na school district already burdened, as most districts are, with the steep compliance costs\n\nof federal regulation. Far be it from me to entertain the quaint notion that the efforts of\n\neducators should be spent on education, but that was assuredly not where this lawsuit\n\ndirected them.\n\n       I do not think any section 1983 suit should evince such a profound lack of faith in\n\nthe ability of local school systems to address their own personnel issues. There are\n\n                                             30\n\fteachers, parents, principals, superintendents, school boards, and state courts and\n\nlegislatures all engaged in that task. By and large, they do a fine job and draw upon\n\ncommunity input, not just courtroom arguments.\n\n      Education has long been a matter of paramount state and local concern. While\n\nfederal authority has sometimes played a crucial role, school systems have come a long\n\nway since the unlawful and immoral practice of racial segregation left federal courts with\n\nno choice but to intervene. It is high time that the federal-state balance in this area be\n\nrestored, and that litigation be viewed through the prism of the progress states have made\n\nand their rightful role in our constitutional structure. Federal judges otherwise risk\n\nbecoming unnecessary chefs in an overcrowded kitchen without the educational\n\nunderstanding or the community involvement required to achieve a palatable outcome.\n\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\f</pre>",
