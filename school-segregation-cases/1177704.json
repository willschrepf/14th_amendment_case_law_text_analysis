Gen.\n\f                                                 -2-\nStat. § 150B-51. University officials did not misuse their power\n\nto retaliate against petitioner.\n\n                            I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n    John         Donnelly,             Jr.    (petitioner)      graduated      from    the\n\nUniversity of North Carolina (UNC) in 1970 and has always been a\n\ndedicated        fan        of     the       school’s    sports     teams.     Petitioner\n\nfrequently attended UNC athletic events and volunteered as an\n\nusher for the 2006 football season. From 2006 until December\n\n2012,     in      a     series           of     incidents,     petitioner       displayed\n\ninappropriate          behavior         toward    several    UNC    athletes   and    staff\n\nmembers     of        the        UNC     Athletics      Department.      Petitioner    was\n\nreprimanded for his behavior several times prior to UNC imposing\n\nupon him a lifetime ban from UNC athletic events. This appeal\n\narises from petitioner’s appeal of this ban.\n\n    Petitioner made sexually suggestive comments to female UNC\n\nAthletics staff members, traveled to UNC women’s soccer matches\n\nand appeared at the hotel where the players were staying and\n\nharassed the players, and alienated fans by openly criticizing\n\nplayers in front of their family members during the game while\n\nserving     as    an        usher       and    representative       of   UNC   Athletics.\n\nPetitioner       also       harassed         staff   members   by   repeatedly    calling\n\nvarious UNC Athletics offices up to 13 times per day.\n\f                                                    -3-\n      The    events         that    led       to    the        lifetime       ban    arise        from    an\n\nincident that occurred in December 2012 at the Women’s Soccer\n\nCollege Cup tournament in San Diego. Petitioner had previously\n\nattempted to communicate with several female soccer players both\n\nin    person    and         via     Facebook.             At     the        Soccer        College       Cup,\n\npetitioner     found         out       which       hotel        the    players        were        staying,\n\nallegedly      “because           he     won       an     autographed           soccer        ball       and\n\ncouldn’t     locate         the        head     coach’s          signature           on     the     ball.”\n\nPetitioner claims that he wanted to find the head coach so he\n\ncould    locate       his    signature             on   the      ball.       The     parents       of    the\n\nplayers felt uncomfortable with petitioner’s uninvited presence\n\nat    the    hotel,         especially             given        his     previous          attempts        to\n\ncommunicate with several female players. Petitioner was asked to\n\nleave, and did so.\n\n      As a result of petitioner’s persistent harassment of UNC\n\nAthletics      staff          members           and        athletes,           and         history        of\n\ninappropriate behavior at athletic events, on 3 December 2012,\n\nUNC   issued      a    Notice          of     Trespass          to    petitioner.           The     Notice\n\nprohibited petitioner from entering any area of UNC Athletic\n\nFacilities at any time in the future. The Notice was sent to\n\npetitioner     via      certified             mail.       One        week    later,        George       Hare\n\n(Hare), Deputy Chief of the UNC Department of Public Safety,\n\ncalled      petitioner,            explained            the     Notice        of      Trespass,          and\n\f                                          -4-\ndiscussed   the    parameters      of     the    restriction    with   petitioner.\n\nPetitioner was informed of his right to appeal, and he exercised\n\nthat right.\n\n    On 7 March 2013, Hare issued a Final University Decision\n\ndenying petitioner’s appeal of the Notice                   of Trespass.         On 4\n\nApril 2013,      petitioner     filed a Petition for Review of Final\n\nAgency   Decision,      seeking    judicial       review   of   the    University’s\n\ndecision in the Superior Court of Iredell County. On 4 November\n\n2013,    Judge    Lee   found     that,    “no    substantial    rights     of    the\n\npetitioner have been prejudiced and that the final decision of\n\nthe University should be affirmed.”\n\n    Petitioner appeals.\n\n                         II. First Amendment Rights\n\n    In his first argument, petitioner contends that the trial\n\ncourt erred in affirming UNC’s indefinite ban from all athletic\n\nfacilities because UNC violated his First Amendment rights. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n                           A.

It may also reverse or\n            modify the decision if the substantial\n            rights of the petitioners may have been\n            prejudiced because the findings, inferences,\n            conclusions, or decisions are:\n                 (1) In    violation   of  constitutional\n                 provisions;\n                 (2) In     excess   of   the   statutory\n\f                                       -5-\n                  authority or jurisdiction of the agency\n                  or administrative law judge;\n                  (3) Made upon unlawful procedure;\n                  (4) Affected by other error of law;\n                  (5) Unsupported by substantial evidence\n                  admissible under G.S. 150B-29(a), 150B-\n                  30, or 150B-31 in view of the entire\n                  record as submitted; or\n                  (6) Arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse\n                  of discretion.\n             (c) In reviewing a final decision in a\n             contested case, the court shall determine\n             whether the petitioner is entitled to the\n             relief sought in the petition based upon its\n             review of the final decision and the\n             official record. With regard to asserted\n             errors pursuant to subdivisions (1) through\n             (4) of subsection (b) of this section, the\n             court shall conduct its review of the final\n             decision using the de novo standard of\n             review. With regard to asserted errors\n             pursuant to subdivisions (5) and (6) of\n             subsection (b) of this section, the court\n             shall conduct its review of the final\n             decision using the whole record standard of\n             review.\n\nN.C.

Stat. § 150B-51 (2013).\n\n       “Under a de novo review, the superior court ‘consider[s]\n\nthe matter anew[] and freely substitut[es] its own judgment for\n\nthe    agency's   judgment.’”     Mann   Media,   Inc.     v.   Randolph    Cnty.\n\nPlanning Bd., 356 N.C. 1, 13, 565 S.E.2d 9, 17 (2002) (quoting\n\nSutton v. N.C. Dep’t of Labor, 132 N.C.

Analysis\n\n       “The first inquiry a court must undertake when a First\n\nAmendment claim is asserted is whether the plaintiff has engaged\n\nin ‘protected speech’.” Goulart v. Meadows, 345 F.3d 239, 246\n\n(4th Cir. 2003) (citing Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ.\n\nFund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 797, 87 L.Ed.2d 567, 576 (1985)).\n\nWhile it is well-recognized that the First Amendment protects\n\nmore than spoken or written word, the                  United States    Supreme\n\nCourt    has    rejected    “the    view   that   an    apparently    limitless\n\nvariety of conduct can be labeled ‘speech’ whenever the person\n\nengaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.”\n\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 105 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1989)\n\n(quoting United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 20 L.Ed.2d\n\n672 (1968)). “In deciding whether particular conduct possesses\n\nsufficient communicative elements to bring the First Amendment\n\ninto    play,   we   have   asked    whether   “[a]n    intent   to   convey   a\n\nparticularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood\n\nwas great that the message would be understood by those who\n\nviewed it.” Id. (quoting Spence v. State of Wash., 418 U.S. 405,\n\n410-11, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)).\n\f                                      -7-\n     The     United    States     Supreme     Court   has     recognized       that\n\nstudents wearing black armbands to protest military involvement\n\nin Vietnam, sit-ins to protest segregation, and picketing about\n\na wide variety of causes are behaviors that are protected by the\n\nFirst Amendment. Id. (citing Tinker v. Des Moines Independent\n\nCommunity    School    Dist.,   393    U.S.    503,   505,    21     L.Ed.2d    731\n\n(1969); Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 141–42, 15 L.Ed.2d 637\n\n(1966); United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 176, 75 L.Ed.2d\n\n736 (1983)).\n\n     The Fourth Circuit held that harassment is not protected\n\nspeech. Thorne v. Bailey, 846 F.2d 241, 243 (4th Cir. 1988)\n\n(holding that a West Virginia statute prohibiting use of the\n\ntelephone to harass others did not violate the First Amendment,\n\nas   the    statute    required     specific     intent      to    harass,     thus\n\nindicating that the legislature sought to criminalize conduct\n\nrather than speech by protecting citizens from harassment in an\n\nevenhanded and neutral fashion).\n\n     We hold that petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he\n\nengaged     in   any   speech     protected     by    the    First    Amendment.\n\nPetitioner harassed athletes, the family members of athletes,\n\nathletic staff members, and fans. This behavior is not protected\n\nby   the    First      Amendment.     Therefore,      we     do    not   address\n\f                                     -8-\npetitioner’s argument that UNC athletic facilities are a public\n\nforum.\n\n    This argument is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n            III. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150B-51 Violations\n\n    In his second argument, petitioner contends that the trial\n\ncourt erred in affirming UNC’s indefinite ban from all athletic\n\nfacilities because UNC’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, and\n\nunsupported by substantial evidence, in violation of N.C. Gen.\n\nStat. § 150B-51. We disagree.\n\n                          A. Standard of Review\n\n    As   described   in    Section    II   A,   above,   the   appropriate\n\nstandard of review for this argument is the whole record test.\n\n    “When   utilizing      the    whole    record   test,   however,   the\n\nreviewing court must examine all competent evidence (the “whole\n\nrecord”) in order to determine whether the agency decision is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.” Mann Media, Inc. v. Randolph\n\nCnty. Planning Bd., 356 N.C. 1, 14, 565 S.E.2d 9, 17 (2002)\n\n(quoting ACT-UP Triangle v. Comm’n for Health Servs., 345 N.C.\n\n699, 706, 483 S.E.2d 388, 392 (1997) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n                                 B. Analysis\n\f                                          -9-\n     An administrative ruling is deemed arbitrary and capricious\n\nwhen it is “whimsical, willful[,] and [an] unreasonable action\n\nwithout consideration or in disregard of facts or law or without\n\ndetermining principle.” Ward v. Inscoe, 166 N.C. App. 586, 595,\n\n603 S.E.2d 393, 399 (2004) (quoting Lenoir Mem. Hosp. v. N.C.\n\nDep’t of Human Res., 98 N.C. App. 178, 181, 309 S.E.2d 448, 450\n\n(1990)). When a court applies the whole record test, it must\n\ndetermine whether there is substantial evidence to justify the\n\nagency’s decision. In re Lustgarten, 177 N.C. App. 663, 670, 629\n\nS.E.2d   886,    890-91      (2006).   Substantial      evidence     is    “relevant\n\nevidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n\nconclusion.”     Id.\n\n     UNC’s      decision       to   ban    petitioner       from     all   athletic\n\nfacilities indefinitely was not arbitrary, capricious, nor was\n\nit   unsupported       by    substantial        evidence.   A   decision     by   an\n\nadministrative agency is arbitrary and capricious if it clearly\n\nlacked fair and careful consideration. Bio-Med. Applications of\n\nN. Carolina, Inc. v. N. Carolina Dep't of Human Res., Div. of\n\nFacility Servs., Certificate of Need Section, 136 N.C. App. 103,\n\n111, 523 S.E.2d 677, 682 (1999).\n\n     UNC’s decision was based on a series of incidents over a\n\nnumber   of     years       where   petitioner      engaged     in   inappropriate\n\nbehavior toward UNC athletes, the family members of athletes,\n\f                                     -10-\nathletic staff members, and fans. This was not the first time\n\nthat petitioner was reprimanded for this type of behavior. The\n\nFinal University Decision summarizes a long series of events\n\nwhich led to the indefinite ban. It is clear that UNC’s decision\n\nwas   not   an    “unreasonable    action    without   consideration   or   in\n\ndisregard    of    facts,”   nor    did     the   decision   lack   “relevant\n\nevidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n\nconclusion.”\n\n      Petitioner also argues that UNC violated N.C. Gen. Stat. §\n\n150B-51 because UNC officials did not follow the procedure set\n\nforth in the Department of Public Safety’s General Order on\n\ntrespass warnings. The General Order states that:\n\n            I. Trespass Warning\n\n            A. After determining that a person has no\n            legitimate business or education purpose in\n            a University facility or on University\n            property, a formal “Notice of Trespass,”\n            which is valid indefinitely, may be issued.\n            The Notice should be precise enough to\n            alleviate any question as to the specific\n            restrictions being imposed.\n\n            B. The information contained in the “Notice\n            of Trespass” should be read to the offender.\n            Any questions from the offender should be\n            answered if possible. Issuance of the notice\n            should be witnessed by another officer. The\n            notice should be signed by the violator or\n            “Refused” should be written by the officer\n            if the violator doesn’t cooperate.\n\n            II. Right of Appeal\n\f                                          -11-\n            The offender should be informed of his/her\n            right of appeal.\n\n    UNC     determined         petitioner     had   no   legitimate      business    or\n\neducational purpose on university property due to his pattern of\n\ninappropriate      behavior       and    issued     a   Notice   of    Trespass    that\n\nclearly     stated       the     restrictions       imposed.       The    information\n\ncontained    in    the      Notice      was   discussed     with      petitioner    via\n\ntelephone    and     sent      via   certified      mail.   Petitioner      was    also\n\ninformed of his right to appeal.\n\n    Petitioner argues that because four lines on the Notice of\n\nTrespass were left blank (date, time, witness name, and witness\n\nsignature), UNC officials did not follow proper procedure. This\n\nCourt has stated that:\n\n            In determining the mandatory or directory\n            nature of a statute, the importance of the\n            provision   involved   may   be   taken    into\n            consideration.   Generally   speaking,    those\n            provisions which are a mere matter of form,\n            or which are not material, do not affect any\n            substantial right, and do not relate to the\n            essence of the thing to be done so that\n            compliance is a matter of convenience rather\n            than   substance,   are   considered    to   be\n            directory.\n\nState v. Inman, 174 N.C. App. 567, 570, 621 S.E.2d 306, 309\n\n(2005) (quoting State v. House, 295 N.C. 189, 203, 244 S.E.2d\n\n654, 661–62 (1978)).\n\n    Petitioner’s argument is based on provisions of the General\n\nOrder that are a mere matter of form, are not material, and do\n\f                                             -12-\nnot affect any substantial right. The procedure set forth in the\n\nGeneral Order is based on the assumption that there will be\n\nimmediate, on-site removal of trespassers. In the instant case,\n\nthe   events      leading    up    to    a    Notice     of    Trespass         being   issued\n\nagainst petitioner occurred off-site, at a soccer tournament in\n\nCalifornia. UNC made minor, but necessary, changes to its normal\n\nprocedure to accommodate the nature of this particular incident.\n\nNonetheless, UNC substantially complied with the goals of the\n\nGeneral Order. The goals of the General Order are to inform the\n\ntrespasser of the restrictions imposed upon him and inform him\n\nof his right to appeal. Both of these goals were met.\n\n      Any    procedural          error       committed        by    UNC    officials      was\n\ntherefore harmless and immaterial.\n\n      This argument is without merit.\n\n                                 IV. Retaliation Claim\n\n      In    his    third    argument,          petitioner          contends      that    UNC’s\n\nindefinite     ban    was    an    abuse      of     discretion        because     officials\n\nmisused     their     power        to    retaliate         against        petitioner.       We\n\ndisagree.\n\n                                 A. Standard of Review\n\n      As    described       in    Section       II    A,      above,      the    appropriate\n\nstandard of review for this argument is the whole record test.\n\f                                      -13-\n      “When   utilizing      the    whole     record   test,   however,   the\n\nreviewing court must examine all competent evidence (the “whole\n\nrecord”) in order to determine whether the agency decision is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.” Mann Media, Inc. v. Randolph\n\nCnty. Planning Bd., 356 N.C. 1, 14, 565 S.E.2d 9, 17 (2002)\n\n(quoting ACT-UP Triangle v. Comm’n for Health Servs., 345 N.C.\n\n699, 706, 483 S.E.2d 388, 392 (1997) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n                                   B. Analysis\n\n      Petitioner   argues that the case of             Trulock v. Freeh     is\n\napplicable to the instant case. Trulock v. Freeh is a Fourth\n\nCircuit case involving a former Department of Energy official\n\nwho   wrote   a   magazine    article       charging   the   government   with\n\nincompetence for their handling of alleged security breaches at\n\nweapons laboratories. Trulock v. Freeh, 275 F.3d 391, 397 (4th\n\nCir. 2001). In that case, the court held that because “The First\n\nAmendment guarantees an individual the right to speak freely,\n\nincluding the right to criticize the government and government\n\nofficials,” public officials are “prohibited from retaliating\n\nagainst individuals who criticize them.” Id. at 404.\n\n      The issues in the instant case do not parallel the issues\n\nin the case petitioner cites for this argument. The instant case\n\f                                     -14-\ndoes    not    involve    the   criticism   of    governmental    officials.\n\nTherefore, Trulock v. Freeh is not controlling, nor do we find\n\nit to be persuasive authority.\n\n       This argument is without merit.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n       Judge GEER concurs.\n\n       Judge    HUNTER,     Robert    N.,   Jr.     concurs      in   result.\n\f                                     NO.

Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447, 456\n\n(1978)).\n\n       The    majority      opinion      cites     the     O’Brien     test,         which\n\nrecognized that in some cases there is not a clear distinction\n\nbetween      speech   and     conduct.         O’Brien     concerned       a   man    who\n\nintentionally and illegally burned his draft card, but did so as\n\na form of protest against the draft.                    391 U.S. at 369–70.           The\n\nCourt explained that “when ‘speech’ and ‘nonspeech’ elements are\n\ncombined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important\n\ngovernmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can\n\njustify      incidental     limitations     on    First        Amendment   freedoms.”\n\nId. at 376 (emphasis added).               The United States Supreme Court\n\nthen    articulated       a    four-prong        test     to     determine     whether\n\ngovernment regulation of a course of conduct involving speech is\n\nconstitutional:\n\n              [1] a government regulation is sufficiently\n              justified if it is within the constitutional\n              power of the Government; [2] if it furthers\n              an important or substantial governmental\n              interest; [3] if the governmental interest\n              is unrelated to the suppression of free\n              expression;   and  [4]   if  the  incidental\n              restriction   on  alleged   First  Amendment\n              freedoms is no greater than is essential to\n              the furtherance of that interest.\n\nId. at 377.\n\n       Here, it is essential to explain why Donnelly’s actions\n\f                                         -4-\nshould be considered conduct and not speech, thus bringing his\n\nactions under the O’Brien standard.                 This case provides a prime\n\nexample of the gray area between speech and conduct and thus\n\napplication     of     all     four    O’Brien      factors     is        appropriate.\n\nAlthough some of Donnelly’s individual actions, such as sending\n\nan e-mail or making a phone call may be classified as speech,\n\nDonnelly’s      repeated        calls,     suggestive         and        inappropriate\n\ncomments, and other actions combine to become harassing conduct.\n\nTaken    together,     Donnelly’s       actions     constitute       a    “course      of\n\nconduct,” and O’Brien applies.\n\n       The power of UNC officials to regulate harassment on campus\n\nsatisfies the first two prongs of the O’Brien test as it is (i)\n\nwithin the power and (ii) in the interest of UNC administrators\n\nto    provide   a    safe    environment    for     students.        While      UNC    is\n\npreventing Donnelly from engaging in his free speech rights at\n\nfuture UNC athletic events, record evidence shows that (iii) UNC\n\nis    seeking   to    protect    its     students     and    employees       from     his\n\nharassing    and     inappropriate       behavior    instead    of       intending     to\n\nquash Donnelly’s right to speak freely.                     Under the fourth and\n\nfinal prong, (iv) the restriction placed on Donnelly is not\n\ngreater than is essential to promote UNC’s legitimate interest.\n\nThe    University     previously       disciplined     Donnelly       to    a   lesser\n\f                                        -5-\nextent   and     notified    him   of      the   inappropriateness        of   his\n\nbehavior,      but   these   measures         failed     to   stop   Defendant’s\n\nharassing   behavior.        For   these      reasons,    the   actions   of   UNC\n\nadministrators against Donnelly satisfy all four criteria of the\n\nO’Brien test and Donnelly’s behavior is not protected by the\n\nFirst Amendment.\n\f",

Factual and Procedural Background\n\n    John         Donnelly,             Jr.    (petitioner)      graduated      from    the\n\nUniversity of North Carolina (UNC) in 1970 and has always been a\n\ndedicated        fan        of     the       school’s    sports     teams.     Petitioner\n\nfrequently attended UNC athletic events and volunteered as an\n\nusher for the 2006 football season. From 2006 until December\n\n2012,     in      a     series           of     incidents,     petitioner       displayed\n\ninappropriate          behavior         toward    several    UNC    athletes   and    staff\n\nmembers     of        the        UNC     Athletics      Department.      Petitioner    was\n\nreprimanded for his behavior several times prior to UNC imposing\n\nupon him a lifetime ban from UNC athletic events. This appeal\n\narises from petitioner’s appeal of this ban.\n\n    Petitioner made sexually suggestive comments to female UNC\n\nAthletics staff members, traveled to UNC women’s soccer matches\n\nand appeared at the hotel where the players were staying and\n\nharassed the players, and alienated fans by openly criticizing\n\nplayers in front of their family members during the game while\n\nserving     as    an        usher       and    representative       of   UNC   Athletics.\n\nPetitioner       also       harassed         staff   members   by   repeatedly    calling\n\nvarious UNC Athletics offices up to 13 times per day.\n\f                                                    -3-\n      The    events         that    led       to    the        lifetime       ban    arise        from    an\n\nincident that occurred in December 2012 at the Women’s Soccer\n\nCollege Cup tournament in San Diego. Petitioner had previously\n\nattempted to communicate with several female soccer players both\n\nin    person    and         via     Facebook.             At     the        Soccer        College       Cup,\n\npetitioner     found         out       which       hotel        the    players        were        staying,\n\nallegedly      “because           he     won       an     autographed           soccer        ball       and\n\ncouldn’t     locate         the        head     coach’s          signature           on     the     ball.”\n\nPetitioner claims that he wanted to find the head coach so he\n\ncould    locate       his    signature             on   the      ball.       The     parents       of    the\n\nplayers felt uncomfortable with petitioner’s uninvited presence\n\nat    the    hotel,         especially             given        his     previous          attempts        to\n\ncommunicate with several female players. Petitioner was asked to\n\nleave, and did so.\n\n      As a result of petitioner’s persistent harassment of UNC\n\nAthletics      staff          members           and        athletes,           and         history        of\n\ninappropriate behavior at athletic events, on 3 December 2012,\n\nUNC   issued      a    Notice          of     Trespass          to    petitioner.           The     Notice\n\nprohibited petitioner from entering any area of UNC Athletic\n\nFacilities at any time in the future. The Notice was sent to\n\npetitioner     via      certified             mail.       One        week    later,        George       Hare\n\n(Hare), Deputy Chief of the UNC Department of Public Safety,\n\ncalled      petitioner,            explained            the     Notice        of      Trespass,          and\n\f                                          -4-\ndiscussed   the    parameters      of     the    restriction    with   petitioner.\n\nPetitioner was informed of his right to appeal, and he exercised\n\nthat right.\n\n    On 7 March 2013, Hare issued a Final University Decision\n\ndenying petitioner’s appeal of the Notice                   of Trespass.         On 4\n\nApril 2013,      petitioner     filed a Petition for Review of Final\n\nAgency   Decision,      seeking    judicial       review   of   the    University’s\n\ndecision in the Superior Court of Iredell County. On 4 November\n\n2013,    Judge    Lee   found     that,    “no    substantial    rights     of    the\n\npetitioner have been prejudiced and that the final decision of\n\nthe University should be affirmed.”\n\n    Petitioner appeals.\n\n                         II.

This was not the first time\n\nthat petitioner was reprimanded for this type of behavior. The\n\nFinal University Decision summarizes a long series of events\n\nwhich led to the indefinite ban. It is clear that UNC’s decision\n\nwas   not   an    “unreasonable    action    without   consideration   or   in\n\ndisregard    of    facts,”   nor    did     the   decision   lack   “relevant\n\nevidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n\nconclusion.”\n\n      Petitioner also argues that UNC violated N.C. Gen. Stat. §\n\n150B-51 because UNC officials did not follow the procedure set\n\nforth in the Department of Public Safety’s General Order on\n\ntrespass warnings. The General Order states that:\n\n            I. Trespass Warning\n\n            A. After determining that a person has no\n            legitimate business or education purpose in\n            a University facility or on University\n            property, a formal “Notice of Trespass,”\n            which is valid indefinitely, may be issued.\n            The Notice should be precise enough to\n            alleviate any question as to the specific\n            restrictions being imposed.\n\n            B. The information contained in the “Notice\n            of Trespass” should be read to the offender.\n            Any questions from the offender should be\n            answered if possible. Issuance of the notice\n            should be witnessed by another officer. The\n            notice should be signed by the violator or\n            “Refused” should be written by the officer\n            if the violator doesn’t cooperate.\n\n            II.

The    information\n\ncontained    in    the      Notice      was   discussed     with      petitioner    via\n\ntelephone    and     sent      via   certified      mail.   Petitioner      was    also\n\ninformed of his right to appeal.\n\n    Petitioner argues that because four lines on the Notice of\n\nTrespass were left blank (date, time, witness name, and witness\n\nsignature), UNC officials did not follow proper procedure. This\n\nCourt has stated that:\n\n            In determining the mandatory or directory\n            nature of a statute, the importance of the\n            provision   involved   may   be   taken    into\n            consideration.   Generally   speaking,    those\n            provisions which are a mere matter of form,\n            or which are not material, do not affect any\n            substantial right, and do not relate to the\n            essence of the thing to be done so that\n            compliance is a matter of convenience rather\n            than   substance,   are   considered    to   be\n            directory.\n\nState v.

The procedure set forth in the\n\nGeneral Order is based on the assumption that there will be\n\nimmediate, on-site removal of trespassers. In the instant case,\n\nthe   events      leading    up    to    a    Notice     of    Trespass         being   issued\n\nagainst petitioner occurred off-site, at a soccer tournament in\n\nCalifornia. UNC made minor, but necessary, changes to its normal\n\nprocedure to accommodate the nature of this particular incident.\n\nNonetheless, UNC substantially complied with the goals of the\n\nGeneral Order. The goals of the General Order are to inform the\n\ntrespasser of the restrictions imposed upon him and inform him\n\nof his right to appeal. Both of these goals were met.\n\n      Any    procedural          error       committed        by    UNC    officials      was\n\ntherefore harmless and immaterial.\n\n      This argument is without merit.\n\n                                 IV. Retaliation Claim\n\n      In    his    third    argument,          petitioner          contends      that    UNC’s\n\nindefinite     ban    was    an    abuse      of     discretion        because     officials\n\nmisused     their     power        to    retaliate         against        petitioner.       We\n\ndisagree.\n\n                                 A. Standard of Review\n\n      As    described       in    Section       II    A,      above,      the    appropriate\n\nstandard of review for this argument is the whole record test.\n\f                                      -13-\n      “When   utilizing      the    whole     record   test,   however,   the\n\nreviewing court must examine all competent evidence (the “whole\n\nrecord”) in order to determine whether the agency decision is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.” Mann Media, Inc. v.

Analysis\n\n      Petitioner   argues that the case of             Trulock v. Freeh     is\n\napplicable to the instant case. Trulock v. Freeh is a Fourth\n\nCircuit case involving a former Department of Energy official\n\nwho   wrote   a   magazine    article       charging   the   government   with\n\nincompetence for their handling of alleged security breaches at\n\nweapons laboratories.

In that case, the court held that because “The First\n\nAmendment guarantees an individual the right to speak freely,\n\nincluding the right to criticize the government and government\n\nofficials,” public officials are “prohibited from retaliating\n\nagainst individuals who criticize them.” Id. at 404.\n\n      The issues in the instant case do not parallel the issues\n\nin the case petitioner cites for this argument. The instant case\n\f                                     -14-\ndoes    not    involve    the   criticism   of    governmental    officials.\n\nTherefore, Trulock v. Freeh is not controlling, nor do we find\n\nit to be persuasive authority.\n\n       This argument is without merit.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n       Judge GEER concurs.\n\n       Judge    HUNTER,     Robert    N.,   Jr.     concurs      in   result.\n\f                                     NO.

O’Brien     concerned       a   man    who\n\nintentionally and illegally burned his draft card, but did so as\n\na form of protest against the draft.                    391 U.S. at 369–70.           The\n\nCourt explained that “when ‘speech’ and ‘nonspeech’ elements are\n\ncombined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important\n\ngovernmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can\n\njustify      incidental     limitations     on    First        Amendment   freedoms.”\n\nId. at 376 (emphasis added).               The United States Supreme Court\n\nthen    articulated       a    four-prong        test     to     determine     whether\n\ngovernment regulation of a course of conduct involving speech is\n\nconstitutional:\n\n              [1] a government regulation is sufficiently\n              justified if it is within the constitutional\n              power of the Government; [2] if it furthers\n              an important or substantial governmental\n              interest; [3] if the governmental interest\n              is unrelated to the suppression of free\n              expression;   and  [4]   if  the  incidental\n              restriction   on  alleged   First  Amendment\n              freedoms is no greater than is essential to\n              the furtherance of that interest.\n\nId. at 377.\n\n       Here, it is essential to explain why Donnelly’s actions\n\f                                         -4-\nshould be considered conduct and not speech, thus bringing his\n\nactions under the O’Brien standard.                 This case provides a prime\n\nexample of the gray area between speech and conduct and thus\n\napplication     of     all     four    O’Brien      factors     is        appropriate.\n\nAlthough some of Donnelly’s individual actions, such as sending\n\nan e-mail or making a phone call may be classified as speech,\n\nDonnelly’s      repeated        calls,     suggestive         and        inappropriate\n\ncomments, and other actions combine to become harassing conduct.\n\nTaken    together,     Donnelly’s       actions     constitute       a    “course      of\n\nconduct,” and O’Brien applies.\n\n       The power of UNC officials to regulate harassment on campus\n\nsatisfies the first two prongs of the O’Brien test as it is (i)\n\nwithin the power and (ii) in the interest of UNC administrators\n\nto    provide   a    safe    environment    for     students.        While      UNC    is\n\npreventing Donnelly from engaging in his free speech rights at\n\nfuture UNC athletic events, record evidence shows that (iii) UNC\n\nis    seeking   to    protect    its     students     and    employees       from     his\n\nharassing    and     inappropriate       behavior    instead    of       intending     to\n\nquash Donnelly’s right to speak freely.                     Under the fourth and\n\nfinal prong, (iv) the restriction placed on Donnelly is not\n\ngreater than is essential to promote UNC’s legitimate interest.\n\nThe    University     previously       disciplined     Donnelly       to    a   lesser\n\f                                        -5-\nextent   and     notified    him   of      the   inappropriateness        of   his\n\nbehavior,      but   these   measures         failed     to   stop   Defendant’s\n\nharassing   behavior.        For   these      reasons,    the   actions   of   UNC\n\nadministrators against Donnelly satisfy all four criteria of the\n\nO’Brien test and Donnelly’s behavior is not protected by the\n\nFirst Amendment.\n\f</pre>",
