Petitioners Michael Wilson, Lucius Allen and Eve Allen are the relators in the\nunderlying action. The complaint seeks to impose civil penalties for violation of the\nInsurance Fraud Prevention Act (IFPA), Insurance Code section 1871 et seq., and alleges\nthat BMS employed runners and cappers to induce physicians to prescribe its drugs to\n                1\ntheir patients. The California Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner) intervened in\nthe case pursuant to section 1871.7, subdivision (f), and as a result has “primary\nresponsibility for prosecuting the action.” (Ins. Code, § 1871.7, subd. (f)(1).)\n       On March 30, 2015, respondent court entered orders granting summary judgment\nin favor of real party BMS with respect to petitioner Michael Wilson, and judgment on\nthe pleadings with respect to petitioners Lucius Allen and Eve Allen, and ordered BMS to\nprovide proposed judgments for signature. BMS filed the proposed judgments in the\nsuperior court on April 1, 2015. On May 29, 2015, however, respondent court issued a\nminute order stating that because the State of California remains as a plaintiff, the matter\nwith respect to petitioners is not resolved and, as such, judgment in favor of BMS with\nrespect to petitioners would violate the “one final judgment” rule. Accordingly,\nrespondent court vacated only the portion of the March 30 order that required preparation\nof proposed judgments.\n       Petitioners seek a writ of mandate ordering respondent court to vacate the May 29,\n2015 order, and instead to execute the proposed judgments implementing the court’s\nMarch 30, 2015 orders. This is the sole issue raised by the petition.\n       We conclude that the multiparty exception to the one final judgment rule permits\nthe trial court to execute the proposed judgments. Accordingly, we grant the petition for\nwrit of mandate and order the trial court to vacate its May 29, 2015 order, and instead\nexecute and file the proposed judgments.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           All statutory references refer to the Insurance Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n                                               2\n\f                                     BACKGROUND\n       Wilson, a former BMS sales representative, on behalf of the People of the State of\nCalifornia, filed the underlying qui tam action against BMS on March 16, 2007. The\ncomplaint was later amended, with the consent of the Commissioner, to add the Allens,\nalso former BMS sales representatives, as relators. (State of California ex rel. Michael\nWilson et al., Relators v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Los Angeles Superior Court case\nNo. BC367873.) In March 2011, the Commissioner intervened, and an amended\ncomplaint was filed on March 29, 2011. A third amended complaint was filed in\nNovember 2011.\n       In 2014, this Court granted a petition for writ of mandate by the Commissioner\nand relators, reversing the trial court’s grant of summary adjudication in favor of BMS.\n(State ex rel. Wilson, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 610.) On November 25, 2014, BMS\nbrought a motion for summary judgment on all claims brought by Wilson, but not the\nState, and a motion for judgment on the pleadings on all claims brought by the Allens,\nbut not the State. On March 30, 2015, respondent court granted both motions. As a\nresult, all claims have been resolved with respect to Wilson and the Allens.\n       The sole issue presented in this writ petition is whether, having issued orders\ngranting the motions against Wilson and the Allens and effectively taking them out of the\ncase, the superior court may enter final judgments against Wilson and the Allens. Based\non respondent court’s reasoning in the orders granting the motions, the multiparty\nexception to the one final judgment rule should apply.\n       In BMS’ motion for summary judgment with respect to Wilson, BMS alleged that\nWilson’s claims were barred (a) by the settlement agreement and release that he signed in\na prior federal False Claims Act case (the FCA Case), (b) by section 1871.7, subdivision\n(h)(1) as a result of the prior FCA Case, (c) by the statute of limitations, and (d) by an\nalleged violation by Wilson of the requirement that the complaint and all other\ndocuments be filed under seal. BMS alleged in the motion that Wilson could have\nasserted, but did not, a cause of action pursuant to California’s Insurance Frauds\nPrevention Act (§ 1871 et seq.) in the FCA Case.\n\n                                              3\n\f       BMS also brought a motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the\nAllens, arguing that Allens’ claims were barred by the “first to file” rule set forth in\nsection 1871.7, subdivisions (e)(5) and (h)(1) as a result of the prior FCA action against\nBMS.\n       Both motions were granted on March 30, 2015. The summary judgment motion\nagainst Wilson was granted on the ground that the settlement agreement and release he\nsigned in the FCA Case against BMS barred his claims. The Allens’ claims were\ndetermined to violate the “first to file” rule.\n       In the order granting the motion for summary judgment against Wilson, the\nsuperior court specifically discussed that the State of California’s claims remain, stating\n“the motion for summary judgment is well-taken on the grounds the partial settlement of\nthe Federal FCA bars Relator Wilson’s claim here. The motion is therefore granted. In\ndoing so, the Court wishes to make clear that a grant of summary judgment relates to the\nclaim of Relator Michael Wilson only, in his capacity as Relator in this qui tam action. It\ndoes not dispense with the Insurance Commissioner’s claim in this case (the\nCommissioner has intervened in the litigation.) Nor does an order granting summary\n                                                                                      2\njudgment dispense with the claims of the other Relators, Lucius and Eve Allan.” As an\nalternate ground on which to grant the motion against Wilson, the superior court\nconcluded that section 1871.7, subdivision (h)(1) bars Wilson’s claim because it provides\nthat “in no event may a person bring an action under subdivision (e) that is based upon\nallegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil\nmoney penalty proceeding in which the Attorney General, district attorney, or\ncommissioner is already a party.” The court observed that Wilson’s complaint in the\nFCA Case was filed in September 2006 and this case is “largely based upon the same\ncourse of conduct giving rise to the federal FCA litigation.” Because the FCA Case was\npending when this state IFPA claim was filed, and the State of California was named in\n\n       2\n       The Allens’ claims were dismissed in a separate order granting BMS’ motion for\njudgment on the pleadings.\n\n                                                  4\n\fthe federal FCA complaint (and ultimately entered into a settlement with BMS), the court\nconcluded that summary judgment with respect to Wilson was appropriate pursuant to\nsection 1871.7, subdivision (h)(1).\n       The superior court concluded that Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,\nsubdivision (a) permits “any party” to move for summary judgment “in any action,” and\ndiscloses no exception for qui tam actions. The superior court concluded that BMS is\nentitled to summary judgment with respect to Wilson and judgment on the pleadings with\nrespect to the Allens, independent of the fact that the Commissioner remains in the case.\nThe order granting the motions directed BMS to prepare and file proposed judgments\nwith respect to each of the relators. BMS prepared and filed the proposed judgments on\nApril 1. No objections were filed to the form of judgments.\n       The superior court, however, did not sign or enter the proposed judgments. Two\nmonths later, on May 29, 2015, the superior court entered and served an order stating that\n“because the State of California remains as a Plaintiff in this matter, the ruling as to the\nrelators does not resolve the entire matter.” The May 29 order invokes the “one final\njudgment” rule, and states that “[t]here cannot be more than one separate judgment in\nfavor of Defendant Bristol-Myers. By virtue of the Court’s two separate orders, . . . those\nparties are no longer in the case, but the State of California still remains, so there are\nissues left for future consideration.” As a result of this conclusion, the court vacated that\nportion of the March 30 order that required preparation of the proposed judgments.\n       This petition followed on June 16, 2015. We issued an order to show cause, and\nBMS filed a return on August 26, 2015. Wilson and the Allens filed a reply on\nSeptember 24, 2015.\n       The petition seeks to compel the superior court to sign the proposed judgments\nsubmitted by BMS, enabling Wilson and the Allens to obtain appellate review of the\ndecision granting BMS’ motions.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       The “one final judgment” rule is based in Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1,\nwhich provides that an appeal may be taken “[f]rom a judgment, except (A) an\n\n                                               5\n\finterlocutory judgment . . . .” This is the heart of respondent court’s conclusion that it\ncould not sign the judgments at issue.\n        There is an exception to this rule, however, in cases that involve multiple parties\nand a judgment is entered “which leaves no issue to be determined as to one party.”\n(Justus v. Atchison (1977) 19 Cal.3d 564, 568.) In Justus, two couples brought actions\nfor medical malpractice and wrongful death in connection with the stillbirths of their\nbabies. In addition, each of the husbands brought a separate cause of action “for the\nshock he allegedly experienced in witnessing that death.” (Id. at p. 567.) The superior\ncourt granted the demurrers of defendants without leave to amend, and the plaintiff\nhusbands appealed. Appeal was proper because the judgments, although not resolving\nthe entire complaint, “disposed in each case of all the causes of action in which the\nhusbands are plaintiffs. It is irrelevant that the wives joined with the husbands as\nplaintiffs in one of these causes of action. This circumstance does not affect the reason\nfor the exception, i.e., that it better serves the interests of justice to afford prompt\nappellate review to a party whose rights or liabilities have been definitively adjudicated\nthan to require him to await the final outcome of trial proceedings which are of no further\nconcern to him.” (Id. at p. 568.)\n        The same is true here. Judgments against Wilson and the Allens, although they do\nnot resolve the entire complaint, dispose of all of causes of action with respect to each of\nthem.\n        Utilizing the “standard” rules providing for the summary judgment and judgment\non the pleadings, as BMS did in moving for judgments with respect to the relators but not\nthe State, the “standard” rules for execution of the judgments in favor of BMS, and\npermitting Wilson and the Allens to appeal, should apply as well. While not a qui tam\ncase, similar logic applied in Tinsley v. Palo Alto Unified School Dist. (1979) 91\nCal.App.3d 871, in which parents appealed a judgment sustaining without leave to amend\ndemurrers to their petition seeking to compel the defendant school districts to alleviate\nsegregated schools. Certain defendants argued as a threshold matter that the judgment\nagainst them was not final and not appealable because the state and other parties\n\n                                                6\n\fremained in the case and sought the same relief. The First District discussed that\n“respondents assert that the one final judgment rule must be applied to defeat the appeal\nin this case because the interests of the state, a remaining defendant, and the local\nrespondents in this case are identical both in terms of the legal issues raised and in the\nrelief sought by the petitioners, and, therefore, the judgment in this case cannot be a\ncomplete determination of the matter.” (Id. at p. 880.) Applying logic similar to that in\nthis case, the Tinsley court concluded that “On its face this argument is inherently\ninconsistent with the position successfully advocated by those respondents in the lower\ncourt when they secured the order sustaining their demurrers without leave to amend and\nthe ensuing judgment. If, as now stated, the local districts are mere agencies of the state\nso that any relief directed against the state will by necessity affect them, the trial court\nmay have erred in sustaining the demurrers. On that theory the appeal should not be\ndismissed, but the judgment should be reversed. The premise that there are identical\ninterests does not bear scrutiny. The local districts, as agents, may have limited powers\nin interdistrict affairs, whereas the state, as set forth below, has plenary powers in all\nschool district affairs. . . . The legal issues are not necessarily the same. In any event, if\nthey are, it should be so determined on this appeal and the existing judgments should be\nset aside if a cause of action has been stated against the local districts as agencies of the\nstate.” (Id. at pp. 880–881.)\n       This conclusion applies to this case as well. If Wilson and the Allens have\nseparately cognizable claims such that granting BMS’ motions for summary judgment\nand judgment on the pleadings was appropriate, resolving the case entirely with respect to\neach of them, the multiparty exception to the final judgment rule permits the superior\ncourt to execute the judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n      The petition for a writ of mandate is granted and the May 29, 2015 order of\nrespondent court is hereby vacated. Respondent court is directed to execute and file the\nproposed judgments.\n      Wilson and the Allens are awarded their costs related to this petition.\n\n      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED.\n\n\n                                                CHANEY, J.\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n      ROTHSCHILD, P.

Petitioners Michael Wilson, Lucius Allen and Eve Allen are the relators in the\nunderlying action. The complaint seeks to impose civil penalties for violation of the\nInsurance Fraud Prevention Act (IFPA), Insurance Code section 1871 et seq., and alleges\nthat BMS employed runners and cappers to induce physicians to prescribe its drugs to\n                1\ntheir patients. The California Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner) intervened in\nthe case pursuant to section 1871.7, subdivision (f), and as a result has “primary\nresponsibility for prosecuting the action.” (Ins. Code, § 1871.7, subd. (f)(1).)\n       On March 30, 2015, respondent court entered orders granting summary judgment\nin favor of real party BMS with respect to petitioner Michael Wilson, and judgment on\nthe pleadings with respect to petitioners Lucius Allen and Eve Allen, and ordered BMS to\nprovide proposed judgments for signature. BMS filed the proposed judgments in the\nsuperior court on April 1, 2015. On May 29, 2015, however, respondent court issued a\nminute order stating that because the State of California remains as a plaintiff, the matter\nwith respect to petitioners is not resolved and, as such, judgment in favor of BMS with\nrespect to petitioners would violate the “one final judgment” rule. Accordingly,\nrespondent court vacated only the portion of the March 30 order that required preparation\nof proposed judgments.\n       Petitioners seek a writ of mandate ordering respondent court to vacate the May 29,\n2015 order, and instead to execute the proposed judgments implementing the court’s\nMarch 30, 2015 orders. This is the sole issue raised by the petition.\n       We conclude that the multiparty exception to the one final judgment rule permits\nthe trial court to execute the proposed judgments. Accordingly, we grant the petition for\nwrit of mandate and order the trial court to vacate its May 29, 2015 order, and instead\nexecute and file the proposed judgments.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           All statutory references refer to the Insurance Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n                                               2\n\f                                     BACKGROUND\n       Wilson, a former BMS sales representative, on behalf of the People of the State of\nCalifornia, filed the underlying qui tam action against BMS on March 16, 2007. The\ncomplaint was later amended, with the consent of the Commissioner, to add the Allens,\nalso former BMS sales representatives, as relators. (State of California ex rel. Michael\nWilson et al., Relators v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Los Angeles Superior Court case\nNo. BC367873.) In March 2011, the Commissioner intervened, and an amended\ncomplaint was filed on March 29, 2011. A third amended complaint was filed in\nNovember 2011.\n       In 2014, this Court granted a petition for writ of mandate by the Commissioner\nand relators, reversing the trial court’s grant of summary adjudication in favor of BMS.\n(State ex rel. Wilson, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 610.) On November 25, 2014, BMS\nbrought a motion for summary judgment on all claims brought by Wilson, but not the\nState, and a motion for judgment on the pleadings on all claims brought by the Allens,\nbut not the State. On March 30, 2015, respondent court granted both motions. As a\nresult, all claims have been resolved with respect to Wilson and the Allens.\n       The sole issue presented in this writ petition is whether, having issued orders\ngranting the motions against Wilson and the Allens and effectively taking them out of the\ncase, the superior court may enter final judgments against Wilson and the Allens. Based\non respondent court’s reasoning in the orders granting the motions, the multiparty\nexception to the one final judgment rule should apply.\n       In BMS’ motion for summary judgment with respect to Wilson, BMS alleged that\nWilson’s claims were barred (a) by the settlement agreement and release that he signed in\na prior federal False Claims Act case (the FCA Case), (b) by section 1871.7, subdivision\n(h)(1) as a result of the prior FCA Case, (c) by the statute of limitations, and (d) by an\nalleged violation by Wilson of the requirement that the complaint and all other\ndocuments be filed under seal. BMS alleged in the motion that Wilson could have\nasserted, but did not, a cause of action pursuant to California’s Insurance Frauds\nPrevention Act (§ 1871 et seq.) in the FCA Case.\n\n                                              3\n\f       BMS also brought a motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the\nAllens, arguing that Allens’ claims were barred by the “first to file” rule set forth in\nsection 1871.7, subdivisions (e)(5) and (h)(1) as a result of the prior FCA action against\nBMS.\n       Both motions were granted on March 30, 2015. The summary judgment motion\nagainst Wilson was granted on the ground that the settlement agreement and release he\nsigned in the FCA Case against BMS barred his claims. The Allens’ claims were\ndetermined to violate the “first to file” rule.\n       In the order granting the motion for summary judgment against Wilson, the\nsuperior court specifically discussed that the State of California’s claims remain, stating\n“the motion for summary judgment is well-taken on the grounds the partial settlement of\nthe Federal FCA bars Relator Wilson’s claim here. The motion is therefore granted. In\ndoing so, the Court wishes to make clear that a grant of summary judgment relates to the\nclaim of Relator Michael Wilson only, in his capacity as Relator in this qui tam action. It\ndoes not dispense with the Insurance Commissioner’s claim in this case (the\nCommissioner has intervened in the litigation.) Nor does an order granting summary\n                                                                                      2\njudgment dispense with the claims of the other Relators, Lucius and Eve Allan.” As an\nalternate ground on which to grant the motion against Wilson, the superior court\nconcluded that section 1871.7, subdivision (h)(1) bars Wilson’s claim because it provides\nthat “in no event may a person bring an action under subdivision (e) that is based upon\nallegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil\nmoney penalty proceeding in which the Attorney General, district attorney, or\ncommissioner is already a party.” The court observed that Wilson’s complaint in the\nFCA Case was filed in September 2006 and this case is “largely based upon the same\ncourse of conduct giving rise to the federal FCA litigation.” Because the FCA Case was\npending when this state IFPA claim was filed, and the State of California was named in\n\n       2\n       The Allens’ claims were dismissed in a separate order granting BMS’ motion for\njudgment on the pleadings.\n\n                                                  4\n\fthe federal FCA complaint (and ultimately entered into a settlement with BMS), the court\nconcluded that summary judgment with respect to Wilson was appropriate pursuant to\nsection 1871.7, subdivision (h)(1).\n       The superior court concluded that Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,\nsubdivision (a) permits “any party” to move for summary judgment “in any action,” and\ndiscloses no exception for qui tam actions. The superior court concluded that BMS is\nentitled to summary judgment with respect to Wilson and judgment on the pleadings with\nrespect to the Allens, independent of the fact that the Commissioner remains in the case.\nThe order granting the motions directed BMS to prepare and file proposed judgments\nwith respect to each of the relators. BMS prepared and filed the proposed judgments on\nApril 1. No objections were filed to the form of judgments.\n       The superior court, however, did not sign or enter the proposed judgments. Two\nmonths later, on May 29, 2015, the superior court entered and served an order stating that\n“because the State of California remains as a Plaintiff in this matter, the ruling as to the\nrelators does not resolve the entire matter.” The May 29 order invokes the “one final\njudgment” rule, and states that “[t]here cannot be more than one separate judgment in\nfavor of Defendant Bristol-Myers. By virtue of the Court’s two separate orders, . . . those\nparties are no longer in the case, but the State of California still remains, so there are\nissues left for future consideration.” As a result of this conclusion, the court vacated that\nportion of the March 30 order that required preparation of the proposed judgments.\n       This petition followed on June 16, 2015. We issued an order to show cause, and\nBMS filed a return on August 26, 2015. Wilson and the Allens filed a reply on\nSeptember 24, 2015.\n       The petition seeks to compel the superior court to sign the proposed judgments\nsubmitted by BMS, enabling Wilson and the Allens to obtain appellate review of the\ndecision granting BMS’ motions.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       The “one final judgment” rule is based in Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1,\nwhich provides that an appeal may be taken “[f]rom a judgment, except (A) an\n\n                                               5\n\finterlocutory judgment . . . .” This is the heart of respondent court’s conclusion that it\ncould not sign the judgments at issue.\n        There is an exception to this rule, however, in cases that involve multiple parties\nand a judgment is entered “which leaves no issue to be determined as to one party.”\n(Justus v. Atchison (1977) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198761\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198761/justus-v-atchison/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568.) In Justus, two couples brought actions\nfor medical malpractice and wrongful death in connection with the stillbirths of their\nbabies. In addition, each of the husbands brought a separate cause of action “for the\nshock he allegedly experienced in witnessing that death.” (Id. at p. 567.) The superior\ncourt granted the demurrers of defendants without leave to amend, and the plaintiff\nhusbands appealed. Appeal was proper because the judgments, although not resolving\nthe entire complaint, “disposed in each case of all the causes of action in which the\nhusbands are plaintiffs. It is irrelevant that the wives joined with the husbands as\nplaintiffs in one of these causes of action. This circumstance does not affect the reason\nfor the exception, i.e., that it better serves the interests of justice to afford prompt\nappellate review to a party whose rights or liabilities have been definitively adjudicated\nthan to require him to await the final outcome of trial proceedings which are of no further\nconcern to him.” (Id. at p. 568.)\n        The same is true here. Judgments against Wilson and the Allens, although they do\nnot resolve the entire complaint, dispose of all of causes of action with respect to each of\nthem.\n        Utilizing the “standard” rules providing for the summary judgment and judgment\non the pleadings, as BMS did in moving for judgments with respect to the relators but not\nthe State, the “standard” rules for execution of the judgments in favor of BMS, and\npermitting Wilson and the Allens to appeal, should apply as well. While not a qui tam\ncase, similar logic applied in Tinsley v. Palo Alto Unified School Dist. (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2134629\"><a href=\"/opinion/2134629/tinsley-v-palo-alto-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in which parents appealed a judgment sustaining without leave to amend\ndemurrers to their petition seeking to compel the defendant school districts to alleviate\nsegregated schools. Certain defendants argued as a threshold matter that the judgment\nagainst them was not final and not appealable because the state and other parties\n\n                                                6\n\fremained in the case and sought the same relief. The First District discussed that\n“respondents assert that the one final judgment rule must be applied to defeat the appeal\nin this case because the interests of the state, a remaining defendant, and the local\nrespondents in this case are identical both in terms of the legal issues raised and in the\nrelief sought by the petitioners, and, therefore, the judgment in this case cannot be a\ncomplete determination of the matter.” (Id. at p. 880.) Applying logic similar to that in\nthis case, the Tinsley court concluded that “On its face this argument is inherently\ninconsistent with the position successfully advocated by those respondents in the lower\ncourt when they secured the order sustaining their demurrers without leave to amend and\nthe ensuing judgment. If, as now stated, the local districts are mere agencies of the state\nso that any relief directed against the state will by necessity affect them, the trial court\nmay have erred in sustaining the demurrers. On that theory the appeal should not be\ndismissed, but the judgment should be reversed. The premise that there are identical\ninterests does not bear scrutiny. The local districts, as agents, may have limited powers\nin interdistrict affairs, whereas the state, as set forth below, has plenary powers in all\nschool district affairs. . . . The legal issues are not necessarily the same. In any event, if\nthey are, it should be so determined on this appeal and the existing judgments should be\nset aside if a cause of action has been stated against the local districts as agencies of the\nstate.” (Id. at pp. 880–881.)\n       This conclusion applies to this case as well. If Wilson and the Allens have\nseparately cognizable claims such that granting BMS’ motions for summary judgment\nand judgment on the pleadings was appropriate, resolving the case entirely with respect to\neach of them, the multiparty exception to the final judgment rule permits the superior\ncourt to execute the judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n      The petition for a writ of mandate is granted and the May 29, 2015 order of\nrespondent court is hereby vacated. Respondent court is directed to execute and file the\nproposed judgments.\n      Wilson and the Allens are awarded their costs related to this petition.\n\n      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED.\n\n\n                                                CHANEY, J.\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n      ROTHSCHILD, P.
