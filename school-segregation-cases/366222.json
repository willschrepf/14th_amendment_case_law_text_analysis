The result of this will be a decision which, when combined with one technique or another of student assignment, will determine the racial composition of the student body in each school in the system.  Over the long run, the consequences of the choices will be far reaching.  People gravitate toward school facilities, just as schools are located in response to the needs of people.

In addition to the classic pattern of building schools specifically intended for Negro or white students, school authorities have sometimes, since Brown, (Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed.2d 873) close schools which appeared likely to become racially mixed through changes in neighborhood residential patterns.  This was sometimes accompanied by building new schools in the areas of white suburban expansion farthest from Negro population centers in order to maintain the separation of the races with a minimum departure from the formal principles of 'neighborhood zoning.'  Such a policy does more than simply influence the short-run composition of the student body of a new school.  It may well promote segregated residential patterns which, when combined with 'neighborhood zoning,' further lock the school system into the mold of separation of the races.

When necessary, district courts should retain jurisdiction to assure that these responsibilities are carried out.  Cf. United States v. Board of Public Instruction, 395 F.2d 66 (CA5 1968); Brewer v.
