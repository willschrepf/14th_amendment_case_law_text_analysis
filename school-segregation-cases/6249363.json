Atlantic Richfield Co. Relevant to\n\nthe issue before us, the action in the District Court concerns a claim for restoration damages\n\nbrought by property owners in and around the town of Opportunity, Montana (hereafter\n\nreferred to as “Property Owners”). We accepted supervisory control of this case for the\n\nlimited purpose of considering the District Court’s August 30, 2016 Order Denying\n\nARCO’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Property Owners’ Claim for Restoration\n\nDamages as Barred by CERCLA and Granting Property Owners’ Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment on ARCO’s CERCLA Preemption Affirmative Defenses (11th–13th). We\n\nrestate the issues as follows:\n\n       Issue One: Whether the Property Owners’ claim constitutes a challenge to EPA’s\n       selected remedy, and thus does not comply with CERCLA’s timing of review\n       provision.\n\n       Issue Two: Whether the Property Owners are “Potentially Responsible Parties,”\n       and thus cannot proceed with their chosen restoration activities without EPA\n       approval.\n\n       Issue Three: Whether the Property Owners’ claim otherwise conflicts with\n       CERCLA, and is thus preempted.\n\n                  PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶2     The Anaconda Smelter, originally constructed by the Anaconda Copper Mining\n\nCompany, processed copper ore from Butte for nearly one hundred years before shutting\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fdown in 1980.      Also in 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental\n\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. § 9601, et\n\nseq. Also known as “Superfund,” the purpose of CERCLA is to foster the cleanup of sites\n\ncontaminated by hazardous waste, and to protect human health and the environment. In\n\n1983, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) designated the area impacted by the\n\nAnaconda Smelter, now owned by ARCO, as a Superfund site. In 1984, EPA issued an\n\nadministrative order requiring ARCO to begin a remedial investigation at the Smelter Site.\n\nIn 1998, EPA selected a remedy pursuant to CERCLA that detailed ARCO’s cleanup\n\nresponsibilities moving forward.\n\n¶3     As part of ARCO’s cleanup responsibility, EPA required ARCO to remediate\n\nresidential yards within the Smelter Site harboring levels of arsenic exceeding 250 parts\n\nper million in soil, and to remediate all wells used for drinking water with levels of arsenic\n\nin excess of ten parts per billion. The Property Owners, a group of ninety-eight landowners\n\nlocated within the bounds of the Smelter Site, sought the opinion of outside experts to\n\ndetermine what actions would be necessary to fully restore their properties to\n\npre-contamination levels. The experts recommended the Property Owners remove the top\n\ntwo feet of soil from affected properties and install permeable walls to remove arsenic from\n\nthe groundwater. Both remedies required restoration work in excess of what the EPA\n\nrequired of ARCO in its selected remedy.\n\n¶4     The Property Owners filed this action in 2008, claiming common law trespass,\n\nnuisance, and strict liability against ARCO, and seeking restoration damages.            Any\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\frecovered restoration damages are to be placed in a trust account and distributed only for\n\nthe purpose of conducting restoration work.\n\n¶5     In 2013, ARCO moved for summary judgment on the grounds that CERCLA barred\n\nthe Property Owners’ claims. The District Court did not address ARCO’s CERCLA\n\npreemption issue because it dismissed the Property Owners’ case on the basis that their\n\nclaims were barred by the statute of limitations. The Property Owners appealed and we\n\naffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the District Court for further\n\nproceedings. Christian v. Atl. Richfield Co., 2015 MT 255, ¶ 79, 380 Mont. 495, 358 P.3d\n\n131. On remand, the District Court denied all of ARCO’s contested motions for summary\n\njudgment. Among the orders denied was ARCO’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the\n\nProperty Owners’ Claim for Restoration Damages as Barred by CERCLA.                 ARCO\n\npetitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control, asking us to vacate four of the\n\nDistrict Court’s orders denying summary judgment and one order on a motion in limine.\n\nOn October 5, 2016, we issued an order granting the writ for the limited purpose of\n\nconsidering the District Court’s 2016 Order Denying ARCO’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment on Property Owners’ Claim for Restoration Damages as Barred by CERCLA\n\nand Granting Property Owners’ Motion for Summary Judgment on ARCO’s CERCLA\n\nPreemption Affirmative Defenses (11th–13th).\n\n¶6     The Property Owners bring several claims against ARCO: (1) injury to and loss of\n\nuse and enjoyment of real and personal property; (2) loss of the value of real property; (3)\n\nincidental and consequential damages, including relocation expenses and loss of rental\n\nincome and/or value; (4) annoyance, inconvenience, and discomfort over the loss and\n\n\n                                              5\n\fprospective loss of property value; and (5) expenses for and cost of investigation and\n\nrestoration of real property. ARCO concedes that the Property Owners may move forward\n\non their first four claims, but contend that the claim for restoration damages is preempted\n\nby CERCLA.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶7     We review de novo a district court’s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying\n\nthe same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as a district court. Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg.\n\nFunding, Inc., 2013 MT 354, ¶ 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839. Under Rule 56(c), judgment\n\n“shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\n\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue\n\nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Roe v. City of Missoula, 2009 MT 417, ¶ 14, 354 Mont. 1, 221 P.3d 1200 (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n¶8     In Sunburst School Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, 2007 MT 183, ¶ 34, 338 Mont. 259, 165\n\nP.3d 1079, we held: “If a plaintiff wants to use the damaged property, instead of selling it,\n\nrestoration of the property constitutes the only remedy that affords a plaintiff full\n\ncompensation.” To recover restoration damages, a plaintiff must show (1) the injury to the\n\nproperty is reasonably abatable, and (2) the plaintiff has “reasons personal” for seeking\n\nrestoration damages. Lampi v. Speed, 2011 MT 231, ¶ 29, 362 Mont. 122, 261 P.3d 1000\n\n(citing Sunburst, ¶¶ 31–39). In Sunburst, the plaintiffs sought restoration damages from\n\nTexaco to restore their properties to the condition the properties would have been in absent\n\n\n                                             6\n\fa benzene leak from a Texaco gasoline refinery. Sunburst, ¶ 38. Texaco argued that the\n\nplaintiffs’ common law claim for restoration damages was preempted by Montana’s\n\nComprehensive Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility Act (CECRA), a state statute\n\nsimilar in purpose and scope to CERCLA. Sunburst, ¶ 55. We further noted in Sunburst\n\nthat “[a] presumption exists against statutory preemption of common law claims. A statute\n\ndoes not take away common law claims except to the extent that the statute expressly or by\n\nnecessary implication declares.” Sunburst, ¶ 51 (internal citations omitted). Accordingly,\n\nwe held: “[N]o conflict exists between DEQ’s supervisory role under CECRA and\n\nrestoration damages awarded under the common law. We further conclude that nothing in\n\nCECRA precludes a common law claim by necessary implication.” Sunburst, ¶ 59.\n\n¶9    ARCO argues that the Property Owners may not bring their state law claim for\n\nrestoration damages because the claim conflicts with various provisions of CERCLA, and\n\nthus are preempted.    Preemption is established expressly, through the unambiguous\n\nlanguage of Congress in statute, or impliedly through the doctrines of field preemption or\n\nconflict preemption. Oneok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 1591, 1594–95\n\n(2015). Field preemption exists if Congress intended the relevant federal law to entirely\n\noccupy the field. California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 100, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 1665\n\n(1989). There is no field preemption in this case, as CERCLA expressly allows for\n\ncomplementary state laws, including common law, through a series of savings clauses:\n\n      Nothing in [CERCLA] shall affect or modify in any way the obligations or\n      liabilities of any person under other Federal or State law, including common\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f        law, with respect to releases of hazardous substances or other pollutants or\n        contaminants. . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9652(d).\n\n        Nothing in [CERCLA] shall be construed or interpreted as preempting any\n        State from imposing any additional liability or requirements with respect to\n        the release of hazardous substances within such State.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9614(a).\n\n¶10     ARCO advances three arguments regarding how it contends CERCLA bars the\n\nProperty Owners’ claim for restoration damages:          (1) Property Owners’ restoration\n\ndamages claim constitutes a direct challenge to EPA’s selected remedy and CERCLA’s\n\ntiming of review provision, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(h) (“CERCLA § 113(h)”), prevents this\n\nCourt from hearing challenges to an EPA remedy; (2) the Property Owners are “potentially\n\nresponsible parties” under CERCLA, and as such may not perform any restoration\n\nactivities without EPA approval; and (3) the Property Owners’ claim otherwise conflicts\n\nwith CERCLA and is barred under the doctrine of conflict preemption. We address each\n\nof these arguments in turn.\n\n¶11     Issue One: Whether the Property Owners’ claim constitutes a challenge to EPA’s\n        selected remedy, and thus does not comply with CERCLA’s timing of review\n        provision.\n\n¶12     ARCO cites CERCLA’s “timing of review” provision, § 113(h), for the proposition\n\nthat CERCLA expressly preempts the Property Owners’ claim by denying Montana courts\n\njurisdiction over any challenges to a CERCLA cleanup. Section 113(h) reads, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n        No Federal court shall have jurisdiction under Federal law other than under\n        section 1332 of title 28 (relating to diversity of citizenship jurisdiction) or\n        under State law which is applicable or relevant and appropriate under section\n\n                                              8\n\f       § 9621 of this title (relating to cleanup standards) to review any challenges\n       to removal or remedial action selected under section of § 9604 of this title,\n       or to review any order issued under section § 9606(a) of this title. . . .\n\nAt the outset, it bears noting that this statute begins: “No Federal court shall have\n\njurisdiction under Federal law . . . .” (Emphasis added). Conspicuously absent is any\n\nreference to state court jurisdiction over state law claims. It is well-established that “[i]n\n\nthe construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what\n\nis in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit\n\nwhat has been inserted.” Section 1-2-101, MCA.\n\n¶13    ARCO relies on a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case in which the Ninth Circuit\n\nread § 113(h) together with § 113(b) to conclude that Montana state courts lack jurisdiction\n\nover any claims that “constitute ‘a challenge to a CERCLA cleanup.’” ARCO Envtl.\n\nRemediation, LLC v. Dep’t of Health & Envtl. Quality, 213 F.3d 1108, 1115 (9th Cir.\n\n2000). The Ninth Circuit concluded that because § 113(b) grants federal courts “exclusive\n\noriginal jurisdiction over all controversies arising under [CERCLA],” it interpreted\n\n§ 113(h)’s reference to “challenges to removal or remedial action” to be a “controversy\n\narising under [CERCLA],” and thus exclusively within the jurisdiction of the federal\n\ncourts. ARCO Envtl. Remediation, 213 F.3d at 1115.\n\n¶14    Irrespective of this jurisdictional question, however, ARCO acknowledges that its\n\nargument for conflict preemption under § 113(h) turns on whether the Property Owners’\n\nclaim for restoration damages “challenges” the CERCLA cleanup. We have not previously\n\naddressed what constitutes a “challenge” within the context of § 113(h). In ARCO\n\nEnvironmental Remediation the Ninth Circuit defined a “challenge” as a claim that “is\n\n\n                                              9\n\frelated to the goals of the cleanup.” ARCO Envtl. Remediation, 213 F.3d at 1115. More\n\nspecifically, the Ninth Circuit further held that a “challenge” was any action in which a\n\nparty seeks “to dictate specific remedial actions; to postpone the cleanup; to impose\n\nadditional reporting requirements on the cleanup; or to . . . alter the method and order of\n\ncleanup.”   ARCO Envtl. Remediation, 213 F.3d at 1115 (internal citations omitted).\n\nAnother definition comes from the Southern District of Indiana. In Taylor Farm Ltd. Liab.\n\nCo. v. Viacom, Inc., 234 F. Supp. 2d 950, 974–75 (S.D. Ind. 2002), the Indiana District\n\nCourt rejected the defendant’s proposed definition of a challenge as being anything more\n\ncomprehensive than the EPA-selected remedy. The Court held:\n\n       [T]he only sense in which Taylor’s lawsuit can be said to “challenge”\n       Viacom’s settlement agreement with the EPA is that, if Taylor is successful,\n       Viacom will be required to spend more money to clean up the land for\n       Taylor’s benefit than the EPA required Viacom to spend for the public’s\n       benefit.\n\nTaylor Farm, 234 F. Supp. 2d at 976. Yet another interpretation comes from Samples v.\n\nConoco, Inc., 165 F. Supp. 2d 1303, 1315–16 (N.D. Fla 2001), in which the Florida District\n\nCourt concluded the plaintiffs’ claim was not a “challenge” under § 113(h), because:\n\n       [It] is not an action designed to review or contest the remedy selected by the\n       EPA prior to implementation; it is not an action designed to obtain a court\n       order directing the EPA to select a different remedy; it is not an action\n       designed to delay, enjoin, or prevent the implementation of a remedy selected\n       by the EPA; and it is not a citizen suit brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 9659.\n\nStill other interpretations come from the Third Circuit in Boarhead Corp. v. Erickson, 923\n\nF.2d 1011, 1019, 1024 (3rd Cir. 1991) (holding a claim is a challenge only if it “would\n\ninterfere” with or “delay[] the prompt cleanup” of hazardous sites); and the District of New\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\fMexico in Reynolds v. Lujan, 785 F. Supp. 152, 154 (D.N.M. 1992) (holding a claim is a\n\nchallenge if it would require the court to “alter the [EPA’s] ongoing response activities.”).\n\n¶15    Synthesizing the various interpretations of what constitutes a “challenge” in light of\n\nthe nature of the Property Owners’ claim and CERCLA’s savings clauses evinces that,\n\nfundamentally, a § 113(h) challenge must actively interfere with EPA’s work, as when the\n\nrelief sought would stop, delay, or change the work EPA is doing. At a minimum, a\n\n“challenge” must be more than merely requiring ARCO to spend more money to clean up\n\nthe land for the Property Owners’ benefit, as the court in Taylor Farm noted. In this case,\n\nthe restoration damages Property Owners seek are to be placed in a trust account and used\n\nto further restore affected properties beyond the levels required by the EPA, and the\n\nrestoration work would be completed by the Property Owners themselves. To the extent\n\nthat EPA’s work is ongoing, the Property Owners are not seeking to interfere with that\n\nwork, nor are they seeking to stop, delay, or change the work EPA is doing. The Property\n\nOwners’ claim is exactly the sort contemplated in CERCLA’s savings clauses, and does\n\nnot present a “challenge” to EPA’s selected remedy. Absent a “challenge” to removal or\n\nremedial action selected in the CERCLA cleanup process, §§ 113(h) and (b) do not deprive\n\nMontana courts of jurisdiction to entertain state-law restoration claims.\n\n¶16    Despite ARCO’s efforts to overcomplicate this matter and recast what is, at its\n\nessence, a common law claim for damages into a challenge to EPA’s cleanup, the\n\nfundamental issue before us is one of timing. Specifically, when can private landowners\n\nbring a state common law claim for restoration damages for the purpose of cleaning up\n\ntheir own private property? The Dissent maintains that any such claim, if it relates to the\n\n\n                                             11\n\fgoals of the cleanup, must wait until the EPA has completed its work and moved on because\n\nCERCLA “protects the execution of a CERCLA plan during its pendency from lawsuits\n\nthat might interfere with the expeditious cleanup effort.” Dissent, ¶ 48, quoting McClellan\n\nEcological Seepage Situation v. Perry, 47 F.3d 325, 329 (9th Cir. 1995) (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as MESS) (emphasis in original). Even by the Dissent’s analysis, though, the\n\nProperty Owners’ claim does not constitute a challenge to EPA’s plan. The Dissent cites\n\na litany of cases from other jurisdictions in ostensible support of the contention that the\n\nProperty Owners’ damage claim constitutes a challenge to EPA’s remediation plan.\n\nDissent, ¶ 44. These cases are inapposite to the Property Owners’ claim presently before\n\nus. None of the cases cited by the Dissent, nor any of the cases cited by ARCO or the\n\nUnited States, involve a claim by private property owners, against another private party,\n\nseeking money damages for the purpose of restoring their own private property. The\n\nProperty Owners are not asking the Court “to dictate specific remedial actions.” The\n\nProperty Owners are not asking the Court to “impose additional reporting requirements on\n\nthe cleanup.” The Property Owners are not asking the Court to “terminate the Remedial\n\nInvestigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and alter the method and order of cleanup.”\n\nNothing in the Property Owners’ claim for restoration damages “stands as an obstacle to\n\nthe accomplishment of congressional objectives as encompassed in CERCLA,” unless\n\nCongress’s objective was to condemn, in perpetuity, the private property of an individual\n\nproperty owner because that property happened to have been contaminated by a third party.\n\n¶17    Put simply, the Property Owners are not asking the Court to interfere with the EPA’s\n\nplan. The Property Owners are not seeking to enjoin any of EPA’s activities, or requesting\n\n\n                                            12\n\fthat EPA be required to alter, delay, or expedite its plan in any fashion whatsoever. The\n\nProperty Owners are simply asking to be allowed to present their own plan to restore their\n\nown private property to a jury of twelve Montanans who will then assess the merits of that\n\nplan. If the jury awards restoration damages, those damages will be placed in a trust for\n\nthe express purpose of effectuating the Property Owners’ restoration plan. Indeed, any\n\nrestoration will be performed by the Property Owners themselves and will not seek to force\n\nthe EPA to do, or refrain from doing, anything at the Site.\n\n¶18    The Dissent contends that § 113(h) requires rejecting claims that challenge EPA’s\n\nongoing remedial action. Dissent, ¶ 43. What, if any, actual remedial action remains\n\nongoing is, at least, unclear. Even assuming there is something that would constitute\n\nongoing remedial action, however, this still does not morph the Property Owners’ claim\n\nfor restoration damages—for purposes of funding an eventual restoration according to the\n\nProperty Owners’ plan—into a challenge to EPA’s cleanup. As Justice Baker notes in her\n\nconcurrence, the United States’ counsel acknowledged during oral argument that some\n\naspects of the Property Owners’ restoration plan would not constitute a “challenge” within\n\nthe meaning of the law. Concurrence, ¶ 32. As to other aspects of the Property Owners’\n\nrestoration plan, even the federal government has to pull up stakes at some point and leave\n\nthese private property owners alone to attend to their own private property. If the Property\n\nOwners must wait for that eventuality to conclude their restoration plan, the history of this\n\ncase amply demonstrates that they have the patience for it.\n\n¶19    Whether or not the Property Owners succeed on their claim for restoration damages\n\nwill not affect, alter, or delay EPA’s work in any fashion. Likewise, EPA’s work, whether\n\n\n                                             13\n\fongoing or not, has no bearing on the success or failure of the Property Owners’ claim for\n\nrestoration damages on the merits. In Sunburst, we noted “that CECRA’s focus on cost\n\neffectiveness and limits on health-based standards differ from the factors to be considered\n\nin assessing damages under the common law.” Sunburst, ¶ 59. The same reasoning applies\n\nhere: CERCLA’s regulatory standards do not apply to the common law claim at issue. The\n\nDistrict Court has already recognized this fact when it granted the Property Owners’ motion\n\nin limine to preclude ARCO from presenting evidence regarding its compliance with EPA\n\nrequirements, and correctly noted that allowing such evidence at trial “pose[d] the clear\n\nrisk for ARCO to ‘cloak itself’ in the authority of the federal government.” See Sunburst,\n\n¶¶ 107, 121 (discussing Texaco’s efforts to cloak itself in the authority of the State of\n\nMontana in order to create confusion). That being noted, nothing in our holding here\n\nshould be construed as precluding ARCO from contesting the Property Owners’ restoration\n\ndamages claim on its own merits, just as it may contest the Property Owners’ other claims.\n\n¶20    The Property Owners’ claim for restoration damages in this case arises solely under\n\nstate common law, and does not implicate federal law or cleanup standards. The Property\n\nOwners are not seeking to compel EPA to do, or refrain from doing, any action. Therefore,\n\nthe Property Owners’ claim does not implicate § 113(h), nor does it implicate § 113(b).\n\nUnited States v. Akzo Coatings of Am., Inc., 949 F.2d 1409, 1455 (6th Cir. 1991) (“Clearly\n\npreserved [by § 113(h)], are challenges to the selection or adequacy of remedies based on\n\nstate nuisance law . . . independent of federal response action.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f¶21    Issue Two: Whether the Property Owners are “Potentially Responsible Parties,”\n       and thus cannot proceed with their chosen restoration activities without EPA\n       approval.\n\n¶22    ARCO argues that under 42 U.S.C. § 9622(e)(6) (“CERCLA § 122(e)(6)”), the\n\nProperty Owners are “Potentially Responsible Parties” (“PRP”), and are thus prohibited\n\nfrom conducting any remedial action that is inconsistent with EPA’s selected remedy\n\nwithout EPA’s consent. There are several categories of PRPs. For purposes of our\n\nanalysis, however, the only relevant category is a class consisting of all current owners of\n\nproperty at a CERCLA facility. 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(1).\n\n¶23    Designation as a PRP may occur in one of three ways: (1) if the party has entered\n\ninto a voluntary settlement with the EPA; (2) upon a judicial determination that the party\n\nis a responsible party; or (3) if the party is currently a defendant in a CERCLA lawsuit and\n\nhas been found not to be entitled to statutory defenses. Taylor Farm, 234 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n966–71 (citing Pneumo Abex Corp. v. High Point, Thomasville and Denton R. Co.,\n\n142 F.3d 769, 773, n.2 (4th Cir. 1998) and New Castle County v. Halliburton NUS Corp.,\n\n111 F.3d 1116, 1120, n.2 (3d Cir. 1997)). The statutory defenses relevant to the Property\n\nOwners are the “innocent landowner” defense and the “contiguous landowner” defense.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9607(b)(3), (q).\n\n¶24    ARCO argues that a PRP is a strictly defined category, subject to liability even if\n\nthe PRP did not cause or contribute to the contamination. Chubb Custom Ins. Co. v. Space\n\nSys./Loral, Inc., 710 F.3d 946, 956–57 (9th Cir. 2013). ARCO also contends that even if\n\nthe Property Owners were able to avail themselves of a defense to liability for cleanup\n\ncosts, they would still meet the broader definition of PRP, and be bound by § 122(e)(6).\n\n\n                                            15\n\fEssentially, ARCO asks us to treat the Property Owners as PRPs under § 122(e)(6), even\n\nthough they have never been treated as PRPs for any purpose—by either EPA or ARCO—\n\nduring the entire thirty-plus years since the Property Owners’ property was designated as\n\nbeing within the Superfund site. As the Property Owners correctly point out, the statute of\n\nlimitations for such a claim (at most six years from the date cleanup work was initiated)\n\nhas long passed. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 596 F.3d 112,\n\n128 (2d Cir. 2010). Put simply, the PRP horse left the barn decades ago.\n\n¶25    The Property Owners have never entered into a voluntary settlement with the EPA.\n\nThere has never been a judicial determination that the Property Owners are responsible\n\nparties. The Property Owners are not currently, nor have they ever been, defendants in a\n\nCERCLA lawsuit in which they were found not to be entitled to statutory defenses. The\n\nEPA has not included the Property Owners as a defendant in the legal proceedings in this\n\nmatter, nor have they been party to any settlement agreements regarding cleanup\n\nproceedings. Despite the EPA never engaging the Property Owners as PRPs, ARCO now\n\nasks us to treat the Property Owners as PRPs—for the first time in these proceedings—\n\nsolely for the purpose of using § 122(e)(6) to bar their claim for restoration damages. We\n\ndecline to do so.\n\n¶26    Issue Three: Whether the Property Owners’ claim otherwise conflicts with\n       CERCLA, and is thus preempted.\n\n¶27    ARCO’s final argument is that other conflicts exist between CERCLA and the\n\nProperty Owners’ claim for restoration damages. ARCO proffers three lines of reasoning\n\nfor this argument.    First, ARCO argues that the EPA has sole authority to select\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fenvironmental remedies at Superfund sites, which would preclude alternative standards\n\nand remedies. To adopt this reasoning would be to ignore CERCLA’s savings clauses. As\n\nstated above, CERCLA’s savings clauses expressly contemplate the applicability of state\n\nlaw remedies. 42 U.S.C. §§ 9614(a), 9652(d). Second, ARCO contends there is an\n\n“unambiguous congressional intent to foreclose any state law remedy that challenges or\n\nobstructs EPA’s remedy at a Superfund site.” This argument fails for the same reason that\n\n§ 113(h) does not apply: the Property Owners’ claim does not prevent the EPA from\n\naccomplishing its goals at the ARCO Site. Lastly, ARCO again characterizes the Property\n\nOwners’ claim as a challenge to EPA’s selected remedy, and argues that the claim cannot\n\nproceed until EPA’s remedy is fully performed. Yet CERCLA’s savings clauses operate\n\nto preserve the Property Owners’ ability to pursue this claim. 42 U.S.C. § 9652(d)\n\n(“Nothing in [CERCLA] shall affect or modify in any way the obligations or liabilities of\n\nany person under other Federal or State law, including common law, with respect to\n\nreleases of hazardous substances or other pollutants or contaminants.” (emphasis added)).\n\nCERCLA does not expressly or impliedly preempt the Property Owners’ claim for\n\nrestoration damages in this matter.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶28    We conclude that the District Court did not err by Denying ARCO’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment on Property Owners’ Claim for Restoration Damages as Barred by\n\nCERCLA and Granting Property Owners’ Motion for Summary Judgment on ARCO’s\n\nCERCLA Preemption Affirmative Defenses (11th–13th). To be clear, ARCO is not\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fprecluded from contesting the merits of the Property Owners’ restoration plans. However,\n\nthat is an issue of fact to be resolved at trial.\n\n¶29    THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED:\n\n¶30    The District Court’s order Denying ARCO’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nProperty Owners’ Claim for Restoration Damages as Barred by CERCLA and Granting\n\nProperty Owners’ Motion for Summary Judgment on ARCO’s CERCLA Preemption\n\nAffirmative Defenses (11th–13th) is AFFIRMED. This matter is remanded to the District\n\nCourt for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n\n       DATED this 29th day of December, 2017.\n\n\n                                                     /S/ JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA\n\nWe Concur:\n\n/S/ JAMES MANLEY\nSitting for Chief Justice Mike McGrath\n/S/ JOHN KUTZMAN\nSitting for Justice Jim Rice\n/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n/S/ DIRK M. SANDEFUR\n\n\nJustice Beth Baker, specially concurring.\n\n¶31    I understand the Court’s decision today to be a narrow one: CERCLA does not, as\n\na matter of law, preempt all common-law claims for restoration damages to the property of\n\na private individual. I agree with that conclusion and with the decision not to treat the\n\nProperty Owners as PRPs. I thus concur with the Court’s ruling that the District Court did\n\nnot err in denying ARCO’s motion for summary judgment on the restoration damages\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fclaims. I appreciate the Dissent’s thorough analysis of CERCLA § 113(h), but do not agree\n\nthat it applies to foreclose the Property Owners’ claims.\n\n¶32    It became clear during oral argument in this case that the parties dispute whether\n\naspects of the Property Owners’ proposed restoration plan would conflict with actions\n\nARCO has taken in the Superfund cleanup effort. ARCO’s counsel characterized the\n\ndispute as one of jurisdiction, which empowers the trial court to determine underlying facts.\n\nHere, the trial court determined, for conflict preemption purposes, that the Property\n\nOwners’ claims did not stand as an obstacle to the CERCLA cleanup underway or impede\n\nEPA’s requirements on the site. Amicus curiae the United States argues that the purpose\n\nof CERCLA is to assure that EPA coordinates the cleanup between multiple stakeholders,\n\nso that the selected plan may move forward without obstruction, delay, or the diversion of\n\nresources that would accompany multiple individual plans and proposals. The government\n\nstresses that state-court lawsuits cannot, under § 113(h), supplement EPA’s selected\n\nresponse-action cleanup levels if such a proposed plan challenges or conflicts with EPA’s\n\nproposed remedy. The government recognizes, though, that CERCLA does not bar all\n\nstate-law claims by affected landowners, and its counsel acknowledged during oral\n\nargument that some aspects of the Property Owners’ plan would not be a “challenge”\n\nwithin the meaning of the law. The Property Owners’ counsel protested during argument\n\nthat it was the first time they had heard that some aspects of their plan would “undo” what\n\nalready has been done, and that in nine years of litigation no evidence had been presented\n\nto the District Court that the Property Owners’ plan conflicted with EPA’s remedy.\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f¶33    The large-scale environmental remediation projects made possible by CERCLA are\n\nintended, and are essential, to clean up severe widespread contamination resulting from\n\ndecades of historic mining practices that left expansive deposits of toxic tailings and\n\nparticulate fallout in floodplains, ranchlands, and soils. The massive cleanup efforts in\n\nwhich ARCO, EPA, and the State of Montana have engaged for more than thirty years have\n\ngone far to remediate the Superfund site. But CERLCA draws a distinction between\n\nremedial action and damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9607(a)(4)(A), (C). Outside of the remediation process, States may pursue\n\nrecovery of damages on behalf of the public as trustee of the state’s natural resources to\n\n“restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of such natural resources by the State.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9607(f)(1) (emphasis added). “CERCLA sets a floor, not a ceiling.” New Mexico\n\nv. Gen. Elec. Co., 467 F.3d 1223, 1246 (10th Cir. 2006). And CERCLA does not cover\n\ndamages to “purely private property.” Ohio v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 880 F.2d 432,\n\n460 (D.C. Cir. 1989). It does not force local residents simply to live with the impacts if\n\nthey can prove, through their nuisance and trespass actions, that state law entitles them to\n\ndamages for the restoration of their own land. As the Court observes, consistent with our\n\nparallel conclusion in Sunburst, CERCLA’s “focus on cost effectiveness and limits on\n\nhealth-based standards differ from the factors to be considered in assessing damages under\n\nthe common law.”      Opinion, ¶ 19 (quoting Sunburst, ¶ 59). The dynamic between\n\nindividual restoration and CERCLA’s coordinated large-scale response does not give rise\n\nto preemption as a matter of law. “Tension between federal and state law is not enough to\n\nestablish conflict preemption. We find preemption only in those situations where conflicts\n\n\n                                            20\n\fwill necessarily arise. A hypothetical conflict is not a sufficient basis for preemption.”\n\nIncalza v. Fendi N. Am., Inc., 479 F.3d 1005, 1010 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal citations and\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n¶34    In our limited Order accepting supervisory control in this case, we did not agree to\n\nreview the District Court’s orders in limine. But the Court observes that ARCO is not\n\nprecluded at trial from contesting the merits of the Property Owners’ restoration plans.\n\nOpinion, ¶¶ 19, 28. A claim for restoration damages requires the Property Owners to prove\n\ntwo separate elements: (1) temporary injury and (2) reasons personal for the restoration.\n\nLampi, ¶ 29 (quoting Sunburst, ¶¶ 31-39). An injury is temporary “if the tortfeasor could\n\nrestore the destroyed property to substantially the condition in which it existed before the\n\ninjury. An injury that would cease to exist once remediation or restoration has been\n\ncompleted qualifies as temporary.” Lampi, ¶ 32 (internal citations omitted). For temporary\n\ninjury, the ability to repair the injury “must be more than a theoretical possibility.”\n\nSunburst, ¶ 31 (citing Burk Ranches v. State, 242 Mont. 300, 306, 790 P.2d 443, 447\n\n(1990)).\n\n¶35    The “reasons personal” element requires the Property Owners “to establish that the\n\naward actually will be used for restoration.” Lampi, ¶ 31. The “personal reasons” analysis\n\nis required only when the restoration costs “exceed disproportionately” the diminution in\n\nvalue of the property. McEwen v. MCR, LLC, 2012 MT 319, ¶ 30, 368 Mont. 38, 291 P.3d\n\n1253; Sunburst, ¶ 38. Finally, an “injured party is to be made as nearly whole as possible—\n\nbut not to realize a profit. Compensatory damages are designed to compensate the injured\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fparty for actual loss or injury—no more, no less.” Sunburst, ¶ 40 (quoting Burk Ranches,\n\n242 Mont. at 307, 790 P.2d at 447).\n\n¶36     “[T]hese issues normally present factual questions for the jury to resolve.” Lampi,\n\n¶ 48.    The Court acknowledges the District Court’s concern about allowing ARCO to\n\n“‘cloak itself’ in the authority of the federal government.” Opinion, ¶ 19. I write\n\nseparately to add that if ARCO contends that the Property Owners’ proposed remedy\n\nconflicts with or requires modification of measures ARCO already has taken to clean up\n\nthe site, ARCO must be able to address those conflicts in seeking to rebut the Property\n\nOwners’ claim on the essential elements of proof under our standards for a restoration\n\ndamages claim. What ARCO may not do at trial is point to the EPA’s selected remedy and\n\nsay, “We’ve done everything the government required; that’s all we need to do.” What\n\nARCO may do is offer evidence to support its claim that the Property Owners’ proposed\n\nrestoration plan is not feasible and thus does not qualify as a temporary injury. And the\n\nProperty Owners should have the opportunity to prove their claim that ARCO’s cleanup\n\nefforts to date have not returned their properties to substantially the same condition in\n\nwhich they were before the injury, but that the injury will cease to exist if their proposed\n\nrestoration plan is implemented. The Property Owners’ proposals should be considered by\n\nthe jury in the context of determining whether ARCO is liable for their alleged injuries and\n\nwhether those injuries are compensable by an award of restoration damages. Evidence on\n\nthe issue of temporary injury may well overlap with the evidence required to show,\n\npursuant to our holding in Atlantic Richfield Co., ¶ 77, whether the continuing tort doctrine\n\ntolled the period of limitations for the Property Owners’ claims. It makes sense to allow\n\n\n                                             22\n\fthe parties to develop the evidence for the jury’s consideration of these issues and a record\n\nthat may be reviewed, if necessary, on appeal from any final judgment.\n\n\n                                                      /S/ BETH BAKER\n\n\nJustice Laurie McKinnon, dissenting.\n\n¶37    Property Owners seek monetary damages for state law claims of nuisance, trespass,\n\nand strict liability. ARCO does not contest that litigation of these state law claims may\n\nproceed during the pendency of the CERCLA cleanup process and, accordingly, that issue\n\nis not before the Court. ARCO does contend that Property Owners’ claim for restoration\n\ndamages proposes a different cleanup plan than that chosen by the EPA, thus constituting\n\na challenge which is preempted by CERCLA. In my view, Property Owners’ restoration\n\nplan, which includes digging an 8,000-foot trench for a groundwater wall and removing\n\n650,000 tons of soil over a period of years, would conflict with the ongoing EPA\n\ninvestigation and CERCLA cleanup.1 The Court’s conclusion that, during the pendency of\n\na CERCLA cleanup effort, a jury may determine restoration damages and place the amount\n\nof money so determined in a trust for future restoration efforts, Opinion, ¶ 17, is not only\n\n\n\n\n1  To recover restoration damages under Montana law, the plaintiff must present evidence and\nconvince the fact-finder that he will actually conduct the restoration upon which the restoration\nclaim is based. Lampi, ¶ 31 (“The reasons personal rule requires plaintiff to establish that the\naward actually will be used for restoration . . . .”); Sunburst, ¶ 43; McEwen, ¶ 50. It is the actual\nperformance of Property Owners’ restoration plan—a prerequisite to their damage award—that\nimpermissibly challenges the EPA’s remedy. For purposes of brevity, I do not address other\nprovisions of CERCLA which ARCO asserts would bar Property Owners from completing their\nrestoration plan.\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\finconsistent with CERCLA and federal precedent, but has no authority in Montana law.2\n\nProperty Owners may not “achieve indirectly through the threat of monetary damages . . .\n\nwhat [they] cannot obtain directly through mandatory injunctive relief incompatible with\n\nthe ongoing CERCLA-mandated remediation.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1250. Moreover,\n\n“[d]amages must be proven by substantial evidence which is not the product of mere guess\n\nor speculation.” Sebena v. Am. Auto. Ass’n, 280 Mont. 305, 309, 930 P.2d 51, 53 (1996).\n\n“[W]here no costs have been incurred, and no costs are reasonably certain to be incurred\n\nin the future, the plaintiff has not stated a claim for damages,” and summary judgment\n\nshould be granted. Town of Superior v. Asarco, Inc., 874 F. Supp. 2d 937, 949 (D. Mont.\n\n2004). See also B.M. v. State, 215 Mont. 175, 179, 698 P.2d 399, 401 (1985) (“Where\n\nplaintiff presents evidence of damages which are purely speculative, summary judgment is\n\nappropriate.”). Here, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Property Owners’ claim\n\nfor restoration damages is a challenge to the EPA’s remedial action and prohibited by\n\nCERCLA as a matter of law.\n\n¶38    CERCLA is a “comprehensive statute that grants the President broad power to\n\ncommand government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardous waste sites.” Key\n\nTronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U.S. 809, 814, 114 S. Ct. 1960, 1964 (1994).3\n\n\n\n2\n   The Court errs when it applies the Sunburst analysis to the instant proceedings. In Sunburst,\nthere was no question that Montana state courts had subject-matter jurisdiction over CERCLA and\ncommon law claims. Here, however, CERCLA-related activities are the exclusive, original\njurisdiction of the federal courts and a challenge in state court to the chosen EPA remedy implicates\nthe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\n3\n  CERCLA vests authority in the President, who, in turn, has delegated most of his functions and\nauthority to the EPA. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 9606(c), 9615; 40 C.F.R. § 300.100.\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f“CERCLA is best known as setting forth a comprehensive mechanism to cleanup\n\nhazardous waste sites under a restoration-based approach.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1244\n\n(citation omitted; emphasis added). CERCLA was intended to “promote the timely cleanup\n\nof hazardous waste sites, ensure that polluters were held responsible for the cleanup efforts,\n\nand encourage settlement through specified contribution protection.” Chubb, 710 F.3d at\n\n956. “One of the core purposes of CERCLA is to foster settlement through its system of\n\nincentives and without unnecessarily further complicating already complicated litigation.”\n\nCal.

Under CERCLA § 113(f)(2), “[a] person who has resolved\n\nits liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or judicially approved\n\nsettlement shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the\n\nsettlement.” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(f)(2).\n\n¶39    There are two types of cleanup actions under CERCLA: remedial actions and\n\nremoval actions. Remedial actions generally are “long-term or permanent containment or\n\ndisposal programs” while removal actions are “typically short-term cleanup\n\narrangements.” Schaefer v. Town of Victor, 457 F.3d 188, 195 (2d Cir. 2006) (citation and\n\nquotation omitted). CERCLA defines “remedial action” as:\n\n\n                                             25\n\f      [T]hose actions consistent with permanent remedy taken instead of or in\n      addition to removal actions in the event of a release or threatened release of\n      a hazardous substance into the environment, to prevent or minimize the\n      release of hazardous substances so that they do not migrate to cause\n      substantial danger to present or future public health or welfare or the\n      environment. The term includes, but is not limited to, such actions at the\n      location of the release as storage, confinement, perimeter protection using\n      dikes, trenches, or ditches, clay cover, neutralization, cleanup of released\n      hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials, recycling or\n      reuse, diversion, destruction, segregation of reactive wastes, dredging or\n      excavations, repair or replacement of leaking containers, collection of\n      leachate and runoff, onsite treatment or incineration, provision of alternative\n      water supplies, and any monitoring reasonably required to assure that such\n      actions protect the public health and welfare and the environment. The term\n      includes the costs of permanent relocation of residents and businesses and\n      community facilities where the President determines that, alone or in\n      combination with other measures, such relocation is more cost-effective than\n      and environmentally preferable to the transportation, storage, treatment,\n      destruction, or secure disposition offsite of hazardous substances, or may\n      otherwise be necessary to protect public health or welfare; the term includes\n      offsite transport and offsite storage, treatment, destruction, or secure\n      disposition of hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9601(24) (emphasis added).\n\n¶40   CERCLA defines “remove” or “removal” as:\n\n      [T]he cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances from the\n      environment, such actions as may be necessary . . . to monitor, assess, and\n      evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous substances, the disposal\n      of removed material, or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary\n      to prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or\n      to the environment, which may otherwise result from a release or threat of\n      release. The term includes, in addition, without being limited to, security\n      fencing or other measures to limit access, provision of alternative water\n      supplies, temporary evacuation and housing of threatened individuals not\n      otherwise provided for . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9601(23).\n\n¶41   CERCLA-related activities may qualify as removal or remedial actions in at least\n\nthree ways. Hanford Downwinders Coal. v. Dowdle, 71 F.3d 1469, 1474 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n                                            26\n\fFirst, the action may be specifically designated as removal or remedial activity. Hanford\n\nDownwinders, 71 F.3d at 1474. Second, cleanup activity explicitly classified in CERCLA\n\nas a “response” is, by definition, a removal or remedial action. See 42 U.S.C. § 9601(25)\n\n(defining “response” as a “removal” or “remedial action”). Finally, “even if action taken\n\nat a CERCLA site is not referred to in the statute as a removal or remedial action or a\n\nresponse action, the Timing of Review provision will still apply if the action satisfies\n\nCERCLA’s definition of ‘removal’ or ‘remedial.’” Hanford Downwinders, 71 F.3d at\n\n1474.\n\n¶42     CERCLA provides that “the United States district courts shall have exclusive\n\noriginal jurisdiction over all controversies arising under [CERCLA].” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(b).\n\nSection 113(h) of CERCLA, titled “Timing of review,” provides an exception to federal\n\njurisdiction during the pendency of a CERCLA removal or remedial action: “No Federal\n\ncourt shall have jurisdiction under Federal law . . . or under State law . . . to review any\n\nchallenges to removal or remedial action . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(h). Section 113(h) clearly\n\nand unequivocally precludes contemporaneous challenges to CERCLA cleanups,\n\nregardless of whether the challenge is made pursuant to federal or state law. Section 113(h)\n\namounts to a “blunt withdrawal of federal jurisdiction” and precludes any challenge to\n\nCERCLA cleanups. N. Shore Gas Co. v. EPA, 930 F.2d 1239, 1244 (7th Cir. 1991); accord\n\nBroward Gardens Tenants Ass’n v. EPA, 311 F.3d 1066, 1075 (11th Cir. 2002). “Section\n\n113 withholds federal jurisdiction to review any . . . claims, including those made in citizen\n\nsuits and under non-CERCLA statutes, that are found to constitute ‘challenges’ to ongoing\n\nCERCLA cleanup actions.” MESS, 47 F.3d at 329. Read in conjunction, § 113(b) and (h)\n\n\n                                             27\n\fdivest state courts of jurisdiction to review any state law claim which amounts to a\n\nchallenge of a CERCLA removal or remedial action. Fort Ord Toxics Project v. Cal. EPA,\n\n189 F.3d 828, 832 (9th Cir. 1999). In Fort Ord Toxics Project, the Ninth Circuit observed\n\nthat “by granting district courts exclusive jurisdiction over all controversies arising under\n\nCERCLA, Congress used language more expansive than would be necessary if it intended\n\nto limit exclusive jurisdiction solely to those claims created by CERCLA.” Fort Ord, 189\n\nF.3d at 832 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n¶43    The Ninth Circuit explained, “Congress concluded that the need for [swift execution\n\nof CERCLA cleanup plans] was paramount, and that peripheral disputes, including those\n\nover what measures actually are necessary to clean-up the site and remove the hazard, may\n\nnot be brought while the cleanup is in progress.” MESS, 47 F.3d at 329 (internal quotations\n\nand citations omitted). Accordingly, § 113(h) “protects the execution of a CERCLA plan\n\nduring its pendency from lawsuits that might interfere with the expeditious cleanup effort.\n\nThis result furthers the policy underlying CERCLA by allowing a quick response to serious\n\nhazards.” MESS, 47 F.3d at 329 (emphasis in original). The court explained in MESS:\n\n       We recognize that the application of Section 113(h) may in some cases delay\n       judicial review for years, if not permanently, and may result in irreparable\n       harm to other important interests. Whatever its likelihood, such a possibility\n       is for legislators, and not judges, to address. We must presume that Congress\n       has already balanced all concerns and concluded that the interest in removing\n       the hazard of toxic waste from Superfund sites clearly outweighs the risk of\n       irreparable harm.\n\nMESS, 47 F.3d at 329 (internal quotations, citations, and footnote omitted). In MESS, the\n\ncourt was careful to explain that it was not deciding “whether or to what extent the district\n\ncourt can entertain MESS’s various claims after implementation of the CERCLA cleanup\n\n\n                                             28\n\fat McClellan is complete.” MESS, 47 F.3d at 329, n.6. Accordingly, § 113(h) bars any\n\nclaim that challenges an ongoing CERCLA cleanup effort. Further, the language of\n\n§ 113(h) does not distinguish between federal and state claims or constitutional and\n\nstatutory claims; instead, it delays judicial review of any challenges to unfinished remedial\n\nEPA efforts. See Broward Gardens, 311 F.3d at 1075.\n\n¶44    The Ninth Circuit has provided clear guidance concerning what constitutes a\n\n“challenge” to a CERCLA cleanup effort. In Razore v. Tulalip Tribes, the court explained\n\nthat “[a]n action constitutes a challenge if it is related to the goals of the cleanup.” 66 F.3d\n\n236, 239 (9th Cir. 1995) (emphasis added). Challenges to CERCLA cleanups were found\n\nwhere the plaintiff seeks to dictate specific remedial actions, Hanford Downwinders, 71\n\nF.3d at 1482; to postpone cleanup, Fort Ord, 189 F.3d at 831; to impose additional\n\nreporting requirements on the cleanup, MESS, 47 F.3d at 330; and to terminate the\n\nRemedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and alter the method and order of\n\ncleanup, Razore, 66 F.3d at 239. Consistent with the Ninth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit has\n\nheld that a state claim is preempted by CERCLA if the “claim, or any portion thereof,\n\nstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of congressional objectives as encompassed\n\nin CERCLA.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1244. The Eleventh Circuit similarly explained\n\nthat “[t]o determine whether a suit interferes with, and thus challenges, a cleanup, courts\n\nlook to see if the relief requested will impact the remedial action selected.” Broward\n\nGardens, 311 F.3d at 1072. The Eighth Circuit held that a suit challenges a remedial action\n\nwithin the meaning of § 113(h) if it interferes with the implementation of a CERCLA\n\nremedy. Costner v. URS Consultants, Inc., 153 F.3d 667, 675 (8th Cir. 1998).\n\n\n                                              29\n\f¶45    The Ninth Circuit has also distinguished when a claim does not constitute a\n\nchallenge to a CERCLA cleanup effort. In Beck v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 62 F.3d 1240,\n\n1243 (9th Cir. 1995), the court held that a state law claim by water users seeking financial\n\ncompensation for lost crops and profits resulting from the EPA’s diversion of water was\n\nnot a challenge to the CERCLA cleanup plan; however, the water users’ claim for\n\ninjunctive relief to prevent ARCO from diverting the water was a challenge to the EPA\n\ncleanup. In ARCO Environmental Remediation, 213 F.3d at 1113, a state law claim for\n\naccess to public records and meetings did not relate to the goals of the EPA’s cleanup and\n\ntherefore did not constitute a challenge divesting the court of jurisdiction to entertain the\n\nclaim. The lawsuit did not alter cleanup requirements or environmental standards and did\n\nnot seek to delay or terminate the cleanup. Instead, the lawsuit involved the public’s right\n\nto information about the cleanup. ARCO Envtl. Remediation, 213 F.3d at 1115.\n\n¶46    CERCLA does not completely occupy the field of environmental regulation.\n\nCongress expressly declared that it had no intent for CERCLA to do so by enacting two\n\nsavings clauses within CERCLA upon which Property Owners rely. The first savings\n\nclause, 42 U.S.C. § 9614(a), provides:       “Nothing in this Act shall be construed or\n\ninterpreted as preempting any State from imposing any additional liability or requirements\n\nwith respect to the release of hazardous substances within such State.” The second, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9652(d) provides: “Nothing in this Act shall affect or modify in any way the\n\nobligations or liabilities of any person under other Federal or State law, including common\n\nlaw, with respect to releases of hazardous substances or other pollutants or contaminants.”\n\nFurthermore, Congress recognized the role of state law in hazardous waste cleanup when\n\n\n                                             30\n\fit addressed the overlap of CERCLA and state law in 42 U.S.C. § 9614(b), which provides,\n\nin relevant part, that “[a]ny person who receives compensation for removal costs or\n\ndamages or claims pursuant to any other Federal or State law shall be precluded from\n\nreceiving compensation for the same removal costs or damages or claims as provided in\n\nthis Act.” Congress clearly expressed “its intent that CERCLA should work in conjunction\n\nwith other federal and state hazardous waste laws in order to solve this country’s hazardous\n\nwaste cleanup problem.” United States v. Colorado, 990 F.2d 1565, 1575 (10th Cir. 1993);\n\naccord Manor Care, Inc. v. Yaskin, 950 F.2d 122, 125-26 (3d Cir. 1991). The Ninth Circuit\n\nalso explained that “Congress did not want § 113(h) to serve as a shield against litigation\n\nthat is unrelated to disputes over environmental standards.” Fort Ord, 189 F.3d at 831.4\n\n¶47    While a principle purpose of CERCLA’s savings clauses is to reinforce the right to\n\ndemand hazardous waste cleanup apart from CERCLA, a savings clause “is not intended\n\nto allow specific provisions of the statute that contains it to be nullified.” PMC, Inc. v.\n\nSherwin-Williams Co., 151 F.3d 610, 618 (7th Cir. 1998). See also Wyoming v. United\n\nStates, 279 F.3d 1214, 1234 (10th Cir. 2002) (quoting Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 529\n\nU.S. 861, 864, 120 S. Ct. 1913, 1916 (2000), for the proposition that “[t]he Supreme Court\n\nhas ‘repeatedly declined to give broad effect to savings clauses where doing so would upset\n\nthe careful regulatory scheme established by federal law’”). “CERCLA’s savings clause\n\nmust not be used to gut provisions of CERCLA.” PMC, 151 F.3d at 618. Moreover,\n\n\n\n4\n  For examples of state courts dismissing state law claims under § 113(h) of CERCLA, see O’Neal\nv. Department of the Army, 742 A.2d 1095, 1100 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1999), and Aztec Minerals Corp.\nv. Romer, 940 P.2d 1025, 1032-33 (Colo. Ct. App. 1996).\n\n\n                                              31\n\fCERCLA does not establish a “new font of law on which private parties could base claims\n\nfor personal and property injuries.” Artesian Water Co. v. Gov’t of New Castle Cnty., 659\n\nF. Supp. 1269, 1286 (D. Del. 1987), aff’d, 851 F.2d 643 (3d Cir. 1988) (internal quotations\n\nand citations omitted). The purpose of a savings clause “is merely to nix an inference that\n\nthe statute in which it appears is intended to be the exclusive remedy for harms caused by\n\nthe violation of the statute.” PMC, 151 F.3d at 618. Thus, CERCLA’s savings clause was\n\nenacted because Congress did not want to “wipe out people’s rights inadvertently, with the\n\npossible consequence of making the intended beneficiaries of the legislation worse off than\n\nbefore it was enacted. The passage of federal environmental laws was not intended to wipe\n\nout the common law of nuisance.” PMC, 151 F.3d at 618.\n\n¶48    Any state law claim raised pursuant to CERCLA’s savings clause which challenges\n\nthe remediation efforts of the EPA must wait until after the response actions are completed\n\nbecause CERCLA “protects the execution of a CERCLA plan during its pendency from\n\nlawsuits that might interfere with the expeditious cleanup effort.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d\n\nat 1249 (quoting MESS, 47 F.3d at 329) (emphasis in original). When the EPA selects a\n\nremedy, no challenge to the cleanup may occur prior to completion of the remedy. This is\n\ntrue even if the claim is made pursuant to state law and attempts to invoke the state court’s\n\njurisdiction through CERCLA’s savings clause. Federal courts have exclusive and original\n\njurisdiction over any CERCLA-related activity. As explained in Fort Ord, 189 F.3d at\n\n831, Congress made federal subject-matter jurisdiction broad, enacting a bar to jurisdiction\n\nthrough the provisions of § 113(h) during the pendency of a CERCLA cleanup effort. See\n\nalso Cannon v. Gates, 538 F.3d 1328, 1336 (10th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, if the state\n\n\n                                             32\n\fclaims call “into question the EPA’s remedial response plan, it is related to the goals of the\n\ncleanup, and thus constitutes a ‘challenge’ to the cleanup under [§ 113(h)].” New Mexico,\n\n467 F.3d at 1249.\n\n¶49    Neither a federal court considering CERCLA-related activity nor a state court\n\nconsidering a state claim pursuant to CERCLA’s savings clause has subject-matter\n\njurisdiction to consider the claim when the claim constitutes a challenge to CERCLA’s\n\ncleanup effort. It makes little difference that the claim originated in state court when the\n\nrelief sought constitutes a challenge. In New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1252, the Tenth Circuit\n\ndismissed state claims of public nuisance and negligence for lack of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction under § 113(h). In Cannon, 538 F.3d at 1334-36, the Tenth Circuit affirmed\n\nthe trial court’s dismissal of landowners’ claims under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 6901-81, concluding that § 113(h) stripped subject-matter jurisdiction from the\n\ntrial court to consider the claims. In Broward Gardens, 311 F.3d at 1076, the Eleventh\n\nCircuit affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of landowners’ claims because the court lacked\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the case because of § 113(h). In Hanford Downwinders,\n\n71 F.3d at 1484, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of claims for lack\n\nof subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim because of § 113(h). Given\n\nthe substantial weight of authority which establishes the matter as being one of\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, I am at a loss to understand how this Court can suggest, without\n\nany authority, that we “simply” allow “a jury of twelve Montanans” to “assess the merits\n\nof [the Property Owners’ restoration] plan” and then instruct any resulting damages “be\n\nplaced in a trust for the express purpose of effectuating the Property Owners’ restoration\n\n\n                                             33\n\fplan.” Opinion, ¶ 17. Most respectfully, the Property Owners should not be permitted to\n\nproceed to a jury trial when the District Court clearly lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over\n\nthe controversy. Indeed, any order denying ARCO’s motion would be reviewable as an\n\ninterlocutory order pursuant to M. R. App. P. 6(3)(c).\n\n¶50    Property Owners seek monetary damages for: (1) “Injury to and loss of use and\n\nenjoyment of real and personal property”; (2) “Loss of the value of real property . . . ”;\n\n(3) “Incidental and consequential damages, including relocation expenses and loss of rental\n\nincome and/or value”; (4) “Annoyance, inconvenience, and discomfort over the loss and\n\nprospective loss of property value . . . ”; and (5) “Expenses for and cost of investigation\n\nand restoration of real property” pursuant to Property Owners’ restoration plan. ARCO\n\ndoes not dispute that Property Owners may proceed on the first four types of damages,\n\nwhich are being made pursuant to nuisance, trespass and strict liability.5 ARCO does\n\ndispute that Property Owners may proceed on the fifth type of damage, contending that the\n\nDistrict Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because of the ongoing CERCLA cleanup\n\neffort and the provisions of § 113(h). Accordingly, pursuant to the aforementioned\n\nauthority, the District Court’s grant of summary judgment to Property Owners on their\n\nclaim for restoration damages must be reversed if Property Owners’ restoration plan\n\nconstitutes a challenge to the CERCLA cleanup effort at the Smelter Site. If Property\n\nOwners’ proposed restoration plan “relate[s] to the goals of the cleanup,” Razore, 66 F.3d\n\n\n5\n  Given the requirement that damages not be speculative, remote or conjectural, Sebena, 280 Mont.\nat 309, 930 P.2d at 53, it is difficult to comprehend how damages can be calculated prior to\ncompletion of CERCLA remedial efforts for those areas of compensation ARCO does not contest.\nSee New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1250. That issue, however, is not before the Court.\n\n\n                                               34\n\fat 239, it constitutes a challenge to the CERCLA cleanup effort and the District Court is\n\ndivested of jurisdiction.\n\n¶51    Property Owners assert claims based on contamination to properties located within\n\nthe legally defined boundaries of a federal Superfund site. The EPA issued its first\n\nadministrative order to ARCO in 1984, which required ARCO to perform a site-wide\n\nRI/FS. Following completion of the study in 1987, the EPA divided the Smelter Site into\n\nfive major sections called Operable Units, each relating to different cleanup remedies.\n\nProperty Owners seek to restore land contained within several of these sections. The EPA\n\ncontinues its cleanup efforts in the designated area consistent with its selected remedies.\n\nThe EPA estimates that active remediation of the Smelter Site will not be completed until\n\n2025. ARCO filed affidavits and reports from its expert, Richard E. Bartlett, supporting\n\nits position that cleanup is ongoing and that as recently as 2016 residential soils and pasture\n\nwere being cleaned to remove arsenic. ARCO also filed an Administrative Order on\n\nConsent, entered pursuant to CERCLA, that set forth how the cleanup effort was to\n\nproceed. As a result of monitoring and reexamination, the EPA has made amendments to\n\nits cleanup plan, primarily to incorporate the federal drinking water standard for arsenic\n\nfrom 18 ppb to 10 ppb. The EPA also added the action level for lead in 2013. The EPA\n\nasserts that it continues to monitor, modify, and reexamine remedies since the remedial\n\nplan was first implemented, which may result in additional amendments. Once the EPA\n\nremedy is completed on the Property Owners’ land, the soil will be capped or backfilled\n\nwith clean soil, vegetation, or other protective barrier. ARCO and the EPA maintain that\n\ntearing up the protective cap or layer of soil could increase dust transfer, bioavailability of\n\n\n                                              35\n\flead, and soil ingestion—all of which were concerns addressed by the EPA when it initially\n\ndesigned the cleanup plan. ARCO has filed affidavits and expert reports in support of its\n\nposition.   ARCO, the State, and local governments are currently negotiating a final\n\nsite-wide consent decree that will encompass all remaining remedies and cleanup work to\n\nbe conducted at the Smelter Site.\n\n¶52    Property Owners propose a different cleanup or restoration plan. Property Owners\n\ndo not dispute that their properties are located within the boundaries of the Superfund site.\n\nNor do Property Owners dispute that they seek “full restoration” of their property, which\n\nis different from that selected by the EPA. Although Property Owners and this Court\n\nconclude, without any analysis, that Property Owners are not seeking to “stop, delay, or\n\nchange the work EPA is doing,” Opinion, ¶ 15, the Property Owners’ plan is plainly\n\ncontrary to the EPA’s remediation plan. See, e.g., New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1249-50;\n\nMESS, 47 F.3d at 329. Property Owners’ experts, Richard Plaus and John Kane, advocate\n\na lower level of arsenic in the soil than that proposed by the EPA. Property Owners propose\n\nexcavating the soil to a deeper level and suggest the excavated soil be transported to\n\nSpokane, rather than local depositories. Property Owners also propose that a series of\n\nunderground trenches and barriers be constructed to capture and treat shallow groundwater.\n\nThe reactive barriers proposed by Property Owners would be 8,000 feet long, 15 feet deep,\n\n3 feet wide, and situated upgradient of the town. The barriers would contain enzymes\n\ndesigned to remove arsenic in the water, which the EPA maintains could unintentionally\n\ncontaminate both ground and surface water.\n\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\f¶53    A district court must determine whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would\n\nvest the court with subject-matter jurisdiction. Meagher v. Butte-Silver Bow City-County,\n\n2007 MT 129, ¶ 13, 337 Mont. 339, 160 P.3d 552. Summary judgment should be granted\n\n“‘if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,’ together\n\nwith any affidavits demonstrate that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and that\n\nthe party moving for summary judgment is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Stipe\n\nv. First Interstate Bank-Polson, 2008 MT 239, ¶ 10, 344 Mont. 435, 188 P.3d 1063\n\n(quoting M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). A defending party may be entitled to summary judgment on\n\na certain type or category of damages. See Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Ctr. Mont., Inc.,\n\n2008 MT 283, ¶ 54, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111. Here, at the risk of stating the obvious,\n\nProperty Owners request in their Third Amended Complaint “full restoration” of their\n\nproperties while a restoration-based remedial plan selected by the EPA is being\n\nimplemented. In addition, the affidavits and reports of each party’s expert witnesses\n\nestablish as a matter of law that Property Owners’ claim for restoration damages challenges\n\nthe EPA’s selected remedial action and that the cleanup is still ongoing. Indeed, the\n\nundisputed evidence shows the EPA rejected the soil and groundwater remedies proposed\n\nby Property Owners during the course of the EPA’s regulatory deliberations at the Smelter\n\nSite. In my opinion, the District Court erred, as a matter of law, in concluding that Property\n\nOwners’ claim for restoration damages did not constitute a challenge to the remedial action\n\nplan chosen by the EPA.\n\n¶54    I dissent from the Court’s conclusion that Property Owners’ claim for restoration\n\ndamages is not barred pursuant to the provisions of § 113(h). The issue before this Court\n\n\n                                             37\n\fis one of subject-matter jurisdiction which, if lacking, bars Property Owners from\n\nproceeding to trial on their claim for restoration damages. I would reverse because there\n\nis no genuine dispute of fact that Property Owners’ restoration claim conflicts with the\n\nongoing EPA investigation and CERCLA cleanup.6 The District Court, as a matter of\n\nfederal law, lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to consider Property Owners’ claim for\n\nrestoration damages.\n\n\n                                                   /S/ LAURIE McKINNON\n\n\n\n\n6 The question of whether Property Owners’ claim for restoration damages constitutes a challenge\nto CERCLA cleanup efforts is pivotal to resolution of many issues in this case. For example, in\nNew Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1250, the Tenth Circuit, having found that CERCLA’s cleanup efforts\nwere ongoing, determined that damages for common law public nuisance and negligence must be\naddressed at the conclusion of the EPA-ordered remediation. “Only then will we know the\neffectiveness of the cleanup and the precise extent of residual damage.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d at\n1250. Accordingly, I would not address ARCO’s contention, at this juncture, that Property Owners\nare PRPs under 42 U.S.C. § 9622(e)(6) (CERCLA § 122(e)(6)) and therefore precluded from\nproceeding with their chosen remedy.\n\n\n                                              38\n\f",

Atlantic Richfield Co. Relevant to\n\nthe issue before us, the action in the District Court concerns a claim for restoration damages\n\nbrought by property owners in and around the town of Opportunity, Montana (hereafter\n\nreferred to as “Property Owners”). We accepted supervisory control of this case for the\n\nlimited purpose of considering the District Court’s August 30, 2016 Order Denying\n\nARCO’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Property Owners’ Claim for Restoration\n\nDamages as Barred by CERCLA and Granting Property Owners’ Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment on ARCO’s CERCLA Preemption Affirmative Defenses (11th–13th). We\n\nrestate the issues as follows:\n\n       Issue One: Whether the Property Owners’ claim constitutes a challenge to EPA’s\n       selected remedy, and thus does not comply with CERCLA’s timing of review\n       provision.\n\n       Issue Two: Whether the Property Owners are “Potentially Responsible Parties,”\n       and thus cannot proceed with their chosen restoration activities without EPA\n       approval.\n\n       Issue Three: Whether the Property Owners’ claim otherwise conflicts with\n       CERCLA, and is thus preempted.\n\n                  PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶2     The Anaconda Smelter, originally constructed by the Anaconda Copper Mining\n\nCompany, processed copper ore from Butte for nearly one hundred years before shutting\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fdown in 1980.      Also in 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental\n\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. § 9601, et\n\nseq. Also known as “Superfund,” the purpose of CERCLA is to foster the cleanup of sites\n\ncontaminated by hazardous waste, and to protect human health and the environment. In\n\n1983, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) designated the area impacted by the\n\nAnaconda Smelter, now owned by ARCO, as a Superfund site. In 1984, EPA issued an\n\nadministrative order requiring ARCO to begin a remedial investigation at the Smelter Site.\n\nIn 1998, EPA selected a remedy pursuant to CERCLA that detailed ARCO’s cleanup\n\nresponsibilities moving forward.\n\n¶3     As part of ARCO’s cleanup responsibility, EPA required ARCO to remediate\n\nresidential yards within the Smelter Site harboring levels of arsenic exceeding 250 parts\n\nper million in soil, and to remediate all wells used for drinking water with levels of arsenic\n\nin excess of ten parts per billion. The Property Owners, a group of ninety-eight landowners\n\nlocated within the bounds of the Smelter Site, sought the opinion of outside experts to\n\ndetermine what actions would be necessary to fully restore their properties to\n\npre-contamination levels. The experts recommended the Property Owners remove the top\n\ntwo feet of soil from affected properties and install permeable walls to remove arsenic from\n\nthe groundwater. Both remedies required restoration work in excess of what the EPA\n\nrequired of ARCO in its selected remedy.\n\n¶4     The Property Owners filed this action in 2008, claiming common law trespass,\n\nnuisance, and strict liability against ARCO, and seeking restoration damages.            Any\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\frecovered restoration damages are to be placed in a trust account and distributed only for\n\nthe purpose of conducting restoration work.\n\n¶5     In 2013, ARCO moved for summary judgment on the grounds that CERCLA barred\n\nthe Property Owners’ claims. The District Court did not address ARCO’s CERCLA\n\npreemption issue because it dismissed the Property Owners’ case on the basis that their\n\nclaims were barred by the statute of limitations. The Property Owners appealed and we\n\naffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the District Court for further\n\nproceedings. Christian v. Atl.

On remand, the District Court denied all of ARCO’s contested motions for summary\n\njudgment. Among the orders denied was ARCO’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the\n\nProperty Owners’ Claim for Restoration Damages as Barred by CERCLA.                 ARCO\n\npetitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control, asking us to vacate four of the\n\nDistrict Court’s orders denying summary judgment and one order on a motion in limine.\n\nOn October 5, 2016, we issued an order granting the writ for the limited purpose of\n\nconsidering the District Court’s 2016 Order Denying ARCO’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment on Property Owners’ Claim for Restoration Damages as Barred by CERCLA\n\nand Granting Property Owners’ Motion for Summary Judgment on ARCO’s CERCLA\n\nPreemption Affirmative Defenses (11th–13th).\n\n¶6     The Property Owners bring several claims against ARCO: (1) injury to and loss of\n\nuse and enjoyment of real and personal property; (2) loss of the value of real property; (3)\n\nincidental and consequential damages, including relocation expenses and loss of rental\n\nincome and/or value; (4) annoyance, inconvenience, and discomfort over the loss and\n\n\n                                              5\n\fprospective loss of property value; and (5) expenses for and cost of investigation and\n\nrestoration of real property. ARCO concedes that the Property Owners may move forward\n\non their first four claims, but contend that the claim for restoration damages is preempted\n\nby CERCLA.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶7     We review de novo a district court’s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying\n\nthe same criteria of M.

Sunburst, ¶ 38. Texaco argued that the\n\nplaintiffs’ common law claim for restoration damages was preempted by Montana’s\n\nComprehensive Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility Act (CECRA), a state statute\n\nsimilar in purpose and scope to CERCLA. Sunburst, ¶ 55. We further noted in Sunburst\n\nthat “[a] presumption exists against statutory preemption of common law claims. A statute\n\ndoes not take away common law claims except to the extent that the statute expressly or by\n\nnecessary implication declares.” Sunburst, ¶ 51 (internal citations omitted). Accordingly,\n\nwe held: “[N]o conflict exists between DEQ’s supervisory role under CECRA and\n\nrestoration damages awarded under the common law. We further conclude that nothing in\n\nCECRA precludes a common law claim by necessary implication.” Sunburst, ¶ 59.\n\n¶9    ARCO argues that the Property Owners may not bring their state law claim for\n\nrestoration damages because the claim conflicts with various provisions of CERCLA, and\n\nthus are preempted.    Preemption is established expressly, through the unambiguous\n\nlanguage of Congress in statute, or impliedly through the doctrines of field preemption or\n\nconflict preemption. Oneok, Inc. v.

There is no field preemption in this case, as CERCLA expressly allows for\n\ncomplementary state laws, including common law, through a series of savings clauses:\n\n      Nothing in [CERCLA] shall affect or modify in any way the obligations or\n      liabilities of any person under other Federal or State law, including common\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f        law, with respect to releases of hazardous substances or other pollutants or\n        contaminants. . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9652(d).\n\n        Nothing in [CERCLA] shall be construed or interpreted as preempting any\n        State from imposing any additional liability or requirements with respect to\n        the release of hazardous substances within such State.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9614(a).\n\n¶10     ARCO advances three arguments regarding how it contends CERCLA bars the\n\nProperty Owners’ claim for restoration damages:          (1) Property Owners’ restoration\n\ndamages claim constitutes a direct challenge to EPA’s selected remedy and CERCLA’s\n\ntiming of review provision, 42 U.S.C. § 9613(h) (“CERCLA § 113(h)”), prevents this\n\nCourt from hearing challenges to an EPA remedy; (2) the Property Owners are “potentially\n\nresponsible parties” under CERCLA, and as such may not perform any restoration\n\nactivities without EPA approval; and (3) the Property Owners’ claim otherwise conflicts\n\nwith CERCLA and is barred under the doctrine of conflict preemption. We address each\n\nof these arguments in turn.\n\n¶11     Issue One: Whether the Property Owners’ claim constitutes a challenge to EPA’s\n        selected remedy, and thus does not comply with CERCLA’s timing of review\n        provision.\n\n¶12     ARCO cites CERCLA’s “timing of review” provision, § 113(h), for the proposition\n\nthat CERCLA expressly preempts the Property Owners’ claim by denying Montana courts\n\njurisdiction over any challenges to a CERCLA cleanup. Section 113(h) reads, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n        No Federal court shall have jurisdiction under Federal law other than under\n        section 1332 of title 28 (relating to diversity of citizenship jurisdiction) or\n        under State law which is applicable or relevant and appropriate under section\n\n                                              8\n\f       § 9621 of this title (relating to cleanup standards) to review any challenges\n       to removal or remedial action selected under section of § 9604 of this title,\n       or to review any order issued under section § 9606(a) of this title. . . .\n\nAt the outset, it bears noting that this statute begins: “No Federal court shall have\n\njurisdiction under Federal law . . . .” (Emphasis added). Conspicuously absent is any\n\nreference to state court jurisdiction over state law claims. It is well-established that “[i]n\n\nthe construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what\n\nis in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit\n\nwhat has been inserted.” Section 1-2-101, MCA.\n\n¶13    ARCO relies on a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case in which the Ninth Circuit\n\nread § 113(h) together with § 113(b) to conclude that Montana state courts lack jurisdiction\n\nover any claims that “constitute ‘a challenge to a CERCLA cleanup.’” ARCO Envtl.\n\nRemediation, LLC v.

The Ninth Circuit concluded that because § 113(b) grants federal courts “exclusive\n\noriginal jurisdiction over all controversies arising under [CERCLA],” it interpreted\n\n§ 113(h)’s reference to “challenges to removal or remedial action” to be a “controversy\n\narising under [CERCLA],” and thus exclusively within the jurisdiction of the federal\n\ncourts. ARCO Envtl. Remediation, 213 F.3d at 1115.\n\n¶14    Irrespective of this jurisdictional question, however, ARCO acknowledges that its\n\nargument for conflict preemption under § 113(h) turns on whether the Property Owners’\n\nclaim for restoration damages “challenges” the CERCLA cleanup. We have not previously\n\naddressed what constitutes a “challenge” within the context of § 113(h). In ARCO\n\nEnvironmental Remediation the Ninth Circuit defined a “challenge” as a claim that “is\n\n\n                                              9\n\frelated to the goals of the cleanup.” ARCO Envtl.

At a minimum, a\n\n“challenge” must be more than merely requiring ARCO to spend more money to clean up\n\nthe land for the Property Owners’ benefit, as the court in Taylor Farm noted. In this case,\n\nthe restoration damages Property Owners seek are to be placed in a trust account and used\n\nto further restore affected properties beyond the levels required by the EPA, and the\n\nrestoration work would be completed by the Property Owners themselves. To the extent\n\nthat EPA’s work is ongoing, the Property Owners are not seeking to interfere with that\n\nwork, nor are they seeking to stop, delay, or change the work EPA is doing. The Property\n\nOwners’ claim is exactly the sort contemplated in CERCLA’s savings clauses, and does\n\nnot present a “challenge” to EPA’s selected remedy. Absent a “challenge” to removal or\n\nremedial action selected in the CERCLA cleanup process, §§ 113(h) and (b) do not deprive\n\nMontana courts of jurisdiction to entertain state-law restoration claims.\n\n¶16    Despite ARCO’s efforts to overcomplicate this matter and recast what is, at its\n\nessence, a common law claim for damages into a challenge to EPA’s cleanup, the\n\nfundamental issue before us is one of timing. Specifically, when can private landowners\n\nbring a state common law claim for restoration damages for the purpose of cleaning up\n\ntheir own private property? The Dissent maintains that any such claim, if it relates to the\n\n\n                                             11\n\fgoals of the cleanup, must wait until the EPA has completed its work and moved on because\n\nCERCLA “protects the execution of a CERCLA plan during its pendency from lawsuits\n\nthat might interfere with the expeditious cleanup effort.” Dissent, ¶ 48, quoting McClellan\n\nEcological Seepage Situation v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"688768\"><a href=\"/opinion/688768/mcclellan-ecological-seepage-situation-mary-fisher-charles-yarbrough-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329 (9th Cir. 1995) (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as MESS) (emphasis in original). Even by the Dissent’s analysis, though, the\n\nProperty Owners’ claim does not constitute a challenge to EPA’s plan. The Dissent cites\n\na litany of cases from other jurisdictions in ostensible support of the contention that the\n\nProperty Owners’ damage claim constitutes a challenge to EPA’s remediation plan.\n\nDissent, ¶ 44. These cases are inapposite to the Property Owners’ claim presently before\n\nus. None of the cases cited by the Dissent, nor any of the cases cited by ARCO or the\n\nUnited States, involve a claim by private property owners, against another private party,\n\nseeking money damages for the purpose of restoring their own private property. The\n\nProperty Owners are not asking the Court “to dictate specific remedial actions.” The\n\nProperty Owners are not asking the Court to “impose additional reporting requirements on\n\nthe cleanup.” The Property Owners are not asking the Court to “terminate the Remedial\n\nInvestigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and alter the method and order of cleanup.”\n\nNothing in the Property Owners’ claim for restoration damages “stands as an obstacle to\n\nthe accomplishment of congressional objectives as encompassed in CERCLA,” unless\n\nCongress’s objective was to condemn, in perpetuity, the private property of an individual\n\nproperty owner because that property happened to have been contaminated by a third party.\n\n¶17    Put simply, the Property Owners are not asking the Court to interfere with the EPA’s\n\nplan. The Property Owners are not seeking to enjoin any of EPA’s activities, or requesting\n\n\n                                            12\n\fthat EPA be required to alter, delay, or expedite its plan in any fashion whatsoever. The\n\nProperty Owners are simply asking to be allowed to present their own plan to restore their\n\nown private property to a jury of twelve Montanans who will then assess the merits of that\n\nplan. If the jury awards restoration damages, those damages will be placed in a trust for\n\nthe express purpose of effectuating the Property Owners’ restoration plan. Indeed, any\n\nrestoration will be performed by the Property Owners themselves and will not seek to force\n\nthe EPA to do, or refrain from doing, anything at the Site.\n\n¶18    The Dissent contends that § 113(h) requires rejecting claims that challenge EPA’s\n\nongoing remedial action. Dissent, ¶ 43. What, if any, actual remedial action remains\n\nongoing is, at least, unclear. Even assuming there is something that would constitute\n\nongoing remedial action, however, this still does not morph the Property Owners’ claim\n\nfor restoration damages—for purposes of funding an eventual restoration according to the\n\nProperty Owners’ plan—into a challenge to EPA’s cleanup. As Justice Baker notes in her\n\nconcurrence, the United States’ counsel acknowledged during oral argument that some\n\naspects of the Property Owners’ restoration plan would not constitute a “challenge” within\n\nthe meaning of the law. Concurrence, ¶ 32. As to other aspects of the Property Owners’\n\nrestoration plan, even the federal government has to pull up stakes at some point and leave\n\nthese private property owners alone to attend to their own private property. If the Property\n\nOwners must wait for that eventuality to conclude their restoration plan, the history of this\n\ncase amply demonstrates that they have the patience for it.\n\n¶19    Whether or not the Property Owners succeed on their claim for restoration damages\n\nwill not affect, alter, or delay EPA’s work in any fashion. Likewise, EPA’s work, whether\n\n\n                                             13\n\fongoing or not, has no bearing on the success or failure of the Property Owners’ claim for\n\nrestoration damages on the merits. In Sunburst, we noted “that CECRA’s focus on cost\n\neffectiveness and limits on health-based standards differ from the factors to be considered\n\nin assessing damages under the common law.” Sunburst, ¶ 59. The same reasoning applies\n\nhere: CERCLA’s regulatory standards do not apply to the common law claim at issue. The\n\nDistrict Court has already recognized this fact when it granted the Property Owners’ motion\n\nin limine to preclude ARCO from presenting evidence regarding its compliance with EPA\n\nrequirements, and correctly noted that allowing such evidence at trial “pose[d] the clear\n\nrisk for ARCO to ‘cloak itself’ in the authority of the federal government.” See Sunburst,\n\n¶¶ 107, 121 (discussing Texaco’s efforts to cloak itself in the authority of the State of\n\nMontana in order to create confusion). That being noted, nothing in our holding here\n\nshould be construed as precluding ARCO from contesting the Property Owners’ restoration\n\ndamages claim on its own merits, just as it may contest the Property Owners’ other claims.\n\n¶20    The Property Owners’ claim for restoration damages in this case arises solely under\n\nstate common law, and does not implicate federal law or cleanup standards. The Property\n\nOwners are not seeking to compel EPA to do, or refrain from doing, any action. Therefore,\n\nthe Property Owners’ claim does not implicate § 113(h), nor does it implicate § 113(b).\n\nUnited States v.

Put simply, the PRP horse left the barn decades ago.\n\n¶25    The Property Owners have never entered into a voluntary settlement with the EPA.\n\nThere has never been a judicial determination that the Property Owners are responsible\n\nparties. The Property Owners are not currently, nor have they ever been, defendants in a\n\nCERCLA lawsuit in which they were found not to be entitled to statutory defenses. The\n\nEPA has not included the Property Owners as a defendant in the legal proceedings in this\n\nmatter, nor have they been party to any settlement agreements regarding cleanup\n\nproceedings. Despite the EPA never engaging the Property Owners as PRPs, ARCO now\n\nasks us to treat the Property Owners as PRPs—for the first time in these proceedings—\n\nsolely for the purpose of using § 122(e)(6) to bar their claim for restoration damages. We\n\ndecline to do so.\n\n¶26    Issue Three: Whether the Property Owners’ claim otherwise conflicts with\n       CERCLA, and is thus preempted.\n\n¶27    ARCO’s final argument is that other conflicts exist between CERCLA and the\n\nProperty Owners’ claim for restoration damages. ARCO proffers three lines of reasoning\n\nfor this argument.    First, ARCO argues that the EPA has sole authority to select\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fenvironmental remedies at Superfund sites, which would preclude alternative standards\n\nand remedies. To adopt this reasoning would be to ignore CERCLA’s savings clauses. As\n\nstated above, CERCLA’s savings clauses expressly contemplate the applicability of state\n\nlaw remedies. 42 U.S.C. §§ 9614(a), 9652(d). Second, ARCO contends there is an\n\n“unambiguous congressional intent to foreclose any state law remedy that challenges or\n\nobstructs EPA’s remedy at a Superfund site.” This argument fails for the same reason that\n\n§ 113(h) does not apply: the Property Owners’ claim does not prevent the EPA from\n\naccomplishing its goals at the ARCO Site. Lastly, ARCO again characterizes the Property\n\nOwners’ claim as a challenge to EPA’s selected remedy, and argues that the claim cannot\n\nproceed until EPA’s remedy is fully performed. Yet CERCLA’s savings clauses operate\n\nto preserve the Property Owners’ ability to pursue this claim. 42 U.S.C. § 9652(d)\n\n(“Nothing in [CERCLA] shall affect or modify in any way the obligations or liabilities of\n\nany person under other Federal or State law, including common law, with respect to\n\nreleases of hazardous substances or other pollutants or contaminants.” (emphasis added)).\n\nCERCLA does not expressly or impliedly preempt the Property Owners’ claim for\n\nrestoration damages in this matter.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶28    We conclude that the District Court did not err by Denying ARCO’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment on Property Owners’ Claim for Restoration Damages as Barred by\n\nCERCLA and Granting Property Owners’ Motion for Summary Judgment on ARCO’s\n\nCERCLA Preemption Affirmative Defenses (11th–13th). To be clear, ARCO is not\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fprecluded from contesting the merits of the Property Owners’ restoration plans. However,\n\nthat is an issue of fact to be resolved at trial.\n\n¶29    THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED:\n\n¶30    The District Court’s order Denying ARCO’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nProperty Owners’ Claim for Restoration Damages as Barred by CERCLA and Granting\n\nProperty Owners’ Motion for Summary Judgment on ARCO’s CERCLA Preemption\n\nAffirmative Defenses (11th–13th) is AFFIRMED.

SANDEFUR\n\n\nJustice Beth Baker, specially concurring.\n\n¶31    I understand the Court’s decision today to be a narrow one: CERCLA does not, as\n\na matter of law, preempt all common-law claims for restoration damages to the property of\n\na private individual. I agree with that conclusion and with the decision not to treat the\n\nProperty Owners as PRPs. I thus concur with the Court’s ruling that the District Court did\n\nnot err in denying ARCO’s motion for summary judgment on the restoration damages\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\fclaims. I appreciate the Dissent’s thorough analysis of CERCLA § 113(h), but do not agree\n\nthat it applies to foreclose the Property Owners’ claims.\n\n¶32    It became clear during oral argument in this case that the parties dispute whether\n\naspects of the Property Owners’ proposed restoration plan would conflict with actions\n\nARCO has taken in the Superfund cleanup effort. ARCO’s counsel characterized the\n\ndispute as one of jurisdiction, which empowers the trial court to determine underlying facts.\n\nHere, the trial court determined, for conflict preemption purposes, that the Property\n\nOwners’ claims did not stand as an obstacle to the CERCLA cleanup underway or impede\n\nEPA’s requirements on the site. Amicus curiae the United States argues that the purpose\n\nof CERCLA is to assure that EPA coordinates the cleanup between multiple stakeholders,\n\nso that the selected plan may move forward without obstruction, delay, or the diversion of\n\nresources that would accompany multiple individual plans and proposals. The government\n\nstresses that state-court lawsuits cannot, under § 113(h), supplement EPA’s selected\n\nresponse-action cleanup levels if such a proposed plan challenges or conflicts with EPA’s\n\nproposed remedy. The government recognizes, though, that CERCLA does not bar all\n\nstate-law claims by affected landowners, and its counsel acknowledged during oral\n\nargument that some aspects of the Property Owners’ plan would not be a “challenge”\n\nwithin the meaning of the law. The Property Owners’ counsel protested during argument\n\nthat it was the first time they had heard that some aspects of their plan would “undo” what\n\nalready has been done, and that in nine years of litigation no evidence had been presented\n\nto the District Court that the Property Owners’ plan conflicted with EPA’s remedy.\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f¶33    The large-scale environmental remediation projects made possible by CERCLA are\n\nintended, and are essential, to clean up severe widespread contamination resulting from\n\ndecades of historic mining practices that left expansive deposits of toxic tailings and\n\nparticulate fallout in floodplains, ranchlands, and soils. The massive cleanup efforts in\n\nwhich ARCO, EPA, and the State of Montana have engaged for more than thirty years have\n\ngone far to remediate the Superfund site. But CERLCA draws a distinction between\n\nremedial action and damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources. 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9607(a)(4)(A), (C). Outside of the remediation process, States may pursue\n\nrecovery of damages on behalf of the public as trustee of the state’s natural resources to\n\n“restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of such natural resources by the State.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9607(f)(1) (emphasis added). “CERCLA sets a floor, not a ceiling.” New Mexico\n\nv.

The dynamic between\n\nindividual restoration and CERCLA’s coordinated large-scale response does not give rise\n\nto preemption as a matter of law. “Tension between federal and state law is not enough to\n\nestablish conflict preemption.

A claim for restoration damages requires the Property Owners to prove\n\ntwo separate elements: (1) temporary injury and (2) reasons personal for the restoration.\n\nLampi, ¶ 29 (quoting Sunburst, ¶¶ 31-39). An injury is temporary “if the tortfeasor could\n\nrestore the destroyed property to substantially the condition in which it existed before the\n\ninjury. An injury that would cease to exist once remediation or restoration has been\n\ncompleted qualifies as temporary.” Lampi, ¶ 32 (internal citations omitted).

Finally, an “injured party is to be made as nearly whole as possible—\n\nbut not to realize a profit.

The Court acknowledges the District Court’s concern about allowing ARCO to\n\n“‘cloak itself’ in the authority of the federal government.” Opinion, ¶ 19. I write\n\nseparately to add that if ARCO contends that the Property Owners’ proposed remedy\n\nconflicts with or requires modification of measures ARCO already has taken to clean up\n\nthe site, ARCO must be able to address those conflicts in seeking to rebut the Property\n\nOwners’ claim on the essential elements of proof under our standards for a restoration\n\ndamages claim. What ARCO may not do at trial is point to the EPA’s selected remedy and\n\nsay, “We’ve done everything the government required; that’s all we need to do.” What\n\nARCO may do is offer evidence to support its claim that the Property Owners’ proposed\n\nrestoration plan is not feasible and thus does not qualify as a temporary injury. And the\n\nProperty Owners should have the opportunity to prove their claim that ARCO’s cleanup\n\nefforts to date have not returned their properties to substantially the same condition in\n\nwhich they were before the injury, but that the injury will cease to exist if their proposed\n\nrestoration plan is implemented. The Property Owners’ proposals should be considered by\n\nthe jury in the context of determining whether ARCO is liable for their alleged injuries and\n\nwhether those injuries are compensable by an award of restoration damages. Evidence on\n\nthe issue of temporary injury may well overlap with the evidence required to show,\n\npursuant to our holding in Atlantic Richfield Co., ¶ 77, whether the continuing tort doctrine\n\ntolled the period of limitations for the Property Owners’ claims. It makes sense to allow\n\n\n                                             22\n\fthe parties to develop the evidence for the jury’s consideration of these issues and a record\n\nthat may be reviewed, if necessary, on appeal from any final judgment.\n\n\n                                                      /S/ BETH BAKER\n\n\nJustice Laurie McKinnon, dissenting.\n\n¶37    Property Owners seek monetary damages for state law claims of nuisance, trespass,\n\nand strict liability. ARCO does not contest that litigation of these state law claims may\n\nproceed during the pendency of the CERCLA cleanup process and, accordingly, that issue\n\nis not before the Court. ARCO does contend that Property Owners’ claim for restoration\n\ndamages proposes a different cleanup plan than that chosen by the EPA, thus constituting\n\na challenge which is preempted by CERCLA. In my view, Property Owners’ restoration\n\nplan, which includes digging an 8,000-foot trench for a groundwater wall and removing\n\n650,000 tons of soil over a period of years, would conflict with the ongoing EPA\n\ninvestigation and CERCLA cleanup.1 The Court’s conclusion that, during the pendency of\n\na CERCLA cleanup effort, a jury may determine restoration damages and place the amount\n\nof money so determined in a trust for future restoration efforts, Opinion, ¶ 17, is not only\n\n\n\n\n1  To recover restoration damages under Montana law, the plaintiff must present evidence and\nconvince the fact-finder that he will actually conduct the restoration upon which the restoration\nclaim is based. Lampi, ¶ 31 (“The reasons personal rule requires plaintiff to establish that the\naward actually will be used for restoration . . . .”); Sunburst, ¶ 43; McEwen, ¶ 50. It is the actual\nperformance of Property Owners’ restoration plan—a prerequisite to their damage award—that\nimpermissibly challenges the EPA’s remedy. For purposes of brevity, I do not address other\nprovisions of CERCLA which ARCO asserts would bar Property Owners from completing their\nrestoration plan.\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\finconsistent with CERCLA and federal precedent, but has no authority in Montana law.2\n\nProperty Owners may not “achieve indirectly through the threat of monetary damages . . .\n\nwhat [they] cannot obtain directly through mandatory injunctive relief incompatible with\n\nthe ongoing CERCLA-mandated remediation.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1250.

In Sunburst,\nthere was no question that Montana state courts had subject-matter jurisdiction over CERCLA and\ncommon law claims. Here, however, CERCLA-related activities are the exclusive, original\njurisdiction of the federal courts and a challenge in state court to the chosen EPA remedy implicates\nthe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\n3\n  CERCLA vests authority in the President, who, in turn, has delegated most of his functions and\nauthority to the EPA. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 9606(c), 9615; 40 C.F.R. § 300.100.\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f“CERCLA is best known as setting forth a comprehensive mechanism to cleanup\n\nhazardous waste sites under a restoration-based approach.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1244\n\n(citation omitted; emphasis added).

Remedial actions generally are “long-term or permanent containment or\n\ndisposal programs” while removal actions are “typically short-term cleanup\n\narrangements.” Schaefer v.

CERCLA defines “remedial action” as:\n\n\n                                             25\n\f      [T]hose actions consistent with permanent remedy taken instead of or in\n      addition to removal actions in the event of a release or threatened release of\n      a hazardous substance into the environment, to prevent or minimize the\n      release of hazardous substances so that they do not migrate to cause\n      substantial danger to present or future public health or welfare or the\n      environment. The term includes, but is not limited to, such actions at the\n      location of the release as storage, confinement, perimeter protection using\n      dikes, trenches, or ditches, clay cover, neutralization, cleanup of released\n      hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials, recycling or\n      reuse, diversion, destruction, segregation of reactive wastes, dredging or\n      excavations, repair or replacement of leaking containers, collection of\n      leachate and runoff, onsite treatment or incineration, provision of alternative\n      water supplies, and any monitoring reasonably required to assure that such\n      actions protect the public health and welfare and the environment. The term\n      includes the costs of permanent relocation of residents and businesses and\n      community facilities where the President determines that, alone or in\n      combination with other measures, such relocation is more cost-effective than\n      and environmentally preferable to the transportation, storage, treatment,\n      destruction, or secure disposition offsite of hazardous substances, or may\n      otherwise be necessary to protect public health or welfare; the term includes\n      offsite transport and offsite storage, treatment, destruction, or secure\n      disposition of hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 9601(24) (emphasis added).\n\n¶40   CERCLA defines “remove” or “removal” as:\n\n      [T]he cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances from the\n      environment, such actions as may be necessary . . . to monitor, assess, and\n      evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous substances, the disposal\n      of removed material, or the taking of such other actions as may be necessary\n      to prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or\n      to the environment, which may otherwise result from a release or threat of\n      release.

Hanford\n\nDownwinders, 71 F.3d at 1474. Second, cleanup activity explicitly classified in CERCLA\n\nas a “response” is, by definition, a removal or remedial action. See 42 U.S.C. § 9601(25)\n\n(defining “response” as a “removal” or “remedial action”). Finally, “even if action taken\n\nat a CERCLA site is not referred to in the statute as a removal or remedial action or a\n\nresponse action, the Timing of Review provision will still apply if the action satisfies\n\nCERCLA’s definition of ‘removal’ or ‘remedial.’” Hanford Downwinders, 71 F.3d at\n\n1474.\n\n¶42     CERCLA provides that “the United States district courts shall have exclusive\n\noriginal jurisdiction over all controversies arising under [CERCLA].” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(b).\n\nSection 113(h) of CERCLA, titled “Timing of review,” provides an exception to federal\n\njurisdiction during the pendency of a CERCLA removal or remedial action: “No Federal\n\ncourt shall have jurisdiction under Federal law . . . or under State law . . . to review any\n\nchallenges to removal or remedial action . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(h). Section 113(h) clearly\n\nand unequivocally precludes contemporaneous challenges to CERCLA cleanups,\n\nregardless of whether the challenge is made pursuant to federal or state law.

Fort Ord Toxics Project v. Cal. EPA,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765933\"><a href=\"/opinion/765933/fort-ord-toxics-project-inc-california-public-interest-research-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832 (9th Cir. 1999). In Fort Ord Toxics Project, the Ninth Circuit observed\n\nthat “by granting district courts exclusive jurisdiction over all controversies arising under\n\nCERCLA, Congress used language more expansive than would be necessary if it intended\n\nto limit exclusive jurisdiction solely to those claims created by CERCLA.” Fort Ord, 189\n\nF.3d at 832 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n¶43    The Ninth Circuit explained, “Congress concluded that the need for [swift execution\n\nof CERCLA cleanup plans] was paramount, and that peripheral disputes, including those\n\nover what measures actually are necessary to clean-up the site and remove the hazard, may\n\nnot be brought while the cleanup is in progress.” MESS, 47 F.3d at 329 (internal quotations\n\nand citations omitted). Accordingly, § 113(h) “protects the execution of a CERCLA plan\n\nduring its pendency from lawsuits that might interfere with the expeditious cleanup effort.\n\nThis result furthers the policy underlying CERCLA by allowing a quick response to serious\n\nhazards.” MESS, 47 F.3d at 329 (emphasis in original). The court explained in MESS:\n\n       We recognize that the application of Section 113(h) may in some cases delay\n       judicial review for years, if not permanently, and may result in irreparable\n       harm to other important interests. Whatever its likelihood, such a possibility\n       is for legislators, and not judges, to address. We must presume that Congress\n       has already balanced all concerns and concluded that the interest in removing\n       the hazard of toxic waste from Superfund sites clearly outweighs the risk of\n       irreparable harm.\n\nMESS, 47 F.3d at 329 (internal quotations, citations, and footnote omitted). In MESS, the\n\ncourt was careful to explain that it was not deciding “whether or to what extent the district\n\ncourt can entertain MESS’s various claims after implementation of the CERCLA cleanup\n\n\n                                             28\n\fat McClellan is complete.” MESS, 47 F.3d at 329, n.6. Accordingly, § 113(h) bars any\n\nclaim that challenges an ongoing CERCLA cleanup effort. Further, the language of\n\n§ 113(h) does not distinguish between federal and state claims or constitutional and\n\nstatutory claims; instead, it delays judicial review of any challenges to unfinished remedial\n\nEPA efforts. See Broward Gardens, 311 F.3d at 1075.\n\n¶44    The Ninth Circuit has provided clear guidance concerning what constitutes a\n\n“challenge” to a CERCLA cleanup effort. In Razore v. Tulalip Tribes, the court explained\n\nthat “[a]n action constitutes a challenge if it is related to the goals of the cleanup.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"704078\"><a href=\"/opinion/704078/josie-razore-john-banchero-v-the-tulalip-tribes-of-washington-the-tulalip/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (9th Cir. 1995) (emphasis added). Challenges to CERCLA cleanups were found\n\nwhere the plaintiff seeks to dictate specific remedial actions, Hanford Downwinders, 71\n\nF.3d at 1482; to postpone cleanup, Fort Ord, 189 F.3d at 831; to impose additional\n\nreporting requirements on the cleanup, MESS, 47 F.3d at 330; and to terminate the\n\nRemedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and alter the method and order of\n\ncleanup, Razore, 66 F.3d at 239. Consistent with the Ninth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit has\n\nheld that a state claim is preempted by CERCLA if the “claim, or any portion thereof,\n\nstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of congressional objectives as encompassed\n\nin CERCLA.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1244. The Eleventh Circuit similarly explained\n\nthat “[t]o determine whether a suit interferes with, and thus challenges, a cleanup, courts\n\nlook to see if the relief requested will impact the remedial action selected.” Broward\n\nGardens, 311 F.3d at 1072. The Eighth Circuit held that a suit challenges a remedial action\n\nwithin the meaning of § 113(h) if it interferes with the implementation of a CERCLA\n\nremedy. Costner v.

In Beck v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701830\"><a href=\"/opinion/701830/thomas-a-beck-melvin-r-beck-robert-evans-v-atlantic-richfield-company-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1243 (9th Cir. 1995), the court held that a state law claim by water users seeking financial\n\ncompensation for lost crops and profits resulting from the EPA’s diversion of water was\n\nnot a challenge to the CERCLA cleanup plan; however, the water users’ claim for\n\ninjunctive relief to prevent ARCO from diverting the water was a challenge to the EPA\n\ncleanup. In ARCO Environmental Remediation, 213 F.3d at 1113, a state law claim for\n\naccess to public records and meetings did not relate to the goals of the EPA’s cleanup and\n\ntherefore did not constitute a challenge divesting the court of jurisdiction to entertain the\n\nclaim. The lawsuit did not alter cleanup requirements or environmental standards and did\n\nnot seek to delay or terminate the cleanup. Instead, the lawsuit involved the public’s right\n\nto information about the cleanup. ARCO Envtl. Remediation, 213 F.3d at 1115.\n\n¶46    CERCLA does not completely occupy the field of environmental regulation.\n\nCongress expressly declared that it had no intent for CERCLA to do so by enacting two\n\nsavings clauses within CERCLA upon which Property Owners rely. The first savings\n\nclause, 42 U.S.C. § 9614(a), provides:       “Nothing in this Act shall be construed or\n\ninterpreted as preempting any State from imposing any additional liability or requirements\n\nwith respect to the release of hazardous substances within such State.” The second, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 9652(d) provides: “Nothing in this Act shall affect or modify in any way the\n\nobligations or liabilities of any person under other Federal or State law, including common\n\nlaw, with respect to releases of hazardous substances or other pollutants or contaminants.”\n\nFurthermore, Congress recognized the role of state law in hazardous waste cleanup when\n\n\n                                             30\n\fit addressed the overlap of CERCLA and state law in 42 U.S.C. § 9614(b), which provides,\n\nin relevant part, that “[a]ny person who receives compensation for removal costs or\n\ndamages or claims pursuant to any other Federal or State law shall be precluded from\n\nreceiving compensation for the same removal costs or damages or claims as provided in\n\nthis Act.” Congress clearly expressed “its intent that CERCLA should work in conjunction\n\nwith other federal and state hazardous waste laws in order to solve this country’s hazardous\n\nwaste cleanup problem.” United States v.

The purpose of a savings clause “is merely to nix an inference that\n\nthe statute in which it appears is intended to be the exclusive remedy for harms caused by\n\nthe violation of the statute.” PMC, 151 F.3d at 618. Thus, CERCLA’s savings clause was\n\nenacted because Congress did not want to “wipe out people’s rights inadvertently, with the\n\npossible consequence of making the intended beneficiaries of the legislation worse off than\n\nbefore it was enacted. The passage of federal environmental laws was not intended to wipe\n\nout the common law of nuisance.” PMC, 151 F.3d at 618.\n\n¶48    Any state law claim raised pursuant to CERCLA’s savings clause which challenges\n\nthe remediation efforts of the EPA must wait until after the response actions are completed\n\nbecause CERCLA “protects the execution of a CERCLA plan during its pendency from\n\nlawsuits that might interfere with the expeditious cleanup effort.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d\n\nat 1249 (quoting MESS, 47 F.3d at 329) (emphasis in original). When the EPA selects a\n\nremedy, no challenge to the cleanup may occur prior to completion of the remedy. This is\n\ntrue even if the claim is made pursuant to state law and attempts to invoke the state court’s\n\njurisdiction through CERCLA’s savings clause. Federal courts have exclusive and original\n\njurisdiction over any CERCLA-related activity. As explained in Fort Ord, 189 F.3d at\n\n831, Congress made federal subject-matter jurisdiction broad, enacting a bar to jurisdiction\n\nthrough the provisions of § 113(h) during the pendency of a CERCLA cleanup effort. See\n\nalso Cannon v. Gates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171151\"><a href=\"/opinion/171151/cannon-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1336 (10th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, if the state\n\n\n                                             32\n\fclaims call “into question the EPA’s remedial response plan, it is related to the goals of the\n\ncleanup, and thus constitutes a ‘challenge’ to the cleanup under [§ 113(h)].” New Mexico,\n\n467 F.3d at 1249.\n\n¶49    Neither a federal court considering CERCLA-related activity nor a state court\n\nconsidering a state claim pursuant to CERCLA’s savings clause has subject-matter\n\njurisdiction to consider the claim when the claim constitutes a challenge to CERCLA’s\n\ncleanup effort. It makes little difference that the claim originated in state court when the\n\nrelief sought constitutes a challenge. In New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1252, the Tenth Circuit\n\ndismissed state claims of public nuisance and negligence for lack of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction under § 113(h). In Cannon, 538 F.3d at 1334-36, the Tenth Circuit affirmed\n\nthe trial court’s dismissal of landowners’ claims under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 6901-81, concluding that § 113(h) stripped subject-matter jurisdiction from the\n\ntrial court to consider the claims. In Broward Gardens, 311 F.3d at 1076, the Eleventh\n\nCircuit affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of landowners’ claims because the court lacked\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the case because of § 113(h). In Hanford Downwinders,\n\n71 F.3d at 1484, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of claims for lack\n\nof subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim because of § 113(h). Given\n\nthe substantial weight of authority which establishes the matter as being one of\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, I am at a loss to understand how this Court can suggest, without\n\nany authority, that we “simply” allow “a jury of twelve Montanans” to “assess the merits\n\nof [the Property Owners’ restoration] plan” and then instruct any resulting damages “be\n\nplaced in a trust for the express purpose of effectuating the Property Owners’ restoration\n\n\n                                             33\n\fplan.” Opinion, ¶ 17. Most respectfully, the Property Owners should not be permitted to\n\nproceed to a jury trial when the District Court clearly lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over\n\nthe controversy. Indeed, any order denying ARCO’s motion would be reviewable as an\n\ninterlocutory order pursuant to M. R. App. P. 6(3)(c).\n\n¶50    Property Owners seek monetary damages for: (1) “Injury to and loss of use and\n\nenjoyment of real and personal property”; (2) “Loss of the value of real property . . . ”;\n\n(3) “Incidental and consequential damages, including relocation expenses and loss of rental\n\nincome and/or value”; (4) “Annoyance, inconvenience, and discomfort over the loss and\n\nprospective loss of property value . . . ”; and (5) “Expenses for and cost of investigation\n\nand restoration of real property” pursuant to Property Owners’ restoration plan. ARCO\n\ndoes not dispute that Property Owners may proceed on the first four types of damages,\n\nwhich are being made pursuant to nuisance, trespass and strict liability.5 ARCO does\n\ndispute that Property Owners may proceed on the fifth type of damage, contending that the\n\nDistrict Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because of the ongoing CERCLA cleanup\n\neffort and the provisions of § 113(h). Accordingly, pursuant to the aforementioned\n\nauthority, the District Court’s grant of summary judgment to Property Owners on their\n\nclaim for restoration damages must be reversed if Property Owners’ restoration plan\n\nconstitutes a challenge to the CERCLA cleanup effort at the Smelter Site.

That issue, however, is not before the Court.\n\n\n                                               34\n\fat 239, it constitutes a challenge to the CERCLA cleanup effort and the District Court is\n\ndivested of jurisdiction.\n\n¶51    Property Owners assert claims based on contamination to properties located within\n\nthe legally defined boundaries of a federal Superfund site. The EPA issued its first\n\nadministrative order to ARCO in 1984, which required ARCO to perform a site-wide\n\nRI/FS. Following completion of the study in 1987, the EPA divided the Smelter Site into\n\nfive major sections called Operable Units, each relating to different cleanup remedies.\n\nProperty Owners seek to restore land contained within several of these sections. The EPA\n\ncontinues its cleanup efforts in the designated area consistent with its selected remedies.\n\nThe EPA estimates that active remediation of the Smelter Site will not be completed until\n\n2025. ARCO filed affidavits and reports from its expert, Richard E. Bartlett, supporting\n\nits position that cleanup is ongoing and that as recently as 2016 residential soils and pasture\n\nwere being cleaned to remove arsenic. ARCO also filed an Administrative Order on\n\nConsent, entered pursuant to CERCLA, that set forth how the cleanup effort was to\n\nproceed. As a result of monitoring and reexamination, the EPA has made amendments to\n\nits cleanup plan, primarily to incorporate the federal drinking water standard for arsenic\n\nfrom 18 ppb to 10 ppb. The EPA also added the action level for lead in 2013. The EPA\n\nasserts that it continues to monitor, modify, and reexamine remedies since the remedial\n\nplan was first implemented, which may result in additional amendments. Once the EPA\n\nremedy is completed on the Property Owners’ land, the soil will be capped or backfilled\n\nwith clean soil, vegetation, or other protective barrier. ARCO and the EPA maintain that\n\ntearing up the protective cap or layer of soil could increase dust transfer, bioavailability of\n\n\n                                              35\n\flead, and soil ingestion—all of which were concerns addressed by the EPA when it initially\n\ndesigned the cleanup plan. ARCO has filed affidavits and expert reports in support of its\n\nposition.   ARCO, the State, and local governments are currently negotiating a final\n\nsite-wide consent decree that will encompass all remaining remedies and cleanup work to\n\nbe conducted at the Smelter Site.\n\n¶52    Property Owners propose a different cleanup or restoration plan. Property Owners\n\ndo not dispute that their properties are located within the boundaries of the Superfund site.\n\nNor do Property Owners dispute that they seek “full restoration” of their property, which\n\nis different from that selected by the EPA. Although Property Owners and this Court\n\nconclude, without any analysis, that Property Owners are not seeking to “stop, delay, or\n\nchange the work EPA is doing,” Opinion, ¶ 15, the Property Owners’ plan is plainly\n\ncontrary to the EPA’s remediation plan. See, e.g., New Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1249-50;\n\nMESS, 47 F.3d at 329. Property Owners’ experts, Richard Plaus and John Kane, advocate\n\na lower level of arsenic in the soil than that proposed by the EPA. Property Owners propose\n\nexcavating the soil to a deeper level and suggest the excavated soil be transported to\n\nSpokane, rather than local depositories. Property Owners also propose that a series of\n\nunderground trenches and barriers be constructed to capture and treat shallow groundwater.\n\nThe reactive barriers proposed by Property Owners would be 8,000 feet long, 15 feet deep,\n\n3 feet wide, and situated upgradient of the town. The barriers would contain enzymes\n\ndesigned to remove arsenic in the water, which the EPA maintains could unintentionally\n\ncontaminate both ground and surface water.\n\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\f¶53    A district court must determine whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would\n\nvest the court with subject-matter jurisdiction.

Here, at the risk of stating the obvious,\n\nProperty Owners request in their Third Amended Complaint “full restoration” of their\n\nproperties while a restoration-based remedial plan selected by the EPA is being\n\nimplemented. In addition, the affidavits and reports of each party’s expert witnesses\n\nestablish as a matter of law that Property Owners’ claim for restoration damages challenges\n\nthe EPA’s selected remedial action and that the cleanup is still ongoing. Indeed, the\n\nundisputed evidence shows the EPA rejected the soil and groundwater remedies proposed\n\nby Property Owners during the course of the EPA’s regulatory deliberations at the Smelter\n\nSite. In my opinion, the District Court erred, as a matter of law, in concluding that Property\n\nOwners’ claim for restoration damages did not constitute a challenge to the remedial action\n\nplan chosen by the EPA.\n\n¶54    I dissent from the Court’s conclusion that Property Owners’ claim for restoration\n\ndamages is not barred pursuant to the provisions of § 113(h). The issue before this Court\n\n\n                                             37\n\fis one of subject-matter jurisdiction which, if lacking, bars Property Owners from\n\nproceeding to trial on their claim for restoration damages. I would reverse because there\n\nis no genuine dispute of fact that Property Owners’ restoration claim conflicts with the\n\nongoing EPA investigation and CERCLA cleanup.6 The District Court, as a matter of\n\nfederal law, lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to consider Property Owners’ claim for\n\nrestoration damages.\n\n\n                                                   /S/ LAURIE McKINNON\n\n\n\n\n6 The question of whether Property Owners’ claim for restoration damages constitutes a challenge\nto CERCLA cleanup efforts is pivotal to resolution of many issues in this case. For example, in\nNew Mexico, 467 F.3d at 1250, the Tenth Circuit, having found that CERCLA’s cleanup efforts\nwere ongoing, determined that damages for common law public nuisance and negligence must be\naddressed at the conclusion of the EPA-ordered remediation. “Only then will we know the\neffectiveness of the cleanup and the precise extent of residual damage.” New Mexico, 467 F.3d at\n1250. Accordingly, I would not address ARCO’s contention, at this juncture, that Property Owners\nare PRPs under 42 U.S.C. § 9622(e)(6) (CERCLA § 122(e)(6)) and therefore precluded from\nproceeding with their chosen remedy.\n\n\n                                              38\n\f</pre>",
