Reyes, Presiding\n\n\n                                      May 2, 2016\n\n                           MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                  Before QUINN, C.J., and CAMPBELL and PIRTLE, JJ.\n\n\n      Appellant, University Medical Center Physician Network Services (PNS), appeals\n\nfrom a judgment entered in favor of Appellee, Edward Leins, following a jury trial, in a\n\nlawsuit alleging multiple causes of action. PNS asserts (1) the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s finding that PNS and Leins agreed that PNS\n\nwould follow its physician grievance policies and procedures when disciplining Leins, (2)\n\nthe two written agreements at issue cannot be properly construed to create a contract\n\fbetween Leins and PNS to follow PNS’s grievance policies and procedures, (3) the\n\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the jury’s damages award, (4) the evidence is\n\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s award of attorney’s fees, and (5)\n\nthe trial court’s judgment awarding attorney’s fees to Leins for proceedings before the\n\nSupreme Court is not supported by the verdict of the jury. We affirm in part, reverse\n\nand render in part, and reverse and remand in part.\n\n\n        BACKGROUND\n\n        In May 2013, Leins filed his First Amended Petition alleging PNS and its Chief\n\nExecutive Officer, Paul Acreman, violated the Texas Whistleblower Act, breached their\n\ncontract with him, defamed and libeled him, tortiously interfered with his contractual\n\nrelations, and breached a fiduciary duty owed to him.1 Following a verdict in Leins’s\n\nfavor as to the breach of contract cause of action, the trial court issued its judgment\n\nawarding him $109,000 in damages,2 reasonable attorney’s fees through trial of\n\n$69,000, together with an additional $25,000 in attorney’s fees through appeal to this\n\ncourt, and $50,000 in fees for representation before the Supreme Court.3\n\n\n        There are two agreements at issue here: (1) an Agreement for Physician Staffing\n\nServices (herein the Physician Staffing Agreement) between PNS and Texas Tech\n\nUniversity Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC), wherein TTUHSC agreed to provide\n\nphysicians for clinics under PNS’s management and control, and (2) a Physician\n\n        1\n         Paul Acreman was originally named as an additional defendant; however, he was subsequently\ndismissed.\n        2\n           The verdict of the jury awarded Leins $9,000 for “[l]ost income, benefits, and other expenses\nsustained in the past” and $100,000 for “[l]ost income, benefits, and other expenses that, in reasonable\nprobability, will be sustained in the future.”\n        3\n        The trial court’s judgment reduced the jury’s verdict for attorney’s fees through an appeal to the\nSupreme Court from $275,000 down to $50,000.\n\n                                                    2\n\fEmployment Agreement between Leins and TTUHSC, wherein Leins agreed to engage\n\nin full-time duties as a medical practitioner in PNS’s medical offices, on behalf of\n\nTTUHSC, in satisfaction of TTUHSC’s duties under the Physician Staffing Agreement.\n\n\n      In July 2002, the Physician Staffing Agreement was executed by TTUHSC’s\n\nExecutive Vice President and PNS’s Chief Executive Officer.       TTUHSC and PNS\n\n“enter[ed] into a written agreement for the terms of each physician placement, and the\n\nagreement shall be an attachment to this Agreement.”        (Emphasis added).     The\n\nattachment would document “the identity of the TTUHSC physician, location of the\n\nmedical-office, expected hours of service, compensation to TTUHSC, and any other\n\nterms agreed upon by the parties.”      (Emphasis added).     The Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement also stated “[t]he Agreement and any Attachments contain the entire\n\nagreement and understanding between the parties concerning the subject matter of this\n\nAgreement. The terms of the Agreement shall apply to each Attachment. If there is a\n\nconflict between the terms of the Agreement and any Attachment, the terms of the\n\nAttachment shall prevail.” (Emphasis added). Under the terms of the Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement, TTUHSC would select physicians “in consultation with, and final approval\n\nof, PNS.” PNS was also responsible to pay the cost of using any recruiting firms and\n\nany cost associated with moving a physician to Lubbock.\n\n\n      The Physician Staffing Agreement described such physicians as “employees or\n\nindependent contractors of TTUHSC and not agents or employees of [University\n\nMedical Center] or PNS.” However, PNS was responsible for “supervis[ing], operat[ing],\n\nand manag[ing]” each medical clinic. PNS was also tasked with “establish[ing] and\n\nimplement[ing] the medical office’s operating policies and standards of operation,\n\n                                          3\n\fservices, maintenance, pricing, and other policies affecting the medical office.” The\n\nAgreement encouraged the participation of physicians in the development of policies\n\nand standards for each office. PNS and TTUHSC also agreed to designate compliance\n\nofficers to enforce the policies, procedures, and regulations of each party.\n\n\n       The Agreement authorized PNS to remove a physician “for cause,” and upon\n\nwritten notice to TTUHSC, PNS was empowered to remove a physician for “repeated\n\nfailure to perform the duties required by the [Physician Staffing Agreement] or the\n\nphysician’s failure or refusal to comply with PNS’s policies, standards and regulations.”\n\n(Emphasis added). It further provided that “[e]ither party may remove a physician from\n\na medical office without cause, subject to the terms of each Attachment.” Under the\n\nterms of the agreement, PNS was responsible to pay TTUHSC an agreed-upon annual\n\nbase compensation for physician salaries, benefits, professional liability insurance,\n\ncontinuing medical education, and administrative costs. In turn, TTUHSC was solely\n\nresponsible for paying the agreed-upon salaries of the assigned physicians.\n\n\n       In January 2010, Leins and TTUHSC executed an agreement whereby Leins\n\nagreed to engage as a medical practitioner at the Urgent Care Center at Kingspark in\n\nLubbock, Texas, “pursuant to the [Physician Staffing Agreement].” (Emphasis added.)\n\nUnder a subsection of the Physician Employment Agreement entitled “PNS Staffing,”\n\nthe parties agreed that the Physician Employment Agreement was “made in conjunction\n\nwith the [Physician Staffing Agreement] under which [Leins was] assigned to a PNS\n\nClinic . . . . “ (Emphasis added). The agreement further acknowledged that Leins’s\n\nservices would be “managed by” PNS.              The Physician Employment Agreement\n\ncommenced on August 1, 2010, and ended July 31, 2011, with the provision that the\n\n                                             4\n\fagreement would renew automatically each August 1st on a year-to-year basis unless\n\nterminated in accordance with the terms of that agreement. Paragraph 10.1.2 of that\n\nagreement provided that it could be “terminated without cause upon 90 days written\n\nnotice” to Leins.\n\n\n       Under the Physician Employment Agreement, Leins agreed to assist TTUHSC\n\nand PNS in quality improvement activities and to actively participate and cooperate with\n\nthe marketing staff of TTUHSC and PNS. Leins acknowledged “that continuation of\n\n[his] Agreement [was] contingent upon continued funding as provided by [PNS] to\n\nTTUHSC under separate document.” Although Leins’s base compensation was to be\n\npaid by TTUHSC, PNS agreed to pay that base compensation to TTUHSC. PNS also\n\nagreed to pay two-thirds of certain professional fees to TTUHSC, who would then\n\nreapportion the fees and pay Leins his share for his professional fees.\n\n\n       Under the Physician Employment Agreement, Leins agreed to comply with all\n\nTTUHSC rules, regulations, policies, and applicable law.       Furthermore, the parties\n\nagreed the Physician Employment Agreement “contain[ed] the sole and entire\n\nagreement between the Parties and supersede[d] any and all other agreements\n\nbetween the p/Parties [sic].”    The agreement provided for notices to be sent to\n\nTTUHSC, Leins, and PNS. The Physician Employment Agreement further stated that it\n\napplied only to physicians employed through TTUHSC and assigned to PNS facilities\n\n“pursuant to the Master Staffing Agreement, between TTUHSC and PNS.” (Emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n\n       In conjunction with the execution of the Physician Staffing Agreement, an\n\n“ATTACHMENT TO AGREEMENT FOR PHYSICIAN SERVICES, Edward J. Leins,\n                                            5\n\fD.O.” was also executed by TTUHSC’s Executive Vice President and PNS’s Chief\n\nExecutive Officer. The document was described as “an attachment to an Agreement\n\nbetween [PNS] and [TTUHSC], dated January 1, 2000, entitled ‘Agreement for\n\nPhysician Staffing Services,’ TTUHSC Contract number ALMW 00151.” In the TTUHSC\n\nRouting Sheet circulating the Attachment, TTUHSC described the “[c]ontract [t]ype” as\n\n“[r]evenue,” and struck the term “Other.” The contract description was described as\n\n“Attachment to Physician Staffing Agreement 00151-Edward J. Leins. D.O.” A second\n\namendment to the Physician Staffing Agreement was subsequently issued as an\n\n“Attachment” setting additional compensation and benefits for Leins.\n\n\n      PNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior describes itself as a “system to\n\nrespond to allegations of improper/illegal activities and the enforcement of appropriate\n\ndisciplinary action against employees who have violated compliance policies.”       The\n\nCode of Conduct was available to all staff members via a notebook in each clinic. It\n\nprovided, “[a]ny PNS employee who shows evidence that he or she is not willing to\n\ncomply with [the] Compliance Plan will be terminated,” and “[I]f an area of non-\n\ncompliance is identified, we will follow the procedures set forth in the Compliance Plan\n\nto identify the source of the problem and take corrective action.” (Emphasis added).\n\nThe Code also contained a form to be executed by employees stating the employee\n\n“must comply with the standards in the Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior and the\n\nCompliance Plan or face disciplinary action, will cooperate fully with the Compliance\n\nCommittee and Compliance Office,” and report any unethical or illegal activities to the\n\nCompliance Office.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f       The purpose of the section entitled “Physician Grievance Procedures” was to\n\n“formulate procedures to apply in cases of proposed corrective action against a\n\nphysician or termination of a physician’s employment.”4 Under Paragraph A. entitled\n\n“Termination Without Cause,” the policy stated unless the physician’s contract with PNS\n\nspecifically provided otherwise, a physician could be terminated without cause, without\n\nany grievance procedure, or other type of due process. Under Paragraph B. 2. a.,\n\nentitled “Corrective Action,” the procedure stated that “[w]henever the activities or\n\nprofessional conduct of a physician appears to be lower than accepted standards of the\n\nmedical profession; contrary to [PNS] bylaws, policies or procedures: contrary to the\n\nphysician’s written contract with [PNS]; . . . any person may request corrective action.”\n\n(Emphasis added). PNS’s procedures for handling a corrective action require PNS’s\n\nChief Executive Officer to follow detailed procedures before a corrective action could\n\nissue by its Board of Directors.\n\n\n       At trial, Leins testified that during his employment, his boss was Paul Acreman,\n\nPNS’s Chief Executive Officer. According to his testimony, all the terms of the written\n\nemployment agreement between him and TTUHSC were negotiated with Acreman in\n\nPNS’s offices.     In his tenure, he never met with any TTUHSC representatives.\n\nAccording to Leins’s testimony, PNS managed his practice, collected his billings, paid\n\nhis expenses, took a portion of its management fee from his collections and sent the\n\nremainder of his earned income to TTUHSC, who would then issue a paycheck to him.\n\nAt PNS’s urging, as a part of his employment arrangement, Leins executed a document\n\nagreeing to be bound by PNS’s policies and procedures. He had no dealings with\n       4\n          The Grievance Procedures were formally approved by Vernon Farthing, M.D., Chair of the\nBoard of Directors and Acreman.\n\n\n                                               7\n\fTTUHSC—no duties, no teaching responsibilities, no TTUHSC patients—and did not\n\nnegotiate benefits or contract terms with TTUHSC, he merely received his paycheck\n\nfrom them.\n\n\n       Leins testified that PNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior contained a\n\nwell-defined process for handling corrective actions or reprimanding a physician. He\n\nalso testified he was employed by TTUHSC and the University Medical Center, PNS’s\n\nparent organization, and although he did not have a written contract with PNS, he\n\nbelieved he had a contractual agreement with PNS, embodied in the Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement and the Physician Employment Agreement.                   He worked under the two\n\nagreements, and when suit was necessary, he sued the people he actually worked for\n\nrather than TTUHSC.\n\n\n       In a March 5, 2012 meeting with Acreman, Glenn Frick (PNS’s Chief Operating\n\nOfficer) and Brett King (PNS’s Office Manager), Leins reported an incident had occurred\n\neight months earlier involving another doctor. After some discussion, the PNS officials\n\nimmediately suspended the other doctor pursuant to PNS’s Code of Conduct and\n\nEthical Behavior. On April 9, Leins received a letter from Acreman indicating PNS had\n\nconcluded that he too had violated the Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior by failing\n\nto immediately report the violation. The letter suspended Leins without pay from April\n\n10, 2012, until April 16, 2012, and required Leins to complete HIPAA5 compliance\n\ntraining provided by PNS and “at your personal expense, complete a live CME ethics\n\ncourse of at least six (6) hours on the topic of professionalism, compliance, anti-\n\n\n       5\n         Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat.\n1936 (1996).\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fkickback, and/or fraud and abuse.”6            Leins timely met all the conditions of his\n\nsuspension; however, he lost wages in the sum of $13,000 and he incurred expenses\n\nfor the continuing medical education course.\n\n\n       On April 16, TTUHSC sent Leins a letter of reprimand stating “[t]his letter also\n\nconstitutes notice that your current contract is being terminated as of August 31, 2012.”7\n\nLeins later received another letter from TTUHSC, dated May 2, 2012, indicating\n\nTTUHSC had not been notified of his temporary suspension without pay by PNS until\n\nafter its deadline for issuing checks; therefore, the deduction for the period of\n\nsuspension would be reflected in his June 1st payroll check.\n\n\n       Leins testified that, in violation of PNS’s grievance policies, PNS failed to give\n\nhim written notification that he was under investigation, failed to give him written notice\n\nof his right to appear and appeal, and failed to appoint a committee of three physicians\n\nto hear the dispute. In defense to the allegations made, Leins countered that he\n\nreported the incident in a timely fashion under PNS policies and procedures and was\n\nunaware at the time of the incident that the doctor was actually engaging in misconduct.\n\nLeins also asserted PNS violated its policies by retaliating against him for reporting the\n\nother physician’s behavior.8\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Neither party disputes whether Lein’s punishment was subject to the Physician Grievance\nProcedures contained in PNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior.\n       7\n        Acreman testified Leins was not terminated due to any misconduct but was instead terminated\nbecause of a restructuring of the PNS/TTUHSC business model.\n       8\n         During the same period of time, a complaint was lodged against Leins with the Texas Medical\nBoard. The Board conducted its investigation and concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove\nLeins had violated the Texas Medical Practice Act.\n\n                                                 9\n\f        Acreman testified PNS was part of University Medical Center which provided a\n\nbroad base of primary care physicians to support the TTUHSC medical school and\n\nhospital. Although Leins was a TTUHSC employee managed by PNS, all physician\n\ncontract negotiations and paperwork were done through PNS. He was assigned to PNS\n\nand performed his contractual duties under the management of PNS according to the\n\nPNS/TTUHSC business model. As such, Leins was required to comply with the rules,\n\nregulations, and policies of both TTUHSC and PNS as part of his employment, including\n\nPNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior.9\n\n\n        According to Acreman’s testimony, Leins was suspended per a corrective action\n\nunder PNS’s “Physician Grievance Procedure.” He admitted the process was initiated\n\nwithout a written complaint against Leins. He also admitted PNS did not comply with its\n\nPhysician Grievance Procedures by (1) failing to inform Leins he was the subject of a\n\npeer review proceeding prior to his suspension and punishment, (2) failing to inform the\n\nchair of the board of directors of the request for a corrective action involving Leins, (3)\n\nfailing to appoint a three-physician review committee,10 (4) notifying Leins of the\n\nconclusion of the corrective action without giving him notice that he had thirty days to\n\nrequest a hearing before an independent hearing officer, (5) denying Leins the\n\nopportunity to go before the committee and state his case, have an attorney present,\n\ncall or cross-examine witnesses, hear any of the evidence, and give a written statement\n\nor closing argument, and (6) failing to notify him of his right to an appeal. He testified\n\n        9\n           PNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior stated that an employee would “not suffer any\npenalty or retaliation for good faith reporting of any suspected misconduct or violation. If an employee\nreported suspected misconduct in good faith, he would not “get suspended, or docked or fired, nothing\n[would] happen to them.”\n        10\n             The committee also contained a compliance officer as its fourth member.\n\n\n                                                     10\n\fthat, in hindsight, it would have been a good idea to have “implemented [the PNS\n\nGrievance Procedures] to the letter of the law” because “[a] lot would have been\n\navoided.” In an apparent attempt to explain why the required procedures were not\n\nfollowed, he also testified “[i]t’s his policy, he can change it if he wants.”\n\n\n       Matthew Spencer testified he was PNS’s Compliance Director and oversaw\n\nevery employee within the PNS umbrella. He testified PNS would have been better off\n\nto have followed its Physician Grievance Procedures but indicated PNS and its\n\nmanagement did not have to specifically follow its procedures. Shortly after Leins’s\n\ncomplaint about the other doctor’s behavior was brought to Spencer’s attention, he met\n\nwith PNS and TTUHSC compliance departments to discuss the matter.\n\n\n       Glenn Frick testified he was PNS’s Chief Operating Officer whose responsibilities\n\nincluded day-to-day operations of Leins’s clinical responsibilities. In his position, he\n\nhandled most of the contracts with physicians. He agreed Leins had a duty to report\n\nwhat he observed in June 2012 but failed to do so in a timely manner. Other than this\n\ninstance, he testified Leins never violated PNS’s policies or procedures.\n\n\n       Leins’s attorney, Grady Terrill, testified he practiced law in the community for\n\nthirty-seven years in the general area of litigation.        He was Chair of the District’s\n\nGrievance Committee for the State Bar of Texas and was familiar with the factors used\n\nto determine the reasonableness of attorney’s fees, i.e., time it would take to handle a\n\nmatter of this type, its complexity, and the novelty of the issues presented. He testified\n\nhe billed his time at $250 an hour and that his law firm had expended well over 300\n\nhours on Leins’s case. Terrill opined that the sum of $67,184 was a reasonable and\n\nnecessary fee for services rendered to Leins in this case. He further testified that an\n                                               11\n\fadditional sum of $25,000 would be appropriate if the case were appealed to an\n\nintermediate court of appeals, and that an additional $25,000-$50,000 would be\n\nappropriate if the case were appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. PNS’s attorney did\n\nnot object to any portion of Terrill’s testimony.\n\n\n       The trial court charged the jury with the following questions, in pertinent part, and\n\nthe jury gave the following responses:\n\n\n       QUESTION 1\n\n       Did Leins and PNS agree that PNS would follow PNS’s policies and\n       procedures as stated in [PNS’s Physician Grievance Procedures] when\n       disciplining Leins?\n\n       In deciding whether parties reached an agreement, you may consider\n       what they said and did in light of the surrounding circumstances, including\n       any earlier course of dealing.

By its second issue, PNS contends the Physician Employment Agreement\n\nand the Physician Staffing Agreement cannot be read together to create a contract\n\nbetween Leins and PNS. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n        11\n           The jury’s verdict awarded $50,000 for attorney’s fees through the petition for review stage at\nthe Texas Supreme Court, together with an additional $75,000 through the merits briefing stage, and an\nadditional $150,000 through oral arguments and the completion of proceedings stage.\n\n                                                   13\n\f              (A) STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       In reviewing a legal sufficiency issue, we may sustain the challenge only when\n\n(a) there is a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact, (b) the court is barred by\n\nrules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a\n\nvital fact, (c) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla of\n\nevidence, or (d) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact in\n\nquestion.    King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003), cert.\n\ndenied, 541 U.S. 1030, 124 S. Ct. 2097, 158 L. Ed. 2d 711 (2004). In determining\n\nwhether there is legally sufficient evidence to support the finding under review, a\n\nreviewing court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the judgment,\n\nindulging every reasonable inference favorable to the finding if a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould and disregarding evidence contrary to the finding unless a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould not.    See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807 (Tex. 2005).                In\n\nconducting our review, we must remain mindful of the fact that the factfinder is the sole\n\njudge of the credibility of a witness and the weight to be given the testimony. Id. at 819.\n\nThe final test for legal sufficiency must always be whether the evidence at trial would\n\nenable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review. Id. at\n\n827.\n\n\n       An assertion that the evidence is factually insufficient to support a fact finding\n\nmeans that the evidence supporting the finding is so weak or the evidence to the\n\ncontrary is so overwhelming that the answer should be set aside and a new trial\n\nordered. Garza v. Alviar, 395 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex. 1965). In reviewing an appellant’s\n\nfactual sufficiency challenge, we consider, examine, and weigh all of the evidence in the\n\nrecord, both in support of and contrary to the finding.         See Dow Chemical Co. v.\n                                             14\n\fFrancis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001). See also Maritime Overseas Corp. v.

In doing so, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the\n\ntrier of fact or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d at 406-07.\n\nOur duty is not to retry the case but to set aside the jury’s finding only if it is so contrary\n\nto the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Id. at\n\n407; Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986). When both legal and factual\n\nsufficiency challenges are raised on appeal, a reviewing court must first examine the\n\nlegal sufficiency of the evidence.    See Glover v. Tex. Gen. Indemnity Co., 619 S.W.2d\n\n400, 401 (Tex. 1981).\n\n\n              (B) CONTRACT INTERPRETATION\n\n       When construing a contract, the primary goal is to determine the parties’ intent as\n\nexpressed in the terms of the contract. Chrysler Ins. Co. v. Greenspoint Dodge of\n\nHouston, Inc., 297 S.W.3d 248, 252 (Tex. 2009). “Under generally accepted principles\n\nof contract interpretation, all writings that pertain to the same transaction will be\n\nconsidered together, even if they were executed at different times and do not expressly\n\nrefer to one another.” DeWitt Cnty. Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Parks, 1 S.W.3d 96, 102 (Tex.\n\n1999). See Brent v. Field 275 S.W.3d 611, 617 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, no pet.)\n\n(citing Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist. v.

Furthermore, it is uniformly held that other documents, even unsigned\n\ndocuments, may be incorporated by reference into the document signed by the person\n\nsought to be charged. Owen v. Hendricks, 433 S.W.2d 164, 167 (Tex. 1968); The City\n                                              15\n\fof Port Isabel v. Shiba, 976 S.W.2d 856, 858 (Tex. App., —Corpus Christi 1998, no\n\npet.).

In re C & H News, 133 S.W.3d at 645-46.\n\n\n      Most lawsuits involving an employer’s alleged non-compliance with policies and\n\nprocedures deal with wrongful termination suits where the plaintiff is contending that a\n\ncompany handbook or manual modified the employment-at-will rule. In these cases,\n\nwhich are somewhat analogous to the case before us, the courts have held that in order\n\nfor the at-will relationship to be modified, the handbook or manual must modify the\n\nemployer’s rights “in a meaningful and special way.” Vida v. Il Paso Employee’s Credit\n\n                                          16\n\fUnion, 885 S.W.2d 177, 177 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1994, no writ) (employer’s rights so\n\nlimited where manual states “no employee shall be penalized for using the grievance\n\nprocedure”).\n\n\n                (C) DISCUSSION\n\n      Here, Leins asserts he and PNS agreed to follow PNS’s policies and procedures\n\nwhen disciplining him. Viewing the record as a whole, we cannot say that, as a matter\n\nof law, the trial court erred by submitting QUESTION ONE to the jury. See John Wood\n\nGroup USA, Inc. v. ICO, Inc., 26 S.W.3d 12, 16 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000,\n\npet. denied).    Neither can we say that the jury’s finding in QUESTION ONE is so\n\ncontrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong or unjust.\n\nCain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\n\n      First, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that\n\nLeins had such an agreement with PNS. The Physician Staffing Agreement plainly\n\nstates that the parties entered into a written agreement for physician placement and the\n\nPhysician Employment Agreement would be attached thereto.               Importantly, the\n\nPhysician Staffing Agreement states the entire agreement was comprised of the\n\nagreement itself and “any Attachments,” which would include any Physician\n\nEmployment Agreement. The Physician Staffing Agreement also states that its terms\n\nwould apply to each Attachment and “[i]f there [were] a conflict between the terms of the\n\nAgreement and any Attachment, the terms of the Attachment [would] prevail.” Ergo,\n\nboth PNS and TTUHSC anticipated that the terms of the two agreements would be read\n\ntogether, and if so, the terms of the Physician Employment Agreement would control in\n\nthe event of a conflict. See Castroville Airport, Inc. v. City of Castroville, 974 S.W.2d\n\n                                           17\n\f207, 211-12 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, no pet.) (attachments referred to in contract\n\nincorporated by reference even where parties disputed whether attachments were\n\nactually attached); MTrust Corp., N.A. v. LJH Corp., 837 S.W.2d 250, 253 (Tex. App.—\n\nFort Worth 1992, writ denied) (attachment to contract incorporated by reference). This\n\nis not suprising since the two documents are inextricably intertwined, i.e., one\n\nagreement could not exist and further any useful purpose of the PNS/TTUHSC business\n\nmodel without the existence of the other agreement.\n\n\n       Secondly, although the Physician Staffing Agreement stated that “[a]ll physicians\n\nproviding services at the medical office are employees or independent contractors of\n\nTTUHSC,” there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the relationship between\n\nPNS and Leins was that of employer-employee. In addition to the language of the two\n\nagreements and PNS’s Physician Grievance Procedures, PNS was tasked with\n\nsupervising, operating, and managing each medical office and the physicians assigned\n\nto each office. PNS was also empowered not only to establish and implement the\n\nmedical offices’ operating policies, standards of operating, “and other policies affecting\n\nthe medical offices”12 but to discipline or terminate any physician for noncompliance. In\n\naddition, Leins perceived Acreman as his boss and took directions from PNS. He never\n\nmet with TTUHSC representatives and all terms of his contracts were negotiated\n\nbetween him and Acreman in PNS’s offices.                    Leins had no duties or teaching\n\nresponsibilities at TTUHSC and did not see any TTUHSC patients. TTUHSC was, in\n\n\n       12\n          Those terms not defined in a contract are given their “generally accepted or commonly\nunderstood meaning.” Gilbert Texas Constr., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London, 327 S.W.3d 118,\n127 (Tex. 2010). “Establish” means “to make firm or state” and “implement” means “to carry out,\naccomplish, fulfill . . . to give practical effect to and ensure of actual fulfillment through concrete\nmeasures.” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 778, 1134 (4th ed. 1976).\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fessence, merely a conduit, netting revenues from PNS before issuing a paycheck to\n\nLeins.\n\n\n         The Physician Employment Agreement between Leins and TTUHSC was “made\n\nin conjunction13 with the [Physician Staffing Agreement] under which Leins was\n\nassigned to a PNS Clinic and . . . acknowledge[d] [his] services [would] be managed by\n\n[PNS] which would bill and collect for [his] services and be compensated for its practice\n\ncosts.” Notices were required to be sent to TTUHSC, PNS, and Leins. In conjunction\n\nwith the Physician Employment Agreement, its attachment to the Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement was approved by TTUHSC’s Executive Vice President and PNS’s Chief\n\nExecutive Officer.14       A subsequent amendment to the Physician Employment\n\nAgreement was also issued as an attachment to the Physician Staffing Agreement.\n\n\n         That there was an agreement between Leins and PNS that PNS would follow its\n\nPhysician Grievance Procedures when disciplining him is also supported by PNS’s\n\nCode of Conduct and Ethical Behavior and its handling of the corrective action against\n\nLeins. As in the Physician Staffing Agreement, the Physician Grievance Procedures\n\nprovide that a PNS employee could be terminated if he or she was not willing to comply\n\nwith PNS’s compliance plan. PNS’s Physician Grievance Procedures also provide that\n\nPNS will follow the procedure in taking corrective actions and requires PNS to follow\n\neach step of the process as indicated by its language that PNS “will” and/or “shall”\n\n\n         13\n        “[I]n conjunction with” means in “union, association, [and/or] combination with.” WEBSTER’S\nTHIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY at 480.\n         14\n          The document was described as “an attachment to an Agreement between [PNS] and\n[TTUHSC], dated January 1, 2000, entitled ‘Agreement for Physician Staffing Services,’ TTUHSC\nContract number ALM W 00151.” To “attach” is to “make fast or join.” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW\nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY at 140.\n\n\n                                                19\n\fperform each step. Moreover, PNS relied on its Physician Grievance Procedures in\n\nhandling Leins’s corrective action and Leins complied with the punishment meted out.\n\nAlthough Acreman testified he could unilaterally alter the Physician Grievance\n\nProcedures at any time, the jury was entitled to infer that he could not because those\n\nprocedures were signed by Acreman and the chair of PNS’s board of directors,\n\nindicating more was needed than his unilateral action.                 Furthermore, there is no\n\nlanguage in the Physician Grievance Procedures granting Acreman such power.\n\nMoreover, the jury could have made a credibility determination not to believe Acreman’s\n\nor Spencer’s testimony that Acreman had such power.\n\n\n       Having considered the entire record in light of the jury charge,15 we cannot say\n\nthe jury’s finding that PNS and Leins agreed PNS would follow its physician grievance\n\npolicies and procedures when disciplining Leins was so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\nAccordingly, we find there was both legally and factually sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe finding that PNS breached its contractual obligation to follow its Physician Grievance\n\nProcedures when it punished Leins. Accordingly, issues one and two are overruled.\n\n\n       ISSUE THREE\n\n       By its third issue, PNS asserts Leins’s evidence in support of damages is also\n\nlegally and factually insufficient. Specifically, PNS contends there were no damages\n\nbecause no contract was breached, and assuming a contract was breached, Leins’s\n\nfailed to establish his actual and future damages. Because we have determined there\n\n\n\n       15\n          We measure sufficiency of the evidence against the jury question submitted. See Osterberg v.\nPeca, 12 S.W.3d 31, 55 (Tex. 2000).\n\n                                                 20\n\fwas sufficient evidence for a jury to find PNS breached its agreement with Leins, we will\n\nlimit our discussion to whether Leins failed to establish his actual and future damages.\n\n\n       Leins offered proof that he suffered $13,000 in actual damages due to PNS’s\n\nfailure to follow its Physician Grievance Procedures in the form of lost wages and actual\n\nexpenses incurred due to the suspension and accompanying punishment. In support of\n\nits position, PNS contends Leins failed to establish that the result of the grievance\n\nproceedings would have been different had PNS followed its policies and procedures.\n\nHaving established PNS agreed to follow those procedures and then breached its\n\nagreement, Leins was not required to make an additional showing that the result of the\n\ngrievance proceedings would have been different if the procedures had been followed.\n\nInstead, Leins’s remedy for PNS’s breach is to put him in status quo ante, that is, to put\n\nhim back in the position he occupied prior to the punishment.             In this case, the\n\nevidence, as measured by the applicable jury instructions, established that Leins was\n\nentitled to $9,000 in actual damages for actual wages lost and expenses incurred.\n\n\n       That said, we also find Leins failed to establish causation between PNS’s breach\n\nand any future damages. To recover damages for breach of contract, a plaintiff must\n\nshow that in reasonable probability he has suffered or will suffer a pecuniary loss as a\n\nresult of the breach. Peterson Group, Inc. v. PLTQ Lotus Group, L.P., 417 S.W.3d 46,\n\n64 (Tex. App.—Houston 2013, pet. denied). To recover a future loss, a plaintiff must\n\nshow the loss by competent evidence and with reasonable certainty. Id. A plaintiff may\n\nnot recover damages for breach of contract, past or future, if those damages are\n\nremote, contingent, speculative, or conjectural. Id. (citing S. Elec. Servs., Inc. v. City of\n\nHouston, 355 S.W.3d 319, 323-24 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, pet. denied).\n\n                                             21\n\fThe lost wages and cost of required courses due to Leins’s suspension were for specific\n\ndamages incurred during a finite period of time, and they were a direct result of the\n\ncorrective action PNS took in violation of its contractual obligations.      After he was\n\nreleased from his week-long suspension, Leins returned to work with no additional\n\ncourse requirements.      Thus, Leins failed to offer sufficient proof of any additional\n\ndamages he might have suffered as a result of the breach of contract by PNS.\n\nAccordingly, issue three is overruled as to the jury’s award of $9,000 for past actual\n\ndamages, but sustained as to any future damages.\n\n\n         ISSUES FOUR AND FIVE\n\n         By its fourth and fifth issues, PNS contests the trial court’s award of attorney’s\n\nfees. Issue four generally asserts the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\n\nsupport an attorney’s fee award; whereas, issue five asserts the award of attorney’s\n\nfees for proceedings in the Texas Supreme Court is not supported by the jury’s verdict.\n\nPNS specifically contends (1) the evidence supporting the award of attorney’s fees fails\n\nto adequately address the reasonableness factors set forth in Arthur Andersen & Co. v.\n\nPerry Equipment Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812 (Tex. 1997), (2) the evidence presented varies\n\nfrom the questions submitted to the jury, and (3) the judgment is not supported by the\n\njury findings regarding the recovery of fees for proceedings before the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt.\n\n\n         At trial, the attorney for Leins proffered testimony that $250 an hour was a\n\n“reasonable and customary fee for this type of litigation.” He further stated that he was\n\nfamiliar with and had applied the “Arthur Andersen factors” in determining that his hourly\n\nrate was reasonable. He also testified that his law firm had expended “well over 300\n\n                                             22\n\fhours in this matter” and that the “total fees through [the date of trial were] $63,520 . . .\n\n[together with] expenses of $3,664.” Based on those facts, he opined that “the amount\n\nof $67,184 [was] a reasonable fee to be charged in this case . . . .” While the attorney\n\ndid testify that other attorneys and staff had worked on the case, he further stated that\n\n“[w]e have not duplicated our billing.” No details of services rendered were given and\n\nno documentary evidence was offered. As to a reasonable fee for services rendered on\n\nappeal, the attorney merely stated “a reasonable fee [for an intermediate appeal] would\n\nbe at a very minimum $25,000,” and “if the matter goes to the Supreme Court—would\n\nbe a very bare minimum $25,000 and upwards to $50,000 before the Supreme Court.”\n\nAt no time did the attorney offer specific testimony concerning that Arthur Andersen\n\nfactors or their application to the facts of this particular case, nor did he offer any\n\nevidence detailing the hours expended on each phase of the litigation. Furthermore, he\n\ndid not segregate the services rendered as to the various causes of action being\n\npursued.16 During trial, no objections were made as to the testimony given concerning\n\nattorney’s fees and the cross-examination consisted of a few brief questions pertaining\n\nto whether there were any billing records to be presented and whether the hours listed\n\nwere separated according to the various causes of action. The only objection lodged by\n\nPNS at the time of submission of the issue concerning attorney’s fees was that “there is\n\nno evidence in the record which would properly support a finding of such issue.”\n\n\n       Leins contends PNS waived the issues being asserted by failing to properly\n\npreserve error. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1 (requiring, as a prerequisite to the presentation\n\nof an appellate issue, a showing of “a timely request, objection, or motion” concerning\n       16\n          We note that attorney’s fees were recoverable as to some, but not all, causes of action being\nasserted by Leins.\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fthe issue being raised). Leins further contends PNS failed to properly assign error by\n\nfailing to proffer authoritative arguments and authority.             See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i)\n\n(requiring clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate\n\ncitations to authorities and to the record). Having reviewed the record and the briefs,\n\nwe conclude that the only issue raised by PNS that presents anything for review in this\n\ncase is the issue pertaining to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence.17\n\nAccordingly, we overrule issue five.\n\n\n        As to the remaining issue, issue four, we note that for more than a century,\n\nTexas law has not allowed the recovery of attorney’s fees unless an award is authorized\n\nby statute or contract.

That said, the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nprovides that where a claim is based upon an oral or written contract, “reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees” may be awarded in addition to the amount of the claim being asserted.\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8) (West 2015).                        In order to recover\n\nattorney’s fees under this section, a litigant must (1) prevail on a breach of contract\n\ncause of action and (2) recover damages. MBM Financial v. Woodlands Operating Co.,\n\n292 S.W.3d 660, 666 (Tex. 2009).              The Texas Supreme Court has stated that “[i]f\n\nattorney’s fees are proper under section 38.001(8), the trial court has no discretion to\n\ndeny them” provided, however, the party seeking to recover attorney’s fees still bears\n\nthe burden of proving the amount and reasonableness of those fees. Smith v. Patrick\n\nW.Y. Tam Trust, 296 S.W.3d 545, 547 (Tex. 2009). Therefore, in this case, because\n\n        17\n         We examine the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence pertaining to attorney’s fees under\nthe same standards discussed above.\n\n                                                   24\n\fLeins did prevail on his contract cause of action, and he is entitled to recover damages\n\nas discussed above, he is also entitled to recover his attorney’s fees to the extent they\n\nwere supported by the evidence presented.\n\n\n       The reasonableness of an award of attorney’s fees is ordinarily a matter left to\n\nthe sound discretion of the factfinder, and a reviewing court may not substitute its\n\njudgment for that of the jury. Barker v. Eckman, 213 S.W.3d 306, 314 (Tex. 2006). In\n\nArthur Andersen, drawing from Rule 1.04 of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct,18 the Supreme Court identified a non-exclusive list of factors to\n\nbe considered in determining a reasonableness of a fee. See Arthur Andersen, 945\n\nS.W.2d at 818. Those factors include the following: (1) the time and labor required, the\n\nnovelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill required to perform the legal\n\nservice properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of representation in the case at\n\nissue will preclude other employment by the attorney; (3) the fee customarily charged in\n\nthe locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount in controversy and the result\n\nobtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (6) the\n\nnature and length of the professional relationship with the client; (7) the experience,\n\nreputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and (8) whether\n\nthe fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or uncertainty of collection before the\n\nlegal services have been rendered.\n\n\n       Fourteen years after Arthur Andersen, the Texas Supreme Court issued its\n\nopinion in El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, where it held that a request for attorney’s fees under\n\nthe Lodestar method (a method of calculation of attorney’s fees where the number of\n       18\n         TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. PROF. CONDUCT 1.04, reprinted in TEX. GOV’T CODE, tit. 2, subtit. G app.\n(STATE BAR RULES, art. X, § 9).\n\n                                                 25\n\fhours worked is multiplied by the prevailing hourly rate) must be supported by sufficient\n\ndetails of the work performed in order for the court to make a meaningful review of the\n\nreasonableness of a fee request. El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex.\n\n2011) (holding that “a party applying for an award of attorney’s fees under the [L]odestar\n\nmethod bears the burden of documenting the hours expended on the litigation and the\n\nvalue of those hours”). The Supreme Court opined that sufficient evidence “includes, at\n\na minimum, documentation of the services performed, who performed them and at what\n\nhourly rate, when they were performed, and how much time the work required” with\n\nsufficient detail that the court can make a meaningful review the reasonableness of the\n\nfee request. Id. at 764. Because the testimony in El Apple only included the total\n\nnumber of hours worked and generalities about discovery and the length of trial, the\n\nSupreme Court determined the evidence in that case was insufficient to support an\n\naward of attorney’s fees and it remanded the case to the trial court for a redetermination\n\nof those fees. Id. at 765. Likewise, in City of Laredo v. Montano, the Supreme Court\n\nreversed and remanded the case to the trial court in order to redetermine attorney’s\n\nfees when the attorney testified to the time expended and the hourly rate but failed to\n\nprovide evidence of the time devoted to specific tasks. City of Laredo v. Montano, 414\n\nS.W.3d 731, 736-37 (Tex. 2013).\n\n\n      El Apple involved a claim under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act\n\nwhich mandated use of the Lodestar method in such cases. El Apple, 370 S.W.3d at\n\n760. See also TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 26.003(a) (providing that “the trial\n\ncourt shall use the Lodestar method to calculate the amount of attorney’s fees to be\n\nawarded class counsel”). The Supreme Court has, however, held that the El Apple\n\nrequirements also apply to an attorney’s fee request under section 38.001 of the Texas\n                                           26\n\fCivil Practice and Remedies Code if the party applying for the award “uses the\n\n[L]odestar method by relating the hours worked for each of the . . . attorneys multiplied\n\nby their hourly rates for a total fee.” Long v. Griffin, 442 S.W.3d 253, 255 (Tex. 2014);\n\nAuz v. Cisneros, 477 S.W.3d 355, 362-63 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2015, no\n\npet.) (same conclusion).\n\n\n       Therefore, in a case such as this, where a party seeks to establish the\n\nreasonableness of a request for attorney’s fees under the Lodestar method, and the\n\nevidence is factually insufficient to support the amount of attorney’s fees awarded\n\nbecause the evidence presented does not provide sufficient information for a\n\nmeaningful review of the Lodestar calculation, an appellate court is required to reverse\n\nthe judgment as to the issue of attorney’s fees and remand the matter to the trial court\n\nfor a redetermination of those fees consistent with the opinion of the court. Accordingly,\n\nissue four is sustained.\n\n\n       CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm the trial court’s judgment regarding liability as to Leins’s contract cause\n\nof action and as to the award of $9,000 in actual damages; however, we reverse the\n\ntrial court’s judgment awarding recovery of $100,000 in future damages and we render\n\na take-nothing judgment as to that claim; and we reverse the trial court’s judgment as to\n\nthe recovery of attorney’s fees totaling $144,000 and remand this matter to the trial\n\ncourt for a redetermination of attorney’s fees consistent with the opinion of this court.\n\n\n\n                                                         Patrick A.

Reyes, Presiding\n\n\n                                      May 2, 2016\n\n                           MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                  Before QUINN, C.J., and CAMPBELL and PIRTLE, JJ.\n\n\n      Appellant, University Medical Center Physician Network Services (PNS), appeals\n\nfrom a judgment entered in favor of Appellee, Edward Leins, following a jury trial, in a\n\nlawsuit alleging multiple causes of action. PNS asserts (1) the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s finding that PNS and Leins agreed that PNS\n\nwould follow its physician grievance policies and procedures when disciplining Leins, (2)\n\nthe two written agreements at issue cannot be properly construed to create a contract\n\fbetween Leins and PNS to follow PNS’s grievance policies and procedures, (3) the\n\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the jury’s damages award, (4) the evidence is\n\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s award of attorney’s fees, and (5)\n\nthe trial court’s judgment awarding attorney’s fees to Leins for proceedings before the\n\nSupreme Court is not supported by the verdict of the jury. We affirm in part, reverse\n\nand render in part, and reverse and remand in part.\n\n\n        BACKGROUND\n\n        In May 2013, Leins filed his First Amended Petition alleging PNS and its Chief\n\nExecutive Officer, Paul Acreman, violated the Texas Whistleblower Act, breached their\n\ncontract with him, defamed and libeled him, tortiously interfered with his contractual\n\nrelations, and breached a fiduciary duty owed to him.1 Following a verdict in Leins’s\n\nfavor as to the breach of contract cause of action, the trial court issued its judgment\n\nawarding him $109,000 in damages,2 reasonable attorney’s fees through trial of\n\n$69,000, together with an additional $25,000 in attorney’s fees through appeal to this\n\ncourt, and $50,000 in fees for representation before the Supreme Court.3\n\n\n        There are two agreements at issue here: (1) an Agreement for Physician Staffing\n\nServices (herein the Physician Staffing Agreement) between PNS and Texas Tech\n\nUniversity Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC), wherein TTUHSC agreed to provide\n\nphysicians for clinics under PNS’s management and control, and (2) a Physician\n\n        1\n         Paul Acreman was originally named as an additional defendant; however, he was subsequently\ndismissed.\n        2\n           The verdict of the jury awarded Leins $9,000 for “[l]ost income, benefits, and other expenses\nsustained in the past” and $100,000 for “[l]ost income, benefits, and other expenses that, in reasonable\nprobability, will be sustained in the future.”\n        3\n        The trial court’s judgment reduced the jury’s verdict for attorney’s fees through an appeal to the\nSupreme Court from $275,000 down to $50,000.\n\n                                                    2\n\fEmployment Agreement between Leins and TTUHSC, wherein Leins agreed to engage\n\nin full-time duties as a medical practitioner in PNS’s medical offices, on behalf of\n\nTTUHSC, in satisfaction of TTUHSC’s duties under the Physician Staffing Agreement.\n\n\n      In July 2002, the Physician Staffing Agreement was executed by TTUHSC’s\n\nExecutive Vice President and PNS’s Chief Executive Officer.       TTUHSC and PNS\n\n“enter[ed] into a written agreement for the terms of each physician placement, and the\n\nagreement shall be an attachment to this Agreement.”        (Emphasis added).     The\n\nattachment would document “the identity of the TTUHSC physician, location of the\n\nmedical-office, expected hours of service, compensation to TTUHSC, and any other\n\nterms agreed upon by the parties.”      (Emphasis added).     The Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement also stated “[t]he Agreement and any Attachments contain the entire\n\nagreement and understanding between the parties concerning the subject matter of this\n\nAgreement. The terms of the Agreement shall apply to each Attachment. If there is a\n\nconflict between the terms of the Agreement and any Attachment, the terms of the\n\nAttachment shall prevail.” (Emphasis added). Under the terms of the Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement, TTUHSC would select physicians “in consultation with, and final approval\n\nof, PNS.” PNS was also responsible to pay the cost of using any recruiting firms and\n\nany cost associated with moving a physician to Lubbock.\n\n\n      The Physician Staffing Agreement described such physicians as “employees or\n\nindependent contractors of TTUHSC and not agents or employees of [University\n\nMedical Center] or PNS.” However, PNS was responsible for “supervis[ing], operat[ing],\n\nand manag[ing]” each medical clinic. PNS was also tasked with “establish[ing] and\n\nimplement[ing] the medical office’s operating policies and standards of operation,\n\n                                          3\n\fservices, maintenance, pricing, and other policies affecting the medical office.” The\n\nAgreement encouraged the participation of physicians in the development of policies\n\nand standards for each office. PNS and TTUHSC also agreed to designate compliance\n\nofficers to enforce the policies, procedures, and regulations of each party.\n\n\n       The Agreement authorized PNS to remove a physician “for cause,” and upon\n\nwritten notice to TTUHSC, PNS was empowered to remove a physician for “repeated\n\nfailure to perform the duties required by the [Physician Staffing Agreement] or the\n\nphysician’s failure or refusal to comply with PNS’s policies, standards and regulations.”\n\n(Emphasis added). It further provided that “[e]ither party may remove a physician from\n\na medical office without cause, subject to the terms of each Attachment.” Under the\n\nterms of the agreement, PNS was responsible to pay TTUHSC an agreed-upon annual\n\nbase compensation for physician salaries, benefits, professional liability insurance,\n\ncontinuing medical education, and administrative costs. In turn, TTUHSC was solely\n\nresponsible for paying the agreed-upon salaries of the assigned physicians.\n\n\n       In January 2010, Leins and TTUHSC executed an agreement whereby Leins\n\nagreed to engage as a medical practitioner at the Urgent Care Center at Kingspark in\n\nLubbock, Texas, “pursuant to the [Physician Staffing Agreement].” (Emphasis added.)\n\nUnder a subsection of the Physician Employment Agreement entitled “PNS Staffing,”\n\nthe parties agreed that the Physician Employment Agreement was “made in conjunction\n\nwith the [Physician Staffing Agreement] under which [Leins was] assigned to a PNS\n\nClinic . . . . “ (Emphasis added). The agreement further acknowledged that Leins’s\n\nservices would be “managed by” PNS.              The Physician Employment Agreement\n\ncommenced on August 1, 2010, and ended July 31, 2011, with the provision that the\n\n                                             4\n\fagreement would renew automatically each August 1st on a year-to-year basis unless\n\nterminated in accordance with the terms of that agreement. Paragraph 10.1.2 of that\n\nagreement provided that it could be “terminated without cause upon 90 days written\n\nnotice” to Leins.\n\n\n       Under the Physician Employment Agreement, Leins agreed to assist TTUHSC\n\nand PNS in quality improvement activities and to actively participate and cooperate with\n\nthe marketing staff of TTUHSC and PNS. Leins acknowledged “that continuation of\n\n[his] Agreement [was] contingent upon continued funding as provided by [PNS] to\n\nTTUHSC under separate document.” Although Leins’s base compensation was to be\n\npaid by TTUHSC, PNS agreed to pay that base compensation to TTUHSC. PNS also\n\nagreed to pay two-thirds of certain professional fees to TTUHSC, who would then\n\nreapportion the fees and pay Leins his share for his professional fees.\n\n\n       Under the Physician Employment Agreement, Leins agreed to comply with all\n\nTTUHSC rules, regulations, policies, and applicable law.       Furthermore, the parties\n\nagreed the Physician Employment Agreement “contain[ed] the sole and entire\n\nagreement between the Parties and supersede[d] any and all other agreements\n\nbetween the p/Parties [sic].”    The agreement provided for notices to be sent to\n\nTTUHSC, Leins, and PNS. The Physician Employment Agreement further stated that it\n\napplied only to physicians employed through TTUHSC and assigned to PNS facilities\n\n“pursuant to the Master Staffing Agreement, between TTUHSC and PNS.” (Emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n\n       In conjunction with the execution of the Physician Staffing Agreement, an\n\n“ATTACHMENT TO AGREEMENT FOR PHYSICIAN SERVICES, Edward J. Leins,\n                                            5\n\fD.O.” was also executed by TTUHSC’s Executive Vice President and PNS’s Chief\n\nExecutive Officer. The document was described as “an attachment to an Agreement\n\nbetween [PNS] and [TTUHSC], dated January 1, 2000, entitled ‘Agreement for\n\nPhysician Staffing Services,’ TTUHSC Contract number ALMW 00151.” In the TTUHSC\n\nRouting Sheet circulating the Attachment, TTUHSC described the “[c]ontract [t]ype” as\n\n“[r]evenue,” and struck the term “Other.” The contract description was described as\n\n“Attachment to Physician Staffing Agreement 00151-Edward J. Leins. D.O.” A second\n\namendment to the Physician Staffing Agreement was subsequently issued as an\n\n“Attachment” setting additional compensation and benefits for Leins.\n\n\n      PNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior describes itself as a “system to\n\nrespond to allegations of improper/illegal activities and the enforcement of appropriate\n\ndisciplinary action against employees who have violated compliance policies.”       The\n\nCode of Conduct was available to all staff members via a notebook in each clinic. It\n\nprovided, “[a]ny PNS employee who shows evidence that he or she is not willing to\n\ncomply with [the] Compliance Plan will be terminated,” and “[I]f an area of non-\n\ncompliance is identified, we will follow the procedures set forth in the Compliance Plan\n\nto identify the source of the problem and take corrective action.” (Emphasis added).\n\nThe Code also contained a form to be executed by employees stating the employee\n\n“must comply with the standards in the Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior and the\n\nCompliance Plan or face disciplinary action, will cooperate fully with the Compliance\n\nCommittee and Compliance Office,” and report any unethical or illegal activities to the\n\nCompliance Office.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f       The purpose of the section entitled “Physician Grievance Procedures” was to\n\n“formulate procedures to apply in cases of proposed corrective action against a\n\nphysician or termination of a physician’s employment.”4 Under Paragraph A. entitled\n\n“Termination Without Cause,” the policy stated unless the physician’s contract with PNS\n\nspecifically provided otherwise, a physician could be terminated without cause, without\n\nany grievance procedure, or other type of due process. Under Paragraph B. 2. a.,\n\nentitled “Corrective Action,” the procedure stated that “[w]henever the activities or\n\nprofessional conduct of a physician appears to be lower than accepted standards of the\n\nmedical profession; contrary to [PNS] bylaws, policies or procedures: contrary to the\n\nphysician’s written contract with [PNS]; . . . any person may request corrective action.”\n\n(Emphasis added). PNS’s procedures for handling a corrective action require PNS’s\n\nChief Executive Officer to follow detailed procedures before a corrective action could\n\nissue by its Board of Directors.\n\n\n       At trial, Leins testified that during his employment, his boss was Paul Acreman,\n\nPNS’s Chief Executive Officer. According to his testimony, all the terms of the written\n\nemployment agreement between him and TTUHSC were negotiated with Acreman in\n\nPNS’s offices.     In his tenure, he never met with any TTUHSC representatives.\n\nAccording to Leins’s testimony, PNS managed his practice, collected his billings, paid\n\nhis expenses, took a portion of its management fee from his collections and sent the\n\nremainder of his earned income to TTUHSC, who would then issue a paycheck to him.\n\nAt PNS’s urging, as a part of his employment arrangement, Leins executed a document\n\nagreeing to be bound by PNS’s policies and procedures. He had no dealings with\n       4\n          The Grievance Procedures were formally approved by Vernon Farthing, M.D., Chair of the\nBoard of Directors and Acreman.\n\n\n                                               7\n\fTTUHSC—no duties, no teaching responsibilities, no TTUHSC patients—and did not\n\nnegotiate benefits or contract terms with TTUHSC, he merely received his paycheck\n\nfrom them.\n\n\n       Leins testified that PNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior contained a\n\nwell-defined process for handling corrective actions or reprimanding a physician. He\n\nalso testified he was employed by TTUHSC and the University Medical Center, PNS’s\n\nparent organization, and although he did not have a written contract with PNS, he\n\nbelieved he had a contractual agreement with PNS, embodied in the Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement and the Physician Employment Agreement.                   He worked under the two\n\nagreements, and when suit was necessary, he sued the people he actually worked for\n\nrather than TTUHSC.\n\n\n       In a March 5, 2012 meeting with Acreman, Glenn Frick (PNS’s Chief Operating\n\nOfficer) and Brett King (PNS’s Office Manager), Leins reported an incident had occurred\n\neight months earlier involving another doctor. After some discussion, the PNS officials\n\nimmediately suspended the other doctor pursuant to PNS’s Code of Conduct and\n\nEthical Behavior. On April 9, Leins received a letter from Acreman indicating PNS had\n\nconcluded that he too had violated the Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior by failing\n\nto immediately report the violation. The letter suspended Leins without pay from April\n\n10, 2012, until April 16, 2012, and required Leins to complete HIPAA5 compliance\n\ntraining provided by PNS and “at your personal expense, complete a live CME ethics\n\ncourse of at least six (6) hours on the topic of professionalism, compliance, anti-\n\n\n       5\n         Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat.\n1936 (1996).\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fkickback, and/or fraud and abuse.”6            Leins timely met all the conditions of his\n\nsuspension; however, he lost wages in the sum of $13,000 and he incurred expenses\n\nfor the continuing medical education course.\n\n\n       On April 16, TTUHSC sent Leins a letter of reprimand stating “[t]his letter also\n\nconstitutes notice that your current contract is being terminated as of August 31, 2012.”7\n\nLeins later received another letter from TTUHSC, dated May 2, 2012, indicating\n\nTTUHSC had not been notified of his temporary suspension without pay by PNS until\n\nafter its deadline for issuing checks; therefore, the deduction for the period of\n\nsuspension would be reflected in his June 1st payroll check.\n\n\n       Leins testified that, in violation of PNS’s grievance policies, PNS failed to give\n\nhim written notification that he was under investigation, failed to give him written notice\n\nof his right to appear and appeal, and failed to appoint a committee of three physicians\n\nto hear the dispute. In defense to the allegations made, Leins countered that he\n\nreported the incident in a timely fashion under PNS policies and procedures and was\n\nunaware at the time of the incident that the doctor was actually engaging in misconduct.\n\nLeins also asserted PNS violated its policies by retaliating against him for reporting the\n\nother physician’s behavior.8\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Neither party disputes whether Lein’s punishment was subject to the Physician Grievance\nProcedures contained in PNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior.\n       7\n        Acreman testified Leins was not terminated due to any misconduct but was instead terminated\nbecause of a restructuring of the PNS/TTUHSC business model.\n       8\n         During the same period of time, a complaint was lodged against Leins with the Texas Medical\nBoard. The Board conducted its investigation and concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove\nLeins had violated the Texas Medical Practice Act.\n\n                                                 9\n\f        Acreman testified PNS was part of University Medical Center which provided a\n\nbroad base of primary care physicians to support the TTUHSC medical school and\n\nhospital. Although Leins was a TTUHSC employee managed by PNS, all physician\n\ncontract negotiations and paperwork were done through PNS. He was assigned to PNS\n\nand performed his contractual duties under the management of PNS according to the\n\nPNS/TTUHSC business model. As such, Leins was required to comply with the rules,\n\nregulations, and policies of both TTUHSC and PNS as part of his employment, including\n\nPNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior.9\n\n\n        According to Acreman’s testimony, Leins was suspended per a corrective action\n\nunder PNS’s “Physician Grievance Procedure.” He admitted the process was initiated\n\nwithout a written complaint against Leins. He also admitted PNS did not comply with its\n\nPhysician Grievance Procedures by (1) failing to inform Leins he was the subject of a\n\npeer review proceeding prior to his suspension and punishment, (2) failing to inform the\n\nchair of the board of directors of the request for a corrective action involving Leins, (3)\n\nfailing to appoint a three-physician review committee,10 (4) notifying Leins of the\n\nconclusion of the corrective action without giving him notice that he had thirty days to\n\nrequest a hearing before an independent hearing officer, (5) denying Leins the\n\nopportunity to go before the committee and state his case, have an attorney present,\n\ncall or cross-examine witnesses, hear any of the evidence, and give a written statement\n\nor closing argument, and (6) failing to notify him of his right to an appeal. He testified\n\n        9\n           PNS’s Code of Conduct and Ethical Behavior stated that an employee would “not suffer any\npenalty or retaliation for good faith reporting of any suspected misconduct or violation. If an employee\nreported suspected misconduct in good faith, he would not “get suspended, or docked or fired, nothing\n[would] happen to them.”\n        10\n             The committee also contained a compliance officer as its fourth member.\n\n\n                                                     10\n\fthat, in hindsight, it would have been a good idea to have “implemented [the PNS\n\nGrievance Procedures] to the letter of the law” because “[a] lot would have been\n\navoided.” In an apparent attempt to explain why the required procedures were not\n\nfollowed, he also testified “[i]t’s his policy, he can change it if he wants.”\n\n\n       Matthew Spencer testified he was PNS’s Compliance Director and oversaw\n\nevery employee within the PNS umbrella. He testified PNS would have been better off\n\nto have followed its Physician Grievance Procedures but indicated PNS and its\n\nmanagement did not have to specifically follow its procedures. Shortly after Leins’s\n\ncomplaint about the other doctor’s behavior was brought to Spencer’s attention, he met\n\nwith PNS and TTUHSC compliance departments to discuss the matter.\n\n\n       Glenn Frick testified he was PNS’s Chief Operating Officer whose responsibilities\n\nincluded day-to-day operations of Leins’s clinical responsibilities. In his position, he\n\nhandled most of the contracts with physicians. He agreed Leins had a duty to report\n\nwhat he observed in June 2012 but failed to do so in a timely manner. Other than this\n\ninstance, he testified Leins never violated PNS’s policies or procedures.\n\n\n       Leins’s attorney, Grady Terrill, testified he practiced law in the community for\n\nthirty-seven years in the general area of litigation.        He was Chair of the District’s\n\nGrievance Committee for the State Bar of Texas and was familiar with the factors used\n\nto determine the reasonableness of attorney’s fees, i.e., time it would take to handle a\n\nmatter of this type, its complexity, and the novelty of the issues presented. He testified\n\nhe billed his time at $250 an hour and that his law firm had expended well over 300\n\nhours on Leins’s case. Terrill opined that the sum of $67,184 was a reasonable and\n\nnecessary fee for services rendered to Leins in this case. He further testified that an\n                                               11\n\fadditional sum of $25,000 would be appropriate if the case were appealed to an\n\nintermediate court of appeals, and that an additional $25,000-$50,000 would be\n\nappropriate if the case were appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. PNS’s attorney did\n\nnot object to any portion of Terrill’s testimony.\n\n\n       The trial court charged the jury with the following questions, in pertinent part, and\n\nthe jury gave the following responses:\n\n\n       QUESTION 1\n\n       Did Leins and PNS agree that PNS would follow PNS’s policies and\n       procedures as stated in [PNS’s Physician Grievance Procedures] when\n       disciplining Leins?\n\n       In deciding whether parties reached an agreement, you may consider\n       what they said and did in light of the surrounding circumstances, including\n       any earlier course of dealing. You may not consider the parties’\n       unexpressed thoughts or intentions.\n\n       Answer: Yes\n\n       QUESTION 2\n\n       Did PNS fail to follow the policies and procedures in [PNS’s Physician\n       Grievance Procedures]?\n\n       Answer: Yes\n\n\n       QUESTION 3\n\n       What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly and\n       reasonable compensate Leins for his damages, if any, that resulted from\n       such failure to comply?\n       Answer separately in dollars and cents for damages, in any.\n\n              1. Lost income, benefits and other expenses sustained in the past.\n\n              Answer: $9,000.00\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f                2. Lost income, benefits, and other expenses that, in reasonable\n                   probability, will be sustained in the future.\n\n                Answer: $100,000.00\n\n\n        The jury found against Leins on his defamation and tortious interference causes\n\nof action; however, it awarded him reasonable attorney’s fees of $69,000 through trial,\n\n$25,000 through the Court of Appeals, and $275,000 through all Supreme Court\n\nproceedings.11 The trial court’s judgment reflected the jury’s verdict with the exception\n\nthat the trial court reduced the $275,000 in fees through the Supreme Court to $50,000.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n        ISSUES ONE AND TWO\n\n        By its first issue, PNS asserts the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\n\nsupport a finding PNS had any contractual responsibility to follow its grievance\n\nprocedures because (1) Leins did not have a contract with PNS, (2) the Physician\n\nEmployment Agreement was not attached to the Physician Staffing Agreement when it\n\nwas executed in 2002, (3) the Physician Employment Agreement does not reference\n\nPNS’s Physician Grievance Policies and Procedures, and (4) there is no evidence of an\n\noral agreement or that Leins was a third-party beneficiary to the Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement. By its second issue, PNS contends the Physician Employment Agreement\n\nand the Physician Staffing Agreement cannot be read together to create a contract\n\nbetween Leins and PNS. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n        11\n           The jury’s verdict awarded $50,000 for attorney’s fees through the petition for review stage at\nthe Texas Supreme Court, together with an additional $75,000 through the merits briefing stage, and an\nadditional $150,000 through oral arguments and the completion of proceedings stage.\n\n                                                   13\n\f              (A) STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       In reviewing a legal sufficiency issue, we may sustain the challenge only when\n\n(a) there is a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact, (b) the court is barred by\n\nrules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a\n\nvital fact, (c) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla of\n\nevidence, or (d) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact in\n\nquestion.

The Physician Staffing Agreement plainly\n\nstates that the parties entered into a written agreement for physician placement and the\n\nPhysician Employment Agreement would be attached thereto.               Importantly, the\n\nPhysician Staffing Agreement states the entire agreement was comprised of the\n\nagreement itself and “any Attachments,” which would include any Physician\n\nEmployment Agreement. The Physician Staffing Agreement also states that its terms\n\nwould apply to each Attachment and “[i]f there [were] a conflict between the terms of the\n\nAgreement and any Attachment, the terms of the Attachment [would] prevail.” Ergo,\n\nboth PNS and TTUHSC anticipated that the terms of the two agreements would be read\n\ntogether, and if so, the terms of the Physician Employment Agreement would control in\n\nthe event of a conflict.

In addition to the language of the two\n\nagreements and PNS’s Physician Grievance Procedures, PNS was tasked with\n\nsupervising, operating, and managing each medical office and the physicians assigned\n\nto each office. PNS was also empowered not only to establish and implement the\n\nmedical offices’ operating policies, standards of operating, “and other policies affecting\n\nthe medical offices”12 but to discipline or terminate any physician for noncompliance. In\n\naddition, Leins perceived Acreman as his boss and took directions from PNS. He never\n\nmet with TTUHSC representatives and all terms of his contracts were negotiated\n\nbetween him and Acreman in PNS’s offices.

In conjunction\n\nwith the Physician Employment Agreement, its attachment to the Physician Staffing\n\nAgreement was approved by TTUHSC’s Executive Vice President and PNS’s Chief\n\nExecutive Officer.14       A subsequent amendment to the Physician Employment\n\nAgreement was also issued as an attachment to the Physician Staffing Agreement.\n\n\n         That there was an agreement between Leins and PNS that PNS would follow its\n\nPhysician Grievance Procedures when disciplining him is also supported by PNS’s\n\nCode of Conduct and Ethical Behavior and its handling of the corrective action against\n\nLeins. As in the Physician Staffing Agreement, the Physician Grievance Procedures\n\nprovide that a PNS employee could be terminated if he or she was not willing to comply\n\nwith PNS’s compliance plan. PNS’s Physician Grievance Procedures also provide that\n\nPNS will follow the procedure in taking corrective actions and requires PNS to follow\n\neach step of the process as indicated by its language that PNS “will” and/or “shall”\n\n\n         13\n        “[I]n conjunction with” means in “union, association, [and/or] combination with.” WEBSTER’S\nTHIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY at 480.\n         14\n          The document was described as “an attachment to an Agreement between [PNS] and\n[TTUHSC], dated January 1, 2000, entitled ‘Agreement for Physician Staffing Services,’ TTUHSC\nContract number ALM W 00151.” To “attach” is to “make fast or join.” WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW\nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY at 140.\n\n\n                                                19\n\fperform each step. Moreover, PNS relied on its Physician Grievance Procedures in\n\nhandling Leins’s corrective action and Leins complied with the punishment meted out.\n\nAlthough Acreman testified he could unilaterally alter the Physician Grievance\n\nProcedures at any time, the jury was entitled to infer that he could not because those\n\nprocedures were signed by Acreman and the chair of PNS’s board of directors,\n\nindicating more was needed than his unilateral action.                 Furthermore, there is no\n\nlanguage in the Physician Grievance Procedures granting Acreman such power.\n\nMoreover, the jury could have made a credibility determination not to believe Acreman’s\n\nor Spencer’s testimony that Acreman had such power.\n\n\n       Having considered the entire record in light of the jury charge,15 we cannot say\n\nthe jury’s finding that PNS and Leins agreed PNS would follow its physician grievance\n\npolicies and procedures when disciplining Leins was so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\nAccordingly, we find there was both legally and factually sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe finding that PNS breached its contractual obligation to follow its Physician Grievance\n\nProcedures when it punished Leins.

In support of\n\nits position, PNS contends Leins failed to establish that the result of the grievance\n\nproceedings would have been different had PNS followed its policies and procedures.\n\nHaving established PNS agreed to follow those procedures and then breached its\n\nagreement, Leins was not required to make an additional showing that the result of the\n\ngrievance proceedings would have been different if the procedures had been followed.\n\nInstead, Leins’s remedy for PNS’s breach is to put him in status quo ante, that is, to put\n\nhim back in the position he occupied prior to the punishment.             In this case, the\n\nevidence, as measured by the applicable jury instructions, established that Leins was\n\nentitled to $9,000 in actual damages for actual wages lost and expenses incurred.\n\n\n       That said, we also find Leins failed to establish causation between PNS’s breach\n\nand any future damages.

After he was\n\nreleased from his week-long suspension, Leins returned to work with no additional\n\ncourse requirements.      Thus, Leins failed to offer sufficient proof of any additional\n\ndamages he might have suffered as a result of the breach of contract by PNS.\n\nAccordingly, issue three is overruled as to the jury’s award of $9,000 for past actual\n\ndamages, but sustained as to any future damages.\n\n\n         ISSUES FOUR AND FIVE\n\n         By its fourth and fifth issues, PNS contests the trial court’s award of attorney’s\n\nfees.

He also testified that his law firm had expended “well over 300\n\n                                             22\n\fhours in this matter” and that the “total fees through [the date of trial were] $63,520 . . .\n\n[together with] expenses of $3,664.” Based on those facts, he opined that “the amount\n\nof $67,184 [was] a reasonable fee to be charged in this case . . . .” While the attorney\n\ndid testify that other attorneys and staff had worked on the case, he further stated that\n\n“[w]e have not duplicated our billing.” No details of services rendered were given and\n\nno documentary evidence was offered. As to a reasonable fee for services rendered on\n\nappeal, the attorney merely stated “a reasonable fee [for an intermediate appeal] would\n\nbe at a very minimum $25,000,” and “if the matter goes to the Supreme Court—would\n\nbe a very bare minimum $25,000 and upwards to $50,000 before the Supreme Court.”\n\nAt no time did the attorney offer specific testimony concerning that Arthur Andersen\n\nfactors or their application to the facts of this particular case, nor did he offer any\n\nevidence detailing the hours expended on each phase of the litigation. Furthermore, he\n\ndid not segregate the services rendered as to the various causes of action being\n\npursued.16 During trial, no objections were made as to the testimony given concerning\n\nattorney’s fees and the cross-examination consisted of a few brief questions pertaining\n\nto whether there were any billing records to be presented and whether the hours listed\n\nwere separated according to the various causes of action. The only objection lodged by\n\nPNS at the time of submission of the issue concerning attorney’s fees was that “there is\n\nno evidence in the record which would properly support a finding of such issue.”\n\n\n       Leins contends PNS waived the issues being asserted by failing to properly\n\npreserve error. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1 (requiring, as a prerequisite to the presentation\n\nof an appellate issue, a showing of “a timely request, objection, or motion” concerning\n       16\n          We note that attorney’s fees were recoverable as to some, but not all, causes of action being\nasserted by Leins.\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fthe issue being raised). Leins further contends PNS failed to properly assign error by\n\nfailing to proffer authoritative arguments and authority.             See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i)\n\n(requiring clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate\n\ncitations to authorities and to the record). Having reviewed the record and the briefs,\n\nwe conclude that the only issue raised by PNS that presents anything for review in this\n\ncase is the issue pertaining to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence.17\n\nAccordingly, we overrule issue five.\n\n\n        As to the remaining issue, issue four, we note that for more than a century,\n\nTexas law has not allowed the recovery of attorney’s fees unless an award is authorized\n\nby statute or contract.

In\n\nArthur Andersen, drawing from Rule 1.04 of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct,18 the Supreme Court identified a non-exclusive list of factors to\n\nbe considered in determining a reasonableness of a fee. See Arthur Andersen, 945\n\nS.W.2d at 818. Those factors include the following: (1) the time and labor required, the\n\nnovelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill required to perform the legal\n\nservice properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of representation in the case at\n\nissue will preclude other employment by the attorney; (3) the fee customarily charged in\n\nthe locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount in controversy and the result\n\nobtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (6) the\n\nnature and length of the professional relationship with the client; (7) the experience,\n\nreputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and (8) whether\n\nthe fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or uncertainty of collection before the\n\nlegal services have been rendered.\n\n\n       Fourteen years after Arthur Andersen, the Texas Supreme Court issued its\n\nopinion in El Apple I, Ltd. v.

The Supreme Court opined that sufficient evidence “includes, at\n\na minimum, documentation of the services performed, who performed them and at what\n\nhourly rate, when they were performed, and how much time the work required” with\n\nsufficient detail that the court can make a meaningful review the reasonableness of the\n\nfee request. Id. at 764. Because the testimony in El Apple only included the total\n\nnumber of hours worked and generalities about discovery and the length of trial, the\n\nSupreme Court determined the evidence in that case was insufficient to support an\n\naward of attorney’s fees and it remanded the case to the trial court for a redetermination\n\nof those fees. Id. at 765. Likewise, in City of Laredo v. Montano, the Supreme Court\n\nreversed and remanded the case to the trial court in order to redetermine attorney’s\n\nfees when the attorney testified to the time expended and the hourly rate but failed to\n\nprovide evidence of the time devoted to specific tasks.
