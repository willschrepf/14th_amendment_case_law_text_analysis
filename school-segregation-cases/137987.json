Civil Action No. 13-420 (JEB)\nKAYA HENDERSON, Chancellor of the\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools, et al.,\n\n       Defendants.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       The public-education landscape in the District of Columbia has changed. The advent of\n\npublic charter schools, coupled with demographic shifts, has resulted in substantially decreased\n\nenrollment in certain neighborhoods over the last fifteen years. In response, the District of\n\nColumbia Public Schools has promulgated its Consolidation and Reorganization Plan, which\n\ncloses fifteen under-utilized schools, reassigns those students, and reallocates the savings to other\n\nschools – all in an effort to maximize resources and improve education citywide. Plaintiffs –\n\nguardians of children who attend closing schools and Advisory Neighborhood Commission\n\nmembers whose districts allegedly comprise such schools – have brought this suit, claiming that\n\nthe closures violate a host of constitutional, federal, and state provisions. They assert, in essence,\n\nthat the closures discriminate against poor, minority, and disabled students and were enacted\n\nwithout sufficient ANC input. Hoping to block the implementation of the Plan, Plaintiffs now\n\nask this Court for a preliminary injunction.\n\n       Few topics, understandably, incite our passions more than the education of our children.\n\nToss into the mix the future of neighborhood institutions, whose familiarity and history may\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fresonate deeply, and quite a volatile brew emerges. It is thus hardly surprising that assorted\n\nconstituencies may possess varied opinions on the wisdom and necessity of the Plan and Schools\n\nChancellor Kaya Henderson’s strategy. Yet every adverse policy decision does not yield a\n\nconstitutional claim. In this case, there is no evidence whatsoever of any intent to discriminate\n\non the part of Defendants, who are actually transferring children out of weaker, more segregated,\n\nand under-enrolled schools. The remedy Plaintiffs seek – i.e., to remain in such schools – seems\n\ncurious, given that these are the conditions most people typically endeavor to escape. In any\n\nevent, as Plaintiffs have no likelihood of ultimate success on the merits of their suit, they cannot\n\nprevail in this Motion here.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       While the parties quarrel about the legal analysis, the underlying facts here are essentially\n\nuncontested.\n\n       A. Factual Background\n\n       The District of Columbia Public Schools runs the District’s traditional, local public-\n\nschool system. See D.C. Code §§ 38-171 to -172. As Chancellor, Kaya Henderson acts as\n\nDCPS’s chief executive officer. See D.C. Code § 38-174(a). Not all D.C. public schools fall\n\nwithin DCPS’s sphere, however. In 1996, Congress authorized the operation of charter schools\n\nin the District, which exist as public schools outside of DCPS control. See District of Columbia\n\nSchool Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-107 (1996). Since then,\n\nchildren in many parts of the city have flocked to charters; indeed, more than half of public-\n\nschool students in Wards 1, 5, and 7 and more than a third in Wards 4, 6, and 8 now attend\n\npublic charter schools instead of DCPS schools. See Opp., Exh. B (Office of Chancellor, DCPS,\n\nDCPS Proposed Consolidations and Reorganization: Better Schools for All Students (“Proposed\n\n                                                  2\n\fConsolidation Plan”) (Nov. 15, 2012)) at 8. By contrast, only 14% of students in Ward 2 attend\n\ncharters, and no Ward 3 student does. See id. The number of school-age children has likewise\n\nfallen across the city, although – again – unevenly. While the population of school-age children\n\nin the last ten years has decreased by at least 1500 children in each of Wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8\n\n(including nearly 4000 in Ward 8), Ward 2 has lost only 761 children, and Ward 3 has actually\n\ngained 272 children during that time. See id. at 7. As a result, many DCPS schools are only\n\npartially full – particularly in certain parts of the city.\n\n        Responding to these demographic shifts and after obtaining recommendations from an\n\neducational consulting company, see Opp., Exh. A (Memorandum from Educ. Res. Strategies to\n\nChancellor Henderson (Aug. 17, 2012)), in November 2012, Chancellor Henderson proposed\n\nclosing twenty under-enrolled DCPS schools over the next two years. See Proposed\n\nConsolidation Plan at 16. Most of those slated for closure used less than half of their buildings’\n\ncapacities, and five schools had building-utilization rates under 25%. See id. at 17-22. DCPS\n\nexplained that closing these under-enrolled schools would decrease overhead, allowing schools\n\nto spend less per pupil, while putting more students in modern facilities and giving more students\n\naccess to programs and staff that can be justified only for large schools, thereby improving the\n\noverall quality of education. See id. at 10-14. Plaintiffs question whether the closings will\n\nactually bring down spending, pointing out that similar benefits projected from DCPS closures in\n\n2008 never materialized. See Reply at 3 & n.4 (citing Exh. F (Yolanda Branche, D.C. Auditor,\n\nAudit of the Closure and Consolidation of 23 Public Schools (Sept. 6, 2012))). Fourteen of the\n\ntwenty schools proposed for closure were in Wards 5, 7, and 8, plus two schools each in Wards\n\n2, 4, and 6. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 16. The proposal suggested no changes in\n\nWards 1 or 3. See id. at 23 (building-utilization rate is 74% in Ward 1 and 109% in Ward 3).\n\n\n\n                                                     3\n\f       To promote its proposal and gather community feedback, DCPS took its show on the\n\nroad. The City Council held two hearings on the closures. See Opp., Exh. D (Office of\n\nChancellor, DCPS, Better Schools for All Students: DCPS’ Consolidation and Reorganization\n\nPlan (“Final Consolidation Plan”) (Jan. 2013)) at 2. DCPS itself convened meetings throughout\n\nthe city, including four ward-based public meetings that drew 780 participants. See id. In\n\naddition, DCPS e-mailed ANC Commissioners with schools slated for closure in their districts,\n\nalong with some of the incoming ANC Commissioners-elect, to ask for reactions. See Defs.\n\nNotice of Correction & Clarification, Exh. A (Decl. of Shanita Burney, Exh. 1 (E-mail from\n\nJosephine Robinson, DCPS, to ANC Commissioners (Nov. 13, 2012))). DCPS also sent a\n\nsummary of the proposal home in the backpack of every child attending a school on the closure\n\nlist. See Opp., Exh. C (Decl. of Peter Weber), ¶ 7.\n\n       This desire for community input was no charade. On the contrary, the feedback yielded\n\nreal changes in DCPS’s final Plan, released January 17, 2013. Five schools proposed for closure\n\nwill now remain open: two in Ward 2, one in Ward 7, and two in Ward 8. See Final\n\nConsolidation Plan at 4-5. At five other schools, moreover, assignments for the departing\n\nstudents changed. See id. In choosing schools to receive the students, DCPS particularly\n\nfocused on “safety and walkability.” Id. at 7. DCPS estimated that savings from the revised\n\nproposal would total $8.5 million, see id. – an estimate that Plaintiffs, of course, contest – which\n\nsum would then be plowed back into schools throughout the city. See id. at 6.\n\n       All fifteen schools on the final closure list lie east of Rock Creek Park, a historical\n\ndividing line within the city. East of the Park, residents are generally poorer and\n\noverwhelmingly black and Hispanic; west of the Park, residents are wealthier and mostly white.\n\nThe halls of the closing schools reflect those demographics. In DCPS schools as a whole, 68.4%\n\n                                                 4\n\fof students are black; 13.8% are Hispanic; 3.7% are Asian, other, or unknown; and 9.2% are\n\nwhite. See Mot., Exh. A (Aff. of Mary Levy), ¶ 16. In the schools slated for closure, by\n\ncontrast, 93.7% of students are black; 5.9% are Hispanic; 0.4% are Asian, other, or unknown;\n\nand less than 0.1% (2 out of 3053) are white. See id. The figures skew similarly, if less starkly,\n\nfor disabled students: 27.7% of students in the closing schools are in special education, versus\n\n14.2% of students in DCPS overall. See id.\n\n       The D.C. Council will meet on May 22 to consider the Mayor’s proposed budget, which\n\nreflects the school closures. While the Council (like any other legislative body) may alter\n\nfunding levels, see D.C. Code § 38-173(b), the District assured the Court during the preliminary-\n\ninjunction hearing that the Mayor’s decision to proceed with the school consolidation is final.\n\nThe school-closure Plan is therefore ripe for judicial review.\n\n       B. Procedural Background\n\n       Seeking to block implementation of the Plan, five Plaintiffs filed this suit in D.C.\n\nSuperior Court on March 29, 2013, naming Chancellor Henderson, Mayor Vincent Gray, and the\n\nDistrict of Columbia as Defendants. (The Court will collectively refer to all Defendants as “the\n\nDistrict.”) Two Plaintiffs – Karlene Armstead and Ericka Black – are ANC Commissioners who\n\nsay they never received the legally required notice of the school closures. See Compl., ¶¶ 2, 5,\n\n65. The other three Plaintiffs – Shannon Smith, Marlece Turner, and Brenda Williams – are\n\nguardians of children who attend schools slated for closure. See Mot., Exh. D (Aff. of Shannon\n\nSmith), ¶¶ 1-2; Mot., Exh. E (Aff. of Marlece Turner), ¶ 1; Mot., Exh. G (Aff. of Brenda\n\nWilliams), ¶ 1. All of the guardians’ children are black or Hispanic and live east of the Park.\n\nSee Compl., ¶¶ 28, 30. Two have serious disabilities that will allegedly make the disruptions\n\ncaused by the school closures particularly difficult. See Turner Aff., ¶¶ 5, 9-10 (Asperger’s and\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fADHD); Williams Aff., ¶¶ 1-2, 7, 9 (unable to walk or talk and frequent seizures). While the\n\nComplaint does not say so directly, both sides have assumed that Smith, Turner, and Williams\n\nsue on behalf of their children as next friends, and the Court will make the same assumption for\n\npurposes of this Opinion, although subsequent amendment should make this explicit.\n\n        In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the District violated D.C. statutes requiring\n\nnotice to ANC Commissioners and consideration of their views, the D.C. Sunshine Amendment,\n\nthe Constitution’s equal-protection guarantee (asserted under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct, the Rehabilitation Act, and the D.C. Human Rights Act. See Compl., ¶¶ 56-94.\n\n        Simultaneous with the filing of their Complaint, Plaintiffs moved for a temporary\n\nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction. The District removed the case to federal court on\n\nApril 2, and the next day, the Court held a joint telephone call with the parties. Because\n\nPlaintiffs did not need a decision until May 22, they agreed to withdraw their TRO motion and\n\nproceed solely with their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. The Court held a hearing on that\n\nMotion on May 10, and this Opinion follows five days later.\n\nII.     Legal Standard\n\n        A preliminary injunction “is an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a\n\nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 365,\n\n376 (2008). “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that he is likely to\n\nsucceed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of\n\npreliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in\n\nthe public interest.” Id. at 374. Before the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, courts weighed\n\nthe preliminary-injunction factors on a sliding scale, allowing a weak showing on one factor to\n\n                                                   6\n\fbe overcome by a strong showing on another. See Davenport v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 166\n\nF.3d 356, 360-61 (D.C. Cir. 1999). This Circuit, however, has suggested, without deciding, that\n\nWinter should be read to abandon the sliding-scale analysis in favor of a “more demanding\n\nburden” requiring Plaintiffs to independently demonstrate both a likelihood of success on the\n\nmerits and irreparable harm. Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011); see also\n\nDavis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\n       Whichever way Winter is read, it is clear that a failure to show a likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits is alone sufficient to defeat a preliminary-injunction motion. In Arkansas Dairy Co-op\n\nAss’n v. USDA, 573 F.3d 815 (D.C. Cir. 2009), a case that postdates Winter, the court decided\n\nthat it “need not proceed to review the other three preliminary injunction factors” because the\n\nplaintiff had “shown no likelihood of success on the merits.” Id. at 832; see also Apotex, Inc. v.\n\nFDA, 449 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (pre-Winter case holding no need to address other\n\npreliminary-injunction factors where plaintiff had little likelihood of succeeding on the merits);\n\nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 304 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“a\n\npreliminary injunction will not issue” upon showing of irreparable harm unless plaintiffs also\n\nsatisfy other three preliminary-injunction factors; “[u]nsupported or undeveloped allegations of\n\ngovernment establishment, for example, while sufficient to make out irreparable injury, will not\n\nwithstand scrutiny concerning the movant’s likelihood of success on the merits, thereby\n\ndefeating a request for preliminary injunction”). It follows that, upon finding that a plaintiff has\n\nfailed to show a likelihood of success on the merits, the Court may deny a motion for preliminary\n\ninjunction without analyzing the remaining factors.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fIII.   Analysis\n\n       Mapping onto the two categories of Plaintiffs in this case are the two types of claims\n\nbrought: the ANC Commissioners assert process-related claims, while the guardians of children\n\nwho attend closing schools submit civil-rights claims. As always, the Court must begin with\n\njurisdiction – here, with questions about standing. Because standing appears an insurmountable\n\nhurdle for the ANC Commissioners, the Court need look no further at their claims. Instead, it\n\nmay move straight to the guardians’ civil-rights counts. Grouping similar legal theories together,\n\nthe Court will begin its merits analysis with the alleged violations of the Equal Protection Clause\n\nand Title VI. Next, it will examine the IDEA, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act. It will end\n\nwith the DCHRA and the Sunshine Amendment.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ opening brief provides only the barest sketch of their legal arguments, focusing\n\ninstead on policy positions better directed to the government’s other branches. In their Reply,\n\nPlaintiffs double down on their Equal Protection Clause argument, explaining it more\n\nthoroughly, but almost completely ignore their other civil-rights claims. Taking that emphasis as\n\na signal of where Plaintiffs believe they are most likely to succeed on the merits, the Court pays\n\nspecial attention to this question and, conversely, declines to search out arguments Plaintiffs\n\ncould have made in support of their other civil-rights causes of action.\n\n       A. Standing\n\n               1. Legal Standard\n\n       Article III of the Constitution limits the power of the federal judiciary to the resolution of\n\n“Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2; see also Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,\n\n750 (1984) (discussing the case-or-controversy requirement). “This limitation is no mere\n\nformality: it ‘defines with respect to the Judicial Branch the idea of separation of powers on\n\n                                                 8\n\fwhich the Federal Government is founded.’” Dominguez v. UAL Corp., 666 F.3d 1359, 1361\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 750). Because “standing is an essential and\n\nunchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III,” Lujan v. Defenders of\n\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992), finding that a plaintiff has standing is a necessary “predicate\n\nto any exercise of [the Court’s] jurisdiction.” Fla. Audubon Soc’y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc).\n\n       “Every plaintiff in federal court,” consequently, “bears the burden of establishing the\n\nthree elements that make up the ‘irreducible constitutional minimum’ of Article III standing:\n\ninjury-in-fact, causation, and redressability.” Dominguez, 666 F.3d at 1362 (quoting Lujan, 504\n\nU.S. at 560-61). Standing for a procedural injury is “special,” however, because a “person who\n\nhas been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without\n\nmeeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7.\n\n“A plaintiff who alleges a deprivation of a procedural protection to which he is entitled never has\n\nto prove that if he had received the procedure the substantive result would have been altered. All\n\nthat is necessary is to show that the procedural step was connected to the substantive result.”\n\nSugar Cane Growers Co-op. of Fla. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, 94-95 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n       In “considering whether a plaintiff has Article III standing, a federal court must assume\n\narguendo the merits of his or her legal claim.” Parker v. District of Columbia, 478 F.3d 370, 377\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2007), aff’d on other grounds sub nom. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570\n\n(2008). That assumption ensures that a court does not resolve the merits while analyzing the\n\nstanding question. See City of Waukesha v. EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f                2. ANC Claims\n\n        The ANC Commissioners and their claims do not survive this standing filter. By way of\n\nbackground: in the District’s distinctively structured government, the city is divided into wards,\n\nthe wards into Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, and the ANCs into single-member\n\ndistricts. ANCs may comment on a vast array of actions proposed by the District government,\n\nand any concerns they raise must be given “great weight” during deliberations by governmental\n\nentities. See D.C. Code §§ 1-309.10(a), (d)(3)(A). To weigh in on a specific proposal, ANC\n\nCommissioners obviously need to know that it is under consideration. Thus, at least 30 days\n\nbefore proposed actions, “written notice . . . shall be given by first-class mail to . . . the\n\nCommissioner representing a single-member district affected by said actions.” D.C. Code\n\n§ 1-309.10(b). While the statute requires written notice by first-class mail, actual notice cures a\n\ntechnical violation of the requirement, as long as the ANC has enough time to comment. See\n\nComm. for Washington’s Riverfront Parks v. Thompson, 451 A.2d 1177, 1183 (D.C. 1982)\n\n(“[A]ctual notice to the affected ANC which allows meaningful participation in a proceeding is\n\nsufficient to cure merely technical violations of the thirty-day notice requirement of the ANC\n\nAct.”); Shiflett v. D.C. Bd. of Appeals & Review, 431 A.2d 9, 11 (D.C. 1981); Kopff v. D.C.\n\nAlcoholic Beverage Control Bd., 381 A.2d 1372, 1382 (D.C. 1977). Conceding it never\n\nprovided formal notice (i.e., by first-class mail) here, the District argues it did give the proper\n\nANC Commissioners actual notice (i.e., by e-mail and otherwise). The Court need not resolve\n\nthis question to decide the issue of standing.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that the school closings cannot go forward because Armstead and Black\n\nnever received sufficient notice of the proposal. Before a court can invalidate an improperly\n\nnoticed government action, however, a plaintiff with standing must sue about the defect.\n\n                                                   10\n\fContrary to Plaintiffs’ urgings, Armstead and Black possess no special powers from their official\n\nroles as ANC Commissioners because D.C. law bars such people from bringing suit in their\n\nofficial capacity. See Kopff, 381 A.2d at 1376-77 (“In summary, ANCs 3-C and 3-F, as well as\n\nthe Commissioners of each in their official rolls [sic], have no capacity to assert the claims in this\n\npetition for review and must be dismissed as parties.”) (citing statute now codified at D.C. Code\n\n§ 1-309.10(g)). This means that an ANC or its Commissioners cannot simply rush to court every\n\ntime they do not receive notice. Instead, suits must be brought either by ANC Commissioners in\n\ntheir private capacities or by the residents the Commissioner represents. See id. (“Our\n\nconclusion, however, does not mean that the ANCs’ right to advise cannot be protected. To the\n\ncontrary, we hold that ANC area residents (including ANC Commissioners as individual\n\ncitizens) have standing to initiate legal action to assert the rights of the ANC itself.”). The ANC\n\nclaim here, therefore, requires either Armstead or Black to have standing in her personal\n\ncapacity.\n\n       In assessing such standing, the starting point is to recall that lack of notice is a procedural\n\ninjury. See N.B. ex rel. Peacock v. District of Columbia, 682 F.3d 77, 82-83 (D.C. Cir. 2012).\n\nWhile a procedural injury relaxes the immediacy and redressability showings typically required\n\nfor standing – e.g., neither Commissioner need show her ANC’s input would have altered the\n\nDCPS Plan – a plaintiff must still show that the substantive result (here, implementation of the\n\nPlan) has caused her an injury in fact: “[D]eprivation of a procedural right without some concrete\n\ninterest that is affected by the deprivation – a procedural right in vacuo – is insufficient to create\n\nArticle III standing. Only a ‘person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his\n\nconcrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability\n\nand immediacy.’” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 496 (2009) (emphasis in\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\foriginal) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7); see also Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA,\n\n667 F.3d 6, 15-16 (D.C. Cir. 2011); Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 664-65. Here, that means at\n\nleast one Commissioner Plaintiff must show that the school closures connected with the deficient\n\nnotice actually injured her.\n\n       Employing this framework, it becomes manifest that Armstead and Black lack standing\n\nto sue in their personal capacities for two independent reasons. First, neither suffered a\n\nprocedural injury in the first place. When the District considers an action, it need not inform\n\nevery ANC Commissioner; it must give notice only to those Commissioners “representing a\n\nsingle-member district affected by said action[].” D.C. Code § 1-309.10(b). Although she had\n\nrecently been elected ANC Commissioner, Armstead had not yet taken office when DCPS\n\nproposed the closures. See Burney Decl., ¶¶ 8-10. Because she was not a Commissioner at the\n\ntime and thus had no right to weigh in on the Plan, the District had no duty to give her notice,\n\nand no procedural injury was thus inflicted upon her. As to Black, the District has argued\n\n(without drawing any protest from Plaintiffs) that the single-member districts “affected” by the\n\nPlan are districts with schools proposed for closure within their borders. From the District’s\n\nevidence, it appears that no such schools were in Black’s single-member district. See id., ¶ 7; E-\n\nmail from Robinson to ANC Commissioners (November 2012 e-mail about closure proposal sent\n\nto 20 ANC Commissioners – presumably those representing the 20 schools proposed for\n\nclosure). So Black seems similarly unentitled to notice of the closures, which would mean that\n\nshe also suffered no procedural injury.\n\n       Second, even if Armstead and Black should have been given notice, neither has averred\n\nthat she was concretely injured by the school closures. In other words, neither here claims to\n\nhave a child in a closing school or gives any other reason that she herself was hurt by the\n\n                                                12\n\fclosures. As “[t]he mere violation of a procedural requirement . . . does not permit any and all\n\npersons to sue to enforce the requirement,” Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 664, Armstead and\n\nBlack can press their claim no further. See United Transp. Union v. ICC, 891 F.2d 908, 918\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (“[B]efore we find standing in procedural injury cases, we must ensure that\n\nthere is some connection between the alleged procedural injury and a substantive injury that\n\nwould otherwise confer Article III standing. Without such a nexus, the procedural injury\n\ndoctrine could swallow Article III standing requirements.”) (citation omitted). As standing is a\n\nnecessary “predicate to any exercise of [the Court’s] jurisdiction,” Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d\n\nat 663, the Commissioners and their claims have no likelihood of success on the merits.\n\n                3. Civil-Rights Claims\n\n        Unlike the Commissioners, Plaintiffs Smith, Turner, and Williams, as next friend for their\n\nrespective children, each clearly do have standing to challenge the closure of the schools their\n\nchildren attend. All have filed declarations describing disruptions and inconveniences their\n\nchildren will allegedly suffer as a result of the transfer, see Smith Aff., ¶ 5; Turner Aff., ¶¶ 9-10;\n\nWilliams Aff., ¶¶ 2, 7-9, which suffice to provide Article III standing. The District concedes that\n\nthese Plaintiffs have standing, but argues that such standing extends only to the closure of their\n\nown schools, not to all of the schools in the Plan. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs, however, that\n\nthe civil-rights claims they bring allege that the whole Plan – instead of any individual school\n\nclosure – is discriminatory, entitling them to challenge the Plan in its entirety. When a law\n\nunconstitutionally discriminates, the entire law falls – not just its application to the plaintiffs with\n\nstanding. See Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law 721 (3d ed. 2006) (remedy for equal-\n\nprotection violation is “simply invalidating the discriminatory law”). The same principle also\n\ngoverns Plaintiffs’ other civil-rights claims. This makes sense here, given that the District’s\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fjustifications for the Plan are no different for the three Plaintiffs’ schools than for the others\n\nbeing closed.\n\n        As jurisdiction is established only for the non-Commissioner Plaintiffs, the Court can\n\nnow proceed to the merits of their claims.\n\n        B. Equal Protection Clause and Title VI\n\n        The Court begins with Plaintiffs’ primary cause of action – unconstitutional racial\n\ndiscrimination. While their suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 also alleges that the District’s decision\n\ndiscriminates on the basis of disability and residence in violation of the Equal Protection Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment (which applies to the District through the Fifth Amendment Due\n\nProcess Clause), see Compl., ¶ 87, they focus particularly on discrimination based on race. See\n\nReply at 13-24. Plaintiffs also list a count under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\nalleging discrimination based on race, color, and national origin by the District, a recipient of\n\nfederal funding. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of\n\nrace, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial\n\nassistance.”).\n\n        At the threshold, the District objects that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative\n\nremedies before bringing their Title VI claim. Title VI suits for individual claims of\n\ndiscrimination, however, need not be exhausted. See Milbert v. Koop, 830 F.2d 354, 356 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1987) (“Title VI, which relates to the cutting off of funding of federal programs when\n\ncertain prescribed discriminatory conduct occurs, does not contain exhaustion requirements\n\nsimilar to those of Title VII.”); cf. Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 694, 706 n.41 (1979)\n\n(declining to require administrative exhaustion of claims under Title IX, which “was patterned\n\n                                                  14\n\fafter Title VI”). Nor is it clear how Plaintiffs would exhaust such a grievance – the District\n\npoints to no administrative process it runs for Title VI complaints. Exhaustion of this claim was\n\nthus not necessary.\n\n       What is necessary, however, for both constitutional and Title VI claims is a showing of\n\nintentional discrimination. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S.\n\n252, 264-65 (1977) (“[O]fficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results\n\nin a racially disproportionate impact. . . . Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is\n\nrequired to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.”); Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S.\n\n275, 280 (2001) (“[I]t is similarly beyond dispute – and no party disagrees – that [42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000d] prohibits only intentional discrimination.”). Discriminatory intent “implies more than\n\nintent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker . . .\n\nselected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in\n\nspite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442\n\nU.S. 256, 279 (1979) (citation omitted); see also Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265-66\n\n(discriminatory intent need be only a “motivating factor in the decision”).\n\n       Despite these precedents requiring intentional discrimination, Plaintiffs seem to rest their\n\nComplaint and Motion on disparate impact. See, e.g., Compl., ¶ 92 (“Any fair analysis of the\n\nfacts in the instant situation clearly demonstrates the presence of a prima facie case of disparate\n\nimpact.”); Mot. at 2 (“On its face, the impact of the proposed closings treat students of color,\n\nthose with disabilities and those who live in low income neighborhoods disproportionately and\n\ndisparately.”). While Plaintiffs point to Department of Education regulations prohibiting policies\n\nwith a disparate impact, the Supreme Court has held that such regulations may not be enforced\n\nby a private actor. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275. Only in their Reply do Plaintiffs finally pivot to\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fdiscriminatory intent, arguing that the school closures here present a “clear pattern,\n\nunexplainable on grounds other than race.” See Reply at 15-19. This language does derive from\n\nthe Supreme Court, which held that “[s]ometimes a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other\n\nthan race, emerges from the effect of the state action even when the governing legislation\n\nappears neutral on its face.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266. Yet the Court there went on to\n\nsay, “But such cases are rare. Absent a pattern as stark as that in Gomillion or Yick Wo, impact\n\nalone is not determinative, and the Court must look to other evidence.” Id. (footnote omitted)\n\n(citing Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886)).\n\n       The numbers here are as stark as those in Yick Wo (discriminating against laundries\n\noperated by those with Chinese ancestry) and Gomillion (racially discriminatory redrawing of\n\ncity borders): despite the fact that 9.2% of DCPS students are white, only 2 number among the\n\n3053 students at closing schools. See Levy Aff., ¶ 16. But unlike those two cases, the pattern\n\nhere is clearly “[]explainable on grounds other than race.” Indeed, it is explained by the single,\n\nrace-neutral justification for the school closings that DCPS has offered throughout: closing\n\nunder-enrolled schools will save resources that can then be spread throughout the school district\n\nto benefit all students. See generally Proposed Consolidation Plan; Final Consolidation Plan; see\n\nalso Proposed Consolidation Plan at 36 (listing race-neutral criteria used to sort schools); Final\n\nConsolidation Plan at 1 (same); id. at 4-5 (explaining decisions school by school). When faced\n\nwith a similar claim just last week, the Sixth Circuit recognized that this exact explanation\n\ndistinguishes the Supreme Court’s precedents: “[T]he defendants in the present case, unlike\n\nthose in Yick Wo and Gomillion, have offered a number of plausible nondiscriminatory\n\nexplanations for their reform efforts, chief among them tackling the school under-utilization\n\nproblem.” Spurlock v. Fox, No. 12-5978, 2013 WL 1920918, at *17 (6th Cir. May 10, 2013).\n\n                                                 16\n\fThis goal easily provides a rational basis for the school-closure decision. Whether the goal is\n\nwise and will ultimately be achieved are questions of policy beyond the reach of this Court.\n\n       Plaintiffs float several arguments why the reasons supporting the Plan are insufficiently\n\n“compelling” to justify its disparate impact: moving students often has a detrimental effect on\n\ntheir education, few school closures save significant money, and the District has invoked shifting\n\nrationales. See Reply at 19-22. But in so arguing, Plaintiffs employ the wrong standard. As\n\nlong as the Plan does not intentionally discriminate and is explainable on grounds other than\n\nrace, no compelling state interests are needed to sustain it. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S.\n\n229, 248 (1976) (“A rule that a statute designed to serve neutral ends is nevertheless invalid,\n\nabsent compelling justification, if in practice it benefits or burdens one race more than another[,]\n\nwould be far-reaching and would raise serious questions about, and perhaps invalidate, a whole\n\nrange of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more\n\nburdensome to the poor and to the average black than to the more affluent white.”). At the end\n\nof the day, Plaintiffs offer no evidence of intentional racial discrimination, and their efforts to\n\npaint DCPS’s rationales as pretextual are unavailing.\n\n       Although the statistics appear glaring, it is easy to see why the neutral criteria here have a\n\ndisparate racial effect. As the Sixth Circuit recognized last week, “[M]any school districts that\n\nare no longer segregated de jure remain segregated de facto due to private preferences reflected\n\nin housing patterns.” Spurlock, 2013 WL 1920918, at *1; see also Parents Involved in Cmty.\n\nSchs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 712 (2007) (describing de facto segregation in\n\nSeattle). Under-enrolled schools in the District are concentrated in areas of the city where the\n\nnumber of school-age children has decreased and where charter schools have thrived – areas that\n\nhappen to be almost exclusively black and Hispanic. Compare Proposed Consolidation Plan at\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f6-8 (showing charter-school enrollment and changes in population), and Reply, Exh. G (Map of\n\nD.C. Charter School Attendance), with Reply, Exh. I (Map of DCPS Schools Slated for Closure\n\nand Racial/Ethnic Make-Up of Affected Neighborhoods). Whatever way DCPS attempts to fix\n\nunder-enrolled schools, therefore, the effects (good and ill) will be felt almost exclusively by\n\nblack and Hispanic children.\n\n       Indeed, by ignoring the under-enrollment driving DCPS’s decision and focusing only on\n\nthe decision’s disparate effect on minorities, Plaintiffs have proffered a theory of discrimination\n\nwith no limit. See Spurlock, 2013 WL 1920918, at *11 (“But to accept the general claim that\n\ngeography-based school-assignment policies are unconstitutional because they are really nothing\n\nmore than race-based policies in disguise would mean that any neighborhood-school policy\n\nadopted in a community with racially identifiable housing patterns is unconstitutional.”). In\n\nother words, under Plaintiffs’ rationale, no school that is overwhelmingly black or Hispanic –\n\nwhich the majority of D.C. schools are – could ever be closed without impermissible\n\ndiscrimination. Similarly, the schools Turner and Williams’s children attend have utilization\n\nrates of 21-25%. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 17, 21; see also Turner Aff., ¶ 1; Williams\n\nAff., ¶ 1. If these rates are insufficient grounds for action, why should a 10% or 5% rate be any\n\ndifferent? Under Plaintiffs’ view, deserted schools in black and Hispanic parts of the city must\n\nbe left alone. At the same time, the subsidization of such institutions would fall\n\ndisproportionately on the shoulders of other black and Hispanic children, who make up 82.2% of\n\npublic-school enrollment citywide. See Levy Aff., ¶ 16.\n\n       In aid of their cause, Plaintiffs enlist some of the Supreme Court’s most exalted civil-\n\nrights cases. In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Court held\n\nthat schools segregated by law are inherently unequal, violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s\n\n                                                 18\n\fEqual Protection Clause, and have no place in the field of public education. In Bolling v.\n\nSharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), the Court extended Brown’s rule to the federal government,\n\nholding that “racial segregation in the public schools of the District of Columbia is a denial of\n\nthe due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.” Id. at 500. And\n\nin Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218 (1964), the Court\n\ncrushed a Virginia county’s ploy to evade integration, holding that the county could not close all\n\nof its public schools and then fund segregated, private schools.\n\n       In analogizing to those precedents here, Plaintiffs do not just miss the mark – they shoot\n\nin the wrong direction. By their own account, the District seeks to close and transfer students out\n\nof some of the most segregated schools in the city, where well over 99% of the students are black\n\nor Hispanic. Using Brown, Bolling, and Griffin to require the District to maintain de facto\n\nsegregated schools would invert the holdings of those great cases.\n\n       As DCPS’s publicly available data (which was discussed during the preliminary-\n\ninjunction hearing) show, moreover, the closing schools contain a far lower proportion of\n\nchildren performing proficiently in reading and math than the ones into which the kids will be\n\ntransferred. See Find a School, DCPS, http://profiles.dcps.dc.gov/ (last visited May 15, 2013).\n\nFor example, students from Marshall Elementary (23% math proficiency and 30% reading\n\nproficiency) will head to Langdon Educational Campus (56% and 57%). Davis Elementary\n\nstudents (25% and 34%) will attend Plummer Elementary (56% and 45%). And Plaintiff Smith’s\n\nown children from Ferebee-Hope Elementary (22% and 19%) will move to Hendley Elementary\n\n(44% and 36%).\n\n         The backward-looking nature of Plaintiffs’ proposed remedy illustrates the hollowness\n\nof their claims. The solution cannot be to force children to languish in more segregated, worse-\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fperforming, emptying schools. Those, in fact, are the conditions that draw lawsuits. See, e.g.,\n\nSpurlock, 2013 WL 1920918, at *7 (“The decline in the number and percentage of black students\n\nattending the relatively diverse and academically superior schools in the Hillwood Cluster is at\n\nthe heart of the present action.”).\n\n         To prevail on their constitutional and Civil Rights Act claims, Plaintiffs must show\n\nintentional discrimination. Above all, that means showing that Chancellor Henderson and Mayor\n\nGray closed the schools “at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects”\n\non blacks and Hispanics. Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. Because Plaintiffs have given no valid\n\nexplanation for why the Court could reasonably find such a discriminatory intent here, they have\n\nshown no likelihood of success on the merits of their Title VI and constitutional claims. 1\n\n         C. IDEA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act\n\n         Plaintiffs next assert that the school closings violate three disability statutes: the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973. The Court takes each in turn.\n\n                  1. IDEA\n\n         Least suited to the situation of school closings is the IDEA. At its core, this statute seeks\n\n“to ensure that all children with disabilities are provided a free appropriate public education\n\nwhich emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and\n\nto assure that the rights of such children and their parents or guardians are protected.” Forest\n\nGrove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239 (2009) (internal quotation marks and brackets\n\nomitted). The free appropriate public education guaranteed by the statute must conform with the\n\n         1\n           Also included in Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause claim are complaints about discrimination on the\nbasis of disability and location. See Compl., ¶ 87. As with racial discrimination, they offer no indication that the\ndisparate impact on disabled students reflects intentional discrimination. And while the proposed school closings\nhere (like all decisions a school district makes) intentionally discriminate on the basis of location, the resource\nsavings and improved educational benefits that DCPS aims for provide a rational basis for its decision.\n                                                          20\n\fchild’s “individualized education program” – an annual written statement for each child with a\n\ndisability that includes the child’s present levels of academic achievement, her goals for the next\n\nyear, and the school’s plan to meet those goals. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(9)(D), 1414(d)(1)(A). The\n\nchild must be placed in a school “as close as possible to the child’s home,” with the expectation\n\nthat generally “the child is educated in the school that he or she would attend if nondisabled.” 34\n\nC.F.R. §§ 300.116(b)(3), (c). In addition, “children with disabilities and their parents are\n\nguaranteed procedural safeguards,” allowing them to participate in writing in the individualized\n\neducation program and to bring administrative and then judicial challenges if anything goes\n\nawry. 20 U.S.C. § 1415.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, before bringing suit under the IDEA, a plaintiff must exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A). It appears Plaintiffs here have failed to\n\ndo so. They allege neither that they filed a complaint with DCPS nor that they pursued a\n\nhearing. Both are administrative prerequisites. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(b)(6), (f).\n\n       Perhaps they failed to file an administrative complaint because they could not fathom\n\nwhat IDEA-related grievances would allow them to block the school closures. In their two\n\nsentences explaining the alleged IDEA violation, Plaintiffs assert that the District (1) left the\n\nparents out of the decision to close schools and transfer the students, and (2) failed to identify\n\nreceiving special-education programs to meet the needs of students. See Mot. at 18. In the\n\ncontext of a statute focused on individualized education and process, Plaintiffs’ generalized\n\ncomplaints fall short. Yet even putting that problem aside, any relief that the IDEA could offer\n\nfor those problems would be specific to the child. Parents can complain if they believe their\n\nchildren are receiving an inadequate education, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6); deficient education\n\nplans can be revised to meet new circumstances, see 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(4)(A); and if the school\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fcannot provide a free and adequate public education, then the child’s parents may be able to get\n\nreimbursement for the cost of private education. See Forest Grove Sch. Dist., 557 U.S. at 232-\n\n33. None of these solutions, however, involves forcing doors at dramatically under-enrolled\n\nschools to remain open. Between their failure to exhaust and the disconnect with the relief\n\nsought, Plaintiffs have shown no likelihood of success on their IDEA claim.\n\n               2. ADA\n\n       Title II of the ADA requires that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason\n\nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\n\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. “To prove a violation of Title II, a party must therefore establish: (1) that he\n\nis a ‘qualified individual’ with a disability; (2) that he was excluded from participation in a\n\npublic entity’s services, programs or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by a public\n\nentity; and (3) that such exclusion or discrimination was due to his disability.” Mary Jo C. v.\n\nN.Y. State & Local Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 153 (2d Cir. 2013). Because the claim here does not\n\nmirror an IDEA claim, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l), no exhaustion is required. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12133; 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2).\n\n       To make out an ADA claim, a qualified individual with a disability must at least allege\n\nthe denial of “meaningful access to the benefit” in question. Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287,\n\n301 (1985). One could imagine the first step to a viable ADA claim here if, for example, the\n\nclosing schools offered services or programs that the new schools do not. Yet Plaintiffs here do\n\nnot make any such allegation because it appears that they will continue to receive the same\n\nbenefits in the new schools. While the Court does not minimize the disruption some disabled\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fchildren and their families may face in adapting to a new school environment, there is no denial\n\nof any benefit here.\n\n       Instead, the sole ADA theory that Plaintiffs promote is that the school closings “will have\n\na disproportionately adverse effect on students with disabilities” because there are nearly twice\n\nas many special-education students at the schools selected for closure as in DCPS as a whole.\n\nCompl., ¶¶ 70-71; see also Mot. at 17. In other words, the disparate-impact argument again. Just\n\nas with race, however, disparate impact alone does not show discrimination “by reason of”\n\ndisability. The Supreme Court explained why while discussing section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, a statute worded nearly identically to § 12132:\n\n               [T]he position urged by respondents – that we interpret § 504 to\n               reach all action disparately affecting the handicapped – is also\n               troubling. Because the handicapped typically are not similarly\n               situated to the nonhandicapped, respondents’ position would in\n               essence require each recipient of federal funds first to evaluate the\n               effect on the handicapped of every proposed action that might\n               touch the interests of the handicapped, and then to consider\n               alternatives for achieving the same objectives with less severe\n               disadvantage to the handicapped. The formalization and policing\n               of this process could lead to a wholly unwieldy administrative and\n               adjudicative burden. Had Congress intended § 504 to be a\n               National Environmental Policy Act for the handicapped, requiring\n               the preparation of “Handicapped Impact Statements” before any\n               action was taken by a grantee that affected the handicapped, we\n               would expect some indication of that purpose in the statute or its\n               legislative history. Yet there is nothing to suggest that such was\n               Congress’ purpose.\n\nChoate, 469 U.S. at 297-99 (citation and footnote omitted); see also Hunsaker v. Contra Coasta\n\nCounty, 149 F.3d 1041 (9th Cir. 1998) (same rule for § 12132); Am. Council of Blind v.\n\nPaulson, 525 F.3d 1256, 1260 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (“courts have tended to construe section 504\n\nin pari materia with Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132”).\n\n       Since Plaintiffs allege nothing more than disparate impact, and the Supreme Court has\n\n“reject[ed] the boundless notion that all disparate-impact showings constitute prima facie cases\n                                                23\n\funder § 504” (and thus § 12132), Choate, 469 U.S. at 299, their ADA claim is unlikely to\n\nsucceed on the merits.\n\n               3. Rehabilitation Act\n\n       The flaws of their IDEA and ADA claims doom Plaintiffs’ Rehabilitation Act count as\n\nwell. Section 504 of that statute, much like Title II of the ADA, directs that “[n]o otherwise\n\nqualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this\n\ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be\n\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\n\nFederal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794. Mirroring the IDEA, regulations promulgated to\n\nenforce section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require “[a] recipient that operates a public\n\nelementary or secondary education program or activity” to “provide a free appropriate public\n\neducation to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient’s jurisdiction, regardless\n\nof the nature or severity of the person’s handicap.” 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a); see also 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 104.1 (regulations in Part 104 effectuate section 504). A claim brought under section 504 that\n\nseeks relief that is also available under the IDEA, however, must be “exhausted to the same\n\nextent as would be required had the action been brought under” the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).\n\n       Plaintiffs base their Rehabilitation Act challenge on the District’s “failure to maintain a\n\nfree and appropriate education in Plaintiff’s neighborhood schools slated for closure.” Mot. at\n\n18. The exhaustion and merits deficiencies of the IDEA claim thus apply equally to this\n\nRehabilitation Act cause of action. See Section III.C.1, supra. To the extent Plaintiffs venture\n\nbeyond the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act count fails for the same reasons as the ADA one. See\n\nSection III.C.2, supra. Conclusory statements that the “treatment of special needs students rises\n\nto the level of discrimination based solely on the plaintiffs’ disabilities,” Compl., ¶ 77 – because\n\n                                                  24\n\fof the “relevant and unnecessary burdens thrust upon plaintiffs by closing these schools,” or the\n\n“bad faith” and “gross departure of accepted standards,” id. – offer no help. See Ashcroft v.\n\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,\n\nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”); Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286\n\n(1986) (courts “are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual\n\nallegation”). Plaintiffs have thus shown no likelihood of success on the Rehabilitation Act claim\n\neither.\n\n          D. D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n          With the DCHRA, Plaintiffs finally find the statute they have been seeking all along – a\n\nlaw where their bare showing of disparate impact forces the District to justify the school\n\nclosings. But here, too, Plaintiffs ultimately fall short. This conclusion also suggests that, even\n\nif Plaintiffs had successfully alleged discrimination under Title VI or the ADA or (aside from\n\nclaims of intentional racial discrimination triggering strict scrutiny) the Equal Protection Clause,\n\nsuccess on those claims would remain improbable.\n\n          The DCHRA states in part: “Except as otherwise provided for by District law or when\n\notherwise lawfully and reasonably permitted, it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for a\n\nDistrict government agency or office to limit or refuse to provide any facility, service, program,\n\nor benefit to any individual on the basis of an individual’s actual or perceived: race, . . .\n\ndisability, . . . or place of residence . . . .” D.C. Code § 2-1402.73. The Act’s “effects clause”\n\nbroadens protections in the District beyond those created by federal law: “Any practice which\n\nhas the effect or consequence of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed\n\nto be an unlawful discriminatory practice.” D.C. Code § 2-1402.68. Under that effects clause,\n\n“despite the absence of any intention to discriminate, practices are unlawful if they bear\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fdisproportionately on a protected class and are not independently justified for some\n\nnondiscriminatory reason.” Gay Rights Coal. of Georgetown Univ. Law Ctr. v. Georgetown\n\nUniv., 536 A.2d 1, 29 (D.C. 1987) (en banc); see also Jackson v. D.C. Bd. of Elections & Ethics,\n\n999 A.2d 89, 119 n.56 (D.C. 2010) (en banc) (same); Esteños v. PAHO/WHO Fed. Credit\n\nUnion, 952 A.2d 878, 887 (D.C. 2008). While the Court has found no effects-clause cases that\n\nconsider whether an act with a disparate impact is “independently justified for some\n\nnondiscriminatory reason,” the en banc D.C. Court of Appeals has explained that the clause\n\nimports “the concept of disparate impact discrimination developed by the Supreme Court in\n\nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971).” Gay Rights Coal., 536 A.2d at 29 (parallel\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n       Unlike Arlington Heights, which considered disparate impact in the constitutional equal-\n\nprotection context, Griggs concerned Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which forbids employers\n\nfrom maintaining discriminatory employment practices. Specifically, the Griggs Court\n\nconsidered whether an employer could require employees to graduate from high school or pass a\n\nstandardized general intelligence test, when neither requirement was “shown to be significantly\n\nrelated to successful job performance” and both requirements disqualified substantially more\n\nblack applicants than white. 401 U.S. at 425-26. Finding that Title VII “proscribes not only\n\novert discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation,” the\n\nCourt held that “[i]f an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be\n\nshown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.” Id. at 431. To maintain an\n\nemployment requirement with a disparate impact, “Congress has placed on the employer the\n\nburden of showing that any given requirement must have a manifest relationship to the\n\nemployment in question.” Id. at 432.\n\n                                                 26\n\f        According to Plaintiffs here, the effect of the school closings is discrimination on the\n\nbasis of race, disability, and residency. See Compl., ¶¶ 59-60. At the outset, the Court doubts\n\nthat forcibly transferring a student from one public school to another constitutes a denial of a\n\n“facility, service, program, or benefit” for purposes of the DCHRA. Under the Plan, the District\n\nwill continue to provide the student with a public education, and there is no reason to think that\n\nsuch education will be inferior to the one she currently receives. Nor has any court applied the\n\neffects clause to a situation like the one here. Cf. Boykin v. Gray, 895 F. Supp. 2d 199, 218\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (limiting § 2-1402.73 to selective denials of benefits explicitly based on protected\n\ncharacteristic so as not to “subject an unimaginable number of routine policy decisions to\n\nlitigation”).\n\n         If the closure of a school does constitute a sufficient denial of a benefit and the effects\n\nclause does apply with full force, however, the numbers bear out Plaintiffs’ claim of disparate\n\nimpact: While special-education students make up only 14.2% of the school district, they\n\ncomprise 27.7% of the students in the closing schools. See Levy Aff., ¶ 16. Black and Hispanic\n\nstudents make up 82.2% of the overall school district, but 99.6% in the schools to be closed. See\n\nid. And because school assignments depend on the child’s home address, the school closings\n\ndisproportionately affect people who reside in specific areas of the city. The school closings,\n\ntherefore, obviously bear disproportionately on black and Hispanic students, students with\n\ndisabilities, and students who reside east of the Park.\n\n        The game is not over, however. The burden then shifts to the District to show that the\n\nschool closings are “independently justified for some nondiscriminatory reason.” Gay Rights\n\nCoal., 536 A.2d at 29. This showing is evidently analogous to a showing, in the Title VII\n\ncontext, that an employment requirement has “a manifest relationship to the employment in\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fquestion.” Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432. Plaintiffs do not (and could not) question that certain DCPS\n\nschools are significantly under-enrolled, thanks to a decline in the number of children living in\n\nthe city and an increase in the number of charter schools. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 6-\n\n9. Those falling populations, moreover, are distributed unevenly across the city. For example,\n\nthe student population in Ward 3 – which lies entirely west of the Park – has grown, and its\n\nschools exceed capacity; Ward 8, on the other hand – at the southern tip of the city – has lost\n\nthousands of students, and its middle schools are at about 40% of capacity. See id. at 6-7. The\n\nschools attended by Plaintiffs’ children use 54%, 25%, and 21% of their building space. See id.\n\nat 17, 20-21; see also Smith Aff., ¶ 2 (Ferebee-Hope Elementary School); Turner Aff., ¶ 1\n\n(MacFarland Middle School); Williams Aff., ¶ 1 (Sharpe Health Elementary School).\n\n       By closing under-enrolled schools, DCPS aims to save money and improve education.\n\nAs the District explains, maintaining under-enrolled and small schools means unnecessarily\n\npaying for under-utilized facilities and staff – two half-full schools means two gyms, two heating\n\nbills, and two principals. See Final Consolidation Plan at 1. Small schools, moreover, cannot\n\nprovide many of the benefits that require economies of scale, such as art and music teachers,\n\nphysical education, and full-time librarians. See id. The District has estimated that closing these\n\nschools will save $8.5 million. See id. at 7 (broken down by school). While Plaintiffs question\n\nthe District’s analysis of the benefits, its projections appear realistic and sensible. In any event,\n\nit is not the place of this Court to reassess the wisdom of the District’s policy decisions. Because\n\nthe cost savings and resource allocation here independently justify the school closures, the\n\nDistrict meets its burden under the D.C. Human Rights Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f       E. Sunshine Amendment\n\n       Plaintiffs’ Complaint also tosses in a vague claim that the District “failed and continue[s]\n\nto fail to comply with the provisions of the Sunshine Amendment in the D.C. Self-Government\n\nAct which mandates transparency in local government decision-making, requiring that all such\n\ndecisions be done in open, public meetings. The decisions regarding the school closures were\n\ndone in the dark.” Compl., ¶ 67. Because Plaintiffs provide no facts to support that conclusory\n\nallegation (either in their Complaint or briefs), and because “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements\n\nof a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678, the Court need not consider the alleged violations of the Sunshine Amendment in deciding\n\nthis Motion.\n\n                                           *    *        *   *\n\n       Because Plaintiffs have shown no likelihood of success on the merits of their suit, the\n\nCourt need not review the other three preliminary-injunction factors. See Ark. Dairy Co-op\n\nAss’n, 573 F.3d at 832. If the Court were to reach the other prongs, however, on balance they\n\nhelp the District. Even assuming that every Equal Protection Clause violation constitutes an\n\nirreparable injury, see Mills v. District of Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“the\n\nloss of constitutional freedoms, ‘for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes\n\nirreparable injury’”) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion)), the\n\nbalance-of-equities and public-interest prongs tilt against Plaintiffs. In this case, three guardians\n\nof school children – proceeding individually rather than as a class – seek to hold up DCPS’s\n\nrestructuring of its school system. Most school closures are supposed to happen in two months.\n\nA preliminary injunction would wreak havoc by forcing everyone to simultaneously prepare for\n\ntwo contingencies. Schools (both closing and receiving) need to know whether they will have\n\n\n\n                                                    29\n\fstudents in the fall and, if so, who and how many. Teachers and staff need to know if and where\n\nthey will have jobs. Families need to know where their children will attend school. The costs of\n\nan injunction also weigh in the District’s favor. DCPS estimates that the school closings will\n\nsave $8.5 million, which works out to a reallocation of almost $200 for every student in the\n\nsystem.\n\n       On Plaintiffs’ side of the scale, by contrast, the harms are hard to spot. DCPS’s data\n\nshow that the Plan will reassign students to schools with significantly higher test scores and\n\nslightly more diversity. See generally Find a School, DCPS, http://profiles.dcps.dc.gov/ (last\n\nvisited May 15, 2013) (profiles for consolidating schools and receiving schools listed in Final\n\nConsolidation Plan at 4-5, 7). Head to head, both reading- and math-proficiency scores rise –\n\noften significantly – for 9 of the 11 closings schools with data available. Racial diversity is\n\nhardly robust in the receiving schools, but at least a handful of them have a nontrivial number of\n\nwhite students (as opposed to the total of two white students in all closing schools combined),\n\nand more have significant Hispanic populations. While test scores remain low and segregation\n\nremains high in absolute terms at even the receiving schools, the school closings at least move\n\nthose numbers in the right direction. Although Plaintiffs undoubtedly value their neighborhood\n\nschools, their injury seems slight given that their children – along with thousands of others – are\n\nmoving to better performing, more integrated schools.\n\n       In sum, Plaintiffs’ inability to show any likelihood of success on the merits alone\n\nprecludes a preliminary injunction here. When coupled with the other factors just mentioned,\n\ndenial of the Motion is the only appropriate course.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary\n\nInjunction. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day.\n\n                                                    /s/ James E.

Civil Action No. 13-420 (JEB)\nKAYA HENDERSON, Chancellor of the\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools, et al.,\n\n       Defendants.\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       The public-education landscape in the District of Columbia has changed. The advent of\n\npublic charter schools, coupled with demographic shifts, has resulted in substantially decreased\n\nenrollment in certain neighborhoods over the last fifteen years. In response, the District of\n\nColumbia Public Schools has promulgated its Consolidation and Reorganization Plan, which\n\ncloses fifteen under-utilized schools, reassigns those students, and reallocates the savings to other\n\nschools – all in an effort to maximize resources and improve education citywide. Plaintiffs –\n\nguardians of children who attend closing schools and Advisory Neighborhood Commission\n\nmembers whose districts allegedly comprise such schools – have brought this suit, claiming that\n\nthe closures violate a host of constitutional, federal, and state provisions. They assert, in essence,\n\nthat the closures discriminate against poor, minority, and disabled students and were enacted\n\nwithout sufficient ANC input. Hoping to block the implementation of the Plan, Plaintiffs now\n\nask this Court for a preliminary injunction.\n\n       Few topics, understandably, incite our passions more than the education of our children.\n\nToss into the mix the future of neighborhood institutions, whose familiarity and history may\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fresonate deeply, and quite a volatile brew emerges. It is thus hardly surprising that assorted\n\nconstituencies may possess varied opinions on the wisdom and necessity of the Plan and Schools\n\nChancellor Kaya Henderson’s strategy. Yet every adverse policy decision does not yield a\n\nconstitutional claim. In this case, there is no evidence whatsoever of any intent to discriminate\n\non the part of Defendants, who are actually transferring children out of weaker, more segregated,\n\nand under-enrolled schools. The remedy Plaintiffs seek – i.e., to remain in such schools – seems\n\ncurious, given that these are the conditions most people typically endeavor to escape. In any\n\nevent, as Plaintiffs have no likelihood of ultimate success on the merits of their suit, they cannot\n\nprevail in this Motion here.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       While the parties quarrel about the legal analysis, the underlying facts here are essentially\n\nuncontested.\n\n       A. Factual Background\n\n       The District of Columbia Public Schools runs the District’s traditional, local public-\n\nschool system. See D.C. Code §§ 38-171 to -172. As Chancellor, Kaya Henderson acts as\n\nDCPS’s chief executive officer. See D.C. Code § 38-174(a). Not all D.C. public schools fall\n\nwithin DCPS’s sphere, however. In 1996, Congress authorized the operation of charter schools\n\nin the District, which exist as public schools outside of DCPS control. See District of Columbia\n\nSchool Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-107 (1996). Since then,\n\nchildren in many parts of the city have flocked to charters; indeed, more than half of public-\n\nschool students in Wards 1, 5, and 7 and more than a third in Wards 4, 6, and 8 now attend\n\npublic charter schools instead of DCPS schools. See Opp., Exh. B (Office of Chancellor, DCPS,\n\nDCPS Proposed Consolidations and Reorganization: Better Schools for All Students (“Proposed\n\n                                                  2\n\fConsolidation Plan”) (Nov. 15, 2012)) at 8. By contrast, only 14% of students in Ward 2 attend\n\ncharters, and no Ward 3 student does. See id. The number of school-age children has likewise\n\nfallen across the city, although – again – unevenly. While the population of school-age children\n\nin the last ten years has decreased by at least 1500 children in each of Wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8\n\n(including nearly 4000 in Ward 8), Ward 2 has lost only 761 children, and Ward 3 has actually\n\ngained 272 children during that time. See id. at 7. As a result, many DCPS schools are only\n\npartially full – particularly in certain parts of the city.\n\n        Responding to these demographic shifts and after obtaining recommendations from an\n\neducational consulting company, see Opp., Exh. A (Memorandum from Educ. Res. Strategies to\n\nChancellor Henderson (Aug. 17, 2012)), in November 2012, Chancellor Henderson proposed\n\nclosing twenty under-enrolled DCPS schools over the next two years. See Proposed\n\nConsolidation Plan at 16. Most of those slated for closure used less than half of their buildings’\n\ncapacities, and five schools had building-utilization rates under 25%. See id. at 17-22. DCPS\n\nexplained that closing these under-enrolled schools would decrease overhead, allowing schools\n\nto spend less per pupil, while putting more students in modern facilities and giving more students\n\naccess to programs and staff that can be justified only for large schools, thereby improving the\n\noverall quality of education. See id. at 10-14. Plaintiffs question whether the closings will\n\nactually bring down spending, pointing out that similar benefits projected from DCPS closures in\n\n2008 never materialized. See Reply at 3 & n.4 (citing Exh. F (Yolanda Branche, D.C. Auditor,\n\nAudit of the Closure and Consolidation of 23 Public Schools (Sept. 6, 2012))). Fourteen of the\n\ntwenty schools proposed for closure were in Wards 5, 7, and 8, plus two schools each in Wards\n\n2, 4, and 6. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 16. The proposal suggested no changes in\n\nWards 1 or 3. See id. at 23 (building-utilization rate is 74% in Ward 1 and 109% in Ward 3).\n\n\n\n                                                     3\n\f       To promote its proposal and gather community feedback, DCPS took its show on the\n\nroad. The City Council held two hearings on the closures. See Opp., Exh. D (Office of\n\nChancellor, DCPS, Better Schools for All Students: DCPS’ Consolidation and Reorganization\n\nPlan (“Final Consolidation Plan”) (Jan. 2013)) at 2. DCPS itself convened meetings throughout\n\nthe city, including four ward-based public meetings that drew 780 participants. See id. In\n\naddition, DCPS e-mailed ANC Commissioners with schools slated for closure in their districts,\n\nalong with some of the incoming ANC Commissioners-elect, to ask for reactions. See Defs.\n\nNotice of Correction & Clarification, Exh. A (Decl. of Shanita Burney, Exh. 1 (E-mail from\n\nJosephine Robinson, DCPS, to ANC Commissioners (Nov. 13, 2012))). DCPS also sent a\n\nsummary of the proposal home in the backpack of every child attending a school on the closure\n\nlist. See Opp., Exh. C (Decl. of Peter Weber), ¶ 7.\n\n       This desire for community input was no charade. On the contrary, the feedback yielded\n\nreal changes in DCPS’s final Plan, released January 17, 2013. Five schools proposed for closure\n\nwill now remain open: two in Ward 2, one in Ward 7, and two in Ward 8. See Final\n\nConsolidation Plan at 4-5. At five other schools, moreover, assignments for the departing\n\nstudents changed. See id. In choosing schools to receive the students, DCPS particularly\n\nfocused on “safety and walkability.” Id. at 7. DCPS estimated that savings from the revised\n\nproposal would total $8.5 million, see id. – an estimate that Plaintiffs, of course, contest – which\n\nsum would then be plowed back into schools throughout the city. See id. at 6.\n\n       All fifteen schools on the final closure list lie east of Rock Creek Park, a historical\n\ndividing line within the city. East of the Park, residents are generally poorer and\n\noverwhelmingly black and Hispanic; west of the Park, residents are wealthier and mostly white.\n\nThe halls of the closing schools reflect those demographics. In DCPS schools as a whole, 68.4%\n\n                                                 4\n\fof students are black; 13.8% are Hispanic; 3.7% are Asian, other, or unknown; and 9.2% are\n\nwhite. See Mot., Exh. A (Aff. of Mary Levy), ¶ 16. In the schools slated for closure, by\n\ncontrast, 93.7% of students are black; 5.9% are Hispanic; 0.4% are Asian, other, or unknown;\n\nand less than 0.1% (2 out of 3053) are white. See id. The figures skew similarly, if less starkly,\n\nfor disabled students: 27.7% of students in the closing schools are in special education, versus\n\n14.2% of students in DCPS overall. See id.\n\n       The D.C. Council will meet on May 22 to consider the Mayor’s proposed budget, which\n\nreflects the school closures. While the Council (like any other legislative body) may alter\n\nfunding levels, see D.C. Code § 38-173(b), the District assured the Court during the preliminary-\n\ninjunction hearing that the Mayor’s decision to proceed with the school consolidation is final.\n\nThe school-closure Plan is therefore ripe for judicial review.\n\n       B. Procedural Background\n\n       Seeking to block implementation of the Plan, five Plaintiffs filed this suit in D.C.\n\nSuperior Court on March 29, 2013, naming Chancellor Henderson, Mayor Vincent Gray, and the\n\nDistrict of Columbia as Defendants. (The Court will collectively refer to all Defendants as “the\n\nDistrict.”) Two Plaintiffs – Karlene Armstead and Ericka Black – are ANC Commissioners who\n\nsay they never received the legally required notice of the school closures. See Compl., ¶¶ 2, 5,\n\n65. The other three Plaintiffs – Shannon Smith, Marlece Turner, and Brenda Williams – are\n\nguardians of children who attend schools slated for closure. See Mot., Exh. D (Aff. of Shannon\n\nSmith), ¶¶ 1-2; Mot., Exh. E (Aff. of Marlece Turner), ¶ 1; Mot., Exh. G (Aff. of Brenda\n\nWilliams), ¶ 1. All of the guardians’ children are black or Hispanic and live east of the Park.\n\nSee Compl., ¶¶ 28, 30. Two have serious disabilities that will allegedly make the disruptions\n\ncaused by the school closures particularly difficult. See Turner Aff., ¶¶ 5, 9-10 (Asperger’s and\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fADHD); Williams Aff., ¶¶ 1-2, 7, 9 (unable to walk or talk and frequent seizures). While the\n\nComplaint does not say so directly, both sides have assumed that Smith, Turner, and Williams\n\nsue on behalf of their children as next friends, and the Court will make the same assumption for\n\npurposes of this Opinion, although subsequent amendment should make this explicit.\n\n        In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the District violated D.C. statutes requiring\n\nnotice to ANC Commissioners and consideration of their views, the D.C. Sunshine Amendment,\n\nthe Constitution’s equal-protection guarantee (asserted under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities\n\nAct, the Rehabilitation Act, and the D.C. Human Rights Act. See Compl., ¶¶ 56-94.\n\n        Simultaneous with the filing of their Complaint, Plaintiffs moved for a temporary\n\nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction. The District removed the case to federal court on\n\nApril 2, and the next day, the Court held a joint telephone call with the parties. Because\n\nPlaintiffs did not need a decision until May 22, they agreed to withdraw their TRO motion and\n\nproceed solely with their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. The Court held a hearing on that\n\nMotion on May 10, and this Opinion follows five days later.\n\nII.     Legal Standard\n\n        A preliminary injunction “is an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a\n\nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. NRDC, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145928\"><a href=\"/opinion/145928/winter-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Before the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, courts weighed\n\nthe preliminary-injunction factors on a sliding scale, allowing a weak showing on one factor to\n\n                                                   6\n\fbe overcome by a strong showing on another.

This Circuit, however, has suggested, without deciding, that\n\nWinter should be read to abandon the sliding-scale analysis in favor of a “more demanding\n\nburden” requiring Plaintiffs to independently demonstrate both a likelihood of success on the\n\nmerits and irreparable harm.

It follows that, upon finding that a plaintiff has\n\nfailed to show a likelihood of success on the merits, the Court may deny a motion for preliminary\n\ninjunction without analyzing the remaining factors.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fIII.   Analysis\n\n       Mapping onto the two categories of Plaintiffs in this case are the two types of claims\n\nbrought: the ANC Commissioners assert process-related claims, while the guardians of children\n\nwho attend closing schools submit civil-rights claims. As always, the Court must begin with\n\njurisdiction – here, with questions about standing. Because standing appears an insurmountable\n\nhurdle for the ANC Commissioners, the Court need look no further at their claims. Instead, it\n\nmay move straight to the guardians’ civil-rights counts. Grouping similar legal theories together,\n\nthe Court will begin its merits analysis with the alleged violations of the Equal Protection Clause\n\nand Title VI. Next, it will examine the IDEA, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act. It will end\n\nwith the DCHRA and the Sunshine Amendment.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ opening brief provides only the barest sketch of their legal arguments, focusing\n\ninstead on policy positions better directed to the government’s other branches. In their Reply,\n\nPlaintiffs double down on their Equal Protection Clause argument, explaining it more\n\nthoroughly, but almost completely ignore their other civil-rights claims. Taking that emphasis as\n\na signal of where Plaintiffs believe they are most likely to succeed on the merits, the Court pays\n\nspecial attention to this question and, conversely, declines to search out arguments Plaintiffs\n\ncould have made in support of their other civil-rights causes of action.\n\n       A.

Standing for a procedural injury is “special,” however, because a “person who\n\nhas been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without\n\nmeeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 572 n.7.\n\n“A plaintiff who alleges a deprivation of a procedural protection to which he is entitled never has\n\nto prove that if he had received the procedure the substantive result would have been altered.

By way of\n\nbackground: in the District’s distinctively structured government, the city is divided into wards,\n\nthe wards into Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, and the ANCs into single-member\n\ndistricts. ANCs may comment on a vast array of actions proposed by the District government,\n\nand any concerns they raise must be given “great weight” during deliberations by governmental\n\nentities. See D.C. Code §§ 1-309.10(a), (d)(3)(A). To weigh in on a specific proposal, ANC\n\nCommissioners obviously need to know that it is under consideration. Thus, at least 30 days\n\nbefore proposed actions, “written notice . . . shall be given by first-class mail to . . . the\n\nCommissioner representing a single-member district affected by said actions.” D.C. Code\n\n§ 1-309.10(b). While the statute requires written notice by first-class mail, actual notice cures a\n\ntechnical violation of the requirement, as long as the ANC has enough time to comment.

Conceding it never\n\nprovided formal notice (i.e., by first-class mail) here, the District argues it did give the proper\n\nANC Commissioners actual notice (i.e., by e-mail and otherwise). The Court need not resolve\n\nthis question to decide the issue of standing.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that the school closings cannot go forward because Armstead and Black\n\nnever received sufficient notice of the proposal. Before a court can invalidate an improperly\n\nnoticed government action, however, a plaintiff with standing must sue about the defect.\n\n                                                   10\n\fContrary to Plaintiffs’ urgings, Armstead and Black possess no special powers from their official\n\nroles as ANC Commissioners because D.C. law bars such people from bringing suit in their\n\nofficial capacity. See Kopff, 381 A.2d at 1376-77 (“In summary, ANCs 3-C and 3-F, as well as\n\nthe Commissioners of each in their official rolls [sic], have no capacity to assert the claims in this\n\npetition for review and must be dismissed as parties.”) (citing statute now codified at D.C. Code\n\n§ 1-309.10(g)). This means that an ANC or its Commissioners cannot simply rush to court every\n\ntime they do not receive notice. Instead, suits must be brought either by ANC Commissioners in\n\ntheir private capacities or by the residents the Commissioner represents. See id. (“Our\n\nconclusion, however, does not mean that the ANCs’ right to advise cannot be protected. To the\n\ncontrary, we hold that ANC area residents (including ANC Commissioners as individual\n\ncitizens) have standing to initiate legal action to assert the rights of the ANC itself.”). The ANC\n\nclaim here, therefore, requires either Armstead or Black to have standing in her personal\n\ncapacity.\n\n       In assessing such standing, the starting point is to recall that lack of notice is a procedural\n\ninjury. See N.B. ex rel. Peacock v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82-83 (D.C. Cir. 2012).\n\nWhile a procedural injury relaxes the immediacy and redressability showings typically required\n\nfor standing – e.g., neither Commissioner need show her ANC’s input would have altered the\n\nDCPS Plan – a plaintiff must still show that the substantive result (here, implementation of the\n\nPlan) has caused her an injury in fact: “[D]eprivation of a procedural right without some concrete\n\ninterest that is affected by the deprivation – a procedural right in vacuo – is insufficient to create\n\nArticle III standing. Only a ‘person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his\n\nconcrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability\n\nand immediacy.’” Summers v.

Cir. 2011); Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 664-65. Here, that means at\n\nleast one Commissioner Plaintiff must show that the school closures connected with the deficient\n\nnotice actually injured her.\n\n       Employing this framework, it becomes manifest that Armstead and Black lack standing\n\nto sue in their personal capacities for two independent reasons. First, neither suffered a\n\nprocedural injury in the first place. When the District considers an action, it need not inform\n\nevery ANC Commissioner; it must give notice only to those Commissioners “representing a\n\nsingle-member district affected by said action[].” D.C. Code § 1-309.10(b). Although she had\n\nrecently been elected ANC Commissioner, Armstead had not yet taken office when DCPS\n\nproposed the closures. See Burney Decl., ¶¶ 8-10. Because she was not a Commissioner at the\n\ntime and thus had no right to weigh in on the Plan, the District had no duty to give her notice,\n\nand no procedural injury was thus inflicted upon her. As to Black, the District has argued\n\n(without drawing any protest from Plaintiffs) that the single-member districts “affected” by the\n\nPlan are districts with schools proposed for closure within their borders. From the District’s\n\nevidence, it appears that no such schools were in Black’s single-member district. See id., ¶ 7; E-\n\nmail from Robinson to ANC Commissioners (November 2012 e-mail about closure proposal sent\n\nto 20 ANC Commissioners – presumably those representing the 20 schools proposed for\n\nclosure). So Black seems similarly unentitled to notice of the closures, which would mean that\n\nshe also suffered no procedural injury.\n\n       Second, even if Armstead and Black should have been given notice, neither has averred\n\nthat she was concretely injured by the school closures. In other words, neither here claims to\n\nhave a child in a closing school or gives any other reason that she herself was hurt by the\n\n                                                12\n\fclosures. As “[t]he mere violation of a procedural requirement . . . does not permit any and all\n\npersons to sue to enforce the requirement,” Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d at 664, Armstead and\n\nBlack can press their claim no further. See United Transp. Union v. ICC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533772\"><a href=\"/opinion/533772/united-transportation-union-v-interstate-commerce-commission-and-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 918\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (“[B]efore we find standing in procedural injury cases, we must ensure that\n\nthere is some connection between the alleged procedural injury and a substantive injury that\n\nwould otherwise confer Article III standing. Without such a nexus, the procedural injury\n\ndoctrine could swallow Article III standing requirements.”) (citation omitted). As standing is a\n\nnecessary “predicate to any exercise of [the Court’s] jurisdiction,” Fla. Audubon Soc’y, 94 F.3d\n\nat 663, the Commissioners and their claims have no likelihood of success on the merits.\n\n                3. Civil-Rights Claims\n\n        Unlike the Commissioners, Plaintiffs Smith, Turner, and Williams, as next friend for their\n\nrespective children, each clearly do have standing to challenge the closure of the schools their\n\nchildren attend. All have filed declarations describing disruptions and inconveniences their\n\nchildren will allegedly suffer as a result of the transfer, see Smith Aff., ¶ 5; Turner Aff., ¶¶ 9-10;\n\nWilliams Aff., ¶¶ 2, 7-9, which suffice to provide Article III standing. The District concedes that\n\nthese Plaintiffs have standing, but argues that such standing extends only to the closure of their\n\nown schools, not to all of the schools in the Plan. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs, however, that\n\nthe civil-rights claims they bring allege that the whole Plan – instead of any individual school\n\nclosure – is discriminatory, entitling them to challenge the Plan in its entirety. When a law\n\nunconstitutionally discriminates, the entire law falls – not just its application to the plaintiffs with\n\nstanding. See Erwin Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law 721 (3d ed. 2006) (remedy for equal-\n\nprotection violation is “simply invalidating the discriminatory law”). The same principle also\n\ngoverns Plaintiffs’ other civil-rights claims. This makes sense here, given that the District’s\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fjustifications for the Plan are no different for the three Plaintiffs’ schools than for the others\n\nbeing closed.\n\n        As jurisdiction is established only for the non-Commissioner Plaintiffs, the Court can\n\nnow proceed to the merits of their claims.\n\n        B. Equal Protection Clause and Title VI\n\n        The Court begins with Plaintiffs’ primary cause of action – unconstitutional racial\n\ndiscrimination. While their suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 also alleges that the District’s decision\n\ndiscriminates on the basis of disability and residence in violation of the Equal Protection Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment (which applies to the District through the Fifth Amendment Due\n\nProcess Clause), see Compl., ¶ 87, they focus particularly on discrimination based on race. See\n\nReply at 13-24. Plaintiffs also list a count under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\nalleging discrimination based on race, color, and national origin by the District, a recipient of\n\nfederal funding. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of\n\nrace, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial\n\nassistance.”).\n\n        At the threshold, the District objects that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative\n\nremedies before bringing their Title VI claim.

See Levy Aff., ¶ 16. But unlike those two cases, the pattern\n\nhere is clearly “[]explainable on grounds other than race.” Indeed, it is explained by the single,\n\nrace-neutral justification for the school closings that DCPS has offered throughout: closing\n\nunder-enrolled schools will save resources that can then be spread throughout the school district\n\nto benefit all students. See generally Proposed Consolidation Plan; Final Consolidation Plan; see\n\nalso Proposed Consolidation Plan at 36 (listing race-neutral criteria used to sort schools); Final\n\nConsolidation Plan at 1 (same); id. at 4-5 (explaining decisions school by school). When faced\n\nwith a similar claim just last week, the Sixth Circuit recognized that this exact explanation\n\ndistinguishes the Supreme Court’s precedents: “[T]he defendants in the present case, unlike\n\nthose in Yick Wo and Gomillion, have offered a number of plausible nondiscriminatory\n\nexplanations for their reform efforts, chief among them tackling the school under-utilization\n\nproblem.” Spurlock v.

Whether the goal is\n\nwise and will ultimately be achieved are questions of policy beyond the reach of this Court.\n\n       Plaintiffs float several arguments why the reasons supporting the Plan are insufficiently\n\n“compelling” to justify its disparate impact: moving students often has a detrimental effect on\n\ntheir education, few school closures save significant money, and the District has invoked shifting\n\nrationales. See Reply at 19-22. But in so arguing, Plaintiffs employ the wrong standard. As\n\nlong as the Plan does not intentionally discriminate and is explainable on grounds other than\n\nrace, no compelling state interests are needed to sustain it. See Washington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1976) (“A rule that a statute designed to serve neutral ends is nevertheless invalid,\n\nabsent compelling justification, if in practice it benefits or burdens one race more than another[,]\n\nwould be far-reaching and would raise serious questions about, and perhaps invalidate, a whole\n\nrange of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more\n\nburdensome to the poor and to the average black than to the more affluent white.”). At the end\n\nof the day, Plaintiffs offer no evidence of intentional racial discrimination, and their efforts to\n\npaint DCPS’s rationales as pretextual are unavailing.\n\n       Although the statistics appear glaring, it is easy to see why the neutral criteria here have a\n\ndisparate racial effect. As the Sixth Circuit recognized last week, “[M]any school districts that\n\nare no longer segregated de jure remain segregated de facto due to private preferences reflected\n\nin housing patterns.” Spurlock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1920918</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1; see also Parents Involved in Cmty.\n\nSchs. v.

Under-enrolled schools in the District are concentrated in areas of the city where the\n\nnumber of school-age children has decreased and where charter schools have thrived – areas that\n\nhappen to be almost exclusively black and Hispanic. Compare Proposed Consolidation Plan at\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f6-8 (showing charter-school enrollment and changes in population), and Reply, Exh. G (Map of\n\nD.C. Charter School Attendance), with Reply, Exh. I (Map of DCPS Schools Slated for Closure\n\nand Racial/Ethnic Make-Up of Affected Neighborhoods). Whatever way DCPS attempts to fix\n\nunder-enrolled schools, therefore, the effects (good and ill) will be felt almost exclusively by\n\nblack and Hispanic children.\n\n       Indeed, by ignoring the under-enrollment driving DCPS’s decision and focusing only on\n\nthe decision’s disparate effect on minorities, Plaintiffs have proffered a theory of discrimination\n\nwith no limit. See Spurlock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1920918</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 (“But to accept the general claim that\n\ngeography-based school-assignment policies are unconstitutional because they are really nothing\n\nmore than race-based policies in disguise would mean that any neighborhood-school policy\n\nadopted in a community with racially identifiable housing patterns is unconstitutional.”). In\n\nother words, under Plaintiffs’ rationale, no school that is overwhelmingly black or Hispanic –\n\nwhich the majority of D.C. schools are – could ever be closed without impermissible\n\ndiscrimination. Similarly, the schools Turner and Williams’s children attend have utilization\n\nrates of 21-25%. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 17, 21; see also Turner Aff., ¶ 1; Williams\n\nAff., ¶ 1. If these rates are insufficient grounds for action, why should a 10% or 5% rate be any\n\ndifferent? Under Plaintiffs’ view, deserted schools in black and Hispanic parts of the city must\n\nbe left alone. At the same time, the subsidization of such institutions would fall\n\ndisproportionately on the shoulders of other black and Hispanic children, who make up 82.2% of\n\npublic-school enrollment citywide. See Levy Aff., ¶ 16.\n\n       In aid of their cause, Plaintiffs enlist some of the Supreme Court’s most exalted civil-\n\nrights cases. In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954), the Court held\n\nthat schools segregated by law are inherently unequal, violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s\n\n                                                 18\n\fEqual Protection Clause, and have no place in the field of public education.

By their own account, the District seeks to close and transfer students out\n\nof some of the most segregated schools in the city, where well over 99% of the students are black\n\nor Hispanic. Using Brown, Bolling, and Griffin to require the District to maintain de facto\n\nsegregated schools would invert the holdings of those great cases.\n\n       As DCPS’s publicly available data (which was discussed during the preliminary-\n\ninjunction hearing) show, moreover, the closing schools contain a far lower proportion of\n\nchildren performing proficiently in reading and math than the ones into which the kids will be\n\ntransferred. See Find a School, DCPS, http://profiles.dcps.dc.gov/ (last visited May 15, 2013).\n\nFor example, students from Marshall Elementary (23% math proficiency and 30% reading\n\nproficiency) will head to Langdon Educational Campus (56% and 57%). Davis Elementary\n\nstudents (25% and 34%) will attend Plummer Elementary (56% and 45%). And Plaintiff Smith’s\n\nown children from Ferebee-Hope Elementary (22% and 19%) will move to Hendley Elementary\n\n(44% and 36%).\n\n         The backward-looking nature of Plaintiffs’ proposed remedy illustrates the hollowness\n\nof their claims. The solution cannot be to force children to languish in more segregated, worse-\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fperforming, emptying schools. Those, in fact, are the conditions that draw lawsuits. See, e.g.,\n\nSpurlock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1920918</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (“The decline in the number and percentage of black students\n\nattending the relatively diverse and academically superior schools in the Hillwood Cluster is at\n\nthe heart of the present action.”).\n\n         To prevail on their constitutional and Civil Rights Act claims, Plaintiffs must show\n\nintentional discrimination. Above all, that means showing that Chancellor Henderson and Mayor\n\nGray closed the schools “at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects”\n\non blacks and Hispanics. Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. Because Plaintiffs have given no valid\n\nexplanation for why the Court could reasonably find such a discriminatory intent here, they have\n\nshown no likelihood of success on the merits of their Title VI and constitutional claims. 1\n\n         C. IDEA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act\n\n         Plaintiffs next assert that the school closings violate three disability statutes: the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973. The Court takes each in turn.\n\n                  1. IDEA\n\n         Least suited to the situation of school closings is the IDEA. At its core, this statute seeks\n\n“to ensure that all children with disabilities are provided a free appropriate public education\n\nwhich emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and\n\nto assure that the rights of such children and their parents or guardians are protected.” Forest\n\nGrove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145855\"><a href=\"/opinion/145855/forest-grove-school-dist-v-t-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (2009) (internal quotation marks and brackets\n\nomitted). The free appropriate public education guaranteed by the statute must conform with the\n\n         1\n           Also included in Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause claim are complaints about discrimination on the\nbasis of disability and location. See Compl., ¶ 87. As with racial discrimination, they offer no indication that the\ndisparate impact on disabled students reflects intentional discrimination. And while the proposed school closings\nhere (like all decisions a school district makes) intentionally discriminate on the basis of location, the resource\nsavings and improved educational benefits that DCPS aims for provide a rational basis for its decision.\n                                                          20\n\fchild’s “individualized education program” – an annual written statement for each child with a\n\ndisability that includes the child’s present levels of academic achievement, her goals for the next\n\nyear, and the school’s plan to meet those goals. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(9)(D), 1414(d)(1)(A). The\n\nchild must be placed in a school “as close as possible to the child’s home,” with the expectation\n\nthat generally “the child is educated in the school that he or she would attend if nondisabled.” 34\n\nC.F.R. §§ 300.116(b)(3), (c). In addition, “children with disabilities and their parents are\n\nguaranteed procedural safeguards,” allowing them to participate in writing in the individualized\n\neducation program and to bring administrative and then judicial challenges if anything goes\n\nawry. 20 U.S.C. § 1415.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, before bringing suit under the IDEA, a plaintiff must exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A). It appears Plaintiffs here have failed to\n\ndo so. They allege neither that they filed a complaint with DCPS nor that they pursued a\n\nhearing. Both are administrative prerequisites. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(b)(6), (f).\n\n       Perhaps they failed to file an administrative complaint because they could not fathom\n\nwhat IDEA-related grievances would allow them to block the school closures. In their two\n\nsentences explaining the alleged IDEA violation, Plaintiffs assert that the District (1) left the\n\nparents out of the decision to close schools and transfer the students, and (2) failed to identify\n\nreceiving special-education programs to meet the needs of students. See Mot. at 18. In the\n\ncontext of a statute focused on individualized education and process, Plaintiffs’ generalized\n\ncomplaints fall short. Yet even putting that problem aside, any relief that the IDEA could offer\n\nfor those problems would be specific to the child. Parents can complain if they believe their\n\nchildren are receiving an inadequate education, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6); deficient education\n\nplans can be revised to meet new circumstances, see 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(4)(A); and if the school\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fcannot provide a free and adequate public education, then the child’s parents may be able to get\n\nreimbursement for the cost of private education. See Forest Grove Sch. Dist., 557 U.S. at 232-\n\n33. None of these solutions, however, involves forcing doors at dramatically under-enrolled\n\nschools to remain open. Between their failure to exhaust and the disconnect with the relief\n\nsought, Plaintiffs have shown no likelihood of success on their IDEA claim.\n\n               2. ADA\n\n       Title II of the ADA requires that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason\n\nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\n\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. “To prove a violation of Title II, a party must therefore establish: (1) that he\n\nis a ‘qualified individual’ with a disability; (2) that he was excluded from participation in a\n\npublic entity’s services, programs or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by a public\n\nentity; and (3) that such exclusion or discrimination was due to his disability.” Mary Jo C. v.\n\nN.Y. State & Local Ret. Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153 (2d Cir. 2013). Because the claim here does not\n\nmirror an IDEA claim, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l), no exhaustion is required. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12133; 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2).\n\n       To make out an ADA claim, a qualified individual with a disability must at least allege\n\nthe denial of “meaningful access to the benefit” in question. Alexander v. Choate, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n301 (1985). One could imagine the first step to a viable ADA claim here if, for example, the\n\nclosing schools offered services or programs that the new schools do not. Yet Plaintiffs here do\n\nnot make any such allegation because it appears that they will continue to receive the same\n\nbenefits in the new schools. While the Court does not minimize the disruption some disabled\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fchildren and their families may face in adapting to a new school environment, there is no denial\n\nof any benefit here.\n\n       Instead, the sole ADA theory that Plaintiffs promote is that the school closings “will have\n\na disproportionately adverse effect on students with disabilities” because there are nearly twice\n\nas many special-education students at the schools selected for closure as in DCPS as a whole.\n\nCompl., ¶¶ 70-71; see also Mot. at 17. In other words, the disparate-impact argument again. Just\n\nas with race, however, disparate impact alone does not show discrimination “by reason of”\n\ndisability. The Supreme Court explained why while discussing section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, a statute worded nearly identically to § 12132:\n\n               [T]he position urged by respondents – that we interpret § 504 to\n               reach all action disparately affecting the handicapped – is also\n               troubling. Because the handicapped typically are not similarly\n               situated to the nonhandicapped, respondents’ position would in\n               essence require each recipient of federal funds first to evaluate the\n               effect on the handicapped of every proposed action that might\n               touch the interests of the handicapped, and then to consider\n               alternatives for achieving the same objectives with less severe\n               disadvantage to the handicapped. The formalization and policing\n               of this process could lead to a wholly unwieldy administrative and\n               adjudicative burden. Had Congress intended § 504 to be a\n               National Environmental Policy Act for the handicapped, requiring\n               the preparation of “Handicapped Impact Statements” before any\n               action was taken by a grantee that affected the handicapped, we\n               would expect some indication of that purpose in the statute or its\n               legislative history.

Cir. 2008) (“courts have tended to construe section 504\n\nin pari materia with Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132”).\n\n       Since Plaintiffs allege nothing more than disparate impact, and the Supreme Court has\n\n“reject[ed] the boundless notion that all disparate-impact showings constitute prima facie cases\n                                                23\n\funder § 504” (and thus § 12132), Choate, 469 U.S. at 299, their ADA claim is unlikely to\n\nsucceed on the merits.\n\n               3. Rehabilitation Act\n\n       The flaws of their IDEA and ADA claims doom Plaintiffs’ Rehabilitation Act count as\n\nwell. Section 504 of that statute, much like Title II of the ADA, directs that “[n]o otherwise\n\nqualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this\n\ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be\n\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\n\nFederal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794. Mirroring the IDEA, regulations promulgated to\n\nenforce section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require “[a] recipient that operates a public\n\nelementary or secondary education program or activity” to “provide a free appropriate public\n\neducation to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient’s jurisdiction, regardless\n\nof the nature or severity of the person’s handicap.” 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a); see also 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 104.1 (regulations in Part 104 effectuate section 504). A claim brought under section 504 that\n\nseeks relief that is also available under the IDEA, however, must be “exhausted to the same\n\nextent as would be required had the action been brought under” the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).\n\n       Plaintiffs base their Rehabilitation Act challenge on the District’s “failure to maintain a\n\nfree and appropriate education in Plaintiff’s neighborhood schools slated for closure.” Mot. at\n\n18. The exhaustion and merits deficiencies of the IDEA claim thus apply equally to this\n\nRehabilitation Act cause of action. See Section III.C.1, supra. To the extent Plaintiffs venture\n\nbeyond the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act count fails for the same reasons as the ADA one. See\n\nSection III.C.2, supra. Conclusory statements that the “treatment of special needs students rises\n\nto the level of discrimination based solely on the plaintiffs’ disabilities,” Compl., ¶ 77 – because\n\n                                                  24\n\fof the “relevant and unnecessary burdens thrust upon plaintiffs by closing these schools,” or the\n\n“bad faith” and “gross departure of accepted standards,” id. – offer no help.

Plaintiffs have thus shown no likelihood of success on the Rehabilitation Act claim\n\neither.\n\n          D. D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n          With the DCHRA, Plaintiffs finally find the statute they have been seeking all along – a\n\nlaw where their bare showing of disparate impact forces the District to justify the school\n\nclosings. But here, too, Plaintiffs ultimately fall short. This conclusion also suggests that, even\n\nif Plaintiffs had successfully alleged discrimination under Title VI or the ADA or (aside from\n\nclaims of intentional racial discrimination triggering strict scrutiny) the Equal Protection Clause,\n\nsuccess on those claims would remain improbable.\n\n          The DCHRA states in part: “Except as otherwise provided for by District law or when\n\notherwise lawfully and reasonably permitted, it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for a\n\nDistrict government agency or office to limit or refuse to provide any facility, service, program,\n\nor benefit to any individual on the basis of an individual’s actual or perceived: race, . . .\n\ndisability, . . . or place of residence . . . .” D.C. Code § 2-1402.73. The Act’s “effects clause”\n\nbroadens protections in the District beyond those created by federal law: “Any practice which\n\nhas the effect or consequence of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed\n\nto be an unlawful discriminatory practice.” D.C. Code § 2-1402.68. Under that effects clause,\n\n“despite the absence of any intention to discriminate, practices are unlawful if they bear\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fdisproportionately on a protected class and are not independently justified for some\n\nnondiscriminatory reason.” Gay Rights Coal. of Georgetown Univ.

While the Court has found no effects-clause cases that\n\nconsider whether an act with a disparate impact is “independently justified for some\n\nnondiscriminatory reason,” the en banc D.C. Court of Appeals has explained that the clause\n\nimports “the concept of disparate impact discrimination developed by the Supreme Court in\n\nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108284\"><a href=\"/opinion/108284/griggs-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971).” Gay Rights Coal., 536 A.2d at 29 (parallel\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n       Unlike Arlington Heights, which considered disparate impact in the constitutional equal-\n\nprotection context, Griggs concerned Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which forbids employers\n\nfrom maintaining discriminatory employment practices. Specifically, the Griggs Court\n\nconsidered whether an employer could require employees to graduate from high school or pass a\n\nstandardized general intelligence test, when neither requirement was “shown to be significantly\n\nrelated to successful job performance” and both requirements disqualified substantially more\n\nblack applicants than white. 401 U.S. at 425-26. Finding that Title VII “proscribes not only\n\novert discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation,” the\n\nCourt held that “[i]f an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be\n\nshown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.” Id. at 431. To maintain an\n\nemployment requirement with a disparate impact, “Congress has placed on the employer the\n\nburden of showing that any given requirement must have a manifest relationship to the\n\nemployment in question.” Id. at 432.\n\n                                                 26\n\f        According to Plaintiffs here, the effect of the school closings is discrimination on the\n\nbasis of race, disability, and residency. See Compl., ¶¶ 59-60. At the outset, the Court doubts\n\nthat forcibly transferring a student from one public school to another constitutes a denial of a\n\n“facility, service, program, or benefit” for purposes of the DCHRA. Under the Plan, the District\n\nwill continue to provide the student with a public education, and there is no reason to think that\n\nsuch education will be inferior to the one she currently receives. Nor has any court applied the\n\neffects clause to a situation like the one here. Cf. Boykin v. Gray, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (limiting § 2-1402.73 to selective denials of benefits explicitly based on protected\n\ncharacteristic so as not to “subject an unimaginable number of routine policy decisions to\n\nlitigation”).\n\n         If the closure of a school does constitute a sufficient denial of a benefit and the effects\n\nclause does apply with full force, however, the numbers bear out Plaintiffs’ claim of disparate\n\nimpact: While special-education students make up only 14.2% of the school district, they\n\ncomprise 27.7% of the students in the closing schools. See Levy Aff., ¶ 16. Black and Hispanic\n\nstudents make up 82.2% of the overall school district, but 99.6% in the schools to be closed. See\n\nid. And because school assignments depend on the child’s home address, the school closings\n\ndisproportionately affect people who reside in specific areas of the city. The school closings,\n\ntherefore, obviously bear disproportionately on black and Hispanic students, students with\n\ndisabilities, and students who reside east of the Park.\n\n        The game is not over, however. The burden then shifts to the District to show that the\n\nschool closings are “independently justified for some nondiscriminatory reason.” Gay Rights\n\nCoal., 536 A.2d at 29. This showing is evidently analogous to a showing, in the Title VII\n\ncontext, that an employment requirement has “a manifest relationship to the employment in\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fquestion.” Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432. Plaintiffs do not (and could not) question that certain DCPS\n\nschools are significantly under-enrolled, thanks to a decline in the number of children living in\n\nthe city and an increase in the number of charter schools. See Proposed Consolidation Plan at 6-\n\n9. Those falling populations, moreover, are distributed unevenly across the city. For example,\n\nthe student population in Ward 3 – which lies entirely west of the Park – has grown, and its\n\nschools exceed capacity; Ward 8, on the other hand – at the southern tip of the city – has lost\n\nthousands of students, and its middle schools are at about 40% of capacity. See id. at 6-7. The\n\nschools attended by Plaintiffs’ children use 54%, 25%, and 21% of their building space. See id.\n\nat 17, 20-21; see also Smith Aff., ¶ 2 (Ferebee-Hope Elementary School); Turner Aff., ¶ 1\n\n(MacFarland Middle School); Williams Aff., ¶ 1 (Sharpe Health Elementary School).\n\n       By closing under-enrolled schools, DCPS aims to save money and improve education.\n\nAs the District explains, maintaining under-enrolled and small schools means unnecessarily\n\npaying for under-utilized facilities and staff – two half-full schools means two gyms, two heating\n\nbills, and two principals. See Final Consolidation Plan at 1. Small schools, moreover, cannot\n\nprovide many of the benefits that require economies of scale, such as art and music teachers,\n\nphysical education, and full-time librarians. See id. The District has estimated that closing these\n\nschools will save $8.5 million. See id. at 7 (broken down by school). While Plaintiffs question\n\nthe District’s analysis of the benefits, its projections appear realistic and sensible. In any event,\n\nit is not the place of this Court to reassess the wisdom of the District’s policy decisions. Because\n\nthe cost savings and resource allocation here independently justify the school closures, the\n\nDistrict meets its burden under the D.C. Human Rights Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f       E. Sunshine Amendment\n\n       Plaintiffs’ Complaint also tosses in a vague claim that the District “failed and continue[s]\n\nto fail to comply with the provisions of the Sunshine Amendment in the D.C. Self-Government\n\nAct which mandates transparency in local government decision-making, requiring that all such\n\ndecisions be done in open, public meetings. The decisions regarding the school closures were\n\ndone in the dark.” Compl., ¶ 67. Because Plaintiffs provide no facts to support that conclusory\n\nallegation (either in their Complaint or briefs), and because “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements\n\nof a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678, the Court need not consider the alleged violations of the Sunshine Amendment in deciding\n\nthis Motion.\n\n                                           *    *        *   *\n\n       Because Plaintiffs have shown no likelihood of success on the merits of their suit, the\n\nCourt need not review the other three preliminary-injunction factors. See Ark. Dairy Co-op\n\nAss’n, 573 F.3d at 832. If the Court were to reach the other prongs, however, on balance they\n\nhelp the District. Even assuming that every Equal Protection Clause violation constitutes an\n\nirreparable injury, see Mills v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187432\"><a href=\"/opinion/187432/mills-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1312 (D.C.

In this case, three guardians\n\nof school children – proceeding individually rather than as a class – seek to hold up DCPS’s\n\nrestructuring of its school system. Most school closures are supposed to happen in two months.\n\nA preliminary injunction would wreak havoc by forcing everyone to simultaneously prepare for\n\ntwo contingencies. Schools (both closing and receiving) need to know whether they will have\n\n\n\n                                                    29\n\fstudents in the fall and, if so, who and how many. Teachers and staff need to know if and where\n\nthey will have jobs. Families need to know where their children will attend school. The costs of\n\nan injunction also weigh in the District’s favor. DCPS estimates that the school closings will\n\nsave $8.5 million, which works out to a reallocation of almost $200 for every student in the\n\nsystem.\n\n       On Plaintiffs’ side of the scale, by contrast, the harms are hard to spot. DCPS’s data\n\nshow that the Plan will reassign students to schools with significantly higher test scores and\n\nslightly more diversity. See generally Find a School, DCPS, http://profiles.dcps.dc.gov/ (last\n\nvisited May 15, 2013) (profiles for consolidating schools and receiving schools listed in Final\n\nConsolidation Plan at 4-5, 7). Head to head, both reading- and math-proficiency scores rise –\n\noften significantly – for 9 of the 11 closings schools with data available. Racial diversity is\n\nhardly robust in the receiving schools, but at least a handful of them have a nontrivial number of\n\nwhite students (as opposed to the total of two white students in all closing schools combined),\n\nand more have significant Hispanic populations. While test scores remain low and segregation\n\nremains high in absolute terms at even the receiving schools, the school closings at least move\n\nthose numbers in the right direction. Although Plaintiffs undoubtedly value their neighborhood\n\nschools, their injury seems slight given that their children – along with thousands of others – are\n\nmoving to better performing, more integrated schools.\n\n       In sum, Plaintiffs’ inability to show any likelihood of success on the merits alone\n\nprecludes a preliminary injunction here. When coupled with the other factors just mentioned,\n\ndenial of the Motion is the only appropriate course.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fIV.
