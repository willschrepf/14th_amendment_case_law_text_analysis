Central Advisory Council (“CAC”),\nnot a party to this action in the district court, appeals the\ndistrict court’s denial of its motion to amend a 1996\norder entered by the district court as part of its ongoing\nremedial relief in this class action brought against the\nChicago Housing Authority for de jure segregation in\npublic housing. Because CAC is not a “party” for purposes\nof appeal, we dismiss this appeal.\n\n\n                             I\n                     BACKGROUND\nA. History of the Gautreaux Action\n  In 1966, a class of individuals who either were living\nin Chicago public housing or on the wait list for public\nhousing (“Gautreaux plaintiffs”) brought this action\nagainst the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”). They\nalleged that CHA was practicing de jure housing segrega-\ntion. See generally Gautreaux v. Chicago Hous. Auth., 296 F.\nSupp. 907 (N.D. Ill. 1969). In 1969, the district court\ngranted summary judgment to the Gautreaux plaintiffs,\nfinding that CHA had selected housing sites using race\nas a criteria in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nId. at 913-14.\n  In the remedial phase of the proceedings, the district\ncourt entered an order that required the construction of\nthree housing units in an area where the population is\nless than 30% non-white (“General Public Housing Area”)\nfor every unit built in an area where the population is\ngreater than 30% non-white (“Limited Public Housing\nArea”). See Gautreaux v. Chicago Hous. Auth., 304 F. Supp.\n736, 737-38 (N.D. Ill. 1969). In the decades following, this\n\fNo. 05-3968                                               3\n\norder has been modified several times to reflect changes\nin neighborhoods, circumstances and community housing\nneeds.\n  In 1987, the district court appointed Daniel E. Levin as\nthe Receiver (“Receiver”) for the development of all new,\nnon-elderly housing by the CHA. The Receiver was\ngiven broad power to develop and administer the new\nhousing developments.\n\n\nB. The Central Advisory Council\n  CAC is an organization representing tenants currently\nresiding in CHA public housing. Tenants in each public\nhousing development, including the Cabrini Green Homes\nand Robert Taylor Homes, have formed resident councils\nwhose memberships are limited to those persons resid-\ning in that housing development, as provided in the\napplicable United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (“HUD”) regulations. See 24 C.F.R.\n§§ 964.115, 964.125. Each of these councils elects a presi-\ndent. CAC is a jurisdiction-wide council comprised of the\npresidents of each of these tenants’ councils. See 24 C.F.R.\n§ 964.105 (setting forth the composition and role of the\njurisdiction-wide resident council). CAC is comprised of\napproximately twenty-three council presidents; this\nnumber includes three presidents of the resident coun-\ncils of CHA senior public housing developments for\nelderly residents.\n  In 2000, a “Relocation Rights Contract” was negotiated\nbetween CAC and CHA. This agreement guaranteed to\nall CHA leaseholders residing in CHA properties as of\nOctober 1, 1999, the right to return to newly constructed or\n\f4                                              No. 05-3968\n\nrehabilitated housing as old housing was demolished. See\nR.85, Ex.B.\n  On June 27, 2000, the district court entered an order that\nstated that no revitalizing order could be entered or\nmodified that would restrict or limit the opportunity of\ndisplaced CHA residents to return to a CHA property\nwithout CAC first being afforded an opportunity to pre-\nsent evidence and to be heard on the matter. A revitaliz-\ning order is a limited waiver of the 1969 injunction; such\nan order allows the construction of new housing in a\nLimited Public Housing Area when “a responsible fore-\ncast of economic integration, with a longer term possi-\nbility of racial desegregation, could be made” with respect\nto that area. R.64 at 2.\n\n\nC. Background of the Current Action\n  The dispute before us today involves a development\ncalled Lake Park Crescent, which is located in the North\nKenwood-Oakland area on the south side of Chicago. Lake\nPark Crescent was built by a private developer and over-\nseen by the Receiver. The North Kenwood-Oakland\nneighborhood formerly had contained high-density,\ndilapidated public housing; CHA demolished the high-rise\nbuildings in the neighborhood and sought adequate\nhousing alternatives.\n  On June 3, 1996, the district court issued a “revitalizing\norder” for the North Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood.\nThis order stated that, in order to prevent a re-concentra-\ntion of public housing, any new public housing in the\nNorth Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood must be economi-\ncally integrated; one-half of the units must be reserved\nfor low-income families earning 50-80% of the area\n\fNo. 05-3968                                              5\n\nmedian income (“AMI”), while the other half could be\noccupied by very low-income families earning 0-50% of\nthe AMI. See id. at 3.\n  The first phase of Lake Park Crescent was completed\nand had sixty public housing units: thirty reserved for\nfamilies earning 50-80% of AMI, and thirty reserved for\nfamilies earning 0-50% of AMI. The developer had no\ndifficulty finding families to occupy the 0-50% units;\nhowever, it did encounter difficulty identifying eligible\nexisting public housing tenants to occupy the 50-80% units.\nConsequently, some of those units remained vacant. The\ndeveloper contacted all families on CHA’s waiting list\nwho satisfied the existing income limits; in August 2004,\nan open house was held for CHA families at or above\n50% AMI; in February 2005, CHA began an outreach ef-\nfort to wait list families in the surrounding communities;\nand, in March 2005, CHA began to contact the entire\nwait list. As of May 20, 2005, nine of the thirty units\n(requiring 50-80% AMI) were occupied, and eleven other\nunits were assigned to individuals whose applications\nwere being processed. R.110 at 10-11. Nevertheless, there\nwas still concern about filling the remaining 50-80% AMI\nunits.\n\n\nD. District Court Proceedings\n  On May 3, 2005, CAC filed a motion to amend the 1996\nrevitalizing order to allow working public housing\nfamilies to occupy the units reserved for those who\nmake 50-80% of the AMI, even if their income was not as\nhigh as 50% of the AMI. R.85 at 2. In that motion, CAC\nexpressed a concern that the developer was planning a site-\nbased wait list for Lake Park Crescent that would invite\n\f6                                              No. 05-3968\n\nmembers of the general community to live in Lake Park\nCrescent. Id. CAC contended that such a list would\nbypass the thousands of current and past CHA residents\nwho are currently on wait lists awaiting housing reloca-\ntion. Id.\n  The Receiver opposed CAC’s motion and offered three\nother options to the district court. The first option was to\ncontinue efforts to locate qualified tenants (earning 50-80%\nAMI) from the CHA wait list; the second option was to\nlocate qualified tenants (earning 50-80% AMI) from the\npool of existing CHA tenants who already had made\npermanent housing relocation choices; the third option\nwas to create a site-based waiting list drawing from\nmembers of the broader (non-CHA) community to fill any\nunits that would remain vacant due to insufficient numbers\nof CHA wait listed families meeting the income criteria.\n  The Gautreaux plaintiffs filed a brief stating that there\nwas merit to the contentions of both CAC and the Receiver.\nCHA also filed a brief, stating that it “supports and is\nwilling to implement” either the site-based wait list\nstrategy proposed by the developer or CAC’s proposal\nto relax the income requirements and that “one or the\nother plan should be adopted promptly.” R.109 at 5.\n  On July 7, 2005, the district court held a hearing. A\nnumber of parties and interested persons testified, in-\ncluding representatives of CAC, CHA, HUD, the\nGautreaux plaintiffs and the Receiver and North Kenwood-\nOakland community representatives. CAC was con-\ncerned that a site-based wait list that drew in residents\nfrom outside CHA housing would take away units owed\nto CHA leaseholders under the 2000 Relocation Rights\nContract ever since the CHA began demolishment of their\nhigh-rise homes. R.187 at 8.\n\fNo. 05-3968                                              7\n\n  The Receiver contended that CAC’s motion would\nthreaten his ongoing efforts to generate public support\nfor replacement public housing because he would be\nbreaking a promise he had made to the North Kenwood\nneighborhood. He had said that the new housing would\nbe mixed-income housing. Id. at 16-19. The Receiver\nsubmitted that, if the court allowed his promises to the\nneighborhood to be breached, it would diminish his\ncredibility and hamper his efforts to get neighborhood\nsupport for public housing for future developments.\nAlderman Toni Preckwinkle, who represents the North\nKenwood-Oakland neighborhood, and Shirley Newsome,\nchair of the North Kenwood-Oakland Conservation\nCommunity Council, also testified and expressed their\ndisapproval of CAC’s plan. Both asserted that the com-\nmunity had been promised by the Receiver that any\nnew housing would be mixed income so as not to repeat\nthe concentrations of poverty caused by the previous, high-\nrise public housing.\n  The Gautreaux plaintiffs admitted that the decision\nwas a “tough one.” They did not want to take a position\ncontrary to the community’s wishes; nevertheless, they\nwere concerned that, although many of the Gautreaux\nplaintiffs still were waiting for housing, the units in\nquestion might be given to families who were not class\nmembers and who were not on a CHA wait list. Id. at 12-16.\nDespite this reservation, CHA again informed the district\ncourt that it would implement either the CAC or the\nsite wait list plan. It also informed the court that, as of\nthe morning of July 7, fifteen of the thirty units reserved\nfor 50-80% AMI were still unfilled. Id. at 9.\n  A HUD representative, Janet Elson, testified that she\nappreciated the positions of both CAC and the Receiver,\n\f8                                                No. 05-3968\n\nbut that “the notion of a campaign to bring in people\nwho are not on the current CHA waiting list is prob-\nlematic to HUD.” Id. at 36. Elson testified that there may\nbe a compromise position of lowering the AMI to 40%,\nrather than eliminating it, because the 40% AMI families\nare still “working,” “quality” families. Id. at 37.\n  The district court denied CAC’s motion to amend the\nJune 3, 1996 order. The court briefly summarized the\npositions of the interested parties, and stated that it “[did]\nnot see an extraordinary change in circumstances at this\ntime which suggests we must modify our June 3, 1996\norder by removing the 50-80% [AMI] provision.” R.136\nat 2.\n  On July 14, 2005, the district court also issued an order\nmodifying various earlier orders to “permit the creation\nof an on-site waiting list at the Lake Park Crescent [devel-\nopment] . . . for households earning between 50% to 60%\nof the area median income.” R.135-3 at 1. The waiting list\nwas to be comprised of tenants solicited from the general\npublic, households who are currently on CHA wait lists\nfor public housing and households currently in public\nhousing. Id. at 1-2. The court further ordered that priority\nshould be given to any person on the wait list who previ-\nously was listed on a CHA general wait list or who is\ncurrently living in CHA housing. Id. at 2. The court\nalso ordered that CHA continue to mail notice of the\navailability of the units to each individual on the CHA\nwait lists. Id.\n  CAC then filed a motion requesting the district court\nto clarify whether its July 14, 2005 order applied only to\nthe already-completed Phase I of Lake Park Crescent or\nwhether it applied to all public housing that will be built\nunder the North Kenwood 1996 revitalization order. See\n\fNo. 05-3968                                               9\n\nR.137 at 4. The motion also requested clarification as to\nwhether the July 14, 2005 order waived certain HUD\nregulations that CAC argued were violated by CHA’s\nincome requirements and by opening the wait list to the\ngeneral public. Id. at 3. The court denied CAC’s motion\non September 9, 2005 without any stated reason. See R.168.\n  CAC then filed this appeal, arguing that the district\ncourt abused its discretion when it denied CAC’s motion\nto modify the 1996 revitalization order.\n\n\n                            II\n                      DISCUSSION\n  Before we begin our analysis of the parties’ claims, it is\nimportant to note the unique context in which this case\nreaches us. CAC is the appellant in this case. Although\nthere is substantial overlap between the individuals\nrepresented by the CAC and by the Gautreaux class\nrepresentatives, the membership of the two groups is not\nthe same. CAC represents all tenants currently in CHA\npublic housing, which includes the elderly tenants who\nlive in CHA senior housing developments. The Gautreaux\nplaintiffs include those who currently live in CHA public\nhousing developments, but not including residents of\nCHA senior housing. The Gautreaux plaintiffs also repre-\nsent individuals currently on the CHA wait list, which is\na group of individuals that is not represented by CAC.\n  Both the Receiver and CHA filed briefs as appellees\nin this case. The Gautreaux plaintiffs did not file a brief\nor participate in the appeal.\n  The Receiver and CHA submit that CAC has no “stand-\ning” to appeal the district court’s denial of its motion to\n\f10                                                   No. 05-3968\n\nmodify the 1996 Revitalization order.1 CAC does not\ncontend that it was a party to the underlying litigation;\nrather, it insists, both in its appellate briefing and at oral\nargument, that it is a nonparty to the litigation. It did not\nformally intervene in the district court proceedings; the\ndistrict court considered CAC’s motion without any sort\nof formal intervention.2\n  It is well-established that, as a general rule, a nonparty\ncannot challenge on appeal the rulings of a district court.\nSee, e.g., Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301, 304 (1988) (per\ncuriam); B.H. ex rel. Pierce v. Murphy, 984 F.2d 196, 199 (7th\n\n\n1\n  As discussed below, the right of a nonparty to appeal the\ndecision of the district court “does not implicate the jurisdiction\nof the courts under Article III of the Constitution,” thus it is\nnot an issue of “standing.” Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 6\n(2001). The Supreme Court has noted that federal courts “have\nbeen less than meticulous” in their use of the term “jurisdiction.”\nKontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 454 (2004). The Court noted that\n“[c]larity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the\nlabel ‘jurisdiction’ . . . only for prescriptions delineating the\nclasses of cases (subject matter jurisdiction) and the persons\n(personal jurisdiction) falling within a court’s adjudicatory\nauthority.” Id. at 455. In the same vein, we shall refrain in this\nopinion from using the jurisdictional term of art, “standing,” to\ndescribe the right of a nonparty to seek appellate review of a\ndistrict court’s decision.\n2\n   We recognize that the district court did issue an order in 2000\nallowing CAC the right to “be heard” and “present evidence”\nbefore any revitalizing order was entered or modified. Order\nof June 27, 2000. However, this order did not formally allow\nCAC to intervene, nor did it establish CAC as a “party” to the\nlitigation. Therefore, any right CAC has to appeal does not\nstem from this order.\n\fNo. 05-3968                                                  11\n\nCir. 1993). CAC relies on a recognized exception to this\nrule that allows unnamed class members to participate in\nan appeal of a class action settlement without formal\nintervention. See Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 14 (2002);\nIn re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Prod. Liab. Litig., 333\nF.3d 763, 768 (7th Cir. 2003). In Devlin, the Supreme Court\nannounced that “nonnamed class members . . . who have\nobjected in a timely manner to approval of the settle-\nment at the fairness hearing have the power to bring\nan appeal without first intervening.” 536 U.S. at 14. A\nnonnamed member of a class action lawsuit, Devlin,\nobjected to a proposed settlement; the district court ap-\nproved the settlement over the objections it heard, includ-\ning those advanced by Devlin. Id. at 5. Devlin then ap-\npealed, challenging the fairness of the settlement. Id. at 6.\nThe Supreme Court considered whether Devlin, as a\nnonnamed class member, could appeal the settlement. The\nCourt first stated that the question was not one of Article\nIII standing because Devlin had an interest in the settle-\nment sufficient to meet the “case or controversy” test. Id. at\n6-7. It further stated that appeals by nonnamed class\nmembers do not raise prudential standing concerns. See id.\nInstead, the Court classified the question as “whether\n[Devlin] should be considered a ‘party’ for purposes of\nappealing the approval of the settlement.” Id. at 7; see also\nFed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(A) (stating that, on appeal, the\nnotice of appeal must “specify the party or parties taking\nthe appeal”).\n  The Supreme Court held that the nonnamed class\nmember was a “party” for purposes of appeal, allowing\nhim to appeal the “aspect of the District Court’s order\nthat affects him.” Devlin, 536 U.S. at 9. The Court stated\nthat such an appeal “cannot be effectively accomplished\n\f12                                                 No. 05-3968\n\nthrough the named class representative,” because, once\nthe class representative had approved the settlement,\nits interests had diverged from those class members\nwho had objected to the settlement. Id. The Court noted\nthat “[w]hat is most important to this case is that\nnonnamed class members are parties to the proceedings\nin the sense of being bound by the settlement.” Id. at 10.\n  We must determine whether CAC is a “party” for\npurposes of appeal. We do not believe that the Supreme\nCourt’s holding in Devlin supports our permitting CAC\nto appeal in this case. The present action is different from\nDevlin in several important ways. First, CAC cannot be\ncharactered as an “unnamed” class member. Assuming\nthat CAC may represent the interests of a number of\nunnamed class members, it also represents individuals\nwho are not class members and who are not affected by\nthe remedial orders—the elderly tenants in senior citizen\nCHA housing. Additionally, unlike the situation in Devlin,\nthere is no indication here that the Gautreaux plaintiffs,\nwho represent the class, have interests antagonistic to\nthose of CAC and, therefore, are impaired from represent-\ning effectively CAC’s membership. Cf. Devlin, 536 U.S. at 9.\nThe Gautreaux plaintiffs have every incentive to ensure\nthat those currently in CHA housing, as well as those on\nCHA wait lists, are given priority in filling any public\nhousing vacancies.3\n  Moreover, in Devlin, the Supreme Court stated that\n“[w]hat is most important to this case is that nonnamed\nclass members are parties to the proceedings in the sense of\n\n\n\n3\n  The Gautreaux plaintiffs actually testified before the district\ncourt in support of CAC’s position. See R.187 at 12-16.\n\fNo. 05-3968                                                   13\n\nbeing bound by the settlement.” 536 U.S. at 10. Devlin\ntherefore reflects a concern that, without an opportunity\nto appeal, unnamed class members will have no other\nrecourse than to accept the terms of a settlement and to\nforfeit further pursuit of their claim. Indeed, some cir-\ncuits have noted a hesitation to extend Devlin beyond\nthe procedural context of a class action settlement agree-\nment to which class members do not have the opportunity\nto opt out. See P.A.C.E. v. Sch. Dist. of Kansas City, 312\nF.3d 341, 342-43 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that Devlin was\ninapplicable to a situation where class members wanted\nto “challenge individual litigation decisions by class\ncounsel during the pendency of the suit”); In re Gen. Am.\nLife Ins. Co. Sales Practices Litig., 302 F.3d 799, 800 (8th Cir.\n2002) (noting, in dicta, that there is “considerable merit” to\nthe contention that Devlin does not apply to class actions\ncertified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3),\nfrom which class members may opt out). The Eleventh\nCircuit has stressed that Devlin “allow[s] appeals by\nparties who are actually bound by a judgment, not parties\nwho merely could have been bound by a judgment.” AAL\nHigh Yield Bond Fund v. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 361 F.3d\n1305, 1310 (11th Cir. 2004) (emphasis in original). Because\nCAC is not “bound” by a final judgment, it does not\nqualify as a party to the litigation for purposes of appeal.\n  The task of a district court faced with the task of ad-\nministering a decree for equitable relief in an institutional\ncase such as this one is a difficult one. The federal con-\nstitutional or statutory violation must be eliminated, but,\nat the same time, the district court must be careful to\nlimit its intrusion into local matters to those circum-\nstances in which federal law is offended.

Rev.\n1281, 1298 (1976); see also id. at 1301-02 (noting that, in “an\nongoing remedial regime,” the district court is involved\nin “actively shaping and monitoring the decree, mediat-\ning between the parties, [and] developing [its] own\nsources of expertise and information,” with the district\ncourt becoming a “policy planner and manager”). In this\ncase, the district court has been monitoring the parties’\nactions for nearly forty years. In order to monitor effec-\ntively the CHA’s selection of housing development sites,\nthe district court had to be able to modify its earlier orders\nas circumstances, especially city demographics, change.\nThis task required that the court gather and assess infor-\nmation and tailor its orders to maintain the delicate\nbalance between legitimate federal judicial authority and\nthe right of local authorities to fulfill their vital responsi-\nbilities.4 In accomplishing this task, it is important that the\ndistrict court carefully examine and weigh the impact on\nthe legitimate interests on all affected groups.

Unfortu-\nnately, permitting CAC to participate in the proceedings\nby way of a formal motion led to misapprehension on the\npart of that nonparty that it could appeal the district\ncourt’s decision. CAC suggested one solution to the dis-\ntrict court, which the court considered and rejected\nafter soliciting testimony from others interested in the\ndevelopment of public housing in the North Kenwood-\nOakland Neighborhood. However, listening to an organiza-\ntion’s views in the search for a practical, workable solu-\ntion does not vest that organization with the right to\nappeal the district court’s ultimate decision on the course\nthat the parties must take.\n\n\n                       Conclusion\n  For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\n                                            APPEAL DISMISSED\n\nA true Copy:\n       Teste:\n\n                         _____________________________\n                         Clerk of the United States Court of\n                           Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n                   USCA-02-C-0072—1-19-07\n\f",

History of the Gautreaux Action\n  In 1966, a class of individuals who either were living\nin Chicago public housing or on the wait list for public\nhousing (“Gautreaux plaintiffs”) brought this action\nagainst the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”). They\nalleged that CHA was practicing de jure housing segrega-\ntion. See generally Gautreaux v. Chicago Hous. Auth., 296 F.\nSupp. 907 (N.D. Ill. 1969). In 1969, the district court\ngranted summary judgment to the Gautreaux plaintiffs,\nfinding that CHA had selected housing sites using race\nas a criteria in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nId. at 913-14.\n  In the remedial phase of the proceedings, the district\ncourt entered an order that required the construction of\nthree housing units in an area where the population is\nless than 30% non-white (“General Public Housing Area”)\nfor every unit built in an area where the population is\ngreater than 30% non-white (“Limited Public Housing\nArea”). See Gautreaux v. Chicago Hous. Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1868030\"><a href=\"/opinion/1868030/gautreaux-v-chicago-housing-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737-38 (N.D. Ill. 1969). In the decades following, this\n\fNo. 05-3968                                               3\n\norder has been modified several times to reflect changes\nin neighborhoods, circumstances and community housing\nneeds.\n  In 1987, the district court appointed Daniel E. Levin as\nthe Receiver (“Receiver”) for the development of all new,\nnon-elderly housing by the CHA. The Receiver was\ngiven broad power to develop and administer the new\nhousing developments.\n\n\nB. The Central Advisory Council\n  CAC is an organization representing tenants currently\nresiding in CHA public housing. Tenants in each public\nhousing development, including the Cabrini Green Homes\nand Robert Taylor Homes, have formed resident councils\nwhose memberships are limited to those persons resid-\ning in that housing development, as provided in the\napplicable United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (“HUD”) regulations. See 24 C.F.R.\n§§ 964.115, 964.125. Each of these councils elects a presi-\ndent. CAC is a jurisdiction-wide council comprised of the\npresidents of each of these tenants’ councils. See 24 C.F.R.\n§ 964.105 (setting forth the composition and role of the\njurisdiction-wide resident council). CAC is comprised of\napproximately twenty-three council presidents; this\nnumber includes three presidents of the resident coun-\ncils of CHA senior public housing developments for\nelderly residents.\n  In 2000, a “Relocation Rights Contract” was negotiated\nbetween CAC and CHA. This agreement guaranteed to\nall CHA leaseholders residing in CHA properties as of\nOctober 1, 1999, the right to return to newly constructed or\n\f4                                              No. 05-3968\n\nrehabilitated housing as old housing was demolished. See\nR.85, Ex.B.\n  On June 27, 2000, the district court entered an order that\nstated that no revitalizing order could be entered or\nmodified that would restrict or limit the opportunity of\ndisplaced CHA residents to return to a CHA property\nwithout CAC first being afforded an opportunity to pre-\nsent evidence and to be heard on the matter. A revitaliz-\ning order is a limited waiver of the 1969 injunction; such\nan order allows the construction of new housing in a\nLimited Public Housing Area when “a responsible fore-\ncast of economic integration, with a longer term possi-\nbility of racial desegregation, could be made” with respect\nto that area. R.64 at 2.\n\n\nC. Background of the Current Action\n  The dispute before us today involves a development\ncalled Lake Park Crescent, which is located in the North\nKenwood-Oakland area on the south side of Chicago. Lake\nPark Crescent was built by a private developer and over-\nseen by the Receiver. The North Kenwood-Oakland\nneighborhood formerly had contained high-density,\ndilapidated public housing; CHA demolished the high-rise\nbuildings in the neighborhood and sought adequate\nhousing alternatives.\n  On June 3, 1996, the district court issued a “revitalizing\norder” for the North Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood.\nThis order stated that, in order to prevent a re-concentra-\ntion of public housing, any new public housing in the\nNorth Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood must be economi-\ncally integrated; one-half of the units must be reserved\nfor low-income families earning 50-80% of the area\n\fNo. 05-3968                                              5\n\nmedian income (“AMI”), while the other half could be\noccupied by very low-income families earning 0-50% of\nthe AMI. See id. at 3.\n  The first phase of Lake Park Crescent was completed\nand had sixty public housing units: thirty reserved for\nfamilies earning 50-80% of AMI, and thirty reserved for\nfamilies earning 0-50% of AMI. The developer had no\ndifficulty finding families to occupy the 0-50% units;\nhowever, it did encounter difficulty identifying eligible\nexisting public housing tenants to occupy the 50-80% units.\nConsequently, some of those units remained vacant. The\ndeveloper contacted all families on CHA’s waiting list\nwho satisfied the existing income limits; in August 2004,\nan open house was held for CHA families at or above\n50% AMI; in February 2005, CHA began an outreach ef-\nfort to wait list families in the surrounding communities;\nand, in March 2005, CHA began to contact the entire\nwait list. As of May 20, 2005, nine of the thirty units\n(requiring 50-80% AMI) were occupied, and eleven other\nunits were assigned to individuals whose applications\nwere being processed. R.110 at 10-11. Nevertheless, there\nwas still concern about filling the remaining 50-80% AMI\nunits.\n\n\nD. District Court Proceedings\n  On May 3, 2005, CAC filed a motion to amend the 1996\nrevitalizing order to allow working public housing\nfamilies to occupy the units reserved for those who\nmake 50-80% of the AMI, even if their income was not as\nhigh as 50% of the AMI. R.85 at 2. In that motion, CAC\nexpressed a concern that the developer was planning a site-\nbased wait list for Lake Park Crescent that would invite\n\f6                                              No. 05-3968\n\nmembers of the general community to live in Lake Park\nCrescent. Id. CAC contended that such a list would\nbypass the thousands of current and past CHA residents\nwho are currently on wait lists awaiting housing reloca-\ntion. Id.\n  The Receiver opposed CAC’s motion and offered three\nother options to the district court. The first option was to\ncontinue efforts to locate qualified tenants (earning 50-80%\nAMI) from the CHA wait list; the second option was to\nlocate qualified tenants (earning 50-80% AMI) from the\npool of existing CHA tenants who already had made\npermanent housing relocation choices; the third option\nwas to create a site-based waiting list drawing from\nmembers of the broader (non-CHA) community to fill any\nunits that would remain vacant due to insufficient numbers\nof CHA wait listed families meeting the income criteria.\n  The Gautreaux plaintiffs filed a brief stating that there\nwas merit to the contentions of both CAC and the Receiver.\nCHA also filed a brief, stating that it “supports and is\nwilling to implement” either the site-based wait list\nstrategy proposed by the developer or CAC’s proposal\nto relax the income requirements and that “one or the\nother plan should be adopted promptly.” R.109 at 5.\n  On July 7, 2005, the district court held a hearing. A\nnumber of parties and interested persons testified, in-\ncluding representatives of CAC, CHA, HUD, the\nGautreaux plaintiffs and the Receiver and North Kenwood-\nOakland community representatives. CAC was con-\ncerned that a site-based wait list that drew in residents\nfrom outside CHA housing would take away units owed\nto CHA leaseholders under the 2000 Relocation Rights\nContract ever since the CHA began demolishment of their\nhigh-rise homes. R.187 at 8.\n\fNo. 05-3968                                              7\n\n  The Receiver contended that CAC’s motion would\nthreaten his ongoing efforts to generate public support\nfor replacement public housing because he would be\nbreaking a promise he had made to the North Kenwood\nneighborhood. He had said that the new housing would\nbe mixed-income housing. Id. at 16-19. The Receiver\nsubmitted that, if the court allowed his promises to the\nneighborhood to be breached, it would diminish his\ncredibility and hamper his efforts to get neighborhood\nsupport for public housing for future developments.\nAlderman Toni Preckwinkle, who represents the North\nKenwood-Oakland neighborhood, and Shirley Newsome,\nchair of the North Kenwood-Oakland Conservation\nCommunity Council, also testified and expressed their\ndisapproval of CAC’s plan. Both asserted that the com-\nmunity had been promised by the Receiver that any\nnew housing would be mixed income so as not to repeat\nthe concentrations of poverty caused by the previous, high-\nrise public housing.\n  The Gautreaux plaintiffs admitted that the decision\nwas a “tough one.” They did not want to take a position\ncontrary to the community’s wishes; nevertheless, they\nwere concerned that, although many of the Gautreaux\nplaintiffs still were waiting for housing, the units in\nquestion might be given to families who were not class\nmembers and who were not on a CHA wait list. Id. at 12-16.\nDespite this reservation, CHA again informed the district\ncourt that it would implement either the CAC or the\nsite wait list plan. It also informed the court that, as of\nthe morning of July 7, fifteen of the thirty units reserved\nfor 50-80% AMI were still unfilled. Id. at 9.\n  A HUD representative, Janet Elson, testified that she\nappreciated the positions of both CAC and the Receiver,\n\f8                                                No. 05-3968\n\nbut that “the notion of a campaign to bring in people\nwho are not on the current CHA waiting list is prob-\nlematic to HUD.” Id. at 36. Elson testified that there may\nbe a compromise position of lowering the AMI to 40%,\nrather than eliminating it, because the 40% AMI families\nare still “working,” “quality” families. Id. at 37.\n  The district court denied CAC’s motion to amend the\nJune 3, 1996 order. The court briefly summarized the\npositions of the interested parties, and stated that it “[did]\nnot see an extraordinary change in circumstances at this\ntime which suggests we must modify our June 3, 1996\norder by removing the 50-80% [AMI] provision.” R.136\nat 2.\n  On July 14, 2005, the district court also issued an order\nmodifying various earlier orders to “permit the creation\nof an on-site waiting list at the Lake Park Crescent [devel-\nopment] . . . for households earning between 50% to 60%\nof the area median income.” R.135-3 at 1. The waiting list\nwas to be comprised of tenants solicited from the general\npublic, households who are currently on CHA wait lists\nfor public housing and households currently in public\nhousing. Id. at 1-2. The court further ordered that priority\nshould be given to any person on the wait list who previ-\nously was listed on a CHA general wait list or who is\ncurrently living in CHA housing. Id. at 2. The court\nalso ordered that CHA continue to mail notice of the\navailability of the units to each individual on the CHA\nwait lists. Id.\n  CAC then filed a motion requesting the district court\nto clarify whether its July 14, 2005 order applied only to\nthe already-completed Phase I of Lake Park Crescent or\nwhether it applied to all public housing that will be built\nunder the North Kenwood 1996 revitalization order. See\n\fNo. 05-3968                                               9\n\nR.137 at 4. The motion also requested clarification as to\nwhether the July 14, 2005 order waived certain HUD\nregulations that CAC argued were violated by CHA’s\nincome requirements and by opening the wait list to the\ngeneral public. Id. at 3. The court denied CAC’s motion\non September 9, 2005 without any stated reason. See R.168.\n  CAC then filed this appeal, arguing that the district\ncourt abused its discretion when it denied CAC’s motion\nto modify the 1996 revitalization order.\n\n\n                            II\n                      DISCUSSION\n  Before we begin our analysis of the parties’ claims, it is\nimportant to note the unique context in which this case\nreaches us. CAC is the appellant in this case. Although\nthere is substantial overlap between the individuals\nrepresented by the CAC and by the Gautreaux class\nrepresentatives, the membership of the two groups is not\nthe same. CAC represents all tenants currently in CHA\npublic housing, which includes the elderly tenants who\nlive in CHA senior housing developments. The Gautreaux\nplaintiffs include those who currently live in CHA public\nhousing developments, but not including residents of\nCHA senior housing. The Gautreaux plaintiffs also repre-\nsent individuals currently on the CHA wait list, which is\na group of individuals that is not represented by CAC.\n  Both the Receiver and CHA filed briefs as appellees\nin this case. The Gautreaux plaintiffs did not file a brief\nor participate in the appeal.\n  The Receiver and CHA submit that CAC has no “stand-\ning” to appeal the district court’s denial of its motion to\n\f10                                                   No. 05-3968\n\nmodify the 1996 Revitalization order.1 CAC does not\ncontend that it was a party to the underlying litigation;\nrather, it insists, both in its appellate briefing and at oral\nargument, that it is a nonparty to the litigation. It did not\nformally intervene in the district court proceedings; the\ndistrict court considered CAC’s motion without any sort\nof formal intervention.2\n  It is well-established that, as a general rule, a nonparty\ncannot challenge on appeal the rulings of a district court.\nSee, e.g., Marino v. Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111981\"><a href=\"/opinion/111981/marino-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304 (1988) (per\ncuriam); B.H. ex rel.

The Supreme Court has noted that federal courts “have\nbeen less than meticulous” in their use of the term “jurisdiction.”\nKontrick v.

The Court noted that\n“[c]larity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the\nlabel ‘jurisdiction’ . . . only for prescriptions delineating the\nclasses of cases (subject matter jurisdiction) and the persons\n(personal jurisdiction) falling within a court’s adjudicatory\nauthority.” Id. at 455. In the same vein, we shall refrain in this\nopinion from using the jurisdictional term of art, “standing,” to\ndescribe the right of a nonparty to seek appellate review of a\ndistrict court’s decision.\n2\n   We recognize that the district court did issue an order in 2000\nallowing CAC the right to “be heard” and “present evidence”\nbefore any revitalizing order was entered or modified. Order\nof June 27, 2000. However, this order did not formally allow\nCAC to intervene, nor did it establish CAC as a “party” to the\nlitigation. Therefore, any right CAC has to appeal does not\nstem from this order.\n\fNo. 05-3968                                                  11\n\nCir. 1993). CAC relies on a recognized exception to this\nrule that allows unnamed class members to participate in\nan appeal of a class action settlement without formal\nintervention. See Devlin v. Scardelletti, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (2002);\nIn re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Prod.

In Devlin, the Supreme Court\nannounced that “nonnamed class members . . . who have\nobjected in a timely manner to approval of the settle-\nment at the fairness hearing have the power to bring\nan appeal without first intervening.” 536 U.S. at 14. A\nnonnamed member of a class action lawsuit, Devlin,\nobjected to a proposed settlement; the district court ap-\nproved the settlement over the objections it heard, includ-\ning those advanced by Devlin. Id. at 5. Devlin then ap-\npealed, challenging the fairness of the settlement. Id. at 6.\nThe Supreme Court considered whether Devlin, as a\nnonnamed class member, could appeal the settlement. The\nCourt first stated that the question was not one of Article\nIII standing because Devlin had an interest in the settle-\nment sufficient to meet the “case or controversy” test. Id. at\n6-7. It further stated that appeals by nonnamed class\nmembers do not raise prudential standing concerns. See id.\nInstead, the Court classified the question as “whether\n[Devlin] should be considered a ‘party’ for purposes of\nappealing the approval of the settlement.” Id. at 7; see also\nFed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(A) (stating that, on appeal, the\nnotice of appeal must “specify the party or parties taking\nthe appeal”).\n  The Supreme Court held that the nonnamed class\nmember was a “party” for purposes of appeal, allowing\nhim to appeal the “aspect of the District Court’s order\nthat affects him.” Devlin, 536 U.S. at 9. The Court stated\nthat such an appeal “cannot be effectively accomplished\n\f12                                                 No. 05-3968\n\nthrough the named class representative,” because, once\nthe class representative had approved the settlement,\nits interests had diverged from those class members\nwho had objected to the settlement. Id. The Court noted\nthat “[w]hat is most important to this case is that\nnonnamed class members are parties to the proceedings\nin the sense of being bound by the settlement.” Id. at 10.\n  We must determine whether CAC is a “party” for\npurposes of appeal. We do not believe that the Supreme\nCourt’s holding in Devlin supports our permitting CAC\nto appeal in this case. The present action is different from\nDevlin in several important ways. First, CAC cannot be\ncharactered as an “unnamed” class member. Assuming\nthat CAC may represent the interests of a number of\nunnamed class members, it also represents individuals\nwho are not class members and who are not affected by\nthe remedial orders—the elderly tenants in senior citizen\nCHA housing. Additionally, unlike the situation in Devlin,\nthere is no indication here that the Gautreaux plaintiffs,\nwho represent the class, have interests antagonistic to\nthose of CAC and, therefore, are impaired from represent-\ning effectively CAC’s membership. Cf. Devlin, 536 U.S. at 9.\nThe Gautreaux plaintiffs have every incentive to ensure\nthat those currently in CHA housing, as well as those on\nCHA wait lists, are given priority in filling any public\nhousing vacancies.3\n  Moreover, in Devlin, the Supreme Court stated that\n“[w]hat is most important to this case is that nonnamed\nclass members are parties to the proceedings in the sense of\n\n\n\n3\n  The Gautreaux plaintiffs actually testified before the district\ncourt in support of CAC’s position. See R.187 at 12-16.\n\fNo. 05-3968                                                   13\n\nbeing bound by the settlement.” 536 U.S. at 10. Devlin\ntherefore reflects a concern that, without an opportunity\nto appeal, unnamed class members will have no other\nrecourse than to accept the terms of a settlement and to\nforfeit further pursuit of their claim. Indeed, some cir-\ncuits have noted a hesitation to extend Devlin beyond\nthe procedural context of a class action settlement agree-\nment to which class members do not have the opportunity\nto opt out.

The Eleventh\nCircuit has stressed that Devlin “allow[s] appeals by\nparties who are actually bound by a judgment, not parties\nwho merely could have been bound by a judgment.” AAL\nHigh Yield Bond Fund v. Deloitte & Touche LLP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76534\"><a href=\"/opinion/76534/aal-high-yield-bond-v-ruttenberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1310 (11th Cir. 2004) (emphasis in original). Because\nCAC is not “bound” by a final judgment, it does not\nqualify as a party to the litigation for purposes of appeal.\n  The task of a district court faced with the task of ad-\nministering a decree for equitable relief in an institutional\ncase such as this one is a difficult one. The federal con-\nstitutional or statutory violation must be eliminated, but,\nat the same time, the district court must be careful to\nlimit its intrusion into local matters to those circum-\nstances in which federal law is offended. Indeed, this\ntype of institutional remedial litigation “differs in almost\n\f14                                                       No. 05-3968\n\nevery relevant characteristic from relief in [a] traditional\nmodel of adjudication” because orders like the 1969 order\n“prolong[] and deepen[], rather than terminate[], the\ncourt’s involvement with the dispute.” Abram Chayes, The\nRole of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev.\n1281, 1298 (1976); see also id. at 1301-02 (noting that, in “an\nongoing remedial regime,” the district court is involved\nin “actively shaping and monitoring the decree, mediat-\ning between the parties, [and] developing [its] own\nsources of expertise and information,” with the district\ncourt becoming a “policy planner and manager”). In this\ncase, the district court has been monitoring the parties’\nactions for nearly forty years. In order to monitor effec-\ntively the CHA’s selection of housing development sites,\nthe district court had to be able to modify its earlier orders\nas circumstances, especially city demographics, change.\nThis task required that the court gather and assess infor-\nmation and tailor its orders to maintain the delicate\nbalance between legitimate federal judicial authority and\nthe right of local authorities to fulfill their vital responsi-\nbilities.4 In accomplishing this task, it is important that the\ndistrict court carefully examine and weigh the impact on\nthe legitimate interests on all affected groups.

Daley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676545\"><a href=\"/opinion/676545/richard-barnett-v-richard-m-daley-and-carole-bialczak/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1203 (7th Cir. 1994). Therefore, it\nis quite understandable that the district court considered\n\n\n4\n   See, e.g., New York State Ass’n for Retarded Children, Inc. v.

Unfortu-\nnately, permitting CAC to participate in the proceedings\nby way of a formal motion led to misapprehension on the\npart of that nonparty that it could appeal the district\ncourt’s decision. CAC suggested one solution to the dis-\ntrict court, which the court considered and rejected\nafter soliciting testimony from others interested in the\ndevelopment of public housing in the North Kenwood-\nOakland Neighborhood. However, listening to an organiza-\ntion’s views in the search for a practical, workable solu-\ntion does not vest that organization with the right to\nappeal the district court’s ultimate decision on the course\nthat the parties must take.\n\n\n                       Conclusion\n  For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\n                                            APPEAL DISMISSED\n\nA true Copy:\n       Teste:\n\n                         _____________________________\n                         Clerk of the United States Court of\n                           Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n                   USCA-02-C-0072—1-19-07\n\f</pre>",
