The court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\fBefore KELLY and BALDOCK , Circuit Judges, and          BRORBY , Senior Circuit\nJudge.\n\n\n\n      After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\n\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of\n\nthis appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is\n\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n\n\n      Brian Gargan, a state prisoner appearing pro se, brought suit under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 against twenty-seven named prison officials and eight John Does\n\nfor violating his Eighth Amendment rights. The district court granted the\n\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. We exercise\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and affirm.\n\n\n\n      Mr. Gargan allegedly suffers from “chronic heart disease.” He argues the\n\ndefendants, knowing of his heart condition, violated his Eighth Amendment rights\n\nby their excessive use of force and deliberate indifference to his serious medical\n\nneeds. Mr. Gargan claims the defendants used excessive force by spraying him\n\nwith four cans of oleoresin capsicum, commonly known as pepper spray, while\n\nextracting him from his cell. The spray caused him to “suffer severly [sic],” and\n\nthe defendants subsequently upgraded him to a medical 4 rating. Mr. Gargan also\n\n                                        -2-\n\fclaims the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs\n\nby exposing him to secondhand pepper spray and refusing to treat his injuries.\n\n\n\n      The defendants filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Gargan’s complaint under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In their motion, the defendants argued\n\nMr. Gargan failed to allege facts sufficient to show a violation of his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights and, even if he did make such a showing, they were\n\nnonetheless entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted the\n\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss, stating Mr. Gargan failed “to sufficiently allege\n\nclaims for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” 1 Since we are in agreement with the\n\ndistrict court’s conclusion, we do not address the defendants’ claim of qualified\n\nimmunity.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          Mr. Gargan amended his complaint once as a matter of right. Although\nthe district court never granted Mr. Gargan permission to file additional amended\ncomplaints, Mr. Gargan later tendered second and third amended complaints. In\nits order to dismiss, the district court did not identify the specific complaint it was\ndismissing. As Mr. Gargan does not appeal the district court’s failure to grant\npermission to amend, this issue is waived, see Krastev v. Immigration &\nNaturalization Service, 292 F.3d 1268, 1280 (10th Cir. 2002), and we will\nexamine the last complaint filed, or the first amended complaint. We also note it\nwould have been futile for the district court to grant permission to amend, as Mr.\nGargan’s second and third amended complaints suffer from the same deficiencies\nas his first amended complaint.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f      We review the district court’s dismissal de novo, accepting as true all well-\n\npled factual allegations and construing those facts in a light most favorable to Mr.\n\nGargan as the non-moving party. See Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the Deaf &\n\nBlind, 173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir. 1999). Dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6) is appropriate only if “it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can\n\nprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”\n\nId. (quotation marks omitted). Although a pro se litigant’s pleadings are\n\nconstrued liberally, see Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991),\n\nthis court “will not supply additional factual allegations to round out a plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint or construct a legal theory on a plaintiff’s behalf,” Whitney v. New\n\nMexico, 113 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n      To state a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the\n\ndefendants deprived him of a constitutional right under color of state law. See\n\nNorthington v. Jackson, 973 F.2d 1518, 1523 (10th Cir. 1992). Mr. Gargan\n\nargues the defendants deprived him of his Eighth Amendment rights under color\n\nof state law by (1) spraying him with four cans of pepper spray during a cell\n\nextraction; (2) exposing him on two occasions to secondhand pepper spray; and\n\n(3) refusing to provide medical care for his injuries. The Eighth Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution provides: “Excessive bail shall not be required,\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fnor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” U.S.\n\nConst. amend. VIII. The Eighth Amendment applies to the states through the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. See Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 344-345 (1981).\n\n\n\n      We first turn to Mr. Gargan’s claim the defendants’ violated the Eighth\n\nAmendment by using excessive force in spraying him with pepper spray during a\n\ncell extraction. In order to state a claim for excessive use of force, Mr. Gargan\n\nmust show the defendants “acted maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose\n\nof causing harm rather than in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore\n\ndiscipline.” Mitchell v. Maynard, 80 F.3d 1433, 1440 (10th Cir. 1996). This\n\nstandard is appropriate “regardless of whether the corrections officers are\n\nquelling a prison disturbance or merely trying to maintain order.” Id. (quotation\n\nmarks nd citation omitted). A plaintiff need not allege “significant physical\n\ninjury to state a cause of action.” Id.\n\n\n\n      Mr. Gargan alleges the defendants, knowing of his heart condition, sprayed\n\nhim “4 times with 4 whole cans of [pepper spray] while [he was] unarmed, alone\n\nand secured in a segregation cell.” The defendants then ordered Mr. Gargan back\n\ninto his cell to clean up the residue “while naked and burned.” Id. at 8. As a\n\nresult of this incident, Mr. Gargan “suffered severly [sic] and was upgraded to a\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fmedical 4 rating.” The district court determined these factual allegations failed to\n\nstate a claim for relief. We agree. Nowhere does the complaint allege facts\n\nsufficient to support a reliable inference that pepper spray was used on Mr.\n\nGargan unnecessarily, excessively, or wantonly. There are simply no facts at all\n\ndiscussing the need, or lack thereof, to use pepper spray in extracting Mr. Gargan\n\nfrom his cell. The complaint also fails to allege exposure to pepper spray\n\naggravates Mr. Gargan’s heart condition or the defendants knew pepper spray\n\naggravates his heart condition.\n\n\n\n      We now turn to Mr. Gargan’s claims of deliberate indifference. These\n\nclaims fail for similar reasons. Mr. Gargan argues the defendants were\n\ndeliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in exposing him to\n\nsecondhand pepper spray. A deliberate indifference claim has two components:\n\n(1) an objective component requiring the pain or deprivation be sufficiently\n\nserious, and (2) a subjective component requiring the offending officials act with\n\na sufficiently culpable state of mind. See Perkins v. Kansas Dep’t of Corr., 165\n\nF.3d 803, 809 (10th Cir. 1999). A medical need is serious enough to meet the\n\nobjective component “if it is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as\n\nmandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily\n\nrecognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.” Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559,\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f575 (10th Cir. 1980) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The subjective\n\ncomponent is met if a prison “official knows of and disregards an excessive risk\n\nto inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the\n\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he\n\nmust also draw the inference.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).\n\n\n\n      Mr. Gargan alleges the defendants, knowing of his heart condition, exposed\n\nhim to pepper spray on two occasions when spraying neighboring prisoners. On\n\nat least the second incident, exposure to the pepper spray caused Mr. Gargan to\n\nsuffer “from vomiting, chest pain, dizziness and shortness of breath.” Mr. Gargan\n\nfails to allege, however, that the defendants acted with a sufficiently culpable\n\nstate of mind. Nowhere does Mr. Gargan state that exposure to pepper spray\n\naggravates his heart condition, that the defendants knew such exposure would\n\naggravate his heart condition, or that, despite such knowledge, the defendants\n\ndeliberately exposed him to pepper spray. Mr. Gargan states only that a nurse,\n\nfollowing the second incident, remarked to him she should have removed him\n\nfrom the area prior to using the spray. At most, this states a claim of negligence\n\ninsufficient to constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. See Whitley v. Albers,\n\n475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f      Mr. Gargan also argues the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his\n\nserious medical needs by refusing medical care subsequent to at least two\n\nincidents of pepper spray exposure. Mr. Gargan alleges a nurse on one occasion\n\n“refused me medical attention and would not listen to my complaints when I told\n\nher I had heart disease.” Another defendant later “denied I was a high risk for\n\ncardiac arrest when he answered my step 3 grievance.” Mr. Gargan once again\n\nfails to allege facts supporting a reliable inference of culpability on the part of the\n\ndefendants. There are simply no facts indicating whether the medical refusals\n\nwere wanton, negligent, or reasonable. There are also no facts indicating whether\n\nMr. Gargan’s alleged injuries are the result of an aggravation of his heart\n\ncondition or mere exposure to pepper spray. Absent these factual allegations, Mr.\n\nGargan cannot state a claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\n\nAlthough Mr. Gargan appears to disagree with the defendants’ medical judgment,\n\nmere disagreement with medical judgment does not rise to the level of an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976). It also\n\nappears from Mr. Gargan’s briefs filed in this court and the district court that he\n\nhas been receiving treatment for his heart condition and other maladies since first\n\nbeing exposed to pepper spray.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f      Mr. Gargan’s motion to proceed   in forma pauperis is granted, and the\n\njudgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is\n\nAFFIRMED .\n\n\n\n                                       Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                       WADE BRORBY\n                                       United States Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f",

New\n\nMexico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740601\"><a href=\"/opinion/740601/louise-whitney-v-state-of-new-mexico-charles-patrick-employee-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1173-74 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n      To state a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the\n\ndefendants deprived him of a constitutional right under color of state law. See\n\nNorthington v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590022\"><a href=\"/opinion/590022/no-92-1068/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1523 (10th Cir. 1992). Mr. Gargan\n\nargues the defendants deprived him of his Eighth Amendment rights under color\n\nof state law by (1) spraying him with four cans of pepper spray during a cell\n\nextraction; (2) exposing him on two occasions to secondhand pepper spray; and\n\n(3) refusing to provide medical care for his injuries. The Eighth Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution provides: “Excessive bail shall not be required,\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fnor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” U.S.\n\nConst. amend. VIII. The Eighth Amendment applies to the states through the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. See Rhodes v. Chapman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110518\"><a href=\"/opinion/110518/rhodes-v-chapman/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 344-345 (1981).\n\n\n\n      We first turn to Mr. Gargan’s claim the defendants’ violated the Eighth\n\nAmendment by using excessive force in spraying him with pepper spray during a\n\ncell extraction. In order to state a claim for excessive use of force, Mr. Gargan\n\nmust show the defendants “acted maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose\n\nof causing harm rather than in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore\n\ndiscipline.” Mitchell v. Maynard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715843\"><a href=\"/opinion/715843/carl-demetrius-mitchell-v-gary-d-maynard-director-of-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1440 (10th Cir. 1996). This\n\nstandard is appropriate “regardless of whether the corrections officers are\n\nquelling a prison disturbance or merely trying to maintain order.” Id. (quotation\n\nmarks nd citation omitted). A plaintiff need not allege “significant physical\n\ninjury to state a cause of action.” Id.\n\n\n\n      Mr. Gargan alleges the defendants, knowing of his heart condition, sprayed\n\nhim “4 times with 4 whole cans of [pepper spray] while [he was] unarmed, alone\n\nand secured in a segregation cell.” The defendants then ordered Mr. Gargan back\n\ninto his cell to clean up the residue “while naked and burned.” Id. at 8. As a\n\nresult of this incident, Mr. Gargan “suffered severly [sic] and was upgraded to a\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fmedical 4 rating.” The district court determined these factual allegations failed to\n\nstate a claim for relief. We agree. Nowhere does the complaint allege facts\n\nsufficient to support a reliable inference that pepper spray was used on Mr.\n\nGargan unnecessarily, excessively, or wantonly. There are simply no facts at all\n\ndiscussing the need, or lack thereof, to use pepper spray in extracting Mr. Gargan\n\nfrom his cell. The complaint also fails to allege exposure to pepper spray\n\naggravates Mr. Gargan’s heart condition or the defendants knew pepper spray\n\naggravates his heart condition.\n\n\n\n      We now turn to Mr. Gargan’s claims of deliberate indifference. These\n\nclaims fail for similar reasons. Mr. Gargan argues the defendants were\n\ndeliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in exposing him to\n\nsecondhand pepper spray. A deliberate indifference claim has two components:\n\n(1) an objective component requiring the pain or deprivation be sufficiently\n\nserious, and (2) a subjective component requiring the offending officials act with\n\na sufficiently culpable state of mind. See Perkins v. Kansas Dep’t of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157433\"><a href=\"/opinion/157433/perkins-v-kansas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (10th Cir. 1999). A medical need is serious enough to meet the\n\nobjective component “if it is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as\n\nmandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily\n\nrecognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.” Ramos v. Lamm, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f575 (10th Cir. 1980) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The subjective\n\ncomponent is met if a prison “official knows of and disregards an excessive risk\n\nto inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the\n\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he\n\nmust also draw the inference.” Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837 (1994).\n\n\n\n      Mr. Gargan alleges the defendants, knowing of his heart condition, exposed\n\nhim to pepper spray on two occasions when spraying neighboring prisoners. On\n\nat least the second incident, exposure to the pepper spray caused Mr. Gargan to\n\nsuffer “from vomiting, chest pain, dizziness and shortness of breath.” Mr. Gargan\n\nfails to allege, however, that the defendants acted with a sufficiently culpable\n\nstate of mind. Nowhere does Mr. Gargan state that exposure to pepper spray\n\naggravates his heart condition, that the defendants knew such exposure would\n\naggravate his heart condition, or that, despite such knowledge, the defendants\n\ndeliberately exposed him to pepper spray. Mr. Gargan states only that a nurse,\n\nfollowing the second incident, remarked to him she should have removed him\n\nfrom the area prior to using the spray. At most, this states a claim of negligence\n\ninsufficient to constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. See Whitley v. Albers,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1986).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f      Mr. Gargan also argues the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his\n\nserious medical needs by refusing medical care subsequent to at least two\n\nincidents of pepper spray exposure. Mr. Gargan alleges a nurse on one occasion\n\n“refused me medical attention and would not listen to my complaints when I told\n\nher I had heart disease.” Another defendant later “denied I was a high risk for\n\ncardiac arrest when he answered my step 3 grievance.” Mr. Gargan once again\n\nfails to allege facts supporting a reliable inference of culpability on the part of the\n\ndefendants. There are simply no facts indicating whether the medical refusals\n\nwere wanton, negligent, or reasonable. There are also no facts indicating whether\n\nMr. Gargan’s alleged injuries are the result of an aggravation of his heart\n\ncondition or mere exposure to pepper spray. Absent these factual allegations, Mr.\n\nGargan cannot state a claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\n\nAlthough Mr. Gargan appears to disagree with the defendants’ medical judgment,\n\nmere disagreement with medical judgment does not rise to the level of an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation. See Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 (1976). It also\n\nappears from Mr. Gargan’s briefs filed in this court and the district court that he\n\nhas been receiving treatment for his heart condition and other maladies since first\n\nbeing exposed to pepper spray.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f      Mr. Gargan’s motion to proceed   in forma pauperis is granted, and the\n\njudgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is\n\nAFFIRMED .\n\n\n\n                                       Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                       WADE BRORBY\n                                       United States Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f</pre>",
