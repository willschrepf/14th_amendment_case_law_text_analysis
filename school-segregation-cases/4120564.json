(CR, p. 4). Appellee Gayla Renee Noble filed a first amended\n\ncounterpetition for divorce seeking damages for assaults). (CR, p. 48). Following\n\na bench trial in the 62nd Judicial District Court of Franklin County, Texas, on March\n\n2, 2016, Honorable Judge Will Biard awarded Respondent Gayla Renee Lawrence,\n\nrelevant to this appeal, a total of $250,600.00 for reasonable and necessary medical\n\nexpenses in the past, physical pain, suffering, and mental anguish in the past and\n\nfuture, and disfigurement in a final decree of divorce signed on March 24, 2016. (CR,\n\np. 55). Respondent was also awarded attorney’s fees, one-half interest in a house, a\n\n2010 Mercedes vehicle, a Rolex watch, a wedding ring and proceeds from its sale,\n\nand furniture. Petitioner filed a Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\non March 29, 2016, and Notice of Past-Due Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\non April 19, 2016. (CR, pp. 63, 68). Petitioner filed a Motion for New Trial on April\n\n20, 2016 which was denied on April 20, 2016. (CR, p. 70). Petitioner filed his\n\nNotice of Appeal on April 25, 2016. (CR, p. 73). The Court filed Findings of Fact\n\nand Conclusions of Law on April 29, 2016. (CR, p. 80).\n\n\n\n\n                                         1\n\f                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Kerry Bryon Noble (“Bryon”) and Gayla Renee Lawrence (“Gayla”)were\n\nmarried on October 14, 2014. (RR, p. 9). Gayla moved out for the first time two\n\nweeks later. (RR, p. 10). She returned approximately a week later. (RR, p. 11).\n\nBryon filed for divorce approximately two weeks into the marriage. (RR, p. 25).\n\nHowever, the couple reconciled several times when Bryon promised to go to\n\ncounseling and church. (RR, pp. 26-27). At one point during the marriage, Gayla\n\nmoved to Sherman, Texas to live with her sister for around six weeks. (RR, p. 27).\n\nGayla eventually returned to live in a house owned by Bryon. (RR, p. 28). Gayla was\n\na nurse prior to meeting Bryon, but she stopped working during the marriage,\n\nclaiming he would not allow her to work, and her license lapsed. (RR, pp. 29-30).\n\nGayla worked as a nurse again from August 2015 until around two weeks before trial,\n\nwhen she was laid off. (RR, pp. 30-31). The couple attended counseling, starting\n\nin November 2014. (RR, p. 11). The couple finally separated in April 2015. (RR,\n\np. 10).\n\n      Gayla had possession of several items of value which were awarded to her by\n\nthe Court. She was living in a house in which she testified Bryon had given her a\n\none-half interest (RR, p. 19); she was driving a 2010 Mercedes which was already\n\npaid off and was owned by Bryon prior to the marriage; (RR, pp. 17-19, 58); she sold\n\n                                         2\n\fher wedding ring for approximately $9,000.00 (RR, p. 16); and she was carrying a\n\nLouis Vuitton purse the day of the trial for which Bryon had paid. (RR, p. 38). In\n\naddition, Gayla was working as a charge nurse making $19.00 per hour from August\n\n2015 until shortly before trial. (RR, p. 30-31). However, Gayla stated she felt that she\n\nwas entitled to more property because of alleged abuse by Bryon. (RR, p. 22).\n\n      Gayla claimed that she now “worries” and she believes she may need\n\ncounseling, but she did not know how much. (RR, p. 24). She stated that she felt\n\ndepressed and therefore did not work during the summer of 2015. (RR, p. 31). She\n\npaid her bills that summer with the proceeds from the ring she sold for $9,000.00.\n\n(RR, p. 31). At the time of trial she was training to work in freight brokering. (RR,\n\np. 72).\n\n      Gayla alleged that she had about $600.00 in medical expenses relating to\n\ninjuries caused by Bryon. (RR, p. 32). These expenses resulted from visits to\n\nchiropractor Tim Davis. (RR, p. 32). Gayla stated she visited the chiropractor\n\nbecause Bryon would hit her, three times a week at the beginning of the marriage, and\n\nfive or six times after she returned to live with him in February. (RR, p. 33). Gayla\n\nstated the altercations with Bryon started during their honeymoon in Dallas. (RR, p.\n\n52). She stated she woke up as he pulled her hair and dragged her out of bed,\n\nwhipped her, and threw her across the room and into a wall. (RR, p. 52). In January\n\n                                           3\n\f2015, Gayla claims Bryon hit her, kicked her in the head, hit her in the head, put a\n\nscarf down her throat, and held her by the knees. (RR, pp. 62-63). She went to the\n\npolice station and pictures were taken. (RR, pp. 63-64, Respondent’s Exhibits 3 and\n\n4). The pictures showed bruises and scrapes to her arms and legs. (RR, pp. 65-66).\n\nThe couple went to five or six sessions of marriage counseling. (RR, pp. 56, 61). She\n\nclaimed to have visited the chiropractor eight to ten times, but was not seeing him at\n\nthe time of trial. (RR, pp. 33-34). Gayla had two sessions with a counselor, which\n\noccurred six weeks or more before trial. (RR, p. 34). This cost $50.00 per session.\n\n(RR, p. 34). Gayla claims she is scared of Bryon, she has crying spells, and she hurts\n\nin her hips and the sides of her legs. (RR, pp. 73-74). However, she had suffered\n\nfrom back problems in the past. (RR, pp. 74-75). Gayla also stated that she had low\n\nself-esteem, but also testified that she had dated since her separation from Bryon.\n\n(RR, p. 92-93). Gayla also testified that she had sexual abuse issues from her father.\n\n(RR, p. 99).\n\n      Gayla testified concerning an assault in June 2015 that occurred while she was\n\ngiving Bryon a ride to the District Attorney’s office (RR, p. 104). He asked her to go\n\nto the District Attorney’s office to drop charges against him and he would drop\n\ncharges against her sons for attacking him. (RR, pp. 104-105). She claimed that\n\nduring this trip her face was slammed into a dashboard. (RR, p. 81). She said he\n\n                                          4\n\fchoked her and threw her all over. (RR, p. 83). She testified that pictures of those\n\ninjuries were taken in June by Tim Davis, her chiropractor. (RR, p. 81). Gayla\n\noffered the testimony of Tim Davis. (RR, p. 108). His testimony was the only\n\nevidence offered by any healthcare provider. He saw her beginning in May 2015.\n\n(RR, p. 108). She complained of neck pain, headaches, and hip pain. (RR, p. 108-\n\n109). She said she had been slammed into a dashboard and that she had a prior hip\n\nissue which she thought related to being slammed into the ground. (RR, p. 109). He\n\nfound bruising and a laceration on her head.        (RR, p. 110).    He took these\n\nphotographs on May 11, and not after the alleged June assault. (RR, p. 110,\n\nRespondent’s Exhibits 14 and 15). He diagnosed her with a neck sprain/strain and\n\nwith scar tissue built up in her right hip area. (RR, p. 111). Tim Davis did not know\n\nwhat caused the scar tissue. (RR, p. 112). He treated her with physical and\n\nphysiotherapy to decrease the edema and spasms from the strain/sprain. (RR, p. 112).\n\nHe saw her from May 11, 2015, until June 10, 2015, for a total of seven\n\nappointments. (RR, pp. 112-113). He treated her for the same thing every time. (RR,\n\np. 113). He thought she got better but he did not see her as much as he probably\n\nplanned. (RR, p. 113). She said she had pain but some of the orthopaedic tests that\n\nhe performed did not show any severe damage. (RR, p. 113). Davis did not release\n\nGayla as she simply did not return for any more visits. (RR, p. 114). Although he\n\n                                         5\n\fcalled her injury a whiplash, he did not grade it as any severe strain/sprain. (RR, p.\n\n118). Davis testified that the total bill for his services was approximately $407.00.\n\n(RR, p. 115). Interestingly, Gayla testified that an assault occurred on June 10, 2015.\n\n(RR, pp. 83, 96). Tim Davis saw her that day but nothing had changed in regard to\n\nher injuries. (RR, p. 113).\n\n      After leaving Bryon, but during the marriage, Gayla purchased a bed, a sofa,\n\na television, a kitchen table, washer and dryer, and a refrigerator to furnish her house.\n\n(RR, p. 35). Gayla testified that Bryon had signed over to her a 2010 Mercedes and\n\na one-half interest in a house which he owned prior to the marriage. (RR, pp. 16, 17,\n\n19, 38-39, 87). She had sold the wedding ring for $9000.00 and had a Louis Vuitton\n\npurse for which Bryon had paid. (RR, pp. 16, 38). Additionally, she had possession\n\nof Bryon’s Rolex watch which he owned prior to the marriage. (RR, pp. 15, 87).\n\nGayla requested $125,000.00 for the total amount of all actual damages sought. (RR,\n\npp. 126-127). However, the Court awarded her $250,600.00, in addition to one-half\n\ninterest in the house, the 2010 Mercedes, Rolex watch, wedding ring and any\n\nproceeds therefrom, and furniture.\n\n      Other relevant facts will be discussed in the “Argument” section below.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The Court in this short term marriage granted a divorce including a judgment\n\nfor damages totaling $250,600.00 for past and future pain and suffering and mental\n\nanguish, past medical expenses, and disfigurement. A trial court’s findings of fact\n\nand legal conclusions are reviewed applying the same standard that would be applied\n\nto a jury verdict. Catalina v. Blasdel, 881 SW2d 295 (Tex. 1994).\n\n      Gayla specifically alleged two incidents of assault occurring on January 21,\n\n2015 and June 10, 2015. (CR, p. 33). Regarding the January incident, Gayla\n\ndescribed being kicked and hit on the head. (RR, p. 63). The only evidence of injury\n\nfrom the incident were photographs of bruises. (RR, p. 65, R’s Exs. 3 and 4). Gayla\n\nsought no medical treatment until May 11, 2015 when she saw a chiropractor who\n\ndiagnosed her with     neck sprain/strain and scar tissue in the hip area.       The\n\nchiropractor whose testimony was the only medical expert testimony offered by Gayla\n\ncould not opine as to the cause of the scar tissue. Further, the chiropractor did not\n\ntestify that the events described by Gayla as occurring in January had caused the neck\n\nstrain. (RR, pp. 110-112). In regard to the second incident, the chiropractor saw\n\nGayla the day of the alleged second assault. The chiropractor described no new\n\ninjuries on June 10, 2015. (RR, p. 113).\n\n      Generally, expert testimony is necessary to establish causation as to medical\n\n                                           7\n\fconditions outside the common knowledge and experience of jurors. Guevara v.\n\nFerrer, 247 SW3d 662 (Tex. 2007). Gayla failed to offer such testimony and\n\ntherefore the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to find that Gayla suffered\n\npast and future pain and suffering as a result therefrom.\n\n      Further, the record is devoid of evidence to justify the award for past or future\n\nmental anguish. Generally, plaintiffs may not recover mental anguish damages unless\n\nthey introduce “direct evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of their mental\n\nanguish, thus establishing a substantial disruption in the plaintiff’s daily routine.”\n\nUniverse Life Ins. Co. v. Giles, 950 SW2d 48 (Tex. 1997). Gayla testified as to her\n\nworries and depression but admitted the following:\n\n             a. she had only seen a counselor twice;\n\n             b. had furnished her house during the pendency of the divorce;\n\n             c. had worked for a year before being laid off;\n\n             d. was in training for a new career; and\n\n             e. had been dating others. (RR, pp. 31, 34, 35, 70-72, 79, 92).\n\n        The evidence was also insufficient to support an award of $25,000.00 for\n\ndisfigurement. The evidence of scarring by Gayla appears to be very minimal. The\n\ncourt’s have consistently held that to secure an award of disfigurement, the injury\n\nmust be “that which impairs the beauty, symmetry, or appearance of a person”.\n\n                                           8\n\fPendergraft v. Carrillo, 272 SW3d 362, 367 (Tex.App. - Eastland 2008). The slight\n\nmarks referenced by Gayla do not rise to the level of disfigurement. The Court even\n\nawarded $600.00 in medical expenses which is more than were testified to by the\n\nchiropractor. (RR, p. 115).\n\n      Even if Gayla suffered pain and suffering and mental anguish, the damages\n\nawarded are excessive. A damage verdict will be set aside if it is excessive.\n\nSunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penney, 160 SW3d 230 (2015). Gayla through\n\ncounsel’s argument only requested $125,000.00 in damages but the trial court\n\nawarded twice that amount. (RR, pp. 126-127). Gayla only had $407.00 of\n\nchiropractic expense; had no severe injuries; had seen a counselor only twice; and had\n\nbeen working as a charge nurse but was awarded damages of $250,600.00.\n\n      The trial court further found that Bryon had given a Rolex watch to Gayla. For\n\nthere to be a gift, there must be donative intent. Roberts v. Roberts, 999 SW2d 424\n\n(Tex.App. El Paso 1999).      The person claiming a gift must do so by clear and\n\nsubstantial evidence. Even Gayla in her testimony admitted that Bryon never said he\n\nwas giving the Rolex watch to her but that was simply her “conclusion”. (RR, p. 87).\n\n      For all the reasons described above, the verdict in this matter should be set\n\naside and a new trial granted or, in the alternative, the damages be found excessive\n\nand a remittitur ordered.\n\n                                          9\n\f                                 ISSUE NO. ONE\n\n             WAS THE EVIDENCE LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT\n             THE TRIAL COURT’S AWARD OF $200,000 FOR GAYLA\n             NOBLE’S PAST PAIN AND SUFFERING AND MENTAL\n             ANGUISH AS THE RESULT OF ANY ASSAULT BY BRYON\n             NOBLE?\n\n                                 ISSUE NO. TWO\n\n             WAS THE EVIDENCE FACTUALLY SUFFICIENT TO\n             SUPPORT THE TRIAL COURT’S AWARD OF $200,000 FOR\n             GAYLA NOBLE’S PAST PAIN AND SUFFERING AND MENTAL\n             ANGUISH AS THE RESULT OF ANY ASSAULT BY BRYON\n             NOBLE?\n\nArguments and Authorities\n\n      The Court of Appeals reviews a trial court’s findings of fact for legal and\n\nfactual sufficiency under the same standards it applies in reviewing a jury’s findings.\n\nCatalina v. Blasdel, supra. It reviews a trial court’s conclusions of law de novo.\n\nBMC Software Belgium, N.V. v. Marchand, 83 SW3d 789 (Tex. 2002). In analyzing\n\na legal sufficiency challenge the Court of Appeals must determine whether the\n\nevidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict\n\nunder review. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 SW3d 802 (Tex. 2005). The Court of\n\nAppeals must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the challenged\n\nfinding, crediting any favorable evidence if a reasonable fact-finder could and\n\ndisregarding any contrary evidence unless a reasonable fact finder could not. City of\n\n                                          10\n\fKeller v. Wilson, supra. The Court of Appeals may sustain a no-evidence or legal\n\nsufficiency challenge only when (1) the record discloses a complete absence of a vital\n\nfact; (2) the Court is barred by rules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only\n\nevidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the only evidence offered to prove a vital\n\nfact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the\n\nopposite of a vital fact. City of Keller v. Wilson, supra.\n\n        In analyzing a factual sufficiency challenge the Court of Appeals must\n\nconsider and weigh all the evidence and determine whether the evidence in support\n\nof a finding is so weak as to be clearly wrong and unjust or whether the finding is so\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and\n\nmanifestly unjust. Dow Chemical Co. v. Frances, 46 SW3d 237 (Tex. 2001). Bryon\n\nNoble will address each element of the award separately.\n\n       Past Pain and Suffering\n\n       A plaintiff can recover only for injuries caused by the event made the basis of\n\nthe suit.   Texarkana Memorial Hospital, Inc. v. Murdock, 946 SW2d 836 (Tex.\n\n1997). This causal nexus is strictly referable to the damages portion of the plaintiff’s\n\naction. Katy Springs & Manufacturing, Inc.v. Favalora, 476 SW3d 579 (Tex. App.\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2015, rev. den.). Even if the defendant’s liability has been\n\nestablished, proof of this causal connection is necessary to ascertain the amount of\n\n                                          11\n\fdamages to which the plaintiff is entitled. Katy Springs & Manufacturing, Inc. v.\n\nFavalora, supra.\n\n      To establish causation in a personal injury case, a plaintiff must prove that the\n\nconduct of the defendant caused an event and that event caused the plaintiff to suffer\n\ncompensable damages. This causal link between the event sued upon and the\n\nplaintiff’s injuries must be shown by competent evidence. Weidner v. Sanchez, 14\n\nSW3d 353 (Tex. App- Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n\n      The general rule has long been that expert testimony is necessary to establish\n\ncausation as to medical conditions outside the common knowledge and experience\n\nof jurors. Guevara v. Ferrer, 247 SW3d 662 (Tex. 2007). Testimony regarding\n\npossibilities does not establish causation. See Duff v. Yelin, 751 SW2d 175 (Tex.\n\n1988) where a doctor testified as to two possible causes of the plaintiff’s nerve injury.\n\nThe court found that while it is not absolutely necessary that an expert couch his\n\nopinions in terms of “reasonable medical probability”, a finding should not be upheld\n\nwhen it is based merely upon speculation and conjecture. Evidence of temporal\n\nproximity between an event and subsequently manifested physical conditions is\n\nrelevant but not necessarily proof of causation. Guevara v. Ferrer, supra. Non-\n\nexpert evidence alone is sufficient in a personal injury action to support a finding of\n\ncausation of injury only in limited circumstances where both the occurrence and\n\n                                           12\n\fconditions complained of are such that the general experience and common sense of\n\nlaypersons are sufficient to evaluate the conditions and whether they were probably\n\ncaused by the occurrence. Guevara v. Ferrer, supra.\n\n       In the present case, Gayla specifically pleaded two assaults, one occurring on\n\nJanuary 21, 2015 and the other on June 10, 2015. (CR, p. 48). The only expert\n\ntestimony offered by Gayla as to the cause of her injuries was that of Tim Davis, a\n\nchiropractor. (RR, pp. 32, 33, 108-111). Davis saw Gayla for the first time on May\n\n11, 2015. (R’s Ex.16; RR, pp. 108, 110-111).\n\n       Gayla complained of neck pain, headaches and hip pain. (RR, pp. 108-109).\n\nShe said she had been slammed into a dashboard and that she had a prior hip issue\n\nwhich she thought related to being slammed into the ground. (RR, p. 109). He found\n\nbruising and a laceration on her head. (RR, p. 110). He took photographs of Gayla\n\non May 11, 2015. (RR, pp. 110-111, R.’s Exs. 14 and 15). He diagnosed her with\n\na neck sprain/strain and with scar tissue built up in her right hip area. (RR, p. 111).\n\nTim Davis did not know what had caused the scar tissue. (RR, p. 112). It could have\n\nbeen from trauma or from repetitive stress. (RR, p. 112).        Bruising and a head\n\nlaceration on May 11, 2015 clearly should not be evident from an injury occurring in\n\nJanuary 21, 2015. Further, Davis did not testify that the assault described by Gayla\n\nas occurring on January 21, 2015 had caused the neck sprain/ strain or any scar tissue\n\n                                          13\n\fin the right hip area. In fact, Davis could not even say that trauma had caused any\n\nsuch hip scar tissue. It could just as easily have been caused by repetitive stress.\n\n(RR, p. 112).\n\n      Secondly, Gayla pleaded and testified that an assault occurred on June 10,\n\n2015. (CR, p. 48, RR, pp. 81, 83-84; R’s Ex. 10). Gayla’s own testimony brings\n\ncausation into issue. Gayla testified that she saw Tim Davis in June, 2015 after being\n\nslammed into the dashboard by Bryon. (RR, p. 81). She testified that Tim Davis took\n\nphotographs of these injuries. (RR, pp. 81-83). She testified that in regard to this\n\nincident Bryon had slammed her into the dashboard, was throwing her all over and\n\nhad her pinned under the steering wheel. (RR, pp. 81-83). She stated she had to be\n\nrescued by the Hopkins County Sheriff’s Office. (RR, pp. 81-83). However, Tim\n\nDavis testified that he took photographs only on May 11, 2015. (RR, p. 111; R.’s\n\nExs. 14 and 15). Furthermore, June 10, 2015 was the last day on which Tim Davis\n\nprovided treatment to Gayla. (RR, pp. 112, 118; R.’s Ex.16). He described no new\n\ninjuries that day as he treated her for the same thing every time. (RR, p. 113).\n\nTherefore, if Gayla was assaulted on June 10, 2015, she appeared to have suffered no\n\nnew injuries from this assault.\n\n      Considering the above, the evidence is legally insufficient to support an award\n\nof damages from pain and suffering as there is no evidence that Byron’s conduct\n\n                                         14\n\fcaused the injuries about which Gayla complains.         Even if the Court finds the\n\nevidence legally sufficient, the evidence of such causation is so weak as to be clearly\n\nwrong and unjust or against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\n      As set forth above, Bryon asserts that the evidence fails to demonstrate a causal\n\nconnection between any assault and a resulting injury, including mental anguish.\n\nHowever, assuming the Court finds such a causal connection, Bryon would show that\n\nthe evidence is legally and/or factually insufficient to demonstrate mental anguish.\n\n      Past Mental Anguish\n\n      In the present case, the Court found that plaintiff had distress that was more\n\nthan mere disappointment, anger, resentment or embarrassment causing a substantial\n\ndisruption in the plaintiff’s daily routine, as supporting an award for mental anguish\n\ndamages. (CR, p. 84). Mental anguish as an element of damages is a relatively high\n\ndegree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere disappointment, anger,\n\nresent or embarrassment, although it may include all of these. PNS Stores, Inc. v.\n\nMunguia, 484 SW3d 503 (Tex. App.- Houston [ 14th Dist.} 2016, no pet.). Generally,\n\nplaintiffs may not recover mental anguish damages unless they introduce “direct\n\nevidence of the nature, duration, and severity of their mental anguish, thus\n\nestablishing a substantial disruption in the plaintiff’s daily routine.” Universe Life\n\nIns. Co. v. Giles, 950 SW2d 48 (Tex. 1997). This standard is intended to ensure that\n\n                                          15\n\ffact-finders are provided with adequate details to assess mental anguish. Universe\n\nLife. Ins. Co. v. Giles, supra.   An award of mental anguish damages will survive a\n\nlegal sufficiency challenge when the plaintiff introduces direct evidence of the nature,\n\nduration, and severity of his mental anguish, thus establishing a substantial disruption\n\nin the plaintiff’s routine. Fifth Club, Inc. v. Ramirez, 196 SW3d 788 (Tex. 2006).\n\nThe absence of direct evidence especially when it can be supplied by a plaintiff,\n\njustifies close judicial scrutiny of other evidence on this element of damages. Katy\n\nSprings & Manufacturing, Inc. v. Favalora, supra. In the absence of direct evidence,\n\nthe Court of Appeals applies traditional no evidence standards to determine whether\n\nthe record reveals any evidence of a high decree of mental pain and distress that is\n\nmore than mere worry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger to support any\n\naward of damages. Simply because a witness says the plaintiff suffered mental\n\nanguish does not constitute evidence of the nature, duration and severity of any\n\nmental anguish that is sufficient to show a substantial disruption of one’s daily\n\nroutine. Gunn Infiniti, Inc. v. O’Byrne, 996 SW2d 854 (Tex. 1999).\n\n       In regard to mental anguish, Gayla testified that she worried about her work\n\nand what was going to happen to her. (RR, p. 24). She stated she had been depressed\n\nin the summer of 2015 and did not work but went back to work as a nurse when\n\nschool started in August, 2015. (RR, p. 31). She worked until a few weeks before\n\n                                          16\n\fthe trial when she was laid off. (RR, pp. 70-71). She said she did not want to be a\n\nnurse anymore because she questioned her judgment and was nervous. (RR, p. 72).\n\nShe was actually training for a new job to be a freight broker. (RR, pp. 72-73). She\n\nsaid she had trouble sleeping because she needed to be alert. (RR, pp. 73-74). She\n\nsaid she cried a lot. (RR, p. 74). On the other hand, she had only seen a counselor\n\ntwice and that was only six weeks before the trial. (RR, p. 34). She had bought\n\nfurnishings for her house. (RR, pp. 35, 79). Gayla was clearly angry but her daily\n\nlife was not substantially disrupted. She worked for nearly a year and only stopped\n\nbecause she was laid off. She was training for a new career. She had her daughter\n\nliving with her and had her in school. (RR, p. 103). Gayla had even dated some.\n\n(RR, p. 92). Gayla’s testimony does not demonstrate a substantial disruption in her\n\nroutine so as to demonstrate mental anguish.\n\n      Similar evidence asserted of “mental anguish” was offered in Miller v.\n\nArgumaniz, 479 SW3d 306 (Tex. App. - El Paso 2015, rev. den.). There the plaintiff\n\ntestified that she was “very depressed”, “scared”, “concerned”, “nervous, very angry,\n\nand kind of lost”. She cried a lot, could not sleep, cried herself to sleep frequently,\n\nand had a hard time concentrating during the day. However, she continued to be\n\nemployed throughout the ordeal, and navigated through her days by being strong for\n\nher daughter. The plaintiff’s husband testified that he saw her cry up to fifteen\n\n                                          17\n\fminutes as frequently as three to four times per week. Her son testified that she was\n\naffected for a year. The Court found that while this evidence constituted some\n\nevidence of the nature and duration of the emotional pain experienced, it failed to\n\ndemonstrate a substantial disruption of her daily routine as a result. The Court,\n\ntherefore, found the evidence insufficient to support the award for mental anguish.\n\n      Another case demonstrating that Gayla failed to offer sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a finding of mental anguish is Pay and Save, Inc. v. Martinez, 452 SW3d 923\n\n(Tex. App. - El Paso 2014, rev. dism.). There the plaintiff had previously undergone\n\nsurgery for a brain tumor. While out shopping with his caregiver, he slipped on a\n\ncucumber peel. To keep from falling, he grabbed onto some beer boxes and twisted\n\nhis spinal column, back, and the upper part of his body. A jury awarded him\n\n$8,000.00 for past mental anguish. As evidence for this award, the plaintiff testified\n\nthat he was very nervous and scared when he slipped and was very worried about his\n\nspinal column, his ability to stand up, and a reopening of the operation performed on\n\nhis head and thought a fall would reopen the surgical wound on his head and kill him.\n\nPlaintiff testified that he suffered mental anguish and described the same as his fear.\n\nHe specifically testified that he was scared to go out at night. His caregiver testified\n\nthat after the accident, the plaintiff was afraid to go out to walk and was always\n\nlooking down at the floor thinking he was going to fall. The Court found that the\n\n                                          18\n\fevidence presented in support of the jury’s past mental anguish award focused on fear\n\nand anxiety regarding the slip at the store, walking and going out at night, and\n\nestablished that plaintiff needed additional assistance in putting on his shoes and\n\nsocks and walking around his house. However, the Court found that the evidence\n\nfailed to identify a “high degree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere\n\nworry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger” or to identify a substantial\n\ndisruption of the plaintiff’s daily routine. The Court, therefore, found the evidence\n\ninsufficient to support the award.\n\n      In Ortiz v. Furr’s Supermarkets, 26 SW3d 646 (Tex. App. - El Paso 2000, no\n\npet.), the plaintiff, an employee of a cleaning service, was assaulted by employees of\n\nFurr’s while he was performing cleaning services at a Furr’s cafeteria. In support of\n\nhis claim for mental anguish, the plaintiff testified that he felt offended and angry.\n\nHe stated that he suffered from loss of sleep one or two times per month. He stated\n\nthat his relationships were normal and his divorce was not caused by the incident.\n\nThe court found the evidence factually insufficient to support an award for mental\n\nanguish as he offered no evidence as to the nature, duration, or severity of his mental\n\nanguish nor did he state how his daily routine was disrupted.\n\n      These cases demonstrate that the evidence offered byGayla as to past mental\n\nanguish was legally and/or factually insufficient to support an award of damages for\n\n                                          19\n\fmental anguish.\n\n      If the Court finds some evidence of pain and suffering but none as to mental\n\nanguish, and the trial court failed to segregate damages, and the evidence supports an\n\naward for one of the damages but is insufficient as to others, the case must be\n\nremanded for a new trial on the damages. Pendergraft v. Carrillo, 273 SW3d 362\n\n(Tex.App. - Eastland 2008, rev. den.). Furthermore, when the Court remands for a\n\nnew trial on claims involving unliquidated damages, it must also remand for a new\n\ntrial on liability. Pendergraft v. Carrillo, supra.\n\n      For the above set forth reasons, this case should be remanded for a new trial as\n\nto liability and damages.\n\n\n                                  ISSUE NO. THREE\n\n      WAS THE AWARD OF $200,000.00 FOR PAST PAIN AND SUFFERING\n      AND MENTAL ANGUISH EXCESSIVE?\n\nArguments and Authorities\n\n      Even if the Court finds that there was some evidence to support an award of\n\ndamages for past pain and suffering and mental anguish, an award of $200,000.00 is\n\nexcessive for the injuries claimed by Gayla.\n\n      The standard of review for an excessive damages complaint is factual\n\nsufficiency of the evidence. General Motors Corp. v. Burry, 203 SW3d 514 (Tex.\n\n\n                                          20\n\fApp.-Fort Worth 2006, rev. den.). Under a factual insufficiency assertion, the\n\nevidence supporting the finding must be so weak or the evidence to the contrary so\n\noverwhelming that the answer should be set aside and a new trial granted. General\n\nMotors Corp. v. Burry, supra. In determining whether damages are excessive, the\n\nappellate court applies the same test as for any factual insufficiency question,\n\nexamining all the evidence in the record to determine whether all the evidence\n\nsupports the damage award, remitting if some portion is so factually insufficient or\n\nso against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly\n\nunjust. Sunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, 160 SW3d 230 (Tex. App.-Texarkana\n\n2005, no pet.). If the trier of fact returns a grossly excessive or inadequate award,\n\nthe appellate court will intervene, in accordance with recognized principle of law.\n\nSunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, supra. A damage verdict will be set aside on\n\nappeal where the record clearly indicates that the award was based on passion,\n\nprejudice, or improper motive, or is so excessive as to shock the conscience.\n\nSunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, supra.\n\n      In the present case, Gayla was awarded $200,000.00 for past pain and suffering\n\nand mental anguish even though she offered no evidence of any severe injury, a small\n\namount of chiropractic expenses, and limited chiropractic treatment. Bryon Noble\n\nwill address each element of the award separately as follows:\n\n                                         21\n\f      Past Pain and Suffering\n\n      Although Gayla talked about various assaults, she offered little testimony\n\nconcerning pain and suffering. The process of awarding damages for discretionary\n\ninjuries such as pain and suffering is inherently difficult because the alleged injury\n\nis a subjective, unliquidated, nonpecuniary loss. However, only pain consciously\n\nsuffered and experienced is compensable. Sunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny,\n\nsupra. Pain and suffering may be inferred or presumed as a consequence of severe\n\ninjuries. General Motors Corp. v. Burry, supra. (emphasis added). The duration of\n\nthe pain and mental anguish is an important consideration in determining damages\n\nawarded for pain and suffering. General Motors Corp. v. Burry, supra. The trier of\n\nfact is given a great deal of discretion in awarding an amount of damage it deems\n\nappropriate for pain and suffering. However, there must be some evidence to justify\n\nthe amount awarded, as a jury cannot simply pick a number and put it in the blank.\n\nGeneral Motors Corp. v. Burry, supra. The Court of Appeals may exercise its power\n\nand suggest a remittitur when there is insufficient evidence to support the full amount\n\nof damages awarded but sufficient to support a lesser award. If part of a damage\n\naward lacks sufficient evidentiary support, the proper course is to suggest a remittitur\n\nof that part of the verdict. The prevailing party in the trial court should be given the\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\foption of accepting the remittitur or having the case remanded. Larson v. Cactus\n\nUtility Co., 730 SW2d 640 (Tex 1987).\n\n      The evidence presented in this case was factually insufficient to support the\n\namount of the damages so awarded. Gayla testified that on January 21, 2016, Bryon\n\nhurt her. He hit her, kicked her in the head, hit her in the head, put a scarf down her\n\nthroat, and held her by the knees. (RR, pp. 62, 63). She went to the police\n\ndepartment and had pictures taken.       (RR, pp. 63, 64; R.’s Ex. 4). The pictures\n\nshowed bruises and scrapes to her arms and legs. (RR, p. 65). She testified that the\n\nbruises were gone. (RR, p. 65). She testified that she hurt every day in her hips and\n\nthe sides of her legs. (RR, p. 74). However, there was some indication that she had\n\nsuffered back problems in the past. (RR, pp. 74, 75).\n\n      Gayla testified concerning an assault on June 10, 2015 in which her face was\n\nslammed into a dashboard. (RR, pp. 81-83). She said Bryon had choked her and was\n\nthrowing her all over. (RR, p. 83). She testified that the picture of her black eye from\n\nthis incident was taken in June by Tim Davis, a chiropractor she saw. (RR, p. 81).\n\n      As previously stated, Tim Davis’s testimony was the only evidence offered by\n\nany healthcare provider. (RR, p. 108). He saw her beginning on May 11, 2015. (RR,\n\npp. 108, 112). She complained of neck pain, headaches and hip pain. (RR, pp. 108-\n\n109). She said she had been slammed into a dashboard and that she had a prior hip\n\n                                          23\n\fissue which she thought was related to being slammed into the ground. (RR, p. 109).\n\nHe found bruising and a laceration on her head. (RR, p. 110).        He took these\n\nphotographs on May 11, 2015 and not after the alleged June assault. (RR, pp. 110-\n\n111, R.’s Exs. 14 and 15). He diagnosed her with a neck sprain/strain and with scar\n\ntissue built up in her right hip area. (RR, p. 111). Tim Davis did not know what had\n\ncaused the scar tissue. (RR, p. 112).    It could have been from trauma or from\n\nrepetitive stress. (RR, p. 112). He treated her with physical and physiotherapy to\n\ndecrease the edema and spasms from the sprain/strain. (RR, p. 112). He saw her from\n\nMay 11, 2015 until June 10, 2015 for a total of seven appointments. (RR, pp. 112,\n\n113; R.’s Ex 16). He treated her for the same thing every time. (RR, p. 113). He\n\nthought she got better but he did not see her much as he probably planned. (RR,\n\np.113). She said she had pain but the orthopaedic testing that he performed did not\n\nshow any severe damage. (RR, p. 113). Although he called her injury a whiplash, he\n\ndid not grade it as any severe strain/sprain. (RR, p. 118). He believed she had\n\nimproved with the treatment but she did not come as much as he had planned. (RR,\n\np. 113).\n\n      Additionally, Gayla pleaded that an assault occurred on June 10, 2015 and\n\ntestified about the assault. (CR, p. 48; RR, p. 83). Tim Davis saw her that day but\n\nnothing had changed in regard to her injuries. (RR, p. 112-113). She offered no\n\n                                        24\n\fphotographic evidence of any injury from an assault on June 10, 2015. Nor did she\n\nseek any medical attention after June 10, 2015.\n\n      In regard to Gayla’s physical activities, pain and suffering did not appear to\n\nhave impacted the same. She stated she did not work during the marriage because\n\nBryon would not let her and not because she was physically unable. (RR, p. 29).\n\nAfter their separation, she had worked from August 2015 until two weeks before the\n\nfinal hearing as a charge nurse at a nursing home. (RR, pp. 30-31, 70-71). She was\n\nnot working as a nurse at the time of the hearing because she had been laid off a few\n\nweeks before as her employer was downsizing. (RR, p. 31, 67, 71). She was in\n\ntraining to do freight brokering. (RR, p. 30, 72-73). She had gone out twice with two\n\nseparate people since the separation. (RR, p. 92).\n\n      To support any award of damages, there must be evidence that the amount\n\nfound would fairly and reasonably compensate for the loss. Saenz v Fidelity and\n\nGuaranty Insurance Underwriters, 925 SW2d 607 (Tex. 1996). Here, Gayla had\n\nonly seen a chiropractor a total of seven times for injuries that were not severe and\n\nhad improved the last time he saw her.        The chiropractor had only found a\n\nsprain/strain. He had not referred her to anyone else for any further treatment. (RR,\n\np. 117).   She had no broken bones and no serious injuries. She sought no other\n\nmedical treatment. At the time of the trial, it had been nearly ten months since she\n\n                                         25\n\fhad sought any medical treatment for her physical injuries. She offered no evidence\n\nof having been prescribed any medications and did not even offer evidence of having\n\nto take over the counter medications for pain. She had been able to work as a charge\n\nnurse for nearly a year after the last alleged assault which she testified occurred on\n\nJune 10, 2015. She had even dated. She was living in the house in which she\n\ntestified Byron had given her a one-half interest; she was driving a paid for 2010\n\nMercedes; carrying a Louis Vuitton purse; and working as a charge nurse. (RR, pp.\n\n16, 17, 19, 21, 38-39, 58-60). Surely, if the pain was that intense she would have at\n\nleast tried to sell the purse to get money for medical treatment. She described no\n\naction which she took to alleviate the pain. She did not testify as to the severity;\n\nduration; or extent of the pain. Unquestionably, these are important considerations\n\nin considering a proper damage award. Sunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, supra.\n\nHowever, Gayla offered no evidence of the same.\n\n      Past Mental Anguish\n\n      The other element of the $200,000.00 award was past mental anguish. As\n\npreviously detailed, mental anguish as an element of damages is a relatively high\n\ndegree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere disappointment, anger,\n\nresentment or embarrassment, although it may include all of these. PNS Stores, Inc.\n\nv. Munguia, supra. Generally, plaintiffs may not recover mental anguish damages\n\n                                         26\n\funless they introduce “direct evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of their\n\nmental anguish, thus establishing a substantial disruption in the plaintiff’s daily\n\nroutine.” Universe Life Ins. Co. v. Giles, supra. This standard is intended to ensure\n\nthat fact-finders are provided with adequate details to assess mental anguish.\n\nUniverse Life. Ins. Co. v. Giles, supra.     In addition to evidence of compensable\n\nmental anguish, evidence must also be presented to justify the amount awarded.\n\nSaenz v. Fidelity & Guar. Ins. Underwriters, supra. The trier of fact must find an\n\namount that fairly and reasonably compensates for the loss. Saenz v. Fidelity &\n\nGuar. Ins. Underwriters, supra. The Texas Supreme Court has admonished courts\n\nto closely scrutinize such awards.      Saenz v. Fidelity & Guar. Ins. Underwriters,\n\nsupra.\n\n         As evidence of mental anguish, Gayla testified that she worried about her work\n\nand what was going to happen to her. (RR, p. 24). She stated she had been depressed\n\nin the summer of 2015 and did not work but went back to work as a nurse when\n\nschool started in August, 2015.      (RR, pp. 30-31). She worked until a few weeks\n\nbefore the trial when she was laid off due to her employer downsizing. (RR, pp. 30,\n\n70-71). She said she did not want to be a nurse anymore because she questioned her\n\njudgment and was nervous. (RR, p. 71-72). She was actually training to be a freight\n\nbroker. (RR, pp. 72-73). She said she had trouble sleeping because she needed to\n\n                                           27\n\fbe alert. (RR, pp. 73-74). She said she cried a lot. (RR, p. 74). On the other hand,\n\nshe had only seen a counselor twice and that was only six weeks before the trial.\n\n(RR, p. 34). Gayla was clearly angry but her daily life was not substantially\n\ndisrupted. She worked for nearly a year and only stopped because she was laid off.\n\nShe was training for a new career. She had her daughter living with her and had her\n\nchild in school. She had even dated some. She had a house to live in, a car to drive,\n\nand had been able to purchase new household furnishings from selling a $9000.00\n\nring which she had received from Bryon. (RR, pp. 16, 17, 19, 21, 58-60). The\n\nevidence simply does not support a large award of damages for mental anguish.\n\n      Furthermore, while each case must be judged on its own unique facts, it is\n\nproper to consider other approved awards in similar cases to determine if an amount\n\nawarded for pain and suffering and mental anguish is excessive. Sunbridge Health\n\nCare Corp. v. Penny, supra. As it is difficult to determine the proper amount to award\n\nfor pain and suffering and mental anguish, comparison of an award with others which\n\nhave secured approval of juries and courts tends to reinforce a determination of\n\nwhether a particular award is reasonable compensation, or is to some extent the\n\nproduct of an understandable but improper attempt to award compensation not\n\njustified by evidence or permitted by law. Landreth v. Reed, 570 SW2d 486 (Tex.\n\nCiv. App.-Texarkana 1978, no writ).\n\n                                         28\n\f      Demonstrating that similar types of injuries have not resulted in such large\n\nawards, Bryon offers the following verdicts in cases recently tried as cited in the\n\nTexas Lawyer:\n\n      In Jenkins v. Nguyen, in the Harris County Court at Law, a jury awarded only\n\n$5,211.00 for compensatory damages arising from a car accident in which the\n\ndefendant admitted liability to rear ending the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed\n\ndamages for neck and upper back pain, lumbar disk bulges, constant lower back pain,\n\npain radiating into his legs, bilateral shoulder and hip pain, headaches, blurred vision,\n\ndepression, anxiety, nervousness and ringing in the ears. (Texas Lawyer, July 1,\n\n2016).\n\n      In Cause No. DC-14-0306-K, in the 192nd Dallas County District Court a\n\nteenager claiming back and neck injuries in a collision recovered only $457.00.\n\n(Texas Lawyer, July 1, 2016).\n\n      In Fuents v. Kelley, No. DC-B-03019 in the 162nd Dallas County District\n\nCourt, a plaintiff claiming neck and back injuries and who went to a chiropractor for\n\nthree and a half months was awarded $11,956.00 with liability stipulated to by the\n\ndefendant. (Texas Lawyer, July 1, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f      In Yarbrough v. Bell, No. DC-13-12628 in the 162nd Dallas County District\n\nCourt, the plaintiff was awarded $16,024.00 for back and neck injuries arising from\n\na collision. (Texas Lawyer, July 1, 2016).\n\n      In Gomez v. Cornip, Cause No. 2014-40525 in the 281st Harris County District\n\nCourt, a plaintiff was awarded $24,989.00 for neck, back and abdominal injuries\n\narising from a car crash. (Texas Lawyer, July 1, 2016).\n\n      Additionally, see Manning v. Golden, 2014 WL 806326 (Tex. App.-Tyler, no\n\npet.) wherein the plaintiff suffered significant physical injuries, including broken ribs,\n\na punctured lung and pneumothorax, requiring the insertion of a chest tube, a broken\n\nnose, and facial lacerations, as well as bruises and contusions over large portions of\n\nher body as well as a shoulder injury. She further suffered from post traumatic stress\n\nsyndrome as testified to by her doctor. The jury awarded $40,000.00 for past pain\n\nand suffering and mental anguish.\n\n      Appellant can find no case in which the injuries sustained were only bruises\n\nand a neck strain/sprain for which the only treatment sought was less than $600.00\n\nfor chiropractic treatment and when the only medical evidence came from a\n\nchiropractor who stated the injuries were not severe that resulted in such a large\n\naward. Had this been a car accident producing the same injuries, $200,000.00, under\n\nthese set of facts as to injury would be regarded as excessive. Clearly, the court\n\n                                           30\n\fwanted to punish Bryon rather than compensate Gayla for the injuries suffered.\n\nEven Gayla’s own attorney’s argument supports this position as he requested only\n\n$125,000 for the total amount of all actual damages sought. (RR, pp. 126, 127).\n\nGayla’s small amount of medical expenses alone demonstrate the lack of any severe\n\npain and suffering. As for mental anguish, the cases discussed above clearly show\n\nthere must be evidence of more than mere worry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment,\n\nor anger. However, these are precisely the adjectives Gayla used while testifying to\n\ndescribe her current mental state.\n\n      For the above set forth reasons, the $200,000.00 award for past pain and\n\nsuffering and mental anguish is excessive and manifestly unjust. Bryon requests the\n\ncourt to remit the award or to remand this case for a new trial.\n\n\n\n                                 ISSUE NO.

One and Two as\n\nwell as the authorities previously cited in regard to pain and suffering and mental\n\nanguish.\n\n       Award as to Future Pain and Suffering\n\n       The duration of pain is an important consideration in any damage award.\n\nFigueroa v. Davis, 318 SW3d 53 (Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.). The\n\nmere fact of the existence of an injury does not prove compensable pain and\n\nsuffering. Gibbins v. Berlin, 162 SW3d 335 (Tex. App. - Fort Worth 2005, no pet.).\n\nEvidence of continuing pain can support an award for future physical pain. Gibbons\n\nv. Berlin, supra. Damages for future physical pain and suffering are recoverable in\n\na personal injury action if the trier of fact could reasonably infer that the plaintiff will\n\nfeel physical pain in the future. PNS Stores, Inc. v. Munguia, supra.\n\n       Gayla testified that she hurts every day in her hips and her legs. (RR, p. 74).\n\nGayla acknowledged that all her bruising was gone. (RR, p. 65). She described no\n\nneck or back pain. The chiropractor said she had neck sprain/strain. (RR, p. 111).\n\nHis testing showed no severe damage. (RR, pp. 113, 114, 118). He did not refer her\n\nto any other medical provider. (RR, p. 117). He believed she had improved. (RR,\n\np. 113). He testified that she had scar tissue built up on the right hip but it could have\n\n                                            32\n\fbeen caused by repetitive stress or trauma. He stated no opinion as to which he\n\nbelieved caused the same. (RR, p. 112).\n\n      The only evidence of any injury to Gayla’s legs was bruising. These were gone\n\nby the time of trial. (RR, p. 65). As to the hip pain, Gayla offered no competent\n\nevidence that such was caused by any assault by Bryon Noble. Again, a plaintiff can\n\nonly recover for injuries caused by the event made the basis of the suit. Texarkana\n\nMemorial Hospital, Inc. v. Murdock, supra. As previously stated, expert testimony\n\nis necessary to establish causation to medical conditions outside the common\n\nknowledge and experience of jurors. Guevara v. Ferrer, supra. Testimony regarding\n\npossibilities does not establish causation as set forth above. Duff v. Yelin, supra.\n\n      In the present case, there is no evidence demonstrating that any trauma caused\n\nany scarring/bursitis to Gayla’s hip. It was simply possible as it was possible that\n\nsuch was simply caused by repetitive activity. Therefore, if plaintiff was continuing\n\nto experience pain in the hip there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence\n\nto demonstrate that Bryon’s actions caused the same. Even if the court attributes the\n\nhip’s scar tissue to Bryon, there was not severe damage so as to support such a\n\nfinding for future pain and suffering.\n\n      Davis testified as to no treatment performed on Gayla’s legs. Bruising that had\n\nalready resolved was the only injury attributable thereto. Again, there is no material\n\n                                          33\n\fevidence that future pain in the leg would be attributable to any injury caused by\n\nBryon.\n\n      Future Mental Anguish\n\n      To support an award for future mental anguish a plaintiff must demonstrate a\n\nreasonable probability that he would suffer compensable mental anguish in the future.\n\nEven when an occurrence is of the type for which mental anguish damages are\n\nrecoverable, evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of the mental anguish are\n\nrequired. PNS Store, Inc. v. Munguia, supra. To meet the reasonable probability rule,\n\nas required to support an award for future mental anguish, a plaintiff must (1) present\n\nevidence that in reasonable probability, he will suffer damages in the future and (2)\n\nprove the probable reasonable amount of the future damages. Katy Springs &\n\nManufacturing, Inc. v. Favalora, supra. Furthermore, a plaintiff can recover only for\n\ninjuries caused by the event made the basis of the suit. Texarkana Memorial\n\nHospital, Inc. v. Murdock, supra. The amount of evidence needed to support an\n\naward for future mental anguish is extensive as demonstrated in Katy Springs &\n\nManufacturing, Inc. v. Favalora, supra.\n\n      In the Katy Springs case, supra, the plaintiff had suffered severe neck/back\n\ninjuries that required fusion surgery. The plaintiff’s doctor testified that the plaintiff\n\nwas depressed and had even cried in his office. The doctor further testified that:\n\n                                           34\n\f      “I think we need to get him, as I recommended, in physical therapy and\n      psychiatric treatment otherwise, he’s going to have a miserable future.\n      He’s already depressed; basically crying in the office. He’s told me he’s\n      been to the emergency room, not because he had an increase in his pain,\n      just he couldn’t deal with it (the pain) so tired of living with it (the pain).\n      So I think that you know, he’s going to become a long-term chronic pain\n      patient. And especially with a psychological overlay from the depression,\n      it’s not a very bright future. That’s why we need to get him into (physical)\n      therapy and get him to a psychiatrist.”\n\n      The court found that such evidence did not demonstrate a reasonable\n\nprobability that the plaintiff would suffer compensable mental anguish in the future.\n\nThe court found that the severity of the injury and the evidence of his mental pain did\n\nnot rise to the level of the severity of the evidence propounded in other personal\n\ninjury cases. The evidence that he was “very depressed” and could look forward to\n\na bleak future unless he received psychiatric treatment - were not specific evidence\n\nof the lasting nature, severity, and duration of the plaintiff’s mental anguish.\n\n      The evidence offered by Gayla fails to meet this high standard. Gayla had only\n\ngone to a counselor twice but did not bring this person to testify. She had stopped\n\nworking as a nurse because she was laid off - not fired. She was able to train for a\n\nnew career. She had been able to continue to furnish her home; keep possession of\n\nher daughter, and to date two separate people. (RR, pp. 30, 31, 35, 71-73, 92, 103).\n\nShe did not show a reasonable probability that any future mental anguish was likely\n\nto be suffered.\n\n                                          35\n\f      For the above set for reasons, the evidence was legally and/or factually\n\ninsufficient to support an award of damages for future pain and suffering and mental\n\nanguish.\n\n\n\n                                   ISSUE NO. SIX\n\n             WAS THE AWARD OF DAMAGES FOR DAMAGES FOR\n             FUTURE PAIN AND SUFFERING AND MENTAL ANGUISH\n             EXCESSIVE?\n\nArguments and Authorities\n\n      For purposes of this argument, Appellant adopts by reference the arguments\n\nand authorities previously cited as well as the standard of review set forth in Issue No.\n\nThree.\n\n      Even if the Court finds that Gayla has offered sufficient evidence to support an\n\naward of damages for future pain and suffering and mental anguish, the amount\n\nawarded must be supported by evidence that the amount is fair and reasonable.\n\nDurban v. Guajardo, 79 SW3d 198 (Tex. App. - Dallas 2002, no pet.). The law\n\nrequires appellate courts to conduct factual sufficiency reviews on damage awards in\n\npersonal injury cases. Hawkins v. Walker, 238 SW3d 517 (Tex. App. - Beaumont\n\n2007, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n                                           36\n\f      Here, Gayla was working as a nurse and had for the prior nine months, had\n\nsought no medical treatment and limited counseling, was taking care of her daughter,\n\nand had dated on at least two occasions. (RR, pp. 30, 34, 70-73, 92, 103). From the\n\ncases previously cited, these damages were so excessive as to shock the conscience.\n\n     For such reasons, this case should be remanded for a new trial as the evidence\n\nis factually insufficient to support the amount of damages awarded or a remittitur of\n\nthe damages.\n\n\n\n                               ISSUE NO. SEVEN\n\n             WAS THE EVIDENCE LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT\n             THE AWARD OF DAMAGES FOR DISFIGUREMENT?\n\n                                ISSUE NO. EIGHT\n\n             WAS THE EVIDENCE FACTUALLY SUFFICIENT TO\n             SUPPORT THE AWARD OF DAMAGES FOR\n             DISFIGUREMENT?\n\nArguments and Authorities\n\n      The Court’s award to Gayla of $25,000.00 for “disfigurement” is neither\n\nlegally nor factually sufficient to support such an award for either past and/or future\n\ndisfigurement.\n\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\f      The courts define disfigurement as “that which impairs or injures the beauty,\n\nsymmetry, or appearance of a person...”that which renders unsightly, misshapen or\n\nimperfect, or deforms in some manner.” Pendergraft v. Carrillo, supra (quoting\n\nGoldman v. Torres, 341 SW2d 154, 160 (1960); Sunbridge Healthcare Corp. v.\n\nPenny, supra. Feelings of embarrassment of the victim are insufficient alone to infer\n\nthat the injury is in fact sufficiently disfiguring to justify an award of damages.\n\nSharon v. Martinez, 900 SW2d 777 (Tex. App. - Corpus Christi 1996, no pet.).\n\nDamages for disfigurement must be measured from the date of the injury until the\n\ntime disfigurement is expected to end. Sunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, supra.\n\nWhile proof of additional scarring or deforming is not required to recover damage for\n\nfuture disfigurement, it is a factor which the Court may consider in awarding\n\ndamages.    Hopkins County Hospital District v. Allen, 760 SW2d 341 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Texarkana 1988).\n\n      Gayla offered photographs of herself taken after the alleged January 21, 2015\n\nassault. (RR, p. 64, 66; R.’s Exs. 3 and 4). She stated that all the bruises were gone\n\nbut that she had scars on her arms and legs. (RR, p. 65-66; 76-77). Gayla testified\n\nthat she had pictures taken the day before the trial showing these same “scars” . (RR,\n\npp. 75-77, R.’s Exs. 7 and 8) She also stated that she had a scar above her nose from\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fbeing hit with a metal wall hanging, which appears to be a slight mark. (RR, p. 68,\n\nR.’s Ex. 5; (R.’s Ex. 15; RR, p. 75).\n\n      Any scarring suffered by Gayla seems minimal. These slight marks do not\n\nimpair Gayla Noble’s appearance so as to rise to the level of compensable\n\ndisfigurement. The evidence does not legally and/or factually support an award of\n\ndamages for disfigurement in the past.\n\n      As to any future disfigurement, Gayla acknowledged that all bruising was gone.\n\n(RR, pp. 65-66). She testified that she was embarrassed by the scars but frequently\n\nwears shorts. She could not state that the scarring was keeping her from doing\n\nanything. (RR, p. 78). Only “everything” kept her from doing anything. (RR, p. 78).\n\nThe evidence does not legally and/or factually support an award of damages for\n\ndisfigurement in the future.\n\n      As support for this position, see Pendergraft v. Carillo, supra. In Pendergraft,\n\nthe plaintiff was working in a stone quarry when he was struck in the face by an air\n\ncompressor hose. He sustained a non-displaced fracture of his jaw and a 2.5\n\ncentimeter laceration below his lip. Doctors secured a plate to the plaintiff’s jaw, and\n\nhe experienced tooth pain and expressed a desire to have several teeth removed.\n\nNevertheless, the court stated there was no evidence that the plaintiff had scarring or\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\fany other type of disfigurement, and therefore there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the trial court’s finding that the plaintiff suffered disfigurement.\n\n         For the above set forth reasons, the evidence is legally and/or factually\n\ninsufficient to support the award of damages for past and/or future disfigurement.\n\n\n\n                                 ISSUE NO. NINE\n\n      WAS THE AWARD OF $25,000.00                          IN    DAMAGES        FOR\n      DISFIGUREMENT EXCESSIVE?\n\nArguments and Authorities\n\n      Bryon adopts by reference the standard of review as set forth in Issue No.\n\nThree.\n\n      Even if the Court finds the evidence sufficient to support an award of damages\n\nfor disfigurement, the amount of $25,000.00 awarded was grossly excessive. The\n\nevidence presented is simply factually insufficient to support such an award whether\n\nfor past and/or future disfigurement. While each case must be judged on its own\n\nfacts, it is proper to consider other approved awards in similar cases to determine if\n\na damage award is excessive. Sunbridge Health Care Corp. v. Penny, supra.\n\n      In this regard, Bryon would ask the Court to consider the amount of damages\n\nawarded in cases with much more extensive evidence of disfigurement as follows:\n\n\n                                          40\n\f       In Figueroa v. Davis, supra, the plaintiff was struck by another driver who ran\n\na stop sign. The plaintiff’s front teeth crumbled out of his mouth, leaving only small\n\npieces at his gumline that were not pulled until almost five years later and were still\n\nmissing at the time of trial. The jury awarded $10,000.00 for past disfigurement.\n\n       In Smith v. Carter, 2012 WL 3252499 (Tex. App. - Corpus Christi, rev. den.),\n\nthe plaintiff was thrown into a windshield which shattered during a traffic accident.\n\nAmong other injuries, the plaintiff sustained a scar on her forehead for which she had\n\nconsulted a plastic surgeon. She further needed surgery to remove glass fragments\n\nthat remained embedded in her forehead. The trial court awarded $5,000.00 for past\n\ndisfigurement.\n\n       These cases demonstrate more severe disfigurement than that demonstrated by\n\nGayla with a far lesser amount awarded therein. Again, the court’s award was\n\nintended to punish Bryon as opposed to compensating Gayla Noble.\n\n       For the above set for reasons, this award of damages should be reversed and\n\nrendered and/or reversed and remanded for a new trial and/or the Court should order\n\na remittitur.\n\n                                  ISSUE NO. TEN\n\n                WAS THE EVIDENCE LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT\n                THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL EXPENSES AWARDED TO\n                GAYLA NOBLE?\n\n                                          41\n\f                               ISSUE NO. ELEVEN\n\n             WAS THE EVIDENCE FACTUALLY SUFFICIENT TO\n             SUPPORT THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL EXPENSES\n             AWARDED TO GAYLA NOBLE?\n\nArguments and Authorities\n\n      Bryon adopts by reference the standard of review as set forth in Issues\n\nNo. One and Two.\n\n      In regard to medical expenses, Gayla offered only the testimony of a\n\nchiropractor, Tim Davis. Davis testified it was apparent that Gayla had suffered some\n\ntype of trauma to her neck. (RR, p. 111). He said she had some scar tissue built up\n\nin her right hip bursa area. (RR, p. 111). He said that it could have been caused by\n\ntrauma or by repetitive stress. (RR, p. 112). He could not pinpoint that on anything.\n\n(RR, p. 112). He, therefore, did not opine that any hip injury was the result of trauma.\n\n      An analogous situation was presented in Guevara v. Ferrer, supra. There an\n\n86 year old man was involved in a car accident. He was hospitalized following the\n\naccident. The only medical evidence offered was a medical record that the plaintiff\n\nhad been in an automobile accident in which he sustained multiple orthopedic injuries\n\nand had developed bacteria and respiratory distress. The medical records also noted\n\nother serious health issues which the plaintiff had suffered in the past. He was\n\nawarded over $1,000,000.00 in medical expenses. No doctor actually testified but\n\n                                          42\n\frather the plaintiff’s family members testified that the accident had caused all of his\n\ninjuries.\n\n       The Supreme Court found that while some injury could be established by the\n\nevidence, all the injuries for which plaintiff had been treated were not established by\n\ncompetent expert testimony and remanded the case for remittitur.\n\n       Here, the evidence does not show that all treatment provided to Gayla Noble\n\nresulted from any assault but could have also arisen from repetitive activity, such as\n\na nurse would perform.\n\n       Secondly, even if the Court finds that the chiropractic expenses were\n\nreasonably and necessarily caused by Bryon’s conduct, the evidence is insufficient\n\nto support the amount of medical expenses awarded by the court. Tim Davis testified\n\nthat he had charged $300.00 - $400.00 for treating Gayla. (RR, p. 115). His\n\nchiropractic charges were reflected on Exhibit 16. (RR, p. 116; R’s Ex. 16). The\n\nchart reflected charges of $407.00. There is no evidence to support an award of\n\n$600.00. For such reason, the Court should reverse the judgment and remand the case\n\nfor a new trial. In cases where there is evidence to support some damages but no\n\nevidence to support the amount awarded, the court may remand or do a remittitur.\n\nGuevara v. Ferrer, supra.\n\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\f       These principles are demonstrated in Rentech Steal, LLC. v. Teel, 299 SW3d\n\n155 (Tex. App. - Eastland 2009, rev. dism.). There the jury awarded $550,000.00 in\n\npast medical expenses but the evidence proved only $381,788.00. The Court noted\n\nit could remand for a new trial or suggest a remittitur.\n\n      For the above set for reasons, this award of damages should be reversed and\n\nrendered and/or reversed and remanded for a new trial and/or the Court should order\n\na remittitur.\n\n                               ISSUE NO. TWELVE\n\n                WAS THE EVIDENCE LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT\n                A FINDING THAT BRYON NOBLE MADE A GIFT OF A ROLEX\n                WATCH TO GAYLA NOBLE?\n\n                              ISSUE NO.

Roberts\n\nv. Roberts, 999 SW2d 424 (Tex. App. - El Paso 1999, no pet.). The person claiming\n\n                                          44\n\fa gift must prove the gift by clear and substantial evidence. Hayes v. Rinehart, 65\n\nSW3d 286 (Tex.App. - Eastland 2001, no pet.). The element of intent to make a gift,\n\nas required to establish the existence of a gift must exist at the time of transfer. In re\n\nMarriage of Moncey, 404 SW3d 701 (Tex. App. - Texarkana 2013, no pet.).\n\nCircumstantial as well as direct evidence is competent either to sustain or to defeat\n\na gift. Jones v. Jones, 181 SW2d 988 (Tex.Civ.App. - Dallas 1944 writ ref’d w.o.m.).\n\nWhere however, witnesses do not attempt to state a purported donor’s oral\n\nexpressions, word for word, or in substance, but give their understanding of the\n\ndonor’s words, those opinions have no probative value. Christian v. Walker, 381\n\nSW2d 675 (Tex.Civ.App. - Texarkana 1964, no writ).\n\n      In the present case, Gayla claimed that Bryon gave her his Rolex watch. She\n\nclaimed that he had just beat on her, did not want her to leave, said he loved the\n\nwatch, and took it off his wrist. She further testified that he said that he loved this\n\nmore than anything else in his world and that this should show her how serious he\n\nwas. (RR, p. 87).\n\n      Her attorney then stated:\n\n             Q.     And he made a gift of it to you. That was your conclusion from\n                    what he said?\n\n             Y.     Yes.\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\f      However, Gayla then testified that Bryon filed an insurance claim for the watch\n\nas having been stolen and that he had wanted her to go along with it. (RR, pp. 87-88).\n\nGayla Noble had in fact pawned the watch. (RR, pp. 89-90). She claimed she had\n\npawned it because it was a very “pricey” watch and she wanted it to be safe as she\n\nwas afraid it would be stolen or she would lose it. (RR, p. 90). She testified that she\n\ngot it out of the pawn shop and took it to the police. (RR, p. 90).\n\n      Neither Gayla’s actions nor Bryon’s actions evidence the intent to make a gift.\n\nCircumstantially, a man’s Rolex watch would seem an unusual gift for a woman.\n\nPawning a “pricey” watch to keep it from being stolen or lost would seem to be more\n\nin line with someone trying to hide or secret the same which would seem hardly\n\nnecessary if the person in possession is the owner.\n\n      Gayla may have had possession of the watch but donative intent was not\n\nestablished. An analogous situation was presented in Christian v. Walker, supra.\n\nThere a son contended that his father had orally given him some land. The testimony\n\nwas as follows:\n\n      Q.     As I understand you, it was this: That your father said “if you will quit\n             your job, and go down there and keep it up, it will be yours. Isn’t that\n             what you testified?\n\n      A.     I moved down there with intention it was mine.\n\n      Q.     If you would quit and move down there, it would be yours?\n\n                                          46\n\f         A.    Well, I don’t know whether it was just exactly those words, but that’s\n               pretty close.\n\n         Q.    That’s the substance of it, isn’t it?\n\n         A.    Yes sir...\n\n         The Court found that the evidence produced cannot be construed as a clear\n\nmanifestation that the father intended to vest the rights of ownership to the land at the\n\ntime of the conversation.\n\n         Taking Gayla’s testimony at face value, it cannot be construed as a clear\n\nmanifestation that Bryon intended to make of gift of the same to Gayla.\n\n         For the above set forth reasons, the portion of the decree awarding Bryon’s\n\nRolex watch to Gayla as her sole and separate property should be reversed and\n\nrendered and/or alternatively, the case should be reversed and remanded for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n                            PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n         WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Appellant respectfully prays\n\nthat this Honorable Court set this case for oral argument, reverse and render the award\n\nof damages, or remand this case for a new trial, or remit the award.\n\n                                                  Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                  THE MOORE LAW FIRM, L.L.P.\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f                                           BY:/s/ Judy Hodgkiss\n                                              Judy Hodgkiss\n                                             State License #17136525\n                                             100 North Main Street\n                                             Paris, Texas 75460-4222\n                                             Telephone 903/784-4393\n                                             Facsimile 903/783-0042\n                                             Email: jhodgkiss@moorefirm.com\n                                             ATTORNEYS FOR APPELLANT,\n                                             KERRY BRYON NOBLE\n\n\n                      CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n      Pursuant to Rule 9.4(i)(3) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Brief\n\nof Appellant was a computer-generated document and contains 10,753 words, not\n\nincluding the Appendix, if any.

(CR, p. 4). Appellee Gayla Renee Noble filed a first amended\n\ncounterpetition for divorce seeking damages for assaults). (CR, p. 48). Following\n\na bench trial in the 62nd Judicial District Court of Franklin County, Texas, on March\n\n2, 2016, Honorable Judge Will Biard awarded Respondent Gayla Renee Lawrence,\n\nrelevant to this appeal, a total of $250,600.00 for reasonable and necessary medical\n\nexpenses in the past, physical pain, suffering, and mental anguish in the past and\n\nfuture, and disfigurement in a final decree of divorce signed on March 24, 2016. (CR,\n\np. 55). Respondent was also awarded attorney’s fees, one-half interest in a house, a\n\n2010 Mercedes vehicle, a Rolex watch, a wedding ring and proceeds from its sale,\n\nand furniture. Petitioner filed a Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\non March 29, 2016, and Notice of Past-Due Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\non April 19, 2016. (CR, pp. 63, 68). Petitioner filed a Motion for New Trial on April\n\n20, 2016 which was denied on April 20, 2016. (CR, p. 70). Petitioner filed his\n\nNotice of Appeal on April 25, 2016. (CR, p. 73). The Court filed Findings of Fact\n\nand Conclusions of Law on April 29, 2016. (CR, p. 80).\n\n\n\n\n                                         1\n\f                           STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Kerry Bryon Noble (“Bryon”) and Gayla Renee Lawrence (“Gayla”)were\n\nmarried on October 14, 2014. (RR, p. 9). Gayla moved out for the first time two\n\nweeks later. (RR, p. 10). She returned approximately a week later. (RR, p. 11).\n\nBryon filed for divorce approximately two weeks into the marriage. (RR, p. 25).\n\nHowever, the couple reconciled several times when Bryon promised to go to\n\ncounseling and church. (RR, pp. 26-27). At one point during the marriage, Gayla\n\nmoved to Sherman, Texas to live with her sister for around six weeks. (RR, p. 27).\n\nGayla eventually returned to live in a house owned by Bryon. (RR, p. 28). Gayla was\n\na nurse prior to meeting Bryon, but she stopped working during the marriage,\n\nclaiming he would not allow her to work, and her license lapsed. (RR, pp. 29-30).\n\nGayla worked as a nurse again from August 2015 until around two weeks before trial,\n\nwhen she was laid off. (RR, pp. 30-31). The couple attended counseling, starting\n\nin November 2014. (RR, p. 11). The couple finally separated in April 2015. (RR,\n\np. 10).\n\n      Gayla had possession of several items of value which were awarded to her by\n\nthe Court. She was living in a house in which she testified Bryon had given her a\n\none-half interest (RR, p. 19); she was driving a 2010 Mercedes which was already\n\npaid off and was owned by Bryon prior to the marriage; (RR, pp. 17-19, 58); she sold\n\n                                         2\n\fher wedding ring for approximately $9,000.00 (RR, p. 16); and she was carrying a\n\nLouis Vuitton purse the day of the trial for which Bryon had paid. (RR, p. 38). In\n\naddition, Gayla was working as a charge nurse making $19.00 per hour from August\n\n2015 until shortly before trial. (RR, p. 30-31). However, Gayla stated she felt that she\n\nwas entitled to more property because of alleged abuse by Bryon. (RR, p. 22).\n\n      Gayla claimed that she now “worries” and she believes she may need\n\ncounseling, but she did not know how much. (RR, p. 24). She stated that she felt\n\ndepressed and therefore did not work during the summer of 2015. (RR, p. 31). She\n\npaid her bills that summer with the proceeds from the ring she sold for $9,000.00.\n\n(RR, p. 31). At the time of trial she was training to work in freight brokering. (RR,\n\np. 72).\n\n      Gayla alleged that she had about $600.00 in medical expenses relating to\n\ninjuries caused by Bryon. (RR, p. 32). These expenses resulted from visits to\n\nchiropractor Tim Davis. (RR, p. 32). Gayla stated she visited the chiropractor\n\nbecause Bryon would hit her, three times a week at the beginning of the marriage, and\n\nfive or six times after she returned to live with him in February. (RR, p. 33). Gayla\n\nstated the altercations with Bryon started during their honeymoon in Dallas. (RR, p.\n\n52). She stated she woke up as he pulled her hair and dragged her out of bed,\n\nwhipped her, and threw her across the room and into a wall. (RR, p. 52). In January\n\n                                           3\n\f2015, Gayla claims Bryon hit her, kicked her in the head, hit her in the head, put a\n\nscarf down her throat, and held her by the knees. (RR, pp. 62-63). She went to the\n\npolice station and pictures were taken. (RR, pp. 63-64, Respondent’s Exhibits 3 and\n\n4). The pictures showed bruises and scrapes to her arms and legs. (RR, pp. 65-66).\n\nThe couple went to five or six sessions of marriage counseling. (RR, pp. 56, 61). She\n\nclaimed to have visited the chiropractor eight to ten times, but was not seeing him at\n\nthe time of trial. (RR, pp. 33-34). Gayla had two sessions with a counselor, which\n\noccurred six weeks or more before trial. (RR, p. 34). This cost $50.00 per session.\n\n(RR, p. 34). Gayla claims she is scared of Bryon, she has crying spells, and she hurts\n\nin her hips and the sides of her legs. (RR, pp. 73-74). However, she had suffered\n\nfrom back problems in the past. (RR, pp. 74-75). Gayla also stated that she had low\n\nself-esteem, but also testified that she had dated since her separation from Bryon.\n\n(RR, p. 92-93). Gayla also testified that she had sexual abuse issues from her father.\n\n(RR, p. 99).\n\n      Gayla testified concerning an assault in June 2015 that occurred while she was\n\ngiving Bryon a ride to the District Attorney’s office (RR, p. 104). He asked her to go\n\nto the District Attorney’s office to drop charges against him and he would drop\n\ncharges against her sons for attacking him. (RR, pp. 104-105). She claimed that\n\nduring this trip her face was slammed into a dashboard. (RR, p. 81). She said he\n\n                                          4\n\fchoked her and threw her all over. (RR, p. 83). She testified that pictures of those\n\ninjuries were taken in June by Tim Davis, her chiropractor. (RR, p. 81). Gayla\n\noffered the testimony of Tim Davis. (RR, p. 108). His testimony was the only\n\nevidence offered by any healthcare provider. He saw her beginning in May 2015.\n\n(RR, p. 108). She complained of neck pain, headaches, and hip pain. (RR, p. 108-\n\n109). She said she had been slammed into a dashboard and that she had a prior hip\n\nissue which she thought related to being slammed into the ground. (RR, p. 109). He\n\nfound bruising and a laceration on her head.        (RR, p. 110).    He took these\n\nphotographs on May 11, and not after the alleged June assault. (RR, p. 110,\n\nRespondent’s Exhibits 14 and 15). He diagnosed her with a neck sprain/strain and\n\nwith scar tissue built up in her right hip area. (RR, p. 111). Tim Davis did not know\n\nwhat caused the scar tissue. (RR, p. 112). He treated her with physical and\n\nphysiotherapy to decrease the edema and spasms from the strain/sprain. (RR, p. 112).\n\nHe saw her from May 11, 2015, until June 10, 2015, for a total of seven\n\nappointments. (RR, pp. 112-113). He treated her for the same thing every time. (RR,\n\np. 113). He thought she got better but he did not see her as much as he probably\n\nplanned. (RR, p. 113). She said she had pain but some of the orthopaedic tests that\n\nhe performed did not show any severe damage. (RR, p. 113). Davis did not release\n\nGayla as she simply did not return for any more visits. (RR, p. 114). Although he\n\n                                         5\n\fcalled her injury a whiplash, he did not grade it as any severe strain/sprain. (RR, p.\n\n118). Davis testified that the total bill for his services was approximately $407.00.\n\n(RR, p. 115). Interestingly, Gayla testified that an assault occurred on June 10, 2015.\n\n(RR, pp. 83, 96).

(CR, p. 33). Regarding the January incident, Gayla\n\ndescribed being kicked and hit on the head. (RR, p. 63). The only evidence of injury\n\nfrom the incident were photographs of bruises. (RR, p. 65, R’s Exs. 3 and 4). Gayla\n\nsought no medical treatment until May 11, 2015 when she saw a chiropractor who\n\ndiagnosed her with     neck sprain/strain and scar tissue in the hip area.       The\n\nchiropractor whose testimony was the only medical expert testimony offered by Gayla\n\ncould not opine as to the cause of the scar tissue. Further, the chiropractor did not\n\ntestify that the events described by Gayla as occurring in January had caused the neck\n\nstrain. (RR, pp. 110-112). In regard to the second incident, the chiropractor saw\n\nGayla the day of the alleged second assault. The chiropractor described no new\n\ninjuries on June 10, 2015.

Non-\n\nexpert evidence alone is sufficient in a personal injury action to support a finding of\n\ncausation of injury only in limited circumstances where both the occurrence and\n\n                                           12\n\fconditions complained of are such that the general experience and common sense of\n\nlaypersons are sufficient to evaluate the conditions and whether they were probably\n\ncaused by the occurrence. Guevara v. Ferrer, supra.\n\n       In the present case, Gayla specifically pleaded two assaults, one occurring on\n\nJanuary 21, 2015 and the other on June 10, 2015. (CR, p. 48). The only expert\n\ntestimony offered by Gayla as to the cause of her injuries was that of Tim Davis, a\n\nchiropractor. (RR, pp. 32, 33, 108-111). Davis saw Gayla for the first time on May\n\n11, 2015. (R’s Ex.16; RR, pp. 108, 110-111).\n\n       Gayla complained of neck pain, headaches and hip pain. (RR, pp. 108-109).\n\nShe said she had been slammed into a dashboard and that she had a prior hip issue\n\nwhich she thought related to being slammed into the ground. (RR, p. 109). He found\n\nbruising and a laceration on her head. (RR, p. 110). He took photographs of Gayla\n\non May 11, 2015. (RR, pp. 110-111, R.’s Exs. 14 and 15). He diagnosed her with\n\na neck sprain/strain and with scar tissue built up in her right hip area. (RR, p. 111).\n\nTim Davis did not know what had caused the scar tissue. (RR, p. 112). It could have\n\nbeen from trauma or from repetitive stress. (RR, p. 112).        Bruising and a head\n\nlaceration on May 11, 2015 clearly should not be evident from an injury occurring in\n\nJanuary 21, 2015. Further, Davis did not testify that the assault described by Gayla\n\nas occurring on January 21, 2015 had caused the neck sprain/ strain or any scar tissue\n\n                                          13\n\fin the right hip area. In fact, Davis could not even say that trauma had caused any\n\nsuch hip scar tissue. It could just as easily have been caused by repetitive stress.\n\n(RR, p. 112).\n\n      Secondly, Gayla pleaded and testified that an assault occurred on June 10,\n\n2015. (CR, p. 48, RR, pp. 81, 83-84; R’s Ex. 10). Gayla’s own testimony brings\n\ncausation into issue. Gayla testified that she saw Tim Davis in June, 2015 after being\n\nslammed into the dashboard by Bryon. (RR, p. 81). She testified that Tim Davis took\n\nphotographs of these injuries. (RR, pp. 81-83). She testified that in regard to this\n\nincident Bryon had slammed her into the dashboard, was throwing her all over and\n\nhad her pinned under the steering wheel. (RR, pp. 81-83). She stated she had to be\n\nrescued by the Hopkins County Sheriff’s Office. (RR, pp. 81-83). However, Tim\n\nDavis testified that he took photographs only on May 11, 2015. (RR, p. 111; R.’s\n\nExs. 14 and 15). Furthermore, June 10, 2015 was the last day on which Tim Davis\n\nprovided treatment to Gayla. (RR, pp. 112, 118; R.’s Ex.16). He described no new\n\ninjuries that day as he treated her for the same thing every time. (RR, p. 113).\n\nTherefore, if Gayla was assaulted on June 10, 2015, she appeared to have suffered no\n\nnew injuries from this assault.\n\n      Considering the above, the evidence is legally insufficient to support an award\n\nof damages from pain and suffering as there is no evidence that Byron’s conduct\n\n                                         14\n\fcaused the injuries about which Gayla complains.         Even if the Court finds the\n\nevidence legally sufficient, the evidence of such causation is so weak as to be clearly\n\nwrong and unjust or against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\n      As set forth above, Bryon asserts that the evidence fails to demonstrate a causal\n\nconnection between any assault and a resulting injury, including mental anguish.\n\nHowever, assuming the Court finds such a causal connection, Bryon would show that\n\nthe evidence is legally and/or factually insufficient to demonstrate mental anguish.\n\n      Past Mental Anguish\n\n      In the present case, the Court found that plaintiff had distress that was more\n\nthan mere disappointment, anger, resentment or embarrassment causing a substantial\n\ndisruption in the plaintiff’s daily routine, as supporting an award for mental anguish\n\ndamages. (CR, p. 84). Mental anguish as an element of damages is a relatively high\n\ndegree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere disappointment, anger,\n\nresent or embarrassment, although it may include all of these.

As evidence for this award, the plaintiff testified\n\nthat he was very nervous and scared when he slipped and was very worried about his\n\nspinal column, his ability to stand up, and a reopening of the operation performed on\n\nhis head and thought a fall would reopen the surgical wound on his head and kill him.\n\nPlaintiff testified that he suffered mental anguish and described the same as his fear.\n\nHe specifically testified that he was scared to go out at night. His caregiver testified\n\nthat after the accident, the plaintiff was afraid to go out to walk and was always\n\nlooking down at the floor thinking he was going to fall.

However, the Court found that the evidence\n\nfailed to identify a “high degree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere\n\nworry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger” or to identify a substantial\n\ndisruption of the plaintiff’s daily routine.

The process of awarding damages for discretionary\n\ninjuries such as pain and suffering is inherently difficult because the alleged injury\n\nis a subjective, unliquidated, nonpecuniary loss. However, only pain consciously\n\nsuffered and experienced is compensable. Sunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny,\n\nsupra. Pain and suffering may be inferred or presumed as a consequence of severe\n\ninjuries. General Motors Corp. v. Burry, supra. (emphasis added). The duration of\n\nthe pain and mental anguish is an important consideration in determining damages\n\nawarded for pain and suffering. General Motors Corp. v. Burry, supra. The trier of\n\nfact is given a great deal of discretion in awarding an amount of damage it deems\n\nappropriate for pain and suffering. However, there must be some evidence to justify\n\nthe amount awarded, as a jury cannot simply pick a number and put it in the blank.\n\nGeneral Motors Corp. v. Burry, supra. The Court of Appeals may exercise its power\n\nand suggest a remittitur when there is insufficient evidence to support the full amount\n\nof damages awarded but sufficient to support a lesser award.

Gayla testified that on January 21, 2016, Bryon\n\nhurt her. He hit her, kicked her in the head, hit her in the head, put a scarf down her\n\nthroat, and held her by the knees. (RR, pp. 62, 63). She went to the police\n\ndepartment and had pictures taken.       (RR, pp. 63, 64; R.’s Ex. 4). The pictures\n\nshowed bruises and scrapes to her arms and legs. (RR, p. 65). She testified that the\n\nbruises were gone. (RR, p. 65). She testified that she hurt every day in her hips and\n\nthe sides of her legs. (RR, p. 74). However, there was some indication that she had\n\nsuffered back problems in the past. (RR, pp. 74, 75).\n\n      Gayla testified concerning an assault on June 10, 2015 in which her face was\n\nslammed into a dashboard. (RR, pp. 81-83). She said Bryon had choked her and was\n\nthrowing her all over. (RR, p. 83). She testified that the picture of her black eye from\n\nthis incident was taken in June by Tim Davis, a chiropractor she saw. (RR, p. 81).\n\n      As previously stated, Tim Davis’s testimony was the only evidence offered by\n\nany healthcare provider. (RR, p. 108). He saw her beginning on May 11, 2015. (RR,\n\npp. 108, 112). She complained of neck pain, headaches and hip pain. (RR, pp. 108-\n\n109). She said she had been slammed into a dashboard and that she had a prior hip\n\n                                          23\n\fissue which she thought was related to being slammed into the ground. (RR, p. 109).\n\nHe found bruising and a laceration on her head. (RR, p. 110).        He took these\n\nphotographs on May 11, 2015 and not after the alleged June assault. (RR, pp. 110-\n\n111, R.’s Exs. 14 and 15). He diagnosed her with a neck sprain/strain and with scar\n\ntissue built up in her right hip area. (RR, p. 111). Tim Davis did not know what had\n\ncaused the scar tissue. (RR, p. 112).    It could have been from trauma or from\n\nrepetitive stress. (RR, p. 112). He treated her with physical and physiotherapy to\n\ndecrease the edema and spasms from the sprain/strain. (RR, p. 112). He saw her from\n\nMay 11, 2015 until June 10, 2015 for a total of seven appointments. (RR, pp. 112,\n\n113; R.’s Ex 16). He treated her for the same thing every time. (RR, p. 113). He\n\nthought she got better but he did not see her much as he probably planned. (RR,\n\np.113). She said she had pain but the orthopaedic testing that he performed did not\n\nshow any severe damage. (RR, p. 113). Although he called her injury a whiplash, he\n\ndid not grade it as any severe strain/sprain. (RR, p. 118). He believed she had\n\nimproved with the treatment but she did not come as much as he had planned. (RR,\n\np. 113).\n\n      Additionally, Gayla pleaded that an assault occurred on June 10, 2015 and\n\ntestified about the assault. (CR, p. 48; RR, p. 83). Tim Davis saw her that day but\n\nnothing had changed in regard to her injuries. (RR, p. 112-113). She offered no\n\n                                        24\n\fphotographic evidence of any injury from an assault on June 10, 2015. Nor did she\n\nseek any medical attention after June 10, 2015.\n\n      In regard to Gayla’s physical activities, pain and suffering did not appear to\n\nhave impacted the same. She stated she did not work during the marriage because\n\nBryon would not let her and not because she was physically unable. (RR, p. 29).\n\nAfter their separation, she had worked from August 2015 until two weeks before the\n\nfinal hearing as a charge nurse at a nursing home. (RR, pp. 30-31, 70-71). She was\n\nnot working as a nurse at the time of the hearing because she had been laid off a few\n\nweeks before as her employer was downsizing. (RR, p. 31, 67, 71). She was in\n\ntraining to do freight brokering. (RR, p. 30, 72-73). She had gone out twice with two\n\nseparate people since the separation. (RR, p. 92).\n\n      To support any award of damages, there must be evidence that the amount\n\nfound would fairly and reasonably compensate for the loss. Saenz v Fidelity and\n\nGuaranty Insurance Underwriters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768212\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768212/saenz-v-fidelity-guar-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1996). Here, Gayla had\n\nonly seen a chiropractor a total of seven times for injuries that were not severe and\n\nhad improved the last time he saw her.        The chiropractor had only found a\n\nsprain/strain. He had not referred her to anyone else for any further treatment. (RR,\n\np. 117).   She had no broken bones and no serious injuries. She sought no other\n\nmedical treatment. At the time of the trial, it had been nearly ten months since she\n\n                                         25\n\fhad sought any medical treatment for her physical injuries. She offered no evidence\n\nof having been prescribed any medications and did not even offer evidence of having\n\nto take over the counter medications for pain. She had been able to work as a charge\n\nnurse for nearly a year after the last alleged assault which she testified occurred on\n\nJune 10, 2015. She had even dated. She was living in the house in which she\n\ntestified Byron had given her a one-half interest; she was driving a paid for 2010\n\nMercedes; carrying a Louis Vuitton purse; and working as a charge nurse. (RR, pp.\n\n16, 17, 19, 21, 38-39, 58-60). Surely, if the pain was that intense she would have at\n\nleast tried to sell the purse to get money for medical treatment. She described no\n\naction which she took to alleviate the pain. She did not testify as to the severity;\n\nduration; or extent of the pain. Unquestionably, these are important considerations\n\nin considering a proper damage award. Sunbridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, supra.\n\nHowever, Gayla offered no evidence of the same.\n\n      Past Mental Anguish\n\n      The other element of the $200,000.00 award was past mental anguish. As\n\npreviously detailed, mental anguish as an element of damages is a relatively high\n\ndegree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere disappointment, anger,\n\nresentment or embarrassment, although it may include all of these. PNS Stores, Inc.\n\nv. Munguia, supra. Generally, plaintiffs may not recover mental anguish damages\n\n                                         26\n\funless they introduce “direct evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of their\n\nmental anguish, thus establishing a substantial disruption in the plaintiff’s daily\n\nroutine.” Universe Life Ins. Co. v. Giles, supra. This standard is intended to ensure\n\nthat fact-finders are provided with adequate details to assess mental anguish.\n\nUniverse Life. Ins. Co. v. Giles, supra.     In addition to evidence of compensable\n\nmental anguish, evidence must also be presented to justify the amount awarded.\n\nSaenz v. Fidelity & Guar. Ins. Underwriters, supra. The trier of fact must find an\n\namount that fairly and reasonably compensates for the loss. Saenz v. Fidelity &\n\nGuar. Ins. Underwriters, supra. The Texas Supreme Court has admonished courts\n\nto closely scrutinize such awards.      Saenz v. Fidelity & Guar. Ins. Underwriters,\n\nsupra.\n\n         As evidence of mental anguish, Gayla testified that she worried about her work\n\nand what was going to happen to her. (RR, p. 24). She stated she had been depressed\n\nin the summer of 2015 and did not work but went back to work as a nurse when\n\nschool started in August, 2015.      (RR, pp. 30-31). She worked until a few weeks\n\nbefore the trial when she was laid off due to her employer downsizing. (RR, pp. 30,\n\n70-71). She said she did not want to be a nurse anymore because she questioned her\n\njudgment and was nervous. (RR, p. 71-72). She was actually training to be a freight\n\nbroker. (RR, pp. 72-73). She said she had trouble sleeping because she needed to\n\n                                           27\n\fbe alert. (RR, pp. 73-74). She said she cried a lot. (RR, p. 74). On the other hand,\n\nshe had only seen a counselor twice and that was only six weeks before the trial.\n\n(RR, p. 34). Gayla was clearly angry but her daily life was not substantially\n\ndisrupted. She worked for nearly a year and only stopped because she was laid off.\n\nShe was training for a new career. She had her daughter living with her and had her\n\nchild in school. She had even dated some. She had a house to live in, a car to drive,\n\nand had been able to purchase new household furnishings from selling a $9000.00\n\nring which she had received from Bryon. (RR, pp. 16, 17, 19, 21, 58-60). The\n\nevidence simply does not support a large award of damages for mental anguish.\n\n      Furthermore, while each case must be judged on its own unique facts, it is\n\nproper to consider other approved awards in similar cases to determine if an amount\n\nawarded for pain and suffering and mental anguish is excessive. Sunbridge Health\n\nCare Corp. v. Penny, supra. As it is difficult to determine the proper amount to award\n\nfor pain and suffering and mental anguish, comparison of an award with others which\n\nhave secured approval of juries and courts tends to reinforce a determination of\n\nwhether a particular award is reasonable compensation, or is to some extent the\n\nproduct of an understandable but improper attempt to award compensation not\n\njustified by evidence or permitted by law.

She further suffered from post traumatic stress\n\nsyndrome as testified to by her doctor. The jury awarded $40,000.00 for past pain\n\nand suffering and mental anguish.\n\n      Appellant can find no case in which the injuries sustained were only bruises\n\nand a neck strain/sprain for which the only treatment sought was less than $600.00\n\nfor chiropractic treatment and when the only medical evidence came from a\n\nchiropractor who stated the injuries were not severe that resulted in such a large\n\naward. Had this been a car accident producing the same injuries, $200,000.00, under\n\nthese set of facts as to injury would be regarded as excessive. Clearly, the court\n\n                                           30\n\fwanted to punish Bryon rather than compensate Gayla for the injuries suffered.\n\nEven Gayla’s own attorney’s argument supports this position as he requested only\n\n$125,000 for the total amount of all actual damages sought. (RR, pp. 126, 127).\n\nGayla’s small amount of medical expenses alone demonstrate the lack of any severe\n\npain and suffering. As for mental anguish, the cases discussed above clearly show\n\nthere must be evidence of more than mere worry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment,\n\nor anger. However, these are precisely the adjectives Gayla used while testifying to\n\ndescribe her current mental state.\n\n      For the above set forth reasons, the $200,000.00 award for past pain and\n\nsuffering and mental anguish is excessive and manifestly unjust.

He testified that she had scar tissue built up on the right hip but it could have\n\n                                            32\n\fbeen caused by repetitive stress or trauma. He stated no opinion as to which he\n\nbelieved caused the same. (RR, p. 112).\n\n      The only evidence of any injury to Gayla’s legs was bruising. These were gone\n\nby the time of trial. (RR, p. 65). As to the hip pain, Gayla offered no competent\n\nevidence that such was caused by any assault by Bryon Noble. Again, a plaintiff can\n\nonly recover for injuries caused by the event made the basis of the suit. Texarkana\n\nMemorial Hospital, Inc. v. Murdock, supra. As previously stated, expert testimony\n\nis necessary to establish causation to medical conditions outside the common\n\nknowledge and experience of jurors. Guevara v. Ferrer, supra. Testimony regarding\n\npossibilities does not establish causation as set forth above. Duff v. Yelin, supra.\n\n      In the present case, there is no evidence demonstrating that any trauma caused\n\nany scarring/bursitis to Gayla’s hip. It was simply possible as it was possible that\n\nsuch was simply caused by repetitive activity. Therefore, if plaintiff was continuing\n\nto experience pain in the hip there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence\n\nto demonstrate that Bryon’s actions caused the same. Even if the court attributes the\n\nhip’s scar tissue to Bryon, there was not severe damage so as to support such a\n\nfinding for future pain and suffering.\n\n      Davis testified as to no treatment performed on Gayla’s legs. Bruising that had\n\nalready resolved was the only injury attributable thereto. Again, there is no material\n\n                                          33\n\fevidence that future pain in the leg would be attributable to any injury caused by\n\nBryon.\n\n      Future Mental Anguish\n\n      To support an award for future mental anguish a plaintiff must demonstrate a\n\nreasonable probability that he would suffer compensable mental anguish in the future.\n\nEven when an occurrence is of the type for which mental anguish damages are\n\nrecoverable, evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of the mental anguish are\n\nrequired. PNS Store, Inc. v. Munguia, supra. To meet the reasonable probability rule,\n\nas required to support an award for future mental anguish, a plaintiff must (1) present\n\nevidence that in reasonable probability, he will suffer damages in the future and (2)\n\nprove the probable reasonable amount of the future damages. Katy Springs &\n\nManufacturing, Inc. v. Favalora, supra. Furthermore, a plaintiff can recover only for\n\ninjuries caused by the event made the basis of the suit. Texarkana Memorial\n\nHospital, Inc. v. Murdock, supra. The amount of evidence needed to support an\n\naward for future mental anguish is extensive as demonstrated in Katy Springs &\n\nManufacturing, Inc. v. Favalora, supra.\n\n      In the Katy Springs case, supra, the plaintiff had suffered severe neck/back\n\ninjuries that required fusion surgery. The plaintiff’s doctor testified that the plaintiff\n\nwas depressed and had even cried in his office. The doctor further testified that:\n\n                                           34\n\f      “I think we need to get him, as I recommended, in physical therapy and\n      psychiatric treatment otherwise, he’s going to have a miserable future.\n      He’s already depressed; basically crying in the office. He’s told me he’s\n      been to the emergency room, not because he had an increase in his pain,\n      just he couldn’t deal with it (the pain) so tired of living with it (the pain).\n      So I think that you know, he’s going to become a long-term chronic pain\n      patient. And especially with a psychological overlay from the depression,\n      it’s not a very bright future. That’s why we need to get him into (physical)\n      therapy and get him to a psychiatrist.”\n\n      The court found that such evidence did not demonstrate a reasonable\n\nprobability that the plaintiff would suffer compensable mental anguish in the future.\n\nThe court found that the severity of the injury and the evidence of his mental pain did\n\nnot rise to the level of the severity of the evidence propounded in other personal\n\ninjury cases. The evidence that he was “very depressed” and could look forward to\n\na bleak future unless he received psychiatric treatment - were not specific evidence\n\nof the lasting nature, severity, and duration of the plaintiff’s mental anguish.\n\n      The evidence offered by Gayla fails to meet this high standard. Gayla had only\n\ngone to a counselor twice but did not bring this person to testify. She had stopped\n\nworking as a nurse because she was laid off - not fired. She was able to train for a\n\nnew career. She had been able to continue to furnish her home; keep possession of\n\nher daughter, and to date two separate people. (RR, pp. 30, 31, 35, 71-73, 92, 103).\n\nShe did not show a reasonable probability that any future mental anguish was likely\n\nto be suffered.\n\n                                          35\n\f      For the above set for reasons, the evidence was legally and/or factually\n\ninsufficient to support an award of damages for future pain and suffering and mental\n\nanguish.\n\n\n\n                                   ISSUE NO. SIX\n\n             WAS THE AWARD OF DAMAGES FOR DAMAGES FOR\n             FUTURE PAIN AND SUFFERING AND MENTAL ANGUISH\n             EXCESSIVE?\n\nArguments and Authorities\n\n      For purposes of this argument, Appellant adopts by reference the arguments\n\nand authorities previously cited as well as the standard of review set forth in Issue No.\n\nThree.\n\n      Even if the Court finds that Gayla has offered sufficient evidence to support an\n\naward of damages for future pain and suffering and mental anguish, the amount\n\nawarded must be supported by evidence that the amount is fair and reasonable.\n\nDurban v.

(RR, p. 64, 66; R.’s Exs. 3 and 4). She stated that all the bruises were gone\n\nbut that she had scars on her arms and legs. (RR, p. 65-66; 76-77). Gayla testified\n\nthat she had pictures taken the day before the trial showing these same “scars” . (RR,\n\npp. 75-77, R.’s Exs. 7 and 8) She also stated that she had a scar above her nose from\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fbeing hit with a metal wall hanging, which appears to be a slight mark. (RR, p. 68,\n\nR.’s Ex. 5; (R.’s Ex. 15; RR, p. 75).\n\n      Any scarring suffered by Gayla seems minimal. These slight marks do not\n\nimpair Gayla Noble’s appearance so as to rise to the level of compensable\n\ndisfigurement. The evidence does not legally and/or factually support an award of\n\ndamages for disfigurement in the past.\n\n      As to any future disfigurement, Gayla acknowledged that all bruising was gone.\n\n(RR, pp. 65-66). She testified that she was embarrassed by the scars but frequently\n\nwears shorts. She could not state that the scarring was keeping her from doing\n\nanything. (RR, p. 78). Only “everything” kept her from doing anything. (RR, p. 78).\n\nThe evidence does not legally and/or factually support an award of damages for\n\ndisfigurement in the future.\n\n      As support for this position, see Pendergraft v. Carillo, supra. In Pendergraft,\n\nthe plaintiff was working in a stone quarry when he was struck in the face by an air\n\ncompressor hose. He sustained a non-displaced fracture of his jaw and a 2.5\n\ncentimeter laceration below his lip. Doctors secured a plate to the plaintiff’s jaw, and\n\nhe experienced tooth pain and expressed a desire to have several teeth removed.\n\nNevertheless, the court stated there was no evidence that the plaintiff had scarring or\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\fany other type of disfigurement, and therefore there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the trial court’s finding that the plaintiff suffered disfigurement.\n\n         For the above set forth reasons, the evidence is legally and/or factually\n\ninsufficient to support the award of damages for past and/or future disfigurement.\n\n\n\n                                 ISSUE NO.

The\n\nevidence presented is simply factually insufficient to support such an award whether\n\nfor past and/or future disfigurement. While each case must be judged on its own\n\nfacts, it is proper to consider other approved awards in similar cases to determine if\n\na damage award is excessive. Sunbridge Health Care Corp. v. Penny, supra.\n\n      In this regard, Bryon would ask the Court to consider the amount of damages\n\nawarded in cases with much more extensive evidence of disfigurement as follows:\n\n\n                                          40\n\f       In Figueroa v. Davis, supra, the plaintiff was struck by another driver who ran\n\na stop sign. The plaintiff’s front teeth crumbled out of his mouth, leaving only small\n\npieces at his gumline that were not pulled until almost five years later and were still\n\nmissing at the time of trial. The jury awarded $10,000.00 for past disfigurement.\n\n       In Smith v.

She further needed surgery to remove glass fragments\n\nthat remained embedded in her forehead. The trial court awarded $5,000.00 for past\n\ndisfigurement.\n\n       These cases demonstrate more severe disfigurement than that demonstrated by\n\nGayla with a far lesser amount awarded therein. Again, the court’s award was\n\nintended to punish Bryon as opposed to compensating Gayla Noble.\n\n       For the above set for reasons, this award of damages should be reversed and\n\nrendered and/or reversed and remanded for a new trial and/or the Court should order\n\na remittitur.\n\n                                  ISSUE NO.

Davis testified it was apparent that Gayla had suffered some\n\ntype of trauma to her neck. (RR, p. 111). He said she had some scar tissue built up\n\nin her right hip bursa area. (RR, p. 111). He said that it could have been caused by\n\ntrauma or by repetitive stress. (RR, p. 112). He could not pinpoint that on anything.\n\n(RR, p. 112). He, therefore, did not opine that any hip injury was the result of trauma.\n\n      An analogous situation was presented in Guevara v. Ferrer, supra. There an\n\n86 year old man was involved in a car accident. He was hospitalized following the\n\naccident. The only medical evidence offered was a medical record that the plaintiff\n\nhad been in an automobile accident in which he sustained multiple orthopedic injuries\n\nand had developed bacteria and respiratory distress. The medical records also noted\n\nother serious health issues which the plaintiff had suffered in the past. He was\n\nawarded over $1,000,000.00 in medical expenses. No doctor actually testified but\n\n                                          42\n\frather the plaintiff’s family members testified that the accident had caused all of his\n\ninjuries.\n\n       The Supreme Court found that while some injury could be established by the\n\nevidence, all the injuries for which plaintiff had been treated were not established by\n\ncompetent expert testimony and remanded the case for remittitur.\n\n       Here, the evidence does not show that all treatment provided to Gayla Noble\n\nresulted from any assault but could have also arisen from repetitive activity, such as\n\na nurse would perform.\n\n       Secondly, even if the Court finds that the chiropractic expenses were\n\nreasonably and necessarily caused by Bryon’s conduct, the evidence is insufficient\n\nto support the amount of medical expenses awarded by the court. Tim Davis testified\n\nthat he had charged $300.00 - $400.00 for treating Gayla. (RR, p. 115). His\n\nchiropractic charges were reflected on Exhibit 16. (RR, p. 116; R’s Ex. 16). The\n\nchart reflected charges of $407.00. There is no evidence to support an award of\n\n$600.00. For such reason, the Court should reverse the judgment and remand the case\n\nfor a new trial. In cases where there is evidence to support some damages but no\n\nevidence to support the amount awarded, the court may remand or do a remittitur.\n\nGuevara v.

She further testified that he said that he loved this\n\nmore than anything else in his world and that this should show her how serious he\n\nwas. (RR, p. 87).\n\n      Her attorney then stated:\n\n             Q.     And he made a gift of it to you. That was your conclusion from\n                    what he said?\n\n             Y.

(RR, pp. 87-88).\n\nGayla Noble had in fact pawned the watch. (RR, pp. 89-90).

(RR, p. 90).\n\n      Neither Gayla’s actions nor Bryon’s actions evidence the intent to make a gift.\n\nCircumstantially, a man’s Rolex watch would seem an unusual gift for a woman.\n\nPawning a “pricey” watch to keep it from being stolen or lost would seem to be more\n\nin line with someone trying to hide or secret the same which would seem hardly\n\nnecessary if the person in possession is the owner.\n\n      Gayla may have had possession of the watch but donative intent was not\n\nestablished.
