The Walgreen Co., et al., in the 419th Judicial\n\nDistrict Court of Travis County, Texas, before the Honorable Visiting Judge Gus J.\n\nStrauss.\n\f                          STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n      Appellee Nancy Jo Rodriguez (“Appellee”) filed a health care liability claim\n\nagainst several defendants, including Appellants, based on Appellee’s taking of a\n\nmedication known as Pradaxa. (CR 4–12). With her petition, Appellee served a\n\nreport authored by Jeffrey A. Breall, M.D., Ph.D. (“Dr. Breall”). (CR 43–44).\n\nAppellants objected to Dr. Breall’s report shortly thereafter. (CR 119–52). Over\n\nthe next three months, Appellee did not serve any new or amended reports. After\n\nthe expiration of the statutory deadline to serve expert reports under Chapter 74,\n\nAppellants moved to dismiss Appellee’s claim. (CR 189–95). However, the trial\n\ncourt entered an order finding that Dr. Breall’s report was adequate and denying\n\nAppellants’ motion to dismiss. (CR 344–45, 365–66). Appellants subsequently\n\nfiled this interlocutory appeal from that order. (CR 346–50).\n\n                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      1.     Whether the trial court abused its discretion when holding Dr. Breall’s\n\nreport was adequate under Chapter 74 despite Dr. Breall only offering conclusory\n\nopinions that did not link the facts to his conclusions.\n\n      2.     Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Appellants’\n\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to section 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practices and\n\nRemedies Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      In 2012, Appellee was a patient of Austin Heart, PLLC (“Austin Heart”)\n\nwhere she received treatment for an abnormal sinus rhythm in her heart. (CR 6).\n\nAs a patient of Austin Heart, Appellee was treated by David Kessler, M.D. (“Dr.\n\nKessler”) and Vivek Goswami, M.D. (“Dr. Goswami”), both of whom are\n\ncardiologists. (Id.). In her petition, Appellee states that, on March 27, 2012, Dr.\n\nKessler “orders that [Appellee] stop her use of the drug Pradaxa because she is\n\nmaintaining her sinus rhythm without it.” (Id.). However, Appellee alleges “this\n\norder to stop the medication was not followed by Dr. Goswami.” (Id.). Appellee\n\nnonetheless admits she continued to refill her prescription for Pradaxa despite Dr.\n\nKessler’s order to stop. (Id.). Appellee claims her continued use of Pradaxa caused\n\nher hospitalization on July 2, 2012. (Id.).\n\n      On March 26, 2014, Appellee filed suit against The Walgreen Company,\n\nSara E. McGuire, St. David’s Health Care Partnership, Austin Heart, Dr. Kessler,\n\nand Dr. Goswami (collectively “Defendants”). (CR 4–5). With her petition,\n\nAppellee served Defendants with a curriculum vitae and report from Jeffrey Chad\n\nHardy, Pharm.D., M.S. dated February 21, 2014 (“Hardy’s report”) and a\n\ncurriculum vitae and report from Jeffrey A. Breall, M.D., Ph.D. dated March 18,\n\n2014 (“Dr. Breall’s report”). (CR 13–44). There is no dispute that Hardy’s report\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fdoes not apply to Appellants. Rather, only Dr. Breall’s report references\n\nAppellants.\n\n        As addressed more fully below, Dr. Breall’s report fails to provide any facts\n\nsurrounding the care and treatment provided by Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart. (CR\n\n43–44). In fact, Dr. Breall’s report fails to even identify which medical records he\n\nreviewed to support the opinions in his report. (Id.). If Dr. Breall provided the facts\n\nfrom the relevant records, Dr. Breall’s report would have informed the trial court\n\nthat, prior to Dr. Kessler’s order to stop taking Pradaxa on March 27, 2012,\n\nAppellee already had a prescription for Pradaxa allowing for five refills. (CR 330–\n\n31). Specifically, Appellee was prescribed Pradaxa on February 10, 2012, and she\n\nfilled the prescription on February 14, 2012. (CR 330). On March 16, 2012,\n\nWalgreen’s requested five refills of Pradaxa. (CR 331). On March 27, 2012, Dr.\n\nKessler ordered Appellee to stop taking the Pradaxa. (CR 6). Yet, on May 4, 2012,\n\nAppellee refilled her prescription using the authority provided to Walgreen’s on\n\nMarch 16, 2012. (CR 332).1 On June 16, 2012, Appellee again refilled her\n\nprescription using the authority provided to Walgreen’s on March 16, 2012. (CR\n\n333).\n\n        A review of these records would have also informed the trial court that\n\nAppellee used this prescription that pre-dated Dr. Kessler’s order to obtain refills\n\n1\n  This Audit / Board of Pharmacy Inspection Report shows the “Original Date” for the\nprescription was 3/16/2012 16:04. (Id.).\n\n                                          4\n\fafter Dr. Kessler’s March 27, 2012 order without any communication with Dr.\n\nGoswami or Austin Heart. (CR 332–33). Rather than provide these facts from the\n\nrecords, Dr. Breall chose not to provide any facts.\n\n       On May 12, 2014, Appellants objected to Dr. Breall’s report. (CR 119–27).\n\nIn their objections, Appellants specified that Dr. Breall failed to identify the\n\nstandard of care applicable to each Appellant, failed to identify the alleged acts or\n\nomissions by each Appellant that amounted to a breach in the standard of care, and\n\nfailed to explain the causal relationship between each alleged breach and the\n\ninjuries alleged. (Id.). Despite having knowledge of these objections since May 12,\n\n2014, Appellee failed to amend or supplement Dr. Breall’s report over the next\n\nthree months.\n\n       After the deadline for serving expert reports expired on August 19, 2014,\n\nAppellants filed their motion to dismiss. (CR 189–99).2 On October 20, 2014,\n\nAppellee filed her response to Appellants’ motion to dismiss arguing that Dr.\n\nBreall’s report was sufficient and even moved for sanctions. (CR 297–306). On\n\nOctober 29, 2014, the trial court held a hearing on Appellants’ motion to dismiss.\n\n(RR 1–48).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Since Dr. Breall’s report offered no criticisms of Dr. Kessler, Dr. Kessler also filed a motion to\ndismiss. (CR 171–80). Rather than face a hearing on Dr. Kessler’s motion to dismiss and motion\nfor attorneys’ fees, Appellee non-suited Dr. Kessler. (CR 200–02).\n\n                                                 5\n\f      On October 30, 2014, the Honorable Visiting Judge Gus J. Strauss issued a\n\nletter opinion finding “that the report of Dr. Breall pertaining to Dr. Goswami and\n\nAustin Heart is adequate under [Chapter] 74 and the plaintiff’s claims will proceed.\n\nNo sanctions [or] attorney’s fees will be ordered.” (Appx. A; CR 344–45). In this\n\nsame order, the trial court granted Walgreen’s and Sarah E. McGuire’s motion to\n\ndismiss. (Id.). On December 4, 2014, the trial court signed a more formal order\n\ndenying Appellants’ motion to dismiss under section 74.351 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code. (Appx. A; CR 365–66). On November 17, 2014,\n\nAppellants timed filed their notice of appeal and this interlocutory appeal ensued.\n\n(CR 346–52).\n\n                      SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in holding that Dr. Breall’s report was\n\nadequate under Chapter 74 and in denying Appellants’ motion to dismiss under\n\nChapter 74. In his report, Dr. Breall fails to provide any of the facts surrounding\n\nAppellee’s care and treatment in this case, and Dr. Breall makes no attempt to link\n\nthe facts to his conclusions on the elements of a Chapter 74 expert report. The\n\nTexas Supreme Court holds that, when a report lacks any explanation linking the\n\nexpert’s conclusion to the relevant facts, a trial court abuses its discretion if it\n\ndenies the defendant’s motion to dismiss. Additionally, Dr. Breall failed to identify\n\nthe standard of care applicable to each Appellant, failed to explain how each\n\n\n                                         6\n\fAppellant breached the standard of care, and failed to explain the causal link\n\nbetween each Appellant’s alleged breach and the injuries alleged. Accordingly, Dr.\n\nBreall’s report did not constitute a good faith effort to comply with the\n\nrequirements of section 74.351, and the trial court erred in denying Appellants’\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n                          ARGUMENT & AUTHORITY\n\nI.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      A trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with\n\nsection 74.351(b) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code is subject to\n\nreview for abuse of discretion. American Transitional Care Ctrs. of Tex., Inc. v.\n\nPalacios, 46 S.W.3d 873, 875 (Tex. 2001). However, if an expert report contains\n\nonly conclusions about the statutory elements in section 74.351, the trial court has\n\n“no discretion but to conclude ... that the report does not represent a good-faith\n\neffort” to satisfy the statute. Smith v. Wilson, 368 S.W.3d 574, 577 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2012, no pet.) (citing Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 877, 880). Also, an incorrect\n\nconstruction of the law or a misapplication of the law to undisputed facts is an\n\nabuse of discretion. See Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992);\n\nHarris County Hosp. Dist. v. Garrett, 232 S.W.3d 170, 176 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fII.   THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN FINDING DR.\n      BREALL’S REPORT SATISFIED THE REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER 74 AND\n      DENYING APPELLANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS.\n\n      A.     Legislative Intent Of Chapter 74.\n\n      The Legislature enacted Article 4590i (now codified in Chapter 74),\n\nincluding its expert reporting requirement, for the purpose of deterring frivolous\n\nlawsuits against health care providers. TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 4590i;\n\nPalacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879 (citing Wood v. Tice, 988 S.W.2d 829, 830 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 1999, pet. denied)). “The Legislature has determined that\n\nfailing to timely file an expert report, or filing a report that does not evidence a\n\ngood-faith effort to comply with the definition of an expert report, means that the\n\nclaim is either frivolous, or at best has been brought prematurely. This is exactly\n\nthe type of conduct for which sanctions are appropriate.” Bogar v. Esparza, 257\n\nS.W.3d 354, 371 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, no pet.).\n\n      As evidenced by this case, the purpose of deterring frivolous lawsuits is\n\neffectively negated when a claimant serves an expert report that conceals the facts\n\nsurrounding the care in question and only provides vague conclusions on certain\n\nelements of a Chapter 74 expert report. Appellee should not be entitled to pursue a\n\nfrivolous (or at best premature) claim by serving such a report.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      B.     Chapter 74’s Expert Report Requirements.\n\n      Chapter 74 requires that, when a plaintiff asserts a health care liability claim,\n\nshe must serve each defendant physician and health care provider with an expert\n\nreport along with the expert’s curriculum vitae within 120 days of filing suit. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 74.351(a)-(c). Chapter 74 further provides that a\n\nfailure to serve a report within 120 days mandates that the trial court dismiss the\n\ncase and award attorneys’ fees and costs. Id at § 74.351(b).\n\n      In order to comply with Chapter 74, an expert report must represent an\n\nobjective good faith effort to comply with the definition of an expert report under\n\nChapter 74. TEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE § 74.351(l). The good faith effort standard\n\nrequires the report to provide an adequate analysis for each of the following\n\nelements of a health care liability claim: (1) the applicable standard of care; (2) the\n\nmanner in which the care rendered by the physician or health care provider failed\n\nto meet the standard; and (3) the causal relationship between that failure and the\n\ninjury, harm or damages claimed. Id. at § 74.351(r)(6); Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court holds that a report will not constitute a good faith effort\n\nif it omits any of these statutory requirements. Jernigan v. Langley, 195 S.W.3d 91,\n\n94 (Tex. 2006). Further, in order to constitute a good faith effort, the report must,\n\nat a minimum: (1) inform the defendant of the specific conduct called into\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fquestion; and (2) provide a basis for the trial court to conclude the claims have\n\nmerit. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court also holds that, while a report need not marshal\n\nall of the plaintiff’s proof, it must include the expert’s opinion on each of the\n\nelements identified in section 74.351. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 878. A report cannot\n\nmerely state the expert’s conclusions about the statutory elements. Id. at 879.\n\n“Rather, the expert must explain the basis of his statements to link his conclusions\n\nto the facts.” Bowie Mem’l Hosp. v. Wright, 79 S.W.3d 48, 52 (Tex. 2002) (quoting\n\nEarle v. Ratliff, 998 S.W.2d 882, 890 (Tex. 1999)). It is not enough that the expert\n\nreport provides “insight” about the plaintiff’s claims. Id. “A report that merely\n\nstates the expert’s conclusions about the standard or care, breach, and causation\n\ndoes not fulfill the two purposes of a good-faith effort.” Hebert v. Hopkins, 395\n\nS.W.3d 884, 890 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, no pet.) (quoting Jelinek, 328 S.W.3d\n\nat 539).\n\n      Importantly, the only information relevant to determining whether a report\n\ncomplies with the statute is “within the four corners of the document.” Palacios, 46\n\nS.W.3d at 878. “This requirement precludes a court from filling gaps in a report by\n\ndrawing inferences or guessing as to what the expert likely meant or intended.”\n\nAustin Heart, P.A. v. Webb, 228 S.W.3d 276, 279 (Tex. App.—Austin 2007, no\n\npet.) (citing Bowie Mem’l, 79 S.W.3d at 53; Gray v. CHCA Bayshore L.P., 189\n\n\n                                        10\n\fS.W.3d 855, 859 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.)). As this Court\n\nrecognized, “neither the trial court nor this Court may infer additional opinions or\n\nunderlying facts to fill in gaps that the report itself leaves open.” Hebert, 395\n\nS.W.3d at 890.\n\n      C.    Dr. Breall’s Report Does Not Constitute A Good Faith Effort to\n            Comply With Section 74.351.\n\n      For ease of reference, Appellants provide below the paragraphs from Dr.\n\nBreall’s report containing his opinions in this case. These paragraphs are the only\n\nones from Dr. Breall’s report addressing Appellants:\n\n      In my opinion the care and treatment provided to Nancy Jo Rodriguez\n      by Austin Heart fell below the accepted standards of care in the\n      following particulars:\n\n      Despite Dr. David Kessler, one of her cardiologists from Austin\n      Heart, requesting that the Pradaxa be discontinued (in this patient\n      who, at best, has bipolar disorder and at times was confused, this was\n      a reasonable request), Pradaxa therapy nevertheless was continued\n      after her acute hospitalization. This request to stop the medication was\n      not appreciated by her primary cardiologist, Dr. Vivek Goswami (who\n      was in the same group as Dr. Kessler). Furthermore, Ms. Rodriguez\n      appeared to be obtaining refills for this medication authorized by\n      nurses and staff of this same heart group who recommended\n      discontinuing this medication (Austin Heart). The standard of care\n      would have been to follow the orders of Dr. Kessler to stop the\n      administration of Pradaxa.\n\n      Failure to discontinue the use of Pradaxa was a direct cause of her\n      subsequent acute admission to the hospital with hypotension, acute\n      kidney injury and apparent gastrointestinal bleeding – known side\n      effects of the over-use of Pradaxa. Ms. Rodriquez’s entire\n      hospitalization was attributable to the failure to stop Pradaxa therapy\n      as ordered by Dr. Kessler. More likely than not, had the Pradaxa\n\n                                        11\n\f      medication been discontinued as requested, Ms. Rodriguez’s\n      hospitalization would never have needed to take place.\n\n      I hold these opinions to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\n      They are based upon my education, training and experience as well as\n      the records which I have reviewed.\n\n(CR 43–44). As explained herein, the report fails to satisfy any of the elements of a\n\nChapter 74 expert report as to Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart and does not\n\nconstitute an expert report under Chapter 74.\n\n             1.     Dr. Breall’s report provides no facts to support his\n                    conclusions and thus does not constitute an expert report\n                    under Chapter 74.\n\n      Before addressing Dr. Breall’s specific failures to satisfy the statutory\n\nelements of a Chapter 74 expert report, it is important to note that Dr. Breall’s\n\nreport provides absolutely no factual background regarding the care and treatment\n\nin question. (CR 43–44). In fact, Dr. Breall’s report fails to even identify which\n\nrecords he reviewed to support the opinions in his report. (Id.). It is well\n\nestablished that an expert must link his conclusions to the facts in order satisfy\n\nChapter 74’s expert report requirement. Most recently, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nheld in Jelinek v. Casas, 328 S.W.3d 526 (Tex. 2010), when the report in question\n\nlacked any explanation linking the expert’s conclusion to the relevant facts, the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to dismiss and\n\nthe court of appeals erred by affirming that ruling. Id. at 540 (citing Bowie Mem’l,\n\n79 S.W.3d at 52).\n\n                                         12\n\f      Several Texas appellate courts have reached the same conclusion. The\n\nappellate courts recognize that an expert’s failure to provide any facts to support\n\nhis or her conclusions on standard of care, breach, and causation prevents the trial\n\ncourt from concluding the plaintiff’s claims have merit. See Taylor v. Fossett, 320\n\nS.W.3d 570, 578 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.) (finding trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying physician’s motion to dismiss since expert report provided\n\nonly conclusory opinions without supporting facts); W.B.M. Mgmt. Co. v. Flores,\n\nNo. 07-14-00008-CV, 2014 WL 1691362, *5–6 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Apr. 25,\n\n2014, no pet.) (holding that expert report was not a good faith effort to provide a\n\nfair summary of his opinions and warranted dismissal since expert failed to provide\n\nfacts to support his conclusion); Shenoy v. Jean, No. 01-10-01116-CV, 2011 WL\n\n6938538, *6 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Dec. 29, 2011, pet. denied) (holding\n\nthat “an expert report that merely asserts that a defendant physician’s breach\n\ncaused the plaintiff’s injury without providing a factual basis does not provide the\n\ntrial court with the information necessary to evaluate the merits of the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim.”).\n\n      The failure to set forth facts supporting an expert’s opinions on the standard\n\nof care, breach, and causation is not an argument based on “semantics.”\n\nKuykendall v. Dragun, No. 11-05-00230-CV, 2006 WL 728068, *3 (Tex. App.—\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fEastland Mar. 23, 2006, pet. denied). Rather, the facts are “vital” in determining\n\nwhether the plaintiff’s claims have merit. Id.\n\n      For instance, in Kuykendall v. Dragun, the expert’s report stated that the\n\nplaintiff suffered peripheral nerve damage in a surgery performed by several\n\nphysicians and indicated that the literature provided this type of injury was\n\ntypically caused by failure to properly pad self-retaining retractors, improperly\n\npositioning the patient, or leaning on the patient. Id. The expert then opined that\n\nthese were the most likely causes of the plaintiff’s injuries. However, the report\n\nfailed to identify any facts supporting the conclusion. The report did not state the\n\ndefendant physician used a self-retaining retractor during the procedure, and the\n\nreport did not even identify the types of procedures carried out by the defendant\n\nphysician. The court of appeals held that the expert’s failure to link these facts to\n\nhis conclusions justified the trial court’s dismissal under Chapter 74. Id. In\n\nreaching this conclusion, the trial court found the need for this specific information\n\nin the report is not mere “semantics.” Id. Rather, this information is “vital” when\n\nassessing whether the defendant breached the standard of care. Id.\n\n      Similarly, Dr. Breall leaves out key facts supporting his conclusions. In fact,\n\nDr. Breall leaves out any facts concerning Appellee’s care and treatment.\n\nAppellee’s malpractice action is based on her continued use of Pradaxa after her\n\ntreating cardiologist, Dr. Kessler, ordered her to stop taking this medication (CR\n\n\n                                         14\n\f6). Yet, Dr. Breall’s report provides absolutely no facts about Dr. Kessler’s order\n\nto stop Pradaxa; the date of the order; to whom the order was communicated;\n\nwhether Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart treated, or even had contact with, Appellee\n\nafter Dr. Kessler’s order; the prescription used by Appellee after Dr. Kessler’s\n\norder to stop; the circumstances in which Appellee continued to refill her\n\nprescription and continued to use Pradaxa; and many other relevant facts. Rather,\n\nDr. Breall simply offers conclusory opinions about the standard of care, breach,\n\nand causation.\n\n       It is evident Dr. Breall chose not to include relevant facts since they\n\nobviously did not support the opinions in his report. After all, the medical records\n\nreflect there was no interaction between Appellants and Appellee after Dr.\n\nKessler’s order to stop taking Pradaxa, and Appellee continued to use a\n\nprescription with five remaining refills that pre-dated Dr. Kessler’s order to stop\n\ntaking Pradaxa. Dr. Breall’s report is silent on these facts (or any facts for that\n\nmatter) because they do not support his conclusions.3 Since Dr. Breall failed to\n\nprovide any facts to support his conclusions, his report did not constitute a good\n\nfaith effort to comply with section 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practices and\n\nRemedies Code. Given the lack of facts to support Dr. Breall’s conclusion, the trial\n\n\n3\n  Appellants include these facts not for purposes of determining the sufficiency of Dr. Breall’s\nreport but to illustrate why an expert is required to provide factual support so the trial court may\nassess whether the plaintiff’s claims have merit.\n\n                                                15\n\fcourt abused its discretion in finding the report was sufficient. See Smith, 368\n\nS.W.3d at 577.4 As a result, Appellants request that the Court reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s order.\n\n               2.      Dr. Breall fails to identify the standard of care applicable to\n                       Appellants.\n\n       In addition to Dr. Breall’s general failure to provide any facts supporting his\n\nconclusions, Dr. Breall also failed to make a good faith effort to comply with\n\nsection 74.351’s requirements. In his report, Dr. Breall fails to identify the standard\n\nof care applicable to Appellants. The standard of care for a health care provider or\n\na physician is what an ordinarily prudent health care provider or physician would\n\ndo under the same or similar circumstances. See Strom v. Mem’l Hermann Hosp.\n\nSys., 110 S.W.3d 216, 222 (Tex. App—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).\n\nIdentifying the standard of care is “critical” because “[w]hether a defendant\n\nbreached his or her duty to a patient cannot be determined absent specific\n\ninformation about what the defendant should have done differently.” Palacios, 46\n\nS.W.3d at 880. From Dr. Breall’s report, Appellants cannot determine what,\n\nspecifically, they should have done differently in their care and treatment of\n\nAppellee.\n\n\n4\n   Also, without the relevant facts, the trial court either misapplied the law regarding the\nsufficiency of expert reports or inferred additional underlying facts to fill in gaps that the report\nitself left open. This amounts to an abuse of discretion. See Garrett, 232 S.W.3d at 176; Hebert,\n395 S.W.3d at 890.\n\n                                                16\n\f      As explained above, a good faith report must, at a very minimum: (1) inform\n\nthe defendant of the specific conduct called into question; and (2) provide a basis\n\nfor the trial court to conclude the claims have merit. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879. A\n\nreport cannot merely state the expert’s conclusions about the statutory elements. Id.\n\nat 879. “Rather, the expert must explain the basis of his statements to link his\n\nconclusions to the facts.” Bowie Mem’l, 79 S.W.3d at 52. As this Court recognizes,\n\n“[a] report that merely states the expert’s conclusions about the standard or care,\n\nbreach, and causation does not fulfill the two purposes of a good-faith effort.”\n\nHebert, 395 S.W.3d at 890.\n\n      In his report, Dr. Breall’s provides only a single, conclusory statement\n\nsetting forth his opinion on the standard of care: “The standard of care would have\n\nbeen to follow the orders of Dr. Kessler to stop the administration of Pradaxa.”\n\n(CR 44). However, Dr. Breall fails to identify the standard of care applicable to\n\nAppellants given the factual circumstances of this case. As provided above, Dr.\n\nBreall fails to set forth any facts indicating that Dr. Kessler’s order was\n\ncommunicated to anyone except Appellee. (Recall, Appellee admits that Dr.\n\nKessler “orders that Nancy stop her use of the drug Pradaxa”). (CR 6). In fact, Dr.\n\nBreall’s own report suggests Dr. Kessler did not communicate his order to Dr.\n\nGoswami by stating Dr. Goswami failed to appreciate the order. (CR 44). Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fBreall’s report fails to explain the standard of care when an order to stop a\n\nmedication is not communicated to other physicians and health care providers.\n\n      Moreover, since Dr. Breall failed to describe the factual circumstances\n\nsurrounding the prescription and administration of Pradaxa, he could not have\n\nidentified the applicable standard of care in this case. After all, the standard of care\n\nfor a health care provider or physician is what an ordinarily prudent health care\n\nprovider or physician “would have done under the same or similar circumstances.”\n\nSee Strom, 110 S.W.3d at 222. Since Dr. Breall did not contemplate the\n\ncircumstances surrounding this case, he could not have identified the standard of\n\ncare applicable to Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart.\n\n      Also, Dr. Breall’s report fails to attribute his standard of care opinion to any\n\nparticular defendant. “When a plaintiff sues more than one defendant, the expert\n\nreport must set forth the standard of care applicable to each defendant and explain\n\nthe causal relationship between each defendant’s individual acts and the injury.”\n\nTenet Hosps. Ltd. v. De La Riva, 351 S.W.3d 398, 404 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011,\n\nno pet.); see also CHCA Mainland, L.P. v. Burkhalter, 227 S.W.3d 221, 227 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.). An expert report may not assert that\n\nmultiple defendants are all negligent for failing to meet the standard of care\n\nwithout providing an explanation of how each defendant breached the standard of\n\ncare and how that breach caused or contributed to the cause of injury. Taylor v.\n\n\n                                          18\n\fChristus Spohn Health Sys. Corp., 169 S.W.3d 241, 244 (Tex. App.—Corpus\n\nChristi 2004, no pet.). “Collective assertions of negligence against various\n\ndefendants are inadequate.” Id.\n\n      In this case, Appellee filed suit against multiple defendants. Dr. Breall’s\n\nreport mentions three defendants, Dr. Kessler, Dr. Goswami, and Austin Heart.\n\nHowever, Dr. Breall made no attempt to explain the standard of care applicable to\n\neach defendant. Rather, Dr. Breall only provides one standard of care opinion and\n\nfails to explain to whom it applies. Dr. Breall’s collective statement is prohibited\n\nby Chapter 74 and Texas case law. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 74.351(a);\n\nTaylor, 169 S.W.3d at 244. Dr. Breall’s report effectively provides no standard of\n\ncare opinion with regard to Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart, and therefore, the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying Appellants’ motion to dismiss.\n\n            3.     Dr. Breall fails to explain how Dr. Goswami and Austin\n                   Heart breached the applicable standard of care.\n\n      Dr. Breall’s report also fails to explain how Dr. Goswami and Austin Heart\n\nallegedly breached their respective standards of care. Dr. Breall’s only stated\n\ncriticism against Dr. Goswami was that the order to stop Pradaxa “was not\n\nappreciated by her primary cardiologist, Dr. Vivek Goswami (who was in the same\n\ngroup as Dr. Kessler).” (CR 44). However, Dr. Breall does not define this alleged\n\n“failure to appreciate” as a breach of the applicable standard of care. In fact, Dr.\n\nBreall does not identify the standard of care for appreciating another physician’s\n\n                                        19\n\forder. Hence, Dr. Breall effectively provides no opinion that Dr. Breall breached\n\nthe standard of care.\n\n      Also, Dr. Breall does not explain how Dr. Goswami could have\n\n“appreciated” Dr. Kessler’s order. Once again, Dr. Breall leaves out necessary and\n\nvital facts to support this opinion. At no point does Dr. Breall’s report state that Dr.\n\nKessler communicated his March 27, 2012 order to Dr. Goswami. Rather,\n\nAppellee admits this order to stop taking Pradaxa was communicated to her. (CR\n\n6). Dr. Breall’s report again fails to link his conclusions to the facts in the case.\n\n      Moreover, Dr. Breall fails to explain what Dr. Goswami should have done\n\ndifferently had he been apprised of the order by another treating cardiologist.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Breall fails to explain what else Dr. Goswami should have done\n\nother than what Appellee admits Dr. Kessler did, which is to tell Appellee to stop\n\ntaking the Pradaxa. Dr. Breall’s report certainly does not state that Dr. Goswami\n\ncontinued to prescribe Pradaxa after Dr. Kessler’s order.\n\n      Again, Dr. Breall’s decision not to include supporting facts is not surprising\n\ngiven that the facts reveal that Appellee continued to refill a Pradaxa prescription\n\nthat predated Dr. Kessler’s March 27, 2012 order without any notice to Dr.\n\nGoswami. The report certainly does not explain how the facts establish Dr.\n\nGoswami breached the standard of care. As explained in Section II(C)(1) above,\n\nDr. Breall’s failure to provide facts to support his opinion mandates dismissal.\n\n\n                                           20\n\fJelinek, 328 S.W.3d at 540; Taylor, 320 S.W.3d at 578; Flores, 2014 WL 1691362,\n\n*5–6. Dr. Breall’s report fails to provide any statement that Dr. Goswami breached\n\nthe applicable standard of care.\n\n       In regard to Austin Heart, Dr. Breall states Appellee “appeared to be\n\nobtaining refills for this medication authorized by nurses and staff of this same\n\nheart group who recommended discontinuing this medication (Austin Heart).” (CR\n\n44). However, this conclusory statement is a careful and calculated attempt to\n\nmischaracterize the facts by excluding vital information. In this statement, Dr.\n\nBreall noticeably fails to indicate the date in which Pradaxa refills were\n\n“authorized by nurses and staff” of Austin Heart. If Austin Heart’s nurses and staff\n\nauthorized the refills before Dr. Kessler ordered Appellee to stop taking the\n\nmedication, there could not have been a breach. Dr. Breall noticeably omits the\n\ndate in which Austin Heart employees allegedly authorized refills of Pradaxa.5\n\n       Without this vital information, the trial court could not have determined\n\nwhether Appellee’s claims have merit. Rather, in order to conclude the report was\n\nsufficient as to Austin Heart, the trial court needed to draw an inference that Austin\n\nHeart employees authorized refills of Pradaxa after Dr. Kessler’s March 27, 2012\n\n5\n Per Appellee’s Original Petition, Dr. Kessler ordered Appellee to stop taking Pradaxa on March\n27, 2012. (CR 6). The pharmacy records show that Appellee’s refill request was completed on\nMarch 16, 2012, eleven days before Dr. Kessler’s order. (CR 331). Appellee then used the\nprescription and refill requests, which predated Dr. Kessler’s order, to refill her Pradaxa on two\nseparate occasions. (CR 332–33). Again, Appellants include this information not for purposes of\ndetermining the sufficiency of the report but to illustrate why the underlying facts are important\nwhen analyzing an expert’s opinions.\n\n                                               21\n\forder. Yet, those facts are not provided in Dr. Breall’s report (most likely because\n\nthey are not the facts supported by the records or the witnesses in this case), and\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion in inferring these facts to find the report was\n\nsufficient.\n\n       Also, Dr. Breall’s supposed breach opinion again does not match a\n\ncorresponding standard of care opinion. Nowhere in Dr. Breall’s report does he\n\nprovide the standard of care for nurses and staff members who receive a request to\n\nauthorize prescription refills. (CR 43–44). Therefore, Dr. Breall’s breach statement\n\nis wholly insufficient to satisfy Chapter 74. In sum, Dr. Breall does not provide any\n\nstatement showing that Austin Heart’s nurses or staff breached the standard of\n\ncare, and the trial court abused its discretion in finding that Dr. Breall’s report was\n\nsufficient as to Austin Heart.\n\n              4.    Dr. Breall’s report fails to explain how an alleged breach in\n                    the standard of care by Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart\n                    caused Appellee’s injuries.\n\n       Dr. Breall’s report completely fails to explain how an alleged breach in the\n\nstandard of care by Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart caused Appellee’s injuries. As\n\nthe Supreme Court has recognized, “[a]n expert cannot simply opine that the\n\nbreach caused the injury. … Instead, the expert must go further and explain, to a\n\nreasonable degree, how and why the breach caused the injury based on the facts\n\npresented.” Jelinek, 328 S.W.3d at 539–40. Without this explanation, the trial court\n\n\n                                          22\n\fcannot conclude the claims have merit. Id.; see also Smith, 368 S.W.3d at 578\n\n(Austin Court reversing trial court’s denial of motion to dismiss after finding report\n\nfailed to provide facts explaining the causal link between alleged breach and the\n\noccurrence or injury); Kocurek v. Colby, No. 03-13-00057-CV, 2014 WL 4179454,\n\n*4–5 (Tex. App.—Austin Aug. 22, 2014, no pet.). Here, Dr. Breall’s report fails to\n\nestablish a causal link between an alleged breach in the standard of care by\n\nAppellants and Appellee’s alleged injuries.\n\n      In regard to Dr. Goswami, Dr. Breall’s report only complains that Dr.\n\nKessler’s order to stop the medication was not “appreciated” by Dr. Goswami.\n\nHowever, as explained above, Dr. Breall fails to explain how Dr. Goswami’s lack\n\nof knowledge of Dr. Kessler’s order to stop taking Pradaxa caused Appellee to\n\ncontinue to take Pradaxa. Dr. Breall’s report does not provide any facts indicating\n\nthat Dr. Goswami knew of Dr. Kessler’s order or that, after Dr. Kessler ordered\n\nAppellee to stop taking Pradaxa, Dr. Goswami had any further contact with\n\nAppellee before her alleged injuries. Moreover, one would expect Appellee to\n\nfollow the order of her treating cardiologist (Dr. Kessler) without needing a second\n\ncardiologist (Dr. Goswami) to repeat the order. In short, Dr. Breall fails to explain\n\nhow any act or omission by Dr. Goswami led Appellee to continue to take Pradaxa.\n\n      In regard to Austin Heart, Dr. Breall’s only breach statement was that\n\nAppellee “appeared to be obtaining refills for this medication authorized by nurses\n\n\n                                         23\n\fand staff of this same heart group who recommended discontinuing this medication\n\n(Austin Heart).” But again, Dr. Breall fails to allege that Austin Heart’s employees\n\nauthorized refills of Pradaxa after Dr. Kessler’s order to stop. To make a causal\n\nconnection, Dr. Breall would need to establish that Austin Heart employees\n\nauthorized Appellee to obtain refills of Pradaxa after Dr. Kessler’s order on March\n\n27, 2012. Without this information, the trial court could not have concluded from\n\nDr. Breall’s report that an act or omission by Austin Heart employees caused\n\nAppellee to continue to take Pradaxa after March 27, 2012.6\n\n       As this Court recently noted in Smith v. Wilson, an expert must explain, with\n\nsupporting facts, how each defendant’s alleged breach in the standard of care\n\ncaused the injury in question. 368 S.W.3d at 577–78. A conclusory statement on\n\ncausation is wholly insufficient. Id. Dr. Breall’s report offers no explanation or\n\nfacts explaining the causal link between alleged breaches in the standard of care by\n\nAppellants and Appellee’s continued use of Pradaxa. Hence, Dr. Breall’s report\n\nfails to satisfy the requirements of section 74.351.\n\n       Furthermore, Dr. Breall fails to explain how Appellee’s ingestion of Pradaxa\n\nbetween March 27, 2012 and her hospitalization in July of 2012 caused the injuries\n\n6\n  Further, Dr. Breall cannot satisfy the causation element by offering mere possibilities. See Fung\nv. Fischer, 365 S.W.3d 507, 530 (Tex. App.—Austin 2012, no pet.), overruled on other grounds,\nCertified EMS, Inc. v. Potts, 392 S.W.3d 625 (Tex. 2013). “Reports providing a ‘description of\nonly a possibility of causation do[ ] not constitute a good-faith effort to comply with the\nstatute.’” Id. Dr. Breall states Appellee “appeared to be obtaining refills for [Pradaxa] authorized\nby” Austin Heart employees. (CR 44) (emphasis added). This language indicates Dr. Breall is\nsimply guessing that Austin Heart employees authorized refills for Appellee.\n\n                                                24\n\falleged in his report -- hypertension, acute kidney injury, and apparent\n\ngastrointestinal bleeding. Rather, Dr. Breall simply states, without any explanation,\n\n“[f]ailure to discontinue the use of Pradaxa was a direct cause of her subsequent\n\nadmission to the hospital with hypotension, acute kidney injury and apparent\n\ngastrointestinal bleeding.” (CR 44). Dr. Breall provides no explanation or factual\n\nsupport for this conclusion as to how Appellee’s ingestion of Pradaxa over a two\n\nmonth period caused these physical injuries. Conclusory statements on causation\n\nwill not satisfy Chapter 74’s expert report requirements. See Palacios, 46 S.W.3d\n\nat 875; Regent Care Ctr. of San Antonio II, Ltd. P'ship v. Hargrave, 300 S.W.3d\n\n343, 346 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2009, pet. denied).\n\n      Since Dr. Breall only offered conclusions about the statutory elements of an\n\nexpert report, the trial court had “no discretion but to conclude ... that the report\n\ndoes not represent a good-faith effort” to satisfy the statute. Smith, 368 S.W.3d at\n\n577. Nonetheless, the trial court in this case found that Dr. Breall’s report was\n\n“adequate under Chapter 74” and denied Appellants’ objections and motion to\n\ndismiss. (CR 344, 365–66). The trial court’s ruling amounted to an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Smith, 368 S.W.3d at 577. Appellants request that this Court reverse\n\nand the trial court’s ruling and remand with an order to grant Appellants’ motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f      D.     By Serving A Report Like Dr. Breall’s, Appellee Effectively\n             Negates The Purpose Of Chapter 74’s Expert Report\n             Requirement.\n\n      As stated above, the purpose of section 74.351 is to prevent the filing of\n\nfrivolous lawsuits against physicians and health care providers in Texas. One of the\n\ncentral purposes of the expert report is to provide a basis for the trial court to\n\nconclude the claims have merit. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879. Stated otherwise, the\n\nreport should let the trial court know the claims are not frivolous. When an expert\n\nreport conceals the relevant facts and provides only baseless conclusions on the\n\nthree elements of a health care liability claim, a plaintiff effectively negates the\n\npurpose of the expert report requirement and circumvents section 74.351.\n\n      This is precisely what Appellee has done in this case. Dr. Breall’s report\n\nconceals the relevant facts in hopes that his vague conclusions would hide the\n\nfrivolous nature of Appellee’s claims. If the trial court’s decision is upheld, the\n\npurposes behind Chapter 74 will effectively be nullified and claimants would likely\n\nuse this Court’s decision to file frivolous claims against physicians and health care\n\nproviders by simply ignoring the facts. This is certainly not what the Legislature\n\nintended when enacting Chapter 74 (formerly article 4590i).\n\n                          CONCLUSION & PRAYER\n\n      In conclusion, Dr. Breall’s report suffers from a number of fatal flaws. Dr.\n\nBreall provides absolutely no facts to support his conclusions on the applicable\n\n\n                                         26\n\fstandard of care, breach, and causation. Dr. Breall also fails to apprise Appellants\n\nof the specific conduct called into question so as to notify the trial court of what\n\nAppellants should have done differently in their care for Appellee. Moreover, Dr.\n\nBreall’s report fails to identify the standard of care applicable to each Appellant,\n\nfails to describe any act or omission by the Appellants that amounted to a breach in\n\nthat standard of care, and fails to show how any alleged breaches by Appellants\n\ncaused Appellee’s injuries. To the extent Dr. Breall does offer a limited opinion on\n\nany of these elements, he only offers baseless conclusions that do not even connect\n\nthe applicable standard of care with an alleged breach of that standard of care\n\nalong with a causal link. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion when\n\nholding that Dr. Breall’s report was “adequate” under Chapter 74 and denying\n\nAppellants’ motion to dismiss.\n\n      WHEREFORE,         PREMISES        CONSIDERED,        Appellants    respectfully\n\nrequest that this Court reverse the trial court’s order denying Appellants’ Chapter\n\n74 Motion to Dismiss and remand to the trial court with an order that all claims\n\nand causes of action asserted by Appellee against Appellants be dismissed with\n\nprejudice and that Appellants be awarded their reasonably attorneys’ fees and costs\n\nas allowed by Chapter 74 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\nAppellants further pray for such other relief that they may be justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f                                     Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                     SERPE, JONES, ANDREWS,\n                                     CALLENDER & BELL, PLLC\n\n\n                                     By:   /s/ Chris Knudsen\n                                           Chris Knudsen\n                                           Texas Bar No. 24041268\n                                           cknudsen@serpejones.com\n                                     America Tower\n                                     2929 Allen Parkway, Suite 1600\n                                     Houston, Texas 77019\n                                     Telephone: (713) 452-4400\n                                     Facsimile: (713) 452-4499\n\n                                     Attorneys for Appellants Vivek Goswami,\n                                     M.D. and Austin Heart, PLLC\n\n                     CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n       I hereby certify that the foregoing Brief for Appellants is computer\ngenerated, has been prepared in a conventional typeface no smaller than 14-point\nfor text and 12-point for footnotes, contains 6,322 words according to word count\nfunction of the computer program used to prepare this Brief, excluding any parts\nexempted by TEX.

If the report is “no\nreport,” then the trial court must dismiss the case with\n\nFootnotes\n1      These included records of five physicians, three hospitals, and a clinic.\n\n2      In their brief, the Webbs state that the email response was actually by Dr. Kessler rather than Dr. Rodgers and the reference in\n       the report is a typographical error. However, there is no evidence in the record on this point other than Dr. Cororve’s report.\n3      The report does not mention who was responsible for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic stimulation or placing a new right\n       ventricular lead.\n4      Austin Heart, P.A. is alleged to be vicariously liable for the conduct of Dr. Kessler. Dr. Cororve’s report notes at the outset that\n       “[a]ny reference in this report to David J. Kessler, M.D. refers to Dr. Kessler individually, and his employer, Austin Heart,\n       P.A.” Consequently, for the purposes of this appeal, the report must link Dr. Cororve’s opinions to the actions of Dr. Kessler.\n5      The Webbs suggest that a tally of the number of times a physician is mentioned in a report is significant. They note that Dr.\n       Kessler’s name appears eleven times in Dr. Cororve’s report (as opposed to three times for Dr. Rodgers and once for “various\n       physicians”). They argue that this could lead to a reasonable conclusion that the report must be about Dr. Kessler and his\n       actions. However, we are not persuaded that such a tally is relevant to the analysis. A physician may be named in a report any\n       number of times simply because he was intimately involved in the treatment of a patient, yet the complaint may be with the\n       conduct of a physician who saw the patient only once and is mentioned in the report only once.

Webb, 228 S.W.3d 276 (2007)\n\n\n\n      is mentioned in a report, by itself, has little bearing on whether the opinions expressed in the report concern that physician.\n      What matters, of course, is how the physician is mentioned and what the report communicates about that physician.\n6     It is not clear what the reference to “various physicians” and “electrophysiological consultations” in the report means or is\n      intended to communicate.\n7     Jernigan interpreted a prior version of the statute that had a different standard for granting an extension to cure. Under the\n      previous iteration of the statute, the trial court could grant an extension only if it found that the failure to comply with the statute\n      was “not intentional or the result of conscious indifference but was the result of an accident or mistake.” See former\n      Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, § 13.01(g) repealed by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 204, § 10.09, eff. Sept. 1, 2003. The\n      Jernigan opinion does not discuss the application of this standard, the trial court’s failure to grant an extension under this\n      standard, or whether the trial court could have considered such an extension if it had made such findings. Thus, the Jernigan\n      opinion is distinguishable from this case on this basis alone. However, even if the trial court’s discretion to dismiss claims under\n      either version of the statute is viewed as the same, the expert report in Jernigan would still constitute “no report” for the\n      purposes of dismissal under either version of the statute.\n8     The dissent argues that by remanding to allow the trial court to consider whether a section 74.351(c) extension is appropriate we\n      are granting Dr. Kessler and Austin Heart more relief than they requested or are entitled to. The dissent’s theory is that there is a\n      distinction under section 74.351 between (1) seeking dismissal on the basis that no report was served and (2) seeking dismissal\n      on the basis that a report was served, but it does not meet the requirements of the statute and is deficient. According to the\n      dissent, if a defendant seeks dismissal only on the basis that no report was served, then dismissal is not appropriate if the court\n      finds that a report, no matter how deficient, was served. There are two problems with this theory.\n         First, the dismissal mechanism of section 74.351 does not work the way the dissent suggests. Under section 74.351, a\n         claimant must serve an “expert report,” as defined in the statute, or be subject to dismissal. If a claimant does not serve a\n         report that complies with the statutory requirements, then the claimant has not served an “expert report” as defined in the\n         statute. Whether a claimant actually fails to serve a report at all or serves a deficient report the effect under section 74.351(b)\n         is the same—the claimant has failed to serve the required “expert report” and dismissal is the remedy. However, section\n         74.351(c) provides a potential cure period for situations where the claimant has served a report, but the report does not\n         constitute the required “expert report” because “elements of the report are found deficient.” The claimant then has an\n         opportunity to fix the defect in the report that was served. If there is a failure to cure the defect by the extended deadline, then\n         dismissal is mandatory because the claimant has failed to serve an “expert report” as defined in the statute.\n         While section 74.351(b) does not distinguish between a complete failure to serve a report and the failure to serve a complying\n         report, there is a distinction between the two for the purposes of 74.351(c). When a claimant fails to serve a report at all,\n         section 74.351(c) does not provide a basis for the trial court to grant any extension of the deadline for serving a report.\n         Consequently, dismissal is mandatory without any cure period. When a claimant serves a report, but it is deficient, section\n         74.351(c) gives the trial court the discretion to grant an extension to cure. Regardless of whether a claimant has failed to serve\n         a report at all or has served a deficient report, the statutory basis of the motion to dismiss by a defendant is the same—the\n         claimant has failed to serve an “expert report” as required by section 74.351(b). The fact that the claimant who files a\n         deficient report may request and receive an extension of time to cure the deficiencies does not alter the nature of the\n         defendant’s motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss is on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to serve an “expert report.”\n         Second, the defendants in this case did request dismissal on the basis that, while the Webbs had served a report that\n         mentioned Dr. Kessler, the report “fails to address the standard of care applicable to Dr. Kessler, the breach of the standard or\n         any alleged causal link.” This is an allegation that the report served was deficient. The defendants acknowledge that a report\n         was served and that the report addresses conduct of Dr. Kessler, but they claim it is deficient in failing to address the\n         statutorily required elements. They are aware that section 74.351(c) grants the trial court some discretion in allowing an\n         extension to cure certain deficient reports. But, they argue that the report in this case is so deficient that it should be viewed as\n         “no report,” requiring dismissal rather than remand for consideration of an extension period. By alleging that the deficiency is\n         severe enough to constitute “no report” the defendants are trying to avoid the possibility of a cure period. They are not\n         altering their claim that the report they received is deficient and will require dismissal if not corrected.\n         We have concluded that the report is deficient, but not so deficient as to constitute “no report.” Therefore, our options are (1)\n         reverse the trial court order denying the motion to dismiss and render judgment of dismissal or (2) reverse the trial court order\n         and remand for consideration of whether an extension should be granted to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to attempt to\n         cure. Remanding for the case to proceed on its merits, even though we agree with the appellants that the report is deficient, is\n         not an option.\n1     While Dr. Cororve’s report explicitly mentions Austin Heart, the Dallas court of appeals has held that when a defendant is only\n      alleged to be vicariously liable for the negligence of another defendant, the expert report need not specifically name or address\n      the negligence of the defendant to whom liability will be imputed. University of Tex. Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Dale, 188\n      S.W.3d 877, 879 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2006, no pet.). What is relevant is that the report specifically identify the person whose\n      conduct the plaintiff is calling into question and show how that person’s conduct constituted negligence.

Webb, 228 S.W.3d 276 (2007)\n\n\n2     Earlier in the report, under the materials reviewed section, Dr. Cororve refers to an e-mail from Mr. Webb to Dr. Kessler dated\n      05/04/05. In their brief on appeal, the Webbs assert that the report erroneously attributes the response to that e-mail as being\n      from Dr. Rodgers when it was actually from Dr. Kessler. There is, however, no evidence in the record indicating who sent the e-\n      mail.\n3     While it is true that the number of times a physician is named, by itself, does not indicate the report complains of that\n      physician’s conduct, it is more likely that a report discussing mainly the conduct of one physician is about the conduct of that\n      physician.\n4     The motion to dismiss clearly distinguishes the two scenarios, stating:\n          This is not an occasion in which a report was served on Austin Heart, P.A. or David J. Kessler, M.D. wherein the expert\n          failed to address a requisite element, such as the standard of care, the alleged breach of the standard, or the alleged causal\n          link, thus making the report deficient. Here, the report constitutes no report at all.\n        Thus, Austin Heart and Dr. Kessler did not, as the majority contends, “argue that the report in this case is so deficient that it\n        should be viewed as ‘no report.’ ”\n5     The remand fashioned by the majority grants Austin Heart and Dr. Kessler relief not requested because the majority treats their\n      motion to dismiss as if it were based on two grounds: (1) that the report was “no report” and (2) that even if the report was some\n      report that it was deficient. Austin Heart’s and Dr. Kessler’s motion, however, was based solely on the first ground. Without a\n      motion to dismiss based on deficiency, there is no basis for a finding of deficiency and no need for a 30–day extension “to cure\n      the deficiency.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 74.351(c).\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

There may be a number of ways that a defendant may be referenced within the four corners a report so as to\n        comply with the legislature’s mandate that the report “provide[ ] a fair summary as of the date of the report regarding applicable\n        standards of care, the manner in which the care rendered by the physician or health care provider failed to meet the standards,\n        and the causal relationship between that failure and the injury, harm, or damages claimed.” Tex.

Russo, 228 S.W.3d 252, 255–58 (Tex.App.-Austin 2007, no pet.), this Court affirmed a trial court order\n        dismissing a health care liability suit under section 74.351(b) and refusing to grant a 30–day extension under section 74.351(c).\n        The lone defendant was Dr. Russo, a general surgeon, who was alleged to have acted negligently in failing to implement\n        precautions against pulmonary embolism or stroke. The report described various deviations from the standard of care, including\n        failures to properly address deep venous thrombosis prevention or to insert an IVC filter, but did not identify Dr. Russo by name\n        or otherwise. The panel observed that “[a]lthough appellant has sued only Dr. Russo, other doctors and health-care providers are\n        implicated by the facts set forth in the report. The report references other providers as well as their conduct and refers to another\n        doctor by name, but fails to mention Dr. Russo at all.” Id. at 257. The panel found the report deficient and no report, reasoning\n        that it did not “specifically identify the defendant and apply the statutory elements to that defendant,” id. at 258, and “[i]f a\n        report fails to address the defendant physician, it constitutes no report as to that defendant, and the trial court may not grant a\n        30–day extension.” Id. at 257. We need not consider Ogletree’s implications for Apodaca’s analysis of the “no report” issue\n        because it is dicta. See Ogletree, 262 S.W.3d at ––––, ––––, 2007 WL 4216606, at *2–3, 2007 Tex.

As the dissent has acknowledged in Austin Heart and elsewhere, section 74.351\n        does not permit such a remedy where, as here, the report constitutes no report. See Austin Heart, 228 S.W.3d at 291 (Patterson,\n        J., dissenting) (“[t]he difference between the two is strategically significant.

I, § 13, is not directly implicated in this\n      case because it applies only to common-law causes of action, not their statutory wrongful-death or survival claims.\n7     Appellees similarly urge us to “avoid a constitutional confrontation” by remanding the case to afford them the opportunity to\n      amend their expert report.\n8     In a footnote in their motion, appellees complain that “Texas courts have never implemented the regime of preliminary\n      disclosures provided in principle in Section 74.352; the plaintiffs had to request disclosures from the defendants, who\n      responded—after the expert report was served—with little or nothing of substance.”\n9     See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 74.351(s), (u); Tex.R. Civ. P. 192.7(a) (defining “written discovery”); see generally\n      Tex.R. Civ. P. 194, 196–98, 200–01.\n10    See Tex.R. Civ. P. 215.\n\n1     The hospital settled and was dismissed from the lawsuit.\n\n2     In Palacios, the court faulted the expert report for its conclusory statement that the standard of care required the hospital to have\n      monitored Palacios more closely, restrain him more securely or done something else entirely. The court stated: “Knowing only\n      that the expert believes that American Transitional did not take precautions to prevent the fall might be useful if American\n      Transitional had an absolute duty to prevent falls from its hospital beds.” American Transitional Care Ctrs. v. Palacios, 46\n      S.W.3d 873, 880 (Tex.2001). Here, the trial court may have concluded that the standard of care and duty were clear from the\n      report detailing the “toxic levels of oxycodone along with lethal levels of propoxyphene” that caused the death.\n3     The majority’s criticism of this approach relies on Apodaca v. Russo, 228 S.W.3d 252 (Tex.App.-Austin 2007, no pet.), and\n      Garcia v. Marichalar, 185 S.W.3d 70 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2005, no pet.), but those cases are distinguishable in that both\n      involved multiple defendants, whereas here we have only one defendant—Dr. Bogar.\n1     I do not take issue with the majority’s holding that the appellees, who failed to take full advantage of the discovery tools\n      provided by section 74.351 of the civil practices and remedies code, cannot now argue that the statute imposes an\n      unconstitutional burden by restricting discovery until after expert reports have been served. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\n      Ann. § 74.351(s), (u) (West Supp.2007). However, while the appellees may not have established that section 74.351’s discovery\n      limitations prevented them from serving a sufficient expert report, they have also not been given any opportunity to cure\n      deficiencies in Dr. Adame’s report, which, until this Court’s holding on appeal, had been deemed sufficient as to Dr. Bogar.\n2     In addition to arguing that Dr. Adame’s report constituted “no report,” Dr. Bogar also argues that Dr. Adame, a pathologist, was\n      not qualified to render opinions concerning the standard of care applicable to physical medicine rehabilitation physicians, such\n      as Dr. Bogar. While the majority does not address this contention in light of their holding that the expert report constituted “no\n      report” as to Dr. Bogar, I would hold that even if Dr. Adame is deemed unqualified to render an expert opinion in this case, the\n      appellees should still be afforded the opportunity to request the 30–day extension provided by section 74.351(c).\n         A similar argument regarding expert qualifications was made in Ogletree, in which the appellant asserted that a radiologist\n         was incapable of opining on the standard of care applicable to urologists. Ogletree v. Matthews, No. 06–0502, ––– S.W.3d ––\n         ––, ––––, 2007 WL 4216606, at *2, 2007 Tex. LEXIS 1028, at *4 (Tex. Nov. 30, 2007). In a concurring opinion, Justice\n         Willett stated that the defect in the expert report consisted of “designating the wrong type of medical professionals to opine\n         on standard of care,” and that using the wrong type of expert “is the type of defect for which a trial court may grant a\n         discretionary section 74.351(c) extension.” Id. at *6, at *18 (Willett, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Matters in the Fischers’ post-submission brief\n       unrelated to the jurisdictional issue will be considered based upon their earlier briefing and argument.\n4      The exception in section 51.014(a)(9) prohibiting appeal from an order granting a 30–day extension to cure a deficient report\n       under section 74.351 is inapplicable here because the court’s orders did not grant any extension. See Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n       Rem.Code Ann. §§ 51.014(a)(9) (West Supp. 2011), 74.351(c) (West 2011).\n5      Health care providers and podiatrists are within the scope of chapter 74. See id. All of the Fischers’ petitions and all of\n       Urukalo’s answers identified Urukalo as a “D.P.M.” (doctor of podiatric medicine). See 22 Tex. Admin. Code § 373.3 (2011)\n       (Tex. State Bd. of Podiatric Med. Exam’rs, Practitioner Identification). Also, the Fischers’ response to the motions to dismiss\n       and objections refers to Urukalo as a “podiatrist” and to appellants collectively as “defendant health care providers.”\n6      The Fischers assert, for the first time on appeal and contrary to their response below, that Urukalo’s objections were waived.\n       Because the Fischers’ response did not raise the waiver issue (instead, they acknowledged that Urukalo’s objections to the 2009\n       reports were timely), it was not before the probate court when it ruled, and we may not consider it on appeal. See Hansen v.\n       Starr, 123 S.W.3d 13, 18 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2003, pet. denied) (rejecting waiver issue because claimants failed to raise it in their\n       responses to doctors’ motions to dismiss); see also San Jacinto Methodist Hosp. v.

Fischer, 365 S.W.3d 507 (2012)\n\n\n\n7     As previously noted, the 2007 reports address only Urukalo’s negligence, and the original ADC defendant does not seek\n      dismissal of the health care liability claim asserting its vicarious liability for Urukalo’s alleged negligent conduct as pled in the\n      2007 original petition.\n8     Because the probate court’s order explicitly stated that the ADC defendants’ objections were overruled as untimely (and thus,\n      were waived), we do not reach the Fischers’ additional argument that the original ADC defendant waived its objections to the\n      2007 reports by participating in discovery. Cf. Jernigan v. Langley, 111 S.W.3d 153, 157 (Tex.2003) (rejecting argument that\n      doctor’s “attempt[ ] to learn more about the case” through discovery demonstrated his intent to waive his right to move for\n      dismissal).\n9     The Eleventh Court of Appeals noted that five of our sister courts evaluate direct-liability claims and vicarious-liability claims\n      as separate health care liability claims, but the First Court of Appeals has instead reasoned that the two are merely alternative\n      legal theories for imposing liability in the same health care liability claim and that “if at least one liability theory within a cause\n      of action is shown by the expert report, then the claimant may proceed with the entire cause of action against the defendant,\n      including particular liability theories that were not originally part of the expert report.” Hendrick Med.

To the extent Potts takes the position that an expert report which solely\n      addresses a vicarious-liability claim against a health care provider suffices to support a direct-liability claim against that\n      provider arising, as here, from a different group of operative facts, we decline to follow it.\n10    The Fischers filed several amended petitions in 2009, but their amended pleadings against the original ADC defendant, based on\n      the same underlying facts, did not restart their 120–day deadline for serving expert reports. See Maxwell v. Seifert, 237 S.W.3d\n      423, 426 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied); see also Davis v.

(mem. op.).\n11    The Fischers’ response to the defendants’ objections and motions contains a chart reflecting the Fischers’ mistaken belief that\n      the deadline for defendants’ objections to the reports ran from the date that the defendants were served with the petition. The\n      Fischers miscalculated the deadline for the defendants’ objections—and erroneously argued that the objections were waived—\n      by adding twenty-one days to the date that the defendants were served with the petition instead of the date that the defendants\n      were served with the report. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 74.351(a) (emphasis added).\n12    The Fischers appear to have abandoned this argument, which is unaddressed in their brief. See Tex.R.App. P. 38.2(a)(2).\n\n13    The Fischers served only the original pair of defendants, ADC and Urukalo, with the first set of expert reports.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See, e.g., Bogar v. Esparza, 257 S.W.3d 354, 370 n. 6\n      (Tex.App.-Austin 2008, no pet.) (noting open-court protections not directly implicated in statutory wrongful-death and survivor\n      action before conducting similar due-process analysis).\n11    In their reply brief, the Heberts attempt to distinguish some of these cases on the basis that they involved “a complete failure to\n      file an expert report,” instead of “addressing the legislature’s restriction placed on the courts in deciding the issue” of a report’s\n      sufficiency. However, Texas courts, including this Court, have rejected constitutional challenges where, as here, an expert\n      report was served, but found deficient. See, e.g., Hightower v. Baylor Univ. Med.

When a statute burdens a sensitive class or impinges on an important right, the statute is subject to an\n      intermediate level of scrutiny, which requires a showing that the statute is substantially related to an important state interest. Id.\n      at 440–41, 105 S.Ct. 3249.\n13    Though the Heberts did not explicitly claim chapter 74 was an unconstitutional special law prohibited by the Texas\n      Constitution, many of their complaints track arguments raised by parties who have raised such claims. Accordingly, we find\n      cases addressing special-law challenges instructive.\n14    The Heberts also argue that chapter 74 “effectively revives the general demurrer practice which permitted judges to dismiss\n      cases on the pleadings.” They argue that summary judgment is the preferred method for defendants to obtain a dismissal on the\n      merits. Our rules of procedure prohibit the use of general demurrers. Tex.R. Civ. P. 90.

Thus, to the extent chapter 74 and rule 90 conflict,\n      chapter 74 controls. See Mitchell v. Berry, No. 05–06–01328–CV, 2007 WL 4111923, at *4 (Tex.App.-Dallas Nov. 20, 2007,\n      pet. denied) (mem. op.) (rejecting argument Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 13.001 allowing for dismissal in inability-to-\n      pay cases was a general demurrer in contravention of Rule 90); see also Smalling v. Gardner, 203 S.W.3d 354, 367 n. 8\n      (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (distinguishing dismissal under general demurrer from dismissal for failure\n      to serve expert report).\n15    The Heberts make passing reference to infringement of their right to trial by jury, but provide no authority or argument in\n      support of any challenge based on that provision that is distinct from their other arguments. To the extent the Heberts intended\n      to advance a distinct challenge based on their right to jury trial, it too would fail. The right to a jury trial is not an absolute right\n      in civil cases, but is subject to certain procedural rules. Schorp v. Baptist Mem’l Health Sys., 5 S.W.3d 727, 738 (Tex.App.-San\n      Antonio 1999, no pet.) (citing Wooten v. Dallas Hunting & Fishing Club, Inc., 427 S.W.2d 344, 346 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas\n      1968, no writ)). “Imposing the requirement to file an expert report and the failure to meet that requirement allows the trial court\n      to dismiss the case. This dismissal is not based on the merits, but merely operates to dismiss the case on a procedural\n      requirement which is directly related to the statute’s purpose of limiting the number of frivolous suits.” Id. (addressing article\n      4590i (citing Buckholts Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Glaser, 632 S.W.2d 146, 149 (Tex.1982) (holding that failure of plaintiff to fulfill\n      bonding requirement for challenging school board election did not deny taxpayer right to jury trial on merits))).\n16    The Heberts point to decisions from other jurisdictions that, in their view, struck down expert-report requirements similar to\n      chapter 74 based on constitutional provisions analogous to the protections on which they rely here. See, e.g., Putman v.\n      Wenatchee Valley Med. Ctr., 166 Wash.2d 974, 216 P.3d 374, 378–79 (2009) (law requiring certificate of merit from expert at\n      time of filing violated separation of powers and right of access as it cut off rights of discovery and abrogated pleading\n      requirements in rules of procedure); Wimley v. Reid, 991 So.2d 135, 138 (Miss.2008) (law requiring certificate of merit violated\n      separation of powers); Summerville v. Thrower, 369 Ark. 231, 253 S.W.3d 415, 421 (2007) (law requiring expert affidavit\n      within 30 days of suit violated separation of powers); Zeier v. Zimmer, Inc. 152 P.3d 861, 873 (Okla.2006) (law requiring\n      affidavit of merit with petition barred right of access). They also acknowledge that courts in at least two jurisdictions upheld\n      laws similar to chapter 74. See McAlister v. Schick, 147 Ill.2d 84, 167 Ill.Dec. 1021, 588 N.E.2d 1151, 1157–58 (1992);\n      Mahoney v. Doerhoff Surgical Servs. Inc., 807 S.W.2d 503, 512–13 (Mo.1991). Additionally, they favorably cite cases from\n      other jurisdictions that upheld similar laws “so long as the Legislature [does] not direct[ ] the Courts how to decide the\n      legitimacy of the case.” Texas decisions regarding chapter 74 are consistent with that reasoning. See, e.g., Wilson–Everett v.\n      Christus St. Joseph, 242 S.W.3d 799, 803 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied) (rejecting argument that chapter 74\n      “interfere[d] with the judiciary’s constitutional power to decide when and how to render judgments”). In any event, cases from\n      other jurisdictions have no precedential value for this Court. Instead, we are bound to follow the Supreme Court of Texas and\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

One can imagine a hypothetical conversation between a plaintiff’s\n      attorney and the plaintiff’s medical expert, in which the expert says something like, “In the overwhelming majority of cases like\n      this, the standard of care is X. But I have to be candid: in a very small percentage of such cases, extraordinary circumstances\n      may call for a different treatment approach. Nothing in the medical records I have seen indicates that such extraordinary\n      circumstances existed in this case, but I would not be completely honest if I did not at least mention that possibility.”\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, the Diflucan was prescribed on July 21 and the Vancomycin on July\n       23.\n5      See Act of May 5, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 140, § 1, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 985, 986, amending the Medical Liability and\n       Insurance Improvement Act of Texas, Act of May 30, 1977, 65th Leg., R.S., ch. 817, 1977 Tex. Gen. Laws 2039, 2041,\n       repealed by Act of June 2, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 204, § 10.09, 2003 Tex. Gen. Laws 847, 884. Former article 4590i § 13.01\n       was replaced by Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 74.351, as amended.\n6      When asked if the lapsed prescriptions affected Casas’s hospital stay, Dr. Daller equivocated:\n          A. I think that it certainly did impact it. However, I cannot quantitate that because there are multiple variables that are\n          present in a clinical condition. Whether it lengthened her stay by one day, two days, three days, I cannot say that. What I\n          would say from a scientific standpoint is that for four and a half days she did not receive appropriate therapy. Had she\n          received the appropriate therapy then you would expect her length of stay to be shortened somewhat. To quantitate that, I\n          could not do that.\n          ....\n          A. Obviously, not receiving antibiotics is not going to shorten your stay. Therefore, if it impacted the stay it must have\n          lengthened it. (emphases added).\n7      Admittedly, anaerobic bacteria are hard to culture because they are averse to oxygen.\n\n8      Dr. Berkowitz testified:\n            I think that there are a number of things that can cause things smelling bad besides just infection. Tissue that dies doesn’t\n            smell good. There’s bacteria and products released by the dead tissue that don’t smell good.\n            And we know based on the pathology report of the cancer that they took out of her abdomen, that this had grown enough\n            that it was dying. In other words, it was probably outgrowing it’s [sic] blood supply and was starting to die. That in and of\n            itself can smell bad. Then you have a wound that is infected; although Candida itself does not typically smell bad, not like\n            something dead. It smells funky and people don’t like the way it smells. The wound itself when it wasn’t healing was\n            probably having some necrotic tissue, as well, or dead tissue that is in the wound. I’m sure that smelled bad, as well. And\n            they were never able to completely get rid of all that dead cancer tissue that was in her abdomen.\n            I think there’s a number of reasons why she would have had a bad smell, none of which can be explained by four or five\n            days of not getting Flagyl [or] Maxipime.\n9      In his dissent, CHIEF JUSTICE JEFFERSON argues that an expert report need not meet the legal sufficiency requirements\n       necessary to support a judgment and suggests that we hold it must. We agree that an expert report need not “meet the same\n       requirements as the evidence offered in a summary-judgment proceeding or at trial.” Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879. But, as we\n       stated earlier, the report must provide more than conclusory statements concerning applicable standards of care, breach of those\n       standards, and causation. See id. An expert report must instead, within its four corners, provide some explanation as to each of\n       these elements. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4590i § 13.01(r)(6); Wright, 79 S.W.3d at 52. The report here offered only a\n       conclusory statement concerning causation with no explanation as to how the lapse in antibiotic treatment resulted in longer\n       hospitalization, increased pain and suffering, or ultimately Casas’s death.\n10     In her dissent, JUSTICE LEHRMANN indicates that (1) she would remand the case to allow the Casases an opportunity to\n       show that their failure to present an adequate report was not intentional or the result of conscious indifference, and (2) Dr.\n       Jelinek should not be entitled to attorney’s fees and costs if the Casases can make this showing and submit an adequate report.\n       We note that the Casases did not request a remand of this nature, nor brief the attorney’s fees issue. See State v. Brown, 262\n       S.W.3d 365, 370 (Tex.2008) (observing that “[a] party generally is not entitled to relief it does not seek” and refusing to sua\n       sponte grant relief that was not sought); Fed. Sign v. Tex. S. Univ., 951 S.W.2d 401, 410 (Tex.1997) (noting that ordinarily,\n       failure to brief an argument waives error on appeal); TEX.R.APP. P. 38.1(h).\n11     We briefly note that under former article 4590i a trial court’s order denying a motion to dismiss premised on an inadequate\n       expert report was not immediately appealable, as it now is under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code §§ 51.014 and\n       74.351. Nor did we definitively say that mandamus review was appropriate for such orders until almost four years after the trial\n       court denied Dr. Jelinek’s motion for dismissal and sanctions. See In re McAllen Med. Ctr., Inc., 275 S.W.3d 458, 461–62\n       (Tex.2008). Thus, we do not fault Dr. Jelinek for waiting until final judgment to seek review of the trial court’s order. See\n       Hernandez v. Ebrom, 289 S.W.3d 316, 318 (Tex.2009) (“Generally, appeals may only be taken from final judgments....”).\n         We mention this point because we have since cautioned that a defendant—having foregone the interlocutory appeal now\n         available—risks losing the right to appeal following final judgment if, after a trial on the merits, the jury finds the defendant\n         liable. See id. at 321. Even if the present statute applied here, this caution would not bar Dr. Jelinek’s appeal because he was\n         not a party at trial, having been nonsuited earlier. We will not bar a nonsuited defendant’s appeal after final judgment because\n         the jury finds him liable at a former codefendant’s trial.

Leland v.

TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 74.351(a)-(b)\n       (West 2011).\n2      “Hypoxia” is the “presence of less than the normal amount of oxygen, as in the air, in the blood, in a tissue, in the lungs, etc.,”\n       and “ischemia” is a “condition in which a part of the body suffers from a lack of blood, usually because of a contraction of the\n       blood vessels.” See Schmidt, J.E., M.D., Attorneys’ Dictionary of Medicine Illustrated, Vol. 3, H–285, I–208–208.1 (Matthew\n       Bender 2010).\n3      The case against Timothy Aquilina and Jasper Neuse, both certified registered nurse anesthetists, was later nonsuited.\n\n4      This case is certainly unlike IHS Acquisition No. 131, Inc. v. Crowson, 351 S.W.3d 368, 369–70, 373–74 (Tex.App.-El Paso\n       2010, no pet.) (not yet reported), which involved one nurse wasting approximately ten minutes trying to determine whether the\n       victim, who was gasping for breath, was a “DNR” patient before the staff began CPR. There, it was clear that the expert was\n       calling into question that one nurse’s actions before the staff began resuscitative efforts. Id. at 373–74.\n5      De La Riva points to several cases in her briefs to support her argument that causation may be supplied from other expert\n       reports, but all of those cases concerned reports submitted by more than one physician. See Packard v. Guerra, 252 S.W.3d 511,\n       514 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied); Perez v.

Because we find that the Walkers have failed to establish the requirements for mandamus\n       relief, we do not reach this issue.\n2      The court also sustained Aetna’s motion to quash, holding that the discovery requested was improper under the investigation\n       exemption, the attorney-client privilege, and the work-product privilege. The Walkers do not complain to us about this ruling.\n3      Even if no evidence had been presented, the Walkers would have had the burden of filing an affidavit so stating.

Tex.R.Civ.Evid. 613(b).\n      To date, however, Dr. Gilstrap has not admitted any bias, but rather has flatly denied it. In this situation, such evidence should\n      be discoverable.\n6     We do not decide whether the documents were properly discoverable, only that the trial court erred in denying discovery based\n      solely on Russell. If the Walkers sought the documents solely to attack the credibility of Dr. Gilstrap by showing that his\n      deposition testimony was untrue, for instance, the information would probably not be reasonably calculated to lead to the\n      discovery of admissible evidence. See Tex.R.Civ.Evid. 608(b). (“Specific instances of the conduct of a witness [other than\n      criminal convictions], for the purpose of attacking ... his credibility, may not be ... proved by extrinsic evidence.”).\n7     Additionally, this Court will not grant mandamus relief unless we determine that the error is of such importance to the\n      jurisprudence of the state as to require correction. Cf. Tex.Gov’t Code § 22.001(a)(6); Tex.R.App.P. 140(b).

Pope v. Stephenson, 787 S.W.2d 953\n      (Tex.1990). We explained: “The decision not to pursue the extraordinary remedy of mandamus does not prejudice or waive a\n      party’s right to complain on appeal.” Id. at 954.\n10    Courts use a similar approach in determining whether a witness has properly invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against\n      self-incrimination. It is often impossible for a witness to prove that an answer might incriminate him without actually answering\n      and thereby forfeiting the privilege. Therefore, rather than requiring actual proof of the privilege, courts sustain the privilege if\n      it is “evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer [might be\n      incriminating].” Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 487, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951).\n1     If the records have relevance apart from their potential for impeachment, however, Russell does not bar discovery.

Co. v.\n      Dellana, 667 S.W.2d 911 (Tex.App.—Austin 1984, orig. proceeding) (mandamus issued against trial court for denying\n      discovery of claims files).\n5     The majority identifies by name five cases in conflict with today’s writing, declaring that: “We disapprove of Barker and Allen,\n      and any other authorities,” at 842, and “[we] disapprove of Cleveland, Crane, Jampole, and any other authorities,” at 842, to the\n      extent they conflict with the new Walker standard. Subsumed within the “other” designation are a great number of additional\n      cases from this court and the courts of appeals that would grant to the Walkers relief when the trial court has clearly abused its\n      discretion in denying discovery. The court’s willingness to sweepingly erase whole unidentified categories of recent precedent\n      is exemplified by their signing of a blank check: “any other authorities,” meaning all other authorities, are now endangered.\n6     The few cases citing Automatic Drilling do not expand its holding to that suggested by the court today. See Jampole, 673\n      S.W.2d at 574–75 (“We hold that discovery cannot be denied because of an asserted proprietary interest in the requested\n      documents when a protective order would sufficiently preserve that interest.”); Firestone Photographs, Inc. v. Lamaster, 567\n      S.W.2d 273, 278 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1978, no writ) (“[T]he claim of trade secrets ... does not necessarily defeat the\n      right of discovery.”).\n7     James B. Sales, Pretrial Discovery in Texas Under the Amended Rules: Analysis and Commentary, 27 S.Tex.L.Rev. 305, 345–\n      46 (1986), stating that:\n           Trade secrets ... are not, per se, exempt from discovery. The trial court is obligated to weigh the need for discovery against\n           the interests on secrecy.... The need to protect the confidentiality of documents does not constitute an absolute bar to\n           discovery....\n8     Although also citing General Motors Corp. v. Lawrence, 651 S.W.2d 732 (Tex.1983, orig. proceeding), as allowing mandamus\n      relief from an allegedly burdensome trial court discovery order, the majority fails to note the very expansive discovery\n      permitted in that case. The efforts of General Motors to limit discovery to results from tests performed on the particular type of\n      truck and the particular type of impact involved in the subject incident were rejected, and it was directed to supply all impact\n      test results for all types of trucks manufactured over a 23–year period.\n9     If the trial court “refuses to make [the discovery] part of the record,” At 843, presumably the only relief accorded under today’s\n      standard would be issuance of a writ directing inclusion of these materials.\n10    See Caller Times Publishing Co. v.

The Walgreen Co., et al., in the 419th Judicial\n\nDistrict Court of Travis County, Texas, before the Honorable Visiting Judge Gus J.\n\nStrauss.\n\f                          STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n      Appellee Nancy Jo Rodriguez (“Appellee”) filed a health care liability claim\n\nagainst several defendants, including Appellants, based on Appellee’s taking of a\n\nmedication known as Pradaxa. (CR 4–12). With her petition, Appellee served a\n\nreport authored by Jeffrey A. Breall, M.D., Ph.D. (“Dr. Breall”). (CR 43–44).\n\nAppellants objected to Dr. Breall’s report shortly thereafter. (CR 119–52). Over\n\nthe next three months, Appellee did not serve any new or amended reports. After\n\nthe expiration of the statutory deadline to serve expert reports under Chapter 74,\n\nAppellants moved to dismiss Appellee’s claim. (CR 189–95). However, the trial\n\ncourt entered an order finding that Dr. Breall’s report was adequate and denying\n\nAppellants’ motion to dismiss. (CR 344–45, 365–66). Appellants subsequently\n\nfiled this interlocutory appeal from that order. (CR 346–50).\n\n                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      1.     Whether the trial court abused its discretion when holding Dr. Breall’s\n\nreport was adequate under Chapter 74 despite Dr. Breall only offering conclusory\n\nopinions that did not link the facts to his conclusions.\n\n      2.     Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Appellants’\n\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to section 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practices and\n\nRemedies Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      In 2012, Appellee was a patient of Austin Heart, PLLC (“Austin Heart”)\n\nwhere she received treatment for an abnormal sinus rhythm in her heart. (CR 6).\n\nAs a patient of Austin Heart, Appellee was treated by David Kessler, M.D. (“Dr.\n\nKessler”) and Vivek Goswami, M.D. (“Dr. Goswami”), both of whom are\n\ncardiologists. (Id.). In her petition, Appellee states that, on March 27, 2012, Dr.\n\nKessler “orders that [Appellee] stop her use of the drug Pradaxa because she is\n\nmaintaining her sinus rhythm without it.” (Id.). However, Appellee alleges “this\n\norder to stop the medication was not followed by Dr. Goswami.” (Id.). Appellee\n\nnonetheless admits she continued to refill her prescription for Pradaxa despite Dr.\n\nKessler’s order to stop. (Id.). Appellee claims her continued use of Pradaxa caused\n\nher hospitalization on July 2, 2012. (Id.).\n\n      On March 26, 2014, Appellee filed suit against The Walgreen Company,\n\nSara E. McGuire, St. David’s Health Care Partnership, Austin Heart, Dr. Kessler,\n\nand Dr. Goswami (collectively “Defendants”). (CR 4–5). With her petition,\n\nAppellee served Defendants with a curriculum vitae and report from Jeffrey Chad\n\nHardy, Pharm.D., M.S. dated February 21, 2014 (“Hardy’s report”) and a\n\ncurriculum vitae and report from Jeffrey A. Breall, M.D., Ph.D. dated March 18,\n\n2014 (“Dr. Breall’s report”). (CR 13–44). There is no dispute that Hardy’s report\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fdoes not apply to Appellants. Rather, only Dr. Breall’s report references\n\nAppellants.\n\n        As addressed more fully below, Dr. Breall’s report fails to provide any facts\n\nsurrounding the care and treatment provided by Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart. (CR\n\n43–44). In fact, Dr. Breall’s report fails to even identify which medical records he\n\nreviewed to support the opinions in his report. (Id.). If Dr. Breall provided the facts\n\nfrom the relevant records, Dr. Breall’s report would have informed the trial court\n\nthat, prior to Dr. Kessler’s order to stop taking Pradaxa on March 27, 2012,\n\nAppellee already had a prescription for Pradaxa allowing for five refills. (CR 330–\n\n31). Specifically, Appellee was prescribed Pradaxa on February 10, 2012, and she\n\nfilled the prescription on February 14, 2012. (CR 330). On March 16, 2012,\n\nWalgreen’s requested five refills of Pradaxa. (CR 331). On March 27, 2012, Dr.\n\nKessler ordered Appellee to stop taking the Pradaxa. (CR 6). Yet, on May 4, 2012,\n\nAppellee refilled her prescription using the authority provided to Walgreen’s on\n\nMarch 16, 2012. (CR 332).1 On June 16, 2012, Appellee again refilled her\n\nprescription using the authority provided to Walgreen’s on March 16, 2012. (CR\n\n333).\n\n        A review of these records would have also informed the trial court that\n\nAppellee used this prescription that pre-dated Dr. Kessler’s order to obtain refills\n\n1\n  This Audit / Board of Pharmacy Inspection Report shows the “Original Date” for the\nprescription was 3/16/2012 16:04. (Id.).\n\n                                          4\n\fafter Dr. Kessler’s March 27, 2012 order without any communication with Dr.\n\nGoswami or Austin Heart. (CR 332–33). Rather than provide these facts from the\n\nrecords, Dr. Breall chose not to provide any facts.\n\n       On May 12, 2014, Appellants objected to Dr. Breall’s report. (CR 119–27).\n\nIn their objections, Appellants specified that Dr. Breall failed to identify the\n\nstandard of care applicable to each Appellant, failed to identify the alleged acts or\n\nomissions by each Appellant that amounted to a breach in the standard of care, and\n\nfailed to explain the causal relationship between each alleged breach and the\n\ninjuries alleged. (Id.). Despite having knowledge of these objections since May 12,\n\n2014, Appellee failed to amend or supplement Dr. Breall’s report over the next\n\nthree months.\n\n       After the deadline for serving expert reports expired on August 19, 2014,\n\nAppellants filed their motion to dismiss. (CR 189–99).2 On October 20, 2014,\n\nAppellee filed her response to Appellants’ motion to dismiss arguing that Dr.\n\nBreall’s report was sufficient and even moved for sanctions. (CR 297–306). On\n\nOctober 29, 2014, the trial court held a hearing on Appellants’ motion to dismiss.\n\n(RR 1–48).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Since Dr. Breall’s report offered no criticisms of Dr. Kessler, Dr. Kessler also filed a motion to\ndismiss. (CR 171–80). Rather than face a hearing on Dr. Kessler’s motion to dismiss and motion\nfor attorneys’ fees, Appellee non-suited Dr. Kessler. (CR 200–02).\n\n                                                 5\n\f      On October 30, 2014, the Honorable Visiting Judge Gus J. Strauss issued a\n\nletter opinion finding “that the report of Dr. Breall pertaining to Dr. Goswami and\n\nAustin Heart is adequate under [Chapter] 74 and the plaintiff’s claims will proceed.\n\nNo sanctions [or] attorney’s fees will be ordered.” (Appx. A; CR 344–45). In this\n\nsame order, the trial court granted Walgreen’s and Sarah E. McGuire’s motion to\n\ndismiss. (Id.). On December 4, 2014, the trial court signed a more formal order\n\ndenying Appellants’ motion to dismiss under section 74.351 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code. (Appx. A; CR 365–66). On November 17, 2014,\n\nAppellants timed filed their notice of appeal and this interlocutory appeal ensued.\n\n(CR 346–52).\n\n                      SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion in holding that Dr. Breall’s report was\n\nadequate under Chapter 74 and in denying Appellants’ motion to dismiss under\n\nChapter 74. In his report, Dr. Breall fails to provide any of the facts surrounding\n\nAppellee’s care and treatment in this case, and Dr. Breall makes no attempt to link\n\nthe facts to his conclusions on the elements of a Chapter 74 expert report. The\n\nTexas Supreme Court holds that, when a report lacks any explanation linking the\n\nexpert’s conclusion to the relevant facts, a trial court abuses its discretion if it\n\ndenies the defendant’s motion to dismiss. Additionally, Dr. Breall failed to identify\n\nthe standard of care applicable to each Appellant, failed to explain how each\n\n\n                                         6\n\fAppellant breached the standard of care, and failed to explain the causal link\n\nbetween each Appellant’s alleged breach and the injuries alleged. Accordingly, Dr.\n\nBreall’s report did not constitute a good faith effort to comply with the\n\nrequirements of section 74.351, and the trial court erred in denying Appellants’\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n                          ARGUMENT & AUTHORITY\n\nI.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      A trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with\n\nsection 74.351(b) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code is subject to\n\nreview for abuse of discretion. American Transitional Care Ctrs. of Tex., Inc. v.\n\nPalacios, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560592\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560592/american-transitional-care-v-palacios/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 875 (Tex. 2001). However, if an expert report contains\n\nonly conclusions about the statutory elements in section 74.351, the trial court has\n\n“no discretion but to conclude ... that the report does not represent a good-faith\n\neffort” to satisfy the statute.

THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN FINDING DR.\n      BREALL’S REPORT SATISFIED THE REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER 74 AND\n      DENYING APPELLANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS.\n\n      A.     Legislative Intent Of Chapter 74.\n\n      The Legislature enacted Article 4590i (now codified in Chapter 74),\n\nincluding its expert reporting requirement, for the purpose of deterring frivolous\n\nlawsuits against health care providers.

App.—Austin 2008, no pet.).\n\n      As evidenced by this case, the purpose of deterring frivolous lawsuits is\n\neffectively negated when a claimant serves an expert report that conceals the facts\n\nsurrounding the care in question and only provides vague conclusions on certain\n\nelements of a Chapter 74 expert report. Appellee should not be entitled to pursue a\n\nfrivolous (or at best premature) claim by serving such a report.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      B.     Chapter 74’s Expert Report Requirements.\n\n      Chapter 74 requires that, when a plaintiff asserts a health care liability claim,\n\nshe must serve each defendant physician and health care provider with an expert\n\nreport along with the expert’s curriculum vitae within 120 days of filing suit. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 74.351(a)-(c). Chapter 74 further provides that a\n\nfailure to serve a report within 120 days mandates that the trial court dismiss the\n\ncase and award attorneys’ fees and costs. Id at § 74.351(b).\n\n      In order to comply with Chapter 74, an expert report must represent an\n\nobjective good faith effort to comply with the definition of an expert report under\n\nChapter 74. TEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE § 74.351(l). The good faith effort standard\n\nrequires the report to provide an adequate analysis for each of the following\n\nelements of a health care liability claim: (1) the applicable standard of care; (2) the\n\nmanner in which the care rendered by the physician or health care provider failed\n\nto meet the standard; and (3) the causal relationship between that failure and the\n\ninjury, harm or damages claimed. Id. at § 74.351(r)(6); Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court holds that a report will not constitute a good faith effort\n\nif it omits any of these statutory requirements.

Further, in order to constitute a good faith effort, the report must,\n\nat a minimum: (1) inform the defendant of the specific conduct called into\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fquestion; and (2) provide a basis for the trial court to conclude the claims have\n\nmerit. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court also holds that, while a report need not marshal\n\nall of the plaintiff’s proof, it must include the expert’s opinion on each of the\n\nelements identified in section 74.351. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 878. A report cannot\n\nmerely state the expert’s conclusions about the statutory elements.

Dr. Breall’s Report Does Not Constitute A Good Faith Effort to\n            Comply With Section 74.351.\n\n      For ease of reference, Appellants provide below the paragraphs from Dr.\n\nBreall’s report containing his opinions in this case. These paragraphs are the only\n\nones from Dr. Breall’s report addressing Appellants:\n\n      In my opinion the care and treatment provided to Nancy Jo Rodriguez\n      by Austin Heart fell below the accepted standards of care in the\n      following particulars:\n\n      Despite Dr. David Kessler, one of her cardiologists from Austin\n      Heart, requesting that the Pradaxa be discontinued (in this patient\n      who, at best, has bipolar disorder and at times was confused, this was\n      a reasonable request), Pradaxa therapy nevertheless was continued\n      after her acute hospitalization. This request to stop the medication was\n      not appreciated by her primary cardiologist, Dr. Vivek Goswami (who\n      was in the same group as Dr. Kessler). Furthermore, Ms. Rodriguez\n      appeared to be obtaining refills for this medication authorized by\n      nurses and staff of this same heart group who recommended\n      discontinuing this medication (Austin Heart). The standard of care\n      would have been to follow the orders of Dr. Kessler to stop the\n      administration of Pradaxa.\n\n      Failure to discontinue the use of Pradaxa was a direct cause of her\n      subsequent acute admission to the hospital with hypotension, acute\n      kidney injury and apparent gastrointestinal bleeding – known side\n      effects of the over-use of Pradaxa. Ms. Rodriquez’s entire\n      hospitalization was attributable to the failure to stop Pradaxa therapy\n      as ordered by Dr. Kessler. More likely than not, had the Pradaxa\n\n                                        11\n\f      medication been discontinued as requested, Ms. Rodriguez’s\n      hospitalization would never have needed to take place.\n\n      I hold these opinions to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\n      They are based upon my education, training and experience as well as\n      the records which I have reviewed.\n\n(CR 43–44). As explained herein, the report fails to satisfy any of the elements of a\n\nChapter 74 expert report as to Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart and does not\n\nconstitute an expert report under Chapter 74.\n\n             1.     Dr. Breall’s report provides no facts to support his\n                    conclusions and thus does not constitute an expert report\n                    under Chapter 74.\n\n      Before addressing Dr. Breall’s specific failures to satisfy the statutory\n\nelements of a Chapter 74 expert report, it is important to note that Dr. Breall’s\n\nreport provides absolutely no factual background regarding the care and treatment\n\nin question. (CR 43–44). In fact, Dr. Breall’s report fails to even identify which\n\nrecords he reviewed to support the opinions in his report. (Id.). It is well\n\nestablished that an expert must link his conclusions to the facts in order satisfy\n\nChapter 74’s expert report requirement. Most recently, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nheld in Jelinek v. Casas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2010), when the report in question\n\nlacked any explanation linking the expert’s conclusion to the relevant facts, the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to dismiss and\n\nthe court of appeals erred by affirming that ruling. Id. at 540 (citing Bowie Mem’l,\n\n79 S.W.3d at 52).\n\n                                         12\n\f      Several Texas appellate courts have reached the same conclusion. The\n\nappellate courts recognize that an expert’s failure to provide any facts to support\n\nhis or her conclusions on standard of care, breach, and causation prevents the trial\n\ncourt from concluding the plaintiff’s claims have merit.

Id.\n\n      For instance, in Kuykendall v. Dragun, the expert’s report stated that the\n\nplaintiff suffered peripheral nerve damage in a surgery performed by several\n\nphysicians and indicated that the literature provided this type of injury was\n\ntypically caused by failure to properly pad self-retaining retractors, improperly\n\npositioning the patient, or leaning on the patient. Id. The expert then opined that\n\nthese were the most likely causes of the plaintiff’s injuries. However, the report\n\nfailed to identify any facts supporting the conclusion. The report did not state the\n\ndefendant physician used a self-retaining retractor during the procedure, and the\n\nreport did not even identify the types of procedures carried out by the defendant\n\nphysician. The court of appeals held that the expert’s failure to link these facts to\n\nhis conclusions justified the trial court’s dismissal under Chapter 74. Id. In\n\nreaching this conclusion, the trial court found the need for this specific information\n\nin the report is not mere “semantics.” Id. Rather, this information is “vital” when\n\nassessing whether the defendant breached the standard of care. Id.\n\n      Similarly, Dr. Breall leaves out key facts supporting his conclusions. In fact,\n\nDr. Breall leaves out any facts concerning Appellee’s care and treatment.\n\nAppellee’s malpractice action is based on her continued use of Pradaxa after her\n\ntreating cardiologist, Dr. Kessler, ordered her to stop taking this medication (CR\n\n\n                                         14\n\f6). Yet, Dr. Breall’s report provides absolutely no facts about Dr. Kessler’s order\n\nto stop Pradaxa; the date of the order; to whom the order was communicated;\n\nwhether Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart treated, or even had contact with, Appellee\n\nafter Dr. Kessler’s order; the prescription used by Appellee after Dr. Kessler’s\n\norder to stop; the circumstances in which Appellee continued to refill her\n\nprescription and continued to use Pradaxa; and many other relevant facts. Rather,\n\nDr. Breall simply offers conclusory opinions about the standard of care, breach,\n\nand causation.\n\n       It is evident Dr. Breall chose not to include relevant facts since they\n\nobviously did not support the opinions in his report. After all, the medical records\n\nreflect there was no interaction between Appellants and Appellee after Dr.\n\nKessler’s order to stop taking Pradaxa, and Appellee continued to use a\n\nprescription with five remaining refills that pre-dated Dr. Kessler’s order to stop\n\ntaking Pradaxa. Dr. Breall’s report is silent on these facts (or any facts for that\n\nmatter) because they do not support his conclusions.3 Since Dr. Breall failed to\n\nprovide any facts to support his conclusions, his report did not constitute a good\n\nfaith effort to comply with section 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practices and\n\nRemedies Code. Given the lack of facts to support Dr. Breall’s conclusion, the trial\n\n\n3\n  Appellants include these facts not for purposes of determining the sufficiency of Dr. Breall’s\nreport but to illustrate why an expert is required to provide factual support so the trial court may\nassess whether the plaintiff’s claims have merit.\n\n                                                15\n\fcourt abused its discretion in finding the report was sufficient. See Smith, 368\n\nS.W.3d at 577.4 As a result, Appellants request that the Court reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s order.\n\n               2.      Dr. Breall fails to identify the standard of care applicable to\n                       Appellants.\n\n       In addition to Dr. Breall’s general failure to provide any facts supporting his\n\nconclusions, Dr. Breall also failed to make a good faith effort to comply with\n\nsection 74.351’s requirements. In his report, Dr. Breall fails to identify the standard\n\nof care applicable to Appellants. The standard of care for a health care provider or\n\na physician is what an ordinarily prudent health care provider or physician would\n\ndo under the same or similar circumstances. See Strom v. Mem’l Hermann Hosp.\n\nSys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1773634\"><a href=\"/opinion/1773634/strom-v-memorial-hermann-hosp-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (Tex. App—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).\n\nIdentifying the standard of care is “critical” because “[w]hether a defendant\n\nbreached his or her duty to a patient cannot be determined absent specific\n\ninformation about what the defendant should have done differently.” Palacios, 46\n\nS.W.3d at 880. From Dr. Breall’s report, Appellants cannot determine what,\n\nspecifically, they should have done differently in their care and treatment of\n\nAppellee.\n\n\n4\n   Also, without the relevant facts, the trial court either misapplied the law regarding the\nsufficiency of expert reports or inferred additional underlying facts to fill in gaps that the report\nitself left open. This amounts to an abuse of discretion. See Garrett, 232 S.W.3d at 176; Hebert,\n395 S.W.3d at 890.\n\n                                                16\n\f      As explained above, a good faith report must, at a very minimum: (1) inform\n\nthe defendant of the specific conduct called into question; and (2) provide a basis\n\nfor the trial court to conclude the claims have merit. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879. A\n\nreport cannot merely state the expert’s conclusions about the statutory elements. Id.\n\nat 879. “Rather, the expert must explain the basis of his statements to link his\n\nconclusions to the facts.” Bowie Mem’l, 79 S.W.3d at 52. As this Court recognizes,\n\n“[a] report that merely states the expert’s conclusions about the standard or care,\n\nbreach, and causation does not fulfill the two purposes of a good-faith effort.”\n\nHebert, 395 S.W.3d at 890.\n\n      In his report, Dr. Breall’s provides only a single, conclusory statement\n\nsetting forth his opinion on the standard of care: “The standard of care would have\n\nbeen to follow the orders of Dr. Kessler to stop the administration of Pradaxa.”\n\n(CR 44). However, Dr. Breall fails to identify the standard of care applicable to\n\nAppellants given the factual circumstances of this case. As provided above, Dr.\n\nBreall fails to set forth any facts indicating that Dr. Kessler’s order was\n\ncommunicated to anyone except Appellee. (Recall, Appellee admits that Dr.\n\nKessler “orders that Nancy stop her use of the drug Pradaxa”). (CR 6). In fact, Dr.\n\nBreall’s own report suggests Dr. Kessler did not communicate his order to Dr.\n\nGoswami by stating Dr. Goswami failed to appreciate the order. (CR 44). Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fBreall’s report fails to explain the standard of care when an order to stop a\n\nmedication is not communicated to other physicians and health care providers.\n\n      Moreover, since Dr. Breall failed to describe the factual circumstances\n\nsurrounding the prescription and administration of Pradaxa, he could not have\n\nidentified the applicable standard of care in this case. After all, the standard of care\n\nfor a health care provider or physician is what an ordinarily prudent health care\n\nprovider or physician “would have done under the same or similar circumstances.”\n\nSee Strom, 110 S.W.3d at 222. Since Dr. Breall did not contemplate the\n\ncircumstances surrounding this case, he could not have identified the standard of\n\ncare applicable to Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart.\n\n      Also, Dr. Breall’s report fails to attribute his standard of care opinion to any\n\nparticular defendant. “When a plaintiff sues more than one defendant, the expert\n\nreport must set forth the standard of care applicable to each defendant and explain\n\nthe causal relationship between each defendant’s individual acts and the injury.”\n\nTenet Hosps.

App.—Corpus\n\nChristi 2004, no pet.). “Collective assertions of negligence against various\n\ndefendants are inadequate.” Id.\n\n      In this case, Appellee filed suit against multiple defendants. Dr. Breall’s\n\nreport mentions three defendants, Dr. Kessler, Dr. Goswami, and Austin Heart.\n\nHowever, Dr. Breall made no attempt to explain the standard of care applicable to\n\neach defendant. Rather, Dr. Breall only provides one standard of care opinion and\n\nfails to explain to whom it applies. Dr. Breall’s collective statement is prohibited\n\nby Chapter 74 and Texas case law. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 74.351(a);\n\nTaylor, 169 S.W.3d at 244. Dr. Breall’s report effectively provides no standard of\n\ncare opinion with regard to Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart, and therefore, the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying Appellants’ motion to dismiss.\n\n            3.     Dr. Breall fails to explain how Dr. Goswami and Austin\n                   Heart breached the applicable standard of care.\n\n      Dr. Breall’s report also fails to explain how Dr. Goswami and Austin Heart\n\nallegedly breached their respective standards of care. Dr. Breall’s only stated\n\ncriticism against Dr. Goswami was that the order to stop Pradaxa “was not\n\nappreciated by her primary cardiologist, Dr. Vivek Goswami (who was in the same\n\ngroup as Dr. Kessler).” (CR 44). However, Dr. Breall does not define this alleged\n\n“failure to appreciate” as a breach of the applicable standard of care. In fact, Dr.\n\nBreall does not identify the standard of care for appreciating another physician’s\n\n                                        19\n\forder. Hence, Dr. Breall effectively provides no opinion that Dr. Breall breached\n\nthe standard of care.\n\n      Also, Dr. Breall does not explain how Dr. Goswami could have\n\n“appreciated” Dr. Kessler’s order. Once again, Dr. Breall leaves out necessary and\n\nvital facts to support this opinion. At no point does Dr. Breall’s report state that Dr.\n\nKessler communicated his March 27, 2012 order to Dr. Goswami. Rather,\n\nAppellee admits this order to stop taking Pradaxa was communicated to her. (CR\n\n6). Dr. Breall’s report again fails to link his conclusions to the facts in the case.\n\n      Moreover, Dr. Breall fails to explain what Dr. Goswami should have done\n\ndifferently had he been apprised of the order by another treating cardiologist.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Breall fails to explain what else Dr. Goswami should have done\n\nother than what Appellee admits Dr. Kessler did, which is to tell Appellee to stop\n\ntaking the Pradaxa. Dr. Breall’s report certainly does not state that Dr. Goswami\n\ncontinued to prescribe Pradaxa after Dr. Kessler’s order.\n\n      Again, Dr. Breall’s decision not to include supporting facts is not surprising\n\ngiven that the facts reveal that Appellee continued to refill a Pradaxa prescription\n\nthat predated Dr. Kessler’s March 27, 2012 order without any notice to Dr.\n\nGoswami. The report certainly does not explain how the facts establish Dr.\n\nGoswami breached the standard of care. As explained in Section II(C)(1) above,\n\nDr. Breall’s failure to provide facts to support his opinion mandates dismissal.\n\n\n                                           20\n\fJelinek, 328 S.W.3d at 540; Taylor, 320 S.W.3d at 578; Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1691362</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n*5–6. Dr. Breall’s report fails to provide any statement that Dr. Goswami breached\n\nthe applicable standard of care.\n\n       In regard to Austin Heart, Dr. Breall states Appellee “appeared to be\n\nobtaining refills for this medication authorized by nurses and staff of this same\n\nheart group who recommended discontinuing this medication (Austin Heart).” (CR\n\n44). However, this conclusory statement is a careful and calculated attempt to\n\nmischaracterize the facts by excluding vital information. In this statement, Dr.\n\nBreall noticeably fails to indicate the date in which Pradaxa refills were\n\n“authorized by nurses and staff” of Austin Heart. If Austin Heart’s nurses and staff\n\nauthorized the refills before Dr. Kessler ordered Appellee to stop taking the\n\nmedication, there could not have been a breach. Dr. Breall noticeably omits the\n\ndate in which Austin Heart employees allegedly authorized refills of Pradaxa.5\n\n       Without this vital information, the trial court could not have determined\n\nwhether Appellee’s claims have merit. Rather, in order to conclude the report was\n\nsufficient as to Austin Heart, the trial court needed to draw an inference that Austin\n\nHeart employees authorized refills of Pradaxa after Dr. Kessler’s March 27, 2012\n\n5\n Per Appellee’s Original Petition, Dr. Kessler ordered Appellee to stop taking Pradaxa on March\n27, 2012. (CR 6). The pharmacy records show that Appellee’s refill request was completed on\nMarch 16, 2012, eleven days before Dr. Kessler’s order. (CR 331). Appellee then used the\nprescription and refill requests, which predated Dr. Kessler’s order, to refill her Pradaxa on two\nseparate occasions. (CR 332–33). Again, Appellants include this information not for purposes of\ndetermining the sufficiency of the report but to illustrate why the underlying facts are important\nwhen analyzing an expert’s opinions.\n\n                                               21\n\forder. Yet, those facts are not provided in Dr. Breall’s report (most likely because\n\nthey are not the facts supported by the records or the witnesses in this case), and\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion in inferring these facts to find the report was\n\nsufficient.\n\n       Also, Dr. Breall’s supposed breach opinion again does not match a\n\ncorresponding standard of care opinion. Nowhere in Dr. Breall’s report does he\n\nprovide the standard of care for nurses and staff members who receive a request to\n\nauthorize prescription refills. (CR 43–44). Therefore, Dr. Breall’s breach statement\n\nis wholly insufficient to satisfy Chapter 74. In sum, Dr. Breall does not provide any\n\nstatement showing that Austin Heart’s nurses or staff breached the standard of\n\ncare, and the trial court abused its discretion in finding that Dr. Breall’s report was\n\nsufficient as to Austin Heart.\n\n              4.    Dr. Breall’s report fails to explain how an alleged breach in\n                    the standard of care by Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart\n                    caused Appellee’s injuries.\n\n       Dr. Breall’s report completely fails to explain how an alleged breach in the\n\nstandard of care by Dr. Goswami or Austin Heart caused Appellee’s injuries. As\n\nthe Supreme Court has recognized, “[a]n expert cannot simply opine that the\n\nbreach caused the injury. … Instead, the expert must go further and explain, to a\n\nreasonable degree, how and why the breach caused the injury based on the facts\n\npresented.” Jelinek, 328 S.W.3d at 539–40. Without this explanation, the trial court\n\n\n                                          22\n\fcannot conclude the claims have merit. Id.; see also Smith, 368 S.W.3d at 578\n\n(Austin Court reversing trial court’s denial of motion to dismiss after finding report\n\nfailed to provide facts explaining the causal link between alleged breach and the\n\noccurrence or injury); Kocurek v. Colby, No. 03-13-00057-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4179454</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n*4–5 (Tex. App.—Austin Aug. 22, 2014, no pet.). Here, Dr. Breall’s report fails to\n\nestablish a causal link between an alleged breach in the standard of care by\n\nAppellants and Appellee’s alleged injuries.\n\n      In regard to Dr. Goswami, Dr. Breall’s report only complains that Dr.\n\nKessler’s order to stop the medication was not “appreciated” by Dr. Goswami.\n\nHowever, as explained above, Dr. Breall fails to explain how Dr. Goswami’s lack\n\nof knowledge of Dr. Kessler’s order to stop taking Pradaxa caused Appellee to\n\ncontinue to take Pradaxa. Dr. Breall’s report does not provide any facts indicating\n\nthat Dr. Goswami knew of Dr. Kessler’s order or that, after Dr. Kessler ordered\n\nAppellee to stop taking Pradaxa, Dr. Goswami had any further contact with\n\nAppellee before her alleged injuries. Moreover, one would expect Appellee to\n\nfollow the order of her treating cardiologist (Dr. Kessler) without needing a second\n\ncardiologist (Dr. Goswami) to repeat the order. In short, Dr. Breall fails to explain\n\nhow any act or omission by Dr. Goswami led Appellee to continue to take Pradaxa.\n\n      In regard to Austin Heart, Dr. Breall’s only breach statement was that\n\nAppellee “appeared to be obtaining refills for this medication authorized by nurses\n\n\n                                         23\n\fand staff of this same heart group who recommended discontinuing this medication\n\n(Austin Heart).” But again, Dr. Breall fails to allege that Austin Heart’s employees\n\nauthorized refills of Pradaxa after Dr. Kessler’s order to stop. To make a causal\n\nconnection, Dr. Breall would need to establish that Austin Heart employees\n\nauthorized Appellee to obtain refills of Pradaxa after Dr. Kessler’s order on March\n\n27, 2012. Without this information, the trial court could not have concluded from\n\nDr. Breall’s report that an act or omission by Austin Heart employees caused\n\nAppellee to continue to take Pradaxa after March 27, 2012.6\n\n       As this Court recently noted in Smith v. Wilson, an expert must explain, with\n\nsupporting facts, how each defendant’s alleged breach in the standard of care\n\ncaused the injury in question. 368 S.W.3d at 577–78. A conclusory statement on\n\ncausation is wholly insufficient. Id. Dr. Breall’s report offers no explanation or\n\nfacts explaining the causal link between alleged breaches in the standard of care by\n\nAppellants and Appellee’s continued use of Pradaxa. Hence, Dr. Breall’s report\n\nfails to satisfy the requirements of section 74.351.\n\n       Furthermore, Dr. Breall fails to explain how Appellee’s ingestion of Pradaxa\n\nbetween March 27, 2012 and her hospitalization in July of 2012 caused the injuries\n\n6\n  Further, Dr. Breall cannot satisfy the causation element by offering mere possibilities.

Dr. Breall states Appellee “appeared to be obtaining refills for [Pradaxa] authorized\nby” Austin Heart employees. (CR 44) (emphasis added). This language indicates Dr. Breall is\nsimply guessing that Austin Heart employees authorized refills for Appellee.\n\n                                                24\n\falleged in his report -- hypertension, acute kidney injury, and apparent\n\ngastrointestinal bleeding. Rather, Dr. Breall simply states, without any explanation,\n\n“[f]ailure to discontinue the use of Pradaxa was a direct cause of her subsequent\n\nadmission to the hospital with hypotension, acute kidney injury and apparent\n\ngastrointestinal bleeding.” (CR 44). Dr. Breall provides no explanation or factual\n\nsupport for this conclusion as to how Appellee’s ingestion of Pradaxa over a two\n\nmonth period caused these physical injuries. Conclusory statements on causation\n\nwill not satisfy Chapter 74’s expert report requirements. See Palacios, 46 S.W.3d\n\nat 875; Regent Care Ctr. of San Antonio II, Ltd. P'ship v. Hargrave, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761049\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761049/regent-care-ctr-of-san-antonio-v-hargrave/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2009, pet. denied).\n\n      Since Dr. Breall only offered conclusions about the statutory elements of an\n\nexpert report, the trial court had “no discretion but to conclude ... that the report\n\ndoes not represent a good-faith effort” to satisfy the statute. Smith, 368 S.W.3d at\n\n577. Nonetheless, the trial court in this case found that Dr. Breall’s report was\n\n“adequate under Chapter 74” and denied Appellants’ objections and motion to\n\ndismiss. (CR 344, 365–66). The trial court’s ruling amounted to an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Smith, 368 S.W.3d at 577. Appellants request that this Court reverse\n\nand the trial court’s ruling and remand with an order to grant Appellants’ motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f      D.     By Serving A Report Like Dr. Breall’s, Appellee Effectively\n             Negates The Purpose Of Chapter 74’s Expert Report\n             Requirement.\n\n      As stated above, the purpose of section 74.351 is to prevent the filing of\n\nfrivolous lawsuits against physicians and health care providers in Texas. One of the\n\ncentral purposes of the expert report is to provide a basis for the trial court to\n\nconclude the claims have merit. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879. Stated otherwise, the\n\nreport should let the trial court know the claims are not frivolous. When an expert\n\nreport conceals the relevant facts and provides only baseless conclusions on the\n\nthree elements of a health care liability claim, a plaintiff effectively negates the\n\npurpose of the expert report requirement and circumvents section 74.351.\n\n      This is precisely what Appellee has done in this case. Dr. Breall’s report\n\nconceals the relevant facts in hopes that his vague conclusions would hide the\n\nfrivolous nature of Appellee’s claims. If the trial court’s decision is upheld, the\n\npurposes behind Chapter 74 will effectively be nullified and claimants would likely\n\nuse this Court’s decision to file frivolous claims against physicians and health care\n\nproviders by simply ignoring the facts. This is certainly not what the Legislature\n\nintended when enacting Chapter 74 (formerly article 4590i).\n\n                          CONCLUSION & PRAYER\n\n      In conclusion, Dr. Breall’s report suffers from a number of fatal flaws. Dr.\n\nBreall provides absolutely no facts to support his conclusions on the applicable\n\n\n                                         26\n\fstandard of care, breach, and causation. Dr. Breall also fails to apprise Appellants\n\nof the specific conduct called into question so as to notify the trial court of what\n\nAppellants should have done differently in their care for Appellee. Moreover, Dr.\n\nBreall’s report fails to identify the standard of care applicable to each Appellant,\n\nfails to describe any act or omission by the Appellants that amounted to a breach in\n\nthat standard of care, and fails to show how any alleged breaches by Appellants\n\ncaused Appellee’s injuries. To the extent Dr. Breall does offer a limited opinion on\n\nany of these elements, he only offers baseless conclusions that do not even connect\n\nthe applicable standard of care with an alleged breach of that standard of care\n\nalong with a causal link. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion when\n\nholding that Dr. Breall’s report was “adequate” under Chapter 74 and denying\n\nAppellants’ motion to dismiss.\n\n      WHEREFORE,         PREMISES        CONSIDERED,        Appellants    respectfully\n\nrequest that this Court reverse the trial court’s order denying Appellants’ Chapter\n\n74 Motion to Dismiss and remand to the trial court with an order that all claims\n\nand causes of action asserted by Appellee against Appellants be dismissed with\n\nprejudice and that Appellants be awarded their reasonably attorneys’ fees and costs\n\nas allowed by Chapter 74 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\nAppellants further pray for such other relief that they may be justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f                                     Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                     SERPE, JONES, ANDREWS,\n                                     CALLENDER & BELL, PLLC\n\n\n                                     By:   /s/ Chris Knudsen\n                                           Chris Knudsen\n                                           Texas Bar No. 24041268\n                                           cknudsen@serpejones.com\n                                     America Tower\n                                     2929 Allen Parkway, Suite 1600\n                                     Houston, Texas 77019\n                                     Telephone: (713) 452-4400\n                                     Facsimile: (713) 452-4499\n\n                                     Attorneys for Appellants Vivek Goswami,\n                                     M.D. and Austin Heart, PLLC\n\n                     CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n       I hereby certify that the foregoing Brief for Appellants is computer\ngenerated, has been prepared in a conventional typeface no smaller than 14-point\nfor text and 12-point for footnotes, contains 6,322 words according to word count\nfunction of the computer program used to prepare this Brief, excluding any parts\nexempted by TEX.

For these reasons,\nreport solely on the ground that it was “no report,” not                    I respectfully dissent.\nthat it was a “deficient report.”4 The difference between\nthe two is strategically significant. If the report is “no\nreport,” then the trial court must dismiss the case with\n\nFootnotes\n1      These included records of five physicians, three hospitals, and a clinic.\n\n2      In their brief, the Webbs state that the email response was actually by Dr. Kessler rather than Dr. Rodgers and the reference in\n       the report is a typographical error. However, there is no evidence in the record on this point other than Dr. Cororve’s report.\n3      The report does not mention who was responsible for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic stimulation or placing a new right\n       ventricular lead.\n4      Austin Heart, P.A. is alleged to be vicariously liable for the conduct of Dr. Kessler. Dr. Cororve’s report notes at the outset that\n       “[a]ny reference in this report to David J. Kessler, M.D. refers to Dr. Kessler individually, and his employer, Austin Heart,\n       P.A.” Consequently, for the purposes of this appeal, the report must link Dr. Cororve’s opinions to the actions of Dr. Kessler.\n5      The Webbs suggest that a tally of the number of times a physician is mentioned in a report is significant. They note that Dr.\n       Kessler’s name appears eleven times in Dr. Cororve’s report (as opposed to three times for Dr. Rodgers and once for “various\n       physicians”). They argue that this could lead to a reasonable conclusion that the report must be about Dr. Kessler and his\n       actions. However, we are not persuaded that such a tally is relevant to the analysis. A physician may be named in a report any\n       number of times simply because he was intimately involved in the treatment of a patient, yet the complaint may be with the\n       conduct of a physician who saw the patient only once and is mentioned in the report only once.

Under the\n      previous iteration of the statute, the trial court could grant an extension only if it found that the failure to comply with the statute\n      was “not intentional or the result of conscious indifference but was the result of an accident or mistake.” See former\n      Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, § 13.01(g) repealed by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 204, § 10.09, eff. Sept. 1, 2003. The\n      Jernigan opinion does not discuss the application of this standard, the trial court’s failure to grant an extension under this\n      standard, or whether the trial court could have considered such an extension if it had made such findings. Thus, the Jernigan\n      opinion is distinguishable from this case on this basis alone. However, even if the trial court’s discretion to dismiss claims under\n      either version of the statute is viewed as the same, the expert report in Jernigan would still constitute “no report” for the\n      purposes of dismissal under either version of the statute.\n8     The dissent argues that by remanding to allow the trial court to consider whether a section 74.351(c) extension is appropriate we\n      are granting Dr. Kessler and Austin Heart more relief than they requested or are entitled to. The dissent’s theory is that there is a\n      distinction under section 74.351 between (1) seeking dismissal on the basis that no report was served and (2) seeking dismissal\n      on the basis that a report was served, but it does not meet the requirements of the statute and is deficient. According to the\n      dissent, if a defendant seeks dismissal only on the basis that no report was served, then dismissal is not appropriate if the court\n      finds that a report, no matter how deficient, was served. There are two problems with this theory.\n         First, the dismissal mechanism of section 74.351 does not work the way the dissent suggests. Under section 74.351, a\n         claimant must serve an “expert report,” as defined in the statute, or be subject to dismissal. If a claimant does not serve a\n         report that complies with the statutory requirements, then the claimant has not served an “expert report” as defined in the\n         statute. Whether a claimant actually fails to serve a report at all or serves a deficient report the effect under section 74.351(b)\n         is the same—the claimant has failed to serve the required “expert report” and dismissal is the remedy. However, section\n         74.351(c) provides a potential cure period for situations where the claimant has served a report, but the report does not\n         constitute the required “expert report” because “elements of the report are found deficient.” The claimant then has an\n         opportunity to fix the defect in the report that was served. If there is a failure to cure the defect by the extended deadline, then\n         dismissal is mandatory because the claimant has failed to serve an “expert report” as defined in the statute.\n         While section 74.351(b) does not distinguish between a complete failure to serve a report and the failure to serve a complying\n         report, there is a distinction between the two for the purposes of 74.351(c). When a claimant fails to serve a report at all,\n         section 74.351(c) does not provide a basis for the trial court to grant any extension of the deadline for serving a report.\n         Consequently, dismissal is mandatory without any cure period. When a claimant serves a report, but it is deficient, section\n         74.351(c) gives the trial court the discretion to grant an extension to cure. Regardless of whether a claimant has failed to serve\n         a report at all or has served a deficient report, the statutory basis of the motion to dismiss by a defendant is the same—the\n         claimant has failed to serve an “expert report” as required by section 74.351(b). The fact that the claimant who files a\n         deficient report may request and receive an extension of time to cure the deficiencies does not alter the nature of the\n         defendant’s motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss is on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to serve an “expert report.”\n         Second, the defendants in this case did request dismissal on the basis that, while the Webbs had served a report that\n         mentioned Dr. Kessler, the report “fails to address the standard of care applicable to Dr. Kessler, the breach of the standard or\n         any alleged causal link.” This is an allegation that the report served was deficient. The defendants acknowledge that a report\n         was served and that the report addresses conduct of Dr. Kessler, but they claim it is deficient in failing to address the\n         statutorily required elements. They are aware that section 74.351(c) grants the trial court some discretion in allowing an\n         extension to cure certain deficient reports. But, they argue that the report in this case is so deficient that it should be viewed as\n         “no report,” requiring dismissal rather than remand for consideration of an extension period. By alleging that the deficiency is\n         severe enough to constitute “no report” the defendants are trying to avoid the possibility of a cure period. They are not\n         altering their claim that the report they received is deficient and will require dismissal if not corrected.\n         We have concluded that the report is deficient, but not so deficient as to constitute “no report.” Therefore, our options are (1)\n         reverse the trial court order denying the motion to dismiss and render judgment of dismissal or (2) reverse the trial court order\n         and remand for consideration of whether an extension should be granted to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to attempt to\n         cure. Remanding for the case to proceed on its merits, even though we agree with the appellants that the report is deficient, is\n         not an option.\n1     While Dr. Cororve’s report explicitly mentions Austin Heart, the Dallas court of appeals has held that when a defendant is only\n      alleged to be vicariously liable for the negligence of another defendant, the expert report need not specifically name or address\n      the negligence of the defendant to whom liability will be imputed.

In their brief on appeal, the Webbs assert that the report erroneously attributes the response to that e-mail as being\n      from Dr. Rodgers when it was actually from Dr. Kessler. There is, however, no evidence in the record indicating who sent the e-\n      mail.\n3     While it is true that the number of times a physician is named, by itself, does not indicate the report complains of that\n      physician’s conduct, it is more likely that a report discussing mainly the conduct of one physician is about the conduct of that\n      physician.\n4     The motion to dismiss clearly distinguishes the two scenarios, stating:\n          This is not an occasion in which a report was served on Austin Heart, P.A. or David J. Kessler, M.D. wherein the expert\n          failed to address a requisite element, such as the standard of care, the alleged breach of the standard, or the alleged causal\n          link, thus making the report deficient. Here, the report constitutes no report at all.\n        Thus, Austin Heart and Dr. Kessler did not, as the majority contends, “argue that the report in this case is so deficient that it\n        should be viewed as ‘no report.’ ”\n5     The remand fashioned by the majority grants Austin Heart and Dr. Kessler relief not requested because the majority treats their\n      motion to dismiss as if it were based on two grounds: (1) that the report was “no report” and (2) that even if the report was some\n      report that it was deficient. Austin Heart’s and Dr. Kessler’s motion, however, was based solely on the first ground. Without a\n      motion to dismiss based on deficiency, there is no basis for a finding of deficiency and no need for a 30–day extension “to cure\n      the deficiency.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 74.351(c).\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The report described various deviations from the standard of care, including\n        failures to properly address deep venous thrombosis prevention or to insert an IVC filter, but did not identify Dr. Russo by name\n        or otherwise. The panel observed that “[a]lthough appellant has sued only Dr. Russo, other doctors and health-care providers are\n        implicated by the facts set forth in the report. The report references other providers as well as their conduct and refers to another\n        doctor by name, but fails to mention Dr. Russo at all.” Id. at 257.

See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\n      Ann. § 74.351(s), (u) (West Supp.2007). However, while the appellees may not have established that section 74.351’s discovery\n      limitations prevented them from serving a sufficient expert report, they have also not been given any opportunity to cure\n      deficiencies in Dr. Adame’s report, which, until this Court’s holding on appeal, had been deemed sufficient as to Dr. Bogar.\n2     In addition to arguing that Dr. Adame’s report constituted “no report,” Dr. Bogar also argues that Dr. Adame, a pathologist, was\n      not qualified to render opinions concerning the standard of care applicable to physical medicine rehabilitation physicians, such\n      as Dr. Bogar. While the majority does not address this contention in light of their holding that the expert report constituted “no\n      report” as to Dr. Bogar, I would hold that even if Dr. Adame is deemed unqualified to render an expert opinion in this case, the\n      appellees should still be afforded the opportunity to request the 30–day extension provided by section 74.351(c).\n         A similar argument regarding expert qualifications was made in Ogletree, in which the appellant asserted that a radiologist\n         was incapable of opining on the standard of care applicable to urologists.

Former article 4590i § 13.01\n       was replaced by Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 74.351, as amended.\n6      When asked if the lapsed prescriptions affected Casas’s hospital stay, Dr. Daller equivocated:\n          A. I think that it certainly did impact it. However, I cannot quantitate that because there are multiple variables that are\n          present in a clinical condition. Whether it lengthened her stay by one day, two days, three days, I cannot say that. What I\n          would say from a scientific standpoint is that for four and a half days she did not receive appropriate therapy. Had she\n          received the appropriate therapy then you would expect her length of stay to be shortened somewhat. To quantitate that, I\n          could not do that.\n          ....\n          A. Obviously, not receiving antibiotics is not going to shorten your stay. Therefore, if it impacted the stay it must have\n          lengthened it. (emphases added).\n7      Admittedly, anaerobic bacteria are hard to culture because they are averse to oxygen.\n\n8      Dr. Berkowitz testified:\n            I think that there are a number of things that can cause things smelling bad besides just infection. Tissue that dies doesn’t\n            smell good. There’s bacteria and products released by the dead tissue that don’t smell good.\n            And we know based on the pathology report of the cancer that they took out of her abdomen, that this had grown enough\n            that it was dying. In other words, it was probably outgrowing it’s [sic] blood supply and was starting to die. That in and of\n            itself can smell bad. Then you have a wound that is infected; although Candida itself does not typically smell bad, not like\n            something dead. It smells funky and people don’t like the way it smells. The wound itself when it wasn’t healing was\n            probably having some necrotic tissue, as well, or dead tissue that is in the wound. I’m sure that smelled bad, as well. And\n            they were never able to completely get rid of all that dead cancer tissue that was in her abdomen.\n            I think there’s a number of reasons why she would have had a bad smell, none of which can be explained by four or five\n            days of not getting Flagyl [or] Maxipime.\n9      In his dissent, CHIEF JUSTICE JEFFERSON argues that an expert report need not meet the legal sufficiency requirements\n       necessary to support a judgment and suggests that we hold it must. We agree that an expert report need not “meet the same\n       requirements as the evidence offered in a summary-judgment proceeding or at trial.” Palacios, 46 S.W.3d at 879. But, as we\n       stated earlier, the report must provide more than conclusory statements concerning applicable standards of care, breach of those\n       standards, and causation. See id. An expert report must instead, within its four corners, provide some explanation as to each of\n       these elements. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4590i § 13.01(r)(6); Wright, 79 S.W.3d at 52. The report here offered only a\n       conclusory statement concerning causation with no explanation as to how the lapse in antibiotic treatment resulted in longer\n       hospitalization, increased pain and suffering, or ultimately Casas’s death.\n10     In her dissent, JUSTICE LEHRMANN indicates that (1) she would remand the case to allow the Casases an opportunity to\n       show that their failure to present an adequate report was not intentional or the result of conscious indifference, and (2) Dr.\n       Jelinek should not be entitled to attorney’s fees and costs if the Casases can make this showing and submit an adequate report.\n       We note that the Casases did not request a remand of this nature, nor brief the attorney’s fees issue.
