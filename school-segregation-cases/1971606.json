Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n      Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nDavid S. Mackey, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nKevin E. Sharkey on appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 17, 1998\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  This case poses an interesting\r\nproblem of res judicata: does a dismissal with prejudice of a civil\r\nforfeiture action bar the subsequent criminal forfeiture of the\r\nsame properties by the same sovereign?  The district court ruled\r\nthat a civil dismissal has preclusive effect, and it thereby\r\nrebuffed the government's attempt to confiscate nine properties\r\notherwise forfeitable because of their connection to drug\r\ntrafficking and money laundering.  See 21 U.S.C.  853; 18 U.S.C.\r\n982.  On appeal, the government claims that the district court\r\nerroneously invoked the doctrine of res judicata.  We affirm.\r\n                     I. Background\r\nThe drug trafficking and money laundering activities that\r\nunderlay this case have no direct significance to the appeal, and\r\nwe therefore do not review the facts surrounding them in any\r\ndetail.  It suffices to say that a lengthy and lucrative drug\r\nbusiness operated by Richard DeCato earned him substantial cash\r\nresources that he used to purchase real estate and other items that\r\nhe usually put under the name of appellee Patrick Cunan or a Cunan-\r\ncontrolled company.  Cunan also was involved as owner of a business\r\nin New Hampshire through which DeCato allegedly laundered drug\r\nrevenues.\r\nIn late 1990 and early 1991, the United States filed three\r\ncivil actions seeking forfeiture of Cunan's business, State Scale\r\nCo., and eight parcels of real estate located in Maine.  The\r\ngovernment's complaints alleged that the Maine real estate had been\r\npurchased with proceeds from DeCato's illegal drug trafficking and\r\nthat State Scale had been used to facilitate drug trafficking and\r\nmoney laundering, rendering the properties forfeitable under  21\r\nU.S.C.  881 and 18 U.S.C.  981, respectively.  Cunan, the named\r\nowner of the properties, filed claims for all of them.\r\nThe civil actions were pending when, in February 1993, DeCato,\r\nCunan, and Cunan's wife, Patricia, were indicted by a federal grand\r\njury sitting in Boston on charges of violating federal drug laws,\r\nconspiracy and money laundering.  Count 5 of the indictment,\r\nagainst Patrick Cunan only, sought to forfeit his interest in State\r\nScale pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  982, which provides for criminal\r\nforfeiture when property has been linked to money laundering. \r\nCount 37 of the indictment, against DeCato only, sought forfeiture\r\nof his interest in properties constituting proceeds, or involved in\r\nthe facilitation, of illegal drug trafficking.  The eight Maine\r\nproperties at issue in the Maine civil proceedings were included.\r\nSix days after the return of the criminal indictment, the\r\nUnited States filed motions to dismiss the two Maine civil actions. \r\nThe government explained its action as follows:\r\n     The principal reason that Plaintiff seeks the\r\ndismissal is judicial economy; that is, the property\r\nwhich is the subject of this action is the same as that\r\nof the criminal action now pending in Massachusetts. \r\nRegardless of the outcome of this civil action, the\r\ncriminal indictment in Massachusetts will go forward to\r\ntrial on the merits.  Continued litigation in this action\r\nis therefore a waste of the Court's time.\r\n\nThe United States and Cunan, the only claimant in the two Maine\r\nproceedings, agreed to a dismissal with prejudice in the northern\r\nMaine case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1).\r\nIn the southern Maine proceeding, Cunan sought an opportunity\r\nto move for costs and fees before the action was dismissed.  The\r\ncourt denied his request and dismissed the action without\r\nprejudice, finding the dismissal \"to be in the best interests of\r\njustice and in accordance with consideration of judicial economy.\" \r\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2).  Cunan thereafter renewed his motion\r\nfor an opportunity to request costs and fees and also asked that\r\nthe dismissal be changed to \"with prejudice.\"  The government\r\nopposed the request for leave to move for costs and fees, but took\r\nno position on whether the dismissal should be granted with or\r\nwithout prejudice.  In April 1993, the court amended its previous\r\norder to make the dismissal \"with prejudice,\" but declined to\r\ndisturb its earlier ruling against costs and fees.\r\nIn November 1993, the Cunans moved in the Massachusetts\r\ncriminal case to dismiss the eight Maine properties from Count 37,\r\narguing that the voluntary dismissals with prejudice in the civil\r\nproceedings barred the United States, on the ground of resjudicata, from attempting to forfeit those same assets in the\r\ncriminal case.  The Massachusetts district court granted their\r\nrequest, but this court later vacated its order as premature.  SeeUnited States v. Real Property in Waterboro, 64 F.3d 752, 756 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).  We held that the Cunans were obliged to wait until an\r\norder of forfeiture was entered before advancing their claim\r\npreclusion argument.\r\nMeanwhile, the New Hampshire civil forfeiture case involving\r\nCunan's business had taken a somewhat different course.  In May\r\n1992, the New Hampshire district court stayed the case \"pending the\r\nresolution of criminal proceedings, if any, against claimant.\"  In\r\nDecember 1994, the district court issued an order stating that it\r\nwould not continue the stay beyond April 1995.  The United States\r\nresponded by filing a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice. \r\nBy that time, the Massachusetts court in the criminal case had\r\nruled that res judicata principles barred the criminal forfeiture\r\nof the Maine properties, and so the United States advised the New\r\nHampshire court that \"a dismissal of this case with prejudice will\r\nbe held by the [Massachusetts] court to be res judicata . . . ,\r\npreventing forfeiture of State Scale, Inc. in that case.\"  The New\r\nHampshire court denied the motion without explanation and set the\r\ncivil case for trial.\r\nThis created two problems for the government.  First, the\r\ncriminal trial was scheduled to begin at virtually the same time,\r\nand prosecutors thus faced two trials involving the same actors and\r\nactions in different jurisdictions.  Second, Cunan filed notices in\r\nthe New Hampshire civil case seeking to depose government witnesses\r\nin the Massachusetts criminal case, potentially exposing key\r\ncriminal witnesses to questioning outside the criminal process.  To\r\neliminate these conflicts, the government moved to dismiss the New\r\nHampshire case with prejudice, asserting that\r\n[i]nasmuch as the property which the United States has\r\nsought to forfeit in the instant civil case is also\r\nsought to be forfeited in the criminal prosecution,\r\nPlaintiff has determined that continuation of the instant\r\ncivil case would expend unnecessary resources of the\r\nprosecution and of this Court.\r\n\nThe district court granted the motion on September 5, 1995,\r\nstating: \"I take no position as to the reasons for the dismissal\r\nwith prejudice or the merits of any claim for attorneys' fees that\r\nmay be made at some future time.\"\r\nAll three civil cases having been dismissed with prejudice,\r\nthe scene shifted fully to the criminal proceedings in\r\nMassachusetts.  DeCato pleaded guilty to various counts in the\r\nindictment, and admitted that the Maine properties listed in Count\r\n37 were purchased with proceeds linked to his unlawful conduct and\r\nthus were forfeitable.  The district court entered a forfeiture\r\norder against the eight parcels, and Cunan filed a now timely\r\npetition asserting a superior interest based on the Maine\r\ndismissals.\r\nSimilarly, following dismissal of the New Hampshire civil\r\ncase, Cunan filed a motion to dismiss the entire criminal\r\nindictment in Massachusetts on the grounds of double jeopardy and\r\nres judicata/collateral estoppel.  The motion was denied, the trial\r\nwent forward, and the Cunans were found guilty on all counts.  The\r\njury also returned a special verdict on Count 5 forfeiting Cunan's\r\ninterest in State Scale.  Cunan then renewed his motion to dismiss\r\nCount 5, and this time the district court granted it, ruling in\r\nJanuary 1996 that the final judgment in the New Hampshire case\r\nbarred the criminal forfeiture.  In February 1997, the district\r\ncourt again accepted Cunan's res judicata argument regarding the\r\neight Maine properties and granted his petition claiming priority\r\nto the parcels.\r\nWhen the dust settled, then, the government was left with\r\nsuccessful prosecutions -- DeCato having pleaded guilty and the\r\nCunans having been convicted by a jury -- and confirmation that the\r\nproperties at issue in this case were forfeitable -- through\r\nDeCato's admissions regarding the Maine parcels and the jury's\r\nfinding on State Scale -- but a ruling from the Massachusetts\r\nDistrict Court that negated the criminal forfeitures.  On appeal,\r\nthe government urges us to find that the district court erred in\r\ngiving preclusive effect to the civil forfeiture proceedings.\r\n                     II. Discussion              \r\nWe begin with a few basic principles.  First, the federal\r\ndoctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, bars a subsequent\r\naction whenever three criteria are met: (1) there is a final\r\njudgment on the merits in an earlier action; (2) \"sufficient\r\nidentity\" exists between the parties in the earlier and later\r\nsuits, and (3) \"sufficient identity\" exists between the causes of\r\naction in the two suits.  See Porn v. National Grange Mut. Ins.\r\nCo., 93 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1996); Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of\r\nAmerica, 924 F.2d 1161, 1165 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nSecond, a voluntary dismissal with prejudice is ordinarily\r\ndeemed a final judgment that satisfies the res judicata criterion.\r\nSee Lawlor v. Nation Screen Serv. Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 327 (1955)\r\n(judgment dismissing \"the previous suit 'with prejudice' bars a\r\nlater suit on the same cause of action\"); Langton v. Hogan, 71 F.3d\r\n930, 935 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"A judgment that is entered with\r\nprejudice . . . by stipulated dismissal . . . bars a second suit on\r\nthe same claim or cause of action.\"); Harrison v. Edison Bros.\r\nApparel Stores, Inc., 924 F.2d 530, 534 (4th Cir. 1991) (\"A\r\nvoluntary dismissal with prejudice under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2)\r\nis a complete adjudication on the merits of the dismissed claim.\");\r\n9 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp;\r\nProcedure  2376 at 319-320 (2d ed. 1995) (\"Dismissal with\r\nprejudice, unless the court has made some other provision, is\r\nsubject to the usual rules of res judicata . . . .\").\r\nThird, in defining a \"cause of action\" for purposes of resjudicata, the First Circuit adheres to a broad \"transactional\"\r\napproach that embraces \"'all rights of the plaintiff to remedies\r\nagainst the defendant with respect to all or any part of the\r\ntransaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the\r\naction arose.'\"  Manego v. Orleans Bd. of Trade, 773 F.2d 1, 5 (1st\r\nCir. 1985) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments  24 (1982));\r\nsee also Porn, 93 F.3d at 34.\r\nBecause it is undisputed that the Maine and New Hampshire\r\ncivil proceedings at issue here involved the same parties and ended\r\nwith final judgments, the applicability of res judicata to the\r\ncircumstances of this case turns on the third criterion noted\r\nabove: whether the civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings\r\ninvolved the same cause of action.  The district court concluded\r\nthat \"the causes of action are identical because they are aimed at\r\nthe forfeiture of the same properties.\"  The government contends\r\nthat that determination is overly simplistic and ignores\r\nsignificant differences between the two proceedings that render resjudicata inapplicable.  We review de novo the district court's\r\nruling.  See Gonzalez v. Banco Central Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st\r\nCir. 1994).\r\nProbably the most compelling of the government's arguments is\r\nthat, because of their very different natures, a prosecution and a\r\nclaim for a civil remedy are distinct causes of action that may be\r\npursued independently.  As a general matter, this assertion seems\r\nsupported by precedent and logic.  Ample authority is available for\r\nthe proposition that \"civil and criminal proceedings, although\r\nbased upon the same facts, do not involve the same cause of action,\r\n[and] a judgment in one proceeding is not res judicata . . . in the\r\nother proceeding.\"  1B Moore's Federal Practice 0.418 [1] (2d ed.\r\n1993); see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments  85 (comment a)\r\n(\"A prosecution and a claim for a civil remedy are regarded as\r\nseparate causes of action that may be independently pursued. . .\r\n.\"); 18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper,\r\nFederal Practice &amp; Procedure  4474, at 748 (1981) (\"Wright &amp;\r\nMiller) (\"Claim preclusion does not extend from criminal\r\nprosecutions to civil actions.\"); United States v. Parcels of Real\r\nProperty, 913 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1990) (rejecting defendant's\r\nargument that his state narcotics convictions should have no\r\ncollateral estoppel effect, in part because they were on appeal,\r\nbecause, inter alia, civil forfeiture proceeding is independent of\r\nrelated criminal prosecution); United States v. Mumford, 630 F.2d\r\n1023, 1027 (4th Cir. 1980) (res judicata inapplicable between SEC\r\nproceeding for injunctive relief and criminal convictions).\r\nThe logic behind the dichotomy is easy to understand.  Because\r\ncriminal and civil remedies cannot be pursued in the same\r\nproceeding, it would seem unjust for the failure to seek both at\r\nthe same time to trigger res judicata consequences.  See 18 Wright\r\n&amp; Miller  4407, at 51 (\"[C]laim preclusion cannot extend beyond\r\nthe limits of an action that can be brought before a single\r\ncourt.\"); id. at  4474, at 748 (\"Our traditional division between\r\ncivil and criminal procedure does not contemplate any opportunity\r\nfor joining any civil claim with the criminal prosecution.\");\r\nMassachusetts School of Law at Andover v. American Bar Ass'n, 142\r\nF.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[R]es judicata will not attach if the\r\nclaim asserted in the second suit could not have been asserted in\r\nthe first.\"); Kale, 924 F.2d at 1167-68 (well settled exception to\r\ntransactional test where plaintiff unable to seek certain remedy or\r\nform of relief in the first action because of restrictions on the\r\ncourt's authority); Pasterczyk v. Fair, 819 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir.\r\n1987).  Thus, while the transactional test may be broad enough to\r\ncover both a civil action and a criminal prosecution arising from\r\nthe same series of events, the barrier imposed by jurisdiction\r\nappears to require a loosening of res judicata's restrictions. \r\nThe support for segregating civil and criminal proceedings is\r\ninapt, however, in the specific circumstances present here.  None\r\nof the cases and treatises noted above dealt with a situation in\r\nwhich the civil and criminal actions sought precisely the same\r\noutcome, the forfeiture of the identical pieces of property.  The\r\ndistinction ordinarily is drawn between a prosecution for criminal\r\nconduct, punishable by incarceration, and a civil action that seeks\r\nto impose some other remedy or sanction.  Here, although the\r\nstructural criminal/civil difference remains, the substantive issue\r\nand the government's objective are the same in both settings. \r\nIndeed, the government's basis for dismissing the civil proceedings\r\nwas that they were duplicative of the criminal action.\r\nWhatever rationale exists for departing from the standard\r\ndefinition of \"cause of action\" to classify criminal and civil\r\nclaims separately certainly dissipates in these circumstances,\r\nwhere allowing the criminal forfeiture unquestionably would give\r\nthe government a second bite at the very same apple.  In this\r\nsetting, it seems illogical to abrogate the res judicata doctrine\r\nbased on the fact that the civil and criminal proceedings could not\r\ntake place in the same forum; by definition, these are alternative\r\npaths to the same goal, and if one proceeding leads to a final\r\njudgment that substantively resolves the property dispute,\r\nrevisiting the question in the other forum would present a classic\r\ncase of repetitive litigation.  Cf. Northern Natural Gas Co. v.\r\nGrounds, 931 F.2d 678, 683-84 (10th Cir. 1991) (in personam action\r\nfor attorney's fees and separate action for portion of a fees fund\r\nare on the same claim for res judicata purposes).\r\nIn addition to the distinction based on the available forum,\r\nthe government argues that criminal and civil forfeitures should be\r\ntreated as separate causes of action because the procedures\r\nincident to each are dissimilar.  It notes that conviction is a\r\nprerequisite for criminal forfeiture but not civil forfeiture, that\r\neach procedure has differing burdens of proof, and that, unlike in\r\nthe civil setting, if the property sought in a criminal action has\r\nbeen disposed of, the court can order forfeiture of any other\r\nproperty of the defendant up to the value of the missing\r\nforfeitable property.  See 21 U.S.C.  853(p).\r\nClaim preclusion does not require an exact match, however. \r\nSee Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, 142 F.3d at 38 (\"To\r\nbring claim preclusion into play, a cause of action need not be a\r\nclone of the earlier cause of action.\")  The relevant test simply\r\nasks whether the same parties pursued a remedy that arose from the\r\nsame \"transaction\" in an earlier proceeding that ended with a final\r\njudgment.  Minor variations in the proceedings -- for example, the\r\ndifference between an initial finding of forfeitability by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence in the criminal case and the probable\r\ncause finding in the civil case -- are insufficient to establish\r\nseparate causes of action.  Indeed, res judicata is intended to\r\nforeclose parties from multiple attempts to obtain relief for the\r\nsame harm through the use of new legal theories.  See Diversified\r\nFoods, Inc. v. First National Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 27, 30 (1st\r\nCir. 1993); Restatement (Second) of Judgments  24, comment c (same\r\nclaim involved even where \"several legal theories . . . would\r\nemphasize different elements of the facts, or would call for\r\ndifferent measures of liability or different kinds of relief\"). \r\nHere, the similarity in the burdens looms much larger than any\r\ndifferences; in both proceedings, a claimant must establish\r\npriority over the property by a preponderance of the evidence.\r\nSome differences in burden can, of course, be extremely\r\nimportant in analyzing the res judicata consequences of duplicative\r\ncivil and criminal proceedings.  If a criminal judgment ends\r\nwithout a conviction, and thus without a forfeiture of property,\r\nthe government may pursue the property through the civil\r\nproceeding.  United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465\r\nU.S. 354, 361 (1984).  This is permissible because a jury's\r\ndetermination that the charged crime has not been proved beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt does not foreclose the government from pursuing a\r\ncivil forfeiture based on the lower preponderance of the evidence\r\nstandard.  Id. at 361-62; United States v. Dunn, 802 F.2d 646, 647-\r\n48 (2d Cir. 1986).  A quite different dynamic is at play when the\r\ncivil proceeding has been resolved first, and the final judgment\r\nestablishes that the government has not met the less onerous\r\nburden.\r\nThe government offers several reasons why res judicata should\r\nnot be applied to this case even if the criminal and civil\r\nproceedings are deemed to constitute the same cause of action.  It\r\nmaintains that application of res judicata here would be\r\ninconsistent with the doctrine's underlying goals of conserving\r\njudicial resources and avoiding multiple lawsuits, conflict with\r\nthe district courts' intentions in dismissing the civil forfeiture\r\nactions, unfairly result in a windfall for the defendants, and\r\nfrustrate Congress's intentions in providing for forfeiture.  We\r\naddress each in turn.\r\nThe purpose of res judicata is to \"'relieve parties of the\r\ncost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial\r\nresources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage\r\nreliance on adjudication.'\"  Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Amertex\r\nEnterprises Ltd., 48 F.3d 576, 583 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Allenv. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980)).  The government says that it\r\nrequested dismissal of the civil action because of a concern about\r\njudicial economy and the logistical difficulties of pursuing the\r\ncivil and criminal proceedings in different locations at the same\r\ntime.  The government asserts that, if the criminal dismissals are\r\nnot reversed, it will be required in the future to pursue multiple\r\nproceedings in multiple forums to avoid the consequences of resjudicata.\r\nWe are unpersuaded that the interests underlying res judicataare best served in this case by re-activating the criminal\r\nforfeiture.  The United States Code specifically contemplates the\r\npossibility of duplicative forfeiture proceedings and provides a\r\nmechanism for a stay of the civil proceedings pending resolution of\r\nthe criminal case.  See 21 U.S.C.  881(i) (stay of civil\r\nforfeiture proceedings involving drug trafficking).  See also 18\r\nU.S.C.  981 (g) (stay of civil forfeiture proceedings involving\r\nmoney laundering).  This scheme appears to provide the government\r\nwith the best of both the civil and criminal structures: from the\r\ntime of the civil filing, the property sought by the government is\r\nrestrained, and if the subsequent criminal proceeding is\r\nunsuccessful, the government can resume its efforts to obtain the\r\nproperty civilly.  If the criminal forfeiture succeeds, the civil\r\ncase can be dismissed.\r\nThe New Hampshire district court did, in fact, stay the State\r\nScale forfeiture proceeding for three years, from May 1992 to April\r\n1995.  When the court announced that it would lift the stay and set\r\na trial date, the government made no request to extend the stay and\r\ninstead moved for a dismissal, first with prejudice and later\r\nwithout.  See supra at 5-6.  In Maine, Cunan had sought a stay\r\nrelatively early in the proceedings, but the government opposed the\r\nmotion and the district court denied it.  There, too, a stay,\r\nrather than dismissal, would have been a viable option once the\r\ncriminal indictment was filed. \r\nIt seems to us, based on this history, that the government had\r\navailable a possible method for avoiding duplicative proceedings,\r\nand the waste of its own and judicial resources, but chose not to\r\npursue it.  Cunan suggests that, in the Maine case, the original\r\nopposition to a stay was a deliberate tactical decision that\r\nenabled the government to move forward with civil discovery for\r\nthree years, at great expense to him.  Whatever the motivation, we\r\nare disinclined to grant the government a second opportunity to\r\nlitigate the same question, bypassing the normal operation of resjudicata, when it did not take advantage of an available mechanism\r\nto avoid this very problem.  It is the government's position, not\r\nCunan's, that seems at odds with the principles of claim\r\npreclusion.\r\nAs for the intentions of the Maine and New Hampshire district\r\ncourts, it appears that at least the Maine court contemplated that\r\nthe criminal proceedings would go forward when the civil\r\nproceedings were dismissed.  Both Maine and New Hampshire courts,\r\nhowever, granted dismissals with prejudice, presumably aware that\r\nsuch judgments are final for purposes of res judicata.  In the New\r\nHampshire case, in fact, the government initially requested a\r\ndismissal without prejudice explicitly because of the res judicataproblem, but the court denied the motion.  Rather than appeal, the\r\ngovernment then sought a dismissal with prejudice.  In granting it,\r\nas noted earlier, see supra at 6, the district court observed that\r\nit took \"no position as to the reasons for the dismissal with\r\nprejudice.\"  That court might have felt that the government was\r\nfree to tackle the res judicata problem in Massachusetts, if it so\r\nwished.  Moreover, even if either of the dismissing courts was\r\noperating on the assumption that res judicata would not bar the\r\ncriminal forfeiture, there is no dispute that they intended final\r\njudgments on the civil proceedings.  Any mistake by them about the\r\nres judicata effect of such judgments is not, we think, a basis for\r\nnegating the doctrine.\r\nNor is there a persuasive argument that fairness requires a\r\nreprieve from the normal operation of res judicata.  The government\r\nargues that barring the criminal forfeiture results in an unjust\r\nwindfall for the Cunans, and it points to our statement that this\r\ncourt has \"recognized the existence of judicial power to make an\r\n'occasional exception' to claim preclusion in order 'to prevent\r\nundue hardship.'\"  See Kale, 924 F.2d at 1168 (quoting Rose v. Town\r\nof Harwich, 778 F.2d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 1985)).  We are hard pressed\r\nto characterize this as a situation of \"undue hardship,\" and the\r\nSupreme Court has discouraged if not forbidden resort to equity as\r\na way of avoiding res judicata:\r\nThe doctrine of res judicata serves vital public\r\ninterests beyond any individual judge's ad hoc\r\ndetermination of the equities in a particular case. \r\nThere is simply \"no principle of law or equity which\r\nsanctions the rejection by a federal court of the\r\nsalutary principle of res judicata\" . . . .  We have\r\nstressed that \"[the] doctrine of res judicata is not a\r\nmere matter of practice or procedure inherited from a\r\nmore technical time than ours.  It is a rule of\r\nfundamental and substantial justice, 'of public policy\r\nand of private peace,' which should be cordially regarded\r\nand enforced by the courts . . . .\"\r\n\nFederated Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981)\r\n(citations omitted).  See also 18 Moore's Federal Practice \r\n131.12[3] (3d ed. 1998) (\"The doctrine of claim preclusion is not\r\nconcerned with whether . . . considerations of fairness should\r\nmerit a different result in the subsequent litigation. . . . The\r\nneed for final resolution of litigated claims often takes\r\nprecedence over concerns of fairness or justice in individual\r\ncases.\"); id. at  131.24[6] (\"The Supreme Court's decision in\r\nFederated Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie dooms to failure any attempt\r\nto avoid application of the claim preclusion doctrine on the\r\ngrounds that such application in a particular case is unfair,\r\nunjust, or unduly harsh.\").  Here, where the government had the\r\nopportunity to seek a stay of the civil proceedings pending\r\ncompletion of the prosecution, we see no equitable justification\r\nfor departing from basic preclusion principles. \r\nFinally, we reject the notion that the district court's\r\ndecision barring this forfeiture undermines Congress's effort to\r\ndeter drug trafficking through an attack on \"the economic aspects\r\nof these crimes.\"  See S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. Sec.\r\nI, reprinted in U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 3182, 3184.  While\r\nthe outcome of this case may be termed a windfall for DeCato and\r\nCunan, it does not put at risk either the mechanism of forfeiture\r\nor the choice available to the government to proceed through a\r\ncivil action, a criminal action, or both.  The government simply\r\ncannot evade the normal operation of res judicata when it litigates\r\na civil forfeiture case to final judgment.  The flexibility built\r\ninto the forfeiture scheme, entitling the government to a stay \"for\r\ngood cause shown,\" protects both the government's right to\r\nconfiscate property used for unlawful purposes and claimants'\r\nrights to be free from the \"cost and vexation of multiple\r\nlawsuits,\" Apparel Art Int'l, Ltd., 48 F.3d at 583.\r\nTwo circuits have indicated agreement, albeit in dicta, with\r\nthe view that res judicata applies to this factual scenario.  The\r\nEighth Circuit, in United States v. Maull, 855 F.2d 514 (8th Cir.\r\n1988), considered the dismissal of a civil forfeiture action by a\r\nColorado district court.  The notation did not indicate whether the\r\ndismissal was with or without prejudice.  The panel majority\r\nassumed that the dismissal was without prejudice, thus not a final\r\njudgment on the merits, \"and that res judicata did not bar the\r\ncriminal forfeiture proceeding.\"  Id. at 517.  Implicit in its\r\nruling is the conclusion that if the civil forfeiture dismissal hadbeen with prejudice, res judicata would have been applicable. \r\nJudge Richard Arnold, in dissent, was more explicit.  He disagreed\r\nthat the original judgment was without prejudice, and argued that\r\n\"[t]his adjudication must operate as a bar to the later assertion\r\nof the same claim.\"  Id.  He stated:\r\nHere, although the form of the later action was\r\ndifferent, criminal as opposed to civil, the same\r\nproperty was involved, the same claimants, and the same\r\nunderlying purpose: to deprive [the defendant] of the\r\nfruits of his crime.\r\n\nId.    \r\n\nA case factually related to Maull reached the Tenth Circuit\r\nthree years later.  In United States v. Lots 43 Through 46, 935\r\nF.2d 1134, 1137-38 (10th Cir. 1991), involving the same criminal\r\nforfeiture at issue in Maull, the court ruled that res judicataprinciples required it to accept earlier decisions on the resjudicata effect of the civil forfeiture proceeding.  The court,\r\nhowever, expressed its agreement with Judge Arnold's dissent:\r\n     If we were writing on a clean slate we would, in\r\nfact, be inclined to views about the case consistent with\r\nthe persuasive dissent of Judge Arnold . . . . [T]he\r\nColorado District Court's dismissal (which we agree with\r\nJudge Arnold should be viewed as with prejudice) of the\r\ncivil forfeiture proceeding in Colorado should have been\r\nheld to bar the subsequent criminal forfeiture proceeding\r\nin Missouri.\r\n\n935 F.2d at 1137-38.\r\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we, too, conclude that res judicata \r\nbars a criminal forfeiture following dismissal with prejudice of a \r\nprior civil forfeiture proceeding involving the same property.  We \r\ntherefore affirm the judgment of the district court.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

The district court ruled that a civil dismissal has preclusive effect, and it thereby rebuffed the government's attempt to confiscate nine properties otherwise forfeitable because of their connection to drug trafficking and money laundering.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853;  18 U.S.C. &#167; 982.  On appeal, the government claims that the district court erroneously invoked the doctrine of res judicata.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drug trafficking and money laundering activities that underlay this case have no direct significance to the appeal, and we therefore do not review the facts surrounding them in any detail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  It suffices to say that a lengthy and lucrative drug business operated by Richard DeCato earned him substantial cash resources that he used to purchase real estate and other items that he usually put under the name of appellee Patrick Cunan or a Cunan-controlled company.  Cunan also was involved as owner of a business in New Hampshire through which DeCato allegedly laundered drug revenues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1990 and early 1991, the United States filed three civil actions seeking forfeiture of Cunan's business, State Scale Co., and eight parcels of real estate located in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The government's complaints alleged that the Maine real estate had been purchased with proceeds from DeCato's illegal drug trafficking and that State Scale had been used to facilitate drug trafficking and money laundering, rendering the properties forfeitable under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981, respectively.  Cunan, the named owner of the properties, filed claims for all of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The civil actions were pending when, in February 1993, DeCato, Cunan, and Cunan's wife, Patricia, were indicted by a federal grand jury sitting in Boston on charges of violating federal drug laws, conspiracy and money laundering.  Count 5 of the indictment, against Patrick Cunan only, sought to forfeit his interest in State Scale pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982, which provides for criminal forfeiture when property has been linked to money laundering.  Count 37 of the indictment, against DeCato only, sought forfeiture of his interest in properties constituting proceeds, or involved in the facilitation, of illegal drug trafficking.  The eight Maine properties at issue in the Maine civil proceedings were included.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six days after the return of the criminal indictment, the United States filed motions to dismiss the two Maine civil actions.  The government explained its action as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal reason that Plaintiff seeks the dismissal is judicial economy;  that is, the property which is the subject of this action is the same as that of the criminal action now pending in Massachusetts.  Regardless of the outcome of this civil action, the criminal indictment in Massachusetts will go forward to trial on the merits.  Continued litigation in this action is therefore a waste of the Court's time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States and Cunan, the only claimant in the two Maine proceedings, agreed to a dismissal with prejudice in the northern Maine case.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the southern Maine proceeding, Cunan sought an opportunity to move for costs and fees before the action was dismissed.  The court denied his request and dismissed the action without prejudice, finding the dismissal \"to be in the best interests of justice and in accordance with consideration of judicial economy.\"   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2).  Cunan thereafter renewed his motion for an opportunity to request costs and fees and also asked that the dismissal be changed to \"with prejudice.\"   The government opposed the request for leave to move for costs and fees, but took no position on whether the dismissal should be granted with or without prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In April 1993, the court amended its previous order to make the dismissal \"with prejudice,\" but declined to disturb its earlier ruling against costs and fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1993, the Cunans moved in the Massachusetts criminal case to dismiss the eight Maine properties from Count 37, arguing that the voluntary dismissals with prejudice in the civil proceedings barred the United States, on the ground of res judicata, from attempting to forfeit those same assets in the criminal case.  The Massachusetts district court granted their request, but this court later vacated its order as premature.  See United States v. Real Property in Waterboro, 64 F.3d 752, 756 (1st Cir.1995).  We held that the Cunans were obliged to wait until an order of forfeiture was entered before advancing their claim preclusion argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the New Hampshire civil forfeiture case involving Cunan's business had taken a somewhat different course.  In May 1992, the New Hampshire district court stayed the case \"pending the resolution of criminal proceedings, if any, against claimant.\"   In December 1994, the district court issued an order stating that it would not continue the stay beyond April 1995.  The United States responded by filing a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice.  By that time, the Massachusetts court in the criminal case had ruled that res judicata principles barred the criminal forfeiture of the Maine properties, and so the United States advised the New Hampshire court that \"a dismissal of this case with prejudice will be held by the [Massachusetts] court to be res judicata ..., preventing forfeiture of State Scale, Inc. in that case.\"   The New Hampshire court denied the motion without explanation and set the civil case for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This created two problems for the government.  First, the criminal trial was scheduled to begin at virtually the same time, and prosecutors thus faced two trials involving the same actors and actions in different jurisdictions.  Second, Cunan filed notices in the New Hampshire civil case seeking to depose government witnesses in the Massachusetts criminal case, potentially exposing key criminal witnesses to questioning outside the criminal process.  To eliminate these conflicts, the government moved to dismiss the New Hampshire case with prejudice, asserting that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[i]nasmuch as the property which the United States has sought to forfeit in the instant civil case is also sought to be forfeited in the criminal prosecution, Plaintiff has determined that continuation of the instant civil case would expend unnecessary resources of the prosecution and of this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion on September 5, 1995, stating:  \"I take no position as to the reasons for the dismissal with prejudice or the merits of any claim for attorneys' fees that may be made at some future time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three civil cases having been dismissed with prejudice, the scene shifted fully to the criminal proceedings in Massachusetts.  DeCato pleaded guilty to various counts in the indictment, and admitted that the Maine properties listed in Count 37 were purchased with proceeds linked to his unlawful conduct and thus were forfeitable.  The district court entered a forfeiture order against the eight parcels, and Cunan filed a now timely petition asserting a superior interest based on the Maine dismissals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, following dismissal of the New Hampshire civil case, Cunan filed a motion to dismiss the entire criminal indictment in Massachusetts on the grounds of double jeopardy and res judicata /collateral estoppel.  The motion was denied, the trial went forward, and the Cunans were found guilty on all counts.  The jury also returned a special verdict on Count 5 forfeiting Cunan's interest in State Scale.  Cunan then renewed his motion to dismiss Count 5, and this time the district court granted it, ruling in January 1996 that the final judgment in the New Hampshire case barred the criminal forfeiture.  In February 1997, the district court again accepted Cunan's res judicata argument regarding the eight Maine properties and granted his petition claiming priority to the parcels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the dust settled, then, the government was left with successful prosecutions--DeCato having pleaded guilty and the Cunans having been convicted by a jury--and confirmation that the properties at issue in this case were forfeitable--through DeCato's admissions regarding the Maine parcels and the jury's finding on State Scale<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>--but a ruling from the Massachusetts District Court that negated the criminal forfeitures.  On appeal, the government urges us to find that the district court erred in giving preclusive effect to the civil forfeiture proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a few basic principles.  First, the federal doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, bars a subsequent action whenever three criteria are met:  (1) there is a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action;  (2) \"sufficient identity\" exists between the parties in the earlier and later suits, and (3) \"sufficient identity\" exists between the causes of action in the two suits.  See Porn v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 93 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir.1996);  Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of America, 924 F.2d 1161, 1165 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a voluntary dismissal with prejudice is ordinarily deemed a final judgment that satisfies the res judicata criterion.  See Lawlor v. Nation Screen Serv.  Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 327, 75 S.Ct. 865, 99 L.Ed. 1122 (1955) (judgment dismissing \"the previous suit 'with prejudice' bars a later suit on the same cause of action\");  Langton v. Hogan, 71 F.3d 930, 935 (1st Cir.1995) (\"A judgment that is entered with prejudice ... by stipulated dismissal ... bars a second suit on the same claim or cause of action.\");  Harrison v. Edison Bros. Apparel Stores, Inc., 924 F.2d 530, 534 (4th Cir.1991) (\"A voluntary dismissal with prejudice under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2) is a complete adjudication on the merits of the dismissed claim.\");   9 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2376 at 319-320 (2d ed.  1995) (\"Dismissal with prejudice, unless the court has made some other provision, is subject to the usual rules of res judicata....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, in defining a \"cause of action\" for purposes of res judicata, the First Circuit adheres to a broad \"transactional\" approach that embraces \" 'all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.' \"  Manego v. Orleans Bd. of Trade, 773 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24 (1982));  see also Porn, 93 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it is undisputed that the Maine and New Hampshire civil proceedings at issue here involved the same parties and ended with final judgments, the applicability of res judicata to the circumstances of this case turns on the third criterion noted above:  whether the civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings involved the same cause of action.  The district court concluded that \"the causes of action are identical because they are aimed at the forfeiture of the same properties.\"   The government contends that that determination is overly simplistic and ignores significant differences between the two proceedings that render res judicata inapplicable.  We review de novo the district court's ruling.  See Gonzalez v. Banco Central Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probably the most compelling of the government's arguments is that, because of their very different natures, a prosecution and a claim for a civil remedy are distinct causes of action that may be pursued independently.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  As a general matter, this assertion seems supported by precedent and logic.  Ample authority is available for the proposition that \"civil and criminal proceedings, although based upon the same facts, do not involve the same cause of action, [and] a judgment in one proceeding is not res judicata ... in the other proceeding.\"   1B Moore's Federal Practice p 0.418  (2d ed.1993);  see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 85 (comment a) (\"A prosecution and a claim for a civil remedy are regarded as separate causes of action that may be independently pursued....\");  18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 4474, at 748 (1981) (\"Wright &amp; Miller\") (\"Claim preclusion does not extend from criminal prosecutions to civil actions.\");  United States v. Parcels of Real Property, 913 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1990) (rejecting defendant's argument that his state narcotics convictions should have no collateral estoppel effect, in part because they were on appeal, because, inter alia, civil forfeiture proceeding is independent of related criminal prosecution);  United States v. Mumford, 630 F.2d 1023, 1027 (4th Cir.1980) (res judicata inapplicable between SEC proceeding for injunctive relief and criminal convictions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The logic behind the dichotomy is easy to understand.  Because criminal and civil remedies cannot be pursued in the same proceeding, it would seem unjust for the failure to seek both at the same time to trigger res judicata consequences.  See 18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, &#167; 4407, at 51 (\"[C]laim preclusion cannot extend beyond the limits of an action that can be brought before a single court.\");  id. at &#167; 4474, at 748 (\"Our traditional division between civil and criminal procedure does not contemplate any opportunity for joining any civil claim with the criminal prosecution.\");  Massachusetts School of Law at Andover v. American Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[R]es judicata will not attach if the claim asserted in the second suit could not have been asserted in the first.\");  Kale, 924 F.2d at 1167-68 (well settled exception to transactional test where plaintiff unable to seek certain remedy or form of relief in the first action because of restrictions on the court's authority);  Pasterczyk v. Fair, 819 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1987).  Thus, while the transactional test may be broad enough to cover both a civil action and a criminal prosecution arising from the same series of events, the barrier imposed by jurisdiction appears to require a loosening of res judicata 's restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The support for segregating civil and criminal proceedings is inapt, however, in the specific circumstances present here.  None of the cases and treatises noted above dealt with a situation in which the civil and criminal actions sought precisely the same outcome, the forfeiture of the identical pieces of property.  The distinction ordinarily is drawn between a prosecution for criminal conduct, punishable by incarceration, and a civil action that seeks to impose some other remedy or sanction.  Here, although the structural criminal/civil difference remains, the substantive issue and the government's objective are the same in both settings.  Indeed, the government's basis for dismissing the civil proceedings was that they were duplicative of the criminal action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever rationale exists for departing from the standard definition of \"cause of action\" to classify criminal and civil claims separately certainly dissipates in these circumstances, where allowing the criminal forfeiture unquestionably would give the government a second bite at the very same apple.  In this setting, it seems illogical to abrogate the res judicata doctrine based on the fact that the civil and criminal proceedings could not take place in the same forum;  by definition, these are alternative paths to the same goal, and if one proceeding leads to a final judgment that substantively resolves the property dispute, revisiting the question in the other forum would present a classic case of repetitive litigation.  Cf. Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Grounds, 931 F.2d 678, 683-84 (10th Cir.1991) (in personam action for attorney's fees and separate action for portion of a fees fund are on the same claim for res judicata purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the distinction based on the available forum, the government argues that criminal and civil forfeitures should be treated as separate causes of action because the procedures incident to each are dissimilar.  It notes that conviction is a prerequisite for criminal forfeiture but not civil forfeiture, that each procedure has differing burdens of proof, and that, unlike in the civil setting, if the property sought in a criminal action has been disposed of, the court can order forfeiture of any other property of the defendant up to the value of the missing forfeitable property.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(p).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claim preclusion does not require an exact match, however.  See Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, 142 F.3d at 38 (\"To bring claim preclusion into play, a cause of action need not be a clone of the earlier cause of action.\")   The relevant test simply asks whether the same parties pursued a remedy that arose from the same \"transaction\" in an earlier proceeding that ended with a final judgment.  Minor variations in the proceedings--for example, the difference between an initial finding of forfeitability by a preponderance of the evidence in the criminal case and the probable cause finding in the civil case--are insufficient to establish separate causes of action.  Indeed, res judicata is intended to foreclose parties from multiple attempts to obtain relief for the same harm through the use of new legal theories.  See Diversified Foods, Inc. v. First National Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1993);  Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24, comment c (same claim involved even where \"several legal theories ... would emphasize different elements of the facts, or would call for different measures of liability or different kinds of relief\").  Here, the similarity in the burdens looms much larger than any differences;  in both proceedings, a claimant must establish priority over the property by a preponderance of the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some differences in burden can, of course, be extremely important in analyzing the res judicata consequences of duplicative civil and criminal proceedings.  If a criminal judgment ends without a conviction, and thus without a forfeiture of property, the government may pursue the property through the civil proceeding.  United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U.S. 354, 361, 104 S.Ct. 1099, 79 L.Ed.2d 361 (1984).  This is permissible because a jury's determination that the charged crime has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt does not foreclose the government from pursuing a civil forfeiture based on the lower preponderance of the evidence standard.  Id. at 361-62, 104 S.Ct. 1099;  United States v. Dunn, 802 F.2d 646, 647-48 (2d Cir.1986).  A quite different dynamic is at play when the civil proceeding has been resolved first, and the final judgment establishes that the government has not met the less onerous burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offers several reasons why res judicata should not be applied to this case even if the criminal and civil proceedings are deemed to constitute the same cause of action.  It maintains that application of res judicata here would be inconsistent with the doctrine's underlying goals of conserving judicial resources and avoiding multiple lawsuits, conflict with the district courts' intentions in dismissing the civil forfeiture actions, unfairly result in a windfall for the defendants, and frustrate Congress's intentions in providing for forfeiture.  We address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of res judicata is to \" 'relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication.' \"  Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Amertex Enterprises Ltd., 48 F.3d 576, 583 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980)).  The government says that it requested dismissal of the civil action because of a concern about judicial economy and the logistical difficulties of pursuing the civil and criminal proceedings in different locations at the same time.  The government asserts that, if the criminal dismissals are not reversed, it will be required in the future to pursue multiple proceedings in multiple forums to avoid the consequences of res judicata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unpersuaded that the interests underlying res judicata are best served in this case by re-activating the criminal forfeiture.  The United States Code specifically contemplates the possibility of duplicative forfeiture proceedings and provides a mechanism for a stay of the civil proceedings pending resolution of the criminal case.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(i) (stay of civil forfeiture proceedings involving drug trafficking).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(g) (stay of civil forfeiture proceedings involving money laundering).  This scheme appears to provide the government with the best of both the civil and criminal structures:  from the time of the civil filing, the property sought by the government is restrained, and if the subsequent criminal proceeding is unsuccessful, the government can resume its efforts to obtain the property civilly.  If the criminal forfeiture succeeds, the civil case can be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire district court did, in fact, stay the State Scale forfeiture proceeding for three years, from May 1992 to April 1995.  When the court announced that it would lift the stay and set a trial date, the government made no request to extend the stay and instead moved for a dismissal, first with prejudice and later without.  See supra at 112-113.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In Maine, Cunan had sought a stay relatively early in the proceedings, but the government opposed the motion and the district court denied it.  There, too, a stay, rather than dismissal, would have been a viable option once the criminal indictment was filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us, based on this history, that the government had available a possible method for avoiding duplicative proceedings, and the waste of its own and judicial resources, but chose not to pursue it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Cunan suggests that, in the Maine case, the original opposition to a stay was a deliberate tactical decision that enabled the government to move forward with civil discovery for three years, at great expense to him.  Whatever the motivation, we are disinclined to grant the government a second opportunity to litigate the same question, bypassing the normal operation of res judicata, when it did not take advantage of an available mechanism to avoid this very problem.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  It is the government's position, not Cunan's, that seems at odds with the principles of claim preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the intentions of the Maine and New Hampshire district courts, it appears that at least the Maine court contemplated that the criminal proceedings would go forward when the civil proceedings were dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Both Maine and New Hampshire courts, however, granted dismissals with prejudice, presumably aware that such judgments are final for purposes of res judicata.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In the New Hampshire case, in fact, the government initially requested a dismissal without prejudice explicitly because of the res judicata problem, but the court denied the motion.  Rather than appeal, the government then sought a dismissal with prejudice.  In granting it, as noted earlier, see supra at 113, the district court observed that it took \"no position as to the reasons for the dismissal with prejudice.\"   That court might have felt that the government was free to tackle the res judicata problem in Massachusetts, if it so wished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Moreover, even if either of the dismissing courts was operating on the assumption that res judicata would not bar the criminal forfeiture, there is no dispute that they intended final judgments on the civil proceedings.  Any mistake by them about the res judicata effect of such judgments is not, we think, a basis for negating the doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there a persuasive argument that fairness requires a reprieve from the normal operation of res judicata.   The government argues that barring the criminal forfeiture results in an unjust windfall for the Cunans, and it points to our statement that this court has \"recognized the existence of judicial power to make an 'occasional exception' to claim preclusion in order 'to prevent undue hardship.' \"   See Kale, 924 F.2d at 1168 (quoting Rose v. Town of Harwich, 778 F.2d 77, 82 (1st Cir.1985)).  We are hard pressed to characterize this as a situation of \"undue hardship,\" and the Supreme Court has discouraged if not forbidden resort to equity as a way of avoiding res judicata:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>The doctrine of res judicata serves vital public interests beyond any individual judge's ad hoc determination of the equities in a particular case.  There is simply \"no principle of law or equity which sanctions the rejection by a federal court of the salutary principle of res judicata \"....   We have stressed that \"[the] doctrine of res judicata is not a mere matter of practice or procedure inherited from a more technical time than ours.  It is a rule of fundamental and substantial justice, 'of public policy and of private peace,' which should be cordially regarded and enforced by the courts....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981) (citations omitted).  See also 18 Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 131.12 (3d ed.  1998) (\"The doctrine of claim preclusion is not concerned with whether ... considerations of fairness should merit a different result in the subsequent litigation....  The need for final resolution of litigated claims often takes precedence over concerns of fairness or justice in individual cases.\");  id. at &#167; 131.24 (\"The Supreme Court's decision in Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie dooms to failure any attempt to avoid application of the claim preclusion doctrine on the grounds that such application in a particular case is unfair, unjust, or unduly harsh.\").  Here, where the government had the opportunity to seek a stay of the civil proceedings pending completion of the prosecution, we see no equitable justification for departing from basic preclusion principles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject the notion that the district court's decision barring this forfeiture undermines Congress's effort to deter drug trafficking through an attack on \"the economic aspects of these crimes.\"   See S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  Sec. I, reprinted in U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 3182, 3184.  While the outcome of this case may be termed a windfall for DeCato and Cunan, it does not put at risk either the mechanism of forfeiture or the choice available to the government to proceed through a civil action, a criminal action, or both.  The government simply cannot evade the normal operation of res judicata when it litigates a civil forfeiture case to final judgment.  The flexibility built into the forfeiture scheme, entitling the government to a stay \"for good cause shown,\" protects both the government's right to confiscate property used for unlawful purposes and claimants' rights to be free from the \"cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits,\" Apparel Art Int'l, 48 F.3d at 583.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuits have indicated agreement, albeit in dicta, with the view that res judicata applies to this factual scenario.  The Eighth Circuit, in United States v. Maull, 855 F.2d 514 (8th Cir.1988), considered the dismissal of a civil forfeiture action by a Colorado district court.  The notation did not indicate whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.  The panel majority assumed that the dismissal was without prejudice, thus not a final judgment on the merits, \"and that res judicata did not bar the criminal forfeiture proceeding.\"  Id. at 517.   Implicit in its ruling is the conclusion that if the civil forfeiture dismissal had been with prejudice, res judicata would have been applicable.  Judge Richard Arnold, in dissent, was more explicit. He disagreed that the original judgment was without prejudice, and argued that \"[t]his adjudication must operate as a bar to the later assertion of the same claim.\"  Id. He stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>Here, although the form of the later action was different, criminal as opposed to civil, the same property was involved, the same claimants, and the same underlying purpose:  to deprive [the defendant] of the fruits of his crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A case factually related to Maull reached the Tenth Circuit three years later.  In United States v. Lots 43 Through 46, 935 F.2d 1134, 1137-38 (10th Cir.1991), involving the same criminal forfeiture at issue in Maull, the court ruled that res judicata principles required it to accept earlier decisions on the res judicata effect of the civil forfeiture proceeding.  The court, however, expressed its agreement with Judge Arnold's dissent:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were writing on a clean slate we would, in fact, be inclined to views about the case consistent with the persuasive dissent of Judge Arnold....  [T]he Colorado District Court's dismissal (which we agree with Judge Arnold should be viewed as with prejudice) of the civil forfeiture proceeding in Colorado should have been held to bar the subsequent criminal forfeiture proceeding in Missouri.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">935 F.2d at 1137-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we, too, conclude that res judicata bars a criminal forfeiture following dismissal with prejudice of a prior civil forfeiture proceeding involving the same property.

We think this argument fails to give due weight to the procedure associated with criminal forfeiture.  Although criminal forfeiture is a form of punishment, see Libretti v. United States, 516 U.S. 29, 38-40, 116 S.Ct. 356, 363, 133 L.Ed.2d 271 (1995), it occurs only after a finding, usually by the jury, on a separate portion of a count charged against the defendant in the indictment.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(2) (\"No judgment of forfeiture may be entered in a criminal proceeding unless the indictment or the information shall allege the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture.\");  Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(e) (\"If the indictment or the information alleges that an interest or property is subject to criminal forfeiture, a special verdict shall be returned as to the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture, if any.\");  United States v.

Then, at an ancillary hearing, claimants other than the defendant have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they have an interest in the property superior to that of the defendant, or that they were bona fide purchasers for value without reason to know that the property was forfeitable.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(n)(6)</p>\n        <p>In a civil forfeiture case, which is an in rem action against the property, the government must first establish probable cause to believe that the defendant property is forfeitable.

The government knew at that point that the Massachusetts court would treat a final judgment on the civil forfeiture as res judicata, however, and a brief stay on that basis until after the about-to-occur criminal trial would seem to satisfy the statutory \"good cause\" for a stay.

Its motions were denied.

Cunan also was involved as owner of a business in New Hampshire through which DeCato allegedly laundered drug revenues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1990 and early 1991, the United States filed three civil actions seeking forfeiture of Cunan's business, State Scale Co., and eight parcels of real estate located in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The government's complaints alleged that the Maine real estate had been purchased with proceeds from DeCato's illegal drug trafficking and that State Scale had been used to facilitate drug trafficking and money laundering, rendering the properties forfeitable under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981, respectively.  Cunan, the named owner of the properties, filed claims for all of them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The civil actions were pending when, in February 1993, DeCato, Cunan, and Cunan's wife, Patricia, were indicted by a federal grand jury sitting in Boston on charges of violating federal drug laws, conspiracy and money laundering.  Count 5 of the indictment, against Patrick Cunan only, sought to forfeit his interest in State Scale pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982, which provides for criminal forfeiture when property has been linked to money laundering.  Count 37 of the indictment, against DeCato only, sought forfeiture of his interest in properties constituting proceeds, or involved in the facilitation, of illegal drug trafficking.  The eight Maine properties at issue in the Maine civil proceedings were included.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six days after the return of the criminal indictment, the United States filed motions to dismiss the two Maine civil actions.  The government explained its action as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal reason that Plaintiff seeks the dismissal is judicial economy;  that is, the property which is the subject of this action is the same as that of the criminal action now pending in Massachusetts.  Regardless of the outcome of this civil action, the criminal indictment in Massachusetts will go forward to trial on the merits.  Continued litigation in this action is therefore a waste of the Court's time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States and Cunan, the only claimant in the two Maine proceedings, agreed to a dismissal with prejudice in the northern Maine case.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the southern Maine proceeding, Cunan sought an opportunity to move for costs and fees before the action was dismissed.  The court denied his request and dismissed the action without prejudice, finding the dismissal \"to be in the best interests of justice and in accordance with consideration of judicial economy.\"   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2).  Cunan thereafter renewed his motion for an opportunity to request costs and fees and also asked that the dismissal be changed to \"with prejudice.\"   The government opposed the request for leave to move for costs and fees, but took no position on whether the dismissal should be granted with or without prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In April 1993, the court amended its previous order to make the dismissal \"with prejudice,\" but declined to disturb its earlier ruling against costs and fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1993, the Cunans moved in the Massachusetts criminal case to dismiss the eight Maine properties from Count 37, arguing that the voluntary dismissals with prejudice in the civil proceedings barred the United States, on the ground of res judicata, from attempting to forfeit those same assets in the criminal case.  The Massachusetts district court granted their request, but this court later vacated its order as premature.  See United States v. Real Property in Waterboro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703158\"><a href=\"/opinion/703158/united-states-v-real-property-in-waterboro-v-patrick-cunan-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 756 (1st Cir.1995).  We held that the Cunans were obliged to wait until an order of forfeiture was entered before advancing their claim preclusion argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the New Hampshire civil forfeiture case involving Cunan's business had taken a somewhat different course.  In May 1992, the New Hampshire district court stayed the case \"pending the resolution of criminal proceedings, if any, against claimant.\"   In December 1994, the district court issued an order stating that it would not continue the stay beyond April 1995.  The United States responded by filing a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice.  By that time, the Massachusetts court in the criminal case had ruled that res judicata principles barred the criminal forfeiture of the Maine properties, and so the United States advised the New Hampshire court that \"a dismissal of this case with prejudice will be held by the [Massachusetts] court to be res judicata ..., preventing forfeiture of State Scale, Inc. in that case.\"   The New Hampshire court denied the motion without explanation and set the civil case for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This created two problems for the government.  First, the criminal trial was scheduled to begin at virtually the same time, and prosecutors thus faced two trials involving the same actors and actions in different jurisdictions.  Second, Cunan filed notices in the New Hampshire civil case seeking to depose government witnesses in the Massachusetts criminal case, potentially exposing key criminal witnesses to questioning outside the criminal process.  To eliminate these conflicts, the government moved to dismiss the New Hampshire case with prejudice, asserting that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[i]nasmuch as the property which the United States has sought to forfeit in the instant civil case is also sought to be forfeited in the criminal prosecution, Plaintiff has determined that continuation of the instant civil case would expend unnecessary resources of the prosecution and of this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion on September 5, 1995, stating:  \"I take no position as to the reasons for the dismissal with prejudice or the merits of any claim for attorneys' fees that may be made at some future time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three civil cases having been dismissed with prejudice, the scene shifted fully to the criminal proceedings in Massachusetts.  DeCato pleaded guilty to various counts in the indictment, and admitted that the Maine properties listed in Count 37 were purchased with proceeds linked to his unlawful conduct and thus were forfeitable.  The district court entered a forfeiture order against the eight parcels, and Cunan filed a now timely petition asserting a superior interest based on the Maine dismissals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, following dismissal of the New Hampshire civil case, Cunan filed a motion to dismiss the entire criminal indictment in Massachusetts on the grounds of double jeopardy and res judicata /collateral estoppel.  The motion was denied, the trial went forward, and the Cunans were found guilty on all counts.  The jury also returned a special verdict on Count 5 forfeiting Cunan's interest in State Scale.  Cunan then renewed his motion to dismiss Count 5, and this time the district court granted it, ruling in January 1996 that the final judgment in the New Hampshire case barred the criminal forfeiture.  In February 1997, the district court again accepted Cunan's res judicata argument regarding the eight Maine properties and granted his petition claiming priority to the parcels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the dust settled, then, the government was left with successful prosecutions--DeCato having pleaded guilty and the Cunans having been convicted by a jury--and confirmation that the properties at issue in this case were forfeitable--through DeCato's admissions regarding the Maine parcels and the jury's finding on State Scale<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>--but a ruling from the Massachusetts District Court that negated the criminal forfeitures.  On appeal, the government urges us to find that the district court erred in giving preclusive effect to the civil forfeiture proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a few basic principles.  First, the federal doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, bars a subsequent action whenever three criteria are met:  (1) there is a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action;  (2) \"sufficient identity\" exists between the parties in the earlier and later suits, and (3) \"sufficient identity\" exists between the causes of action in the two suits.

Orleans Bd. of Trade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458606\"><a href=\"/opinion/458606/isaac-manego-v-the-orleans-board-of-trade-isaac-manego-v-the-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24 (1982));  see also Porn, 93 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it is undisputed that the Maine and New Hampshire civil proceedings at issue here involved the same parties and ended with final judgments, the applicability of res judicata to the circumstances of this case turns on the third criterion noted above:  whether the civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings involved the same cause of action.  The district court concluded that \"the causes of action are identical because they are aimed at the forfeiture of the same properties.\"   The government contends that that determination is overly simplistic and ignores significant differences between the two proceedings that render res judicata inapplicable.  We review de novo the district court's ruling.  See Gonzalez v. Banco Central Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195467\"><a href=\"/opinion/195467/gonzalez-abreau-v-banco-central/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, 755 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probably the most compelling of the government's arguments is that, because of their very different natures, a prosecution and a claim for a civil remedy are distinct causes of action that may be pursued independently.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  As a general matter, this assertion seems supported by precedent and logic.  Ample authority is available for the proposition that \"civil and criminal proceedings, although based upon the same facts, do not involve the same cause of action, [and] a judgment in one proceeding is not res judicata ... in the other proceeding.\"   1B Moore's Federal Practice p 0.418  (2d ed.1993);  see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 85 (comment a) (\"A prosecution and a claim for a civil remedy are regarded as separate causes of action that may be independently pursued....\");  18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Because criminal and civil remedies cannot be pursued in the same proceeding, it would seem unjust for the failure to seek both at the same time to trigger res judicata consequences.  See 18 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, &#167; 4407, at 51 (\"[C]laim preclusion cannot extend beyond the limits of an action that can be brought before a single court.\");  id. at &#167; 4474, at 748 (\"Our traditional division between civil and criminal procedure does not contemplate any opportunity for joining any civil claim with the criminal prosecution.\");  Massachusetts School of Law at Andover v.

Thus, while the transactional test may be broad enough to cover both a civil action and a criminal prosecution arising from the same series of events, the barrier imposed by jurisdiction appears to require a loosening of res judicata 's restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The support for segregating civil and criminal proceedings is inapt, however, in the specific circumstances present here.  None of the cases and treatises noted above dealt with a situation in which the civil and criminal actions sought precisely the same outcome, the forfeiture of the identical pieces of property.  The distinction ordinarily is drawn between a prosecution for criminal conduct, punishable by incarceration, and a civil action that seeks to impose some other remedy or sanction.  Here, although the structural criminal/civil difference remains, the substantive issue and the government's objective are the same in both settings.  Indeed, the government's basis for dismissing the civil proceedings was that they were duplicative of the criminal action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever rationale exists for departing from the standard definition of \"cause of action\" to classify criminal and civil claims separately certainly dissipates in these circumstances, where allowing the criminal forfeiture unquestionably would give the government a second bite at the very same apple.  In this setting, it seems illogical to abrogate the res judicata doctrine based on the fact that the civil and criminal proceedings could not take place in the same forum;  by definition, these are alternative paths to the same goal, and if one proceeding leads to a final judgment that substantively resolves the property dispute, revisiting the question in the other forum would present a classic case of repetitive litigation.  Cf. Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Grounds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559970\"><a href=\"/opinion/559970/northern-natural-gas-company-v-ralph-grounds-malcolm-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 683-84 (10th Cir.1991) (in personam action for attorney's fees and separate action for portion of a fees fund are on the same claim for res judicata purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the distinction based on the available forum, the government argues that criminal and civil forfeitures should be treated as separate causes of action because the procedures incident to each are dissimilar.  It notes that conviction is a prerequisite for criminal forfeiture but not civil forfeiture, that each procedure has differing burdens of proof, and that, unlike in the civil setting, if the property sought in a criminal action has been disposed of, the court can order forfeiture of any other property of the defendant up to the value of the missing forfeitable property.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(p).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claim preclusion does not require an exact match, however.  See Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, 142 F.3d at 38 (\"To bring claim preclusion into play, a cause of action need not be a clone of the earlier cause of action.\")   The relevant test simply asks whether the same parties pursued a remedy that arose from the same \"transaction\" in an earlier proceeding that ended with a final judgment.  Minor variations in the proceedings--for example, the difference between an initial finding of forfeitability by a preponderance of the evidence in the criminal case and the probable cause finding in the civil case--are insufficient to establish separate causes of action.  Indeed, res judicata is intended to foreclose parties from multiple attempts to obtain relief for the same harm through the use of new legal theories.  See Diversified Foods, Inc. v. First National Bank of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599289\"><a href=\"/opinion/599289/diversified-foods-inc-v-the-first-national-bank-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1993);  Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24, comment c (same claim involved even where \"several legal theories ... would emphasize different elements of the facts, or would call for different measures of liability or different kinds of relief\").  Here, the similarity in the burdens looms much larger than any differences;  in both proceedings, a claimant must establish priority over the property by a preponderance of the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some differences in burden can, of course, be extremely important in analyzing the res judicata consequences of duplicative civil and criminal proceedings.  If a criminal judgment ends without a conviction, and thus without a forfeiture of property, the government may pursue the property through the civil proceeding.  United States v.

The government says that it requested dismissal of the civil action because of a concern about judicial economy and the logistical difficulties of pursuing the civil and criminal proceedings in different locations at the same time.  The government asserts that, if the criminal dismissals are not reversed, it will be required in the future to pursue multiple proceedings in multiple forums to avoid the consequences of res judicata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unpersuaded that the interests underlying res judicata are best served in this case by re-activating the criminal forfeiture.  The United States Code specifically contemplates the possibility of duplicative forfeiture proceedings and provides a mechanism for a stay of the civil proceedings pending resolution of the criminal case.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(i) (stay of civil forfeiture proceedings involving drug trafficking).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(g) (stay of civil forfeiture proceedings involving money laundering).  This scheme appears to provide the government with the best of both the civil and criminal structures:  from the time of the civil filing, the property sought by the government is restrained, and if the subsequent criminal proceeding is unsuccessful, the government can resume its efforts to obtain the property civilly.  If the criminal forfeiture succeeds, the civil case can be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire district court did, in fact, stay the State Scale forfeiture proceeding for three years, from May 1992 to April 1995.  When the court announced that it would lift the stay and set a trial date, the government made no request to extend the stay and instead moved for a dismissal, first with prejudice and later without.  See supra at 112-113.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In Maine, Cunan had sought a stay relatively early in the proceedings, but the government opposed the motion and the district court denied it.  There, too, a stay, rather than dismissal, would have been a viable option once the criminal indictment was filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us, based on this history, that the government had available a possible method for avoiding duplicative proceedings, and the waste of its own and judicial resources, but chose not to pursue it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Cunan suggests that, in the Maine case, the original opposition to a stay was a deliberate tactical decision that enabled the government to move forward with civil discovery for three years, at great expense to him.  Whatever the motivation, we are disinclined to grant the government a second opportunity to litigate the same question, bypassing the normal operation of res judicata, when it did not take advantage of an available mechanism to avoid this very problem.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  It is the government's position, not Cunan's, that seems at odds with the principles of claim preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the intentions of the Maine and New Hampshire district courts, it appears that at least the Maine court contemplated that the criminal proceedings would go forward when the civil proceedings were dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Both Maine and New Hampshire courts, however, granted dismissals with prejudice, presumably aware that such judgments are final for purposes of res judicata.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In the New Hampshire case, in fact, the government initially requested a dismissal without prejudice explicitly because of the res judicata problem, but the court denied the motion.  Rather than appeal, the government then sought a dismissal with prejudice.  In granting it, as noted earlier, see supra at 113, the district court observed that it took \"no position as to the reasons for the dismissal with prejudice.\"   That court might have felt that the government was free to tackle the res judicata problem in Massachusetts, if it so wished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Moreover, even if either of the dismissing courts was operating on the assumption that res judicata would not bar the criminal forfeiture, there is no dispute that they intended final judgments on the civil proceedings.  Any mistake by them about the res judicata effect of such judgments is not, we think, a basis for negating the doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there a persuasive argument that fairness requires a reprieve from the normal operation of res judicata.   The government argues that barring the criminal forfeiture results in an unjust windfall for the Cunans, and it points to our statement that this court has \"recognized the existence of judicial power to make an 'occasional exception' to claim preclusion in order 'to prevent undue hardship.' \"   See Kale, 924 F.2d at 1168 (quoting Rose v. Town of Harwich, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461349\"><a href=\"/opinion/461349/leonard-j-rose-v-town-of-harwich/\"><span class=\"volume\">778</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.1985)).  We are hard pressed to characterize this as a situation of \"undue hardship,\" and the Supreme Court has discouraged if not forbidden resort to equity as a way of avoiding res judicata:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>The doctrine of res judicata serves vital public interests beyond any individual judge's ad hoc determination of the equities in a particular case.  There is simply \"no principle of law or equity which sanctions the rejection by a federal court of the salutary principle of res judicata \"....   We have stressed that \"[the] doctrine of res judicata is not a mere matter of practice or procedure inherited from a more technical time than ours.  It is a rule of fundamental and substantial justice, 'of public policy and of private peace,' which should be cordially regarded and enforced by the courts....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v.

While the outcome of this case may be termed a windfall for DeCato and Cunan, it does not put at risk either the mechanism of forfeiture or the choice available to the government to proceed through a civil action, a criminal action, or both.  The government simply cannot evade the normal operation of res judicata when it litigates a civil forfeiture case to final judgment.  The flexibility built into the forfeiture scheme, entitling the government to a stay \"for good cause shown,\" protects both the government's right to confiscate property used for unlawful purposes and claimants' rights to be free from the \"cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits,\" Apparel Art Int'l, 48 F.3d at 583.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuits have indicated agreement, albeit in dicta, with the view that res judicata applies to this factual scenario.

The notation did not indicate whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.  The panel majority assumed that the dismissal was without prejudice, thus not a final judgment on the merits, \"and that res judicata did not bar the criminal forfeiture proceeding.\"  Id. at 517.   Implicit in its ruling is the conclusion that if the civil forfeiture dismissal had been with prejudice, res judicata would have been applicable.  Judge Richard Arnold, in dissent, was more explicit. He disagreed that the original judgment was without prejudice, and argued that \"[t]his adjudication must operate as a bar to the later assertion of the same claim.\"  Id. He stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>Here, although the form of the later action was different, criminal as opposed to civil, the same property was involved, the same claimants, and the same underlying purpose:  to deprive [the defendant] of the fruits of his crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A case factually related to Maull reached the Tenth Circuit three years later.

The court, however, expressed its agreement with Judge Arnold's dissent:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were writing on a clean slate we would, in fact, be inclined to views about the case consistent with the persuasive dissent of Judge Arnold....

In that case, a panel of this court held that, \"for reasons peculiar to the civil injunction statute, a successful action brought under that statute does not preclude a later separate claim by the government for monetary relief.\"   The court concluded that the statutory goal of putting a \"speedy end\" to fraud schemes would be handicapped if the government was required to assert civil damage claims when it requested injunctive relief.  No equivalent interest is harmed by applying res judicata in this setting, where the stay provision, properly used, can avoid timing problems</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
