Troia\nAssistant County Prosecutor\nJustice Center, 9th Floor\n1200 Ontario Street\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\fMARY J. BOYLE, A.J.:\n\n       {¶1} Defendant-appellant, John Ferrell, appeals his conviction and sentence in\n\nconnection with five counts of rape, one count of gross sexual imposition, and two counts\n\nof kidnapping, involving two separate children — his daughter, K.O., and his niece, R.O.\n\nFinding some merit to the appeal, we affirm the convictions, reverse the sentence, and\n\nremand for resentencing.\n\n                               Procedural History and Facts\n\n       {¶2} In May 2013, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Ferrell on 16\n\ncounts — eight counts of rape, four counts of kidnapping, and four counts of gross sexual\n\nimposition. Eleven of the counts involved Ferrell’s daughter, K.O. (“daughter”) (d.o.b.\n\nJune 17, 1997), and the remaining five counts involved Ferrell’s niece, R.O. (d.o.b.\n\nDecember 19, 1994). The rape and kidnapping counts carried sexual motivation and\n\nsexually violent predator specifications.\n\n       {¶3} Ferrell pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the matter proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial. The state presented several witnesses at trial, including daughter and R.O., who\n\ntestified as to the sexual offenses that Ferrell committed against them.\n\n       {¶4} According to daughter’s testimony, Ferrell first inappropriately “touched”\n\nher and inserted his finger in her vagina when she was around five years old, sleeping\n\nover at her father’s house in Cleveland.       Approximately nine years later, Ferrell, a\n\ncommercial truck driver, committed several other sexual offenses against daughter at a\n\nrest stop in “New York or Pennsylvania” during one of his delivery trips where daughter\n\faccompanied him. The trip occurred in August 2011, prior to daughter’s start of her\n\neighth-grade year.\n\n      {¶5} Although daughter “never went on any truck trips” with Ferrell again, she\n\ndid not initially report the incidents because she was “scared.”        Daughter testified,\n\nhowever, that months following the New York trip, she told two of her cousins and then\n\nlater told R.O., her other cousin, who is more like a “sister.”     Daughter ultimately\n\nreported the incidents to her high school guidance counselor upon seeking advice on\n\nanother matter.      Daughter also revealed the earlier incident of her childhood when\n\nspeaking with her high school guidance counselor. The police and the Cuyahoga County\n\nDepartment of Children and Family Services (“CDCFS”) became involved immediately\n\nfollowing daughter’s reporting to the high school guidance counselor.\n\n      {¶6} Daughter was 16 years old at the time of the trial.\n\n      {¶7} According to R.O.’s testimony, daughter told her about the incidents with\n\nFerrell sometime in 2011 or 2012. In response to daughter’s revelations, R.O. stated,\n\n“Wow, that’s really messed up, and it happened to me too.” R.O. testified that Ferrell\n\n“molested me when I was younger.” Specifically, R.O. explained that Ferrell removed\n\nher from a bunk bed during the night and took her to the basement where he “licked” and\n\n“rubbed her vagina.” R.O. was only six or seven years old at the time and visiting her\n\ncousins at a house located in Cleveland, Ohio. R.O. further testified that, when she was\n\nseven and one-half years old, Ferrell took her into a bedroom and “rubbed his penis on\n\nher vagina.” R.O. recalled that the incident occurred when Ferrell and his girlfriend,\n\fRachel, were babysitting her at her home on Irma Avenue, also in Cleveland, and that\n\nRachel came into the room afterwards and taught her a prayer. R.O. testified that she\n\nfinally decided to come forward and report the incidents after daughter “ended up coming\n\nout with it.” The police interviewed R.O. shortly after interviewing daughter regarding\n\nthe allegations.\n\n       {¶8} R.O. was 18 years old at the time of the trial.\n\n       {¶9} Rachel Smith, Ferrell’s ex-girlfriend, testified that she remembered an\n\noccasion where she and Ferrell babysat R.O., and R.O. was in her bedroom with the\n\ncovers pulled up to her chin. Prior to seeing R.O. upset, Smith observed Ferrell exit\n\nR.O.’s bedroom, where the door had previously been closed. Smith testified that R.O.\n\nhad tears in her eyes and “looked sad.” After R.O. refused to tell Smith what was\n\nbothering her, Smith prayed with R.O.\n\n       {¶10} The state also presented several other witnesses, including daughter’s\n\nmother and siblings, who corroborated aspects of daughter’s testimony. The state further\n\noffered testimony to explain the police’s investigation and the treatment provided to\n\ndaughter and R.O. with respect to the CDCFS’s investigation of the allegations.\n\n       {¶11} At the close of the state’s case, the state moved to nolle two of the rape\n\ncounts and one count of gross sexual imposition relating to offenses involving the\n\ndaughter, for which the state failed to present evidence to support. The trial court\n\ngranted the motion and dismissed the counts.\n\n       {¶12} Ferrell offered no witnesses at trial.\n\f          {¶13} The jury ultimately convicted Ferrell of five counts of rape, one count of\n\nkidnapping, and one count of gross sexual imposition for acts that he committed against\n\nK.O. The jury further found Ferrell not guilty of rape against R.O. but guilty of the\n\nlesser included offense of gross sexual imposition and guilty of kidnapping and another\n\ncount of gross sexual imposition. Prior to sentencing, the state moved to dismiss the\n\nsexually violent specifications attached to the counts.\n\n          {¶14} At sentencing, the trial court merged as allied offenses the following\n\noffenses: Count 1 (rape) and Count 2 (kidnapping) — the state elected to proceed on the\n\nrape count; Count 7 (rape) and Count 11 (kidnapping) — the state elected to proceed on\n\nthe rape count; Count 12 (lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition), Count 13\n\n(gross sexual imposition), and Count 14 (kidnapping) — the state elected to proceed on\n\nthe kidnapping count; and Count 15 (gross sexual imposition) and Count 16 (kidnapping)\n\n— the state elected to proceed on the kidnapping count. The trial court imposed a prison\n\nterm on each count, ordering that the counts run consecutive for a total of 75.5 years in\n\nprison.\n\n          {¶15} Ferrell appeals, raising the following five assignments of error:\n\n          I. The jury found, against the manifest weight of the evidence, that the\n          appellant committed the acts alleged in the indictment.\n\n          II. Because there was insufficient evidence to show venue was proper, the\n          trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to dismiss counts three, four,\n          five, six, seven, and eleven as set forth in the indictment.\n\n          III. Offenses set forth in counts three, four, five, and six are allied offenses\n          of similar import and should have been merged for sentencing purposes.\n\f      IV. Appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of\n      Amendments VI and XIV, United States Constitution; and Article I, Section\n      10, Ohio Constitution.\n\n      V. The trial court erred by imposing consecutive sentences.\n\n                            Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n      {¶16} In his first assignment of error, Ferrell argues that his convictions are\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\n\n      {¶17} When an appellate court analyzes a conviction under the manifest weight\n\nstandard, it must review the entire record, weigh all of the evidence and all of the\n\nreasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in\n\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder clearly lost its way and created such a\n\nmanifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial\n\nordered. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). Under a\n\nmanifest weight standard, an appellate court sits as a “thirteenth juror” and may disagree\n\nwith the factfinder’s resolution of the conflicting testimony. Id. Although the appellate\n\ncourt may act as a thirteenth juror, it should give due deference to the findings made by\n\nthe factfinder. Id. at 388.    Only in exceptional cases, where the evidence “weighs\n\nheavily against the conviction,” should an appellate court overturn the trial court’s\n\njudgment. Id.\n\n      {¶18} Ferrell argues that the state’s entire case hinged primarily on daughter’s and\n\nR.O.’s testimony and that the lack of any physical evidence corroborating their testimony\n\nrenders the verdict against the manifest weight of the evidence.        He contends that\n\fdaughter and R.O., who are extremely close — “more like sisters” — were not credible\n\nand further implies that they conspired to fabricate the allegations against him.\n\n       {¶19} With respect to daughter’s credibility, Ferrell points to daughter’s testimony\n\nthat she accompanied him to New York to deliver the load on his semi-truck as being\n\ndirectly contradicted by other testimony that Ferrell never made a delivery to New York at\n\nthat time. He further argues that his delivery route did not allow time for him to pick up\n\ndaughter. Ferrell also contends that daughter’s credibility was also undermined by the\n\ncontradictory testimony between herself and her high school guidance counselor as the\n\nreason why she first sought out her guidance counselor. Daughter testified that she went\n\nto see her guidance counselor because of a rumor that daughter was sleeping with her\n\nbrother. Conversely, daughter’s guidance counselor testified that she had no recollection\n\nof daughter telling her that and would have remembered such an allegation.\n\n       {¶20} The weight to be given the conflicting evidence and the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses is for the trier of fact who had an opportunity to view the witnesses and observe\n\ntheir demeanor. Here, the jury was aware of these inconsistencies but obviously did not\n\nfind them to render daughter’s testimony completely unreliable. “Although we consider\n\nthe credibility of the witnesses in a manifest-weight challenge, we are mindful that the\n\ndetermination regarding witness credibility rests primarily with the trier of fact.” State v.\n\nSmith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100338, 2014-Ohio-2186, ¶ 18, citing State v. Clark, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 94406, 2010-Ohio-5600, ¶ 39.             Based on the other evidence\n\fpresented at trial, we cannot say that the jury lost its way in making such a credibility\n\ndetermination.\n\n       {¶21} For example, although daughter believed that her father’s work trip involved\n\na delivery in New York, the record reveals that he delivered a load to East York,\n\nPennsylvania at the time of the alleged offenses. Daughter acknowledged, however, that\n\nthe rest stop where the sexual offenses took place could have been in Pennsylvania.\n\nGiven daughter’s age and grade level, the jury could have reasonably found that daughter\n\nwas confused between East York, Pennsylvania, and New York at the time that she made\n\nthe trip. As for the trip actually occurring, daughter’s testimony was corroborated by her\n\nmother, who specifically testified that she remembered her daughter taking a “truck run”\n\nin August 2011 with her father before the start of school for “one-two nights.”\n\n       {¶22} Likewise, even if daughter’s stated reason at trial for seeking her guidance\n\ncounselor’s help contradicted with her guidance counselor’s recollection, that alone does\n\nnot require the jury to disregard daughter’s entire testimony, including the description of\n\nthe offenses.\n\n       {¶23} As for R.O.’s credibility, Ferrell fails to point to any inconsistencies or\n\nconflicting evidence in the record. Instead, he attacks her credibility based on her close\n\nrelationship with her cousin, the daughter.          We find this argument unpersuasive.\n\nNotably, the record contains no evidence of any motivation by the daughter or R.O.,\n\neither individually or collectively, to fabricate a story against Ferrell.\n\f       {¶24} Having considered the entire record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\n\nclearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice in finding Ferrell\n\nguilty. The first assignment of error is without merit.\n\n                                           Venue\n\n       {¶25} In his second assignment of error, Ferrell argues that the rape and gross\n\nsexual imposition counts involving his daughter, which allegedly occurred outside of\n\nOhio, should have been dismissed because the state failed to present sufficient evidence\n\nof venue.\n\n       {¶26} Ohio’s venue statute, R.C. 2901.12, provides that “the trial of a criminal\n\ncase in this state shall be held in a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, and in\n\nthe territory of which the offense or any element of the offense was committed.” R.C.\n\n2901.12(A). However, in recognizing the modern mobility of criminal offenders and the\n\ninterest of judicial economy, the statute further provides:\n\n       When an offender, as part of a course of criminal conduct, commits\n       offenses in different jurisdictions, the offender may be tried for all of those\n       offenses in any jurisdiction in which one of those offenses or any element\n       of one of those offenses occurred.\n\nR.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n     {¶27} Here, the state argued that all counts could be tried in Ohio because Ferrell\ncommitted the acts as part of a course of criminal conduct. R.C. 2901.12(H) defines,\namong others, the following as prima facie evidence of a course of criminal conduct:\n\n       (1) The offenses involved the same victim, or victims of the same type or\n       from the same group.\n\n       (2) The offenses were committed by the offender in the offender’s same\n       employment, or capacity, or relationship to another.\n\f       {¶28} Ferrell argues on appeal that he has no nexus to Cuyahoga County in Ohio\n\nto support his convictions for the offenses that allegedly occurred outside of the county.\n\nHe contends that he has overcome the state’s prima facie evidence of a course of criminal\n\nconduct by demonstrating a significant time lapse in between the offenses. He further\n\nargues that daughter had accompanied him on other truck driving trips where no\n\nwrongdoing took place, which occurred after the alleged incident in Cleveland but prior\n\nto the New York–Pennsylvania trip. According to Ferrell, these other trips constitute an\n\nintervening act that negate any claim of a course of criminal conduct.\n\n       {¶29} We find Ferrell’s arguments unpersuasive.         The counts that occurred\n\noutside of Ohio involved his daughter. He also committed the same act against his\n\ndaughter earlier in Cuyahoga County, as well as committing sexual offenses against R.O.\n\nin Cuyahoga County. Further, Ferrell facilitated the offenses against his daughter, both\n\nin Cuyahoga County and outside the county, while visiting and spending time with her.\n\nSee State v. Birt, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-02-031, 2013-Ohio-1379, ¶ 30\n\n(recognizing sufficient evidence of venue — rapes “were committed as a ‘course of\n\ncriminal conduct’ as the offenses each involved the same victim * * * and were\n\ncommitted in the same relationship, father-daughter”). Moreover, Ferrell picked his\n\ndaughter up in Cuyahoga County to take her on the road trip where the crimes were\n\ncommitted and then returned her to Cuyahoga County.             State v. Whitt, 5th Dist.\n\nCoshocton No. 10-CA-10, 2011-Ohio-3022 (venue satisfied in Coshocton County for\n\nrapes occurring in defendant’s semi-trucks out of state when evidence revealed that the\n\ftrips would originate in Coshocton County and defendant would return minor victim to\n\ndefendant’s home in Coshocton County).\n\n       {¶30} Based on this record, we find that the state presented sufficient evidence of\n\nFerrell’s nexus to Cuyahoga County to satisfy venue. The second assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                      Allied Offenses\n\n       {¶31} In his third assignment of error, Ferrell argues that the trial court should\n\nhave merged the three counts of rape (Counts 3, 4, and 5) and single count of gross sexual\n\nimposition (Count 6) for the offenses that occurred the first night in his semi-truck during\n\nthe out-of-state trip. We disagree.\n\n       {¶32} When a defendant’s conduct results in the commission of two or more\n\n“allied” offenses of similar import, that conduct can be charged separately, but the\n\ndefendant can be convicted and sentenced for only one offense. R.C. 2941.25(A). In\n\ndetermining whether offenses merge, we consider the defendant’s conduct. State v.\n\nJohnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 44. “If the multiple\n\noffenses can be committed by the same conduct, then the court must determine whether\n\nthe offenses were committed by the same conduct, i.e., ‘a single act, committed with a\n\nsingle state of mind.’”    Id. at ¶ 49, quoting State v. Brown, 119 Ohio St.3d 447,\n\n2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, ¶ 50 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting). If we answer both\n\nquestions affirmatively, then the offenses are allied offenses of similar import and will be\n\nmerged.      Johnson at ¶ 50; see also State v. Washington, 137 Ohio St.3d 427,\n\f2013-Ohio-4982, 999 N.E.2d 661, ¶ 13 (offenses of similar import do not merge if the\n\noffenses at issue “were committed separately or with a separate animus”).\n\n       {¶33} Focusing on the fact that these offenses occurred during the out-of-state trip,\n\nFerrell contends that the offenses were committed as part of the same transaction with a\n\nsingle state of mind, namely, “to assault [daughter] throughout the out-of-state trip.” We\n\nfind Ferrell’s argument misplaced.       The three separate counts of rape pertained to\n\nFerrell’s placing (1) his tongue inside daughter’s vagina, (2) his finger inside daughter’s\n\nvagina, and (3) his penis inside daughter’s vagina. The count of gross sexual imposition\n\nrelated to Ferrell’s touching daughter’s breasts. While these offenses all occurred close\n\nin time to one another, each offense involved different conduct. Accordingly, we find\n\nthat these offenses do not merge as allied offenses. See, e.g., State v. Accorinti, 12th\n\nDist. Butler Nos. CA2012-10-205 and CA2012-11-221, 2013-Ohio-4429, ¶ 16\n\n(recognizing digital penetration and vaginal intercourse “are two distinct types of sexual\n\nactivity, each constituting a separate crime”); State v. Trotter, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n97064, 2012-Ohio-2760, ¶ 45 (“Oral and vaginal rape are not allied offenses.”); State v.\n\nHudson, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 11 MA 77, 2013-Ohio-5529 (applying Johnson and\n\nrecognizing that gross sexual imposition and rape do not merge when defendant engages\n\nin separate conduct for each offense).\n\n       {¶34} The third assignment of error is overruled.\n\f                      Ineffective Assistance of Counsel and Joinder\n\n       {¶35} In his fourth assignment of error, Ferrell argues that his trial counsel was\n\nineffective for failing to move to sever the counts involving daughter from the counts\n\ninvolving R.O. We find no merit to this argument.\n\n       {¶36} To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1)\n\ndeficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of\n\nreasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that but for\n\ncounsel’s errors, the proceeding’s result would have been different.        Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); State v.\n\nBradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraphs two and three of the\n\nsyllabus.\n\n       {¶37} Ferrell contends that the joinder of the offenses involving daughter and R.O.\n\nwas prejudicial and improperly influenced the jury. He argues that the jury convicted\n\nhim simply because two different victims accused him of the same offenses and,\n\ntherefore, his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for the severance of the\n\noffenses.\n\n       {¶38} Under Crim.R. 8(A), two or more offenses may be charged together if the\n\noffenses “are of the same or similar character, * * * or are based on two or more acts or\n\ntransactions connected together * * * or are part of a course of criminal conduct.” State\n\nv. Woodson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 93476, 2010-Ohio- 5230, ¶ 9, citing State v. Diar,\n\n120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, ¶ 94. The law favors joining\n\fmultiple offenses in a single trial if the requisites of Crim.R. 8(A) are fulfilled. Id. If it\n\nappears, however, that the defendant would be prejudiced by the joinder, a trial court may\n\ngrant a severance under Crim.R. 14. Diar at ¶ 95.\n\n       {¶39} “A defendant is not prejudiced by joinder where the joined offenses are\n\n‘simple and direct, so that a jury is capable of segregating the proof required for each\n\noffense.’” State v. Wilson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20910, 2005-Ohio-6666, ¶ 38,\n\nquoting State v. Fletcher, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2003-CA-62, 2004-Ohio-4517, ¶ 41.\n\nLikewise, severance is not required if the evidence would have come in as other acts\n\nevidence under Evid.R. 404(B). Id.\n\n       {¶40} In deciding a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we must “indulge a\n\nstrong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\n\nprofessional assistance.” Strickland, 466 U.S. 668 at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d\n\n674.    “[T]hat is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the\n\ncircumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.” (Citation\n\nomitted.)   Id.    “Trial strategy, including debatable trial tactics, does not constitute\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.” State v. Benitez, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98930,\n\n2013-Ohio-2334, ¶ 31, citing State v. Conway, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848\n\nN.E.2d 810, ¶ 111. Indeed, the decision to file a motion for separate trials or to proceed\n\nwith the joinder of the offenses may be a matter of counsel’s trial strategy. Benitez at ¶\n\n31, citing State v. Bishop, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 53278, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 246, *9\n\n(Jan. 21, 1988).\n\f         {¶41} Here, we find that it is reasonable to presume that trial counsel’s decision\n\nnot to file a motion to sever the offenses was sound trial strategy. Defense counsel could\n\nhave reasonably believed that one trial would be the best strategy to try and persuade the\n\njury to return a verdict of not guilty on all counts of the indictment at the same time.\n\nIndeed, in his closing argument, defense counsel emphasized the close relationship\n\nbetween the two cousins, implying that they fabricated their stories against Ferrell and\n\nneither one was credible.       Specifically, defense counsel emphasized that R.O. was\n\ndaughter’s best friend, asking the jury to question “why [daughter’s] best friend, her\n\nbackup, comes to her aid and said yeah, happened to me too.” Moreover, even if defense\n\ncounsel had moved for severance, the trial court would have been well within its\n\ndiscretion in maintaining the joinder. See, e.g., State v. Scott, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n91890, 2010-Ohio-3057 (no ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to\n\nmove to sever counts of sexual offenses involving a second victim; no prejudice where\n\ntrial court is well within its authority to deny such a motion).\n\n         {¶42} Having found that defense counsel’s approach constitutes reasonable trial\n\nstrategy, we find no merit to Ferrell’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.          See\n\nStrickland at 689. The fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                    Consecutive Sentences\n\n         {¶43} In his final assignment of error, Ferrell argues that the trial court failed to\n\nmake the necessary findings to support the imposition of consecutive sentences. We\n\nagree.\n\f       {¶44} Judicial fact-finding is required to overcome the statutory presumption in\n\nfavor of concurrent sentences. State v. Bonnell, Slip Opinion No. 2014-Ohio-3177, ¶ 23.\n\n Indeed, “[i]n order to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment, a trial court is required\n\nto make the findings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) at the sentencing hearing and\n\nincorporate its findings into its sentencing entry * * * .” Id. at ¶ 37.\n\n       {¶45} Specifically, “R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires the trial court to make statutory\n\nfindings prior to imposing consecutive sentences, and Crim.R. 32(A)(4) * * * directs the\n\ncourt to state those findings at the time of imposing the sentence.” Id. at ¶ 26. First, the\n\ntrial court must find that “consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from\n\nfuture crime or to punish the offender.” R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). Next, the trial court must\n\nfind that “consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the\n\noffender’s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public.” Id. Finally, the\n\ntrial court must find that at least one of the following applies: (1) the offender committed\n\none or more of the multiple offenses while awaiting trial or sentencing, while under a\n\nsanction, or while under postrelease control for a prior offense; (2) at least two of the\n\nmultiple offenses were committed as part of one or more courses of conduct, and the\n\nharm caused by two or more of the offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison\n\nterm for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct\n\nadequately reflects the seriousness of the offender’s conduct; or (3) the offender’s history\n\nof criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the\n\npublic from future crime by the offender. Id.\n\f       {¶46} Here, the trial court made the first two findings but failed to make the third\n\nfinding to support the imposition of consecutive sentences. In attempting to make the\n\nfinding, the trial judge erroneously focused on the defendant’s history of criminal conduct\n\nrelated to the underlying charges — not his criminal conduct in general. However, given\n\nthat this case involves two victims, the possibility exists for the trial court to make\n\nanother finding to support the imposition of consecutive sentences, and therefore we must\n\nremand for the trial court to consider the remaining factors of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). But\n\nthe trial court is free to impose concurrent sentences if it does not find that consecutive\n\nsentences are appropriate.\n\n       {¶47} We further note that the sentencing hearing on remand is limited to the trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the imposition of consecutive sentences. See State v. Holdcroft,\n\n137 Ohio St.3d 526, 531, 2013-Ohio-5014, 1 N.E.3d 382, ¶ 9 (“the defendant and the\n\nstate may challenge any aspect of the sentence and sentencing hearing, and the appellate\n\ncourt is authorized to modify the sentence or remand for resentencing to fix whatever has\n\nbeen successfully challenged”). At the sentencing hearing, the trial court may determine\n\nwhether the facts and circumstances of the case warrant the imposition of consecutive\n\nsentences. State v. Johnson, 116 Ohio St.3d 541, 2008-Ohio-69, 880 N.E.2d 896, ¶ 20.\n\n       {¶48} The final assignment of error is sustained.\n\n       {¶49} Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the lower court\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n       It is ordered that appellee and appellant share the costs herein taxed.\n\f      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common\n\npleas court to carry this judgment into execution.

Breneman\n1220 West 6th Street\nSuite 303\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\n\nATTORNEYS FOR APPELLEE\n\nTimothy J. McGinty\nCuyahoga County Prosecutor\nBY: Margaret A. Troia\nAssistant County Prosecutor\nJustice Center, 9th Floor\n1200 Ontario Street\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\fMARY J. BOYLE, A.J.:\n\n       {¶1} Defendant-appellant, John Ferrell, appeals his conviction and sentence in\n\nconnection with five counts of rape, one count of gross sexual imposition, and two counts\n\nof kidnapping, involving two separate children — his daughter, K.O., and his niece, R.O.\n\nFinding some merit to the appeal, we affirm the convictions, reverse the sentence, and\n\nremand for resentencing.\n\n                               Procedural History and Facts\n\n       {¶2} In May 2013, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Ferrell on 16\n\ncounts — eight counts of rape, four counts of kidnapping, and four counts of gross sexual\n\nimposition. Eleven of the counts involved Ferrell’s daughter, K.O. (“daughter”) (d.o.b.\n\nJune 17, 1997), and the remaining five counts involved Ferrell’s niece, R.O. (d.o.b.\n\nDecember 19, 1994). The rape and kidnapping counts carried sexual motivation and\n\nsexually violent predator specifications.\n\n       {¶3} Ferrell pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the matter proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial. The state presented several witnesses at trial, including daughter and R.O., who\n\ntestified as to the sexual offenses that Ferrell committed against them.\n\n       {¶4} According to daughter’s testimony, Ferrell first inappropriately “touched”\n\nher and inserted his finger in her vagina when she was around five years old, sleeping\n\nover at her father’s house in Cleveland.       Approximately nine years later, Ferrell, a\n\ncommercial truck driver, committed several other sexual offenses against daughter at a\n\nrest stop in “New York or Pennsylvania” during one of his delivery trips where daughter\n\faccompanied him. The trip occurred in August 2011, prior to daughter’s start of her\n\neighth-grade year.\n\n      {¶5} Although daughter “never went on any truck trips” with Ferrell again, she\n\ndid not initially report the incidents because she was “scared.”        Daughter testified,\n\nhowever, that months following the New York trip, she told two of her cousins and then\n\nlater told R.O., her other cousin, who is more like a “sister.”     Daughter ultimately\n\nreported the incidents to her high school guidance counselor upon seeking advice on\n\nanother matter.      Daughter also revealed the earlier incident of her childhood when\n\nspeaking with her high school guidance counselor. The police and the Cuyahoga County\n\nDepartment of Children and Family Services (“CDCFS”) became involved immediately\n\nfollowing daughter’s reporting to the high school guidance counselor.\n\n      {¶6} Daughter was 16 years old at the time of the trial.\n\n      {¶7} According to R.O.’s testimony, daughter told her about the incidents with\n\nFerrell sometime in 2011 or 2012. In response to daughter’s revelations, R.O. stated,\n\n“Wow, that’s really messed up, and it happened to me too.” R.O. testified that Ferrell\n\n“molested me when I was younger.” Specifically, R.O. explained that Ferrell removed\n\nher from a bunk bed during the night and took her to the basement where he “licked” and\n\n“rubbed her vagina.” R.O. was only six or seven years old at the time and visiting her\n\ncousins at a house located in Cleveland, Ohio. R.O. further testified that, when she was\n\nseven and one-half years old, Ferrell took her into a bedroom and “rubbed his penis on\n\nher vagina.” R.O. recalled that the incident occurred when Ferrell and his girlfriend,\n\fRachel, were babysitting her at her home on Irma Avenue, also in Cleveland, and that\n\nRachel came into the room afterwards and taught her a prayer. R.O. testified that she\n\nfinally decided to come forward and report the incidents after daughter “ended up coming\n\nout with it.” The police interviewed R.O. shortly after interviewing daughter regarding\n\nthe allegations.\n\n       {¶8} R.O. was 18 years old at the time of the trial.\n\n       {¶9} Rachel Smith, Ferrell’s ex-girlfriend, testified that she remembered an\n\noccasion where she and Ferrell babysat R.O., and R.O. was in her bedroom with the\n\ncovers pulled up to her chin. Prior to seeing R.O. upset, Smith observed Ferrell exit\n\nR.O.’s bedroom, where the door had previously been closed. Smith testified that R.O.\n\nhad tears in her eyes and “looked sad.” After R.O. refused to tell Smith what was\n\nbothering her, Smith prayed with R.O.\n\n       {¶10} The state also presented several other witnesses, including daughter’s\n\nmother and siblings, who corroborated aspects of daughter’s testimony. The state further\n\noffered testimony to explain the police’s investigation and the treatment provided to\n\ndaughter and R.O. with respect to the CDCFS’s investigation of the allegations.\n\n       {¶11} At the close of the state’s case, the state moved to nolle two of the rape\n\ncounts and one count of gross sexual imposition relating to offenses involving the\n\ndaughter, for which the state failed to present evidence to support. The trial court\n\ngranted the motion and dismissed the counts.\n\n       {¶12} Ferrell offered no witnesses at trial.\n\f          {¶13} The jury ultimately convicted Ferrell of five counts of rape, one count of\n\nkidnapping, and one count of gross sexual imposition for acts that he committed against\n\nK.O. The jury further found Ferrell not guilty of rape against R.O. but guilty of the\n\nlesser included offense of gross sexual imposition and guilty of kidnapping and another\n\ncount of gross sexual imposition. Prior to sentencing, the state moved to dismiss the\n\nsexually violent specifications attached to the counts.\n\n          {¶14} At sentencing, the trial court merged as allied offenses the following\n\noffenses: Count 1 (rape) and Count 2 (kidnapping) — the state elected to proceed on the\n\nrape count; Count 7 (rape) and Count 11 (kidnapping) — the state elected to proceed on\n\nthe rape count; Count 12 (lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition), Count 13\n\n(gross sexual imposition), and Count 14 (kidnapping) — the state elected to proceed on\n\nthe kidnapping count; and Count 15 (gross sexual imposition) and Count 16 (kidnapping)\n\n— the state elected to proceed on the kidnapping count. The trial court imposed a prison\n\nterm on each count, ordering that the counts run consecutive for a total of 75.5 years in\n\nprison.\n\n          {¶15} Ferrell appeals, raising the following five assignments of error:\n\n          I. The jury found, against the manifest weight of the evidence, that the\n          appellant committed the acts alleged in the indictment.\n\n          II. Because there was insufficient evidence to show venue was proper, the\n          trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to dismiss counts three, four,\n          five, six, seven, and eleven as set forth in the indictment.\n\n          III. Offenses set forth in counts three, four, five, and six are allied offenses\n          of similar import and should have been merged for sentencing purposes.\n\f      IV. Appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of\n      Amendments VI and XIV, United States Constitution; and Article I, Section\n      10, Ohio Constitution.\n\n      V. The trial court erred by imposing consecutive sentences.\n\n                            Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n      {¶16} In his first assignment of error, Ferrell argues that his convictions are\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\n\n      {¶17} When an appellate court analyzes a conviction under the manifest weight\n\nstandard, it must review the entire record, weigh all of the evidence and all of the\n\nreasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in\n\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder clearly lost its way and created such a\n\nmanifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial\n\nordered. State v. Thompkins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). Under a\n\nmanifest weight standard, an appellate court sits as a “thirteenth juror” and may disagree\n\nwith the factfinder’s resolution of the conflicting testimony. Id. Although the appellate\n\ncourt may act as a thirteenth juror, it should give due deference to the findings made by\n\nthe factfinder. Id. at 388.    Only in exceptional cases, where the evidence “weighs\n\nheavily against the conviction,” should an appellate court overturn the trial court’s\n\njudgment. Id.\n\n      {¶18} Ferrell argues that the state’s entire case hinged primarily on daughter’s and\n\nR.O.’s testimony and that the lack of any physical evidence corroborating their testimony\n\nrenders the verdict against the manifest weight of the evidence.        He contends that\n\fdaughter and R.O., who are extremely close — “more like sisters” — were not credible\n\nand further implies that they conspired to fabricate the allegations against him.\n\n       {¶19} With respect to daughter’s credibility, Ferrell points to daughter’s testimony\n\nthat she accompanied him to New York to deliver the load on his semi-truck as being\n\ndirectly contradicted by other testimony that Ferrell never made a delivery to New York at\n\nthat time. He further argues that his delivery route did not allow time for him to pick up\n\ndaughter. Ferrell also contends that daughter’s credibility was also undermined by the\n\ncontradictory testimony between herself and her high school guidance counselor as the\n\nreason why she first sought out her guidance counselor. Daughter testified that she went\n\nto see her guidance counselor because of a rumor that daughter was sleeping with her\n\nbrother. Conversely, daughter’s guidance counselor testified that she had no recollection\n\nof daughter telling her that and would have remembered such an allegation.\n\n       {¶20} The weight to be given the conflicting evidence and the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses is for the trier of fact who had an opportunity to view the witnesses and observe\n\ntheir demeanor. Here, the jury was aware of these inconsistencies but obviously did not\n\nfind them to render daughter’s testimony completely unreliable. “Although we consider\n\nthe credibility of the witnesses in a manifest-weight challenge, we are mindful that the\n\ndetermination regarding witness credibility rests primarily with the trier of fact.” State v.\n\nSmith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100338, 2014-Ohio-2186, ¶ 18, citing State v. Clark, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 94406, 2010-Ohio-5600, ¶ 39.             Based on the other evidence\n\fpresented at trial, we cannot say that the jury lost its way in making such a credibility\n\ndetermination.\n\n       {¶21} For example, although daughter believed that her father’s work trip involved\n\na delivery in New York, the record reveals that he delivered a load to East York,\n\nPennsylvania at the time of the alleged offenses. Daughter acknowledged, however, that\n\nthe rest stop where the sexual offenses took place could have been in Pennsylvania.\n\nGiven daughter’s age and grade level, the jury could have reasonably found that daughter\n\nwas confused between East York, Pennsylvania, and New York at the time that she made\n\nthe trip. As for the trip actually occurring, daughter’s testimony was corroborated by her\n\nmother, who specifically testified that she remembered her daughter taking a “truck run”\n\nin August 2011 with her father before the start of school for “one-two nights.”\n\n       {¶22} Likewise, even if daughter’s stated reason at trial for seeking her guidance\n\ncounselor’s help contradicted with her guidance counselor’s recollection, that alone does\n\nnot require the jury to disregard daughter’s entire testimony, including the description of\n\nthe offenses.\n\n       {¶23} As for R.O.’s credibility, Ferrell fails to point to any inconsistencies or\n\nconflicting evidence in the record. Instead, he attacks her credibility based on her close\n\nrelationship with her cousin, the daughter.          We find this argument unpersuasive.\n\nNotably, the record contains no evidence of any motivation by the daughter or R.O.,\n\neither individually or collectively, to fabricate a story against Ferrell.\n\f       {¶24} Having considered the entire record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\n\nclearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice in finding Ferrell\n\nguilty. The first assignment of error is without merit.\n\n                                           Venue\n\n       {¶25} In his second assignment of error, Ferrell argues that the rape and gross\n\nsexual imposition counts involving his daughter, which allegedly occurred outside of\n\nOhio, should have been dismissed because the state failed to present sufficient evidence\n\nof venue.\n\n       {¶26} Ohio’s venue statute, R.C. 2901.12, provides that “the trial of a criminal\n\ncase in this state shall be held in a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, and in\n\nthe territory of which the offense or any element of the offense was committed.” R.C.\n\n2901.12(A). However, in recognizing the modern mobility of criminal offenders and the\n\ninterest of judicial economy, the statute further provides:\n\n       When an offender, as part of a course of criminal conduct, commits\n       offenses in different jurisdictions, the offender may be tried for all of those\n       offenses in any jurisdiction in which one of those offenses or any element\n       of one of those offenses occurred.\n\nR.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n     {¶27} Here, the state argued that all counts could be tried in Ohio because Ferrell\ncommitted the acts as part of a course of criminal conduct. R.C. 2901.12(H) defines,\namong others, the following as prima facie evidence of a course of criminal conduct:\n\n       (1) The offenses involved the same victim, or victims of the same type or\n       from the same group.\n\n       (2) The offenses were committed by the offender in the offender’s same\n       employment, or capacity, or relationship to another.\n\f       {¶28} Ferrell argues on appeal that he has no nexus to Cuyahoga County in Ohio\n\nto support his convictions for the offenses that allegedly occurred outside of the county.\n\nHe contends that he has overcome the state’s prima facie evidence of a course of criminal\n\nconduct by demonstrating a significant time lapse in between the offenses. He further\n\nargues that daughter had accompanied him on other truck driving trips where no\n\nwrongdoing took place, which occurred after the alleged incident in Cleveland but prior\n\nto the New York–Pennsylvania trip. According to Ferrell, these other trips constitute an\n\nintervening act that negate any claim of a course of criminal conduct.\n\n       {¶29} We find Ferrell’s arguments unpersuasive.         The counts that occurred\n\noutside of Ohio involved his daughter. He also committed the same act against his\n\ndaughter earlier in Cuyahoga County, as well as committing sexual offenses against R.O.\n\nin Cuyahoga County. Further, Ferrell facilitated the offenses against his daughter, both\n\nin Cuyahoga County and outside the county, while visiting and spending time with her.\n\nSee State v. Birt, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-02-031, 2013-Ohio-1379, ¶ 30\n\n(recognizing sufficient evidence of venue — rapes “were committed as a ‘course of\n\ncriminal conduct’ as the offenses each involved the same victim * * * and were\n\ncommitted in the same relationship, father-daughter”). Moreover, Ferrell picked his\n\ndaughter up in Cuyahoga County to take her on the road trip where the crimes were\n\ncommitted and then returned her to Cuyahoga County.             State v. Whitt, 5th Dist.\n\nCoshocton No. 10-CA-10, 2011-Ohio-3022 (venue satisfied in Coshocton County for\n\nrapes occurring in defendant’s semi-trucks out of state when evidence revealed that the\n\ftrips would originate in Coshocton County and defendant would return minor victim to\n\ndefendant’s home in Coshocton County).\n\n       {¶30} Based on this record, we find that the state presented sufficient evidence of\n\nFerrell’s nexus to Cuyahoga County to satisfy venue. The second assignment of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                      Allied Offenses\n\n       {¶31} In his third assignment of error, Ferrell argues that the trial court should\n\nhave merged the three counts of rape (Counts 3, 4, and 5) and single count of gross sexual\n\nimposition (Count 6) for the offenses that occurred the first night in his semi-truck during\n\nthe out-of-state trip. We disagree.\n\n       {¶32} When a defendant’s conduct results in the commission of two or more\n\n“allied” offenses of similar import, that conduct can be charged separately, but the\n\ndefendant can be convicted and sentenced for only one offense. R.C. 2941.25(A). In\n\ndetermining whether offenses merge, we consider the defendant’s conduct.

If we answer both\n\nquestions affirmatively, then the offenses are allied offenses of similar import and will be\n\nmerged.      Johnson at ¶ 50; see also State v.

The three separate counts of rape pertained to\n\nFerrell’s placing (1) his tongue inside daughter’s vagina, (2) his finger inside daughter’s\n\nvagina, and (3) his penis inside daughter’s vagina. The count of gross sexual imposition\n\nrelated to Ferrell’s touching daughter’s breasts. While these offenses all occurred close\n\nin time to one another, each offense involved different conduct. Accordingly, we find\n\nthat these offenses do not merge as allied offenses. See, e.g., State v. Accorinti, 12th\n\nDist. Butler Nos. CA2012-10-205 and CA2012-11-221, 2013-Ohio-4429, ¶ 16\n\n(recognizing digital penetration and vaginal intercourse “are two distinct types of sexual\n\nactivity, each constituting a separate crime”); State v.

Mahoning No. 11 MA 77, 2013-Ohio-5529 (applying Johnson and\n\nrecognizing that gross sexual imposition and rape do not merge when defendant engages\n\nin separate conduct for each offense).\n\n       {¶34} The third assignment of error is overruled.\n\f                      Ineffective Assistance of Counsel and Joinder\n\n       {¶35} In his fourth assignment of error, Ferrell argues that his trial counsel was\n\nineffective for failing to move to sever the counts involving daughter from the counts\n\ninvolving R.O. We find no merit to this argument.\n\n       {¶36} To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1)\n\ndeficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of\n\nreasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that but for\n\ncounsel’s errors, the proceeding’s result would have been different.

The law favors joining\n\fmultiple offenses in a single trial if the requisites of Crim.R. 8(A) are fulfilled. Id. If it\n\nappears, however, that the defendant would be prejudiced by the joinder, a trial court may\n\ngrant a severance under Crim.R. 14. Diar at ¶ 95.\n\n       {¶39} “A defendant is not prejudiced by joinder where the joined offenses are\n\n‘simple and direct, so that a jury is capable of segregating the proof required for each\n\noffense.’” State v.

Indeed, the decision to file a motion for separate trials or to proceed\n\nwith the joinder of the offenses may be a matter of counsel’s trial strategy. Benitez at ¶\n\n31, citing State v. Bishop, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 53278, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 246, *9\n\n(Jan. 21, 1988).\n\f         {¶41} Here, we find that it is reasonable to presume that trial counsel’s decision\n\nnot to file a motion to sever the offenses was sound trial strategy. Defense counsel could\n\nhave reasonably believed that one trial would be the best strategy to try and persuade the\n\njury to return a verdict of not guilty on all counts of the indictment at the same time.\n\nIndeed, in his closing argument, defense counsel emphasized the close relationship\n\nbetween the two cousins, implying that they fabricated their stories against Ferrell and\n\nneither one was credible.       Specifically, defense counsel emphasized that R.O. was\n\ndaughter’s best friend, asking the jury to question “why [daughter’s] best friend, her\n\nbackup, comes to her aid and said yeah, happened to me too.” Moreover, even if defense\n\ncounsel had moved for severance, the trial court would have been well within its\n\ndiscretion in maintaining the joinder. See, e.g., State v. Scott, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n91890, 2010-Ohio-3057 (no ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to\n\nmove to sever counts of sexual offenses involving a second victim; no prejudice where\n\ntrial court is well within its authority to deny such a motion).\n\n         {¶42} Having found that defense counsel’s approach constitutes reasonable trial\n\nstrategy, we find no merit to Ferrell’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.          See\n\nStrickland at 689. The fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                    Consecutive Sentences\n\n         {¶43} In his final assignment of error, Ferrell argues that the trial court failed to\n\nmake the necessary findings to support the imposition of consecutive sentences. We\n\nagree.\n\f       {¶44} Judicial fact-finding is required to overcome the statutory presumption in\n\nfavor of concurrent sentences. State v. Bonnell, Slip Opinion No. 2014-Ohio-3177, ¶ 23.\n\n Indeed, “[i]n order to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment, a trial court is required\n\nto make the findings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) at the sentencing hearing and\n\nincorporate its findings into its sentencing entry * * * .” Id. at ¶ 37.\n\n       {¶45} Specifically, “R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires the trial court to make statutory\n\nfindings prior to imposing consecutive sentences, and Crim.R. 32(A)(4) * * * directs the\n\ncourt to state those findings at the time of imposing the sentence.” Id. at ¶ 26. First, the\n\ntrial court must find that “consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from\n\nfuture crime or to punish the offender.” R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). Next, the trial court must\n\nfind that “consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the\n\noffender’s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public.” Id. Finally, the\n\ntrial court must find that at least one of the following applies: (1) the offender committed\n\none or more of the multiple offenses while awaiting trial or sentencing, while under a\n\nsanction, or while under postrelease control for a prior offense; (2) at least two of the\n\nmultiple offenses were committed as part of one or more courses of conduct, and the\n\nharm caused by two or more of the offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison\n\nterm for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct\n\nadequately reflects the seriousness of the offender’s conduct; or (3) the offender’s history\n\nof criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the\n\npublic from future crime by the offender. Id.\n\f       {¶46} Here, the trial court made the first two findings but failed to make the third\n\nfinding to support the imposition of consecutive sentences. In attempting to make the\n\nfinding, the trial judge erroneously focused on the defendant’s history of criminal conduct\n\nrelated to the underlying charges — not his criminal conduct in general. However, given\n\nthat this case involves two victims, the possibility exists for the trial court to make\n\nanother finding to support the imposition of consecutive sentences, and therefore we must\n\nremand for the trial court to consider the remaining factors of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). But\n\nthe trial court is free to impose concurrent sentences if it does not find that consecutive\n\nsentences are appropriate.\n\n       {¶47} We further note that the sentencing hearing on remand is limited to the trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the imposition of consecutive sentences.

Holdcroft,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531, 2013-Ohio-5014, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 9 (“the defendant and the\n\nstate may challenge any aspect of the sentence and sentencing hearing, and the appellate\n\ncourt is authorized to modify the sentence or remand for resentencing to fix whatever has\n\nbeen successfully challenged”).
