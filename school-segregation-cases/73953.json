The panel further held, however,\nthat the district court erred by dismissing plaintiff’s Eighth\nAmendment challenge to the debriefing process for lack of\nstanding. “Debriefing” is the process by which validated\ngang members renounce their gang membership, divulge any\ngang-related information, and earn their release back into the\nprison’s general population. The panel held that construed\nliberally, plaintiff’s complaint alleged that he would attempt\nto debrief, which he was eligible to do, but for the risk of\nretaliation. The panel held that was sufficient to establish\nstanding and reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n  *\n    This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

Killian (Certified Law Student) and Zach Tafoya\n(Certified Law Student), Pepperdine University School of\nLaw Ninth Circuit Appellate Advocacy Clinc, Malibu,\nCalifornia, argued the cause and Jeremy B. Rosen, Horvitz &\nLevy LLP, Encino, California, filed the briefs for the\nPlaintiff-Appellant.\n\nKenneth T. Roost, Deputy Attorney General, San Francisco,\nCalifornia, argued the cause and filed the brief for the\nDefendant-Appellee. With him on brief were Kamala D.\nHarris, Attorney General of California, Jonathan L. Wolff,\nSenior Assistant Attorney General, and Thomas S. Patterson,\nSupervising Deputy Attorney General, San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n\n                        OPINION\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:\n\n    We must decide whether a state court decision on a\nCalifornia prisoner’s habeas corpus petition precludes any\nclaims he might have under federal law.\n\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Ricky Gonzales has been in custody of the California\nDepartment of Corrections at Pelican Bay State Prison since\n2004, when he was found guilty of two counts of attempted\nmurder and assault with a semi-automatic firearm, and given\n\f4                    GONZALES V. CDC\n\nan enhanced sentence for discharge of the firearm and\npossession of a firearm by a gang member. In January 2007,\nGonzales was moved from the general population into\nadministrative segregation and the Institutional Gang\nInvestigators (“IGI”) began an inquiry into his possible gang\naffiliation.\n\n    In early May, IGI presented Gonzales with four pieces of\nevidence indicating his affiliation with the Northern Structure\nprison gang. First, during a search of his cell, prison staff\nfound a typed letter dated April 5, 2007, identifying other\nvalidated gang members at Pelican Bay and informing him of\ngang activity at other prisons. Two other letters, both dated\nMarch 28, 2007, also related to gang activity and were used\nto corroborate the April letter.\n\n    Second, prison staff found two pieces of artwork\ndepicting the “Huelga Bird,” a symbol associated with\nNorthern Structure. One of the pieces of artwork came from\nthe magazine Lowrider.\n\n    Third, prison staff discovered an address card containing\nthe name and contact information of Jeremy Louden, an\ninmate at Pelican Bay who had been validated as a member\nof Northern Structure. Gonzales asserts that he and Louden\nwere former cellmates and communicated “strictly for the\npurpose of assisting . . . with legal aid.” According to CDC,\nthe card not only demonstrated Gonzales’s ability to\ncommunicate with a gang member, but also could be used as\na token to enhance Gonzales’s reputation within the gang.\n\n    Fourth, a confidential memorandum from an informant\nindicated that Gonzales had “intimate knowledge” of assaults\nplanned within the prison by Northern Structure. This final\n\f                     GONZALES V. CDC                         5\n\npiece of evidence was determined not to meet departmental\nstandards because the informant had not specifically\nidentified Gonzales as a member of the gang.\n\n    Gonzales disputed each piece of evidence. IGI sent a\nvalidation package containing the evidence and Gonzales’s\nresponse to the Office of Correctional Safety, which validated\nGonzales as a member of Northern Structure. Because he had\n“proven a threat to the security of the institution by his\nassociation with a prison gang engaged in a criminal\nconspiracy against the safety of others,” Gonzales was\ntransferred to the Secured Housing Unit (“SHU”) for an\nindeterminate term.\n\n                              B\n\n    After exhausting all administrative remedies, Gonzales\nfiled a state habeas petition challenging the evidentiary basis\nfor his confinement in the SHU and seeking release from such\nconfinement. After ordering and receiving a response from\nthe state, the Superior Court denied the petition. It concluded\nthat the source documents constituted “some evidence” that\nGonzales was a gang associate, which was sufficient for due\nprocess purposes, see Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d 1080,\n1105 (9th Cir. 1986), and that the documents constituted three\nindependent sources indicative of association with a validated\ngang member or associates as required by 15 California Code\nof Regulations § 3378(c)(4). Subsequently, the California\nCourt of Appeal for the First Appellate District and the\nSupreme Court of California rejected his appeals.\n\f6                      GONZALES V. CDC\n\n                                 C\n\n    On March 29, 2010, Gonzales filed this suit under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the district court. His complaint asserted\ntwenty causes of action, which include: (1) the gang\nvalidation violated his rights to free speech and association\nunder the First Amendment; (2) the validation regulations\nwere applied in a racially discriminatory manner; (3) he was\nclassified as a gang member as retaliation for refusing to\nwaive his right to medical treatment; (4) his validation based\non documents that did not constitute “some evidence”\nviolated his due process rights; and (5) the prison’s\ndebriefing1 procedures violated the Eighth Amendment.\n\n    Before the complaint was answered, the district court\nordered Gonzales to show cause why his complaint should\nnot be dismissed as barred by claim or issue preclusion and\nto file copies of both his state habeas petition and the\nSuperior Court’s disposition. After receiving such filings, the\ndistrict court concluded that Gonzales’s § 1983 action was\nbarred by claim preclusion.2 The court also denied\nGonzales’s request, conditioned on his complaint surviving\nthe show cause order, to amend his complaint to add an\nEighth Amendment challenge to the conditions of his\nconfinement in the SHU.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n     “Debriefing” is the process by which validated gang members\nrenounce their gang membership, divulge any gang-related information,\nand earn their release back into the prison’s general population.\n  2\n    The court dismissed Gonzales’s Eighth Amendment challenge to the\ndebriefing process for lack of standing.\n\f                          GONZALES V. CDC                                  7\n\n    The court entered judgment dismissing with prejudice.\nGonzales timely appealed, arguing that the district court\nshould not have dismissed his retaliation, First Amendment,\nand Equal Protection claims as precluded, should not have\ndismissed his Eighth Amendment claim for lack of standing,\nand should not have denied his conditional motion to amend\nhis complaint.\n\n                                     II\n\n    Gonzales first contends that California habeas decisions\nshould be afforded issue-preclusive, but not claim-preclusive,\neffect on subsequent civil litigation for damages.3\n\n    The Federal Full Faith and Credit statute, 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1738, requires federal courts to “give to a state-court\njudgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that\njudgment under the law of the State in which the judgment\nwas rendered.” Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.,\n465 U.S. 75, 81 (1984). We have considered the preclusive\neffect of California habeas judgments on § 1983 litigation in\ntwo previous cases: Silverton v. Department of Treasury,\n644 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1981), and Brodheim v. Cry, 584 F.3d\n1262 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\n\n   3\n      For clarity, our Opinion refers to “claim preclusion” and “issue\npreclusion” rather than “res judicata” and “collateral estoppel.” See\nTaylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 892 & n.5 (2008). Claim preclusion\n“forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not\nrelitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.” Id. at\n892 (internal quotation marks omitted). Issue preclusion “bars successive\nlitigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a\nvalid court determination essential to the prior judgment, even if the issue\nrecurs in the context of a different claim.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\f8                    GONZALES V. CDC\n\n                              A\n\n    In Silverton, we were faced with the question whether “a\n§ 1983 claim [may] be precluded by a prior adjudication on\nthat claim in a state habeas proceeding,” and concluded that,\n“because of the nature of a state habeas proceeding, a\ndecision actually rendered should preclude an identical issue\nfrom being relitigated in a subsequent § 1983 action if the\nstate habeas court afforded a full and fair opportunity for the\nissue to be heard and determined under federal standards.”\n644 F.2d at 1346–47 (emphasis added). In other words, “if a\nstate hearing is a ‘full and fair hearing’ for federal habeas\npurposes, this is also sufficient to mandate that [issue\npreclusion] be applied.” Id. at 1347.\n\n     We did not settle in that case whether claim preclusion\nalso should apply to state habeas proceedings. We noted that\nthe Supreme Court had left open whether “claims which\ncould have been raised but were not are . . . precluded in\n§ 1983 actions,” but decided it was “not necessary for this\ncourt to meet the dangling question in this case.” Id. at 1346\n(citing Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 97 n.10 (1980)).\n\n    In Brodheim, a California prisoner appealed the district\ncourt’s judgment that his § 1983 claims were barred by the\nclaim-preclusive effect of a state habeas judgment. 584 F.3d\nat 1264. We reversed because the district court had applied\nthe federal approach to claim preclusion, rather than\nCalifornia’s approach, under which Brodheim’s claims were\nnot barred. Id. at 1268–69. Fully analyzing the district\ncourt’s dismissal based on claim preclusion, we concluded\nthat “the federal action was not barred by the state court’s\ndecision.” Id. at 1269.\n\f                      GONZALES V. CDC                          9\n\n    Nonetheless, Gonzales correctly notes that neither party\nin Brodheim raised the issue whether California habeas\ndeterminations have claim-preclusive effect at all on\nsubsequent civil litigation. Thus, Brodheim did not settle the\nquestion before us.\n\n                               B\n\n    California’s general rule is that “[a] valid final judgment\non the merits in favor of a defendant serves as a complete bar\nto further litigation on the same cause of action.” Slater v.\nBlackwood, 543 P.2d 593, 594 (Cal. 1975). “It is clearly\nestablished that a party may not split up a single cause of\naction and make it the basis of separate suits.” Wulfjen v.\nDolton, 151 P.2d 846, 848 (Cal. 1944).\n\n     To support his contention that California exempts denials\nof habeas petitions from its general rule, Gonzales relies on\none line of dicta from an intermediate appellate court: “While\na final judgment granting habeas corpus relief is res judicata,\nan order denying the writ is not.” Younan v. Caruso, 59 Cal.\nRptr. 2d 103, 108 (Ct. App. 1996) (citation omitted). But\nGonzales removes the sentence from its context: Younan\nconcerned the claim-preclusive effect of a habeas petition on\na second or successive habeas petition, not on subsequent\ncivil litigation for damages. Historically, res judicata has not,\nof its own force, barred such habeas petitions. See, e.g., In re\nPerkins, 2 Cal. 424, 430 (1852) (“[A]ny prisoner may pursue\nhis remedy of habeas corpus until he has exhausted the whole\njudicial power of the State.”).\n\n   But Younan itself notes that “successive habeas petitions\nbased on claims which could have been adjudicated in\nprevious petitions are not permitted, except in rare instances\n\f10                  GONZALES V. CDC\n\nwhere a fundamental miscarriage of justice has occurred.”\n59 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 109 (emphasis added) (citing In re Clark,\n855 P.2d 729 (Cal. 1993)). The exception Gonzales urges\ndoes not hold true even as to subsequent habeas petitions.\nAnd nothing in Younan suggests that it applies to subsequent\ncivil litigation.\n\n   California may have a particular “habeas exception” to its\ngeneral rule of claim preclusion, but it is not the exception\nGonzales urges, nor is it relevant here. In Gomez v. Superior\nCourt, the California Supreme Court noted that\n\n       the consequences of a summary denial of a\n       writ petition differ in some respects from the\n       consequences of a final judgment in a fully\n       adjudicated case. For example, the denial of\n       an application for an alternative writ or the\n       summary denial of a habeas corpus petition\n       does not establish law of the case and does not\n       have a res judicata effect in future\n       proceedings.\n\n278 P.3d 1168, 1175 n.6 (Cal. 2012) (emphasis added). By\nimplication, then, reasoned denials of California habeas\npetitions, as in this case, do have claim-preclusive effect.\n\n                             C\n\n     Gonzales offers several reasons why habeas proceedings\nshould not have claim-preclusive effect on subsequent civil\nlitigation, but those arguments are irrelevant to the issue\nbefore us, which is not whether, in a general sense, habeas\njudgments should have claim-preclusive effect on subsequent\ncivil litigation, but whether California affords claim-\n\f                        GONZALES V. CDC                              11\n\npreclusive effect to its habeas judgments. Gonzales cites\nseveral out-of-circuit precedents, but they do not concern\nCalifornia’s principles of claim preclusion.\n\n     For example, in Rhodes v. Hannigan, the Tenth Circuit\ndetermined under Kansas law that habeas judgments of\nKansas courts do not have claim-preclusive effect on\nsubsequent civil litigation. 12 F.3d 989, 991 (10th Cir. 1993).\nKansas’s doctrine of claim preclusion, however, requires\n“identity in the things” for which suit is brought. Id. Thus,\n“[s]everal Kansas courts [had] held that a suit for injunctive\nrelief involves a different cause of action than a suit for\ncompensatory damages.” Id. A habeas petition “seeks the\nremedy of immediate release or a shortened period of\nconfinement” and a § 1983 suit “requests monetary\ncompensation.” Id. Therefore, under Kansas law, a habeas\npetition and a § 1983 suit “involve different causes of action.”\nId.4\n\n    By contrast, California’s doctrine of claim preclusion\ndoes not require identity in relief sought. “Res judicata\nprecludes piecemeal litigation by splitting a single cause of\naction or relitigation of the same cause of action on a\ndifferent legal theory or for different relief.” Mycogen Corp.\nv. Monsanto Co., 51 P.3d 297, 302 (Cal. 2002) (emphasis\nadded) (holding that a judgment granting declaratory relief\nand decreeing specific performance barred, under claim\npreclusion, a subsequent suit for damages).\n\n\n  4\n    Our sister circuit also offered several “policy reasons . . . against\nprecluding a prisoner’s § 1983 claim because it was not raised in\nconjunction with an earlier petition for habeas corpus relief.” Rhodes,\n12 F.3d at 992. We consider those reasons unpersuasive here as they are\nnot grounded in California’s doctrine of claim preclusion.\n\f12                    GONZALES V. CDC\n\n    Similarly inapposite is Burgos v. Hopkins, which held\nunder New York law that New York’s habeas judgments do\nnot preclude subsequent civil litigation for damages. 14 F.3d\n787, 790–92 (2d Cir. 1994). New York does not preclude\nclaims where “the initial forum did not have the power to\naward the full measure of relief sought in the later litigation.”\nId. at 790. California, however, applies claim preclusion\neven where the plaintiff initially sued in a court of limited\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mel Rapton, Inc.,\n92 Cal. Rptr. 2d 151, 160 (Ct. App. 2000) (“A litigant cannot\navoid the impact of the rule against splitting [a] cause[] of\naction by choosing for his first foray a tribunal of limited\njurisdiction.” (internal quotation marks omitted; alterations in\noriginal)).\n\n    Our sister circuits’ cases do not suggest that California\nhas a “habeas exception” to its general rule against splitting\na cause of action. California applies claim preclusion\nregardless of whether the relief sought in each action is the\nsame, unlike Kansas, or whether the first court exercised\nlimited jurisdiction, unlike New York. Therefore, we must\naddress whether Gonzales’s complaint is claim precluded.\n\n                               III\n\n     Under California’s doctrine of claim preclusion, “all\nclaims based on the same cause of action must be decided in\na single suit; if not brought initially, they may not be raised\nat a later date.” Mycogen Corp., 51 P.3d at 302. As opposed\nto the federal “transactional” theory of claim preclusion,\n“California courts employ the ‘primary rights’ theory to\ndetermine what constitutes the same cause of action for claim\npreclusion purposes.” Brodheim, 584 F.3d at 1268.\n\f                      GONZALES V. CDC                          13\n\n    A “‘cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary right’ of\nthe plaintiff, a corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant,\nand a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of\nthat duty.” Crowley v. Katleman, 881 P.2d 1083, 1090 (Cal.\n1994). “[I]f two actions involve the same injury to the\nplaintiff and the same wrong by the defendant then the same\nprimary right is at stake even if in the second suit the plaintiff\npleads different theories of recovery, seeks different forms of\nrelief and/or adds new facts supporting recovery.” Eichman\nv. Fotomat Corp., 197 Cal. Rptr. 612, 614 (Ct. App. 1983).\n“If the same primary right is involved in two actions,\njudgment in the first bars consideration not only of all matters\nactually raised in the first suit but also all matters which could\nhave been raised.” Id. (emphasis added). “[U]nder the\nprimary rights theory, the determinative factor is the harm\nsuffered. When two actions involving the same parties seek\ncompensation for the same harm, they generally involve the\nsame primary right.” Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,\n230 P.3d 342, 348 (Cal. 2010).\n\n    The parties agree that Gonzales’s primary right was his\nprotected liberty interest in remaining free from SHU\nplacement. They also agree that the harm suffered was\nGonzales’s gang validation and indeterminate SHU detention\nbased on allegedly insufficient or unreliable evidence. Their\ndispute is in defining the primary duty that CDC allegedly\nbreached.\n\n    According to Gonzales, the primary duty of CDC was not\nto place him in the SHU without affording him established\nprocedural protections. CDC describes a duty to provide due\nprocess before deciding whether to segregate him. The state\nhabeas court understood Gonzales to be asserting a federal\ndue process claim. The more precise description of CDC’s\n\f14                   GONZALES V. CDC\n\nprimary duty, therefore, was not to deprive Gonzales of\nliberty without due process of law.\n\n                              A\n\n    Gonzales contends that his retaliation, First Amendment,\nand Equal Protection claims are not precluded, even though\nthey all challenge the same actions taken by the same\nofficials at the same time as his previously adjudicated due\nprocess claim. They arise under a distinct “primary right,” he\nasserts, because they are inherently substantive rather than\nprocedural claims.\n\n    Gonzales’s theory that procedural and substantive harms\nmust result in separate causes of action rests not on any\nCalifornia case, but on Brodheim. In that case, the prisoner’s\nstate court suit “challenged the fairness of having staff\ncomplaints against the Appeals Coordinator reviewed by the\nAppeals Coordinator. He claimed that this effectively\ndeprived him of his statutory and regulatory rights to file a\ncomplaint by denying him any meaningful review.”\nBrodheim, 584 F.3d at 1268. His federal complaint, on the\nother hand, “concerned specific acts which he claimed\nconstituted retaliation for the exercise of his constitutional\nright to file a grievance, namely, the ‘warning’ message and\nthe subsequent transfer request.” Id.\n\n    We noted that the two harms—“lack of meaningful\nreview, a procedural harm, and a retaliatory chilling of\nconstitutional substantive rights”—were “distinct.” Id. But\nour reasoning did not rely simply on a distinction between\nprocedural and substantive harms; we went on to explain how\nthe harms were distinct:\n\f                     GONZALES V. CDC                       15\n\n       They were caused at different times, by\n       different acts, and by different actors. In the\n       state action, the alleged harm was inflicted by\n       the Warden in 2003, when he allowed Cry to\n       review grievances Brodheim filed against Cry.\n       In Brodheim’s federal complaint, on the other\n       hand, the actual alleged harm was inflicted by\n       Cry himself when he placed the handwritten\n       warning on Brodheim’s interview request\n       form in 2001.\n\nId. at 1268–69.\n\n    Gonzales reads Brodheim’s distinction between\nprocedural and substantive harms out of context. Although\nsuch a distinction might be helpful in determining whether a\nplaintiff has multiple causes of action, Brodheim does not\nstand for the proposition that an allegation of a “procedural”\nharm always involves a different cause of action from an\nallegation of a “substantive” harm.\n\n    Moreover, even if Brodheim were to stand for such a\nproposition, it would not show that Gonzales has alleged\ndifferent causes of action here. The procedural harm in\nBrodheim was purely procedural. The prisoner alleged that\nthe adjudicator of his complaint was biased because the\nadjudicator was also the subject of his complaint. By\ncontrast, Gonzales’s state habeas petition did not allege a\npurely procedural harm. The state court evaluated his\nchallenge under the “some evidence” standard developed in\nMadrid v. Gomez, 889 F. Supp. 1146, 1273 (N.D. Cal. 1995).\nThat case makes clear that “some evidence,” although\nmandated by due process, has a substantive component: “In\naddition to purely procedural protections, due process also\n\f16                   GONZALES V. CDC\n\nrequires prison officials to have an evidentiary basis for their\ndecisions to confine an inmate to a security housing unit.” Id.\n(emphasis added).\n\n    When challenging the same actions by the same group of\nofficials at the same time that resulted in the same harm,\nGonzales cannot escape claim preclusion by labeling his state\nhabeas challenge “procedural” and his § 1983 challenge\n“substantive.” See Boeken, 230 P.3d at 348.\n\n                               B\n\n   Gonzales maintains that his First Amendment and Equal\nProtection claims should survive because they challenge the\nconditions of his confinement, whereas his habeas petition\nchallenged the fact of his confinement.\n\n    CDC concedes that a challenge to the conditions of\nGonzales’s confinement would present a different cause of\naction than a challenge to the fact of his confinement, but no\nsuch distinction is present here. Although Gonzales’s brief\ndescribes his First Amendment and Equal Protection claims\nas challenges to “the conditions of his current confinement,”\nin truth, his challenge is to the fact of his confinement in\nSHU. As his complaint puts it, for example: “Defendants\nhave violated my rights guaranteed by the First Amendment\nto the U.S. Constitution in that my confinement in the SHU\nis based wholly upon my legal and legitimate attempts in\njailhouse lawyering activities.”\n\n   Gonzales challenged the fact of his confinement in the\nSHU in his state habeas petition. That he seeks a different\nremedy or asserts a different legal theory in his current\n\f                      GONZALES V. CDC                           17\n\nchallenge is irrelevant under California’s claim preclusion\ndoctrine.\n\n                                IV\n\n    Gonzales’s Eighth Amendment challenge to the\ndebriefing process presents a separate cause of action, not\nprecluded by his state habeas petitions. The question is\nwhether he has standing to bring such challenge.\n\n    Standing’s three elements—injury in fact, causal\nconnection, and redressability—are well known and not at\nissue here. See, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n555, 560–61 (1992). Generally speaking, “a litigant must\nassert his or her own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest\na claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third\nparties.” Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991).\n\n    Because Gonzales had consistently denied being a gang\nmember, the district court concluded that he had “alleged no\nfacts which would suggest that [he] could debrief,” and\ntherefore lacked standing to challenge the debriefing policy.\n\n    Gonzales’s complaint, construed liberally, see, e.g.,\nWatison v. Carter, 668 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2012), does\nnot allege that it is impossible for him to debrief, but that it is\nimpossible for him to debrief successfully. As an adjudicated\ngang member, he is eligible to debrief, regardless of whether\nhe is, in fact, a member of Northern Structure. Of course, if\nhis allegations are true, he will not be able to convince prison\nofficials that he has renounced his non-existent gang\nmembership, a requirement to debrief successfully. But the\nrisk of retaliation from other gang members—as alleged in\n\f18                     GONZALES V. CDC\n\nhis complaint—inheres in becoming an “informant,”\nregardless of whether his information is accurate.\n\n    Construed liberally, Gonzales’s complaint alleges that he\nwould attempt to debrief, which he is eligible to do, but for\nthe risk of retaliation. That is sufficient to establish standing.\n\n                                 V\n\n    Gonzales’s motion to amend his complaint was\nconditioned on his original complaint surviving the district\ncourt’s order to show cause why it should not be dismissed.\nAs that condition precedent was not met, the district court\ndenied the motion. But we have determined that the court\nerroneously dismissed one count of Gonzales’s complaint.\nTherefore, we reverse the court’s denial and remand for\nreconsideration.\n\n                                 VI\n\n    The district court properly concluded that the claim-\npreclusive effect of California’s denial of his habeas petition\nbars nineteen of Gonzales’s twenty counts. The court erred,\nhowever, by dismissing Gonzales’s Eighth Amendment\nchallenge to the debriefing process for lack of standing. As\nthe condition precedent to Gonzales’s motion to amend is\nnow met, we must reverse the court’s denial of that motion\nand remand for reconsideration.5\n\n  AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and\nREMANDED. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n 5\n   Gonzales’s motion to certify, filed October 22, 2013, is DENIED as\nmoot.\n\f",

With him on brief were Kamala D.\nHarris, Attorney General of California, Jonathan L. Wolff,\nSenior Assistant Attorney General, and Thomas S. Patterson,\nSupervising Deputy Attorney General, San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n\n                        OPINION\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:\n\n    We must decide whether a state court decision on a\nCalifornia prisoner’s habeas corpus petition precludes any\nclaims he might have under federal law.\n\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Ricky Gonzales has been in custody of the California\nDepartment of Corrections at Pelican Bay State Prison since\n2004, when he was found guilty of two counts of attempted\nmurder and assault with a semi-automatic firearm, and given\n\f4                    GONZALES V. CDC\n\nan enhanced sentence for discharge of the firearm and\npossession of a firearm by a gang member. In January 2007,\nGonzales was moved from the general population into\nadministrative segregation and the Institutional Gang\nInvestigators (“IGI”) began an inquiry into his possible gang\naffiliation.\n\n    In early May, IGI presented Gonzales with four pieces of\nevidence indicating his affiliation with the Northern Structure\nprison gang. First, during a search of his cell, prison staff\nfound a typed letter dated April 5, 2007, identifying other\nvalidated gang members at Pelican Bay and informing him of\ngang activity at other prisons. Two other letters, both dated\nMarch 28, 2007, also related to gang activity and were used\nto corroborate the April letter.\n\n    Second, prison staff found two pieces of artwork\ndepicting the “Huelga Bird,” a symbol associated with\nNorthern Structure. One of the pieces of artwork came from\nthe magazine Lowrider.\n\n    Third, prison staff discovered an address card containing\nthe name and contact information of Jeremy Louden, an\ninmate at Pelican Bay who had been validated as a member\nof Northern Structure. Gonzales asserts that he and Louden\nwere former cellmates and communicated “strictly for the\npurpose of assisting . . . with legal aid.” According to CDC,\nthe card not only demonstrated Gonzales’s ability to\ncommunicate with a gang member, but also could be used as\na token to enhance Gonzales’s reputation within the gang.\n\n    Fourth, a confidential memorandum from an informant\nindicated that Gonzales had “intimate knowledge” of assaults\nplanned within the prison by Northern Structure. This final\n\f                     GONZALES V. CDC                         5\n\npiece of evidence was determined not to meet departmental\nstandards because the informant had not specifically\nidentified Gonzales as a member of the gang.\n\n    Gonzales disputed each piece of evidence. IGI sent a\nvalidation package containing the evidence and Gonzales’s\nresponse to the Office of Correctional Safety, which validated\nGonzales as a member of Northern Structure. Because he had\n“proven a threat to the security of the institution by his\nassociation with a prison gang engaged in a criminal\nconspiracy against the safety of others,” Gonzales was\ntransferred to the Secured Housing Unit (“SHU”) for an\nindeterminate term.\n\n                              B\n\n    After exhausting all administrative remedies, Gonzales\nfiled a state habeas petition challenging the evidentiary basis\nfor his confinement in the SHU and seeking release from such\nconfinement. After ordering and receiving a response from\nthe state, the Superior Court denied the petition. It concluded\nthat the source documents constituted “some evidence” that\nGonzales was a gang associate, which was sufficient for due\nprocess purposes, see Toussaint v. McCarthy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476738\"><a href=\"/opinion/476738/joseph-toussaint-plaintiffsappelleescross-appellants-v-daniel-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1080</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1105 (9th Cir. 1986), and that the documents constituted three\nindependent sources indicative of association with a validated\ngang member or associates as required by 15 California Code\nof Regulations § 3378(c)(4). Subsequently, the California\nCourt of Appeal for the First Appellate District and the\nSupreme Court of California rejected his appeals.\n\f6                      GONZALES V. CDC\n\n                                 C\n\n    On March 29, 2010, Gonzales filed this suit under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the district court. His complaint asserted\ntwenty causes of action, which include: (1) the gang\nvalidation violated his rights to free speech and association\nunder the First Amendment; (2) the validation regulations\nwere applied in a racially discriminatory manner; (3) he was\nclassified as a gang member as retaliation for refusing to\nwaive his right to medical treatment; (4) his validation based\non documents that did not constitute “some evidence”\nviolated his due process rights; and (5) the prison’s\ndebriefing1 procedures violated the Eighth Amendment.\n\n    Before the complaint was answered, the district court\nordered Gonzales to show cause why his complaint should\nnot be dismissed as barred by claim or issue preclusion and\nto file copies of both his state habeas petition and the\nSuperior Court’s disposition. After receiving such filings, the\ndistrict court concluded that Gonzales’s § 1983 action was\nbarred by claim preclusion.2 The court also denied\nGonzales’s request, conditioned on his complaint surviving\nthe show cause order, to amend his complaint to add an\nEighth Amendment challenge to the conditions of his\nconfinement in the SHU.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n     “Debriefing” is the process by which validated gang members\nrenounce their gang membership, divulge any gang-related information,\nand earn their release back into the prison’s general population.\n  2\n    The court dismissed Gonzales’s Eighth Amendment challenge to the\ndebriefing process for lack of standing.\n\f                          GONZALES V. CDC                                  7\n\n    The court entered judgment dismissing with prejudice.\nGonzales timely appealed, arguing that the district court\nshould not have dismissed his retaliation, First Amendment,\nand Equal Protection claims as precluded, should not have\ndismissed his Eighth Amendment claim for lack of standing,\nand should not have denied his conditional motion to amend\nhis complaint.\n\n                                     II\n\n    Gonzales first contends that California habeas decisions\nshould be afforded issue-preclusive, but not claim-preclusive,\neffect on subsequent civil litigation for damages.3\n\n    The Federal Full Faith and Credit statute, 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1738, requires federal courts to “give to a state-court\njudgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that\njudgment under the law of the State in which the judgment\nwas rendered.” Migra v.

Sturgell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145793\"><a href=\"/opinion/145793/taylor-v-sturgell/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 892 & n.5 (2008). Claim preclusion\n“forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not\nrelitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.” Id. at\n892 (internal quotation marks omitted). Issue preclusion “bars successive\nlitigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a\nvalid court determination essential to the prior judgment, even if the issue\nrecurs in the context of a different claim.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\f8                    GONZALES V. CDC\n\n                              A\n\n    In Silverton, we were faced with the question whether “a\n§ 1983 claim [may] be precluded by a prior adjudication on\nthat claim in a state habeas proceeding,” and concluded that,\n“because of the nature of a state habeas proceeding, a\ndecision actually rendered should preclude an identical issue\nfrom being relitigated in a subsequent § 1983 action if the\nstate habeas court afforded a full and fair opportunity for the\nissue to be heard and determined under federal standards.”\n644 F.2d at 1346–47 (emphasis added). In other words, “if a\nstate hearing is a ‘full and fair hearing’ for federal habeas\npurposes, this is also sufficient to mandate that [issue\npreclusion] be applied.” Id. at 1347.\n\n     We did not settle in that case whether claim preclusion\nalso should apply to state habeas proceedings. We noted that\nthe Supreme Court had left open whether “claims which\ncould have been raised but were not are . . . precluded in\n§ 1983 actions,” but decided it was “not necessary for this\ncourt to meet the dangling question in this case.” Id. at 1346\n(citing Allen v.

We reversed because the district court had applied\nthe federal approach to claim preclusion, rather than\nCalifornia’s approach, under which Brodheim’s claims were\nnot barred. Id. at 1268–69. Fully analyzing the district\ncourt’s dismissal based on claim preclusion, we concluded\nthat “the federal action was not barred by the state court’s\ndecision.” Id. at 1269.\n\f                      GONZALES V. CDC                          9\n\n    Nonetheless, Gonzales correctly notes that neither party\nin Brodheim raised the issue whether California habeas\ndeterminations have claim-preclusive effect at all on\nsubsequent civil litigation. Thus, Brodheim did not settle the\nquestion before us.\n\n                               B\n\n    California’s general rule is that “[a] valid final judgment\non the merits in favor of a defendant serves as a complete bar\nto further litigation on the same cause of action.” Slater v.\nBlackwood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1204002\"><a href=\"/opinion/1204002/slater-v-blackwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594 (Cal. 1975). “It is clearly\nestablished that a party may not split up a single cause of\naction and make it the basis of separate suits.” Wulfjen v.\nDolton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 848 (Cal. 1944).\n\n     To support his contention that California exempts denials\nof habeas petitions from its general rule, Gonzales relies on\none line of dicta from an intermediate appellate court: “While\na final judgment granting habeas corpus relief is res judicata,\nan order denying the writ is not.” Younan v. Caruso, 59 Cal.\nRptr. 2d 103, 108 (Ct. App. 1996) (citation omitted). But\nGonzales removes the sentence from its context: Younan\nconcerned the claim-preclusive effect of a habeas petition on\na second or successive habeas petition, not on subsequent\ncivil litigation for damages. Historically, res judicata has not,\nof its own force, barred such habeas petitions. See, e.g., In re\nPerkins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430 (1852) (“[A]ny prisoner may pursue\nhis remedy of habeas corpus until he has exhausted the whole\njudicial power of the State.”).\n\n   But Younan itself notes that “successive habeas petitions\nbased on claims which could have been adjudicated in\nprevious petitions are not permitted, except in rare instances\n\f10                  GONZALES V. CDC\n\nwhere a fundamental miscarriage of justice has occurred.”\n59 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 109 (emphasis added) (citing In re Clark,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1113311\"><a href=\"/opinion/1113311/in-re-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 1993)). The exception Gonzales urges\ndoes not hold true even as to subsequent habeas petitions.\nAnd nothing in Younan suggests that it applies to subsequent\ncivil litigation.\n\n   California may have a particular “habeas exception” to its\ngeneral rule of claim preclusion, but it is not the exception\nGonzales urges, nor is it relevant here. In Gomez v. Superior\nCourt, the California Supreme Court noted that\n\n       the consequences of a summary denial of a\n       writ petition differ in some respects from the\n       consequences of a final judgment in a fully\n       adjudicated case. For example, the denial of\n       an application for an alternative writ or the\n       summary denial of a habeas corpus petition\n       does not establish law of the case and does not\n       have a res judicata effect in future\n       proceedings.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1175 n.6 (Cal. 2012) (emphasis added). By\nimplication, then, reasoned denials of California habeas\npetitions, as in this case, do have claim-preclusive effect.\n\n                             C\n\n     Gonzales offers several reasons why habeas proceedings\nshould not have claim-preclusive effect on subsequent civil\nlitigation, but those arguments are irrelevant to the issue\nbefore us, which is not whether, in a general sense, habeas\njudgments should have claim-preclusive effect on subsequent\ncivil litigation, but whether California affords claim-\n\f                        GONZALES V.

Gonzales cites\nseveral out-of-circuit precedents, but they do not concern\nCalifornia’s principles of claim preclusion.\n\n     For example, in Rhodes v. Hannigan, the Tenth Circuit\ndetermined under Kansas law that habeas judgments of\nKansas courts do not have claim-preclusive effect on\nsubsequent civil litigation. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659408\"><a href=\"/opinion/659408/ronald-lee-rhodes-v-robert-d-hannigan-gb-whittington/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (10th Cir. 1993).\nKansas’s doctrine of claim preclusion, however, requires\n“identity in the things” for which suit is brought. Id. Thus,\n“[s]everal Kansas courts [had] held that a suit for injunctive\nrelief involves a different cause of action than a suit for\ncompensatory damages.” Id. A habeas petition “seeks the\nremedy of immediate release or a shortened period of\nconfinement” and a § 1983 suit “requests monetary\ncompensation.” Id. Therefore, under Kansas law, a habeas\npetition and a § 1983 suit “involve different causes of action.”\nId.4\n\n    By contrast, California’s doctrine of claim preclusion\ndoes not require identity in relief sought. “Res judicata\nprecludes piecemeal litigation by splitting a single cause of\naction or relitigation of the same cause of action on a\ndifferent legal theory or for different relief.” Mycogen Corp.\nv.

We consider those reasons unpersuasive here as they are\nnot grounded in California’s doctrine of claim preclusion.\n\f12                    GONZALES V. CDC\n\n    Similarly inapposite is Burgos v. Hopkins, which held\nunder New York law that New York’s habeas judgments do\nnot preclude subsequent civil litigation for damages. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661462\"><a href=\"/opinion/661462/ricardo-burgos-v-marian-hopkins-warden-daniel-meehan-deputy-warden-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 790–92 (2d Cir. 1994). New York does not preclude\nclaims where “the initial forum did not have the power to\naward the full measure of relief sought in the later litigation.”\nId. at 790. California, however, applies claim preclusion\neven where the plaintiff initially sued in a court of limited\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mel Rapton, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2287432\"><a href=\"/opinion/2287432/allstate-ins-co-v-mel-rapton-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 2000) (“A litigant cannot\navoid the impact of the rule against splitting [a] cause[] of\naction by choosing for his first foray a tribunal of limited\njurisdiction.” (internal quotation marks omitted; alterations in\noriginal)).\n\n    Our sister circuits’ cases do not suggest that California\nhas a “habeas exception” to its general rule against splitting\na cause of action. California applies claim preclusion\nregardless of whether the relief sought in each action is the\nsame, unlike Kansas, or whether the first court exercised\nlimited jurisdiction, unlike New York. Therefore, we must\naddress whether Gonzales’s complaint is claim precluded.\n\n                               III\n\n     Under California’s doctrine of claim preclusion, “all\nclaims based on the same cause of action must be decided in\na single suit; if not brought initially, they may not be raised\nat a later date.” Mycogen Corp., 51 P.3d at 302. As opposed\nto the federal “transactional” theory of claim preclusion,\n“California courts employ the ‘primary rights’ theory to\ndetermine what constitutes the same cause of action for claim\npreclusion purposes.” Brodheim, 584 F.3d at 1268.\n\f                      GONZALES V. CDC                          13\n\n    A “‘cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary right’ of\nthe plaintiff, a corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant,\nand a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of\nthat duty.” Crowley v. Katleman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451389\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451389/crowley-v-katleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1090 (Cal.\n1994). “[I]f two actions involve the same injury to the\nplaintiff and the same wrong by the defendant then the same\nprimary right is at stake even if in the second suit the plaintiff\npleads different theories of recovery, seeks different forms of\nrelief and/or adds new facts supporting recovery.” Eichman\nv. Fotomat Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106297\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106297/eichman-v-fotomat-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 1983).\n“If the same primary right is involved in two actions,\njudgment in the first bars consideration not only of all matters\nactually raised in the first suit but also all matters which could\nhave been raised.” Id. (emphasis added). “[U]nder the\nprimary rights theory, the determinative factor is the harm\nsuffered. When two actions involving the same parties seek\ncompensation for the same harm, they generally involve the\nsame primary right.” Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2626174\"><a href=\"/opinion/2626174/boeken-v-philip-morris-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 348 (Cal. 2010).\n\n    The parties agree that Gonzales’s primary right was his\nprotected liberty interest in remaining free from SHU\nplacement. They also agree that the harm suffered was\nGonzales’s gang validation and indeterminate SHU detention\nbased on allegedly insufficient or unreliable evidence. Their\ndispute is in defining the primary duty that CDC allegedly\nbreached.\n\n    According to Gonzales, the primary duty of CDC was not\nto place him in the SHU without affording him established\nprocedural protections. CDC describes a duty to provide due\nprocess before deciding whether to segregate him. The state\nhabeas court understood Gonzales to be asserting a federal\ndue process claim. The more precise description of CDC’s\n\f14                   GONZALES V. CDC\n\nprimary duty, therefore, was not to deprive Gonzales of\nliberty without due process of law.\n\n                              A\n\n    Gonzales contends that his retaliation, First Amendment,\nand Equal Protection claims are not precluded, even though\nthey all challenge the same actions taken by the same\nofficials at the same time as his previously adjudicated due\nprocess claim. They arise under a distinct “primary right,” he\nasserts, because they are inherently substantive rather than\nprocedural claims.\n\n    Gonzales’s theory that procedural and substantive harms\nmust result in separate causes of action rests not on any\nCalifornia case, but on Brodheim. In that case, the prisoner’s\nstate court suit “challenged the fairness of having staff\ncomplaints against the Appeals Coordinator reviewed by the\nAppeals Coordinator. He claimed that this effectively\ndeprived him of his statutory and regulatory rights to file a\ncomplaint by denying him any meaningful review.”\nBrodheim, 584 F.3d at 1268. His federal complaint, on the\nother hand, “concerned specific acts which he claimed\nconstituted retaliation for the exercise of his constitutional\nright to file a grievance, namely, the ‘warning’ message and\nthe subsequent transfer request.” Id.\n\n    We noted that the two harms—“lack of meaningful\nreview, a procedural harm, and a retaliatory chilling of\nconstitutional substantive rights”—were “distinct.” Id. But\nour reasoning did not rely simply on a distinction between\nprocedural and substantive harms; we went on to explain how\nthe harms were distinct:\n\f                     GONZALES V. CDC                       15\n\n       They were caused at different times, by\n       different acts, and by different actors. In the\n       state action, the alleged harm was inflicted by\n       the Warden in 2003, when he allowed Cry to\n       review grievances Brodheim filed against Cry.\n       In Brodheim’s federal complaint, on the other\n       hand, the actual alleged harm was inflicted by\n       Cry himself when he placed the handwritten\n       warning on Brodheim’s interview request\n       form in 2001.\n\nId. at 1268–69.\n\n    Gonzales reads Brodheim’s distinction between\nprocedural and substantive harms out of context. Although\nsuch a distinction might be helpful in determining whether a\nplaintiff has multiple causes of action, Brodheim does not\nstand for the proposition that an allegation of a “procedural”\nharm always involves a different cause of action from an\nallegation of a “substantive” harm.\n\n    Moreover, even if Brodheim were to stand for such a\nproposition, it would not show that Gonzales has alleged\ndifferent causes of action here. The procedural harm in\nBrodheim was purely procedural. The prisoner alleged that\nthe adjudicator of his complaint was biased because the\nadjudicator was also the subject of his complaint. By\ncontrast, Gonzales’s state habeas petition did not allege a\npurely procedural harm. The state court evaluated his\nchallenge under the “some evidence” standard developed in\nMadrid v. Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1904317\"><a href=\"/opinion/1904317/madrid-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1273 (N.D. Cal. 1995).\nThat case makes clear that “some evidence,” although\nmandated by due process, has a substantive component: “In\naddition to purely procedural protections, due process also\n\f16                   GONZALES V. CDC\n\nrequires prison officials to have an evidentiary basis for their\ndecisions to confine an inmate to a security housing unit.” Id.\n(emphasis added).\n\n    When challenging the same actions by the same group of\nofficials at the same time that resulted in the same harm,\nGonzales cannot escape claim preclusion by labeling his state\nhabeas challenge “procedural” and his § 1983 challenge\n“substantive.” See Boeken, 230 P.3d at 348.\n\n                               B\n\n   Gonzales maintains that his First Amendment and Equal\nProtection claims should survive because they challenge the\nconditions of his confinement, whereas his habeas petition\nchallenged the fact of his confinement.\n\n    CDC concedes that a challenge to the conditions of\nGonzales’s confinement would present a different cause of\naction than a challenge to the fact of his confinement, but no\nsuch distinction is present here. Although Gonzales’s brief\ndescribes his First Amendment and Equal Protection claims\nas challenges to “the conditions of his current confinement,”\nin truth, his challenge is to the fact of his confinement in\nSHU. As his complaint puts it, for example: “Defendants\nhave violated my rights guaranteed by the First Amendment\nto the U.S. Constitution in that my confinement in the SHU\nis based wholly upon my legal and legitimate attempts in\njailhouse lawyering activities.”\n\n   Gonzales challenged the fact of his confinement in the\nSHU in his state habeas petition. That he seeks a different\nremedy or asserts a different legal theory in his current\n\f                      GONZALES V. CDC                           17\n\nchallenge is irrelevant under California’s claim preclusion\ndoctrine.\n\n                                IV\n\n    Gonzales’s Eighth Amendment challenge to the\ndebriefing process presents a separate cause of action, not\nprecluded by his state habeas petitions. The question is\nwhether he has standing to bring such challenge.\n\n    Standing’s three elements—injury in fact, causal\nconnection, and redressability—are well known and not at\nissue here. See, e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560–61 (1992). Generally speaking, “a litigant must\nassert his or her own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest\na claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third\nparties.” Powers v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112570\"><a href=\"/opinion/112570/powers-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410 (1991).\n\n    Because Gonzales had consistently denied being a gang\nmember, the district court concluded that he had “alleged no\nfacts which would suggest that [he] could debrief,” and\ntherefore lacked standing to challenge the debriefing policy.\n\n    Gonzales’s complaint, construed liberally, see, e.g.,\nWatison v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1112 (9th Cir. 2012), does\nnot allege that it is impossible for him to debrief, but that it is\nimpossible for him to debrief successfully. As an adjudicated\ngang member, he is eligible to debrief, regardless of whether\nhe is, in fact, a member of Northern Structure. Of course, if\nhis allegations are true, he will not be able to convince prison\nofficials that he has renounced his non-existent gang\nmembership, a requirement to debrief successfully. But the\nrisk of retaliation from other gang members—as alleged in\n\f18                     GONZALES V. CDC\n\nhis complaint—inheres in becoming an “informant,”\nregardless of whether his information is accurate.\n\n    Construed liberally, Gonzales’s complaint alleges that he\nwould attempt to debrief, which he is eligible to do, but for\nthe risk of retaliation. That is sufficient to establish standing.\n\n                                 V\n\n    Gonzales’s motion to amend his complaint was\nconditioned on his original complaint surviving the district\ncourt’s order to show cause why it should not be dismissed.\nAs that condition precedent was not met, the district court\ndenied the motion. But we have determined that the court\nerroneously dismissed one count of Gonzales’s complaint.\nTherefore, we reverse the court’s denial and remand for\nreconsideration.\n\n                                 VI\n\n    The district court properly concluded that the claim-\npreclusive effect of California’s denial of his habeas petition\nbars nineteen of Gonzales’s twenty counts. The court erred,\nhowever, by dismissing Gonzales’s Eighth Amendment\nchallenge to the debriefing process for lack of standing. As\nthe condition precedent to Gonzales’s motion to amend is\nnow met, we must reverse the court’s denial of that motion\nand remand for reconsideration.5\n\n  AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and\nREMANDED. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n 5\n   Gonzales’s motion to certify, filed October 22, 2013, is DENIED as\nmoot.\n\f</pre>",
