(“KIPP”), challenges the\n\ntrial court’s order denying its plea to the jurisdiction 2 on the claims brought against\n\n\n\n1\n      See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(8) (Vernon Supp. 2013)\n      (permitting governmental unit to appeal order denying plea to jurisdiction).\n\fit by appellee, Kimberly Whitehead, for employment discrimination based on her\n\nsex and race. 3 In five issues, KIPP contends that the trial court erred in denying its\n\nplea. 4\n\n          We affirm.\n\n                                          Background\n\n          In her original petition, Whitehead, who is Caucasian, alleges that KIPP, an\n\nopen-enrollment charter school,5 employed her as an “Administrative Learning\n\nSpecialist” from April 2009 to February 17, 2011, when it terminated her\n\nemployment.         Later, KIPP designated her as a “Facilitated Support Service\n\nemployee,” assisting teachers with failing students.\n\n          In summer 2010, KIPP hired Daphane Carter, who is African-American, as\n\nthe new “School Leader,” or principal.                In August 2010, Whitehead, while\n\npregnant, suffered a serious illness requiring her hospitalization and absence from\n\n\n2\n          Although KIPP challenged the trial court’s jurisdiction in both its summary-\n          judgment motions and its plea to the jurisdiction, we review KIPP’s challenge as\n          one to the trial court’s denial of its plea to the jurisdiction. See id.; Tex. Dep’t of\n          Criminal Justice v. Simons, 140 S.W.3d 338, 349 (Tex. 2004).\n3\n          See TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. §§ 21.002–.556 (Vernon 2006 & Supp. 2013).\n4\n          Whitehead acknowledges in her brief to this Court that she has abandoned her\n          retaliation claim. Thus, we need not address KIPP’s first issue, in which it argues\n          that Whitehead has abandoned the claim. Cf. MacFarlane v. Burke, No. 01-10-\n          00409-CV, 2011 WL 2503937, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] June 23,\n          2011, no pet.) (mem. op.) (reciting elements of judicial admission).\n5\n          See TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 12.105 (Vernon 2012) (“An open-enrollment\n          charter school is part of the public school system of this state.”).\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fwork under the Family Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”). 6 Carter in turn assigned\n\nWhitehead’s duties to Andrea Dozier, who is also African-American, while\n\nWhitehead was out on FMLA leave.\n\n      Whitehead further alleges that when she returned to work from her FMLA\n\nleave on October 5, 2010, she “was assigned job duties that were different from the\n\njob duties she discharged prior to her . . . medical leave.” When she asked for her\n\njob duties to be reassigned to her, she “was told that would not happen because\n\n[she] was about to go on maternity leave,” but she “was assured that upon\n\nreturning from pregnancy leave, her old job duties would be given back to her.”\n\n      On November 2, 2010, Whitehead went on maternity leave, and she\n\ndelivered her baby the following day. When she returned to work on December 3,\n\n2010, she “asked for her old job back,” but was told “that would happen after\n\nChristmas.” When Whitehead met with Carter about her job on January 11, 2011,\n\nCarter then told her, “You don’t fit i[n]. You just had a baby. You’re just an\n\noverpaid teacher. I can’t afford your salary. I gave your job away. You cannot do\n\nthis job having children. Things have changed around here. If you don’t like it,\n\nyou need to apply at Nordstrom.”\n\n      Subsequently, after Whitehead refused to resign, “Carter became very\n\nhostile toward” her, and on February 9, 2011, during a job-performance evaluation,\n\n6\n      See 29 U.S.C. §§ 2612(a)(1), 2614(a)(1) (2012).\n\n\n                                          3\n\fCarter told her that she “was not doing her job.”         Immediately afterward,\n\nWhitehead filed a complaint with Chuck Fimble, KIPP’s Human Resources\n\nDirector, asserting “FMLA discrimination, a hostile work environment, and race\n\ndiscrimination.” On February 17, 2011, Carter called Whitehead into a meeting\n\nwith Fimble, and she handed Whitehead a letter terminating her employment.\n\n       Whitehead then filed a discrimination charge against KIPP with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and the Texas Commission on\n\nHuman Rights (“TCHR”), alleging retaliation and discrimination based on race and\n\nsex.\n\n       Whitehead filed the instant suit after the TCHR issued her a “right-to-sue”\n\nletter. KIPP answered and then filed a matter-of-law and no-evidence summary-\n\njudgment motion and a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting sovereign immunity. In\n\nits plea, KIPP argued that the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nand should dismiss the suit because Whitehead “cannot prove essential elements of\n\nher claims.” KIPP asserted that Whitehead lacked standing to assert a pregnancy-\n\ndiscrimination claim as she was not a member of a protected class, did not suffer\n\nan adverse employment action in connection with her race, cannot establish a\n\ncausal connection between her human-resources complaint and the termination of\n\nemployment, cannot demonstrate that KIPP’s stated rationale for terminating her\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\femployment was based on a pretext, and lacked evidence to support the essential\n\nelements of her claims.\n\n      Whitehead responded, arguing that the trial court had subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over her claims because her pleaded allegations establish “a prima\n\nfacie case of pregnancy and race discrimination.” The trial court denied KIPP’s\n\nplea to the jurisdiction and summary-judgment motions.\n\n                               Standard of Review\n\n      We review de novo a trial court’s ruling on a jurisdictional plea. City of\n\nHous. v. Vallejo, 371 S.W.3d 499, 501 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet.\n\ndenied). A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea that seeks dismissal of a case\n\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Harris Cnty. v. Sykes, 136 S.W.3d 635, 638\n\n(Tex. 2004).    A plaintiff has the burden to allege facts that affirmatively\n\ndemonstrate that the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction. Tex. Ass’n of Bus.\n\nv. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993).            A plea to the\n\njurisdiction can be utilized to challenge whether the plaintiff has met her burden of\n\nalleging jurisdictional facts, but it can also raise a challenge to the existence of\n\njurisdictional facts. See Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\n217, 226–27 (Tex. 2004). When reviewing a trial court’s ruling on a jurisdictional\n\nplea, we construe the pleadings liberally in favor of the pleader, accept all factual\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fallegations as true, and look to the pleader’s intent. Heckman v. Williamson Cnty.,\n\n369 S.W.3d 137, 150 (Tex. 2012).\n\n      A trial court’s review of a plea challenging the existence of jurisdictional\n\nfacts mirrors that of a matter-of-law summary-judgment motion. Mission Consol.\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d 629, 635 (Tex. 2012); Miranda, 133\n\nS.W.3d at 228; see also TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). Thus, the court can consider\n\nevidence as necessary to resolve any dispute over the jurisdictional facts, even if\n\nthe evidence “implicates both the subject matter jurisdiction of the court and the\n\nmerits of the case.” Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. The defendant is required to\n\nmeet the summary-judgment standard of proof on its assertion that the trial court\n\nlacks jurisdiction; once the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff is then required\n\nto show that there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional issue. Id.\n\nat 228. If the evidence creates a fact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court\n\nmust deny the plea to the jurisdiction and leave its resolution to the fact finder. Id.\n\nat 227–28. On the other hand, if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact\n\nquestion on the jurisdictional issue, the trial court rules on the plea to the\n\njurisdiction as a matter of law. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 635.\n\n                             Governmental Immunity\n\n      Under the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity, the state cannot be\n\nsued without its consent. City of Hous. v. Williams, 353 S.W.3d 128, 134 (Tex.\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f2011). Governmental immunity operates like sovereign immunity to afford similar\n\nprotection to subdivisions of the state, including counties, cities, and school\n\ndistricts. Sykes, 136 S.W.3d at 638. Like sovereign immunity, “governmental\n\nimmunity has two components: immunity from liability, which bars enforcement\n\nof a judgment against a governmental entity, and immunity from suit, which bars\n\nsuit against the entity altogether.” Tooke v. City of Mexia, 197 S.W.3d 325, 332\n\n(Tex. 2006). Governmental immunity from suit deprives a trial court of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction and is properly asserted in a plea to the jurisdiction.     See\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 225–26. As an open-enrollment charter school, KIPP\n\nenjoys governmental immunity from suit. LTTS Charter Sch., Inc. v. Palasota,\n\n362 S.W.3d 202, 208 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.).\n\n       The Texas Legislature has provided a limited waiver of sovereign and\n\ngovernmental immunity for employment discrimination and retaliation claims\n\nfalling within Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. See TEX. LAB. CODE ANN.\n\n§§ 21.051(1), 21.055 (Vernon 2006) (prohibiting unlawful employment practices\n\nby “employer”); see also id. § 21.002(8)(D) (Vernon Supp. 2013) (defining\n\n“employer” to include “a county, municipality, state agency, or state\n\ninstrumentality”). To establish waiver, a plaintiff must plead the elements of her\n\nstatutory cause of action, i.e., the basic facts that make up a prima facie case, so\n\nthat a court can determine whether she has sufficiently alleged a violation under\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fChapter 21; she will only be required to submit evidence if the defendant presents\n\nevidence negating one of those basic facts. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637.\n\n      Although the Texas Legislature has waived immunity for suits brought\n\nagainst school districts under Chapter 21, immunity is waived only for those suits\n\nin which “the plaintiff actually alleges a violation” of Chapter 21 “by pleading\n\nfacts that state a claim thereunder.” Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 636. In other words, a\n\nplaintiff must actually allege a violation of Chapter 21 in order for there to be a\n\nwaiver from suit. Id. at 636–37. Failure by a plaintiff to allege a Chapter 21\n\nviolation means the court has no jurisdiction and the claim should be dismissed.\n\nId. at 637. This standard does not require the plaintiff to marshal evidence and\n\nprove her claim. Id. Again, the plaintiff is required to submit evidence only if the\n\ndefendant presents evidence negating one of those basic facts. Id.\n\n                          Employment Discrimination\n\n      In its second and third issues, KIPP argues that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying its plea to the jurisdiction on Whitehead’s claim against it for\n\ndiscrimination based on sex because (1) she was not “a member of a protected\n\nclass based on pregnancy when she was not pregnant at the time” it terminated her\n\nemployment and (2) “neither she nor her replacements were pregnant.” In its\n\nfourth issue, KIPP argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea on\n\nWhitehead’s claim against it for discrimination based on race because she cannot\n\n\n                                         8\n\festablish she was “replaced by an African-American employee.” In its fifth issue,\n\nKIPP argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea on Whitehead’s claims\n\nagainst it for discrimination based on both sex and race because she did not\n\nestablish that its “legitimate, nondiscriminatory . . . reasons for terminating her\n\nemployment were pretextual.”\n\n      Whitehead brings her claims against KIPP for employment discrimination,\n\nbased on sex and race, under Chapter 21. See TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. §§ 21.001–\n\n.556 (Vernon 2006 & Supp. 2013).             Chapter 21 “is a comprehensive fair\n\nemployment practices act and remedial scheme, modeled after Title VII of the\n\nfederal Civil Rights Act of 1964,” which “provides the framework for employment\n\ndiscrimination claims in Texas.” Prairie View A & M Univ. v. Chatha, 381\n\nS.W.3d 500, 502–03 (Tex. 2012). Chapter 21 was “‘enacted to address the specific\n\nevil of discrimination and retaliation in the workplace,’ as well as to coordinate\n\nand conform with federal anti-discrimination and retaliation laws under Title VII.”\n\nId. at 504 (quoting City of Waco v. Lopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 153–55 (Tex. 2008)).\n\nAlthough we consider the plain language of Chapter 21 and state case-law\n\nprecedent in interpreting Chapter 21, because of its relationship to Title VII, we\n\nalso look to federal law for guidance in situations where Chapter 21 and Title VII\n\ncontain analogous statutory language. Id. at 505.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      Under Chapter 21,\n\n      An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of\n      race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the\n      employer:\n\n             (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an\n             individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an\n             individual in connection with compensation or the terms,\n             conditions, or privileges of employment; or\n\n             (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n             employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive\n             an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely\n             affect in any other manner the status of an employee.\nTEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.051.              Discrimination based on sex includes\n\ndiscrimination because of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Id.\n\n§ 21.106(a) (Vernon 2006). The employee may establish discrimination by either\n\ndirect or circumstantial evidence, or both.      Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 634, 638;\n\nQuantum Chem. Corp. v. Toennies, 47 S.W.3d 473, 476–77 (Tex. 2001).\n\nDirect vs. Circumstantial Evidence\n\n      At the outset, KIPP, in support of its arguments made in its second, third,\n\nand fourth issues that the trial court erred in denying its plea on Whitehead’s\n\nclaims against it for discrimination based on sex and race, first asserts that she “has\n\nno direct evidence” of discrimination, as Carter’s alleged behavior towards\n\nWhitehead was not “discriminatory in nature.” It further argues that none of\n\nCarter’s “comments, even if true, constitutes direct evidence of discrimination\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fbecause each requires an inference or presumption to discern a discriminatory\n\nanimus.” In response, Whitehead asserts that the comments that Carter made to\n\nher at their January 11, 2011 meeting do constitute direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       In an employment-discrimination case, if the employee produces direct\n\nevidence that discriminatory animus played a role in the decision at issue, the\n\nburden of persuasion shifts to the employer, who must prove that it would have\n\ntaken the same action regardless of discriminatory animus. Price Waterhouse v.\n\nHopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250–53, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 1790–92 (1989); Sandstad v. CB\n\nRichard Ellis, Inc., 309 F.3d 893, 896 (5th Cir. 2002); Walcott v. Tex. S. Univ., No.\n\n01-12-00355-CV, 2013 WL 593488, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Feb.\n\n14, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n      “Direct evidence of discrimination is evidence that, if believed, proves the\n\nfact of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption.” Jespersen v.\n\nSweetwater Ranch Apartments, 390 S.W.3d 644, 653 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no\n\npet.); see also Sandstad, 309 F.3d at 897. “If an inference is required for the\n\nevidence to be probative as to the employer’s discriminatory animus in making the\n\n[adverse] employment decision, the evidence is circumstantial, not direct.”\n\nJespersen, 390 S.W.3d at 653–54; see also Sandstad, 309 F.3d at 897–98.\n\nGenerally, statements that courts have found to constitute direct evidence of\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fdiscrimination are insults or slurs made against a protected group. See Jespersen,\n\n390 S.W.3d at 654; see also Davis v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 14 F.3d 1082, 1085\n\n(5th Cir. 1994) (discussing case in which supervisor routinely made open racial\n\nslurs); Martin v. Bayland Inc., 403 F. Supp. 2d 578, 582 (S.D. Tex. 2005), aff’d,\n\n181 F. App’x 422 (5th Cir. 2006).\n\n      Here, in deposition testimony attached to Whitehead’s response to KIPP’s\n\nplea to the jurisdiction, Whitehead testified that when she met with Carter about\n\nher job on January 11, 2011, Carter told her, “You don’t fit in. You don’t fit in\n\nanymore. I gave your job away.” Further, Carter stated, “You are just an overpaid\n\nteacher. . . . You just had a baby. I gave your job away. What do you want me to\n\ndo? You just don’t fit in.” And, “Things have changed. If you don’t like it, you\n\ncan . . . go work at Nordstrom’s.” Whitehead also explained that “Carter told [her]\n\nthat [she] couldn’t handle th[e] job having children.”\n\n      However, Whitehead has not alleged, and she did not produce evidence, that\n\nanyone from KIPP ever told her that she would not be returned to her previous job\n\nduties after her illness in August because she was pregnant. Nor did she allege or\n\npresent any evidence that anyone at KIPP made negative comments about her\n\npregnancy. 7 The evidence relied upon by Whitehead requires an inference or\n\n\n7\n      The only specific comment that Carter made to Whitehead about her pregnancy\n      was when she “rude[ly]” asked Whitehead, in October, why she was still at work\n      if her water had broken.\n\n\n                                         12\n\fpresumption that KIPP terminated her employment because of her pregnancy, and,\n\nthus, it is circumstantial. See Appel v. Inspire Pharm., Inc., 428 F. App’x 279, 282\n\n(5th Cir. 2011) (evidence employment terminated because employee could not\n\nperform her job duties due to medical complications resulting from pregnancy did\n\nnot constitute direct evidence of discrimination).\n\n      In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, an employee must make\n\nout a prima facie case of discrimination under the McDonnell-Douglas burden\n\nshifting analysis. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802–05, 93\n\nS. Ct. 1817, 1824–26 (1973); see also Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,\n\n530 U.S. 133, 142–43, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2106 (2000); Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nWilliams, No. 01-13-00052-CV, 2013 WL 4779693, at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] Sept. 5, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.); Jespersen, 390 S.W.3d at 654.\n\nUnder this analysis, the employee is entitled to a presumption of discrimination if\n\nshe meets the “minimal” initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 634.\n\n      To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the employee must show\n\nthat she: (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for her position;\n\n(3) suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) was replaced by someone\n\noutside of her protected class or others similarly situated were treated more\n\nfavorably (disparate-treatment cases). Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142, 120 S. Ct. at 2106;\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fAutoZone, Inc. v. Reyes, 272 S.W.3d 588, 592 (Tex. 2008). To establish a prima\n\nfacie case, the plaintiff is only required to make a minimal showing. El Paso\n\nCmty. Coll. v. Lawler, 349 S.W.3d 81, 86 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2010, pet. denied).\n\nSex Discrimination\n\n      In its second issue, KIPP specifically argues that Whitehead has not\n\nprovided evidence of the first element 8 of her sex-discrimination claim because she\n\nhas not shown that she was actually pregnant at the time that KIPP terminated her\n\nemployment. Whitehead responds that Chapter 21 does not require that a woman\n\nbe pregnant at the time of an adverse employment action based upon pregnancy.\n\n      Chapter 21 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees “on\n\nthe basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.” TEX. LAB.\n\nCODE ANN. § 21.106(a). Women who were pregnant at, or very near the time of,\n\nan adverse employment action are members of the protected class, as are women\n\nwho were on maternity leave, or who had recently returned to work at the time of\n\nthe adverse action. Helmes v. S. Colonie Cent. Sch. Dist., 564 F. Supp. 2d 137,\n\n147 (N.D.N.Y. 2008).      However, unlike other protected traits, “pregnancy is\n\nsomewhat divergent” because “‘it is not immutable,’ and at some point, ‘the\n\nfemale employee is no longer affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related\n\nconditions.’” Walker v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 1:12-CV-74-SA-DAS, 2013\n8\n      In its jurisdictional arguments, KIPP does not challenge the second and third\n      elements of Whitehead’s claim for sex discrimination.\n\n\n                                        14\n\fWL 3940662, at *7 (N.D. Miss. July 31, 2013) (quoting Solomen v. Redwood\n\nAdvisory Co., 183 F. Supp. 2d 748, 753 (E.D. Pa. 2002)). Thus, one of the primary\n\nissues presented in a case in which a woman is not pregnant at the time of an\n\nadverse employment action becomes where to “draw th[e] line.” Id. Accordingly,\n\nwhether the plaintiff is a member of the protected class in pregnancy\n\ndiscrimination cases is best determined on a “case-by-case basis.” Helmes, 564 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 147.\n\n      Here, Whitehead, in her original petition, alleges in pertinent part:\n\n            Plaintiff is a White female. . . .\n\n            In August 2010 Plaintiff became ill while pregnant. . . .\n\n             On October 5, 2010 Plaintiff returned to work and was assigned\n      job duties that were different from the job duties she discharged prior\n      to her going on medical leave. . . .\n\n            On November 2, 2010 Plaintiff went on pregnancy leave and\n      delivered a boy on November 3, 2010. Thereafter she was on\n      maternity leave for 19 days. She returned to work on December 3,\n      2010 . . . .\n\n           Upon returning to work Plaintiff asked for her old job back.\n      She was told that would happen after Christmas. . . .\n\n             On January 11, 2011 Plaintiff met with . . . Carter who told the\n      Plaintiff “You don’t fit i[n]. You just had a baby. You’re just an\n      overpaid teacher. I can’t afford your salary. I gave your job away.\n      You cannot do this job having children. Things have changed around\n      here. If you don’t like it, you need to apply to Nordstrom.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f            . . . On February 9, 2011 [Carter] called a Mid-Year\n     Performance Evaluation in the presence of 2 of Plaintiff’s coworkers.\n     Plaintiff was told she was not doing her job. . . .\n\n           . . . On February 17, 2011 . . . Carter called the Plaintiff into a\n     meeting with . . . Fimble in which she was handed a termination letter.\n\n             ....\n\n           . . . Because of her sex/pregnancy Plaintiff was a member of a\n     protected class which enjoyed the special protection of the law.\n     During her employment with [KIPP], [KIPP] treated the Plaintiff less\n     favorably in the terms and conditions of her employment than its\n     similarly situated, non-pregnant employees, because of her\n     sex/pregnancy. Plaintiff also was terminated because of pregnancy\n     and/or on account of her pregnancy leave and/or childbearing. The\n     acts of [KIPP] constitute discrimination against the Plaintiff in the\n     terms and conditions of her employment because of her pregnancy.\n     This discrimination is the proximate cause of both economic and\n     mental damages suffered by the Plaintiff.\n\n     Whitehead also attached evidence to her response to KIPP’s motions\n\nshowing that KIPP terminated her employment on February 17, 2011, less than\n\nthree months after she had returned from maternity leave, and KIPP does not\n\ndispute that it terminated her employment on this date. Further, near the time\n\nWhitehead was hospitalized and absent from work from August to October, Carter\n\ndiscussed with Fimble terminating Whitehead’s employment and Whitehead’s\n\npregnancy.\n\n      We conclude that Whitehead presented evidence establishing a prima facie\n\ncase that she was a “member of the protected class” in regard to her sex-\n\ndiscrimination claim based on her pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical\n\n                                        16\n\fissues. Her evidence that she returned to work from maternity leave on December\n\n3, 2010 and KIPP terminated her employment less than three months later is\n\nsufficient to create a fact issue as to her membership in the protected class. And\n\nthe existence of this fact issue precludes the granting of KIPPS’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227–28. Accordingly, we hold that the\n\ntrial court did not err in denying KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction on Whitehead’s\n\nsex-discrimination claim on the ground that she was not a member of a protected\n\nclass.\n\n         We overrule KIPP’s second issue.\n\n         In its third issue, KIPP specifically argues that Whitehead has not provided\n\nevidence of the fourth element of her sex-discrimination claim because she has not\n\nshown that she was replaced by someone outside of her protected class, i.e., a non-\n\npregnant person. It argues that she cannot logically do so because she was not\n\nactually pregnant when KIPP terminated her employment.\n\n         As discussed above, an employee does not have to be pregnant at the time of\n\nan adverse employment action to be a member of the class of individuals protected\n\nfrom sex discrimination based on pregnancy. Likewise, Whitehead did not have to\n\nbe pregnant to establish the “replacement” element of her prima facie case for\n\npregnancy discrimination.      Again, Chapter 21 specifically prohibits employers\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\ffrom discriminating against employees “on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or a\n\nrelated medical condition.” TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.106(a).\n\n      Here, Whitehead provided evidence that she was replaced by Dozier and/or\n\nNicole Santos, neither of whom, during the pertinent time period, had been\n\npregnant, given birth to a child, or suffered from a medical condition related to\n\npregnancy or childbirth. KIPP does not dispute these facts.\n\n      We conclude that Whitehead presented evidence establishing a prima facie\n\ncase that KIPP replaced her with someone outside of her protected class.\n\nWhitehead’s evidence that KIPP replaced her with either Dozier or Santos is\n\nsufficient to create a fact issue that she was replaced by someone who was not a\n\nmember of the protected class. And the existence of this fact issue precludes the\n\ngranting of KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227–28.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying KIPP’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction on Whitehead’s sex-discrimination claim on the ground that she was\n\nnot replaced with someone outside of her protected class.\n\n      We overrule KIPP’s third issue.\n\nRace Discrimination\n\n      In its fourth issue, KIPP argues that Whitehead has not established a prima\n\nfacie case of race discrimination because she cannot establish that she was replaced\n\nby an African-American employee. Whitehead argues that the trial court properly\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fdenied KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction on this ground because genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact exist as to whether she was replaced by Dozier, an African-American,\n\nor Santos, an Hispanic.\n\n      The prima facie elements of a race-discrimination claim are the same as\n\nthose for a sex-discrimination claim. In order to establish a prima facie case of\n\nrace discrimination, a plaintiff must show that she: (1) is a member of a protected\n\nclass; (2) was qualified for her position; (3) suffered an adverse employment\n\naction; and (4) was replaced by someone outside of her protected class. Vaughn v.\n\nWoodforest Bank, 665 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir. 2011).\n\n      Here, Whitehead, in her original petition, alleges in pertinent part:\n\n            Plaintiff is a White female. . . .\n\n            In August 2010 Plaintiff became ill while pregnant. . . .\n\n             On October 5, 2010 Plaintiff returned to work and was assigned\n      job duties that were different from the job duties she discharged prior\n      to her going on medical leave. During her absence, the person to\n      whom she reported, Jamila Singleton, was removed from her position\n      and was replaced by a new principal, . . . Carter. In her previous\n      position Plaintiff was replaced by . . . Dozier, African American. . . .\n\n            ....\n\n            Upon returning to work [from maternity leave] Plaintiff asked\n      for her old job back. She was told that would happen after\n      Christmas. . . .\n\n              On January 11, 2011 Plaintiff met with . . . Carter who told the\n      Plaintiff “You don’t fit i[n]. You just had a baby. You’re just an\n      overpaid teacher. I can’t afford your salary. I gave your job away.\n\n                                          19\n\f      You cannot do this job having children. Things have changed around\n      here. If you don’t like it, you need to apply to Nordstrom.”\n\n              Plaintiff refused to resign. Thereafter [Carter] became very\n      hostile toward the Plaintiff. On February 9, 2011 [Carter] called a\n      Mid-Year Performance Evaluation in the presence of 2 of Plaintiff’s\n      coworkers. Plaintiff was told she was not doing her job. The same\n      day she went in to HR and filed a complaint against . . . Carter\n      alleging FMLA discrimination, a hostile work environment, and race\n      discrimination. The race discrimination complaint was based\n      on . . . Carter, who is Black, telling the Plaintiff that she did not fit\n      i[n]. In contrast, Plaintiff is Caucasian, and at that time was the only\n      Caucasian employee on the Defendant’s administrative staff.\n      Everyone else was Black. Plaintiff was replaced by a Black person.\n\n            . . . On February 17, 2011 . . . Carter called the Plaintiff into a\n      meeting with . . . Fimble in which she was handed a termination letter.\n\n            ....\n\n             . . . Because of her race, White, Plaintiff was a member of a\n      protected class which enjoyed the special protection of the law.\n      During her employment with [KIPP], [KIPP] treated the Plaintiff less\n      favorably in the terms and conditions of her employment than its\n      similarly situated, yet nonprotected employees, because of her race.\n      The acts of [KIPP] constitute discrimination against the Plaintiff in the\n      terms and conditions of her employment because of her race.\n      Defendant terminated Plaintiff’s employment because of her race, and\n      preference for African-American employees. This discrimination is a\n      proximate cause of both economic and mental damages suffered by\n      the Plaintiff.\n\n      KIPP asserts that it presented evidence that it replaced Whitehead only\n\ntemporarily with Dozier and permanently with Santos when Dozier left KIPP.\n\nThus, according to KIPP, Whitehead cannot establish the prima facie element that\n\nKIPP replaced her with someone outside of her protected class.             However,\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fWhitehead did present evidence that KIPP replaced her with Dozier when it\n\nterminated Whitehead’s employment in February 2011, and she established that\n\nDozier, an African-American, is not a member of Whitehead’s protected class. See\n\nYoung v. City of Hous., Tex., 906 F.2d 177, 182 (5th Cir. 1990) (concluding fact\n\nquestion existed regarding when evidence showed employee alleging age\n\ndiscrimination replaced by someone older or younger than himself). Additionally,\n\nif Santos, an Hispanic, was Whitehead’s permanent replacement, she too, is not a\n\nmember of Whitehead’s protected class. See Arevalo v. Hous. Cmty. Coll., No. H-\n\n12-3607, 2013 WL 5168949, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 12, 2013) (concluding that\n\nHispanic plaintiff alleging replacement by white employee, not member of her\n\nprotected class, had alleged facts adequately stating claim for discrimination); Elsik\n\nv. Regency Nursing Ctr. Partners of Kingsville, Ltd., No. V-06-41, 2007 WL\n\n2428288, at *5 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 22, 2007) (stating Caucasian plaintiff established\n\nprima facie element of replacement by employee outside her protected class when\n\nreplaced by Hispanic male).\n\n      We conclude that Whitehead has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether KIPP replaced her with someone outside of her protected class.\n\nWhitehead’s evidence is sufficient to create a fact issue as to whether she was\n\nreplaced by someone who was not a member of the protected class. And the\n\nexistence of this fact issue precludes the granting of KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fSee Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227–28. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did\n\nnot err in denying KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction on Whitehead’s race-\n\ndiscrimination claim on the ground that she was not replaced with someone outside\n\nof her protected class.\n\n      We overrule KIPP’s fourth issue.\n\nPretext\n\n      In its fifth issue, KIPP asserts that Whitehead “failed to create a fact issue as\n\nto the legitimacy of all of KIPP’s nondiscriminatory and non-retaliatory reasons”\n\nfor terminating her employment. The Texas Supreme Court has explained that the\n\nprima facie elements of a Chapter 21 employment-discrimination claim are\n\njurisdictional, and thus, properly addressed in a plea to the jurisdiction. Garcia,\n\n372 S.W.3d at 634; see also Williams, 2013 WL 4779693, at *3 n.4 (“[T]he Texas\n\nSupreme Court determined in Garcia II that only the prima facie elements of the\n\nplaintiff[’]s case are jurisdictional.”). However, KIPP urges us to go further and\n\nconsider its argument on pretext because “the Supreme Court did not expressly\n\nhold that the pretext analysis is not jurisdictional.” (Emphasis added.) Essentially,\n\nKIPP asks us to place an additional burden on Whitehead beyond the establishment\n\nof her prima facie case. It asks us to require her to “rebut” KIPP’s reasons for\n\nterminating her employment and prove pretext in order to establish that the trial\n\ncourt had subject-matter jurisdiction over her claims.\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f      KIPP’s interlocutory appeal, however, is limited to those issues properly\n\nraised in its plea to the jurisdiction. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 51.014(a)(8) (Vernon Supp. 2013). The purpose of a plea to the jurisdiction is to\n\ndefeat an action “without regard to whether the claims asserted have merit.” Bland\n\nv. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000). And the Supreme\n\nCourt has specifically held that in an appellate review of a trial court’s grant or\n\ndenial of a jurisdictional plea, we review evidence only when necessary to resolve\n\nany dispute over jurisdictional facts. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226.\n\n      Accordingly, we only reach the merits of a plaintiff’s claims to the extent\n\nnecessary to resolve the dispute over jurisdictional facts, identified by the Supreme\n\nCourt as the elements of a prima facie case of employment discrimination. See\n\nWilliams, 2013 WL 4779693, at *3 n.4 (“Because our review of this interlocutory\n\nappeal is limited to the trial court’s determination of its own subject-matter\n\njurisdiction, we do not consider any matters beyond whether Williams presented a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination or retaliation.”). By asking us to consider its\n\npretext arguments, KIPP is asking us to consider facts and evidence beyond\n\nWhitehead’s “minimal” burden of establishing her prima facie Chapter 21\n\nemployment-discrimination claims. See State v. Lueck, 290 S.W.3d 876, 881–84\n\n(Tex. 2009). Under the appropriate standard of review applied to a jurisdictional\n\nplea, we may not do so.\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f      Accordingly, we overrule KIPP’s fifth issue.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the order of the trial court denying KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Terry Jennings\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Jennings, Higley, and Sharp.\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f",

Later, KIPP designated her as a “Facilitated Support Service\n\nemployee,” assisting teachers with failing students.\n\n          In summer 2010, KIPP hired Daphane Carter, who is African-American, as\n\nthe new “School Leader,” or principal.

CODE ANN. § 12.105 (Vernon 2012) (“An open-enrollment\n          charter school is part of the public school system of this state.”).\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fwork under the Family Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”). 6 Carter in turn assigned\n\nWhitehead’s duties to Andrea Dozier, who is also African-American, while\n\nWhitehead was out on FMLA leave.\n\n      Whitehead further alleges that when she returned to work from her FMLA\n\nleave on October 5, 2010, she “was assigned job duties that were different from the\n\njob duties she discharged prior to her . . . medical leave.” When she asked for her\n\njob duties to be reassigned to her, she “was told that would not happen because\n\n[she] was about to go on maternity leave,” but she “was assured that upon\n\nreturning from pregnancy leave, her old job duties would be given back to her.”\n\n      On November 2, 2010, Whitehead went on maternity leave, and she\n\ndelivered her baby the following day. When she returned to work on December 3,\n\n2010, she “asked for her old job back,” but was told “that would happen after\n\nChristmas.” When Whitehead met with Carter about her job on January 11, 2011,\n\nCarter then told her, “You don’t fit i[n]. You just had a baby. You’re just an\n\noverpaid teacher. I can’t afford your salary. I gave your job away. You cannot do\n\nthis job having children. Things have changed around here. If you don’t like it,\n\nyou need to apply at Nordstrom.”\n\n      Subsequently, after Whitehead refused to resign, “Carter became very\n\nhostile toward” her, and on February 9, 2011, during a job-performance evaluation,\n\n6\n      See 29 U.S.C. §§ 2612(a)(1), 2614(a)(1) (2012).\n\n\n                                          3\n\fCarter told her that she “was not doing her job.”         Immediately afterward,\n\nWhitehead filed a complaint with Chuck Fimble, KIPP’s Human Resources\n\nDirector, asserting “FMLA discrimination, a hostile work environment, and race\n\ndiscrimination.” On February 17, 2011, Carter called Whitehead into a meeting\n\nwith Fimble, and she handed Whitehead a letter terminating her employment.\n\n       Whitehead then filed a discrimination charge against KIPP with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and the Texas Commission on\n\nHuman Rights (“TCHR”), alleging retaliation and discrimination based on race and\n\nsex.\n\n       Whitehead filed the instant suit after the TCHR issued her a “right-to-sue”\n\nletter. KIPP answered and then filed a matter-of-law and no-evidence summary-\n\njudgment motion and a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting sovereign immunity. In\n\nits plea, KIPP argued that the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nand should dismiss the suit because Whitehead “cannot prove essential elements of\n\nher claims.” KIPP asserted that Whitehead lacked standing to assert a pregnancy-\n\ndiscrimination claim as she was not a member of a protected class, did not suffer\n\nan adverse employment action in connection with her race, cannot establish a\n\ncausal connection between her human-resources complaint and the termination of\n\nemployment, cannot demonstrate that KIPP’s stated rationale for terminating her\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\femployment was based on a pretext, and lacked evidence to support the essential\n\nelements of her claims.\n\n      Whitehead responded, arguing that the trial court had subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over her claims because her pleaded allegations establish “a prima\n\nfacie case of pregnancy and race discrimination.” The trial court denied KIPP’s\n\nplea to the jurisdiction and summary-judgment motions.\n\n                               Standard of Review\n\n      We review de novo a trial court’s ruling on a jurisdictional plea.

Thus, the court can consider\n\nevidence as necessary to resolve any dispute over the jurisdictional facts, even if\n\nthe evidence “implicates both the subject matter jurisdiction of the court and the\n\nmerits of the case.” Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. The defendant is required to\n\nmeet the summary-judgment standard of proof on its assertion that the trial court\n\nlacks jurisdiction; once the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff is then required\n\nto show that there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional issue.

App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.).\n\n       The Texas Legislature has provided a limited waiver of sovereign and\n\ngovernmental immunity for employment discrimination and retaliation claims\n\nfalling within Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. See TEX. LAB. CODE ANN.\n\n§§ 21.051(1), 21.055 (Vernon 2006) (prohibiting unlawful employment practices\n\nby “employer”); see also id. § 21.002(8)(D) (Vernon Supp. 2013) (defining\n\n“employer” to include “a county, municipality, state agency, or state\n\ninstrumentality”). To establish waiver, a plaintiff must plead the elements of her\n\nstatutory cause of action, i.e., the basic facts that make up a prima facie case, so\n\nthat a court can determine whether she has sufficiently alleged a violation under\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fChapter 21; she will only be required to submit evidence if the defendant presents\n\nevidence negating one of those basic facts. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 637.\n\n      Although the Texas Legislature has waived immunity for suits brought\n\nagainst school districts under Chapter 21, immunity is waived only for those suits\n\nin which “the plaintiff actually alleges a violation” of Chapter 21 “by pleading\n\nfacts that state a claim thereunder.” Garcia, 372 S.W.3d at 636. In other words, a\n\nplaintiff must actually allege a violation of Chapter 21 in order for there to be a\n\nwaiver from suit. Id. at 636–37. Failure by a plaintiff to allege a Chapter 21\n\nviolation means the court has no jurisdiction and the claim should be dismissed.\n\nId. at 637. This standard does not require the plaintiff to marshal evidence and\n\nprove her claim. Id. Again, the plaintiff is required to submit evidence only if the\n\ndefendant presents evidence negating one of those basic facts. Id.\n\n                          Employment Discrimination\n\n      In its second and third issues, KIPP argues that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying its plea to the jurisdiction on Whitehead’s claim against it for\n\ndiscrimination based on sex because (1) she was not “a member of a protected\n\nclass based on pregnancy when she was not pregnant at the time” it terminated her\n\nemployment and (2) “neither she nor her replacements were pregnant.” In its\n\nfourth issue, KIPP argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea on\n\nWhitehead’s claim against it for discrimination based on race because she cannot\n\n\n                                         8\n\festablish she was “replaced by an African-American employee.” In its fifth issue,\n\nKIPP argues that the trial court erred in denying its plea on Whitehead’s claims\n\nagainst it for discrimination based on both sex and race because she did not\n\nestablish that its “legitimate, nondiscriminatory . . . reasons for terminating her\n\nemployment were pretextual.”\n\n      Whitehead brings her claims against KIPP for employment discrimination,\n\nbased on sex and race, under Chapter 21. See TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. §§ 21.001–\n\n.556 (Vernon 2006 & Supp. 2013).             Chapter 21 “is a comprehensive fair\n\nemployment practices act and remedial scheme, modeled after Title VII of the\n\nfederal Civil Rights Act of 1964,” which “provides the framework for employment\n\ndiscrimination claims in Texas.” Prairie View A & M Univ. v.

Whitehead responds that Chapter 21 does not require that a woman\n\nbe pregnant at the time of an adverse employment action based upon pregnancy.\n\n      Chapter 21 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees “on\n\nthe basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.” TEX.

Women who were pregnant at, or very near the time of,\n\nan adverse employment action are members of the protected class, as are women\n\nwho were on maternity leave, or who had recently returned to work at the time of\n\nthe adverse action.

Thus, one of the primary\n\nissues presented in a case in which a woman is not pregnant at the time of an\n\nadverse employment action becomes where to “draw th[e] line.” Id. Accordingly,\n\nwhether the plaintiff is a member of the protected class in pregnancy\n\ndiscrimination cases is best determined on a “case-by-case basis.” Helmes, 564 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 147.\n\n      Here, Whitehead, in her original petition, alleges in pertinent part:\n\n            Plaintiff is a White female. . . .\n\n            In August 2010 Plaintiff became ill while pregnant. . . .\n\n             On October 5, 2010 Plaintiff returned to work and was assigned\n      job duties that were different from the job duties she discharged prior\n      to her going on medical leave. . . .\n\n            On November 2, 2010 Plaintiff went on pregnancy leave and\n      delivered a boy on November 3, 2010. Thereafter she was on\n      maternity leave for 19 days. She returned to work on December 3,\n      2010 . . . .\n\n           Upon returning to work Plaintiff asked for her old job back.\n      She was told that would happen after Christmas. . . .\n\n             On January 11, 2011 Plaintiff met with . . . Carter who told the\n      Plaintiff “You don’t fit i[n]. You just had a baby. You’re just an\n      overpaid teacher. I can’t afford your salary. I gave your job away.\n      You cannot do this job having children. Things have changed around\n      here. If you don’t like it, you need to apply to Nordstrom.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f            . . . On February 9, 2011 [Carter] called a Mid-Year\n     Performance Evaluation in the presence of 2 of Plaintiff’s coworkers.\n     Plaintiff was told she was not doing her job. . . .\n\n           . . . On February 17, 2011 . . . Carter called the Plaintiff into a\n     meeting with . . . Fimble in which she was handed a termination letter.\n\n             ....\n\n           . . . Because of her sex/pregnancy Plaintiff was a member of a\n     protected class which enjoyed the special protection of the law.\n     During her employment with [KIPP], [KIPP] treated the Plaintiff less\n     favorably in the terms and conditions of her employment than its\n     similarly situated, non-pregnant employees, because of her\n     sex/pregnancy. Plaintiff also was terminated because of pregnancy\n     and/or on account of her pregnancy leave and/or childbearing. The\n     acts of [KIPP] constitute discrimination against the Plaintiff in the\n     terms and conditions of her employment because of her pregnancy.\n     This discrimination is the proximate cause of both economic and\n     mental damages suffered by the Plaintiff.\n\n     Whitehead also attached evidence to her response to KIPP’s motions\n\nshowing that KIPP terminated her employment on February 17, 2011, less than\n\nthree months after she had returned from maternity leave, and KIPP does not\n\ndispute that it terminated her employment on this date. Further, near the time\n\nWhitehead was hospitalized and absent from work from August to October, Carter\n\ndiscussed with Fimble terminating Whitehead’s employment and Whitehead’s\n\npregnancy.\n\n      We conclude that Whitehead presented evidence establishing a prima facie\n\ncase that she was a “member of the protected class” in regard to her sex-\n\ndiscrimination claim based on her pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical\n\n                                        16\n\fissues. Her evidence that she returned to work from maternity leave on December\n\n3, 2010 and KIPP terminated her employment less than three months later is\n\nsufficient to create a fact issue as to her membership in the protected class. And\n\nthe existence of this fact issue precludes the granting of KIPPS’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227–28. Accordingly, we hold that the\n\ntrial court did not err in denying KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction on Whitehead’s\n\nsex-discrimination claim on the ground that she was not a member of a protected\n\nclass.\n\n         We overrule KIPP’s second issue.\n\n         In its third issue, KIPP specifically argues that Whitehead has not provided\n\nevidence of the fourth element of her sex-discrimination claim because she has not\n\nshown that she was replaced by someone outside of her protected class, i.e., a non-\n\npregnant person. It argues that she cannot logically do so because she was not\n\nactually pregnant when KIPP terminated her employment.\n\n         As discussed above, an employee does not have to be pregnant at the time of\n\nan adverse employment action to be a member of the class of individuals protected\n\nfrom sex discrimination based on pregnancy. Likewise, Whitehead did not have to\n\nbe pregnant to establish the “replacement” element of her prima facie case for\n\npregnancy discrimination.      Again, Chapter 21 specifically prohibits employers\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\ffrom discriminating against employees “on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or a\n\nrelated medical condition.” TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.106(a).\n\n      Here, Whitehead provided evidence that she was replaced by Dozier and/or\n\nNicole Santos, neither of whom, during the pertinent time period, had been\n\npregnant, given birth to a child, or suffered from a medical condition related to\n\npregnancy or childbirth. KIPP does not dispute these facts.\n\n      We conclude that Whitehead presented evidence establishing a prima facie\n\ncase that KIPP replaced her with someone outside of her protected class.\n\nWhitehead’s evidence that KIPP replaced her with either Dozier or Santos is\n\nsufficient to create a fact issue that she was replaced by someone who was not a\n\nmember of the protected class. And the existence of this fact issue precludes the\n\ngranting of KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227–28.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying KIPP’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction on Whitehead’s sex-discrimination claim on the ground that she was\n\nnot replaced with someone outside of her protected class.\n\n      We overrule KIPP’s third issue.\n\nRace Discrimination\n\n      In its fourth issue, KIPP argues that Whitehead has not established a prima\n\nfacie case of race discrimination because she cannot establish that she was replaced\n\nby an African-American employee. Whitehead argues that the trial court properly\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fdenied KIPP’s plea to the jurisdiction on this ground because genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact exist as to whether she was replaced by Dozier, an African-American,\n\nor Santos, an Hispanic.\n\n      The prima facie elements of a race-discrimination claim are the same as\n\nthose for a sex-discrimination claim. In order to establish a prima facie case of\n\nrace discrimination, a plaintiff must show that she: (1) is a member of a protected\n\nclass; (2) was qualified for her position; (3) suffered an adverse employment\n\naction; and (4) was replaced by someone outside of her protected class.

During her absence, the person to\n      whom she reported, Jamila Singleton, was removed from her position\n      and was replaced by a new principal, . . . Carter. In her previous\n      position Plaintiff was replaced by . . . Dozier, African American. . . .\n\n            ....\n\n            Upon returning to work [from maternity leave] Plaintiff asked\n      for her old job back. She was told that would happen after\n      Christmas. . . .\n\n              On January 11, 2011 Plaintiff met with . . . Carter who told the\n      Plaintiff “You don’t fit i[n]. You just had a baby. You’re just an\n      overpaid teacher. I can’t afford your salary.

If you don’t like it, you need to apply to Nordstrom.”\n\n              Plaintiff refused to resign. Thereafter [Carter] became very\n      hostile toward the Plaintiff. On February 9, 2011 [Carter] called a\n      Mid-Year Performance Evaluation in the presence of 2 of Plaintiff’s\n      coworkers. Plaintiff was told she was not doing her job. The same\n      day she went in to HR and filed a complaint against . . . Carter\n      alleging FMLA discrimination, a hostile work environment, and race\n      discrimination. The race discrimination complaint was based\n      on . . . Carter, who is Black, telling the Plaintiff that she did not fit\n      i[n]. In contrast, Plaintiff is Caucasian, and at that time was the only\n      Caucasian employee on the Defendant’s administrative staff.\n      Everyone else was Black. Plaintiff was replaced by a Black person.\n\n            . . . On February 17, 2011 . . . Carter called the Plaintiff into a\n      meeting with . . . Fimble in which she was handed a termination letter.\n\n            ....\n\n             . . . Because of her race, White, Plaintiff was a member of a\n      protected class which enjoyed the special protection of the law.\n      During her employment with [KIPP], [KIPP] treated the Plaintiff less\n      favorably in the terms and conditions of her employment than its\n      similarly situated, yet nonprotected employees, because of her race.\n      The acts of [KIPP] constitute discrimination against the Plaintiff in the\n      terms and conditions of her employment because of her race.\n      Defendant terminated Plaintiff’s employment because of her race, and\n      preference for African-American employees. This discrimination is a\n      proximate cause of both economic and mental damages suffered by\n      the Plaintiff.\n\n      KIPP asserts that it presented evidence that it replaced Whitehead only\n\ntemporarily with Dozier and permanently with Santos when Dozier left KIPP.\n\nThus, according to KIPP, Whitehead cannot establish the prima facie element that\n\nKIPP replaced her with someone outside of her protected class.             However,\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fWhitehead did present evidence that KIPP replaced her with Dozier when it\n\nterminated Whitehead’s employment in February 2011, and she established that\n\nDozier, an African-American, is not a member of Whitehead’s protected class.

The Texas Supreme Court has explained that the\n\nprima facie elements of a Chapter 21 employment-discrimination claim are\n\njurisdictional, and thus, properly addressed in a plea to the jurisdiction. Garcia,\n\n372 S.W.3d at 634; see also Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4779693</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 n.4 (“[T]he Texas\n\nSupreme Court determined in Garcia II that only the prima facie elements of the\n\nplaintiff[’]s case are jurisdictional.”). However, KIPP urges us to go further and\n\nconsider its argument on pretext because “the Supreme Court did not expressly\n\nhold that the pretext analysis is not jurisdictional.” (Emphasis added.) Essentially,\n\nKIPP asks us to place an additional burden on Whitehead beyond the establishment\n\nof her prima facie case. It asks us to require her to “rebut” KIPP’s reasons for\n\nterminating her employment and prove pretext in order to establish that the trial\n\ncourt had subject-matter jurisdiction over her claims.\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f      KIPP’s interlocutory appeal, however, is limited to those issues properly\n\nraised in its plea to the jurisdiction. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 51.014(a)(8) (Vernon Supp. 2013). The purpose of a plea to the jurisdiction is to\n\ndefeat an action “without regard to whether the claims asserted have merit.” Bland\n\nv. Indep. Sch. Dist. v.

Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226.\n\n      Accordingly, we only reach the merits of a plaintiff’s claims to the extent\n\nnecessary to resolve the dispute over jurisdictional facts, identified by the Supreme\n\nCourt as the elements of a prima facie case of employment discrimination.
