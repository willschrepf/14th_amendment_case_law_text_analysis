Deciding who is the appropriate legal representative of the State of Louisiana and its codefendant agencies will be determinative of the pending appeal and may significantly impact on the resolution of the related appeal on the merits of the federal litigation involving Louisiana's system of higher education.   That appeal bears our docket number 90-3874 and is stayed pending a decision by the United States Supreme Court which may be relevant to its resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Style of the Case</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The style of the case is \"State of Louisiana, Ex Rel., William J.

Guste, Jr., in his official capacity as Attorney General for the State of Louisiana, versus Buddy Roemer, Charles E. \"Buddy\" Roemer, III, Governor, Et Al.,\" bearing number 90-3864 on the docket of this court, on appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, bearing that court's docket designation of 80-3300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Statement of Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have agreed to the following joint statement of relevant facts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. On March 14, 1974, the United States (the \"Government\") instituted a lawsuit against the State of Louisiana (the \"State\") and its higher education boards alleging violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The State answered the Government's complaint through its Attorney General, William J. Guste, Jr., on May 10, 1974.   The State denied liability, claiming that \"Defendants have done nothing to perpetuate dualism in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 since enactment of said Act, and instead defendants have eliminated racial discrimination at all institutions under its supervision.\"   Appellant's Record Ex.  E. Louisiana claimed \"complete compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" and complete good faith compliance with the letter and spirit of the fourteenth amendment by its \"open door policy on admissions, on hiring their faculty and staff, and with regard to all other aspects of higher education.\"   Id.  The State's answer specifically identified the four-board higher education governing system as coming into existence with the new Louisiana Constitution of 1974, more than a decade after the end of de jure segregation, precluding the four-board system from being a \"vestige\" thereof.   Appellant's Record Ex.  E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Louisiana's multiple-board governance structure for higher education is specifically established in Article VIII of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974.   The multiple-board system was adopted by a vote of the people of Louisiana who expressly chose \"Alternative A,\" a multi-board system, over \"Alternative B,\" governance solely by a Board of Regents.   RECORDS OF THE LOUISIANA CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1973:  LOUISIANA CONSTITUTION OF 1974, Vol. III, pp. 28-29.   See also Part IV of Article XIV of Louisiana Constitution (1974) reported in West's LSA-Constitution, Vol. 1, p. 1134 and Vol. 2, pp. 984-988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Neither the Governor nor the Attorney General is a party to the higher education discrimination suit and neither has sought to intervene as a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Attorney General Guste and his staff were original counsel for the State and represented it as sole counsel from the outset of the litigation on March 14, 1974, through the initial pleadings, discovery, and filing of the September 8, 1981 Consent Decree, to which the Attorney General, through an assistant, was the sole signatory on behalf of the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The parties entered into the Consent Decree without any admission of liability.   The Consent Decree was approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.   See United States v. Louisiana, 527 F.Supp. 509 (E.D.La.1981).   The earlier history of this case can be gleaned from United States v. Louisiana, 543 F.2d 1125 (5th Cir.1976);  United States v. Louisiana, 90 F.R.D. 358 (E.D.La.1981), aff'd, United States v.

During the implementation of the Consent Decree, from September 8, 1981, through its expiration on December 31, 1987, Attorney General Guste and his staff members were the exclusive attorneys for the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. Upon expiration of the Consent Decree, the district court requested that the parties submit motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. On March 9, 1988, John N. Kennedy wrote to United States District Judge Charles Schwartz regarding the higher education desegregation case, telling the district court:  \"I represent Governor-Elect Buddy Roemer, Governor-Elect of the State of Louisiana.\"   R.Doc. 222 (Appellant's Record Ex.

The Louisiana Board of Regents (\"Regents\") also filed a motion for summary judgment and lengthy supporting memorandum contesting liability.   R.Doc. 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11.

In a Minute Entry dated October 7, 1988, the district court stated that, \"[o]n or before Monday, November 14, 1988, each party shall submit in quadruplicate copies of any proposed remedial plans and memorandum of his, her or its position regarding the matters....\"  R.Doc. 286.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">13. On December 2, 1988, the district court designated Paul R. Verkuil, former Dean of Tulane University Law School and current President of William &amp; Mary college, as a Special Master to make recommendations to the court regarding remedy.   R.Doc. 299.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">14.

The Motion to Enroll designated Kennedy and Levin as trial attorneys, Calobrisi as additional counsel of record and DeCuir as resident attorney.   Id.  The district court thereafter designated Kennedy as attorney, DeCuir as local attorney and Levin and Calobrisi as additional counsel.   See id.   At this time, the litigation was in the remedial phase of this bi-furcated proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">16. On March 6, 1989, the State, acting through Governor Roemer, filed a Memorandum in Support of Proposed Plan to Desegregate the System of Public Higher Education in the State of Louisiana Submitted by Governor Charles E. \"Buddy\" Roemer, III, R.Doc. 371, which requested that \"[t]he Court should exercise its equitable powers to create a single governing board for the higher education system of Louisiana as part of any such decree.\"   Id. at 26.   The certificate of service of this Memorandum, signed by Levin, shows no service on the Attorney General, who was co-counsel for the State.   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">17.

On March 14, 1974, the United States (the \"Government\") instituted a lawsuit against the State of Louisiana (the \"State\") and its higher education boards alleging violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The State answered the Government's complaint through its Attorney General, William J. Guste, Jr., on May 10, 1974.   The State denied liability, claiming that \"Defendants have done nothing to perpetuate dualism in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 since enactment of said Act, and instead defendants have eliminated racial discrimination at all institutions under its supervision.\"   Appellant's Record Ex.  E. Louisiana claimed \"complete compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" and complete good faith compliance with the letter and spirit of the fourteenth amendment by its \"open door policy on admissions, on hiring their faculty and staff, and with regard to all other aspects of higher education.\"   Id.  The State's answer specifically identified the four-board higher education governing system as coming into existence with the new Louisiana Constitution of 1974, more than a decade after the end of de jure segregation, precluding the four-board system from being a \"vestige\" thereof.

Louisiana's multiple-board governance structure for higher education is specifically established in Article VIII of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974.   The multiple-board system was adopted by a vote of the people of Louisiana who expressly chose \"Alternative A,\" a multi-board system, over \"Alternative B,\" governance solely by a Board of Regents.
