We hold that it may not.\n\nJacob Eisenberg appeals the district court's denial of his motion for\na preliminary injunction to compel his admittance to the math and sci-\nence magnet program at Rosemary Hills Elementary School. Jacob\noriginally applied for a transfer to Rosemary Hills Elementary School\nfor the 1998-99 school year, his first grade year, and was denied his\nrequest by Montgomery County on May 15, 1998 due to the \"impact\non diversity.\" Jacob is currently preparing to enter the second grade\nat Glen Haven Elementary, his assigned school, based on his resi-\ndence. On his transfer request application, Jacob identified his\nracial/ethnic group as \"White, not of Hispanic origin,\" and accord-\ningly, under Montgomery County's transfer policy, particularly its\n\n                    2\n\f\"diversity profile,\"1 he was not allowed to transfer out of Glen Haven\nElementary School. We reverse the district court's order denying\nJacob's motion for a preliminary injunction and remand this case for\naction consistent with this opinion.\n\nI.\n\nMontgomery County educates more than 125,000 elementary and\nsecondary students enrolled at over 183 schools spread throughout\n500 square miles. The County has never been subject to a court order\nfor desegregation,2 rather, Montgomery County by its voluntary\nefforts dismantled the former segregated school system. One aspect\nof its efforts included the implementation of magnet school programs,3\nwhich would attract and retain diverse student enrollment on a volun-\ntary basis to schools outside the area in which the student lives. A\nmagnet program emphasizing math and science is located at Rose-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 The Superintendent, Dr. Paul L. Vance, stated in his August 6, 1998\nletter regarding Jacob's Transfer Appeal that \"[t]he diversity profile\ngroup ... means that white students cannot transfer out of Glen Haven\nElementary School unless there is a unique hardship circumstance.\"\n\n2 Likewise, there has never been a judicial finding of a constitutional\nviolation within Montgomery County's educational setting. In 1981,\nhowever, the Office of Civil Rights investigated a parent's complaint\nfiled against Montgomery County alleging that it was\"resegregating\nRosemary Hills Primary School by improperly approving student trans-\nfers ... without the approval of the Quality Integrated Education team,\"\nthereby failing to prevent minority isolation at Rosemary Hills. Mont-\ngomery County's transfer policy at issue here was adopted in response\nto this complaint. The fact that Rosemary Hills was the subject of the\n1981 action is entirely coincidental to, and has no relevance to, the fact\nthat the Rosemary Hills magnet school program is the subject of this\ncase.\n\n3 Magnet programs offer enriched curricula emphasizing specific areas;\ne.g., science, math, or a foreign language. In fact, admission to Rosemary\nHills magnet school is not based on merit. Montgomery County points\nout that if Rosemary Hills receives more transfer requests than it has\nseats, the names of the eligible students are placed in a lottery and\nselected randomly. See County Br. at 9, n.4. This being true, Jacob would\nnot have been eligible for the lottery because he was not allowed to\ntransfer out of Glen Haven based on his race.\n\n                    3\n\fmary Hills Elementary School. Montgomery County permits volun-\ntary transfers from an assigned school to another school under certain\ncircumstances as outlined in its School Transfer Information Booklet.4\n\nMontgomery County considers, in stages, several factors in the\nconsideration of a voluntary transfer request: first, school stability;5\nsecond, utilization/enrollment; third, diversity profile; and last, the\nreason for the request. All of the transfer applications are considered\nconcurrently, and if the assigned school and the requested school are\nruled stable, the transfer request is reviewed for utiliza-\ntion/enrollment. An underutilized school is operating below 80%\ncapacity and an overutilized school is operating above 100% capacity.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 Throughout its Transfer Booklet and its briefs, Montgomery County\nuses the terms \"county-wide average,\" \"average county-wide range,\" and\nin one footnote in its Reply Brief, \"one-and-one-half standard devia-\ntions,\" to describe the method used to compare the racial/ethnic student\npopulation in each particular school to that of other schools and to the\noverall racial/ethnic student population enrolled in Montgomery County\nPublic Schools. These terms are interchangeably and indistinguishably\nused by Montgomery County with no apparent recognition of the ordi-\nnary true meanings of each term. For instance, an average is \"exactly or\napproximately the quotient obtained by dividing the sum total of a set of\nfigures by the number of figures.\" Webster's Ninth New Collegiate\nDictionary 119 (9th ed. 1985). A range is defined as \"the difference\nbetween the least and the greatest values of an attribute.\" Webster's\nNinth New Collegiate Dictionary 974 (9th ed. 1985); see also David W.\nBarnes, Statistics as Proof 77 (1983) (explaining a range as \"the distance\nbetween the largest and smallest numbers.\"). A standard deviation \"rep-\nresents the typical [variation] from the mean or expected value for a pop-\nulation (or list of numbers).\" David W. Barnes, Statistics as Proof 81\n(1983). For our purposes in this opinion, we have assumed that each of\nthese terms refers to the actual percentage of students in a racial/ethnic\ngroup within the student population enrolled in each of the Montgomery\nCounty Public Schools, and, as well, the percentage of students in each\nof the various racial/ethnic groups in the student population of the Mont-\ngomery County Public Schools, taken as a whole.\n\n5 Stability refers to whether the assigned school and the requested\nschool are undergoing a boundary change, consolidation, or renovation\nthat requires students to attend school at an alternative site or whether\neither school is undergoing some other change that requires the enroll-\nment to remain stabilized.\n\n                    4\n\fThe utilization factor for each school is determined prior to the receipt\nof transfer requests and is indicated, for each school in the system, in\nthe Transfer Booklet. Overutilization or underutilization may affect a\ntransfer request, in fact, Montgomery County states that these transfer\nrequest(s) usually will be denied.6 Along with utilization, enrollment\nis considered to ensure that schools remain within the preferred range\nof enrollment.7 If these factors are not a concern, Montgomery County\nlooks to the diversity of the student body of the assigned and the\nrequested schools.\n\nA. Diversity Profile\n\nAccording to the Transfer Booklet, \"[t]ransfers that negatively\naffect diversity are usually denied.\" Students are identified according\nto their racial/ethnic group: African American, Asian, Hispanic, and\nWhite. Montgomery County compares the countywide percentage for\neach racial/ethnic group to the percentage of each group attending a\nparticular school, and also determines whether the percentage of each\nracial/ethnic group in that school has either increased or decreased\nover the past three years. Based on that information, Montgomery\nCounty then assigns to each racial/ethnic group within each school a\ndiversity category.8\n\nCategories 1 and 2 are reserved for the racial/ethnic group popula-\ntions within a school, the percentages of which are higher than the\ncountywide percentage for that particular group. Category 1 refers to\nracial groups, the percentage of which is higher than the countywide\npercentage for that group and has increased over time rather than\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 Each school has an \"O\" or a \"U\" or a blank space (if the utilization\nis optimal).\n\n7 The preferred range of enrollment refers to the number of classes of\nstudents per grade for elementary schools. For example, 2 to 4 classes of\nstudents per grade is preferred in elementary schools. If a school with\nsufficient capacity fails to meet [has fewer classes than] the preferred\nrange, transfers out of that school are usually not permitted.\n\n8 If the percentage of the identified racial/ethnic group within a school\nis within the countywide percentage for that group and is expected to\nremain the same for the near future, that racial/ethnic group will not be\nassigned a diversity category.\n\n                       5\n\fmoved closer to the countywide percentage. Transfers usually will not\nbe permitted by a student into a school with a designated category 1\nfor his racial/ethnic group because his racial/ethnic group percentage\nat that requested transfer school is already higher than the countywide\npercentage. Category 2 refers to racial/ethnic populations which,\nalthough higher than the countywide percentage, have tended to\ndecline over time. Some transfers are permitted into this group. Cate-\ngories 3 and 4 indicate a racial/ethnic percentage within a school that\nis below the countywide percentage. Category 3 is reserved for those\nracial/ethnic groups, the percentage of which has tended to decline\nover time; while category 4 includes those populations the percentage\nof which has tended to increase. For example, \"if a particular school\nhas had a declining white enrollment over the preceding three year\nperiod and is substantially below the average [c]ounty-wide enroll-\nment of white students [a Category 3], the District may restrict trans-\nfers of white students out of that school because they would\ncontribute to that school becoming racially isolated.\"9 County Br. at\n7. As is the County's, the diversity profile for each school is\nreevaluated and adjusted annually.\n\nB. Jacob's Transfer Application\n\nIn March of 1998, Jacob's parents submitted a request that he be\ntransferred from Glen Haven to Rosemary Hills to begin the first\ngrade, reasoning that Jacob's \"personal and academic potential\"\nwould benefit from the school's math and science emphasis. His\ntransfer request was approved by his kindergarten teaching team.\nJacob, as a white student, was part of a category 3 group at Glen\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9 Jacob faced this very situation. Glen Haven, his assigned school, and\nRosemary Hills, his requested school, had the following notations for uti-\nlization and for diversity profile:\n\nSchool     UtilizationAfrican- Asian Hispanic White\n                      American\n___________________________________________________________\nGlen Haven Overutiliz. 1              1       3\n___________________________________________________________\nRosemary                       3\nHills\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n                    6\n\fHaven Elementary School because at the time of Jacob's transfer\nrequest, Glen Haven's student body was 24.1% white compared to the\nMontgomery County-wide percentage of 53.4%, and the white enroll-\nment at Glen Haven dropped from 38.9% in 1994-95 to 24.1% in\n1997-98. See Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Public Sch., 19 F.\nSupp. 2d 449, 451 (D. Md. 1998). On May 15, 1998, his transfer was\ndenied. The sole reason given by Montgomery County for the denial\nwas \"impact on diversity,\" that is to say because Jacob was white.\nJacob did not demonstrate a \"unique personal hardship\"10 to obtain an\nexemption from the denial based on the negative impact on diversity.\nThe Eisenbergs submitted their appeal first to the Superintendent, and\nthen to the Board of Education, which denied the transfer request on\nAugust 26, 1998.\n\nJacob's parents sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as\ndamages on behalf of Jacob in the district court under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, the Equal Protection Clause, and under 42 U.S.C. § 2000(d).\nThe district court denied the Eisenbergs' motion for a preliminary\ninjunction on September 9, 1998 on the basis that the Eisenbergs\nmade an insufficient showing of likelihood of success on the merits.11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 Five white students, out of 19 who applied, were permitted to trans-\nfer out of Glen Haven for the 1998-99 school year on a personal hardship\nbasis. Four of these transfers were permitted because the transferring stu-\ndent had a sibling already attending the requested school.\n\n11 The district court applied the Fourth Circuit's standards for injunc-\ntive relief, see Blackwelder Furniture Co. of Statesville, Inc. v. Seilig.\nMfg. Co., Inc., 550 F.2d 189 (4th Cir. 1977), and first considered the\nthreat of irreparable harm to Jacob should the court not issue an injunc-\ntion, and the likely harm to Montgomery County if an injunction should\nbe ordered, and then balanced these two interests. See Eisenberg, 19 F.\nSupp. 2d at 452 (citing Manning v. Hunt, 119 F.3d 254, 263 (4th Cir.\n1997)). Next, the court considered the likelihood that the plaintiff would\nsucceed on the merits noting that as the likelihood of harm to the defen-\ndant increased, the burden on the plaintiff to demonstrate likelihood of\nsuccess also increased. See Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at 452. Finally, the\ncourt accounted for the public interest. See Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at\n452.\n\nIn this instance, the district court concluded that the balance of hard-\nships favored Montgomery County, though only slightly. Thus, the court\nlooked to the Eisenbergs to make a strong showing regarding their likeli-\nhood of success on the merits. Finding none, the district court denied\ntheir motion for preliminary injunction.\n\n                    7\n\fThe district court concluded that Montgomery County's asserted\ninterests in both the diversity of its student body and avoidance of\npotential segregative enrollment patterns were each sufficiently com-\npelling governmental interests to justify the transfer policy's race\nbased classifications under a \"strict scrutiny\" review applied in Equal\nProtection cases.12 See Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at 453-54. The dis-\ntrict court further concluded that the transfer policy had \"been\ndesigned as narrowly as possible while still furthering [Montgomery\nCounty's] stated interests.\" Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at 455.\n\nFollowing the denial of the preliminary injunction, the Eisenbergs\nappealed to this court and Jacob entered the first grade at his assigned\nschool, Glen Haven. We review the denial of the preliminary injunc-\ntion de novo since the district court based its decision solely on a\npremise and interpretation of the applicable rule of law and the facts\nare established. See Williams v. United States Merit Sys. Protection\nBd., 15 F.3d 46, 48 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\nII.\n\n\"Race is the perpetual American dilemma.\" J. H. Wilkinson, III,\nFrom Brown to Bakke 8 (1979). Once again, we find ourselves\naddressing a most difficult issue in the familiar setting of our public\nschools. The facts also appear all too familiar-- a child has been\ndenied access to a state funded educational opportunity because of the\ncolor of his skin.13 In this case there is no denial that racial classifica-\ntions result in the denial of a certain number of transfers because\nMontgomery County fears racial imbalance within its schools, and to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12 The district court said that it applied the strict scrutiny review fash-\nioned in Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opin-\nion). \"A challenged policy or decision can survive such `strict scrutiny'\nreview only if it is justified by a `compelling governmental interest' and\nis `narrowly tailored' to accomplish that goal.\" Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp.\n2d at 452.\n\n13 Although the Montgomery County transfer policy uses the same\nmethod in considering all students within all racial/ethnic groups, at the\nindividual school level, an African American student may be denied\naccess due to his category designation, where a White student would be\ngranted his transfer request, and vice versa.\n\n                    8\n\fcombat this potential problem, Montgomery County employs a race-\nconscious nonremedial transfer policy which amounts to racial bal-\nancing.\n\nA.\n\nInitially, the district court erred when it failed to adhere to, or even\nto mention, the presumption against race based classifications. See\nPersonnel Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979)\n(\"racial classification, regardless of purported motivation, is presump-\ntively invalid and can be upheld only on extraordinary justification.\").\nIn Podberesky v. Kirwan, (Podberesky II), a case involving an exclu-\nsively African-American scholarship program at the University of\nMaryland, we emphasized that presumption and \"the constitutional\npremise that race is an impermissible arbiter of human fortunes,\" even\nwhen using race as a \"reparational device\" or as a \"remedial measure\"\nfor past discrimination. 38 F.3d 147, 152 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied,\nKirwan v. Podberesky, 514 U.S. 1128 (1995); Maryland Troopers\nAss'n, Inc. v. Evans, 993 F.2d 1072, 1076 (4th Cir. 1993). In accor-\ndance with that principle, we concluded that government institutions\nthat choose to employ racial classifications face\"the presumption that\n[such a] choice can not be sustained.\" Podberesky II, 38 F.3d at 152.\nMontgomery County was burdened with this presumption, and\nalthough the district court analyzed the transfer policy under strict\nscrutiny review, it failed to take the presumption into account when\nit denied Jacob's request for a preliminary injunction. There is noth-\ning in the record to overcome this presumption.\n\nB.\n\nIt is undisputed that the transfer policy considers race as the sole\ndetermining factor, absent a \"unique personal hardship,\" if the\nassigned school and the requested school are both stable and their uti-\nlization/enrollment factor are acceptable for transfers. While whites\nand non-whites are not singled out for different treatment, they are all\nsubject to being denied a transfer request solely on the basis of their\nrace. Any racial classification, including that present here, must sur-\nvive strict scrutiny review; failing such review manifests a violation\nof Jacob's constitutional rights.14 See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14 In its review of Jacob's asserted irreparable harm, the district court\nstated that, if proven, a violation of Jacob's constitutional rights consti-\n\n                     9\n\fPena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). Strict scrutiny review requires the\nracial classification to serve a compelling governmental interest and\nbe narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See Adarand, 515 U.S.\nat 227. The diversity profile factor of the transfer policy employs such\nracial classifications which \"are simply too pernicious to permit any\nbut the most exact connection between justification and classifica-\ntion.\" Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 280 (1986)\n(quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 537 (1980) (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting)).\n\nThe district court's determination that the Eisenbergs did not have\na strong likelihood of success on the merits stemmed from its strict\nscrutiny review. The district court labeled its review as exacting and\ndetermined that each of the two interests advanced by Montgomery\nCounty were sufficiently compelling; the first interest in avoiding the\ncreation of segregative enrollment by racial isolation, and the second\ninterest in promoting a diverse student population. See Eisenberg, 19\nF. Supp. 2d at 452-55. A further examination of these two interests,\nand application of this court's reasoning in our recent case regarding\nracial classifications within an elementary school setting, Tuttle v.\nArlington County Sch. Bd., No. 98-1604 (4th Cir. Sept. 24, 1999),\nreveals that Montgomery County's transfer policy cannot pass consti-\ntutional muster.\n\nMoreover, we believe the district court erred in its finding that the\nEisenbergs are not likely to succeed on the merits, given that the\nrecord demonstrates that Montgomery County's transfer policy is not\na remedial race-conscious policy. See Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at\n451-52. Montgomery County has never been under a court order to\ndesegregate, having acted voluntarily to dismantle segregation after\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S.\n483 (1954). See Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Public Sch., 19 F.\nSupp. 2d at 451; County Br. at 4. Montgomery County formed a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ntutes per se irreparable harm. See Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at 452 (cit-\ning Johnson v. Bergland, 586 F.2d 993, 995 (4th Cir. 1978); Henry v.\nGreenville Airport Comm'n, 284 F.2d 631, 632-33 (4th Cir. 1960)). The\ndistrict court found the irreparable harm to be slight and balanced the\nhardships in favor of Montgomery County.\n\n                    10\n\fQuality Integrated Education policy in 1975,15 and the present transfer\npolicy reflects the Quality Integrated Education policy goals of\n\"avoiding racial isolation and promoting diverse enrollments.\" See\nCounty Br. at 4. Notwithstanding that race based classifications have\nbeen tolerated in situations where past constitutional violations\nrequire race based remedial action, see Swann v. Charlotte Mecklen-\nburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1 (1971); Brewer v. School Bd. of City\nof Norfolk, 456 F.2d 943 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, School Bd. of City\nof Norfolk v. Brewer, 406 U.S. 933 (1972), we do not face that type\nof scenario in this case. No court has ever made a finding that Mont-\ngomery County Public Schools were not unitary, therefore, the trans-\nfer policy does not correct any past constitutional violations.\n\nIII.\n\nWe next examine whether a compelling governmental interest\nexists. Although Montgomery County advances two interests, each of\nwhich it argues constitutes a sufficiently compelling state interest\nunder strict scrutiny, we are of opinion that, despite the different\nnomenclature, these interests are one and the same. 16 See Brewer v.\nWest Irondequoit Cent. Sch. Dist., 32 F. Supp. 2d 619, 627\n(W.D.N.Y. 1999) (describing the avoidance of racial isolation as \"a\nnegatively-phrased expression for attaining the opposite of racial iso-\nlation which is racial diversity.\"). Tuttle notes that whether diversity\nis a compelling governmental interest remains unresolved, and in this\ncase, we also choose to leave it unresolved. See Tuttle, No. 98-1604,\nslip op. at 11-12 (4th Cir. Sept. 24, 1999); but see Hopwood v. Texas,\n78 F.3d 932, 944 (5th Cir. 1996), reh'g en banc denied, 84 F.3d 720\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15 Montgomery County asserts that the Quality Integrated Education\npolicy was part of the voluntary effort to support integrated schools. This\npolicy was adopted more than 20 years after Brown, and we note that\ntoday, over 45 years have passed since Brown.\n\nWe especially note that at about the time of inception of the transfer\npolicy, 1981, a complaint of the U. S. Department of Education was that\nthe \"racial balance\" was being upset in certain schools by the county\ntransfer policy. This was prior to Freeman, infra, of course.\n\n16 The district court considered each interest separately and concluded\nthat each was sufficiently compelling to justify the questioned policy.\nSee Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at 453-54.\n\n                    11\n\f(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1033 (1996) (holding that \"consider-\nation of race or ethnicity by the [University of Texas] law school for\nthe purposes of achieving a diverse student body is not a compelling\ninterest under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"). We will assume, without\nholding, as the Tuttle court assumed,17 that diversity may be a compel-\nling governmental interest, and proceed to examine whether the trans-\nfer policy is narrowly tailored to achieve diversity. See Tuttle, No. 98-\n1604, slip op. at 11-12 (4th Cir. Sept. 24, 1999). No inference may\nhere be taken that we are of opinion that racial diversity is a compel-\nling governmental interest.\n\nThe present case and Tuttle are nearly indistinguishable in that both\ninvolve public school policies, here the Montgomery County transfer\npolicy and in Tuttle, the Arlington County admissions policy for the\nArlington Traditional School, in place \"not to remedy past discrimina-\ntion, but rather to promote racial [and] ethnic\" diversity. Tuttle, No.\n98-1604, slip op. at 3 (4th Cir. Sept. 24, 1999). Even in the remedial\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17 The First Circuit assumed that diversity may suffice as compelling\nwithout so holding, see Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir.\n1998) (declining to decide, in the context of a race based admissions pro-\ngram to one of Boston's better public secondary schools, that diversity\ncan never be a compelling state interest but, instead, determining that it\nwas not narrowly tailored to achieve the desired end). Other circuits have\nfaced related issues in different circumstances, see Taxman v. Board of\nEduc. of the Township of Piscataway, 91 F.3d 1547 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(refusing to find support in the Court's Equal Protection cases for the\nnotion that diversity or affirmative action were sufficient justifications\nfor making race a factor in the termination decision of one of two equally\nqualified teachers in a nonremedial situation under Title VII); Lutheran\nChurch-Missouri Synod v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 141 F.3d\n344 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (holding that \"diversity of programming\" was an\ninsufficient justification to uphold aspects of the FCC's licensing pro-\ngram (which, in essence, pressured stations to maintain a workforce that\nmirrored the racial composition of their area) under strict scrutiny's com-\npelling state interest test); McNamara v. City of Chicago; 138 F.3d 1219,\n1222 (7th Cir. 1998) (referring to the issue as unsettled.). We should not\nleave the various opinions of the courts of appeal without noting that\nLutheran Church also reasoned that \". . . it is impossible to conclude that\nthe government's interest, no matter how articulated, is a compelling\none.\" 141 F.3d at 355.\n\n                    12\n\fcontext, where the state-sponsored program or policy exists to remedy\nthe proximately caused present effects of past discrimination, we have\nnot decided the question of whether diversity is a compelling govern-\nmental interest. See Tuttle, No. 98-1604, slip op. at 11 n. 7 (4th Cir.\nSept. 24, 1999) (citing Alexander v. Esteep, 95 F.3d 312, 316 (4th Cir.\n1996); Hayes v. North State Law Enforcement Officers Ass'n, 10 F.3d\n207, 213 (4th Cir. 1993) (holding that there was insufficient evidence\nto prove that race based promotion to achieve racial diversity was a\ncompelling interest); Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52, 56 n.4 (4th\nCir. 1992) (Podberesky I)). Similarly, the Supreme Court has not\ndecided this issue. See Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438\nU.S. 265, 269 (1978). We thus do not decide that racial/ethnic diver-\nsity is a compelling state interest and proceed to the second part of\nthe strict scrutiny analysis.\n\nIV.\n\nThis court's mention of Bakke in Talbert v. City of Richmond18\ndoes not lead us to conclude that Montgomery County's use of racial\nclassifications in its transfer decisions is narrowly tailored to the inter-\nest of obtaining diversity. In fact, we find that it is mere racial balanc-\ning in a pure form, even at its inception. The County annually\nascertains the percentage of enrolled public school students by race\non a countywide basis, and then does the same for each school. It then\nassigns a numbered category for each race at each school, and admin-\nisters the transfer policy so that the race and percentage in each school\nto which students are assigned by residence is compared to the per-\ncentage of that race in the countywide system. The transfer policy is\nadministered with an end toward maintaining this percentage of racial\nbalance in each school. This is, by definition, racial balancing. As we\nhave only recently held in Tuttle \"[s]uch nonremedial racial balancing\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18 Talbert v. City of Richmond, 648 F.2d 925, 931 (4th Cir. 1981),\ninvolved police officer promotion and stated that \"the attainment of\nracial diversity in the top ranks of the police department was a legitimate\ninterest of the city.\" In Hayes v. North State Law Enforcement Officers\nAss'n, 10 F.3d 207 (4th Cir. 1993), however, we held that legitimate is\nnot necessarily compelling. 10 F.3d at 213 (\"We did not determine that\nthe interest was sufficiently `compelling' to justify racial classifications\nunder the strict scrutiny standard.\").\n\n                     13\n\fis unconstitutional.\" Tuttle, No. 98-1604, slip op. at 13 & n.10 (4th\nCir. Sept. 24, 1999). Montgomery County's transfer policy, at its\ninception, was to \"further provide[ ] for transfers ... providing that the\ntransfer does not adversely affect the racial balance in either the\nsending or the receiving school.\" Letter from U. S. Department of\nEducation to Superintendent Andrews, Feb. 28, 1981 (italics added).\nAlthough the transfer policy does not necessarily apply \"hard and fast\nquotas,\"19 its goal of keeping certain percentages of racial/ethnic\ngroups within each school to ensure diversity is racial balancing.20\n\nThe Court dealt with the issue of nonremedial racial pupil assign-\nment in both Pasadena Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424\n(1976), and Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467 (1992). In Spangler, the\nSupreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit's finding that it would be\nbeyond the remedial authority of the district court to require the\nannual readjustment of school attendance zones to counteract changes\nin the racial makeup of the schools.21 See Spangler, 427 U.S. at 436.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19 The district court pointed to the fact that some transfers are allowed\nbased on \"personal hardship and family unity\" as evidence that the trans-\nfer policy was not rigidly applied. See Eisenberg, 19 F. Supp. 2d at 455.\nThis does not detract from the wrong done by denial of a transfer, as\nhere, on the basis of race.\n\n20 Although the district court decided that, in its opinion, diversity was\na compelling governmental interest, its finding that \"the [county] does\nnot apply hard and fast quotas\" is a tacit acknowledgment that if such\nwere the case, its decision would have been different. Eisenberg, 19 F.\nSupp. 2d at 454. The fact that, for any reason personal to him, only a dis-\ntinct personal hardship can save any student, regardless of his race, from\nhaving his transfer request decided on the basis of race, makes it tempt-\ning to decide the general question of whether or not diversity is a com-\npelling governmental interest. However persuasive the arguments, and\nhowever tantalizing the facts in this case are, we resist that temptation\nand do not decide the question because it is not absolutely necessary to\nour decision. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 341, 346-47 (1936)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n21 Clearly, Montgomery County has not been found to initially assign\nstudents to schools based on race, rather students are assigned by resi-\ndence. Nonetheless, Montgomery County is attempting to keep schools\nracially balanced by controlling and monitoring transfers. Jacob's request\nto transfer to Rosemary Hills is one of them.\n\n                     14\n\fIn the Ninth Circuit's subsequent opinion in Spangler v. Pasadena\nBd. of Educ., the court recognized the Supreme Court's emphasis on\nthe idea \"that when a large percentage of minority students in a neigh-\nborhood school results from housing patterns for which school\nauthorities are not responsible, the school board may not be charged\nwith unconstitutional discrimination if a racially neutral assignment\nmethod is adopted.\" 611 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir. 1979). Thus, in the\nsituation before us, if racial isolation, meaning low or high percent-\nages of either racial minorities or non-minorities may be feared\nbecause transfer requests are granted to students when the assigned\nand requested schools are both stable and at appropriate utilization\nlevels, any found racial imbalance would not be a vestige of a prior\nde jure system. If racial imbalance occurs in some of the Montgomery\nCounty schools because students like Jacob, for example, are permit-\nted to transfer to magnet schools to get a better education, any racial\nor ethnic imbalance is a product of \"private choices [and] it does not\nhave constitutional implications.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 495\n(1992).\n\nIn Freeman, racial disparities surfaced because of great growth in\nthe DeKalb area after 1986; from 70,000 to 450,000 and the attraction\nof African-Americans to the area contributed to a racial imbalance\nwithin the school district after the district had been declared unitary\nin the student assignment area. 503 U.S. at 480. In this case, Mont-\ngomery County has implemented magnet schools to attract students\nof all racial/ethnic backgrounds to be a part of a different learning\nenvironment. Predictably, students of all backgrounds are attracted to\nthe magnet school and, as a result, racial imbalance may then occur\nin some other schools, if it occurs at all. A potential racial imbalance\ndoes not, however, justify the transfer policy's use of race as a factor\nto determine eligibility for transfers.22\n\nThe fact that the \"County engages in periodic review ... [and the]\ndiversity profile for each school is reviewed and adjusted\" each year\nto avoid the facilitation and the creation of a racially isolated environ-\nment does not make the policy narrowly tailored. See Eisenberg, 19\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n22 Montgomery County is not required to grant transfers, but nonethe-\nless, it may not refuse to grant such requests to achieve a racial makeup\nin each school mirroring the county's racial makeup.\n\n                    15\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 455. Instead, it manifests Montgomery County's\nattempt to regulate transfer spots to achieve the racial balance or\nmakeup that most closely reflects the percentage of the various races\nin the county's public school population. Periodic review does not\nmake the transfer policy more narrow. Similarly, because a student\nmay be granted a transfer request because he can demonstrate a\nunique personal hardship23 does not limit or narrow the transfer policy\nso that racial balancing is suddenly a narrow fit to achieve diversity.\nIt is true that the racial/ethnic background is not the only factor in\ntransfer request considerations, however, in Jacob's situation, his race\nwas the only factor that led to the denial of his request. Montgomery\nCounty admits that it denies transfer requests solely on the basis of\nrace, absent personal hardship, \"where the consideration of the\nracial/ethnic diversity factor is reached\" and the transfer would con-\ntribute to racial isolation. County Br. at 8.\n\nIn Tuttle, one of the reasons for holding that the admissions policy\nin question in that case was invalid was that it \"skew[ed] the odds of\nselection in favor of certain minorities.\" No. 98-1604, slip op. at 15\n(4th Cir. Sept. 24, 1999). The Montgomery County transfer policy\ndoes not allow every applicant for a transfer to be eligible for every\navailable spot. Here Rosemary Hills was stable and was not overutil-\nized and Glen Haven was stable and overutilized, yet spots at Rose-\nmary Hills were foreclosed to Jacob simply because Glen Haven's\npercentage of white school population would decrease, which would\ncause a greater departure from the countywide percentage for the\nwhite student population. If Jacob had been African-American or\nAsian or Hispanic, he would have been granted his transfer request\nfrom Glen Haven to Rosemary Hills because his transfer would not\nhave caused a racial imbalance at Glen Haven. It does not matter that,\nas the County argues, \"at some schools, African-Americans are gener-\nally not allowed to transfer out\" and that the\"policy does not single\nout whites, African-Americans, or other minorities,\" a denial of trans-\nfer to African-Americans or other minorities on account of their race\nis no less unconstitutional than the denial to Jacob was here. An\nexample makes clear the evil of the system in place. Suppose an\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23 The personal hardship exemption, among other things, refers to\nallowing a transfer to keep siblings in the same school and ease the bur-\nden on families.\n\n                    16\n\fAfrican-American and an Hispanic student at Travilah Elementary\nSchool (J.A. 20) wanted to transfer to Rosemary Hills (J.A. 20) to\nparticipate in the magnet program of math and science and get a better\neducation. Their diversity profile numbers being category 3, the same\nas Jacob's, their transfers would likewise have been refused because\nof their race. The fact that these two theoretical students would have\nbeen unconstitutionally denied a transfer does not ameliorate the fact\nthat Jacob's denial was invalid. As Justice Scalia put it in his concur-\nring opinion in Adarand:\n\n          Individuals who have been wronged by such unlawful racial\n          discrimination should be made whole; but, under our Con-\n          stitution, there can be no such thing as either a creditor or\n          debtor race. That concept is alien to the Constitution's focus\n          upon the individual. . . .\n\n515 U.S. at 239.\n\nV.\n\nTo summarize, Montgomery County's transfer policy here in ques-\ntion is engaging in racial balancing, which we have just held to be\nunconstitutional in Tuttle. In Tuttle, No. 98-1604, slip op. at 13 (4th\nCir. Sept. 24, 1999), and Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 160 (4th\nCir. 1994), we also held that racial balancing was not a narrowly tai-\nlored remedy. Therefore, even if we went no further, the complained\nof action on the part of Montgomery County would have to be invali-\ndated because it was giving effect to an unconstitutional policy.\n\nBut that is not all. Added to the racial balancing is the fact that\nJacob's transfer request was refused because of his race. As we have\npointed out, such race based governmental actions are presumed to be\ninvalid and are subject to strict scrutiny. Nothing in this record over-\ncomes that presumption.\n\nOn remand the district court will forthwith enter its preliminary\ninjunction requiring the school authorities in Montgomery County to\nadmit Jacob to the Rosemary Hills Elementary School magnet pro-\ngram to which he had applied. Following that, the district court will\n\n                    17\n\fenter its final injunction requiring the school authorities in Montgom-\nery County to reconsider the application of Jacob to transfer to the\nRosemary Hills Elementary School magnet program without consid-\neration of his race. Such consideration will re-examine that request\nfor admission \"as of the date it was made.\" Podberesky II, 38 F.3d at\n162.\n\nWe are justified in requiring the entry of an injunction finally dis-\nposing of this case without an evidentiary hearing because the record\nclearly establishes the plaintiff's right to an injunction and such a\nhearing would not have altered the result. See Lone Star Steakhouse\n& Saloon v. Alpha of Virginia, 43 F.3d 922, 938 (4th Cir. 1995). This\nis so because no fact on which we have based our opinion is chal-\nlenged and in this case we have the compound constitutional wrongs\nof an invalid racially based transfer policy sustaining invalid racial\nbalancing.\n\nOur decision is very narrow. We feel that we should point out what\nis not decided. See Loving v. Alexander, 745 F.2d 861, 867 (4th Cir.\n1984). We have not enjoined any aspect of the transfer policy of\nMontgomery County except that it may not consider the race of the\napplicant in granting or denying the transfer. We have not decided\nthat diversity, as the term is used here, either is or is not a compelling\ngovernmental interest. The absence of any rigid academic qualifica-\ntions for transfer and selection by lot if a surplus of applications, for\nexample, seem to open the opportunity to transfer to magnet schools\nto all students in the system, without respect to their race or any other\nqualification except their implicit desire to obtain a better education.\nDesire is not race based. Nothing in this record would indicate that\nthe other aspects of the transfer policy--stability, utilization, enroll-\nment and personal hardship--are race based, and we do not disturb\nthem.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n\n                     18\n\f",

We hold that it may not.\n\nJacob Eisenberg appeals the district court's denial of his motion for\na preliminary injunction to compel his admittance to the math and sci-\nence magnet program at Rosemary Hills Elementary School. Jacob\noriginally applied for a transfer to Rosemary Hills Elementary School\nfor the 1998-99 school year, his first grade year, and was denied his\nrequest by Montgomery County on May 15, 1998 due to the \"impact\non diversity.\" Jacob is currently preparing to enter the second grade\nat Glen Haven Elementary, his assigned school, based on his resi-\ndence. On his transfer request application, Jacob identified his\nracial/ethnic group as \"White, not of Hispanic origin,\" and accord-\ningly, under Montgomery County's transfer policy, particularly its\n\n                    2\n\f\"diversity profile,\"1 he was not allowed to transfer out of Glen Haven\nElementary School. We reverse the district court's order denying\nJacob's motion for a preliminary injunction and remand this case for\naction consistent with this opinion.\n\nI.\n\nMontgomery County educates more than 125,000 elementary and\nsecondary students enrolled at over 183 schools spread throughout\n500 square miles. The County has never been subject to a court order\nfor desegregation,2 rather, Montgomery County by its voluntary\nefforts dismantled the former segregated school system. One aspect\nof its efforts included the implementation of magnet school programs,3\nwhich would attract and retain diverse student enrollment on a volun-\ntary basis to schools outside the area in which the student lives. A\nmagnet program emphasizing math and science is located at Rose-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 The Superintendent, Dr. Paul L. Vance, stated in his August 6, 1998\nletter regarding Jacob's Transfer Appeal that \"[t]he diversity profile\ngroup ... means that white students cannot transfer out of Glen Haven\nElementary School unless there is a unique hardship circumstance.\"\n\n2 Likewise, there has never been a judicial finding of a constitutional\nviolation within Montgomery County's educational setting. In 1981,\nhowever, the Office of Civil Rights investigated a parent's complaint\nfiled against Montgomery County alleging that it was\"resegregating\nRosemary Hills Primary School by improperly approving student trans-\nfers ... without the approval of the Quality Integrated Education team,\"\nthereby failing to prevent minority isolation at Rosemary Hills. Mont-\ngomery County's transfer policy at issue here was adopted in response\nto this complaint. The fact that Rosemary Hills was the subject of the\n1981 action is entirely coincidental to, and has no relevance to, the fact\nthat the Rosemary Hills magnet school program is the subject of this\ncase.\n\n3 Magnet programs offer enriched curricula emphasizing specific areas;\ne.g., science, math, or a foreign language. In fact, admission to Rosemary\nHills magnet school is not based on merit. Montgomery County points\nout that if Rosemary Hills receives more transfer requests than it has\nseats, the names of the eligible students are placed in a lottery and\nselected randomly. See County Br. at 9, n.4. This being true, Jacob would\nnot have been eligible for the lottery because he was not allowed to\ntransfer out of Glen Haven based on his race.\n\n                    3\n\fmary Hills Elementary School. Montgomery County permits volun-\ntary transfers from an assigned school to another school under certain\ncircumstances as outlined in its School Transfer Information Booklet.4\n\nMontgomery County considers, in stages, several factors in the\nconsideration of a voluntary transfer request: first, school stability;5\nsecond, utilization/enrollment; third, diversity profile; and last, the\nreason for the request. All of the transfer applications are considered\nconcurrently, and if the assigned school and the requested school are\nruled stable, the transfer request is reviewed for utiliza-\ntion/enrollment. An underutilized school is operating below 80%\ncapacity and an overutilized school is operating above 100% capacity.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 Throughout its Transfer Booklet and its briefs, Montgomery County\nuses the terms \"county-wide average,\" \"average county-wide range,\" and\nin one footnote in its Reply Brief, \"one-and-one-half standard devia-\ntions,\" to describe the method used to compare the racial/ethnic student\npopulation in each particular school to that of other schools and to the\noverall racial/ethnic student population enrolled in Montgomery County\nPublic Schools. These terms are interchangeably and indistinguishably\nused by Montgomery County with no apparent recognition of the ordi-\nnary true meanings of each term. For instance, an average is \"exactly or\napproximately the quotient obtained by dividing the sum total of a set of\nfigures by the number of figures.\" Webster's Ninth New Collegiate\nDictionary 119 (9th ed. 1985). A range is defined as \"the difference\nbetween the least and the greatest values of an attribute.\" Webster's\nNinth New Collegiate Dictionary 974 (9th ed. 1985); see also David W.\nBarnes, Statistics as Proof 77 (1983) (explaining a range as \"the distance\nbetween the largest and smallest numbers.\"). A standard deviation \"rep-\nresents the typical [variation] from the mean or expected value for a pop-\nulation (or list of numbers).\" David W. Barnes, Statistics as Proof 81\n(1983). For our purposes in this opinion, we have assumed that each of\nthese terms refers to the actual percentage of students in a racial/ethnic\ngroup within the student population enrolled in each of the Montgomery\nCounty Public Schools, and, as well, the percentage of students in each\nof the various racial/ethnic groups in the student population of the Mont-\ngomery County Public Schools, taken as a whole.\n\n5 Stability refers to whether the assigned school and the requested\nschool are undergoing a boundary change, consolidation, or renovation\nthat requires students to attend school at an alternative site or whether\neither school is undergoing some other change that requires the enroll-\nment to remain stabilized.\n\n                    4\n\fThe utilization factor for each school is determined prior to the receipt\nof transfer requests and is indicated, for each school in the system, in\nthe Transfer Booklet. Overutilization or underutilization may affect a\ntransfer request, in fact, Montgomery County states that these transfer\nrequest(s) usually will be denied.6 Along with utilization, enrollment\nis considered to ensure that schools remain within the preferred range\nof enrollment.7 If these factors are not a concern, Montgomery County\nlooks to the diversity of the student body of the assigned and the\nrequested schools.\n\nA. Diversity Profile\n\nAccording to the Transfer Booklet, \"[t]ransfers that negatively\naffect diversity are usually denied.\" Students are identified according\nto their racial/ethnic group: African American, Asian, Hispanic, and\nWhite. Montgomery County compares the countywide percentage for\neach racial/ethnic group to the percentage of each group attending a\nparticular school, and also determines whether the percentage of each\nracial/ethnic group in that school has either increased or decreased\nover the past three years. Based on that information, Montgomery\nCounty then assigns to each racial/ethnic group within each school a\ndiversity category.8\n\nCategories 1 and 2 are reserved for the racial/ethnic group popula-\ntions within a school, the percentages of which are higher than the\ncountywide percentage for that particular group. Category 1 refers to\nracial groups, the percentage of which is higher than the countywide\npercentage for that group and has increased over time rather than\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 Each school has an \"O\" or a \"U\" or a blank space (if the utilization\nis optimal).\n\n7 The preferred range of enrollment refers to the number of classes of\nstudents per grade for elementary schools. For example, 2 to 4 classes of\nstudents per grade is preferred in elementary schools. If a school with\nsufficient capacity fails to meet [has fewer classes than] the preferred\nrange, transfers out of that school are usually not permitted.\n\n8 If the percentage of the identified racial/ethnic group within a school\nis within the countywide percentage for that group and is expected to\nremain the same for the near future, that racial/ethnic group will not be\nassigned a diversity category.\n\n                       5\n\fmoved closer to the countywide percentage. Transfers usually will not\nbe permitted by a student into a school with a designated category 1\nfor his racial/ethnic group because his racial/ethnic group percentage\nat that requested transfer school is already higher than the countywide\npercentage. Category 2 refers to racial/ethnic populations which,\nalthough higher than the countywide percentage, have tended to\ndecline over time. Some transfers are permitted into this group. Cate-\ngories 3 and 4 indicate a racial/ethnic percentage within a school that\nis below the countywide percentage. Category 3 is reserved for those\nracial/ethnic groups, the percentage of which has tended to decline\nover time; while category 4 includes those populations the percentage\nof which has tended to increase. For example, \"if a particular school\nhas had a declining white enrollment over the preceding three year\nperiod and is substantially below the average [c]ounty-wide enroll-\nment of white students [a Category 3], the District may restrict trans-\nfers of white students out of that school because they would\ncontribute to that school becoming racially isolated.\"9 County Br. at\n7. As is the County's, the diversity profile for each school is\nreevaluated and adjusted annually.\n\nB. Jacob's Transfer Application\n\nIn March of 1998, Jacob's parents submitted a request that he be\ntransferred from Glen Haven to Rosemary Hills to begin the first\ngrade, reasoning that Jacob's \"personal and academic potential\"\nwould benefit from the school's math and science emphasis. His\ntransfer request was approved by his kindergarten teaching team.\nJacob, as a white student, was part of a category 3 group at Glen\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9 Jacob faced this very situation. Glen Haven, his assigned school, and\nRosemary Hills, his requested school, had the following notations for uti-\nlization and for diversity profile:\n\nSchool     UtilizationAfrican- Asian Hispanic White\n                      American\n___________________________________________________________\nGlen Haven Overutiliz. 1              1       3\n___________________________________________________________\nRosemary                       3\nHills\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n                    6\n\fHaven Elementary School because at the time of Jacob's transfer\nrequest, Glen Haven's student body was 24.1% white compared to the\nMontgomery County-wide percentage of 53.4%, and the white enroll-\nment at Glen Haven dropped from 38.9% in 1994-95 to 24.1% in\n1997-98. See Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Public Sch., 19 F.\nSupp. 2d 449, 451 (D. Md. 1998). On May 15, 1998, his transfer was\ndenied. The sole reason given by Montgomery County for the denial\nwas \"impact on diversity,\" that is to say because Jacob was white.\nJacob did not demonstrate a \"unique personal hardship\"10 to obtain an\nexemption from the denial based on the negative impact on diversity.\nThe Eisenbergs submitted their appeal first to the Superintendent, and\nthen to the Board of Education, which denied the transfer request on\nAugust 26, 1998.\n\nJacob's parents sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as\ndamages on behalf of Jacob in the district court under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, the Equal Protection Clause, and under 42 U.S.C. § 2000(d).\nThe district court denied the Eisenbergs' motion for a preliminary\ninjunction on September 9, 1998 on the basis that the Eisenbergs\nmade an insufficient showing of likelihood of success on the merits.11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 Five white students, out of 19 who applied, were permitted to trans-\nfer out of Glen Haven for the 1998-99 school year on a personal hardship\nbasis. Four of these transfers were permitted because the transferring stu-\ndent had a sibling already attending the requested school.\n\n11 The district court applied the Fourth Circuit's standards for injunc-\ntive relief, see Blackwelder Furniture Co. of Statesville, Inc. v. Seilig.\nMfg.

See Eisenberg, 19 F.\nSupp. 2d at 452 (citing Manning v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744071\"><a href=\"/opinion/744071/richard-o-manning-md-raleigh-womens-health-organization-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (4th Cir.\n1997)). Next, the court considered the likelihood that the plaintiff would\nsucceed on the merits noting that as the likelihood of harm to the defen-\ndant increased, the burden on the plaintiff to demonstrate likelihood of\nsuccess also increased. See Eisenberg, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 452.

Thus, the court\nlooked to the Eisenbergs to make a strong showing regarding their likeli-\nhood of success on the merits. Finding none, the district court denied\ntheir motion for preliminary injunction.\n\n                    7\n\fThe district court concluded that Montgomery County's asserted\ninterests in both the diversity of its student body and avoidance of\npotential segregative enrollment patterns were each sufficiently com-\npelling governmental interests to justify the transfer policy's race\nbased classifications under a \"strict scrutiny\" review applied in Equal\nProtection cases.12 See Eisenberg, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 453-54.

The facts also appear all too familiar-- a child has been\ndenied access to a state funded educational opportunity because of the\ncolor of his skin.13 In this case there is no denial that racial classifica-\ntions result in the denial of a certain number of transfers because\nMontgomery County fears racial imbalance within its schools, and to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12 The district court said that it applied the strict scrutiny review fash-\nioned in Richmond v.

See\nPersonnel Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110098\"><a href=\"/opinion/110098/personnel-administrator-of-mass-v-feeney/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (1979)\n(\"racial classification, regardless of purported motivation, is presump-\ntively invalid and can be upheld only on extraordinary justification.\").\nIn Podberesky v.

In accor-\ndance with that principle, we concluded that government institutions\nthat choose to employ racial classifications face\"the presumption that\n[such a] choice can not be sustained.\" Podberesky II, 38 F.3d at 152.\nMontgomery County was burdened with this presumption, and\nalthough the district court analyzed the transfer policy under strict\nscrutiny review, it failed to take the presumption into account when\nit denied Jacob's request for a preliminary injunction. There is noth-\ning in the record to overcome this presumption.\n\nB.\n\nIt is undisputed that the transfer policy considers race as the sole\ndetermining factor, absent a \"unique personal hardship,\" if the\nassigned school and the requested school are both stable and their uti-\nlization/enrollment factor are acceptable for transfers. While whites\nand non-whites are not singled out for different treatment, they are all\nsubject to being denied a transfer request solely on the basis of their\nrace. Any racial classification, including that present here, must sur-\nvive strict scrutiny review; failing such review manifests a violation\nof Jacob's constitutional rights.14 See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14 In its review of Jacob's asserted irreparable harm, the district court\nstated that, if proven, a violation of Jacob's constitutional rights consti-\n\n                     9\n\fPena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227 (1995). Strict scrutiny review requires the\nracial classification to serve a compelling governmental interest and\nbe narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See Adarand, 515 U.S.\nat 227.

The district court labeled its review as exacting and\ndetermined that each of the two interests advanced by Montgomery\nCounty were sufficiently compelling; the first interest in avoiding the\ncreation of segregative enrollment by racial isolation, and the second\ninterest in promoting a diverse student population.

Bd., No. 98-1604 (4th Cir. Sept. 24, 1999),\nreveals that Montgomery County's transfer policy cannot pass consti-\ntutional muster.\n\nMoreover, we believe the district court erred in its finding that the\nEisenbergs are not likely to succeed on the merits, given that the\nrecord demonstrates that Montgomery County's transfer policy is not\na remedial race-conscious policy.

City of Richmond18\ndoes not lead us to conclude that Montgomery County's use of racial\nclassifications in its transfer decisions is narrowly tailored to the inter-\nest of obtaining diversity. In fact, we find that it is mere racial balanc-\ning in a pure form, even at its inception. The County annually\nascertains the percentage of enrolled public school students by race\non a countywide basis, and then does the same for each school. It then\nassigns a numbered category for each race at each school, and admin-\nisters the transfer policy so that the race and percentage in each school\nto which students are assigned by residence is compared to the per-\ncentage of that race in the countywide system. The transfer policy is\nadministered with an end toward maintaining this percentage of racial\nbalance in each school. This is, by definition, racial balancing.

In Spangler, the\nSupreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit's finding that it would be\nbeyond the remedial authority of the district court to require the\nannual readjustment of school attendance zones to counteract changes\nin the racial makeup of the schools.21 See Spangler, 427 U.S. at 436.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19 The district court pointed to the fact that some transfers are allowed\nbased on \"personal hardship and family unity\" as evidence that the trans-\nfer policy was not rigidly applied. See Eisenberg, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 455.\nThis does not detract from the wrong done by denial of a transfer, as\nhere, on the basis of race.\n\n20 Although the district court decided that, in its opinion, diversity was\na compelling governmental interest, its finding that \"the [county] does\nnot apply hard and fast quotas\" is a tacit acknowledgment that if such\nwere the case, its decision would have been different. Eisenberg, 19 F.\nSupp. 2d at 454. The fact that, for any reason personal to him, only a dis-\ntinct personal hardship can save any student, regardless of his race, from\nhaving his transfer request decided on the basis of race, makes it tempt-\ning to decide the general question of whether or not diversity is a com-\npelling governmental interest. However persuasive the arguments, and\nhowever tantalizing the facts in this case are, we resist that temptation\nand do not decide the question because it is not absolutely necessary to\nour decision. See Ashwander v. TVA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102605\"><a href=\"/opinion/102605/ashwander-v-tva/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341, 346-47 (1936)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n21 Clearly, Montgomery County has not been found to initially assign\nstudents to schools based on race, rather students are assigned by resi-\ndence. Nonetheless, Montgomery County is attempting to keep schools\nracially balanced by controlling and monitoring transfers. Jacob's request\nto transfer to Rosemary Hills is one of them.\n\n                     14\n\fIn the Ninth Circuit's subsequent opinion in Spangler v. Pasadena\nBd. of Educ., the court recognized the Supreme Court's emphasis on\nthe idea \"that when a large percentage of minority students in a neigh-\nborhood school results from housing patterns for which school\nauthorities are not responsible, the school board may not be charged\nwith unconstitutional discrimination if a racially neutral assignment\nmethod is adopted.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"372967\"><a href=\"/opinion/372967/nancy-anne-spangler-by-her-father-and-next-friend-james-e-spangler-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1244 (9th Cir. 1979). Thus, in the\nsituation before us, if racial isolation, meaning low or high percent-\nages of either racial minorities or non-minorities may be feared\nbecause transfer requests are granted to students when the assigned\nand requested schools are both stable and at appropriate utilization\nlevels, any found racial imbalance would not be a vestige of a prior\nde jure system. If racial imbalance occurs in some of the Montgomery\nCounty schools because students like Jacob, for example, are permit-\nted to transfer to magnet schools to get a better education, any racial\nor ethnic imbalance is a product of \"private choices [and] it does not\nhave constitutional implications.\" Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495\n(1992).\n\nIn Freeman, racial disparities surfaced because of great growth in\nthe DeKalb area after 1986; from 70,000 to 450,000 and the attraction\nof African-Americans to the area contributed to a racial imbalance\nwithin the school district after the district had been declared unitary\nin the student assignment area. 503 U.S. at 480. In this case, Mont-\ngomery County has implemented magnet schools to attract students\nof all racial/ethnic backgrounds to be a part of a different learning\nenvironment. Predictably, students of all backgrounds are attracted to\nthe magnet school and, as a result, racial imbalance may then occur\nin some other schools, if it occurs at all. A potential racial imbalance\ndoes not, however, justify the transfer policy's use of race as a factor\nto determine eligibility for transfers.22\n\nThe fact that the \"County engages in periodic review ... [and the]\ndiversity profile for each school is reviewed and adjusted\" each year\nto avoid the facilitation and the creation of a racially isolated environ-\nment does not make the policy narrowly tailored. See Eisenberg, 19\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n22 Montgomery County is not required to grant transfers, but nonethe-\nless, it may not refuse to grant such requests to achieve a racial makeup\nin each school mirroring the county's racial makeup.\n\n                    15\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 455. Instead, it manifests Montgomery County's\nattempt to regulate transfer spots to achieve the racial balance or\nmakeup that most closely reflects the percentage of the various races\nin the county's public school population. Periodic review does not\nmake the transfer policy more narrow. Similarly, because a student\nmay be granted a transfer request because he can demonstrate a\nunique personal hardship23 does not limit or narrow the transfer policy\nso that racial balancing is suddenly a narrow fit to achieve diversity.\nIt is true that the racial/ethnic background is not the only factor in\ntransfer request considerations, however, in Jacob's situation, his race\nwas the only factor that led to the denial of his request. Montgomery\nCounty admits that it denies transfer requests solely on the basis of\nrace, absent personal hardship, \"where the consideration of the\nracial/ethnic diversity factor is reached\" and the transfer would con-\ntribute to racial isolation. County Br. at 8.\n\nIn Tuttle, one of the reasons for holding that the admissions policy\nin question in that case was invalid was that it \"skew[ed] the odds of\nselection in favor of certain minorities.\" No. 98-1604, slip op. at 15\n(4th Cir. Sept. 24, 1999). The Montgomery County transfer policy\ndoes not allow every applicant for a transfer to be eligible for every\navailable spot. Here Rosemary Hills was stable and was not overutil-\nized and Glen Haven was stable and overutilized, yet spots at Rose-\nmary Hills were foreclosed to Jacob simply because Glen Haven's\npercentage of white school population would decrease, which would\ncause a greater departure from the countywide percentage for the\nwhite student population. If Jacob had been African-American or\nAsian or Hispanic, he would have been granted his transfer request\nfrom Glen Haven to Rosemary Hills because his transfer would not\nhave caused a racial imbalance at Glen Haven. It does not matter that,\nas the County argues, \"at some schools, African-Americans are gener-\nally not allowed to transfer out\" and that the\"policy does not single\nout whites, African-Americans, or other minorities,\" a denial of trans-\nfer to African-Americans or other minorities on account of their race\nis no less unconstitutional than the denial to Jacob was here. An\nexample makes clear the evil of the system in place. Suppose an\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23 The personal hardship exemption, among other things, refers to\nallowing a transfer to keep siblings in the same school and ease the bur-\nden on families.\n\n                    16\n\fAfrican-American and an Hispanic student at Travilah Elementary\nSchool (J.A. 20) wanted to transfer to Rosemary Hills (J.A. 20) to\nparticipate in the magnet program of math and science and get a better\neducation. Their diversity profile numbers being category 3, the same\nas Jacob's, their transfers would likewise have been refused because\nof their race. The fact that these two theoretical students would have\nbeen unconstitutionally denied a transfer does not ameliorate the fact\nthat Jacob's denial was invalid. As Justice Scalia put it in his concur-\nring opinion in Adarand:\n\n          Individuals who have been wronged by such unlawful racial\n          discrimination should be made whole; but, under our Con-\n          stitution, there can be no such thing as either a creditor or\n          debtor race. That concept is alien to the Constitution's focus\n          upon the individual. . . .\n\n515 U.S. at 239.\n\nV.\n\nTo summarize, Montgomery County's transfer policy here in ques-\ntion is engaging in racial balancing, which we have just held to be\nunconstitutional in Tuttle. In Tuttle, No. 98-1604, slip op. at 13 (4th\nCir. Sept. 24, 1999), and Podberesky v. Kirwan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680721\"><a href=\"/opinion/680721/daniel-j-podberesky-v-william-e-kirwan-president-of-the-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160 (4th\nCir. 1994), we also held that racial balancing was not a narrowly tai-\nlored remedy. Therefore, even if we went no further, the complained\nof action on the part of Montgomery County would have to be invali-\ndated because it was giving effect to an unconstitutional policy.\n\nBut that is not all. Added to the racial balancing is the fact that\nJacob's transfer request was refused because of his race. As we have\npointed out, such race based governmental actions are presumed to be\ninvalid and are subject to strict scrutiny. Nothing in this record over-\ncomes that presumption.\n\nOn remand the district court will forthwith enter its preliminary\ninjunction requiring the school authorities in Montgomery County to\nadmit Jacob to the Rosemary Hills Elementary School magnet pro-\ngram to which he had applied. Following that, the district court will\n\n                    17\n\fenter its final injunction requiring the school authorities in Montgom-\nery County to reconsider the application of Jacob to transfer to the\nRosemary Hills Elementary School magnet program without consid-\neration of his race. Such consideration will re-examine that request\nfor admission \"as of the date it was made.\" Podberesky II, 38 F.3d at\n162.\n\nWe are justified in requiring the entry of an injunction finally dis-\nposing of this case without an evidentiary hearing because the record\nclearly establishes the plaintiff's right to an injunction and such a\nhearing would not have altered the result. See Lone Star Steakhouse\n& Saloon v. Alpha of Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685608\"><a href=\"/opinion/685608/lone-star-steakhouse-saloon-incorporated-max-shayne-incorporated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 938 (4th Cir. 1995). This\nis so because no fact on which we have based our opinion is chal-\nlenged and in this case we have the compound constitutional wrongs\nof an invalid racially based transfer policy sustaining invalid racial\nbalancing.\n\nOur decision is very narrow. We feel that we should point out what\nis not decided. See Loving v. Alexander, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442877\"><a href=\"/opinion/442877/robert-m-bettie-h-loving-dewey-c-mary-c-martin-paul-b-gertrude/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867 (4th Cir.\n1984). We have not enjoined any aspect of the transfer policy of\nMontgomery County except that it may not consider the race of the\napplicant in granting or denying the transfer. We have not decided\nthat diversity, as the term is used here, either is or is not a compelling\ngovernmental interest. The absence of any rigid academic qualifica-\ntions for transfer and selection by lot if a surplus of applications, for\nexample, seem to open the opportunity to transfer to magnet schools\nto all students in the system, without respect to their race or any other\nqualification except their implicit desire to obtain a better education.\nDesire is not race based. Nothing in this record would indicate that\nthe other aspects of the transfer policy--stability, utilization, enroll-\nment and personal hardship--are race based, and we do not disturb\nthem.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n\n                     18\n\f</pre>",
