In the district court, the Ute Indian Tribe (“Tribe”)\n\nsought to obtain a permanent injunction preventing the State of Utah, the counties\n\nof Duchesne and Uintah, and the cities of Roosevelt and Duchesne (“state and\n\nlocal defendants”) from exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction on certain lands\n\n\n\n\n      The Honorable John C. Godbold, Senior Circuit Judge, United States Court of\n      *\n\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwithin the original exterior boundary of the Uintah Valley Reservation in a\n\nmanner inconsistent with our en banc opinion in Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, 773\n\nF.2d 1087 (10th Cir. 1985) (en banc), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994 (1986). In\n\nopposing the injunction, the state and local defendants rely on Hagen v. Utah, 510\n\nU.S. 399 (1994), in which the Supreme Court held, contrary to our decision in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe, that the lands in question are not part of the Uintah Valley\n\nReservation. Notwithstanding Hagen, the district court held that it was bound\n\nunder the “law of the case” doctrine to follow our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe\n\nand thus, that it was without authority to alter the existing jurisdictional\n\nboundaries as set forth in Ute Indian Tribe. In light of the inconsistency between\n\nUte Indian Tribe and Hagen, however, the district court requested that we issue\n\ninstructions on how to proceed and suggested that we construe the request as an\n\ninvitation to recall our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe.\n\n      The state and local defendants appeal, arguing that (1) our en banc decision\n\nin Ute Indian Tribe does not preclude their exercise of jurisdiction over former\n\nreservation lands under the doctrines of law of the case, collateral estoppel, or res\n\njudicata and (2) Hagen effectively overruled Ute Indian Tribe, permitting the\n\ndefendants to exercise jurisdiction over all the lands originally held to be within\n\nreservation boundaries. Along with their appeal, the state and local defendants\n\nhave filed a motion to recall, in its entirety, our mandate issued pursuant to Ute\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fIndian Tribe. The United States as amicus curiae urges us to recall and modify\n\nthe mandate in Ute Indian Tribe only to the extent that it directly conflicts with\n\nHagen. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Because we\n\nconclude that the boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation must be\n\nredetermined in light of Hagen, we modify our holding in Ute Indian Tribe to the\n\nextent that it directly conflicts with the holding in Hagen.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\nI.    I NTRODUCTION\n\n      This case is unlike other reservation diminishment cases in which courts\n\nmust decide whether congressional enactments opening reservation lands to non-\n\nIndian settlement have diminished or disestablished reservation boundaries. See,\n\ne.g., Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463 (1984); Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430\n\nU.S. 584 (1977); DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425 (1975); Mattz\n\nv. Arnett, 412 U.S. 481 (1973); Seymour v. Superintendent of Wash. State\n\nPenitentiary, 368 U.S. 351 (1962); United States v. Celestine, 215 U.S. 278\n\n(1909). Over a decade ago, we answered that question when we addressed\n\nwhether congressional enactments from 1902 through 1905 had the effect of\n\ndiminishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. Ute Indian Tribe, 773 F.2d at 1093.\n\nSitting en banc in 1985, we held that the Reservation had not been diminished.\n\nId. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on December 1, 1986. Ute Indian Tribe\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fv. Utah, 479 U.S. 994 (1986).\n\n      The State of Utah sought to relitigate the boundary issue in three criminal\n\nactions commenced in the Utah state courts. In these cases, the Utah Supreme\n\nCourt concluded that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation had diminished the\n\nUintah Valley Reservation. State v. Hagen, 858 P.2d 925 (Utah 1992); State v.\n\nCoando, 858 P.2d 926 (Utah 1992); State v. Perank, 858 P.2d 927 (Utah 1992).\n\n      In 1994, the Supreme Court granted certiorari “to resolve the direct conflict\n\nbetween these decisions of the Tenth Circuit and the Utah Supreme Court on the\n\nquestion whether the Uintah Reservation has been diminished.” Hagen, 510 U.S.\n\nat 409. The Supreme Court expressly disagreed with our decision in Ute Indian\n\nTribe and held that the Uintah Valley Reservation had been diminished. Id. at\n\n421-22. In this appeal, we decide whether to modify our judgment in Ute Indian\n\nTribe, after the time for rehearing has passed, in light of its conflict with a later,\n\ncontrary decision of the Supreme Court.\n\nII.   U TE I NDIAN T RIBE I-III: T HE D ISTRICT C OURT , P ANEL , AND E N B ANC\n      O PINIONS\n\n      In 1975, the Tribe sought to exercise jurisdiction over all of the land\n\noriginally encompassed in the Uintah Valley Reservation pursuant to the Tribe’s\n\nnewly enacted Law and Order Code. When non-Indians living in and around\n\nseveral towns within the original boundaries protested the action, the Tribe sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief in federal court to establish the exterior\n\n                                          -5-\n\fboundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation and to restrain the state and local\n\ndefendants from interfering with enforcement of the Law and Order Code within\n\nthose boundaries. The Tribe argued that the original boundaries of the Uintah\n\nValley Reservation, established by executive order in 1861 and confirmed by\n\nCongress in 1864, continued to exist undiminished. The Tribe thus argued that it\n\nhad jurisdiction over all of the lands encompassed within the original boundaries\n\nof the Reservation because such lands were “Indian country” as defined by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1151.\n\n      On the other hand, the state and local defendants argued that congressional\n\nenactments from 1902 through 1905, opening Reservation lands to non-Indian\n\nsettlement and setting aside lands for a national forest reserve, had the effect of\n\ndiminishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. The defendants also argued that\n\ncongressional enactments from 1894 to 1897 had the effect of completely\n\ndisestablishing the Tribe’s Uncompahgre Reservation.\n\n      In addressing the parties arguments, the district court gave a comprehensive\n\nsummary of the relevant legislation, legislative history, contemporaneous\n\ninterpretations by the executive branch, and other circumstances surrounding the\n\nenactment of the legislation. We therefore only briefly summarize the legislative\n\ntreatment of the lands below.\n\n      A.     Legislative Treatment of Reservation Lands\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f            1.      The Uintah Valley Reservation\n\n      In 1902, Congress passed legislation directing the Secretary of the Interior\n\nto make individual allotments out of the Uintah Valley Reservation by October 1,\n\n1903, provided that a majority of the adult male members of the Ute Indians\n\nconsented. Act of May 27, 1902, ch. 888, 32 Stat. 263, 263-64 (“1902 Act”).\n\nThe 1902 Act stated that after October 1, 1903, “all the unallotted lands within\n\nsaid reservation shall be restored to the public domain” and subject to entry by\n\nnon-Indians under the homestead laws. Id. (emphasis added). Congress delayed\n\nthe allotment process, however, and extended the opening date in 1903 and again\n\nin 1904. Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 994, 32 Stat. 982, 997-98; Act of Apr. 21,\n\n1904, ch. 1402, 33 Stat. 189, 207-08. In 1905, Congress extended the opening\n\ndate a third time--to September 1, 1905--and directed the Secretary to allot the\n\nReservation unilaterally if the Tribe’s consent was not obtained. Act of Mar. 3,\n\n1905, ch. 1479, 33 Stat. 1048, 1069-70 (“1905 Act”). The 1905 Act did not\n\ncontain the same language restoring the unallotted and unreserved lands to the\n\n“public domain,” but provided that such lands “shall be disposed of under the\n\ngeneral provisions of the homestead and townsite laws of the United States.” Id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f2.   The National Forest Lands\n\n\n\n\n                      -8-\n\f      In addition to extending the time of entry under the 1902 Act and\n\ndescribing the entry process, the 1905 Act authorized the President to “set apart\n\nand reserve” lands in the Reservation as a forest reserve prior to opening. 33\n\nStat. 1070. Pursuant to this power, on July 14, 1905, President Theodore\n\nRoosevelt issued a proclamation designating some 1,010,000 acres within the\n\nUintah Valley Reservation as an addition to the Uintah National Forest Reserve.\n\nProclamation of July 14, 1905, 34 Stat. 3113, 3116. The proclamation also\n\ndeclared that the unallotted lands in the Uintah Valley Reservation, which were\n\nnot otherwise reserved, would “be opened to entry, settlement and disposition\n\nunder the general provisions of the homestead and townsite laws.” Id. at 3120.\n\n             3.     The Uncompahgre Reservation\n\n      In 1894, Congress passed legislation providing for the allotment of the\n\nUncompahgre Reservation to individual members of the Tribe. The legislation\n\nstated that all unallotted lands “shall . . . be restored to the public domain and\n\nmade subject to entry” under the homestead and mineral laws. Act of Aug. 15,\n\n1894, ch. 290, 28 Stat. 286, 337-38 (emphasis added). The allotment process,\n\nhowever, was delayed, and in 1897, Congress passed legislation mandating the\n\nallotment of the Uncompahgre Reservation and opening the unallotted lands to\n\nentry. Act of June 7, 1897, ch. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 87.\n\n      B.     Ute Indian Tribe I: 1981 District Court Opinion\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      In 1981, the district court issued Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, 521 F. Supp.\n\n1072 (D. Utah 1981) (hereinafter “Ute Indian Tribe I”). The district court held\n\nthat Congress’s decision to open the unallotted lands to settlement did not\n\ndiminish the Reservation’s boundaries. Id. at 1132. The court recognized that the\n\nlanguage of the 1902 Act directing that all unallotted lands “be restored to the\n\npublic domain” would have diminished the Reservation had the unallotted lands\n\nthen been opened for settlement. Id. at 1122. The court concluded, however, that\n\nthe 1905 Act superseded the 1902 Act. Id. Unlike the 1902 Act, the 1905 Act\n\nprovided only that the unallotted lands were to “be disposed of under” the\n\nhomestead and township laws. Id. at 1132. The district court reasoned that the\n\nnew language indicated that Congress did not intend to diminish the Reservation.\n\nId. The district court therefore concluded that the unallotted lands remained part\n\nof the Uintah Valley Reservation. Id.\n\n      The district court reached a different conclusion on the status of the\n\nNational Forest Lands and the Uncompahgre Reservation. Regarding the National\n\nForest Lands, the court concluded that the language in the 1905 Act empowering\n\nthe president to “set apart and reserve” timber lands for a national forest\n\ndemonstrated Congress’s clear intent to diminish the Uintah Valley Reservation.\n\nId. at 1136. Likewise, the district court concluded that the language in the 1894\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fAct restoring unallotted reservation lands “to the public domain” showed a clear\n\ncongressional intent to disestablish the Uncompahgre Reservation. Id. at 1106.\n\n      C.    Ute Indian Tribe II: The 1983 Court of Appeals Panel Decision\n\n      In a two-judge majority opinion, a panel of this court affirmed the district\n\ncourt opinion in part and reversed in part. Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, 716 F.2d\n\n1298 (10th Cir. 1983) (hereinafter “Ute Indian Tribe II”). The panel held that\n\nnone of the lands in question remained within the original reservation boundaries.\n\n      The panel agreed with the district court that the 1902 Act’s language\n\nrestoring the unallotted lands “to the public domain” was sufficient to diminish\n\nthe Uintah Valley Reservation. Id. at 1308-09. Unlike the district court,\n\nhowever, the panel concluded that the 1905 Act did not supersede Congress’s\n\nintent to diminish the Reservation under the 1902 Act. Id. at 1311. Thus, the\n\npanel held that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation had diminished the Uintah\n\nValley Reservation. Id. at 1311-12.\n\n      The panel agreed with the district court’s conclusions regarding the\n\nNational Forest Lands and the Uncompahgre Reservation. The panel concluded\n\nthat Congress intended to withdraw the National Forest Lands, id. at 1314, and\n\nthe Uncompahgre Reservation, id. at 1307, from their original reservation status.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 11 -\n\f        D.    Ute Indian Tribe III: The 1985 Court of Appeals En Banc\n              Decision\n\n        On rehearing en banc, a majority of the court held that all of the lands at\n\nissue retained their reservation status. Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, 773 F.2d 1087,\n\n1093 (10th Cir. 1985) (en banc) (hereinafter “Ute Indian Tribe III”). The en banc\n\ncourt concluded that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation did not have the effect\n\nof diminishing or disestablishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. Id. at 1089.\n\nSimilarly, the court held that the withdrawal of the National Forest Lands did not\n\ndiminish the Uintah Valley Reservation, id. at 1090, and that the 1894 and 1897\n\nallotment legislation did not disestablish the Uncompahgre Reservation. Id. at\n\n1093.\n\n        In reaching a holding completely contrary to the panel, the en banc court\n\nrelied on the newly-decided case of Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463 (1984). The\n\ncourt concluded that under Solem, congressional language restoring reservation\n\nlands to the public domain “is not the same as a congressional state of mind to\n\ndiminish,” and hence “does not reliably establish the clear and unequivocal\n\nevidence of Congress’ intent to change the boundaries.” Ute Indian Tribe III, 773\n\nF.2d at 1092. Further, the court found no legislative history or other\n\ncontemporary historical evidence sufficient to support a finding of diminishment\n\nor disestablishment as to any of the lands in question. Id. at 1092-93. Thus, the\n\ncourt held that all the lands retained their reservation status and remained Indian\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fcountry, subject to the jurisdiction of the Tribe and the federal government.\n\nThereafter, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, 479\n\nU.S. 994 (1986).\n\nIII.   U TAH V . H AGEN : T HE 1994 S UPREME C OURT D ECISION\n\n       In several related criminal cases arising in the late 1980s, the Utah Supreme\n\nCourt ruled, contrary to the Tenth Circuit, that the original boundaries of the\n\nUintah Valley Reservation had been diminished by the 1902-1905 allotment\n\nlegislation. See State v. Perank, 858 P.2d 927 (Utah 1992); State v. Coando, 858\n\nP.2d 926 (Utah 1992); State v. Hagen, 858 P.2d 925 (Utah 1992). The cases arose\n\nas a result of state felony prosecutions against three Indians for crimes committed\n\nin Myton and Roosevelt, Utah, two towns within the original boundaries of the\n\nUintah Valley Reservation. The defendants challenged the prosecutions on the\n\nbasis that the state trial court lacked jurisdiction over their crimes because the\n\ndefendants committed their crimes in “Indian country” as defined by 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1151(a). The defendants argued that under our en banc decision in Ute Indian\n\nTribe III, the towns remained within the Reservation and thus within Indian\n\ncountry. The State of Utah, on the other hand, argued that our holding in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III was wrong, that the Reservation had been diminished, and that\n\nthe towns were outside the Reservation and thus outside Indian country. The\n\nUtah Supreme Court agreed with the State, and held that because the Reservation\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\fhad been diminished, the state trial court properly exercised criminal jurisdiction\n\nover the defendants. Perank, 858 P.2d at 953; Coando, 858 P.2d at 927; Hagen,\n\n858 P.2d 925-26.\n\n      In 1993, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Hagen to resolve the\n\nconflict between the decisions of the Tenth Circuit and the Utah Supreme Court.\n\nHagen v. Utah, 507 U.S. 1028 (1993). In 1994, the Supreme Court affirmed the\n\nUtah Supreme Court’s resolution of the boundary issue, expressly rejecting Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III’s conclusion that the Uintah Valley Reservation had not been\n\ndiminished. Hagen v. Utah, 510 U.S. 399, 421-22 (1994).\n\n      In Hagen, the Supreme Court performed a familiar analysis of the statutory\n\nlanguage, legislative history, and contemporary historical understanding of the\n\nallotment legislation at issue. See id. at 410-21. The Court’s analysis, however,\n\nwas limited to the status of the unallotted Uintah Valley Reservation lands opened\n\nto settlement under the 1902-1905 allotment legislation. See id. The Court did\n\nnot address the National Forest Lands or the Uncompahgre Reservation, neither of\n\nwhich was before the Court for consideration. After looking to the three\n\ndiminishment factors, the Court concluded that Congress’s “baseline intent to\n\ndiminish the Reservation expressed in the 1902 Act survived the passage of the\n\n1905 Act,” id. at 415, and that the “[c]ontemporary historical evidence supports\n\n[the] conclusion that Congress intended to diminish the Uintah Reservation.” Id.\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fat 416. The Court therefore upheld the State of Utah’s exercise of criminal\n\njurisdiction over acts occurring within the original boundaries of the Uintah\n\nValley Reservation. Id. at 421-22.\n\nIV.   Ute Indian Tribe IV: The 1996 District Court Decision\n\n      Immediately after the Utah Supreme Court issued its slip opinions in the\n\nstate criminal cases, the Tribe filed a motion in federal district court seeking a\n\npermanent injunction preventing the state and local defendants from enforcing or\n\nrelying upon Perank, Coando, and Hagen in any way. On August 31, 1992, the\n\nstate and local defendants and the Tribe entered into a stipulation, under which\n\nthe state and local defendants agreed to refrain from enforcing the Utah Supreme\n\nCourt decision in Perank or exercising jurisdiction in any manner inconsistent\n\nwith the en banc decision in Ute Indian Tribe III, pending a decision on the merits\n\nin the district court. The district court incorporated the stipulation into an order\n\ndated September 2, 1992 (“Injunction Order”).\n\n      In 1993, after the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Hagen, the district\n\ncourt stayed further proceedings on the Tribe’s motion pending the outcome of\n\nHagen in the Supreme Court. On February 23, 1994, the Supreme Court issued its\n\ndecision in Hagen. On April 24, 1994, the state and local defendants filed a\n\nmotion to vacate and set aside the Injunction Order and to dismiss the Tribe’s\n\nmotion for permanent injunctive relief.\n\n\n                                          - 15 -\n\f       On May 2, 1994, the district court modified the Injunction Order “to allow\n\nthe [s]tate and [l]ocal [d]efendants to prosecute felony crimes occurring on lands\n\nwithin the original boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation which are not\n\n‘Indian country’ as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1151, et seq.” The court emphasized\n\nthat it was “not determining one way or another which lands may or may not\n\nconstitute ‘Indian country.’” 1\n\n       On April 2, 1996, the district court issued Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, 935 F.\n\nSupp. 1473 (D. Utah 1996) (“Ute Indian Tribe IV”). In a comprehensive and\n\ndetailed opinion, the district court fully addressed the binding effect, as between\n\nthe parties, of our earlier en banc decision in Ute Indian Tribe III, as well as the\n\nextent of direct conflict between Ute Indian Tribe III and Hagen. Id. at 1484-\n\n1516. Rather than finally deciding these issues, however, the district court held\n\nthat it was bound under “law of the case” rules to enforce the mandate in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III. Id. at 1516-25. Thus, the district court did not reach the merits\n\nof the Tribe’s request for permanent injunctive relief. Id. In lieu of a final\n\nresolution of the dispute, the district court requested that we issue instructions on\n\nhow to proceed and suggested that we construe the request as an invitation to\n\n\n       1\n         The district court modified its order to allow the State of Utah to prosecute\nfelonies on former reservation lands because in United States v. Duncan, 857 F. Supp.\n852 (D. Utah 1994), the district court had dismissed a federal felony prosecution against\nan Indian for acts occurring in Roosevelt, Utah. The court ruled that Hagen precluded\nfederal jurisdiction on such lands. Id. at 853.\n\n                                           - 16 -\n\frecall our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III. The court also concluded that the\n\nInjunction Order, as modified, should remain in effect to allow the state and local\n\ndefendants to prosecute criminal felonies occurring on former Uintah Valley\n\nReservation lands. Id. at 1531. This appeal followed.\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\nI.    I NTRODUCTION\n\n      On appeal, the Tribe maintains that principles of finality require the district\n\ncourt to enjoin permanently the state and local defendants from exercising\n\njurisdiction in a manner inconsistent with Ute Indian Tribe III. On the other\n\nhand, the state and local defendants argue that we should give effect to the\n\ncontrary boundary determination in Hagen by recalling the mandate in Ute Indian\n\nTribe III in its entirety and reinstating the original Tenth Circuit panel opinion.\n\nThe United States as amicus curiae urges us to recall and modify the mandate in\n\nUte Indian Tribe III only to the extent that it directly conflicts with Hagen.\n\n      In resolving this dispute, we follow a three-part framework. First, we\n\ndecide whether the district court was bound to follow the mandate in Ute Indian\n\nTribe III by continuing the Injunction Order. After concluding that the district\n\ncourt properly followed our mandate, we nevertheless decide whether to modify\n\nUte Indian Tribe III in light of the inconsistent boundary determination in Hagen.\n\nFinally, after concluding that Ute Indian Tribe III should be modified, we decide\n\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\fwhether to recall our mandate in its entirety or modify our en banc opinion only to\n\nthe extent that it directly conflicts with Hagen. Because of the importance of\n\nfinality, we conclude that Ute Indian Tribe III should be modified only to the\n\nextent that it conflicts with Hagen.\n\nII.   T HE B INDING E FFECT OF U TE I NDIAN T RIBE III\n\n      We begin by determining the binding effect of Ute Indian Tribe III on the\n\nallocation of jurisdiction among the federal government, the Tribe, and the state\n\nand local defendants. Whether the district court was bound by the mandate in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III to continue the Injunction Order, and whether this court is bound\n\nby principles of finality to enforce our prior boundary determination, are separate\n\ninquiries. We address each question in turn.\n\n      A.     The Mandate Rule\n\n      The state and local defendants first contend that the district court erred in\n\nholding that it was bound by Ute Indian Tribe III to continue to enjoin their\n\nexercise of civil and non-felony jurisdiction despite the Supreme Court’s decision\n\nin Hagen. We review the district court’s decision to continue an injunction for an\n\nabuse of discretion, examining “whether the district court committed an error of\n\nlaw or relied on clearly erroneous fact findings.” Walmer v. United States Dep’t\n\nof Defense, 52 F.3d 851, 854 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 474 (1995). We\n\nreview questions of law decided by the district court de novo. Harolds Stores,\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\fInc. v. Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc., 82 F.3d 1533, 1555 (10th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n117 S. Ct. 297 (1996).\n\n      The district court concluded that it was bound by the “law of the case”\n\ndoctrine to enforce the boundary determinations in Ute Indian Tribe III. Under\n\nthat doctrine, once a court decides an issue, the same issue may not be relitigated\n\nin subsequent proceedings in the same case. Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605,\n\n618-19 (1983); United States v. Monsisvais, 946 F.2d 114, 115-16 (10th Cir.\n\n1991). An important corollary of the doctrine, known as the “mandate rule,”\n\nprovides that a district court “must comply strictly with the mandate rendered by\n\nthe reviewing court.” Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of\n\nAmerica, 962 F.2d 1528, 1534 (10th Cir. 1992); see also Mason v. Texaco, Inc.,\n\n948 F.2d 1546, 1553 (10th Cir. 1991) (“Under the ‘law of the case’ doctrine, the\n\ndistrict court may not deviate from the appellate court’s mandate.”). In this case,\n\nthe district court concluded that the mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III remained in\n\neffect and therefore ruled that it was bound to follow the mandate by continuing\n\nto enjoin the defendants’ exercise of jurisdiction.\n\n      The state and local defendants contend that the district court is not bound\n\nby the mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III because of an intervening change in\n\ncontrolling law, an exception to the mandate rule. See Pittsburg & Midway Coal\n\nMining Co. v. Watchman, 52 F.3d 1531, 1536 n.4 (10th Cir. 1995). The\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fdefendants maintain that because Hagen was “intervening” (i.e., coming after Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III but before the Tribe’s present motion for injunctive relief), the\n\ndistrict court should have departed from the appellate mandate and followed the\n\nboundary determination in Hagen. The defendants contend that the district court,\n\nby failing to do so, wrongfully continued to enjoin their exercise of jurisdiction\n\npursuant to Hagen.\n\n      The argument of the state and local defendants is without merit. In short,\n\nthe intervening-change-in-law exception does not apply where, as here, the case\n\nin which the erroneous ruling occurred is no longer sub judice--that is, where the\n\ncase has become final. See Colorado Interstate Gas, 962 F.2d at 1534 (holding\n\nthat once an appellate court resolves an issue and remands the case to enter\n\njudgment in accordance with the mandate, the district court may not disregard the\n\nmandate and apply a later change in law on remand because the question is no\n\nlonger sub judice); Collins v. City of Wichita, 254 F.2d 837, 839 (10th Cir. 1958)\n\n(holding that “[a] change in the law or in the judicial view of an established rule\n\nof law is not such an extraordinary circumstance which justifies” setting aside a\n\nfinal judgment).\n\n      In Ute Indian Tribe III, our en banc opinion disposed of all boundary\n\nquestions at issue on the merits. Our ruling left nothing for the district court to\n\naddress beyond the “ministerial dictates of the mandate.” Colorado Interstate Gas\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fCo., 962 F.2d at 1534. In other words, the case was no longer sub judice after\n\nDecember 9, 1986. As of that date, the district court was without authority to\n\ndepart from an appellate mandate based on a later change in law. Because Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III proceeded to a final decision, a later change in law could not\n\n“reopen the door already closed.” James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501\n\nU.S. 529, 541 (1991). Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly\n\nfollowed our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III by continuing to enjoin the state and\n\nlocal defendants from exercising jurisdiction pursuant to Hagen.\n\n      B.     Modification of Ute Indian Tribe III\n\n      Although the district court did not err in holding that it was bound by Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III, we nevertheless must decide whether to modify our judgment in\n\nUte Indian Tribe III in light of the Supreme Court’s inconsistent boundary\n\ndetermination in Hagen. The question whether to modify our earlier judgment\n\nraises competing concerns involving the finality of a court’s judgment and the\n\nneed for uniformity in decisionmaking throughout the federal court system. In\n\ndeciding this question, we first discuss whether an appellate court has the power\n\nto modify a mandate and the circumstances in which exercise of that power is\n\nappropriate. With these circumstances in mind, we next determine whether we\n\nare precluded by the principles of collateral estoppel or res judicata from\n\ndeparting from the boundary determination of Ute Indian Tribe III. Finally, after\n\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\fconcluding that we are not bound by the traditional principles of finality, we\n\ndirectly confront the relative importance of finality and uniformity in the context\n\nof this case.\n\n                1.   The Power of an Appellate Court to Modify a Mandate\n\n       The defendants’ motion to recall the mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III\n\nrequires us first to ask whether an appellate court possesses the authority to recall\n\nor modify a mandate after the time for rehearing has passed. In this circuit, as in\n\nall circuits that have addressed the issue, “an appellate court has power to set\n\naside at any time a mandate that was procured by fraud or act to prevent an\n\ninjustice, or to preserve the integrity of the judicial process.” Coleman v. Turpen,\n\n827 F.2d 667, 671 (10th Cir. 1987); see also American Iron & Steel Inst. v. EPA,\n\n560 F.2d 589, 593 n.15 (3d Cir. 1977) (listing cases); Greater Boston Television\n\nCorp. v. FCC, 463 F.2d 268, 275-80 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (discussing particular\n\ngrounds for recalling a mandate). Although the rule is stated in broad terms, the\n\nappellate courts have emphasized that the power to recall or modify a mandate is\n\nlimited and should be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances. See\n\nAmerican Iron & Steel Inst., 560 F.2d at 594 (emphasizing that recall of a\n\nmandate is “an extraordinary remedy, one to be used sparingly”). 2 The limited\n\n\n       2\n        Indeed, we have found only one case in which we have departed from a prior\nmandate after a final decision because of a later change in law. In Pierce v. Cook & Co.,\n518 F.2d 720, 723 (10th Cir. 1975), we permitted relitigation of already settled claims\n\n                                          - 22 -\n\fnature of this power is a reflection of the importance of finality: once parties are\n\nafforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate, the controversy must come to an\n\nend and courts must be able to clear their dockets of decided cases. As the Third\n\nCircuit explained, “[P]arties should be afforded ample opportunity to litigate their\n\nclaims, but once a final disposition is reached they should not expect that the\n\ngood offices of the court will be available for a chance to press their claims\n\nanew.” Id. at 592. Mindful of the important limitations on an appellate court’s\n\npower to disrupt a settled judgment, we next address whether we are precluded\n\nfrom modifying the mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III under the principles of\n\ncollateral estoppel or res judicata .\n\n              2.     Collateral Estoppel and Res Judicata\n\n       In seeking permanent injunctive relief against the state and local\n\ndefendants, the Tribe contends that collateral estoppel and res judicata preclude\n\nthe state and local defendants from relying on Hagen. In particular, the Tribe\n\nargues that the Court should enjoin the defendants’ enforcement of Hagen under\n\nthe relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2283, 3 which\n\n\nwhere plaintiffs with claims under state law were forced to litigate in federal court\nbecause of diversity and received “substantially different treatment than that [later]\nreceived in state court by another injured in the same accident.” Id. at 723. Pierce was an\n“extraordinary case” based on an “unusual combination of events” and is not applicable to\nthe case before us today. Id.\n       3\n          Section 2283 provides: “A court of the United States may not grant an injunction\nto stay proceedings in a State Court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or\n\n                                          - 23 -\n\fpermits a federal court to enjoin proceedings in state court where the party\n\nasserting a claim or issue in the state court is barred from doing so by res judicata\n\nor collateral estoppel. See Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., 486 U.S. 140, 150-\n\n51 (1988) (“The relitigation exception was designed to permit a federal court to\n\nprevent state litigation of an issue that previously was presented to and decided by\n\nthe federal court. It is founded in the well-recognized concepts of res judicata\n\nand collateral estoppel.”). The Tribe argues that because Ute Indian Tribe III\n\nproduced a final judgment on the merits (thereby resolving the boundary issue in\n\nfavor of the Tribe), the doctrine of collateral estoppel binds this court and\n\nprecludes the defendants from enforcing the contrary holding in Hagen. The\n\nTribe maintains that the Supreme Court’s decision in Federated Department\n\nStores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394 (1981), prohibits any departure from the\n\nsettled boundary determination of Ute Indian Tribe III, even where that decision\n\nis erroneous in light of a later change in law.\n\n       We disagree that Federated Department Stores controls the outcome of this\n\ncase. In Federated Department Stores, 452 U.S. at 398, the Supreme Court\n\nrejected an attempt by the Ninth Circuit to craft an exception to the doctrine of\n\nres judicata based on a later change in controlling law. The case involved seven\n\nretail purchasers who brought separate actions against the owners of various\n\n\n\nwhere necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.”\n\n                                            - 24 -\n\fdepartment stores, alleging that the stores had engaged in illegal price fixing. Id.\n\nat 395-96. After the district court dismissed the actions on the grounds that the\n\nplaintiffs had failed to state a claim for relief under the applicable statute, five of\n\nthe plaintiffs appealed the ruling and, ultimately, obtained a reversal by the\n\nSupreme Court. Id. at 396. Instead of appealing the district court’s ruling as the\n\nother five plaintiffs had done, two plaintiffs refiled their actions in state court,\n\nwhich were removed to federal court. Id. The federal district court held that\n\nbecause the two plaintiffs sought to relitigate the same claim against the same\n\ndefendants, the actions had to be dismissed under the doctrine of res judicata. Id.\n\nat 396-97.\n\n      The two plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit. Id. at 397. While their\n\nappeal was pending, the Supreme Court announced that the other plaintiffs had\n\nstated a claim for relief. Id. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the two plaintiffs\n\nshould be allowed to benefit from the Supreme Court’s decision because their\n\nposition was closely interwoven with the other five cases. Id. The court stated\n\nthat because all of the dismissals rested on precedent that the Supreme Court had\n\nsince overruled, the doctrine of res judicata must give way to the competing\n\nconcerns of “public policy” and “simple justice.” Id. at 398.\n\n      In reversing, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the Ninth Circuit’s\n\n“novel exception to the doctrine of res judicata.” Id. The Court explained:\n\n\n                                          - 25 -\n\f      [W]e do not see the grave injustice which would be done by the\n      application of accepted principles of res judicata. . . . The doctrine of\n      res judicata serves vital public interests beyond any individual\n      judge’s ad hoc determination of the equities of a particular case.\n      There is simply no principle of law or equity which sanctions the\n      rejection by a federal court of the salutary principle of res judicata\n      . . . . This Court has long recognized that [p]ublic policy dictates that\n      there be an end of litigation; that those who have contested an issue\n      shall be bound by the result of the contest, and that matters once tried\n      shall be considered forever settled as between the parties.\n\nId. at 401 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Contrary to the Tribe’s argument, our case is distinguishable from\n\nFederated Department Stores in two important respects. First, in contrast to\n\nFederated Department Stores, where the issue was whether a change in law would\n\npermit the incipient relitigation of an issue resolved in a prior suit, the State of\n\nUtah in this case has already relitigated the boundary issue. We are not now\n\ndeciding whether a party--in this case the State--deserves a second bite at the\n\napple. The boundary relitigation is over. The Utah Supreme Court has issued a\n\nfinal ruling, which the United States Supreme Court has affirmed, resulting in a\n\nclearly inconsistent judgment. For this reason, the Tribe’s reliance on collateral\n\nestoppel is misplaced.\n\n      Second, in deciding whether to modify Ute Indian Tribe III, we are not\n\nmotivated by a desire to achieve a more accurate judgment or to avoid the\n\ninjustice that might result from a strict application of the principles of finality, as\n\nwas the case in Federated Department Stores. The fact that Ute Indian Tribe III\n\n                                          - 26 -\n\fmay have been wrongly decided or operates unfairly against the state and local\n\ndefendants is not a concern that informs our analysis. See 18 C HARLES A.\n\nW RIGHT ET AL ., F EDERAL P RACTICE AND P ROCEDURE § 4426, at 265 (1981) (“If\n\nrelitigation were permitted whenever it might result in a more accurate\n\ndetermination, in the name of ‘justice,’ the very values served by preclusion\n\nwould be quickly destroyed.”). Rather, our decision is based on the need to\n\nreconcile two inconsistent boundary determinations and to provide a uniform\n\nallocation of jurisdiction among separate sovereigns. For this reason, Federated\n\nDepartment Store’s relevance to this case is limited. The question here is not\n\nwhether the State of Utah should be able to relitigate the boundary issue (which it\n\nhas already done), but which decision--Ute Indian Tribe III or Hagen--should\n\ncontrol the allocation of jurisdiction among the state and local defendants, the\n\nTribe, and the federal government. The State’s successful relitigation of the\n\nboundary issue has put the judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III on a collision course\n\nwith Hagen, and therefore, we must directly confront whether Ute Indian Tribe III\n\nshould give way to the equally final, contrary judgment in Hagen. To that\n\ninquiry, we now turn.\n\n             3.    Finality and Uniformity\n\n      As discussed above, the question whether to modify our judgment in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III raises the competing concerns of finality and uniformity. Thus,\n\n\n                                       - 27 -\n\fin deciding this question, we must assess the relative importance of finality and\n\nuniformity in the context of this case.\n\n      Although we are not bound by collateral estoppel to enforce the boundary\n\ndetermination of Ute Indian Tribe III, departure from this settled judgment\n\nimplicates the important purposes of finality. Over a century ago, the Supreme\n\nCourt discussed the importance of finality:\n\n      This general rule is demanded by the very object for which civil\n      courts have been established, which is to secure the peace and repose\n      of society by the settlement of matters capable of judicial\n      determination. Its enforcement is essential to the maintenance of\n      social order; for the aid of judicial tribunals would not be invoked\n      for the vindication of rights of person and property if, as between\n      parties and their privies, conclusiveness did not attend the judgments\n      of such tribunals in respect of all matters properly put in issue, and\n      actually determined by them.\n\nSouthern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897); see also Kremer v.\n\nChem. Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 467 n.6 (1982). The Court also has addressed\n\nthe particular purposes of finality:\n\n      To preclude parties from contesting matters that they have had a full\n      and fair opportunity to litigate protects their adversaries from the\n      expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial\n      resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the\n      possibility of inconsistent decisions.\n\nMontana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153-54 (1979). Accordingly, before\n\ndeparting from a settled decision, we must consider whether such departure might\n\n“substantially frustrate [collateral estoppel’s] purpose of protecting litigants from\n\n\n                                          - 28 -\n\fburdensome relitigation and of promoting judicial economy.” United States v.\n\nStauffer Chem. Co., 464 U.S. 165, 172 (1984).\n\n      The Tribe contends that departure from Ute Indian Tribe III would frustrate\n\nthe important purposes of finality and would upset its reasonable expectations in\n\nthe continuing validity of a settled judgment. The litigation that led to Ute Indian\n\nTribe III lasted ten years and resulted in a costly victory for the Tribe. It also\n\nconsumed important judicial resources. Perhaps most important from the Tribe’s\n\npoint of view, the decision in Ute Indian Tribe III purported to define\n\nconclusively the respective jurisdictional boundaries of the various governmental\n\nauthorities operating in and around the Uintah Valley Reservation. Indeed, the\n\nTribe continues to rely on Ute Indian Tribe III in exercising civil and non-felony\n\njurisdiction on lands within the original reservation boundaries. “When a court\n\nhas determined disestablishment of a given reservation in its particular historical\n\nand factual setting, prevention of inconsistent adjudication becomes desirable\n\ninsofar as it fosters reliance on judicial decision making.” White Earth Band of\n\nChippewa Indians v. Alexander, 683 F.2d 1129, 1135 (8th Cir. 1982). The Tribe\n\nargues that this reasoning, as well as the other important purposes of finality,\n\nsupport enforcement of the settled judgment of Ute Indian Tribe III.\n\n      The same important purposes of finality, however, apply equally to the final\n\njudgment in Hagen. Once Hagen became final, the State of Utah was entitled to\n\n\n                                         - 29 -\n\frely on the collateral estoppel effect of that judgment just as the Tribe was\n\nentitled to rely on its judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III. Had the Tribe brought its\n\npresent request for injunctive relief prior to the conclusion of the state litigation\n\nin Hagen, the principle of finality clearly would have favored the Tribe and might\n\neven have required an injunction against the state proceedings. See Parsons Steel,\n\nInc. v. First Ala. Bank, 474 U.S. 518, 524 (1986) (holding that the relitigation\n\nexception to the Anti-Injunction Act does not permit a federal court to enjoin a\n\nstate court proceeding “once the state court has finally rejected a claim of res\n\njudicata”). In this situation, however, where the State has already relitigated the\n\nboundary issue, the economy and judicial resource concerns that normally operate\n\nto preclude a second lawsuit are of little relevance. Although the Tribe may have\n\na more forceful reliance interest given the length of time Ute Indian Tribe III has\n\nremained in effect, enjoining the state and local defendants in this situation would\n\ndo little to further the core purposes of finality. As discussed above, the second\n\nlitigation has proceeded to a final judgment and has already resulted in an\n\ninconsistent decision.\n\n      Moreover, we note that “res judicata and collateral estoppel . . . promote\n\nthe comity between state and federal courts that has been recognized as a bulwark\n\nof the federal system.” Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 95-96 (1980). Thus,\n\nenjoining the State’s enforcement of Hagen in this situation would “violate basic\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\ftenets of comity and federalism.” Kremer, 456 U.S. at 478. By reaching the\n\nmerits in Hagen, the Utah Supreme Court effectively ruled that the State was not\n\nprecluded from relitigating the boundary issue. In the absence of a successful\n\nchallenge to this ruling in the Supreme Court, we must give full effect to the state\n\ncourt judgment and may not impose “the highly intrusive remedy of a federal-\n\ncourt injunction against the enforcement of the state court judgment.” Parsons\n\nSteel, Inc., 474 U.S. at 525. 4\n\n       In the situation before us, where the purposes of finality do not clearly\n\nsupport enforcement of either judgment, we might on the sole basis of our\n\nhierarchical system of courts prefer to give effect to the pronouncement of the\n\nSupreme Court. In an analogous context, for example, the D.C. Circuit stated that\n\n“[w]here, as here, a decision of the Supreme Court--the preeminent tribunal in our\n\n\n\n       4\n         In State v. Hagen, 802 P.2d 745, 747 (Utah Ct. App. 1990), the Utah Court of\nAppeals expressly relied on the collateral estoppel effect of Ute Indian Tribe III in\nholding that the state court lacked jurisdiction over the Indian defendants. Nevertheless,\nthe Utah Supreme Court reversed, citing its earlier conclusion in the companion case of\nState v. Perank, 858 P.2d 927 (Utah 1992), but without further discussion of collateral\nestoppel. Hagen, 858 P.2d at 925-26. When Hagen reached the Supreme Court, the\nCourt declined to address whether collateral estoppel barred relitigation of the boundary\nissue. Hagen, 510 U.S. at 409-10. The Court relied on the procedural ground that\ncounsel for the petitioner had failed to raise collateral estoppel in seeking a writ of\ncertiorari. Id. The Court found “no reason to consider an argument that petitioner not\nonly failed to raise but on which he expressly refused to rely in seeking a writ of\ncertiorari.” Id. at 410. Accordingly, the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling that collateral\nestoppel did not prevent relitigation of the boundary issue remains the settled judgment of\nthat court.\n\n                                           - 31 -\n\fjudicial system--departs in some pivotal aspects from those of lower federal\n\ncourts, amendatory action may be in order to bring the pronouncements of the\n\nlatter courts into line with the views of the former.” American Iron & Steel Inst.,\n\n560 F.2d at 596. We do not, however, take such “amendatory action” in this case\n\nmerely on the basis of the incongruency between our decision in Ute Indian Tribe\n\nIII and Hagen. Additional factors, including the importance of uniformity, also\n\nsupport our view that Ute Indian Tribe III should be modified in light of Hagen.\n\n      Uniformity is an important value in our system of judicial decisionmaking.\n\nWhile “[c]onflicts in the circuits are generally accepted and in some ways even\n\nwelcomed,” Stauffer Chem. Co., 464 U.S. at 177 (White, J., concurring), uniform\n\ndecisionmaking within each circuit is essential. The related doctrines of\n\ncollateral estoppel and stare decisis are exactly the sort of tools that have been\n\ndesigned to ensure uniformity and compliance with binding precedent. Like\n\ncollateral estoppel, stare decisis “promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and\n\nconsistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions,\n\nand contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.”\n\nPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991). Unfortunately, these doctrines\n\nhave so far failed to prevent the inconsistency between Ute Indian Tribe III and\n\nHagen. Given the important values that underlie these doctrines, we cannot allow\n\nsuch an inconsistency to persist.\n\n\n                                         - 32 -\n\f       More importantly, the lack of uniformity between Ute Indian Tribe III and\n\nHagen presents a practical dilemma of daily importance. Although the Tribe\n\ncontinues to exercise civil and non-felony criminal jurisdiction on those portions\n\nof the Uintah Valley Reservation that were opened to settlement under the 1902-\n\n1905 allotment legislation, the State of Utah is solely responsible under Hagen for\n\nbringing felony prosecutions on the same lands. Often the difference between\n\nstate and tribal jurisdiction is a matter of only a few dollars, the amount\n\nseparating a misdemeanor from a felony in the case of theft, for example. Similar\n\nproblems arise in determining whether an assault constitutes a misdemeanor\n\nsubject to tribal and federal jurisdiction or whether it constitutes a felony subject\n\nto state jurisdiction. In this situation, the interest of uniformity clearly supports\n\nmodification of Ute Indian Tribe III and creation of a uniform allocation of\n\njurisdiction. As the Third Circuit stated, “‘[U]niformity’ in application of\n\nprinciples and in decision-making might constitute a ‘special reason for disturbing\n\n[the] repose and finality . . . ’ of an earlier adjudication.” American Iron & Steel\n\nInst., 560 F.2d at 597 (quoting Greater Boston Television Corp., 463 F.2d at 278-\n\n79).\n\n       Although a uniform allocation of jurisdiction would eliminate the existing\n\nconfusion, we are mindful that “[f]inality must . . . delimit equality in a temporal\n\nsense, and we must accept as a fact that the argument for uniformity loses force\n\n\n                                         - 33 -\n\fover time.” James B. Beam Distilling Co., 501 U.S. at 542. As a limit on\n\nuniformity, finality is of particular importance where a change in law threatens to\n\ndisrupt a final tort award or other settled judgment based on then-existing legal\n\nprinciples. The need for finality, however, applies with less force to judgments\n\nthat are not “inherently final” but are rather of “a continuing nature.” American\n\nIron & Steel Inst., 560 F.2d at 599. Where a prior erroneous judgment necessarily\n\naffects continuing conduct, the interests of uniformity may demand departure\n\nfrom the prior judgment to bring a court’s view of the law into line with the\n\nprevailing view. See Federal Labor Relations Auth. v. United States Dep’t of\n\nTreasury, 884 F.2d 1446, 1456 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (concerning federal agencies’\n\nduty to disclose federal employees’ names and addresses to labor unions);\n\nAmerican Iron and Steel, 560 F.2d at 597-99 (concerning application of water\n\npollution regulations); Moch v. East Baton Rouge Parish School, 548 F.2d 594\n\n(5th Cir. 1977) (concerning apportionment of parish school board); Christian v.\n\nJemison, 303 F.2d 52, 54-55 (1962) (concerning prohibition of racial segregation\n\nafter abandonment of “separate but equal” doctrine); 18 W RIGHT ET AL ., § 4415,\n\nat 131 (stating that “ordinary . . . preclusion rules are often strained by continuing\n\nconduct”). The character of Ute Indian Tribe III reflects this type of judgment.\n\nAs the district court noted, the state and local defendants are not seeking “to\n\nunravel the intricate tapestry of individual judgments already made final each\n\n\n                                        - 34 -\n\ftime a new decision is announced.” Ute Indian Tribe IV, 935 F. Supp. at 1510.\n\nInstead, the defendants are seeking to apply Hagen prospectively to the continuing\n\nconduct of separate sovereigns and the individuals living in and around the Uintah\n\nValley Reservation. This case does not involve the retroactive application of\n\nHagen to events or lawsuits that have occurred in the past. To the extent that\n\nHagen threatens to displace a judgment “on which reliance may reasonably have\n\nbeen placed,” James B. Beam Distilling Co., 501 U.S. at 538, today’s decision is\n\nlimited to prospective application only. See United States v. Cuch, 79 F.3d 987,\n\n995 (10th Cir.) (rejecting the retroactive application of Hagen to vacate a federal\n\ncriminal conviction on collateral attack), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 384 (1996).\n\n      The Tribe raises one final argument against modification of Ute Indian\n\nTribe III. The Tribe contends that even if Ute Indian Tribe III does not continue\n\nto define the current boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation as between the\n\nState of Utah and criminal defendants under Hagen, the decision still should apply\n\nto legal relations between the state and local defendants and the Tribe. In effect,\n\nthe Tribe urges us to adopt a dual jurisdictional system. Under such a system, Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III would control the allocation of authority among the named parties\n\nto this lawsuit in their dealings with each other, while Hagen would apply to the\n\nstate and local defendants’ relationships with all other parties. The Tribe\n\ncontends that such a dual system is warranted because the state and local\n\n\n                                        - 35 -\n\fdefendants, as full participants in Ute Indian Tribe III, are directly bound by our\n\nen banc decision, while the Tribe, as a nonparty to the litigation in Hagen, is not\n\ndirectly bound by the Supreme Court’s decision. Accordingly, the Tribe contends\n\nthat the state and local defendants may properly assert jurisdiction over non-\n\nIndians within those portions of the original Uintah Valley Reservation that were\n\nopen to settlement under the 1902-1905 legislation (the Hagen-based\n\njurisdictional overlay). In their dealings with the Tribe and its members,\n\nhowever, the state and local defendants must recognize the authority of the Tribe\n\nand the federal government within those same portions of the Reservation (the\n\nUte Indian Tribe III-based overlay).\n\n      We reject the Tribe’s contention that jurisdiction must be allocated among\n\nthe parties by two inconsistent boundary determinations. The task of allocating\n\njurisdiction necessarily involves line-drawing, and in an area where there is a\n\ncompelling need for uniformity, there must be a single bright line. A dual system\n\nwould only continue the confusion that has characterized the relationship between\n\nthe parties since the issuance of Hagen. Under the Tribe’s approach, for example,\n\njurisdiction would depend not on the geographic locale of the crime or event at\n\nissue, but on the relationship between the State of Utah and the individual or\n\nentity over whom the State seeks to exercise jurisdiction. Rather than creating a\n\nstable allocation of jurisdiction where the parties’ respective jurisdictions can be\n\n\n                                        - 36 -\n\fdetermined by reference to lines on a map, the Tribe’s approach would introduce\n\nenormous uncertainty into an already complicated system. Each time the state and\n\nlocal defendants attempt to assert jurisdiction over a new party, whether to collect\n\na tax or enforce a regulation, they would risk having to establish jurisdiction over\n\nthat party through time-consuming and costly litigation. In addition, we question\n\nthe propriety of allocating jurisdiction based on the application of procedural\n\nrules (i.e., collateral estoppel and stare decisis) that were themselves designed to\n\neliminate inconsistency and unpredictability. Further, the legal basis for the\n\nTribe’s dual jurisdictional scheme is undermined by our conclusion that the state\n\nand local defendants are not directly bound by Ute Indian Tribe III, at least as that\n\ndecision conflicts with the contrary holding in Hagen.\n\n      For the reasons articulated above, we conclude that modification of our\n\nearlier judgment is appropriate, not merely because the two decisions are\n\nincongruent, but because of the effect of the incongruency on the interests of\n\nuniformity and the integrity of our system of judicial decisionmaking. We\n\ntherefore hold that the judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III should be modified in\n\nlight of the extraordinary circumstances presented in this case. To dispel any\n\ndoubts, we emphasize the rarity that should attend the use of this remedy.\n\n“Because this Court ordinarily will view motions to recall a mandate with\n\ndisfavor, the opinion in this matter should not be read as an invitation to litigants\n\n\n                                         - 37 -\n\fto seek review of already adjudicated claims.” American Iron & Steel Inst., 560\n\nF.2d at 599.\n\n          We do not, however, recall Ute Indian Tribe III in its entirety. To the\n\nextent that Ute Indian Tribe III decided matters not addressed in Hagen, finality\n\nrequires those decisions to remain undisturbed. Thus, we modify our earlier\n\njudgment only to the extent that it directly conflicts with the holding in Hagen.\n\nWe next address the extent to which the two cases are in direct conflict.\n\nIII.      J URISDICTIONAL B OUNDARIES A FTER H AGEN\n\n          In determining the parties’ respective jurisdictional boundaries after Hagen,\n\nwe begin by identifying the areas where Ute Indian Tribe III and Hagen are not in\n\nconflict and can be reconciled. To the extent that the boundary determinations\n\nmade in Ute Indian Tribe III do not directly conflict with Hagen, they remain in\n\neffect.\n\n          In Ute Indian Tribe IV, the 1996 district court opinion, the court fully\n\naddressed the areas of genuine conflict between Ute Indian Tribe III and Hagen.\n\nIn large part, we need look no further than the district court’s detailed opinion to\n\ndetermine those portions of the original Uintah Valley Reservation that remain the\n\nexclusive province of the Tribe and the federal government. See Ute Indian Tribe\n\nIV, 935 F. Supp. at 1485-1505. In sum, we agree with the district court that\n\nHagen did not effectively overrule the entire judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III,\n\n\n                                           - 38 -\n\fincluding our holdings concerning the National Forest Lands and the\n\nUncompahgre Reservation. Further, we agree that Hagen’s only effect was to\n\nreduce (and not terminate) the boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation to the\n\nextent that lands within the Reservation were unallotted, opened for settlement\n\nunder the 1902-1905 legislation, and not thereafter returned to tribal ownership.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that our prior judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III should be,\n\nand is now, modified to the extent that lands within the original reservation\n\nboundaries were unallotted, opened to non-Indian settlement under the 1902-1905\n\nlegislation, and not thereafter returned to tribal ownership. 5\n\n       A.     The Uintah Valley Reservation, The Uncompahgre Reservation,\n              and the National Forest Lands\n\n       In Ute Indian Tribe III, we decided three reservation diminishment issues.\n\nFirst, we concluded that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation did not have the\n\neffect of diminishing or disestablishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III, 773 F.2d at 1989. Second, we concluded that the withdrawal of\n\nthe National Forest Lands did not diminish the Uintah Valley Reservation. Id. at\n\n1090. Finally, we held that the 1894 and 1897 allotment legislation did not\n\ndiminish or disestablish the Uncompahgre Reservation. Id. at 1093.\n\n\n\n       5\n        Because we depart from a mandate of the en banc court and modify the earlier\njudgment in this case, we have circulated this opinion to the en banc court pursuant to our\nrules. Each member of the en banc court has concurred in our holding.\n\n                                           - 39 -\n\f      Hagen dealt only with the first of these three issues. As the district court\n\nstated:\n\n      Hagen determined “that the Uintah Indian Reservation has been\n      diminished by Congress,” i.e., that the original boundary of the\n      Uintah Valley Reservation does not currently define the present\n      territorial extent of federal, state and tribal jurisdiction in the Uintah\n      Basin.\n\nUte Indian Tribe IV, 935 F. Supp. at 1484 (citing Hagen, 510 U.S. at 419-21).\n\nThe district court continued:\n\n      Hagen [did not] address the Tenth Circuit’s determination in [Ute\n      Indian Tribe III] that the 1905 national forest withdrawals of\n      approximately 1,010,000 acres of reservation land did not diminish\n      the Uintah Reservation boundaries. Hagen also makes no ruling\n      concerning the boundaries of the Uncompahgre Reservation, the\n      original extent of which was reaffirmed by the Tenth Circuit.\n\nId. at 1485.\n\n      Although the state and local defendants admit that Hagen did not address\n\nthe status of the Uncompahgre Reservation or the National Forest Lands, they\n\nassert that we should nevertheless recall our entire mandate in Ute Indian Tribe\n\nIII. The defendants argue that Hagen effectively overruled the fundamental\n\npremise upon which the entire holding of Ute Indian Tribe III was based--namely,\n\nthat statutory restoration language is insufficient to infer diminishment. They\n\npoint out that in Hagen the Supreme Court stated that “restoration of unallotted\n\nreservation lands to the public domain evidences a congressional intent with\n\nrespect to those lands inconsistent with the continuation of reservation status.”\n\n                                         - 40 -\n\f510 U.S. at 414. The state and local defendants argue that in light of this\n\nstatement, Ute Indian Tribe III’s holding concerning the National Forest Lands\n\nand the Uncompahgre Reservation cannot stand because the entire holding was\n\nbased on a misreading of the same congressional restoration language that was at\n\nissue in Hagen.\n\n      Assuming that Ute Indian Tribe III’s holding with respect to the National\n\nForest Lands and the Uncompahgre Reservation was based on a misreading of the\n\napplicable legislation, such a misreading alone is not sufficient to justify\n\ndeparting from our earlier judgment. As we stated earlier, our decision to modify\n\nUte Indian Tribe III does not result from the desire to correct a prior erroneous\n\njudgment, but rather from the need to reconcile our decision with a directly\n\nconflicting decision of the Supreme Court. Because Hagen did not directly\n\naddress our holding in Ute Indian Tribe III as it relates to the National Forest\n\nLands and the Uncompahgre Reservation, we have no reason to depart from that\n\npart of our prior judgment. We thus reject the defendants’ contention that the\n\njudgment in Ute Indian Tribe III should be recalled in its entirety.\n\n      B.     Non-Trust Lands Within the Original Boundaries of the Uintah\n             Valley Reservation\n\n      Because we have concluded that Hagen did not address the status of the\n\nNational Forest Lands or the Uncompahgre Reservation, we must now address the\n\nextent to which Hagen directly conflicts with Ute Indian Tribe III. In particular,\n\n                                         - 41 -\n\fwe must decide which lands within the Uintah Valley Reservation are no longer\n\nIndian country after Hagen. The remaining controversy centers on whether the\n\nstate and local defendants or the Tribe and the federal government have\n\njurisdiction over the various categories of non-trust (i.e., fee), lands within the\n\noriginal boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation, whether held by Indians or\n\nnon-Indians.\n\n       Under 18 U.S.C. § 1151, the Tribe and the federal government have civil\n\nand criminal jurisdiction over “Indian country.” Pittsburg & Midway Coal\n\nMining Co. v. Watchman, 52 F.3d 1531, 1540-41 (10th Cir. 1995). Indian\n\ncountry includes “all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been\n\nextinguished.” 18 U.S.C. § 1151(c). This category constitutes lands held in trust\n\nby the federal government. Indian country also encompasses “all land within the\n\nlimits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States\n\nGovernment, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including\n\nrights-of-way running through the reservation.” 18 U.S.C. § 1151(a). Thus,\n\nIndian Country also includes all non-trust, or fee, lands so long as such lands are\n\nlocated within the “limits of any Indian reservation.”\n\n      There are four categories of non-trust lands at issue in this case:\n\n      (a) lands that passed from trust to fee status pursuant to non-Indian\n      settlement under the 1902-1905 allotment legislation;\n\n\n\n                                         - 42 -\n\f      (b) lands apportioned to the “Mixed Blood” Utes under the Ute\n      Partition Act, Act of Aug. 27, 1954, Pub. L. No. 97-698, ch. 1009, 68\n      Stat. 868 (codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 677-677aa);\n      (c) lands allotted to individual Indians that have passed into fee\n      status after 1905; and\n      (d) lands that were held in trust after the Reservation was opened in\n      1905 but that since have been exchanged into fee status by the Tribe\n      for then-fee (now trust) lands in an effort to consolidate its land\n      holdings pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act, Act of June 18,\n      1934, ch. 576, 48 Stat. 984 (codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 461-79) and the\n      Indian Land Consolidation Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 97-459, 96 Stat.\n      2517 (codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 2201-11).\n\nSee Ute Indian Tribe IV, 935 F. Supp. at 1484, 1486. In Ute Indian Tribe III, we\n\nheld that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation did not have the effect of\n\ndiminishing or disestablishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. We thus concluded\n\nthat all of the non-trust lands identified above remained “Indian country” under\n\n§ 1151(a) as lands within “the limits of any Indian reservation.” In this case, we\n\nmust determine the extent to which Hagen directly conflicts with our earlier\n\nconclusion that all of the above categories of non-trust lands remain within Indian\n\ncountry.\n\n      The parties do not dispute that Hagen directly conflicts with the first\n\ncategory of non-trust lands, those lands passing in fee to non-Indians pursuant to\n\nthe 1902-1905 allotment legislation. This was precisely the category of fee lands\n\nat issue in Hagen. Accordingly, we modify our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III\n\nand hold in accordance with Hagen that these lands are no longer within Indian\n\n\n\n                                        - 43 -\n\fcountry under section 1151(a) subject to the jurisdiction of the Tribe and the\n\nfederal government.\n\n      With respect to the other three categories of non-trust lands, the state and\n\nlocal defendants argue that these lands also are no longer within Indian country\n\nafter Hagen. They contend that the Supreme Court in Hagen “clearly\n\ncontemplated that the exterior boundaries of the Reservation would simply be\n\ngone.” Appt. Brief, at 44. In other words, the defendants argue that the Court\n\nheld that the 1902-1905 legislation completely terminated the Reservation such\n\nthat no discrete, definable reservation boundaries now exist. Under the\n\ndefendants’ theory, there are no external boundaries and thus no “limits of any\n\nreservation.” Indian country therefore is confined under § 1151(c) to “Indian\n\nallotments . . . which have not been extinguished,” or trust lands. Under the\n\ntheory that Indian country is limited to trust lands, the defendants argue that the\n\nthree disputed categories of non-trust lands no longer constitute Indian country.\n\n      We reject the defendants’ argument that Hagen removed all non-trust lands\n\nwithin the original Uintah Valley Reservation from Indian country. In Hagen, the\n\nSupreme Court did not decide that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation completely\n\ndisestablished the Uintah Valley Reservation, erasing its outer boundaries and\n\nrendering § 1151(a) inapplicable to the three disputed categories of non-trust\n\nlands. The Court in Hagen stated:\n\n\n                                         - 44 -\n\f      [W]e hold that the restoration of unallotted reservation lands to the\n      public domain evidences a congressional intent with respect to those\n      lands inconsistent with the continuation of reservation status. Thus,\n      the existence of such language in the operative section of a surplus\n      land Act indicates that the Act diminished the reservation.\n\nHagen, 510 U.S. at 414 (emphasis added). The Court stated that the Uintah\n\nValley Reservation had been “diminished” -- not “disestablished,” “eliminated,”\n\nor “terminated.” Moreover, the diminishment was only “with respect to those\n\nlands” that had been restored to the public domain under the 1902-1905\n\nlegislation. See Ute Indian Tribe IV, 935 F. Supp. at 1487-88. We therefore\n\nconclude that Hagen did not erase the boundaries of the Uintah Valley\n\nReservation and that the current “limits of [the] reservation” thus embrace the\n\nthree categories of non-trust lands at issue. In sum, Hagen does not conflict with\n\nour holding in Ute Indian Tribe III that these categories of non-trust lands remain\n\nwithin Indian country under section 1151(a).\n\n      We note that this conclusion has the benefit of producing a stable,\n\nunchanging allocation of jurisdiction. Under our approach, the Tribe and the\n\nfederal government retain jurisdiction over all trust lands, the National Forest\n\nLands, the Uncompahgre Reservation, and the three categories of non-trust lands\n\nthat remain within the boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation. The state\n\nand local defendants have jurisdiction over the fee lands removed from the\n\nReservation under the 1902-1905 allotment legislation. Although a title search\n\n\n                                        - 45 -\n\fmay be necessary to determine which lands were opened under the 1902-1905\n\nlegislation, the parties’ respective jurisdictions will never change once the status\n\nof those lands is conclusively determined. By contrast, under the defendants’\n\ntheory (i.e., that Indian country is limited to trust lands) the Indian country status\n\nof land would change as trust lands are transferred into fee lands. We recognize\n\nthat while our approach might result in a checkerboard allocation of jurisdiction,\n\nsuch a result is more desirable than the defendants’ approach, which would\n\nproduce a “moving checkerboard” because lands leaving trust status would also\n\nlose their status as Indian country.\n\n       In conclusion, we reject the argument that Indian country is confined to\n\nlands held in trust by the federal government under § 1151(c). Rather, Indian\n\ncountry extends to all trust lands, the National Forest Lands, the Uncompahgre\n\nReservation, and the three disputed categories of non-trust lands discussed\n\nabove. 6\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the defendants’ motion to recall our\n\nmandate in Ute Indian Tribe III, 773 F.2d 1087 (10th Cir. 1985) (en banc), cert.\n\n\n\n       6\n         We decline to address whether any portion of the non-trust lands opened in 1905\nmight still constitute Indian country under section 1151(b) as a “dependent Indian\ncommunity” because that question is not properly before the court. The district court may\nbe asked to consider the question upon remand.\n\n                                          - 46 -\n\fdenied, 479 U.S. 994 (1986).

Notwithstanding Hagen, the district court held that it was bound\n\nunder the “law of the case” doctrine to follow our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe\n\nand thus, that it was without authority to alter the existing jurisdictional\n\nboundaries as set forth in Ute Indian Tribe. In light of the inconsistency between\n\nUte Indian Tribe and Hagen, however, the district court requested that we issue\n\ninstructions on how to proceed and suggested that we construe the request as an\n\ninvitation to recall our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe.\n\n      The state and local defendants appeal, arguing that (1) our en banc decision\n\nin Ute Indian Tribe does not preclude their exercise of jurisdiction over former\n\nreservation lands under the doctrines of law of the case, collateral estoppel, or res\n\njudicata and (2) Hagen effectively overruled Ute Indian Tribe, permitting the\n\ndefendants to exercise jurisdiction over all the lands originally held to be within\n\nreservation boundaries. Along with their appeal, the state and local defendants\n\nhave filed a motion to recall, in its entirety, our mandate issued pursuant to Ute\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fIndian Tribe.

We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

In this appeal, we decide whether to modify our judgment in Ute Indian\n\nTribe, after the time for rehearing has passed, in light of its conflict with a later,\n\ncontrary decision of the Supreme Court.\n\nII.   U TE I NDIAN T RIBE I-III: T HE D ISTRICT C OURT , P ANEL , AND E N B ANC\n      O PINIONS\n\n      In 1975, the Tribe sought to exercise jurisdiction over all of the land\n\noriginally encompassed in the Uintah Valley Reservation pursuant to the Tribe’s\n\nnewly enacted Law and Order Code. When non-Indians living in and around\n\nseveral towns within the original boundaries protested the action, the Tribe sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief in federal court to establish the exterior\n\n                                          -5-\n\fboundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation and to restrain the state and local\n\ndefendants from interfering with enforcement of the Law and Order Code within\n\nthose boundaries. The Tribe argued that the original boundaries of the Uintah\n\nValley Reservation, established by executive order in 1861 and confirmed by\n\nCongress in 1864, continued to exist undiminished. The Tribe thus argued that it\n\nhad jurisdiction over all of the lands encompassed within the original boundaries\n\nof the Reservation because such lands were “Indian country” as defined by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1151.\n\n      On the other hand, the state and local defendants argued that congressional\n\nenactments from 1902 through 1905, opening Reservation lands to non-Indian\n\nsettlement and setting aside lands for a national forest reserve, had the effect of\n\ndiminishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. The defendants also argued that\n\ncongressional enactments from 1894 to 1897 had the effect of completely\n\ndisestablishing the Tribe’s Uncompahgre Reservation.\n\n      In addressing the parties arguments, the district court gave a comprehensive\n\nsummary of the relevant legislation, legislative history, contemporaneous\n\ninterpretations by the executive branch, and other circumstances surrounding the\n\nenactment of the legislation. We therefore only briefly summarize the legislative\n\ntreatment of the lands below.\n\n      A.     Legislative Treatment of Reservation Lands\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f            1.      The Uintah Valley Reservation\n\n      In 1902, Congress passed legislation directing the Secretary of the Interior\n\nto make individual allotments out of the Uintah Valley Reservation by October 1,\n\n1903, provided that a majority of the adult male members of the Ute Indians\n\nconsented. Act of May 27, 1902, ch. 888, 32 Stat. 263, 263-64 (“1902 Act”).\n\nThe 1902 Act stated that after October 1, 1903, “all the unallotted lands within\n\nsaid reservation shall be restored to the public domain” and subject to entry by\n\nnon-Indians under the homestead laws. Id. (emphasis added). Congress delayed\n\nthe allotment process, however, and extended the opening date in 1903 and again\n\nin 1904. Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 994, 32 Stat. 982, 997-98; Act of Apr. 21,\n\n1904, ch. 1402, 33 Stat. 189, 207-08. In 1905, Congress extended the opening\n\ndate a third time--to September 1, 1905--and directed the Secretary to allot the\n\nReservation unilaterally if the Tribe’s consent was not obtained. Act of Mar. 3,\n\n1905, ch. 1479, 33 Stat. 1048, 1069-70 (“1905 Act”). The 1905 Act did not\n\ncontain the same language restoring the unallotted and unreserved lands to the\n\n“public domain,” but provided that such lands “shall be disposed of under the\n\ngeneral provisions of the homestead and townsite laws of the United States.” Id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f2.   The National Forest Lands\n\n\n\n\n                      -8-\n\f      In addition to extending the time of entry under the 1902 Act and\n\ndescribing the entry process, the 1905 Act authorized the President to “set apart\n\nand reserve” lands in the Reservation as a forest reserve prior to opening. 33\n\nStat. 1070. Pursuant to this power, on July 14, 1905, President Theodore\n\nRoosevelt issued a proclamation designating some 1,010,000 acres within the\n\nUintah Valley Reservation as an addition to the Uintah National Forest Reserve.\n\nProclamation of July 14, 1905, 34 Stat. 3113, 3116. The proclamation also\n\ndeclared that the unallotted lands in the Uintah Valley Reservation, which were\n\nnot otherwise reserved, would “be opened to entry, settlement and disposition\n\nunder the general provisions of the homestead and townsite laws.” Id. at 3120.\n\n             3.     The Uncompahgre Reservation\n\n      In 1894, Congress passed legislation providing for the allotment of the\n\nUncompahgre Reservation to individual members of the Tribe. The legislation\n\nstated that all unallotted lands “shall . . . be restored to the public domain and\n\nmade subject to entry” under the homestead and mineral laws. Act of Aug. 15,\n\n1894, ch. 290, 28 Stat. 286, 337-38 (emphasis added). The allotment process,\n\nhowever, was delayed, and in 1897, Congress passed legislation mandating the\n\nallotment of the Uncompahgre Reservation and opening the unallotted lands to\n\nentry. Act of June 7, 1897, ch. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 87.\n\n      B.     Ute Indian Tribe I: 1981 District Court Opinion\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      In 1981, the district court issued Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1665107\"><a href=\"/opinion/1665107/ute-indian-tribe-v-state-of-utah/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1072</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Utah 1981) (hereinafter “Ute Indian Tribe I”). The district court held\n\nthat Congress’s decision to open the unallotted lands to settlement did not\n\ndiminish the Reservation’s boundaries. Id. at 1132. The court recognized that the\n\nlanguage of the 1902 Act directing that all unallotted lands “be restored to the\n\npublic domain” would have diminished the Reservation had the unallotted lands\n\nthen been opened for settlement. Id. at 1122. The court concluded, however, that\n\nthe 1905 Act superseded the 1902 Act. Id. Unlike the 1902 Act, the 1905 Act\n\nprovided only that the unallotted lands were to “be disposed of under” the\n\nhomestead and township laws. Id. at 1132. The district court reasoned that the\n\nnew language indicated that Congress did not intend to diminish the Reservation.\n\nId. The district court therefore concluded that the unallotted lands remained part\n\nof the Uintah Valley Reservation. Id.\n\n      The district court reached a different conclusion on the status of the\n\nNational Forest Lands and the Uncompahgre Reservation. Regarding the National\n\nForest Lands, the court concluded that the language in the 1905 Act empowering\n\nthe president to “set apart and reserve” timber lands for a national forest\n\ndemonstrated Congress’s clear intent to diminish the Uintah Valley Reservation.\n\nId. at 1136. Likewise, the district court concluded that the language in the 1894\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fAct restoring unallotted reservation lands “to the public domain” showed a clear\n\ncongressional intent to disestablish the Uncompahgre Reservation. Id. at 1106.\n\n      C.    Ute Indian Tribe II: The 1983 Court of Appeals Panel Decision\n\n      In a two-judge majority opinion, a panel of this court affirmed the district\n\ncourt opinion in part and reversed in part. Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424738\"><a href=\"/opinion/424738/the-ute-indian-tribe-plaintiffappellantcross-appellee-v-state-of-utah/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1983) (hereinafter “Ute Indian Tribe II”). The panel held that\n\nnone of the lands in question remained within the original reservation boundaries.\n\n      The panel agreed with the district court that the 1902 Act’s language\n\nrestoring the unallotted lands “to the public domain” was sufficient to diminish\n\nthe Uintah Valley Reservation. Id. at 1308-09. Unlike the district court,\n\nhowever, the panel concluded that the 1905 Act did not supersede Congress’s\n\nintent to diminish the Reservation under the 1902 Act. Id. at 1311. Thus, the\n\npanel held that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation had diminished the Uintah\n\nValley Reservation. Id. at 1311-12.\n\n      The panel agreed with the district court’s conclusions regarding the\n\nNational Forest Lands and the Uncompahgre Reservation. The panel concluded\n\nthat Congress intended to withdraw the National Forest Lands, id. at 1314, and\n\nthe Uncompahgre Reservation, id. at 1307, from their original reservation status.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 11 -\n\f        D.    Ute Indian Tribe III: The 1985 Court of Appeals En Banc\n              Decision\n\n        On rehearing en banc, a majority of the court held that all of the lands at\n\nissue retained their reservation status. Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458771\"><a href=\"/opinion/458771/the-ute-indian-tribe-and-cross-appellee-v-the-state-of-utah-duchesne/\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1093 (10th Cir. 1985) (en banc) (hereinafter “Ute Indian Tribe III”). The en banc\n\ncourt concluded that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation did not have the effect\n\nof diminishing or disestablishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. Id. at 1089.\n\nSimilarly, the court held that the withdrawal of the National Forest Lands did not\n\ndiminish the Uintah Valley Reservation, id. at 1090, and that the 1894 and 1897\n\nallotment legislation did not disestablish the Uncompahgre Reservation. Id. at\n\n1093.\n\n        In reaching a holding completely contrary to the panel, the en banc court\n\nrelied on the newly-decided case of Solem v. Bartlett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111106\"><a href=\"/opinion/111106/solem-v-bartlett/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). The\n\ncourt concluded that under Solem, congressional language restoring reservation\n\nlands to the public domain “is not the same as a congressional state of mind to\n\ndiminish,” and hence “does not reliably establish the clear and unequivocal\n\nevidence of Congress’ intent to change the boundaries.” Ute Indian Tribe III, 773\n\nF.2d at 1092.

The cases arose\n\nas a result of state felony prosecutions against three Indians for crimes committed\n\nin Myton and Roosevelt, Utah, two towns within the original boundaries of the\n\nUintah Valley Reservation. The defendants challenged the prosecutions on the\n\nbasis that the state trial court lacked jurisdiction over their crimes because the\n\ndefendants committed their crimes in “Indian country” as defined by 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1151(a). The defendants argued that under our en banc decision in Ute Indian\n\nTribe III, the towns remained within the Reservation and thus within Indian\n\ncountry. The State of Utah, on the other hand, argued that our holding in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III was wrong, that the Reservation had been diminished, and that\n\nthe towns were outside the Reservation and thus outside Indian country. The\n\nUtah Supreme Court agreed with the State, and held that because the Reservation\n\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\fhad been diminished, the state trial court properly exercised criminal jurisdiction\n\nover the defendants.

See id. at 410-21. The Court’s analysis, however,\n\nwas limited to the status of the unallotted Uintah Valley Reservation lands opened\n\nto settlement under the 1902-1905 allotment legislation. See id. The Court did\n\nnot address the National Forest Lands or the Uncompahgre Reservation, neither of\n\nwhich was before the Court for consideration. After looking to the three\n\ndiminishment factors, the Court concluded that Congress’s “baseline intent to\n\ndiminish the Reservation expressed in the 1902 Act survived the passage of the\n\n1905 Act,” id. at 415, and that the “[c]ontemporary historical evidence supports\n\n[the] conclusion that Congress intended to diminish the Uintah Reservation.” Id.\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fat 416.

Ute Indian Tribe IV: The 1996 District Court Decision\n\n      Immediately after the Utah Supreme Court issued its slip opinions in the\n\nstate criminal cases, the Tribe filed a motion in federal district court seeking a\n\npermanent injunction preventing the state and local defendants from enforcing or\n\nrelying upon Perank, Coando, and Hagen in any way. On August 31, 1992, the\n\nstate and local defendants and the Tribe entered into a stipulation, under which\n\nthe state and local defendants agreed to refrain from enforcing the Utah Supreme\n\nCourt decision in Perank or exercising jurisdiction in any manner inconsistent\n\nwith the en banc decision in Ute Indian Tribe III, pending a decision on the merits\n\nin the district court. The district court incorporated the stipulation into an order\n\ndated September 2, 1992 (“Injunction Order”).\n\n      In 1993, after the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Hagen, the district\n\ncourt stayed further proceedings on the Tribe’s motion pending the outcome of\n\nHagen in the Supreme Court. On February 23, 1994, the Supreme Court issued its\n\ndecision in Hagen. On April 24, 1994, the state and local defendants filed a\n\nmotion to vacate and set aside the Injunction Order and to dismiss the Tribe’s\n\nmotion for permanent injunctive relief.\n\n\n                                          - 15 -\n\f       On May 2, 1994, the district court modified the Injunction Order “to allow\n\nthe [s]tate and [l]ocal [d]efendants to prosecute felony crimes occurring on lands\n\nwithin the original boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation which are not\n\n‘Indian country’ as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1151, et seq.” The court emphasized\n\nthat it was “not determining one way or another which lands may or may not\n\nconstitute ‘Indian country.’” 1\n\n       On April 2, 1996, the district court issued Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, 935 F.\n\nSupp. 1473 (D. Utah 1996) (“Ute Indian Tribe IV”). In a comprehensive and\n\ndetailed opinion, the district court fully addressed the binding effect, as between\n\nthe parties, of our earlier en banc decision in Ute Indian Tribe III, as well as the\n\nextent of direct conflict between Ute Indian Tribe III and Hagen. Id. at 1484-\n\n1516. Rather than finally deciding these issues, however, the district court held\n\nthat it was bound under “law of the case” rules to enforce the mandate in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III. Id. at 1516-25. Thus, the district court did not reach the merits\n\nof the Tribe’s request for permanent injunctive relief. Id.

The court also concluded that the\n\nInjunction Order, as modified, should remain in effect to allow the state and local\n\ndefendants to prosecute criminal felonies occurring on former Uintah Valley\n\nReservation lands. Id. at 1531. This appeal followed.\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\nI.    I NTRODUCTION\n\n      On appeal, the Tribe maintains that principles of finality require the district\n\ncourt to enjoin permanently the state and local defendants from exercising\n\njurisdiction in a manner inconsistent with Ute Indian Tribe III. On the other\n\nhand, the state and local defendants argue that we should give effect to the\n\ncontrary boundary determination in Hagen by recalling the mandate in Ute Indian\n\nTribe III in its entirety and reinstating the original Tenth Circuit panel opinion.\n\nThe United States as amicus curiae urges us to recall and modify the mandate in\n\nUte Indian Tribe III only to the extent that it directly conflicts with Hagen.\n\n      In resolving this dispute, we follow a three-part framework. First, we\n\ndecide whether the district court was bound to follow the mandate in Ute Indian\n\nTribe III by continuing the Injunction Order. After concluding that the district\n\ncourt properly followed our mandate, we nevertheless decide whether to modify\n\nUte Indian Tribe III in light of the inconsistent boundary determination in Hagen.\n\nFinally, after concluding that Ute Indian Tribe III should be modified, we decide\n\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\fwhether to recall our mandate in its entirety or modify our en banc opinion only to\n\nthe extent that it directly conflicts with Hagen. Because of the importance of\n\nfinality, we conclude that Ute Indian Tribe III should be modified only to the\n\nextent that it conflicts with Hagen.\n\nII.   T HE B INDING E FFECT OF U TE I NDIAN T RIBE III\n\n      We begin by determining the binding effect of Ute Indian Tribe III on the\n\nallocation of jurisdiction among the federal government, the Tribe, and the state\n\nand local defendants. Whether the district court was bound by the mandate in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III to continue the Injunction Order, and whether this court is bound\n\nby principles of finality to enforce our prior boundary determination, are separate\n\ninquiries. We address each question in turn.\n\n      A.     The Mandate Rule\n\n      The state and local defendants first contend that the district court erred in\n\nholding that it was bound by Ute Indian Tribe III to continue to enjoin their\n\nexercise of civil and non-felony jurisdiction despite the Supreme Court’s decision\n\nin Hagen. We review the district court’s decision to continue an injunction for an\n\nabuse of discretion, examining “whether the district court committed an error of\n\nlaw or relied on clearly erroneous fact findings.” Walmer v.

In this case,\n\nthe district court concluded that the mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III remained in\n\neffect and therefore ruled that it was bound to follow the mandate by continuing\n\nto enjoin the defendants’ exercise of jurisdiction.\n\n      The state and local defendants contend that the district court is not bound\n\nby the mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III because of an intervening change in\n\ncontrolling law, an exception to the mandate rule. See Pittsburg & Midway Coal\n\nMining Co. v. Watchman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694609\"><a href=\"/opinion/694609/pittsburg-midway-coal-mining-company-v-derrick-watchman-victor-joe-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1536 n.4 (10th Cir. 1995). The\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fdefendants maintain that because Hagen was “intervening” (i.e., coming after Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III but before the Tribe’s present motion for injunctive relief), the\n\ndistrict court should have departed from the appellate mandate and followed the\n\nboundary determination in Hagen. The defendants contend that the district court,\n\nby failing to do so, wrongfully continued to enjoin their exercise of jurisdiction\n\npursuant to Hagen.\n\n      The argument of the state and local defendants is without merit. In short,\n\nthe intervening-change-in-law exception does not apply where, as here, the case\n\nin which the erroneous ruling occurred is no longer sub judice--that is, where the\n\ncase has become final. See Colorado Interstate Gas, 962 F.2d at 1534 (holding\n\nthat once an appellate court resolves an issue and remands the case to enter\n\njudgment in accordance with the mandate, the district court may not disregard the\n\nmandate and apply a later change in law on remand because the question is no\n\nlonger sub judice); Collins v.

Our ruling left nothing for the district court to\n\naddress beyond the “ministerial dictates of the mandate.” Colorado Interstate Gas\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fCo., 962 F.2d at 1534. In other words, the case was no longer sub judice after\n\nDecember 9, 1986. As of that date, the district court was without authority to\n\ndepart from an appellate mandate based on a later change in law. Because Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III proceeded to a final decision, a later change in law could not\n\n“reopen the door already closed.” James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112634\"><a href=\"/opinion/112634/james-b-beam-distilling-co-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541 (1991). Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly\n\nfollowed our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III by continuing to enjoin the state and\n\nlocal defendants from exercising jurisdiction pursuant to Hagen.\n\n      B.     Modification of Ute Indian Tribe III\n\n      Although the district court did not err in holding that it was bound by Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III, we nevertheless must decide whether to modify our judgment in\n\nUte Indian Tribe III in light of the Supreme Court’s inconsistent boundary\n\ndetermination in Hagen. The question whether to modify our earlier judgment\n\nraises competing concerns involving the finality of a court’s judgment and the\n\nneed for uniformity in decisionmaking throughout the federal court system. In\n\ndeciding this question, we first discuss whether an appellate court has the power\n\nto modify a mandate and the circumstances in which exercise of that power is\n\nappropriate. With these circumstances in mind, we next determine whether we\n\nare precluded by the principles of collateral estoppel or res judicata from\n\ndeparting from the boundary determination of Ute Indian Tribe III. Finally, after\n\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\fconcluding that we are not bound by the traditional principles of finality, we\n\ndirectly confront the relative importance of finality and uniformity in the context\n\nof this case.\n\n                1.   The Power of an Appellate Court to Modify a Mandate\n\n       The defendants’ motion to recall the mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III\n\nrequires us first to ask whether an appellate court possesses the authority to recall\n\nor modify a mandate after the time for rehearing has passed. In this circuit, as in\n\nall circuits that have addressed the issue, “an appellate court has power to set\n\naside at any time a mandate that was procured by fraud or act to prevent an\n\ninjustice, or to preserve the integrity of the judicial process.” Coleman v.

See\n\nAmerican Iron & Steel Inst., 560 F.2d at 594 (emphasizing that recall of a\n\nmandate is “an extraordinary remedy, one to be used sparingly”). 2 The limited\n\n\n       2\n        Indeed, we have found only one case in which we have departed from a prior\nmandate after a final decision because of a later change in law.

As the Third\n\nCircuit explained, “[P]arties should be afforded ample opportunity to litigate their\n\nclaims, but once a final disposition is reached they should not expect that the\n\ngood offices of the court will be available for a chance to press their claims\n\nanew.” Id. at 592. Mindful of the important limitations on an appellate court’s\n\npower to disrupt a settled judgment, we next address whether we are precluded\n\nfrom modifying the mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III under the principles of\n\ncollateral estoppel or res judicata .\n\n              2.     Collateral Estoppel and Res Judicata\n\n       In seeking permanent injunctive relief against the state and local\n\ndefendants, the Tribe contends that collateral estoppel and res judicata preclude\n\nthe state and local defendants from relying on Hagen. In particular, the Tribe\n\nargues that the Court should enjoin the defendants’ enforcement of Hagen under\n\nthe relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2283, 3 which\n\n\nwhere plaintiffs with claims under state law were forced to litigate in federal court\nbecause of diversity and received “substantially different treatment than that [later]\nreceived in state court by another injured in the same accident.” Id. at 723. Pierce was an\n“extraordinary case” based on an “unusual combination of events” and is not applicable to\nthe case before us today. Id.\n       3\n          Section 2283 provides: “A court of the United States may not grant an injunction\nto stay proceedings in a State Court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or\n\n                                          - 23 -\n\fpermits a federal court to enjoin proceedings in state court where the party\n\nasserting a claim or issue in the state court is barred from doing so by res judicata\n\nor collateral estoppel.

The Tribe argues that because Ute Indian Tribe III\n\nproduced a final judgment on the merits (thereby resolving the boundary issue in\n\nfavor of the Tribe), the doctrine of collateral estoppel binds this court and\n\nprecludes the defendants from enforcing the contrary holding in Hagen. The\n\nTribe maintains that the Supreme Court’s decision in Federated Department\n\nStores, Inc. v.

In Federated Department Stores, 452 U.S. at 398, the Supreme Court\n\nrejected an attempt by the Ninth Circuit to craft an exception to the doctrine of\n\nres judicata based on a later change in controlling law. The case involved seven\n\nretail purchasers who brought separate actions against the owners of various\n\n\n\nwhere necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.”\n\n                                            - 24 -\n\fdepartment stores, alleging that the stores had engaged in illegal price fixing. Id.\n\nat 395-96. After the district court dismissed the actions on the grounds that the\n\nplaintiffs had failed to state a claim for relief under the applicable statute, five of\n\nthe plaintiffs appealed the ruling and, ultimately, obtained a reversal by the\n\nSupreme Court. Id. at 396. Instead of appealing the district court’s ruling as the\n\nother five plaintiffs had done, two plaintiffs refiled their actions in state court,\n\nwhich were removed to federal court. Id. The federal district court held that\n\nbecause the two plaintiffs sought to relitigate the same claim against the same\n\ndefendants, the actions had to be dismissed under the doctrine of res judicata. Id.\n\nat 396-97.\n\n      The two plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit. Id. at 397. While their\n\nappeal was pending, the Supreme Court announced that the other plaintiffs had\n\nstated a claim for relief. Id. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the two plaintiffs\n\nshould be allowed to benefit from the Supreme Court’s decision because their\n\nposition was closely interwoven with the other five cases. Id. The court stated\n\nthat because all of the dismissals rested on precedent that the Supreme Court had\n\nsince overruled, the doctrine of res judicata must give way to the competing\n\nconcerns of “public policy” and “simple justice.” Id. at 398.\n\n      In reversing, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the Ninth Circuit’s\n\n“novel exception to the doctrine of res judicata.” Id. The Court explained:\n\n\n                                          - 25 -\n\f      [W]e do not see the grave injustice which would be done by the\n      application of accepted principles of res judicata. . . . The doctrine of\n      res judicata serves vital public interests beyond any individual\n      judge’s ad hoc determination of the equities of a particular case.\n      There is simply no principle of law or equity which sanctions the\n      rejection by a federal court of the salutary principle of res judicata\n      . . . . This Court has long recognized that [p]ublic policy dictates that\n      there be an end of litigation; that those who have contested an issue\n      shall be bound by the result of the contest, and that matters once tried\n      shall be considered forever settled as between the parties.\n\nId. at 401 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Contrary to the Tribe’s argument, our case is distinguishable from\n\nFederated Department Stores in two important respects. First, in contrast to\n\nFederated Department Stores, where the issue was whether a change in law would\n\npermit the incipient relitigation of an issue resolved in a prior suit, the State of\n\nUtah in this case has already relitigated the boundary issue. We are not now\n\ndeciding whether a party--in this case the State--deserves a second bite at the\n\napple. The boundary relitigation is over. The Utah Supreme Court has issued a\n\nfinal ruling, which the United States Supreme Court has affirmed, resulting in a\n\nclearly inconsistent judgment. For this reason, the Tribe’s reliance on collateral\n\nestoppel is misplaced.\n\n      Second, in deciding whether to modify Ute Indian Tribe III, we are not\n\nmotivated by a desire to achieve a more accurate judgment or to avoid the\n\ninjustice that might result from a strict application of the principles of finality, as\n\nwas the case in Federated Department Stores. The fact that Ute Indian Tribe III\n\n                                          - 26 -\n\fmay have been wrongly decided or operates unfairly against the state and local\n\ndefendants is not a concern that informs our analysis. See 18 C HARLES A.\n\nW RIGHT ET AL ., F EDERAL P RACTICE AND P ROCEDURE § 4426, at 265 (1981) (“If\n\nrelitigation were permitted whenever it might result in a more accurate\n\ndetermination, in the name of ‘justice,’ the very values served by preclusion\n\nwould be quickly destroyed.”). Rather, our decision is based on the need to\n\nreconcile two inconsistent boundary determinations and to provide a uniform\n\nallocation of jurisdiction among separate sovereigns. For this reason, Federated\n\nDepartment Store’s relevance to this case is limited. The question here is not\n\nwhether the State of Utah should be able to relitigate the boundary issue (which it\n\nhas already done), but which decision--Ute Indian Tribe III or Hagen--should\n\ncontrol the allocation of jurisdiction among the state and local defendants, the\n\nTribe, and the federal government. The State’s successful relitigation of the\n\nboundary issue has put the judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III on a collision course\n\nwith Hagen, and therefore, we must directly confront whether Ute Indian Tribe III\n\nshould give way to the equally final, contrary judgment in Hagen. To that\n\ninquiry, we now turn.\n\n             3.    Finality and Uniformity\n\n      As discussed above, the question whether to modify our judgment in Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III raises the competing concerns of finality and uniformity. Thus,\n\n\n                                       - 27 -\n\fin deciding this question, we must assess the relative importance of finality and\n\nuniformity in the context of this case.\n\n      Although we are not bound by collateral estoppel to enforce the boundary\n\ndetermination of Ute Indian Tribe III, departure from this settled judgment\n\nimplicates the important purposes of finality. Over a century ago, the Supreme\n\nCourt discussed the importance of finality:\n\n      This general rule is demanded by the very object for which civil\n      courts have been established, which is to secure the peace and repose\n      of society by the settlement of matters capable of judicial\n      determination. Its enforcement is essential to the maintenance of\n      social order; for the aid of judicial tribunals would not be invoked\n      for the vindication of rights of person and property if, as between\n      parties and their privies, conclusiveness did not attend the judgments\n      of such tribunals in respect of all matters properly put in issue, and\n      actually determined by them.\n\nSouthern Pac.

Accordingly, before\n\ndeparting from a settled decision, we must consider whether such departure might\n\n“substantially frustrate [collateral estoppel’s] purpose of protecting litigants from\n\n\n                                          - 28 -\n\fburdensome relitigation and of promoting judicial economy.” United States v.\n\nStauffer Chem.

The litigation that led to Ute Indian\n\nTribe III lasted ten years and resulted in a costly victory for the Tribe. It also\n\nconsumed important judicial resources. Perhaps most important from the Tribe’s\n\npoint of view, the decision in Ute Indian Tribe III purported to define\n\nconclusively the respective jurisdictional boundaries of the various governmental\n\nauthorities operating in and around the Uintah Valley Reservation. Indeed, the\n\nTribe continues to rely on Ute Indian Tribe III in exercising civil and non-felony\n\njurisdiction on lands within the original reservation boundaries. “When a court\n\nhas determined disestablishment of a given reservation in its particular historical\n\nand factual setting, prevention of inconsistent adjudication becomes desirable\n\ninsofar as it fosters reliance on judicial decision making.” White Earth Band of\n\nChippewa Indians v. Alexander, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406485\"><a href=\"/opinion/406485/white-earth-band-of-chippewa-indians-v-joseph-n-alexander-individually/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1135 (8th Cir. 1982). The Tribe\n\nargues that this reasoning, as well as the other important purposes of finality,\n\nsupport enforcement of the settled judgment of Ute Indian Tribe III.\n\n      The same important purposes of finality, however, apply equally to the final\n\njudgment in Hagen. Once Hagen became final, the State of Utah was entitled to\n\n\n                                         - 29 -\n\frely on the collateral estoppel effect of that judgment just as the Tribe was\n\nentitled to rely on its judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III. Had the Tribe brought its\n\npresent request for injunctive relief prior to the conclusion of the state litigation\n\nin Hagen, the principle of finality clearly would have favored the Tribe and might\n\neven have required an injunction against the state proceedings. See Parsons Steel,\n\nInc. v. First Ala. Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111563\"><a href=\"/opinion/111563/parsons-steel-inc-v-first-alabama-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524 (1986) (holding that the relitigation\n\nexception to the Anti-Injunction Act does not permit a federal court to enjoin a\n\nstate court proceeding “once the state court has finally rejected a claim of res\n\njudicata”). In this situation, however, where the State has already relitigated the\n\nboundary issue, the economy and judicial resource concerns that normally operate\n\nto preclude a second lawsuit are of little relevance. Although the Tribe may have\n\na more forceful reliance interest given the length of time Ute Indian Tribe III has\n\nremained in effect, enjoining the state and local defendants in this situation would\n\ndo little to further the core purposes of finality. As discussed above, the second\n\nlitigation has proceeded to a final judgment and has already resulted in an\n\ninconsistent decision.\n\n      Moreover, we note that “res judicata and collateral estoppel . . . promote\n\nthe comity between state and federal courts that has been recognized as a bulwark\n\nof the federal system.” Allen v. McCurry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95-96 (1980). Thus,\n\nenjoining the State’s enforcement of Hagen in this situation would “violate basic\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\ftenets of comity and federalism.” Kremer, 456 U.S. at 478. By reaching the\n\nmerits in Hagen, the Utah Supreme Court effectively ruled that the State was not\n\nprecluded from relitigating the boundary issue. In the absence of a successful\n\nchallenge to this ruling in the Supreme Court, we must give full effect to the state\n\ncourt judgment and may not impose “the highly intrusive remedy of a federal-\n\ncourt injunction against the enforcement of the state court judgment.” Parsons\n\nSteel, Inc., 474 U.S. at 525. 4\n\n       In the situation before us, where the purposes of finality do not clearly\n\nsupport enforcement of either judgment, we might on the sole basis of our\n\nhierarchical system of courts prefer to give effect to the pronouncement of the\n\nSupreme Court. In an analogous context, for example, the D.C. Circuit stated that\n\n“[w]here, as here, a decision of the Supreme Court--the preeminent tribunal in our\n\n\n\n       4\n         In State v. Hagen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1351345\"><a href=\"/opinion/1351345/state-v-hagen/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 747 (Utah Ct. App. 1990), the Utah Court of\nAppeals expressly relied on the collateral estoppel effect of Ute Indian Tribe III in\nholding that the state court lacked jurisdiction over the Indian defendants. Nevertheless,\nthe Utah Supreme Court reversed, citing its earlier conclusion in the companion case of\nState v. Perank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Utah 1992), but without further discussion of collateral\nestoppel. Hagen, 858 P.2d at 925-26. When Hagen reached the Supreme Court, the\nCourt declined to address whether collateral estoppel barred relitigation of the boundary\nissue. Hagen, 510 U.S. at 409-10. The Court relied on the procedural ground that\ncounsel for the petitioner had failed to raise collateral estoppel in seeking a writ of\ncertiorari. Id. The Court found “no reason to consider an argument that petitioner not\nonly failed to raise but on which he expressly refused to rely in seeking a writ of\ncertiorari.” Id. at 410. Accordingly, the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling that collateral\nestoppel did not prevent relitigation of the boundary issue remains the settled judgment of\nthat court.\n\n                                           - 31 -\n\fjudicial system--departs in some pivotal aspects from those of lower federal\n\ncourts, amendatory action may be in order to bring the pronouncements of the\n\nlatter courts into line with the views of the former.” American Iron & Steel Inst.,\n\n560 F.2d at 596. We do not, however, take such “amendatory action” in this case\n\nmerely on the basis of the incongruency between our decision in Ute Indian Tribe\n\nIII and Hagen. Additional factors, including the importance of uniformity, also\n\nsupport our view that Ute Indian Tribe III should be modified in light of Hagen.\n\n      Uniformity is an important value in our system of judicial decisionmaking.\n\nWhile “[c]onflicts in the circuits are generally accepted and in some ways even\n\nwelcomed,” Stauffer Chem. Co., 464 U.S. at 177 (White, J., concurring), uniform\n\ndecisionmaking within each circuit is essential. The related doctrines of\n\ncollateral estoppel and stare decisis are exactly the sort of tools that have been\n\ndesigned to ensure uniformity and compliance with binding precedent. Like\n\ncollateral estoppel, stare decisis “promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and\n\nconsistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions,\n\nand contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.”\n\nPayne v. Tennessee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827 (1991). Unfortunately, these doctrines\n\nhave so far failed to prevent the inconsistency between Ute Indian Tribe III and\n\nHagen. Given the important values that underlie these doctrines, we cannot allow\n\nsuch an inconsistency to persist.\n\n\n                                         - 32 -\n\f       More importantly, the lack of uniformity between Ute Indian Tribe III and\n\nHagen presents a practical dilemma of daily importance. Although the Tribe\n\ncontinues to exercise civil and non-felony criminal jurisdiction on those portions\n\nof the Uintah Valley Reservation that were opened to settlement under the 1902-\n\n1905 allotment legislation, the State of Utah is solely responsible under Hagen for\n\nbringing felony prosecutions on the same lands. Often the difference between\n\nstate and tribal jurisdiction is a matter of only a few dollars, the amount\n\nseparating a misdemeanor from a felony in the case of theft, for example. Similar\n\nproblems arise in determining whether an assault constitutes a misdemeanor\n\nsubject to tribal and federal jurisdiction or whether it constitutes a felony subject\n\nto state jurisdiction. In this situation, the interest of uniformity clearly supports\n\nmodification of Ute Indian Tribe III and creation of a uniform allocation of\n\njurisdiction. As the Third Circuit stated, “‘[U]niformity’ in application of\n\nprinciples and in decision-making might constitute a ‘special reason for disturbing\n\n[the] repose and finality . . . ’ of an earlier adjudication.” American Iron & Steel\n\nInst., 560 F.2d at 597 (quoting Greater Boston Television Corp., 463 F.2d at 278-\n\n79).\n\n       Although a uniform allocation of jurisdiction would eliminate the existing\n\nconfusion, we are mindful that “[f]inality must . . . delimit equality in a temporal\n\nsense, and we must accept as a fact that the argument for uniformity loses force\n\n\n                                         - 33 -\n\fover time.” James B. Beam Distilling Co., 501 U.S. at 542. As a limit on\n\nuniformity, finality is of particular importance where a change in law threatens to\n\ndisrupt a final tort award or other settled judgment based on then-existing legal\n\nprinciples. The need for finality, however, applies with less force to judgments\n\nthat are not “inherently final” but are rather of “a continuing nature.” American\n\nIron & Steel Inst., 560 F.2d at 599. Where a prior erroneous judgment necessarily\n\naffects continuing conduct, the interests of uniformity may demand departure\n\nfrom the prior judgment to bring a court’s view of the law into line with the\n\nprevailing view.

The character of Ute Indian Tribe III reflects this type of judgment.\n\nAs the district court noted, the state and local defendants are not seeking “to\n\nunravel the intricate tapestry of individual judgments already made final each\n\n\n                                        - 34 -\n\ftime a new decision is announced.” Ute Indian Tribe IV, 935 F.

This case does not involve the retroactive application of\n\nHagen to events or lawsuits that have occurred in the past. To the extent that\n\nHagen threatens to displace a judgment “on which reliance may reasonably have\n\nbeen placed,” James B. Beam Distilling Co., 501 U.S. at 538, today’s decision is\n\nlimited to prospective application only. See United States v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996).\n\n      The Tribe raises one final argument against modification of Ute Indian\n\nTribe III. The Tribe contends that even if Ute Indian Tribe III does not continue\n\nto define the current boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation as between the\n\nState of Utah and criminal defendants under Hagen, the decision still should apply\n\nto legal relations between the state and local defendants and the Tribe. In effect,\n\nthe Tribe urges us to adopt a dual jurisdictional system. Under such a system, Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III would control the allocation of authority among the named parties\n\nto this lawsuit in their dealings with each other, while Hagen would apply to the\n\nstate and local defendants’ relationships with all other parties. The Tribe\n\ncontends that such a dual system is warranted because the state and local\n\n\n                                        - 35 -\n\fdefendants, as full participants in Ute Indian Tribe III, are directly bound by our\n\nen banc decision, while the Tribe, as a nonparty to the litigation in Hagen, is not\n\ndirectly bound by the Supreme Court’s decision. Accordingly, the Tribe contends\n\nthat the state and local defendants may properly assert jurisdiction over non-\n\nIndians within those portions of the original Uintah Valley Reservation that were\n\nopen to settlement under the 1902-1905 legislation (the Hagen-based\n\njurisdictional overlay). In their dealings with the Tribe and its members,\n\nhowever, the state and local defendants must recognize the authority of the Tribe\n\nand the federal government within those same portions of the Reservation (the\n\nUte Indian Tribe III-based overlay).\n\n      We reject the Tribe’s contention that jurisdiction must be allocated among\n\nthe parties by two inconsistent boundary determinations. The task of allocating\n\njurisdiction necessarily involves line-drawing, and in an area where there is a\n\ncompelling need for uniformity, there must be a single bright line. A dual system\n\nwould only continue the confusion that has characterized the relationship between\n\nthe parties since the issuance of Hagen. Under the Tribe’s approach, for example,\n\njurisdiction would depend not on the geographic locale of the crime or event at\n\nissue, but on the relationship between the State of Utah and the individual or\n\nentity over whom the State seeks to exercise jurisdiction. Rather than creating a\n\nstable allocation of jurisdiction where the parties’ respective jurisdictions can be\n\n\n                                        - 36 -\n\fdetermined by reference to lines on a map, the Tribe’s approach would introduce\n\nenormous uncertainty into an already complicated system. Each time the state and\n\nlocal defendants attempt to assert jurisdiction over a new party, whether to collect\n\na tax or enforce a regulation, they would risk having to establish jurisdiction over\n\nthat party through time-consuming and costly litigation. In addition, we question\n\nthe propriety of allocating jurisdiction based on the application of procedural\n\nrules (i.e., collateral estoppel and stare decisis) that were themselves designed to\n\neliminate inconsistency and unpredictability. Further, the legal basis for the\n\nTribe’s dual jurisdictional scheme is undermined by our conclusion that the state\n\nand local defendants are not directly bound by Ute Indian Tribe III, at least as that\n\ndecision conflicts with the contrary holding in Hagen.\n\n      For the reasons articulated above, we conclude that modification of our\n\nearlier judgment is appropriate, not merely because the two decisions are\n\nincongruent, but because of the effect of the incongruency on the interests of\n\nuniformity and the integrity of our system of judicial decisionmaking. We\n\ntherefore hold that the judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III should be modified in\n\nlight of the extraordinary circumstances presented in this case. To dispel any\n\ndoubts, we emphasize the rarity that should attend the use of this remedy.\n\n“Because this Court ordinarily will view motions to recall a mandate with\n\ndisfavor, the opinion in this matter should not be read as an invitation to litigants\n\n\n                                         - 37 -\n\fto seek review of already adjudicated claims.” American Iron & Steel Inst., 560\n\nF.2d at 599.\n\n          We do not, however, recall Ute Indian Tribe III in its entirety. To the\n\nextent that Ute Indian Tribe III decided matters not addressed in Hagen, finality\n\nrequires those decisions to remain undisturbed. Thus, we modify our earlier\n\njudgment only to the extent that it directly conflicts with the holding in Hagen.\n\nWe next address the extent to which the two cases are in direct conflict.\n\nIII.      J URISDICTIONAL B OUNDARIES A FTER H AGEN\n\n          In determining the parties’ respective jurisdictional boundaries after Hagen,\n\nwe begin by identifying the areas where Ute Indian Tribe III and Hagen are not in\n\nconflict and can be reconciled. To the extent that the boundary determinations\n\nmade in Ute Indian Tribe III do not directly conflict with Hagen, they remain in\n\neffect.\n\n          In Ute Indian Tribe IV, the 1996 district court opinion, the court fully\n\naddressed the areas of genuine conflict between Ute Indian Tribe III and Hagen.\n\nIn large part, we need look no further than the district court’s detailed opinion to\n\ndetermine those portions of the original Uintah Valley Reservation that remain the\n\nexclusive province of the Tribe and the federal government. See Ute Indian Tribe\n\nIV, 935 F. Supp. at 1485-1505. In sum, we agree with the district court that\n\nHagen did not effectively overrule the entire judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III,\n\n\n                                           - 38 -\n\fincluding our holdings concerning the National Forest Lands and the\n\nUncompahgre Reservation. Further, we agree that Hagen’s only effect was to\n\nreduce (and not terminate) the boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation to the\n\nextent that lands within the Reservation were unallotted, opened for settlement\n\nunder the 1902-1905 legislation, and not thereafter returned to tribal ownership.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that our prior judgment in Ute Indian Tribe III should be,\n\nand is now, modified to the extent that lands within the original reservation\n\nboundaries were unallotted, opened to non-Indian settlement under the 1902-1905\n\nlegislation, and not thereafter returned to tribal ownership. 5\n\n       A.     The Uintah Valley Reservation, The Uncompahgre Reservation,\n              and the National Forest Lands\n\n       In Ute Indian Tribe III, we decided three reservation diminishment issues.\n\nFirst, we concluded that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation did not have the\n\neffect of diminishing or disestablishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. Ute\n\nIndian Tribe III, 773 F.2d at 1989. Second, we concluded that the withdrawal of\n\nthe National Forest Lands did not diminish the Uintah Valley Reservation. Id. at\n\n1090. Finally, we held that the 1894 and 1897 allotment legislation did not\n\ndiminish or disestablish the Uncompahgre Reservation. Id. at 1093.\n\n\n\n       5\n        Because we depart from a mandate of the en banc court and modify the earlier\njudgment in this case, we have circulated this opinion to the en banc court pursuant to our\nrules. Each member of the en banc court has concurred in our holding.\n\n                                           - 39 -\n\f      Hagen dealt only with the first of these three issues. As the district court\n\nstated:\n\n      Hagen determined “that the Uintah Indian Reservation has been\n      diminished by Congress,” i.e., that the original boundary of the\n      Uintah Valley Reservation does not currently define the present\n      territorial extent of federal, state and tribal jurisdiction in the Uintah\n      Basin.\n\nUte Indian Tribe IV, 935 F. Supp. at 1484 (citing Hagen, 510 U.S. at 419-21).\n\nThe district court continued:\n\n      Hagen [did not] address the Tenth Circuit’s determination in [Ute\n      Indian Tribe III] that the 1905 national forest withdrawals of\n      approximately 1,010,000 acres of reservation land did not diminish\n      the Uintah Reservation boundaries. Hagen also makes no ruling\n      concerning the boundaries of the Uncompahgre Reservation, the\n      original extent of which was reaffirmed by the Tenth Circuit.\n\nId. at 1485.\n\n      Although the state and local defendants admit that Hagen did not address\n\nthe status of the Uncompahgre Reservation or the National Forest Lands, they\n\nassert that we should nevertheless recall our entire mandate in Ute Indian Tribe\n\nIII. The defendants argue that Hagen effectively overruled the fundamental\n\npremise upon which the entire holding of Ute Indian Tribe III was based--namely,\n\nthat statutory restoration language is insufficient to infer diminishment. They\n\npoint out that in Hagen the Supreme Court stated that “restoration of unallotted\n\nreservation lands to the public domain evidences a congressional intent with\n\nrespect to those lands inconsistent with the continuation of reservation status.”\n\n                                         - 40 -\n\f510 U.S. at 414. The state and local defendants argue that in light of this\n\nstatement, Ute Indian Tribe III’s holding concerning the National Forest Lands\n\nand the Uncompahgre Reservation cannot stand because the entire holding was\n\nbased on a misreading of the same congressional restoration language that was at\n\nissue in Hagen.\n\n      Assuming that Ute Indian Tribe III’s holding with respect to the National\n\nForest Lands and the Uncompahgre Reservation was based on a misreading of the\n\napplicable legislation, such a misreading alone is not sufficient to justify\n\ndeparting from our earlier judgment. As we stated earlier, our decision to modify\n\nUte Indian Tribe III does not result from the desire to correct a prior erroneous\n\njudgment, but rather from the need to reconcile our decision with a directly\n\nconflicting decision of the Supreme Court. Because Hagen did not directly\n\naddress our holding in Ute Indian Tribe III as it relates to the National Forest\n\nLands and the Uncompahgre Reservation, we have no reason to depart from that\n\npart of our prior judgment. We thus reject the defendants’ contention that the\n\njudgment in Ute Indian Tribe III should be recalled in its entirety.\n\n      B.     Non-Trust Lands Within the Original Boundaries of the Uintah\n             Valley Reservation\n\n      Because we have concluded that Hagen did not address the status of the\n\nNational Forest Lands or the Uncompahgre Reservation, we must now address the\n\nextent to which Hagen directly conflicts with Ute Indian Tribe III. In particular,\n\n                                         - 41 -\n\fwe must decide which lands within the Uintah Valley Reservation are no longer\n\nIndian country after Hagen. The remaining controversy centers on whether the\n\nstate and local defendants or the Tribe and the federal government have\n\njurisdiction over the various categories of non-trust (i.e., fee), lands within the\n\noriginal boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation, whether held by Indians or\n\nnon-Indians.\n\n       Under 18 U.S.C. § 1151, the Tribe and the federal government have civil\n\nand criminal jurisdiction over “Indian country.” Pittsburg & Midway Coal\n\nMining Co. v. Watchman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694609\"><a href=\"/opinion/694609/pittsburg-midway-coal-mining-company-v-derrick-watchman-victor-joe-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1540-41 (10th Cir. 1995). Indian\n\ncountry includes “all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been\n\nextinguished.” 18 U.S.C. § 1151(c). This category constitutes lands held in trust\n\nby the federal government. Indian country also encompasses “all land within the\n\nlimits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States\n\nGovernment, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including\n\nrights-of-way running through the reservation.” 18 U.S.C. § 1151(a). Thus,\n\nIndian Country also includes all non-trust, or fee, lands so long as such lands are\n\nlocated within the “limits of any Indian reservation.”\n\n      There are four categories of non-trust lands at issue in this case:\n\n      (a) lands that passed from trust to fee status pursuant to non-Indian\n      settlement under the 1902-1905 allotment legislation;\n\n\n\n                                         - 42 -\n\f      (b) lands apportioned to the “Mixed Blood” Utes under the Ute\n      Partition Act, Act of Aug. 27, 1954, Pub. L. No. 97-698, ch. 1009, 68\n      Stat. 868 (codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 677-677aa);\n      (c) lands allotted to individual Indians that have passed into fee\n      status after 1905; and\n      (d) lands that were held in trust after the Reservation was opened in\n      1905 but that since have been exchanged into fee status by the Tribe\n      for then-fee (now trust) lands in an effort to consolidate its land\n      holdings pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act, Act of June 18,\n      1934, ch. 576, 48 Stat. 984 (codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 461-79) and the\n      Indian Land Consolidation Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 97-459, 96 Stat.\n      2517 (codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 2201-11).\n\nSee Ute Indian Tribe IV, 935 F. Supp. at 1484, 1486. In Ute Indian Tribe III, we\n\nheld that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation did not have the effect of\n\ndiminishing or disestablishing the Uintah Valley Reservation. We thus concluded\n\nthat all of the non-trust lands identified above remained “Indian country” under\n\n§ 1151(a) as lands within “the limits of any Indian reservation.” In this case, we\n\nmust determine the extent to which Hagen directly conflicts with our earlier\n\nconclusion that all of the above categories of non-trust lands remain within Indian\n\ncountry.\n\n      The parties do not dispute that Hagen directly conflicts with the first\n\ncategory of non-trust lands, those lands passing in fee to non-Indians pursuant to\n\nthe 1902-1905 allotment legislation. This was precisely the category of fee lands\n\nat issue in Hagen. Accordingly, we modify our mandate in Ute Indian Tribe III\n\nand hold in accordance with Hagen that these lands are no longer within Indian\n\n\n\n                                        - 43 -\n\fcountry under section 1151(a) subject to the jurisdiction of the Tribe and the\n\nfederal government.\n\n      With respect to the other three categories of non-trust lands, the state and\n\nlocal defendants argue that these lands also are no longer within Indian country\n\nafter Hagen. They contend that the Supreme Court in Hagen “clearly\n\ncontemplated that the exterior boundaries of the Reservation would simply be\n\ngone.” Appt. Brief, at 44. In other words, the defendants argue that the Court\n\nheld that the 1902-1905 legislation completely terminated the Reservation such\n\nthat no discrete, definable reservation boundaries now exist. Under the\n\ndefendants’ theory, there are no external boundaries and thus no “limits of any\n\nreservation.” Indian country therefore is confined under § 1151(c) to “Indian\n\nallotments . . . which have not been extinguished,” or trust lands. Under the\n\ntheory that Indian country is limited to trust lands, the defendants argue that the\n\nthree disputed categories of non-trust lands no longer constitute Indian country.\n\n      We reject the defendants’ argument that Hagen removed all non-trust lands\n\nwithin the original Uintah Valley Reservation from Indian country. In Hagen, the\n\nSupreme Court did not decide that the 1902-1905 allotment legislation completely\n\ndisestablished the Uintah Valley Reservation, erasing its outer boundaries and\n\nrendering § 1151(a) inapplicable to the three disputed categories of non-trust\n\nlands. The Court in Hagen stated:\n\n\n                                         - 44 -\n\f      [W]e hold that the restoration of unallotted reservation lands to the\n      public domain evidences a congressional intent with respect to those\n      lands inconsistent with the continuation of reservation status. Thus,\n      the existence of such language in the operative section of a surplus\n      land Act indicates that the Act diminished the reservation.\n\nHagen, 510 U.S. at 414 (emphasis added). The Court stated that the Uintah\n\nValley Reservation had been “diminished” -- not “disestablished,” “eliminated,”\n\nor “terminated.” Moreover, the diminishment was only “with respect to those\n\nlands” that had been restored to the public domain under the 1902-1905\n\nlegislation. See Ute Indian Tribe IV, 935 F. Supp. at 1487-88. We therefore\n\nconclude that Hagen did not erase the boundaries of the Uintah Valley\n\nReservation and that the current “limits of [the] reservation” thus embrace the\n\nthree categories of non-trust lands at issue. In sum, Hagen does not conflict with\n\nour holding in Ute Indian Tribe III that these categories of non-trust lands remain\n\nwithin Indian country under section 1151(a).\n\n      We note that this conclusion has the benefit of producing a stable,\n\nunchanging allocation of jurisdiction. Under our approach, the Tribe and the\n\nfederal government retain jurisdiction over all trust lands, the National Forest\n\nLands, the Uncompahgre Reservation, and the three categories of non-trust lands\n\nthat remain within the boundaries of the Uintah Valley Reservation. The state\n\nand local defendants have jurisdiction over the fee lands removed from the\n\nReservation under the 1902-1905 allotment legislation. Although a title search\n\n\n                                        - 45 -\n\fmay be necessary to determine which lands were opened under the 1902-1905\n\nlegislation, the parties’ respective jurisdictions will never change once the status\n\nof those lands is conclusively determined. By contrast, under the defendants’\n\ntheory (i.e., that Indian country is limited to trust lands) the Indian country status\n\nof land would change as trust lands are transferred into fee lands. We recognize\n\nthat while our approach might result in a checkerboard allocation of jurisdiction,\n\nsuch a result is more desirable than the defendants’ approach, which would\n\nproduce a “moving checkerboard” because lands leaving trust status would also\n\nlose their status as Indian country.\n\n       In conclusion, we reject the argument that Indian country is confined to\n\nlands held in trust by the federal government under § 1151(c). Rather, Indian\n\ncountry extends to all trust lands, the National Forest Lands, the Uncompahgre\n\nReservation, and the three disputed categories of non-trust lands discussed\n\nabove. 6\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the defendants’ motion to recall our\n\nmandate in Ute Indian Tribe III, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458771\"><a href=\"/opinion/458771/the-ute-indian-tribe-and-cross-appellee-v-the-state-of-utah-duchesne/\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1985) (en banc), cert.\n\n\n\n       6\n         We decline to address whether any portion of the non-trust lands opened in 1905\nmight still constitute Indian country under section 1151(b) as a “dependent Indian\ncommunity” because that question is not properly before the court.
