C. A.), and that plaintiff does not operate as in auto stage and therefore should not be obliged to pay this tax. Appellant is engaged in the business designated and section <cross_reference>48-101</cross_reference>, I. C. A., defines \"trailer\" and fixes the fees thereon.</p>\n<p>As to uniformity sections 2 and 5, article 7, of our state Constitution refer to taxation in its ordinary sense and not to license or registration fees on motor vehicles. (<em>In re Kessler</em>,<cross_reference>26 Idaho 764</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>146 P. 113</cross_reference>, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 228, L.R.A. 1915D, 322; <em>Curtis v.

Ct. 380</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>75 L. ed. 953</cross_reference>, relied on by appellant, the revenue was allocated to the general fund. In the instant case the revenue goes to the state highway fund, via the motor vehicle fund as provided by chapter 165, 1929 Session Laws, page 298 (now sections <cross_reference>48-801</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>48-802</cross_reference>, I. C. A.).</p>\n<p>There is no allegation that one or any number of said trailers are operated <em>solely</em> in interstate commerce and appellant admits that a different rule applies to interstate operators as distinguished from intrastate.</p>\n<p>As against the objection that the act embraces more than one subject in violation of section 16, article 3, of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 583</span> \nthe state Constitution, the title is identical with that approved in <em>State v. Jones</em>, <cross_reference>9 Idaho 693</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>75 P. 819</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>Appellant argues that section 48-127, I. C. A., is not in effect, because, though approved on the same day it carried no emergency clause, chapter 189, 1931 Session Laws, page 325 (3 I. C. A., p. 227) did and thus is controlling. Where two acts are passed and approved on the same day, they should be construed as a single act. (<em>Oneida County v. Evans</em>, <cross_reference>25 Idaho 456</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>138 P. 337</cross_reference>.) Section 48-127 went into effect later than chapter 189, <em>supra</em>, and is technically the latest expression of the legislative will. The appellant relies on <em>Peavy v. McCombs</em>,<cross_reference>26 Idaho 143</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>140 P. 965</cross_reference>, contending the acts are inconsistent, but there is no inconsistency merely because section 48-127 contains subsection h, while chapter 189, <em>supra</em>, does not.</p>\n<p>Appellant claims that the classification under subsection h, section 48-127, I. C. A., is arbitrary; that it violates section 13, article 1, of the state Constitution, and that the exemptions thereunder render the law discriminatory and void. That the law violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution, equal protection clause, in that by taxing only trailers used in connection with autostages, it exempts all other trailers used by individuals or common carriers.</p>\n<p><em>In re Public Utilities Com.</em>, <cross_reference>51 Idaho 56</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1 P.2d 627</cross_reference>, referring to section 13, article 1, the court said:</p>\n<p>\"This clause only requires that the same means and methods be applied impartially to all the constituents of a class so that the law may operate equally and uniformly upon all persons in similar circumstances.\" (<em>Curtis v. Pfost, supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>It does not violate the equality clause of the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>\"The equality clause of the federal Constitution is not necessarily infringed by special legislation or by legislative classification of persons or things.\" (<em>State v. Horn</em>, <cross_reference>27 Idaho 782</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>152 P. 275</cross_reference>.) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 584</span> </p>\n<p>\"If the state determines that the use of streets for private purposes in the usual and ordinary manner shall be preferred over their use by common carriers for hire, there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent. . . . . Their use for the purpose of gain is special and extraordinary, and, generally at least, may be prohibited or conditioned as the Legislature deems proper.\" (<em>Packard v. Banton, supra.</em> See: <em>Sprout v. City</em><em>of South Bend</em>, <cross_reference>277 U.S. 163</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>48 Sup. Ct. 502</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>72 L. ed. 833</cross_reference>, 62 A.L.R. 45; <em>Smallwood v. Jeter</em>, <cross_reference>42 Idaho 169</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>244 P. 149</cross_reference>.)</p>\n<p>The appellant claims: That the law was not read on three separate days in each house prior to final vote; that no emergency existed warranting dispensing with such provision; it contained no emergency clause; was not read section by section, and no vote was taken by yeas and nays thereon. That the law provides for double taxation and is a tax on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p><em>In re Drainage Dist. No. 1</em>, <cross_reference>26 Idaho 311</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>143 P. 299</cross_reference>, L.R.A. 1915A, 1210, announces the rule, that it will not be presumed in any case from the mere silence of the journals that either house has exceeded its authority or disregarded a constitutional requirement in the passage of a legislative act, unless the Constitution has expressly required the journal to show the actions taken, as, for instance, where it requires the yeas and nays to be entered. (Citing 36 Cyc., p. 950.)</p>\n<p>There is no double taxation. (<em>In re Kessler, supra; Smallwood</em><em>v. Jeter, supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>The trailer act is not a burden on interstate commerce because it is imposed on all commercial vehicles, similarly situated, using the highways.</p>\n<p>\". . . . where a state at its own expense furnishes special facilities for the use of those engaged in commerce, interstate as well as domestic, it may exact compensation therefor. The amount of the charges and the method of collection are primarily for determination by the state itself.\" (<em>Hendrick v.</em><em>Maryland</em>, <cross_reference>235 U.S. 610</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>35 Sup. Ct. 140</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>59 L. ed. 385</cross_reference>.) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 585</span> </p>\n<p>Appellant complains that the proceeds of the tax are not devoted wholly to the supervision of autostages or to the maintenance of the highways.</p>\n<p>Herein the proceeds are allocated to the motor vehicle fund and provision made for transfer to the state highway fund.</p>\n<p>This court has held, <em>Smallwood v. Jeter, supra</em>, a license fee not invalid merely because it was above the cost of regulation; it is sufficient if the proceeds go into the highway fund. (<em>Interstate Transit Co. v. Lindsey, supra; Clark v. Poor</em>,<cross_reference>274 U.S. 554</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>47 Sup. Ct. 702</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>71 L. ed. 1199</cross_reference>.)</p>\n<p>Appellant alleges impairment of the obligation of contract, arguing that it operates its trailers under chapter 267, Session Laws of 1929, page 614 (sees. <cross_reference>59-801</cross_reference> to <cross_reference>59-817</cross_reference>, I. C. A.) under which law its permit to operate was granted, and that this constitutes a contract between plaintiff and the state of Idaho.</p>\n<p>This contention would exclude the state from initiating new methods of taxation in almost every field if carried to its ultimate conclusion; the question is urged here for the first time and hence under <em>Curtis v. Pfost, supra</em>, will not be considered.</p>\n<p>Contrary to appellant's argument that the one per cent gross earnings tax is unfair and discriminatory, exemptions as to those operating exclusively in transportation of farm products, complained of by appellant, have been approved in <em>Curtis v.</em><em>Pfost, supra.</em></p>\n<p>Appellant claims the tax is void for the reason that the tax is not directly proportionate to the use made by appellant of the highways.</p>\n<p>If the appellant means that the tax is in excess of the value of the use of the highways as a place to transact his business, he has pleaded no facts as to the amount or value of such use, and also the allegation is a conclusion of law not admitted by the demurrer. (<em>Smallwood v. Jeter, supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>\"While a state may not lay a tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, . . . . it may impose even upon motor vehicles engaged exclusively in interstate commerce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 586</span> \na charge, as compensation for use of the public highways, which is a fair contribution to the cost of maintaining and constructing them, and of regulating the traffic thereon. . . . . As such a charge is a direct burden on interstate commerce, the tax cannot be sustained unless it appears affirmatively, in some way, that it is levied only as compensation for use of the highways or to defray the expense of regulating motor traffic. This may be indicated by the nature of the imposition, such as a mileage tax directly proportioned to the use, . . . . or by express allocation of the proceeds of the tax to highway purposes, as in <em>Clark v. Poor, supra</em>, . . . . Where it is shown that the tax is so imposed, it will be sustained unless the taxpayer shows that it bears no reasonable relation to the privilege of using the highways, or is discriminatory. (Citing cases.)\" (<em>Interstate Transit Co. v. Lindsey, supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>Section 14 of chap. 267, 1929 Session Laws, page 621 (now sec. <cross_reference>59-815</cross_reference>, I. C.

As such a charge is a direct burden on interstate commerce, the tax cannot be sustained unless it appears affirmatively, in some way, that it is levied only as compensation for use of the highways or to defray the expense of regulating motor traffic. This may be indicated by the nature of the imposition, such as a mileage tax directly proportioned to the use, . . . . or by express allocation of the proceeds of the tax to highway purposes, as in <em>Clark v.

(2d) 289</cross_reference>, 295, distinguishes the application of <em>Smith v. Cahoon, supra?</em></p>\n<p>As pointed out in the original opinion the portion of the amended complaint referred to is not clear, however, conceding without determining that the pleader meant to charge that certain individual trailers were used exclusively in interstate commerce, appellant contends they could not be taxed under the statute in question, and that the original opinion did not correctly interpret <em>Interstate Transit Co. v. Lindsey, supra</em>, which case appellant argues rejected a classification based upon carrying capacity, however, the latest interpretation of that case, by the supreme court of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 588</span> \nthe United States in <em>Hicklin v.

Ct. 142</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>78 L. ed. 247</cross_reference>, expressly sustains and supports our analysis and holding in the original opinion as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Carrying capacity, the size and weight of trucks, unquestionably have a direct relation to the wear and hazards of the highways. It is for this reason that the authority of the State to impose directly reasonable limitations on the weight and size of vehicles, although applicable to interstate carriers, has been sustained.\" (Citing cases.)</p>\n<p>The original opinion is in this particular and as to the first, and third questions, therefore adhered to.</p>\n<p>As to the fourth question the holding in <em>Prouty v.

C. A., requires further elucidation. The authorities generally though not without conflict<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> are to the effect that such a tax is an interference with interstate commerce and therefore not permissible to the extent that such \"gross revenues\" are derived from business outside of the taxing state.

While the respondent should be restrained from collecting the tax on the portion of the \"gross operating revenue\" earned from use of the roads without the state of Idaho, such tax may be collected on the portion earned from the use of the roads within the state.

The statute is, therefore, not open to the objection that it compels the company to pay for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. A tax is not obnoxious to the commerce clause merely because imposed upon property used in interstate commerce, even if it takes the form of a tax for the privilege of exercising its franchise within the state.

It is for this reason that the authority of the State to impose directly reasonable limitations on the weight and size of vehicles, although applicable to interstate carriers, has been sustained.\" (Citing cases.)</p>\n<p>The original opinion is in this particular and as to the first, and third questions, therefore adhered to.</p>\n<p>As to the fourth question the holding in <em>Prouty v.

C. A., requires further elucidation. The authorities generally though not without conflict<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> are to the effect that such a tax is an interference with interstate commerce and therefore not permissible to the extent that such \"gross revenues\" are derived from business outside of the taxing state.

      "attorneys": "F.E. Tydeman, for Appellant.\n\nThe tax is not uniform.\n\nChapter 185, 1931 Sess. L., violates the provisions of article 7, section 2, and article 7, section 5, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho.\n\nThe apparent purpose of the law is to collect a tax for the use of the roads. The said chapter provides that trailers used generally shall be taxed according to weight. For trailers used in connection with an \"auto stage\" shall pay an additional tax based on carrying capacity.\n\nSome of appellant's trailers upon which the tax is placed are used in interstate commerce. These cannot legally be taxed a flat tax regardless of the number of miles traveled in Idaho. (10 Am.  Eng. Ann. Cases, 101, 10 L.R.A., N.S., 625; Prouty v. Coyne ,  55 Fed. (2d) 289 .)\n\nThe law in effect is chapter 189, Session Laws of Idaho, 1931. Chapter 189 became effective March 16, 1931, and has never been amended or repealed. It does not provide for any tax on trailers. It amends section 1592 of the Compiled Statutes. Chapter 185 did not become effective until sixty days thereafter. It had no emergency clause. Chapter 189 had an emergency clause and became effective at once. The fact that it has an emergency clause indicates that it was more thoroughly studied and is the real intention of the legislature on the subject of whether trailers should have the extra tax. ( Peavy v. McCombs ,  26 Idaho 143 ,  140 P. 965 ;  Heilig v. City  Council ,  7 Wn. 29 ,  34 P. 164 ;  Perrault v. Robinson ,  29 Idaho 267 , 158 P. 1074 .)\n\nThe classification is arbitrary. ( Nutt v. Ellerbe , 56 Fed. 1058-1063.)\n\nTrailers of equal weight can be and generally are used for equal mileage. There is no reasonable basis for taxing all trailers a certain amount and then adding to it for those used in connection with \"auto stages.\"\n\nThe law violates article 1, section 13, of the state Constitution. ( State v. Crosson ,  33 Idaho 140 ,  190 P. 922 .)\n\nThe law was not passed in the manner provided by article 3, section 15, Idaho Constitution.\n\nThe three readings of the bill were mandatory, and no sufficient urgency existed for waiving such readings. ( Cohn v.  Kingsley ,  5 Idaho 416 ,  49 P. 985 , 38 L.R.A. 74.)\n\nChapter 185 is void in so far as it attempts to enforce the payment of a tax on trailers used exclusively in connection with auto transportation companies engaged in interstate commerce. The law violates article 1, section 8, of the federal Constitution. This section is commonly known as the commerce clause of the federal Constitution.\n\nAn interstate carrier must comply with local regulations for safety and traffic regulations but is exempt from any flat tax that taxes the operator regardless of the use made by him of the highways and any tax made that is not based upon the use to be made of the highways is unconstitutional. ( Sprout v. City of  South Bend ,  277 U.S. 163 ,  48 Sup. Ct. 502 ,  504 ,  72 L. ed. 833 , 62 A.L.R. 45;  Prouty v. Coyne ,  55 Fed. (2d) 289 ;  American  Transit Co. v. Philadelphia ,  18 Fed. (2d) 991 .)\n\nBert H. Miller, Attorney General, and Ariel L. Crowley, Assistant Attorney General, for Respondent.\n\nThe defense in event of prosecution for violation of statutes, that statutes are unconstitutional and void is an adequate remedy at law; where such defense is available injunctive relief may not be granted. ( Nims v. Gilmore ,  17 Idaho 609 , 107 P. 79  (see cases therein cited).\n\nThe assaulted provisions of the motor vehicles registration act are not obnoxious to the state or federal Constitutions, in terms or effect. ( In re Kessler ,  26 Idaho 764 ,  146 P. 113 , Ann. Cas. 1917A, 228, L.R.A. 1915D, 322;  Curtis v. Pfost , 53 Idaho 1 ,  21 P.2d 73 ;  Independent School Dist. v. Pfost , 51 Idaho 240 ,  4 P.2d 893 , 84 A.L.R. 820.)\n\nChapter 185, 1931 Session Laws, does not violate section 16, article 3, of the Idaho Constitution. ( Pioneer Irr. Dist. v.  Bradley ,  8 Idaho 310 ,  68 P. 295 , 101 Am. St. 201;  Boise City  v. Baxter , 41. Ida. 368, 375,  238 P. 1029 ;  Johnson v.  Harrison ,  47 Minn. 575 ,  50 N.W. 923 , 28 Am. St. 382.)\n\nThe taxes imposed do not constitute \"double taxation\" so as to be constitutionally objectionable. ( Smallwood v. Jeter , 42 Idaho 169 ,  244 P. 149 ;  Sanger v. Lukens , 24 Fed. (2d) 229; 1 Cooley, Taxation, 226.)\n\nThe tax assaulted does not violate the interstate commerce provision of the United States Constitution. ( Hendrick v.  Maryland ,  235 U.S. 610 ,  35 Sup. Ct. 140 ,  59 L. ed. 385 ,  391 ; Kane v. New Jersey ,  242 U.S. 160 ,  37 Sup. Ct. 30 , 61 L. ed. 222 ;  Clark v. Poor ,  274 U.S. 554 ,  47 Sup. Ct. 702 , 71 L. ed. 1199 .)",
