Robreno\n                  ____________________________________\n\n      Submitted for Possible Dismissal Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)\n      or Summary Action Pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6\n                                  July 8, 2011\n\n      Before: SLOVITER, JORDAN and GREENAWAY, JR., Circuit Judges\n\n                          (Opinion filed July 18, 2011 )\n                                   _________\n\n                                   OPINION\n                                   _________\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n                                        1\n\f         Proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, Shakur Gannaway appeals orders of the\n\nDistrict Court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants and denying his\n\nmotions for appointment of counsel. We will affirm.\n\n                                              I.\n\n         Gannaway‘s civil rights complaint arose from a period of detention in the Berks\n\nCounty Jail (BCJ),1 where he was incarcerated before trial on charges relating to a May\n\n2009 armed robbery, and also pursuant to a probation/parole detainer attached to an\n\nearlier offense. Written in a discursive, stream-of-consciousness fashion, the complaint\n\nassailed a series of injustices perpetrated by the allegedly racist and abusive staff of\n\nBCJ—outrages that Gannaway likened to ―modern-day slavery.‖ The offenses were\n\nlegion, and included: retaliating for filing grievances, committing racist acts, removing\n\nhis mattress from his cell, ―starving‖ him during the Muslim religious holiday of\n\nRamadan, instituting a ―Nutraloaf‖ diet (which made him sick and interfered with his\n\nability to swallow medicine), forcing him to occupy a cell with a suspected homosexual,\n\noverpricing commissary items, and depriving him of medical treatment. Gannaway later\n\namended his complaint, elaborating upon his retaliation complaints, articulating\n\nharassment by various guards, and describing the theft of funds from his inmate account.\n\n         The District Court ordered Gannaway deposed; following the deposition, the\n\ndefendants moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the motion, finding\n\n\n1\n    The BCJ was formerly known as the Berks County Prison.\n                                              2\n\f―that [Gannaway]‘s claims [we]re either legally insufficient or unsupported by the\n\nrecord.‖ Gannaway v. Berks Cnty. Prison, No. 09-4501, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35047,\n\nat *7 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 29, 2011).\n\n       Gannaway appealed. He has twice moved for the appointment of counsel.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       Deriving our jurisdiction from 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we exercise plenary review over\n\na District Court‘s grant of summary judgment. Lamont v. New Jersey, 637 F.3d 177, 181\n\n(3d Cir. 2011). In reviewing the summary-judgment order, we apply ―the same standard\n\nthat the lower court should have applied.‖ Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d\n\n271, 278 (3d Cir. 2000); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (summary judgment is appropriate\n\nif ―there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law‖). Our review of the facts and the inferences drawn from\n\nthem must be in the light most favorable to Gannaway, the non-moving party; and as\n\nGannaway is a pro se litigant, his filings are to be liberally construed. Tri-M Grp., LLC\n\nv. Sharp, 638 F.3d 406, 415 (3d Cir. 2011); Capogrosso v. Sup. Ct. of N.J., 588 F.3d 180,\n\n184 n.1 (3d Cir. 2009) (per curiam).\n\n       Since appointment of counsel to an in forma pauperis plaintiff ―is discretionary, . .\n\n. we review the district court‘s decision to deny counsel for an abuse of discretion.‖\n\nParham v. Johnson, 126 F.3d 454, 457 (3d Cir. 1997). We may summarily affirm on any\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fground supported by the record if no substantial question is presented by the appeal.\n\nMurray v. Bledsoe, No. 10-4397, ___ F.3d ___, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 11702, at *3 (3d\n\nCir. June 10, 2011); see also Third Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n                                             III.\n\n       In rendering its decision, the District Court observed that Gannaway had not fully\n\nexhausted the BCJ‘s administrative remedy process for at least some of his claims.\n\nDespite this, it ―review[ed] the majority of these claims as if exhausted.‖ Gannaway,\n\n2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35047 at *2 n.1 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c)(2)). The\n\nremainder—those non-exhausted claims that were not resolved by the opinion, such as\n\nthe ―lack of access to the law library, lack of adequate material in the library, lack of\n\nsanitary food, and alleged tampering with mail and untimely delivery of mail,‖ id. at\n\n*6—were severed from the complaint and dismissed, with ―leave to pursue these claims\n\nafter exhausting administrative remedies.‖ Id. at *2 n.1.\n\n       We recognize that the style of Gannaway‘s complaint renders difficult the process\n\nof determining proper exhaustion. However, at this late date, it is unlikely that he would\n\nbe able to exhaust remaining administrative remedies. According to the BCJ handbook,\n\nan initial grievance must be filed within 30 days of the grievable incident. BCJ Inmate\n\nHandbook § 9.3.6 (2005). The general turnaround time is 15 days, as is the timeframe for\n\nfiling appeals of adverse decisions. Id. § 9.3.7–3.8. Therefore, in order to simplify our\n\nreview and definitively address Gannaway‘s claims, we will analyze them under a\n                                              4\n\fsummary-judgment framework on the merits.\n\n                                            IV.\n\nA) Disciplinary Segregation Claims\n\n       Many of Gannaway‘s complaints relate to prison policies—specific, written\n\npolicies, described at length in the prison handbook and in the ―Disciplinary and Security\n\nHousing Unit‖ orientation materials—governing confinement in disciplinary segregation.\n\nDeveloped in response to the problem of inmates seeking disciplinary segregation for its\n\nbenefits (such as single-cell status and delivery of meals), the programs were designed to\n\nmake residing in the segregation unit less appealing; according to the Warden, they are\n\nbehavioral modification plans and are not intended to be punitive. Decl. of George A.\n\nWagner. Penalties include a temporary mattress restriction during daylight hours (lifted\n\nwithin seven days if the inmate displays appropriate behavior) and a diet consisting of\n\nNutraloaf.\n\n       It was these two aspects of disciplinary confinement that Gannaway attacked most\n\ndirectly. He argued that the deprivation of a mattress exacerbated a prior back injury.\n\nGannaway also claimed that he was rendered physically ill by the Nutraloaf, which he\n\ndescribed as unpalatable and poorly prepared, but that ―they‖ refused to give him real\n\nfood, and he was therefore unable to take his medicine; moreover, he was ―entitle[d] to\n\nknow what he [was] eating.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Neither claim has merit under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments. 2 Gannaway\n\ndid not inform prison officials of his difficulty keeping down the Nutraloaf, despite\n\ncomplaining about the indignity of the meal on numerous occasions. He has therefore\n\nnot shown the requisite deliberate indifference needed to prevail on summary judgment\n\nor at trial. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 836 (1994); see also LeMaire v. Maass, 12\n\nF.3d 1444, 1456 (9th Cir. 1993) (―Because a temporary Nutraloaf diet does not deny ‗the\n\nminimal civilized measure of life‘s necessities,‘ its use falls short of the threshold\n\ndeprivation necessary to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation.‖) (citations\n\nomitted).3\n\n       Gannaway‘s spare allegations regarding the unsanitary containers in which the\n\nNutraloaf was provided, as well as its undercooked or overcooked status, also do not state\n\n\n\n2\n  Gannaway was detained in the BCJ both as a pretrial detainee and pursuant to a\nprobation/parole detainer that activated upon his arrest. The record fails to make clear\nthe resolution of that detainer, and case law has not definitively addressed whether a\nprisoner awaiting a hearing on a detainer falls under the protection of the Eighth or\nFourteenth Amendments. See Palmer v. Marion Cnty., 327 F.3d 588, 592–93 (7th Cir.\n2003); see also Williams v. Mussomelli, 722 F.2d 1130, 1133 (3d Cir. 1983) (―It is\nestablished that pretrial detainees are protected by the due process clause of the fifth and\nfourteenth amendments, not the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth\namendment.‖ (citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979))). But we need not\ndefinitively decide the issue, either generally or pertaining exclusively to Gannaway‘s\nstatus. The Fourteenth Amendment grants at least as much protection as does the Eighth\nAmendment. Natale v. Camden Cnty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 581 (3d Cir. 2003).\nAt a bare minimum, then, Gannaway must meet the ―deliberate indifference‖ test of\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 105 (1976), in order to succeed. Natale, 318 F.3d at 582.\nAs shown repeatedly herein, he failed to do so.\n\n                                              6\n\fa constitutional injury. Cf. Hamm v. De Kalb Cnty., 774 F.2d 1567, 1575 (11th Cir.\n\n1985) (―The fact that [prison] food occasionally contains foreign objects or sometimes is\n\nserved cold, while unpleasant, does not amount to a constitutional deprivation.‖). And\n\nGannaway failed to highlight his back problems in objecting to the mattress restriction.\n\nSee Gannaway Dep. 146:4–7.\n\n       To the extent that Gannaway raised a facial attack on the validity of the\n\ndisciplinary unit restrictions as applied to pretrial detainees—who ―may not be punished\n\nprior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law,‖ Wolfish, 441\n\nU.S. at 535—we must decide ―whether the disability is imposed for the purpose of\n\npunishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate governmental\n\npurpose.‖ Id. at 538; see also Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987) (―[W]hen a prison\n\nregulation impinges on inmates‘ constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is\n\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests.‖). The restrictions pass muster.\n\nThey are moderate, limited in duration, and ―reward‖ good behavior—all consonant with\n\nthe behavioral-modification goals highlighted by the defendants.\n\n\nB) Religious Restrictions\n\n       Gannaway claimed that the BCJ fails to ―acknowledge the Ramadan month,‖ and\n\nthat officials told him he ―couldn‘t practice[] [his] religious belief[s]‖ as a Muslim.\n\n\n3\n  His claims of rapid weight loss, which might otherwise alert officials to the existence of\na serious medical issue, are not supported by the record.\n                                              7\n\fSpecific incidents he cited included an alleged failure to provide him with suitable fast-\n\nbreaking food for Ramadan and an episode where he was prevented from attending a\n\nreligious service, ostensibly for misbehavior.\n\n       These claims find no support in the record; indeed, the defendants submitted a\n\nRamadan-fast participant list, to which Gannaway was a signatory. Similarly, there is no\n\nevidence that Nutraloaf was an unacceptable food for breaking the fast, or that being\n\ndeprived attendance at a single service constituted a substantial burden on Gannaway‘s\n\nability to practice his religion, see Hernandez v. Comm‘r, 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989).\n\nAccordingly, Gannaway has failed to meet his burden under the First Amendment‘s Free\n\nExercise clause or the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000cc-2; Washington v. Klem, 497 F.3d 272, 277 (3d Cir. 2007).\n\n\nC) Strip Search\n\n       Gannaway alleged that he was ―woken up at 5:45am in the morning‖ and forced to\n\nstrip for inspection in the prison gym. During his deposition, he clarified that he was, in\n\nfact, wearing his shorts the entire time, and that the search was conducted due to a\n\nproblem elsewhere on the block. See Gannaway Dep. 218:8–219:8. He also said that the\n\nlength of time he was standing exacerbated his back injury, causing him some pain, but\n\nthat the Lieutenant he informed responded ―too bad.‖ Id. 220:9; see also id. 218:18–19.\n\n       This claim lacks viability under the Fourth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nGannaway cannot show that this search was unreasonable, especially in the aftermath of\n                                             8\n\fan actual incident to which authorities were responding. See Florence v. Bd. of Chosen\n\nFreeholders, 621 F.3d 296, 311 (3d Cir. 2010), cert. granted, 131 S. Ct. 1816 (2011). Nor\n\nhas Gannaway met either the subjective or objective prongs required to demonstrate an\n\nEighth or Fourteenth Amendment violation with regard to his back pain, Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. at 834—and, regardless, the record demonstrates that he was on medication for pain\n\nthroughout the duration of his confinement.\n\n\nD) Retaliation\n\n       Gannaway maintained that his periods in disciplinary confinement, and the\n\nmisconducts issued against him, were the result of retaliatory harassment. However, he\n\nhas shown no ―causal link between the exercise of his constitutional rights and the\n\nadverse action taken against him.‖ Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 333 (3d Cir. 2001). To\n\nthe contrary, Gannaway repeatedly violated BCJ policies. See BCJ Inmate Handbook\n\n§ 2.5 (prohibiting the possession of, and alteration of, items belonging to another); id.\n\n§ 3.5.2 (―You are required to consume prescription medication in the presence of medical\n\npersonnel. Staff are permitted to examine your mouth to ensure compliance.‖); id. § 7.4\n\n(describing various acts of misconduct, including ―harassment by communication,‖\n\nencompassing abuse of the grievance and internal-communications processes).\n\nNothing in the record suggests that Gannaway‘s conduct, assuming arguendo its\n\nconstitutionality, was a ―‗substantial or motivating factor‘ in the decision to discipline\n\nhim.‖ Rauser, 241 F.3d at 333 (quoting Mount Healthy Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S.\n                                              9\n\f275, 287 (1977)).4 Lacking this essential connection, he cannot prevail.\n\n\nE) Racial Comments\n\n       Gannaway contends that he was subjected to racial epithets by guards and other\n\nprison personnel. But it is well settled that ―[t]he use of racially derogatory language,\n\nwhile unprofessional and deplorable, does not violate the Constitution. Standing alone,\n\nsimple verbal harassment does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, deprive a\n\nprisoner of a protected liberty interest or deny a prisoner equal protection of the laws.‖\n\nDeWalt v. Carter, 224 F.3d 607, 612 (7th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). As Gannaway\n\nhas alleged nothing more than verbal harassment (and one occurrence of an undirected\n\nracial epithet carved on a cell door by unknown parties), he cannot recover on this claim.\n\n\nF) Legal Mail\n\n       Gannaway claimed that he was denied access to the courts due to limited law-\n\nlibrary availability; inadequate materials available therein; and instances of tampering\n\nwith, delaying, and disrupting his legal mail. He alleged that a habeas petition was\n\ndenied as untimely due to this inference with his ability to prepare a legal case.\n\nGannaway Dep. 119:19–20; see also Oliver v. Fauver, 118 F.3d 175, 177 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n\n4\n  Other ―harassment‖ identified by Gannaway is simply too vague to support\nconstitutional relief. For example, he accused CO Castro of making sexual overtures, but\nwas only able to cite a single incident where Castro requested that Gannaway stand in his\ncell while the latter was naked—too little to be considered a genuine issue of material\nfact.\n                                             10\n\fBut to prevail on a First Amendment access argument, Gannaway must show the\n\nunderlying lost claim to have been nonfrivolous. Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403,\n\n414–15 (2002). Gannaway‘s ―habeas‖ petition was filed pro se (despite his having\n\ncounsel), in state court, during the pendency of his state criminal trial. It does not appear\n\nto have been denied on timeliness grounds, and Gannaway has not otherwise shown its\n\nmerit. Accordingly, his access claim must fail.5\n\n       To the extent that his legal mail claim is premised on his First Amendment free-\n\nspeech rights, he has not shown a pattern or practice concerning legal mail that is\n\nunrelated to a legitimate penological interest. Jones v. Brown, 461 F.3d 353, 359–60 (3d\n\nCir. 2006). Nor does he point to any prison program or policy that would impinge on his\n\nFirst Amendment right to expression with regard to mail or other communications of a\n\nnon-legal character. See Nasir v. Morgan, 350 F.3d 366, 376–77 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n\nG) Medical Treatment\n\n       Gannaway insisted that he received inadequate medical treatment, assailing the\n\nqualifications of various BCJ physicians. Gannaway Dep. 321:20–24. But evidence in\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Moreover, Gannaway made clear in his deposition that he was not denied access to the\nlaw library; rather, his time was simply limited in a way that he personally found to be\nunacceptable, and which compared unfavorably to the policies of other county jails.\nGannaway Dep. 187:23–188:4. See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 355 (1996)\n(emphasizing that prisons must provide tools ―that the inmates need in order to attack\ntheir sentences, directly or collaterally, and in order to challenge the conditions of their\n                                             11\n\fthe record demonstrates that he received continuous medical treatment for a variety of\n\nailments, and ―mere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment,‖ without more,\n\ncannot support a claim of unconstitutional wrongdoing. Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Inst.\n\nInmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 346 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\n\nH) Financial Deductions\n\n       Gannaway accused the BCJ of taking money from his prison account without his\n\npermission and without notice. Inmates have a property interest in funds held in prison\n\naccounts, and therefore are entitled to due process with respect to those funds. Reynolds\n\nv. Wagner, 128 F.3d 166, 179 (3d Cir. 1997). But all of the deductions about which he\n\ncomplains were explained to him by the BCJ. For example, he didn‘t ―see the relevance‖\n\nof why he was charged for a disciplinary hearing, Gannaway Dep. 161:21–23, ignoring\n\nthe clear warning in the prison handbook regarding disciplinary hearing penalties, see\n\nBCJ Inmate Handbook § 4.3. Gannaway also fails to realize that many other deductions\n\nderive from the filing fees he currently owes this Court (and others) for proceeding in\n\nforma pauperis in earlier civil suits. Other complaints involve failure to issue prompt\n\nreceipts, a claim that is at best ancillary to any actual constitutional harm. The record\n\nsupports summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n       To the extent that Gannaway raised a claim regarding overpriced items in the\n\n\n\nconfinement. Impairment of any other litigating capacity is simply one of the incidental\n(and perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and incarceration‖).\n                                             12\n\fprison commissary, his allegations were entirely conclusory and devoid of factual support\n\nand, as such, could not sustain the charge.\n\n\nI) Clogged Toilet\n\n       To the extent that Gannaway‘s complaint can be read to assert a constitutional\n\nviolation in connection with a clogged toilet in his cell, the record shows that the toilet\n\nwas partly functional; it simply required frequent plunging. Gannaway decided that he\n\nno longer wished to plunge the toilet during the period while the BCJ awaited the arrival\n\nof an available plumber. The result cannot fairly be attributed to the BCJ.\n\n\nJ) Destruction of Property\n\n       To the extent that Gannaway complained that his property was damaged,\n\nconfiscated, or destroyed by BCJ employees, he cannot prevail, as adequate state post-\n\ndeprivation remedies were available. See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984);\n\nTillman v. Lebanon Cnty. Corr. Facility, 221 F.3d 410, 422 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n\nK) Conspiracy\n\n       Throughout these proceedings, Gannaway has insisted on the conspiratorial nature\n\nof the actions taken against him. He termed the prison a ―corrupted body,‖ one that\n\n―stick[s] together.‖ Gannaway Dep. 176:2–3. ―In order to prevail on a conspiracy claim\n\nunder § 1983, a plaintiff must prove that persons acting under color of state law conspired\n\nto deprive him of a federally protected right.‖ Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E. ex rel.\n                                              13\n\fM.E., 172 F.3d 238, 254 (3d Cir. 1999), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated\n\nin P.P. v. West Chester Area Sch. Dist., 585 F.3d 727, 730 (3d Cir. 2009). But ―the\n\nlinchpin for conspiracy is agreement,‖ Bailey v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm‘rs, 956 F.2d 1112,\n\n1122 (11th Cir. 1992), and Gannaway has shown no agreement, implicit or otherwise, in\n\nconnection with the actions he cites.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       Since Gannaway‘s claims were neither complex nor meritorious, the District Court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying his requests for counsel. See Tabron v. Grace, 6\n\nF.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n                                             VI.\n\n       Gannaway‘s complaint and amended complaint pose challenges to judicial\n\nanalysis; nevertheless, we are satisfied that we (with the able assistance of the District\n\nCourt) have identified, entertained, and discussed all of the major issues Gannaway\n\nattempted to raise. Having found them wanting, and encountering no substantial issue on\n\nappeal, we will summarily affirm. Gannaway‘s motions for counsel are denied.

Written in a discursive, stream-of-consciousness fashion, the complaint\n\nassailed a series of injustices perpetrated by the allegedly racist and abusive staff of\n\nBCJ—outrages that Gannaway likened to ―modern-day slavery.‖ The offenses were\n\nlegion, and included: retaliating for filing grievances, committing racist acts, removing\n\nhis mattress from his cell, ―starving‖ him during the Muslim religious holiday of\n\nRamadan, instituting a ―Nutraloaf‖ diet (which made him sick and interfered with his\n\nability to swallow medicine), forcing him to occupy a cell with a suspected homosexual,\n\noverpricing commissary items, and depriving him of medical treatment. Gannaway later\n\namended his complaint, elaborating upon his retaliation complaints, articulating\n\nharassment by various guards, and describing the theft of funds from his inmate account.\n\n         The District Court ordered Gannaway deposed; following the deposition, the\n\ndefendants moved for summary judgment.

LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">35047</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *2 n.1 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c)(2)). The\n\nremainder—those non-exhausted claims that were not resolved by the opinion, such as\n\nthe ―lack of access to the law library, lack of adequate material in the library, lack of\n\nsanitary food, and alleged tampering with mail and untimely delivery of mail,‖ id. at\n\n*6—were severed from the complaint and dismissed, with ―leave to pursue these claims\n\nafter exhausting administrative remedies.‖ Id. at *2 n.1.\n\n       We recognize that the style of Gannaway‘s complaint renders difficult the process\n\nof determining proper exhaustion. However, at this late date, it is unlikely that he would\n\nbe able to exhaust remaining administrative remedies. According to the BCJ handbook,\n\nan initial grievance must be filed within 30 days of the grievable incident. BCJ Inmate\n\nHandbook § 9.3.6 (2005). The general turnaround time is 15 days, as is the timeframe for\n\nfiling appeals of adverse decisions. Id. § 9.3.7–3.8. Therefore, in order to simplify our\n\nreview and definitively address Gannaway‘s claims, we will analyze them under a\n                                              4\n\fsummary-judgment framework on the merits.\n\n                                            IV.\n\nA) Disciplinary Segregation Claims\n\n       Many of Gannaway‘s complaints relate to prison policies—specific, written\n\npolicies, described at length in the prison handbook and in the ―Disciplinary and Security\n\nHousing Unit‖ orientation materials—governing confinement in disciplinary segregation.\n\nDeveloped in response to the problem of inmates seeking disciplinary segregation for its\n\nbenefits (such as single-cell status and delivery of meals), the programs were designed to\n\nmake residing in the segregation unit less appealing; according to the Warden, they are\n\nbehavioral modification plans and are not intended to be punitive. Decl. of George A.\n\nWagner. Penalties include a temporary mattress restriction during daylight hours (lifted\n\nwithin seven days if the inmate displays appropriate behavior) and a diet consisting of\n\nNutraloaf.\n\n       It was these two aspects of disciplinary confinement that Gannaway attacked most\n\ndirectly. He argued that the deprivation of a mattress exacerbated a prior back injury.\n\nGannaway also claimed that he was rendered physically ill by the Nutraloaf, which he\n\ndescribed as unpalatable and poorly prepared, but that ―they‖ refused to give him real\n\nfood, and he was therefore unable to take his medicine; moreover, he was ―entitle[d] to\n\nknow what he [was] eating.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Neither claim has merit under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments. 2 Gannaway\n\ndid not inform prison officials of his difficulty keeping down the Nutraloaf, despite\n\ncomplaining about the indignity of the meal on numerous occasions. He has therefore\n\nnot shown the requisite deliberate indifference needed to prevail on summary judgment\n\nor at trial. Farmer v.

The restrictions pass muster.\n\nThey are moderate, limited in duration, and ―reward‖ good behavior—all consonant with\n\nthe behavioral-modification goals highlighted by the defendants.\n\n\nB) Religious Restrictions\n\n       Gannaway claimed that the BCJ fails to ―acknowledge the Ramadan month,‖ and\n\nthat officials told him he ―couldn‘t practice[] [his] religious belief[s]‖ as a Muslim.\n\n\n3\n  His claims of rapid weight loss, which might otherwise alert officials to the existence of\na serious medical issue, are not supported by the record.\n                                              7\n\fSpecific incidents he cited included an alleged failure to provide him with suitable fast-\n\nbreaking food for Ramadan and an episode where he was prevented from attending a\n\nreligious service, ostensibly for misbehavior.\n\n       These claims find no support in the record; indeed, the defendants submitted a\n\nRamadan-fast participant list, to which Gannaway was a signatory. Similarly, there is no\n\nevidence that Nutraloaf was an unacceptable food for breaking the fast, or that being\n\ndeprived attendance at a single service constituted a substantial burden on Gannaway‘s\n\nability to practice his religion, see Hernandez v. Comm‘r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112271\"><a href=\"/opinion/112271/hernandez-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 699 (1989).\n\nAccordingly, Gannaway has failed to meet his burden under the First Amendment‘s Free\n\nExercise clause or the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.

During his deposition, he clarified that he was, in\n\nfact, wearing his shorts the entire time, and that the search was conducted due to a\n\nproblem elsewhere on the block. See Gannaway Dep. 218:8–219:8. He also said that the\n\nlength of time he was standing exacerbated his back injury, causing him some pain, but\n\nthat the Lieutenant he informed responded ―too bad.‖ Id. 220:9; see also id. 218:18–19.\n\n       This claim lacks viability under the Fourth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nGannaway cannot show that this search was unreasonable, especially in the aftermath of\n                                             8\n\fan actual incident to which authorities were responding.

Nor\n\nhas Gannaway met either the subjective or objective prongs required to demonstrate an\n\nEighth or Fourteenth Amendment violation with regard to his back pain, Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. at 834—and, regardless, the record demonstrates that he was on medication for pain\n\nthroughout the duration of his confinement.\n\n\nD) Retaliation\n\n       Gannaway maintained that his periods in disciplinary confinement, and the\n\nmisconducts issued against him, were the result of retaliatory harassment. However, he\n\nhas shown no ―causal link between the exercise of his constitutional rights and the\n\nadverse action taken against him.‖ Rauser v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772202\"><a href=\"/opinion/772202/henry-rauser-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (3d Cir. 2001). To\n\nthe contrary, Gannaway repeatedly violated BCJ policies. See BCJ Inmate Handbook\n\n§ 2.5 (prohibiting the possession of, and alteration of, items belonging to another); id.\n\n§ 3.5.2 (―You are required to consume prescription medication in the presence of medical\n\npersonnel. Staff are permitted to examine your mouth to ensure compliance.‖); id. § 7.4\n\n(describing various acts of misconduct, including ―harassment by communication,‖\n\nencompassing abuse of the grievance and internal-communications processes).\n\nNothing in the record suggests that Gannaway‘s conduct, assuming arguendo its\n\nconstitutionality, was a ―‗substantial or motivating factor‘ in the decision to discipline\n\nhim.‖ Rauser, 241 F.3d at 333 (quoting Mount Healthy Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n                                              <span class=\"page\">9</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f275, 287 (1977)).4 Lacking this essential connection, he cannot prevail.\n\n\nE) Racial Comments\n\n       Gannaway contends that he was subjected to racial epithets by guards and other\n\nprison personnel. But it is well settled that ―[t]he use of racially derogatory language,\n\nwhile unprofessional and deplorable, does not violate the Constitution. Standing alone,\n\nsimple verbal harassment does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, deprive a\n\nprisoner of a protected liberty interest or deny a prisoner equal protection of the laws.‖\n\nDeWalt v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770154\"><a href=\"/opinion/770154/anthony-dewalt-v-lamark-carter-correctional-officer-young-carol-biester/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612 (7th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). As Gannaway\n\nhas alleged nothing more than verbal harassment (and one occurrence of an undirected\n\nracial epithet carved on a cell door by unknown parties), he cannot recover on this claim.\n\n\nF) Legal Mail\n\n       Gannaway claimed that he was denied access to the courts due to limited law-\n\nlibrary availability; inadequate materials available therein; and instances of tampering\n\nwith, delaying, and disrupting his legal mail. He alleged that a habeas petition was\n\ndenied as untimely due to this inference with his ability to prepare a legal case.\n\nGannaway Dep. 119:19–20; see also Oliver v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743496\"><a href=\"/opinion/743496/lorenzo-oliver-v-william-fauver-commissioner-of-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n\n4\n  Other ―harassment‖ identified by Gannaway is simply too vague to support\nconstitutional relief. For example, he accused CO Castro of making sexual overtures, but\nwas only able to cite a single incident where Castro requested that Gannaway stand in his\ncell while the latter was naked—too little to be considered a genuine issue of material\nfact.\n                                             10\n\fBut to prevail on a First Amendment access argument, Gannaway must show the\n\nunderlying lost claim to have been nonfrivolous. Christopher v. Harbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n414–15 (2002). Gannaway‘s ―habeas‖ petition was filed pro se (despite his having\n\ncounsel), in state court, during the pendency of his state criminal trial. It does not appear\n\nto have been denied on timeliness grounds, and Gannaway has not otherwise shown its\n\nmerit. Accordingly, his access claim must fail.5\n\n       To the extent that his legal mail claim is premised on his First Amendment free-\n\nspeech rights, he has not shown a pattern or practice concerning legal mail that is\n\nunrelated to a legitimate penological interest. Jones v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795519\"><a href=\"/opinion/795519/ronald-c-jones-v-m-brown-internal-affairs-ofc-s-sootkoos-associate/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359–60 (3d\n\nCir. 2006). Nor does he point to any prison program or policy that would impinge on his\n\nFirst Amendment right to expression with regard to mail or other communications of a\n\nnon-legal character. See Nasir v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784257\"><a href=\"/opinion/784257/nasir-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 376–77 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n\nG) Medical Treatment\n\n       Gannaway insisted that he received inadequate medical treatment, assailing the\n\nqualifications of various BCJ physicians. Gannaway Dep. 321:20–24. But evidence in\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Moreover, Gannaway made clear in his deposition that he was not denied access to the\nlaw library; rather, his time was simply limited in a way that he personally found to be\nunacceptable, and which compared unfavorably to the policies of other county jails.\nGannaway Dep. 187:23–188:4. See Lewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355 (1996)\n(emphasizing that prisons must provide tools ―that the inmates need in order to attack\ntheir sentences, directly or collaterally, and in order to challenge the conditions of their\n                                             11\n\fthe record demonstrates that he received continuous medical treatment for a variety of\n\nailments, and ―mere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment,‖ without more,\n\ncannot support a claim of unconstitutional wrongdoing. Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Inst.\n\nInmates v. Lanzaro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498141\"><a href=\"/opinion/498141/monmouth-county-correctional-institutional-inmates-kevin-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\n\nH) Financial Deductions\n\n       Gannaway accused the BCJ of taking money from his prison account without his\n\npermission and without notice. Inmates have a property interest in funds held in prison\n\naccounts, and therefore are entitled to due process with respect to those funds. Reynolds\n\nv. Wagner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747610\"><a href=\"/opinion/747610/richard-reynolds-david-borrell-rolando-felix-julio-aracho-robert-santillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179 (3d Cir. 1997). But all of the deductions about which he\n\ncomplains were explained to him by the BCJ. For example, he didn‘t ―see the relevance‖\n\nof why he was charged for a disciplinary hearing, Gannaway Dep. 161:21–23, ignoring\n\nthe clear warning in the prison handbook regarding disciplinary hearing penalties, see\n\nBCJ Inmate Handbook § 4.3. Gannaway also fails to realize that many other deductions\n\nderive from the filing fees he currently owes this Court (and others) for proceeding in\n\nforma pauperis in earlier civil suits. Other complaints involve failure to issue prompt\n\nreceipts, a claim that is at best ancillary to any actual constitutional harm. The record\n\nsupports summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n       To the extent that Gannaway raised a claim regarding overpriced items in the\n\n\n\nconfinement. Impairment of any other litigating capacity is simply one of the incidental\n(and perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and incarceration‖).\n                                             12\n\fprison commissary, his allegations were entirely conclusory and devoid of factual support\n\nand, as such, could not sustain the charge.\n\n\nI) Clogged Toilet\n\n       To the extent that Gannaway‘s complaint can be read to assert a constitutional\n\nviolation in connection with a clogged toilet in his cell, the record shows that the toilet\n\nwas partly functional; it simply required frequent plunging. Gannaway decided that he\n\nno longer wished to plunge the toilet during the period while the BCJ awaited the arrival\n\nof an available plumber. The result cannot fairly be attributed to the BCJ.\n\n\nJ) Destruction of Property\n\n       To the extent that Gannaway complained that his property was damaged,\n\nconfiscated, or destroyed by BCJ employees, he cannot prevail, as adequate state post-\n\ndeprivation remedies were available. See Hudson v. Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533 (1984);\n\nTillman v.

He termed the prison a ―corrupted body,‖ one that\n\n―stick[s] together.‖ Gannaway Dep. 176:2–3. ―In order to prevail on a conspiracy claim\n\nunder § 1983, a plaintiff must prove that persons acting under color of state law conspired\n\nto deprive him of a federally protected right.‖ Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v.

See Tabron v.

Having found them wanting, and encountering no substantial issue on\n\nappeal, we will summarily affirm. Gannaway‘s motions for counsel are denied.
