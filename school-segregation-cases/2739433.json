Akins, the president of All Seasons, hired Red\r\nDot Corporation to construct a metal building so All Seasons could expand its operations.  A dispute\r\narose due to Akins' belief that the construction was unnecessarily delayed and was slipshod.  While\r\nthe dispute only concerned approximately $5,000.00, Akins withheld the entire final payment. \r\nFollowing a bench trial, the trial court found that Akins breached the contract and that he owed Red\r\nDot $143,800.44, plus interest for approximately three years, and $105,369.95 in attorney's fees.  All\r\nSeasons and Akins appeal the judgment of the trial court, and Red Dot has filed a cross-appeal.  We\r\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and modify in part.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>All Seasons and Akins raise fifteen points of error on appeal.  Red Dot responded with six\r\nreply points and raises two cross-points of error.  We have consolidated the issues as follows: \r\n(1) Does All Seasons have standing to bring this appeal?  (2) Did the trial court err in finding the\r\ncontract interest rate was ten percent rather than eighteen percent?  (3) Did the trial court err in\r\nconcluding that interest should begin to accrue December 11, 2001?  (4) Did the trial court err in\r\nrefusing to find the contract usurious?  (5) Did the trial court err in offsetting the judgment against\r\nAkins with All Seasons' $38.56 counterclaim?  (6) Is the evidence sufficient to support the amount\r\nof the attorney's fees awarded? </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>While All Seasons lacks standing to bring a claim for usury, it does have standing to pursue\r\nits counterclaim for $38.56.  The trial court erred in finding the contractual interest rate was ten\r\npercent.  The contract authorized interest at the maximum rate allowed by law, and the law allows\r\ninterest up to eighteen percent.  Therefore, the contractual interest rate should have been eighteen\r\npercent.  Although legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the trial court's finding that\r\nconstruction was completed October 24, 2001, the trial court erred in holding that interest should\r\naccrue from December 11, 2004.  Interest should accrue from October 24, 2001, because the final\r\npayment was due on completion of erection.  Red Dot did not commit usury.  Last, there is sufficient\r\nevidence to support the attorney's fees award except for the award of paralegal fees and expenses.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>I.<span>         </span>Facts</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>This case concerns a dispute over the construction of an industrial metal building.  Akins,\r\nthe president of All Seasons, owned the property on which the building was constructed.  All\r\nSeasons, which was in the window manufacturing business, leased the property from Akins.  Due\r\nto an increase in business, All Seasons needed additional room for its manufacturing facility.  Akins\r\ncontracted with Red Dot to erect a metal building in order to expand the space being used by All\r\nSeasons.  Red Dot was responsible for the construction of the metal building, while Akins retained\r\nresponsibility for the remainder of the project, including concrete, electrical, plumbing, and finishing\r\nout the interior.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>On March 5, 2001, Akins signed a contract with Red Dot.  With the \"change orders,\" the\r\ncontract price totaled $400,771.00.  The contract included provisions detailing each party's duties,\r\na payment schedule, and provided for payment of reasonable attorney's fees in the event of a dispute. \r\nConstruction was to begin August 14, 2001.  Due to rain delays, construction actually began one\r\nweek later.  Red Dot failed to deliver sufficient anchor bolts to be incorporated into the concrete. \r\nAll Seasons had to purchase the additional bolts, which forms the basis of the $38.56 counterclaim\r\nby All Seasons.  During the construction, there were various problems, including column placement,\r\nloose bolts, delays in delivery of materials, understaffing by the erection subcontractor, and defects\r\nin the insulation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Akins alleges the building should have been completed in August.  Red Dot completed the\r\nerection of the building October 24, 2001.  However, Red Dot returned to tighten bolts, fix\r\ninsulation, incorporate an additional beam, and address other issues at the request of Akins and/or\r\nAll Seasons.  On December 11, 2001, the final walk-through with a punch list was conducted and\r\nAkins agreed to accept the project, with the understanding that additional repairs were to be made. \r\nSome repairs were completed December 11.  Red Dot agreed to make the additional repairs, but\r\nnever has. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Pursuant to the contract, Akins paid ten percent of the contract price on signing the contract. \r\nAkins paid $218,300.00 on September 14, 2001, for the delivery of materials.  On October 24, 2001,\r\nRed Dot sent Akins an invoice for final payment in the amount of $143,839.00.  On December 12,\r\n2001, Akins tendered a check for $138,873.49 marked \"payment in full.\"  In a letter accompanying\r\nthe check, Akins informed Red Dot that the deductions were due to increased security costs caused\r\nby delays in construction, the cost of pouring new footers for twelve columns, and the cost of the\r\nanchor bolts.  Red Dot refused to accept the check when Akins refused to remove the \"payment in\r\nfull\" language.  When the parties could not reach an agreement concerning the final invoice, Red Dot\r\nfiled a mechanic's lien on the building and sought eighteen percent interest on the invoice.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Eventually, Akins sued Red Dot for usury, to quiet title, for breach of contract, and\r\nharassment.  Following a bench trial,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> the trial court found that Akins signed the contract in his\r\nindividual capacity and had breached the contract.  The trial court entered several detailed findings\r\nof fact.  The trial court found Red Dot was justified in refusing to accept the check marked \"payment\r\nin full\" and that Red Dot had only received $256,932.00 of the $400,771.00 due under the contract. \r\nThe trial court also found that the contract was ambiguous concerning whether Akins signed in his\r\nindividual or personal capacity and determined that Akins signed in his personal capacity.  The trial\r\ncourt held that the contract, which stated interest would be charged at the maximum rate allowed by\r\nlaw, authorized interest at the rate of ten percent.  Although Red Dot had sought to collect eighteen\r\npercent interest, the trial court found that Red Dot had not committed usury.  The trial court\r\nconcluded that the transaction was not a loan or forbearance of money.  The trial court rendered\r\njudgment that Red Dot recover from Akins $143,800.44 in actual damages, $33,921.14 in contract\r\ninterest, attorney's fees, postjudgment interest, and costs.  Akins appealed to this Court, and Red Dot\r\nhas filed a cross-appeal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>II.<span>       </span>All Seasons has Standing</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>As a preliminary matter, Red Dot argues All Seasons lacks standing.  Since the trial court\r\nfound All Seasons was not a party to the contract, Red Dot contends All Seasons does not have a\r\ncognizable interest in this appeal.  Although All Seasons lacks standing to pursue its usury claims\r\non appeal, All Seasons has standing to be a party to the appeal due to its claim for the cost of the\r\nanchor bolts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Standing is a constitutional prerequisite to maintaining a suit under Texas law.  <i>Tex. Ass'n\r\nof Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd.</i>, 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex. 1993).  Standing, as a necessary\r\ncomponent of a court's subject-matter jurisdiction, cannot be waived and can be raised for the first\r\ntime on appeal.  <i>Id</i>.  Standing requires the claimant to demonstrate a particularized injury distinct\r\nfrom that suffered by the general public.  <i>Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue</i>, 34 S.W.3d 547, 555–56\r\n(Tex. 2000); <i>see Rodgers v. RAB Inv., Ltd.</i>, 816 S.W.2d 543, 546 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991, no writ). \r\nThe claimant must have an actual grievance, not one that is merely hypothetical or generalized. \r\n<i>Brown v. Todd</i>, 53 S.W.3d 297, 302 (Tex. 2001).  We review de novo the issue of standing.  <i>Tex.\r\nDep't of Transp. v. City of Sunset Valley</i>, 146 S.W.3d 637, 646 (Tex. 2004). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Red Dot argues All Seasons lacks standing to pursue its usury claim because All Seasons was\r\nnot a party to the contract.  All Seasons and Akins have consistently claimed All Seasons was not\r\na party to the contract.  Because All Seasons successfully persuaded the trial court it was not a party\r\nto the contract, Red Dot argues it lacks standing to appeal based on usury.  Usury remedies are\r\npersonal to the debtor and restricted to the parties to the transaction.  <i>See Houston Sash &amp; Door Co.</i>\r\n<i>v. Heaner</i>, 577 S.W.2d 217, 222 (Tex. 1979); <i>W. Bank-Downtown v. Carline</i>, 757 S.W.2d 111, 115\r\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, writ denied); <i>see also</i> <span>Tex. Fin. Code Ann.</span> § 305.001\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2005).  Only the obligor has standing to assert a usury claim.  <i>Weisfeld v. Tex. Land\r\nFin. Co.</i>, 162 S.W.3d 379, 381 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.).  Since the trial court found that\r\nAll Seasons was not a party to the contract and that finding has not been challenged on appeal, All\r\nSeasons lacks standing to pursue usury claims against Red Dot.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>However, All Seasons does have standing to pursue its counterclaim for $38.56.  Red Dot\r\nargues All Seasons failed to plead any theory to justify recovery of the $38.56, which All Seasons\r\npaid for the missing anchor bolts.  Although All Seasons pled breach of contract, the $38.56 cannot\r\nbe recovered through breach of contract because the trial court found that All Seasons was not a\r\nparty to the contract.  Standing is a distinct concept from capacity to sue.  <i>Roman Forest Pub. Util.\r\nDist. No. 4 v. McCorkle</i>, 999 S.W.2d 931, 932 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1999, pet. denied) (public\r\nutility district had standing despite lack of damages, ownership of land, etc.).  Whether All Seasons\r\nfailed to plead a cause of action is not relevant to whether All Seasons has standing.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  The issue of\r\nstanding is concerned with whether the claimant has a particularized injury distinct from that\r\nsuffered by the general public.  <i>Blue</i>, 34 S.W.3d at 555–56.  All Seasons has a particularized injury\r\ndistinct from that suffered by the general public and, therefore, the claim of $38.56 gives All Seasons\r\nstanding to appeal.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Although All Seasons does not have standing to bring usury claims against Red Dot, All\r\nSeasons does have standing to be a party to the suit.  We overrule Red Dot's counterpoint.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>III.<span>      </span>Red Dot Established the Contractual Interest Rate Is Eighteen Percent As a Matter of\r\nLaw</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Red Dot and Akins both challenge the trial court's finding concerning the amount of interest\r\nauthorized by the contract.  The trial court found that the interest under the contract, which provided\r\nfor interest at the maximum rate allowed by law, was ten percent.  In its cross-appeal, Red Dot\r\nclaims the contract authorized interest at the rate of eighteen percent.  Akins argues the interest rate\r\nunder the contract should have been six percent.  We review de novo the trial court's conclusion. \r\n<i>See In re Humphreys</i>, 880 S.W.2d 402, 403 (Tex. 1994). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The contract provides that \"[a]ll deferred payments shall bear interest from the time they are\r\ndue until paid at the maximum rate permitted by the applicable law.\"  All Seasons and Akins argue\r\nthat the contract rate is six percent because the contract does not specify a rate of interest.  Section\r\n302.002 of the Texas Finance Code provides as follows:  \"If a creditor has not agreed with an obligor\r\nto charge the obligor any interest, the creditor may charge and receive from the obligor legal interest\r\nat the rate of six percent a year . . . .\"  <span>Tex. Fin. Code Ann. </span>§ 302.002 (Vernon Supp. 2005).  When\r\na contract does not specify a rate of interest, the statutory rate of six percent is read into the\r\nagreement and becomes the maximum rate allowed on the transaction.  <i>Id</i>.; <i>Broady v. Johnson</i>, 763\r\nS.W.2d 832, 834 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1988, no writ).  All Seasons and Akins cite <i>Tubelite v.\r\nRisica</i> <i>&amp; Sons, Inc.</i>, 819 S.W.2d 801, 805 (Tex. 1991), for the proposition that a rate greater than six\r\npercent is usurious when the parties do not specify a rate.  <i>Tubelite</i> is distinguishable because in that\r\ncase the contract entirely omitted any reference to interest. <i> Id</i>.  Although an acknowledgment sent\r\nafter the formation of the contract provided for interest and late charges, the contract formed made\r\nno reference to interest or late charges.  <i>Id</i>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>In this case, the contract provided for interest, although it did not specify a numerical amount. \r\nThe contract provided that interest would be charged \"at the maximum rate permitted by law.\"  The\r\nBeaumont and Tyler Courts of Appeals have held the lack of a numerical rate of interest does not\r\nestablish six percent as the correct interest rate.  <i>See Whitehead Utils., Inc. v. Emery Fin. Corp</i>., 697\r\nS.W.2d 460, 461 (Tex. App.—Beaumont  1985, no writ) (holding that Article 5069-1.03, a precursor\r\nto Section 302.002, does not apply when the parties contracted for the \"highest contract rate of\r\ninterest Lessor may charge lessee under applicable law . . . .\"); <i>cf. Bundrick v. First Nat'l Bank of\r\nJacksonville</i>, 570 S.W.2d 12, 15 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (allowing collection\r\nof the maximum legal rate of interest for a contract that provided for \"interest at the highest legal\r\ncontract rate from the date of such default . . . .\"); <i>AU Pharm., Inc. v. Boston</i>, 986 S.W.2d 331, 334\r\n(Tex. App.—Texarkana 1999, no pet.) (Section 302.002 does not apply when parties agreed to zero\r\npercent interest).  When the parties have agreed to a standard for the rate of interest, which can be\r\ndetermined by reasonable calculations, Section 302.002 is inapplicable.  <i>See Whitehead Utils., Inc</i>,\r\n697 S.W.2d 462.  We agree with the Beaumont and Tyler Courts of Appeals that the default interest\r\nrate of Section 305.001 does not apply.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>In the alternative, Akins argues ten percent interest is the maximum rate authorized by law. \r\nRed Dot claims that eighteen percent interest is authorized by two different statutes.  First, Red Dot\r\nargues that Section 303.009(a) authorizes eighteen percent interest.  Second, Red Dot contends that\r\nSection 28.004 of the Texas Property Code applies.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Traditionally, the Texas Finance Code capped at ten percent the interest rate for which an\r\nindividual could contract.  Section 302.001 provides that \"[t]he maximum rate or amount of interest\r\nis 10 percent a year except as otherwise provided by law.\"  <span>Tex. Fin. Code Ann. </span>§ 302.001(b)\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2005).  While the prior scheme still exists, the 1981 amendments to the Texas\r\nFinance Code superimposed an alternative rate ceiling on the prior scheme.  28 <span>Stephen Cochran,\r\nTexas Practice:  Consumer Rights and Remedies </span>§ 11.4 (3d ed. 2002).  The optional rate\r\nceilings provide a floating ceiling based on formulas determined by the twenty-six week United\r\nStates Treasury Bills.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Unless a higher rate is allowed by another law,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> the scheme includes a\r\nminimum ceiling, which applies if the floating ceiling is lower than the minimum ceiling, and a\r\nmaximum ceiling, which applies if the floating ceiling is higher than the maximum ceiling.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Under the optional rate ceilings, the highest amount authorized by Texas law was at least\r\neighteen percent.  \"The parties to a written agreement may agree to an interest rate . . . that does not\r\nexceed the applicable weekly ceiling.\"  <span>Tex. Fin. Code Ann. </span>§ 303.002  (Vernon Supp. 2005). \r\nAlthough Red Dot failed to prove the ceilings were eighteen percent, this Court could take judicial\r\nnotice of the applicable ceilings.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  However, there is no need to take judicial notice of the weekly\r\nrates because the minimum ceiling is eighteen percent and Red Dot never sought to charge interest\r\ngreater than eighteen percent.  The Texas Finance Code allows interest of at least eighteen percent.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>In addition, the Texas Property Code authorizes eighteen percent interest.  Section 28.004\r\nof the Texas Property Code provides:</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>                        </span>(a)  An unpaid amount required under this chapter begins to accrue interest\r\non the day after the date on which the payment becomes due.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(b)  An unpaid amount bears interest at the rate of 1 1/2 percent each month.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(c)  Interest on an unpaid amount stops accruing under this section on the\r\nearlier of:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(1)the date of delivery;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(2)the date of mailing, if payment is mailed and delivery occurs\r\nwithin three days; or</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(3)the date a judgment is entered in an action brought under this\r\nchapter.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Tex.

Red Dot alleges the erection was completed by October 24,\r\n2001, but Akins argues the building was not completed until December 11, 2001.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  The trial court\r\nfound the construction of the buildings was completed by October 24, 2001, but Red Dot \"completed\r\nvarious punch-list items brought to its attention by Akins, to the satisfaction of Akins, by\r\nDecember 11, 2001.\"  The trial court concluded interest should accrue from December 11, 2001. \r\nThere is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that construction was completed by\r\nOctober 24, 2001.  However, the trial court erred in concluding interest should accrue from\r\nDecember 11, 2001.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Findings of fact entered in a case tried to the court are of the same force and dignity as a\r\njury's answers to jury questions.  <i>Anderson v. City of Seven Points</i>, 806 S.W.2d 791, 794 (Tex.\r\n1991).  The trial court's findings of fact are reviewable for evidentiary sufficiency by the same\r\nstandards that are applied in reviewing evidentiary sufficiency to support a jury's verdict.  <i>Ortiz v.\r\nJones</i>, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>When deciding a legal sufficiency point concerning a fact issue, we must consider all the\r\nevidence in the record in the light most favorable to the party in whose favor the verdict has been\r\nrendered, and we must apply every reasonable inference that could be made from the evidence in that\r\nparty's favor.  <i>Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. v. Havner</i>, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997).  We\r\ndisregard all evidence and inferences to the contrary.  <i>Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye</i>, 907 S.W.2d\r\n497, 499 (Tex. 1995).  A no-evidence point will be sustained when (a) there is a complete absence\r\nof evidence of a vital fact; (b) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight\r\nto the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (c) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no\r\nmore than a mere scintilla; or (d) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact. \r\n<i>Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez</i>, 977 S.W.2d 328, 334 (Tex. 1998).  More than a scintilla\r\nof evidence exists if the evidence furnishes some reasonable basis for differing conclusions by\r\nreasonable minds about the existence of a vital fact.  <i>Rocor Int'l, Inc. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co.</i>,\r\n77 S.W.3d 253, 262 (Tex. 2002).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>If we find some probative evidence, we will test the factual sufficiency of that evidence by\r\nexamining the entire record to determine whether the finding is clearly wrong and unjust.  When\r\nconsidering a factual sufficiency challenge to a jury's verdict, courts of appeals must consider and\r\nweigh all of the evidence, not just that evidence which supports the verdict.  <i>Mar. Overseas Corp.\r\nv. Ellis</i>, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406–07 (Tex. 1998).  A court of appeals may set aside the verdict only if\r\nit is so contrary to the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that the verdict is clearly\r\nwrong and unjust.  <i>Id.</i> at 407; <i>Cain v. Bain</i>, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986).  The court of appeals\r\nis not a fact-finder.  Accordingly, the court of appeals may not pass on the witnesses' credibility or\r\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder, even if the evidence would clearly support a\r\ndifferent result. <i> Ellis</i>, 971 S.W.2d at 407. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>This issue basically turns on when the final payment was due.  Red Dot argues the final\r\npayment was due when the building was completed October 24, 2001.  According to Red Dot, the\r\ncontract required payment of the balance on \"completion of erection.\"  While the contract does\r\nprovide that the final payment is due on \"completion of erection,\" it does not define what completion\r\nof erection means.  The contract provides:  \"Terms of Payment:  Unless changed by the terms of a\r\npayment schedule above, materials are to be invoiced on date of shipment for contract value of each\r\nshipment.  Erection charges are to be invoiced when erection is complete . . . .\"  Earlier in the\r\ncontract, the contract provides as follows:</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Terms of payment:<span>     </span>$38,632.00 <span>     </span>with order</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>                                                </span>224,308.00 <span>     </span>material delivery</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>                                                </span><span>123,375.00 </span><span>     </span>completion of erection</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>                                    </span>          $386,315.00<span>       </span>TOTAL</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>Courts should give terms their plain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning, unless the contract\r\nindicates otherwise.  <i>Heritage Res., Inc. v. NationsBank</i>, 939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex. 1996).  Under\r\nthe plain language of the contract, the final payment was due on completion of the erection.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The evidence is sufficient to support the trial court's finding that construction was completed\r\nby October 24, 2001.  Ronald Acree, a subcontractor for Red Dot, testified the building was\r\ncomplete October 24, 2001.  This arises to more than a scintilla of evidence that erection was\r\ncomplete by October 24, 2001.  While there is some evidence the building was not complete in all\r\nrespects, the trial court's finding is not so contrary to the great weight and preponderance of the\r\nevidence that it is clearly wrong or unjust.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  The evidence is legally and factually sufficient that\r\nerection was completed by October 24, 2001.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Because the trial court found construction was complete by October 24, 2001, it erred in\r\nholding interest should accrue from December 11, 2001.  When interest should begin to accrue is\r\nan issue of law, which we review de novo.  The contract provides that the final payment is due on\r\ncompletion of erection.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Since construction was complete October 24, 2001, interest should have\r\nbegun to accrue October 24, 2001.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>V.<span>        </span>Red Dot Did Not Commit Usury</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>In his first six points of error, Akins challenges the trial court's denial of his usury claims. \r\nAkins argues that usury was proven as a matter of law, or in the alternative, argues the evidence is\r\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court's holding.  According to Akins and All Seasons, usury\r\nwas established as a matter of law or by the great weight and preponderance of the evidence if the\r\ncontractual interest rate was six percent or even ten percent.  As discussed above, Red Dot did not\r\nattempt to charge an illegal rate of interest.  The trial court's finding is supported by legally and\r\nfactually sufficient evidence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Akins alleges the trial court erred in denying his usury claims because any interest in excess\r\nof ten percent is usury in Texas.  Section 305.001 of the Texas Finance Code imposes liability for\r\ncontracting for, charging, or receiving interest greater than the amount authorized by law.  Section\r\n305.001 provides as follows:  </span></p>\r\n<p><span>(a)  A creditor who contracts for, charges, or receives interest that is greater\r\nthan the amount authorized by this subtitle . . . is liable to the obligor for an amount\r\nthat is equal to the greater of:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(1)  three times the amount computed by subtracting the amount of\r\ninterest allowed by law from the total amount of interest contracted for,\r\ncharged, or received; or</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(2)  $2,000 or 20 percent of the amount of the principal, whichever is\r\nless.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Tex. Fin. Code Ann. </span>§ 305.001(a).  The solicitation of interest, through a demand letter, exceeding\r\nthat allowed by law may constitute a \"charge\" for the purposes of Section 305.001.  <i>Hoxie Implement\r\nCo. v. Baker</i>, 65 S.W.3d 140, 146 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, pet. denied).  However, as discussed\r\nabove, eighteen percent interest was permissible under Texas law.  Because the rate of interest Red\r\nDot charged was legal, Red Dot did not commit usury.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Alternatively, Akins argues Red Dot committed usury because it sought to charge interest\r\nfrom October 24, 2001, instead of December 11, 2001, and from August 14, 2001, to September 14,\r\n2001.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  The legality of the interest rate depends on when the payment was due.  Interest charged at\r\nany rate for a period contracted by the parties to be free of interest is usurious.  <i>PJM, Inc. v. Walter\r\nClark Adver., Inc.</i>, 624 S.W.2d 282, 284–85 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.); <i>see Heaner</i>,\r\n577 S.W.2d at 221.  The contract provided:  \"Terms of Payment:  Unless changed by the terms of\r\na payment schedule above, materials are to be invoiced on date of shipment for contract value of\r\neach shipment.  Erection charges are to be invoiced when erection is complete . . . .\"  Earlier in the\r\ncontract, the contract provided as follows:</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Terms of payment:<span>     </span>$38,632.00 <span>     </span>with order</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>                                                </span>224,308.00 <span>     </span>material delivery</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>                                                </span><span>123,375.00 </span><span>     </span>completion of erection</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>                                    </span>          $386,315.00<span>       </span>TOTAL</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span>Therefore, the contract required the second payment to be made on delivery of the materials.  As\r\ndiscussed above, the contract requires the final payment to be made on the completion of erection. \r\nBecause the materials were delivered August 14, 2001, and there is sufficient evidence to support\r\nthe trial court's finding that construction was completed October 24, 2001, Red Dot could charge\r\ninterest during the periods alleged.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the trial court's finding that Red Dot did\r\nnot commit usury.  The law authorizes interest to be charged at eighteen percent.  Further, Red Dot\r\ndid not commit usury when it attempted to charge interest for the periods from October 24, 2001\r\nthrough December 11, 2001, and for the tardiness of Akins' second payment, since Red Dot could,\r\nunder the contract, legally charge interest during those periods under the contract.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VI.<span>      </span>The Trial Court Erred by Deducting $38.56 from the Amount Owed by Akins</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The evidence established as a matter of law that All Seasons paid $38.56 for anchor bolts,\r\nwhich were the responsibility of Red Dot.  Acree conceded in his testimony Red Dot owed All\r\nSeasons the $38.56; e-mails introduced into evidence established there was an error in the amount\r\nof anchor bolts that were sent to the jobsite, and All Seasons introduced into evidence the receipt for\r\nthe anchor bolts.  Because All Seasons and Akins are separate entities, the trial court erred in\r\nawarding the $38.56 to Akins.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VII.<span>     </span>The Attorney's Fees Are Supported by Sufficient Evidence</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>In their seventh through thirteenth points of error, Akins and All Seasons challenge the trial\r\ncourt's award of attorney's fees to Red Dot.  In essence, Akins is complaining that the amount of the\r\nattorney's fees is excessive.  We review the award of attorney's fees for legal and factual sufficiency\r\nof the evidence.  <i>See Bocquet v. Herring</i>, 972 S.W.2d 19, 20 (Tex. 1998);<i> Stewart Title Guar. Co.\r\nv. Sterling</i>, 822 S.W.2d 1, 12 (Tex. 1991).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Attorney's fees must be based on some statutory or contractual authority.  <i>Holland v.\r\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc.</i>, 1 S.W.3d 91, 95 (Tex. 1999).  A contract may provide that the prevailing or\r\nsuccessful party in litigation arising out of the contract is entitled to recover attorney's fees from the\r\nother party.  <i>See Robbins v. Capozzi</i>, 100 S.W.3d 18, 27 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2002, no pet.).  In\r\ndetermining whether attorney's fees are reasonable, the trial court should consider the factors\r\ndiscussed in <i>Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp.</i>, 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Red Dot employed two law firms at various stages of the litigation.  Guy Harrison, Red Dot's\r\nexpert on attorney's fees, testified that Cowles &amp; Thompson billed Red Dot for $32,769.65 in\r\nattorney's fees and that Fulbright and Jaworski billed Red Dot for $87,669.95, for a total of\r\n$138,139.60.  Harrison estimated the fees that had been incurred since the last billing at $17,700.00. \r\nWithout the Cowles &amp; Thompson fees, the attorney's fees came to $105,369.95.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The trial court stated in a letter to the parties that the \"attorney's fees expended by plaintiff\r\nin connection with the Henderson County litigation to be unnecessary and unreasonable.\"</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  The trial\r\ncourt then awarded $105,369.95 for attorney's fees, the maximum fees for the remaining attorney's\r\nfees supported by the testimony of Harrison.  The trial court stated that, although the fees were\r\n\"high,\" they were not unreasonable and unnecessary.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>First, Akins argues the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees in excess of $250.00 per\r\nhour when the evidence only established that $250.00 per hour was a reasonable rate.  In general,\r\nthe reasonableness of attorney's fees is a question of fact.  <i>City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News</i>,\r\n22 S.W.3d 351, 367 (Tex. 2000).  Harrison testified that he thought $250.00 per hour was a \"more\r\nappropriate\" fee, but that $300.00 per hour could be reasonable in some circumstances.  Harrison\r\ntestified that, after adjusting rates exceeding $250.00 per hour to $250.00 per hour, Red Dot's\r\nattorney's fees came to $125,043.15.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Harrison's testimony that that amount was reasonable and that\r\nthe case was not \"overstaffed,\" is some evidence the attorney's fees are reasonable and necessary. \r\nFurther, the great weight and preponderance of the evidence does not indicate the attorney's fees are\r\nunreasonable.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Second, Akins argues the trial court erred in awarding recovery of paralegal fees and other\r\nexpenses in the award of attorney's fees.  An award of attorney's fees may include a legal assistant's\r\ntime to the extent that the work performed \"has traditionally been done by any attorney.\"  <i>Clary\r\nCorp. v. Smith</i>, 949 S.W.2d 452, 469 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1997, writ denied); <i>Gill Sav. Ass'n\r\nv. Int'l Supply Co.</i>, 759 S.W.2d 697, 702 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988, writ denied).  To recover\r\nattorney's fees for work performed by legal assistants, \"the evidence must establish:  (1) the\r\nqualifications of the legal assistant to perform substantive legal work; (2) that the legal assistant\r\nperformed substantive legal work under the direction and supervision of an attorney; (3) the nature\r\nof the legal work performed; (4) the legal assistant's hourly rate; and (5) the number of hours\r\nexpended by the legal assistant.\"<i>  Multi-Moto Corp. v. ITT Commercial Fin. Corp</i>., 806 S.W.2d 560,\r\n570 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1990, writ denied); <i>see Gill Sav. Ass'n</i>, 759 S.W.2d at 704–05.  Because\r\nthere was no evidence concerning the legal assistants other than the hourly rate and number of hours\r\nexpended, we modify the award of attorney's fees in the amount of $4,819.50 for work performed\r\nby legal assistants.  Red Dot has failed to provide any authority for the award of expenses to this\r\nCourt or the trial court.  Attorney's fees must be based on some statutory or contractual authority. \r\n<i>Holland</i>, 1 S.W.3d at 95.  Because Red Dot had the burden of proving its attorney's fees were\r\nreasonable and failed to prove it was entitled to the expenses, we modify the award for expenses by\r\n$2,377.95.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Third, Akins argues the attorney's fees are unreasonable because the actual amount in \r\ncontroversy was only $4,926.95.  While the attorney's fees may be excessive if Akins had paid the\r\namount not in dispute under the contract, Akins never tendered the amount not in dispute to Red Dot. \r\nThe amount in controversy was actually $143,839.00.  Therefore, we cannot conclude the amount\r\nin dispute indicates the attorney's fees are unreasonable.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>All Seasons argues, because it prevailed on its counterclaim for $38.56, it is entitled to\r\nattorney's fees.  All Seasons failed to segregate which portion of its attorney's fees concerned the\r\ncounterclaim.  Although there was no objection to the failure to segregate,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> an award of $29,511.29\r\nfor attorney's fees for a $38.56 claim is clearly unreasonable.  The trial court did not err in refusing\r\nto award attorney's fees for the $38.56 counterclaim.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Last, All Seasons and Akins argue the trial court erred in failing to condition the attorney's\r\nfees awarded for the appeal on the appeal being successful.  An award for attorney's fees for an\r\nappeal should be conditioned on a successful appeal.  <i>Westech Eng'g, Inc. v. Clearwater\r\nConstructors, Inc</i>., 835 S.W.2d 190, 205 (Tex. App.—Austin 1992, no writ).  We modify the\r\njudgment to reflect that Red Dot is only eligible to receive attorney's fees for its appeal if its appeal\r\nof the breach of contract issues is successful.  <i>See J.C. Penney Life Ins. Co. v. Heinrich</i>, 32 S.W.3d\r\n280, 290 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2000, pet. denied). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The trial court awarded the maximum attorney's fees supported by the testimony.  Therefore,\r\nthe award must have included the fees for paralegals and expenses.  Because there is no evidence\r\nRed Dot was entitled to the paralegal fees and expenses, we modify the award by $7,197.45.  We\r\nmodify the judgment to condition attorney's fees for appeal on the success of that appeal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VIII.<span>   </span>Conclusion</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>We affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse in part, and modify in part. \r\nAlthough All Seasons lacks standing for its usury claims, All Seasons has standing based on its claim\r\nfor the amount it spent on anchor bolts.  The trial court erred in finding the interest rate under the\r\ncontract was ten percent.  We modify the judgment that the interest rate under the contract was\r\neighteen percent.  We affirm the trial court's finding that construction was complete October 24,\r\n2001, but modify the ruling that interest should accrue from October 24, 2001.

Akins, the president of All Seasons, hired Red\r\nDot Corporation to construct a metal building so All Seasons could expand its operations.  A dispute\r\narose due to Akins' belief that the construction was unnecessarily delayed and was slipshod.  While\r\nthe dispute only concerned approximately $5,000.00, Akins withheld the entire final payment. \r\nFollowing a bench trial, the trial court found that Akins breached the contract and that he owed Red\r\nDot $143,800.44, plus interest for approximately three years, and $105,369.95 in attorney's fees.  All\r\nSeasons and Akins appeal the judgment of the trial court, and Red Dot has filed a cross-appeal.  We\r\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and modify in part.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>All Seasons and Akins raise fifteen points of error on appeal.  Red Dot responded with six\r\nreply points and raises two cross-points of error.  We have consolidated the issues as follows: \r\n(1) Does All Seasons have standing to bring this appeal?  (2) Did the trial court err in finding the\r\ncontract interest rate was ten percent rather than eighteen percent?  (3) Did the trial court err in\r\nconcluding that interest should begin to accrue December 11, 2001?  (4) Did the trial court err in\r\nrefusing to find the contract usurious?  (5) Did the trial court err in offsetting the judgment against\r\nAkins with All Seasons' $38.56 counterclaim?  (6) Is the evidence sufficient to support the amount\r\nof the attorney's fees awarded? </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>While All Seasons lacks standing to bring a claim for usury, it does have standing to pursue\r\nits counterclaim for $38.56.  The trial court erred in finding the contractual interest rate was ten\r\npercent.  The contract authorized interest at the maximum rate allowed by law, and the law allows\r\ninterest up to eighteen percent.  Therefore, the contractual interest rate should have been eighteen\r\npercent.  Although legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the trial court's finding that\r\nconstruction was completed October 24, 2001, the trial court erred in holding that interest should\r\naccrue from December 11, 2004.  Interest should accrue from October 24, 2001, because the final\r\npayment was due on completion of erection.  Red Dot did not commit usury.  Last, there is sufficient\r\nevidence to support the attorney's fees award except for the award of paralegal fees and expenses.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>I.<span>         </span>Facts</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>This case concerns a dispute over the construction of an industrial metal building.  Akins,\r\nthe president of All Seasons, owned the property on which the building was constructed.  All\r\nSeasons, which was in the window manufacturing business, leased the property from Akins.  Due\r\nto an increase in business, All Seasons needed additional room for its manufacturing facility.  Akins\r\ncontracted with Red Dot to erect a metal building in order to expand the space being used by All\r\nSeasons.  Red Dot was responsible for the construction of the metal building, while Akins retained\r\nresponsibility for the remainder of the project, including concrete, electrical, plumbing, and finishing\r\nout the interior.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>On March 5, 2001, Akins signed a contract with Red Dot.  With the \"change orders,\" the\r\ncontract price totaled $400,771.00.  The contract included provisions detailing each party's duties,\r\na payment schedule, and provided for payment of reasonable attorney's fees in the event of a dispute. \r\nConstruction was to begin August 14, 2001.  Due to rain delays, construction actually began one\r\nweek later.  Red Dot failed to deliver sufficient anchor bolts to be incorporated into the concrete. \r\nAll Seasons had to purchase the additional bolts, which forms the basis of the $38.56 counterclaim\r\nby All Seasons.  During the construction, there were various problems, including column placement,\r\nloose bolts, delays in delivery of materials, understaffing by the erection subcontractor, and defects\r\nin the insulation. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Akins alleges the building should have been completed in August.  Red Dot completed the\r\nerection of the building October 24, 2001.  However, Red Dot returned to tighten bolts, fix\r\ninsulation, incorporate an additional beam, and address other issues at the request of Akins and/or\r\nAll Seasons.  On December 11, 2001, the final walk-through with a punch list was conducted and\r\nAkins agreed to accept the project, with the understanding that additional repairs were to be made. \r\nSome repairs were completed December 11.  Red Dot agreed to make the additional repairs, but\r\nnever has. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Pursuant to the contract, Akins paid ten percent of the contract price on signing the contract. \r\nAkins paid $218,300.00 on September 14, 2001, for the delivery of materials.  On October 24, 2001,\r\nRed Dot sent Akins an invoice for final payment in the amount of $143,839.00.  On December 12,\r\n2001, Akins tendered a check for $138,873.49 marked \"payment in full.\"  In a letter accompanying\r\nthe check, Akins informed Red Dot that the deductions were due to increased security costs caused\r\nby delays in construction, the cost of pouring new footers for twelve columns, and the cost of the\r\nanchor bolts.  Red Dot refused to accept the check when Akins refused to remove the \"payment in\r\nfull\" language.  When the parties could not reach an agreement concerning the final invoice, Red Dot\r\nfiled a mechanic's lien on the building and sought eighteen percent interest on the invoice.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Eventually, Akins sued Red Dot for usury, to quiet title, for breach of contract, and\r\nharassment.  Following a bench trial,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> the trial court found that Akins signed the contract in his\r\nindividual capacity and had breached the contract.  The trial court entered several detailed findings\r\nof fact.  The trial court found Red Dot was justified in refusing to accept the check marked \"payment\r\nin full\" and that Red Dot had only received $256,932.00 of the $400,771.00 due under the contract. \r\nThe trial court also found that the contract was ambiguous concerning whether Akins signed in his\r\nindividual or personal capacity and determined that Akins signed in his personal capacity.  The trial\r\ncourt held that the contract, which stated interest would be charged at the maximum rate allowed by\r\nlaw, authorized interest at the rate of ten percent.  Although Red Dot had sought to collect eighteen\r\npercent interest, the trial court found that Red Dot had not committed usury.  The trial court\r\nconcluded that the transaction was not a loan or forbearance of money.  The trial court rendered\r\njudgment that Red Dot recover from Akins $143,800.44 in actual damages, $33,921.14 in contract\r\ninterest, attorney's fees, postjudgment interest, and costs.  Akins appealed to this Court, and Red Dot\r\nhas filed a cross-appeal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>II.<span>       </span>All Seasons has Standing</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>As a preliminary matter, Red Dot argues All Seasons lacks standing.  Since the trial court\r\nfound All Seasons was not a party to the contract, Red Dot contends All Seasons does not have a\r\ncognizable interest in this appeal.  Although All Seasons lacks standing to pursue its usury claims\r\non appeal, All Seasons has standing to be a party to the appeal due to its claim for the cost of the\r\nanchor bolts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Standing is a constitutional prerequisite to maintaining a suit under Texas law.  <i>Tex.

All Seasons and Akins have consistently claimed All Seasons was not\r\na party to the contract.  Because All Seasons successfully persuaded the trial court it was not a party\r\nto the contract, Red Dot argues it lacks standing to appeal based on usury.

App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.).  Since the trial court found that\r\nAll Seasons was not a party to the contract and that finding has not been challenged on appeal, All\r\nSeasons lacks standing to pursue usury claims against Red Dot.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>However, All Seasons does have standing to pursue its counterclaim for $38.56.  Red Dot\r\nargues All Seasons failed to plead any theory to justify recovery of the $38.56, which All Seasons\r\npaid for the missing anchor bolts.  Although All Seasons pled breach of contract, the $38.56 cannot\r\nbe recovered through breach of contract because the trial court found that All Seasons was not a\r\nparty to the contract.

Whether All Seasons\r\nfailed to plead a cause of action is not relevant to whether All Seasons has standing.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  The issue of\r\nstanding is concerned with whether the claimant has a particularized injury distinct from that\r\nsuffered by the general public.  <i>Blue</i>, 34 S.W.3d at 555–56.  All Seasons has a particularized injury\r\ndistinct from that suffered by the general public and, therefore, the claim of $38.56 gives All Seasons\r\nstanding to appeal.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Although All Seasons does not have standing to bring usury claims against Red Dot, All\r\nSeasons does have standing to be a party to the suit.

The trial court found that the interest under the contract, which provided\r\nfor interest at the maximum rate allowed by law, was ten percent.  In its cross-appeal, Red Dot\r\nclaims the contract authorized interest at the rate of eighteen percent.  Akins argues the interest rate\r\nunder the contract should have been six percent.  We review de novo the trial court's conclusion. \r\n<i>See In re Humphreys</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2392570\"><a href=\"/opinion/2392570/matter-of-humphreys/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 403 (Tex. 1994). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The contract provides that \"[a]ll deferred payments shall bear interest from the time they are\r\ndue until paid at the maximum rate permitted by the applicable law.\"  All Seasons and Akins argue\r\nthat the contract rate is six percent because the contract does not specify a rate of interest.  Section\r\n302.002 of the Texas Finance Code provides as follows:  \"If a creditor has not agreed with an obligor\r\nto charge the obligor any interest, the creditor may charge and receive from the obligor legal interest\r\nat the rate of six percent a year . . . .\"  <span>Tex.

According to Red Dot, the\r\ncontract required payment of the balance on \"completion of erection.\"  While the contract does\r\nprovide that the final payment is due on \"completion of erection,\" it does not define what completion\r\nof erection means.

Under\r\nthe plain language of the contract, the final payment was due on completion of the erection.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The evidence is sufficient to support the trial court's finding that construction was completed\r\nby October 24, 2001.  Ronald Acree, a subcontractor for Red Dot, testified the building was\r\ncomplete October 24, 2001.  This arises to more than a scintilla of evidence that erection was\r\ncomplete by October 24, 2001.  While there is some evidence the building was not complete in all\r\nrespects, the trial court's finding is not so contrary to the great weight and preponderance of the\r\nevidence that it is clearly wrong or unjust.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  The evidence is legally and factually sufficient that\r\nerection was completed by October 24, 2001.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Because the trial court found construction was complete by October 24, 2001, it erred in\r\nholding interest should accrue from December 11, 2001.

The contract provides that the final payment is due on\r\ncompletion of erection.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Since construction was complete October 24, 2001, interest should have\r\nbegun to accrue October 24, 2001.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>V.<span>        </span>Red Dot Did Not Commit Usury</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>In his first six points of error, Akins challenges the trial court's denial of his usury claims. \r\nAkins argues that usury was proven as a matter of law, or in the alternative, argues the evidence is\r\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court's holding.  According to Akins and All Seasons, usury\r\nwas established as a matter of law or by the great weight and preponderance of the evidence if the\r\ncontractual interest rate was six percent or even ten percent.  As discussed above, Red Dot did not\r\nattempt to charge an illegal rate of interest.  The trial court's finding is supported by legally and\r\nfactually sufficient evidence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Akins alleges the trial court erred in denying his usury claims because any interest in excess\r\nof ten percent is usury in Texas.  Section 305.001 of the Texas Finance Code imposes liability for\r\ncontracting for, charging, or receiving interest greater than the amount authorized by law.  Section\r\n305.001 provides as follows:  </span></p>\r\n<p><span>(a)  A creditor who contracts for, charges, or receives interest that is greater\r\nthan the amount authorized by this subtitle . . . is liable to the obligor for an amount\r\nthat is equal to the greater of:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(1)  three times the amount computed by subtracting the amount of\r\ninterest allowed by law from the total amount of interest contracted for,\r\ncharged, or received; or</span></p>\r\n<p><span>(2)  $2,000 or 20 percent of the amount of the principal, whichever is\r\nless.</span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Tex. Fin. Code Ann. </span>§ 305.001(a).  The solicitation of interest, through a demand letter, exceeding\r\nthat allowed by law may constitute a \"charge\" for the purposes of Section 305.001.  <i>Hoxie Implement\r\nCo. v.

App.—Amarillo 2001, pet. denied).  However, as discussed\r\nabove, eighteen percent interest was permissible under Texas law.  Because the rate of interest Red\r\nDot charged was legal, Red Dot did not commit usury.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Alternatively, Akins argues Red Dot committed usury because it sought to charge interest\r\nfrom October 24, 2001, instead of December 11, 2001, and from August 14, 2001, to September 14,\r\n2001.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  The legality of the interest rate depends on when the payment was due.  Interest charged at\r\nany rate for a period contracted by the parties to be free of interest is usurious.  <i>PJM, Inc. v.

As\r\ndiscussed above, the contract requires the final payment to be made on the completion of erection. \r\nBecause the materials were delivered August 14, 2001, and there is sufficient evidence to support\r\nthe trial court's finding that construction was completed October 24, 2001, Red Dot could charge\r\ninterest during the periods alleged.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the trial court's finding that Red Dot did\r\nnot commit usury.  The law authorizes interest to be charged at eighteen percent.  Further, Red Dot\r\ndid not commit usury when it attempted to charge interest for the periods from October 24, 2001\r\nthrough December 11, 2001, and for the tardiness of Akins' second payment, since Red Dot could,\r\nunder the contract, legally charge interest during those periods under the contract.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VI.<span>      </span>The Trial Court Erred by Deducting $38.56 from the Amount Owed by Akins</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The evidence established as a matter of law that All Seasons paid $38.56 for anchor bolts,\r\nwhich were the responsibility of Red Dot.

The trial court stated that, although the fees were\r\n\"high,\" they were not unreasonable and unnecessary.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>First, Akins argues the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees in excess of $250.00 per\r\nhour when the evidence only established that $250.00 per hour was a reasonable rate.  In general,\r\nthe reasonableness of attorney's fees is a question of fact.  <i>City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News</i>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376478/city-of-garland-v-dallas-morning-news/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 367 (Tex. 2000).  Harrison testified that he thought $250.00 per hour was a \"more\r\nappropriate\" fee, but that $300.00 per hour could be reasonable in some circumstances.  Harrison\r\ntestified that, after adjusting rates exceeding $250.00 per hour to $250.00 per hour, Red Dot's\r\nattorney's fees came to $125,043.15.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Harrison's testimony that that amount was reasonable and that\r\nthe case was not \"overstaffed,\" is some evidence the attorney's fees are reasonable and necessary. \r\nFurther, the great weight and preponderance of the evidence does not indicate the attorney's fees are\r\nunreasonable.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Second, Akins argues the trial court erred in awarding recovery of paralegal fees and other\r\nexpenses in the award of attorney's fees.  An award of attorney's fees may include a legal assistant's\r\ntime to the extent that the work performed \"has traditionally been done by any attorney.\"  <i>Clary\r\nCorp. v. Smith</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419531\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419531/clary-corp-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 469 (Tex.

App.—Dallas 1988, writ denied).  To recover\r\nattorney's fees for work performed by legal assistants, \"the evidence must establish:  (1) the\r\nqualifications of the legal assistant to perform substantive legal work; (2) that the legal assistant\r\nperformed substantive legal work under the direction and supervision of an attorney; (3) the nature\r\nof the legal work performed; (4) the legal assistant's hourly rate; and (5) the number of hours\r\nexpended by the legal assistant.\"<i>  Multi-Moto Corp. v. ITT Commercial Fin. Corp</i>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1519151\"><a href=\"/opinion/1519151/multi-moto-corp-v-itt-commercial-finance-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>,\r\n570 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1990, writ denied); <i>see Gill Sav. Ass'n</i>, 759 S.W.2d at 704–05.  Because\r\nthere was no evidence concerning the legal assistants other than the hourly rate and number of hours\r\nexpended, we modify the award of attorney's fees in the amount of $4,819.50 for work performed\r\nby legal assistants.  Red Dot has failed to provide any authority for the award of expenses to this\r\nCourt or the trial court.  Attorney's fees must be based on some statutory or contractual authority. \r\n<i>Holland</i>, 1 S.W.3d at 95.  Because Red Dot had the burden of proving its attorney's fees were\r\nreasonable and failed to prove it was entitled to the expenses, we modify the award for expenses by\r\n$2,377.95.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Third, Akins argues the attorney's fees are unreasonable because the actual amount in \r\ncontroversy was only $4,926.95.  While the attorney's fees may be excessive if Akins had paid the\r\namount not in dispute under the contract, Akins never tendered the amount not in dispute to Red Dot. \r\nThe amount in controversy was actually $143,839.00.  Therefore, we cannot conclude the amount\r\nin dispute indicates the attorney's fees are unreasonable.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>All Seasons argues, because it prevailed on its counterclaim for $38.56, it is entitled to\r\nattorney's fees.  All Seasons failed to segregate which portion of its attorney's fees concerned the\r\ncounterclaim.  Although there was no objection to the failure to segregate,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> an award of $29,511.29\r\nfor attorney's fees for a $38.56 claim is clearly unreasonable.  The trial court did not err in refusing\r\nto award attorney's fees for the $38.56 counterclaim.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>Last, All Seasons and Akins argue the trial court erred in failing to condition the attorney's\r\nfees awarded for the appeal on the appeal being successful.  An award for attorney's fees for an\r\nappeal should be conditioned on a successful appeal.  <i>Westech Eng'g, Inc. v. Clearwater\r\nConstructors, Inc</i>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1674188\"><a href=\"/opinion/1674188/westech-eng-v-clearwater-constructors/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 205 (Tex. App.—Austin 1992, no writ).  We modify the\r\njudgment to reflect that Red Dot is only eligible to receive attorney's fees for its appeal if its appeal\r\nof the breach of contract issues is successful.  <i>See J.C. Penney Life Ins. Co. v. Heinrich</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2188102\"><a href=\"/opinion/2188102/jc-penney-life-ins-co-v-heinrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 290 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2000, pet. denied). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>The trial court awarded the maximum attorney's fees supported by the testimony.  Therefore,\r\nthe award must have included the fees for paralegals and expenses.  Because there is no evidence\r\nRed Dot was entitled to the paralegal fees and expenses, we modify the award by $7,197.45.  We\r\nmodify the judgment to condition attorney's fees for appeal on the success of that appeal.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>VIII.<span>   </span>Conclusion</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>We affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse in part, and modify in part. \r\nAlthough All Seasons lacks standing for its usury claims, All Seasons has standing based on its claim\r\nfor the amount it spent on anchor bolts.  The trial court erred in finding the interest rate under the\r\ncontract was ten percent.  We modify the judgment that the interest rate under the contract was\r\neighteen percent.  We affirm the trial court's finding that construction was complete October 24,\r\n2001, but modify the ruling that interest should accrue from October 24, 2001.  We affirm the trial\r\ncourt's determination that Red Dot did not commit usury.  The trial court erred in awarding to Akins\r\nthe $38.56 expended by All Seasons for anchor bolts.  Because Red Dot failed to prove it was\r\nentitled to paralegal fees and expenses, we modify the award for attorney's fees by $7,197.45.  We\r\nmodify the judgment to condition attorney's fees for appeal on the success of that appeal. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>We modify the judgment that Red Dot recover from Akins' damages in the amount of\r\n$143,839.00, interest at a rate of eighteen percent on $143,839.00 from October 24, 2001;\r\n$98,172.50 in attorney's fees for the trial of the case;</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> and $10,000.00 in attorney's fees for the\r\nsuccessful appeal to this Court.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  We reverse and render judgment that All Seasons recover $38.56\r\nfrom Red Dot.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>            </span>We affirm the trial court's judgment in all other respects. </span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>                                                                        </span>Jack Carter</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>                                                                        </span>Justice</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>Date Submitted:<span>          </span>October 5, 2005</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Date Decided:<span>             </span>November 29, 2005</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
