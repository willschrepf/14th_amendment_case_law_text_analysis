GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:\n      As next-friend of her minor daughter “S.W.”, Barbara Wyatt brought this\nsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against high school softball coaches Rhonda Fletcher\nand Cassandra Newell. Wyatt alleges the coaches disclosed S.W.’s sexual\norientation during a disciplinary meeting with S.W.’s mother, primarily claiming\nthe disclosure to the mother constituted a Fourteenth Amendment invasion of\nS.W.’s privacy. Wyatt also alleged a Fourth Amendment claim based on a\ndisciplinary confrontation in a locked locker room. On the coaches’ motion for\nsummary judgment, the district court denied qualified immunity to Fletcher and\nNewell on the ground that genuine issues of material fact were disputed. We\ndisagree and reverse. We hold that there is no clearly established law holding\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831      Page: 2    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nthat a student in a public secondary school has a privacy right under the\nFourteenth Amendment that precludes school officials from discussing with a\nparent the student’s private matters, including matters relating to sexual\nactivity of the student. We further hold that such students have no clearly\nestablished Fourth Amendment right that bars a student-coach confrontation in\na closed and locked room. We thus conclude that these individual defendants\nare entitled to qualified immunity that bars the federal claims against them,\nand, consequently, we REVERSE and VACATE in part and REMAND for entry\nof judgment dismissing the federal claims against these individual defendants.\n                                         I.\n      The first matter we must deal with in this qualified immunity case is the\nbasis of our jurisdiction. On this interlocutory appeal, we have before us the\ndistrict court’s denial of the coaches’ motion for summary judgment asserting the\nclaim of qualified immunity. Our review is de novo. Flores v. City of Palacios,\n381 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir. 2004). Although a denial of a defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment is not ordinarily immediately appealable, such a denial\nbased on qualified immunity is a collateral order capable of immediate review.\nBrown v. Strain, 663 F.3d 245, 248 (5th Cir. 2011) (inset quotation marks\nomitted). We have jurisdiction over such an order, however, only “to the extent\nthat the district court’s order turns on an issue of law,” Kovacic v. Villareal, 628\nF.3d 209, 211 (5th Cir. 2010); if it turns on a disputed material fact, we lack\njurisdiction. Thus, if we decide that the district court erred in assessing the\nlegal significance of the conduct that the district court considered, we then\ndecide whether the factual disputes are material to deciding the legal issue\npresented in the summary judgment. See Kinney v. Weaver, 367 F.3d 337, 348\n(5th Cir. 2004) (en banc); Wagner v. Bay City, 227 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir. 2000).\nIf there are no such material factual disputes, we can then rule on the claim for\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                         2\n\f     Case: 11-41359      Document: 00512258831        Page: 3     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                     No. 11-41359\n\n       Ms. Wyatt (“Wyatt”), in her complaint, has made various claims, but in\nthis interlocutory appeal, we only have appellate jurisdiction over the federal\nclaims against the individual defendants Rhonda Fletcher (“Fletcher”) and\nCassandra Newell (“Newell”).1 Wyatt alleged in her complaint that the coaches’\nconduct violated her daughter’s constitutional right to privacy under the\nFourteenth Amendment and her right to be free from unreasonable seizure\nunder the Fourth Amendment. As we will see, to decide the overarching\nquestion of whether the district court erred in denying the coaches qualified\nimmunity, we ask whether the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, which\nWyatt claims were violated, are “clearly established.” See Jones v. City of\nJackson, 203 F.3d 875, 879 (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S.\n226, 231 (1991)). If they are not, the appellants are entitled to qualified\nimmunity, and the district court’s denial of summary judgment on the federal\nclaims was error.2\n                                            II.\n                                            A.\n       The dispute arose in the East Texas town of Kilgore. On March 3, 2009,\nS.W., a student at Kilgore High School (“KHS”), attended a meeting of the\nvarsity softball team on which she played. The meeting was held at an off-\ncampus playing field where practices regularly took place. In her complaint,\nWyatt alleges that, upon S.W.’s arrival at the meeting, S.W.’s softball coaches\nFletcher and Newell dismissed the rest of the team and led S.W. into a nearby\n\n       1\n         We do not reach Wyatt’s claims brought under the Monell doctrine against Kilgore\nIndependent School District. Monell v. Dep’t. of Soc. Servs. of City of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658\n(1978). Nor are Wyatt’s claims against Douglas Duke before us, see infra n.9. The only\nappellants in this case are Fletcher and Newell. To the extent that Wyatt brings state law\nclaims against Fletcher and Newell under the Texas Constitution and Texas common law,\nthose claims are not before us on this appeal.\n       2\n        We stress that our holdings here are narrow: they address only whether the specific\nconstitutional rights in this case are clearly established.\n\n                                            3\n\f     Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831           Page: 4     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\nlocker room, locked the door, and questioned her about an alleged relationship\nwith an older young woman named Hillary Nutt (“Nutt”). Wyatt said that the\ncoaches then yelled at S.W., falsely accused her of spreading rumors regarding\none of the coaches’ sexual orientation,3 and threatened to tell S.W.’s mother that\nher daughter was in a sexual relationship with another woman.4                           In her\ncomplaint, Wyatt made a further allegation: that, at the locker room meeting,\n“Fletcher asked S.W. if she was gay.” In her deposition, however, S.W.’s story\nchanged: she said definitively that the coaches did not ask, point blank, whether\nshe was a lesbian. Besides this inconsistency, there is one more worthy of note:\nin her complaint, Wyatt states, “At the time of Fletcher and Newell’s\nconfrontation, S.W. was dating [Nutt].” But in her appellate brief, she says “in\nfact, [S.W.] and Hillary [Nutt] hadn’t dated” and “weren’t in a relationship.”\n       Following the meeting with S.W., the coaches called Wyatt, S.W.’s mother,\nand requested they meet.5 The parties’ characterizations of events differ. In her\ncomplaint, Wyatt alleges that Fletcher revealed S.W.’s sexual orientation to her\n\n\n\n       3\n        The record indicates that S.W. has admitted to starting a rumor: in her affidavit, S.W.\nsaid that, on the day in question, she speculated on Newell’s sexual orientation to another\nstudent. Apparently, students began discussing this rumor, notes were passed in class, and\na student brought the matter to the coaches’ attention. Newell and Fletcher then called the\nmeeting. S.W.also admits to routinely showing up late and using profanity at practice.\n       4\n         Wyatt’s central claim is “privacy” in S.W.’s sexual orientation. The undisputed facts,\nhowever, indicate that S.W. talked about her sexual orientation with a close friend in 2007,\nadmitted she was gay to “five or six” friends the week before the events in question, wore\nclothing she describes as “society’s symbol for gay pride,” and “went skipping down the hallway\nholding hands” with another girl. Although these facts are in no way dispositive in our\nanalysis, we note them because they suggest S.W.’s sexual orientation was not a hermetically\nsealed secret in the school setting.\n       5\n         In the KHS “Parent Involvement Plan,” the school states its position that “the more\n[KHS] can communicate with parents, the greater success [it] will have in reaching our\nstudents. [KHS] want[s] parents involved in all aspects of our school from academics to\nextracurricular activities.” In its “Parent Involvement Policy,” KHS states its goal is to “strive\nto increase parental participation in school and encourage positive interaction between school\nand home.”\n\n                                                4\n\f     Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831          Page: 5     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\nmother at this second meeting and that Newell then offered Wyatt the contact\ninformation for Nutt. As with the locker room meeting, however, there are\ninconsistencies in Wyatt’s story. Wyatt’s allegation in her complaint was that,\nat the second meeting, the coaches “outed” her daughter: “Fletcher said [to\nWyatt that] S.W. was a lesbian.” Wyatt apparently withdrew this allegation\nwhen, at her deposition, she testified under oath that Coach Fletcher in fact\nnever used the word “gay” or “lesbian.” The claim involving the revelation of\nS.W.’s sexual orientation has become ever more nuanced over the course of the\nbriefing on this appeal: Instead of alleging that the coaches divulged, point-\nblank, her daughter’s homosexuality, Wyatt’s claim is now that she inferred\nS.W.’s sexual orientation from the coaches’ comments.6 In response, the coaches\nargue that they were obliged to contact S.W.’s mother because rumors regarding\nS.W.’s relationship with Nutt were causing dissension on the team, Nutt was a\npotentially dangerous and underage user of illegal drugs and alcohol, and any\npossible sexual relationship between Nutt and S.W. was a valid concern. See\nTEX. PENAL CODE § 22.011(a)(2).7\n                                               B.\n       Wyatt filed three separate grievances with Kilgore Independent School\nDistrict (“KISD”) alleging the coaches acted inappropriately by disclosing S.W.’s\n\n\n\n\n       6\n        In her deposition, however, Wyatt testified that she had suspected her daughter was\ngay prior to the events at issue in this case.\n       7\n          Although, for the purposes of summary judgment, we take the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to Wyatt, see Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S.\n574, 587 (1986), we note at the outset of our discussion that the legitimate, disciplinary basis\nfor the coaches’ decision to notify Wyatt is established by undisputed facts. S.W. concedes that\nshe broke multiple team rules, lied to Newell and Fletcher, and discussed Newell’s sexuality\nat school prior to the coaches’ decision to notify S.W.’s mother. Thus, the alleged “bad motives”\nof the coaches, which the dissent discusses in painful repetition, are incriminatingly tinged\nby S.W.’s own admissions, which demonstrate her culpability for her conduct of the same sort.\n\n                                               5\n\f     Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831         Page: 6     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nsexual orientation to her mother; all were subsequently dismissed.8 Then, on\nDecember 10, 2010, Wyatt, as next-friend of her minor daughter S.W., filed a\ncomplaint in federal court against KISD, and, in their personal capacities,\nagainst KHS assistant athletic director Douglas Duke,9 Fletcher, and Newell, for\nviolating S.W.’s federal rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\nand state privacy rights under the Texas Constitution.                   In their answer,\nDefendants pleaded the affirmative defense of Texas official immunity for KISD\non the state claims and qualified immunity for Fletcher and Newell on the\nfederal claims. The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge, and\nthe coaches moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.\nThe magistrate judge rejected the defense of qualified immunity and\nconsequently denied the coaches’ motion for summary judgment. The magistrate\njudge cited “multiple unresolved questions of fact.” With regard to Wyatt’s\nFourth Amendment claim of unlawful seizure, the court said “there remains a\ngenuine material issue of fact as to whether there was an objectively reasonable\nbasis for the coaches’ actions including factual disputes over what transpired\nbehind the closed doors of the locker room.” With regard to the Fourteenth\nAmendment right to privacy claim, the magistrate judge held that S.W.’s right\nto privacy in her sexual orientation was clearly established, and summary\njudgment was premature due to unresolved questions of fact – such as “whether\nthe Coaches[] disclosed S.W.’s sexual orientation as retaliation for S.W.’s\nconduct, whether they disclosed the identity of Ms. Nutt [to Ms. Wyatt] without\n\n\n       8\n         In her original grievance filed with KISD officials, however, Wyatt did not allege\nFletcher and Newell had “outed” her daughter but only that the coaches, following the\nmeetings outlined above, improperly removed S.W. from the softball team and that the athletic\ndepartment failed to respond to Wyatt’s queries in a timely fashion. In short, the claims made\nby Wyatt have been a constantly moving target.\n       9\n        The court later granted Wyatt’s motion to file an amended complaint and voluntarily\ndismiss Duke from the case; thus, he is not a party in this appeal.\n\n                                              6\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831      Page: 7    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nprovocation by Ms. Wyatt, and the words they used to describe the\nrelationship . . .”– all of which related to the reasonableness of their conduct.\n      As we have said, we lack appellate jurisdiction in this interlocutory appeal\nto determine whether a genuine factual issue exists; however, we do have\njurisdiction to review the materiality of disputed facts as well as the district\ncourt’s legal analysis as it pertains to qualified immunity. See Wagner, 227 F.3d\nat 320; see also Kinney, 367 F.3d at 358. As we will see, the magistrate judge\nerred in analyzing the materiality of disputed facts because, even taking the\nfacts in the light most favorable to Wyatt, Wyatt has not alleged violations of\nclearly established Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Consequently,\nwe have appellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.\n                                        III.\n      Our review of the magistrate judge’s legal analysis begins with setting out\nthe standard for qualified immunity. As we have indicated in many prior cases,\nevaluating qualified immunity is a two-step process, and the burden is on the\nplaintiff to prove that a government official is not entitled to qualified immunity.\nMichalik v. Hermann, 422 F.3d 252, 258 (5th Cir. 2005). First, we determine\nwhether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a clearly established\nconstitutional or statutory right. See Jones, 203 F.3d at 879. A right is clearly\nestablished only if its contours are “sufficiently clear that a reasonable official\nwould understand that what he is doing violates that right.” Wooley v. City of\nBaton Rouge, 211 F.3d 913, 919 (5th Cir. 2000) (inset quotation marks omitted).\nThe applicable law that binds the conduct of officeholders must be clearly\nestablished at the time the allegedly actionable conduct occurs. Id. (inset\nquotation marks omitted). If the first step is met (i.e. the official’s conduct\nviolates an established right), the second step is to determine whether the\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f     Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 8     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\ndefendant’s conduct was objectively reasonable.10 Jones, 203 F.3d at 879 (inset\nquotation marks omitted). Both steps in the qualified immunity analysis are\nquestions of law. Wooley, 211 F.3d at 919.\n       Under the Fifth Circuit standard, the doctrine of qualified immunity\nprotects government officials from civil damages liability when they reasonably\ncould have believed that their conduct was not barred by law, and immunity is\nnot denied unless existing precedent places the constitutional question beyond\ndebate. Morgan v. Swanson, 659 F.3d 359, 370-71 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc).\n“Qualified immunity balances two important interests – the need to hold public\nofficials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to\nshield officials from harassment, distraction and liability when they perform\ntheir duties reasonably.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009). The\nlaw generally disfavors expansive civil liability for actions taken while state\nofficials are on duty because such liability “can entail substantial social costs,\nincluding the risk that fear of personal monetary liability and harassing\nlitigation will unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties.” Anderson\nv. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987). In short, “[q]ualified immunity gives\ngovernment officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken\njudgments about open legal questions.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074,\n2085 (2011).\n       When deciding whether the right allegedly violated was “clearly\nestablished,” the court asks whether the law so clearly and unambiguously\nprohibited the conduct that every reasonable official would understand that what\nhe is doing violates the law. Morgan, 659 F.3d at 371 (inset quotations omitted).\n\n\n\n       10\n          Our analysis does not reach the “second step” of the qualified immunity analysis\nbecause, as the discussion that follows will indicate, the first, “clearly established” step has\nnot been met by Wyatt in this case. Thus, consideration of the “objectively reasonable” prong\nof qualified immunity is unnecessary.\n\n                                               8\n\f     Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 9     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nAnswering in the affirmative requires the court to be able to point to “controlling\nauthority–or a robust consensus of persuasive authority–that defines the\ncontours of the right in question with a high degree of particularity.” Id. at 371-\n72 (citations and inset quotations omitted). This requirement establishes a high\nbar. When there is no controlling authority specifically prohibiting a defendant’s\nconduct, the law is not clearly established for the purposes of defeating qualified\nimmunity. See id. at 372. Acknowledging these clearly drawn bright lines as\nrigorous background principles of qualified immunity, we proceed to the merits\nof Wyatt’s privacy claim.\n                                             IV.\n       Wyatt’s assertions of federal liability have essentially morphed over the\ncourse of the litigation into one primary constitutional claim involving an alleged\nright to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is true that, originally,\nWyatt alleged two basic claims. In her complaint, Wyatt alleged a Fourth\nAmendment violation, saying that the coaches’ decision to “lock the locker room\ndoor and order S.W. to remain inside while Defendants confronted and\nthreatened her was a de facto seizure of S.W.’s person . . . .” However, in her\nappellate brief and at oral argument, Wyatt barely mentioned this seizure\nallegation. She cites no authorities establishing such a Fourth Amendment\nviolation in school contexts, making practically no effort to show the right in\nquestion is “clearly established.” When before the district court on summary\njudgment, however, the district court held there was a genuine issue of material\nfact relating to her claim of “seizure” – whether there was an objectively\nreasonable basis for the coaches’ actions in the locker room, which, according to\nS.W., included shouting, intimidating gestures, and locked doors.11 In so doing,\n\n\n       11\n          As mentioned earlier, however, S.W. has conceded that she was not asked in the\nlocker room whether she was gay, so, even taking the facts in the light most favorable to S.W.,\nthat specific allegation of her Fourth Amendment claim is not before us.\n\n                                              9\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 10     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nhowever, the court erred; there is no material disputed fact that prevented it\nfrom deciding the legal question. First, the district court overlooked case law\nthat establishes that the Fourth Amendment applies differently in the school\ncontext and particularly with regard to student athletes in locker rooms. See\nMilligan v. City of Slidell, 226 F.3d 652, 654-55 (5th Cir. 2000); see also Vernonia\nSchool District 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 657 (1995) (noting that “[p]ublic\nschool locker rooms . . . are not notable for the [Fourth Amendment] privacy they\nafford” and “[b]y choosing to go out for the team, [student athletes] voluntarily\nsubject themselves to a degree of regulation even higher than that imposed on\nstudents generally.”) (inset quotations omitted).12 Second, verbal abuse does not\ngive rise to a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, so any yelling that\nmay have occurred is not actionable. See Calhoun v. Hargrove, 312 F.3d 730,\n734 (5th Cir. 2002); see also Doe v. Gooden, 214 F.3d 952, 955 (8th Cir. 2000)\n(holding that a teacher’s statements, while “demeaning” and “belittling” to his\nstudents, did not violate their constitutional rights); Walker-Serrano by Walker\nv. Leonard, 168 F. Supp. 2d 332, 347 (M.D. Pa. 2001) (stating “verbal abuse,\nwhether coming from a student or a teacher, is not a constitutional violation.”).\nThus, there is simply no clearly established constitutional right – and Wyatt\ncites none – that protects students from being privately questioned, even\n\n\n\n\n       12\n          The dissent scolds us for citing Vernonia, saying the Supreme Court’s urinalysis\ndecision has “absolutely nothing to do with the instant case.” To be sure, however, Vernonia\nstates background principles, cited above, that not only are relevant to the application of the\nFourth Amendment in any school athletics context but also support what should be plain:\nthere is nothing per se unreasonable about a one-on-one, closed door meeting between coaches\nand student athletes. As seen in Milligan, courts have routinely applied Vernonia to contexts\nother than urinalysis testing. See 226 F.3d at 654-55.\n\n                                              10\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 11     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nforcefully, even in a locked locker room.13 Thus Newell and Fletcher are entitled\nto qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claim.\n       We are left only with Wyatt’s Fourteenth Amendment claim relating to the\ncoaches’ conversation with S.W’s mother. Under Wyatt’s theory, S.W. has a\nconstitutional right to the confidentiality– even with respect to her mother– of\nher own sexual orientation, which was breached by the coaches when they spoke\nto her about S.W.’s violations of team policy. In order to further understand the\nnature of Wyatt’s claim – and whether, for purposes of qualified immunity, the\nright purportedly violated is clearly established, we first briefly consider the\nmodern-day origin and subsequent development of the constitutional right to\nprivacy under the Fourteenth Amendment upon which Wyatt relies.\n                                              A.\n       We begin with Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965). There, the\nSupreme Court declared that a state law prohibiting the use of contraceptives\nby married couples was unconstitutional because it violated the right to privacy,\na right long last apparent from the penumbra of rights established by the Bill\nof Rights and applied to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See id. at 485-86. The decision can be said to have validated an\nearlier dissent by Justice Brandeis in Olmstead v. United States, which\ndescribed the “right to be let alone” as the “most comprehensive of rights and the\nright most valued by civilized man.” 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928). In order to\nprotect the right, Justice Brandeis wrote, in dissent, “every unjustifiable\n\n\n\n       13\n          Wyatt does not make any allegation of physical restraint, instead stressing what does\nnot sound like a Fourth Amendment claim at all: that her daughter was “bullied into revealing\nprivate information.” S.W. admits she was never asked by coaches whether she was\nhomosexual, so the “information” Wyatt claims she was forced to reveal is never expressly\nstated but seems to involve her interactions with Nutt, with whom she expressly denies being\nin a relationship at the relevant time. See supra Part II. The Fourth Amendment claim thus\nstumbles, then falls.\n\n                                              11\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831       Page: 12    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-41359\n\nintrusion of the government upon the privacy of an individual . . . must be\ndeemed a [constitutional] violation . . . .” Id.\n      Later, in Whalen v. Roe, the Supreme Court identified two separate\ninterests that fall under the constitutional right to privacy. 429 U.S. 589, 599-\n600 (1977). The one of relevance to us is the “individual interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters” by the government. Id. at 599; see also Nixon v.\nAdm’r of Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 425, 457 (1977) (“One element of privacy has been\ncharacterized as ‘the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal\nmatters . . . .’”). This confidentiality interest has been defined as “the right to be\nfree from the government disclosing private facts about its citizens.” Ramie v.\nCity of Hedwig Village, Tex., 765 F.2d 490, 492 (5th Cir. 1985).\n      Since Whalen and Nixon, however, the Supreme Court “has said little else\non the subject of an individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal\nmatters.” NASA v. Nelson, 131 S. Ct. 746, 756 (2011) (noting that “no other\ndecision has squarely addressed a constitutional right to informational\nprivacy.”). Wyatt argues, however, that the Fifth Circuit has “addressed the\ncontours” of her right to privacy and that the constitutional protection accorded\nto such a right “in this and other circuits is clear.” But, in so doing, she\noverstates the degree to which precedent supports her particular claim. The\nFifth Circuit has never held that a person has a constitutionally-protected\nprivacy interest in her sexual orientation, and it certainly has never suggested\nthat such a privacy interest precludes school authorities from discussing with\nparents matters that relate to the interests of their children. Indeed, we have\nsaid, “There is no Fifth Circuit authority on what types of disclosures are\npersonal enough to trigger the protection of the confidentiality branch.” Zaffuto\nv. City of Hammond, 308 F.3d 485, 490 (5th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added).\nTherefore, when the magistrate judge in this case held that there is a\nconstitutional right that bars the unauthorized disclosure by school coaches of\n\n                                         12\n\f    Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831           Page: 13      Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\na student’s sexual orientation to the student’s mother, he proclaimed a new rule\nof law.14\n                                               B.\n                                               1.\n       And although Wyatt argues that the distinct contours of her asserted right\nwere well-established, she can only cite two irrelevantly remote Fifth Circuit\ncases in an attempt to buttress her claim, Fadjo v. Coon, 633 F.2d 1172 (5th Cir.\n1981), and ACLU of Miss., Inc. v. Miss., 911 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir. 1990), neither\nof which even touch on privacy rights between a student and a parent. The first,\n\n\n\n       14\n           The dissent gives this error cloud cover and, in so doing, proceeds to miscomprehend\nthe qualified immunity analysis that is fundamental to deciding this case. The Supreme Court\n“has repeatedly told courts . . . not to define clearly established law at a high level of\ngenerality.” al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2084. Here, the district court and now, apparently, the\ndissent have redacted this directive from Supreme Court authority. They have allowed their\nanalysis to hinge on the existence of a Fourteenth Amendment general right to privacy and\nthe general possession of that right by some minors in some limited circumstances. As we\nobserve supra herein, the existence of a general right is established, and we do not take issue\nwith it. In order for liability to be imposed on public officials, however, qualified immunity\ncases require more than a bare allegation of a general right to nondisclosure of private\ninformation: “the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been ‘clearly\nestablished’ in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense.” Anderson, 483 U.S.\nat 640 (emphasis added). Otherwise, “[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified\nimmunity that our cases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply\nby alleging violation of [] abstract rights.” Id. at 639. The following two examples illustrate\nthe dissent’s errant approach: for the Supreme Court, “[t]he general proposition . . . that an\nunreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth Amendment is of little help in determining\nwhether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.” al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct.\nat 2084 (emphasis added). Similarly, “[T]he right to due process of law is quite clearly\nestablished by the Due Process Clause, and thus there is a sense in which any action that\nviolates that Clause . . . violates a clearly established right . . . .” Morgan, 659 F.2d at 372.\nBut that does not mean liability will be imposed on public officials, for the question is “whether\nthat right has been defined with sufficient clarity” and specificity “to enable a reasonable\nofficial to assess the lawfulness of his conduct.” Id. (emphasis added). The central concept is\nfair warning: “qualified immunity should not be denied unless the law is clear in the more\nparticularized sense that reasonable officials should be on notice that their conduct is\nunlawful.” Kinney, 367 F.3d at 350 (emphasis added) (inset quotation marks omitted). There\nis no authority – and none has been cited – that would put school officials on notice that\nspecific conversations between a teacher and a parent regarding a student’s conduct are\nbarred.\n\n                                               13\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831        Page: 14     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-41359\n\nFadjo v. Coon, concerned disclosure of an insurance beneficiary’s personal\ninformation in the context of a criminal investigation. 633 F.2d at 1174.\nPlaintiff Fadjo was the named beneficiary of life insurance policies insuring a\nman who mysteriously disappeared. Id. at 1174. After explicit assurances by\nthe state attorney that his testimony would be absolutely privileged, Fadjo, as\npart of the criminal investigation, provided the state with information\nconcerning “the most private details of his life.” Id. The state attorney then\nshared this information with insurance companies, resulting in personal\nmisfortune to Fadjo, who was forced to move his residence and struggled to find\nmeaningful employment. Id. Finding that Fadjo’s right to privacy had been\nviolated by the disclosure, the court held that there was an actionable § 1983\nclaim under the confidentiality branch of the Fourteenth Amendment15 and that\n“no legitimate state purpose existed sufficient to outweigh the invasion into\nFadjo’s privacy.” Id. at 1175. Notably, the court never discussed the specific\nnature of the “private details of Fadjo’s life” that were disclosed (i.e. details\nprivate enough to warrant constitutional protection), and the court never\nsuggested that sexual orientation might be one of them. Furthermore, the court\nstressed that Fadjo had been promised that the information he provided\ninvestigators would be confidential and that the plaintiff’s allegation was that\nthe state had not honored this pledge. Id. at 1176 (stating “Fadjo’s case is\ndistinguishable . . . since it involves the revelation of intimate information\nobtained under a pledge of confidentiality . . . .”) (emphasis added). In Wyatt’s\ncase, the coaches made no such promise to S.W.\n\n\n\n       15\n         The court, however, did not perform a detailed qualified immunity analysis. We note\nin passing that Fadjo was decided before several noteworthy Supreme Court cases on qualified\nimmunity, among them, Siegert, 500 U.S. 226; Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001); Hope v.\nPelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002); Brousseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194 (2004); and Pearson, 555 U.S.\n223.\n\n                                            14\n\f    Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831           Page: 15      Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\n       Even to speculate that an established right to the non-disclosure of one’s\nsexual orientation exists does not help Wyatt’s case and still does not result in\nliability for the coaches. This is so because such speculation does not establish\nspecifically that school officials are barred from communicating with parents\nregarding minor students’ behavior and welfare, when doing so might cause the\nparents to infer their child’s sexual orientation.\n       The second Fifth Circuit case Wyatt relies upon is American Civil Liberties\nUnion of Miss., Inc. v. Mississippi, 911 F.2d at 1066. That case concerned the\ndismantling of a state agency whose purpose was to perpetuate racial\nsegregation. Id. at 1068. After the agency had been shut down, the district\ncourt ordered that all agency files, including some containing sensitive, personal\ninformation of civil rights activists, be released to the general public. Id. This\ncourt reversed. We held that the public interest in full disclosure of the files was\noutweighed by the privacy concerns of the individuals whose information was\nobtained without permission.16 Id. at 1069. In the passage most relevant to the\ncase at bar, the court said that plaintiffs “undeniably have an interest in\nrestricting the disclosure of information” regarding “numerous instances of\n(often unsubstantiated) allegations of homosexuality, child molestation,\nillegitimate births, and sexual promiscuity . . . .” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n       16\n           In ACLU of Miss., the court in its discussion repeatedly pointed to clearly established\nrights – the right of a free press to publish matters of public concern, the public’s right to\naccess certain government documents, and individuals’ right to suppress information the\ngovernment gathered unlawfully – and then weighed the parties’ competing interests in\nprivacy and disclosure. Id. at 1070-73. This balancing of interests standard is appropriate in\na qualified immunity case like ours only if, first, the plaintiff claims a violation of clearly\nestablished law. See, e.g. Sterling v. Borough of Minersville, 232 F.3d 190, 193-96 (3d Cir.\n2000) (stating that courts first ask whether plaintiff “had a protected privacy right,” then, if\nit exists, “whether it was clearly established at the time of its alleged violation,” and finally\nwhether there is a “legitimate [government] interest that can override the protections of the\nright to privacy.”) For the reasons discussed infra herein, Wyatt has not shown the existence\nof a clearly established privacy right, so we do not conduct the balancing of interests.\n\n                                               15\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831       Page: 16   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\n      Importantly, ACLU of Miss. was an appeal of a district court’s granting of\ncomplete public disclosure of agency files and thus did not involve the qualified\nimmunity framework fundamental to deciding this interlocutory appeal. The\nanalysis in ACLU of Miss. also focused in part on First Amendment concerns not\nrelevant in S.W.’s case, saying that “to the extent that [the] information [in the\nagency files] is a matter of public concern, any public need to know could be\nsatisfied by release of the information in a more limited format.” Id. at 1071.\nAlthough the public undoubtedly had an interest in obtaining information about\nthe defunct, anti-civil rights agency, the public’s interest could not prevail over\nthe plaintiffs’ right to privacy because the public interest could be addressed by\nthis option of selective disclosure. The ACLU of Miss. court also emphasized\nthat the personal information at issue was originally gathered by\nunconstitutional means (illegitimate searches and seizures by segregationist\nagency officials) pursuant to an unconstitutional purpose (suppressing speech\nof civil rights activists contrary in viewpoint to the agency), suggesting the court\nwas further motivated by fairness concerns inherent in the public release of\nprivate information the government never had a right to possess in the first\nplace. Id. at 1070.\n      Although the selective disclosure and fairness considerations in ACLU of\nMiss. are not analogous to the student-teacher-parent concerns in S.W.’s case,\nit is appropriate to point out that the “disclosure” here was only to the student’s\nmother; it was not discussed with other coaches, teachers, or students. Further,\ninstead of bluntly declaring her daughter to be a homosexual, it is undisputed\nthat the coaches mentioned to Wyatt only that S.W. was in a possibly\ninappropriate relationship with Nutt – thus narrowly tailoring the disclosure to\nthe mother’s “need to know.” Second, unlike the facts in ACLU of Miss., the\ngovernment here was not illegally and secretly collecting information in order\nto do harm to private citizens; disclosure of S.W.’s relationship was in the\n\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831      Page: 17    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-41359\n\ninterest of the student and became necessary only after S.W., allegedly\ninfluenced by Nutt, violated team rules and policy, which were in place for the\nbenefit and safety of students.\n      In summary, then, when we consider ACLU of Miss. and Fadjo, neither is\nestablished – much less clearly established – authority for the claims presented\nhere. It is of major significance that neither occurred in the context of public\nschools’ relations with their students and the students’ parents. We therefore\nhold there is no controlling Fifth Circuit authority – certainly not with “sufficient\nparticularity” – showing a clearly established Fourteenth Amendment privacy\nright that prohibits school officials from communicating to parents information\nregarding minor students’ interests, even when private matters of sex are\ninvolved. See Morgan, 659 F.3d at 372.\n                                         2.\n      Nor from outside the circuit do we find a “robust consensus of persuasive\nauthority” that such a right was clearly established. Id. (emphasis added). In\nher attempt to draw help from outside friends, Wyatt calls on the Third Circuit.\nSterling v. Borough of Minersville, she argues, stands for the proposition that\nthere is a clearly established privacy right in one’s sexual orientation. 232 F.3d\n190 (3d Cir. 2000). There, a police officer discovered two male teenagers in a\nparked car at night and threatened to disclose to one of the teenager’s relatives\nthe secret that the teenager was a homosexual. Id. at 192. The threat allegedly\nresulted in the teenager’s committing suicide. Id. In affirming an order denying\nsummary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, the Third Circuit held that\npublic disclosure by the government of a plaintiff’s sexual orientation can give\nrise to a constitutional claim for the violation of privacy. Id. at 196. Because\nthere was a clearly established right to privacy in the Third Circuit, the\ndefendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. Id. at 196-98.\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831       Page: 18    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                    No. 11-41359\n\n      The Sterling decision is notable in several respects.           First, it is not\ncontrolling authority in this case and, thus, its reasoning, standing alone, is not\ndispositive for us today. Second, the deceased victim was not a minor, and the\ncourt noted this fact when it acknowledged that “because [plaintiff] was 18, there\nwas no reason for [the officer] to interfere with [plaintiff’s] family’s awareness\nof his sexual orientation.” Id. at 197-98 (emphasis added). This observation\nsuggests that the Sterling court may have considered a situation involving a\nminor, differently. Third, although Sterling held that the law regarding the\ndisclosure of one’s sexual orientation was “clearly established,” at least in the\nThird Circuit, in 1997, the court’s justifications for its doing so are dubious: cases\nfrom within the circuit that dealt with private medical and financial information\nand precedent from outside the circuit that was, at best, unclear on the issue.\nId. at 195-96; cf., id. at 198, 199 n.3 (Stapleton, J., dissenting) (“[A] person’s\nright to privacy in his or her sexual orientation simply was not clearly\nestablished in April of 1997” because, for example, “[t]he Fourth Circuit’s\ndecision in [Walls v. City of Petersburg, 895 F.2d 188, 193 (1990)] addressed the\nissue squarely . . . and reached the opposite conclusion . . . .”). Since Sterling, the\nSupreme Court has repeatedly admonished courts to avoid finding “clearly\nestablished” law through such a loose method; looking to precedent that is, at\nbest, inconclusive, and, at worst, irrelevant, as Sterling did, simply no longer\nsuffices. See, e.g. Brousseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198-201 (2004) (holding\nthat, when none of a “handful” of cases “squarely govern” the specific factual\ncircumstances in a § 1983 suit, the cases do not clearly establish – in the\nmandatory “particularized sense” – a right that was violated).\n      In our case today, the trial court cited other cases from outside the circuit\non its way to denying summary judgment to the coaches. Perhaps the most\nsalient distinguishing factor in all these cases is that none occurred in a school\ncontext; together, they establish only the simple and unsurprising proposition\n\n                                          18\n\f    Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831          Page: 19      Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\nthat individuals generally can have a privacy interest in some personal “sexual\nmatters,” a broad, general proposition with which we do not take issue.17 None\nof these cases approximate the factual context we have before us, and none of\nthem provide any guidance regarding the crucial question: whether a student\nhas a privacy right under the Fourteenth Amendment that forbids school\nofficials from discussing student sexual information during meetings with\nparents.18\n       In sum, then, we hold that Wyatt has not alleged a clearly established\nconstitutional right – drawn either from the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence,\nfrom our own precedent or from that of other circuits – that the coaches\n\n\n\n\n       17\n          The Second Circuit case, Powell v. Schriver, provides modest support for the existence\nof a privacy right to medical information. 175 F.3d 107, 112 (2d Cir. 1999) (“Individuals who\nare transsexuals are among those who possess a constitutional right to maintain medical\nconfidentiality.”) The Third Circuit case, Sterling, is discussed above. 232 F.3d 190. The\nSixth Circuit case found that a victim’s interest in preventing dissemination of intimate details\nof a rape implicates a fundamental right but that the public official who released those details\nto the public was nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity. Bloch v. Ribar, 156 F.3d 673,\n686-87 (6th Cir. 1998). The Ninth Circuit case held that a woman who applied to work for a\nlocal police department had an interest in the nondisclosure, throughout the application\nprocess, of her sexual history but emphasized that “considering the sexual morality of []\nemployees” is not per se prohibited by the Constitution. Thorne v. City of El Segundo, 726 F.2d\n459, 468-70 (9th Cir. 1983). Finally, the Tenth Circuit case quotes Thorne, the Ninth Circuit\ncase, to establish essentially the same proposition. Eastwood v. Dept. of Corrections, 846 F.2d\n627, 631 (10th Cir. 1988).\n       18\n          The dissent criticizes our approach for not weighing S.W.’s interest against the\nschool’s. Because this is a qualified immunity case, a balancing of interests requires a clearly\nestablished right. We find no evidence of the existence of such a right; thus, we cannot reach\nthe question of whether the school’s interest outweighed S.W.’s. Obviously, if there is no\nclearly established right to begin with, we cannot “balance” it against anything.\n\n                                               19\n\f    Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831           Page: 20      Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\nviolated.19 The magistrate judge, therefore, erred in denying qualified immunity\nto each of the defendants on each of the federal claims.\n                                               V.\n       To summarize our opinion today: we hold that the magistrate judge erred\nin denying Newell and Fletcher summary judgment on the claims of qualified\nimmunity. It was error because there is no Supreme Court or Fifth Circuit case\nthat clearly establishes or even suggests that a high school student has a Fourth\nAmendment right that bars the student from being questioned by coaches in a\nlocker room or a Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy that bars a teacher or\ncoach from discussing the student’s private matters with the student’s parents.\nFletcher and Newell were entitled to qualified immunity for this suit with\nrespect to the federal claims, because, based on undisputed facts, there was no\nviolation of a clearly established federal right. Jones, 203 F.3d at 879. For the\nabove reasons, the judgment is reversed and vacated with respect to all federal\nclaims against the individual defendants, and the case is remanded for entry of\nthe appropriate judgment not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                              REVERSED and VACATED in part, and\n                                                 REMANDED for entry of judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n          The dissent chides us for “fail[ing] to provide any authority for [our] finding that the\nright to privacy in personal sexual matters does not extend to high school students.” We make\nno such finding; we only conclude that such a right is not clearly established. Furthermore,\nas noted supra herein, the burden is not on us to find authority for Wyatt’s position. In\nqualified immunity cases, “the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that a government official\nis not entitled to qualified immunity.” Michalik, 422 F.3d at 258. When a public official, like\nNewell and Fletcher here, pleads good faith, “the burden [shifts] to the plaintiff, who must\nrebut the defense by establishing that the officer’s allegedly wrongful conduct violated clearly\nestablished law.” Id. at 262. Wyatt simply has not met her burden.\n\n                                               20\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 21     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nGRAVES, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n       I disagree with the majority’s finding that high school students have no\nclearly established rights under the Fourteenth and Fourth Amendments.\nBecause I would affirm the district court’s denial of qualified immunity to\ncoaches Cassandra Newell and Rhonda Fletcher, I respectfully dissent.\n                                    Factual History\n       S.W. was a 16-year-old softball player at Kilgore High School (KHS) in\nTexas. S.W., who had told only a few friends that she was gay, became\ninvolved in a relationship with 18-year-old Hillary Nutt. The softball coaches,\nNewell and Fletcher, claimed that they had heard a rumor1 that S.W. had\ntold someone she was involved in a relationship with Nutt and that Nutt was\nNewell’s ex-girlfriend. Newell is gay and admitted in her deposition that\nNutt started attending softball games after being invited by Newell’s former\ngirlfriend.\n       Upon hearing this rumor, the coaches decided to confront S.W. They\narranged an off-campus meeting after school on March 3, 2009. During this\nmeeting, the coaches locked S.W. in the softball locker room and aggressively\nquestioned her at length about her relationship with Nutt, her sexual\norientation, and whether she had told anyone about Newell’s alleged\nrelationship with Nutt. S.W. indicated that she was afraid and sat on a\nbeanbag chair with her arms wrapped around her knees, while the coaches\n\n\n       1\n         The majority erroneously states that S.W. admitted to starting a rumor. S.W. did not\nadmit to starting any rumor. S.W. admitted to having a “private conversation with one\nperson” after that person pressed S.W. for an opinion on Newell’s sexuality. Further, there\nis no dispute that Newell is gay and brought her girlfriend to softball games. With regard to\nextraneous “facts,” S.W. did not admit to “routinely showing up late and using profanity at\npractice.” S.W. admitted to being required to run for being late and/or using profanity when\nshe accidentally hit herself in the kneecap with a bat “maybe two or three” times in 2009,\nwhich is the time period in question. However, there is absolutely no claim by the coaches that\nthey met with Wyatt to discuss S.W. being late or using profanity, minor team infractions for\nwhich S.W. had already been punished along with other players.\n\n                                              21\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 22     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nsat on their knees. At one point, Fletcher raised up, towering over S.W., and\nyelled at her. Fletcher asked S.W. if she was having a relationship with Nutt.\nWhile S.W. did say in her deposition that the coaches did not use the word\n“lesbian,” she said in her declaration that they asked if she was gay. S.W.\nalso said that the coaches got very angry, repeatedly called her a “liar,”\nthreatened her, and made intimidating gestures to the point that she thought\nFletcher might hit her.\n       The coaches then called S.W.’s mother, Barbara Wyatt, arranged a\nmeeting with her a short time later, and disclosed to her that S.W. was\nhaving an inappropriate relationship with another female. The coaches also\nrevealed the identity of S.W.’s “girlfriend” to Wyatt, who was unaware that\nS.W. was gay.2 Wyatt testified in her deposition that, although she had\nsuspected that S.W. may be gay, S.W. had always denied it to her.\n       The coaches then refused to discuss the matter further. S.W. was later\nremoved from the softball team. Wyatt attempted to resolve the situation\nthrough school officials and then by filing official complaints, which were\ndenied. Subsequently, Wyatt filed an action in district court, asserting that\nthe coaches violated S.W.’s privacy rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments and under the Texas Constitution. The coaches filed a motion\nfor summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court\ndenied the motion, and the coaches filed an interlocutory appeal. The\nmajority states that Wyatt’s claim has “become ever more nuanced” and that\n\n\n       2\n        Contrary to the majority’s statement in footnote 4 regarding “undisputed” facts, while\nS.W. admitted that she had confided in some friends regarding her sexual orientation, it is\nundisputed that she had never told her mother. With regard to “skipping down the hallway\nholding hands,” S.W. was asked during her deposition if she had “ever held hands in the\nhallway with a girl.” S.W. responded that she and two other girls had held hands and skipped\ndown the hallway, but clarified twice that it was nothing homosexual. The clothing\nrepresenting “society’s symbol for gay pride” was a belt with studs on it forming the shape of\na rainbow that S.W. had worn twice over a few-months’ time.\n\n                                             22\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831      Page: 23   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nher “claim is now that she inferred S.W.’s sexual orientation from the coaches’\ncomments.” In fact, Wyatt has consistently maintained that the coaches told\nher S.W. was dating a girl and characterized Nutt as S.W.’s “girlfriend.”\n                             Standard of Review\n      As correctly stated by the majority, this court reviews de novo a district\ncourt’s denial of a motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified\nimmunity. Kovacic v. Villarreal, 628 F.3d 209, 211 (5th Cir. 2010). “The\ncourt shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The denial of a motion\nfor summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity is immediately\nappealable, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law. Kovacic, 628 F.3d at\n211. The limitation of the interlocutory appellate jurisdiction to questions of\nlaw prohibits this court’s consideration of the correctness of plaintiff’s version\nof the facts. Good v. Curtis, 601 F.3d 393, 397 (5th Cir. 2010).\n             This means that the district court’s finding that a genuine\n      factual dispute exists is a factual determination that this court is\n      prohibited from reviewing in this interlocutory appeal. But the\n      district court’s determination that a particular dispute is material\n      is a reviewable legal determination. Thus, a defendant\n      challenging the denial of a motion for summary judgment on the\n      basis of qualified immunity must be prepared to concede the best\n      view of the facts to the plaintiff and discuss only the legal issues\n      raised by the appeal.\n\nId. at 397-98. (Internal marks, citations and emphasis omitted).\n      The majority erroneously fails to concede the best view of the facts to\nthe plaintiff, apparently under this Court’s authority to decide whether the\nfactual disputes are material to deciding the summary judgment. Wagner v.\nBay City, 227 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir. 2000). While it is correct that we can\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\f   Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831     Page: 24    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-41359\n\nreview the materiality of factual disputes, we must keep in mind what this\nCourt said in the excessive force case of Wagner. There, this Court said:\n      In deciding an interlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified\n      immunity, we can review the materiality of any factual disputes,\n      but not their genuineness. See Colston v. Barnhart, 146 F.3d 282,\n      284 (5th Cir.) (on petition for rehearing en banc), cert. denied, 525\n      U.S. 1054, 119 S.Ct. 618, 142 L.Ed.2d 557 (1998). So, we review\n      the complaint and record to determine whether, assuming that all\n      of Wagner's factual assertions are true, those facts are materially\n      sufficient to establish that defendants acted in an objectively\n      unreasonable manner. Even where, as here, the district court has\n      determined that there are genuine disputes raised by the\n      evidence, we assume plaintiff's version of the facts is true, then\n      determine whether those facts suffice for a claim of excessive\n      force under these circumstances.\n\nWagner, 227 F.3d 320. Rather than weigh Wyatt’s version of the facts and\ncompare it to the coaches’ version, this Court must decide whether the facts\nas presented by Wyatt are materially sufficient to establish that the coaches\nacted in an objectively unreasonable manner.\n                             Qualified Immunity\n      When a defendant moves for summary judgment on the basis of\nqualified immunity, the court must decide: 1) Whether the facts made out a\nviolation of a constitutional right; and 2) whether that right was “clearly\nestablished” at the time of the defendant’s alleged misconduct so that a\nreasonable official in the defendant’s situation would have understood that\nhis conduct violated that right. See Ontiveros v. City of Rosenberg, Tex., 564\nF.3d 379 (5th Cir. 2009). See also Brewer v. Wilkinson, 3 F.3d 816 (5th Cir.\n1993).\n                               Right of Privacy\n      With regard to the Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy violation,\nthe district court found that there is a constitutional right to prevent the\n\n\n                                       24\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831     Page: 25   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-41359\n\nunauthorized disclosure of one’s sexual orientation, and cites various cases\nfrom this Circuit and beyond in support of such a proposition. I agree with\nthe district court’s analysis.\n      The majority acknowledges that the United States Supreme Court has\nrecognized an individual interest in avoiding the disclosure of personal\nmatters, but then finds that Wyatt has failed to allege a clearly established\nconstitutional right. There is no dispute that one’s sexual orientation is a\npersonal matter. The majority attempts to distinguish the cases cited by the\ndistrict court and Wyatt on the basis that none occurred in the school context.\nHowever, the majority ultimately concedes that individuals have a privacy\ninterest in personal sexual matters. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599, 97\nS.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977). See also Fadjo v. Coon, 633 F.2d 1172 (5th\nCir. 1981), and ACLU v. State of Miss., 911 F.2d 1066, 1070 (5th Cir. 1990).\nBut, as discussed more fully herein, the majority then finds that any such\nright does not extend to high school students.\n      At least five other circuits have recognized a right of privacy regarding\npersonal sexual matters. See Sterling v. Borough of Minersville, 232 F.3d\n190, 196 (3d Cir. 2000) (“It is difficult to imagine a more private matter than\none's sexuality and a less likely probability that the government would have a\nlegitimate interest in disclosure of sexual identity.”)(“We can, therefore,\nreadily conclude that Wayman’s sexual orientation was an intimate aspect of\nhis personality entitled to privacy protection under Whalen.”); Powell v.\nSchriver, 175 F.3d 107, 111 (2nd Cir. 1999)(“We conclude that the reasoning\nthat supports the holding in Doe compels the conclusion that the Constitution\ndoes indeed protect the right to maintain the confidentiality of one's\ntranssexualism.”); Bloch v. Ribar, 156 F.3d 673, 685-86 (6th Cir. 1998) (“Our\nsexuality and choices about sex, in turn, are interests of an intimate nature\nwhich define significant portions of our personhood. Publically revealing\n\n                                       25\n\f   Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831      Page: 26   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\ninformation regarding these interests exposes an aspect of our lives that we\nregard as highly personal and private. Indeed, for many of these reasons, a\nnumber of our sister circuits have concluded that information regarding\nprivate sexual matters warrants constitutional protection against public\ndissemination.”); and Thorne v. City of El Segundo, 726 F.2d 459, 468 (9th\nCir. 1983) (“The interests Thorne raises in the privacy of her sexual activities\nare within the zone protected by the constitution. This conclusion follows\nfrom the cases holding that such basic matters as contraception, abortion,\nmarriage, and family life are protected by the constitution from unwarranted\ngovernment intrusion.”); and Eastwood v. Dept. of Corrections, 846 F.2d 627,\n631 (10th Cir. 1988) (“As in Thorne, plaintiff in the instant case was forced to\nanswer a number of irrelevant and embarrassing questions. . . . Indications\nof a victim's promiscuity are not probative of either credibility or consent to\nsexual advances. . . . Nor should such an inquiry be sanctioned in this case.”).\nWhile this authority may not be controlling, it is certainly persuasive.\n      Significantly, the majority fails to provide any authority for its finding\nthat the right to privacy in personal sexual matters does not extend to high\nschool students. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has found that the\nconstitutional right to privacy extends to minors. See Application of Gault,\n387 U.S. 1, 13, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967). The question is then\nwhether minors lose that right upon entering the schoolhouse gate. The only\ncases cited by the majority, albeit in the Fourth Amendment analysis,\nregarding high school students do not support the majority’s finding that the\nright to privacy does not extend to high school students. See Vernonia School\nDistrict 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 655-56 (1995) and Milligan v. City of\nSlidell, 226 F.3d 652, 654-55 (5th Cir. 2000), discussed more fully herein.\n      Based on the applicable case law set out above, there clearly exists a\nright to privacy regarding one’s sexual orientation. The findings of the\n\n                                       26\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831       Page: 27   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nUnited States Supreme Court and six Circuit Courts of Appeal (including the\n5th) that information of a sexual nature is intrinsically private is more than a\n“simple and unsurprising proposition.” Additionally, the school context does\nnot defeat the very existence of a right, but rather comes into play with\nregard to a balancing test and whether the government’s interest outweighs a\nstudent’s privacy right. “Thus, while children assuredly do not ‘shed their\nconstitutional rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate,’ the nature of those rights is\nwhat is appropriate for children in school.” Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 655-56\n(internal citations omitted). Based on the applicable authority and the\ncoaches’ own admissions that they recognized the private nature of the\ninformation, the district court is absolutely correct that sexual orientation\nwould fall within the categories of highly personal information protected by\nthe right to privacy. The district court correctly held that, while the 5th\nCircuit has never explicitly held that a student has a right to privacy in\nkeeping his or her sexual orientation confidential, an analysis of precedent\ncompels the finding of such a right.\n      The question then becomes whether the coaches had a legitimate\ninterest which outweighed S.W.’s right to privacy. See Fadjo, 633 F.2d at\n1176. See also Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 656-57. The majority does not reach\nthis balancing test, finding that consideration of the objectively reasonable\nprong of qualified immunity is unnecessary. However, this prong is necessary\nto determine whether the coaches’ interests outweigh a student’s right to\nprivacy.\n      In support of a legitimate State interest, the coaches assert various\nreasons, including the possible sexual assault of a minor under Texas statute,\nNutt being a bad influence, a violation of rules for S.W. riding with Nutt, and\nteam discipline. Both the law and the facts undermine the legitimacy of the\nreasons given by the coaches. The Texas statute referred to by the majority\n\n                                        27\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831      Page: 28   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nspecifically provides an affirmative defense because S.W. was over 14 and\nthere was only two-years age difference between S.W. and Nutt. Thus, there\nwas likely no valid legal concern regarding sexual assault.\n      With regard to Nutt being a bad influence, after indicating during her\ndeposition that she did not know of Nutt ever doing drugs, S.W. was asked,\n“[y]ou don’t know whether or not Hillary Nutt has ever taken a sip of\nalcohol?” S.W. responded that she knew Nutt had taken a drink but never in\nher presence. Also, S.W. was not asked if she knew where Nutt had taken\nthat “sip of alcohol” or the applicable drinking age of the location. Further,\nCoach Newell testified a resounding “No” when asked during her deposition,\n“So, just to clarify, did you consider Hillary Nutt, the woman that your\ngirlfriend invited to see your team members play, to be a threat to any of your\n– any of the players on your team ever?” Thus, there is no indication that\nNutt was “potentially dangerous” or an “underage user of illegal drugs and\nalcohol.”\n      The claim of S.W. violating a team rule for riding with Nutt is also\nunsupported by the facts. The team rule involves a permission slip that\npertains to, inter alia, in-school transportation by other softball players\nbetween 6th and 7th periods for practice. Nutt was not listed on the\npermission slip. However, the permission slip does not regulate riding with\nanyone outside of softball. To construe this permission slip to apply to drivers\nnot on the softball team is erroneous and would mean that neither Wyatt nor\nS.W.’s grandmother would have ever been able to transport S.W. because\nneither are listed on the permission slip. Yet, the coaches repeatedly said\nboth Wyatt and the grandmother could also transport S.W.\n      As to team dissension caused by rumors of S.W.’s involvement with\nNutt, we are, again, bound by S.W.’s facts - that she did not spread any\nrumors. Further, the coaches could not have known of any alleged dissension\n\n                                       28\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831     Page: 29   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-41359\n\nas this alleged “rumor” did not come to light until March 3, the day the\ncoaches interrogated S.W. and revealed her sexual orientation to her mother.\nBut the coaches dismissed the rest of the softball team prior to the “meeting”\nwith S.W. Also, the allegation regarding dissension emanates from the\ncoaches’ version of the facts.\n      More importantly, the only thing the coaches knew prior to\ninterrogating S.W. was a rumor that she had allegedly told someone that she\nwas in a relationship with Nutt and that Nutt was Newell’s ex-girlfriend.\nThere was no evidence that S.W. was actually in a relationship with Nutt,\nthat it was a sexual relationship, that S.W. lied about anything or had ever\nridden with Nutt. The coaches did not find out that S.W. was actually\ninvolved in a relationship, albeit apparently never sexual, with Nutt until\nthey interrogated S.W. The record indicates that the coaches also did not find\nout that S.W. was riding with Nutt until after they met with S.W. Moreover,\nFletcher admitted as much in her deposition when she testified that the\ncoaches called Wyatt to the field because they wanted her to help stop the\nspreading of rumors about Newell and because S.W. was “dating” an “adult.”\n      The district court fully considered all of the above and found that there\nwas sufficient evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that\nthe coaches were not motivated by the need to protect S.W. but rather were\nretaliating against S.W. for allegedly spreading a rumor about Newell. The\nState has no interest in retaliating against students. As the district court\nfound, even if the coaches were motivated by a desire to protect S.W., Wyatt\nprovided expert testimony that the coaches’ actions “were not a reasonable\nresponse to any potential concerns they may have had regarding S.W. or her\nwelfare.” The district court further found that, based on the record, it could\nnot find that the States’ interest outweighed S.W.’s right to keep her sexual\norientation confidential, and that S.W.’s rights were clearly established at the\n\n                                       29\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 30     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\ntime. The district court also found that there were substantial unresolved\nquestions of fact surrounding the circumstances leading up to the\nconfrontation and the content of the coaches conversation with Wyatt that\nprevent it from making a qualified immunity determination. “Without a\nfactual determination by the appropriate trier of fact, this Court cannot\nresolve the legal question as to whether the Defendants’ actions are amenable\nto a qualified immunity defense on this claim,” concluded the district court. I\nagree.\n                                Unreasonable Seizure\n       With regard to the Fourth Amendment claim based on the\nconfrontation in the locker room, the majority says that the district court\noverlooked case law that establishes that the Fourth Amendment applies\ndifferently in the school context and particularly with regard to student\nathletes in locker rooms. Again, the majority cites Vernonia, 515 U.S. 646,\nand Milligan, 226 F.3d 652, for the diminished expectation of privacy of\nschool children, particularly student athletes. However, neither case\nsupports any such finding.\n       Vernonia was a case involving random urinalysis drug testing of\nstudent athletes. The majority cites this case for the proposition that athletes\nhave less privacy expectations and that locker rooms are “not notable for the\n[Fourth Amendment] privacy they afford.” Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 657.3 But\nthose propositions have absolutely nothing to do with the instant case. The\nSupreme Court specifically said:\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         The majority asserts that the seizure behind locked doors was proper because, by\nchoosing to be a student athlete, S.W. subjected herself to a higher degree of regulation, but\nthen cites Milligan for the proposition that actually being a student athlete has nothing to do\nwith it. I note that Milligan involved questioning of students by police officers regarding\npossible illegal acts, i.e., fights involving weapons.\n\n                                              30\n\f   Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831       Page: 31   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\n      While we do not, of course, suggest that public schools as a\n      general matter have such a degree of control over children as to\n      give rise to a constitutional “duty to protect,” we have\n      acknowledged that for many purposes “school authorities ac[t] in\n      loco parentis,” with the power and indeed the duty to “inculcate\n      the habits and manners of civility,” Thus, while children\n      assuredly do not “shed their constitutional rights ... at the\n      schoolhouse gate,” the nature of those rights is what is\n      appropriate for children in school.\nVernonia, 515 U.S. at 655. (Internal citations, marks omitted). The Court\nfurther said:\n      Legitimate privacy expectations are even less with regard to\n      student athletes. School sports are not for the bashful. They\n      require “suiting up” before each practice or event, and showering\n      and changing afterwards. Public school locker rooms, the usual\n      sites for these activities, are not notable for the privacy they\n      afford. The locker rooms in Vernonia are typical: No individual\n      dressing rooms are provided; shower heads are lined up along a\n      wall, unseparated by any sort of partition or curtain; not even all\n      the toilet stalls have doors. As the United States Court of Appeals\n      for the Seventh Circuit has noted, there is “an element of\n      ‘communal undress' inherent in athletic participation.”\nVernonia, 515 U.S. at 657. (Internal citations omitted). This case has\nnothing to do with physical privacy in a locker room or even compliance with\nestablished rules such as random drug testing. That said, even conceding a\ndiminished expectation of privacy, the Court’s further analysis regarding\nrandom drug testing is telling:\n      Having considered the scope of the legitimate expectation of\n      privacy at issue here, we turn next to the character of the\n      intrusion that is complained of. We recognized in Skinner that\n      collecting the samples for urinalysis intrudes upon “an excretory\n      function traditionally shielded by great privacy.” We noted,\n      however, that the degree of intrusion depends upon the manner\n      in which production of the urine sample is monitored. . . . These\n      conditions are nearly identical to those typically encountered in\n      public restrooms, which men, women, and especially\n      schoolchildren use daily. Under such conditions, the privacy\n\n                                      31\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 32     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\n       interests compromised by the process of obtaining the urine\n       sample are in our view negligible.\n\n       The other privacy-invasive aspect of urinalysis is, of course, the\n       information it discloses concerning the state of the subject's body,\n       and the materials he has ingested. In this regard it is significant\n       that the tests at issue here look only for drugs, and not for\n       whether the student is, for example, epileptic, pregnant, or\n       diabetic. Moreover, the drugs for which the samples are screened\n       are standard, and do not vary according to the identity of the\n       student. And finally, the results of the tests are disclosed only to\n       a limited class of school personnel who have a need to know; and\n       they are not turned over to law enforcement authorities or used\n       for any internal disciplinary function.\nVernonia, 515 U.S. at 658. (Internal citations omitted).4\n       Here, there was no policy regarding lesbian relationships. In fact, at\nleast one of the coaches and other members of the softball team were gay.\nNewell testified in her deposition that she had not made efforts to find out\nabout other players’ relationships and had never informed any other parents\nof who their children were dating. The results of the interrogation were not\ndisclosed only to a limited class of school personnel who had a need to know,\nbut were instead turned over to S.W.’s mother.\n       The Fourth Amendment claim involves the coaches’ locking S.W. in the\nlocker room and confronting her - not the invasion of privacy under the\nFourteenth Amendment which involved the disclosure of her sexual\norientation to her mother. Therefore, the majority incorrectly finds that the\ndistrict court overlooked case law. Further, the majority finds that verbal\nabuse does not give rise to a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nand, “thus, there is simply no clearly established constitutional right.” Again,\n\n\n\n       4\n         The Court further addressed the provision of the drug testing policy that required\nstudents to identify prescription medications in advance if they wanted to avoid sanctions for\na false positive drug test.\n\n                                             32\n\f    Case: 11-41359         Document: 00512258831           Page: 33     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                         No. 11-41359\n\nthe majority errs. The case cited by the majority, Calhoun v. Hargrove, 312\nF.3d 730, 734 (5th Cir. 2002), for the proposition that verbal abuse does not\ngive rise to a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 actually says:\n        A claim for relief under § 1983 must allege the deprivation of a\n       right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States\n       by a defendant acting under color of state law. Wong v. Stripling,\n       881 F.2d 200, 202 (5th Cir.1989). Furthermore, under 42 U.S.C. §\n       1997e(e), “[n]o federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner\n       confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental\n       or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior\n       showing of physical injury.”\n\nCalhoun, 312 F.3d at 734.\n       This is not a suit by a prisoner and there is no applicable federal\nstatute requiring physical injury. Notwithstanding the inapplicability of\nCalhoun5, verbal abuse is only one of the actions cited by Wyatt. The others\nincluded locking S.W. in the locker room, interrogating her, intimidating\ngestures, etc. Under the same authority as the Fourteenth Amendment\nanalysis above, there clearly exists a Fourth Amendment right against\nunreasonable seizure/false imprisonment. The majority ignores the balancing\ntest which is required to determine whether the State’s interest outweighs\n\n\n       5\n         Notably, while dismissing as uncontrolling the abundant authority from other circuits\nthat supports Wyatt’s position, the majority attempts to also rely on Doe v. Gooden, 214 F.3d\n952, 955 (8th Cir. 2000), and Walker-Serrano by Walker v. Leonard, 168 F.Supp.2d 332, 347\n(M.D. Pa. 2001), for its proposition that verbal abuse does not give rise to a constitutional\nviolation. In Gooden, the Eighth Circuit found that the teacher’s statements did not amount\nto a constitutional violation, but did not foreclose the possibility of such, saying: “Verbal abuse\nis normally not a constitutional violation.” 214 F.3d at 955. In Walker, the Pennsylvania\ndistrict court cited Gooden for the proposition that “verbal abuse, whether coming from a\nstudent or a teacher, is not a constitutional violation.” Walker, 168 F.Supp.2d at 348.\nHowever, Gooden does not say that. Gooden, 214 F.3d at 955. Further, Walker was a First\nAmendment case involving an elementary student’s petition against a school field trip to a\ncircus. The plaintiff also claimed emotional distress for teasing from other students after she\nand her mother boycotted the field trip and protested outside the circus. Importantly, the\ndistrict court repeatedly indicated that elementary students do not enjoy the same clearly\nestablished rights as high school students.\n\n                                               33\n\f   Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831     Page: 34   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-41359\n\nS.W.’s right against unreasonable seizure. Instead, the majority presumably\nfinds that such a right does not clearly exist for high school students and,\nthus, there is no need to determine objective reasonableness. I disagree. As\nstated previously, school children do not shed their constitutional rights at\nthe schoolhouse gate. The majority fails to cite any authority to indicate that\nthe Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure does not\nextend to high school students. A consideration of the objectively reasonable\nprong is necessary.\n      For the same reasons stated in the Fourteenth Amendment right to\nprivacy discussion, I would conclude that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact and that summary judgment was correctly denied.\n                                 Conclusion\n      Accordingly, I would find that Wyatt has alleged clearly established\nconstitutional rights and that there are genuine issues of material fact\nsufficient to warrant denial of summary judgment on the basis of qualified\nimmunity. Because I would affirm the district court, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                       34\n\f",

GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:\n      As next-friend of her minor daughter “S.W.”, Barbara Wyatt brought this\nsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against high school softball coaches Rhonda Fletcher\nand Cassandra Newell. Wyatt alleges the coaches disclosed S.W.’s sexual\norientation during a disciplinary meeting with S.W.’s mother, primarily claiming\nthe disclosure to the mother constituted a Fourteenth Amendment invasion of\nS.W.’s privacy. Wyatt also alleged a Fourth Amendment claim based on a\ndisciplinary confrontation in a locked locker room. On the coaches’ motion for\nsummary judgment, the district court denied qualified immunity to Fletcher and\nNewell on the ground that genuine issues of material fact were disputed. We\ndisagree and reverse. We hold that there is no clearly established law holding\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831      Page: 2    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nthat a student in a public secondary school has a privacy right under the\nFourteenth Amendment that precludes school officials from discussing with a\nparent the student’s private matters, including matters relating to sexual\nactivity of the student. We further hold that such students have no clearly\nestablished Fourth Amendment right that bars a student-coach confrontation in\na closed and locked room. We thus conclude that these individual defendants\nare entitled to qualified immunity that bars the federal claims against them,\nand, consequently, we REVERSE and VACATE in part and REMAND for entry\nof judgment dismissing the federal claims against these individual defendants.\n                                         I.\n      The first matter we must deal with in this qualified immunity case is the\nbasis of our jurisdiction. On this interlocutory appeal, we have before us the\ndistrict court’s denial of the coaches’ motion for summary judgment asserting the\nclaim of qualified immunity. Our review is de novo. Flores v.

Nor are Wyatt’s claims against Douglas Duke before us, see infra n.9. The only\nappellants in this case are Fletcher and Newell. To the extent that Wyatt brings state law\nclaims against Fletcher and Newell under the Texas Constitution and Texas common law,\nthose claims are not before us on this appeal.\n       2\n        We stress that our holdings here are narrow: they address only whether the specific\nconstitutional rights in this case are clearly established.\n\n                                            3\n\f     Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831           Page: 4     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\nlocker room, locked the door, and questioned her about an alleged relationship\nwith an older young woman named Hillary Nutt (“Nutt”). Wyatt said that the\ncoaches then yelled at S.W., falsely accused her of spreading rumors regarding\none of the coaches’ sexual orientation,3 and threatened to tell S.W.’s mother that\nher daughter was in a sexual relationship with another woman.4                           In her\ncomplaint, Wyatt made a further allegation: that, at the locker room meeting,\n“Fletcher asked S.W. if she was gay.” In her deposition, however, S.W.’s story\nchanged: she said definitively that the coaches did not ask, point blank, whether\nshe was a lesbian. Besides this inconsistency, there is one more worthy of note:\nin her complaint, Wyatt states, “At the time of Fletcher and Newell’s\nconfrontation, S.W. was dating [Nutt].” But in her appellate brief, she says “in\nfact, [S.W.] and Hillary [Nutt] hadn’t dated” and “weren’t in a relationship.”\n       Following the meeting with S.W., the coaches called Wyatt, S.W.’s mother,\nand requested they meet.5 The parties’ characterizations of events differ. In her\ncomplaint, Wyatt alleges that Fletcher revealed S.W.’s sexual orientation to her\n\n\n\n       3\n        The record indicates that S.W. has admitted to starting a rumor: in her affidavit, S.W.\nsaid that, on the day in question, she speculated on Newell’s sexual orientation to another\nstudent. Apparently, students began discussing this rumor, notes were passed in class, and\na student brought the matter to the coaches’ attention. Newell and Fletcher then called the\nmeeting. S.W.also admits to routinely showing up late and using profanity at practice.\n       4\n         Wyatt’s central claim is “privacy” in S.W.’s sexual orientation. The undisputed facts,\nhowever, indicate that S.W. talked about her sexual orientation with a close friend in 2007,\nadmitted she was gay to “five or six” friends the week before the events in question, wore\nclothing she describes as “society’s symbol for gay pride,” and “went skipping down the hallway\nholding hands” with another girl. Although these facts are in no way dispositive in our\nanalysis, we note them because they suggest S.W.’s sexual orientation was not a hermetically\nsealed secret in the school setting.\n       5\n         In the KHS “Parent Involvement Plan,” the school states its position that “the more\n[KHS] can communicate with parents, the greater success [it] will have in reaching our\nstudents. [KHS] want[s] parents involved in all aspects of our school from academics to\nextracurricular activities.” In its “Parent Involvement Policy,” KHS states its goal is to “strive\nto increase parental participation in school and encourage positive interaction between school\nand home.”\n\n                                                4\n\f     Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831          Page: 5     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\nmother at this second meeting and that Newell then offered Wyatt the contact\ninformation for Nutt. As with the locker room meeting, however, there are\ninconsistencies in Wyatt’s story. Wyatt’s allegation in her complaint was that,\nat the second meeting, the coaches “outed” her daughter: “Fletcher said [to\nWyatt that] S.W. was a lesbian.” Wyatt apparently withdrew this allegation\nwhen, at her deposition, she testified under oath that Coach Fletcher in fact\nnever used the word “gay” or “lesbian.” The claim involving the revelation of\nS.W.’s sexual orientation has become ever more nuanced over the course of the\nbriefing on this appeal: Instead of alleging that the coaches divulged, point-\nblank, her daughter’s homosexuality, Wyatt’s claim is now that she inferred\nS.W.’s sexual orientation from the coaches’ comments.6 In response, the coaches\nargue that they were obliged to contact S.W.’s mother because rumors regarding\nS.W.’s relationship with Nutt were causing dissension on the team, Nutt was a\npotentially dangerous and underage user of illegal drugs and alcohol, and any\npossible sexual relationship between Nutt and S.W. was a valid concern. See\nTEX. PENAL CODE § 22.011(a)(2).7\n                                               B.\n       Wyatt filed three separate grievances with Kilgore Independent School\nDistrict (“KISD”) alleging the coaches acted inappropriately by disclosing S.W.’s\n\n\n\n\n       6\n        In her deposition, however, Wyatt testified that she had suspected her daughter was\ngay prior to the events at issue in this case.\n       7\n          Although, for the purposes of summary judgment, we take the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to Wyatt, see Matsushita Elec.

S.W. concedes that\nshe broke multiple team rules, lied to Newell and Fletcher, and discussed Newell’s sexuality\nat school prior to the coaches’ decision to notify S.W.’s mother. Thus, the alleged “bad motives”\nof the coaches, which the dissent discusses in painful repetition, are incriminatingly tinged\nby S.W.’s own admissions, which demonstrate her culpability for her conduct of the same sort.\n\n                                               5\n\f     Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831         Page: 6     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nsexual orientation to her mother; all were subsequently dismissed.8 Then, on\nDecember 10, 2010, Wyatt, as next-friend of her minor daughter S.W., filed a\ncomplaint in federal court against KISD, and, in their personal capacities,\nagainst KHS assistant athletic director Douglas Duke,9 Fletcher, and Newell, for\nviolating S.W.’s federal rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\nand state privacy rights under the Texas Constitution.                   In their answer,\nDefendants pleaded the affirmative defense of Texas official immunity for KISD\non the state claims and qualified immunity for Fletcher and Newell on the\nfederal claims. The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge, and\nthe coaches moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.\nThe magistrate judge rejected the defense of qualified immunity and\nconsequently denied the coaches’ motion for summary judgment. The magistrate\njudge cited “multiple unresolved questions of fact.” With regard to Wyatt’s\nFourth Amendment claim of unlawful seizure, the court said “there remains a\ngenuine material issue of fact as to whether there was an objectively reasonable\nbasis for the coaches’ actions including factual disputes over what transpired\nbehind the closed doors of the locker room.” With regard to the Fourteenth\nAmendment right to privacy claim, the magistrate judge held that S.W.’s right\nto privacy in her sexual orientation was clearly established, and summary\njudgment was premature due to unresolved questions of fact – such as “whether\nthe Coaches[] disclosed S.W.’s sexual orientation as retaliation for S.W.’s\nconduct, whether they disclosed the identity of Ms. Nutt [to Ms. Wyatt] without\n\n\n       8\n         In her original grievance filed with KISD officials, however, Wyatt did not allege\nFletcher and Newell had “outed” her daughter but only that the coaches, following the\nmeetings outlined above, improperly removed S.W. from the softball team and that the athletic\ndepartment failed to respond to Wyatt’s queries in a timely fashion. In short, the claims made\nby Wyatt have been a constantly moving target.\n       9\n        The court later granted Wyatt’s motion to file an amended complaint and voluntarily\ndismiss Duke from the case; thus, he is not a party in this appeal.\n\n                                              6\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831      Page: 7    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nprovocation by Ms. Wyatt, and the words they used to describe the\nrelationship . . .”– all of which related to the reasonableness of their conduct.\n      As we have said, we lack appellate jurisdiction in this interlocutory appeal\nto determine whether a genuine factual issue exists; however, we do have\njurisdiction to review the materiality of disputed facts as well as the district\ncourt’s legal analysis as it pertains to qualified immunity. See Wagner, 227 F.3d\nat 320; see also Kinney, 367 F.3d at 358. As we will see, the magistrate judge\nerred in analyzing the materiality of disputed facts because, even taking the\nfacts in the light most favorable to Wyatt, Wyatt has not alleged violations of\nclearly established Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Consequently,\nwe have appellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.\n                                        III.\n      Our review of the magistrate judge’s legal analysis begins with setting out\nthe standard for qualified immunity. As we have indicated in many prior cases,\nevaluating qualified immunity is a two-step process, and the burden is on the\nplaintiff to prove that a government official is not entitled to qualified immunity.\nMichalik v.

Both steps in the qualified immunity analysis are\nquestions of law. Wooley, 211 F.3d at 919.\n       Under the Fifth Circuit standard, the doctrine of qualified immunity\nprotects government officials from civil damages liability when they reasonably\ncould have believed that their conduct was not barred by law, and immunity is\nnot denied unless existing precedent places the constitutional question beyond\ndebate.

Thus, consideration of the “objectively reasonable” prong\nof qualified immunity is unnecessary.\n\n                                               8\n\f     Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 9     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nAnswering in the affirmative requires the court to be able to point to “controlling\nauthority–or a robust consensus of persuasive authority–that defines the\ncontours of the right in question with a high degree of particularity.” Id. at 371-\n72 (citations and inset quotations omitted). This requirement establishes a high\nbar. When there is no controlling authority specifically prohibiting a defendant’s\nconduct, the law is not clearly established for the purposes of defeating qualified\nimmunity. See id. at 372. Acknowledging these clearly drawn bright lines as\nrigorous background principles of qualified immunity, we proceed to the merits\nof Wyatt’s privacy claim.\n                                             IV.\n       Wyatt’s assertions of federal liability have essentially morphed over the\ncourse of the litigation into one primary constitutional claim involving an alleged\nright to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is true that, originally,\nWyatt alleged two basic claims. In her complaint, Wyatt alleged a Fourth\nAmendment violation, saying that the coaches’ decision to “lock the locker room\ndoor and order S.W. to remain inside while Defendants confronted and\nthreatened her was a de facto seizure of S.W.’s person . . . .” However, in her\nappellate brief and at oral argument, Wyatt barely mentioned this seizure\nallegation. She cites no authorities establishing such a Fourth Amendment\nviolation in school contexts, making practically no effort to show the right in\nquestion is “clearly established.” When before the district court on summary\njudgment, however, the district court held there was a genuine issue of material\nfact relating to her claim of “seizure” – whether there was an objectively\nreasonable basis for the coaches’ actions in the locker room, which, according to\nS.W., included shouting, intimidating gestures, and locked doors.11 In so doing,\n\n\n       11\n          As mentioned earlier, however, S.W. has conceded that she was not asked in the\nlocker room whether she was gay, so, even taking the facts in the light most favorable to S.W.,\nthat specific allegation of her Fourth Amendment claim is not before us.\n\n                                              9\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 10     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nhowever, the court erred; there is no material disputed fact that prevented it\nfrom deciding the legal question. First, the district court overlooked case law\nthat establishes that the Fourth Amendment applies differently in the school\ncontext and particularly with regard to student athletes in locker rooms.

As seen in Milligan, courts have routinely applied Vernonia to contexts\nother than urinalysis testing. See 226 F.3d at 654-55.\n\n                                              10\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 11     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nforcefully, even in a locked locker room.13 Thus Newell and Fletcher are entitled\nto qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claim.\n       We are left only with Wyatt’s Fourteenth Amendment claim relating to the\ncoaches’ conversation with S.W’s mother. Under Wyatt’s theory, S.W. has a\nconstitutional right to the confidentiality– even with respect to her mother– of\nher own sexual orientation, which was breached by the coaches when they spoke\nto her about S.W.’s violations of team policy. In order to further understand the\nnature of Wyatt’s claim – and whether, for purposes of qualified immunity, the\nright purportedly violated is clearly established, we first briefly consider the\nmodern-day origin and subsequent development of the constitutional right to\nprivacy under the Fourteenth Amendment upon which Wyatt relies.\n                                              A.\n       We begin with Griswold v.

See id. at 485-86. The decision can be said to have validated an\nearlier dissent by Justice Brandeis in Olmstead v.

The first,\n\n\n\n       14\n           The dissent gives this error cloud cover and, in so doing, proceeds to miscomprehend\nthe qualified immunity analysis that is fundamental to deciding this case. The Supreme Court\n“has repeatedly told courts . . . not to define clearly established law at a high level of\ngenerality.” al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2084. Here, the district court and now, apparently, the\ndissent have redacted this directive from Supreme Court authority. They have allowed their\nanalysis to hinge on the existence of a Fourteenth Amendment general right to privacy and\nthe general possession of that right by some minors in some limited circumstances. As we\nobserve supra herein, the existence of a general right is established, and we do not take issue\nwith it. In order for liability to be imposed on public officials, however, qualified immunity\ncases require more than a bare allegation of a general right to nondisclosure of private\ninformation: “the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been ‘clearly\nestablished’ in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense.” Anderson, 483 U.S.\nat 640 (emphasis added). Otherwise, “[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified\nimmunity that our cases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply\nby alleging violation of [] abstract rights.” Id. at 639. The following two examples illustrate\nthe dissent’s errant approach: for the Supreme Court, “[t]he general proposition . . . that an\nunreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth Amendment is of little help in determining\nwhether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.” al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct.\nat 2084 (emphasis added). Similarly, “[T]he right to due process of law is quite clearly\nestablished by the Due Process Clause, and thus there is a sense in which any action that\nviolates that Clause . . . violates a clearly established right . . . .” Morgan, 659 F.2d at 372.\nBut that does not mean liability will be imposed on public officials, for the question is “whether\nthat right has been defined with sufficient clarity” and specificity “to enable a reasonable\nofficial to assess the lawfulness of his conduct.” Id. (emphasis added). The central concept is\nfair warning: “qualified immunity should not be denied unless the law is clear in the more\nparticularized sense that reasonable officials should be on notice that their conduct is\nunlawful.” Kinney, 367 F.3d at 350 (emphasis added) (inset quotation marks omitted). There\nis no authority – and none has been cited – that would put school officials on notice that\nspecific conversations between a teacher and a parent regarding a student’s conduct are\nbarred.\n\n                                               13\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831        Page: 14     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-41359\n\nFadjo v. Coon, concerned disclosure of an insurance beneficiary’s personal\ninformation in the context of a criminal investigation. 633 F.2d at 1174.\nPlaintiff Fadjo was the named beneficiary of life insurance policies insuring a\nman who mysteriously disappeared. Id. at 1174. After explicit assurances by\nthe state attorney that his testimony would be absolutely privileged, Fadjo, as\npart of the criminal investigation, provided the state with information\nconcerning “the most private details of his life.” Id. The state attorney then\nshared this information with insurance companies, resulting in personal\nmisfortune to Fadjo, who was forced to move his residence and struggled to find\nmeaningful employment. Id. Finding that Fadjo’s right to privacy had been\nviolated by the disclosure, the court held that there was an actionable § 1983\nclaim under the confidentiality branch of the Fourteenth Amendment15 and that\n“no legitimate state purpose existed sufficient to outweigh the invasion into\nFadjo’s privacy.” Id. at 1175. Notably, the court never discussed the specific\nnature of the “private details of Fadjo’s life” that were disclosed (i.e. details\nprivate enough to warrant constitutional protection), and the court never\nsuggested that sexual orientation might be one of them. Furthermore, the court\nstressed that Fadjo had been promised that the information he provided\ninvestigators would be confidential and that the plaintiff’s allegation was that\nthe state had not honored this pledge. Id. at 1176 (stating “Fadjo’s case is\ndistinguishable . . . since it involves the revelation of intimate information\nobtained under a pledge of confidentiality . . . .”) (emphasis added). In Wyatt’s\ncase, the coaches made no such promise to S.W.\n\n\n\n       15\n         The court, however, did not perform a detailed qualified immunity analysis.

This is so because such speculation does not establish\nspecifically that school officials are barred from communicating with parents\nregarding minor students’ behavior and welfare, when doing so might cause the\nparents to infer their child’s sexual orientation.\n       The second Fifth Circuit case Wyatt relies upon is American Civil Liberties\nUnion of Miss., Inc. v. Mississippi, 911 F.2d at 1066. That case concerned the\ndismantling of a state agency whose purpose was to perpetuate racial\nsegregation. Id. at 1068. After the agency had been shut down, the district\ncourt ordered that all agency files, including some containing sensitive, personal\ninformation of civil rights activists, be released to the general public. Id. This\ncourt reversed. We held that the public interest in full disclosure of the files was\noutweighed by the privacy concerns of the individuals whose information was\nobtained without permission.16 Id. at 1069. In the passage most relevant to the\ncase at bar, the court said that plaintiffs “undeniably have an interest in\nrestricting the disclosure of information” regarding “numerous instances of\n(often unsubstantiated) allegations of homosexuality, child molestation,\nillegitimate births, and sexual promiscuity . . . .” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n       16\n           In ACLU of Miss., the court in its discussion repeatedly pointed to clearly established\nrights – the right of a free press to publish matters of public concern, the public’s right to\naccess certain government documents, and individuals’ right to suppress information the\ngovernment gathered unlawfully – and then weighed the parties’ competing interests in\nprivacy and disclosure. Id. at 1070-73. This balancing of interests standard is appropriate in\na qualified immunity case like ours only if, first, the plaintiff claims a violation of clearly\nestablished law. See, e.g. Sterling v. Borough of Minersville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771089\"><a href=\"/opinion/771089/madonna-sterling-of-the-estate-of-marcus-anthony-wayman-v-borough-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193-96 (3d Cir.\n2000) (stating that courts first ask whether plaintiff “had a protected privacy right,” then, if\nit exists, “whether it was clearly established at the time of its alleged violation,” and finally\nwhether there is a “legitimate [government] interest that can override the protections of the\nright to privacy.”) For the reasons discussed infra herein, Wyatt has not shown the existence\nof a clearly established privacy right, so we do not conduct the balancing of interests.\n\n                                               15\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831       Page: 16   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\n      Importantly, ACLU of Miss. was an appeal of a district court’s granting of\ncomplete public disclosure of agency files and thus did not involve the qualified\nimmunity framework fundamental to deciding this interlocutory appeal. The\nanalysis in ACLU of Miss. also focused in part on First Amendment concerns not\nrelevant in S.W.’s case, saying that “to the extent that [the] information [in the\nagency files] is a matter of public concern, any public need to know could be\nsatisfied by release of the information in a more limited format.” Id. at 1071.\nAlthough the public undoubtedly had an interest in obtaining information about\nthe defunct, anti-civil rights agency, the public’s interest could not prevail over\nthe plaintiffs’ right to privacy because the public interest could be addressed by\nthis option of selective disclosure. The ACLU of Miss. court also emphasized\nthat the personal information at issue was originally gathered by\nunconstitutional means (illegitimate searches and seizures by segregationist\nagency officials) pursuant to an unconstitutional purpose (suppressing speech\nof civil rights activists contrary in viewpoint to the agency), suggesting the court\nwas further motivated by fairness concerns inherent in the public release of\nprivate information the government never had a right to possess in the first\nplace. Id. at 1070.\n      Although the selective disclosure and fairness considerations in ACLU of\nMiss. are not analogous to the student-teacher-parent concerns in S.W.’s case,\nit is appropriate to point out that the “disclosure” here was only to the student’s\nmother; it was not discussed with other coaches, teachers, or students. Further,\ninstead of bluntly declaring her daughter to be a homosexual, it is undisputed\nthat the coaches mentioned to Wyatt only that S.W. was in a possibly\ninappropriate relationship with Nutt – thus narrowly tailoring the disclosure to\nthe mother’s “need to know.” Second, unlike the facts in ACLU of Miss., the\ngovernment here was not illegally and secretly collecting information in order\nto do harm to private citizens; disclosure of S.W.’s relationship was in the\n\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831      Page: 17    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-41359\n\ninterest of the student and became necessary only after S.W., allegedly\ninfluenced by Nutt, violated team rules and policy, which were in place for the\nbenefit and safety of students.\n      In summary, then, when we consider ACLU of Miss. and Fadjo, neither is\nestablished – much less clearly established – authority for the claims presented\nhere. It is of major significance that neither occurred in the context of public\nschools’ relations with their students and the students’ parents. We therefore\nhold there is no controlling Fifth Circuit authority – certainly not with “sufficient\nparticularity” – showing a clearly established Fourteenth Amendment privacy\nright that prohibits school officials from communicating to parents information\nregarding minor students’ interests, even when private matters of sex are\ninvolved. See Morgan, 659 F.3d at 372.\n                                         2.\n      Nor from outside the circuit do we find a “robust consensus of persuasive\nauthority” that such a right was clearly established. Id. (emphasis added). In\nher attempt to draw help from outside friends, Wyatt calls on the Third Circuit.\nSterling v. Borough of Minersville, she argues, stands for the proposition that\nthere is a clearly established privacy right in one’s sexual orientation. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771089\"><a href=\"/opinion/771089/madonna-sterling-of-the-estate-of-marcus-anthony-wayman-v-borough-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2000). There, a police officer discovered two male teenagers in a\nparked car at night and threatened to disclose to one of the teenager’s relatives\nthe secret that the teenager was a homosexual. Id. at 192. The threat allegedly\nresulted in the teenager’s committing suicide. Id. In affirming an order denying\nsummary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, the Third Circuit held that\npublic disclosure by the government of a plaintiff’s sexual orientation can give\nrise to a constitutional claim for the violation of privacy. Id. at 196. Because\nthere was a clearly established right to privacy in the Third Circuit, the\ndefendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. Id. at 196-98.\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f    Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831       Page: 18    Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                    No. 11-41359\n\n      The Sterling decision is notable in several respects.           First, it is not\ncontrolling authority in this case and, thus, its reasoning, standing alone, is not\ndispositive for us today. Second, the deceased victim was not a minor, and the\ncourt noted this fact when it acknowledged that “because [plaintiff] was 18, there\nwas no reason for [the officer] to interfere with [plaintiff’s] family’s awareness\nof his sexual orientation.” Id. at 197-98 (emphasis added). This observation\nsuggests that the Sterling court may have considered a situation involving a\nminor, differently. Third, although Sterling held that the law regarding the\ndisclosure of one’s sexual orientation was “clearly established,” at least in the\nThird Circuit, in 1997, the court’s justifications for its doing so are dubious: cases\nfrom within the circuit that dealt with private medical and financial information\nand precedent from outside the circuit that was, at best, unclear on the issue.\nId. at 195-96; cf., id. at 198, 199 n.3 (Stapleton, J., dissenting) (“[A] person’s\nright to privacy in his or her sexual orientation simply was not clearly\nestablished in April of 1997” because, for example, “[t]he Fourth Circuit’s\ndecision in [Walls v.

Since Sterling, the\nSupreme Court has repeatedly admonished courts to avoid finding “clearly\nestablished” law through such a loose method; looking to precedent that is, at\nbest, inconclusive, and, at worst, irrelevant, as Sterling did, simply no longer\nsuffices. See, e.g. Brousseau v. Haugen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137736\"><a href=\"/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198-201 (2004) (holding\nthat, when none of a “handful” of cases “squarely govern” the specific factual\ncircumstances in a § 1983 suit, the cases do not clearly establish – in the\nmandatory “particularized sense” – a right that was violated).\n      In our case today, the trial court cited other cases from outside the circuit\non its way to denying summary judgment to the coaches. Perhaps the most\nsalient distinguishing factor in all these cases is that none occurred in a school\ncontext; together, they establish only the simple and unsurprising proposition\n\n                                          18\n\f    Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831          Page: 19      Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\nthat individuals generally can have a privacy interest in some personal “sexual\nmatters,” a broad, general proposition with which we do not take issue.17 None\nof these cases approximate the factual context we have before us, and none of\nthem provide any guidance regarding the crucial question: whether a student\nhas a privacy right under the Fourteenth Amendment that forbids school\nofficials from discussing student sexual information during meetings with\nparents.18\n       In sum, then, we hold that Wyatt has not alleged a clearly established\nconstitutional right – drawn either from the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence,\nfrom our own precedent or from that of other circuits – that the coaches\n\n\n\n\n       17\n          The Second Circuit case, Powell v.

Because this is a qualified immunity case, a balancing of interests requires a clearly\nestablished right. We find no evidence of the existence of such a right; thus, we cannot reach\nthe question of whether the school’s interest outweighed S.W.’s. Obviously, if there is no\nclearly established right to begin with, we cannot “balance” it against anything.\n\n                                               19\n\f    Case: 11-41359        Document: 00512258831           Page: 20      Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 11-41359\n\nviolated.19 The magistrate judge, therefore, erred in denying qualified immunity\nto each of the defendants on each of the federal claims.\n                                               V.\n       To summarize our opinion today: we hold that the magistrate judge erred\nin denying Newell and Fletcher summary judgment on the claims of qualified\nimmunity. It was error because there is no Supreme Court or Fifth Circuit case\nthat clearly establishes or even suggests that a high school student has a Fourth\nAmendment right that bars the student from being questioned by coaches in a\nlocker room or a Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy that bars a teacher or\ncoach from discussing the student’s private matters with the student’s parents.\nFletcher and Newell were entitled to qualified immunity for this suit with\nrespect to the federal claims, because, based on undisputed facts, there was no\nviolation of a clearly established federal right. Jones, 203 F.3d at 879. For the\nabove reasons, the judgment is reversed and vacated with respect to all federal\nclaims against the individual defendants, and the case is remanded for entry of\nthe appropriate judgment not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                              REVERSED and VACATED in part, and\n                                                 REMANDED for entry of judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       19\n          The dissent chides us for “fail[ing] to provide any authority for [our] finding that the\nright to privacy in personal sexual matters does not extend to high school students.” We make\nno such finding; we only conclude that such a right is not clearly established. Furthermore,\nas noted supra herein, the burden is not on us to find authority for Wyatt’s position. In\nqualified immunity cases, “the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that a government official\nis not entitled to qualified immunity.” Michalik, 422 F.3d at 258. When a public official, like\nNewell and Fletcher here, pleads good faith, “the burden [shifts] to the plaintiff, who must\nrebut the defense by establishing that the officer’s allegedly wrongful conduct violated clearly\nestablished law.” Id. at 262.

S.W., who had told only a few friends that she was gay, became\ninvolved in a relationship with 18-year-old Hillary Nutt. The softball coaches,\nNewell and Fletcher, claimed that they had heard a rumor1 that S.W. had\ntold someone she was involved in a relationship with Nutt and that Nutt was\nNewell’s ex-girlfriend. Newell is gay and admitted in her deposition that\nNutt started attending softball games after being invited by Newell’s former\ngirlfriend.\n       Upon hearing this rumor, the coaches decided to confront S.W. They\narranged an off-campus meeting after school on March 3, 2009. During this\nmeeting, the coaches locked S.W. in the softball locker room and aggressively\nquestioned her at length about her relationship with Nutt, her sexual\norientation, and whether she had told anyone about Newell’s alleged\nrelationship with Nutt. S.W. indicated that she was afraid and sat on a\nbeanbag chair with her arms wrapped around her knees, while the coaches\n\n\n       1\n         The majority erroneously states that S.W. admitted to starting a rumor. S.W. did not\nadmit to starting any rumor. S.W. admitted to having a “private conversation with one\nperson” after that person pressed S.W. for an opinion on Newell’s sexuality. Further, there\nis no dispute that Newell is gay and brought her girlfriend to softball games. With regard to\nextraneous “facts,” S.W. did not admit to “routinely showing up late and using profanity at\npractice.” S.W. admitted to being required to run for being late and/or using profanity when\nshe accidentally hit herself in the kneecap with a bat “maybe two or three” times in 2009,\nwhich is the time period in question. However, there is absolutely no claim by the coaches that\nthey met with Wyatt to discuss S.W. being late or using profanity, minor team infractions for\nwhich S.W. had already been punished along with other players.\n\n                                              21\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 22     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\nsat on their knees. At one point, Fletcher raised up, towering over S.W., and\nyelled at her. Fletcher asked S.W. if she was having a relationship with Nutt.\nWhile S.W. did say in her deposition that the coaches did not use the word\n“lesbian,” she said in her declaration that they asked if she was gay. S.W.\nalso said that the coaches got very angry, repeatedly called her a “liar,”\nthreatened her, and made intimidating gestures to the point that she thought\nFletcher might hit her.\n       The coaches then called S.W.’s mother, Barbara Wyatt, arranged a\nmeeting with her a short time later, and disclosed to her that S.W. was\nhaving an inappropriate relationship with another female. The coaches also\nrevealed the identity of S.W.’s “girlfriend” to Wyatt, who was unaware that\nS.W. was gay.2 Wyatt testified in her deposition that, although she had\nsuspected that S.W. may be gay, S.W. had always denied it to her.\n       The coaches then refused to discuss the matter further. S.W. was later\nremoved from the softball team. Wyatt attempted to resolve the situation\nthrough school officials and then by filing official complaints, which were\ndenied. Subsequently, Wyatt filed an action in district court, asserting that\nthe coaches violated S.W.’s privacy rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments and under the Texas Constitution. The coaches filed a motion\nfor summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court\ndenied the motion, and the coaches filed an interlocutory appeal. The\nmajority states that Wyatt’s claim has “become ever more nuanced” and that\n\n\n       2\n        Contrary to the majority’s statement in footnote 4 regarding “undisputed” facts, while\nS.W. admitted that she had confided in some friends regarding her sexual orientation, it is\nundisputed that she had never told her mother. With regard to “skipping down the hallway\nholding hands,” S.W. was asked during her deposition if she had “ever held hands in the\nhallway with a girl.” S.W. responded that she and two other girls had held hands and skipped\ndown the hallway, but clarified twice that it was nothing homosexual. The clothing\nrepresenting “society’s symbol for gay pride” was a belt with studs on it forming the shape of\na rainbow that S.W. had worn twice over a few-months’ time.\n\n                                             22\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831      Page: 23   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nher “claim is now that she inferred S.W.’s sexual orientation from the coaches’\ncomments.” In fact, Wyatt has consistently maintained that the coaches told\nher S.W. was dating a girl and characterized Nutt as S.W.’s “girlfriend.”\n                             Standard of Review\n      As correctly stated by the majority, this court reviews de novo a district\ncourt’s denial of a motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified\nimmunity.

Based on the applicable authority and the\ncoaches’ own admissions that they recognized the private nature of the\ninformation, the district court is absolutely correct that sexual orientation\nwould fall within the categories of highly personal information protected by\nthe right to privacy. The district court correctly held that, while the 5th\nCircuit has never explicitly held that a student has a right to privacy in\nkeeping his or her sexual orientation confidential, an analysis of precedent\ncompels the finding of such a right.\n      The question then becomes whether the coaches had a legitimate\ninterest which outweighed S.W.’s right to privacy. See Fadjo, 633 F.2d at\n1176. See also Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 656-57. The majority does not reach\nthis balancing test, finding that consideration of the objectively reasonable\nprong of qualified immunity is unnecessary. However, this prong is necessary\nto determine whether the coaches’ interests outweigh a student’s right to\nprivacy.\n      In support of a legitimate State interest, the coaches assert various\nreasons, including the possible sexual assault of a minor under Texas statute,\nNutt being a bad influence, a violation of rules for S.W. riding with Nutt, and\nteam discipline. Both the law and the facts undermine the legitimacy of the\nreasons given by the coaches. The Texas statute referred to by the majority\n\n                                        27\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831      Page: 28   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\nspecifically provides an affirmative defense because S.W. was over 14 and\nthere was only two-years age difference between S.W. and Nutt. Thus, there\nwas likely no valid legal concern regarding sexual assault.\n      With regard to Nutt being a bad influence, after indicating during her\ndeposition that she did not know of Nutt ever doing drugs, S.W. was asked,\n“[y]ou don’t know whether or not Hillary Nutt has ever taken a sip of\nalcohol?” S.W. responded that she knew Nutt had taken a drink but never in\nher presence. Also, S.W. was not asked if she knew where Nutt had taken\nthat “sip of alcohol” or the applicable drinking age of the location. Further,\nCoach Newell testified a resounding “No” when asked during her deposition,\n“So, just to clarify, did you consider Hillary Nutt, the woman that your\ngirlfriend invited to see your team members play, to be a threat to any of your\n– any of the players on your team ever?” Thus, there is no indication that\nNutt was “potentially dangerous” or an “underage user of illegal drugs and\nalcohol.”\n      The claim of S.W. violating a team rule for riding with Nutt is also\nunsupported by the facts. The team rule involves a permission slip that\npertains to, inter alia, in-school transportation by other softball players\nbetween 6th and 7th periods for practice. Nutt was not listed on the\npermission slip. However, the permission slip does not regulate riding with\nanyone outside of softball. To construe this permission slip to apply to drivers\nnot on the softball team is erroneous and would mean that neither Wyatt nor\nS.W.’s grandmother would have ever been able to transport S.W. because\nneither are listed on the permission slip. Yet, the coaches repeatedly said\nboth Wyatt and the grandmother could also transport S.W.\n      As to team dissension caused by rumors of S.W.’s involvement with\nNutt, we are, again, bound by S.W.’s facts - that she did not spread any\nrumors. Further, the coaches could not have known of any alleged dissension\n\n                                       28\n\f    Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831     Page: 29   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-41359\n\nas this alleged “rumor” did not come to light until March 3, the day the\ncoaches interrogated S.W. and revealed her sexual orientation to her mother.\nBut the coaches dismissed the rest of the softball team prior to the “meeting”\nwith S.W. Also, the allegation regarding dissension emanates from the\ncoaches’ version of the facts.\n      More importantly, the only thing the coaches knew prior to\ninterrogating S.W. was a rumor that she had allegedly told someone that she\nwas in a relationship with Nutt and that Nutt was Newell’s ex-girlfriend.\nThere was no evidence that S.W. was actually in a relationship with Nutt,\nthat it was a sexual relationship, that S.W. lied about anything or had ever\nridden with Nutt. The coaches did not find out that S.W. was actually\ninvolved in a relationship, albeit apparently never sexual, with Nutt until\nthey interrogated S.W. The record indicates that the coaches also did not find\nout that S.W. was riding with Nutt until after they met with S.W. Moreover,\nFletcher admitted as much in her deposition when she testified that the\ncoaches called Wyatt to the field because they wanted her to help stop the\nspreading of rumors about Newell and because S.W. was “dating” an “adult.”\n      The district court fully considered all of the above and found that there\nwas sufficient evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that\nthe coaches were not motivated by the need to protect S.W. but rather were\nretaliating against S.W. for allegedly spreading a rumor about Newell. The\nState has no interest in retaliating against students. As the district court\nfound, even if the coaches were motivated by a desire to protect S.W., Wyatt\nprovided expert testimony that the coaches’ actions “were not a reasonable\nresponse to any potential concerns they may have had regarding S.W. or her\nwelfare.” The district court further found that, based on the record, it could\nnot find that the States’ interest outweighed S.W.’s right to keep her sexual\norientation confidential, and that S.W.’s rights were clearly established at the\n\n                                       29\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 30     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\ntime. The district court also found that there were substantial unresolved\nquestions of fact surrounding the circumstances leading up to the\nconfrontation and the content of the coaches conversation with Wyatt that\nprevent it from making a qualified immunity determination. “Without a\nfactual determination by the appropriate trier of fact, this Court cannot\nresolve the legal question as to whether the Defendants’ actions are amenable\nto a qualified immunity defense on this claim,” concluded the district court. I\nagree.\n                                Unreasonable Seizure\n       With regard to the Fourth Amendment claim based on the\nconfrontation in the locker room, the majority says that the district court\noverlooked case law that establishes that the Fourth Amendment applies\ndifferently in the school context and particularly with regard to student\nathletes in locker rooms. Again, the majority cites Vernonia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117964\"><a href=\"/opinion/117964/vernonia-school-dist-47j-v-acton/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nand Milligan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770408\"><a href=\"/opinion/770408/diane-milligan-individually-and-on-behalf-of-her-minor-son-eric-milligan/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, for the diminished expectation of privacy of\nschool children, particularly student athletes. However, neither case\nsupports any such finding.\n       Vernonia was a case involving random urinalysis drug testing of\nstudent athletes. The majority cites this case for the proposition that athletes\nhave less privacy expectations and that locker rooms are “not notable for the\n[Fourth Amendment] privacy they afford.” Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 657.3 But\nthose propositions have absolutely nothing to do with the instant case. The\nSupreme Court specifically said:\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         The majority asserts that the seizure behind locked doors was proper because, by\nchoosing to be a student athlete, S.W. subjected herself to a higher degree of regulation, but\nthen cites Milligan for the proposition that actually being a student athlete has nothing to do\nwith it. I note that Milligan involved questioning of students by police officers regarding\npossible illegal acts, i.e., fights involving weapons.\n\n                                              30\n\f   Case: 11-41359    Document: 00512258831       Page: 31   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-41359\n\n      While we do not, of course, suggest that public schools as a\n      general matter have such a degree of control over children as to\n      give rise to a constitutional “duty to protect,” we have\n      acknowledged that for many purposes “school authorities ac[t] in\n      loco parentis,” with the power and indeed the duty to “inculcate\n      the habits and manners of civility,” Thus, while children\n      assuredly do not “shed their constitutional rights ... at the\n      schoolhouse gate,” the nature of those rights is what is\n      appropriate for children in school.\nVernonia, 515 U.S. at 655. (Internal citations, marks omitted). The Court\nfurther said:\n      Legitimate privacy expectations are even less with regard to\n      student athletes. School sports are not for the bashful. They\n      require “suiting up” before each practice or event, and showering\n      and changing afterwards. Public school locker rooms, the usual\n      sites for these activities, are not notable for the privacy they\n      afford. The locker rooms in Vernonia are typical: No individual\n      dressing rooms are provided; shower heads are lined up along a\n      wall, unseparated by any sort of partition or curtain; not even all\n      the toilet stalls have doors. As the United States Court of Appeals\n      for the Seventh Circuit has noted, there is “an element of\n      ‘communal undress' inherent in athletic participation.”\nVernonia, 515 U.S. at 657. (Internal citations omitted). This case has\nnothing to do with physical privacy in a locker room or even compliance with\nestablished rules such as random drug testing. That said, even conceding a\ndiminished expectation of privacy, the Court’s further analysis regarding\nrandom drug testing is telling:\n      Having considered the scope of the legitimate expectation of\n      privacy at issue here, we turn next to the character of the\n      intrusion that is complained of. We recognized in Skinner that\n      collecting the samples for urinalysis intrudes upon “an excretory\n      function traditionally shielded by great privacy.” We noted,\n      however, that the degree of intrusion depends upon the manner\n      in which production of the urine sample is monitored. . . . These\n      conditions are nearly identical to those typically encountered in\n      public restrooms, which men, women, and especially\n      schoolchildren use daily. Under such conditions, the privacy\n\n                                      31\n\f    Case: 11-41359       Document: 00512258831          Page: 32     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-41359\n\n       interests compromised by the process of obtaining the urine\n       sample are in our view negligible.\n\n       The other privacy-invasive aspect of urinalysis is, of course, the\n       information it discloses concerning the state of the subject's body,\n       and the materials he has ingested. In this regard it is significant\n       that the tests at issue here look only for drugs, and not for\n       whether the student is, for example, epileptic, pregnant, or\n       diabetic. Moreover, the drugs for which the samples are screened\n       are standard, and do not vary according to the identity of the\n       student. And finally, the results of the tests are disclosed only to\n       a limited class of school personnel who have a need to know; and\n       they are not turned over to law enforcement authorities or used\n       for any internal disciplinary function.\nVernonia, 515 U.S. at 658. (Internal citations omitted).4\n       Here, there was no policy regarding lesbian relationships. In fact, at\nleast one of the coaches and other members of the softball team were gay.\nNewell testified in her deposition that she had not made efforts to find out\nabout other players’ relationships and had never informed any other parents\nof who their children were dating. The results of the interrogation were not\ndisclosed only to a limited class of school personnel who had a need to know,\nbut were instead turned over to S.W.’s mother.\n       The Fourth Amendment claim involves the coaches’ locking S.W. in the\nlocker room and confronting her - not the invasion of privacy under the\nFourteenth Amendment which involved the disclosure of her sexual\norientation to her mother. Therefore, the majority incorrectly finds that the\ndistrict court overlooked case law. Further, the majority finds that verbal\nabuse does not give rise to a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nand, “thus, there is simply no clearly established constitutional right.” Again,\n\n\n\n       4\n         The Court further addressed the provision of the drug testing policy that required\nstudents to identify prescription medications in advance if they wanted to avoid sanctions for\na false positive drug test.\n\n                                             32\n\f    Case: 11-41359         Document: 00512258831           Page: 33     Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                         No. 11-41359\n\nthe majority errs. The case cited by the majority, Calhoun v. Hargrove, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"29318\"><a href=\"/opinion/29318/calhoun-v-hargrove/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734 (5th Cir. 2002), for the proposition that verbal abuse does not\ngive rise to a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 actually says:\n        A claim for relief under § 1983 must allege the deprivation of a\n       right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States\n       by a defendant acting under color of state law. Wong v. Stripling,\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527012\"><a href=\"/opinion/527012/sidney-wong-v-john-stripling-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (5th Cir.1989). Furthermore, under 42 U.S.C. §\n       1997e(e), “[n]o federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner\n       confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental\n       or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior\n       showing of physical injury.”\n\nCalhoun, 312 F.3d at 734.\n       This is not a suit by a prisoner and there is no applicable federal\nstatute requiring physical injury. Notwithstanding the inapplicability of\nCalhoun5, verbal abuse is only one of the actions cited by Wyatt. The others\nincluded locking S.W. in the locker room, interrogating her, intimidating\ngestures, etc. Under the same authority as the Fourteenth Amendment\nanalysis above, there clearly exists a Fourth Amendment right against\nunreasonable seizure/false imprisonment. The majority ignores the balancing\ntest which is required to determine whether the State’s interest outweighs\n\n\n       5\n         Notably, while dismissing as uncontrolling the abundant authority from other circuits\nthat supports Wyatt’s position, the majority attempts to also rely on Doe v. Gooden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768986\"><a href=\"/opinion/768986/no-99-1698/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 955 (8th Cir. 2000), and Walker-Serrano by Walker v. Leonard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2293460\"><a href=\"/opinion/2293460/walker-serrano-by-walker-v-leonard/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 347\n(M.D. Pa. 2001), for its proposition that verbal abuse does not give rise to a constitutional\nviolation. In Gooden, the Eighth Circuit found that the teacher’s statements did not amount\nto a constitutional violation, but did not foreclose the possibility of such, saying: “Verbal abuse\nis normally not a constitutional violation.” 214 F.3d at 955. In Walker, the Pennsylvania\ndistrict court cited Gooden for the proposition that “verbal abuse, whether coming from a\nstudent or a teacher, is not a constitutional violation.” Walker, 168 F.Supp.2d at 348.\nHowever, Gooden does not say that. Gooden, 214 F.3d at 955. Further, Walker was a First\nAmendment case involving an elementary student’s petition against a school field trip to a\ncircus. The plaintiff also claimed emotional distress for teasing from other students after she\nand her mother boycotted the field trip and protested outside the circus. Importantly, the\ndistrict court repeatedly indicated that elementary students do not enjoy the same clearly\nestablished rights as high school students.\n\n                                               33\n\f   Case: 11-41359     Document: 00512258831     Page: 34   Date Filed: 05/31/2013\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-41359\n\nS.W.’s right against unreasonable seizure. Instead, the majority presumably\nfinds that such a right does not clearly exist for high school students and,\nthus, there is no need to determine objective reasonableness. I disagree. As\nstated previously, school children do not shed their constitutional rights at\nthe schoolhouse gate. The majority fails to cite any authority to indicate that\nthe Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure does not\nextend to high school students. A consideration of the objectively reasonable\nprong is necessary.\n      For the same reasons stated in the Fourteenth Amendment right to\nprivacy discussion, I would conclude that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact and that summary judgment was correctly denied.\n                                 Conclusion\n      Accordingly, I would find that Wyatt has alleged clearly established\nconstitutional rights and that there are genuine issues of material fact\nsufficient to warrant denial of summary judgment on the basis of qualified\nimmunity. Because I would affirm the district court, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                       34\n\f</pre>",
