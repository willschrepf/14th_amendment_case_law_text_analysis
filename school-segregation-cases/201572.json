United States v. State of Texas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D.\nTex., Nov. 24, 1970); United States v. State of Texas, 330 F. Supp. 325 (E.D. Tex.,\nMay 11, 1971), affirmed in part, modified in part, 447 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1971)\n(affirming order of Nov. 24, 1970, modifying order of April 20, 1971). The district\ncourt found that the named school districts were responsible for maintaining a\ndual school system and TEA aided this effort by funding the segregated school\ndistricts. To redress this discrimination, the district court entered an order on\nNovember 24, 1970, modified August 9, 1973, that has governed various aspects\nof public education in the state of Texas since then.1 The Modified Order\nprovides, among other things, that:\n       “[TEA] shall not permit, make arrangement for or give support of\n       any kind to student transfers, between school districts, when the\n       cumulative effect, in either the sending or receiving school or school\n       district, will be to reduce or impede desegregation, or to reinforce,\n       renew, or encourage the continuation of acts and practices resulting\n       in discriminatory treatment of students on the grounds of race,\n       color, or national origin.”\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Hereinafter, the federal court order entered in this case, including its modifications,\nwill be referred to as the “Modified Order.”\n\n                                               2\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\n       This case, like much of the recent litigation under the Modified Order,2\ninvolves small rural independent school districts competing over students to\nkeep their local schools financially viable.                 Samnorwood and Harrold\nIndependent School Districts (together the “School Districts”) are located in the\nTexas panhandle and each have a single campus that serves the district’s entire\nstudy body, grades K-12. Samnorwood is in Collingsworth County, southeast of\nAmarillo, and Harrold is in Wilbarger County, east of the city of Vernon. Black\nstudents from Samnorwood attended a segregated school in an adjoining district\nuntil July 8, 1963, and Black students from Harrold attended a segregated\nschool in an adjoining district until October, 4, 1965.3 After those dates, all\nchildren attended school in each district without regard to race, color, or national\norigin. Both School Districts desegregated by a vote of their respective school\nboards well before the commencement of United States v. Texas, and neither was\never a party to a desegregation order or have ever been shown to have acted with\nsegregative intent in accepting transfer students (or otherwise). During the\n2002-2003 school year, Harrold’s enrollment was 112 students, of whom 1% were\nBlack, 31% were Hispanic, and 63% were non-Hispanic white. Samnorwood’s\nenrollment for the same school year was 101 students, of whom 3% were Black,\n20% were Hispanic, and 75% were non-Hispanic white.\n       Both School Districts depend heavily on transfer students for their\neconomic viability. Each accepts transfer students regardless of the race or\nethnicity of the student, and neither charges tuition to any transfer student.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         See United States v. Texas (Hearne), 457 F.3d 472 (5th Cir. 2006) (Hearne ISD\nbrought suit against Mumford ISD claiming that by accepting transfers from its school,\nMumford ISD was impermissibly impeding desegregation ); United States v. Texas (Goodrich),\n158 F.3d 299 (5th Cir. 1998) (involving a neighborhood’s attempt to be annexed to a different\nschool district).\n       3\n           Hispanic residents in these two School Districts never attended segregated schools.\n\n                                               3\n\f                                         No. 06-41347\n\nDuring the 2002-2003 school year, seventy-four percent of Samnorwood’s\nstudents and “virtually all” of Harrold’s students were transfers.\n       Under Texas law, any child eligible for enrollment may transfer from his\nhome district to any other district if the receiving district and a custodial parent\n(or guardian) jointly approve and timely agree in writing. Tex. Educ. Code §\n25.036. TEA annually distributes funds to Texas school districts based on the\naverage daily attendance of enrolled students, whether the students reside in\nthe district or have transferred from another district. Tex. Educ. Code §§\n7.055(b)(35), 42.005, 42.101. Other than allocating funding based on student\nenrollment, Texas law does not otherwise empower TEA to oversee student\ntransfers. Nevertheless, the Modified Order requires TEA to monitor all student\ntransfers and to refuse to fund transfers in certain circumstances.4\n       In order to comply with its obligations under the Modified Order, TEA\nrequires each school district to inform TEA whenever it receives a transfer\nstudent. Prior to 2002, schools recorded transfer data on paper and submitted\nit to TEA, but in the spring of 2002, TEA implemented a new automated Student\nTransfer System (“STS”) to track transfers. Under the new system, schools are\nstill required to report transfers, but now they submit that information\nelectronically using STS.5 Once a student transfer is submitted using STS, TEA\n\n\n       4\n         The Modified Order provides that: “[TEA] shall not approve transfers where the effect\nof such transfers will change the majority or minority percentage of the school population,\nbased on average daily attendance in such districts by more than one percent (1%), in either\nthe home or the receiving district or the home or receiving school.” But, as the district court\nnoted in its opinion below, “[f]or very small school districts (fewer than 300 students), including\nHarrold and Samnorwood, the tolerable percentage change in the diversity of the home and\nreceiving districts due to transfers is now three percent (3%).” Mem. Op., July 24, 2006, at 2.\nIn calculating the one or three percent threshold, all minority students are added together and\nthat percentage (the “minority percentage”) is compared to the percentage of non-Hispanic\nwhite students.\n       5\n        TEA switched to the automated system in response to complaints from school\nsuperintendents regarding the length of time it took TEA to determine whether a transfer\nstudent was eligible for funding under the old paper system.\n\n                                                4\n\f                                       No. 06-41347\n\ncalculates whether the transfer has a “segregative effect.”6 Any transfer that\nexceeds the applicable one- or three-percent rule is deemed ineligible. STS\noperates in “real time,” meaning that it maintains a current calculation of every\nschool district’s racial and ethnic demographics, so when a transfer student is\nentered into the system it calculates what effect that transfer has on the current\nminority percentage at the sending and receiving schools.7 STS does not make\na permanent record of whether transfers are deemed eligible when they are\nentered or of a school’s minority percentage on any particular day so there is no\nway for TEA to use STS to verify whether a transfer was deemed eligible when\nit was entered.8\n       In order to monitor the cumulative enrollment, TEA also requires school\ndistricts to report student data to its Public Education Information Management\nSystem (“PEIMS”) after each school year. See Tex. Educ. Code § 42.006. The\nPEIMS data allows TEA to compute the average daily attendance of each school\ndistrict. At the end of the year, TEA reconciles the data from PEIMS with the\ndata from STS to determine whether student transfers have caused a school’s\nminority percentage to change by more than one or three percent in violation of\nsection A(3)(b) of the Modified Order. If a school has accepted an ineligible\ntransfer in a particular year, the school loses funding for the next year for each\n\n\n       6\n         A transfer is determined to have segregative effect if it changes the sending or\nreceiving school’s minority percentage by more than one percent, three percent for small\nschools, and the transfer moves either school closer to being racially identifiable than it was\nbefore.\n       7\n          A consequence of this real time calculation is that a student could be listed as an\neligible transfer on the date he is entered into the system, but could later be listed as an\nineligible transfer depending on later demographic shifts in the sending or receiving schools.\nTEA has attempted to remedy this issue by not penalizing a school for a transfer if it can prove\nthat the transfer student was eligible for funding on the date he was entered into STS.\n       8\n        The only way a school district could prove whether a student was eligible on the date\nhe was entered into STS was to print the computer screen after entering the student into the\nsystem.\n\n                                               5\n\f                                       No. 06-41347\n\nday that the ineligible student attended the school. If a school district fails to\nenter a transfer into STS, TEA treats that student as an ineligible transfer and\nthe school loses funding for that student as well.\n       If a school district remains in violation after being notified by TEA that it\nhas accepted an ineligible transfer, the Modified Order instructs TEA to escalate\nsanctions against the district. Section A(6) requires TEA to refuse to fund\ntransfers that violate the order. Section A(7) requires TEA to suspend a school\ndistrict’s accreditation if it fails to correct the violation after a ten-day warning.\n       In this case, STS reported that Samnorwood exceeded the three-percent\nlimitation by accepting one ineligible transfer student, “Vincent R.,” and TEA\nalso determined that Samnorwood had failed to enter three transfers into STS.\nTEA informed Samnorwood by letter on March 24, 2004, that $10,746 in funds\nwould be withheld from its funding for the following year due to the three\nunreported students and Vincent R.’s transfer. In another letter dated March\n24, 2004, TEA informed Harrold that it would have $100,069 withheld from its\nfunding for the following year because it had failed to enter seventeen transfers\ninto STS. The School Districts both requested an informal review of TEA’s\nfunding decision as provided by TEA policy. During that review, both School\nDistricts admitted that they had not entered the transfers into STS, but they\nwere able to show that some of the transfers were nevertheless eligible for\nfunding because they were approved exemptions as defined by the Modified\nOrder.9 TEA waived the nonreporting fine for theses students.                     TEA also\nrestored funding for Vincent R. because Samnorwood was able to prove that, on\nthe day his transfer was entered, STS declared him an eligible transfer. TEA,\nhowever, left the fines intact for the three unreported transfers from\n\n\n\n       9\n         The Modified Order provides exceptions to the transfer rules for students whose older\nsiblings attend the school to which they wish to transfer and for students whose parents are\nteachers at the school to which they wish to transfer.\n\n                                              6\n\f                                      No. 06-41347\n\nSamnorwood and the twelve unreported and nonexempt transfers from Harrold,\nso after the informal review, Samnorwood was penalized $6,111, and Harrold\nwas penalized $68,525.10           In late 2004 the School Districts intervened into\nthis case (United States v. Texas) in order to challenge the sanctions imposed by\nTEA and the validity of the Modified Order on its face and as applied to them.\n       In its order, the district court held that it did not exceed its remedial\npower by entering the Modified Order because it did not seek to reverse\nsegregative effects on public schools based on private residential decisions, and\nthat its mandate was not more broad than necessary to cure a constitutional\ninjury. It also noted that the Modified Order properly applied statewide because\nit was meant to eliminate the vestige of discrimination that remained from the\nfact that Texas operated a “state-wide dual school system prior to desegregation\nin the 1960s.” Mem. Op., July 24, 2006.\n       On the issue of the sanctions, the district court held that since Texas\nprovides a “sparsity adjustment” to small schools that guarantees school districts\nwith Samnorwood and Harrold’s enrollment levels to be funded as if they had\n130 student, the School Districts did not receive any additional funds due to\nthese transfers.11 The district court then reasoned that sanctions by TEA were\nnot mandated by the Modified Order for transfers that decreased diversity by\nmore than three percent in schools that received the sparsity adjustment\nbecause section A(6) of the Modified Order only instructs TEA to refuse to\ntransfer funds associated with the ineligible transfer student, and since the\nSchool Districts were already being funded at a level of 130 students because of\nthe sparsity adjustment, they did not actually receive any extra funds due to the\n\n       10\n          TEA maintained that these financial sanctions were appropriate because the failure\nto enter transfers into STS effectively prevents TEA from determining which transfers comply\nwith the Modified Order.\n       11\n        The “sparsity adjustment” states that any school operating with less than 130 but\nmore than ninety students will be funded as if it had 130 students. Tex. Educ. Code § 42.105.\n\n                                             7\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\ntransfer of a new student.            The district court also admonished TEA for\nsanctioning school districts for failing to report transfers when STS did not\nmaintain a record of whether transfers were approved or not, thereby\nimpermissibly placing the burden on schools to keep a record of their STS\ntransactions themselves.\n        The district court ultimately held that the School Districts were not to be\nsanctioned, even for the students that they failed to enter into STS. However,\nit made it clear that TEA was free to sanction school districts who failed to enter\nstudent transfers into STS in the future. Order Den. Mot. to Am. J., Aug. 10,\n2006, at 1-2 (“TEA’s policy of sanctioning districts for their failure to enter\nstudents into the STS system is reasonable, and nothing in the Court’s\nMemorandum Opinion casts doubt on TEA’s continuing ability to impose such\nsanctions . . . .”).\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\nI.     Justicibility\n       TEA, the League of United Latin American Citizens (“LULAC”), and G.I.\nForum12 argue that this court lacks jurisdiction under Article III to hear this\nappeal. Therefore, we will first consider whether or not the appellant has “made\nout a ‘case or controversy’ between himself and the [appellees] within the\nmeaning of Art. III.” Warth v. Seldin, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205 (1975); see U.S. Const.\nart. III, § 2. In order for there to be a justiciable case or controversy under\n\n\n\n       12\n         LULAC and G.I. Forum had previously intervened in this civil action. United States\nv. Texas (LULAC), 680 F.2d 356, 372-73 (5th Cir. 1982). Because of this prior intervention\nthey were still parties to the proceeding when the School Districts petitioned to intervene.\nThey did not participate in the bench trial, but they did participate pretrial (e.g. they filed a\nmotion challenging the intervention of parties other than the School Districts and a response\nsupporting TEA’s motion to dismiss). They also filed a joint brief in this court challenging the\nSchool Districts’ standing on appeal. Since the parties jointly filed their brief, for simplicity\nwe will refer to arguments in the brief as being from LULAC only.\n\n                                               8\n\f                                       No. 06-41347\n\nArticle III, a litigant must show that he has standing.                   See Valley Forge\nChristian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 102 S.Ct.\n752, 758 (1982). Such a case or controversy must exist throughout the litigation;\nin other words, the case cannot be moot. Honig v. Doe, 108 S.Ct. 592, 601 (1988).\nThis court is “obligated to address issues of jurisdiction, including mootness,\nprior to addressing the merits of an appeal.” Goldin v. Bartholow, 166 F.3d 710,\n714 (5th Cir. 1999).\n       LULAC argues this case is moot because the School Districts received the\nrelief they requested in the district court, namely, the sanctions were vacated.13\nLULAC’s contention is incorrect, however, because in their complaint the School\nDistricts sought, in addition to having the fines vacated, a declaratory judgment\nholding that the student transfer provisions of the Modified Order exceeded the\ndistrict court’s desegregation jurisdiction on its face and as applied by TEA, a\ndecree vacating the student transfer provisions of the Modified Order, and a\npermanent injunction restraining TEA from regulating student transfers under\nthe Modified Order. The district court did not grant the School Districts any of\nthese forms of relief, so the School Districts’ claims for equitable relief are not\nmoot. However, we must still decide whether the School Districts have standing\nto seek these alternative forms of relief.\n       In order for a plaintiff to have sufficient standing under Article III, that\nplaintiff must show that: he has suffered or will suffer an injury, his injury is\n\n       13\n         LULAC also argues that if we were to decide this case it would be an advisory opinion\nbecause there are not sufficiently adverse parties. We do not agree with this contention. TEA\nhas a sufficiently adverse interest to the School Districts in this case because it continues to\nmaintain that the School Districts are not entitled to be exempted from the Modified Order,\nthe very thing the School District seeks. LULAC itself also had the opportunity to challenge\nthe School Districts’ request for relief in its brief and at oral argument. Finally, the United\nStates participated in all aspects of this case up until the appellate phase and it too was\nchallenging the School Districts’ claims that they should no longer have to abide by the\nModified Order. We therefore believe that there were parties with sufficiently adverse\ninterests involved in this case to ensure a proper case and controversy. See Goldin v.\nBartholow, 166 F.3d 710, 717-20 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                               9\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\ntraceable to the defendant’s conduct, and a favorable federal court decision will\nlikely redress the injury.14 Bennett v. Spear, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1163 (1997). Here\nthe School Districts’ injury is being subjected to an injunctive remedy, the\nModified Order, which potentially imposes monetary fines, places them at risk\nof losing their accreditation, and limits their ability to accept student transfers\nthat they would otherwise be permitted to accept under Texas law.15 What\nmakes this case unique is that the School Districts were not a party to the\noriginal suit. If the School Districts had been a party directly bound by the\nModified Order there would be no question that they had standing to challenge\nthe Modified Order. Here the School Districts were not a party to the Modified\nOrder, but their actions are collaterally constrained by the Modified Order\nbecause it prohibits TEA from funding student transfers to their school that\nexceed the one- or three-percent threshold, and without funding they cannot\nafford to accept such transfers.\n       While we have found no cases directly on point, this situation is analogous\nto cases where this circuit has held that a third party had standing to appeal an\ninjunction which adversely affects its interest, even when it was not a party to\n\n\n       14\n          Neither TEA nor LULAC argue that the School Districts’ alleged injury is not\nredressable or traceable. TEA has admitted that its only authority to impose sanctions on\nschool districts because of student transfers flows from its obligation to implement the Modified\nOrder, so the potential sanctions are traceable to the Modified Order. Additionally, if this court\nwere to provide the School Districts with their requested relief, a declaration that the Modified\nOrder should not be applied to them, their alleged injury would be redressed. Therefore, the\nSchool Districts satisfy these two prongs of Article III standing.\n       15\n          While the district court’s order held that TEA can no longer deny the School Districts\nfunding for unapproved transfers as long they continue to fall within the sparsity adjustment\n(applicable to districts with 90 to less than 130 students, see note 11 supra), there is no\nguarantee that their enrollment will not exceed the sparsity adjustment in the future. In fact,\nHarrold enrolled 129 students for the 2003-2004 school year and Samnorwood enrolled 134\nstudents during the 2004-2005 school year. Additionally, the Modified Order instructs TEA\nto revoke the accreditation of school districts that continue to enroll a transfer student that\nexceeds the three-percent rule after ten days of being informed that the transfer student is\nineligible. This mandate of the Modified Order would apply whether or not the school falls\nwithin the sparsity adjustment.\n\n                                               10\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\nthe litigation. See United States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev., 445 F.3d\n771, 780-81 (5th Cir. 2006) (judgment creditors had standing to challenge a\nrestraining order that affected their ability to execute on assets, even though\nthey were not a party to the case where the restraining order was entered),\napproved in this respect en banc, 493 F.3d 469, 472 (5th Cir. 2007) (en banc);\nCastillo v. Cameron County, Tex., 238 F.3d 339, 349 n.16 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding\nthat the state of Texas had Article III standing to appeal an injunction even\nthough it was a nonparty because the injunction adversely affected its interests);\nCharga v. San Antonio Light Div. of Hearst Corp., 701 F.2d 354, 358-60 (5th Cir.\n1983) (holding that newspapers and reporters had standing to appeal a court\norder closing a pretrial bail reduction hearing at the request of a criminal\ndefendant).16\n       In each of these cases, this court held that the challenging party had\nstanding because the equitable relief granted by the district courts placed a\nburden on the challenging party which gave them a personal stake in the\nlitigation. The case before us is no different.17 The Modified Order, and TEA’s\n\n       16\n          Other circuits have held that there was standing in similar circumstances. See\nUnited States v. Kirschenbaum, 156 F.3d 784, 794 (7th Cir. 1998) (“[N]on-parties who are\nbound by a court’s equitable decrees have a right to move to have the order dissolved, . . . and\nother circuits have held that where a non-party is purportedly bound by an injunction, the\nnon-party may bring an appeal rather than face the possibility of a contempt proceeding.”); In\nre Estate of Ferdinand Marcos Human Rights Litig., 94 F.3d 539, 544 (9th Cir. 1996) (finding\nstanding for nonparty where injunction confronted nonparty “with the choice of either\nconforming its conduct to the dictates of the injunction or ignoring the injunction and risking\ncontempt proceedings”); In re Piper Funds, Inc., Institutional Gov’t Income Portfolio Litig., 71\nF.3d 298, 301 (8th Cir. 1995) (“A nonparty normally has standing to appeal when it is\nadversely affected by an injunction.”).\n       17\n          That the School Districts intervened in this longstanding case to challenge the\nModified Order and its application rather than attempting to enter litigation at the appellate\nphase, as in the cited cases, is of no significance to the question of standing. A party must have\nstanding at all points of the litigation. Honig v. Doe, 108 S.Ct. 592, 601 (1988). So if the\nadverse affects of the equitable relief were sufficient to provide standing to the parties to\nappeal in the cited cases, similar adverse affects from the Modified Order are sufficient to give\nthe School Districts standing when they intervened in the district court and now to appeal the\ndecision of that court.\n\n                                               11\n\f                                       No. 06-41347\n\nregulations to enforce it, impose severe penalties if the School Districts fail to\nadhere to TEA’s reporting requirement or accept a transfer that trips the one-\nor three-percent rule.18 The School Districts also expend time and resources\ncomplying with the Modified Order every time they seek to accept a transfer\nstudent. Finally, the Modified Order effectively prohibits the School Districts\nfrom doing something that they contend they are permitted to do under Texas\nlaw and the United States Constitution: accept as many transfer students, of\nany race or ethnicity, as they wish if they do so in a nondiscriminatory manner.\nIn two school districts that rely on transfer students for their financial viability,\nthis is not a consequence to be ignored. For these reasons, the Modified Order\npresents a real adverse impact on theses schools, and therefore, they have\nstanding to challenge its application to them.19\n       At its core standing is about ensuring that a party with a sufficiently\nstrong interest is the one who brings a cause of action. See Baker v. Carr, 82\nS.Ct. 691, 703 (1962) (The question of standing is whether the party seeking\nrelief has “alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to\nassure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon\nwhich the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional\nquestions?”); see also Flast v. Cohen, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952 (1968) (“[W]hen\nstanding is placed in issue in a case, the question is whether the person whose\nstanding is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of a\n\n\n\n       18\n          Although the monetary fines have been lifted in this case, TEA is free to impose the\nfines for not reporting in the future and if either school falls outside the sparsity adjustment\nthey are again subject to fines for violating the three-percent rule.\n       19\n          If we were to hold that the School Districts did not have standing in this case, their\nonly available recourse would be to violate the Modified Order and wait to be sanctioned. We\nhave not required this of parties under a district court’s equitable power in the past. See\nCastillo v. Cameron County, Tex., 238 F.3d 339, 350 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding that the fact that\na party could be found in contempt for violating the court order in the future was a sufficient\ninjury to provide standing for a pre-enforcement challenge to the decree).\n\n                                              12\n\f                                   No. 06-41347\n\nparticular issue and not whether the issue itself is justiciable.”) Here the school\ndistricts are challenging whether the Modified Order can properly be applied to\nthem. We can think of no better party to raise such a claim than the School\nDistricts themselves.\nII.   Merits\n      The School Districts argue that the Modified Order’s student transfer\nprovisions are unlawful because they exceed the equitable power of the district\ncourt to fashion a desegregation remedy.         Their argument flows from the\nprinciple that in “any equity case, the nature of the violation determines the\nscope of the remedy.” Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 91 S.Ct.\n1267, 1276 (1971). The import of this principle is that in school desegregation\ncases, “federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at\neliminating a condition that does not violate the Constitution or does not flow\nfrom such a violation . . . .” Milliken v. Bradley (Milliken II), 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2758\n(1977). In applying this standard, the factual findings of the district court are\nreviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.            United States v. Texas\n(Goodrich), 158 F.3d 299, 306 n.8 (5th Cir. 1998). Whether a constitutional right\nhas been violated is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. Gates v.\nCook, 376 F.3d 323, 333 (5th Cir. 2004). If a constitutional violation is found, we\nemploy an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the equitable remedy itself.\nSwann, 91 S.Ct. at 1280.\n      Here the School Districts contend that the Modified Order exceeds the\ndistrict court’s equitable power because it applies to them even though they have\nnever been under a desegregation order (and were never a party to this case\nuntil their 2004 intervention) and it was not shown that any of the transfers\ninvolved in this case were the approved due to an intent to discriminate. In\nsupport of their position, the School Districts cite a trio of cases involving the\nModified Order. In the first, this court held that a remedial order mandating\n\n                                         13\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\nthat school districts provide bilingual language education to Mexican-American\nstudents could not be imposed on school districts without first determining\nwhether they actually participated in segregation. United States v. Texas\n(LULAC), 680 F.2d 356, 372 (5th Cir. 1982) (“If remedial orders are to be\nimposed in Texas school districts on grounds of past segregation of students\nwithin the given district, that district must first be heard.”) In the second, the\ndistrict court’s use of the Modified Order to invalidate a detachment and\nannexation of territory was reversed because there was no “showing that the\nschool authorities ‘[had] in some manner caused unconstitutional segregation\n. . . .’” Goodrich, 158 F.3d at 309 (citing Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler,\n96 S.Ct. 2697, 2704 (1976)). In the third, this court overturned an injunction\nentered pursuant to the Modified Order, which barred TEA from disbursing\nstate funding for any white transfer students at Mumford ISD and Mumford ISD\nfrom receiving any more white transfer students.                    United States v. Texas\n(Hearne), 457 F.3d 472, 484 (5th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he question is not whether\nMumford complied with TEA directives; Mumford must have acted with\ndiscriminatory intent in accepting the transfers.”).\n       Each of those opinions begin with the Supreme Court’s instruction in\nSwann: “the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.” 91\nS.Ct. at 1276. In each of the above cited decisions of this court, we struck down\nthe remedy because there had been no showing of a constitutional violation. We\nare presented with a similar situation. In this case, these two School Districts\nwere denied funding because they failed to enter students in the STS system\nthat TEA uses to monitor compliance with the order. TEA acknowledges (and\nneither LULAC nor the district court here ever disputed) that there is no basis\nunder Texas state law for it to impose such sanctions on the school districts.20\n\n       20\n         This opinion does not affect Texas’s ability to regulate or collect information regarding\nstudent transfers, if it should so choose. The issue presented in this case is whether the\n\n                                               14\n\f                                      No. 06-41347\n\nThe sole basis of TEA’s power to impose these sanctions stems from its duty to\ncomply with the Modified Order. Thus the modified order and TEA’s actions\npursuant to it constitute a remedy that must flow from a constitutional violation.\nMilliken II, 97 S.Ct. 2758. However, as in Goodrich and Hearne, neither Harrold\nnor Samnorwood have ever been found to have discriminated against students\nof the basis of their race or ethnicity. In fact, TEA does not (and did not)\ninvestigate or conduct a hearing to determine whether a particular transfer was\naccepted or denied due to a segregative intent on the part of a sending or\nreceiving school district before imposing sanctions on a school district. The\nfailure to report or the triggering of the one- or three-percent threshold is all\nthat is required. This use of an arbitrary percentage as a proxy for intentional\ndiscrimination has been criticized previously by this court,21 and such a\nquantitative review cannot substitute for actual evidence of intentional\ndiscrimination on the part of these two School Districts. There has been no such\nevidence presented in this case. Therefore, allowing these two School Districts\nto remain under the Modified Order would improperly impose a desegregation\nremedy where there has been no showing or finding of a constitutional violation.\n       In the district court’s memorandum opinion, it held that it was proper for\nTEA to enforce the student transfer provisions of the Modified Order against the\nSchool Districts because they were part of a state-wide dual school system. This\ninference, however, has been specifically rejected by this circuit. See Hearne,\n457 F.3d at 483 (“Because Mumford was not a party defendant to the original\nlitigation that resulted in Order 5281, it cannot be condemned for violating the\n\n\nModified Order can obligate TEA to enforce its student transfer provisions against these two\nSchool Districts.\n       21\n          The prophylactic percentage rule of the Modified Order is potentially an\n“unenforceable vestige of conditions long since substantially remedied . . . [that] lives on,\nhowever, as a cause of voluminous continuous recordkeeping and monitoring by TEA and all\nTexas school districts.” Hearne, 457 F.3d at 478 n.8.\n\n                                             15\n\f                                  No. 06-41347\n\nOrder without a finding that it intentionally engaged in segregative conduct.”).\nMoreover, the only evidence shows that neither of these two Districts has been\nany part of a dual or segregated school system ever since a time more than three\nyears prior to the initial filing this suit in March 1970, and there has been no\njudicial determination to the contrary.\n      The district court also held that because TEA was a defendant in the\ninitial suit and had been found to be promoting a dual-school systems in the\nstate of Texas, the Modified Order can permissibly mandate TEA to enforce\nprovisions of the Modified Order against any schools it funds. The district court\nbelieved that this was consistent with Swann’s mandate that a remedy may only\nextend as far as the constitutional violation. We cannot agree.\n      While it is undisputed that TEA funded some segregated schools at the\ntime the Modified Order was entered, that does not empower the district court\nto force TEA to impose a remedy on these two School Districts (neither of which\nhad been segregated for years prior to filing of the suit in which that order was\nentered). See Lee v. Lee County Bd. of Educ., 639 F.2d 1243, 1256 (5th Cir. 1981)\n(“a federal court cannot impose liability on individual defendant school districts\non the basis of a general inverse respondeat superior theory holding them\npresumptively responsible for actions of the state or another governmental\nentity” and “one cannot presume that racial imbalances between separate school\ndistricts result from unconstitutional discriminatory acts on the part of those\nschool districts”) (citing and discussing Milliken v. Bradley, 94 S.Ct. 3112\n(1974)). Had the School Districts been a party to the original 1970 litigation, the\ndistrict court would not have been able to impose a remedy policing their student\ntransfers because they were not (and had not been for more than three years\nbefore the suit was filed) segregating students. Additionally, since the dates on\nwhich both of the School Districts desegregated, there has not been a\ndetermination, or indeed any evidence, that either has attempted to resegregate\n\n\n                                        16\n\f                                   No. 06-41347\n\nor to accept student transfers with discriminatory intent.          Absent such a\nshowing, the district court cannot invoke TEA’s long past wrongdoing as a\njustification to require TEA to monitor nondiscriminatory student transfers\ninvolving Samnorwood and Harrold ISDs.\n      Of course, our opinion today does not give the School Districts a license to\ndiscriminate. If evidence arises that either of these school districts is acting with\ndiscriminatory intent when accepting or rejecting transfer students, then they\nwould be subject to suit and a remedy would then be in order to correct the\nconstitutional violation. Our decision today only holds that the prophylactic\nprovisions created by the Modified Order to remedy the segregative conduct on\nthe part of TEA and all-black schools in East Texas should not be imposed on\nthese two panhandle school districts that had long previously already\ndesegregated and have never since been found to have acted with segregative\nintent.\n                                 CONCLUSION\n      We render judgment that Samnorwood ISD and Harrold ISD shall no\nlonger be subject to the Modified Order’s student transfer provisions or TEA’s\nregulations promulgated to enforce those provisions. To the extent that the\ndistrict court declined to so rule its judgment is reversed.\n                         REVERSEDand RENDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f",

The district\ncourt found that the named school districts were responsible for maintaining a\ndual school system and TEA aided this effort by funding the segregated school\ndistricts. To redress this discrimination, the district court entered an order on\nNovember 24, 1970, modified August 9, 1973, that has governed various aspects\nof public education in the state of Texas since then.1 The Modified Order\nprovides, among other things, that:\n       “[TEA] shall not permit, make arrangement for or give support of\n       any kind to student transfers, between school districts, when the\n       cumulative effect, in either the sending or receiving school or school\n       district, will be to reduce or impede desegregation, or to reinforce,\n       renew, or encourage the continuation of acts and practices resulting\n       in discriminatory treatment of students on the grounds of race,\n       color, or national origin.”\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Hereinafter, the federal court order entered in this case, including its modifications,\nwill be referred to as the “Modified Order.”\n\n                                               2\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\n       This case, like much of the recent litigation under the Modified Order,2\ninvolves small rural independent school districts competing over students to\nkeep their local schools financially viable.                 Samnorwood and Harrold\nIndependent School Districts (together the “School Districts”) are located in the\nTexas panhandle and each have a single campus that serves the district’s entire\nstudy body, grades K-12. Samnorwood is in Collingsworth County, southeast of\nAmarillo, and Harrold is in Wilbarger County, east of the city of Vernon. Black\nstudents from Samnorwood attended a segregated school in an adjoining district\nuntil July 8, 1963, and Black students from Harrold attended a segregated\nschool in an adjoining district until October, 4, 1965.3 After those dates, all\nchildren attended school in each district without regard to race, color, or national\norigin. Both School Districts desegregated by a vote of their respective school\nboards well before the commencement of United States v. Texas, and neither was\never a party to a desegregation order or have ever been shown to have acted with\nsegregative intent in accepting transfer students (or otherwise). During the\n2002-2003 school year, Harrold’s enrollment was 112 students, of whom 1% were\nBlack, 31% were Hispanic, and 63% were non-Hispanic white. Samnorwood’s\nenrollment for the same school year was 101 students, of whom 3% were Black,\n20% were Hispanic, and 75% were non-Hispanic white.\n       Both School Districts depend heavily on transfer students for their\neconomic viability. Each accepts transfer students regardless of the race or\nethnicity of the student, and neither charges tuition to any transfer student.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         See United States v.

Tex. Educ. Code §\n25.036. TEA annually distributes funds to Texas school districts based on the\naverage daily attendance of enrolled students, whether the students reside in\nthe district or have transferred from another district. Tex. Educ. Code §§\n7.055(b)(35), 42.005, 42.101. Other than allocating funding based on student\nenrollment, Texas law does not otherwise empower TEA to oversee student\ntransfers. Nevertheless, the Modified Order requires TEA to monitor all student\ntransfers and to refuse to fund transfers in certain circumstances.4\n       In order to comply with its obligations under the Modified Order, TEA\nrequires each school district to inform TEA whenever it receives a transfer\nstudent. Prior to 2002, schools recorded transfer data on paper and submitted\nit to TEA, but in the spring of 2002, TEA implemented a new automated Student\nTransfer System (“STS”) to track transfers. Under the new system, schools are\nstill required to report transfers, but now they submit that information\nelectronically using STS.5 Once a student transfer is submitted using STS, TEA\n\n\n       4\n         The Modified Order provides that: “[TEA] shall not approve transfers where the effect\nof such transfers will change the majority or minority percentage of the school population,\nbased on average daily attendance in such districts by more than one percent (1%), in either\nthe home or the receiving district or the home or receiving school.” But, as the district court\nnoted in its opinion below, “[f]or very small school districts (fewer than 300 students), including\nHarrold and Samnorwood, the tolerable percentage change in the diversity of the home and\nreceiving districts due to transfers is now three percent (3%).” Mem. Op., July 24, 2006, at 2.\nIn calculating the one or three percent threshold, all minority students are added together and\nthat percentage (the “minority percentage”) is compared to the percentage of non-Hispanic\nwhite students.\n       5\n        TEA switched to the automated system in response to complaints from school\nsuperintendents regarding the length of time it took TEA to determine whether a transfer\nstudent was eligible for funding under the old paper system.\n\n                                                4\n\f                                       No. 06-41347\n\ncalculates whether the transfer has a “segregative effect.”6 Any transfer that\nexceeds the applicable one- or three-percent rule is deemed ineligible. STS\noperates in “real time,” meaning that it maintains a current calculation of every\nschool district’s racial and ethnic demographics, so when a transfer student is\nentered into the system it calculates what effect that transfer has on the current\nminority percentage at the sending and receiving schools.7 STS does not make\na permanent record of whether transfers are deemed eligible when they are\nentered or of a school’s minority percentage on any particular day so there is no\nway for TEA to use STS to verify whether a transfer was deemed eligible when\nit was entered.8\n       In order to monitor the cumulative enrollment, TEA also requires school\ndistricts to report student data to its Public Education Information Management\nSystem (“PEIMS”) after each school year. See Tex. Educ. Code § 42.006. The\nPEIMS data allows TEA to compute the average daily attendance of each school\ndistrict. At the end of the year, TEA reconciles the data from PEIMS with the\ndata from STS to determine whether student transfers have caused a school’s\nminority percentage to change by more than one or three percent in violation of\nsection A(3)(b) of the Modified Order. If a school has accepted an ineligible\ntransfer in a particular year, the school loses funding for the next year for each\n\n\n       6\n         A transfer is determined to have segregative effect if it changes the sending or\nreceiving school’s minority percentage by more than one percent, three percent for small\nschools, and the transfer moves either school closer to being racially identifiable than it was\nbefore.\n       7\n          A consequence of this real time calculation is that a student could be listed as an\neligible transfer on the date he is entered into the system, but could later be listed as an\nineligible transfer depending on later demographic shifts in the sending or receiving schools.\nTEA has attempted to remedy this issue by not penalizing a school for a transfer if it can prove\nthat the transfer student was eligible for funding on the date he was entered into STS.\n       8\n        The only way a school district could prove whether a student was eligible on the date\nhe was entered into STS was to print the computer screen after entering the student into the\nsystem.\n\n                                               5\n\f                                       No. 06-41347\n\nday that the ineligible student attended the school. If a school district fails to\nenter a transfer into STS, TEA treats that student as an ineligible transfer and\nthe school loses funding for that student as well.\n       If a school district remains in violation after being notified by TEA that it\nhas accepted an ineligible transfer, the Modified Order instructs TEA to escalate\nsanctions against the district. Section A(6) requires TEA to refuse to fund\ntransfers that violate the order. Section A(7) requires TEA to suspend a school\ndistrict’s accreditation if it fails to correct the violation after a ten-day warning.\n       In this case, STS reported that Samnorwood exceeded the three-percent\nlimitation by accepting one ineligible transfer student, “Vincent R.,” and TEA\nalso determined that Samnorwood had failed to enter three transfers into STS.\nTEA informed Samnorwood by letter on March 24, 2004, that $10,746 in funds\nwould be withheld from its funding for the following year due to the three\nunreported students and Vincent R.’s transfer. In another letter dated March\n24, 2004, TEA informed Harrold that it would have $100,069 withheld from its\nfunding for the following year because it had failed to enter seventeen transfers\ninto STS. The School Districts both requested an informal review of TEA’s\nfunding decision as provided by TEA policy. During that review, both School\nDistricts admitted that they had not entered the transfers into STS, but they\nwere able to show that some of the transfers were nevertheless eligible for\nfunding because they were approved exemptions as defined by the Modified\nOrder.9 TEA waived the nonreporting fine for theses students.                     TEA also\nrestored funding for Vincent R. because Samnorwood was able to prove that, on\nthe day his transfer was entered, STS declared him an eligible transfer. TEA,\nhowever, left the fines intact for the three unreported transfers from\n\n\n\n       9\n         The Modified Order provides exceptions to the transfer rules for students whose older\nsiblings attend the school to which they wish to transfer and for students whose parents are\nteachers at the school to which they wish to transfer.\n\n                                              6\n\f                                      No. 06-41347\n\nSamnorwood and the twelve unreported and nonexempt transfers from Harrold,\nso after the informal review, Samnorwood was penalized $6,111, and Harrold\nwas penalized $68,525.10           In late 2004 the School Districts intervened into\nthis case (United States v. Texas) in order to challenge the sanctions imposed by\nTEA and the validity of the Modified Order on its face and as applied to them.\n       In its order, the district court held that it did not exceed its remedial\npower by entering the Modified Order because it did not seek to reverse\nsegregative effects on public schools based on private residential decisions, and\nthat its mandate was not more broad than necessary to cure a constitutional\ninjury. It also noted that the Modified Order properly applied statewide because\nit was meant to eliminate the vestige of discrimination that remained from the\nfact that Texas operated a “state-wide dual school system prior to desegregation\nin the 1960s.” Mem. Op., July 24, 2006.\n       On the issue of the sanctions, the district court held that since Texas\nprovides a “sparsity adjustment” to small schools that guarantees school districts\nwith Samnorwood and Harrold’s enrollment levels to be funded as if they had\n130 student, the School Districts did not receive any additional funds due to\nthese transfers.11 The district court then reasoned that sanctions by TEA were\nnot mandated by the Modified Order for transfers that decreased diversity by\nmore than three percent in schools that received the sparsity adjustment\nbecause section A(6) of the Modified Order only instructs TEA to refuse to\ntransfer funds associated with the ineligible transfer student, and since the\nSchool Districts were already being funded at a level of 130 students because of\nthe sparsity adjustment, they did not actually receive any extra funds due to the\n\n       10\n          TEA maintained that these financial sanctions were appropriate because the failure\nto enter transfers into STS effectively prevents TEA from determining which transfers comply\nwith the Modified Order.\n       11\n        The “sparsity adjustment” states that any school operating with less than 130 but\nmore than ninety students will be funded as if it had 130 students. Tex. Educ. Code § 42.105.\n\n                                             7\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\ntransfer of a new student.            The district court also admonished TEA for\nsanctioning school districts for failing to report transfers when STS did not\nmaintain a record of whether transfers were approved or not, thereby\nimpermissibly placing the burden on schools to keep a record of their STS\ntransactions themselves.\n        The district court ultimately held that the School Districts were not to be\nsanctioned, even for the students that they failed to enter into STS. However,\nit made it clear that TEA was free to sanction school districts who failed to enter\nstudent transfers into STS in the future. Order Den. Mot. to Am. J., Aug. 10,\n2006, at 1-2 (“TEA’s policy of sanctioning districts for their failure to enter\nstudents into the STS system is reasonable, and nothing in the Court’s\nMemorandum Opinion casts doubt on TEA’s continuing ability to impose such\nsanctions . . . .”).\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\nI.

The district court did not grant the School Districts any of\nthese forms of relief, so the School Districts’ claims for equitable relief are not\nmoot. However, we must still decide whether the School Districts have standing\nto seek these alternative forms of relief.\n       In order for a plaintiff to have sufficient standing under Article III, that\nplaintiff must show that: he has suffered or will suffer an injury, his injury is\n\n       13\n         LULAC also argues that if we were to decide this case it would be an advisory opinion\nbecause there are not sufficiently adverse parties.

LULAC itself also had the opportunity to challenge\nthe School Districts’ request for relief in its brief and at oral argument. Finally, the United\nStates participated in all aspects of this case up until the appellate phase and it too was\nchallenging the School Districts’ claims that they should no longer have to abide by the\nModified Order.

Here\nthe School Districts’ injury is being subjected to an injunctive remedy, the\nModified Order, which potentially imposes monetary fines, places them at risk\nof losing their accreditation, and limits their ability to accept student transfers\nthat they would otherwise be permitted to accept under Texas law.15 What\nmakes this case unique is that the School Districts were not a party to the\noriginal suit. If the School Districts had been a party directly bound by the\nModified Order there would be no question that they had standing to challenge\nthe Modified Order. Here the School Districts were not a party to the Modified\nOrder, but their actions are collaterally constrained by the Modified Order\nbecause it prohibits TEA from funding student transfers to their school that\nexceed the one- or three-percent threshold, and without funding they cannot\nafford to accept such transfers.\n       While we have found no cases directly on point, this situation is analogous\nto cases where this circuit has held that a third party had standing to appeal an\ninjunction which adversely affects its interest, even when it was not a party to\n\n\n       14\n          Neither TEA nor LULAC argue that the School Districts’ alleged injury is not\nredressable or traceable. TEA has admitted that its only authority to impose sanctions on\nschool districts because of student transfers flows from its obligation to implement the Modified\nOrder, so the potential sanctions are traceable to the Modified Order. Additionally, if this court\nwere to provide the School Districts with their requested relief, a declaration that the Modified\nOrder should not be applied to them, their alleged injury would be redressed. Therefore, the\nSchool Districts satisfy these two prongs of Article III standing.\n       15\n          While the district court’s order held that TEA can no longer deny the School Districts\nfunding for unapproved transfers as long they continue to fall within the sparsity adjustment\n(applicable to districts with 90 to less than 130 students, see note 11 supra), there is no\nguarantee that their enrollment will not exceed the sparsity adjustment in the future. In fact,\nHarrold enrolled 129 students for the 2003-2004 school year and Samnorwood enrolled 134\nstudents during the 2004-2005 school year. Additionally, the Modified Order instructs TEA\nto revoke the accreditation of school districts that continue to enroll a transfer student that\nexceeds the three-percent rule after ten days of being informed that the transfer student is\nineligible. This mandate of the Modified Order would apply whether or not the school falls\nwithin the sparsity adjustment.\n\n                                               10\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\nthe litigation.

So if the\nadverse affects of the equitable relief were sufficient to provide standing to the parties to\nappeal in the cited cases, similar adverse affects from the Modified Order are sufficient to give\nthe School Districts standing when they intervened in the district court and now to appeal the\ndecision of that court.\n\n                                               11\n\f                                       No. 06-41347\n\nregulations to enforce it, impose severe penalties if the School Districts fail to\nadhere to TEA’s reporting requirement or accept a transfer that trips the one-\nor three-percent rule.18 The School Districts also expend time and resources\ncomplying with the Modified Order every time they seek to accept a transfer\nstudent. Finally, the Modified Order effectively prohibits the School Districts\nfrom doing something that they contend they are permitted to do under Texas\nlaw and the United States Constitution: accept as many transfer students, of\nany race or ethnicity, as they wish if they do so in a nondiscriminatory manner.\nIn two school districts that rely on transfer students for their financial viability,\nthis is not a consequence to be ignored. For these reasons, the Modified Order\npresents a real adverse impact on theses schools, and therefore, they have\nstanding to challenge its application to them.19\n       At its core standing is about ensuring that a party with a sufficiently\nstrong interest is the one who brings a cause of action.

We can think of no better party to raise such a claim than the School\nDistricts themselves.\nII.   Merits\n      The School Districts argue that the Modified Order’s student transfer\nprovisions are unlawful because they exceed the equitable power of the district\ncourt to fashion a desegregation remedy.         Their argument flows from the\nprinciple that in “any equity case, the nature of the violation determines the\nscope of the remedy.” Swann v.

If a constitutional violation is found, we\nemploy an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the equitable remedy itself.\nSwann, 91 S.Ct. at 1280.\n      Here the School Districts contend that the Modified Order exceeds the\ndistrict court’s equitable power because it applies to them even though they have\nnever been under a desegregation order (and were never a party to this case\nuntil their 2004 intervention) and it was not shown that any of the transfers\ninvolved in this case were the approved due to an intent to discriminate. In\nsupport of their position, the School Districts cite a trio of cases involving the\nModified Order. In the first, this court held that a remedial order mandating\n\n                                         13\n\f                                        No. 06-41347\n\nthat school districts provide bilingual language education to Mexican-American\nstudents could not be imposed on school districts without first determining\nwhether they actually participated in segregation.

In the third, this court overturned an injunction\nentered pursuant to the Modified Order, which barred TEA from disbursing\nstate funding for any white transfer students at Mumford ISD and Mumford ISD\nfrom receiving any more white transfer students.                    United States v. Texas\n(Hearne), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (5th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he question is not whether\nMumford complied with TEA directives; Mumford must have acted with\ndiscriminatory intent in accepting the transfers.”).\n       Each of those opinions begin with the Supreme Court’s instruction in\nSwann: “the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.” 91\nS.Ct. at 1276. In each of the above cited decisions of this court, we struck down\nthe remedy because there had been no showing of a constitutional violation. We\nare presented with a similar situation. In this case, these two School Districts\nwere denied funding because they failed to enter students in the STS system\nthat TEA uses to monitor compliance with the order. TEA acknowledges (and\nneither LULAC nor the district court here ever disputed) that there is no basis\nunder Texas state law for it to impose such sanctions on the school districts.20\n\n       20\n         This opinion does not affect Texas’s ability to regulate or collect information regarding\nstudent transfers, if it should so choose. The issue presented in this case is whether the\n\n                                               14\n\f                                      No. 06-41347\n\nThe sole basis of TEA’s power to impose these sanctions stems from its duty to\ncomply with the Modified Order. Thus the modified order and TEA’s actions\npursuant to it constitute a remedy that must flow from a constitutional violation.\nMilliken II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2758</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. However, as in Goodrich and Hearne, neither Harrold\nnor Samnorwood have ever been found to have discriminated against students\nof the basis of their race or ethnicity. In fact, TEA does not (and did not)\ninvestigate or conduct a hearing to determine whether a particular transfer was\naccepted or denied due to a segregative intent on the part of a sending or\nreceiving school district before imposing sanctions on a school district. The\nfailure to report or the triggering of the one- or three-percent threshold is all\nthat is required. This use of an arbitrary percentage as a proxy for intentional\ndiscrimination has been criticized previously by this court,21 and such a\nquantitative review cannot substitute for actual evidence of intentional\ndiscrimination on the part of these two School Districts. There has been no such\nevidence presented in this case. Therefore, allowing these two School Districts\nto remain under the Modified Order would improperly impose a desegregation\nremedy where there has been no showing or finding of a constitutional violation.\n       In the district court’s memorandum opinion, it held that it was proper for\nTEA to enforce the student transfer provisions of the Modified Order against the\nSchool Districts because they were part of a state-wide dual school system. This\ninference, however, has been specifically rejected by this circuit. See Hearne,\n457 F.3d at 483 (“Because Mumford was not a party defendant to the original\nlitigation that resulted in Order 5281, it cannot be condemned for violating the\n\n\nModified Order can obligate TEA to enforce its student transfer provisions against these two\nSchool Districts.\n       21\n          The prophylactic percentage rule of the Modified Order is potentially an\n“unenforceable vestige of conditions long since substantially remedied . . . [that] lives on,\nhowever, as a cause of voluminous continuous recordkeeping and monitoring by TEA and all\nTexas school districts.” Hearne, 457 F.3d at 478 n.8.\n\n                                             15\n\f                                  No. 06-41347\n\nOrder without a finding that it intentionally engaged in segregative conduct.”).\nMoreover, the only evidence shows that neither of these two Districts has been\nany part of a dual or segregated school system ever since a time more than three\nyears prior to the initial filing this suit in March 1970, and there has been no\njudicial determination to the contrary.\n      The district court also held that because TEA was a defendant in the\ninitial suit and had been found to be promoting a dual-school systems in the\nstate of Texas, the Modified Order can permissibly mandate TEA to enforce\nprovisions of the Modified Order against any schools it funds. The district court\nbelieved that this was consistent with Swann’s mandate that a remedy may only\nextend as far as the constitutional violation. We cannot agree.\n      While it is undisputed that TEA funded some segregated schools at the\ntime the Modified Order was entered, that does not empower the district court\nto force TEA to impose a remedy on these two School Districts (neither of which\nhad been segregated for years prior to filing of the suit in which that order was\nentered).

Lee County Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"386900\"><a href=\"/opinion/386900/anthony-t-lee-united-states-of-america-plaintiff-intervenor-amicus/\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1256 (5th Cir. 1981)\n(“a federal court cannot impose liability on individual defendant school districts\non the basis of a general inverse respondeat superior theory holding them\npresumptively responsible for actions of the state or another governmental\nentity” and “one cannot presume that racial imbalances between separate school\ndistricts result from unconstitutional discriminatory acts on the part of those\nschool districts”) (citing and discussing Milliken v.

Had the School Districts been a party to the original 1970 litigation, the\ndistrict court would not have been able to impose a remedy policing their student\ntransfers because they were not (and had not been for more than three years\nbefore the suit was filed) segregating students. Additionally, since the dates on\nwhich both of the School Districts desegregated, there has not been a\ndetermination, or indeed any evidence, that either has attempted to resegregate\n\n\n                                        16\n\f                                   No. 06-41347\n\nor to accept student transfers with discriminatory intent.          Absent such a\nshowing, the district court cannot invoke TEA’s long past wrongdoing as a\njustification to require TEA to monitor nondiscriminatory student transfers\ninvolving Samnorwood and Harrold ISDs.\n      Of course, our opinion today does not give the School Districts a license to\ndiscriminate. If evidence arises that either of these school districts is acting with\ndiscriminatory intent when accepting or rejecting transfer students, then they\nwould be subject to suit and a remedy would then be in order to correct the\nconstitutional violation. Our decision today only holds that the prophylactic\nprovisions created by the Modified Order to remedy the segregative conduct on\nthe part of TEA and all-black schools in East Texas should not be imposed on\nthese two panhandle school districts that had long previously already\ndesegregated and have never since been found to have acted with segregative\nintent.\n                                 CONCLUSION\n      We render judgment that Samnorwood ISD and Harrold ISD shall no\nlonger be subject to the Modified Order’s student transfer provisions or TEA’s\nregulations promulgated to enforce those provisions. To the extent that the\ndistrict court declined to so rule its judgment is reversed.\n                         REVERSEDand RENDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f</pre>",
