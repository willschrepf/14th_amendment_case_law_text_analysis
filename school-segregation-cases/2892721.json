After a trial, Royal obtained a judgment against Reid for\n$1.00, and was awarded attorney fees in the amount of $1.50. The district court\nexpressly found “Royal did not sustain a physical injury.” Consequently, the district\ncourt1 denied mental or emotional damages, awarding only nominal damages, and\nfurther denied an award of punitive damages. We affirm.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n       While an inmate at IMCC, an institution within the Iowa Department of\nCorrections, Royal made numerous complaints and grievances. Most of Royal’s\ncomplaints followed unsuccessful requests for medical care to address a spinal cord\ninjury. After Reid tired of Royal’s behavior, Reid placed Royal in segregation for\nsixty days. Royal filed a section 1983 suit against the IMCC officials, including\nReid, for retaliation against Royal’s First Amendment rights and access to the courts.\nThe defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court denied.\nIn denying the motion for summary judgment, the district court determined the record\ncontained no allegations and no evidence showing Royal sustained physical injury.\n\n\n\n      1\n      By consent of the parties, the dispute was referred for final disposition to the\nHonorable Ross A. Walters, United States Magistrate Judge for the Southern District\nof Iowa. 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fThus, the district court determined the Prison Litigation and Reform Act of 1995\n(PLRA) limited Royal’s damages to nominal damages. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).\n\n       Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court found Reid had\nunconstitutionally retaliated against Royal by placing him in segregation because\nRoyal filed numerous grievances. Since Royal did not suffer physical injury, the\ndistrict court assessed nominal damages of $1.00. The district court considered\npunitive damages, but decided against them after finding Reid did not act with evil\nmotive or reckless indifference, but out of frustration and a desire to protect his staff\nfrom Royal’s abuse. Because Reid had retired, the district court also found punitive\ndamages would not deter future conduct. Applying the PLRA’s limitation on attorney\nfees, the district court awarded attorney fees in the amount of $1.50 to Royal.\n\n       On appeal, Royal asserts three grounds for reversing the district court. First,\nRoyal contends he is entitled to more than nominal damages, even though he suffered\nno physical injury. Second, Royal contends the district court abused its discretion by\nfailing to award punitive damages. Third, Royal attacks the constitutionality of the\nPLRA’s limitation on attorney fees.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.    Standard of Review\n       We “review claims of constitutional error and issues of statutory construction\nde novo.” Foulk v. Charrier, 262 F.3d 687, 703 (8th Cir. 2001). However, the district\ncourt’s damages award, including the district court’s decision to deny punitive\ndamages, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Trobaugh v. Hall, 176 F.3d 1087,\n1088-89 (8th Cir. 1999). We review the district court’s factual findings for clear\nerror. See Williams v. Brimeyer, 116 F.3d 351, 354 (8th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       B.     Compensatory Damages\n       The PLRA states “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner\nconfined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury\nsuffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(e). With commendable candor, Royal acknowledges he did not suffer\nphysical injury, and does not challenge the district court’s conclusion Royal suffered\nno physical injury as a result of Reid’s actions. However, Royal contends the PLRA\ndoes not limit his damages simply because he did not suffer physical injury. Royal\nargues (1) the PLRA’s limitation on damages does not apply to First Amendment\nviolations, and (2) his claim for being improperly segregated does not involve mental\nor emotional injury, so the PLRA should not limit his damages.\n\n       We are not the first court to confront whether section 1997e(e) applies to First\nAmendment violations. Other courts have not agreed on a uniform interpretation of\nsection 1997e(e). The majority of courts hold section 1997e(e)’s limitation on\ndamages applies to all federal prisoner lawsuits. See, e.g., Thompson v. Carter, 284\nF.3d 411, 416 (2d Cir. 2002) (concluding “[s]ection 1997e(e) applies to all federal\ncivil actions including claims alleging constitutional violations”); Searles v. Van\nBebber, 251 F.3d 869, 876 (10th Cir. 2001) (holding section 1997e(e) applies to First\nAmendment violations); Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247, 250-51 (3d Cir. 2000)\n(holding section 1997e(e) applies to First Amendment violations); Todd v. Graves,\n217 F. Supp. 2d 958, 961 (S.D. Iowa 2002) (holding section 1997e(e) applies to\nFourteenth Amendment suits). Some courts have charted a different course,\nexcluding First and Fourteenth Amendment claims from section 1997e(e)’s reach.\nSee, e.g., Canell v. Lightner, 143 F.3d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding section\n1997e(e) does not apply to First Amendment claims); Mason v. Schriro, 45 F. Supp.\n2d 709, 719 (W.D. Mo. 1999) (holding section 1997e(e) does not apply to Fourteenth\nAmendment equal protection claims).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f       We join the majority, concluding Congress did not intend section 1997e(e) to\nlimit recovery only to a select group of federal actions brought by prisoners. Instead,\nwe read section 1997e(e) as limiting recovery for mental or emotional injury in all\nfederal actions brought by prisoners. In reaching this conclusion, we cannot escape\nthe unmistakably clear language Congress used: “No Federal civil action may be\nbrought by a prisoner . . . for mental or emotional injury . . . without a prior showing\nof physical injury.” To read this statute to exempt First Amendment claims would\nrequire us to interpret “[n]o Federal civil action” to mean “[n]o Federal civil action\n[except for First Amendment violations].” If Congress desires such a reading of\nsection 1997e(e), Congress can certainly say so. We cannot.\n\n        Royal’s second argument is his claim does not involve mental or emotional\ninjury, so the PLRA should not limit his recovery rights. Royal apparently contends\nother types of recovery are available to him. To the extent Royal argues nominal\ndamages, punitive damages, and injunctive and declaratory relief are available to him,\nwe agree. Congress did not intend section 1997e(e) to bar recovery for all forms of\nrelief. See, e.g., Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 308 (1986)\n(holding nominal damages should be granted for section 1983 claims when actual\ninjury cannot be shown); Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983) (holding punitive\ndamages are authorized for violations of constitutional rights); Hughes v. Lott, 350\nF.3d 1157, 1162 (11th Cir. 2003) (holding section 1997e(e) does not preclude\nnominal damages); Thompson, 284 F.3d at 418 (holding section 1997e(e) does not\npreclude injunctive relief or nominal damages); Searles, 251 F.3d at 878-79 (holding\nsection 1997e(e) does not preclude nominal damages); Davis v. Dist. of Columbia,\n158 F.3d 1342, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (stating section 1997e(e) does not preclude\ninjunctive relief); Zehner v. Trigg, 133 F.3d 459, 462 (7th Cir. 1997) (same).\nTherefore, Royal was free to seek nominal damages, punitive damages, injunctive\nrelief and a declaratory judgment. Congress is well within its authority to balance the\ninterests and reasonably limit a prisoner’s relief.\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f       The district court awarded $1.00 in nominal damages to Royal, and considered\nawarding punitive damages. Faithfully following the PLRA, the district court\nappropriately awarded Royal $1.00 in nominal damages for Royal’s First Amendment\nviolation. Royal may not recover some indescribable and indefinite damage allegedly\narising from a violation of his constitutional rights. See, e.g., Stachura, 477 U.S. at\n308 n.11 (stating “nominal damages, and not damages based on some undefinable\n‘value’ of infringed rights, are the appropriate means of ‘vindicating’ rights whose\ndeprivation has not caused actual, provable injury”); Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247,\n267 (1978) (holding nominal damage award of $1.00 required for procedural due\nprocess violation); Risdal v. Halford, 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) (holding\ncourt must award nominal damages in the amount of $1.00 for First Amendment\nviolations).2\n\n\n      2\n        Besides the rejected compensatory damages claim for mental or emotional\ninjury, we are uncertain as to what damages Royal seeks. Citing Trobaugh, Royal\nseemingly seeks damages for each day he wrongfully spent in segregation, a loss of\nliberty injury. In Trobaugh, a prisoner filed a section 1983 suit for being placed in\nsegregation for exercising his First Amendment rights. Trobaugh, 176 F.3d at 1088.\nThe district court found the prisoner’s First Amendment rights had been violated, and\nawarded him $1.00 as nominal damages. Id. On appeal, our court concluded the\ndistrict court’s “compensatory damage award was patently insufficient to compensate\n[the prisoner] for the injury he suffered by being placed in segregation in retaliation\nfor exercising his constitutional right.” Id. at 1089. Remanding the case for a new\ndamages award, the court stated an “appropriate amount . . . would be in the vicinity\nof $100 per day for each [day] spent in administrative segregation.” Id. Trobaugh\ndoes not control Royal’s case, because the Trobaugh court did not confront the\nPLRA’s limitation on recovery in prisoner suits. The Trobaugh court also did not\ndiscuss what injury the $100 per day compensated. Nor did the court explain how it\narrived at $100 per day as an “appropriate” damage assessment. Finally, the\nTrobaugh court did not discuss whether the prisoner had been released from prison,\nwhich would have taken his case outside of section 1997e(e), had it even applied.\nBecause the Trobaugh court was not limited by the PLRA, as we are in this case, we\ndecline to extend the holding from Trobaugh to cover a damage award subject to the\nPLRA’s limitations.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f       C.     Punitive Damages\n       A factfinder may assess punitive damages in a section 1983 action when a\n“defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it\ninvolves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.”\nWade, 461 U.S. at 56. If a district court finds a defendant’s conduct meets the\nthreshold for awarding punitive damages, the court should then consider the two\npurposes of punitive damages: (1) punish willful or malicious conduct; and (2) deter\nfuture unlawful conduct. Coleman v. Rahija, 114 F.3d 778, 787 (8th Cir. 1997). An\nappellate court should not lightly reverse a district court’s decision to award–or not\nto award–punitive damages in a section 1983 case. Because a district court’s decision\nto award punitive damages involves “a discretionary moral judgment,” we empower\na district court with enough discretion to make its proper judgment call without fear\nof inappropriate appellate intervention. Id.; Taylor v. Howe, 280 F.3d 1210, 1212\n(8th Cir. 2002) (holding district court’s decision not to award punitive damages was\nnot an abuse of discretion because “the Court’s action [was not] so far out of bounds\nas to justify appellate intervention”). We reverse only when we are convinced the\ndecision to award–or not to award–punitive damages constitutes an abuse of\ndiscretion. Coleman, 114 F.3d at 787-88.\n\n        Given the highly deferential standard of review, we find no reversible error for\nthree reasons. First, the district court accurately stated and applied the appropriate\nlegal standard on punitive damages. Second, the district court’s factual findings were\nnot clearly erroneous. As the factfinder, the district court found no “evil motive” or\n“reckless or callous indifference” in Reid’s actions. Instead, the district court found\nReid acted, in part, out of frustration and a concern to protect his staff from Royal’s\nabuse. Third, the district court concluded the purposes behind punitive damages\nwould not be advanced in this case. The district court noted Reid’s retirement\nweighed against awarding punitive damages, because a punitive damages award\nwould not deter Reid’s future conduct. The district court also concluded punitive\ndamages were unnecessary to deter others. This conclusion is buttressed by the\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdistrict court finding Reid’s conduct violated the First Amendment, of which every\nIMCC employee should be made aware.\n\n      Royal contends Trobaugh also controls the punitive damages issue. However,\nthe court in Trobaugh did not hold the district court abused its discretion by not\nawarding punitive damages. Instead, the court held the district court abused its\ndiscretion by awarding only $1.00 for nominal damages. Trobaugh, 176 F.3d at\n1088-89. Since the court reversed the district court on the nominal damages award\nand remanded for reconsideration, the court asked the district court to reconsider its\ndecision not to award punitive damages. Id. at 1089. Indeed, the district court\nrefused to award punitive damages upon remand. We conclude Trobaugh does not\nrequire us to reverse the district court’s decision not to award punitive damages.\n\n        Because the district court applied the correct legal standard, and exercised its\ndiscretion in denying punitive damages, we refuse to second-guess the district court’s\ndecision. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in not awarding\npunitive damages to Royal.\n\n      D.   Attorney Fees\n      The PLRA places the following limitation on awards of attorney fees:\n\n      Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action [brought by a\n      prisoner in which attorney fees are authorized], a portion of the\n      judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the\n      amount of attorney[] fees awarded against the defendant. If the award\n      of attorney[] fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the\n      excess shall be paid by the defendant.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(2). Although awkwardly worded, the PLRA allows an award\nof attorney fees for 150 percent of the damages award.\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f       Royal contends the PLRA’s attorney fees limitation violates his constitutional\nrights. Based on settled Eighth Circuit precedent, the district court rejected Royal’s\nconstitutional attack and awarded attorney fees in the amount of $1.50 (i.e., 150\npercent of the $1.00 monetary judgment).\n\n       On appeal, Royal recognizes Eighth Circuit precedent controls the issue of the\nconstitutionality of the PLRA’s attorney fee limitation. We agree. In Foulk, 262 F.3d\nat 704, our circuit joined other circuits in holding “the PLRA’s attorney[] fees cap\npasses constitutional muster.” See Robinson v. Hager, 292 F.3d 560, 563 n.2 (8th\nCir. 2002) (following Foulk “because this circuit has already upheld the\nconstitutionality of the PLRA, and because a panel cannot overturn another panel’s\ndecision”). In deciding the PLRA’s attorney fee limitation was constitutional, our\ncourt recognized “we are not authorized to act as a superlegislature to judge the\nwisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations made in areas that neither\naffect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines. Moreover, our role is not\nto judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices.” Foulk, 262 F.3d at 704\n(quoting Walker v. Bain, 257 F.3d 660, 670 (6th Cir. 2001)).\n\n       Notwithstanding our circuit’s binding decision upholding the PLRA’s\nlimitation on attorney fees, Royal wishes to await this panel’s decision and seek en\nbanc review to overrule Foulk. Agreeing with the district court’s decision to limit\nattorney fees to 150 percent of the damages award, we affirm the district court’s\naward of $1.50 in attorney fees.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s judgment in Royal’s\nfavor, including its decision to award $1.00 in nominal damages and not to award\npunitive damages. We also affirm the district court’s order limiting the attorney fees\naward to $1.50, or 150 percent of the damages award.\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fHEANEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       Based on court precedent, the language of the physical injury requirement, and\nthe legislative history of the Prison Litigation Reform Act ( PLRA), I disagree with\nthe majority’s holding that 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) bars compensatory damages for\nviolations of the First Amendment, and therefore, respectfully dissent.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Jeff Royal was convicted of “cattle rustling” and sentenced on August 10,\n1998, to a term of five years in the Iowa Department of Corrections system. Prior to\nhis conviction, Royal fell through a haymow and suffered a spinal cord injury\nrequiring him to use a wheelchair. Royal was initially sent to the Iowa Medical and\nClassification Center (IMCC) and assigned to the general population. Royal became\ndissatisfied with the medical treatment he received and filed a pro se complaint on\nSeptember 10, 1998. His complaint included allegations that: 1) he could not turn his\nwheelchair in his cell; 2) he was unable to get to the toilet or shower; 3) he had blood\nin his catheter but no action was taken by medical staff because he did not have an\nelevated temperature; 4) he was transferred in a van that was not handicapped\naccessible, requiring him to fall to the floor before pulling himself onto the van’s seat;\n5) he had to fall on the ground and pull himself up onto a shower chair in order to\nshower; 6) he had to lay on the floor after using the toilet to pull on his prison-issue\njumpsuit, and his request to wear pants instead of a jumpsuit was denied; and 7) his\nrequests for an enema were delayed - once for ten days and once for six days. Royal’s\nrequest for the assistance of counsel was granted on September 29, 1998.\n\n       In October of 1998, the IMCC medical director decided that Royal did not need\nhis analgesics and confiscated his wheelchair. Royal complained that the crutches he\nwas expected to use caused him pain and tingling in his hands and that the health\nservice unit was far away, making it difficult for him to show up for his periodic\n\n                                          -10-\n\fexercises. Between November 1998 and January 1999, Royal submitted seventeen\ngrievances in attempt to regain his wheelchair. On December 24, 1998, Royal filed\na preliminary injunction motion to get his wheelchair back. Accompanying the\nmotion was an affidavit in which Royal stated that his leg brace had broken and,\nwithout his wheelchair, he had to crawl on the floor. Royal also asserted in the\naffidavit that when Tom Reid, the IMCC Security Director, was notified that Royal\nhad to crawl on the floor, Reid issued a memorandum stating that any inmate seen\ncrawling on the floor would be subject to discipline.\n\n      On January 12, 1999, prior to the preliminary injunction hearing, Royal had a\nconsultation with a neurosurgeon at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinic. The\ndoctor stated that the use of crutches was putting pressure on Royal’s ulnar nerve and\nrecommended that Royal’s wheelchair be returned to him. The prison authorities\nreturned his wheelchair and the preliminary injunction hearing was cancelled.\n\n       On January 28, 1999, Royal was “written up” after a confrontation with a nurse\nin the health services unit. Shortly thereafter, Royal was removed from the general\npopulation and placed in summary administrative segregation or, “lock up.” Prior to\nbeing placed in segregation, Royal had been rated as above average in adjusting to\nprison work and outstanding in adjusting to his living unit. He remained in\nsegregation until March 25, 1999, when he was transferred to another facility. Royal\nwas paroled in December 1999.\n\n       Royal brought this suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that he was\nretaliated against for exercising his right of access to the courts when he was placed\nin segregation for almost two months.3 The magistrate judge agreed, holding that\nRoyal was placed in segregation in retaliation for filing complaints in violation of his\n\n\n      3\n         This complaint was filed on July 27, 2000. Royal’s amended complaint is a\nretaliation claim and dismisses his original complaints about his medical care.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fFirst Amendment rights. The magistrate judge, however, denied Royal’s claims for\nboth compensatory and punitive damages, awarding Royal $1.00 in nominal damages\nand his attorney $1.50 as 150% of the damages award. Royal now appeals the denial\nof compensatory and punitive damages and the limitation on attorney’s fees.\n\n                   II. PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n       The PLRA was enacted on April 26, 1996, as part of an extensive omnibus\nappropriations bill. Section 1997e(e) of the PLRA is entitled “Limitation on\nrecovery” and states that “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner . .\n. for mental or emotional injury . . . without a prior showing of physical injury.” 42\nU.S.C. § 1997e(e). The physical injury requirement of this provision has been\nlitigated in almost every circuit, with extremely varying results. One of the key\ndisputes is whether the physical injury requirement applies to constitutional claims\nin which physical injuries rarely occur, such as violations of the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments. The majority states in its opinion that the majority of circuits have held\nthat § 1997e(e)’s limitation on damages applies to First Amendment claims. A\nreview of the case law, however, reveals that courts in a majority of the circuits have\neither affirmatively held that § 1997e(e) does not apply to First Amendment claims,\nor have declined to apply the physical injury requirement to such claims.\n\n       In the first circuit court opinion to hold that § 1997e(e) does not apply to First\nAmendment claims regardless of the form of relief sought, the Ninth Circuit in Canell\nv. Lightner, 143 F.3d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir. 1998), held that “[t]he deprivation of First\nAmendment rights entitles a plaintiff to judicial relief wholly aside from any physical\ninjury he can show.” The Seventh Circuit agreed, holding that a “deprivation of First\nAmendment rights standing alone is a cognizable injury,” therefore “[a] prisoner is\nentitled to judicial relief for a violation of his First Amendment rights aside from any\nphysical, mental, or emotional injury he may have sustained.” Rowe v. Shake, 196\nF.3d 778, 781-82 (7th Cir. 1999). The Fifth and Sixth Circuits have both declined to\n\n                                          -12-\n\fapply § 1997e(e) to First Amendment claims. See Oliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 747\nn.20 (5th Cir. 2002) (applying the physical injury requirement to claims of cruel and\nunusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, but declining to reach the issue\nin a First Amendment case); Williams v. Ollis, 230 F.3d 1361 (6th Cir. 2000)\n(unpublished table decision) (stating that the plaintiff’s First Amendment claim was\nnot precluded by § 1997e(e)). The First Circuit Court of Appeals has not addressed\nthe application of § 1997e(e) to First Amendment claims, but a district court in\nMassachusetts held that § 1997e(e) does not apply to violations of abstract rights\nreasoning that “the harms proscribed by the First Amendment, Due Process, or Equal\nProtection are assaults on individual freedom and personal liberty, even on spiritual\nautonomy, and not on physical well-being.” Shaheed-Muhammad v. Dipaolo, 138 F.\nSupp. 2d 99, 101 (D. Mass. 2001). Lastly, district courts in the Second Circuit have\nalso held that § 1997e(e) does not apply to First Amendment claims. See Lipton v.\nCounty of Orange, 2004 WL 876051, at *16-*17 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2004); Amaker\nv. Haponik, 1999 WL 76798, at *7-*8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 1999); Birth v. Pepe, 1999\nWL 684162, *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 21, 1999).4\n\n      Only three circuits have definitively held that the PLRA’s physical injury\nrequirement applies to all constitutional claims. In Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247,\n250 (3d Cir. 2000), the Third Circuit asserted that § 1983 compensatory damages are\ngoverned by general tort-law compensation theory and the plain language of\n§ 1997e(e) makes no distinction between different types of federal action. The Tenth\nCircuit in Searles v. Van Bebber, 251 F.3d 869, 876 (10th Cir. 2001), also held that\n\n\n      4\n         The majority cites to Thompson v. Carter, 284 F.3d 411 (2d Cir. 2002), and\nasserts that the Second Circuit has held that § 1997e(e) applies to First Amendment\nclaims. Thompson, however, involved § 1997e(e)’s application to an Eighth\nAmendment claim, not a First Amendment claim. District courts in the Second\nCircuit, both before and after Thompson, have recognized that the two claims are\ndistinct and have not applied § 1997e(e) to First Amendment claims such as the one\nbefore us.\n\n                                        -13-\n\f“[t]he plain language of the statute does not permit alteration of its clear damages\nrestrictions on the basis of the underlying rights being asserted,” therefore “[t]he\nstatute limits the remedies available, regardless of the rights asserted, if the only\ninjuries are mental or emotional.” The D.C. Circuit in Davis v. District of Columbia,\n158 F.3d 1342, 1348 (D.C. Cir. 1998), also held that § 1997e(e) bars compensatory\ndamages for First Amendment claims without physical injury.\n\n       Our court has yet to reach this issue. We are, however, faced with an intra-\ncircuit split: two district courts have considered the applicability of § 1997e(e) to\nconstitutional claims and have reached opposite results. In Mason v. Schriro, 45 F.\nSupp. 2d 709, 719 (W.D. Mo. 1999), the court held that § 1997e(e) did not prevent\nthe plaintiff from recovering damages for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause such actions are not brought for mental or emotional injury. The court in\nTodd v. Graves, 217 F. Supp. 2d 958, 961 (S.D. Iowa 2002), however, declined to\nfollow Mason and held that § 1997e(e) barred recovery of compensatory damages for\nviolations of Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n       Absent guidance from our circuit, I look to the statute itself to determine if it\nwas intended to limit constitutional claims. When interpreting a statute, a court\nshould always begin with the plain meaning of the statute. Dowd v. United Steel\nWorkers of Am., Local No. 286, 253 F.3d 1093, 1099 (8th Cir. 2001). If the plain\nlanguage of the statute is unambiguous, the judicial inquiry ends. Id. Courts\ninterpreting the plain language of § 1997e(e), however, have reached differing results\nwhich leads me to the conclusion that the language is neither plain nor unambiguous.\n\n       Some courts read § 1997e(e) and focus on the language “for mental or\nemotional injury.” These courts have generally held that § 1997e(e) does not apply\nto First Amendment claims reasoning that First Amendment claims are not claims for\nmental or emotional injury, but are for violations of intangible and invaluable rights\nwhose deprivation is an injury in and of itself.\n\n                                         -14-\n\f       Other courts, however, focus on the statute’s “no Federal civil action”\nlanguage. They argue that the use of the word “no” shows Congress’s intent that\nthere not be any exceptions to the physical injury requirement. They reason that, in\norder to receive compensatory damages, the plaintiff must prove a compensable\ninjury which, under general tort-law theory, is limited to physical or emotional injury.\nTherefore, if a claim does not allege a physical injury, as most First Amendment\nclaims do not, yet seeks compensatory damages, the plaintiff must be asserting a\nclaim for mental or emotional damages which would be barred under § 1997e(e).\nOne court, however, focused on this same “plain language” yet reached the opposite\nresult. Amaker, 1999 WL 76798, at *7. In that case, the district court held that\n§ 1997e(e) does not apply to First Amendment claims reasoning that if the physical\ninjury requirement applied to all federal civil suits the language “for mental or\nemotional injury” would be superfluous which is “contrary to the well-established\nprinciple that all words in a statute should be read to have meaning.” Id. In other\nwords, “[i]f Congress had intended to apply § 1997e(e)’s restriction to all federal civil\nsuits by prisoners, it could easily have done so simply by dropping the qualifying\nlanguage ‘for mental or emotional injury.’” Id.\n\n       Although many courts, and the majority in this case, have found that the\nlanguage of § 1997e(e) is “unmistakably clear” (ante at 5), based on the current\ncircuit split as to whether § 1997e(e) applies to First Amendment claims, I disagree.\nAccordingly, because the plain language of the statute is ambiguous, I believe we\nmust consider “the purpose, the subject matter and the condition of affairs which led\nto its enactment.” United States v. McAllister, 225 F.3d 982, 986 (8th Cir. 2000)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, “[w]hen the meaning of a statute\nis questionable, it should be given a sensible construction and construed to effectuate\nthe underlying purpose of the law.” Id.\n\n      The legislative history of the PLRA shows a clear legislative intent to decrease\nthe number of frivolous lawsuits filed by inmates. There is nothing in the legislative\n\n                                          -15-\n\fhistory of § 1997e(e), however, to suggest that Congress’s intent was to prevent\nlegitimate constitutional claims simply because the prisoner suffered no physical\ninjury.5 Although the bill was called “far-reaching,” the Senate focused almost\nexclusively on limiting “non-meritorious” and “frivolous” inmate litigation, while\nassuring that the legislation would not prevent legitimate claims and would actually\n“help protect convicted criminals’ constitutional rights.” 141 Cong. Rec. S14317\n(1995) (statement of Sen. Abraham). According to Senator Hatch, the PLRA was\nintended to “help bring relief to a civil justice system overburdened by frivolous\nprisoner lawsuits . . . and will ensure that Federal court orders are limited to\nremedying actual violations of prisoners’ rights.” 141 Cong. Rec. S14418 (1995).\nThe Senators repeatedly stated that legitimate constitutional claims would not be\nprevented. Instead, the legislation was aimed at prisoners who “file free lawsuits in\nresponse to almost any perceived slight or inconvenience.” Id. (statement of Sen.\nKyl). Examples of such frivolous lawsuits presented by the Senators included:\ninadequate locker space; a bad haircut given by a prison barber; the failure of prison\nofficials to invite a prisoner to a pizza party for a departing prison employee; being\nserved chunky instead of creamy peanut butter; being denied the use of a Gameboy\nvideo game; being issued shoes that were a quarter size too big; being served “hacked\n\n\n\n      5\n        To be fair, there is almost nothing in the legislative history as to § 1997e(e)\nat all. According to one scholar, “[n]o aspect of the PLRA received less\ncongressional deliberation than § 1997e(e).” James E. Robertson, Psychological\nInjury and the Prison Litigation Reform Act: A “Not Exactly” Equal Protection\nAnalysis, 37 Harv. J. on Legis. 105, 114 (2000); see also Zehner v. Trigg, 952 F.\nSupp. 1318, 1325 (S.D. Ind. 1997) (“The legislative history contains virtually no\ndiscussion specifically concerning . . . § 1997e(e).”), Benjamin v. Jacobson, 935 F.\nSupp. 332, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“[I]t is worth noting that some believe that [the\nPLRA] which has a far-reaching effect on prison conditions and prisoners’ rights\ndeserved to have been the subject of significant debate. It was not. A single Senate\nhearing before the Judiciary Committee, one substantive House Report, and some\nfloor debate is all we can find.”).\n\n                                         -16-\n\fup” cake for dessert; prison officials throwing out an inmate’s belongings after he\nescaped; and being denied dental floss.\n\n       There is a clear difference between the types of claims listed by Congress and\nhistorically actionable and meritorious claims under the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments. When a plaintiff files suit for a violation of his First Amendment\nrights, his claim is based on a deprivation of an intangible right. Whether his claim\nis valid is not linked to the existence or severity of his mental or emotional anguish.\nCertainly First Amendment violations can result in mental or emotional injury, and\nperhaps even physical injury, but § 1983 claims for First Amendment violations are\nnot brought to redress such injuries. They are brought to redress the actual violation\nof the right. This is supported by the purpose behind the First Amendment. The First\nAmendment “is not concerned with preventing physical abuse by government agents,\nbut rather with the invasion of the ‘sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the\npurpose of the First Amendment to our Constitution to reserve from all official\ncontrol.’” Shaheed-Muhammad, 138 F.Supp at 108 (quoting West Virginia State Bd.\nof Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943)). In addition, First Amendment\nviolations occur at the time of the deprivation, not at a later time when the physical\nor emotional harm manifests. First Amendment rights “are abridged the moment a\nstate silences free speech or prevents a citizen from following the precepts of his\nreligion. While the violation may be accompanied by psychological or even physical\ninjury, the severity of incursion is not necessarily measured in those terms.” Id. at\n101.\n\n       The PLRA has many provisions other than § 1997e(e) which serve to prevent\nfrivolous lawsuits, including frivolous First Amendment suits. The PLRA: 1)\nrequires prisoner-plaintiffs to exhaust all administrative remedies before filing § 1983\nactions; 2) requires prisoner-plaintiffs pay the initial filing fee or make monthly\ninstallment payments from their personal accounts when bringing suits in forma\npauperis (IFP); 3) makes it easier for judges to dismiss malicious or frivolous suits;\n\n                                         -17-\n\f4) prohibits a prisoner from filing a suit IFP after having three previous suits\ndismissed as frivolous, malicious, or failing to state a claim; and 5) allows judges to\nrevoke an inmate’s good time credit as a sanction for filing a malicious claim, filing\na claim solely to harass the defendant, testifying falsely, or presenting false evidence.\nAll of these provisions serve Congress’s intent of decreasing frivolous lawsuits\nwithout effecting the ability of prisoners to vindicate there legitimate constitutional\nclaims. Royal’s ability to withstand all of these hurdles is further proof that his claim\nwas not frivolous and was not they type of claim Congress intended to thwart.\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n       Royal’s claim is not frivolous. As found by the magistrate judge, Royal’s First\nAmendment rights were violated when he was placed in segregation in retaliation for\nexercising his constitutional rights. Based on the language of § 1997e(e), the\n“purpose, subject matter and the condition of affairs which led to its enactment,” and\nthe other significant provisions of the PLRA which serve to put a stop to frivolous\nprisoner litigation, I would find that Royal’s claim for compensatory damages is not\nbarred by § 1997e(e) of the PLRA.\n                        ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f",

After a trial, Royal obtained a judgment against Reid for\n$1.00, and was awarded attorney fees in the amount of $1.50. The district court\nexpressly found “Royal did not sustain a physical injury.” Consequently, the district\ncourt1 denied mental or emotional damages, awarding only nominal damages, and\nfurther denied an award of punitive damages. We affirm.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n       While an inmate at IMCC, an institution within the Iowa Department of\nCorrections, Royal made numerous complaints and grievances. Most of Royal’s\ncomplaints followed unsuccessful requests for medical care to address a spinal cord\ninjury. After Reid tired of Royal’s behavior, Reid placed Royal in segregation for\nsixty days. Royal filed a section 1983 suit against the IMCC officials, including\nReid, for retaliation against Royal’s First Amendment rights and access to the courts.\nThe defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court denied.\nIn denying the motion for summary judgment, the district court determined the record\ncontained no allegations and no evidence showing Royal sustained physical injury.\n\n\n\n      1\n      By consent of the parties, the dispute was referred for final disposition to the\nHonorable Ross A. Walters, United States Magistrate Judge for the Southern District\nof Iowa. 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fThus, the district court determined the Prison Litigation and Reform Act of 1995\n(PLRA) limited Royal’s damages to nominal damages. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).\n\n       Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court found Reid had\nunconstitutionally retaliated against Royal by placing him in segregation because\nRoyal filed numerous grievances. Since Royal did not suffer physical injury, the\ndistrict court assessed nominal damages of $1.00. The district court considered\npunitive damages, but decided against them after finding Reid did not act with evil\nmotive or reckless indifference, but out of frustration and a desire to protect his staff\nfrom Royal’s abuse. Because Reid had retired, the district court also found punitive\ndamages would not deter future conduct. Applying the PLRA’s limitation on attorney\nfees, the district court awarded attorney fees in the amount of $1.50 to Royal.\n\n       On appeal, Royal asserts three grounds for reversing the district court. First,\nRoyal contends he is entitled to more than nominal damages, even though he suffered\nno physical injury. Second, Royal contends the district court abused its discretion by\nfailing to award punitive damages. Third, Royal attacks the constitutionality of the\nPLRA’s limitation on attorney fees.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.    Standard of Review\n       We “review claims of constitutional error and issues of statutory construction\nde novo.” Foulk v. Charrier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774623\"><a href=\"/opinion/774623/robert-foulk-v-ronald-charrier-lieutenant-charrier-individually-and-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 703 (8th Cir. 2001). However, the district\ncourt’s damages award, including the district court’s decision to deny punitive\ndamages, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Trobaugh v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764106\"><a href=\"/opinion/764106/charles-a-trobaugh-v-sergeant-hall-sued-as-sargeant-hall-linn-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1088-89 (8th Cir. 1999). We review the district court’s factual findings for clear\nerror. See Williams v. Brimeyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741974\"><a href=\"/opinion/741974/harold-d-williams-v-larry-brimeyer-sued-as-larry-brimyer-john-sissel-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354 (8th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       B.     Compensatory Damages\n       The PLRA states “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner\nconfined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury\nsuffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(e). With commendable candor, Royal acknowledges he did not suffer\nphysical injury, and does not challenge the district court’s conclusion Royal suffered\nno physical injury as a result of Reid’s actions. However, Royal contends the PLRA\ndoes not limit his damages simply because he did not suffer physical injury. Royal\nargues (1) the PLRA’s limitation on damages does not apply to First Amendment\nviolations, and (2) his claim for being improperly segregated does not involve mental\nor emotional injury, so the PLRA should not limit his damages.\n\n       We are not the first court to confront whether section 1997e(e) applies to First\nAmendment violations.

Instead,\nwe read section 1997e(e) as limiting recovery for mental or emotional injury in all\nfederal actions brought by prisoners. In reaching this conclusion, we cannot escape\nthe unmistakably clear language Congress used: “No Federal civil action may be\nbrought by a prisoner . . . for mental or emotional injury . . . without a prior showing\nof physical injury.” To read this statute to exempt First Amendment claims would\nrequire us to interpret “[n]o Federal civil action” to mean “[n]o Federal civil action\n[except for First Amendment violations].” If Congress desires such a reading of\nsection 1997e(e), Congress can certainly say so. We cannot.\n\n        Royal’s second argument is his claim does not involve mental or emotional\ninjury, so the PLRA should not limit his recovery rights. Royal apparently contends\nother types of recovery are available to him. To the extent Royal argues nominal\ndamages, punitive damages, and injunctive and declaratory relief are available to him,\nwe agree.

Faithfully following the PLRA, the district court\nappropriately awarded Royal $1.00 in nominal damages for Royal’s First Amendment\nviolation. Royal may not recover some indescribable and indefinite damage allegedly\narising from a violation of his constitutional rights. See, e.g., Stachura, 477 U.S. at\n308 n.11 (stating “nominal damages, and not damages based on some undefinable\n‘value’ of infringed rights, are the appropriate means of ‘vindicating’ rights whose\ndeprivation has not caused actual, provable injury”); Carey v.

Citing Trobaugh, Royal\nseemingly seeks damages for each day he wrongfully spent in segregation, a loss of\nliberty injury. In Trobaugh, a prisoner filed a section 1983 suit for being placed in\nsegregation for exercising his First Amendment rights. Trobaugh, 176 F.3d at 1088.\nThe district court found the prisoner’s First Amendment rights had been violated, and\nawarded him $1.00 as nominal damages. Id. On appeal, our court concluded the\ndistrict court’s “compensatory damage award was patently insufficient to compensate\n[the prisoner] for the injury he suffered by being placed in segregation in retaliation\nfor exercising his constitutional right.” Id. at 1089. Remanding the case for a new\ndamages award, the court stated an “appropriate amount . . . would be in the vicinity\nof $100 per day for each [day] spent in administrative segregation.” Id. Trobaugh\ndoes not control Royal’s case, because the Trobaugh court did not confront the\nPLRA’s limitation on recovery in prisoner suits. The Trobaugh court also did not\ndiscuss what injury the $100 per day compensated. Nor did the court explain how it\narrived at $100 per day as an “appropriate” damage assessment. Finally, the\nTrobaugh court did not discuss whether the prisoner had been released from prison,\nwhich would have taken his case outside of section 1997e(e), had it even applied.\nBecause the Trobaugh court was not limited by the PLRA, as we are in this case, we\ndecline to extend the holding from Trobaugh to cover a damage award subject to the\nPLRA’s limitations.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f       C.     Punitive Damages\n       A factfinder may assess punitive damages in a section 1983 action when a\n“defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it\ninvolves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.”\nWade, 461 U.S. at 56. If a district court finds a defendant’s conduct meets the\nthreshold for awarding punitive damages, the court should then consider the two\npurposes of punitive damages: (1) punish willful or malicious conduct; and (2) deter\nfuture unlawful conduct. Coleman v. Rahija, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741122\"><a href=\"/opinion/741122/gloria-coleman-v-nurse-ruth-rahija-nurse-at-imcc-oakdale/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 787 (8th Cir. 1997). An\nappellate court should not lightly reverse a district court’s decision to award–or not\nto award–punitive damages in a section 1983 case. Because a district court’s decision\nto award punitive damages involves “a discretionary moral judgment,” we empower\na district court with enough discretion to make its proper judgment call without fear\nof inappropriate appellate intervention. Id.; Taylor v. Howe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776610\"><a href=\"/opinion/776610/willie-taylor-derrick-marshall-latesa-calloway-mary-darlen-holmes-lasaundra/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1212\n(8th Cir. 2002) (holding district court’s decision not to award punitive damages was\nnot an abuse of discretion because “the Court’s action [was not] so far out of bounds\nas to justify appellate intervention”). We reverse only when we are convinced the\ndecision to award–or not to award–punitive damages constitutes an abuse of\ndiscretion. Coleman, 114 F.3d at 787-88.\n\n        Given the highly deferential standard of review, we find no reversible error for\nthree reasons. First, the district court accurately stated and applied the appropriate\nlegal standard on punitive damages. Second, the district court’s factual findings were\nnot clearly erroneous. As the factfinder, the district court found no “evil motive” or\n“reckless or callous indifference” in Reid’s actions. Instead, the district court found\nReid acted, in part, out of frustration and a concern to protect his staff from Royal’s\nabuse. Third, the district court concluded the purposes behind punitive damages\nwould not be advanced in this case. The district court noted Reid’s retirement\nweighed against awarding punitive damages, because a punitive damages award\nwould not deter Reid’s future conduct. The district court also concluded punitive\ndamages were unnecessary to deter others. This conclusion is buttressed by the\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdistrict court finding Reid’s conduct violated the First Amendment, of which every\nIMCC employee should be made aware.\n\n      Royal contends Trobaugh also controls the punitive damages issue. However,\nthe court in Trobaugh did not hold the district court abused its discretion by not\nawarding punitive damages. Instead, the court held the district court abused its\ndiscretion by awarding only $1.00 for nominal damages. Trobaugh, 176 F.3d at\n1088-89. Since the court reversed the district court on the nominal damages award\nand remanded for reconsideration, the court asked the district court to reconsider its\ndecision not to award punitive damages. Id. at 1089. Indeed, the district court\nrefused to award punitive damages upon remand. We conclude Trobaugh does not\nrequire us to reverse the district court’s decision not to award punitive damages.\n\n        Because the district court applied the correct legal standard, and exercised its\ndiscretion in denying punitive damages, we refuse to second-guess the district court’s\ndecision. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in not awarding\npunitive damages to Royal.\n\n      D.   Attorney Fees\n      The PLRA places the following limitation on awards of attorney fees:\n\n      Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action [brought by a\n      prisoner in which attorney fees are authorized], a portion of the\n      judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the\n      amount of attorney[] fees awarded against the defendant. If the award\n      of attorney[] fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the\n      excess shall be paid by the defendant.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(2). Although awkwardly worded, the PLRA allows an award\nof attorney fees for 150 percent of the damages award.\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f       Royal contends the PLRA’s attorney fees limitation violates his constitutional\nrights. Based on settled Eighth Circuit precedent, the district court rejected Royal’s\nconstitutional attack and awarded attorney fees in the amount of $1.50 (i.e., 150\npercent of the $1.00 monetary judgment).\n\n       On appeal, Royal recognizes Eighth Circuit precedent controls the issue of the\nconstitutionality of the PLRA’s attorney fee limitation. We agree. In Foulk, 262 F.3d\nat 704, our circuit joined other circuits in holding “the PLRA’s attorney[] fees cap\npasses constitutional muster.” See Robinson v. Hager, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777892\"><a href=\"/opinion/777892/willie-robinson-appelleecross-appellant-v-deborah-hager-rick-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563 n.2 (8th\nCir. 2002) (following Foulk “because this circuit has already upheld the\nconstitutionality of the PLRA, and because a panel cannot overturn another panel’s\ndecision”). In deciding the PLRA’s attorney fee limitation was constitutional, our\ncourt recognized “we are not authorized to act as a superlegislature to judge the\nwisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations made in areas that neither\naffect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines. Moreover, our role is not\nto judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices.” Foulk, 262 F.3d at 704\n(quoting Walker v. Bain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774061\"><a href=\"/opinion/774061/william-h-walker-jr-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-99-2004-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 670 (6th Cir. 2001)).\n\n       Notwithstanding our circuit’s binding decision upholding the PLRA’s\nlimitation on attorney fees, Royal wishes to await this panel’s decision and seek en\nbanc review to overrule Foulk. Agreeing with the district court’s decision to limit\nattorney fees to 150 percent of the damages award, we affirm the district court’s\naward of $1.50 in attorney fees.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s judgment in Royal’s\nfavor, including its decision to award $1.00 in nominal damages and not to award\npunitive damages. We also affirm the district court’s order limiting the attorney fees\naward to $1.50, or 150 percent of the damages award.\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fHEANEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       Based on court precedent, the language of the physical injury requirement, and\nthe legislative history of the Prison Litigation Reform Act ( PLRA), I disagree with\nthe majority’s holding that 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) bars compensatory damages for\nviolations of the First Amendment, and therefore, respectfully dissent.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Jeff Royal was convicted of “cattle rustling” and sentenced on August 10,\n1998, to a term of five years in the Iowa Department of Corrections system. Prior to\nhis conviction, Royal fell through a haymow and suffered a spinal cord injury\nrequiring him to use a wheelchair. Royal was initially sent to the Iowa Medical and\nClassification Center (IMCC) and assigned to the general population. Royal became\ndissatisfied with the medical treatment he received and filed a pro se complaint on\nSeptember 10, 1998. His complaint included allegations that: 1) he could not turn his\nwheelchair in his cell; 2) he was unable to get to the toilet or shower; 3) he had blood\nin his catheter but no action was taken by medical staff because he did not have an\nelevated temperature; 4) he was transferred in a van that was not handicapped\naccessible, requiring him to fall to the floor before pulling himself onto the van’s seat;\n5) he had to fall on the ground and pull himself up onto a shower chair in order to\nshower; 6) he had to lay on the floor after using the toilet to pull on his prison-issue\njumpsuit, and his request to wear pants instead of a jumpsuit was denied; and 7) his\nrequests for an enema were delayed - once for ten days and once for six days. Royal’s\nrequest for the assistance of counsel was granted on September 29, 1998.\n\n       In October of 1998, the IMCC medical director decided that Royal did not need\nhis analgesics and confiscated his wheelchair. Royal complained that the crutches he\nwas expected to use caused him pain and tingling in his hands and that the health\nservice unit was far away, making it difficult for him to show up for his periodic\n\n                                          -10-\n\fexercises. Between November 1998 and January 1999, Royal submitted seventeen\ngrievances in attempt to regain his wheelchair. On December 24, 1998, Royal filed\na preliminary injunction motion to get his wheelchair back. Accompanying the\nmotion was an affidavit in which Royal stated that his leg brace had broken and,\nwithout his wheelchair, he had to crawl on the floor. Royal also asserted in the\naffidavit that when Tom Reid, the IMCC Security Director, was notified that Royal\nhad to crawl on the floor, Reid issued a memorandum stating that any inmate seen\ncrawling on the floor would be subject to discipline.\n\n      On January 12, 1999, prior to the preliminary injunction hearing, Royal had a\nconsultation with a neurosurgeon at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinic. The\ndoctor stated that the use of crutches was putting pressure on Royal’s ulnar nerve and\nrecommended that Royal’s wheelchair be returned to him. The prison authorities\nreturned his wheelchair and the preliminary injunction hearing was cancelled.\n\n       On January 28, 1999, Royal was “written up” after a confrontation with a nurse\nin the health services unit. Shortly thereafter, Royal was removed from the general\npopulation and placed in summary administrative segregation or, “lock up.” Prior to\nbeing placed in segregation, Royal had been rated as above average in adjusting to\nprison work and outstanding in adjusting to his living unit. He remained in\nsegregation until March 25, 1999, when he was transferred to another facility. Royal\nwas paroled in December 1999.\n\n       Royal brought this suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that he was\nretaliated against for exercising his right of access to the courts when he was placed\nin segregation for almost two months.3 The magistrate judge agreed, holding that\nRoyal was placed in segregation in retaliation for filing complaints in violation of his\n\n\n      3\n         This complaint was filed on July 27, 2000. Royal’s amended complaint is a\nretaliation claim and dismisses his original complaints about his medical care.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fFirst Amendment rights. The magistrate judge, however, denied Royal’s claims for\nboth compensatory and punitive damages, awarding Royal $1.00 in nominal damages\nand his attorney $1.50 as 150% of the damages award. Royal now appeals the denial\nof compensatory and punitive damages and the limitation on attorney’s fees.\n\n                   II. PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n       The PLRA was enacted on April 26, 1996, as part of an extensive omnibus\nappropriations bill. Section 1997e(e) of the PLRA is entitled “Limitation on\nrecovery” and states that “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner . .\n. for mental or emotional injury . . . without a prior showing of physical injury.” 42\nU.S.C. § 1997e(e). The physical injury requirement of this provision has been\nlitigated in almost every circuit, with extremely varying results. One of the key\ndisputes is whether the physical injury requirement applies to constitutional claims\nin which physical injuries rarely occur, such as violations of the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments. The majority states in its opinion that the majority of circuits have held\nthat § 1997e(e)’s limitation on damages applies to First Amendment claims. A\nreview of the case law, however, reveals that courts in a majority of the circuits have\neither affirmatively held that § 1997e(e) does not apply to First Amendment claims,\nor have declined to apply the physical injury requirement to such claims.\n\n       In the first circuit court opinion to hold that § 1997e(e) does not apply to First\nAmendment claims regardless of the form of relief sought, the Ninth Circuit in Canell\nv.

July 21, 1999).4\n\n      Only three circuits have definitively held that the PLRA’s physical injury\nrequirement applies to all constitutional claims. In Allah v. Al-Hafeez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770376\"><a href=\"/opinion/770376/michael-malik-allah-minister-khalil-wali-muhammad-michael-malik-allah-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n250 (3d Cir. 2000), the Third Circuit asserted that § 1983 compensatory damages are\ngoverned by general tort-law compensation theory and the plain language of\n§ 1997e(e) makes no distinction between different types of federal action. The Tenth\nCircuit in Searles v. Van Bebber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161091\"><a href=\"/opinion/161091/searles-v-vanbebber/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 876 (10th Cir. 2001), also held that\n\n\n      4\n         The majority cites to Thompson v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776987\"><a href=\"/opinion/776987/louis-thompson-v-j-carter-correctional-officer-clinton-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 2002), and\nasserts that the Second Circuit has held that § 1997e(e) applies to First Amendment\nclaims. Thompson, however, involved § 1997e(e)’s application to an Eighth\nAmendment claim, not a First Amendment claim. District courts in the Second\nCircuit, both before and after Thompson, have recognized that the two claims are\ndistinct and have not applied § 1997e(e) to First Amendment claims such as the one\nbefore us.\n\n                                        -13-\n\f“[t]he plain language of the statute does not permit alteration of its clear damages\nrestrictions on the basis of the underlying rights being asserted,” therefore “[t]he\nstatute limits the remedies available, regardless of the rights asserted, if the only\ninjuries are mental or emotional.” The D.C. Circuit in Davis v. District of Columbia,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184664\"><a href=\"/opinion/184664/davis-michael-lee-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1348 (D.C. Cir. 1998), also held that § 1997e(e) bars compensatory\ndamages for First Amendment claims without physical injury.\n\n       Our court has yet to reach this issue. We are, however, faced with an intra-\ncircuit split: two district courts have considered the applicability of § 1997e(e) to\nconstitutional claims and have reached opposite results. In Mason v. Schriro, 45 F.\nSupp. 2d 709, 719 (W.D. Mo. 1999), the court held that § 1997e(e) did not prevent\nthe plaintiff from recovering damages for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause such actions are not brought for mental or emotional injury. The court in\nTodd v. Graves, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2484855\"><a href=\"/opinion/2484855/todd-v-graves/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 961 (S.D. Iowa 2002), however, declined to\nfollow Mason and held that § 1997e(e) barred recovery of compensatory damages for\nviolations of Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n       Absent guidance from our circuit, I look to the statute itself to determine if it\nwas intended to limit constitutional claims. When interpreting a statute, a court\nshould always begin with the plain meaning of the statute. Dowd v. United Steel\nWorkers of Am., Local No. 286, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773684\"><a href=\"/opinion/773684/stanley-d-dowd-and-richard-brown-jr-v-united-steelworkers-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1099 (8th Cir. 2001). If the plain\nlanguage of the statute is unambiguous, the judicial inquiry ends. Id. Courts\ninterpreting the plain language of § 1997e(e), however, have reached differing results\nwhich leads me to the conclusion that the language is neither plain nor unambiguous.\n\n       Some courts read § 1997e(e) and focus on the language “for mental or\nemotional injury.” These courts have generally held that § 1997e(e) does not apply\nto First Amendment claims reasoning that First Amendment claims are not claims for\nmental or emotional injury, but are for violations of intangible and invaluable rights\nwhose deprivation is an injury in and of itself.\n\n                                         -14-\n\f       Other courts, however, focus on the statute’s “no Federal civil action”\nlanguage. They argue that the use of the word “no” shows Congress’s intent that\nthere not be any exceptions to the physical injury requirement. They reason that, in\norder to receive compensatory damages, the plaintiff must prove a compensable\ninjury which, under general tort-law theory, is limited to physical or emotional injury.\nTherefore, if a claim does not allege a physical injury, as most First Amendment\nclaims do not, yet seeks compensatory damages, the plaintiff must be asserting a\nclaim for mental or emotional damages which would be barred under § 1997e(e).\nOne court, however, focused on this same “plain language” yet reached the opposite\nresult. Amaker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">76798</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7. In that case, the district court held that\n§ 1997e(e) does not apply to First Amendment claims reasoning that if the physical\ninjury requirement applied to all federal civil suits the language “for mental or\nemotional injury” would be superfluous which is “contrary to the well-established\nprinciple that all words in a statute should be read to have meaning.” Id. In other\nwords, “[i]f Congress had intended to apply § 1997e(e)’s restriction to all federal civil\nsuits by prisoners, it could easily have done so simply by dropping the qualifying\nlanguage ‘for mental or emotional injury.’” Id.\n\n       Although many courts, and the majority in this case, have found that the\nlanguage of § 1997e(e) is “unmistakably clear” (ante at 5), based on the current\ncircuit split as to whether § 1997e(e) applies to First Amendment claims, I disagree.\nAccordingly, because the plain language of the statute is ambiguous, I believe we\nmust consider “the purpose, the subject matter and the condition of affairs which led\nto its enactment.” United States v. McAllister, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770319\"><a href=\"/opinion/770319/united-states-v-howard-mcallister/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 986 (8th Cir. 2000)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, “[w]hen the meaning of a statute\nis questionable, it should be given a sensible construction and construed to effectuate\nthe underlying purpose of the law.” Id.\n\n      The legislative history of the PLRA shows a clear legislative intent to decrease\nthe number of frivolous lawsuits filed by inmates. There is nothing in the legislative\n\n                                          -15-\n\fhistory of § 1997e(e), however, to suggest that Congress’s intent was to prevent\nlegitimate constitutional claims simply because the prisoner suffered no physical\ninjury.5 Although the bill was called “far-reaching,” the Senate focused almost\nexclusively on limiting “non-meritorious” and “frivolous” inmate litigation, while\nassuring that the legislation would not prevent legitimate claims and would actually\n“help protect convicted criminals’ constitutional rights.” 141 Cong. Rec. S14317\n(1995) (statement of Sen. Abraham). According to Senator Hatch, the PLRA was\nintended to “help bring relief to a civil justice system overburdened by frivolous\nprisoner lawsuits . . . and will ensure that Federal court orders are limited to\nremedying actual violations of prisoners’ rights.” 141 Cong. Rec. S14418 (1995).\nThe Senators repeatedly stated that legitimate constitutional claims would not be\nprevented. Instead, the legislation was aimed at prisoners who “file free lawsuits in\nresponse to almost any perceived slight or inconvenience.” Id. (statement of Sen.\nKyl). Examples of such frivolous lawsuits presented by the Senators included:\ninadequate locker space; a bad haircut given by a prison barber; the failure of prison\nofficials to invite a prisoner to a pizza party for a departing prison employee; being\nserved chunky instead of creamy peanut butter; being denied the use of a Gameboy\nvideo game; being issued shoes that were a quarter size too big; being served “hacked\n\n\n\n      5\n        To be fair, there is almost nothing in the legislative history as to § 1997e(e)\nat all. According to one scholar, “[n]o aspect of the PLRA received less\ncongressional deliberation than § 1997e(e).” James E. Robertson, Psychological\nInjury and the Prison Litigation Reform Act: A “Not Exactly” Equal Protection\nAnalysis, 37 Harv. J. on Legis. 105, 114 (2000); see also Zehner v. Trigg, 952 F.\nSupp. 1318, 1325 (S.D. Ind. 1997) (“The legislative history contains virtually no\ndiscussion specifically concerning . . . § 1997e(e).”), Benjamin v. Jacobson, 935 F.\nSupp. 332, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“[I]t is worth noting that some believe that [the\nPLRA] which has a far-reaching effect on prison conditions and prisoners’ rights\ndeserved to have been the subject of significant debate. It was not. A single Senate\nhearing before the Judiciary Committee, one substantive House Report, and some\nfloor debate is all we can find.”).\n\n                                         -16-\n\fup” cake for dessert; prison officials throwing out an inmate’s belongings after he\nescaped; and being denied dental floss.\n\n       There is a clear difference between the types of claims listed by Congress and\nhistorically actionable and meritorious claims under the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments. When a plaintiff files suit for a violation of his First Amendment\nrights, his claim is based on a deprivation of an intangible right. Whether his claim\nis valid is not linked to the existence or severity of his mental or emotional anguish.\nCertainly First Amendment violations can result in mental or emotional injury, and\nperhaps even physical injury, but § 1983 claims for First Amendment violations are\nnot brought to redress such injuries. They are brought to redress the actual violation\nof the right. This is supported by the purpose behind the First Amendment. The First\nAmendment “is not concerned with preventing physical abuse by government agents,\nbut rather with the invasion of the ‘sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the\npurpose of the First Amendment to our Constitution to reserve from all official\ncontrol.’” Shaheed-Muhammad, 138 F.Supp at 108 (quoting West Virginia State Bd.\nof Educ. v. Barnette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103870\"><a href=\"/opinion/103870/west-virginia-bd-of-ed-v-barnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (1943)). In addition, First Amendment\nviolations occur at the time of the deprivation, not at a later time when the physical\nor emotional harm manifests. First Amendment rights “are abridged the moment a\nstate silences free speech or prevents a citizen from following the precepts of his\nreligion. While the violation may be accompanied by psychological or even physical\ninjury, the severity of incursion is not necessarily measured in those terms.” Id. at\n101.\n\n       The PLRA has many provisions other than § 1997e(e) which serve to prevent\nfrivolous lawsuits, including frivolous First Amendment suits. The PLRA: 1)\nrequires prisoner-plaintiffs to exhaust all administrative remedies before filing § 1983\nactions; 2) requires prisoner-plaintiffs pay the initial filing fee or make monthly\ninstallment payments from their personal accounts when bringing suits in forma\npauperis (IFP); 3) makes it easier for judges to dismiss malicious or frivolous suits;\n\n                                         -17-\n\f4) prohibits a prisoner from filing a suit IFP after having three previous suits\ndismissed as frivolous, malicious, or failing to state a claim; and 5) allows judges to\nrevoke an inmate’s good time credit as a sanction for filing a malicious claim, filing\na claim solely to harass the defendant, testifying falsely, or presenting false evidence.\nAll of these provisions serve Congress’s intent of decreasing frivolous lawsuits\nwithout effecting the ability of prisoners to vindicate there legitimate constitutional\nclaims. Royal’s ability to withstand all of these hurdles is further proof that his claim\nwas not frivolous and was not they type of claim Congress intended to thwart.\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n       Royal’s claim is not frivolous. As found by the magistrate judge, Royal’s First\nAmendment rights were violated when he was placed in segregation in retaliation for\nexercising his constitutional rights. Based on the language of § 1997e(e), the\n“purpose, subject matter and the condition of affairs which led to its enactment,” and\nthe other significant provisions of the PLRA which serve to put a stop to frivolous\nprisoner litigation, I would find that Royal’s claim for compensatory damages is not\nbarred by § 1997e(e) of the PLRA.\n                        ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f</pre>",
