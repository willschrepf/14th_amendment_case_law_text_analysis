See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2015 WL\n\n9810109, at *16 (D.D.C. Aug. 12, 2015). The Court rejected a number of WashTech’s claims,\n\nbut it did vacate one of the rules due to DHS’s failure to provide notice and comment. See id.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, plaintiff’s motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       WashTech filed its complaint in 2014, which contained nine claims challenging a DHS\n\nprogram that allows F-1 student visa holders to engage in optional practical training (“OPT”)\n\nafter completion of their studies. (See Am. Compl. [ECF No. 20] ¶¶ 155-282.) Counts I-III\n\nattacked the OPT program as a whole, alleging that it was unlawful to allow “students” to remain\n\nin the U.S. and work after they had graduated. (See id. ¶¶ 155-86.) These claims were dismissed\n\fearly in the case, after the Court found that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue them. See Wash.\n\nAlliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 74 F. Supp. 3d 247, 252 (D.D.C.\n\n2014). The remaining six counts attacked a DHS rule promulgated in 2008 that extended the\n\nmaximum OPT period from twelve to twenty-nine months for participants with degrees in\n\nscience, technology, engineering, or math (“STEM”), as well as subsequent amendments to the\n\n2008 Rule. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 186-282.) The Court rejected plaintiff’s claim that DHS\n\nexceeded its statutory authority by issuing the 2008 Rule, which it deemed plaintiff’s “principal\n\nargument.” See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, 2015 WL 9810109, at *8-*13. However,\n\nplaintiff succeeded on its claim that DHS lacked good cause to avoid notice and comment when\n\npromulgating the 2008 Rule. Id. at *15. The Court determined that the appropriate remedy was\n\nto vacate the rule and its subsequent amendments, but it stayed the effect of vacatur for six\n\nmonths to avoid a regulatory gap while DHS subjected the rule to notice and comment. Id. at\n\n*16. 1\n\n         Rather than repromulgate the 2008 Rule in its entirety, DHS opted to enact a similar\n\nreplacement that, inter alia, further extended the maximum STEM OPT period to thirty-six\n\nmonths. See Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F–1 Nonimmigrant Students\n\nWith STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F–1 Students, 81 Fed. Reg. 13,039,\n\n13,040 (Mar. 11, 2016). However, after publishing that proposed rule, DHS received an\n\nunprecedented number of public comments, which prevented it from finalizing the rule prior to\n\nexpiration of the stay of vacatur. See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\n\n\n1\n  Given that result, the Court had no need to address plaintiff’s remaining claims that DHS\narbitrarily and capriciously promulgated the 2008 Rule (Count IV), that DHS violated\nregulations governing incorporation by reference (Count VI), and that DHS’s amendments of the\n2008 Rule were procedurally infirm (Counts VII-VIII). See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers,\n2015 WL 9810109, at *16 n.14.\n                                                 2\n\fHomeland Sec., 2016 WL 308775, at *3 (D.D.C. Jan. 23, 2016). It thus moved for a three-month\n\nextension of the stay, which the Court granted over plaintiff’s opposition. See id. at *5. The\n\nextended stay expired on May 10, 2016, see id., and the following day the replacement rule was\n\nfinalized.\n\n        WashTech appealed a number of the Court’s rulings, including the stay extension, but\n\nbefore the Court of Appeals could issue an opinion, the replacement rule had gone into effect and\n\nthereby mooted the appeal. See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec.,\n\n2016 WL 3041029, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 13, 2016). The Circuit dismissed the appeal and\n\nvacated this Court’s judgment. See id.\n\n        Plaintiff now moves for reimbursement of $465,002.62 in fees, expenses, and costs,\n\nincluding those incurred on appeal. (See Mot. for Attorney Fees [ECF No. 56] at 1.)\n\n\n                                             ANALYSIS\n\n        Under the EAJA, a party seeking a fee award must submit an application showing (1) that\n\nit is a prevailing party, (2) its statutory eligibility to receive an award, and (3) the amount sought,\n\nincluding an itemized statement breaking down that claim for reimbursement. See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2412(d)(1)(B). It must also “allege that the position of the United States was not substantially\n\njustified.” Id. Once that allegation is made, “[t]he burden of establishing that the position of the\n\nUnited States was substantially justified . . . must be shouldered by the Government.” See\n\nScarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 414 (2004) (internal quotations omitted).\n\n        DHS argues both that plaintiff was not a “prevailing party” and that its litigation position\n\nwas “substantially justified.” Alternatively, it argues that if plaintiff is entitled to fees, the award\n\nsought by plaintiff must be reduced to provide reimbursement only for the claim on which\n\nplaintiff prevailed.\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f   A. Prevailing Party\n\n       To be deemed a prevailing party, WashTech must have “succeeded on any significant\n\nissue in litigation which achieve[d] some of the benefit [it] sought in bringing suit.” See\n\nWaterman S.S. Corp. v. Mar. Subsidy Bd., 901 F.2d 1119, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (quoting Tex.\n\nState Teachers Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 791 (1989)) (internal quotations\n\nomitted). More specifically, a plaintiff must do more than trigger a voluntary change in the\n\ndefendant’s conduct, but instead it must achieve a “judicially sanctioned change in the legal\n\nrelationship of the parties.” See Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health\n\n& Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 605 (2001).\n\n       This Court previously found that DHS lacked good cause to bypass required notice-and-\n\ncomment procedures when it promulgated the 2008 Rule. Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers,\n\n2015 WL 9810109, at *15. Because failure to adhere to notice-and-comment requirements “is a\n\nserious procedural deficiency that counsels against remand without vacatur,” the Court ordered\n\nvacatur of the 2008 Rule and its subsequent amendments. See id. at *16. This relief was\n\nspecifically sought in WashTech’s complaint. (See Am. Compl. at 40-41 (seeking a declaration\n\nthat “DHS unlawfully implemented the Rule without notice and comment and that the 2008 OPT\n\nRule is therefore null and void”).) Thus, as DHS repeatedly acknowledged before the Court of\n\nAppeals, WashTech “prevailed on the notice-and-comment [challenge],” because “the 2008 Rule\n\nthat they detested no longer exist[s].” See Oral Argument Recording at 19:53, Wash. Alliance of\n\nTech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Case No. 15-5239 (D.C. Cir. May. 4, 2016); see\n\nalso id. at 35:15 (WashTech has “gotten what they’ve wanted, they’re victorious”). DHS now\n\ntries to backtrack from that concession, arguing that these “off-the-cuff comments . . . could not\n\nspeak for this Court’s past rulings,” which purportedly show that plaintiff did not actually\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fprevail. (See Def.’s Response Br. [ECF No. 62] at 6-7.) The inescapable fact remains, however,\n\nthat DHS’s “off-the-cuff comments” were correct—plaintiff established that DHS committed a\n\nserious procedural violation that justified vacatur of the 2008 Rule. In any sense of the word,\n\nplaintiff “prevailed” on that claim by securing a court-ordered change of the parties’ legal\n\nrelationship. See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605.\n\n       DHS’s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. It points to a number of claims on\n\nwhich it prevailed—rulings that plaintiff subsequently appealed (Def.’s Response Br. at 8-9)—\n\nbut those claims are irrelevant for EAJA purposes. A prevailing party need not win on its central\n\nclaim, let alone every single claim it makes. See Tex. State Teachers Ass’n, 489 U.S. at 790.\n\n       Nor is the analysis altered by the fact that DHS later promulgated a replacement rule,\n\nwhich neutralized the effect of vacatur. Even if an agency later repromulgates the same rule, a\n\nparty prevails when it gains the opportunity to provide comment, as plaintiff did here. See Envtl.\n\nDef. Fund, Inc. v. Reilly, 1 F.3d 1254, 1257 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (“In the real world of the APA, an\n\nopportunity for comment—which the EDF did get—is not to be denigrated.”). This is not a\n\nsituation in which plaintiff achieved some enhanced legal position that “increased the odds of\n\n[its] ultimately securing a real-world benefit.” See Waterman, 901 F.2d at 1123. Rather, the\n\nvacatur of the 2008 Rule and plaintiff’s opportunity to comment on its replacement was itself the\n\n“real-world benefit.” DHS’s replacement rule may have made plaintiff’s victory seem like a\n\nhollow one, but that victory is nonetheless sufficient for EAJA purposes. 2 Cf. Edmonds v. FBI,\n\n\n\n\n2\n  DHS also suggests that WashTech’s position “is most similar to the ‘catalyst theory’ rejected in\nBuckhannon.” (See Def.’s Response Br. at 9.) This argument is baseless. The “catalyst theory”\napplies when an agency takes some voluntary corrective action in response to the filing of a\nlawsuit, prior to a court’s resolution of the suit. See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 601. Here, DHS\ntook no voluntary action prior to the Court’s resolution of the suit against it. The catalyst theory\nis thus plainly inapplicable.\n                                                 5\n\f417 F. 3d 1319, 1323 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (court order requiring expedited processing of FOIA\n\nrequest sufficient to make plaintiff a prevailing party).\n\n       Plaintiff also remains a prevailing party despite the D.C. Circuit’s subsequent finding of\n\nmootness and vacatur of this Court’s judgment. As DHS correctly notes, mootness does not\n\naffect prevailing-party status if the party received concrete relief that “could not be reversed\n\ndespite [the] subsequent finding of mootness.” See Thomas v. Nat’l Sci. Found., 330 F.3d 486,\n\n493 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Here, the Court of Appeals found mootness “because the 2008 Rule is no\n\nlonger in effect,” Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, 2016 WL 3041029, at *1, and the 2008 Rule\n\nis no longer in effect because of this Court’s vacatur and DHS’s promulgation of a new rule. In\n\nother words, the relief that plaintiff received was not (and could not have been) reversed by the\n\nCourt of Appeals, because DHS’s response to that relief made the effect of vacatur permanent.\n\nHaving received concrete relief that could not have been reversed on appeal, plaintiff is a\n\nprevailing party under the EAJA.\n\n\n    B. Substantially Justified\n\n       It is a closer question whether DHS’s position—that it had good cause to bypass notice\n\nand comment—was “substantially justified.” 3 The Supreme Court has defined this phrase to\n\nmean “‘justified in substance or in the main’—that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a\n\nreasonable person.” Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988) (rejecting argument that\n\ngovernment’s position must have been “justified to a high degree”). This does not mean,\n\n\n\n3\n  DHS incorrectly argues that plaintiff waived any argument regarding substantial justification,\nbecause plaintiff’s motion “never discusses this issue.” (Def.’s Response Br. at 10 n.3.) Plaintiff\nwas required only to “allege that the position of the United States was not substantially\njustified.” See 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Because plaintiff did so (Pl.’s Mot.\nat 3), the burden rests with DHS to show that its position was substantially justified. See\nScarborough, 541 U.S. at 414.\n                                                  6\n\fhowever, that attorney’s fees must be denied as long as DHS’s position was non-frivolous. See\n\nid. at 566. Thus, contrary to DHS’s suggestion, the Court’s statement that DHS “advanc[ed] a\n\nnon-frivolous argument” for bypassing notice and comment does not end the analysis. See\n\nWash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, 2016 WL 308775, at *4. Instead, the Court must consider\n\nwhether DHS had a “reasonable basis in law and fact” to argue that it had good cause to bypass\n\nnotice and comment. See Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2.\n\n       Because notice-and-comment rulemaking is the primary means of assuring informed\n\nagency decisions, it is well-established in this Circuit that any exception to the notice-and-\n\ncomment requirement “will be narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.” See New\n\nJersey v. U.S. EPA, 626 F.2d 1038, 1045 (D.C. Cir. 1980); see also Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v.\n\nBlock, 655 F.2d 1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (exceptions “are not ‘escape clauses’ that may be\n\narbitrarily utilized at the agency’s whim”). Notice and comment can only be avoided in truly\n\nexceptional emergency situations, which notably, cannot arise as a result of the agency’s own\n\ndelay. Envtl. Def. Fund, Inc. v. EPA, 716 F.2d 915, 920-21 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Courts have thus\n\nupheld emergency rulemakings where, for instance, the FAA needed to counteract “the threat of\n\nfurther terrorist acts involving aircraft in the aftermath of September 11, 2001,” Jifry v. FAA, 370\n\nF.3d 1174, 1179 (D.C. Cir. 2004), or where “an entire industry and its customers were\n\nimperiled” by an imminent regulatory gap, see Mack Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 93-94\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2012) (discussing Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., 655 F.2d at 1157). At the outset, then, it\n\nshould have been clear to DHS that its good-cause argument faced a significant legal hurdle.\n\n       DHS argued that good cause existed “[b]ecause the Secretary faced an urgent situation in\n\nwhich tens of thousands of specially-educated individuals would have been required to leave this\n\ncountry just as the nation was plummeting into recession—resulting in irreparable harm to\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fcritical sectors of the national economy as well as American universities.” (See Def.’s Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. [ECF No. 27] at 1.) The Court rejected this argument. First, it found that DHS offered\n\nnothing concrete to substantiate its claims of a pending labor shortage, but spoke only in general\n\nterms about the importance of STEM workers to the economy. See Wash. Alliance of Tech.\n\nWorkers, 2015 WL 9810109, at *15. More specifically, DHS did nothing to quantify the\n\neconomic impact of delaying a rule until notice and comment could be completed. See id.\n\nFurthermore, DHS could not show an “emergency” when it had been aware of the problem for\n\nyears and had nonetheless failed to take action. See id. (“Defendant does not explain why it\n\nwaited to initiate proceedings on this issue, and it has not pointed to any changed circumstances\n\nthat made the OPT extension suddenly urgent.”).\n\n       Of course, DHS is correct when it argues that “a position can be [substantially] justified\n\neven though it is not correct.” (See Def.’s Response Br. at 10.) However, given its own delay in\n\ninitiating rulemaking, DHS did not come close to establishing a bona-fide emergency, such that\n\nthe Court could have “reluctantly countenanced” the avoidance of notice and comment. See New\n\nJersey, 626 F.2d at 1045; see also Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. EPA, 703 F.2d 700, 703, 712\n\n(3d Cir. 1983) (agency “failed utterly” to show substantial justification because it could have\n\ncomplied with both notice and comment and a deadline imposed by Executive Order). In this\n\nregard, the Court is guided by the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Environmental Defense Fund, in\n\nwhich the EPA lacked substantial justification to argue that a self-created “emergency” entitled it\n\nto bypass notice and comment. See 716 F.2d at 920-21. 4 The agency had argued that it had no\n\n\n\n4\n  The Court recognizes that Environmental Defense Fund has been abrogated on two points,\nincluding the correct standard for showing substantial justification. See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at\n601-02 (rejecting catalyst theory); Pierce, 487 U.S. at 567 (rejecting D.C. Circuit precedent\nrequiring government to show that its position was “slightly more” than reasonable).\nNonetheless, its discussion of substantial justification remains instructive, because even under\n                                                 8\n\fchoice but to immediately suspend an industry reporting requirement, without notice and\n\ncomment, because the reporting deadline was only a week later. See id. The Court rejected this\n\npurported emergency, holding that the EPA had long planned to do away with the reporting\n\nrequirement, deferring the previous year’s requirement and later stating its intention to eliminate\n\nit altogether. See id. The agency could not then delay action until a week before the reporting\n\ndeadline and then suddenly claim an “emergency.” See id. at 921. Just so here, as DHS\n\nacknowledges that the purported emergency began in 2004, when “the visa numbers allocated for\n\nthe H-1B program were reduced” from 195,000 to 65,000. (See Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. at 43.)\n\nIn fact, the agency’s delay in responding is far longer than the EPA’s eight-month delay in\n\nEnvironmental Defense Fund. See 716 F.2d at 921. It was therefore unreasonable for DHS to\n\nargue, after four years of inaction, that an ongoing labor shortage entitled it to proceed with an\n\nemergency rulemaking.\n\n\n   C. Reasonable Fees and Expenses\n\n       Having concluded that WashTech is eligible to be reimbursed for the “reasonable fees\n\nand expenses of [its] attorneys,” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), the Court must now determine what\n\namount would be reasonable. Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the reasonableness of its\n\nfee request. See Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee, 353 F.3d 962, 970 (D.C. Cir. 2004). It\n\nseeks an award $465,002.62, which represents all fees, expenses, and costs it has incurred in this\n\nmatter, including those incurred in its unsuccessful appeal. (See Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. [ECF No.\n\n56-1].) DHS argues that plaintiff is only entitled to an award that reflects its limited victory, i.e.,\n\nreimbursement for only those fees related to the notice-and-comment claim. (See Def.’s\n\n\nthe correct, less stringent “reasonable” standard, the government would still have failed to meet\nits burden. See Envtl. Def. Fund, 716 F.2d at 921 (finding that “it was not at all reasonable for\nEPA to rely on the good cause exception”) (emphasis added).\n                                                   9\n\fResponse Br. at 12-15.) Plaintiff responds that its claims were so interrelated that it would be\n\nimpossible to distinguish which amounts were spent on that claim, and further, that it is\n\nunnecessary to do so because the unsuccessful claims were merely alternative grounds for\n\nreaching the outcome it ultimately achieved. (See Pl.’s Reply Br. at 8-11.)\n\n       The Supreme Court has made clear that “where the plaintiff achieved only limited\n\nsuccess, the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to\n\nthe results obtained.” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 440 (1983). 5 WashTech prevailed\n\nonly on its notice-and-comment claim. The Court rejected (1) three of its claims challenging the\n\ntwelve-month, post-completion OPT program on standing grounds, see Wash. Alliance of Tech.\n\nWorkers, 74 F. Supp. 3d at 252; and (2) its primary claim that DHS exceeded its statutory\n\nauthority by issuing the 2008 Rule, see Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, 2015 WL 9810109, at\n\n*13. Similarly, the Court later granted DHS’s motion to extend the stay of vacatur, over\n\nplaintiff’s opposition. See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, 2016 WL 308775, at *5. Plaintiff’s\n\nappeal also failed to secure any relief, as it was dismissed as moot in light of DHS’s 2016\n\nreplacement rule. See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, 2016 WL 3041029, at *1. Finally, as\n\ndiscussed (see supra at 5), the vacatur it was awarded did not prevent DHS from promulgating a\n\nreplacement rule that is similar to the 2008 Rule. Thus, there is no question that the award must\n\nbe reduced in light of plaintiff’s limited success in this action.\n\n       The Court finds both of plaintiff’s arguments against a reduction to be unpersuasive.\n\nFirst, it is not true that each of its claims were simply “alternative legal grounds for a desired\n\n\n\n5\n  Although Hensley dealt with an award of fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the standards it\nannounced “are generally applicable in all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of\nfees to a ‘prevailing party.’” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433 n. 7. As discussed, the EAJA awards fees\nto a “prevailing party,” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), and thus, Hensley’s standards are applicable\nhere.\n                                                  10\n\foutcome.” (See Pl.’s Reply Br. at 9 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).) The outcome it\n\nachieved—vacatur of the 2008 Rule, subject to DHS’s later promulgation of a replacement\n\nrule—is far more limited than if the Court had accepted its overarching claim that DHS exceeded\n\nits statutory authority, since DHS could not then have promulgated the replacement rule. By the\n\nsame token, the three claims dismissed for lack of standing challenged the entire OPT program,\n\nnot just the 2008 extension (see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 155-186), so success on those claims would have\n\ncertainly provided greater relief than plaintiff actually achieved.\n\n       Second, plaintiff misreads Hensley when it argues that reduction is only appropriate if its\n\nsuccessful claim “can be easily compartmentalized” from its unsuccessful claims. (See Pl.’s\n\nReply Br. at 9.) Instead, Hensley expressly states that if claims are interrelated and cannot be\n\ncompartmentalized, the Court must consider whether “the expenditure of counsel’s time was\n\nreasonable in relation to the [limited] success achieved.” See 461 U.S. at 436; see also George\n\nHyman Constr. Co. v. Brooks, 963 F.2d 1532, 1537 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (“Hensley does instruct that\n\nif successful and unsuccessful claims [are interrelated], then a court should simply compute the\n\nappropriate fee as a function of degree of success.”); Dickens v. Friendship-Edison P.C.S., 724\n\nF. Supp. 2d 113, 122 (D.D.C. 2010) (reducing one attorney’s fees 50% to reflect plaintiff’s\n\nlimited success). Therefore, to the extent that certain claims are interrelated, the Court will\n\nsimply reduce the award sought to reflect WashTech’s limited success on those claims. See\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436. 6\n\n\n\n\n6\n  That said, WashTech is correct that the Supreme Court has rejected DHS’s proposed method of\nreducing fees—awarding a fraction of fees that consists of the number of successful claims\ndivided by total claims, or 1/9th of the total amount sought here. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435\nn.11. Rather, the appropriate method involves a determination of what percentage of total fees\naccurately reflects plaintiff’s level of success. See id. at 436.\n                                                 11\n\f          There is no difficulty segregating fees related to plaintiff’s appeal and opposition to\n\nDHS’s motion for reconsideration—plaintiff achieved no success in this litigation after the\n\nCourt’s August 12, 2015 Opinion, and therefore, those amounts are not compensable. See\n\nAnthony v. Sullivan, 982 F.2d 586, 589 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (“Hensley says loud and clear that when\n\na party has obtained no favorable results in a particular aspect of a litigation, that party may\n\nreceive no fee for work on that part of the case.”). WashTech also inexplicably seeks\n\nreimbursement for its New Jersey-based attorney traveling to and from Washington to testify\n\nbefore the Senate. (See Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. at 20.) That testimony had no impact whatsoever on\n\nthis litigation, so those amounts will also be denied in full. However, the Court agrees that\n\nplaintiff’s various challenges to the OPT program were interrelated (see Pl.’s Reply Br. at 9), and\n\nthus, true, issue-by-issue compartmentalization of the unsuccessful claims is not feasible. See\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 435 (noting that cases in which issue-by-issue compartmentalization is\n\npossible are “unlikely to arise with great frequency”). Thus, given this situation, the Court must\n\nexercise its “substantial discretion” to fix an award that would be reasonable in light of\n\nWashTech’s lack of success on those challenges. See Comm’r, INS v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 163\n\n(1990).\n\n          In determining what is reasonable, it is noteworthy that the Court rejected plaintiff’s\n\n“principal argument”—that DHS exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the 2008\n\nRule—and it found that plaintiff lacked standing to bring three of its challenges to the OPT\n\nprogram as a whole. Success on any of these claims would have secured far greater relief than\n\nplaintiff ultimately secured (i.e., vacatur of a rule that was replaced in short order, and the\n\nopportunity to offer comment on the replacement rule). The Court also finds that plaintiff, which\n\nbears the burden on this issue, provided scant detail in many of its time entries and block-billed\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\ffor multiple tasks in others. (See, e.g., Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. at 19-20 (attributing 63 hours to\n\nentries labeled only “Supplemental Brief” and 15 hours to a single block-billed entry labeled\n\n“Appendices, SJ Brief, Client calls, emails until 2:30 AM”).) A modest fee reduction is\n\ntherefore appropriate on that basis. See Kennecott Corp. v. EPA, 804 F.2d 763, 767 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1986) (“A fee award may be discounted as a result of poor documentation.”). Finally, some\n\nseven attorneys worked on this matter over time, and as a result, the Court finds that plaintiff’s\n\nfees were unjustifiably high. For instance, it employed three different attorneys to review and\n\nrevise their co-counsel’s brief, which amounted to 26.2 hours of revision of a single filing. (See\n\nEx. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. at 8.) This unnecessary duplication of efforts on many tasks warrants another\n\nmodest reduction. See Role Models Am., Inc., 353 F.3d at 973 (reducing plaintiff’s award by\n\n50% in part because of its attorneys’ duplication of effort).\n\n       Therefore, especially in light of plaintiff’s marginal victory, the Court finds that an award\n\nof 15% of plaintiff’s remaining fees and expenses is appropriate.\n\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED IN PART\n\nand DENIED IN PART.

See id.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, plaintiff’s motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       WashTech filed its complaint in 2014, which contained nine claims challenging a DHS\n\nprogram that allows F-1 student visa holders to engage in optional practical training (“OPT”)\n\nafter completion of their studies. (See Am. Compl. [ECF No. 20] ¶¶ 155-282.) Counts I-III\n\nattacked the OPT program as a whole, alleging that it was unlawful to allow “students” to remain\n\nin the U.S. and work after they had graduated. (See id. ¶¶ 155-86.) These claims were dismissed\n\fearly in the case, after the Court found that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue them. See Wash.\n\nAlliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252 (D.D.C.\n\n2014). The remaining six counts attacked a DHS rule promulgated in 2008 that extended the\n\nmaximum OPT period from twelve to twenty-nine months for participants with degrees in\n\nscience, technology, engineering, or math (“STEM”), as well as subsequent amendments to the\n\n2008 Rule. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 186-282.) The Court rejected plaintiff’s claim that DHS\n\nexceeded its statutory authority by issuing the 2008 Rule, which it deemed plaintiff’s “principal\n\nargument.” See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9810109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8-*13. However,\n\nplaintiff succeeded on its claim that DHS lacked good cause to avoid notice and comment when\n\npromulgating the 2008 Rule. Id. at *15. The Court determined that the appropriate remedy was\n\nto vacate the rule and its subsequent amendments, but it stayed the effect of vacatur for six\n\nmonths to avoid a regulatory gap while DHS subjected the rule to notice and comment. Id. at\n\n*16. 1\n\n         Rather than repromulgate the 2008 Rule in its entirety, DHS opted to enact a similar\n\nreplacement that, inter alia, further extended the maximum STEM OPT period to thirty-six\n\nmonths. See Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F–1 Nonimmigrant Students\n\nWith STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F–1 Students, 81 Fed. Reg. 13,039,\n\n13,040 (Mar. 11, 2016). However, after publishing that proposed rule, DHS received an\n\nunprecedented number of public comments, which prevented it from finalizing the rule prior to\n\nexpiration of the stay of vacatur. See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\n\n\n1\n  Given that result, the Court had no need to address plaintiff’s remaining claims that DHS\narbitrarily and capriciously promulgated the 2008 Rule (Count IV), that DHS violated\nregulations governing incorporation by reference (Count VI), and that DHS’s amendments of the\n2008 Rule were procedurally infirm (Counts VII-VIII).

Because failure to adhere to notice-and-comment requirements “is a\n\nserious procedural deficiency that counsels against remand without vacatur,” the Court ordered\n\nvacatur of the 2008 Rule and its subsequent amendments. See id. at *16. This relief was\n\nspecifically sought in WashTech’s complaint. (See Am. Compl. at 40-41 (seeking a declaration\n\nthat “DHS unlawfully implemented the Rule without notice and comment and that the 2008 OPT\n\nRule is therefore null and void”).) Thus, as DHS repeatedly acknowledged before the Court of\n\nAppeals, WashTech “prevailed on the notice-and-comment [challenge],” because “the 2008 Rule\n\nthat they detested no longer exist[s].” See Oral Argument Recording at 19:53, Wash. Alliance of\n\nTech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Case No. 15-5239 (D.C. Cir. May. 4, 2016); see\n\nalso id. at 35:15 (WashTech has “gotten what they’ve wanted, they’re victorious”). DHS now\n\ntries to backtrack from that concession, arguing that these “off-the-cuff comments . . . could not\n\nspeak for this Court’s past rulings,” which purportedly show that plaintiff did not actually\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fprevail. (See Def.’s Response Br. [ECF No. 62] at 6-7.) The inescapable fact remains, however,\n\nthat DHS’s “off-the-cuff comments” were correct—plaintiff established that DHS committed a\n\nserious procedural violation that justified vacatur of the 2008 Rule. In any sense of the word,\n\nplaintiff “prevailed” on that claim by securing a court-ordered change of the parties’ legal\n\nrelationship. See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605.\n\n       DHS’s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. It points to a number of claims on\n\nwhich it prevailed—rulings that plaintiff subsequently appealed (Def.’s Response Br. at 8-9)—\n\nbut those claims are irrelevant for EAJA purposes. A prevailing party need not win on its central\n\nclaim, let alone every single claim it makes. See Tex. State Teachers Ass’n, 489 U.S. at 790.\n\n       Nor is the analysis altered by the fact that DHS later promulgated a replacement rule,\n\nwhich neutralized the effect of vacatur. Even if an agency later repromulgates the same rule, a\n\nparty prevails when it gains the opportunity to provide comment, as plaintiff did here. See Envtl.\n\nDef. Fund, Inc. v.

Rather, the\n\nvacatur of the 2008 Rule and plaintiff’s opportunity to comment on its replacement was itself the\n\n“real-world benefit.” DHS’s replacement rule may have made plaintiff’s victory seem like a\n\nhollow one, but that victory is nonetheless sufficient for EAJA purposes. 2 Cf. Edmonds v. FBI,\n\n\n\n\n2\n  DHS also suggests that WashTech’s position “is most similar to the ‘catalyst theory’ rejected in\nBuckhannon.” (See Def.’s Response Br. at 9.) This argument is baseless. The “catalyst theory”\napplies when an agency takes some voluntary corrective action in response to the filing of a\nlawsuit, prior to a court’s resolution of the suit. See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 601. Here, DHS\ntook no voluntary action prior to the Court’s resolution of the suit against it. The catalyst theory\nis thus plainly inapplicable.\n                                                 5\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1323 (D.C.

In\n\nother words, the relief that plaintiff received was not (and could not have been) reversed by the\n\nCourt of Appeals, because DHS’s response to that relief made the effect of vacatur permanent.\n\nHaving received concrete relief that could not have been reversed on appeal, plaintiff is a\n\nprevailing party under the EAJA.\n\n\n    B. Substantially Justified\n\n       It is a closer question whether DHS’s position—that it had good cause to bypass notice\n\nand comment—was “substantially justified.” 3 The Supreme Court has defined this phrase to\n\nmean “‘justified in substance or in the main’—that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a\n\nreasonable person.” Pierce v. Underwood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112137\"><a href=\"/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565 (1988) (rejecting argument that\n\ngovernment’s position must have been “justified to a high degree”). This does not mean,\n\n\n\n3\n  DHS incorrectly argues that plaintiff waived any argument regarding substantial justification,\nbecause plaintiff’s motion “never discusses this issue.” (Def.’s Response Br. at 10 n.3.) Plaintiff\nwas required only to “allege that the position of the United States was not substantially\njustified.” See 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Because plaintiff did so (Pl.’s Mot.\nat 3), the burden rests with DHS to show that its position was substantially justified. See\nScarborough, 541 U.S. at 414.\n                                                  6\n\fhowever, that attorney’s fees must be denied as long as DHS’s position was non-frivolous. See\n\nid. at 566.

Cir. 2012) (discussing Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., 655 F.2d at 1157). At the outset, then, it\n\nshould have been clear to DHS that its good-cause argument faced a significant legal hurdle.\n\n       DHS argued that good cause existed “[b]ecause the Secretary faced an urgent situation in\n\nwhich tens of thousands of specially-educated individuals would have been required to leave this\n\ncountry just as the nation was plummeting into recession—resulting in irreparable harm to\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fcritical sectors of the national economy as well as American universities.” (See Def.’s Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. [ECF No. 27] at 1.) The Court rejected this argument. First, it found that DHS offered\n\nnothing concrete to substantiate its claims of a pending labor shortage, but spoke only in general\n\nterms about the importance of STEM workers to the economy. See Wash. Alliance of Tech.\n\nWorkers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9810109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *15. More specifically, DHS did nothing to quantify the\n\neconomic impact of delaying a rule until notice and comment could be completed. See id.\n\nFurthermore, DHS could not show an “emergency” when it had been aware of the problem for\n\nyears and had nonetheless failed to take action. See id. (“Defendant does not explain why it\n\nwaited to initiate proceedings on this issue, and it has not pointed to any changed circumstances\n\nthat made the OPT extension suddenly urgent.”).\n\n       Of course, DHS is correct when it argues that “a position can be [substantially] justified\n\neven though it is not correct.” (See Def.’s Response Br. at 10.) However, given its own delay in\n\ninitiating rulemaking, DHS did not come close to establishing a bona-fide emergency, such that\n\nthe Court could have “reluctantly countenanced” the avoidance of notice and comment. See New\n\nJersey, 626 F.2d at 1045; see also Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416453\"><a href=\"/opinion/416453/natural-resources-defense-council-inc-v-us-environmental-protection/\"><span class=\"volume\">703</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 703, 712\n\n(3d Cir. 1983) (agency “failed utterly” to show substantial justification because it could have\n\ncomplied with both notice and comment and a deadline imposed by Executive Order). In this\n\nregard, the Court is guided by the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Environmental Defense Fund, in\n\nwhich the EPA lacked substantial justification to argue that a self-created “emergency” entitled it\n\nto bypass notice and comment. See 716 F.2d at 920-21. 4 The agency had argued that it had no\n\n\n\n4\n  The Court recognizes that Environmental Defense Fund has been abrogated on two points,\nincluding the correct standard for showing substantial justification. See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at\n601-02 (rejecting catalyst theory); Pierce, 487 U.S. at 567 (rejecting D.C. Circuit precedent\nrequiring government to show that its position was “slightly more” than reasonable).\nNonetheless, its discussion of substantial justification remains instructive, because even under\n                                                 8\n\fchoice but to immediately suspend an industry reporting requirement, without notice and\n\ncomment, because the reporting deadline was only a week later. See id. The Court rejected this\n\npurported emergency, holding that the EPA had long planned to do away with the reporting\n\nrequirement, deferring the previous year’s requirement and later stating its intention to eliminate\n\nit altogether. See id. The agency could not then delay action until a week before the reporting\n\ndeadline and then suddenly claim an “emergency.” See id. at 921. Just so here, as DHS\n\nacknowledges that the purported emergency began in 2004, when “the visa numbers allocated for\n\nthe H-1B program were reduced” from 195,000 to 65,000. (See Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. at 43.)\n\nIn fact, the agency’s delay in responding is far longer than the EPA’s eight-month delay in\n\nEnvironmental Defense Fund. See 716 F.2d at 921. It was therefore unreasonable for DHS to\n\nargue, after four years of inaction, that an ongoing labor shortage entitled it to proceed with an\n\nemergency rulemaking.\n\n\n   C. Reasonable Fees and Expenses\n\n       Having concluded that WashTech is eligible to be reimbursed for the “reasonable fees\n\nand expenses of [its] attorneys,” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(b), the Court must now determine what\n\namount would be reasonable. Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the reasonableness of its\n\nfee request. See Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186116\"><a href=\"/opinion/186116/role-models-amer-inc-v-white-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970 (D.C. Cir. 2004). It\n\nseeks an award $465,002.62, which represents all fees, expenses, and costs it has incurred in this\n\nmatter, including those incurred in its unsuccessful appeal. (See Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. [ECF No.\n\n56-1].) DHS argues that plaintiff is only entitled to an award that reflects its limited victory, i.e.,\n\nreimbursement for only those fees related to the notice-and-comment claim. (See Def.’s\n\n\nthe correct, less stringent “reasonable” standard, the government would still have failed to meet\nits burden. See Envtl. Def. Fund, 716 F.2d at 921 (finding that “it was not at all reasonable for\nEPA to rely on the good cause exception”) (emphasis added).\n                                                   9\n\fResponse Br. at 12-15.) Plaintiff responds that its claims were so interrelated that it would be\n\nimpossible to distinguish which amounts were spent on that claim, and further, that it is\n\nunnecessary to do so because the unsuccessful claims were merely alternative grounds for\n\nreaching the outcome it ultimately achieved. (See Pl.’s Reply Br. at 8-11.)\n\n       The Supreme Court has made clear that “where the plaintiff achieved only limited\n\nsuccess, the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to\n\nthe results obtained.” Hensley v. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440 (1983). 5 WashTech prevailed\n\nonly on its notice-and-comment claim. The Court rejected (1) three of its claims challenging the\n\ntwelve-month, post-completion OPT program on standing grounds, see Wash. Alliance of Tech.\n\nWorkers, 74 F. Supp. 3d at 252; and (2) its primary claim that DHS exceeded its statutory\n\nauthority by issuing the 2008 Rule, see Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9810109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*13. Similarly, the Court later granted DHS’s motion to extend the stay of vacatur, over\n\nplaintiff’s opposition. See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">308775</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. Plaintiff’s\n\nappeal also failed to secure any relief, as it was dismissed as moot in light of DHS’s 2016\n\nreplacement rule. See Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3041029</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1. Finally, as\n\ndiscussed (see supra at 5), the vacatur it was awarded did not prevent DHS from promulgating a\n\nreplacement rule that is similar to the 2008 Rule. Thus, there is no question that the award must\n\nbe reduced in light of plaintiff’s limited success in this action.\n\n       The Court finds both of plaintiff’s arguments against a reduction to be unpersuasive.\n\nFirst, it is not true that each of its claims were simply “alternative legal grounds for a desired\n\n\n\n5\n  Although Hensley dealt with an award of fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the standards it\nannounced “are generally applicable in all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of\nfees to a ‘prevailing party.’” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433 n. 7. As discussed, the EAJA awards fees\nto a “prevailing party,” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), and thus, Hensley’s standards are applicable\nhere.\n                                                  10\n\foutcome.” (See Pl.’s Reply Br. at 9 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).) The outcome it\n\nachieved—vacatur of the 2008 Rule, subject to DHS’s later promulgation of a replacement\n\nrule—is far more limited than if the Court had accepted its overarching claim that DHS exceeded\n\nits statutory authority, since DHS could not then have promulgated the replacement rule. By the\n\nsame token, the three claims dismissed for lack of standing challenged the entire OPT program,\n\nnot just the 2008 extension (see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 155-186), so success on those claims would have\n\ncertainly provided greater relief than plaintiff actually achieved.\n\n       Second, plaintiff misreads Hensley when it argues that reduction is only appropriate if its\n\nsuccessful claim “can be easily compartmentalized” from its unsuccessful claims. (See Pl.’s\n\nReply Br. at 9.) Instead, Hensley expressly states that if claims are interrelated and cannot be\n\ncompartmentalized, the Court must consider whether “the expenditure of counsel’s time was\n\nreasonable in relation to the [limited] success achieved.” See 461 U.S. at 436; see also George\n\nHyman Constr. Co. v. Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583563\"><a href=\"/opinion/583563/the-george-hyman-construction-company-v-james-e-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1537 (D.C.

Therefore, to the extent that certain claims are interrelated, the Court will\n\nsimply reduce the award sought to reflect WashTech’s limited success on those claims. See\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436. 6\n\n\n\n\n6\n  That said, WashTech is correct that the Supreme Court has rejected DHS’s proposed method of\nreducing fees—awarding a fraction of fees that consists of the number of successful claims\ndivided by total claims, or 1/9th of the total amount sought here. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435\nn.11. Rather, the appropriate method involves a determination of what percentage of total fees\naccurately reflects plaintiff’s level of success. See id. at 436.\n                                                 11\n\f          There is no difficulty segregating fees related to plaintiff’s appeal and opposition to\n\nDHS’s motion for reconsideration—plaintiff achieved no success in this litigation after the\n\nCourt’s August 12, 2015 Opinion, and therefore, those amounts are not compensable. See\n\nAnthony v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597405\"><a href=\"/opinion/597405/grant-anthony-v-louis-w-sullivan-md-secretary-us-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (“Hensley says loud and clear that when\n\na party has obtained no favorable results in a particular aspect of a litigation, that party may\n\nreceive no fee for work on that part of the case.”). WashTech also inexplicably seeks\n\nreimbursement for its New Jersey-based attorney traveling to and from Washington to testify\n\nbefore the Senate. (See Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. at 20.) That testimony had no impact whatsoever on\n\nthis litigation, so those amounts will also be denied in full. However, the Court agrees that\n\nplaintiff’s various challenges to the OPT program were interrelated (see Pl.’s Reply Br. at 9), and\n\nthus, true, issue-by-issue compartmentalization of the unsuccessful claims is not feasible. See\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 435 (noting that cases in which issue-by-issue compartmentalization is\n\npossible are “unlikely to arise with great frequency”). Thus, given this situation, the Court must\n\nexercise its “substantial discretion” to fix an award that would be reasonable in light of\n\nWashTech’s lack of success on those challenges. See Comm’r, INS v. Jean, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112449\"><a href=\"/opinion/112449/commissioner-ins-v-jean/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163\n\n(1990).\n\n          In determining what is reasonable, it is noteworthy that the Court rejected plaintiff’s\n\n“principal argument”—that DHS exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the 2008\n\nRule—and it found that plaintiff lacked standing to bring three of its challenges to the OPT\n\nprogram as a whole. Success on any of these claims would have secured far greater relief than\n\nplaintiff ultimately secured (i.e., vacatur of a rule that was replaced in short order, and the\n\nopportunity to offer comment on the replacement rule). The Court also finds that plaintiff, which\n\nbears the burden on this issue, provided scant detail in many of its time entries and block-billed\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\ffor multiple tasks in others. (See, e.g., Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. at 19-20 (attributing 63 hours to\n\nentries labeled only “Supplemental Brief” and 15 hours to a single block-billed entry labeled\n\n“Appendices, SJ Brief, Client calls, emails until 2:30 AM”).) A modest fee reduction is\n\ntherefore appropriate on that basis. See Kennecott Corp. v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"478942\"><a href=\"/opinion/478942/kennecott-corporation-v-environmental-protection-agency-asarco/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1986) (“A fee award may be discounted as a result of poor documentation.”). Finally, some\n\nseven attorneys worked on this matter over time, and as a result, the Court finds that plaintiff’s\n\nfees were unjustifiably high. For instance, it employed three different attorneys to review and\n\nrevise their co-counsel’s brief, which amounted to 26.2 hours of revision of a single filing. (See\n\nEx. 1 to Pl.’s Mot. at 8.) This unnecessary duplication of efforts on many tasks warrants another\n\nmodest reduction. See Role Models Am., Inc., 353 F.3d at 973 (reducing plaintiff’s award by\n\n50% in part because of its attorneys’ duplication of effort).\n\n       Therefore, especially in light of plaintiff’s marginal victory, the Court finds that an award\n\nof 15% of plaintiff’s remaining fees and expenses is appropriate.\n\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED IN PART\n\nand DENIED IN PART. DHS shall reimburse plaintiff for 15% of its fees and expenses\n\nincurred prejudgment, which as detailed in the attached Appendix amounts to $42,239.59. A\n\nseparate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                      /s/ Ellen Segal Huvelle\n                                                      ELLEN SEGAL HUVELLE\n                                                      United States District Judge\n\n\nDate: August 8, 2016\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f                                      APPENDIX\n\nPre-Judgment Claims (incurred on or before the date of the Court’s 8/12/15 Opinion)\n\nFees:\n\nAttorney JMM (2010):       80 hours x $177.50/hour =     $14,200.00\nAttorney JMM (2011):       112 hours x $183.75/hour =    $20,580.00\nAttorney JMM (2012):       209 hours x $187.50/hour =    $39,187.50\nAttorney JMM (2013):       33 hours x $191.25/hour =     $6,311.25\nAttorney JMM (2014):       368 hours x $193.75/hour =    $71,300.00\nAttorney JMM (2015):       481 hours x $193.94/hour =    $93,285.14\nAttorney GRR (2010):       6 hours x $177.50/hour =      $1,065.00\nAttorney GRR (2011):       9.6 hours x $183.75/hour =    $1,764.00\nAttorney GRR (2012):       2.1 hours x $187.50/hour =    $393.75\nAttorney GRR (2013):       2.2 hours x $191.25/hour =    $420.75\nAttorney GRR (2014):       36.8 hours x $193.75/hour =   $7,130.00\nAttorney GRR (2015):       15.5 hours x $193.94/hour =   $3,006.07\nAttorney MMH (2011):       3 hours x 183.75/hour =       $551.25\nAttorney MMH (2014):       8.4 hours x 193.75/hour =     $1,627.50\nAttorney MMH (2015):       17.3 hours x 193.94/hour =    $3,355.16\nAttorney MM (2011):        9 hours x $183.75/hour =      $1,653.75\nAttorney MM (2012):        10 hours x $187.50/hour =     $1,875.00\nAttorney DLW (2014):       24.3 hours x $193.75/hour =   $4,708.13\nAttorney DLW (2015):       33.6 hours x $193.94/hour =   $6,516.38\n\n                                                         $278,930.63\n                                                              x 15%\n\n                                                         $41,839.59\n\nExpenses and Costs:\n\nComplaint Filing Fee:                                    $400.00\n\nTOTAL AWARD:                                             $42,239.59\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f</pre>",
