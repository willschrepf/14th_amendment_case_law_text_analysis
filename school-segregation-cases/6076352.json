See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 21.11(a)(1) (West 2014).\n\nBecause there is no reversible error, but also because the parties agree to reform the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment, the trial court’s judgment is affirmed as reformed.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n       Steinmann lived with Heather and her daughter, H.P. One morning, Steinmann\n\fwoke up Heather to tell her he was having a dream about touching H.P. and found\n\nhimself actually touching H.P. H.P. confirmed that Steinmann inappropriately touched\n\nher. After the police were contacted, an interview of H.P. was scheduled at the child\n\nadvocacy center. Steinmann encouraged Heather to have H.P. blame someone else for\n\nthe incident. On the way to the interview, Heather told H.P. to lie about who touched\n\nher, which H.P. did. When Heather’s mother discovered what happened, she called the\n\npolice to schedule another interview of H.P. At this interview, H.P. revealed Steinmann\n\nhad touched her.\n\nJAIL CALL RECORDING\n\n       Steinmann first complains that the trial court erred in admitting State’s Exhibit 2,\n\na recording of a jail call between Heather and Steinmann.          On appeal, Steinmann\n\nspecifically contends that the parts of the conversation regarding Heather’s troubles with\n\nher mother were irrelevant and hearsay and the probative value of those statements were\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. At trial, Steinmann\n\nspecifically pointed out parts of the call that were objectionable to him, and those\n\nobjectionable portions were redacted from the recording. Although he still objected to\n\nthe admission of the recording, after the redactions, Steinmann did not specifically point\n\nout any other portions of the call that were objectionable.\n\n       On this record, we hold that Steinmann's trial objections were insufficient to\n\npreserve any error in the admission of any portion of the jail call recording because, after\n\n\n\nSteinmann v. State                                                                    Page 2\n\fthe redactions, Steinmann’s objections did not specifically point out which portions of the\n\nrecording were inadmissible. See Whitaker v. State, 286 S.W.3d 355, 369 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2009). While it might be conceded that Steinmann's objections sufficiently stated the\n\ngrounds for the objections, they did not specifically identify what portions of the\n\nrecording to which the stated objections applied. Hernandez v. State, 599 S.W.2d 614, 617\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1980) (op. on reh'g).\n\n       When, as in this case, an exhibit contains both admissible and inadmissible\n\nevidence, the objection must specifically refer to the challenged material to apprise the\n\ntrial court of the precise objection. Sonnier v. State, 913 S.W.2d 511, 518 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1995). The trial court should never be required to sift through challenged evidence to\n\nsegregate admissible evidence from excludable evidence. Jones v. State, 843 S.W.2d 487,\n\n492 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992), abrogated on other grounds by Maxwell v. State, 48 S.W.3d\n\n196 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). In those instances where an exhibit contains both admissible\n\nand inadmissible evidence, a trial court may \"safely admit it all or exclude it all, and the\n\nlosing party, no matter who he is, will be made to suffer on appeal the consequences of\n\nhis insufficiently specific offer or objection.\" Id.; In re M.P., 220 S.W.3d 99, 114 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Waco 2007, pet. denied).\n\n       Accordingly, Steinmann has not preserved anything for our review, and his first\n\nissue is overruled.\n\n\n\n\nSteinmann v. State                                                                    Page 3\n\fADMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPH\n\n       In his second issue, Steinman contends the trial court erred in admitting a\n\nphotograph from a Facebook page because it was not properly authenticated.\n\n       Authentication is a condition precedent to admissibility of evidence. Tienda v.\n\nState, 358 S.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012); see TEX. R. EVID. 901(a). The trial court\n\ndecides the threshold question whether the proponent has supplied sufficient evidence\n\nto support a reasonable jury determination that the proffered evidence is authentic.\n\nTienda, 358 S.W.3d at 638. The trial court need not be persuaded that the proffered item\n\nof evidence is authentic; rather, it must only decide whether the proponent has supplied\n\nfacts sufficient to support a reasonable jury determination that the evidence is authentic.\n\nId.\n\n       We review a trial court's ruling on the preliminary question of admissibility for an\n\nabuse of discretion. Id. We will not interfere with a ruling that a jury could reasonably\n\nfind the proffered evidence is authentic if the ruling is within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. Id.\n\n       To authenticate a photograph, there is no requirement that the individual\n\nauthenticating the photograph was the photographer or was present when the\n\nphotograph was taken or developed. Hughes v. State, 878 S.W.2d 142, 155 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1993) (op. on reh’g). All that is required is testimony that the photograph accurately\n\nrepresents the person, object, or scene depicted in the photograph. See Huffman v. State,\n\n\n\nSteinmann v. State                                                                    Page 4\n\f746 S.W.2d 212, 222 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988); Quinonez-Saa v. State, 860 S.W.2d 704, 706\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993). An objection to photographic evidence is waived\n\nif the same information contained in the photograph is conveyed to the jury in some other\n\nform. Ford v. State, 919 S.W.2d 107, 117 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n\n          Dr. Randy Smith was retained by the State to perform a forensic assessment of\n\nSteinmann to determine a possible explanation for the offense. After the defense rested,\n\nthe State called Smith to testify. During the course of Smith’s testimony, the State sought\n\nto offer a photograph taken allegedly from Steinmann’s Facebook page. Steinmann\n\nobjected to the photograph’s introduction on the basis of improper authentication, among\n\nother reasons.1 After the photograph was admitted, Smith described the photograph as\n\ndepicting Steinmann and H.P. in a “boyfriend/girlfriend” pose and flashing a gang sign\n\nto show solidarity, which, to Smith, suggested an inappropriate relationship between a\n\nparent and child.\n\n          Immediately prior to the introduction of the photograph, the State introduced\n\nSmith’s written assessment of Steinmann. In the report, Smith stated that he saw a\n\nphotograph on Steinmann’s Facebook page which showed Steinmann “in repose with his\n\nstep-daughter enveloped in the crook of his arm.”                 When reviewing the admitted\n\nphotograph, it is clear that Smith was referring to the same photograph in his report.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The other reasons are not discussed by Steinmann on appeal.\n\n\n\nSteinmann v. State                                                                      Page 5\n\fWhile Steinman made other general objections to the report, he did not object to the\n\nportion of the report describing the photograph from Facebook. Thus, Steinmann’s\n\nobjection to the introduction of the photograph into evidence is waived because the\n\ninformation contained in it was conveyed to the jury by Smith’s report.\n\n        Steinmann’s second issue is overruled.\n\nHEARSAY\n\n        Steinmann next argues that the trial court erred when it overruled Steinmann’s\n\nhearsay objection during Detective Jason Earles’s testimony. Specifically, Steinmann\n\ncomplains that the following testimony was hearsay and that the trial court should have\n\nsustained his hearsay objection:\n\n        She said that she had stopped. Her mother was driving the vehicle to the\n        CAC, when they left the … school, and they stopped at a gas station ….\n        [Heather] said that her and her daughter, [H.P.], went inside the gas station\n        in to the bathroom, where [Heather] sat on the toilet and [H.P.] faced the\n        stall door. [Heather] then indicated that she had influenced her daughter to\n        protect her daddy. And –\n\nHowever, Steinmann only objected that this answer was narrative, which the trial court\n\nsustained.2 Steinmann’s complaint on appeal does not comport with the objection made\n\nat trial and has not been preserved for our review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1; Wilson v. State,\n\n71 S.W.3d 346, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). Accordingly, Steinmann’s third issue is\n\n\n\n2\n  Earlier, the State asked Earles about a conversation with Heather as to why she and H.P. were late to the\nfirst interview. As Earles was beginning to answer, Steinmann objected as to hearsay. Steinmann did not\nask for a running objection as to whatever the remainder of Earles’s answer would be.\n\n\n\nSteinmann v. State                                                                                  Page 6\n\foverruled.\n\nCLERICAL MISTAKES\n\n        In his fourth and fifth issues, Steinman contends the trial court's judgment is\n\nincorrect and must be modified to reflect the correct section of the Texas Penal Code of\n\nwhich he was found to have been convicted3 and to reflect the correct date the judgment\n\nwas entered. These deficiencies appear to be clerical mistakes, not errors; nevertheless,\n\nthe State agrees the judgment should be modified.\n\n        We have the authority to correct and reform a judgment when we have the\n\nnecessary data and information to do so. See Banks v. State, 708 S.W.2d 460, 462 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1986); Asberry v. State, 813 S.W.2d 526, 529 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991, pet. ref'd).\n\nAccordingly, we reform the trial court’s judgment as agreed by the parties to reflect:\n\n        1. the date the judgment was entered is 4/7/2016; and\n\n        2. the statute for the offense is 21.11(a)(1) Penal Code.\n\nSteinmann’s fourth and fifth issues are overruled.4\n\n\n\n\n3 We have held many times, most recently in March of this year, that statutory penal provisions are not\nrequired by the Code of Criminal Procedure to be included in the judgment. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC.\nANN. art. 42.01, Sec. 1(13) (West 2006); Sabedra v. State, No. 10-16-00033-CR, 2017 Tex. App. LEXIS 2241, at\n*6 (App.—Waco Mar. 15, 2017).\n\n4\n  As we have said before, rather than an appeal, we note that a more efficient manner of making this type\nof change may be a motion for modification or motion for judgment nunc pro tunc, depending on the\ntiming of the discovery of the issues, filed in the trial court. Kerr v. State, No. 10-15-00113-CR, 2016 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 12082, at *2 n.3 (Tex. App.—Waco Nov. 9, 2016, no pet.) (not designated for publication).\n\n\nSteinmann v.

Crim. App. 1996).\n\n          Dr. Randy Smith was retained by the State to perform a forensic assessment of\n\nSteinmann to determine a possible explanation for the offense. After the defense rested,\n\nthe State called Smith to testify. During the course of Smith’s testimony, the State sought\n\nto offer a photograph taken allegedly from Steinmann’s Facebook page. Steinmann\n\nobjected to the photograph’s introduction on the basis of improper authentication, among\n\nother reasons.1 After the photograph was admitted, Smith described the photograph as\n\ndepicting Steinmann and H.P. in a “boyfriend/girlfriend” pose and flashing a gang sign\n\nto show solidarity, which, to Smith, suggested an inappropriate relationship between a\n\nparent and child.\n\n          Immediately prior to the introduction of the photograph, the State introduced\n\nSmith’s written assessment of Steinmann. In the report, Smith stated that he saw a\n\nphotograph on Steinmann’s Facebook page which showed Steinmann “in repose with his\n\nstep-daughter enveloped in the crook of his arm.”                 When reviewing the admitted\n\nphotograph, it is clear that Smith was referring to the same photograph in his report.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The other reasons are not discussed by Steinmann on appeal.\n\n\n\nSteinmann v. State                                                                      Page 5\n\fWhile Steinman made other general objections to the report, he did not object to the\n\nportion of the report describing the photograph from Facebook. Thus, Steinmann’s\n\nobjection to the introduction of the photograph into evidence is waived because the\n\ninformation contained in it was conveyed to the jury by Smith’s report.\n\n        Steinmann’s second issue is overruled.\n\nHEARSAY\n\n        Steinmann next argues that the trial court erred when it overruled Steinmann’s\n\nhearsay objection during Detective Jason Earles’s testimony. Specifically, Steinmann\n\ncomplains that the following testimony was hearsay and that the trial court should have\n\nsustained his hearsay objection:\n\n        She said that she had stopped. Her mother was driving the vehicle to the\n        CAC, when they left the … school, and they stopped at a gas station ….\n        [Heather] said that her and her daughter, [H.P.], went inside the gas station\n        in to the bathroom, where [Heather] sat on the toilet and [H.P.] faced the\n        stall door. [Heather] then indicated that she had influenced her daughter to\n        protect her daddy. And –\n\nHowever, Steinmann only objected that this answer was narrative, which the trial court\n\nsustained.2 Steinmann’s complaint on appeal does not comport with the objection made\n\nat trial and has not been preserved for our review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1; Wilson v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1662330\"><a href=\"/opinion/1662330/wilson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). Accordingly, Steinmann’s third issue is\n\n\n\n2\n  Earlier, the State asked Earles about a conversation with Heather as to why she and H.P. were late to the\nfirst interview. As Earles was beginning to answer, Steinmann objected as to hearsay. Steinmann did not\nask for a running objection as to whatever the remainder of Earles’s answer would be.\n\n\n\nSteinmann v. State                                                                                  Page 6\n\foverruled.\n\nCLERICAL MISTAKES\n\n        In his fourth and fifth issues, Steinman contends the trial court's judgment is\n\nincorrect and must be modified to reflect the correct section of the Texas Penal Code of\n\nwhich he was found to have been convicted3 and to reflect the correct date the judgment\n\nwas entered. These deficiencies appear to be clerical mistakes, not errors; nevertheless,\n\nthe State agrees the judgment should be modified.\n\n        We have the authority to correct and reform a judgment when we have the\n\nnecessary data and information to do so. See Banks v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1793365\"><a href=\"/opinion/1793365/banks-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462 (Tex.\n\nCrim.

See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC.\nANN. art. 42.01, Sec. 1(13) (West 2006); Sabedra v. State, No. 10-16-00033-CR, 2017 Tex.
