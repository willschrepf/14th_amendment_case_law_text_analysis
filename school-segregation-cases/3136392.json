The law provides that the Attorney General may substitute and certify a more suitable and correct popular name and ballot title, if he can do so, or if the proposed popular name and ballot title are sufficiently misleading, may reject the entire petition.</p>\n<p>A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference> neither requires nor authorizes this office to make legal determinations concerning the merits of the act or amendment, or concerning the likelihood that it will accomplish its stated objective. Consequently, this review has been limited to a determination, pursuant to the guidelines that have been set forth by the Arkansas Supreme Court, discussed below, of whether the proposed popular name and ballot title accurately and impartially summarize the provisions of your proposed amendment.</p>\n<p>The purpose of my review and certification is to ensure that the popular name and ballot title honestly, intelligibly, and fairly set forth the purpose of the proposed amendment. <u>See</u> <em>Arkansas Women's Political Caucus</em><em>v. Riviere,</em> <cross_reference>282 Ark. 463</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>466</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>677 S.W.2d 846</cross_reference> (1984).</p>\n<p>The popular name is primarily a useful legislative device. <em>Pafford v.</em><em>Hall,</em> <cross_reference>217 Ark. 734</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>233 S.W.2d 72</cross_reference> (1950). It need not contain detailed information or include exceptions that might be required of a ballot title, but it must not be misleading or give partisan coloring to the merit of the proposal. <em>Chaney v. Bryant,</em> <cross_reference>259 Ark. 294</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>532 S.W.2d 741</cross_reference>\n(1976); <em>Moore v. Hall,</em> <cross_reference>229 Ark. 411</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>316 S.W.2d 207</cross_reference> (1958). The popular name is to be considered together with the ballot title in determining the ballot title's sufficiency. <u>Id.</u></p>\n<p>The ballot title must include an impartial summary of the proposed amendment that will give the voter a fair understanding of the issues presented. <em>Hoban v. Hall,</em> <cross_reference>229 Ark. 416</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>316 S.W.2d 185</cross_reference> (1958); <em>Becker</em><em>v. Riviere,</em> <cross_reference>270 Ark. 219</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>223</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>226</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>604 S.W.2d 555</cross_reference> (1980). According to the court, if information omitted from the ballot title is an \"essential fact which would give the voter serious ground for reflection, it must be disclosed.\" <em>Bailey v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>318 Ark. 277</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>285</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>884 S.W.2d 938</cross_reference> (1994), citing <em>Finn v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>303 Ark. 418</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>798 S.W.2d 34</cross_reference> (1990); <em>Gaines v.</em><em>McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>296 Ark. 513</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>758 S.W.2d 403</cross_reference> (1988); <em>Hoban v. Hall, supra</em>; and<em>Walton v. McDonald,</em> <cross_reference>192 Ark. 1155</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>97 S.W.2d 81</cross_reference> (1936). At the same time, however, a ballot title must be brief and concise (<u>see</u> A.C.A. &#167;<cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>(b)); otherwise voters could run afoul of A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-5-522</cross_reference>'s five minute limit in voting booths when other voters are waiting in line.<em>Bailey v. McCuen, supra.</em> The ballot title is not required to be perfect, nor is it reasonable to expect the title to cover or anticipate every possible legal argument the proposed measure might evoke. <em>Plugge v.</em><em>McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>310 Ark. 654</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>841 S.W.2d 139</cross_reference> (1992). The title, however, must be free from any misleading tendency, whether by amplification, omission, or fallacy; it must not be tinged with partisan coloring. <u>Id.</u> A ballot title must convey an intelligible idea of the scope and significance of a proposed change in the law. <em>Christian Civic Action Committee v. McCuen,</em><cross_reference>318 Ark. 241</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>884 S.W.2d 605</cross_reference> (1994). It has been stated that the ballot title must be: 1) intelligible, 2) honest, and 3) impartial. <em>Becker v.</em><em>McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>303 Ark. 482</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>798 S.W.2d 71</cross_reference> (1990), citing <em>Leigh v. Hall,</em><cross_reference>232 Ark. 558</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>339 S.W.2d 104</cross_reference> (1960).</p>\n<p>Applying the above precepts, it is my conclusion that a more suitable, complete, and correct popular name and ballot title should be substituted for those proposed. The following is hereby certified in order to insure that, when construed together, the popular name and ballot title accurately set forth the purpose of the proposed amendment:</p>\n<p><center>                             (Popular Name)</center><blockquote>  AN AMENDMENT TO CAP THE SALARIES AND REGULATE THE BENEFITS OF PUBLIC SERVANTS, TO BEGIN THE PRIVATIZATION OF PUBLIC SERVANT RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, TO MODIFY PROCEDURES GOVERNING LAWSUITS TO RECOVER ILLEGAL PUBLIC EXPENDITURES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES</p></blockquote>\n<p><center>                             (Ballot Title)</center><blockquote>  AN AMENDMENT TO THE ARKANSAS CONSTITUTION LIMITING THE SALARIES OF PUBLIC SERVANTS TO $100,000 PER YEAR, AND PROVIDING FRINGE BENEFITS FOR ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS IN THE AMOUNT OF 25% OF DIRECT SALARY;

The ballot title for such a measure must avoid both the danger of being too lengthy and the danger of having serious omissions. More specifically, the title cannot be so lengthy as to cause voters to violate the voting booth time limitations, yet it must not omit any of the proposed measure's important factors. For this reason, I must point out that with any proposed amendment of considerable length and complexity such as yours, the sponsor runs the risk of a challenge and of a finding by the court that the ballot title is unacceptable, either because it is too \"complex, detailed, and lengthy,\" or because it has \"serious omissions.\" <u>See,</u> <u>e.g.</u>,<em>Page v. McCuen,</em> <cross_reference>318 Ark. 342</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>884 S.W.2d 951</cross_reference> (1994).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-9-108</cross_reference>, instructions to canvassers and signers must precede every petition, informing them of the privileges granted by the Constitution and of the penalties imposed for violations of this act.

At the same time, however, a ballot title must be brief and concise (<u>see</u> A.C.A. &#167;<cross_reference>7-9-107</cross_reference>(b)); otherwise voters could run afoul of A.C.A. &#167; <cross_reference>7-5-522</cross_reference>'s five minute limit in voting booths when other voters are waiting in line.<em>Bailey v.

The ballot title for such a measure must avoid both the danger of being too lengthy and the danger of having serious omissions. More specifically, the title cannot be so lengthy as to cause voters to violate the voting booth time limitations, yet it must not omit any of the proposed measure's important factors. For this reason, I must point out that with any proposed amendment of considerable length and complexity such as yours, the sponsor runs the risk of a challenge and of a finding by the court that the ballot title is unacceptable, either because it is too \"complex, detailed, and lengthy,\" or because it has \"serious omissions.\" <u>See,</u> <u>e.g.</u>,<em>Page v.
