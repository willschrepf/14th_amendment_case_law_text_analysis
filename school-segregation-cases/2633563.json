L. No. 111-148, 124\nStat. 119 (2010), under the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb to 2000bb-4.\nParticularly, the appellees object to the ACA’s requirement\nthat contraceptive coverage be provided to their plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries.      However, the nonprofit\nappellees are eligible for an accommodation to the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement, whereby once they\nadvise that they will not pay for the contraceptive services,\ncoverage for those services will be independently provided by\nan insurance issuer or third-party administrator.         The\nappellees urge that the accommodation violates RFRA\nbecause it forces them to “facilitate” or “trigger” the\nprovision of insurance coverage for contraceptive services,\nwhich they oppose on religious grounds. The appellees\naffiliated with the Catholic Church also object on the basis\nthat the application of the accommodation to Catholic\nnonprofit organizations has the impermissible effect of\ndividing the Catholic Church, because the Dioceses\nthemselves are eligible for an actual exemption from the\n\n\n\n\n                             11\n\fcontraceptive coverage requirement. The District Courts\ngranted the appellees’ motions for a preliminary injunction,\nand, in one of the cases, converted the preliminary injunction\nto a permanent injunction. Because we disagree with the\nDistrict Courts and conclude that the accommodation places\nno substantial burden on the appellees, we will reverse.\n\n                     I.   BACKGROUND\n\n    A. Statutory and Regulatory Background\n\n           1. The Affordable Care Act, the Preventive\n              Services Coverage Requirement, and the\n              Accommodation for Religious Nonprofit\n              Organizations\n\n       In 2010, Congress passed the ACA, which requires\ngroup health plans and health insurance issuers offering\nhealth insurance coverage1 to cover preventive care and\nscreenings for women, without cost sharing (such as a\ncopayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), as provided for in\nguidelines established by the Department of Health and\n\n1\n   Eligible organizations may be either “insured” or “self-\ninsured.” An employer has an “insured” plan if it contracts\nwith an insurance company to bear the financial risk of\npaying its employees’ health insurance claims. An employer\nhas a “self-insured” plan if it bears the financial risk of paying\nits employees’ claims. Many self-insured employers use\nthird-party administrators to administer their plans and\nprocess claims. See Cong. Budget Office, Key Issues in\nAnalyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals 6 (2008). The\nappellees here fall into both categories.\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\fHuman Services (“HHS”). 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).2\nHHS requested assistance from the Institute of Medicine\n(“IOM”), a nonprofit arm of the National Academy of\nSciences, to develop guidelines regarding which preventive\nservices for women should be required. Group Health Plans\nand Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of\nPreventive Services Under the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726 (Feb. 15,\n2012) (codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. pt. 2590; and\n45 C.F.R. pt. 147). The IOM issued a report recommending a\nlist of preventive care services, including all contraceptive\nmethods approved by the Food and Drug Administration\n(“FDA”). The regulatory guidelines accordingly included\n“[a]ll Food and Drug Administration . . . approved\ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient\neducation and counseling for all women with reproductive\ncapacity,” as prescribed by a health care provider. 77 Fed.\nReg. at 8725 (alteration in original). The relevant regulations\nrequire coverage of the contraceptive services recommended\nin the guidelines. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv); 29\nC.F.R.        § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv);       45       C.F.R.\n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv).\n\n\n2\n  The ACA’s preventive care requirements apply only to non-\ngrandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers\noffering non-grandfathered health insurance coverage. See 45\nC.F.R. § 147.140 (exempting “grandfathered” plans—\n“coverage provided by a group health plan, or a group or\nindividual health insurance issuer, in which an individual was\nenrolled as of March 23, 2010,” the date on which the ACA\nwas enacted “for as long as it maintains that status under the\nrules of this section”).\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\f        The implementing regulations authorize an exemption\nfrom contraceptive coverage for the group health plan of a\n“religious employer.”     45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a).        The\nregulations define a religious employer as a nonprofit\norganization described in the Internal Revenue Code\nprovision referring to churches, their integrated auxiliaries,\nand conventions or associations of churches, and the\nexclusively religious activities of any religious order. Id.\n(citing 26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii)).\n\n        After notice-and-comment rulemaking, the Department\nof the Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the Department\nof Health and Human Services (the “Departments”) published\nfinal regulations in July 2013 that provided relief for\norganizations that, while not “religious employers,”\nnonetheless oppose coverage on account of their religious\nobjections. These regulations include an “accommodation”\nfor group health plans established or maintained by “eligible\norganizations” (and group health coverage provided in\nconnection with such plans). See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n2713A(a), 29 C.F.R. § 2590-2713A(a), 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(b); Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under\nthe Affordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870 (July 2, 2013)\n(codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. pts. 2510 & 2590; and\n45 C.F.R. pts. 147 & 156). An “eligible organization” means\na nonprofit organization that “holds itself out as a religious\norganization” and “opposes providing coverage for some or\nall of any contraceptive services required to be covered . . . on\naccount of religious objections.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b). To\ninvoke this accommodation, an employer must certify that it\nis such an organization. Id. § 147.131(b)(4). Here, there is\nno dispute that the nonprofit religious organization appellees\nare eligible organizations under these regulations.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\f        To take advantage of the accommodation to the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement, the eligible organization\nmust complete the self-certification form, EBSA Form 700,\nissued by the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits\nSecurity Administration, indicating that it has a religious\nobjection to providing coverage for the required contraceptive\nservices. The eligible organization then is to provide a copy\nof the form to its insurance issuer or third-party administrator.\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,875.3\n\n3\n  After these suits had been filed, the Supreme Court granted\nan injunction pending appeal in Wheaton College v. Burwell,\n134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014), and ordered that the eligible\norganization applicant need not use EBSA Form 700 to notify\nits insurance issuer or third-party administrator of its religious\nobjection to the contraceptive coverage requirement; instead,\nif the organization notifies the government in writing of its\nobjection, the government is enjoined from enforcing the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement against the organization.\nId. at 2807. In response, interim final regulations were issued\nin August 2014 allowing an eligible organization to opt out\nby notifying HHS directly, rather than notifying its insurance\nissuer or third-party administrator; the eligible organization\nalso need not use EBSA Form 700. Coverage of Certain\nPreventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 79 Fed.\nReg. 51,092 (Aug. 27, 2014) (codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29\nC.F.R. pts. 2510 & 2590; and 45 C.F.R. pt. 147); see also 29\nC.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(1)(ii); 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(c)(1)(ii).        We conclude here that the\naccommodation, even when utilizing EBSA Form 700, poses\nno substantial burden. To the extent that the Supreme Court’s\norder in Wheaton may be read to signal that the alternative\n\n\n\n\n                               15\n\f        The submission of the form has no real effect on the\nplan participants and beneficiaries. They still have access to\ncontraception, without cost sharing, through alternate\nmechanisms in the regulations.4 Under these regulations, an\neligible organization is not required “to contract, arrange, pay,\nor refer for contraceptive coverage” to which it objects on\nreligious grounds. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874. As a result, either\nthe health insurance issuer or the third-party administrator is\nrequired by regulation to provide separate payments for\ncontraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries.\nThe ACA’s prohibition on cost sharing for preventive\nservices, including contraception, bars the insurance issuer or\nthird-party administrator from imposing any premium or fee\non the group health plan, or plan participants and\nbeneficiaries. Furthermore, the accommodation prohibits the\ninsurance issuer or third-party administrator from imposing\nsuch fees on the eligible organization. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n\nnotification procedure is less burdensome than using EBSA\nForm 700, we also conclude that the alternative compliance\nmechanism set forth in the August 2014 regulations poses no\nsubstantial burden.\n4\n The Supreme Court has recognized that the accommodation\nensures that employees of entities with religious objections\nhave the same access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as\nemployees of entities without religious objections to\nproviding such coverage. “The effect of the HHS-created\naccommodation on the women employed . . . would be\nprecisely zero. Under that accommodation, these women\nwould still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives\nwithout cost sharing.” Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,\n134 S. Ct. 2751, 2760 (2014).\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f§ 300gg-13(a); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2), (c)(2)(ii);\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii). The insurance issuer or third-\nparty administrator must “[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive\ncoverage from the group health insurance coverage provided\nin connection with the [eligible organization’s] group health\nplan” and “segregate premium revenue collected from the\neligible organization from the monies used to provide\npayments for contraceptive services.” 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(c)(2)(i)(A), (ii); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(2)(i)(A), (ii).\nThe third-party administrator may seek reimbursement for\npayments for contraceptive services from the federal\ngovernment. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(3).\n\n       Furthermore, the health insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator, not the eligible organization, provides notice to\nthe plan participants and beneficiaries regarding contraceptive\ncoverage “separate from” materials that are distributed in\nconnection with the eligible organization’s group health\ncoverage, specifying that “the eligible organization does not\nadminister or fund contraceptive benefits, but that the third\nparty administrator or issuer, as applicable, provides separate\npayments for contraceptive services, and must provide\ncontact information for questions and complaints.” See 26\nC.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(d); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d);\n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(d).5 This is in accordance with the\npreventive services requirement of the ACA.\n\n5\n  As part of this separate notice regime, eligible organizations\ndo not need to provide the names of their beneficiaries to their\ninsurance issuers or third-party administrators, or otherwise\ncoordinate notices with them. See Priests for Life v. U.S.\nDep’t of Health & Human Servs., 772 F.3d 229, 254 (D.C.\nCir. 2014) (agreeing that “[n]o regulation related to the\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\f          2. RFRA Challenge to the Accommodation\n\n        The appellees challenge the ACA’s contraceptive\ncoverage requirement as posing a substantial burden on their\nreligious exercise, in violation of RFRA. RFRA places\nrequirements on all federal statutes that impact a person’s\nexercise of religion, even when that federal statute is a rule of\ngeneral applicability. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a).6 Under\nRFRA, the “[g]overnment may substantially burden a\nperson’s exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that\napplication of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance\nof a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least\nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental\ninterest.” Id. § 2000bb-1(b).\n\n\naccommodation imposes any such duty on Plaintiffs”); see\nalso 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(4) (“A third party\nadministrator may not require any documentation other than a\ncopy of the self-certification from the eligible organization or\nnotification from the Department of Labor”); id. § 2590.715-\n2713A(c)(1)(i) (“When a copy of the self-certification is\nprovided directly to an issuer, the issuer has sole\nresponsibility for providing such coverage . . . . An issuer\nmay not require any further documentation from the eligible\norganization regarding its status as such.”).\n6\n  Because the issue was not raised before us, we assume that\nRFRA is constitutional as applied to federal laws and\nregulations. But see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507,\n536 (1997) (holding that Congress did not have authority\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to impose RFRA on state\nor local laws).\n\n\n\n\n                               18\n\f       Congress enacted RFRA in 1993 in response to the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Employment Division,\nDepartment of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494\nU.S. 872 (1990). In Smith, the Supreme Court rejected the\nbalancing test for evaluating claims under the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment set forth in Sherbert v.\nVerner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406\nU.S. 205 (1972), under which the Court asked whether the\nchallenged law substantially burdened a religious practice\nand, if it did, whether that burden was justified by a\ncompelling governmental interest.          The Smith Court\nconcluded that the continued application of the compelling-\ninterest test would produce a constitutional right to ignore\nneutral laws of general applicability and would “open the\nprospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions\nfrom civil obligations of almost every conceivable kind,”\nwhich the First Amendment does not require. 494 U.S. at\n888-89. “The government’s ability to enforce generally\napplicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its\nability to carry out other aspects of public policy, ‘cannot\ndepend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on\na religious objector’s spiritual development.’” Id. at 885\n(quoting Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485\nU.S. 439, 451 (1988)). Making an individual’s obligation to\nobey a generally applicable law contingent upon the\nindividual’s religious beliefs, except where the state interest is\ncompelling, permits that individual, “by virtue of his beliefs,\n‘to become a law unto himself,’” which “contradicts both\nconstitutional tradition and common sense.” Id. (quoting\nReynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 167 (1878)).\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\f        Congress then passed RFRA to legislatively overrule\nthe Smith standard for analyzing claims under the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment. RFRA’s stated\npurposes are: (1) to restore the compelling-interest test as set\nforth in Sherbert and Yoder and to guarantee its application in\nall cases where free exercise of religion is substantially\nburdened; and (2) to provide a claim or defense to persons\nwhose religious exercise is substantially burdened by the\ngovernment. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b). The Supreme Court has\ncharacterized RFRA as “adopt[ing] a statutory rule\ncomparable to the constitutional rule rejected in Smith.”\nGonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal,\n546 U.S. 418, 424 (2006).\n\n    B. Factual Background and Procedural History7\n\n       We review here the following District Court opinions:\ntwo preliminary injunctions issued in Geneva College v.\nSebelius, and a preliminary injunction and permanent\ninjunction issued in the related cases of Most Reverend David\nA. Zubik v. Sebelius and Most Reverend Lawrence T. Persico\nv. Sebelius. The Zubik and Persico appeals were consolidated\nand now have also been consolidated with the Geneva appeal.\n\n              1. Geneva Appellee\n\n        Appellee Geneva College (“Geneva”) is a nonprofit\ninstitution of higher learning established by the Reformed\nPresbyterian Church of North America. Geneva believes that\n\n7\n  The District Courts in these cases had jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and this Court has appellate jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\fit would be sinful and immoral for it to intentionally\nparticipate in, pay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support\naccess to abortion (including emergency contraceptives Plan\nB and ella, and two intrauterine devices, all of which Geneva\ncharacterizes as causing abortion) because such participation\nviolates religious prohibitions on murder. Geneva contracts\nwith an insurance issuer for its student and employee health\ninsurance plans.\n\n              2. Geneva District Court Opinions\n\n       The District Court granted Geneva’s motion for a\npreliminary injunction with respect to its student plan on June\n18, 2013, and enjoined the government from applying or\nenforcing 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4) and requiring that\nGeneva’s student health insurance plan, its plan broker, or its\nplan insurer provide “abortifacients” contrary to Geneva’s\nreligious objections. (J.A. 35-36.) The District Court began\nby stating that the Supreme Court has cautioned courts to be\nreluctant to “dissect religious beliefs” when engaging in a\nsubstantial burden analysis. (J.A. 24 (quoting Thomas v.\nReview Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 715\n(1981)).)\n       The District Court concluded that Geneva had shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits with respect to the\npresence of a substantial burden under RFRA and found that\nthree Supreme Court free exercise cases supported Geneva’s\nargument regarding the presence of a substantial burden\nunder RFRA. First, it noted that in Yoder, 406 U.S. at 234-\n35, a state compulsory education law for children up to age\nsixteen, with a penalty of a criminal fine, violated the free\nexercise rights of the Amish plaintiffs. Second, in Sherbert,\n374 U.S. at 410, the state could not withhold unemployment\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\fbenefits from a worker who refused employment on the\ngrounds that working Saturdays violated her religious beliefs.\nThird, in Thomas, 450 U.S. at 719, the state could not deny\nunemployment benefits to a worker whose religious beliefs\nforbade his participation in manufacturing tanks for use by\nthe military. The District Court interpreted these cases as\nstanding for the proposition that these indirect burdens on\nreligious exercise are substantial enough to be cognizable\nunder RFRA. The District Court concluded that Geneva had\nonly two choices under the regulations—either provide the\nobjected-to coverage or drop its health insurance—and by\nbeing forced to choose between those two options, both\nrepugnant to its religious beliefs,8 Geneva faced a substantial\nburden.\n       The District Court then granted Geneva’s second\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, this time with respect to\n\n8\n  We recognize that the appellees believe providing health\ninsurance to their employees and students is part of their\nreligious commitments. The appellees urge, at most, that\ndropping their health insurance coverage would be a violation\nof their moral beliefs, but they do not argue that it would be,\nin and of itself, another substantial burden imposed on their\nreligious exercise. (Geneva Br. at 5 (“To fulfill its religious\ncommitments and duties in the Christ-centered educational\ncontext, the College promotes the spiritual and physical well-\nbeing and health of its employees and students. This includes\nthe provision of general health insurance to employees and\ntheir dependants and the facilitation of a student health\nplan.”); Zubik/Persico Br. at 6 (“As part of overseeing their\naffiliates and as part of Catholic social teaching, the Dioceses\nprovide self-insured health plans for Diocesan entities,\nincluding the Affiliates.”).)\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\fits employee plan, on December 23, 2013. The District Court\nagain enjoined the government from enforcing 42 U.S.C. §\n300gg-13(a)(4) and requiring that Geneva’s employee health\ninsurance plan, its plan broker, or its plan insurer provide\n“abortifacients” contrary to Geneva’s religious objections.\n(J.A. 67-68.) The District Court concluded that Geneva had\nshown a likelihood of success on the merits as to the presence\nof a substantial burden because the self-certification process\nforced Geneva to facilitate access to services it finds\nreligiously objectionable.        First, the District Court\nemphasized that a court must assess the intensity of the\ncoercion and pressure from the government, rather than\nlooking at the merits of the religious belief. (J.A. 58 (citing\nKorte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 683 (7th Cir. 2013), cert.\ndenied sub nom. Burwell v. Korte, 134 S. Ct. 2903 (2014),\nand Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114,\n1137 (10th Cir.), aff’d sub nom. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby\nStores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014)).) The District Court\nanalogized to cases involving the contraceptive coverage\nmandate for entities not eligible for the accommodation, such\nas the Hobby Lobby opinion in the Court of Appeals for the\nTenth Circuit, which found that the substantial fines and\npenalties imposed on an entity that refused to offer health\ncare coverage to its employees at all, or refused to provide\ncoverage for the mandated preventive services, constituted a\nsubstantial burden.\n\n       The District Court was convinced by Geneva’s\nexplanation that, although Geneva must engage in the same\nconduct that it did before the ACA—namely, notify the\ninsurance carrier that it would not provide coverage for the\nobjected-to services—the effect of that conduct is now\ndifferent. Before the ACA, Geneva’s notification resulted in\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\fits employees being unable to obtain coverage for\ncontraceptive services; after the ACA, Geneva’s employees\nare still provided access to the services as a matter of law.\n“Under the ACA, Geneva has two choices: (1) provide\ninsurance coverage to its employees, which will result in\ncoverage for the objected to services; or (2) refuse to provide\ninsurance coverage for its employees, which will result in\nfines, harm to its employees’ well-being and competitive\ndisadvantages. Both options require Geneva to act contrary\nto its religious duties and beliefs.” (J.A. 61 n.12.)\n\n       Geneva argues that the District Court was correct that\na substantial burden is present here because (1) complying\nwith either the contraceptive coverage requirement or the\naccommodation would cause Geneva to “trigger,” “facilitate,”\nor be “complicit” in the commission of acts that it likens to\nabortion; and (2) the fines that Geneva faces for its refusal to\ncomply with the contraceptive coverage requirement or the\naccommodation would pressure it to conform.\n              3. Zubik/Persico Appellees\n\n       Appellees in the Zubik and Persico cases include: the\nBishop of Pittsburgh, David A. Zubik, and the Bishop of Erie,\nLawrence T. Persico; the Diocese of Pittsburgh and the\nDiocese of Erie, both of which qualify for the exemption to\nthe contraceptive coverage requirement under 45 C.F.R. §\n147.131(a); and Catholic Charities of the Diocese of\nPittsburgh, Prince of Peace Center, St. Martin Center, and\nErie Catholic Cathedral Preparatory School, which are all\nnonprofit organizations affiliated with the Catholic Church.\nThe Catholic religious nonprofit organizations are controlled\nby their respective Dioceses and operate in accordance with\nCatholic doctrine and teachings. The Bishops oversee the\n\n\n\n\n                              24\n\fmanagement of the affiliated nonprofits with regard to\nadherence to Catholic doctrine. The Catholic faith prohibits\nproviding, subsidizing, initiating, or facilitating insurance\ncoverage for sterilization services, contraceptives, other drugs\nthat the Catholic Church believes to cause abortion, and\nrelated reproductive educational and counseling services.\nThe Dioceses provide self-insured health plans to the\nnonprofits and contract with third-party administrators to\nhandle claims administration of the plans. As a result of their\nprovision of coverage to the nonprofits, the Dioceses, which\nare otherwise exempt, must comply with the contraceptive\ncoverage requirement as to the nonprofits.\n\n              4. Zubik/Persico District Court Opinions\n\n        The District Court issued a preliminary injunction that\napplied to both the Zubik and Persico cases on November 21,\n2013, and converted that injunction into a permanent\ninjunction on December 20, 2013.\n        The District Court characterized the issue before it as\n“whether [the appellees], being non-secular in nature, are\nlikely to succeed on the merits of proving that their right to\nfreely exercise their religion has been substantially burdened\nby the ‘accommodation’ which requires the Bishops of two\nseparate Dioceses . . . to sign a form which thereby\nfacilitates/initiates the provision of contraceptive products,\nservices, and counseling.” (J.A. 116.) The Zubik/Persico\nappellees conceded that they have provided similar\ninformation as is required by the self-certification form to\ntheir third-party administrator in the past. However, their past\nactions barred the provision of contraceptive products,\nservices, or counseling.        Now, under the ACA, this\ninformation will be used to “facilitate/initiate the provision of\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fcontraceptive products, services, or counseling – in direct\ncontravention to their religious tenets.” (Id.) Accordingly,\nthe District Court concluded that the government is\nimpermissibly asking the appellees for documentation for\nwhat the appellees sincerely believe is an immoral purpose,\nand thus “they cannot provide it.” (J.A. 117.) In conclusion,\nthe District Court acknowledged that the accommodation\nallows the appellees to avoid directly paying for contraceptive\nservices by shifting responsibility for providing contraceptive\ncoverage. Despite this fact, because the appellees had a\nsincerely held belief that this shift in responsibility did not\nexonerate them from the moral implications of the use of\ncontraception, the accommodation imposed a substantial\nburden.\n\n       Furthermore, the District Court held that the differing\napplication of the exemption and the accommodation—the\nformer applying to the Catholic Church, and the latter\napplying to Catholic nonprofit organizations—has the effect\nof dividing the Catholic Church, thereby imposing a\nsubstantial    burden.        “[T]he   religious    employer\n‘accommodation’ separates the ‘good works (faith in action)\nemployers’ from the ‘houses of worship employers’ within\nthe Catholic Church by refusing to allow the ‘good works\nemployers’ the same burden-free exercise of their religion”\nunder the exemption. (J.A. 118.) The District Court\nquestioned why religious employers who share the same\nreligious tenets are not exempt, or why all religious\nemployers do not fall within the accommodation, such that\n“even though [the appellees] here share identical, religious\nbeliefs, and even though they share the same persons as the\nreligious heads of their organizations, the heads of [the\nappellees’] service organizations may not fully exercise their\n\n\n\n\n                              26\n\fright to those specific beliefs, when acting as the heads of the\ncharitable and educational arms of the Church.” (J.A. 118,\n120.) The District Court concluded that “the religious\nemployer ‘exemption’ enables some religious employers to\ncompletely eliminate the provision of contraceptive products,\nservices, and counseling through the Dioceses’ health plans\nand third parties,” whereas “the religious employer\n‘accommodation’ requires other religious employers (often\ntimes the same member with the same sincerely-held beliefs)\nto take affirmative actions to facilitate/initiate the provision of\ncontraceptive products, services, and counseling – albeit from\na third-party.” (J.A. 120-21.)\n\n       The Zubik/Persico appellees argue that the District\nCourt was correct in finding a substantial burden because (1)\nthey interpret the accommodation to require them to authorize\nand designate a third party to add the objectionable coverage\nto their plans, in violation of their sincerely held religious\nbeliefs that they cannot provide or facilitate that coverage;\nand (2) the different scope of the religious employer\nexemption and the accommodation impermissibly splits the\nCatholic Church.\n\n        The government, as appellant in both the\nZubik/Persico and Geneva appeals, argues that the District\nCourts were incorrect and the appellees are not subject to a\nsubstantial burden, because the submission of the form is not\nin itself burdensome and does not give rise to the coverage.\nRather, federal law requires third parties—insurance issuers\nand third-party administrators—to provide coverage after the\nappellees refuse to provide contraceptive coverage\nthemselves. By invoking the accommodation process, the\nappellees do not facilitate the provision of contraceptive\n\n\n\n\n                                27\n\fcoverage by third parties. Rather, the third parties providing\ncoverage do so as a result of legal obligations imposed by the\nACA.\n\n                     II.   DISCUSSION\n\n    A. Standard of Review\n\n       We employ a tripartite standard of review for\npreliminary injunctions. “We review the District Court’s\nfindings of fact for clear error. Legal conclusions are\nassessed de novo. The ultimate decision to grant or deny the\ninjunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” K.A. ex rel.\nAyers v. Pocono Mountain Sch. Dist., 710 F.3d 99, 105 (3d\nCir. 2013) (quoting Sypniewski v. Warren Hills Reg’l Bd. of\nEduc., 307 F.3d 243, 252 (3d Cir. 2002)). The same\nframework applies to the review of a grant of a permanent\ninjunction. See United States v. Bell, 414 F.3d 474, 477-78\n(3d Cir. 2005).9 Because we conclude that the appellees have\nnot demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n\n9\n  “A party seeking a preliminary injunction must show: (1) a\nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) that it will suffer\nirreparable harm if the injunction is denied; (3) that granting\npreliminary relief will not result in even greater harm to the\nnonmoving party; and (4) that the public interest favors such\nrelief.” Kos Pharm., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 708\n(3d Cir. 2004). It is the plaintiff’s burden to establish every\nelement in its favor. P.C. Yonkers, Inc. v. Celebrations the\nParty & Seasonal Superstore, LLC, 428 F.3d 504, 508 (3d\nCir. 2005). A permanent injunction requires actual success\non the merits. See Shields v. Zuccarini, 254 F.3d 476, 482\n(3d Cir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n                              28\n\fRFRA claim, we need not reach the other prongs of the\ninjunction analysis.\n\n   B. Likelihood of Success as to Substantial Burden\n\n              1. Trigger/Facilitation/Complicity\n\n                 Argument\n\n        We first must identify what conduct the appellees\ncontend is burdensome to their religious exercise. It is not the\nact of filling out or submitting EBSA Form 700 itself. The\nappellees conceded at oral argument that the mere act of\ncompleting EBSA Form 700 does not impose a burden on\ntheir religious exercise.\n\n       The appellees’ essential challenge is that providing the\nself-certification form to the insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator “triggers” the provision of the contraceptive\ncoverage to their employees and students. The appellees\nreframed this proposition at oral argument, stating that the\naccommodation requires them to be “complicit” in sin.\nAppellees urge that there is a causal link between providing\nnotification of their religious objection to providing\ncontraceptive coverage and the offering of contraceptive\ncoverage by a third party. That link, they argue, makes them\ncomplicit in the provision of certain forms of contraception,\nwhich is prohibited by their religious beliefs.\n\n       Without testing the appellees’ religious beliefs, we\nmust nonetheless objectively assess whether the appellees’\ncompliance with the self-certification procedure does, in fact,\ntrigger, facilitate, or make them complicit in the provision of\n\n\n\n\n                              29\n\fcontraceptive coverage. Through RFRA’s adoption of the\nSupreme Court’s pre-Smith free exercise jurisprudence,\nCongress has required qualitative assessment of the merits of\nthe appellees’ RFRA claims. See Korte, 735 F.3d at 705\n(Rovner, J., dissenting).10 “It is virtually self-evident that the\nFree Exercise Clause does not require an exemption from a\ngovernmental program unless, at a minimum, inclusion in the\nprogram actually burdens the claimant’s freedom to exercise\nreligious rights.” Tony & Susan Alamo Found. v. Sec’y of\nLabor, 471 U.S. 290, 303 (1985). Furthermore, the Supreme\nCourt has stated that “[a] governmental burden on religious\nliberty is not insulated from review simply because it is\nindirect; but the nature of the burden is relevant to the\nstandard that the government must meet to justify the\nburden.” Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 706-07 (1986)\n(citation omitted). These principles were applied in Lyng,\nwhere the Supreme Court recognized that the Native\nAmerican respondents’ beliefs were sincere, and that the\ngovernment’s proposed actions would have severe adverse\neffects on their religious practice. However, the Court\ndisagreed that the burden on the respondents’ belief was\n“heavy enough to violate the Free Exercise Clause unless the\n\n10\n   We note that the Korte majority opinion may have been\nundermined by the later decision of the Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit in Univ. of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743\nF.3d 547, 554 (7th Cir. 2014), petition for cert. filed, No. 14-\n392 (Oct. 3, 2014). The majority opinion in Notre Dame,\ndecided after Korte but before Hobby Lobby, analyzes the\nmechanics of the accommodation and weakens the Korte\nmajority’s urge for deference. This type of analysis remains\ngood law after Hobby Lobby. See Priests for Life, 772 F.3d\n229, 247 (D.C. Cir. 2014).\n\n\n\n\n                               30\n\fGovernment can demonstrate a compelling need to complete\nthe . . . road to engage in timber harvesting in the . . .\n[challenged] area.” 485 U.S. at 447 (emphasis added).\n\n        While the Supreme Court reinforced in Hobby Lobby\nthat we should defer to the reasonableness of the appellees’\nreligious beliefs, this does not bar our objective evaluation of\nthe nature of the claimed burden and the substantiality of that\nburden on the appellees’ religious exercise. This involves an\nassessment of how the regulatory measure actually works.\nIndeed, how else are we to decide whether the appellees’\nreligious exercise is substantially burdened? “[T]here is\nnothing about RFRA or First Amendment jurisprudence that\nrequires the Court to accept [the appellees’] characterization\nof the regulatory scheme on its face.” Mich. Catholic\nConference & Catholic Family Servs., 755 F.3d 372, 385 (6th\nCir. 2014) (quoting Roman Catholic Archbishop of Wash. v.\nSebelius, 19 F. Supp. 3d 48, 71 (D.D.C. 2013)). We may\nconsider the nature of the action required of the appellees, the\nconnection between that action and the appellees’ beliefs, and\nthe extent to which that action interferes with or otherwise\naffects the appellees’ exercise of religion—all without\ndelving into the appellees’ beliefs. See, e.g., Korte, 735 F.3d\nat 710 (Rovner, J., dissenting). For example, the court in\nKaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2008),\n“[a]ccept[ed] as true the factual allegations that\nKaemmerling’s beliefs are sincere and of a religious nature—\nbut not the legal conclusion, cast as a factual allegations, that\nhis religious exercise is substantially burdened.” The court\nfurther explained: “we conclude that Kaemmerling does not\nallege facts sufficient to state a substantial burden on his\n\n\n\n\n                               31\n\freligious exercise because he cannot identify any ‘exercise’\nwhich is the subject of the burden to which he objects.” Id.11\n\n        The Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby evaluated whether\nthe requirement to provide contraceptive coverage absent the\naccommodation procedure substantially burdened the\nreligious exercise of the owners of closely-held, for-profit\ncorporations. The issue of whether there is an actual burden\nwas easily resolved in Hobby Lobby, since there was little\ndoubt that the actual provision of services did render the\nplaintiffs “complicit.” And in Hobby Lobby, the Court came\nto its conclusion that, without any accommodation, the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement imposed a substantial\nburden on the religious exercise of the for-profit corporations,\nbecause those plaintiffs were required to either provide health\ninsurance that included contraceptive coverage, in violation\nof their religious beliefs, or pay substantial fines.12 See 134\n11\n    The Zubik/Persico appellees argue that we should not\nindependently analyze the burdens imposed on them, or the\nsubstantiality of that burden, because the government\nstipulated to facts contained in the appellees’ declarations—\nparticularly, that the appellees believe that participation in the\naccommodation, including signing the self-certification form,\nfacilitates moral evil in violation of Catholic doctrine. The\nappellees are mistaken, because the government’s factual\nstipulation does not preclude this Court from determining the\ncontours of the asserted burden or whether the burden is\nsubstantial.\n12\n   Indeed, Justice Alito’s majority opinion in Hobby Lobby\ncomments favorably on the accommodation procedure at\nissue here, which separates an eligible organization from the\nobjected-to contraceptive services:\n\n\n\n\n                               32\n\fHHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its\ndisposal an approach that is less restrictive than\nrequiring employers to fund contraceptive\nmethods that violate their religious beliefs. As\nwe explained above, HHS has already\nestablished an accommodation for nonprofit\norganizations with religious objections. Under\nthat accommodation, the organization can self-\ncertify that it opposes providing coverage for\nparticular contraceptive services.         If the\norganization makes such a certification, the\norganization’s insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator must “[e]xpressly exclude\ncontraceptive coverage from the group health\ninsurance coverage provided in connection with\nthe group health plan” and “[p]rovide separate\npayments for any contraceptive services\nrequired to be covered” without imposing “any\ncost-sharing requirements . . . on the eligible\norganization, the group health plan, or plan\nparticipants          or           beneficiaries.”\n\n       We do not decide today whether an\napproach of this type complies with RFRA for\npurposes of all religious claims. At a minimum,\nhowever, it does not impinge on the plaintiffs’\nreligious belief that providing insurance\ncoverage for the contraceptives at issue here\nviolates their religion, and it serves HHS’s\nstated       interests        equally      well.\n\n\n\n\n                       33\n\fS. Ct. at 2775-76; see also Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 245.\nHere, the appellees are not faced with a “provide” or “pay”\ndilemma because they have a third option—notification\npursuant to the accommodation—to avoid both providing\ncontraceptive coverage to their employees and facing\npenalties for noncompliance with the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement.\n\n        The appellees urge that a burden exists here because\nthe submission of the self-certification form triggers,\nfacilitates, and makes them complicit in the provision of\nobjected-to services. But after testing that assertion, we\ncannot agree that the submission of the self-certification form\nhas the effect the appellees claim. First, the self-certification\nform does not trigger or facilitate the provision of\ncontraceptive coverage because coverage is mandated to be\notherwise provided by federal law. Federal law, rather than\nany involvement by the appellees in filling out or submitting\nthe self-certification form, creates the obligation of the\ninsurance issuers and third-party administrators to provide\ncoverage for contraceptive services. As Judge Posner has\nexplained, this is not a situation where the self-certification\nform enables the provision of the very contraceptive services\nthat the appellees find sinful. Rather, “[f]ederal law, not the\nreligious organization’s signing and mailing the form,\nrequires health-care insurers, along with third-party\nadministrators of self-insured plans, to cover contraceptive\nservices.” Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 554. Thus, federal law,\nnot the submission of the self-certification form, enables the\nprovision of contraceptive coverage.\n\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2782 (alterations in original)\n(footnotes omitted) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                               34\n\f       The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit adopted\nJudge Posner’s logic that the obligation to cover\ncontraception is not triggered by the act of self-certification.\nRather, it is triggered by the force of law—the ACA and its\nimplementing regulations. See Mich. Catholic Conference,\n755 F.3d at 387 (“Submitting the self-certification form to the\ninsurance issuer or third-party administrator does not ‘trigger’\ncontraceptive coverage; it is federal law that requires the\ninsurance issuer or the third-party administrator to provide\nthis coverage.”). Most recently, and after the Supreme\nCourt’s opinion in Hobby Lobby, the Court of Appeals for the\nD.C. Circuit agreed with these courts’ explanations of the\nmechanics of the accommodation. See Priests for Life, 772\nF.3d at 252 (“As the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have also\nconcluded, the insurers’ or [the third-party administrators’]\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage originates from\nthe ACA and its attendant regulations, not from Plaintiffs’\nself-certification or alternative notice.”). Thus, submitting the\nself-certification form means only that the eligible\norganization is not providing contraceptive coverage and will\nnot be subjected to penalties. By participating in the\naccommodation, the eligible organization has no role\nwhatsoever in the provision of the objected-to contraceptive\nservices.13\n\n13\n  Geneva argues that there is no guarantee that its employees\nand students would obtain the objected-to contraceptive\ncoverage if they were not enrolled in Geneva’s health plans.\nTherefore, Geneva asserts, the obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage arises only because it sponsors an\nemployee or student health plan. Geneva cites the following\npassage from Notre Dame in support: “By refusing to fill out\n\n\n\n\n                               35\n\f        Moreover, the regulations specific to the Zubik and\nPersico appellees’ self-insured plan are no different in this\nrespect, and in no way cause the appellees to facilitate or\ntrigger the provision of contraceptive coverage. Those\nDepartment of Labor regulations state that EBSA Form 700\n“shall be treated as a designation of the third party\nadministrator as the plan administrator under section 3(16) of\nERISA for any contraceptive services required to be\ncovered.” 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). The Zubik/Persico\nappellees argue that these regulations cause it to “facilitate”\nthe provision of contraceptives because the signed self-\ncertification form authorizes the third-party administrator to\nserve as the plan administrator. However, this purported\n\n\nthe form Notre Dame would subject itself to penalties, but\nAetna and Meritain would still be required by federal law to\nprovide the services to the university’s students and\nemployees unless and until their contractual relation with\nNotre Dame terminated.” 743 F.3d at 554 (emphasis added).\nHowever, Geneva’s argument is unavailing. The provision of\ncontraceptive coverage is not dependent upon Geneva’s\ncontract with its insurance company. “Once [the appellees]\nopt out of the contraceptive coverage requirement, . . .\ncontraceptive services are not provided to women because of\n[the appellees’] contracts with insurance companies; they are\nprovided because federal law requires insurers and TPAs to\nprovide insurance beneficiaries with coverage for\ncontraception.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 253. “RFRA\ndoes not entitle [the appellees] to control their employees’\nrelationships with other entities willing to provide health\ninsurance coverage to which the employees are legally\nentitled.” Id. at 256.\n\n\n\n\n                              36\n\fcausal connection is nonexistent. The eligible organization\nhas no effect on the designation of the plan administrator;\ninstead, it is the government that treats and designates the\nthird-party administrator as the plan administrator under\nERISA. See Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 555. “[The appellees]\nsubmit forms to communicate their decisions to opt out, not to\nauthorize [the third-party administrators] to do anything on\ntheir behalf. The regulatory treatment of the form as\nsufficient under ERISA does not change the reality that the\nobjected-to services are made available because of the\nregulations, not because [the appellees] complete a self-\ncertification.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 254-55. Indeed,\nthis “opt-out” is just that—an indication that the eligible\norganization chooses not to provide coverage for the\nobjected-to services.\n\n       Moreover, the submission of the self-certification form\ndoes not make the appellees “complicit” in the provision of\ncontraceptive coverage. If anything, because the appellees\nspecifically state on the self-certification form that they object\non religious grounds to providing such coverage, it is a\ndeclaration that they will not be complicit in providing\ncoverage. Ultimately, the regulatory notice requirement does\nnot necessitate any action that interferes with the appellees’\nreligious activities. “The organization must send a single\nsheet of paper honestly communicating its eligibility and\nsincere religious objection in order to be excused from the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement.” Id. at 249. The\nappellees “need only reaffirm [their] religiously based\nopposition to providing contraceptive coverage, at which\npoint third parties will provide the coverage separate and\napart from [the appellees’] plan of benefits.” Priests for Life\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 7 F. Supp. 3d 88,\n\n\n\n\n                               37\n\f104 (D.D.C. 2013), aff’d, Priests for Life, 772 F.3d 229 (D.C.\nCir. 2014). The appellees’ real objection is to what happens\nafter the form is provided—that is, to the actions of the\ninsurance issuers and the third-party administrators, required\nby law, once the appellees give notice of their objection.\n“RFRA does not grant [the appellees] a religious veto against\nplan providers’ compliance with those regulations, nor the\nright to enlist the government to effectuate such a religious\nveto against legally required conduct of third parties.” Priests\nfor Life, 772 F.3d at 251. “The fact that the regulations\nrequire the insurance issuers and third-party administrators to\nmodify their behavior does not demonstrate a substantial\nburden on the [appellees].” Mich. Catholic Conference, 755\nF.3d at 389.14\n\n14\n     A hypothetical example serves as a useful tool to\ndemonstrate the fallacy in the appellees’ characterization of\nthe accommodation: Assume that a person, John Doe, has a\njob that requires twenty-four-hour coverage, such as an\nemergency room doctor or nurse. John Doe is unable to work\nhis shift on a certain Tuesday, as that day is a religious\nholiday that mandates a day of rest. As a result, John Doe\nbelieves that it is inappropriate for anyone to work on that\nholiday. John Doe can request time off by filling out a certain\nform, but he will be penalized if he fails to show up for work\nwithout appropriately requesting time off. However, by\nfilling out this form, he believes that he will facilitate or\ntrigger or be complicit in someone else working in his place\non the religious holiday. John Doe sincerely believes that the\nsimple filling out of the time-off request imposes a substantial\nburden on his religious beliefs. In this example, John Doe,\nlike the appellees, is able to express his religious objection to\nworking on a religious holiday by declining to work that day.\n\n\n\n\n                               38\n\f       Thus, we cannot agree with the appellees’\ncharacterization of the effect of submitting the form as\ntriggering, facilitating, or making them complicit in the\nprovision of contraceptive coverage. At oral argument, the\nappellees argued that it was not merely the filing of the form\nthat imposed a burden, but, rather, what follows from it. But\nfree exercise jurisprudence instructs that we are to examine\nthe act the appellees must perform—not the effect of that\nact—to see if it burdens substantially the appellees’ religious\nexercise. The Supreme Court has consistently rejected the\nargument that an independent obligation on a third party can\n\n\nJohn Doe’s time-off request indicates that he will not be\ncomplicit in working on the religious holiday. Furthermore,\ndeclining to work on that Tuesday does not serve as a trigger\nor facilitator because one of his other colleagues will be\nforced to work that day, regardless of whether John Doe\nworks or not. However, just because John Doe does not wish\nto be associated with or play any role in the result (working\non a religious holiday), does not mean the conduct to which\nhe objects (filling out the time-off request form) substantially\nburdens his free exercise of religion. Just as we cannot\nconclude that John Doe’s religious exercise is being burdened\nby filling out the form, we cannot conclude that the appellees’\nreligious exercise is burdened by filling out the self-\ncertification form.       Furthermore, any “coercive” force\nattached to John Doe’s refusal to fill out the time-off request\nis similar to the fines that the appellees face if they refuse to\neither participate in the accommodation or provide\ncontraceptive coverage. In any event, such “coercive” force\nis relevant only if the conduct itself actually does substantially\nburden one’s religious exercise. That is not the case in this\nanalogy, and it is not the case for the appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                               39\n\fimpose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion in\nviolation of RFRA, as we discuss below. Pre-Smith free\nexercise cases, which RFRA was crafted to resurrect, have\ndistinguished between what a challenged law requires the\nobjecting parties to do, and what it permits another party—\nspecifically, the government—to do.\n\n         In Bowen, the Supreme Court determined that the Free\nExercise Clause did not require the government to\naccommodate a religiously based objection to the statutory\nrequirement that a Social Security number be provided to\napplicants for certain welfare benefits. Roy, a Native\nAmerican, argued that the government’s use of his daughter’s\nSocial Security number would “‘rob the spirit’ of his daughter\nand prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power.” 476\nU.S. at 696. Roy’s claim was unsuccessful because “[t]he\nFederal Government’s use of a Social Security number\nfor . . . [his daughter] d[id] not itself in any degree impair\nRoy’s ‘freedom to believe, express, and exercise’ his\nreligion.” Id. at 700. Rather, Roy was attempting to use the\nFree Exercise Clause to dictate how the government should\ntransact its business.\n\n      Never to our knowledge has the Court\n      interpreted the First Amendment to require the\n      Government itself to behave in ways that the\n      individual believes will further his or her\n      spiritual development or that of his or her\n      family. The Free Exercise Clause simply\n      cannot be understood to require the Government\n      to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that\n      comport with the religious beliefs of particular\n      citizens. Just as the Government may not insist\n\n\n\n\n                             40\n\f       that appellees engage in any set form of\n       religious observance, so appellees may not\n       demand that the Government join in their\n       chosen religious practices by refraining from\n       using a number to identify their daughter.\n       “[T]he Free Exercise Clause is written in terms\n       of what the government cannot do to the\n       individual, not in terms of what the individual\n       can extract from the government.” . . . The Free\n       Exercise Clause affords an individual protection\n       from      certain    forms    of    governmental\n       compulsion; it does not afford an individual a\n       right to dictate the conduct of the Government’s\n       internal procedures.\n\nId. at 699-700 (quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 412 (Douglas,\nJ., concurring)).\n\n        And, echoing the principles of Bowen, in Lyng,\nmembers of Native American tribes claimed that the federal\ngovernment violated their rights under the Free Exercise\nClause by permitting timber harvesting and construction on\nland used for religious purposes. 485 U.S. at 441-42. The\nSupreme Court concluded that the Free Exercise Clause “does\nnot and cannot imply that incidental effects of government\nprograms, which may make it more difficult to practice\ncertain religions but which have no tendency to coerce\nindividuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs,\nrequire government to bring forward a compelling\njustification for its otherwise lawful actions.” Id. at 450-51.\n\n      Building on this line of cases, the Court of Appeals for\nthe D.C. Circuit concluded that a federal prisoner failed to\n\n\n\n\n                              41\n\fstate a RFRA claim when he sought to enjoin application of\nthe DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act on the basis that\nDNA sampling, storage, and collection without limitations\nviolated his religious beliefs about the proper use of the\n“building blocks of life.” Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 674.\nKaemmerling could not state a claim that his religious\nexercise was substantially burdened because he did not\nidentify any religious exercise that was subjected to the\nburden to which he objected:\n\n      The government’s extraction, analysis, and\n      storage of Kaemmerling’s DNA information\n      does not call for Kaemmerling to modify his\n      religious behavior in any way—it involves no\n      action or forbearance on his part, nor does it\n      otherwise interfere with any religious act in\n      which he engages. Although the government’s\n      activities with his fluid or tissue sample after\n      the BOP takes it may offend Kaemmerling’s\n      religious beliefs, they cannot be said to hamper\n      his religious exercise because they do not\n      “pressure [him] to modify his behavior and to\n      violate his beliefs.”\n\nId. at 679 (alteration in original) (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S.\nat 718). “Like the parents in Bowen, Kaemmerling’s\nopposition to government collection and storage of his DNA\nprofile does not contend that any act of the government\npressures him to change his behavior and violate his religion,\nbut only seeks to require the government itself to conduct its\naffairs in conformance with his religion.” Id. at 680.\n\n\n\n\n                             42\n\f        Thus, the case law clearly draws a distinction between\nwhat the law may impose on a person over religious\nobjections, and what it permits or requires a third party to do.\nAlthough that person may have a religious objection to what\nthe government, or another third party, does with something\nthat the law requires to be provided (whether it be a Social\nSecurity number, DNA, or a form that states that the person\nreligiously objects to providing contraceptive coverage),\nRFRA does not necessarily permit that person to impose a\nrestraint on another’s action based on the claim that the action\nis religiously abhorrent.\n\n       These cases confirm that we can, indeed should,\nexamine the nature and degree of the asserted burden to\ndecide whether it amounts to a substantial burden under\nRFRA. Furthermore, we must assess how the objected-to\naction relates to the appellees’ religious exercise, and whether\nthe appellees’ objections focus on the action itself or the\nresult of the action, i.e., the obligations placed upon a third\nparty.\n\n       Far from “triggering” the provision of contraceptive\ncoverage to the appellees’ employees and students, EBSA\nForm 700 totally removes the appellees from providing those\nservices. “[T]he regulations provide an opt-out mechanism\nthat shifts to third parties the obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage to which health insurance\nbeneficiaries are entitled, and that fastidiously relieves [the\nappellees] of any obligation to contract, arrange, pay, or refer\nfor access to contraception . . . .” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at\n252.     The self-certification form requires the eligible\norganization or its plan to provide a copy to the\norganization’s insurance issuer or third-party administrator in\n\n\n\n\n                               43\n\forder for the plan to be administered in accordance with both\nthe eligible organization’s religious objection and the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement. The ACA already takes\ninto account beliefs like those of the appellees and\naccommodates them. “The accommodation in this case\nconsists in the organization’s . . . washing its hands of any\ninvolvement in contraceptive coverage, and the insurer and\nthe third-party administrator taking up the slack under\ncompulsion of federal law.” Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 557.\nThe regulations accommodate the interests of religious\ninstitutions that provide health services, while not curtailing\nthe public interest that motivates the federally mandated\nrequirement that such services shall be provided to women\nfree of charge. Id. at 551.\n\n       Because we find that the self-certification procedure\ndoes not cause or trigger the provision of contraceptive\ncoverage, appellees are unable to show that their religious\nexercise is burdened. Even if we were to conclude that there\nis a burden imposed on the appellees’ religious exercise, we\nwould be hard-pressed to find that it is substantial. Whether a\nburden is “substantial” under RFRA is a question of law, not\na question of fact. See Mahoney v. Doe, 642 F.3d 1112, 1121\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). RFRA’s reference to “substantial” burdens\nexpressly calls for a qualitative assessment of the burden that\nthe accommodation imposes on the appellees’ exercise of\nreligion. Korte, 735 F.3d at 705 (Rovner, J., dissenting).\nRFRA calls for a threshold inquiry into the nature of the\nburden placed on the appellees’ free exercise of religion:\n“substantial” is a term of degree that invites the courts to\ndistinguish between different types of burdens. Id. at 708.\n\n\n\n\n                              44\n\f       We have stated that a substantial burden exists where\n(1) “a follower is forced to choose between following the\nprecepts of his religion and forfeiting benefits otherwise\ngenerally available to other [persons] versus abandoning one\nof the precepts of his religion in order to receive a benefit”; or\n(2) “the government puts substantial pressure on an adherent\nto substantially modify his behavior and to violate his\nbeliefs.” See Washington v. Klem, 497 F.3d 272, 280 (3d Cir.\n2007) (interpreting a related statute, the Religious Land Use\nand Institutionalized Persons Act, which applies to prisoner\nand land use cases). However, a government action does not\nconstitute a substantial burden, even if the challenged action\n“would interfere significantly with private persons’ ability to\npursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own religious\nbeliefs,” if the government action does not coerce the\nindividuals to violate their religious beliefs or deny them “the\nrights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.”\nLyng, 485 U.S. at 449. Under this definition, can the\nsubmission of the self-certification form, which relieves the\nappellees of any connection to the provision of the objected-\nto contraceptive services, really impose a “substantial”\nburden on the appellees’ free exercise of religion? We think\nnot. While Hobby Lobby rejected the argument that the\nburden was too attenuated because the actual use of the\nobjected-to contraceptive methods was a matter of individual\nchoice, here, where the actual provision of contraceptive\ncoverage is by a third party, the burden is not merely\nattenuated at the outset but totally disconnected from the\nappellees.\n\n       The reasoning of the District Courts was misguided in\ntwo ways. First, the District Courts accepted the appellees’\ncharacterization of the accommodation as causing them to\n\n\n\n\n                               45\n\f“facilitate,” act as the “central cog,” or serve as the\n“necessary stimulus” for the provision of the objected-to\ncontraceptive services. (J.A. 60-61.) For the reasons we have\ndetailed, we cannot accept that characterization as a matter of\nfact or law. Second, the District Courts focused on the\ncoercive effect, i.e., the fact that the appellees faced a choice:\nsubmit the self-certification form and “facilitate” the\nprovision of contraceptive coverage, or pay fines for\nnoncompliance. However, now that we have dispelled the\nnotion that the self-certification procedure is burdensome, we\nneed not consider whether the burden is substantial, which\ninvolves consideration of the intensity of the coercion faced\nby the appellees. We will accordingly reverse the challenged\ninjunctions.\n\n              2. Dividing the Catholic Church Argument\n\n                  in Zubik/Persico\n\n        The appellees in Zubik/Persico argue that a second\nsubstantial burden is imposed on their religious exercise in\nthat the contraceptive coverage regulatory scheme improperly\npartitions the Catholic Church by making the Dioceses\neligible for the exemption, while the Catholic nonprofits can\nonly qualify for the accommodation, even though all the\nCatholic entities share the same religious beliefs. The District\nCourt agreed with the appellees and concluded that the\ncontraceptive mandate “would cause a division between the\nDioceses and their nonprofit, religious affiliated/related\nspiritual/charitable/educational organizations which fulfill\nportions of Dioceses’ mission. Further, any nonprofit,\nreligious affiliated/related organizations expelled from the\nDioceses’ health insurance plans would require significant\n\n\n\n\n                               46\n\frestructuring of the plans which would adversely affect the\nbenefits received from pooling resources.” (J.A. 76 (citation\nomitted).) We conclude that the inclusion of houses of\nworship in the exemption and religious nonprofits in the\naccommodation does not impose a substantial burden on the\nZubik/Persico appellees.\n\n       The definition of a “religious employer” who receives\nan exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement\nunder the regulations is based on longstanding Internal\nRevenue Code provisions. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a) (citing\n26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii)). “[R]eligious employers,\ndefined as in the cited regulation, have long enjoyed\nadvantages (notably tax advantages) over other entities,\nwithout these advantages being thought to violate the\nestablishment clause.” Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 560 (citation\nomitted) (citing Walz v. Tax Comm’n of N.Y., 397 U.S. 664,\n666, 672-73 (1970)). The Departments chose this definition\nfrom the Internal Revenue Code to categorize the entities\nsubject to the exemption and the accommodation because that\nprovision was a bright line that was already statutorily\ncodified and frequently applied: “The Departments believe\nthat the simplified and clarified definition of religious\nemployer continues to respect the religious interests of houses\nof worship and their integrated auxiliaries in a way that does\nnot undermine the governmental interests furthered by the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874;\nsee also Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\nAffordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 8456, 8461 (proposed Feb.\n6, 2013) (codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. pt. 2590, and\n45 C.F.R. pts. 147, 148, & 156) (“[T]his definition was\nintended to focus the religious employer exemption on ‘the\nunique relationship between a house of worship and its\n\n\n\n\n                              47\n\femployees in ministerial positions.’” (quoting Group Health\nPlans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of\nPreventive Services Under the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3,\n2011) (codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. pt. 2590; and\n45 C.F.R. pt. 147))).\n\n        Furthermore, we are not persuaded that the challenged\naccommodation poses any burden on the exempted appellees’\nreligious exercise, particularly a burden that would require the\nappellees to “expel” the religious nonprofit organizations\nfrom the Dioceses’ health insurance plans. See, e.g., Roman\nCatholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d\n232, 252 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“First, it is not at all clear why the\nDiocesan plaintiffs would have to ‘expel’ their non-exempt\naffiliates from their health plans. . . . Second, even if the law\ndid pressure the Diocesan plaintiffs to ‘expel’ their affiliates,\nplaintiffs do not state that the Diocesan plaintiffs’ religious\nbeliefs require them to have all their affiliate organizations on\na single health plan, such that ‘expelling’ the non-exempt\naffiliates would be an act forbidden by their religion.”).\n\n       Thus, we cannot agree that the different treatment\nafforded to the Catholic Church as a house worship versus the\nCatholic nonprofit organizations imposes a substantial burden\nin violation of RFRA.\n\n                   III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       We will reverse the District Courts’ orders granting the\nchallenged injunctions. Because we conclude that the\nappellees have not shown a likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their RFRA claim, based on the determination that\n\n\n\n\n                               48\n\fthe accommodation does not impose a substantial burden on\ntheir religious exercise, we need not reach the question of\nwhether the accommodation is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering a compelling governmental interest.\n\n\n\n\n                            49\n\f",

L. No. 111-148, 124\nStat. 119 (2010), under the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb to 2000bb-4.\nParticularly, the appellees object to the ACA’s requirement\nthat contraceptive coverage be provided to their plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries.      However, the nonprofit\nappellees are eligible for an accommodation to the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement, whereby once they\nadvise that they will not pay for the contraceptive services,\ncoverage for those services will be independently provided by\nan insurance issuer or third-party administrator.         The\nappellees urge that the accommodation violates RFRA\nbecause it forces them to “facilitate” or “trigger” the\nprovision of insurance coverage for contraceptive services,\nwhich they oppose on religious grounds. The appellees\naffiliated with the Catholic Church also object on the basis\nthat the application of the accommodation to Catholic\nnonprofit organizations has the impermissible effect of\ndividing the Catholic Church, because the Dioceses\nthemselves are eligible for an actual exemption from the\n\n\n\n\n                             11\n\fcontraceptive coverage requirement. The District Courts\ngranted the appellees’ motions for a preliminary injunction,\nand, in one of the cases, converted the preliminary injunction\nto a permanent injunction. Because we disagree with the\nDistrict Courts and conclude that the accommodation places\nno substantial burden on the appellees, we will reverse.\n\n                     I.   BACKGROUND\n\n    A. Statutory and Regulatory Background\n\n           1. The Affordable Care Act, the Preventive\n              Services Coverage Requirement, and the\n              Accommodation for Religious Nonprofit\n              Organizations\n\n       In 2010, Congress passed the ACA, which requires\ngroup health plans and health insurance issuers offering\nhealth insurance coverage1 to cover preventive care and\nscreenings for women, without cost sharing (such as a\ncopayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), as provided for in\nguidelines established by the Department of Health and\n\n1\n   Eligible organizations may be either “insured” or “self-\ninsured.” An employer has an “insured” plan if it contracts\nwith an insurance company to bear the financial risk of\npaying its employees’ health insurance claims. An employer\nhas a “self-insured” plan if it bears the financial risk of paying\nits employees’ claims. Many self-insured employers use\nthird-party administrators to administer their plans and\nprocess claims. See Cong. Budget Office, Key Issues in\nAnalyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals 6 (2008). The\nappellees here fall into both categories.\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\fHuman Services (“HHS”). 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).2\nHHS requested assistance from the Institute of Medicine\n(“IOM”), a nonprofit arm of the National Academy of\nSciences, to develop guidelines regarding which preventive\nservices for women should be required. Group Health Plans\nand Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of\nPreventive Services Under the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8726 (Feb. 15,\n2012) (codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. pt. 2590; and\n45 C.F.R. pt. 147). The IOM issued a report recommending a\nlist of preventive care services, including all contraceptive\nmethods approved by the Food and Drug Administration\n(“FDA”). The regulatory guidelines accordingly included\n“[a]ll Food and Drug Administration . . . approved\ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient\neducation and counseling for all women with reproductive\ncapacity,” as prescribed by a health care provider. 77 Fed.\nReg. at 8725 (alteration in original). The relevant regulations\nrequire coverage of the contraceptive services recommended\nin the guidelines. See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv); 29\nC.F.R.        § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv);       45       C.F.R.\n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv).\n\n\n2\n  The ACA’s preventive care requirements apply only to non-\ngrandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers\noffering non-grandfathered health insurance coverage. See 45\nC.F.R. § 147.140 (exempting “grandfathered” plans—\n“coverage provided by a group health plan, or a group or\nindividual health insurance issuer, in which an individual was\nenrolled as of March 23, 2010,” the date on which the ACA\nwas enacted “for as long as it maintains that status under the\nrules of this section”).\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\f        The implementing regulations authorize an exemption\nfrom contraceptive coverage for the group health plan of a\n“religious employer.”     45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a).        The\nregulations define a religious employer as a nonprofit\norganization described in the Internal Revenue Code\nprovision referring to churches, their integrated auxiliaries,\nand conventions or associations of churches, and the\nexclusively religious activities of any religious order. Id.\n(citing 26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii)).\n\n        After notice-and-comment rulemaking, the Department\nof the Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the Department\nof Health and Human Services (the “Departments”) published\nfinal regulations in July 2013 that provided relief for\norganizations that, while not “religious employers,”\nnonetheless oppose coverage on account of their religious\nobjections. These regulations include an “accommodation”\nfor group health plans established or maintained by “eligible\norganizations” (and group health coverage provided in\nconnection with such plans). See 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n2713A(a), 29 C.F.R. § 2590-2713A(a), 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(b); Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under\nthe Affordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870 (July 2, 2013)\n(codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. pts. 2510 & 2590; and\n45 C.F.R. pts. 147 & 156). An “eligible organization” means\na nonprofit organization that “holds itself out as a religious\norganization” and “opposes providing coverage for some or\nall of any contraceptive services required to be covered . . . on\naccount of religious objections.” 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b). To\ninvoke this accommodation, an employer must certify that it\nis such an organization. Id. § 147.131(b)(4). Here, there is\nno dispute that the nonprofit religious organization appellees\nare eligible organizations under these regulations.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\f        To take advantage of the accommodation to the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement, the eligible organization\nmust complete the self-certification form, EBSA Form 700,\nissued by the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits\nSecurity Administration, indicating that it has a religious\nobjection to providing coverage for the required contraceptive\nservices. The eligible organization then is to provide a copy\nof the form to its insurance issuer or third-party administrator.\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,875.3\n\n3\n  After these suits had been filed, the Supreme Court granted\nan injunction pending appeal in Wheaton College v. Burwell,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014), and ordered that the eligible\norganization applicant need not use EBSA Form 700 to notify\nits insurance issuer or third-party administrator of its religious\nobjection to the contraceptive coverage requirement; instead,\nif the organization notifies the government in writing of its\nobjection, the government is enjoined from enforcing the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement against the organization.\nId. at 2807. In response, interim final regulations were issued\nin August 2014 allowing an eligible organization to opt out\nby notifying HHS directly, rather than notifying its insurance\nissuer or third-party administrator; the eligible organization\nalso need not use EBSA Form 700. Coverage of Certain\nPreventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 79 Fed.\nReg. 51,092 (Aug. 27, 2014) (codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29\nC.F.R. pts. 2510 & 2590; and 45 C.F.R. pt. 147); see also 29\nC.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(1)(ii); 45 C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(c)(1)(ii).        We conclude here that the\naccommodation, even when utilizing EBSA Form 700, poses\nno substantial burden. To the extent that the Supreme Court’s\norder in Wheaton may be read to signal that the alternative\n\n\n\n\n                               15\n\f        The submission of the form has no real effect on the\nplan participants and beneficiaries. They still have access to\ncontraception, without cost sharing, through alternate\nmechanisms in the regulations.4 Under these regulations, an\neligible organization is not required “to contract, arrange, pay,\nor refer for contraceptive coverage” to which it objects on\nreligious grounds. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874. As a result, either\nthe health insurance issuer or the third-party administrator is\nrequired by regulation to provide separate payments for\ncontraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries.\nThe ACA’s prohibition on cost sharing for preventive\nservices, including contraception, bars the insurance issuer or\nthird-party administrator from imposing any premium or fee\non the group health plan, or plan participants and\nbeneficiaries. Furthermore, the accommodation prohibits the\ninsurance issuer or third-party administrator from imposing\nsuch fees on the eligible organization. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n\nnotification procedure is less burdensome than using EBSA\nForm 700, we also conclude that the alternative compliance\nmechanism set forth in the August 2014 regulations poses no\nsubstantial burden.\n4\n The Supreme Court has recognized that the accommodation\nensures that employees of entities with religious objections\nhave the same access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as\nemployees of entities without religious objections to\nproviding such coverage. “The effect of the HHS-created\naccommodation on the women employed . . . would be\nprecisely zero.

Factual Background and Procedural History7\n\n       We review here the following District Court opinions:\ntwo preliminary injunctions issued in Geneva College v.\nSebelius, and a preliminary injunction and permanent\ninjunction issued in the related cases of Most Reverend David\nA. Zubik v. Sebelius and Most Reverend Lawrence T. Persico\nv. Sebelius. The Zubik and Persico appeals were consolidated\nand now have also been consolidated with the Geneva appeal.\n\n              1. Geneva Appellee\n\n        Appellee Geneva College (“Geneva”) is a nonprofit\ninstitution of higher learning established by the Reformed\nPresbyterian Church of North America. Geneva believes that\n\n7\n  The District Courts in these cases had jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and this Court has appellate jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\fit would be sinful and immoral for it to intentionally\nparticipate in, pay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support\naccess to abortion (including emergency contraceptives Plan\nB and ella, and two intrauterine devices, all of which Geneva\ncharacterizes as causing abortion) because such participation\nviolates religious prohibitions on murder. Geneva contracts\nwith an insurance issuer for its student and employee health\ninsurance plans.\n\n              2. Geneva District Court Opinions\n\n       The District Court granted Geneva’s motion for a\npreliminary injunction with respect to its student plan on June\n18, 2013, and enjoined the government from applying or\nenforcing 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4) and requiring that\nGeneva’s student health insurance plan, its plan broker, or its\nplan insurer provide “abortifacients” contrary to Geneva’s\nreligious objections. (J.A. 35-36.) The District Court began\nby stating that the Supreme Court has cautioned courts to be\nreluctant to “dissect religious beliefs” when engaging in a\nsubstantial burden analysis. (J.A. 24 (quoting Thomas v.\nReview Bd. of Ind. Emp’t Sec. Div., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110440\"><a href=\"/opinion/110440/thomas-v-review-bd-of-indiana-employment-security-div/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715\n(1981)).)\n       The District Court concluded that Geneva had shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits with respect to the\npresence of a substantial burden under RFRA and found that\nthree Supreme Court free exercise cases supported Geneva’s\nargument regarding the presence of a substantial burden\nunder RFRA. First, it noted that in Yoder, 406 U.S. at 234-\n35, a state compulsory education law for children up to age\nsixteen, with a penalty of a criminal fine, violated the free\nexercise rights of the Amish plaintiffs. Second, in Sherbert,\n374 U.S. at 410, the state could not withhold unemployment\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\fbenefits from a worker who refused employment on the\ngrounds that working Saturdays violated her religious beliefs.\nThird, in Thomas, 450 U.S. at 719, the state could not deny\nunemployment benefits to a worker whose religious beliefs\nforbade his participation in manufacturing tanks for use by\nthe military. The District Court interpreted these cases as\nstanding for the proposition that these indirect burdens on\nreligious exercise are substantial enough to be cognizable\nunder RFRA. The District Court concluded that Geneva had\nonly two choices under the regulations—either provide the\nobjected-to coverage or drop its health insurance—and by\nbeing forced to choose between those two options, both\nrepugnant to its religious beliefs,8 Geneva faced a substantial\nburden.\n       The District Court then granted Geneva’s second\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, this time with respect to\n\n8\n  We recognize that the appellees believe providing health\ninsurance to their employees and students is part of their\nreligious commitments. The appellees urge, at most, that\ndropping their health insurance coverage would be a violation\nof their moral beliefs, but they do not argue that it would be,\nin and of itself, another substantial burden imposed on their\nreligious exercise. (Geneva Br. at 5 (“To fulfill its religious\ncommitments and duties in the Christ-centered educational\ncontext, the College promotes the spiritual and physical well-\nbeing and health of its employees and students. This includes\nthe provision of general health insurance to employees and\ntheir dependants and the facilitation of a student health\nplan.”); Zubik/Persico Br. at 6 (“As part of overseeing their\naffiliates and as part of Catholic social teaching, the Dioceses\nprovide self-insured health plans for Diocesan entities,\nincluding the Affiliates.”).)\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\fits employee plan, on December 23, 2013. The District Court\nagain enjoined the government from enforcing 42 U.S.C. §\n300gg-13(a)(4) and requiring that Geneva’s employee health\ninsurance plan, its plan broker, or its plan insurer provide\n“abortifacients” contrary to Geneva’s religious objections.\n(J.A. 67-68.) The District Court concluded that Geneva had\nshown a likelihood of success on the merits as to the presence\nof a substantial burden because the self-certification process\nforced Geneva to facilitate access to services it finds\nreligiously objectionable.        First, the District Court\nemphasized that a court must assess the intensity of the\ncoercion and pressure from the government, rather than\nlooking at the merits of the religious belief.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014)).) The District Court\nanalogized to cases involving the contraceptive coverage\nmandate for entities not eligible for the accommodation, such\nas the Hobby Lobby opinion in the Court of Appeals for the\nTenth Circuit, which found that the substantial fines and\npenalties imposed on an entity that refused to offer health\ncare coverage to its employees at all, or refused to provide\ncoverage for the mandated preventive services, constituted a\nsubstantial burden.\n\n       The District Court was convinced by Geneva’s\nexplanation that, although Geneva must engage in the same\nconduct that it did before the ACA—namely, notify the\ninsurance carrier that it would not provide coverage for the\nobjected-to services—the effect of that conduct is now\ndifferent. Before the ACA, Geneva’s notification resulted in\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\fits employees being unable to obtain coverage for\ncontraceptive services; after the ACA, Geneva’s employees\nare still provided access to the services as a matter of law.\n“Under the ACA, Geneva has two choices: (1) provide\ninsurance coverage to its employees, which will result in\ncoverage for the objected to services; or (2) refuse to provide\ninsurance coverage for its employees, which will result in\nfines, harm to its employees’ well-being and competitive\ndisadvantages. Both options require Geneva to act contrary\nto its religious duties and beliefs.” (J.A. 61 n.12.)\n\n       Geneva argues that the District Court was correct that\na substantial burden is present here because (1) complying\nwith either the contraceptive coverage requirement or the\naccommodation would cause Geneva to “trigger,” “facilitate,”\nor be “complicit” in the commission of acts that it likens to\nabortion; and (2) the fines that Geneva faces for its refusal to\ncomply with the contraceptive coverage requirement or the\naccommodation would pressure it to conform.\n              3. Zubik/Persico Appellees\n\n       Appellees in the Zubik and Persico cases include: the\nBishop of Pittsburgh, David A. Zubik, and the Bishop of Erie,\nLawrence T. Persico; the Diocese of Pittsburgh and the\nDiocese of Erie, both of which qualify for the exemption to\nthe contraceptive coverage requirement under 45 C.F.R. §\n147.131(a); and Catholic Charities of the Diocese of\nPittsburgh, Prince of Peace Center, St. Martin Center, and\nErie Catholic Cathedral Preparatory School, which are all\nnonprofit organizations affiliated with the Catholic Church.\nThe Catholic religious nonprofit organizations are controlled\nby their respective Dioceses and operate in accordance with\nCatholic doctrine and teachings. The Bishops oversee the\n\n\n\n\n                              24\n\fmanagement of the affiliated nonprofits with regard to\nadherence to Catholic doctrine. The Catholic faith prohibits\nproviding, subsidizing, initiating, or facilitating insurance\ncoverage for sterilization services, contraceptives, other drugs\nthat the Catholic Church believes to cause abortion, and\nrelated reproductive educational and counseling services.\nThe Dioceses provide self-insured health plans to the\nnonprofits and contract with third-party administrators to\nhandle claims administration of the plans. As a result of their\nprovision of coverage to the nonprofits, the Dioceses, which\nare otherwise exempt, must comply with the contraceptive\ncoverage requirement as to the nonprofits.\n\n              4. Zubik/Persico District Court Opinions\n\n        The District Court issued a preliminary injunction that\napplied to both the Zubik and Persico cases on November 21,\n2013, and converted that injunction into a permanent\ninjunction on December 20, 2013.\n        The District Court characterized the issue before it as\n“whether [the appellees], being non-secular in nature, are\nlikely to succeed on the merits of proving that their right to\nfreely exercise their religion has been substantially burdened\nby the ‘accommodation’ which requires the Bishops of two\nseparate Dioceses . . . to sign a form which thereby\nfacilitates/initiates the provision of contraceptive products,\nservices, and counseling.” (J.A. 116.) The Zubik/Persico\nappellees conceded that they have provided similar\ninformation as is required by the self-certification form to\ntheir third-party administrator in the past. However, their past\nactions barred the provision of contraceptive products,\nservices, or counseling.        Now, under the ACA, this\ninformation will be used to “facilitate/initiate the provision of\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fcontraceptive products, services, or counseling – in direct\ncontravention to their religious tenets.” (Id.) Accordingly,\nthe District Court concluded that the government is\nimpermissibly asking the appellees for documentation for\nwhat the appellees sincerely believe is an immoral purpose,\nand thus “they cannot provide it.” (J.A. 117.) In conclusion,\nthe District Court acknowledged that the accommodation\nallows the appellees to avoid directly paying for contraceptive\nservices by shifting responsibility for providing contraceptive\ncoverage. Despite this fact, because the appellees had a\nsincerely held belief that this shift in responsibility did not\nexonerate them from the moral implications of the use of\ncontraception, the accommodation imposed a substantial\nburden.\n\n       Furthermore, the District Court held that the differing\napplication of the exemption and the accommodation—the\nformer applying to the Catholic Church, and the latter\napplying to Catholic nonprofit organizations—has the effect\nof dividing the Catholic Church, thereby imposing a\nsubstantial    burden.        “[T]he   religious    employer\n‘accommodation’ separates the ‘good works (faith in action)\nemployers’ from the ‘houses of worship employers’ within\nthe Catholic Church by refusing to allow the ‘good works\nemployers’ the same burden-free exercise of their religion”\nunder the exemption. (J.A. 118.) The District Court\nquestioned why religious employers who share the same\nreligious tenets are not exempt, or why all religious\nemployers do not fall within the accommodation, such that\n“even though [the appellees] here share identical, religious\nbeliefs, and even though they share the same persons as the\nreligious heads of their organizations, the heads of [the\nappellees’] service organizations may not fully exercise their\n\n\n\n\n                              26\n\fright to those specific beliefs, when acting as the heads of the\ncharitable and educational arms of the Church.” (J.A. 118,\n120.) The District Court concluded that “the religious\nemployer ‘exemption’ enables some religious employers to\ncompletely eliminate the provision of contraceptive products,\nservices, and counseling through the Dioceses’ health plans\nand third parties,” whereas “the religious employer\n‘accommodation’ requires other religious employers (often\ntimes the same member with the same sincerely-held beliefs)\nto take affirmative actions to facilitate/initiate the provision of\ncontraceptive products, services, and counseling – albeit from\na third-party.” (J.A. 120-21.)\n\n       The Zubik/Persico appellees argue that the District\nCourt was correct in finding a substantial burden because (1)\nthey interpret the accommodation to require them to authorize\nand designate a third party to add the objectionable coverage\nto their plans, in violation of their sincerely held religious\nbeliefs that they cannot provide or facilitate that coverage;\nand (2) the different scope of the religious employer\nexemption and the accommodation impermissibly splits the\nCatholic Church.\n\n        The government, as appellant in both the\nZubik/Persico and Geneva appeals, argues that the District\nCourts were incorrect and the appellees are not subject to a\nsubstantial burden, because the submission of the form is not\nin itself burdensome and does not give rise to the coverage.\nRather, federal law requires third parties—insurance issuers\nand third-party administrators—to provide coverage after the\nappellees refuse to provide contraceptive coverage\nthemselves. By invoking the accommodation process, the\nappellees do not facilitate the provision of contraceptive\n\n\n\n\n                                27\n\fcoverage by third parties. Rather, the third parties providing\ncoverage do so as a result of legal obligations imposed by the\nACA.\n\n                     II.   DISCUSSION\n\n    A.

The\nappellees conceded at oral argument that the mere act of\ncompleting EBSA Form 700 does not impose a burden on\ntheir religious exercise.\n\n       The appellees’ essential challenge is that providing the\nself-certification form to the insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator “triggers” the provision of the contraceptive\ncoverage to their employees and students. The appellees\nreframed this proposition at oral argument, stating that the\naccommodation requires them to be “complicit” in sin.\nAppellees urge that there is a causal link between providing\nnotification of their religious objection to providing\ncontraceptive coverage and the offering of contraceptive\ncoverage by a third party. That link, they argue, makes them\ncomplicit in the provision of certain forms of contraception,\nwhich is prohibited by their religious beliefs.\n\n       Without testing the appellees’ religious beliefs, we\nmust nonetheless objectively assess whether the appellees’\ncompliance with the self-certification procedure does, in fact,\ntrigger, facilitate, or make them complicit in the provision of\n\n\n\n\n                              29\n\fcontraceptive coverage. Through RFRA’s adoption of the\nSupreme Court’s pre-Smith free exercise jurisprudence,\nCongress has required qualitative assessment of the merits of\nthe appellees’ RFRA claims.

Lappin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187263\"><a href=\"/opinion/187263/kaemmerling-v-lappin/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2008),\n“[a]ccept[ed] as true the factual allegations that\nKaemmerling’s beliefs are sincere and of a religious nature—\nbut not the legal conclusion, cast as a factual allegations, that\nhis religious exercise is substantially burdened.” The court\nfurther explained: “we conclude that Kaemmerling does not\nallege facts sufficient to state a substantial burden on his\n\n\n\n\n                               31\n\freligious exercise because he cannot identify any ‘exercise’\nwhich is the subject of the burden to which he objects.” Id.11\n\n        The Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby evaluated whether\nthe requirement to provide contraceptive coverage absent the\naccommodation procedure substantially burdened the\nreligious exercise of the owners of closely-held, for-profit\ncorporations. The issue of whether there is an actual burden\nwas easily resolved in Hobby Lobby, since there was little\ndoubt that the actual provision of services did render the\nplaintiffs “complicit.” And in Hobby Lobby, the Court came\nto its conclusion that, without any accommodation, the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement imposed a substantial\nburden on the religious exercise of the for-profit corporations,\nbecause those plaintiffs were required to either provide health\ninsurance that included contraceptive coverage, in violation\nof their religious beliefs, or pay substantial fines.12 See 134\n11\n    The Zubik/Persico appellees argue that we should not\nindependently analyze the burdens imposed on them, or the\nsubstantiality of that burden, because the government\nstipulated to facts contained in the appellees’ declarations—\nparticularly, that the appellees believe that participation in the\naccommodation, including signing the self-certification form,\nfacilitates moral evil in violation of Catholic doctrine. The\nappellees are mistaken, because the government’s factual\nstipulation does not preclude this Court from determining the\ncontours of the asserted burden or whether the burden is\nsubstantial.\n12\n   Indeed, Justice Alito’s majority opinion in Hobby Lobby\ncomments favorably on the accommodation procedure at\nissue here, which separates an eligible organization from the\nobjected-to contraceptive services:\n\n\n\n\n                               32\n\fHHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its\ndisposal an approach that is less restrictive than\nrequiring employers to fund contraceptive\nmethods that violate their religious beliefs. As\nwe explained above, HHS has already\nestablished an accommodation for nonprofit\norganizations with religious objections. Under\nthat accommodation, the organization can self-\ncertify that it opposes providing coverage for\nparticular contraceptive services.         If the\norganization makes such a certification, the\norganization’s insurance issuer or third-party\nadministrator must “[e]xpressly exclude\ncontraceptive coverage from the group health\ninsurance coverage provided in connection with\nthe group health plan” and “[p]rovide separate\npayments for any contraceptive services\nrequired to be covered” without imposing “any\ncost-sharing requirements . . . on the eligible\norganization, the group health plan, or plan\nparticipants          or           beneficiaries.”\n\n       We do not decide today whether an\napproach of this type complies with RFRA for\npurposes of all religious claims. At a minimum,\nhowever, it does not impinge on the plaintiffs’\nreligious belief that providing insurance\ncoverage for the contraceptives at issue here\nviolates their religion, and it serves HHS’s\nstated       interests        equally      well.\n\n\n\n\n                       33\n\fS. Ct. at 2775-76; see also Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 245.\nHere, the appellees are not faced with a “provide” or “pay”\ndilemma because they have a third option—notification\npursuant to the accommodation—to avoid both providing\ncontraceptive coverage to their employees and facing\npenalties for noncompliance with the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement.\n\n        The appellees urge that a burden exists here because\nthe submission of the self-certification form triggers,\nfacilitates, and makes them complicit in the provision of\nobjected-to services. But after testing that assertion, we\ncannot agree that the submission of the self-certification form\nhas the effect the appellees claim. First, the self-certification\nform does not trigger or facilitate the provision of\ncontraceptive coverage because coverage is mandated to be\notherwise provided by federal law. Federal law, rather than\nany involvement by the appellees in filling out or submitting\nthe self-certification form, creates the obligation of the\ninsurance issuers and third-party administrators to provide\ncoverage for contraceptive services. As Judge Posner has\nexplained, this is not a situation where the self-certification\nform enables the provision of the very contraceptive services\nthat the appellees find sinful. Rather, “[f]ederal law, not the\nreligious organization’s signing and mailing the form,\nrequires health-care insurers, along with third-party\nadministrators of self-insured plans, to cover contraceptive\nservices.” Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 554. Thus, federal law,\nnot the submission of the self-certification form, enables the\nprovision of contraceptive coverage.\n\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2782 (alterations in original)\n(footnotes omitted) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                               34\n\f       The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit adopted\nJudge Posner’s logic that the obligation to cover\ncontraception is not triggered by the act of self-certification.\nRather, it is triggered by the force of law—the ACA and its\nimplementing regulations. See Mich. Catholic Conference,\n755 F.3d at 387 (“Submitting the self-certification form to the\ninsurance issuer or third-party administrator does not ‘trigger’\ncontraceptive coverage; it is federal law that requires the\ninsurance issuer or the third-party administrator to provide\nthis coverage.”). Most recently, and after the Supreme\nCourt’s opinion in Hobby Lobby, the Court of Appeals for the\nD.C. Circuit agreed with these courts’ explanations of the\nmechanics of the accommodation. See Priests for Life, 772\nF.3d at 252 (“As the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have also\nconcluded, the insurers’ or [the third-party administrators’]\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage originates from\nthe ACA and its attendant regulations, not from Plaintiffs’\nself-certification or alternative notice.”). Thus, submitting the\nself-certification form means only that the eligible\norganization is not providing contraceptive coverage and will\nnot be subjected to penalties. By participating in the\naccommodation, the eligible organization has no role\nwhatsoever in the provision of the objected-to contraceptive\nservices.13\n\n13\n  Geneva argues that there is no guarantee that its employees\nand students would obtain the objected-to contraceptive\ncoverage if they were not enrolled in Geneva’s health plans.\nTherefore, Geneva asserts, the obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage arises only because it sponsors an\nemployee or student health plan. Geneva cites the following\npassage from Notre Dame in support: “By refusing to fill out\n\n\n\n\n                               35\n\f        Moreover, the regulations specific to the Zubik and\nPersico appellees’ self-insured plan are no different in this\nrespect, and in no way cause the appellees to facilitate or\ntrigger the provision of contraceptive coverage. Those\nDepartment of Labor regulations state that EBSA Form 700\n“shall be treated as a designation of the third party\nadministrator as the plan administrator under section 3(16) of\nERISA for any contraceptive services required to be\ncovered.” 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b). The Zubik/Persico\nappellees argue that these regulations cause it to “facilitate”\nthe provision of contraceptives because the signed self-\ncertification form authorizes the third-party administrator to\nserve as the plan administrator. However, this purported\n\n\nthe form Notre Dame would subject itself to penalties, but\nAetna and Meritain would still be required by federal law to\nprovide the services to the university’s students and\nemployees unless and until their contractual relation with\nNotre Dame terminated.” 743 F.3d at 554 (emphasis added).\nHowever, Geneva’s argument is unavailing. The provision of\ncontraceptive coverage is not dependent upon Geneva’s\ncontract with its insurance company. “Once [the appellees]\nopt out of the contraceptive coverage requirement, . . .\ncontraceptive services are not provided to women because of\n[the appellees’] contracts with insurance companies; they are\nprovided because federal law requires insurers and TPAs to\nprovide insurance beneficiaries with coverage for\ncontraception.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 253. “RFRA\ndoes not entitle [the appellees] to control their employees’\nrelationships with other entities willing to provide health\ninsurance coverage to which the employees are legally\nentitled.” Id. at 256.\n\n\n\n\n                              36\n\fcausal connection is nonexistent. The eligible organization\nhas no effect on the designation of the plan administrator;\ninstead, it is the government that treats and designates the\nthird-party administrator as the plan administrator under\nERISA. See Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 555. “[The appellees]\nsubmit forms to communicate their decisions to opt out, not to\nauthorize [the third-party administrators] to do anything on\ntheir behalf. The regulatory treatment of the form as\nsufficient under ERISA does not change the reality that the\nobjected-to services are made available because of the\nregulations, not because [the appellees] complete a self-\ncertification.” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at 254-55. Indeed,\nthis “opt-out” is just that—an indication that the eligible\norganization chooses not to provide coverage for the\nobjected-to services.\n\n       Moreover, the submission of the self-certification form\ndoes not make the appellees “complicit” in the provision of\ncontraceptive coverage. If anything, because the appellees\nspecifically state on the self-certification form that they object\non religious grounds to providing such coverage, it is a\ndeclaration that they will not be complicit in providing\ncoverage. Ultimately, the regulatory notice requirement does\nnot necessitate any action that interferes with the appellees’\nreligious activities. “The organization must send a single\nsheet of paper honestly communicating its eligibility and\nsincere religious objection in order to be excused from the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement.” Id. at 249. The\nappellees “need only reaffirm [their] religiously based\nopposition to providing contraceptive coverage, at which\npoint third parties will provide the coverage separate and\napart from [the appellees’] plan of benefits.” Priests for Life\nv.

The appellees’ real objection is to what happens\nafter the form is provided—that is, to the actions of the\ninsurance issuers and the third-party administrators, required\nby law, once the appellees give notice of their objection.\n“RFRA does not grant [the appellees] a religious veto against\nplan providers’ compliance with those regulations, nor the\nright to enlist the government to effectuate such a religious\nveto against legally required conduct of third parties.” Priests\nfor Life, 772 F.3d at 251. “The fact that the regulations\nrequire the insurance issuers and third-party administrators to\nmodify their behavior does not demonstrate a substantial\nburden on the [appellees].” Mich. Catholic Conference, 755\nF.3d at 389.14\n\n14\n     A hypothetical example serves as a useful tool to\ndemonstrate the fallacy in the appellees’ characterization of\nthe accommodation: Assume that a person, John Doe, has a\njob that requires twenty-four-hour coverage, such as an\nemergency room doctor or nurse. John Doe is unable to work\nhis shift on a certain Tuesday, as that day is a religious\nholiday that mandates a day of rest. As a result, John Doe\nbelieves that it is inappropriate for anyone to work on that\nholiday. John Doe can request time off by filling out a certain\nform, but he will be penalized if he fails to show up for work\nwithout appropriately requesting time off. However, by\nfilling out this form, he believes that he will facilitate or\ntrigger or be complicit in someone else working in his place\non the religious holiday. John Doe sincerely believes that the\nsimple filling out of the time-off request imposes a substantial\nburden on his religious beliefs. In this example, John Doe,\nlike the appellees, is able to express his religious objection to\nworking on a religious holiday by declining to work that day.\n\n\n\n\n                               38\n\f       Thus, we cannot agree with the appellees’\ncharacterization of the effect of submitting the form as\ntriggering, facilitating, or making them complicit in the\nprovision of contraceptive coverage. At oral argument, the\nappellees argued that it was not merely the filing of the form\nthat imposed a burden, but, rather, what follows from it. But\nfree exercise jurisprudence instructs that we are to examine\nthe act the appellees must perform—not the effect of that\nact—to see if it burdens substantially the appellees’ religious\nexercise. The Supreme Court has consistently rejected the\nargument that an independent obligation on a third party can\n\n\nJohn Doe’s time-off request indicates that he will not be\ncomplicit in working on the religious holiday. Furthermore,\ndeclining to work on that Tuesday does not serve as a trigger\nor facilitator because one of his other colleagues will be\nforced to work that day, regardless of whether John Doe\nworks or not. However, just because John Doe does not wish\nto be associated with or play any role in the result (working\non a religious holiday), does not mean the conduct to which\nhe objects (filling out the time-off request form) substantially\nburdens his free exercise of religion. Just as we cannot\nconclude that John Doe’s religious exercise is being burdened\nby filling out the form, we cannot conclude that the appellees’\nreligious exercise is burdened by filling out the self-\ncertification form.       Furthermore, any “coercive” force\nattached to John Doe’s refusal to fill out the time-off request\nis similar to the fines that the appellees face if they refuse to\neither participate in the accommodation or provide\ncontraceptive coverage. In any event, such “coercive” force\nis relevant only if the conduct itself actually does substantially\nburden one’s religious exercise. That is not the case in this\nanalogy, and it is not the case for the appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                               39\n\fimpose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion in\nviolation of RFRA, as we discuss below. Pre-Smith free\nexercise cases, which RFRA was crafted to resurrect, have\ndistinguished between what a challenged law requires the\nobjecting parties to do, and what it permits another party—\nspecifically, the government—to do.\n\n         In Bowen, the Supreme Court determined that the Free\nExercise Clause did not require the government to\naccommodate a religiously based objection to the statutory\nrequirement that a Social Security number be provided to\napplicants for certain welfare benefits. Roy, a Native\nAmerican, argued that the government’s use of his daughter’s\nSocial Security number would “‘rob the spirit’ of his daughter\nand prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power.” 476\nU.S. at 696. Roy’s claim was unsuccessful because “[t]he\nFederal Government’s use of a Social Security number\nfor . . . [his daughter] d[id] not itself in any degree impair\nRoy’s ‘freedom to believe, express, and exercise’ his\nreligion.” Id. at 700. Rather, Roy was attempting to use the\nFree Exercise Clause to dictate how the government should\ntransact its business.\n\n      Never to our knowledge has the Court\n      interpreted the First Amendment to require the\n      Government itself to behave in ways that the\n      individual believes will further his or her\n      spiritual development or that of his or her\n      family. The Free Exercise Clause simply\n      cannot be understood to require the Government\n      to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that\n      comport with the religious beliefs of particular\n      citizens. Just as the Government may not insist\n\n\n\n\n                             40\n\f       that appellees engage in any set form of\n       religious observance, so appellees may not\n       demand that the Government join in their\n       chosen religious practices by refraining from\n       using a number to identify their daughter.\n       “[T]he Free Exercise Clause is written in terms\n       of what the government cannot do to the\n       individual, not in terms of what the individual\n       can extract from the government.” . . . The Free\n       Exercise Clause affords an individual protection\n       from      certain    forms    of    governmental\n       compulsion; it does not afford an individual a\n       right to dictate the conduct of the Government’s\n       internal procedures.\n\nId. at 699-700 (quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 412 (Douglas,\nJ., concurring)).\n\n        And, echoing the principles of Bowen, in Lyng,\nmembers of Native American tribes claimed that the federal\ngovernment violated their rights under the Free Exercise\nClause by permitting timber harvesting and construction on\nland used for religious purposes. 485 U.S. at 441-42. The\nSupreme Court concluded that the Free Exercise Clause “does\nnot and cannot imply that incidental effects of government\nprograms, which may make it more difficult to practice\ncertain religions but which have no tendency to coerce\nindividuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs,\nrequire government to bring forward a compelling\njustification for its otherwise lawful actions.” Id. at 450-51.\n\n      Building on this line of cases, the Court of Appeals for\nthe D.C. Circuit concluded that a federal prisoner failed to\n\n\n\n\n                              41\n\fstate a RFRA claim when he sought to enjoin application of\nthe DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act on the basis that\nDNA sampling, storage, and collection without limitations\nviolated his religious beliefs about the proper use of the\n“building blocks of life.” Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 674.\nKaemmerling could not state a claim that his religious\nexercise was substantially burdened because he did not\nidentify any religious exercise that was subjected to the\nburden to which he objected:\n\n      The government’s extraction, analysis, and\n      storage of Kaemmerling’s DNA information\n      does not call for Kaemmerling to modify his\n      religious behavior in any way—it involves no\n      action or forbearance on his part, nor does it\n      otherwise interfere with any religious act in\n      which he engages. Although the government’s\n      activities with his fluid or tissue sample after\n      the BOP takes it may offend Kaemmerling’s\n      religious beliefs, they cannot be said to hamper\n      his religious exercise because they do not\n      “pressure [him] to modify his behavior and to\n      violate his beliefs.”\n\nId. at 679 (alteration in original) (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S.\nat 718). “Like the parents in Bowen, Kaemmerling’s\nopposition to government collection and storage of his DNA\nprofile does not contend that any act of the government\npressures him to change his behavior and violate his religion,\nbut only seeks to require the government itself to conduct its\naffairs in conformance with his religion.” Id. at 680.\n\n\n\n\n                             42\n\f        Thus, the case law clearly draws a distinction between\nwhat the law may impose on a person over religious\nobjections, and what it permits or requires a third party to do.\nAlthough that person may have a religious objection to what\nthe government, or another third party, does with something\nthat the law requires to be provided (whether it be a Social\nSecurity number, DNA, or a form that states that the person\nreligiously objects to providing contraceptive coverage),\nRFRA does not necessarily permit that person to impose a\nrestraint on another’s action based on the claim that the action\nis religiously abhorrent.\n\n       These cases confirm that we can, indeed should,\nexamine the nature and degree of the asserted burden to\ndecide whether it amounts to a substantial burden under\nRFRA. Furthermore, we must assess how the objected-to\naction relates to the appellees’ religious exercise, and whether\nthe appellees’ objections focus on the action itself or the\nresult of the action, i.e., the obligations placed upon a third\nparty.\n\n       Far from “triggering” the provision of contraceptive\ncoverage to the appellees’ employees and students, EBSA\nForm 700 totally removes the appellees from providing those\nservices. “[T]he regulations provide an opt-out mechanism\nthat shifts to third parties the obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage to which health insurance\nbeneficiaries are entitled, and that fastidiously relieves [the\nappellees] of any obligation to contract, arrange, pay, or refer\nfor access to contraception . . . .” Priests for Life, 772 F.3d at\n252.     The self-certification form requires the eligible\norganization or its plan to provide a copy to the\norganization’s insurance issuer or third-party administrator in\n\n\n\n\n                               43\n\forder for the plan to be administered in accordance with both\nthe eligible organization’s religious objection and the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement. The ACA already takes\ninto account beliefs like those of the appellees and\naccommodates them. “The accommodation in this case\nconsists in the organization’s . . . washing its hands of any\ninvolvement in contraceptive coverage, and the insurer and\nthe third-party administrator taking up the slack under\ncompulsion of federal law.” Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 557.\nThe regulations accommodate the interests of religious\ninstitutions that provide health services, while not curtailing\nthe public interest that motivates the federally mandated\nrequirement that such services shall be provided to women\nfree of charge. Id. at 551.\n\n       Because we find that the self-certification procedure\ndoes not cause or trigger the provision of contraceptive\ncoverage, appellees are unable to show that their religious\nexercise is burdened. Even if we were to conclude that there\nis a burden imposed on the appellees’ religious exercise, we\nwould be hard-pressed to find that it is substantial. Whether a\nburden is “substantial” under RFRA is a question of law, not\na question of fact. See Mahoney v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219205\"><a href=\"/opinion/219205/mahoney-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1121\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). RFRA’s reference to “substantial” burdens\nexpressly calls for a qualitative assessment of the burden that\nthe accommodation imposes on the appellees’ exercise of\nreligion. Korte, 735 F.3d at 705 (Rovner, J., dissenting).\nRFRA calls for a threshold inquiry into the nature of the\nburden placed on the appellees’ free exercise of religion:\n“substantial” is a term of degree that invites the courts to\ndistinguish between different types of burdens. Id. at 708.\n\n\n\n\n                              44\n\f       We have stated that a substantial burden exists where\n(1) “a follower is forced to choose between following the\nprecepts of his religion and forfeiting benefits otherwise\ngenerally available to other [persons] versus abandoning one\nof the precepts of his religion in order to receive a benefit”; or\n(2) “the government puts substantial pressure on an adherent\nto substantially modify his behavior and to violate his\nbeliefs.” See Washington v. Klem, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1275953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1275953/washington-v-klem/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (3d Cir.\n2007) (interpreting a related statute, the Religious Land Use\nand Institutionalized Persons Act, which applies to prisoner\nand land use cases). However, a government action does not\nconstitute a substantial burden, even if the challenged action\n“would interfere significantly with private persons’ ability to\npursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own religious\nbeliefs,” if the government action does not coerce the\nindividuals to violate their religious beliefs or deny them “the\nrights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.”\nLyng, 485 U.S. at 449. Under this definition, can the\nsubmission of the self-certification form, which relieves the\nappellees of any connection to the provision of the objected-\nto contraceptive services, really impose a “substantial”\nburden on the appellees’ free exercise of religion? We think\nnot. While Hobby Lobby rejected the argument that the\nburden was too attenuated because the actual use of the\nobjected-to contraceptive methods was a matter of individual\nchoice, here, where the actual provision of contraceptive\ncoverage is by a third party, the burden is not merely\nattenuated at the outset but totally disconnected from the\nappellees.\n\n       The reasoning of the District Courts was misguided in\ntwo ways. First, the District Courts accepted the appellees’\ncharacterization of the accommodation as causing them to\n\n\n\n\n                               45\n\f“facilitate,” act as the “central cog,” or serve as the\n“necessary stimulus” for the provision of the objected-to\ncontraceptive services. (J.A. 60-61.) For the reasons we have\ndetailed, we cannot accept that characterization as a matter of\nfact or law. Second, the District Courts focused on the\ncoercive effect, i.e., the fact that the appellees faced a choice:\nsubmit the self-certification form and “facilitate” the\nprovision of contraceptive coverage, or pay fines for\nnoncompliance. However, now that we have dispelled the\nnotion that the self-certification procedure is burdensome, we\nneed not consider whether the burden is substantial, which\ninvolves consideration of the intensity of the coercion faced\nby the appellees. We will accordingly reverse the challenged\ninjunctions.\n\n              2. Dividing the Catholic Church Argument\n\n                  in Zubik/Persico\n\n        The appellees in Zubik/Persico argue that a second\nsubstantial burden is imposed on their religious exercise in\nthat the contraceptive coverage regulatory scheme improperly\npartitions the Catholic Church by making the Dioceses\neligible for the exemption, while the Catholic nonprofits can\nonly qualify for the accommodation, even though all the\nCatholic entities share the same religious beliefs. The District\nCourt agreed with the appellees and concluded that the\ncontraceptive mandate “would cause a division between the\nDioceses and their nonprofit, religious affiliated/related\nspiritual/charitable/educational organizations which fulfill\nportions of Dioceses’ mission. Further, any nonprofit,\nreligious affiliated/related organizations expelled from the\nDioceses’ health insurance plans would require significant\n\n\n\n\n                               46\n\frestructuring of the plans which would adversely affect the\nbenefits received from pooling resources.” (J.A. 76 (citation\nomitted).) We conclude that the inclusion of houses of\nworship in the exemption and religious nonprofits in the\naccommodation does not impose a substantial burden on the\nZubik/Persico appellees.\n\n       The definition of a “religious employer” who receives\nan exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement\nunder the regulations is based on longstanding Internal\nRevenue Code provisions. See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a) (citing\n26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii)). “[R]eligious employers,\ndefined as in the cited regulation, have long enjoyed\nadvantages (notably tax advantages) over other entities,\nwithout these advantages being thought to violate the\nestablishment clause.” Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 560 (citation\nomitted) (citing Walz v. Tax Comm’n of N.Y., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108135\"><a href=\"/opinion/108135/walz-v-tax-commn-of-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n666, 672-73 (1970)). The Departments chose this definition\nfrom the Internal Revenue Code to categorize the entities\nsubject to the exemption and the accommodation because that\nprovision was a bright line that was already statutorily\ncodified and frequently applied: “The Departments believe\nthat the simplified and clarified definition of religious\nemployer continues to respect the religious interests of houses\nof worship and their integrated auxiliaries in a way that does\nnot undermine the governmental interests furthered by the\ncontraceptive coverage requirement.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874;\nsee also Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\nAffordable Care Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 8456, 8461 (proposed Feb.\n6, 2013) (codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. pt. 2590, and\n45 C.F.R. pts. 147, 148, & 156) (“[T]his definition was\nintended to focus the religious employer exemption on ‘the\nunique relationship between a house of worship and its\n\n\n\n\n                              47\n\femployees in ministerial positions.’” (quoting Group Health\nPlans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of\nPreventive Services Under the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3,\n2011) (codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 54; 29 C.F.R. pt. 2590; and\n45 C.F.R. pt. 147))).\n\n        Furthermore, we are not persuaded that the challenged\naccommodation poses any burden on the exempted appellees’\nreligious exercise, particularly a burden that would require the\nappellees to “expel” the religious nonprofit organizations\nfrom the Dioceses’ health insurance plans. See, e.g., Roman\nCatholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">232</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“First, it is not at all clear why the\nDiocesan plaintiffs would have to ‘expel’ their non-exempt\naffiliates from their health plans. . . . Second, even if the law\ndid pressure the Diocesan plaintiffs to ‘expel’ their affiliates,\nplaintiffs do not state that the Diocesan plaintiffs’ religious\nbeliefs require them to have all their affiliate organizations on\na single health plan, such that ‘expelling’ the non-exempt\naffiliates would be an act forbidden by their religion.”).\n\n       Thus, we cannot agree that the different treatment\nafforded to the Catholic Church as a house worship versus the\nCatholic nonprofit organizations imposes a substantial burden\nin violation of RFRA.\n\n                   III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       We will reverse the District Courts’ orders granting the\nchallenged injunctions. Because we conclude that the\nappellees have not shown a likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their RFRA claim, based on the determination that\n\n\n\n\n                               48\n\fthe accommodation does not impose a substantial burden on\ntheir religious exercise, we need not reach the question of\nwhether the accommodation is the least restrictive means of\nfurthering a compelling governmental interest.\n\n\n\n\n                            49\n\f</pre>",
