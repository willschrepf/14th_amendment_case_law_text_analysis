Koeltl, Judge) for various crimes arising from their\n\n13   contacts with and behavior relating to government restrictions on\n\n14   communications and other contacts with Sheikh Omar Ahmad Ali\n\n15   Abdel Rahman.   Rahman is serving a life sentence in a maximum\n\n16   security prison for terrorism-related crimes of seditious\n\n17   conspiracy, solicitation of murder, solicitation of an attack on\n\n18   American military installations, conspiracy to murder, and a\n\n19   conspiracy to bomb.    He is subject to \"Special Administrative\n\n20   Measures\" (\"SAMs\") restricting his ability to communicate with\n\n21   persons outside of the prison in which he is incarcerated so as\n\n22   to prevent him from continuing to lead terrorist organizations\n\n23   and their members.    The government cross-appeals from the\n\n24   defendants' sentences.\n\n25             We would be remiss if we did not, at the outset,\n\n26   commend the district court for its thoroughness, thoughtfulness,\n\n27   and effectiveness in the conduct of these unusually lengthy,\n\n28   difficult, and sensitive proceedings.    Much of what follows\n\n29   simply reports what it did and tracks what it said.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f1              We affirm the judgments of conviction.   We also affirm\n\n2    the sentences of Yousry and Sattar.   We remand the case, however,\n\n3    with respect to the sentence of Stewart, and also with respect to\n\n4    the sentences of Yousry and Sattar in light of the resentencing\n\n5    of Stewart.\n\n6              In particular, we affirm the judgments as to each\n\n7    defendant's conviction of conspiring to defraud the United\n\n8    States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, by violating SAMs\n\n9    imposed upon Abdel Rahman.   Contrary to the defendants'\n\n10   arguments, the evidence is sufficient to sustain these\n\n11   convictions.   Moreover, we reject both Stewart's argument that,\n\n12   as a lawyer, she was not bound by the SAMs, and her belated\n\n13   argument collaterally attacking their constitutionality.\n\n14             We affirm as to Sattar's conviction of conspiring to\n\n15   murder persons in a foreign country in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n16   § 956, and his conviction of soliciting persons to commit crimes\n\n17   of violence -- viz., murder and conspiracy to commit murder -- in\n\n18   violation of 18 U.S.C. § 373.   We conclude that the evidence is\n\n19   sufficient to sustain these convictions, especially in light of\n\n20   testimony establishing that Sattar attempted to undermine a\n\n21   unilateral cease-fire by an Egyptian terrorist organization and\n\n22   to draft a fatwa calling for, inter alia, the killing of \"Jews\n\n23   and Crusaders.\"\n\n24             We affirm as to Stewart's and Yousry's convictions of\n\n25   providing and concealing material support to the conspiracy to\n\n26   murder persons in a foreign country in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f1    § 2339A and 18 U.S.C. § 2, and of conspiring to provide and\n\n2    conceal such support in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.   We\n\n3    conclude that the charges were valid -- that 18 U.S.C. § 2339A is\n\n4    neither unconstitutionally vague as applied nor a \"logical\n\n5    absurdity,\" as Stewart asserts -- and that the evidence was\n\n6    sufficient to sustain the convictions.   We also reject Stewart's\n\n7    claims that her purported attempt to serve as a \"zealous\n\n8    advocate\" for her client provides her with immunity from the\n\n9    convictions.\n\n10             Finally, we affirm Stewart's convictions for knowingly\n\n11   and willfully making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n12   § 1001 when she affirmed that she intended to, and would, abide\n\n13   by the SAMs.   In light of her repeated and flagrant violation of\n\n14   the SAMs, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Stewart's\n\n15   representations that she intended to and would abide by the SAMs\n\n16   were knowingly false when made.\n\n17             We reject the remaining challenges to the convictions.\n\n18   We affirm the district court's rejection of Sattar's vindictive\n\n19   prosecution claim because there is insufficient evidence to\n\n20   support a finding that the government's pre-trial decision to add\n\n21   new charges against Sattar amounted to an effort to punish him\n\n22   for exercising his constitutional rights.   And, because Stewart's\n\n23   conduct was materially different from, and more serious than, the\n\n24   conduct of other lawyers representing Abdel Rahman who may also\n\n25   have violated the SAMs, we affirm the district court's rejection\n\n26   of Stewart's claim that she was selectively prosecuted on account\n\n                                       -5-\n\f1    of her gender or political beliefs.   We also conclude that the\n\n2    district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sever\n\n3    the trial of Stewart and Yousry from that of Sattar in light of\n\n4    the general preference for joint trials, the specific charges at\n\n5    issue here, and the district court's curative instructions.    Nor\n\n6    did the district court abuse its discretion by empaneling an\n\n7    anonymous jury in light of the particular allegations of criminal\n\n8    wrongdoing at issue, involving the corruption of the judicial\n\n9    process, and the widespread publicity about the case.   We find no\n\n10   fault with the district court's resolution of allegations of\n\n11   juror impropriety.   We also agree with the district court's\n\n12   treatment of confidential information, including its denial of\n\n13   Stewart's motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to the\n\n14   Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), its ex parte, in\n\n15   camera examination of FISA wiretap applications, and its\n\n16   rejection of Stewart's more general challenges to the\n\n17   constitutionality of FISA.   Finally, we find no fault with the\n\n18   district court's treatment, in accordance with the Classified\n\n19   Information Procedures Act (\"CIPA\"), of Stewart's motion to\n\n20   compel disclosure of information related to potential\n\n21   surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency.\n\n22             We therefore affirm the convictions in their entirety.\n\n23             We also affirm the sentences of Sattar and Yousry.    We\n\n24   conclude that the district court committed neither procedural\n\n25   error in calculating the applicable Guidelines ranges, nor\n\n26   substantive error in varying from those ranges pursuant to its\n\n                                     -6-\n\f1    consideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n2    We nonetheless remand their cases to the district court to allow\n\n3    it to reconsider their sentences should it choose to do so in\n\n4    light of the resentencing of Stewart.\n\n5              We cannot affirm Stewart's sentence on the basis of the\n\n6    record before us.   Because the district court declined to find\n\n7    whether Stewart committed perjury at trial, we cannot conclude\n\n8    that the mitigating factors found to support her sentence can\n\n9    reasonably bear the weight assigned to them.   This is so\n\n10   particularly in light of the seriousness of her criminal conduct,\n\n11   her responsibilities as a member of the bar, and her role as\n\n12   counsel for Abdel Rahman.   We therefore remand the cause to the\n\n13   district court for further consideration of her sentence, in\n\n14   light of, among other things, the charges of perjury against her\n\n15   and of any other matter it deems necessary or advisable, and\n\n16   direct the court to revoke Stewart's and Yousry's bail pending\n\n17   appeal and to order them to surrender to the United States\n\n18   Marshal to begin serving their sentences forthwith.\n\n19                               BACKGROUND\n\n20             The transcript of the trials in the cases on appeal\n\n21   runs in excess of thirteen thousand pages.   The district court\n\n22   issued nine opinions and a wide variety of orders addressing\n\n23   issues presented during the course of the proceedings.   See\n\n24   principally, United States v.

In reviewing the conviction,\n\n9    we set forth the facts, as we must, in the light most favorable\n\n10   to the government.    See United States v.

Ct. 1401 (2009).    The Bureau of\n\n10   Prisons, following Abdel Rahman's remand to its custody in August\n\n11   1997, imposed severely restrictive SAMs upon him.    They were\n\n12   designed to prevent him from directing or facilitating yet more\n\n13   violent acts of terrorism from his prison cell.    The SAMs have\n\n14   been renewed, and sometimes modified, every 120 days since they\n\n15   were first imposed.\n\n16             The May 11, 1998, SAMs applicable to Abdel Rahman\n\n17   \"prohibited [him] from having contact with . . . others (except\n\n18   as noted in this document) that could foreseeably result in [him]\n\n19   communicating information (sending or receiving) that could\n\n20   circumvent the SAM intent of significantly limiting [his] ability\n\n21   to communicate (send or receive) terrorist information.\"     SAMs of\n\n22   May 11, 1998, ¶ 3.    To enforce this general prohibition, the\n\n23   measures regulated Abdel Rahman's telephone contacts, id. ¶ 4,\n\n24   his mail, id. ¶ 5, and his visitors' visits, id. ¶ 6.    The\n\n25   measures limited his telephone contacts solely to his attorneys\n\n26   of record and his wife, id. ¶ 4(a), and prevented matters\n\n                                     -11-\n\f1    discussed in those calls from being \"divulged in any manner to\n\n2    any third party,\" id. ¶ 4(c)(i).

See, e.g., SAMs of\n\n18   Apr. 7, 1999, ¶ 9; SAMs of Dec. 10, 1999, ¶ 9.    They retained\n\n19   similar provisions regarding legal communications, and\n\n20   incorporated provisions requiring Abdel Rahman's attorneys to\n\n21   sign affirmations acknowledging their receipt of the version of\n\n22   the SAMs in effect.   See, e.g., SAMs of Apr. 7, 1999, ¶ 4; SAMs\n\n23   of Dec. 10, 1999, ¶ 4.     By virtue of those affirmations, counsel\n\n24   agreed to abide by the terms of SAMs then in effect.

On May 1,\n\n4    1998, she signed a document entitled \"Attorney Affirmation,\" in\n\n5    which she affirmed, under penalty of perjury, the truth of\n\n6    specified statements regarding the then-applicable SAMs: that she\n\n7    had read the May 11, 1998, version of the SAMs; that she\n\n8    \"underst[ood] the restrictions contained in that document and\n\n9    agree[d] to abide by its terms\"; that during her visits to Abdel\n\n10   Rahman she would \"employ only cleared translators/interpreters\n\n11   and [would] not leave [any] translator/interpreter alone with\n\n12   inmate Abdel Rahman\"; and that she would \"only be accompanied by\n\n13   translators for the purpose of communicating with inmate Abdel\n\n14   Rahman concerning legal matters.\"      Affirmation of Lynne Stewart,\n\n15   May 1, 1998.

On May 16, 2000, and again on\n\n21   May 7, 2001, Stewart signed similar affirmations under penalty of\n\n22   perjury, again affirming that she had read the most recent\n\n23   versions of the SAMs, and that she would not use her contact with\n\n24   Abdel Rahman to pass messages between him and third parties,\n\n25   including members of the media.

As a translator, Yousry was permitted to\n\n5    read to Abdel Rahman, who is blind, and to take dictation from\n\n6    him.\n\n7               Various members of the team, including Stewart and\n\n8    Yousry, also maintained contact with defendant Ahmed Abdel\n\n9    Sattar, who had served as a paralegal during Abdel Rahman's\n\n10   trial.   The evidence established that Sattar was in continual\n\n11   contact with various members of al-Gama'a abroad.    See, e.g.,\n\n12   Transcript of Conversation between Ahmed Abdel Sattar and Rifa'i\n\n13   Ahmad Taha Musa, May 9, 2000.\n\n14              The Visits to Abdel Rahman\n\n15              Sometime in 1997, more than three years after Abdel\n\n16   Rahman was taken into federal custody, a faction of al-Gama'a\n\n17   declared a unilateral \"cease-fire,\" i.e., a halting of violent\n\n18   operations, in Egypt.    When the cease-fire was first announced,\n\n19   Abdel Rahman was understood to support it.\n\n20              In November 1997, despite the cease-fire, a group\n\n21   associated with al-Gama'a attacked, killed, and mutilated the\n\n22   bodies of more than sixty tourists, guides, and guards at the\n\n23   Hatshepsut Temple in Luxor, Egypt.     Rifa'i Taha Musa (\"Taha\") --\n\n24   a military leader of al-Gama'a, a follower of Abdel Rahman, and\n\n25   an unindicted co-conspirator herein -- was involved in the\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f1    incident.4    Alaa Abdul Raziq Atia (\"Atia\"), later a leader of\n\n2    al-Gama'a's military wing in Egypt, was also involved in the\n\n3    killings.     Al-Gama'a later claimed responsibility for the attack\n\n4    and demanded Abdel Rahman's release from prison in the United\n\n5    States.\n\n6                 In January 1998, Abdel Rahman was assigned by the\n\n7    Bureau of Prisons to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester,\n\n8    Minnesota (\"FMC Rochester\").     In March 1999, Stewart and Yousry\n\n9    visited him there.     Prior to the visit, Stewart signed and\n\n10   delivered to the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern\n\n11   District of New York a document in which she affirmed, under\n\n12   penalty of perjury, that she would abide by the SAMs imposed by\n\n13   the Bureau of Prisons on Abdel Rahman.\n\n14                At about this time, defendant Sattar was in contact\n\n15   with members of al-Gama'a, who were divided over their support\n\n16   for what remained of the cease-fire.     Pro-cease-fire and anti-\n\n17   cease-fire factions developed, and members of the organization\n\n18   wanted Abdel Rahman to take a position on the matter.     To that\n\n19   end, several wrote messages addressed to Abdel Rahman, which they\n\n20   sent to Sattar for delivery to Abdel Rahman.     Sattar gave the\n\n21   messages to Stewart and Yousry, who surreptitiously brought the\n\n22   messages with them to Abdel Rahman during a subsequent visit in\n\n23   May 2000.\n\n\n          4\n            In 1998, Taha joined with Osama Bin Laden and Ayman Al-\n     Zawahiri to sign a fatwa entitled \"Jihad against the United\n     States and the Jews.\" See Translation of World Islamic Front's\n     Statement Urging Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f1               Yousry read the messages to Abdel Rahman during the\n\n2    visit, and Abdel Rahman dictated to Yousry responses to some of\n\n3    them.   Yousry and Stewart then smuggled the responses out of FMC\n\n4    Rochester among their legal papers, and sent them to Sattar.     As\n\n5    directed by Abdel Rahman, Sattar informed various members of al-\n\n6    Gama'a that Abdel Rahman was willing to reconsider the\n\n7    effectiveness of the cease-fire and had rejected the associated\n\n8    idea that al-Gama'a should form a political party in Egypt.\n\n9               News of Abdel Rahman's purported position spread.     But\n\n10   some members of the media in the Middle East expressed skepticism\n\n11   about the veracity of Sattar's representations, questioning\n\n12   whether they in fact came from Abdel Rahman or whether Sattar had\n\n13   fabricated them himself.   To refute those reports, Sattar and\n\n14   Yousry asked one of Abdel Rahman's lawyers, former United States\n\n15   Attorney General Ramsey Clark, to tell a reporter for an Arabic-\n\n16   language newspaper that Abdel Rahman opposed al-Gama'a's\n\n17   formation of a political party.    Clark, they thought, would be\n\n18   perceived as more authoritative than Sattar.    Clark eventually\n\n19   agreed to talk to the reporter.    He told the reporter that \"[t]he\n\n20   Sheikh has said he believes that the formation of a new political\n\n21   party to engage in politics in Egypt at this time is . . .     not\n\n22   correct and should not be done.\"    Transcript of Conversation\n\n23   between Ahmed Abdel Sattar, Mohammed Yousry, Ramsey Clark, and\n\n24   Muhammad Al-Shafi'i, Nov. 5, 1999, at 15.\n\n25              In September 1999, Farid Kidwani, the then-leader of\n\n26   al-Gama'a's military wing, was killed along with three other\n\n                                    -16-\n\f1    members of the group in a shootout with Egyptian police.\n\n2    Kidwani's death precipitated further tension and debate within\n\n3    al-Gama'a regarding the advisability and efficacy of the cease-\n\n4    fire.\n\n5               Taha sent another message to Sattar to be relayed to\n\n6    Abdel Rahman urging Abdel Rahman to support the termination of\n\n7    the cease-fire and noting that Taha and his associates needed a\n\n8    \"powerful word\" from Abdel Rahman to achieve this goal.    Taha\n\n9    told Sattar that such support from Abdel Rahman would \"strengthen\n\n10   me among the brothers.\"    Sattar agreed to send the message to\n\n11   Abdel Rahman and prepared a letter to Abdel Rahman for that\n\n12   purpose.   In mid-September 1999, Clark and Yousry surreptitiously\n\n13   took the letter, along with newspaper articles relating to the\n\n14   killing of Kidwani in Egypt, with them during a visit to Abdel\n\n15   Rahman in FMC Rochester.    Yousry read the letter and newspaper\n\n16   clippings aloud to Abdel Rahman.    From these documents, Abdel\n\n17   Rahman first learned of Kidwani's death.\n\n18              Abdel Rahman dictated a letter to Yousry in response.\n\n19              To those against whom war is made, permission\n20              is given to fight, because they are wronged\n21              (oppressed) -- and verily God is most\n22              powerful for their aid. . . . The latest\n23              thing published in the newspapers was about\n24              the Egyptian regime's killing of four members\n25              of the Group. This is . . . enough proof\n26              that the Egyptian regime does not have the\n27              intention to interact with this peaceful\n28              Initiative [i.e., the cease-fire] which aims\n29              at unification. I therefore demand that my\n30              brothers, the sons of [al-Gama'a] do a\n31              comprehensive review of the Initiative and\n32              its results. I also demand that they\n33              consider themselves absolved from it.\n\n                                     -17-\n\f1    Transcript of Conversation between Ahmed Abdel Sattar and Rifa'i\n\n2    Ahmad Taha Musa, Sep. 20, 1999, at 6-7 (emphasis omitted,\n\n3    parenthetical in original).   Sattar expected Clark to make a\n\n4    public statement to similar effect, but Clark declined to do so.\n\n5               On February 18 and 19, 2000, Yousry and Abdeen Jabara,\n\n6    an Arabic-speaking lawyer and member of Abdel Rahman's legal\n\n7    team, visited Abdel Rahman at FMC Rochester.   They brought with\n\n8    them another letter which included another message from Taha,\n\n9    again asking for Abdel Rahman's support for ending the cease-\n\n10   fire.   But Jabara would not permit Abdel Rahman to dictate a\n\n11   letter to Yousry in response.   And, notwithstanding pressure from\n\n12   Sattar and Taha, Jabara, like Clark before him, refused to issue\n\n13   any public statement regarding Abdel Rahman's position on the\n\n14   matter.\n\n15              On May 16, 2000, defendant Stewart signed another\n\n16   affirmation that she and her staff would abide by the SAMs.     She\n\n17   did not submit that affirmation to the United States Attorney's\n\n18   Office until May 26.\n\n19              On May 18, 2000, Stewart met with Sattar, who gave her\n\n20   more letters for Abdel Rahman, including another message from\n\n21   Taha yet again seeking Abdel Rahman's approval of an end to the\n\n22   cease-fire.   Taha asked Abdel Rahman to take a \"more forceful\n\n23   position\" regarding the end of the cease-fire and to \"dictate\n\n24   some points we can announce in a press conference with Lynne.\"\n\n25   Transcript of Second Audiovisual Recording involving Omar Abdel\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f1    Rahman, Mohammed Yousry, Lynne Stewart, and others, May 19, 2000,\n\n2    (\"Video Tr.

Yousry told Abdel Rahman that Abu\n\n8    Sayyaf -- an Islamic terrorist group in the Philippines -- had\n\n9    taken hostages to be used in bargaining for the release of Abdel\n\n10   Rahman and others.   When Yousry explained to Stewart that he was\n\n11   \"telling the Sheikh about the Abu Sayyaf group in the\n\n12   Philippines\" and how \"they took hostages,\" Stewart replied, \"Good\n\n13   for them.\"   Transcript of First Audiovisual Recording involving\n\n14   Omar Abdel Rahman, Mohammed Yousry, and Lynne Stewart, May 19,\n\n15   2000, at 27.\n\n16             From the beginning of the visit, Stewart was aware of\n\n17   the prison guards' presence.   For example, she asked Yousry, \"Do\n\n18   they usually sit like this and watch us?\"     Id. at 10.   And during\n\n19   this meeting, Stewart and Yousry took overt steps to ensure that\n\n20   the nature of their communication with Abdel Rahman would be\n\n21   concealed from the prison guards.     As she suggested to Yousry,\n\n22   they \"should give them [i.e., the guards] something to watch.\"\n\n\n\n          5\n            Similar citations to transcripts of audiovisual recordings\n     of prison visits to Abdel Rahman will follow the same format,\n     i.e., \"Video Tr.

While\n\n5    Yousry read the message to Abdel Rahman, Stewart uttered a\n\n6    meaningless series of phrases to Yousry so that it would appear\n\n7    to an observer as though she was taking part in a three-way\n\n8    conversation:    \"I am talking to you about. . . him going to have\n\n9    a, uh, chocolate eh . . .   heart attack here . . . .

At one\n\n10   point, while Yousry was conversing with Abdel Rahman, Stewart\n\n11   touched Yousry's hand and said \"Why don't you stop there and\n\n12   we'll talk a minute um, the, uh. . . .     Ahmed's youngest son\n\n13   needs glasses, did you know that?\"     Id. at 30.    Yousry then\n\n14   explained to Abdel Rahman, \"Lynne says, stop a little because\n\n15   they are by the glass.\"   Id.   Not long afterwards, Stewart tapped\n\n16   with the pen on the paper in front of Yousry and told him to\n\n17   \"continue reading this 'cause this is setting up the\n\n18   organizational system around his conditions.\"       Id.   Yousry\n\n19   continued reading.   Stewart then made a series of statements\n\n20   unrelated to the substance of the conversation between Yousry and\n\n21   Abdel Rahman.   Yousry kept Abdel Rahman informed of what Yousry\n\n22   and Stewart were doing, noting that \"Lynne continues to eh, she's\n\n23   watching them, she's watching them,\" to which Abdel Rahman\n\n24   replied, \"[v]ery good, very good.\"     Id. at 33.

Stewart told Yousry, \"I am making\n\n17   allowances for them looking in at us and seeing me never speaking\n\n18   and writing away here while you talk Arabic.\"     Id. at 17.   She\n\n19   then directed Yousry to \"talk back to me now, because otherwise\n\n20   it doesn't make any sense. . . .     So say something in\n\n21   English . . . .\"   Id.

Sattar then passed them\n\n2    along to Taha and another member of al-Gama'a.      Sattar also spoke\n\n3    to various members of al-Gama'a, informing them that Abdel Rahman\n\n4    would have \"no objection\" to a return to violence.

Sattar and Stewart first\n\n10   discussed what Stewart would say to the press.      Then, on June 13,\n\n11   2000, Sattar and Stewart spoke to Esmat Salaheddin, a Reuters\n\n12   reporter based in Cairo.   Stewart told Salaheddin that Abdel\n\n13   Rahman \"is withdrawing his support for the ceasefire that\n\n14   currently exists.\"   Trial Transcript (\"Trial Tr.\") at 5574, 5617,\n\n15   testimony of Salaheddin.   She explained that Abdel Rahman had\n\n16   made the statement from prison two weeks before.\n\n17             The next day, other Middle Eastern press outlets\n\n18   carried the news that Abdel Rahman had withdrawn his support for\n\n19   the cease-fire.   Many noted that for the cease-fire to hold,\n\n20   Abdel Rahman's support was essential.\n\n21             On June 20, 2000, Stewart participated in a telephone\n\n22   conference with Abdel Rahman.   She then sent another statement on\n\n23   Abdel Rahman's behalf via facsimile to Salaheddin, the Reuters\n\n24   reporter in Cairo.   The telecopy said, \"Everything said in the\n\n25   previous statements is correct\" and quoted Abdel Rahman as\n\n26   saying, \"I do withdraw my support to the [cease-fire]\n\n                                     -23-\n\f1    initiative.\"    Statement for Release, Abdel Rahman, June 20, 2000.\n\n2    Following Stewart's statements on Abdel Rahman's behalf, several\n\n3    members of al-Gama'a began preparations to engage anew in acts of\n\n4    violence.\n\n5                On October 4, 2000, Sattar and Taha completed a fatwa\n\n6    on Abdel Rahman's behalf, imitating his style, \"mandating the\n\n7    killing of the Israelis everywhere\" and \"the killing [of] the\n\n8    Jews wherever they are (UI) and wherever they are found.\"\n\n9    Transcript of Audio Recording of Ahmed Abdel Sattar and Yassir\n\n10   Al-Sirri Oct. 4, 2000, (\"Audio Tr.

Upon receiving the\n\n3    message, Atia began preparing for an attack.     But, on October 19,\n\n4    2000, before Atia could act, the Egyptian authorities raided his\n\n5    hideout, killing him and killing or arresting other al-Gama'a\n\n6    members.\n\n7                 On July 13 and 14, 2001, Stewart again paid a visit to\n\n8    Abdel Rahman at FMC Rochester, having signed a revised\n\n9    affirmation agreeing to abide by the SAMs and having sent the\n\n10   affirmation by facsimile to the United States Attorney's Office\n\n11   for the Southern District of New York on May 7, 2001.     Stewart\n\n12   again, with Yousry's assistance and contrary to provisions of the\n\n13   SAMs, surreptitiously brought messages to and from Abdel Rahman.\n\n14                Procedural History\n\n15                On April 8, 2002, the defendants were indicted in\n\n16   connection with these and related acts; a superseding indictment\n\n17   was filed on November 19, 2003.

United States v. Florez, 447 F.3d 145,\n\n14   154 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1040 (2006).    Because the\n\n15   jury verdict will be upheld against a sufficiency challenge \"if\n\n16   we find that 'any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\n17   essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,'\"\n\n18   United States v.

A fuller purported quotation in\n     the article reads, \"I don't think anybody would say that to go to\n     jail for two years is anything to look forward to. But -- as\n     some of my clients once put it -- I can do that standing on my\n     head.\" Id. Whether Stewart made this statement in full, in\n     part, or not at all, is obviously entirely irrelevant to any of\n     the issues before us.\n\n                                    -27-\n\f1    in Jackson)), a convicted defendant making such a claim \"bears a\n\n2    very heavy burden,\" United States v.

Count One\n\n7              Each defendant asserts that the evidence admitted at\n\n8    trial was insufficient to support his or her conviction under 18\n\n9    U.S.C. § 371 for defrauding the United States and obstructing the\n\n10   Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons in the\n\n11   administration and enforcement of the SAMs in force with respect\n\n12   to Abdel Rahman.    Stewart also argues that the SAMs do not apply\n\n13   to lawyers, and that the district court improperly prevented her\n\n14   from challenging the underlying validity of the SAMs.\n\n15   A. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n16             In order to establish a conspiracy-to-defraud offense\n\n17   under 18 U.S.C. § 371 as charged in Count One of the indictment,\n\n18   a reasonable jury must have been able to conclude beyond a\n\n19   reasonable doubt \"(1) [that the defendants] entered into an\n\n20   agreement (2) to obstruct a lawful function of the government [in\n\n21   this case, the administration and enforcement of the SAMs] (3) by\n\n22   deceitful or dishonest means and (4) at least one overt act in\n\n23   furtherance of the conspiracy.\"    United States v.

Evidence as to Stewart.   Stewart argues that her\n\n6    defiance of the SAMs was open, not deceitful.      One aspect of her\n\n7    defiance was undoubtedly public -- the conveyance of Abdel\n\n8    Rahman's statements regarding the cease-fire and related matters\n\n9    to the Reuters journalist.     But we agree with the district court\n\n10   that \"[a] reasonable jury could certainly [have found] that\n\n11   Stewart gained access to Abdel Rahman [and thereby the\n\n12   information that she conveyed to the journalist] by deceit and\n\n13   dishonest means.\"     Sattar V, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 89.   \"Without\n\n14   [Stewart's] agreement to abide by the SAMs and the other\n\n15   representations contained in her affirmations, she knew that she\n\n16   would not have been allowed to visit Abdel Rahman,\" id.; see also\n\n17   id. at 84-89, and therefore would not later have been able to\n\n18   defy the regulations openly by publicizing messages on his\n\n19   behalf.\n\n20               Stewart insists that she acted with the intent, not to\n\n21   defraud the government, but to \"zealously\" represent her\n\n22   client.10   But the jury had a reasonable basis on which to\n\n\n          10\n             The word \"zealot,\" taken from a first century A.D. anti-\n     Roman Jewish movement, carries with it overtones of fanaticism,\n     see The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 2000\n     (4th ed. 2000). The American Heritage Dictionary lists as\n     principal definitions: \"1a. One who is zealous, especially\n                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                      -29-\n\f1    disbelieve this, and to \"disbelieve that zealous representation\n\n2    included filing false affirmations, hiding from prison guards the\n\n3    delivery of messages to Abdel Rahman, and the dissemination of\n\n4    responses by him that were obtained through dishonesty.\"     Id. at\n\n5    90.   Moreover, even if Stewart acted with an intent to represent\n\n6    her client zealously, a rational jury could nonetheless have\n\n7    concluded that Stewart simultaneously acted with an intent to\n\n8    defraud the government.    A genuinely held intent to represent a\n\n9    client \"zealously\" is not necessarily inconsistent with criminal\n\n10   intent.\n\n11               2. Evidence as to Yousry.   Yousry argues that, as a\n\n12   translator who was taking direction from others, he did only what\n\n13   he was told to do and acted in good-faith reliance on the\n\n14   guidance and conduct of the members of the bar for whom he\n\n15   worked.    Based on the evidence admitted at trial, however, a\n\n16   rational jury could have found that Yousry knew of and understood\n\n17   the terms of the SAMs.\n\n\n\n\n           10\n           (...continued)\n     excessively so. b. A fanatically committed person.\" Id.\n          The word has historically been used as a positive\n     commandment, however, with respect to the ethical obligations of\n     members of the bar. Until recently, for example, Canon 7 of the\n     New York Lawyer's Code of Professional Responsibility provided:\n     \"A Lawyer Should Represent a Client Zealously Within the Bounds\n     of the Law.\" It is in that sense that we understand Stewart to\n     use the term here.\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f1              Yousry had in his possession the December 1999 version\n\n2    of the SAMs as well as a copy of the underlying regulations.\n\n3    That version of the SAMs provided that Abdel Rahman's legal team\n\n4    could pass along to him \"only inmate case-related\n\n5    correspondence,\" and set forth a process for screening all non-\n\n6    legal mail.   SAMs of Dec. 10, 1999, ¶ 7.    The SAMs in Yousry's\n\n7    possession also specifically prohibited Abdel Rahman's\n\n8    communication with news media \"in person, by telephone, by\n\n9    furnishing a recorded message, through the mails, through his\n\n10   attorney(s), or otherwise.\"    Id. ¶ 9.   Yousry himself\n\n11   acknowledged that members of the legal team were not \"to disclose\n\n12   any portion of their conversation with the Sheik to the media.\"\n\n13   Excerpts from Draft of Dissertation of Mohammed Yousry at 29.\n\n14   Yousry also knew that Clark and Jabara had refused to relay\n\n15   messages from Abdel Rahman.\n\n16             From this evidence, a reasonable factfinder could\n\n17   conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Yousry knew that his\n\n18   assistance, by providing translation services, in facilitating\n\n19   Abdel Rahman's continued contact with members of al-Gama'a\n\n20   violated the SAMs.   Moreover, as with Stewart, Yousry's deceptive\n\n21   and evasive conduct during the course of his visits to Abdel\n\n22   Rahman undercuts his claim of good faith.\n\n23             Yousry argues that the evidence established, at most,\n\n24   that he intended to violate the SAMs, not that he knew that doing\n\n25   so might constitute a crime.    But even if he misunderstood the\n\n                                     -31-\n\f1    law in that respect, such a mistake provides no defense to a\n\n2    charge of criminal misbehavior.      See Cheek v. United States, 498\n\n3    U.S. 192, 199 (1991).    The fact that Yousry was aware that his\n\n4    acts, in knowing violation of the SAMs, would defraud the\n\n5    government is sufficient to sustain the conviction.     The\n\n6    government need not also prove that he knew that there was a\n\n7    criminal statute -- 18 U.S.C. § 371 -- that criminalized such\n\n8    behavior.    \"The general rule that ignorance of the law or a\n\n9    mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution is deeply\n\n10   rooted in the American legal system.\"     Cheek, 498 U.S. at 199.\n\n11   B. Propriety of the SAMs\n\n12               1. Stewart's Argument.   Stewart contends that the\n\n13   district court erred by preventing her from challenging the\n\n14   validity of the SAMs as part of her defense.     She sought to argue\n\n15   that the Attorney General has no authority to have lawyers held\n\n16   criminally liable for violating the SAMs and that the SAMs are\n\n17   unconstitutionally vague as applied to her.     Under Dennis v.\n\n18   United States, 384 U.S. 855 (1966), however, Stewart's strategy\n\n19   of collaterally attacking the validity of the SAMs is futile.\n\n20               As the Supreme Court recognized in Dennis, there are\n\n21   \"appropriate and inappropriate ways to challenge acts of\n\n22   government thought to be unconstitutional.\"     Id. at 867.   There\n\n23   is \"no reason for [federal courts] to consider the\n\n24   constitutionality of a statute at the behest of petitioners who\n\n25   have been indicted for conspiracy by means of falsehood and\n\n                                     -32-\n\f1    deceit to circumvent the law which they now seek to challenge.\"\n\n2    Id. at 866.   Stewart, like the defendants in Dennis, was indicted\n\n3    for engaging in a \"voluntary, deliberate and calculated course of\n\n4    fraud and deceit.\"   Id. at 867.   This is a \"prosecution directed\n\n5    at [Stewart's] fraud[,] not an action to enforce the [law]\n\n6    claimed to be unconstitutional.\"   Id.11\n\n7              The result may be different where the constitutionality\n\n8    of a law is \"challenged by those who of necessity violate its\n\n9    provisions and seek relief in the courts,\" id. at 865, or where\n\n10   the governmental action at issue was taken with no \"colorable\n\n11   authority,\" United States v. Barra, 149 F.2d 489, 490 (2d Cir.\n\n\n\n\n          11\n            The fraudulent scheme in Dennis related to a statutory\n     scheme, whereas the fraudulent conduct here related to a\n     regulatory one. The fundamental principles, however, remain the\n     same; the central issue remains the deceitful act, not the form\n     or nature of the governmental conduct that prompted the deceit.\n\n                                    -33-\n\f1    1945).12   But, as with Dennis, \"[t]his is not such a case.\"   384\n\n2    U.S. at 865.\n\n3               We have no basis upon which to entertain a doubt as to\n\n4    the authority of the Attorney General of the United States to\n\n5    ensure that reasonable measures are designed and implemented in\n\n6    an attempt to prevent imprisoned criminals who are considered\n\n7    dangerous despite their incarceration from engaging in or\n\n8    facilitating further acts of criminality from their prison cells.\n\n9    See 28 C.F.R. § 501.3(a) (setting forth the boundaries of that\n\n10   authority).    Nor have we any reason to doubt the Attorney\n\n11   General's conclusion that Abdel Rahman fits within that category\n\n\n          12\n             The defendants here are not, of course, subject to a\n     contempt proceeding for violation of an injunction. But we note\n     some similarity between the principles established in Dennis and\n     the collateral bar rule of Walker v. Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307,\n     315 (1967), which limits the ability to defend against charges of\n     contempt for violating a court-ordered injunction on the ground\n     that the injunction itself was unconstitutional, see Matter of\n     Providence Journal Co., 820 F.2d 1342, 1346 (1st Cir. 1986),\n     modified, 820 F.2d 1354 (1st Cir. 1987), cert. dismissed, 485\n     U.S. 693 (1988) (\"As a general rule, a party may not violate [a\n     court] order and raise the issue of its unconstitutionality\n     collaterally as a defense in the criminal contempt proceeding.\n     Rather, the appropriate method to challenge a court order is to\n     petition to have the order vacated or amended.\"). With respect\n     to exceptions to the \"general rule,\" there is also some\n     similarity between Barra, 149 F.2d at 490 (allowing prosecution\n     for making false statements in connection with government\n     requests for information so long as the government \"has colorable\n     authority to do what it is doing'\") and Matter of Providence\n     Journal Co., 820 F.2d at 1344, 1352 (allowing collateral attack\n     on an injunction in contempt proceeding for violating that\n     injunction where it was a \"transparently invalid prior restraint\n     on pure speech\").\n\n                                     -34-\n\f1    of prisoner.   He has demonstrated his willingness to engage in\n\n2    violent criminality not by acting violently himself, but by\n\n3    ordering, encouraging, and conspiring with others who would\n\n4    actually shed the blood.   The likelihood that he would continue\n\n5    to order, direct, or encourage such acts from prison, if he\n\n6    could, was plain, and his incapacitation reasonably required not\n\n7    just his physical immobility, but also his virtual silence vis-à-\n\n8    vis the world at large.\n\n9              Stewart might have effectively challenged the SAMs by\n\n10   refusing to sign the affirmations in which she said she would\n\n11   abide by them.   She might then have invoked the jurisdiction of\n\n12   the courts by bringing suit on Abdel Rahman's or her own behalf\n\n13   to challenge their validity.   She might have argued -- as she\n\n14   forcefully does here -- that the SAMs interfered with her\n\n15   capacity to effectively represent Rahman.   But she did not.\n\n16   Instead, she signed the affirmations.   Having chosen that path,\n\n17   she cannot be heard to attack the validity of those measures when\n\n18   called to account for violating them, especially where, as here,\n\n19   her fraudulent and deceptive conduct endangered people's lives.\n\n20              The district court did not err in preventing Stewart\n\n21   from challenging the validity of the SAMs as part of her defense,\n\n22   and the jury acted within its province when it found that Stewart\n\n23   intentionally and fraudulently subverted them.\n\n24             2. Sattar's Related Arguments on Appeal.   Sattar relies\n\n25   on Stewart's and Yousry's arguments with respect to Count One.\n\n                                    -35-\n\f1    For the reasons set forth above addressing those arguments, we\n\n2    conclude that they are also unpersuasive as applied to him.\n\n3              III.    Counts Two and Three\n\n4              Only Sattar was charged in Counts Two and Three of the\n\n5    superseding indictment.    He does not challenge the sufficiency of\n\n6    the evidence supporting his Count Two conviction for conspiring\n\n7    with Abdel Rahman, Taha, and others to murder persons in a\n\n8    foreign country, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 956.13   Instead, he\n\n9    asserts that the district court should have dismissed this count\n\n10   on the grounds of vindictive prosecution.    Similarly, Sattar does\n\n11   not challenge his conviction on Count Three for soliciting\n\n12   persons to engage in crimes of violence -- murder and conspiracy\n\n13   to commit murder -- in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 373.14    He argues\n\n14   instead that he was denied a fair trial.    These arguments are\n\n15   addressed below in the context of the defendants' more general\n\n16   challenges to the probity of the proceedings.\n\n17             IV.    Counts Four and Five\n\n18             Stewart and Yousry challenge their Count Five\n\n19   convictions for violating 18 U.S.C. § 2339A and 18 U.S.C. § 2 by\n\n20   providing and concealing material support for the Count-Two\n\n21   conspiracy for which Sattar was convicted and their Count Four\n\n\n          13\n             By special verdict, the jury concluded that the object\n     of the Count-Two conspiracy was murder, not kidnaping.\n          14\n             By special verdict, the jury concluded that the crimes\n     of violence Sattar solicited were murder and conspiracy to\n     murder.\n\n                                     -36-\n\f1    convictions for conspiracy to provide and conceal such support,\n\n2    in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.     They argue that the evidence\n\n3    was insufficient to support their conviction on either count, and\n\n4    contend that their conduct was constitutionally protected in any\n\n5    event.\n\n6    A. History of the Charges\n\n7                 By way of background, the initial indictment charged\n\n8    all three defendants with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2339B.15     The\n\n9    defendants argued before the district court that \"18 U.S.C.\n\n10   § 2339B is unconstitutionally vague . . . with regard to the\n\n11   statute's prohibition on providing material support or resources\n\n12   in the form of communications equipment and personnel.\"     Sattar\n\n13   I, 272 F. Supp. 2d at 356 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n14   The district court agreed, and therefore dismissed those charges.\n\n15   Id. at 361.16\n\n16                The government then filed a superseding indictment\n\n17   alleging that by essentially the same course of conduct, i.e.,\n\n18   coordinating the surreptitious passage of al-Gama'a messages to\n\n19   and from Abdel Rahman, Stewart and Yousry violated 18 U.S.C.\n\n\n           15\n             At the time of the relevant offense conduct, section\n     2339B provided, in relevant part, that \"[w]hoever, within the\n     United States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United\n     States, knowingly provides material support or resources to a\n     foreign terrorist organization, or attempts or conspires to do\n     so, shall be [guilty of a crime.]\" 18 U.S.C. § 2339B(a)(1)\n     (2000).\n           16\n                The constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B is not before\n     us.\n\n                                       -37-\n\f1    § 2339A.17    The relevant version of section 2339A, entitled\n\n2    \"Providing material support to terrorists,\" provided in relevant\n\n3    part:\n\n 4                Whoever, within the United States, provides\n 5                material support or resources or conceals or\n 6                disguises the nature, location, source, or\n 7                ownership of material support or resources,\n 8                knowing or intending that they are to be used\n 9                in preparation for, or in carrying out, a\n10                violation of [various enumerated statutes\n11                related to terrorism] or in preparation for,\n12                or in carrying out, the concealment of an\n13                escape from the commission of any such\n14                violation, or attempts or conspires to do\n15                such an act, shall be [subject to criminal\n16                punishment].\n\n17   18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (2000).     For purposes of both sections 2339A\n\n18   and 2339B, \"material support or resources\" may be provided in the\n\n19   form of:\n\n20                currency or other financial securities,\n21                financial services, lodging, training,\n22                safehouses, false documentation or\n23                identification, communications equipment,\n24                facilities, weapons, lethal substances,\n25                explosives, personnel, transportation, and\n26                other physical assets, except medicine or\n27                religious materials.\n\n28   18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b)(1) (2000); see also id. § 2339B(g)(4) (2000)\n\n29   (\"[T]he term 'material support or resources' has the same meaning\n\n30   given that term in section 2339A . . . .\").     Section 2339A,\n\n31   however, in contrast to section 2339B, does not penalize the\n\n\n\n             17\n             The superseding indictment did not charge Sattar with\n     violating section 2339B; instead, he was charged with conspiracy\n     to murder persons in a foreign country in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n     § 956, i.e., Count Two.\n\n                                      -38-\n\f1    provision of material support without regard to what the support\n\n2    is for.    Section 2339A requires instead that the defendant\n\n3    provide support or resources with the knowledge or intent that\n\n4    such resources be used to commit specific violent crimes.18\n\n5               The government charged that the defendants provided\n\n6    \"material support or resources\" in the form of \"personnel\" --\n\n7    namely, Abdel Rahman -- to the Count-Two conspiracy, knowing or\n\n8    intending that Abdel Rahman, as an active co-conspirator, would\n\n9    help commit crimes.    See Sattar III, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 296.   The\n\n10   government further asserted that Stewart and Yousry \"conceal[ed]\n\n11   and disguise[d] the nature, location, and source\" of their\n\n12   material support by means of the defendants' covert conduct\n\n13   disguising Abdel Rahman's participation as a co-conspirator.     See\n\n14   id.   The government had initially argued that Stewart and Yousry\n\n15   could be convicted for providing themselves as \"personnel\" to a\n\n16   foreign terrorist organization and by providing communications\n\n17   equipment to the conspiracy.    After the dismissal of the section\n\n18   2339B charges and following the filing of the superseding\n\n19   indictment, however, the government abandoned those contentions.\n\n20   See id.\n\n\n\n           18\n            Section 2339B criminalizes the knowing provision of\n     material support. See 18 U.S.C. § 2339B(a)(1) (2000). Section\n     2339A criminalizes the provision of material support knowing or\n     intending that such support is used to aid crimes of terrorism.\n     See 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (2000). Therefore, the mental state in\n     section 2339A extends both to the support itself, and to the\n     underlying purposes for which the support is given.\n\n                                     -39-\n\f1                As an initial matter, Stewart and Yousry challenge the\n\n2    sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions on this\n\n3    count.    They also argue that the district court erroneously\n\n4    instructed the jury on the elements of a violation of section\n\n5    2339A.    In addition, they raise more general challenges to the\n\n6    statute, arguing that section 2339A does not criminalize the\n\n7    behavior alleged in the indictment, that the provision is\n\n8    unconstitutional as a multi-level inchoate offense, and that the\n\n9    statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.      We\n\n10   examine their arguments in the context of the statutory elements\n\n11   of the crime, addressing first the sufficiency arguments.\n\n12   B. Elements of Section 2339A\n13\n14               1. Proof of the Underlying Conspiracy to Kill Persons\n\n15   Abroad.19   There was sufficient evidence of the existence of the\n\n16   predicate crime -- the Count-Two conspiracy to kill or kidnap --\n\n17   for which Sattar was convicted.    Indeed Sattar, the only\n\n18   defendant charged with and convicted of participating in the\n\n19   Count-Two conspiracy, does not challenge the sufficiency of the\n\n20   evidence as to this count.\n\n21               The government offered evidence that Sattar and Taha\n\n22   composed a fatwa in Abdel Rahman's name calling for \"the killing\n\n23   [of] the Jews wherever they are (UI) and wherever they are\n\n\n\n          19\n             As noted above, the jury found that the underlying\n     conspiracy involved the murder, not the kidnaping, of persons\n     abroad.\n\n                                     -40-\n\f1    found.\"   Audio Tr. Oct. 4, at 15.     It also offered proof that\n\n2    this fatwa was communicated to Atia, an al-Gama'a military\n\n3    leader.   Although the evidence may not have established any\n\n4    particular plan of action to execute the fatwa, a reasonable jury\n\n5    could have found beyond a reasonable doubt from the fatwa's\n\n6    exhortations and Atia's readiness to act on it that there was a\n\n7    concrete, illegal objective to murder persons abroad.\n\n8                A review of the transcripts of various intercepted\n\n9    telephone conversations introduced into evidence, particularly\n\n10   the September 18, 2000, conversation involving Sattar, Taha, and\n\n11   another party, bolsters this conclusion.      The discussion goes\n\n12   well beyond the abstract and contemplates the coordination with\n\n13   Atia of violent actions, presumably along the lines of the Luxor\n\n14   massacre.    In light of such evidence, a rational jury could have\n\n15   found beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy as charged in\n\n16   Count Two existed.\n\n17               2. Proof of Material Support to the Conspiracy.\n\n18   Stewart and Yousry also assert that they did not provide material\n\n19   support in the form of \"personnel\" to the Count-Two conspiracy.\n\n20   A reasonable jury could have concluded otherwise.      There was\n\n21   evidence introduced at trial sufficient to support a reasonable\n\n22   juror's inference that Stewart and Yousry helped Abdel Rahman\n\n23   participate covertly in the conspiracy to engage in violence\n\n24   abroad by communicating to members of al-Gama'a and others his\n\n25   withdrawal of support for the cease-fire.      Abdel Rahman's\n\n                                     -41-\n\f1    instrumental participation -- indeed, his leadership -- would, as\n\n2    the district court observed, have been unavailable to the Count-\n\n3    Two conspiracy \"without the active participation of Stewart and\n\n4    Yousry.\"   Sattar V, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 95.\n\n5               The defendants argue that the government established\n\n6    only that they provided the underlying conspiracy with Abdel\n\n7    Rahman's \"pure speech\" and therefore did not provide \"personnel\"\n\n8    within any constitutional interpretation of section 2339A.   The\n\n9    government does not deny that section 2339A may not be used to\n\n10   prosecute mere advocacy or other protected speech, but contends\n\n11   that the defendants were prosecuted for criminal actions that did\n\n12   not amount to protected speech.\n\n13              Resolution of this dispute does not turn on whether the\n\n14   prosecution introduced evidence of \"pure speech.\"   \"Numerous\n\n15   crimes under the federal criminal code are, or can be, committed\n\n16   by speech alone,\" and certain crimes \"are characteristically\n\n17   committed through speech.\"   Rahman, 189 F.3d at 117.   The issue\n\n18   is, instead, whether Abdel Rahman's statements were protected\n\n19   speech.    We conclude that the statements were not protected such\n\n20   as to cast doubt on the convictions.\n\n21              Words that are \"the very vehicle of [a] crime\" are not\n\n22   protected \"merely because, in part, [the crimes] may have\n\n23   involved the use of language.\"    United States v. Rowlee, 899 F.2d\n\n24   1275, 1278 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 828 (1990).    As we\n\n25   recognized when affirming Abdel Rahman's sentence, \"freedom of\n\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\f1    speech and of religion do not extend so far as to bar prosecution\n\n2    of one who uses a public speech or a religious ministry to commit\n\n3    crimes.\"    Abdel Rahman, 189 F.3d at 116-17.   \"[I]f the evidence\n\n4    shows that the speeches crossed the line into criminal\n\n5    solicitation, procurement of criminal activity, or conspiracy to\n\n6    violate the laws, the prosecution is permissible.\"    Id. at 117.\n\n7    Words \"that instruct, solicit, or persuade others to commit\n\n8    crimes of violence . . . violate the law and may be properly\n\n9    prosecuted regardless of whether they are uttered in private, or\n\n10   in a public speech, or in administering the duties of a religious\n\n11   ministry.\"    Id.\n\n12               The dissemination of some of the speech introduced at\n\n13   trial might be viewed as nothing more than the expression of\n\n14   views on the broad political situation in Egypt.    For example, in\n\n15   reaffirming that he was withdrawing his support for the cease-\n\n16   fire, Abdel Rahman said that he had \"expressed [his] opinion and\n\n17   left the matters to [his] brothers to examine it and study it.\"\n\n18   Statement for Release, Abdel Rahman, June 20, 2000.\n\n19               But a reasonable jury could have found, in light of\n\n20   Abdel Rahman's role as \"spiritual\" leader of al-Gama'a, that his\n\n21   messages were ultimately intended to sway al-Gama'a members to\n\n22   end the cease-fire, and by implication to commit criminal acts of\n\n23   violence.    Abdel Rahman's statements were therefore not an\n\n24   expression of opinion, but a call to arms.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\f1              The evidence establishes, moreover, more than a one-way\n\n2    broadcast of Abdel Rahman's views.    Abdel Rahman's comments were\n\n3    made in direct response to solicitations of his views from other\n\n4    al-Gama'a members who were seeking to effect an end to the cease-\n\n5    fire and to resume violence.   In light of the information\n\n6    available to Abdel Rahman at the time, a reasonable jury could\n\n7    have read his statements as tailored to and necessary for\n\n8    al-Gama'a's operations and increased use of violence.   Viewed\n\n9    through this lens, Abdel Rahman's statements were not materially\n\n10   different in substance from a crime boss making decisions about\n\n11   his criminal enterprise from prison and ordering a \"hit.\"\n\n12             3. Proof Regarding Knowing or Intentional Provision of\n\n13   Material Support.   Stewart and Yousry argue that the prosecution\n\n14   did not prove the requisite mental state to sustain their\n\n15   convictions.   They contend that they were not aware of the\n\n16   existence of the conspiracy charged in Count Two and therefore\n\n17   could not have intended to aid it.\n\n18             These arguments are unavailing.   From the evidence at\n\n19   trial, a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that Stewart\n\n20   and Yousry knew (1) that an active group of people within\n\n21   al-Gama'a including, most notably, Taha, sought to commit violent\n\n22   crimes but were hindered by the cease-fire and by those members\n\n23   of al-Gama'a who sought to adhere to it; (2) that the support of\n\n24   Abdel Rahman -- a key leader of the group -- was critical to the\n\n25   continued maintenance of the cease-fire; and (3) that, in light\n\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\f1    of the letters and messages from Taha and Sattar that Yousry read\n\n2    to Abdel Rahman in prison, Abdel Rahman's particular opinion\n\n3    regarding the cease-fire -- and not the view of any other person\n\n4    -- would be dispositive on the question of whether al-Gama'a\n\n5    members would continue to abide by the cease-fire.   A reasonable\n\n6    factfinder could thus have concluded that Yousry and Stewart\n\n7    actively and intentionally facilitated communications between\n\n8    Abdel Rahman and al-Gama'a, in part by engaging in various ruses\n\n9    during the course of their visits to Abdel Rahman, and thereby\n\n10   effectively delivered Abdel Rahman's order to commit violence.\n\n11   Stewart also did so by reaffirming to the press Abdel Rahman's\n\n12   stated withdrawal of support for the cease-fire, thereby\n\n13   dispelling any notion that the message came not from Abdel Rahman\n\n14   himself, but was instead fabricated by members of the pro-\n\n15   violence faction of al-Gama'a.\n\n16   C. Other Challenges with Respect to 18 U.S.C. § 2339A\n\n17             1. Vagueness.   Section 2339A criminalizes the provision\n\n18   of material support or resources \"knowing or intending\" that they\n\n19   are to be used to assist in certain enumerated crimes of\n\n20   terrorism.   18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (full text set forth on page\n\n21   [38], supra).   Stewart and Yousry assert that insofar as the\n\n22   statute does not require \"conscious, knowing intent\" or\n\n23   \"knowledge and intent,\" the statute is unconstitutionally vague\n\n24   as applied to them.   They argue that the district court should\n\n25   have dismissed the section 2339A charges for substantially the\n\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\f1    same reasons that it dismissed the section 2339B charges that\n\n2    were contained in the initial indictment.    The government urges\n\n3    to the contrary that the text of section 2339A, which requires\n\n4    \"knowing or intending,\" 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (emphasis added), is\n\n5    sufficiently precise.\n\n6                In analyzing the defendants' arguments in this regard,\n\n7    we must focus on two major differences between the initial and\n\n8    superseding indictment.\n\n9                First, the statutes upon which they were based differ.\n\n10   Unlike section 2339A, section 2339B penalizes the knowing\n\n11   provision of material support alone.    Unlike section 2339A,\n\n12   section 2339B does not require for conviction proof that the\n\n13   defendant has provided support or resources with the knowledge or\n\n14   intent that such resources be used to commit specific violent\n\n15   crimes.20\n\n16               Second, the factual bases for the charges differ.   In\n\n17   the initial indictment, the government alleged that the\n\n18   defendants violated section 2339B by the \"provision\" of\n\n19   \"communications equipment\" to the conspiracy, Sattar I, 272 F.\n\n20   Supp. 2d at 357, and the \"provision\" of themselves as \"personnel\"\n\n21   to the conspiracy, id. at 358.    In the superseding indictment,\n\n22   the government charged instead that the defendants acted with the\n\n23   \"knowledge or intent\" to provide material support.    And rather\n\n\n          20\n            As already noted, the propriety   of the district court's\n     dismissal of the section 2339B charges   from the initial\n     indictment is not before us; we assume   for purposes of this\n     discussion that the district court was   correct.\n                                      -46-\n\f1    than proceeding on the theory that the defendants provided\n\n2    themselves as \"personnel\" to the conspiracy, the superseding\n\n3    indictment alleges that the defendants provided Abdel Rahman as\n\n4    the \"personnel.\"\n\n5              As we have explained, the district court dismissed the\n\n6    section 2339B charges on the ground that they were\n\n7    unconstitutional as applied to the defendants.      The basis for\n\n8    dismissal of the \"communications equipment\" charges was that the\n\n9    statute, as read to apply to the facts of this case, could\n\n10   \"criminaliz[e] the mere use of phones and other means of\n\n11   communication [with] neither notice nor standards for [the\n\n12   statute's] application.\"      Id.   And the basis for the dismissal of\n\n13   the \"personnel\" charges, as framed in the initial indictment, was\n\n14   that such a charge could criminalize the actions of \"'[s]omeone\n\n15   who advocates the cause of the [Foreign Terrorist\n\n16   Organization].'\"    Id. at 359 (quoting Humanitarian Law Project v.\n\n17   Reno, 205 F.3d 1130, 1137 (9th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S.\n\n18   904 (2001)) (brackets omitted).       Without more, the district court\n\n19   concluded, such conduct cannot be punished without violating the\n\n20   First Amendment.    See id.\n\n21             The initial charges raised the possibility, moreover,\n\n22   that under the government's reading of the statute, \"a lawyer,\n\n23   acting as an agent of her client, an alleged leader of an FTO,\n\n24   could [be] subject to criminal prosecution as a 'quasi-\n\n25   employee.'\"   Id.   As we shall see, the charges in the superseding\n\n26   indictment do not pose this risk.\n\n                                         -47-\n\f1               A statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied \"if it\n\n2    fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable\n\n3    opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\" or \"if it\n\n4    authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory\n\n5    enforcement.\"   Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000); accord\n\n6    United States v. Rybicki, 354 F.3d 124, 132 (2d Cir. 2003) (en\n\n7    banc), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 809 (2004).   As a general matter,\n\n8    scienter requirements may \"ameliorate[]\" concerns of improper\n\n9    notice.   See Hill, 530 U.S. at 732.\n\n10              We are satisfied that section 2339A's knowledge-or-\n\n11   intent formulation saves the statute from being\n\n12   unconstitutionally vague as applied here.   Unlike the application\n\n13   of section 2339B proposed in the initial indictment, the\n\n14   superseding indictment required the jury to find that the\n\n15   defendants knew or intended the criminal uses to which the\n\n16   conspiracy would put the material support they provided, thereby\n\n17   eliminating concerns about inadequate notice.   In other words, if\n\n18   Stewart and Yousry knew that their actions provided material\n\n19   support to a conspiracy to end the cease-fire and thereby unloose\n\n20   deadly acts of terrorism by al-Gama'a and others, then they were\n\n21   on notice that what they were doing was prohibited by a statute\n\n22   that criminalizes the provision of material support \"knowing or\n\n23   intending that [such support is] to be used in preparation for,\n\n24   or in carrying out,\" criminal actions.   18 U.S.C. § 2339A.\n\n25              Stewart and Yousry argue nonetheless that several\n\n26   statutory terms, such as \"personnel,\" are unconstitutionally\n\n                                    -48-\n\f1    vague as applied to them.    They note that \"personnel,\" undefined\n\n2    at the relevant time, applies equally to sections 2339A and\n\n3    2339B, compare id. § 2339A(b)(1) (2000) with id. § 2339B(g)(4)\n\n4    (2000).21   They point out that the district court held this term\n\n5    to be unconstitutionally vague in Sattar I.      See 272 F. Supp. 2d\n\n6    at 360.\n\n7                We agree, however, with the district court's conclusion\n\n8    that \"[t]he meaning of 'personnel' is clear in the context of\n\n9    § 2339A when applied to personnel who are to be used in\n\n10   preparation for, or in carrying out, specific crimes.\"      Sattar\n\n11   III, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 301 n.11.      By applying, in the first\n\n\n          21\n            At the time of the alleged criminal acts, \"personnel\" was\n     undefined. In December 2004, the term \"personnel\" was changed to\n     \"personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include\n     oneself).\" See Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act,\n     Pub. L. No. 108-458, § 6603(b), 118 Stat. 3638, 3762 (codified at\n     18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b)(1)). By the same act, the term was defined\n     in more detail for purposes of section 2339B:\n\n                 No person may be prosecuted under [section\n                 2339B] in connection with the term\n                 \"personnel\" unless that person has knowingly\n                 provided, attempted to provide, or conspired\n                 to provide a foreign terrorist organization\n                 with 1 or more individuals (who may be or\n                 include himself) to work under that terrorist\n                 organization's direction or control or to\n                 organize, manage, supervise, or otherwise\n                 direct the operation of that organization.\n                 Individuals who act entirely independently of\n                 the foreign terrorist organization to advance\n                 its goals or objectives shall not be\n                 considered to be working under the foreign\n                 terrorist organization's direction and\n                 control.\n\n     Id. § 6603(f),118 Stat. at 3763 (codified at 18 U.S.C.\n     § 2339B(h)). This amended definition applies to section 2339B\n     but not to section 2339A.\n                                     -49-\n\f1    indictment, the prohibition against providing \"personnel\" to the\n\n2    conspiracy to a circumstance in which the defendants provided\n\n3    themselves, the government created a situation in which the\n\n4    defendants could be punished for, in effect, providing themselves\n\n5    to speak out in support of the program or principles of a foreign\n\n6    terrorist organization, an activity protected by the First\n\n7    Amendment.    See Sattar I, 272 F. Supp. 2d at 359.   The more\n\n8    limited charge that they knowingly or intentionally provided\n\n9    Abdel Rahman (as \"personnel\"), whose voice of command or words of\n\n10   approbation were a means by which al-Gama'a members could prepare\n\n11   for, or carry out, terrorist acts in Egypt, does not carry the\n\n12   same risk with its corresponding constitutional implications.\n\n13             In addition, the heightened scienter requirement in\n\n14   section 2339A constrains prosecutorial discretion, and\n\n15   ameliorates concerns of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\n\n16   Similar scienter requirements have saved other statutes from\n\n17   void-for-vagueness challenges.    See, e.g., Hill, 530 U.S. at 732;\n\n18   see also Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 395 & n.13 (1979)\n\n19   (citing cases); United States v. Curcio, 712 F.2d 1532, 1543 (2d\n\n20   Cir. 1983).\n\n21             2. Nature of the Offense.     Stewart and Yousry also\n\n22   contend that Count Four, alleging a conspiracy to violate section\n\n23   2339A, acts impermissibly as a charge of a \"multi-level inchoate\n\n24   offense,\" a \"logical absurdity\" that \"violate[s] due process.\"\n\n25   Stewart Br. 161-65.    The gist of their argument is that the\n\n26   charge effectively criminalizes a \"conspiracy to conspire,\"\n\n                                      -50-\n\f1    thereby violating due process by extending criminal liability to\n\n2    a degree too remote from any substantive criminal offense to pass\n\n3    constitutional muster.   Id. at 165-69.   We need not consider this\n\n4    argument;22 Count Five charges the knowing provision of aid -- a\n\n5    substantive, not inchoate, offense -- and Count Four, pursuing a\n\n6    conspiracy to commit that substantive offense, functions as a\n\n7    traditional conspiracy charge.\n\n8               As what seems to us to be a variation on the same\n\n9    theme, Stewart and Yousry assert that the district court erred by\n\n10   \"impermissibly dilut[ing]\" the proof required for conviction of\n\n11   the Count-Two conspiracy in the context of the material support\n\n12   convictions under section 2339A.    Stewart Br. 158.   But the\n\n13   government need not have established beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n14   that Stewart or Yousry engaged in a conspiracy to kidnap or\n\n15   commit murder abroad; neither was charged with doing either.\n\n16   Instead, both were charged with and convicted of violating\n\n17   section 2339A, and, as discussed, the evidence is sufficient to\n\n18   sustain the conviction on those charges.    Stewart and Yousry do\n\n19   not, presumably because they cannot, suggest that Congress did\n\n20   not have the power to criminalize the relevant underlying\n\n21   conduct.\n\n\n\n\n          22\n             We note nonetheless that the defendants do not provide\n     authority for their argument that a \"multi-level inchoate\n     offense\" such as a conspiracy to conspire would violate the Due\n     Process Clause.\n                                      -51-\n\f1               V. Counts Six and Seven\n\n2               Stewart challenges her convictions on Counts Six and\n\n3    Seven for violating the blanket provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1001,\n\n4    which subjects to criminal sanctions\n\n5               whoever, in any matter within the\n6               jurisdiction of the executive, legislative,\n7               or judicial branch of the Government of the\n8               United States, knowingly and willfully--\n 9                   (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by\n10              any trick, scheme, or device a material fact;\n11                   (2) makes any materially false,\n12              fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\n13              representation; or\n14                   (3) makes or uses any false writing or\n15              document knowing the same to contain any\n16              materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\n17              statement or entry. . . .\n18   18 U.S.C. § 1001(a).   Stewart argues that, at worst, she broke a\n\n19   promise, and that the statute criminalizes false statements, not\n\n20   false promises.\n\n21              We conclude otherwise.    On May 16, 2000, Stewart signed\n\n22   an affirmation stating that she would (\"shall\") abide by the\n\n23   SAMs.   On May 26, 2000, Stewart submitted the affirmation to the\n\n24   United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New\n\n25   York.   On May 7, 2001, Stewart signed a revised affirmation to\n\n26   the same effect and telecopied it to the same office.    Before,\n\n27   after, and between executing these affirmations, she helped\n\n28   smuggle messages to and from Abdel Rahman in violation of the\n\n29   SAMs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -52-\n\f1               Stewart at least thrice affirmed \"under the penalties\n\n2    of perjury the truth\" of certain statements.    The May 16, 2000,\n\n3    statement reads in pertinent part:\n\n 4              I . . . understand that neither I nor any\n 5              member of my office shall forward any mail\n 6              received from inmate Abdel Rahman to a third\n 7              person. Nor shall I use my meetings,\n 8              correspondence or phone calls with Abdel\n 9              Rahman to pass messages between third parties\n10              (including, but not limited to, the media)\n11              and Abdel Rahman.\n\n12   Stewart May 2000 Aff. (Gov't Ex. 7.)    In the May 7, 2001,\n\n13   statement, Stewart affirmed:\n\n14              I . . . specifically understand that the\n15              meetings shall not be for the purpose of\n16              presenting statements to the defense team for\n17              further dissemination to third parties,\n18              including the media. I will only allow the\n19              meetings to be used for legal discussion\n20              between Abdel Rahman and me.\n21\n22   Stewart May 2001 Aff. (Gov't Ex. 12.)\n\n23              A reasonable factfinder was entitled to conclude that\n\n24   Stewart affirmed under penalty of perjury that she had the then-\n\n25   present intent to have her actions conform to the terms of the\n\n26   SAMs.   From Stewart's smuggling messages to and from Abdel\n\n27   Rahman, the factfinder could conclude that the assertion about\n\n28   her intent was knowingly and willfully false when it was made.\n\n29   See United States v. Urum, 148 F.2d 187, 189 (2d Cir. 1945)\n\n30   (concluding that allegation of a false representation as to\n\n31   future use of loan proceeds was \"an allegation of a present\n\n32   statement and the assertion of existing intent\"); cf. United\n\n33   States v. Shah, 44 F.3d 285, 294 (5th Cir. 1995) (observing that\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\f1    \"a promise may amount to a 'false, fictitious or fraudulent'\n\n2    statement if it is made without any present intention of\n\n3    performance and under circumstances such that it plainly, albeit\n\n4    implicitly, represents the present existence of an intent to\n\n5    perform\").\n\n6                Stewart seeks support for her argument from Williams v.\n\n7    United States, 458 U.S. 279 (1982).    There, the Supreme Court\n\n8    reversed a conviction of the defendant under 18 U.S.C. § 1014 for\n\n9    his making of a \"false statement\" -- a check drawn on an account\n\n10   containing insufficient funds -- for the purpose of influencing\n\n11   the actions of a federally insured institution.    But central to\n\n12   the Williams Court's analysis was the proposition that a check,\n\n13   even a bad check, \"is not a factual assertion at all.\"    Id. at\n\n14   284.    A check \"d[oes] not, in terms, make any representation as\n\n15   to the state of [the drawer's] bank balance\" but \"serve[s] only\n\n16   to direct the drawee banks to pay the face amounts to the bearer,\n\n17   while committing [the drawer] to make good the obligations if the\n\n18   banks dishonor[] the drafts.\"    Id. at 284-85.\n\n19               Williams does not apply to the conduct at issue here.\n\n20   A reasonable jury could have concluded that Stewart's\n\n21   affirmations that she would abide by the SAMs amounted to factual\n\n22   assertions regarding her then-present intent to abide by the\n\n23   SAMs.    Based on her repeated affirmations, and her repeated\n\n24   violations of those affirmations, moreover, a reasonable jury\n\n25   could have concluded that at the time Stewart executed and\n\n26   submitted the affirmations at issue, she did not intend to abide\n\n                                     -54-\n\f1    by them -- in other words, that her representations were\n\n2    knowingly false when made.    On this basis, a reasonable jury\n\n3    could have properly concluded that Stewart violated section 1001\n\n4    as charged in Counts Six and Seven.\n\n5               VI.   General Challenges to the\n6                     Validity of the Convictions\n\n7               In addition to their challenges to specific counts in\n\n8    the indictment, Stewart and Sattar make general assertions of\n\n9    error regarding the government's conduct during the course of the\n\n10   prosecution.     Stewart argues that she was selectively prosecuted\n\n11   on account of her gender and political beliefs, and both Stewart\n\n12   and Sattar assert that the government's decision to file a\n\n13   superseding indictment following their successful efforts to\n\n14   dismiss several counts of the initial indictment constitutes\n\n15   vindictive prosecution.\n\n16              The defendants also raise various challenges to the\n\n17   district court's case administration.    First, they allege a\n\n18   variety of pretrial errors: in the denial of their motions to\n\n19   sever their trial from Sattar's; in the empaneling of an\n\n20   anonymous jury; in the denial of Stewart's motion to suppress\n\n21   certain evidence obtained pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence\n\n22   Surveillance Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-511, 92 Stat. 1783, 50\n\n23   U.S.C. §§ 1801 et seq. (\"FISA\"); and in the denial of Stewart's\n\n24   motion for disclosure of whether she, her co-defendants, or\n\n25   others were subject to surveillance by the National Security\n\n26   Agency.   The defendants also argue that the district court made\n\n\n                                      -55-\n\f1    various evidentiary errors.     Finally, the defendants argue that\n\n2    the district court erred in addressing post-conviction claims of\n\n3    juror misconduct.\n\n4    A.   Selective Prosecution\n\n5               Stewart argues that she was selectively prosecuted on\n\n6    account of her gender and political beliefs in violation of the\n\n7    Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.     This\n\n8    argument requires Stewart to establish that she was \"treated\n\n9    differently from other similarly situated individuals\" and that\n\n10   \"such differential treatment was based on impermissible\n\n11   considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or\n\n12   punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad\n\n13   faith intent to injure [her].\"     Harlen Assocs. v. Inc. Vill. of\n\n14   Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation\n\n15   marks omitted); accord United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59\n\n16   (2d Cir. 1992); United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d 1210, 1229 (2d\n\n17   Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 971 (1984).\n\n18              Stewart compares her treatment with that of Abdel\n\n19   Rahman's former lawyers Ramsey Clark and Abdeen Jabara, who, even\n\n20   though they allegedly violated the same SAMs as she did, were not\n\n21   prosecuted for doing so.     Clark's and Jabara's alleged\n\n22   misconduct, however, was different from Stewart's adjudicated\n\n23   misconduct in at least one crucial respect: both Clark and Jabara\n\n24   refused to publicize Abdel Rahman's withdrawal of support for the\n\n25   al-Gama'a cease-fire, something Stewart did at least twice.     Like\n\n26   Stewart, Clark spoke to the media on Abdel Rahman's behalf.     But\n\n                                      -56-\n\f1    unlike Stewart, the message Clark disseminated in apparent\n\n2    violation of the SAMs -- that Abdel Rahman did not support the\n\n3    formation of a political party in Egypt -- did not have the same\n\n4    potential for inciting violence.   For that reason and those set\n\n5    forth by the district court in its decisions addressing the\n\n6    matter, see Sattar V, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 103 (denying selective\n\n7    prosecution claim), cf. Sattar III, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 311-14\n\n8    (denying vindictive prosecution claim), and Order, Sept. 1, 2004\n\n9    (denying selective prosecution claim), Stewart's arguments in\n\n10   this regard are without merit.23\n\n11   B. Vindictive Prosecution\n\n12             Sattar argues that the district court erred in denying\n\n13   his motion to dismiss the Count-Two conspiracy charge in the\n\n14   superseding indictment because the institution of the charge was\n\n15   driven by prosecutorial vindictiveness.   This argument is also\n\n16   without merit.\n\n17             The government filed the original five-count indictment\n\n18   in April 2002.   In it, Sattar, Stewart, Yousry, and another24\n\n          23\n            In rejecting Stewart's selective prosecution claim in\n     part by comparison with Clark's and Jabara's alleged misbehavior,\n     we do not, of course, suggest our approval of Clark's or Jabara's\n     remarkable alleged courses of conduct. But neither of them was\n     indicted or tried for, let alone convicted of, a crime. We are\n     therefore reluctant to comment on their alleged misdeeds at any\n     length. Stewart cites them as evidence of selective prosecution,\n     however, and we therefore note an important difference between\n     Clark and Jabara's alleged actions and Stewart's -- that she,\n     unlike either of them, was willing to issue a public statement\n     regarding Abdel Rahman's changed position on the cease fire.\n          24\n            In addition to the defendants here, the initial\n     indictment also named Yassir Al-Sirri, a/k/a \"Abu Ammar\" as a\n                                                        (continued...)\n                                    -57-\n\f1    were charged with providing, attempting to provide, and\n\n2    conspiring to provide, material support and resources to an FTO\n\n3    in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B.    Sattar moved to dismiss these\n\n4    charges on the ground that section 2339B was unconstitutionally\n\n5    vague as applied to the allegations in the indictment.    By\n\n6    opinion and order dated July 22, 2003, the district court agreed\n\n7    with Sattar.   Sattar I, 272 F. Supp. 2d at 358-61.   Following\n\n8    that decision, the government filed a superseding indictment\n\n9    adding a new count charging Sattar with conspiring to murder\n\n10   persons in a foreign country in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 956.\n\n11              Sattar argues that the government's decision to file\n\n12   the superseding indictment and add the charge of violating\n\n13   section 956 \"was a retaliatory act . . . motivated by the\n\n14   embarrassment [the government] suffered as a result of the\n\n15   dismissal\" of two central counts in the original indictment.\n\n16   Sattar Br. 17.   He asserts that an inference of vindictive\n\n17   prosecution is supportable in two ways:   First, the addition of\n\n18   Count Two -- which carries a potential sentence of life\n\n19   imprisonment, a longer sentence than that authorized by the\n\n20   dismissed charge pursuant to section 2339B -- \"up[ped] the ante\"\n\n21   for the consequences of conviction.   Sattar III, 314 F. Supp. 2d\n\n22   at 311.   Second, the government could have brought the section\n\n23   956 charge in the original indictment, inasmuch as it was based\n\n\n\n          24\n           (...continued)\n     defendant. The superseding indictment named him as an unindicted\n     co-conspirator, instead.\n                                   -58-\n\f1    on information known to the government prior to the filing of the\n\n2    initial indictment, but the government declined to do so.\n\n3              \"[T]he decision as to whether to prosecute generally\n\n4    rests within the broad discretion of the prosecutor, and a\n\n5    prosecutor's pretrial charging decision is presumed legitimate.\"\n\n6    United States v. Sanders, 211 F.3d 711, 716 (2d Cir.), cert.\n\n7    denied, 531 U.S. 1015 (2000) (citations and internal quotation\n\n8    marks omitted).   Nonetheless, \"a prosecution brought with\n\n9    vindictive motive, penalizing those who choose to exercise\n\n10   constitutional rights, would be patently unconstitutional.\"    Id.\n\n11   (internal quotation marks omitted).    We will dismiss an\n\n12   indictment if actual vindictiveness has been demonstrated, or if,\n\n13   under the circumstances, \"there is a presumption of\n\n14   vindictiveness that has not been rebutted by objective evidence\n\n15   justifying the prosecutor's action.\"    Id. (internal quotation\n\n16   marks omitted).\n\n17             We review a district court's factual findings on\n\n18   prosecutorial vindictiveness for clear error, and its legal\n\n19   conclusions de novo.   United States v. Johnson, 171 F.3d 139, 140\n\n20   (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam).   We review a district court's\n\n21   decision denying discovery on claims of prosecutorial\n\n22   vindictiveness for abuse of discretion.    Sanders, 211 F.3d at\n\n23   717.\n\n24             \"Th[e] need to avoid the appearance of vindictiveness\n\n25   has taken the form of a presumption of prosecutorial\n\n26   vindictiveness . . . , applied when (but only when) the\n\n                                    -59-\n\f1    circumstances of a case pose a \"realistic likelihood\" of such\n\n2    vindictiveness.    United States v. King, 126 F.3d 394, 397 (2d\n\n3    Cir. 1997) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).      The\n\n4    district court found no reason to presume that the actions at\n\n5    issue, which arose in a pretrial setting, were vindictive.      See\n\n6    Sattar III, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 311-12.\n\n7                \"The circumstances must present a realistic likelihood\n\n8    of vindictiveness that would be applicable in all cases, and any\n\n9    such presumption may be overcome by objective evidence justifying\n\n10   the prosecutor's action.\"    Sanders, 211 F.3d at 717 (citations\n\n11   and internal quotation marks omitted).    \"[T]his court has\n\n12   consistently adhered to the principle that the presumption of\n\n13   prosecutorial vindictiveness does not exist in a pretrial\n\n14   setting.\"    Paradise v. CCI Warden, 136 F.3d 331, 335 (2d Cir.),\n\n15   cert. denied, 525 U.S. 836 (1998) (internal quotation marks\n\n16   omitted); see also Sanders, 211 F.3d at 717 (same).    Sattar\n\n17   provides no reason for us to deviate from this general rule here,\n\n18   and no basis upon which we can conclude that the district court's\n\n19   findings in this respect were clearly erroneous.\n\n20               Sattar's claim of actual, as opposed to presumptive,\n\n21   vindictiveness is also without merit.    A finding of actual\n\n22   vindictiveness requires a showing that a \"prosecutor's charging\n\n23   decision [is] a 'direct and unjustifiable penalty,' that resulted\n\n24   'solely from the defendant's exercise of a protected legal\n\n25   right.'\"    Sanders, 211 F.3d at 716-17 (internal citation\n\n26   omitted).    The evidence Sattar offers in this regard is that the\n\n                                     -60-\n\f1    government possessed the same information when preparing the\n\n2    original and superseding indictments, that the maximum punishment\n\n3    Sattar faced if convicted under the superseding indictment was\n\n4    greater than that he faced if convicted under the original\n\n5    indictment, and that the superseding indictment was the result of\n\n6    the district court's dismissal of the section 2339B material\n\n7    support charges in the original indictment.   We have no warrant\n\n8    to conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that\n\n9    the charging decision was not vindictive, or that the government\n\n10   was attempting to do anything more than hold Sattar criminally\n\n11   responsible for engaging in the underlying acts that form the\n\n12   basis of the indictment.   See Paradise, 136 F.3d at 336.   Put\n\n13   another way, it does not follow from the facts Sattar recites\n\n14   that the resulting charge was necessarily brought vindictively;\n\n15   for this reason the district court did not err in concluding\n\n16   otherwise.\n\n17   C. Trial Administration\n\n18             1. Alleged Pre-Trial Errors\n\n19             a. Severance\n\n20             Stewart and Yousry assert that the district court\n\n21   abused its discretion by denying their motions to sever their\n\n22   trial from the trial of Sattar because Sattar was charged with,\n\n23   and convicted of, conspiracy to murder persons in a foreign\n\n24   country -- allegations different from and more serious than those\n\n25   with which Stewart and Yousry were charged.   To succeed on this\n\n26   argument, Stewart and Yousry must show that the district court\n                                    -61-\n\f1    abused its discretion in this regard and that the resulting\n\n2    prejudice rose to the level of \"a miscarriage of justice.\"     See\n\n3    United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 150 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n4    Stewart and Yousry complain primarily that as a result of the\n\n5    district court's denial of their motion for severance, evidence\n\n6    irrelevant to their actions and unfairly prejudicial to their\n\n7    case permeated the trial.   They further contend that the volume\n\n8    of limiting instructions given to the jury rendered them\n\n9    effectively useless in attempting to curb any prejudicial effect.\n\n10             But the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\n11   this respect.   Count Two charged Sattar with conspiring to murder\n\n12   persons in a foreign country.   Count Five charged Stewart and\n\n13   Yousry with providing and concealing material support to that\n\n14   conspiracy, and Count Four charged them with conspiring to\n\n15   provide and conceal that support.      Most of the evidence against\n\n16   Sattar that Stewart and Yousry assert to have been unduly\n\n17   prejudicial to them -- evidence submitted to establish the\n\n18   existence of the Count-Two conspiracy charge against Sattar --\n\n19   would have been admissible against Stewart and Yousry even had\n\n20   the trial been severed.   See Sattar I, 272 F. Supp. 2d at 380-81.\n\n21   This is so because the Count-Two conspiracy was an element of the\n\n22   crimes charged against Stewart and Yousry in Counts Four and\n\n23   Five, and the government would have been entitled, and expected,\n\n24   to elicit relevant evidence regarding its existence.     \"[T]he fact\n\n25   that testimony against a codefendant may be harmful is not a\n\n26   ground for severance if that testimony would also be admissible\n\n                                     -62-\n\f1    against the moving defendant tried separately.\"    United States v.\n\n2    Rosa, 11 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S.\n\n3    1042 (1994).\n\n4                To the extent that evidence introduced at trial was not\n\n5    admissible against a particular defendant, the district court\n\n6    gave detailed -- if necessarily voluminous -- curative\n\n7    instructions to the jury.    Neither Stewart nor Yousry proffer\n\n8    instructions that should have been given, but were not.      Nor do\n\n9    they identify improper curative instructions that were given.\n\n10   This is not a case where \"the risk that the jury [would] not, or\n\n11   [could] not, follow instructions [was] so great, and the\n\n12   consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the\n\n13   practical and human limitations of the jury system [could not] be\n\n14   ignored.\"    Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 135 (1968).\n\n15   Despite the length of the instructions, we presume, as did the\n\n16   district court, see Sattar V, 395 F. Supp. 2d. at 104, that the\n\n17   jurors followed them, see, e.g., Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S.\n\n18   200, 206 (1987) (noting that it is an \"almost invariable\n\n19   assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\");\n\n20   United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 116 (2d Cir. 1998), cert.\n\n21   denied, 525 U.S. 1112 (1999) (\"Juries are presumed to follow\n\n22   their instructions.\"    (internal quotation marks and brackets\n\n23   omitted)).    Neither Stewart nor Yousry provide us with a\n\n24   convincing reason to conclude that the district court abused its\n\n25   discretion in this regard.\n\n\n\n                                     -63-\n\f1               b. Empaneling an Anonymous Jury\n\n2               By order dated April 29, 2004, the district court\n\n3    granted the government's motion to empanel an anonymous jury, in\n\n4    light of the substantial publicity surrounding the case and the\n\n5    seriousness and nature of the charges in the indictment,\n\n6    especially the charge that the defendants had attempted \"to\n\n7    interfere with the ordered procedures of law enforcement and the\n\n8    judicial process.\"   Order, Apr. 29, 2004.   As a general rule, a\n\n9    district court may order the empaneling of an anonymous jury upon\n\n10   \"(a) concluding that there is strong reason to believe the jury\n\n11   needs protection, and (b) taking reasonable precautions to\n\n12   minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant and to ensure\n\n13   that his fundamental rights are protected.\"   United States v.\n\n14   Paccione, 949 F.2d 1183, 1192 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 505\n\n15   U.S. 1220 (1992).    A defendant's apparent \"willingness to tamper\n\n16   with the judicial process\" will support the use of an anonymous\n\n17   panel.   United States v. Aulicino, 44 F.3d 1102, 1116 (2d Cir.\n\n18   1995) (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted).     Where\n\n19   otherwise warranted,\n\n20              the use of an anonymous jury does not\n21              infringe a defendant's constitutional rights,\n22              so long as the court conducts a careful voir\n23              dire designed to uncover any bias as to the\n24              issues or the defendants and takes care to\n25              give the jurors a plausible and non-\n26              prejudicial reason for not disclosing their\n27              identities.\n\n28   Id.   If \"there is evidence to support the district court's\n\n29   finding of reason to believe the jury needs protection,\" and if\n\n                                     -64-\n\f1    \"the court has taken reasonable precautions to minimize any\n\n2    prejudicial effects on the defendant and to ensure protection of\n\n3    his fundamental rights, the decision to empanel an anonymous jury\n\n4    is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\"     United States v.\n\n5    Thai, 29 F.3d 785, 801 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 977\n\n6    (1994).\n\n7               In light of (a) the charges against the defendants,\n\n8    which included a terrorist conspiracy to murder, and Stewart's\n\n9    and Yousry's alleged provision of material support to that\n\n10   conspiracy; (b) the reasonable likelihood that the pervasive\n\n11   issue of terrorism would raise in the jurors' minds a fear for\n\n12   their individual safety; (c) the fact that the charges against\n\n13   Stewart and Yousry were in significant part about their alleged\n\n14   corruption of the judicial process; (d) the widespread pretrial\n\n15   publicity about the case; and (e) the extensiveness of the voir\n\n16   dire administered to the jury by the court, we conclude that the\n\n17   district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n18              c. Pre-Trial Suppression of Evidence\n\n19                   i. Suppression of Evidence Obtained Pursuant to\n\n20   FISA.   The defendants argue that evidence obtained from\n\n21   electronic surveillance pursuant to FISA should have been\n\n22   suppressed because such surveillance was improperly instituted\n\n23   for the purpose of a criminal investigation, rather than for the\n\n24   gathering of intelligence, and because FISA was unconstitutional\n\n25   as applied in this case.\n\n\n\n                                    -65-\n\f1              By Opinion and Order dated September 15, 2003, the\n\n2    district court denied the defendants' motions to suppress the\n\n3    relevant evidence.   Sattar II, 2003 WL 22137012, at *22, 2003\n\n4    U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16164, at *70.   At a pretrial hearing held on\n\n5    April 9, 2002, the government informed the district court and the\n\n6    defendants that it had\n\n 7             conducted a series of court-authorized\n 8             electronic surveillance over a period of\n 9             several years authorized under [FISA],\n10             consisting of the electronic surveillance of\n11             defendant Sattar's home phone, his computer,\n12             [and] fax machine, [and] defendant Yousry's\n13             telephone. The government also monitored\n14             several prison visits, both audio and video,\n15             to Sheik Abdel Rahman over the past several\n16             years, one of which involved defendant\n17             Stewart in May of 2000.\n\n18   Id. at *2, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16164, at *6.   A month later, by\n\n19   letter dated May 8, 2002, the government also informed the\n\n20   defendants that \"information obtained or derived pursuant to the\n\n21   authority of the FISA was used, and will continue to be used, in\n\n22   connection with the prosecution of [this] case.\"   Id.; see 50\n\n23   U.S.C. § 1806(c) (providing that where the government intends to\n\n24   disclose information obtained from FISA surveillance, the\n\n25   government \"shall, prior to the trial . . . notify the aggrieved\n\n26   person and the court . . . that the Government intends to so\n\n27   disclose or so use such information\").\n\n28             As part of its pretrial obligations under FISA, the\n\n29   government\n\n30             made extensive disclosures to the defendants,\n31             including over 85,000 audio recordings of\n32             voice calls, fax-machine sounds, and\n\n                                    -66-\n\f 1             computer-modem sounds obtained through audio\n 2             surveillance of telephone numbers used by\n 3             Sattar and Yousry; the FBI's written\n 4             summaries . . . of approximately 5,300 voice\n 5             calls that the FBI deemed to contain foreign\n 6             intelligence information and therefore did\n 7             not minimize; approximately 150 draft\n 8             transcripts of voice calls; and approximately\n 9             10,000 pages of e-mails obtained through\n10             electronic surveillance of an e-mail account\n11             used by Sattar. The Government has also\n12             disclosed certain evidence solely to Stewart\n13             and Yousry, including audiotapes of 63\n14             telephone conversations between the\n15             imprisoned Sheikh Abdel Rahman and his\n16             attorneys and Yousry, and audio and video\n17             recordings of three prison visits to Sheikh\n18             Abdel Rahman by his attorneys and Yousry on\n19             February 19, 2000, May 19 and 20, 2000, and\n20             July 13 and 14, 2001.\n\n21   Sattar II, 2003 WL 22137012, at *2, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16164,\n\n22   at *7.\n\n23             In accordance with the procedure set forth in FISA, see\n\n24   50 U.S.C. § 1806(e), Sattar and Stewart moved to suppress the\n\n25   evidence arising out of the FISA surveillance, and for access to\n\n26   classified information regarding that surveillance.   The\n\n27   government argues on appeal, as it did before the district court,\n\n28   that the FISA surveillance at issue was lawfully authorized and\n\n29   conducted.   The government moved the district court to order that\n\n30   none of the classified documents or classified information\n\n31   contained therein would need to be disclosed to the defendants.\n\n32   Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), the government requested that\n\n33   the court conduct an in camera and ex parte review of the\n\n34   materials and proffered an affidavit of then-Attorney General\n\n35   John Ashcroft stating, in relevant part, that \"it would harm the\n\n\n                                    -67-\n\f1    national security of the United States to disclose or have an\n\n2    adversary hearing with respect to materials submitted to the\n\n3    United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . . . in\n\n4    connection with this matter.\"    Sattar II, 2003 WL 22137012, at\n\n5    *5, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16164, at *18.\n\n6              After reviewing the classified materials, the district\n\n7    court concluded that \"all of the requirements of FISA were\n\n8    satisfied\" and \"each of the FISA surveillances was authorized by\n\n9    a FISA Court order that complied with the statutory requirements\n\n10   for such orders and was supported by the statements and\n\n11   certifications required by the statute.\"    Id. at *6, 2003 U.S.\n\n12   Dist. LEXIS 16164, at *21.    The district court also concluded\n\n13   that this was \"not a case where disclosure [of the classified\n\n14   FISA materials] was necessary or where a review of all of the\n\n15   materials suggested that due process required disclosure to the\n\n16   defendants.\"    Id. at *6, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16164, at *22.\n\n17             On appeal, Stewart argues that the materials generated\n\n18   pursuant to the FISA surveillance should have been suppressed\n\n19   because the surveillance was instituted for the purposes of a\n\n20   criminal investigation, not for the purpose of intelligence\n\n21   gathering.   In addition, Stewart contends that the FISA review\n\n22   process lacks meaningful judicial review, and that due process\n\n23   required that her counsel have access to the FISA applications\n\n24   and warrants.\n\n25             Stewart's attacks on the constitutionality of the FISA\n\n26   statute are foreclosed by this Court's decision in United States\n\n                                     -68-\n\f1    v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59 (2d Cir. 1984), which, despite its age,\n\n2    remains binding precedent in this Circuit.   There, we concluded\n\n3    that \"the procedures fashioned in FISA [are] a constitutionally\n\n4    adequate balancing of the individual's Fourth Amendment rights\n\n5    against the nation's need to obtain foreign intelligence\n\n6    information.\"   Id. at 73.\n\n7              Congress created the FISA system in an attempt to\n\n8    accommodate \"the legitimate need of Government for intelligence\n\n9    information and the protected rights of our citizens.\"    United\n\n10   States v. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. 297, 322-23 (1972).    As\n\n11   we have explained, \"Congress passed FISA to settle what it\n\n12   believed to be the unresolved question of the applicability of\n\n13   the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement to electronic\n\n14   surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, and to remove any\n\n15   doubt as to the lawfulness of such surveillance.\"   Duggan, 743\n\n16   F.2d at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted).   FISA's primary\n\n17   focus is surveillance for the purpose of gathering foreign\n\n18   intelligence information, which is defined to include\n\n19   \"information that relates to, and if concerning a United States\n\n20   person is necessary to, the ability of the United States to\n\n21   protect against [inter alia] international terrorism.\"    50 U.S.C.\n\n22   § 1801(e)(1).\n\n23             FISA established a court (the \"FISA Court\") comprised\n\n24   of designated district court judges (\"FISA Judges\").    The FISA\n\n25   Court has jurisdiction over applications for electronic\n\n26   surveillance relating to the gathering of potential foreign\n\n                                   -69-\n\f1    intelligence information under the procedures set forth in FISA.\n\n2    See id. § 1803.   FISA generally permits a federal officer, when\n\n3    authorized by the President of the United States acting through\n\n4    the Attorney General, to obtain from any FISA Judge an order\n\n5    \"approving electronic surveillance of a foreign power or an agent\n\n6    of a foreign power for the purpose of obtaining foreign\n\n7    intelligence information.\"   Id. § 1802(b).   \"[A] group engaged in\n\n8    international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor,\"\n\n9    is a \"foreign power,\" id. § 1801(a)(4), and an \"agent of a\n\n10   foreign power\" includes any person who \"knowingly engages in\n\n11   sabotage or international terrorism, or activities that are in\n\n12   preparation therefor, for or on behalf of a foreign power\" or\n\n13   \"knowingly aids or abets any person in [such] conduct,\" id.\n\n14   § 1801(b)(2)(C) & (E).\n\n15             In order to secure an order authorizing surveillance\n\n16   from a FISA Judge, the officer's application must meet the\n\n17   statutory requirements set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1804.   For\n\n18   example, the application must set forth the identity or\n\n19   description of the target of the surveillance, id. § 1804(a)(2),\n\n20   and a statement of facts and circumstances relied upon to justify\n\n21   the officer's belief that the target is a foreign power or agent\n\n22   of a foreign power and that each facility or location to be\n\n23   subjected to surveillance is being used or is about to be used by\n\n24   the target, id. § 1804(a)(3).   Prior to October 26, 2001, such a\n\n25   federal officer was required to certify to the FISA judge that\n\n26   \"the purpose\" of the FISA surveillance was the interception of\n\n                                     -70-\n\f1    foreign intelligence information.     See id. § 1804(a)(7)(B)\n\n2    (2000).   In Duggan, we interpreted this provision to mean that\n\n3    the interception of foreign intelligence information must be the\n\n4    \"primary objective\" of the surveillance.     Duggan, 743 F.2d at 77.\n\n5    The statute was changed in the wake of the events of September\n\n6    11, 2001, however, to require only that \"a significant purpose\"\n\n7    of the surveillance be the interception of such information.     See\n\n8    50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(7)(B) (2003); see also 50 U.S.C.\n\n9    § 1804(a)(6)(B) (2008) (redesignated from (a)(7)).\n\n10              Only after a FISA Judge has been satisfied that the\n\n11   application meets FISA's requirements will he or she authorize\n\n12   the surveillance.   To enter an order approving surveillance, the\n\n13   FISA Judge must find that the application was properly filed and\n\n14   properly authorized by the Attorney General; that associated\n\n15   procedures designed to minimize the acquisition and retention of\n\n16   non-publically available information concerning \"United States\n\n17   persons\" satisfy FISA's requirements, see id. § 1801(h); that the\n\n18   facts set forth in the application provide probable cause to\n\n19   believe that the target is a foreign power or agent of such a\n\n20   power; and that the locations to be subject to surveillance are\n\n21   being used, or are about to be used, by the target, id.\n\n22   § 1805(a).\n\n23              When the application is complete and properly certified\n\n24   by an executive branch official, however,\n\n25              it is, under FISA, subjected to only minimal\n26              scrutiny by the courts. Congress deemed it a\n27              sufficient check in this regard to require\n\n                                    -71-\n\f1              the FISA Judge (1) to find probable cause to\n2              believe that the target of the requested\n3              surveillance is an agent of a foreign power;\n4              (2) to find that the application is complete\n5              and in proper form; and (3) when the target\n6              is a United States person, to find that the\n7              certifications are not \"clearly erroneous.\"\n8\n9    Duggan, 743 F.2d at 77.   Stewart's argument that FISA does not\n\n10   ensure adequate judicial view is therefore foreclosed by Duggan.\n\n11   See id. at 77 & n.6.\n\n12             Although the purpose of the surveillance must be to\n\n13   obtain foreign intelligence information, \"otherwise valid FISA\n\n14   surveillance is not tainted simply because the government can\n\n15   anticipate that the fruits of such surveillance may later be\n\n16   used . . . as evidence in a criminal trial.\"     Id. at 78.   To the\n\n17   contrary, the statute specifically contemplates the introduction\n\n18   of FISA surveillance evidence in criminal prosecutions.       See 50\n\n19   U.S.C. § 1806(b).   As both Congress and this Court have\n\n20   recognized, \"in many cases the concerns of the government with\n\n21   respect to foreign intelligence will overlap those with respect\n\n22   to law enforcement.\"   Duggan, 743 F.2d at 78.\n\n23             When such FISA information is introduced in the course\n\n24   of a criminal prosecution, and upon review of a suppression\n\n25   motion, the trial court has the opportunity to review the FISA\n\n26   Court's order, issued pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1805, in light of\n\n27   the underlying applications for surveillance, filed pursuant to\n\n28   50 U.S.C. § 1804, in order \"to determine whether the surveillance\n\n29   [at issue] was lawfully authorized and conducted.\"     50 U.S.C.\n\n30   § 1806(f).   The district court's review of the FISA Judge's\n\n                                    -72-\n\f1    decision is, like the FISA Judge's decision itself, deferential.\n\n2    \"[A] reviewing court [has] no greater authority to second-guess\n\n3    the executive branch's certifications than has the FISA Judge.\"\n\n4    Duggan, 743 F.2d at 77.\n\n5                FISA applications are likely to contain allegedly\n\n6    sensitive information relating to perceived issues of national\n\n7    security.   The applications are required to set forth how and why\n\n8    the Executive Branch knows what it knows, which may include\n\n9    references to covert agents and informers.    For this reason, \"'ex\n\n10   parte, in camera determination is to be the rule.'\"    Id. at 78\n\n11   (quoting United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 147 (D.C. Cir.\n\n12   1982)).   The district court has the \"discretion to disclose\n\n13   portions of [relevant materials], under appropriate protective\n\n14   procedures, [but] only if [it] decides that such disclosure is\n\n15   'necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of\n\n16   the surveillance'\" or is otherwise required by due process.     Id.\n\n17   (quoting 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f)).\n\n18               Stewart argues on appeal that the \"primary purpose\" of\n\n19   the FISA wiretapping in this case was to pursue a criminal\n\n20   investigation, not to collect foreign intelligence information.\n\n21   The district court, having reviewed the FISA materials, concluded\n\n22   that \"all of the surveillance at issue was conducted with the\n\n23   appropriate purpose,\" whether with a \"primary purpose\" or \"a\n\n24   significant purpose\" to obtain foreign intelligence information.\n\n25   Sattar II, 2003 WL 22137012, at *12-*13, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n26   16164, at *40-*42.\n\n                                      -73-\n\f1              Upon our own in camera review of the underlying\n\n2    material and the district court's order filed under seal, we are\n\n3    confident that the district court did not err in so concluding.\n\n4    Since the interceptions meet the \"primary purpose\" test, we, like\n\n5    the district court, need not and do not address Stewart's\n\n6    argument that FISA's new and less demanding \"significant purpose\"\n\n7    test is unconstitutional.    Cf. In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717,\n\n8    735 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002) (rejecting the \"primary purpose\" test in\n\n9    favor of a \"significant purpose\" test).    Similarly, based on the\n\n10   relevant evidence which, as adduced at trial, is outlined above,\n\n11   the district court did not err in finding there to be \"ample\n\n12   probable cause to believe that the targets of the relevant\n\n13   surveillance -- Sattar, Yousry, and Sheikh Abdel Rahman -- were\n\n14   acting as agents of a foreign power\" as defined by FISA, i.e.,\n\n15   al-Gama'a, \"and that each of the facilities at which the\n\n16   surveillance was directed was being used, or was about to be\n\n17   used, by that target.\"   Sattar II, 2003 WL 22137012, at *7, 2003\n\n18   U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16164, at *24.\n\n19             Stewart also argues that she was an inappropriate\n\n20   target of the surveillance.    As the district court noted,\n\n21   however, Stewart was never designated as a target in any of the\n\n22   applications at issue; her alleged co-conspirators were.      \"Once\n\n23   the proper preconditions are established with respect to a\n\n24   particular target, there is no requirement in FISA that all those\n\n25   likely to be overheard engaging in foreign intelligence\n\n26   conversations be named.\"    Duggan, 743 F.2d at 79.   Because\n\n                                     -74-\n\f1    Stewart's co-conspirators were targeted pursuant to proper\n\n2    procedures, the Fourth Amendment did not require that Stewart\n\n3    also be identified or described as a target in order for her\n\n4    intercepted conversations to be used in a criminal prosecution.\n\n5    Id. at 79 n.7.\n\n6               Stewart further argues that the district court erred in\n\n7    declining to disclose FISA materials to her counsel.    The\n\n8    district court may order disclosure of FISA materials \"under\n\n9    appropriate security procedures and protective orders,\" but \"only\n\n10   where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate\n\n11   determination of the legality of the surveillance.\"    50 U.S.C.\n\n12   § 1806(f).   When the district court \"determines that the\n\n13   surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted, it shall deny\n\n14   the motion of the aggrieved person except to the extent that due\n\n15   process requires discovery or disclosure.\"   Id. § 1806(g).\n\n16              As we have noted, in these circumstances disclosure is\n\n17   the exception and \"'ex parte, in camera determination is [] the\n\n18   rule.'\"   Duggan, 743 F.2d at 78.   The need to disclose materials\n\n19   to defense counsel may arise if the judge determines there to be\n\n20   \"potential irregularities such as possible misrepresentation of\n\n21   fact, vague identification of the persons to be surveilled or\n\n22   surveillance records which include a significant amount of\n\n23   nonforeign intelligence information, calling into question\n\n24   compliance with the minimization standards contained in the\n\n25   order.\"   Id. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\n26   But Stewart does not point to any case where any court has\n\n                                    -75-\n\f1    ordered disclosure in a situation similar to hers.   Upon our own\n\n2    review of the materials, we conclude that there was no error in\n\n3    the district court's determination that disclosure was\n\n4    unnecessary for an accurate determination of the legality of the\n\n5    surveillance at issue or to satisfy the requirements of due\n\n6    process.\n\n7                   ii.   Disclosure Regarding NSA Surveillance.     On\n\n8    June 16, 2006, Stewart moved to compel disclosure as to whether\n\n9    she or any of her co-defendants were subject to surveillance by\n\n10   the National Security Agency (\"NSA\").   The government filed, ex\n\n11   parte, a classified response to be reviewed in camera.   At a\n\n12   hearing on September 25, 2006, the government insisted that its\n\n13   classified submission was properly filed under section 4 of the\n\n14   Classified Information Procedures Act (\"CIPA\"), Pub. L. No.\n\n15   96-456, 94 Stat. 2025 (1980) (codified at 18 U.S.C. app. 3).     The\n\n16   government also argued that none of the defense counsel was\n\n17   properly cleared for access to the information and that, \"without\n\n18   going into the details of the classification level of our\n\n19   submission, I don't think any defense counsel would ever have a\n\n20   need to know the details of the terrorist surveillance program,\n\n21   especially in this case.\"   H'g Tr. 13-14, Sept. 25, 2006.\n\n22   Following the hearing and in response to subsequent orders from\n\n23   the district court, the government filed supplemental ex parte\n\n24   confidential responses dated October 6, 2006, October 12, 2006,\n\n25   and October 13, 2006 for in camera review.   After additional\n\n26   materials were submitted by the government, the district court\n\n                                    -76-\n\f1    granted, in part, the motion for disclosure, ordering the\n\n2    government to make specified disclosures,25 but otherwise denied\n\n3    the motion.    Order, Oct. 17, 2006, at 2.   In that public order,\n\n4    the district court noted that it had filed an \"ex parte Order\n\n5    under seal containing classified information which explains in\n\n6    detail the reasons for the Court's decision,\" and found that\n\n7    there was a\n\n 8              compelling reason for filing the additional\n 9              Order ex parte and under seal because it\n10              contains classified information that cannot\n11              reasonably be segregated from the other\n12              material in the Order, and that such a filing\n13              is consistent with the Classified Procedures\n14              Act and the rights of the defendants. See\n15              [United States] v. Yunis, 867 F.2d 617, 622-\n16              25 (D.C. Cir. 1989).\n17\n18   Id.\n\n19              Through CIPA, Congress established procedures for\n\n20   handling classified information in criminal cases.    \"Classified\n\n21   information\" is defined to include \"information or material that\n\n22   has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to\n\n23   an Executive order, statute, or regulation, to require protection\n\n24   against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national\n\n25   security.\"    18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 1(a).   CIPA is \"meant to protect\n\n26   and restrict the discovery of classified information in a way\n\n\n           25\n            The ordered disclosures do not appear to be in the record\n     on appeal. According to Stewart, by letter dated October 13,\n     2006, the government informed her that certain telephone\n     conversations between a third party and Sattar were intercepted\n     pursuant to a court-authorized Title III warrant in 1994, that\n     these conversations, or the \"fruits\" of those conversations, were\n     not used as evidence in the present case, and that there was no\n     Brady material. Stewart Br. 211.\n                                    -77-\n\f1    that does not impair the defendant's right to a fair trial.\"\n\n2    United States v. Aref,   533 F.3d 72, 78 (2d Cir. 2008)\n\n3    (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted), cert.\n\n4    denied., 129 S. Ct. 1582 (2009).\n\n5              Section 4 of CIPA establishes procedures for discovery\n\n6    of classified information.   It provides:\n\n 7             The court, upon a sufficient showing, may\n 8             authorize the United States to delete\n 9             specified items of classified information\n10             from documents to be made available to the\n11             defendant through discovery under the Federal\n12             Rules of Criminal Procedure, to substitute a\n13             summary of the information for such\n14             classified documents, or to substitute a\n15             statement admitting relevant facts that the\n16             classified information would tend to prove.\n17             The court may permit the United States to\n18             make a request for such authorization in the\n19             form of a written statement to be inspected\n20             by the court alone. If the court enters an\n21             order granting relief following such an ex\n22             parte showing, the entire text of the\n23             statement of the United States shall be\n24             sealed and preserved in the records of the\n25             court to be made available to the appellate\n26             court in the event of an appeal.\n\n27    18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 4.\n\n28             This section \"clarifies district courts' power under\n\n29   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1) to issue protective\n\n30   orders denying or restricting discovery for good cause,\" which\n\n31   includes \"information vital to the national security.\"    Aref, 533\n\n32   F.3d at 78 (internal quotation marks omitted).   CIPA does not\n\n33   itself create a government privilege against the disclosure of\n\n34   classified information; it presupposes one.   Id.   The \"most\n\n35   likely source for the protection of classified information lies\n\n\n                                    -78-\n\f1    in the common-law privilege against disclosure of state secrets.\"\n\n2    Id.\n\n3               We have recently held that the state-secrets privilege\n\n4    applies to criminal cases, but that \"it must give way under some\n\n5    circumstances to a criminal defendant's right to present a\n\n6    meaningful defense.\"   Id. at 79.   To determine such\n\n7    circumstances, we have employed the standard first articulated in\n\n8    Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53 (1957), in the context of\n\n9    the so-called informer's privilege in criminal prosecutions, see\n\n10   Aref, 533 F.3d at 79-80.26\n\n11              First, the district court must determine whether the\n\n12   material in dispute is discoverable, and if so, whether the\n\n13   state-secrets privilege applies.    Id. at 80.   It applies if \"(1)\n\n14   there is 'a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence\n\n15   will expose . . . matters which, in the interest of national\n\n16   security, should not be divulged,' and (2) the privilege is\n\n17   'lodged by the head of the department which has control over the\n\n18   matter, after actual personal consideration by that officer.'\"\n\n19   Id. at 80 (quoting United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 8, 10\n\n20   (1953)).   If the information is discoverable but the privilege\n\n21   applies, then the district court must determine \"whether the\n\n\n           26\n            The privilege is \"in reality the Government's privilege\n     to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish\n     information of violations of law to officers charged with\n     enforcement of that law,\" and it \"recognizes the obligation of\n     citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of\n     crimes to law-enforcement officials and, by preserving their\n     anonymity, encourages them to perform that obligation.\" Roviaro,\n     353 U.S. at 59.\n                                    -79-\n\f1    information is helpful or material to the defense, i.e., useful\n\n2    'to counter the government's case or to bolster a defense.'\"      Id.\n\n3    (citation omitted).    In order to be helpful or material, the\n\n4    evidence \"need not rise to the level that would trigger the\n\n5    Government's obligation under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n6    (1963), to disclose exculpatory information.\"    Id.\n\n7                We review the district court's decision to issue a\n\n8    protective order under CIPA section 4 and Federal Rule of\n\n9    Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1) for abuse of discretion.    Aref, 522\n\n10   F.3d at 80.    Similarly, we review for abuse of discretion the\n\n11   district court's finding whether evidence is \"helpful\" or\n\n12   \"material to the defense.\"    Id.\n\n13               At the time of the district court's decision and order,\n\n14   our decision in Aref had not yet issued.    As noted in the\n\n15   district court's public order denying the motion to compel,\n\n16   however, the district court relied on an opinion by a sister\n\n17   circuit embracing a test similar to that embraced by the Aref\n\n18   panel.    Order, Oct. 17, 2006, at 2 (citing United States v.\n\n19   Yunis, 867 F.2d 617, 622-25 (D.C. Cir. 1989)).27\n\n          27\n            Under the D.C. Circuit's decision in Yunis, first, the\n     district court must determine, in camera and ex parte, whether\n     the information at issue is relevant. Yunis, 867 F.2d at 623.\n     If irrelevant, the inquiry ends. If relevant, however, the\n     district court must determine whether \"the assertion of privilege\n     by the government is at least a colorable one.\" Id. If the\n     claim is colorable, the court must then determine whether the\n     information is \"at least 'helpful to the defense.'\" Id. (quoting\n     Rovario, 353 U.S. at 60-61). \"Where the government asserts a\n     privilege, a trial court abuses its discretion if it orders\n     disclosure 'absent a showing of materiality.'\" Id. at 622. The\n     court in Yunis left open the question of whether otherwise\n                                                        (continued...)\n                                    -80-\n\f1                Here, the government has invoked the state-secrets\n\n2    privilege.    It asserts that the details of the NSA's operations,\n\n3    including the surveillance vel non of any particular individual\n\n4    or group, implicate national security and are among \"the nation's\n\n5    most guarded secrets.\"    Gov't Br. 389-90; id. (quoting Halkins v.\n\n6    Helms, 598 F.2d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).    Where evidence is\n\n7    intercepted, the sensitive nature of the information might lie\n\n8    \"not so much in the contents of the [information], as in the\n\n9    time, place, and nature of the government's ability to intercept\n\n10   the [information] at all.\"    Yunis, 867 F.2d at 623.28\n\n11               In light of these general concerns and the principles\n\n12   set forth in Yunis and Aref, and based upon our own review of the\n\n13   underlying materials and the district court's sealed order, we\n\n14   are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its\n\n15   discretion or otherwise err in denying Stewart's motion to compel\n\n16   disclosure.\n\n17               We note, as we did in Aref, which postdated the\n\n18   district court's order here, the absence of a formal public\n\n19   \"claim of privilege[] lodged by the head of the department which\n\n20   has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration\n\n21   by that officer.\"    Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7-8; see Aref, 533 F.3d\n\n22   at 80.    As in Aref, we conclude that in the pre-Aref context,\n\n          27\n           (...continued)\n     privileged information is protected from disclosure where such\n     information has \"more than theoretical relevance\" and is\n     \"genuinely helpful to [the] defense.\" Id. at 625.\n          28\n            We make neither reference to nor conclusions regarding\n     the material at issue in the instant case.\n                                    -81-\n\f1    such a flaw \"is not necessarily fatal,\" and that \"[i]t would 'be\n\n2    of little or no benefit' for us to remand for the purpose of\n\n3    having the department head agree that disclosure of the\n\n4    classified information would pose a risk to national security\n\n5    here.\"   Aref, 533 F.3d at 80.   But the absence of the formal\n\n6    claim is not a trivial matter.    We do not demean it.    We expect\n\n7    that, in light of the holding in Aref, we will not need to\n\n8    address this issue in appeals from future prosecutions in which\n\n9    the state-secrets privilege is invoked as the government is now\n\n10   well-informed of this obligation.       Cf. id. (\"Based on our holding\n\n11   today . . . we trust that this issue will not arise in future\n\n12   CIPA cases.\").\n\n13              We reject Stewart's claim that the district court erred\n\n14   in reviewing materials ex parte and in camera.      As we noted in\n\n15   Aref, \"[b]oth CIPA section 4 and Rule 16(d)(1) authorize ex parte\n\n16   submissions. . . .   When the 'government is seeking to withhold\n\n17   classified information from the defendant, an adversary hearing\n\n18   with defense knowledge would defeat the very purpose of the\n\n19   discovery rules.'\"   Aref, 533 F.3d at 81.\n\n20              The CIPA procedures followed by the district court\n\n21   place all parties involved (except perhaps the government) at a\n\n22   substantial disadvantage: defendants are hampered in contesting\n\n23   the assertions that are being made to the court by the\n\n24   government; district courts and courts of appeals are deprived of\n\n25   the opportunity for an adversarial proceeding upon which they are\n\n26   typically dependent in attempting fairly and properly to resolve\n\n                                      -82-\n\f1    disputes; and the public, as well as the litigants, are deprived\n\n2    of the assurances that come with public scrutiny of the work of\n\n3    the courts.    The procedures are also, of course, subject to abuse\n\n4    by the executive.   But a method for protection of classified\n\n5    material is necessary, and these procedures have been established\n\n6    by Congress and held to be constitutional.    We, as did the\n\n7    district court, therefore accept them as a necessary, if\n\n8    imperfect, accommodation of the varied interests implicated.\n\n9              2.   Alleged Trial Errors.   Both Sattar and Yousry\n\n10   challenge various evidentiary rulings made by the district court.\n\n11   Sattar argues that the court abused its discretion by admitting a\n\n12   book by Taha and a videotape of Taha, Osama Bin Laden, and other\n\n13   al-Gama'a members encouraging violence, and by excluding news\n\n14   footage purporting to depict Israeli violence against Palestinian\n\n15   demonstrators.   In addition, Yousry challenges the exclusion of\n\n16   several statements he made to FBI agents.\n\n17             We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for\n\n18   abuse of discretion.   See United States v. Kelley, 551 F.3d 171,\n\n19   174 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam); United States v. Anglin, 169\n\n20   F.3d 154, 162 (2d Cir. 1999).   Here, the district court did not\n\n21   abuse its discretion with respect to any such rulings.\n\n22             We are guided by certain basic principles established\n\n23   by the Federal Rules of Evidence -- that, as a general rule,\n\n24   \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible,\" Fed. R. Evid. 402, but\n\n25   that even relevant evidence, although admissible, may be excluded\n\n26   by the district court \"if its probative value is substantially\n\n                                     -83-\n\f1    outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\n\n2    issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\n\n3    delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative\n\n4    evidence,\" Fed. R. Evid. 403.   \"A district court is obviously in\n\n5    the best position to do the balancing mandated by Rule 403.\"\n\n6    Salameh, 152 F.3d at 110.   \"We will second-guess a district court\n\n7    only if there is a clear showing that the court abused its\n\n8    discretion or acted arbitrarily or irrationally.\"    Id. (internal\n\n9    quotation marks omitted); accord United States v. Szur, 289 F.3d\n\n10   200, 217 (2d Cir. 2002).\n\n11             Taha's book was relevant and admissible as evidence of\n\n12   the existence of the Count-Two conspiracy to murder persons in a\n\n13   foreign country.   The Bin Laden video was similarly admissible,\n\n14   and relevant to Taha's intent to murder or kidnap.   The district\n\n15   court did not err in failing to find that the evidence was unduly\n\n16   prejudicial.\n\n17             It was also within the district court's discretion to\n\n18   exclude both the news video, which it found to be of minimal\n\n19   relevance yet highly prejudicial and confusing, and Yousry's\n\n20   statements to the FBI, which it found to be essentially\n\n21   duplicative of Yousry's own testimony.\n\n22             The district court made a \"conscientious assessment of\n\n23   whether unfair prejudice substantially outweigh[ed] probative\n\n24   value,\" Salameh, 152 F.3d at 110 (internal quotation marks\n\n25   omitted), and did not otherwise abuse its discretion in making\n\n\n\n                                     -84-\n\f1    this assessment.    We therefore will not disturb its judgments on\n\n2    these grounds.\n\n3                3. Allegations of Juror Misconduct.   It was brought to\n\n4    the district court's attention after the jury rendered its\n\n5    verdict that a juror, referred to by the parties as \"Juror # 39,\"\n\n6    had come forward with allegations concerning improprieties during\n\n7    the jury's deliberations.    The defendants requested that the\n\n8    district court \"'follow up' and conduct an inquiry\" into these\n\n9    allegations.    Sattar IV, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 74-78.   By written\n\n10   opinion, the district court denied the request.    Id.   Sattar\n\n11   argues on appeal that the district court's actions were an abuse\n\n12   of its discretion, insisting that the court should have met,\n\n13   post-verdict, with Juror Number 39 to conduct an inquiry.     We\n\n14   disagree.\n\n15               The district court properly construed the request as\n\n16   one for an evidentiary hearing, and concluded that there was no\n\n17   \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . .\n\n18   that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred,\"\n\n19   United States v. Ianiello, 866 F.2d 540, 543 (2d Cir. 1989),\n\n20   especially in light of the fact that the juror had \"several\n\n21   opportunities to communicate directly with the court\" regarding\n\n22   any potential improprieties, but failed to do so, Jacobson v.\n\n23   Henderson, 765 F.2d 12, 15 (2d Cir. 1985).    As the district court\n\n24   explained, \"the fact that Juror # 39 had direct access to the\n\n25   Court and did not complain of any problems supports the\n\n26   conclusion that these allegations are post hoc efforts caused by\n\n                                     -85-\n\f1    dissatisfaction that do not require further post-verdict\n\n2    inquiry.\"    Sattar IV, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 77.   We agree.\n\n3                4.   Cumulative Error Doctrine.   Yousry also argues on\n\n4    appeal that we should reverse under the cumulative error\n\n5    doctrine.    But the defendants have not identified any error in\n\n6    the district court's rulings, \"and the accumulation of non-errors\n\n7    does not warrant a new trial.\"    United States v. Lumpkin, 192\n\n8    F.3d 280, 290 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n9                VII. Propriety of the Sentences\n\n10               The government appeals from the sentences imposed on\n\n11   the defendants, asserting that they are unreasonable and unduly\n\n12   lenient.    The government's principal brief was submitted prior to\n\n13   the Supreme Court's decisions in Gall v. United States, 128 S.\n\n14   Ct. 586 (2007), and Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558\n\n15   (2007), which, as recognized by this Circuit in its en banc\n\n16   decision in United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180 (2d Cir. 2008),\n\n17   have significantly altered the landscape of sentencing\n\n18   jurisprudence.    The Supreme Court issued both Gall and Kimbrough\n\n19   before the government filed its reply brief and oral argument\n\n20   took place, but not before this Circuit had spoken in Cavera.29\n\n\n          29\n            As noted in this case's caption, this appeal was argued\n     on January 29, 2008. On December 12, 2007, approximately one\n     month prior thereto, a majority of the active judges of this\n     Court voted to vacate the initial three-judge panel's decision in\n     Cavera, see 505 F.3d 216 (2d Cir. 2007), and to rehear the case\n     en banc. As Cavera preceded this case and would address many\n     issues critical to the resolution of this appeal, and as noted in\n     footnote [*], we deemed it prudent to stay our resolution of this\n     case pending this Court's en banc resolution of Cavera, despite\n                                                        (continued...)\n                                    -86-\n\f1    A. Standard of Review\n\n2                The principles that guide our review of the district\n\n3    court's sentences are, \"at first glance, beguilingly simple.\"\n\n4    Cavera, 550 F.3d at 188.     Generally, we review for abuse of\n\n5    discretion.    Id. at 189.   That \"deferential\" scrutiny\n\n6    \"encompasses two components: procedural review and substantive\n\n7    review.\"    Id.\n\n8                1. Procedural Review.   We first determine whether the\n\n9    sentence was procedurally reasonable.     See id.   Ordinarily, the\n\n10   district court must first correctly calculate the appropriate\n\n11   range set forth by the United States Sentencing Guidelines.      Id.\n\n12   at 190.    Then it \"must form its own view of the nature and\n\n13   circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics\n\n14   of the defendant,\" id. at 188, as mandated and guided by 18\n\n15   U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).30    In this context, \"we review factual\n\n          29\n           (...continued)\n     the unfortunate delay involved.     The en banc opinion issued on\n     December 4, 2008.\n          30\n               Section 3553(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n                 The court shall impose a sentence sufficient,\n                 but not greater than necessary, to comply\n                 with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2)\n                 of this subsection. The court, in determining\n                 the particular sentence to be imposed, shall\n                 consider--\n\n                      (1) the nature and circumstances of the\n                 offense and the history and characteristics\n                 of the defendant;\n\n                       (2) the need for the sentence imposed--\n\n                            (A) to reflect the seriousness of\n                                                           (continued...)\n                                       -87-\n\f1   findings for clear error and the court's interpretation of the\n\n2   Sentencing Guidelines de novo.\"     United States v. Jeffers, 329\n\n3   F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir. 2003); see also Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597\n\n4   (stating that a court procedurally errs when it \"select[s] a\n\n5   sentence based on clearly erroneous facts\").

United States, 551 U.S. 338, 356\n\n12   (2007)) (brackets in Cavera).   When a court commits \"significant\n\n13   procedural error,\" we may \"remand to the district court so that\n\n14   it can either explain what it was trying to do, or correct its\n\n15   mistake and exercise its discretion anew . . . rather than\n\n16   . . . proceed[ing] to review the sentence for substantive\n\n17   reasonableness.\"   Id. at 190 (citations and internal quotation\n\n18   marks omitted).\n\n19             2. Substantive Review.    Once we are satisfied that a\n\n20   sentence was procedurally proper, we then review the district\n\n21   court's determination for substantive reasonableness, \"tak[ing]\n\n22   into account the totality of the circumstances, giving due\n\n23   deference to the sentencing judge's exercise of discretion, and\n\n24   bearing in mind the institutional advantages of district courts.\"\n\n25   Id. at 190.   Our role is no more than to \"patrol the boundaries\n\n26   of reasonableness.\"   Id. at 191.   Indeed, we \"must defer heavily\n\n                                     -89-\n\f1    to the expertise of district judges,\" id. at 193, and will \"set\n\n2    aside a district court's substantive determination only in\n\n3    exceptional cases where the trial court's decision cannot be\n\n4    located within the range of permissible decisions,\" id. at 189\n\n5    (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).\n\n6              We do not \"presume that a non-Guidelines sentence is\n\n7    unreasonable,\" nor do we \"require 'extraordinary' circumstances\n\n8    to justify a deviation from the Guidelines range.\"     Id. at 190\n\n9    (quoting Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 595).     In evaluating a sentence's\n\n10   substantive reasonableness, \"we may take the degree of variance\n\n11   into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the\n\n12   Guidelines.'\"   Id.   We may \"consider whether the factor, as\n\n13   explained by the district court, can bear the weight assigned it\n\n14   under the totality of circumstances in the case.\"    Id. at 191.\n\n15   \"[A] major departure should be supported by a more significant\n\n16   justification than a minor one.\"    Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597.    \"But\n\n17   we must not employ a rigid mathematical formula that uses the\n\n18   percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the\n\n19   strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\"\n\n20   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n21             Some decisions by the district court may be entitled to\n\n22   more deference than others.    For example, as both the Supreme\n\n23   Court and we have noted, variations from the Guidelines \"may\n\n24   attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a\n\n25   particular case outside the heartland to which the Commission\n\n26   intends individual Guidelines to apply.\"     Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct at\n\n                                     -90-\n\f1    574-75 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Cavera, 550\n\n2    F.3d at 192.    When, on the other hand, the variation is based\n\n3    upon a general disagreement with the Guidelines' applicability in\n\n4    a \"mine-run case,\" then \"closer review may be in order.\"\n\n5    Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct at 575.\n\n6                But such \"closer review\" is less appropriate where the\n\n7    Guideline in question is not based on empirical data and national\n\n8    history.    The issuance of that sort of Guideline \"do[es] not\n\n9    exemplify the Commission's exercise of its characteristic\n\n10   institutional role.\"    Id.   \"[A] categorical disagreement with and\n\n11   variance from [such a] Guideline[],\" or, at least from the crack\n\n12   cocaine Guidelines, \"is not suspect.\"    Spears v. United States,\n\n13   129 S. Ct. 840, 843 (2009) (per curiam).\n\n14               The Supreme Court has yet to address fully the contours\n\n15   of the \"respect\" that should be afforded to \"an 'inside the\n\n16   heartland' departure,\" id., from Guidelines created by the\n\n17   Commission pursuant to its characteristic institutional role.\n\n18   Such a departure would \"necessarily [be] based on a policy\n\n19   disagreement with the Guidelines\" and would \"necessarily\n\n20   disagree[] [with the Guidelines] on a 'categorical basis.'\"      Id.\n\n21   We have recognized, however, that \"some Guidelines enhancements\n\n22   and reductions apply without modulation to a wide range of\n\n23   conduct.\"    Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192.   Thus, \"a district court may\n\n24   find that even after giving weight to the [factors that drive the\n\n25   enhancement or reduction] there is [still] a wide variety of\n\n26   culpability amongst defendants and, as a result, impose different\n\n                                      -91-\n\f1    sentences based on the factors identified in § 3553(a).\"    Id.   Of\n\n2    course, irrespective of whether the conduct is found to be inside\n\n3    or outside the \"heartland,\" the \"district court must explain its\n\n4    reasons for its chosen sentence.\"   Id.31\n\n5              Affording greater discretion to the district courts may\n\n6    result in greater apparent disparities in sentences.   But \"the\n\n7    Supreme Court has made clear its view that disparities in\n\n8    sentences imposed by different district judges are more likely to\n\n9    reflect justified differences than are those arising from\n\n10   differences of opinion among appellate panels.\"   Cavera, 550 F.3d\n\n11   at 193.\n\n12   B. Application to This Case\n\n13             The government's principal claim of error on appeal is\n\n14   that the district court abused its discretion by imposing\n\n15   unreasonably lenient sentences.   The government also argues that\n\n16   the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to apply\n\n17   the Guidelines terrorism adjustment, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4, to\n\n18   Yousry's offense level.\n\n19             1. Yousry's Sentence.   The district court initially\n\n20   calculated Yousry's Guidelines range based on a total offense\n\n21   level of 28 and a criminal history category of I, for a range of\n\n22   78 to 97 months.   According to the government, Yousry's\n\n          31\n             As is discussed in more detail below, the district court\n     found that the terrorism enhancement did not apply to Yousry's\n     conduct, and that his conduct fell outside the heartland of\n     material support for terrorist activity crimes. The district\n     court found Sattar's and Stewart's conduct to merit the terrorism\n     enhancement, but, at least for Stewart, found the case to be an\n     unusual one for the enhancement.\n                                    -92-\n\f1    applicable Guidelines range should have been enhanced in\n\n2    accordance with the terrorism enhancement provide by the\n\n3    Guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4.    The district court concluded to\n\n4    the contrary that the terrorism enhancement did not apply to\n\n5    Yousry because he did not act with the requisite state of mind.\n\n6    Based on the district court's findings, we agree with its\n\n7    conclusion.\n\n8               Upon consideration of the various factors set forth in\n\n9    section 3553(a), the district court concluded that a significant\n\n10   downward variance32 was appropriate, and ultimately sentenced\n\n11   Yousry to a non-Guidelines sentence of 20 months of imprisonment,\n\n12   followed by 2 years of supervised release.\n\n13              a. Guidelines Calculations\n\n14              We review the district court's interpretation of the\n\n15   Guidelines de novo, and the district court's findings of fact for\n\n16   clear error.    United States v. Legros, 529 F.3d 470, 474 (2d Cir.\n\n17   2008).    We interpret the Guidelines as though they were a\n\n18   statute, giving the words used their common meaning.    United\n\n\n\n\n          32\n             We distinguish between \"a 'variance' from the advisory\n     Guidelines\" and \"a 'departure' within the Guidelines.\" Irizarry\n     v. United States, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2204 (2008) (Breyer, J.,\n     dissenting) (emphasis in original). As the Supreme Court noted\n     in Irizarry, \"'[d]eparture' is a term of art under the Guidelines\n     and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed under the\n     framework set out in the Guidelines.\" Id. at 2202. In contrast,\n     a variance is a modification of the applicable Guidelines\n     sentence \"that a District Court may find justified under the\n     sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. [§ 3553(a)].\" Id. at\n     2203.\n                                    -93-\n\f1    States v. Kirvan, 86 F.3d 309, 311 (2d Cir. 1996).    Section\n\n2    3A1.4, the so-called \"terrorism enhancement,\" provides:\n\n3                   (a) If the offense is a felony that\n4              involved, or was intended to promote, a\n5              federal crime of terrorism, increase by 12\n6              levels; but if the resulting offense level is\n7              less than level 32, increase to level 32.\n\n 8                  (b) In each such case, the defendant's\n 9             criminal history . . . shall be Category VI.\n10\n11   U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4.   The application notes incorporate 18 U.S.C.\n\n12   § 2332b(g)(5) by reference.   See id. cmt. n.1.   That section\n\n13   defines a \"Federal crime of terrorism\" as:\n14\n15                  an offense that--\n16                  (A) is calculated to influence or affect\n17             the conduct of government by intimidation or\n18             coercion, or to retaliate against government\n19             conduct; and\n20                  (B) is a violation of [any one of many\n21             statutes, including 18 U.S.C. § 2339A,\n22             relating to the provision of material support\n23             to terrorists, and 18 U.S.C. § 956(a)(1),\n24             relating to conspiracies to murder persons\n25             abroad].\n\n26   18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5).   The conventional meaning of\n\n27   \"calculated\" is \"devised with forethought.\"   II Oxford English\n\n28   Dictionary 777 (2d ed. 1999).   Therefore, if a defendant's\n\n29   purpose in committing an offense is to \"influence or affect the\n\n30   conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to\n\n31   retaliate against government conduct,\" the first requirement of\n\n32   section 2332b(g)(5)(A) is satisfied.   If, however, there is no\n\n33   evidence that the defendant \"sought to influence or affect the\n\n34   conduct of the government,\" the crime is not a federal crime of\n\n\n\n                                     -94-\n\f1    terrorism.    See United States v. Leahy, 169 F.3d 433, 446 (7th\n\n2    Cir. 1999).\n\n3               The enhancement is not limited, however, to offenses\n\n4    that are themselves federal crimes of terrorism.    By including\n\n5    the \"intended to promote\" language, the drafters of the Guideline\n\n6    \"unambiguously cast a broader net.\"    United States v. Mandhai,\n\n7    375 F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 923\n\n8    (2006).   The criminal conduct at issue need not itself meet the\n\n9    statutory definition of a federal crime of terrorism if \"a goal\n\n10   or purpose [of the defendant's act] was to bring or help bring\n\n11   into being a crime listed in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B).\"     Id. at\n\n12   1248; accord United States v. Arnaout, 431 F.3d 994, 1001-02 (7th\n\n13   Cir. 2005).\n\n14              The district court declined to apply the terrorism\n\n15   enhancement to Yousry's sentence.    The court explained:\n\n16              This is a motivational requirement and\n17              focuses on the defendant's purpose. The\n18              government has conceded the lack of\n19              motivation or purpose and has failed to show\n20              that the defendant's offenses were calculated\n21              to influence or affect the conduct of\n22              government by intimidation or coercion or to\n23              retaliate against government action.\n\n24   Sent'g Tr. 143-44; see 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(A) (defining\n\n25   \"federal crime of terrorism\").    The government does not challenge\n\n26   this finding, which we conclude to be consistent with the record\n\n27   and not clearly erroneous.\n\n28              Nonetheless, the government argues that the enhancement\n\n29   is appropriate despite the fact that Yousry has committed neither\n\n30   a federal crime of terrorism nor any other crime with the intent\n                                    -95-\n\f1    to promote such a crime.   According to the government, the\n\n2    enhancement applies because Yousry's offense was \"a felony that\n\n3    involved . . . a federal crime of terrorism.\"     U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4\n\n4    (emphasis added).   But under the \"involved\" prong of section\n\n5    3A1.4, the enhancement would be applicable to Yousry only if he\n\n6    himself had committed a federal crime of terrorism.    See Arnaout,\n\n7    431 F.3d at 1001 (\"The ordinary and plain meaning of 'involved'\n\n8    means 'to include.'\"); United States v. Graham, 275 F.3d 490, 516\n\n9    (6th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1026 (2002) (\"[W]e\n\n10   believe that in the context at hand, the word 'involved'\n\n11   signifies that a defendant's offense included a federal crime of\n\n12   terrorism; in other words, that a defendant committed, attempted,\n\n13   or conspired to commit a federal crime of terrorism as defined in\n\n14   18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5).\").   And, as the Fourth Circuit has\n\n15   recognized, commission of a federal crime of terrorism, which\n\n16   would trigger the \"involved\" prong of the enhancement,\n\n17   incorporates \"a specific intent requirement, namely, that the\n\n18   underlying felony was 'calculated to influence or affect the\n\n19   conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to\n\n20   retaliate against government conduct.'   18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5).\"\n\n21   United States v. Chandia, 514 F.3d 365, 376 (4th Cir. 2008).    So\n\n22   the problem for the government remains: there is no evidence that\n\n23   Yousry himself sought to influence or affect the conduct of a\n\n24   government.   The enhancement therefore does not apply under the\n\n25   \"involved\" prong.   See Leahy, 169 F.3d at 446.\n\n\n\n                                    -96-\n\f1              The government maintains that any motivational\n\n2    requirement imposed by the terrorism enhancement can be imputed\n\n3    to Yousry from his co-conspirators' relevant conduct under\n\n4    section 1B1.3(a) of the Guidelines.   It provides, in relevant\n\n5    part:\n\n6              [A]djustments in Chapter Three [including the\n7              Terrorism Enhancement] shall be determined on\n8              the basis of the following:\n 9                  (1)(A) all acts and omissions committed,\n10             aided, abetted, counseled, commanded,\n11             induced, procured, or willfully caused by the\n12             defendant; and\n13                  (B) in the case of a jointly undertaken\n14             criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme,\n15             endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the\n16             defendant in concert with others, whether or\n17             not charged as a conspiracy), all reasonably\n18             foreseeable acts and omissions of others in\n19             furtherance of the jointly undertaken\n20             criminal activity, that occurred during the\n21             commission of the offense of conviction, in\n22             preparation for that offense, or in the\n23             course of attempting to avoid detection or\n24             responsibility for that offense . . . .\n\n25   U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a).   The government asserts that it was\n\n26   reasonably foreseeable to Yousry that his co-conspirators were\n\n27   acting in a manner \"calculated to influence or affect the conduct\n\n28   of government,\" so that the requirement of section 2332b(g)(5)(A)\n\n29   is satisfied as to him.\n\n30             But sections 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) and (B) apply to \"acts and\n\n31   omissions,\" while, as noted above, section 2332b(g)(5)(A)\n\n32   describes a motivational requirement, a \"specific intent.\"\n\n33   Chandia, 514 F.3d at 376.   We cannot conflate Yousry's acts with\n\n34   his co-defendants' mental states.   As one member of this Court\n\n35   has pointed out, \"We have never regarded mens rea as an 'act' of\n                                    -97-\n\f1    the defendant for purposes of the relevant conduct guideline, nor\n\n2    should we.\"   United States v. McHugh, 122 F.3d 153, 158 (2d Cir.\n\n3    1997) (Newman, J., concurring).      \"Section 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) permits\n\n4    selection of an enhanced guideline for 'acts' committed by the\n\n5    defendant. . . .   The natural meaning of 'act' connotes conduct,\n\n6    and the meaning of the guideline should not be strained to\n\n7    include state of mind.\"    Id.    Here, too, the terrorism\n\n8    enhancement's motivational requirement, as incorporated by\n\n9    reference to section 2332b(g)(5)(A), is not an \"act\" or\n\n10   \"omission\" under section 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).      The enhancement is\n\n11   therefore not applicable.\n\n12             We have examined the other arguments made by the\n\n13   government in support of its expansive reading of the \"involved\"\n\n14   prong of the terrorism enhancement and we find them to be\n\n15   similarly without merit.\n\n16             b. Section 3553(a) Factors\n\n17             We conclude, then, that the district court properly\n\n18   calculated Yousry's Guidelines range to be 78 to 97 months.        We\n\n19   must therefore determine in light of that range and the totality\n\n20   of the circumstances whether Yousry's sentence of 20 months of\n\n21   imprisonment, imposed following the district court's section\n\n22   3553(a) inquiry, was substantively unreasonable.\n\n23             We need not outline again the nature of the crimes of\n\n24   which Yousry was convicted.      We focus instead on the reasons\n\n25   given by the district court in support of its downward variance.\n\n\n\n                                       -98-\n\f1              First, the court found that Yousry's conduct was\n\n2    \"unusual and f[e]ll outside the heartland of material support for\n\n3    terrorist activity.\"    Sent'g Tr. 150.   \"[A] district court's\n\n4    decision to vary from the Guidelines 'may attract greatest\n\n5    respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case outside\n\n6    the \"heartland\" to which the Commission intends individual\n\n7    Guidelines to apply.'\"    Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192 (quoting\n\n8    Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 574-75).    We perceive no basis for\n\n9    concluding that the district court erred in deciding that to be\n\n10   the case with respect to Yousry, particularly because he was\n\n11   acting as a translator, not a lawyer or other professional.\n\n12             Second, the district court found that \"no actual harm\n\n13   to victims occurred\" although the court was \"well aware that such\n\n14   harm is not required and that if such harm occurred the guideline\n\n15   range would be higher.\"    Sent'g Tr. 150.   We conclude that it was\n\n16   not unreasonable for the district judge to decide that the fact\n\n17   that no injury occurred in the case mitigated the gravity of\n\n18   Yousry's offense.33    The criminal law often punishes the\n\n\n          33\n             As a procedural matter, we conclude that a district\n     court may rely on the fact that no harm resulted from the\n     criminal act at issue. The weight that such a factor can bear in\n     any particular instance, however, is an analytically separate,\n     and substantive, question. As is made clear by the discussion\n     below, we conclude that the district court did not procedurally\n     err by considering the absence of harm as one factor relevant to\n     the proper sentence of each defendant. We also conclude that\n     both Sattar's and Yousry's sentences are substantively reasonable\n     -- i.e., that the factors identified by the district court can\n     bear the weight assigned to them. Because we vacate Stewart's\n     sentence as procedurally unreasonable, however, we do not address\n     whether the factors identified by the district court, including\n     the apparent lack of substantial harm caused by her criminality,\n                                                        (continued...)\n                                    -99-\n\f1    substantive commission of a crime more severely than an attempt\n\n2    to commit the same crime, even when that which separates an\n\n3    attempt from the substantive commission of an offense is not\n\n4    culpability but fortuity.   Fortuitous events are not\n\n5    categorically irrelevant to the determination of a just\n\n6    punishment nor is their consideration necessarily inappropriate.\n\n7    As the Supreme Court has recently noted, although \"[i]t is\n\n8    unusual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of\n\n9    purely accidental conduct[,] it is not unusual to punish\n\n10   individuals for the unintended consequences of their unlawful\n\n11   acts.\"    See, e.g., Dean v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 1849, 1857-\n\n12   58 (2009); id. at 1852 (concluding that a defendant who carried a\n\n13   firearm during and in relation to a bank robbery in violation of\n\n14   18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) is subject to a 10 year mandatory\n\n15   minimum pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) because his\n\n16   \"firearm [was] discharged\" in the course of the robbery, even\n\n17   though \"the gun [went] off accidentally,\" was not pointed at\n\n18   anyone when it discharged, and nobody was hurt).\n\n19              Third, the court noted that although Yousry's offenses\n\n20   were \"plainly serious,\" his \"role in the offenses was subservient\n\n21   to the others involved\" in the conspiracy.   Sent'g Tr. 150.   The\n\n22   Guidelines were \"intended to eliminate national disparity,\" but\n\n23   \"[w]e do not, as a general matter, object to district courts'\n\n\n          33\n           (...continued)\n     can bear the weight assigned them. We note, however, our general\n     view that a district court should be cautious in determining the\n     significance of the fact that no harm may have occurred where a\n     defendant intended such harm.\n                                   -100-\n\f1    consideration of similarities and differences among co-defendants\n\n2    when imposing a sentence.\"    United States v. Wills, 476 F.3d 103,\n\n3    109, 110 (2d Cir. 2007) (emphasis omitted), abrogated on other\n\n4    grounds by Kimbrough, 128 S.Ct. at 574-75, as recognized in\n\n5    Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191; accord United States v. Williams, 524\n\n6    F.3d 209, 216 (2d Cir. 2008).    We also defer to the district\n\n7    court's conclusion that Yousry's conduct was less culpable than\n\n8    that of his co-conspirators.    On this basis, we conclude that the\n\n9    district court did not err by giving weight to this factor.\n\n10               Fourth, the district court found that Yousry \"did not\n\n11   engage in the offenses for profit and . . . did not support or\n\n12   believe in the use of violence to achieve what he wanted.\"\n\n13   Sent'g Tr. 150.    These facts mitigate the gravity of the conduct\n\n14   at issue.    They also affect consideration of the \"history and\n\n15   characteristics of the defendant\" and the need to \"protect the\n\n16   public from further crimes of the defendant\" and to \"afford\n\n17   adequate deterrence.\"    18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).   The court concluded\n\n18   that a substantial downward variance was thus justified on the\n\n19   grounds that a lesser degree of punishment than otherwise called\n\n20   for would be sufficient for purposes of deterrence and the\n\n21   protection of the public.    As the Gall Court noted, a district\n\n22   court is well-situated to make determinations about the\n\n23   \"character of the defendant\" and whether, given such a character,\n\n24   the defendant is more or less likely \"to return to criminal\n\n25   behavior\" or constitute \"a danger to society.\"    Gall, 128 S. Ct.\n\n26   at 600-01.\n\n                                     -101-\n\f1              The district court did not err in finding that Yousry\n\n2    was not motivated by potential profit and did not believe in the\n\n3    use of violence.    Nor did it err in considering these factors\n\n4    while fashioning a non-Guidelines sentence for him.      In\n\n5    evaluating culpability, we cannot discount the relevance of the\n\n6    defendant's motivations -- i.e., whether mercenary, see, e.g., 18\n\n7    U.S.C. § 1958 (murder for hire), or born from a commitment to the\n\n8    use of violence.    The district court acted well within its\n\n9    discretion in deciding that Yousry was both less dangerous and\n\n10   more easily deterred than had he been acting on a for-hire basis\n\n11   or committed to the use of violence for political ends.\n\n12             Fifth, the district court found that Yousry's\n\n13   conviction made it \"doubtful that the defendant could pursue\" his\n\n14   career as an academic or translator, and therefore that the need\n\n15   for further deterrence and protection of the public is lessened\n\n16   because the conviction itself \"already visits substantial\n\n17   punishment on the defendant.\"    Sent'g Tr. 151.    The district\n\n18   court is specifically required by section 3553(a) to consider the\n\n19   \"just punishment for the offense.\"      18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).\n\n20   It is difficult to see how a court can properly calibrate a \"just\n\n21   punishment\" if it does not consider the collateral effects of a\n\n22   particular sentence.    Upon careful review of the record and the\n\n23   reasons given by the court, we are convinced that the court did\n\n24   so appropriately.\n\n25             Sixth, the district court found that Yousry provided\n\n26   \"extensive . . . cooperation\" to the government following the\n\n                                     -102-\n\f1    terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.     Sent'g Tr. 151.   The\n\n2    court concluded that this cooperation \"demonstrates a willingness\n\n3    to help law enforcement and reduces the need for rehabilitation\n\n4    and deterrence.\"    Id.   We defer to the district court's\n\n5    evaluation of the extent of Yousry's cooperation.      And of course,\n\n6    use of a defendant's cooperation to justify significant variances\n\n7    or departures from the otherwise applicable Guidelines\n\n8    calculations is commonplace.     The government argues that Yousry's\n\n9    assistance was not as extensive as the district court found it to\n\n10   be, but we have been given no cause to question the court's\n\n11   relevant findings of fact or the manner in which it accounted for\n\n12   them in sentencing.\n\n13             Seventh, the court found that Yousry \"will not be in a\n\n14   situation to commit the offenses of conviction again,\" because\n\n15   \"it is unlikely that he will ever be able to serve as an\n\n16   interpreter in an official capacity.\"     Id.   We defer to this\n\n17   finding, too.   It is not error for a district court to evaluate,\n\n18   based on the defendant's individual circumstances, the extent of\n\n19   punishment \"necessary to deter [him] from engaging in future\n\n20   criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future\n\n21   criminal acts.\"    Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 602; see 18 U.S.C.\n\n22   § 3553(a)(2)(B) & (C).\n\n23             The district court did not, of course, assign precise\n\n24   weights to particular factors.     Doing so would presuppose \"the\n\n25   existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages\n\n26   to various justifications,\" and would constitute a species of\n\n                                      -103-\n\f1    \"mathematical approach\" which has been expressly disavowed by the\n\n2    Supreme Court as \"a classic example of attempting to measure an\n\n3    inventory of apples by counting oranges.\"     Gall, 128 S. Ct. at\n\n4    596.\n\n5              In evaluating the ultimate substantive reasonableness\n\n6    of Yousry's sentence, we must determine, under the totality of\n\n7    the circumstances, whether these various factors can \"bear the\n\n8    weight\" assigned to them by the district court.     We are satisfied\n\n9    that they can.    We are equally satisfied that the district court\n\n10   \"consider[ed] the extent of the deviation and ensure[d] that the\n\n11   justification [was] sufficiently compelling to support the degree\n\n12   of variance.\"    Id. at 597.\n\n13             In conducting our review, we are further satisfied that\n\n14   the district court did not ignore the Guidelines or \"treat them\n\n15   merely as a body of casual advice.\"     Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189\n\n16   (internal quotation marks omitted).     Even were we inclined to\n\n17   think that the district court did not appreciate the weight of\n\n18   the Guidelines -- which, as we say, we are not -- in light of all\n\n19   of the foregoing, including the court's long-term and intimate\n\n20   involvement with these proceedings, any such conclusion would be\n\n21   purely a matter of surmise on our part.     See Rita, 551 U.S. at\n\n22   357-58 (noting that the sentencing judge had \"greater familiarity\n\n23   with[] the individual case and the individual defendant before\n\n24   him than the Commission or the appeals court\"); see also Gall,\n\n25   128 S. Ct. at 597.    The district court did not abuse its\n\n26   discretion in sentencing Yousry.\n\n                                     -104-\n\f1    B. Sattar's Sentence\n\n2               The district court calculated Sattar's total offense\n\n3    level to be 43 and his criminal history category to be 6, for a\n\n4    Guidelines \"range\" of life imprisonment.     But in conducting its\n\n5    own independent review, as guided by section 3553(a), the\n\n6    district court concluded that such a sentence would be \"seriously\n\n7    disproportionate\" to the offense.    Sent'g Tr. 35.   The court\n\n8    imposed a sentence of 24 years (288 months) of imprisonment, to\n\n9    be followed by five years of supervised release.\n\n10              1. Guidelines Calculation.    The district court\n\n11   calculated Sattar's sentence, as it did Yousry's, under the\n\n12   November 2000 Guidelines.    The court ultimately adopted the\n\n13   recommendations of the Probation Department in making its\n\n14   Guidelines calculation, except insofar as the district court\n\n15   added enhancements based on Sattar's obstruction of justice.\n\n16              a. Enhancements\n\n17              Sattar's Guidelines \"range\" of life imprisonment was\n\n18   arrived at based in part on the sentencing court's determination\n\n19   that the terrorism enhancement applied to both Sattar's Count-Two\n\n20   and Count-One conduct.     The district court also enhanced Sattar's\n\n21   sentence on the ground that he obstructed justice.     See U.S.S.G.\n\n22   § 3C1.1.\n\n23              b. Departures\n\n24              Sattar moved for a downward departure based on the\n\n25   conditions of his confinement.    The district court recognized\n\n26   that it was able to depart under the Guidelines for severe\n\n                                      -105-\n\f1    conditions of detention, but \"because thus far th[ose conditions]\n\n2    reflect only strict security measures rather than an abuse of\n\n3    those measures,\" it declined to do so.    Sent'g Tr. 33.    Instead,\n\n4    the court concluded that it would take Sattar's conditions of\n\n5    confinement into account in considering the section 3553(a)\n\n6    factors.\n\n7               2. Section 3553(a) Factors.   The district court began\n\n8    its section 3553(a) analysis with a correct calculation of the\n\n9    applicable Guidelines \"range\" -- life imprisonment.    The court\n\n10   then imposed the non-Guidelines sentence of 24 years'\n\n11   imprisonment, for which it gave three principal reasons.\n\n12              First, the court concluded that the terrorism\n\n13   enhancement overstated the seriousness of Sattar's crime by\n\n14   transforming a Guidelines range of 97 to 121 months to life\n\n15   imprisonment.    The court found that the otherwise-applicable\n\n16   Guideline range was \"relatively low\" because Sattar was convicted\n\n17   of conspiracy to murder and not of murder itself, and that the\n\n18   terrorism enhancement failed to account for the fact that \"no\n\n19   injury actually occurred in this case.\"    Sent'g Tr. 35.   The\n\n20   district court noted that a variance downward from a Guidelines\n\n21   range driven upward by the enhancement is permissible when the\n\n22   enhancement \"prevents the penalty from fitting the crime, based\n\n23   on the facts of th[e] record.\"    Id. at 35-36 (citing Mandhai, 375\n\n24   F.3d at 1249).\n\n25              Second, the terrorism enhancement put Sattar in the\n\n26   highest criminal history category, VI, \"without a single past\n\n                                      -106-\n\f1    criminal history point.\"    Id. at 36.   The district court\n\n2    concluded that such a jump \"overstates [Sattar's] past conduct\n\n3    and the likelihood that the defendant after a substantial period\n\n4    of incarceration would commit further crimes.\"     Id.\n\n5              Third, the court noted that Sattar had been under\n\n6    \"extremely restrictive conditions of confinement for 4-1/2\n\n7    years,\" and there \"is every reason to expect that his conditions\n\n8    of confinement will continue to be substantially more severe than\n\n9    the average prisoner.\"    Id. at 37.   These conditions include\n\n10   being kept in a cell for 23 hours a day and under constant\n\n11   surveillance.    As a result, the court concluded, \"the punitive\n\n12   aspects of the defendant's confinement are increased and the\n\n13   deterrent effect of the defendant's confinement is also\n\n14   increased.\"    Id.\n\n15             The court further noted that, for reasons explained in\n\n16   part under seal, a downward variance is warranted based on\n\n17   factors relevant to the history and characteristics of the\n\n18   defendant and the need to afford adequate deterrence.34       The\n\n19   district court observed that based on the totality of the\n\n20   circumstances and on its review of cases presented by the\n\n21   government as comparators, Sattar's sentence of 24 years'\n\n22   incarceration does not promote unwarranted sentencing\n\n23   disparities.\n\n\n\n\n          34\n             We have reviewed the document under seal.        See Sattar\n     Statement of Reasons, Oct. 26, 2006.\n                                   -107-\n\f1               3. Analysis.   The government's principal argument on\n\n2    cross-appeal is that Sattar's sentence is substantively\n\n3    unreasonable in light of his conduct and \"long-term dedication to\n\n4    violence.\"    Gov't Reply Br. 39.   We have no quarrel with the\n\n5    government as to the nature and quality of Sattar's conduct.\n\n6    Neither, to any significant extent, did the district court.       It\n\n7    considered, at length, the seriousness of Sattar's crimes.\n\n8               \"[A] sentence outside the Guidelines carries no\n\n9    presumption of unreasonableness.\"     Irizarry v. United States, 128\n\n10   S. Ct. 2198, 2202 (2008).    \"[T]he Guidelines are only one of the\n\n11   factors to consider when imposing sentence . . . .\"     Gall, 128 S.\n\n12   Ct. at 602.    Taking those precepts as a starting point, we are\n\n13   satisfied that in fashioning a non-Guidelines sentence, the\n\n14   district court did not clearly err in according weight to the\n\n15   factors it identified.    As we recently noted in Cavera, \"at the\n\n16   procedural part of review, we will not categorically proscribe\n\n17   any factor 'concerning the background, character, and conduct' of\n\n18   the defendant, with the exception of invidious factors.\"     Cavera,\n\n19   550 F.3d at 191.\n\n20              We have already noted in the context of Yousry's\n\n21   sentence that the fact that no injury occurred may be relevant to\n\n22   fashioning a sentence \"sufficient, but not greater than\n\n23   necessary\" to accomplish the purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C.\n\n24   3553(a).   And it was not clear error for the district court to\n\n25   conclude that a criminal history category of VI significantly\n\n\n\n                                     -108-\n\f1    overstated Sattar's criminal history and likelihood of committing\n\n2    further offenses.\n\n3                We have recognized that \"the Sentencing Commission had\n\n4    a rational basis for creating a uniform criminal history category\n\n5    for all terrorists under [U.S.S.G.] § 3A1.4(b), because even\n\n6    terrorists with no prior criminal behavior are unique among\n\n7    criminals in the likelihood of recidivism, the difficulty of\n\n8    rehabilitation, and the need for incapacitation.\"   United States\n\n9    v. Meskini, 319 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 538 U.S.\n\n10   1068 (2003).   But in the same virtual breath, we said, \"[a] judge\n\n11   determining that § 3A1.4(b) over-represents 'the seriousness of\n\n12   the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the\n\n13   defendant will commit other crimes' always has the discretion\n\n14   under § 4A1.3 to depart downward in sentencing.   U.S.S.G.\n\n15   § 4A1.3.\"   Id.\n\n16               And even with enhancements of magnitude -- i.e., those\n\n17   that \"sharply increase the recommended sentences\" -- there still\n\n18   may be \"a wide variety of culpability amongst defendants.\"\n\n19   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192.   There may therefore be \"different\n\n20   sentences based on the factors identified in § 3553(a).\"     Id.\n\n21   Sattar's crimes are indeed grave; he may well be the most\n\n22   culpable of these defendants.   But the district court has a\n\n23   responsibility, inter alia, \"to avoid unwarranted sentence\n\n24   disparities among defendants with similar records who have been\n\n25   found guilty of similar conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).\n\n26   Perhaps all who merit this enhancement are culpable and dangerous\n\n                                     -109-\n\f1    -- but some among them are more culpable, more dangerous, with\n\n2    crimes more serious, than others.   It is the district court that\n\n3    is primarily charged with the responsibility for making such\n\n4    distinctions.\n\n5              The district court is also in the best position to make\n\n6    an individual determination about the \"history and\n\n7    characteristics\" of a particular defendant, and to adjust the\n\n8    individualized sentence accordingly.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a);\n\n9    cf. U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3 (permitting downward departure where \"the\n\n10   court concludes that a defendant's criminal history category\n\n11   significantly over-represents the seriousness of a defendant's\n\n12   criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit\n\n13   further crimes\").   Upon examining the reasons the district court\n\n14   gave, we have no reason not to defer to its assessment here.\n\n15             It was not unreasonable for the district court to\n\n16   conclude that the severity of the conditions of confinement would\n\n17   increase the severity of the punishment and the amount of\n\n18   deterrence associated with a given term of imprisonment in light\n\n19   of the particular conditions of confinement under which Sattar is\n\n20   incarcerated.   The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\n21   varying downward based on those conditions here.     We think that\n\n22   the factors upon which the district court relied in determining\n\n23   Sattar's appropriate sentence can \"bear the weight\" the district\n\n24   court assigned to them.   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -110-\n\f1               We note, finally, that the court sentenced Sattar to\n\n2    more than twice what the maximum Guideline sentence would have\n\n3    been without the terrorism enhancement.\n\n4               The sentence thus adequately reflected the severity of\n\n5    the crime.\n\n6               C. Stewart's Sentence\n\n7               Before sentencing Stewart, the district court\n\n8    calculated her offense level under the November 2000 Guidelines\n\n9    to be 41, her criminal history category to be VI, and her\n\n10   Guidelines range to be 360 months, or 30 years, the statutory\n\n11   maximum.   The court concluded, however, that a sentence of 28\n\n12   months' imprisonment was sufficient but no greater than necessary\n\n13   to accomplish the purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n14              1. Guidelines Calculations\n\n15              a. Enhancements\n\n16              Over Stewart's objection, the district court concluded\n\n17   that the terrorism enhancement of section 3A1.4 applied because\n\n18   she had committed a federal crime of terrorism.   The enhancement\n\n19   was triggered in part by the district court's finding that\n\n20   Stewart's actions were \"calculated to affect the conduct of the\n\n21   Egyptian government through intimidation and coercion.\"    Sent'g\n\n22   Tr. 108.   The district court noted that Stewart's \"conduct cannot\n\n23   be found to be outside the heartland of the enhancement,\" but\n\n24   stated that it nonetheless would \"take all of the defendant's\n\n25   arguments [as to why the enhancement did not properly apply to\n\n\n\n                                    -111-\n\f1    her conduct] into account in performing the analysis under\n\n2    Section 3553(a).\"   Id.\n\n3              The district court noted that the terrorism enhancement\n\n4    automatically placed Stewart in criminal history category VI.\n\n5    The court appeared to accept Stewart's argument that the\n\n6    enhancement overstated the seriousness of her past conduct or the\n\n7    likelihood that she would commit further crimes.    Instead of\n\n8    adjusting the criminal history in the context of the Guidelines\n\n9    calculations themselves, however, the court found this to be \"one\n\n10   of the rare cases\" under United States v. Crosby, 397 F.3d 103,\n\n11   112 (2d Cir. 2005), where it would be more appropriate to\n\n12   determine the extent of the downward adjustment in the context of\n\n13   the section 3553(a) analysis.   Sent'g Tr. 109.35\n\n14             The government also sought an enhancement of Stewart's\n\n15   sentence on the ground that she obstructed justice.    The\n\n16   Guidelines provide that where a defendant \"willfully obstructed\n\n17   or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the\n\n18   administration of justice with respect to the investigation,\n\n19   prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction\"\n\n20   and where the obstructive conduct related to the offense of\n\n21   conviction or a closely related offense, that the applicable\n\n\n\n          35\n             In Crosby, we said that \"a sentencing judge will\n     normally have to determine the applicable Guidelines range\" but\n     that precise calculation of the range may not be necessary in\n     \"situations . . . where either of two Guidelines ranges, whether\n     or not adjacent, is applicable, but the sentencing judge, having\n     complied with section 3553(a), makes a decision to impose a\n     non-Guidelines sentence, regardless of which of the two ranges\n     applies.\" Crosby, 397 F.3d at 111-12.\n                                   -112-\n\f1    Guidelines should be enhanced by 2 levels.     U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.\n\n2    The government argued that Stewart committed perjury by\n\n3    testifying \"that she understood that there was a bubble built\n\n4    into the SAMs whereby the attorneys could issue press releases\n\n5    containing Abdel Rahman's statements as part of their\n\n6    representation of him\" and testifying about her purported lack of\n\n7    knowledge of Taha.   Sent'g Tr. 111.    As we have noted, Taha was a\n\n8    follower of Abdel Rahman and a military leader in al-Gama'a who\n\n9    claimed responsibility for the November 1997 massacre at Luxor,\n\n10   and was allegedly part of the Count-Two conspiracy.     The district\n\n11   court noted that there was \"evidence to indicate that [Stewart's]\n\n12   statements were false statements.\"     Id.   It concluded, however,\n\n13   that it was \"unnecessary to reach [the question] whether the\n\n14   defendant knowingly gave false testimony with the intent to\n\n15   obstruct the proceedings\" for two reasons:     First, the Guidelines\n\n16   calculation already provided for the statutory maximum permitted\n\n17   by the statutes of conviction, and second, a non-Guidelines\n\n18   sentence was, in the estimation of the court, \"reasonable and\n\n19   most consistent with the factors set forth in Section 3553(a).\"\n\n20   Id. at 111-12.\n\n21             b. Departures\n\n22             Stewart sought a downward departure pursuant to section\n\n23   5H1.4 of the Guidelines, which provides that while \"[p]hysical\n\n24   condition . . . is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether\n\n25   a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range,\"\n\n26   nonetheless \"an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason\n\n                                    -113-\n\f1    to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range.\"\n\n2    U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4.     Stewart proffered substantial documentation of\n\n3    serious illness.     As with Stewart's criminal history\n\n4    calculations, the district court concluded that it \"[did] not\n\n5    have to reach the question of whether [Stewart's] medical\n\n6    condition, given her age and continuing treatment, is sufficient\n\n7    in itself to warrant a departure from the guidelines,\" because it\n\n8    would take that condition into account in making its\n\n9    determination under section 3553(a).     Sent'g Tr. 110.\n\n10               The district court declined to adjust the Guidelines\n\n11   calculations based on Stewart's argument that she committed her\n\n12   crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm as set forth in\n\n13   \"Lesser Harms\" policy statement of the Guidelines.     See U.S.S.G.\n\n14   § 5K2.11.    Stewart argued before the district court that her\n\n15   conduct \"was the product of her perception that her client's\n\n16   health and well-being [was] seriously jeopardized by his\n\n17   continued imprisonment in the United States.\"     Stewart Sent'g Br.\n\n18   44-45.   Under the policy statement, where a defendant \"commit[s]\n\n19   a crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm,\" \"a reduced\n\n20   sentence may be appropriate, provided that the circumstances\n\n21   significantly diminish society's interest in punishing the\n\n22   conduct, for example, in the case of a mercy killing.\"     U.S.S.G.\n\n23   § 5K2.11.    However, \"[w]here the interest in punishment or\n\n24   deterrence is not reduced, a reduction in sentence is not\n\n25   warranted.\"    Id.   Here, the district court found this case not to\n\n26   be one where the interest in punishment or deterrence is reduced.\n\n                                      -114-\n\f1     The policy statement further provides that a reduction in the\n\n2    otherwise applicable sentence might be appropriate where \"conduct\n\n3    may not cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented\n\n4    by the law proscribing the offense at issue\" such as \"where a war\n\n5    veteran possessed a machine gun or grenade as a trophy, or a\n\n6    school teacher possessed controlled substances for display in a\n\n7    drug education program.\"    U.S.S.G. § 5K2.11.   But the court\n\n8    declined to conclude that Stewart's conduct did not cause or\n\n9    threaten the harm sought to be prevented by the statutes that\n\n10   Stewart violated.\n\n11               Stewart also moved for a departure on the ground that\n\n12   her conduct was \"aberrational.\"    A Guidelines policy statement\n\n13   provides that \"[a] sentence below the applicable guideline range\n\n14   may be warranted in an extraordinary case if the defendant's\n\n15   criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior.\"     U.S.S.G.\n\n16   § 5K2.20.    But the court, noting that Stewart's conduct was\n\n17   \"committed over an extended period of time, involv[ing] repeated\n\n18   acts of deception, and . . . significant planning,\" Sent'g Tr.\n\n19   110, concluded that such a departure would be inappropriate, and\n\n20   declined to grant it.\n\n21               The district court thus reached its final Guidelines\n\n22   calculation, using the November 2000 Guidelines, with a total\n\n23   offense level of 41, a criminal history category of VI, and\n\n24   therefore a Guidelines \"range\" of 360 months, the statutory\n\n25   maximum.    The government sought a term of life imprisonment;\n\n26   Stewart sought a non-incarceratory sentence.\n\n                                     -115-\n\f1              2. Section 3553(a) Factors.   Based on its section\n\n2    3553(a) analysis, the district court's sentence substantially\n\n3    varied from the applicable Guidelines range.\n\n4              As the starting point for its section 3553(a) analysis,\n\n5    the court addressed the applicability of the terrorism\n\n6    enhancement, which \"while correct under the guidelines, would\n\n7    result in an unreasonable result . . . and produce a guideline\n\n8    range about quadruple the range [that would otherwise apply]\n\n9    without the enhancement.\"   Sent'g Tr. 114.   The district court\n\n10   then observed:\n\n11             First, that Stewart's was an \"atypical case\" for the\n\n12   terrorism enhancement inasmuch as \"the thrust of the violation\n\n13   was the provision of a co-conspirator to a terrorist conspiracy,\"\n\n14   id. at 113; second, as with Sattar, that the structure of the\n\n15   terrorism enhancement prevented the Guidelines from taking into\n\n16   account the fact that no victim was harmed as a result of the\n\n17   offense as charged; and third, again as with Sattar, that the\n\n18   enhancement operated to prevent the Guidelines from taking into\n\n19   account Stewart's actual criminal history.    By virtue of the\n\n20   terrorism enhancement, Stewart was automatically classified as\n\n21   within criminal history category VI, the highest possible\n\n22   category, whereas if her sentence were based on her actual\n\n23   criminal history, she would have been classified in category I,\n\n24   the lowest possible category.\n\n25             The court therefore concluded that the terrorism\n\n26   enhancement was \"dramatically unreasonable\" and \"overstates the\n\n                                     -116-\n\f1    seriousness of [her] past conduct and the likelihood that [she]\n\n2    will repeat the offense.\"   Id.    Stewart \"has no criminal history\n\n3    and yet is placed in the highest criminal history category equal\n\n4    to that of repeat felony offenders for the most serious offenses\n\n5    including murder and drug trafficking.\"       Id. at 113-14.    The\n\n6    criminal history category was inappropriate, the court\n\n7    determined, in light of \"the likelihood of recidivism, the\n\n8    difficulty of rehabilitation and the need for incapacitation.\"\n\n9    Id. at 114.\n\n10              The court found that Stewart's opportunity to repeat\n\n11   \"the crimes to which she had been convicted will be nil\" because\n\n12   she \"will lose her license to practice law\" and \"will be forever\n\n13   separated from any contact with Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman.\"         Id.\n\n14   Loss of her license to practice law both removes \"the occasion\n\n15   for her offenses\" and \"is itself a punishment.\"        Id. at 116.\n\n16              The district court viewed Stewart's personal\n\n17   characteristics as \"extraordinary\" and thought they \"argue[d]\n\n18   strongly in favor of a substantial downward variance.\"         Id. at\n\n19   114.   The court described her as a dedicated public servant who\n\n20   had, throughout her career, \"represented the poor, the\n\n21   disadvantaged and the unpopular, often as a Court-appointed\n\n22   attorney,\" thereby providing a \"service not only to her clients\n\n23   but to the nation.\"   Id. at 115-16.      And \"[h]aving spent her\n\n24   professional career often representing the poor, she is now, at\n\n25   the end of her career, financially destitute.\"       Id. at 115.\n\n\n\n                                       -117-\n\f1              The court also took into account Stewart's ill health\n\n2    -- she had, for example, suffered from cancer, for which she had\n\n3    undergone surgery and radiation therapy, and for which there is a\n\n4    significant chance of recurrence.   The district court was of the\n\n5    view that in light of those conditions and her age, 67 years old\n\n6    at the time, prison would be \"particularly difficult\" for her,\n\n7    and that at her age, moreover, her sentence would \"represent a\n\n8    greater portion of her remaining life than for a younger\n\n9    defendant and provide increased punishment.\"   Id. at 117.\n\n10             3. Analysis\n\n11             a. The Scope of Review\n\n12             The government's principal argument on appeal is that\n\n13   in light of the crimes of which Stewart stands convicted, her\n\n14   sentence was substantively unreasonable.   Section 3553(a)\n\n15   instructs that the sentence must \"reflect the seriousness of the\n\n16   offense, . . . promote respect for the law, and . . . provide\n\n17   just punishment for the offense\" and \"afford adequate deterrence\n\n18   to criminal conduct.\"   18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A) & (B).   Our\n\n19   review for substantive reasonableness is a \"particularly\n\n20   deferential form of abuse-of-discretion review.\"   Cavera, 550\n\n21   F.3d at 188 n.5 (citing Gall 128 S. Ct. at 591).   But our review\n\n22   must also be \"meaningful.\"   Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597; cf. Gerard\n\n23   E. Lynch, Letting Guidelines Be Guidelines (And Judges Be\n\n24   Judges), Ohio St. J. Crim. L. Amici: Views From the Field (Jan.\n\n25   2008), at http://osjcl.blogspot.com/ (\"[W]e should let\n\n26   (appellate) judges be judges . . . , performing their traditional\n\n                                    -118-\n\f1    function of reining in excess and gradually developing a 'common\n\n2    law' of what is and is not sensible.\" (emphasis deleted)).\n\n3              Like the district court, we are impressed by the\n\n4    factors that figured in Stewart's modest sentence -- particularly\n\n5    her admirable history of providing, at no little personal cost to\n\n6    herself, proficient legal services in difficult cases to those\n\n7    who could not otherwise afford them.   We think it noteworthy,\n\n8    moreover, that the last of the acts for which Stewart is being\n\n9    punished occurred a short time before the September 11 attacks on\n\n10   the United States.   That carnage might have raised in her, as it\n\n11   surely has in many or most of us, a heightened awareness of and\n\n12   sensitivity to the imminent dangers of terrorism and the possible\n\n13   scope of the deadly capabilities of the terrorists with whom she\n\n14   was dealing.\n\n15             We also recognize, as did the district court, that the\n\n16   terrorism enhancement may apply to persons who are culpable in\n\n17   substantially different degrees; that Stewart's culpability may\n\n18   well be understood to be less than Sattar's; and that the\n\n19   district court may differentiate between different levels of\n\n20   culpable conduct that nonetheless trigger the same substantial\n\n21   enhancement.   Yet Stewart's sentence is strikingly low in light\n\n22   of what the district court correctly described as the\n\n23   \"irreducible core of [her] extraordinarily severe criminal\n\n24   conduct,\" Sent'g Tr. 118, \"which was committed over an extended\n\n25   period of time, involved repeated acts of deception, and\n\n26   involve[d] significant planning,\" id. at 110.\n\n                                    -119-\n\f1              For us to \"patrol the boundaries of [the]\n\n2    reasonableness\" of a sentence imposed by a gifted and experienced\n\n3    trial judge who has spent years intensively involved overseeing a\n\n4    prosecution may turn out to be the legal equivalent of squaring\n\n5    the circle.36   Yet that is what we are instructed to do.   Cavera,\n\n6    550 F.3d at 191.    While we will not lightly substitute our\n\n7    judgment for the carefully executed judgment of the learned trial\n\n8    judge, we think that in light of the fact Stewart used her\n\n9    privileged status as a lawyer to facilitate her violation of the\n\n10   law, and possibly committed perjury at trial in an attempt to\n\n11   avoid punishment for her conduct, her sentence at least tests\n\n12   those \"boundaries.\"\n\n13             b.    Stewart's Abuse of Her Status\n14                   as a Member of the Bar\n\n15             Stewart argues that she did no more than serve as a\n\n16   zealous advocate for her client.    That belief, if indeed she\n\n17   harbored it, gave her no license to violate the law.    Stewart's\n\n18   actions tended ultimately and ironically to subvert the same\n\n19   fundamental right of which she took advantage -- the\n\n20   constitutional right to counsel -- by making it less likely that\n\n21   other incarcerated persons will have the same level of access to\n\n22   counsel that her client was given.\n\n\n\n\n          36\n             The classic mathematical challenge of \"squaring the\n     circle,\" i.e., creating a square with the same area as a given\n     circle using only compass and straight edge, was, in 1882, proved\n     to be impossible. See 7 New Encyclopaedia Britannica\n     Micropaedia, \"Lindemann, (Carl Louis) Ferdinand von,\" 372 (15th\n     ed. 2002).\n                                   -120-\n\f1              The district court seemed to appreciate that fact,\n\n2    noting that Stewart \"abused her position as a lawyer\" in\n\n3    committing her crimes.   Sent'g Tr. 118.   The court did not,\n\n4    however, explain how and to what extent the sentence reflected\n\n5    the seriousness of the crimes of conviction in light of the fact\n\n6    that Stewart was engaged as a member of the bar when she\n\n7    committed them.\n\n8              The question therefore remains whether, because she was\n\n9    an experienced and dedicated lawyer acting as such when she broke\n\n10   the law in the manner that she did, her punishment should have\n\n11   been greater than it was.37\n\n12             c.   A Comparison of Yousry's and Stewart's Sentences\n\n13             A comparison between Stewart's and Yousry's offense\n\n14   conduct serves to highlight the seriousness of Stewart's crimes\n\n15   and the seemingly modest sentence she received for it.    Unlike\n\n16   Yousry, Stewart publicly disseminated \"potentially lethal\"\n\n\n          37\n             The district court did not address whether Stewart\n     \"abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special\n     skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission\n     or concealment of the offense,\" meriting a two-level enhancement\n     under the Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3; see also United\n     States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 192 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 128\n     S.Ct. 115 (2007) (concluding that district court did not err in\n     applying enhancement where the defendant \"used his special skills\n     as a lawyer\" to facilitate the crime). Judge Walker, in his\n     opinion, criticizes the district court for \"fail[ing] to explain\n     why an enhancement for abuse of trust is not plainly appropriate\n     in this case.\" Op. of J. Walker at [35:19-20]. But the\n     government did not specifically invoke section 3B1.3 in its\n     sentencing memorandum or on appeal. We therefore think it hard\n     to fault the district court on this score. We nonetheless share\n     many of Judge Walker's concerns in this regard. See id. at\n     [35:19-38:9]. The district court may address this issue on\n     remand.\n                                   -121-\n\f1    statements on Abdel Rahman's behalf.    Unlike Yousry, Stewart was\n\n2    convicted of making false statements to the government when she\n\n3    agreed to abide by the terms of the SAMs.   Unlike Yousry, Stewart\n\n4    was a member of the bar and therefore acting as an officer of the\n\n5    court.   See, e.g., United States v. Seltzer, 227 F.3d 36, 41 (2d\n\n6    Cir. 2000).    She was legally knowledgeable, highly experienced,\n\n7    and politically sophisticated, a lawyer acting in her\n\n8    professional capacity; he was a student working for her and Abdel\n\n9    Rahman as a translator.\n\n10             Yet Yousry's sentence was 20 months; Stewart's only\n\n11   eight months longer.\n\n12             d.   Stewart's Alleged Perjury\n\n13             Also unlike Yousry, Stewart may well have obstructed\n\n14   justice at trial.   The government, supported by substantial\n\n15   evidence, argued that Stewart committed perjury at trial.   The\n\n16   district court summarized the argument as follows:\n\n17             First the government contends that Ms.\n18             Stewart knowingly gave false testimony when\n19             she testified that she understood that there\n20             was a bubble built into the SAMs whereby the\n21             attorneys could issue press releases\n22             containing Abdel Rahman's statements as part\n23             of their representation of him.\n24             The government also contends that Ms. Stewart\n25             testified falsely when she denied knowing who\n26             Taha was until learning about him in the\n27             course of the trial except for an article\n28             that she came across in her representation of\n29             Yasir Ahmed.\n\n30   Sent'g Tr. 111.   The court, having thus recited the allegations\n\n31   at sentencing, declined to decide the issue.\n\n\n                                     -122-\n\f1              As noted, the district court gave two reasons for not\n\n2    making such a finding.   First, it concluded that because\n\n3    Stewart's Guidelines calculations had reached the statutory\n\n4    maximum of 360 months, a finding of obstruction of justice would\n\n5    not have changed the calculation.   This would be true if the\n\n6    terrorism enhancement had been applied in Stewart's case, but the\n\n7    district court, after determining that Stewart's conduct was in\n\n8    the enhancement's \"heartland,\" did not apply it.   And even were\n\n9    it true, the question of Stewart's perjury is nonetheless\n\n10   relevant to her sentence pursuant to section 3553.   Section\n\n11   3553(a) requires the district court to impose a sentence\n\n12   \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to, among other\n\n13   things, promote respect for the law.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).\n\n14   Whether Stewart lied to the jury under oath or upon affirmation\n\n15   at her trial is relevant to whether her sentence was \"sufficient\"\n\n16   under the circumstances.\n\n17             The district court's second reason for declining to\n\n18   determine whether Stewart committed perjury during the course of\n\n19   her testimony was that it had determined that a non-Guidelines\n\n20   sentence was \"reasonable and most consistent with the factors set\n\n21   forth in Section 3553(a).\"   Sent'g Tr. 111-12.   But as noted, we\n\n22   think that whether Stewart lied under oath at her trial is\n\n23   directly relevant to whether her sentence was appropriate in\n\n24   light of Section 3553(a).    Her willingness as a lawyer knowingly\n\n25   and falsely to affirm her intention to obey the SAMs and then to\n\n26   seek to cover up this knowing violation of the law with\n\n                                     -123-\n\f1    perjurious testimony, might well, if proven, influence our\n\n2    conclusion as to the propriety of her sentence.   Any cover-up or\n\n3    attempt to evade responsibility by a failure to tell the truth\n\n4    upon oath or affirmation at her trial would compound the gravity\n\n5    of her crime.\n\n6                We conclude that by declining to decide whether Stewart\n\n7    committed perjury or otherwise obstructed justice, the district\n\n8    court procedurally erred.\n\n9                4.   Remand\n\n10               A district court's failure to find particular facts\n\n11   will in no way impede our review in some, perhaps in most,\n\n12   situations; this, however, is not one of them.    Especially in\n\n13   light of the absence of a finding that Stewart did not commit\n\n14   perjury at trial or otherwise obstruct justice, we cannot\n\n15   determine whether her sentence was substantively reasonable.\n\n16               We therefore remand this matter to the district court\n\n17   for resentencing, in the course of which we direct the court to\n\n18   determine the issue of perjury and if it finds such perjury, to\n\n19   resentence Stewart so as to reflect that finding.    The district\n\n20   court should also consider whether Stewart's conduct as a lawyer\n\n21   triggers the special-skill/abuse-of-trust enhancement under the\n\n22   Guidelines, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, and reconsider the extent to\n\n23   which Stewart's status as a lawyer affects the appropriate\n\n24   sentence.    Upon resentencing Stewart, the district court may\n\n25   consider, or reconsider, any additional matter that may bear\n\n26   upon Stewart's sentence.\n\n                                     -124-\n\f1              Although we find no procedural or substantive error in\n\n2    connection with the sentencing of Sattar and Yousry, we\n\n3    nonetheless remand their cases, too.    We conclude that, inasmuch\n\n4    as the interrelationship among the sentences of the co-\n\n5    defendants is a principal consideration as to a proper sentence\n\n6    of Stewart, the district court should have the ability, if not\n\n7    the obligation, to resentence them as well.\n\n8              After the district court completes the resentencing,\n\n9    jurisdiction may be restored to this Court by letter from any\n\n10   party, and the Office of the Clerk of this Court shall set an\n\n11   expeditious briefing schedule and refer the matter to this panel\n\n12   for further review.\n\n13                              CONCLUSION\n\n14             For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction of\n\n15   Stewart, but remand this cause to the district court for\n\n16   resentencing of Stewart, see United States v. Phillips, 431 F.3d\n\n17   86, 90 (2d Cir. 2005), and resentencing of Sattar or Yousry or\n\n18   both if the district court determines that they should receive\n\n19   different sentences in light of the sentence imposed on Stewart.\n\n20   Inasmuch as the current sentences will remain in effect as to\n\n21   Stewart and Yousry until the district court resentences Stewart\n\n22   -- and Sattar or Yousry if it decides to do so -- and in light\n\n23   of the fact that we affirm on all issues related to the guilt of\n\n24   all defendants, the district court is directed to order Stewart\n\n25   and Yousry to surrender forthwith to begin serving their terms\n\n26   of incarceration.\n\n                                  -125-\n\f 1   CALABRESI, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n 2\n 3          I join Judge Sack’s opinion in full. I write separately to comment on our decision with\n\n 4   respect to Stewart’s sentence.\n\n 5          When a judge of extraordinary ability and a well-earned reputation for exceptional\n\n 6   judgment has spent as much time on a case like this, making many decisions of tremendous\n\n 7   difficulty—which on review we are all in agreement were correct and wisely done—even the\n\n 8   usual deference that the Supreme Court indicated should be paid to the district court’s sentencing\n\n 9   must constitute an understatement. This is especially so with respect to any notions as to the\n\n10   substantive reasonableness of a sentence. We may find that there are some procedural or\n\n11   technical matters that warrant more consideration by the district judge, such as the question of\n\n12   whether Stewart committed perjury and the relevance of this in determining an appropriate\n\n13   sentence, given the district court’s treatment of the terrorism enhancement. But for us—who\n\n14   have not been involved in the case and do not know all the backs and forths, some of which may\n\n15   even be best left not fully articulated—to second guess the district court’s judgment seems to me\n\n16   to be precisely what both the Supreme Court and our court sitting en banc in United States v.\n\n17   Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 194 (2d Cir. 2008), have said we should not do. I join the majority\n\n18   opinion because I understand it to avoid second guessing. I write here to explore some of the\n\n19   principal issues on which this panel is divided and to give fuller expression to the importance of\n\n20   having appellate courts appreciate the limited, though still important, institutional role we play,\n\n21   particularly in a case such as this one, where the temptation to go beyond that role is so great.1\n\n\n     1\n      Judge Walker, in his partial dissent, suggests that I believe some judges are infallible and\n     beyond reproach. Far from it; were that my view, I could not join the majority opinion in\n\n\n                                                       1\n\f1                                                    I.\n\n2          After calculating Stewart’s sentence under the Guidelines, the district court applied the §\n\n3   3553(a) factors and concluded that the effect of the terrorism enhancement, “while correct under\n\n4   the guidelines, would result in an unreasonable result” in this particular case. Sent’g Tr. 114.\n\n5   The district court arrived at this conclusion based on, inter alia, (1) the somewhat atypical nature\n\n6   of Stewart’s case for the imposition of the terrorism enhancement, and (2) the lack of evidence\n\n7   that any victim was harmed as a result of the charged offense.2 Id. at 113. As a procedural\n\n8   matter, each of these grounds seems to me to be well within the district court’s discretion to\n\n\n\n\n    remanding Stewart’s sentence. Indeed, I agree completely with the implication in Judge\n    Walker’s statement that all judges, including distinguished appellate ones, can become so\n    preoccupied with a case as to lose perspective. My point is simply that before we assume that a\n    very able district judge has erred substantively in sentencing, we should be especially cautious\n    both in our language and in our judgments, and if we have doubts we should give that judge\n    every opportunity to explain the sentence imposed.\n    2\n      The district court also found that the terrorism enhancement’s increase of Stewart’s Criminal\n    History Category from I to VI—the result of the enhancement’s “horizontal” component—was\n    “dramatically unreasonable in [her] case” because it “overstate[d] the seriousness of [her] past\n    conduct and the likelihood that [she would] repeat the offense.” Sent’g Tr. 113. Because no\n    member of this panel suggests this determination was procedural error, I do not focus on it. It is\n    worth keeping in mind, however, that multiple considerations informed the district court’s view\n    that application of the terrorism enhancement—which “produce[d] a guideline range about\n    quadruple the range without that enhancement”—would be inappropriate in Stewart’s case. Id. at\n    114. For that reason, some of Judge Walker’s contentions—such as that the majority opinion,\n    and my concurrence especially, “erroneously permit[] the district court to eliminate the\n    enhancement altogether primarily because [harm did not result],” Op. of J. Walker at [26], or that\n    the district court “[r]emov[ed]” Stewart from the “terrorism spectrum” because of its view that\n    her crime was atypical, id. at [25]—strike me as misleading. Furthermore, in doing this, and\n    elsewhere in his opinion, Judge Walker seems to label as procedural errors decisions that are\n    normally considered substantive judgments about the amount of weight a particular factor can\n    bear—judgments that we are to review under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard after\n    taking into the account “the totality of the circumstances.” See Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct.\n    586, 597 (2007).\n\n\n                                                     2\n\f 1   consider. What is more, I would be extremely reluctant to disturb a district court’s careful effort\n\n 2   to look to the unique circumstances of a defendant like Stewart and arrive at an individualized\n\n 3   sentence where the Guidelines recommendation is controlled by an undeniably broad\n\n 4   enhancement (or reduction) like the terrorism enhancement.\n\n 5                                                    A.\n\n 6          When the terrorism enhancement is applied, it has dramatic consequences on the\n\n 7   applicable Guidelines range because it automatically increases both the offense level of a crime\n\n 8   and the defendant’s Criminal History Category. In Stewart’s case, for example, the\n\n 9   recommended sentence range without the enhancement was 78 to 97 months, while imposition of\n\n10   the enhancement resulted in a recommended sentence of 360 months, the statutory maximum.\n\n11   Yet as both the majority opinion and Judge Walker, in his partial dissent, recognize, the terrorism\n\n12   enhancement casts a very broad net. In this case, that breadth was compounded by the fact that\n\n13   the “federal crime of terrorism” for which Stewart was convicted, i.e. the provision of material\n\n14   support, itself covers a wide range of conduct of varying degrees of culpability ranging from the\n\n15   supply of lodging to the contribution of “weapons, lethal substances, [and] explosives.” See 18\n\n16   U.S.C. § 2339A. When a Guidelines recommendation has such dramatic consequences and yet\n\n17   covers a multitude of sins, unusually broad sentencing discretion in the district court is essential.\n\n18   Indeed, it must be so to comply with the Supreme Court’s remedial holding in United States v.\n\n19   Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 244 (2005).\n\n20          We articulated this precise point in Cavera, recognizing that “some Guidelines\n\n21   enhancements and reductions apply without modulation to a wide range of conduct.” 550 F.3d at\n\n22   192. We identified as examples several financial crimes where the recommended sentence under\n\n\n                                                       3\n\f 1   the Guidelines varies dramatically according to the money involved, but the culpability of an\n\n 2   individual defendant might not be captured accurately by a single variable like financial impact.\n\n 3   Id. Perhaps more closely analogous to the terrorism enhancement, we pointed to the Armed\n\n 4   Career Criminal Guidelines, under which the recommended sentences for firearms offenses\n\n 5   increase sharply if the defendant has a prior conviction for a “crime of violence”—an expansive\n\n 6   term that places crimes like attempted burglary of a dwelling under the same umbrella as crimes\n\n 7   like murder and rape. See id. (citing U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)). The terrorism enhancement in its\n\n 8   breadth of coverage is akin to these examples from Cavera. The majority opinion understands\n\n 9   this when it says that the terrorism enhancement “may apply to persons who are culpable in\n\n10   substantially different degrees,” and that the district court “may differentiate between different\n\n11   levels of culpable conduct that nonetheless trigger the same substantial enhancement.” Maj. Op.\n\n12   at [119].\n\n13          We indicated in Cavera that when a district court faces such over- and under-inclusive\n\n14   Guidelines recommendations and when, after considering the § 3553(a) factors, it promulgates a\n\n15   sentence that varies from that recommendation, the district court’s decision, “if adequately\n\n16   explained, should be reviewed especially deferentially.” 550 F.3d at 192 (emphasis added).\n\n17   Nothing we hold here should be understood to conflict with that principle, or to cast doubt on the\n\n18   district court’s apparent conclusion that there must be much room for discretion under the\n\n19   terrorism enhancement.3\n\n\n     3\n       Let me be absolutely clear. Neither the majority opinion nor my concurrence suggests that\n     district courts have greater discretion exclusively for sentencing terrorism defendants. In fact, I\n     believe precisely the opposite. My point is that the terrorism enhancement is, like the examples\n     identified in Cavera, one instance of a Guidelines enhancement that applies “without\n\n\n                                                       4\n\f 1          While we have raised questions about the closeness of Yousry and Stewart’s sentences in\n\n 2   light of Stewart’s seemingly greater level of responsibility and status as a lawyer, and while we\n\n 3   would benefit from greater explanation by the district court on this issue, it remains the district\n\n 4   court’s task to assess where Stewart’s criminal behavior falls along the spectrum of terrorism\n\n 5   enhancement culpability. And I would be very reluctant—when and if I had to review a sentence\n\n 6   in this case for substantive reasonableness—to find an abuse of discretion in a conclusion by the\n\n 7   district court that Stewart’s conduct, though undeniably serious, was significantly less serious\n\n 8   than that of other defendants subject to the terrorism enhancement.\n\n 9                                                    B.\n10\n11          I am more ambivalent about the degree to which absence of harm is a valid ground on\n\n12   which to mitigate a sentence. But I am confident that we should not preclude a district court\n\n13   from giving lack of harm some weight, even for crimes of terrorism. Whether it is fair to assign\n\n14   different levels of culpability in criminal sentencing to the same criminal conduct based on the\n\n15   fortuity of whether harm results has long been a contested question in Anglo-American\n\n\n     modulation” to a wide range of conduct, and that we should be especially deferential to a district\n     court’s reasoned decision to vary from such a broad Guidelines recommendation. See Cavera,\n     550 F.3d at 192.\n             In contrast, Judge Walker does appear to advocate a separate sentencing jurisprudence for\n     terrorism cases. Judge Walker repeatedly seeks to distinguish terrorism-related crimes from\n     other crimes, and even suggests that, as to harm in terrorism crimes, the sentencing reviews of\n     appellate courts should run in one direction only. See Op. of J. Walker at [27] He also states\n     that the wide variety of conduct encompassed by “terrorism support,” unlike the wide variety of\n     conduct covered by other crimes, does not give rise to added district court discretion in\n     sentencing. See id. at [24–25]. He attributes this to congressional decisions. With great respect, I\n     have difficulty reading what Congress has mandated as creating these differences. Judge Walker\n     clearly views terrorism-related crimes as in a different category from all other very serious\n     felonies—and he may well be right. It is, however, an error—though a common one among all\n     judges—to attribute one’s own heartfelt and perhaps correct views to the legislators.\n\n\n                                                       5\n\f 1   jurisprudence. See H.L.A. HART , THE CONCEPT OF LAW 131 (1968) (“Why should the accidental\n\n 2   fact that an intended harmful outcome has not occurred be ground for punishing less a criminal\n\n 3   who may be equally dangerous and equally wicked?”). But whatever significance the\n\n 4   consequences of a defendant’s actions ought to have, it is an inevitable part of human\n\n 5   nature—and our law—that we as a society do give consequences considerable weight when we\n\n 6   mete out punishment and blame.4 This is deeply entrenched in our legal system. The majority\n\n 7   opinion identifies the law of attempts as one generally accepted instantiation of this tendency,\n\n 8   Maj. Op. at [99–100], but there are many others—such as crimes of culpable risk creation, like\n\n 9   vehicular homicide. And while it is true that material support to terrorism is a complete crime\n\n10   rather than an inchoate one, and so fully punishable even if no further harm results, it simply\n\n11   does not follow that the amount of punishment may not at least in part depend on the harm that\n\n12   occurred. The level of punishment for a completed crime varies all the time based on the amount\n\n13   of harm that has occurred, and the Guidelines themselves often directly embrace such a policy.5\n\n\n     4\n       See Sanford H. Kadish, The Criminal Law and the Luck of the Draw, 84 J. CRIM . L &\n     CRIMINOLOGY 679, 688 (1994) (“While in principle it’s difficult to find good reasons for making\n     desert turn on chance, here’s the rub: most of us do in fact make judgments precisely of this\n     kind.”). See generally PAUL H. ROBINSON & JOHN DARLEY , JUSTICE , LIABILITY AND BLAME:\n     COMMUNITY VIEWS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW (1995) (presenting studies suggesting public\n     judgments about criminal culpability turn significantly on the level of harm that results from an\n     action).\n     5\n       Judge Walker identifies several examples in his opinion, though he reaches a different\n     conclusion about their import. See Op. of J. Walker at [26 n.11] (identifying as examples the\n     increase of the offense level for conspiracy or solicitation to commit murder if the offense results\n     in death, U.S.S.G. § 2A1.5(c)(1)), and the increase of the offense level for aggravated assault\n     based on victim’s injuries, Id. § 2A2.(b)(3)). There are many other examples. See Kate Stith,\n     The Arc of the Pendulum: Judges, Prosecutors, and the Exercise of Discretion, 117 YALE L.J.\n     1420, 1476 (2008) (“Guidelines sentences for both drug crimes and financial crimes depend\n     heavily on the quantity of harm found by the sentencing judge . . . .”).\n\n\n                                                      6\n\f1          Judge Walker suggests terrorism is different, and that, at least in the “very broad\n\n2   heartland of cases,” it is procedural error for the district court to consider absence of harm as\n\n3   relevant to the application of the terrorism enhancement and ultimately to the imposition of a\n\n4   sentence.6 He argues that treating harm as a consideration relevant to sentencing those convicted\n\n5   of terrorism related crimes, such as for material support, would effectively nullify the policy\n\n6   considerations of Congress and the Sentencing Commission, who have not made reductions for\n\n7   lack of harm part of the terrorism enhancement. Even if the Guidelines do not themselves make\n\n8   lack of harm relevant for the application of the terrorism enhancement—and they fail to do so\n\n9   only in the narrow sense that the enhancement does not positively reflect the existence of\n\n\n\n    6\n      Though Judge Walker suggests otherwise, it is not at all unprecedented for a district court to\n    consider lack of harm relevant to sentencing in a terrorism case. Indeed, in a case that Judge\n    Walker cites, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a district court decision that did just that. See United\n    States v. Garey, 546 F.3d 1359, 1363–64 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). In that case, the district\n    court found that the terrorism enhancement applied, but then granted a downward variance based\n    in part on the fact that the defendant had not carried out any violent acts at the time of his\n    apprehension. See United States v. Garey, 383 F. Supp. 2d 1374, 1379 (M.D. Ga. 2005) (“It is . .\n    . troubling that another defendant who carried out a threat to bomb public facilities, injuring and\n    maiming (but not killing) thousands of people, would face the same sentence as this Defendant\n    who did not cause physical injury to a single person.”). In upholding the defendant’s sentence as\n    not unreasonable, the Eleventh Circuit specifically noted that the district court had already\n    considered the defendant’s arguments about the lack of actual harm and, on the basis of the §\n    3553(a) factors, imposed a reasonable sentence below the advisory Guidelines range. See Garey,\n    546 F.3d at 1364.\n             Judge Walker cites Garey, and other cases, for the proposition that courts apply the\n    terrorism enhancement even in the absence of harm. Op. of J. Walker at [27 n.13]. That is true,\n    but it is not relevant to the precise issue we face because the district court here agreed that the\n    enhancement applied under the Guidelines. It is also incorrect to say that, for all practical\n    purposes, the district court used lack of harm to nullify the sentencing enhancement, because that\n    was not the only consideration relied upon by the district court to support its variance. See supra\n    note 2. The real question is whether, as a procedural matter, lack of harm can support some\n    downward variance in a terrorism case. To this narrow question, other courts have said, or at\n    least strongly implied, that the answer is yes.\n\n\n                                                      7\n\f 1   injury—the Supreme Court has made clear that a district court, which has “greater familiarity\n\n 2   with [] the individual case and the individual defendant,” may properly decide that sentencing\n\n 3   judgments made by the Guidelines fail properly to reflect the § 3553(a) considerations. See Rita\n\n 4   v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 351 (2007).\n\n 5          What is more, the Court has evidenced profound skepticism toward arguments that\n\n 6   certain policy judgments, which require departing from the Guidelines, have implicitly been\n\n 7   taken off the table as a result of congressional silence or inaction. See Kimbrough v. United\n\n 8   States, 128 S. Ct. 558, 570–73 (2007). As the Court explained, it is usually inappropriate to draw\n\n 9   inferences from congressional silence on sentencing practices because Congress has shown that,\n\n10   when it wants to, it knows how to direct levels of sentencing in express terms. Id. at 571 (citing\n\n11   28 U.S.C. § 994(h), which required Sentencing Commission to set Guidelines sentences for\n\n12   recidivist offenders at or near the statutory maximum). As a result, the fact that Congress\n\n13   increased the statutory maximum in 2001 for material support convictions that caused death, see\n\n14   Op. of J. Walker at [26–27], and did so without saying anything whatever about how a district\n\n15   court may treat harm when issuing a sentence that is less than the applicable maximum, cannot\n\n16   be read to diminish the discretion the district court otherwise has under § 3553(a).7\n\n17          I also rather doubt that we would be willing to apply consistently a principle that harm is\n\n18   irrelevant in terrorism cases. Consider two potential defendants, both of whom provide funds to\n\n19   different terrorists and have the requisite mens rea to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C §\n\n\n\n     7\n       Indeed, that Congress saw fit to increase the maximum sentence for material support based\n     solely on whether death results can easily be understood to suggest that Congress thought amount\n     of harm does matter in this context, even if, at times, that harm is largely fortuitous.\n\n\n                                                      8\n\f 1   2239A. In one case, the terrorist whom the defendant funds attempts to detonate an explosive in\n\n 2   a public place, but the explosives do not go off properly and so cause only a few injuries and one\n\n 3   death that results, in part also, from inadequate medical treatment. In the second case, the\n\n 4   terrorist’s detonation attempt succeeds, blowing up a city bus and causing a major traffic\n\n 5   collision that kills or injures hundreds of people. While reasonable minds might differ as to the\n\n 6   weight the level of harm should be given in this scenario, surely we would not hold it\n\n 7   procedurally unreasonable for the district court to take the amount of harm into account when\n\n 8   sentencing the respective defendants and—while sentencing the first severely—use it as a reason\n\n 9   to give the second defendant a much greater sentence. Yet if that is so, the converse must hold,\n\n10   because “sentencing discretion is like an elevator in that it must run in both directions.” Cavera,\n\n11   550 F.3d at 194. To concede, as I think we must, that when hundreds of people are injured or\n\n12   killed rather than just one a district court may take the amount of harm into account and impose a\n\n13   higher sentence, but then to deny the court that same discretion to reach a lower sentence when,\n\n14   through fortuity, no harm results, would manifestly contravene that principle.8\n\n15\n\n     8\n       I by no means suggest that a district court may not err by attributing too much importance to\n     results, whether on the upside or the downside. When reviewing a sentence for substantive\n     reasonableness, appellate courts may question whether the presence or absence of actual harm\n     can “bear the weight” attributed to it by a district court. Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191. And while an\n     appellate court must never forget that its review is deferential, see Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 596, it may\n     need to look carefully at a district court’s reasons for giving weight to results, especially given\n     the natural tendency to overvalue consequences. The majority opinion appropriately treats this\n     substantive question as analytically distinct from whether a district court may, as a procedural\n     matter, rely on lack of harm. See Maj. Op. at [99–100 n.33]. Like the majority opinion, I\n     express no view, at this time, as to whether the district court in this case placed too much weight\n     on the apparent lack of harm that resulted from Stewart’s actions. See Part II infra.\n\n\n\n                                                       9\n\f 1                                                     II.\n\n 2           I have focused to this point on factors the district court may consider procedurally when\n\n 3   sentencing, but this case also illustrates the importance of our adherence as an appellate court to\n\n 4   the right procedure for review of district court sentences. In Cavera, we explained that our\n\n 5   review involves a two-step process. We first ensure that the district court has not committed\n\n 6   procedural error, and only later engage in substantive review to examine whether the district\n\n 7   court has rendered a sentence that is one of the “exceptional cases where the trial court’s decision\n\n 8   cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.” 550 F.3d at 189 (internal\n\n 9   quotations and emphasis omitted). Following this sequence of review is central to our limited\n\n10   role. Because district courts “have an institutional advantage over appellate courts” when\n\n11   making sentencing decisions, Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98 (1996), our job as a\n\n12   reviewing court is mainly to ensure that a district court’s sentence “resulted from the district\n\n13   court’s considered judgment as to what was necessary to address the various, often conflicting,\n\n14   purposes of sentencing.” Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189–90. Evaluating the substantive\n\n15   reasonableness of a sentence before we have found it free from procedural defect risks the\n\n16   substitution of our “considered judgment” for that of the district court.\n\n17           When we identify procedural error, we have recognized the desirability of remanding to\n\n18   the district court to let it correct its mistake and “exercise its discretion anew,” rather than\n\n19   proceeding prematurely to review the sentence for substantive reasonableness. See Cavera, 550\n\n20   F.3d at 190. While we have not held that this course must necessarily be followed in all\n\n21   instances, a review of our cases makes clear that it is the ordinary and much preferred remedy.\n\n22   See, e.g., United States v. Williams, 558 F.3d 166, 176 (2d Cir. 2009) (“In light of our decision to\n\n\n                                                       10\n\f 1   remand, we reject, as premature, [the defendant’s] challenge to the substantive reasonability of\n\n 2   his sentence.”); United States v. Williams, 524 F.3d 209, 215–17 (2d Cir. 2008) (vacating\n\n 3   sentence without reaching issue of whether sentence was substantively reasonable “because we\n\n 4   conclude that the district judge committed procedural error”); United States v. Wills, 476 F.3d\n\n 5   103, 111 n.6 (2d Cir. 2007) (“Because we hold that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable,\n\n 6   we do not reach the government’s argument that if [the district court had not relied on\n\n 7   procedurally erroneous factors,] [Defendant’s] sentence should be deemed unreasonable based on\n\n 8   its length alone.”) (emphasis added), abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at\n\n 9   574–75, as recognized in Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191.\n\n10          Other circuits have expressed a similar preference, and have sometimes stated it in even\n\n11   more categorical terms: first remand to allow a district court to correct procedural errors and only\n\n12   later review for substantive reasonableness.9 This is no formalism. It is consonant with our\n\n13   system of sentencing, which asks the district court to reach a complete judgment about the\n\n14   appropriate sentence in light of the factors enumerated in § 3553(a). Procedural errors prevent\n\n15   the district court from properly arriving at such a holistic judgment. And in light of our\n\n16   obligation to defer significantly to a procedurally correct sentence, we should almost always wait\n\n17   until we have such a sentence to review before evaluating overall reasonableness.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       See, e.g., United States v. Delgado-Martinez, 564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that\n     where procedural error is identified, “we must remand” unless error is harmless, and that a court\n     should not move on to Gall’s second step to review substantive reasonableness of sentence if\n     there is non-harmless procedural error); United States v. Grissom, 525 F.3d 691, 696 (9th Cir.\n     2008) (“[W]e will remand non-harmless procedural errors . . . and only proceed to review the\n     substantive reasonableness of procedurally sound sentences.”) (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                                     11\n\f 1          Judge Walker argues that judicial efficiency compels us to identify substantive error at\n\n 2   the same time we remand for procedural error. No one wants unnecessary appeals. But I fail to\n\n 3   see any systemic advantages from issuing advisory opinions on the reasonableness of sentences\n\n 4   that we are vacating, and hence that are now no longer really before us. The decision to remand\n\n 5   for procedural unreasonableness presupposes that we believe the district court might not have\n\n 6   imposed the same sentence but for the procedural defect. See, e.g., United States v. Jass, 569\n\n 7   F.3d 47, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (recognizing that procedural errors in sentencing are subject to\n\n 8   harmless error rule). When we remand for procedural flaws, it may seem inviting to comment at\n\n 9   the same time on other factors relied upon by the district court that, though procedurally proper,\n\n10   do not, in our judgment, bear the weight the district court attributed to them. But it is not our\n\n11   role to weigh the individual § 3553(a) factors ourselves and to give advice to the district court as\n\n12   to our views. See Gall, 128 S. Ct. At 602.\n\n13          Let me repeat: Substantive reasonableness calls for review of the overall sentence, not\n\n14   individual factors. And § 3553(a) calls for balancing all the relevant factors. As a result, any\n\n15   non-harmless procedural errors necessarily affect the sentencing calculus. Our task is to evaluate\n\n16   (deferentially) the district court’s finished product, and not to grade its individual ingredients. To\n\n17   do this properly, we must almost always wait for the district court to correct the procedural errors\n\n18   that we have identified and to explain its sentence, and only then to consider the substantive\n\n19   reasonableness of the sentence.\n\n20          I do not mean to suggest an absolutist view on this matter. It may be that there are cases\n\n21   where there is procedural error that—even though it is not harmless—is sufficiently separate\n\n22   from any serious substantive concerns that we have, so as to make it plausible to address the two\n\n\n                                                      12\n\f 1   issues at once. I cannot think of any such cases offhand, however. And, for the reasons well\n\n 2   expressed by the majority opinion, this case is not one of them.\n\n 3                                                     III.\n\n 4           Another, perhaps uncomfortable, issue deserves discussion. Stewart does not appear to\n\n 5   have been the only member of Abdel Rahman’s legal team both to agree to abide by the SAMs\n\n 6   imposed upon Rahman and then subsequently to violate them. One of Rahman’s lawyers,\n\n 7   Abdeen Jabara, read to Rahman newspaper articles and letters from followers, while another,\n\n 8   Ramsey Clark, the former Attorney General of the United States, acknowledged issuing a\n\n 9   statement to the media on behalf of Rahman.10 Yet neither Jabara nor Clark was prosecuted for\n\n10   these apparent violations. This does not mean that the Government’s decision to prosecute only\n\n11   Stewart was invidious or improper, and I join the majority opinion in rejecting Stewart’s claim of\n\n12   selective prosecution. But though Stewart’s selective prosecution challenge fails, it does not\n\n13   follow that the alleged misconduct of Jabara and Clark—whom the district court may well have\n\n14   decided shared in certain respects the culpable behavior for which Stewart was convicted—is\n\n15   entirely irrelevant to Stewart and to her sentence. I think it possible that it is relevant, and I\n\n16   believe that usually only the district court is positioned to evaluate that relevance.\n\n17           As to claims of selective prosecution, we have properly recognized that our scope of\n\n18   review is limited, for “the decision as to whether to prosecute generally rests within the broad\n\n19   discretion of the prosecutor.” United States v. Alameh, 341 F.3d 167, 173 (2d Cir. 2003). As the\n\n\n\n     10\n       See Letter in Support of Lynne Stewart from Abdeen M. Jabara to Judge Koeltl (June 28,\n     2006), and Letter in Support of Lynne Stewart from Ramsey Clark to Judge Koeltl (Oct. 2,\n     2006), available in J. App. at 2211, 2334.\n\n\n                                                       13\n\f 1   Supreme Court has explained, this is because “the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited\n\n 2   to judicial review.” Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985). Yet this does not mean\n\n 3   that unfettered (even when it is non-invidious) prosecutorial discretion over who gets charged,\n\n 4   and for what, is categorically desirable. Quite the contrary: while prosecutorial discretion may be\n\n 5   salutary in a wide variety of cases, when left entirely without any controls it will concentrate too\n\n 6   much power in a single set of government actors, and they, moreover, may on occasion be\n\n 7   subject to political pressure. The result may well be to produce disparities in the way similarly\n\n 8   situated people are treated, disparities that our complex, Guidelines-with-district-court-\n\n 9   discretion, system has sought to minimize. The district court’s exercise of its sentencing\n\n10   discretion may provide the only effective way to control and diminish unjustified disparities,\n\n11   without operating in the blunt fashion of selective prosecution judicial review. It may reduce\n\n12   improper differences in treatment, without impinging on the executive’s obligation to enforce the\n\n13   law.\n\n14          Our case law provides support for this approach. For instance, while we have not\n\n15   required a district court to consider sentencing disparities among co-defendants, we have held\n\n16   that district courts are permitted to do so. As we explained, it is “appropriate for a district court,\n\n17   relying on its unique knowledge of the totality of circumstances of a crime and its participants, to\n\n18   impose a sentence that would better reflect the extent to which the participants in a crime are\n\n19   similarly (or dissimilarly) situated and tailor the sentences accordingly.” Wills, 476 F.3d at 110\n\n20   (internal emphasis omitted). This, as has been recognized, allows district courts to provide a\n\n21   check against certain otherwise unbounded prosecutorial decisions, as to what charges to bring\n\n\n\n\n                                                       14\n\f 1   and as to whether to make substantial assistance motions with respect to only some defendants.11\n\n 2   It is not much of an extension to permit the district courts to exercise analogous supervision over\n\n 3   those decisions as to which prosecutors enjoy the greatest discretion and that result in the greatest\n\n 4   disparities: the decisions on whether to bring any charges at all.\n\n 5          There are, of course, many reasons for prosecutors to fail to bring charges or to bring\n\n 6   lesser charges than they could have, and some of these reasons are clearly irrelevant to the proper\n\n 7   sentence of the person who has been charged and convicted. But other reasons may be relevant\n\n 8   because they may suggest arbitrariness and can lead to abuse—such as the political clout of some\n\n 9   potential defendants as against others. We as appellate judges are ill-suited to distinguish\n\n10   between relevant and irrelevant reasons in any given case. The same cannot be said, however,\n\n11   for a district court judge who has presided over a whole trial in which the behavior of uncharged\n\n12   or undercharged parties was part and parcel of the discussion.\n\n13          This does not mean that when a district court issues a sentence that it should articulate its\n\n14   reliance on the prosecution’s decision not to charge (or to undercharge) other parties. I am not\n\n15   sure. While we generally ask a district court to explain the reasons behind its sentence, and\n\n\n     11\n       See KATE STITH & JOSÉ A. CABRANES, FEAR OF JUDGING : SENTENCING GUIDELINES IN THE\n     FEDERAL COURTS 140–42 (1998) (articulating concern, pre-Booker, that “exercise of broad\n     prosecutorial authority over sentencing within a system that severely limits the sentencing\n     discretion of federal judges means that the power of prosecutors is not subject to the traditional\n     checks and balances that help prevent abuse of that power”and advocating system where judges\n     have the “countervailing discretionary authority to restrain prosecutorial power”) (emphasis in\n     original); Ryan Scott Reynolds, Note, Equal Justice under the Law: Post-Booker, Should\n     Federal Judges Be Able to Depart from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to Remedy Disparity\n     Between Codefendant’s Sentences?, 109 COLUM . L. REV . 538, 564–66 (2009) (contending that\n     the emerging rule among circuit courts that allows district courts to consider co-defendant\n     disparity is desirable because it mitigates negative effects of excessive prosecutorial power over\n     sentencing).\n\n\n                                                      15\n\f 1   indeed indicated in Cavera that “a district court errs if it fails adequately to explain its chosen\n\n 2   sentence, and must include an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range,” 550\n\n 3   F.3d at 190 (internal quotations omitted), there are some things that are perhaps best left unsaid\n\n 4   by the district court, even though their potential relevance is apparent on the record.12 A\n\n 5   prosecutor’s decision to charge only some parties rather than others may be one of these things.\n\n 6   The district court might quite reasonably want to avoid impugning the reputation of parties who\n\n 7   have not been indicted or tried, and hence have not had the opportunity to assert innocence in\n\n 8   open court. But that does not mean that a judge who has presided over a full trial may not have\n\n 9   valid reasons to conclude that the failure to charge some potential co-defendants affects, under\n\n10   the § 3553 factors, the propriety of a sentence.13\n\n11          I am inclined to think that the district court should not be barred from considering the\n\n12   relevance of prosecutorial discretion in a particular case, and that our legal system should take\n\n13   advantage of the district court’s unique position to consider a defendant’s sentence “in its\n\n14   complete relevant context,” Wills, 476 F.3d at 110 (emphasis added). As appellate courts we\n\n15   should therefore also keep this issue in mind when we review a district court’s sentence, and\n\n16   recognize it as a further reason to defer to a district court’s sentencing judgments. In particular,\n\n17   though we may properly ask the district court to explain apparent sentencing anomalies among\n\n     12\n        Cf. Guido Calabresi, A COMMON LAW FOR THE AGE OF STATUTES 172–81 (1982) (discussing\n     tradeoffs between open recognition of a doctrine and greater opacity, where the latter might be\n     useful in preventing a doctrine’s abuse).\n     13\n       Significantly, our system of sentencing allows the district court to consider uncharged conduct\n     by the defendant so as to ensure that the sentence is based upon “the real conduct that underlies\n     the crime of conviction.” Booker, 543 U.S. at 250 (Remedial Op., Breyer, J.). One of the\n     principal reasons for this, as expressed by the Court, is to prevent prosecutors, when they make\n     charging decisions, from “exercis[ing] a power the Sentencing Act vested in judges.” Id. at 257.\n\n\n                                                       16\n\f 1   convicted defendants as both the majority opinion and the partial dissent do here, we should not\n\n 2   forget that there might be even greater disparities between a defendant and other individuals who\n\n 3   were not charged at all.14\n\n 4                                                     IV.\n\n 5           Finally, I would be remiss if I did not follow the majority opinion in observing the fact\n\n 6   that all of the acts for which Stewart was convicted occurred before the attacks of September 11,\n\n 7   2001, an event that illustrates in particularly excruciating fashion that results do matter to us. It\n\n 8   does not diminish the gravity of Stewart’s crimes to take judicial notice of their timing, and to\n\n 9   recognize that our attitudes about her conduct have inevitably been influenced by the tragedy of\n\n10   that day. To suggest otherwise, and to ignore that 9/11 has profoundly influenced our\n\n11   retrospective assessment of the culpability of certain actions related to terrorists and terrorist\n\n12   organizations, would be to ignore reality. As the majority opinion says, Stewart herself might\n\n     14\n        At footnote 20 post, Judge Walker describes as academic my discussion of the possible relation\n     between the sentence imposed on the defendant before us, and the absence of any charges\n     brought against the other lawyers originally involved in this case—lawyers, some of whose acts\n     could surely be described in language as powerful as that used by Judge Walker with respect to\n     the defendant’s misdeeds. Whatever may be said of my views, they are not academic. They\n     reflect instead the very practical consequences of: (a) the necessary absence of any judicial\n     control over prosecutorial decisions as to whom to charge, decisions which, as Judge Walker\n     rightly notes, are “exclusive and absolute” and “insulated from judicial review,” Op. of J. Walker\n     at [45 n.20]; (b) the inevitable tendency of human beings, and hence also of “prosecutors acting\n     in good faith,” id., to take easy rather than difficult (and possibly politically costly) actions. (It is\n     perhaps worth noting again in this regard that one of the uncharged lawyers in this case was\n     formerly the chief prosecutor of the United States, while the defendant is described by the district\n     court as having “represented the poor, the disadvantaged and the unpopular,” Sent’g Tr. 115); (c)\n     the fact that without “initiating [any] inquisitorial foray into the prosecutor’s office,” Op. of J.\n     Walker at [45 n.20], a district court can get a pretty good read on the likely relative behavior of\n     those involved in the complex set of actions that led to a particular trial, including those\n     participants not charged; and (d) that the district court is given by law the direct task of\n     determining what is “just punishment” and, in doing so, to “avoid unwarranted . . . disparities,”\n     18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n                                                        17\n\f1   well have viewed her actions differently after 9/11 when the dangerousness of terrorism became\n\n2   so palpable, so stark, and—most important— so proximate. See Maj. Op. at [119]. We must be\n\n3   careful then in judging Stewart based on lessons that we learned only after her—very\n\n4   serious—crimes were committed.15 In the end, this factor too is part of the district court’s\n\n5   obligation to consider “the nature and circumstances of the offense,” and to impose a sentence\n\n6   that “reflect[s] the seriousness of the offense” and “provide[s] just punishment.” See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n    3553(a)(1)–(2).\n\n\n\n\n    15\n      On various occasions Judge Walker, in his partial dissent, makes reference to much higher\n    sentences given by other federal courts to those who have aided terrorists, including in cases in\n    which no harm occurred. See Op. of J. Walker at [7 n.4, 27 n.13]. It is no small matter,\n    however, that the overwhelming majority of the cases Judge Walker cites involved post-9/11\n    actions by the defendants. See, e.g., United States v. Khan, 309 F. Supp.2d 789, 796 (E.D. Va.\n    2004) (describing activities of Randall Royer and co-defendants and indicating “[t]he indictment\n    alleges that . . . preparations culminated in [co-defendants and their co-conspirators] attending a\n    terrorist and jihad training camp after September 11, 2001, with the intent to proceed to\n    Afghanistan and fight for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda against United States troops”).\n            This is not the only difference between Stewart and the defendants sentenced for material\n    support crimes in the cases Judge Walker mentions—leaving aside one case, relied on by Judge\n    Walker, where the convictions were subsequently vacated on appeal. See United States v. Al-\n    Moayad, 545 F.3d 139 (2d Cir. 2008) (vacating convictions of Al-Moayad and his co-defendant\n    Mohsen Zayed due to serious evidentiary errors). Indeed, in one instance where the district court\n    imposed a 180-month sentence, the court explicitly found that, for a variety of reasons, the\n    defendant was not similarly situated to Stewart. See United States v. Aref, No.04-CR-402, 2007\n    WL 804814, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2007).\n\n                                                    18\n\f1    United States v. Stewart\n2    No. 06-5015-cr\n\n3    WALKER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n4          For two years, defendant Lynne Stewart, through artifice and\n\n5    deception, and despite sworn commitments to the contrary made to\n\n6    the government, carried out a criminal plan to transmit\n\n7    instructions from her imprisoned client, a terrorist leader, to\n\n8    his jihadist followers in the Middle East, including, ominously,\n\n9    his withdrawal of support for a fragile cease-fire in Egypt, an\n10   action that effectively sanctioned renewed terrorist attacks and\n\n11   indiscriminate loss of human life.         The district court termed\n\n12   these deliberate and horrific crimes of terrorism, for which the\n\n13   Sentencing Guidelines recommended 30 years imprisonment,\n\n14   “extraordinarily severe criminal conduct.”          And yet the district\n\n15   court imposed a breathtakingly low sentence of 2 1/3 years.\n\n16   Because the majority fails to recognize that this sentence\n\n17   trivializes Stewart’s extremely serious conduct with a “slap on\n\n18   the wrist” that is substantively unreasonable, and because the\n\n19   majority fails to appreciate the full extent of the district\n20   court’s numerous procedural errors,         I respectfully dissent.1\n\n21\n\n\n\n           1\n             I concur, however, in the majority’s opinion insofar as it upholds the\n     defendants’ convictions and directs the district court to resentence Stewart\n     on the basis that it procedurally erred by failing to account for Stewart’s\n     likely perjury and obstruction of justice in imposing a sentence. The\n     majority also has determined that, at resentencing, the district court must\n     consider “whether Stewart’s conduct as a lawyer triggers the special\n     skill/abuse of trust enhancement under the Guidelines, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3\n     (2000), and reconsider the extent to which Stewart’s status as a lawyer\n     affects the appropriate sentence,” Maj. Op. at [124], but declined to find the\n     district court’s failure in this regard to be a procedural error. For reasons\n     I set forth, this failure was one, among several, procedural errors that the\n     majority failed to recognize.\n\f1           In imposing Stewart’s comparably insignificant sentence, the\n\n2    district judge rejected entirely a major enhancement, established\n\n3    by the Sentencing Commission under Congress’ express command,\n\n4    that applies generally to the “material support” of terrorism.\n\n5    Despite finding that Stewart’s crimes were within the\n\n6    enhancement’s “heartland,” Sent’g Tr. 108, the district court\n\n7    found that the “atypicality” of Stewart’s “material support”\n\n8    conduct in “provi[ding] a co-conspirator to a terrorist\n\n9    conspiracy” justified discarding the enhancement.    Sent’g Tr.\n10   113.   But, wholly apart from the fact that the provision of\n\n11   “personnel” falls squarely within the definition of “material\n\n12   support” provided in 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b), it trivializes\n\n13   Stewart’s conduct to even suggest that enabling a jailed\n\n14   terrorist leader, with enormous sway over his jihadist followers,\n\n15   to actively conspire with others in a scheme to kidnap and kill\n\n16   innocent people somehow mitigates the gravity of the crime.    The\n\n17   district court also based its rejection of the enhancement on the\n\n18   fact that Stewart’s conduct did not result in actual injuries or\n19   death, even though that fact is rarely, if ever, a mitigating\n\n20   circumstance, much less a reason to jettison the terrorism\n\n21   enhancement altogether.\n\n22          In addition to failing to make required findings on\n\n23   obstruction of justice based on evidence of Stewart’s double\n\n24   perjury at trial, as the majority recognizes, Maj. Op. at [122-\n\n25   124], the district court also all but ignored Stewart’s gross\n\n26   abuse of the fiduciary trust placed in her by the United States\n\n                                       2\n\f1    government, and, in the face of contrary policy statements by the\n\n2    Sentencing Commission, gave unjustified controlling weight to its\n\n3    mitigating view of Stewart’s age, health, and previous career.\n\n4    Numerous additional errors attended the radical reduction of\n\n5    Stewart’s sentence from the recommended 30 years to 2 1/3 years.\n\n6         Section 3553(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code, which\n\n7    governed Stewart’s sentence, requires that every sentence take\n\n8    into appropriate account “the nature and circumstances of the\n\n9    offense[,] and the history and characteristics of the defendant”;\n10   “reflect the seriousness of the offense”; “promote respect for\n\n11   the law”; and “adequate[ly] deter[]” similar conduct in the\n\n12   future.   18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1)-(2).      The statute also mandates\n\n13   consideration of “the need to avoid unwarr1anted sentenc[ing]\n\n14   disparities.”   Id. § 3553(a)(6).       Recognition of the full scope\n\n15   of the district court’s procedural errors makes plain that\n\n16   Stewart’s sentence fails to respect these goals and is so\n\n17   extraordinarily lenient as to manifest an abuse of discretion\n\n18   resulting in a substantively unreasonable sentence.\n19        The majority appropriately acknowledges the fine reputation\n\n20   of the district court judge, a point with which I concur.       And,\n\n21   like the majority, I commend the district court’s management of\n\n22   this complex and difficult trial.       However, the majority goes on\n\n23   to suggest, with Judge Calabresi’s concurrence being quite\n\n24   explicit, that because of the district court’s reputation, our\n\n25   review of the Stewart sentencing should be more deferential than\n\n26   would normally be the case.   This court has never recognized two\n\n\n                                         3\n\f1    classes of judges – those who are so good that their judgment is\n\n2    beyond reproach, and all the rest.   Indeed, no judge on any\n\n3    federal court, including the Supreme Court, can lay claim to\n\n4    infallibility.   Great respect for a particular judge cannot be a\n\n5    basis for overlooking what, in my view, amounts to a distortion\n\n6    of our sentencing laws.   For the foregoing reasons, and others\n\n7    that I will describe, Stewart’s sentence must be vacated and she\n\n8    must be resentenced.\n9    I. The Defendants’ Exceptionally Serious Criminal Conduct\n\n10        Sheik Abdel Rahman, Stewart’s client, is a dedicated\n\n11   terrorist leader with a large jihadist following in the Middle\n\n12   East, known as the “Islamic Group” among other names, Maj. Op. at\n\n13   [10], and a more discrete following in the United States.    See\n\n14   United States v. Rahman, 189 F.3d 88, 104-05 (2d Cir. 1999) (per\n\n15   curiam).   Abdel Rahman was locked up in federal prison in\n\n16   Rochester, Minnesota, to serve a life sentence imposed in 1996,\n\n17   after he was convicted for both (1) trying to wreak havoc in New\n\n18   York City by blowing up bridges, tunnels, and buildings, and (2)\n19   attempting to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.    See\n\n20   id. at 148.\n\n21        For two years, 2000 and 2001, the defendants in this case —\n\n22   Sattar, another jihadist with direct links back to Abdel Rahman’s\n\n23   Egyptian followers; Stewart, Abdel Rahman’s lawyer; and Yousry,\n\n24   Stewart’s student interpreter — made sure that Abdel Rahman could\n\n25   continue to communicate with his jihadist cohorts.   The\n\n26   Department of Justice had employed “Special Administrative\n\n                                      4\n\f1    Measures” (SAMs) specifically designed to prevent such\n\n2    communications while still enabling an imprisoned terrorist to\n\n3    speak to, and be effectively represented by his attorney.\n\n4    Compliance with the SAMs system largely depends upon the trust\n\n5    placed in the attorney.       In accordance with the SAMs, Stewart,\n\n6    repeatedly swore under oath that she would not transmit any non-\n\n7    legal communications to or from Abdel Rahman.           She swore falsely.\n\n8    Undeterred by the SAMs, Stewart, assisted by Yousry, executed a\n\n9    scheme of lies and deception against the government to keep the\n10   lines of communication open between Abdel Rahman and Sattar, and,\n\n11   through Sattar, the Egyptian jihadists.          These communications\n\n12   included a declaration by Abdel Rahman that he was withdrawing\n\n13   his support for a tenuous cease-fire that, for some time, had\n\n14   aimed at curbing violent attacks by Abdel Rahman’s followers upon\n\n15   targets in Egypt.2     Stewart even went so far as to deliver this\n\n16   statement to an Arab journalist on Abdel Rahman’s behalf, which\n\n17   resulted in the message’s wide dissemination through the media in\n\n18   the Middle East.\n19         The federal crimes committed by the defendants are numerous.\n\n20   All three conspired to defraud the United States, in violation of\n\n21   18 U.S.C. § 371.     Rahman, Sattar, and other jihadists conspired\n\n22   to kill and to kidnap persons in a foreign country, in violation\n\n23   of 18 U.S.C. § 956(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), and solicited crimes of\n\n\n\n           2\n             The cease-fire’s fragility is evident from its inability to stop an\n     Islamic Group faction from slaughtering sixty tourists in Luxor, Egypt in\n     1997. See Douglas Jehl, 70 Die in Attack at Egypt Temple, N.Y. Times, Nov.\n     18, 1997, at A1.\n\n                                           5\n\f1    violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 373.   Stewart and Yousry,\n\n2    both individually and in conspiracy, provided and concealed\n\n3    material support to terrorist activity — namely Rahman’s and\n\n4    Sattar’s conspiracy to kill and to kidnap — in violation of 18\n\n5    U.S.C. §§ 371, 2339A.   Additionally, Stewart made multiple false\n\n6    statements to the Department of Justice and to the Bureau of\n\n7    Prisons, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.   Such behavior\n\n8    constitutes extraordinarily serious, indeed horrendous, criminal\n\n9    conduct; that there was no evidence that her conduct ultimately\n10   resulted in death and injury to innocent people was due to law\n\n11   enforcement’s diligence, and not to any lack of effort by the\n\n12   defendants or their confederates.\n\n13        For such crimes, the advisory Sentencing Guidelines\n\n14   effective on November 1, 2000, applicable here, provided for\n\n15   lengthy sentences:   life imprisonment for Sattar, 360 months\n\n16   imprisonment for Stewart, and 78 to 97 months imprisonment for\n\n17   Yousry.   A Guidelines recommendation, of course, is just that — a\n\n18   recommendation — and a district judge has considerable discretion\n19   to sentence outside of the Guidelines.   See Gall v. United\n\n20   States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 594 (2007).   The district court sentenced\n\n21   the defendants well below the recommended Guidelines ranges,\n\n22   lowering Sattar’s sentence from a recommended life term to 24\n\n23   years, Yousry’s sentence from 78 months to 20 months, and\n\n24   Stewart’s sentence from 360 months to a mere 28 months.\n\n25        What is immediately striking about Stewart’s sentence is not\n\n26   simply its extraordinary 92 percent reduction from the\n\n\n                                      6\n\f1    recommended Guidelines range,3 but also the fact that the actual\n\n2    term of incarceration imposed — 2 1/3 years — is unprecedented in\n\n3    convictions for material support of terrorism.4           The Supreme\n\n4    Court has made clear that the Guidelines provide “the starting\n\n5    point and the initial benchmark” for sentencing, and that\n\n6    district judges must “remain cognizant of them” throughout the\n\n\n\n           3\n 1           In Gall, the Supreme Court instructed appellate courts not to use, as\n 2   a general matter, “the percentage of a departure [from the Guidelines] as the\n 3   standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a\n 4   specific sentence.” 128 S. Ct. at 595. This proscription recognizes that\n 5   percentages cannot speak reliably across the Guidelines ranges. See id. (“The\n 6   mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application.”). For\n 7   low Guidelines ranges, even small sentencing variances can yield large\n 8   percentages, unfairly exaggerating a district court’s action in imposing a\n 9   non-Guidelines sentence. Id. For high Guidelines ranges, major variances can\n10   yield relatively modest percentages, inaccurately representing the\n11   significance of the district court’s action. That percentages cannot always\n12   accurately measure a variance’s significance does not, however, mean that\n13   percentages are always irrelevant. When, as here, a variance from the\n14   recommended Guidelines range is extraordinarily large both in terms of the\n15   actual reduction of time to be served (a 232-month reduction) and the\n16   percentage of the reduction (92 percent), these facts taken together strongly\n17   signal the need for careful review of the justifications advanced for the\n18   challenged sentence. See id. at 597 (observing that appellate courts may\n19   reasonably expect a “major departure” from the Guidelines sentencing range to\n20   be supported “by a more significant justification than a minor one”).\n\n           4\n 1           In material support convictions after the Guidelines were deemed\n 2   advisory in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245 (2005), district courts\n 3   have generally imposed sentences of at least ten years per material support\n 4   count, with considerably higher total sentences. See, e.g., United States v.\n 5   Aref, No. 04-CR-402, 2007 WL 804814, at *8 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2007) (total\n 6   sentences of 15 years for each of two defendants, with 15 years on each of 16\n 7   material support (MS) counts); United States v. Paracha, No. 03-CR-1197,\n 8   Docket Entry No. 88 (S.D.N.Y. July 21, 2006) (total of 30 years, with 15 years\n 9   on each of 2 MS counts); United States v. Ali, No. 05-CR-53, Docket Entry No.\n10   397 (E.D. Va. Apr. 17, 2006) (total of 30 years, with 10 years on each of 4 MS\n11   counts); United States v. al-Moayad, No. 03-CR-1322, Docket Entry Nos. 197,\n12   205 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2005) (total of 75 years, with 15 years on each of 5\n13   MS counts for first defendant; total of 45 years, with 15 years on each of 3\n14   MS counts for second defendant), rev’d on other grounds, 545 F.3d 139 (2d Cir.\n15   2008); United States v. Lakhani, No. 03-CR-880, Docket Entry No. 99 (D.N.J.\n16   Sept. 12, 2005) (total of 47 years, with 15 years on one MS count); United\n17   States v.

July 29 2005) (total\n20   of 10 years for each of two defendants, with 10 years on each of 2 MS counts;\n21   total of 97 months for third defendant, with 97 months on 1 MS count). Most\n22   of these courts chose the maximum material support sentence available to them\n23   under federal law: fifteen years. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2339A(a), 2339B(a)(1).\n\n                                           7\n\f1    sentencing process.   Id. at 596, 597 n.6; accord United States v.\n\n2    Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc).   When faced\n\n3    with an “unusually lenient” sentence such as Stewart’s, we must\n\n4    ensure that the district judge has offered “sufficient\n\n5    justifications” to support his conclusion that the sentence is\n\n6    appropriate.   Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 594.   Despite the significant\n\n7    discretion accorded to district judges, we retain a limited but\n\n8    important reviewing function:    We must review sentences for both\n\n9    procedural and substantive reasonableness.\n10   II.   Relevant Legal Standards\n\n11         Our review proceeds under a “deferential abuse-of-discretion\n\n12   standard,” Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 591, and “a district court’s\n\n13   decision to vary from the Guidelines ‘may attract greatest\n\n14   respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case [to be]\n\n15   outside the “heartland” to which the Commission intends\n\n16   individual Guidelines to apply,’” Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192\n\n17   (quoting Kimbrough v.

However, “closer review may be in order when the\n19   sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the\n\n20   judge’s view that the Guidelines range fails properly to reflect\n\n21   § 3553(a) considerations even in a mine-run case.”    Kimbrough,\n\n22   128 S.

The basic contours of our role are as\n\n24   follows.\n\n25         To evaluate procedural reasonableness, we must ensure that\n\n26   the district court, in imposing a sentence, followed the\n\n\n                                       8\n\f1   procedural steps prescribed by law.          Procedural reasonableness\n\n2   “requires that we be confident that the sentence resulted from\n\n3   the district court’s considered judgment as to what was necessary\n\n4   to address the various, often conflicting, purposes of\n\n5   sentencing.”      Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189-90.         Thus, a district court\n\n6   commits procedural error when it fails to calculate or\n\n7   incorrectly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the\n\n8   Guidelines as mandatory, neglects to consider the factors set\n\n9   forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),5 or bases its sentence on a clearly\n\n\n         5\n             Section § 3553(a) states in relevant part:\n\n                 The [district] court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not\n                 greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in\n                 paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining the\n                 particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider—\n\n                 (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history\n                 and characteristics of the defendant;\n\n                 (2) the need for the sentence imposed—\n\n                       (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\n                       respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the\n                       offense;\n\n                       (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n\n                       (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the\n                       defendant; and\n\n                       (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or\n                       vocational training, medical care, or other correctional\n                       treatment in the most effective manner;\n\n                 (3) the kinds of sentences available;\n\n                 (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established\n                 for—\n\n                       (A) the applicable category of offense committed by the\n                       applicable category of defendant as set forth in the\n                       guidelines—\n\n                             ...\n\n                 (5) any pertinent policy statement—\n\n                       (A) issued by the Sentencing Commission . . . .\n\n                                           9\n\f1    erroneous factual finding.        See id. at 190.      To avoid procedural\n\n2    error, a district court must also “adequately . . . explain its\n\n3    chosen sentence,” including the reasons that the sentence should\n\n4    be different (in this case, extraordinarily different) from that\n\n5    recommended by the Guidelines, id., in order “to allow for\n\n6    meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair\n\n7    sentencing,” Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597.\n\n8         We do not categorically proscribe any factor “concerning the\n\n9    [defendant’s] background, character, and conduct,” with the\n10   exception of invidious factors.         18 U.S.C. § 3661; see also\n\n11   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190-91; United States v. Kaba, 480 F.3d 152,\n\n12   156-57 (2d Cir. 2007).       Still, while a district court may “take\n\n13   into account any information known to it,” United States v.\n\n14   Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 387 (2d Cir. 1992), it does not possess\n\n15   “a blank check to impose whatever sentences suit [its] fancy,”\n\n16   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191 (quoting United States v. Jones, 531 F.3d\n\n17   163, 174 (2d Cir. 2008)).        And a district court, despite its\n\n18   discretion, cannot ignore any of the § 3553(a) factors; it must\n19   consider them all, Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 596, including the\n\n20   relevant Guidelines range and “any pertinent Sentencing\n\n21   Commission policy statement,” Cavera, 550 F.3d at 188-89.              See\n\n22   also 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4)-(5). As we stated in United States v.\n\n23   Fernandez:\n\n\n                  (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among\n                  defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n                  similar conduct; and\n\n                  (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\n\n                                           10\n\f1         As long as the judge is aware of both the statutory requirements and\n2         the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable, and\n3         nothing in the record indicates misunderstanding about such\n4         materials or misperception about their relevance, we will accept\n5         that the requisite consideration [of the § 3553(a) factors] has\n6         occurred.\n7\n8    443 F.3d 19, 29-30 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v.\n\n9    Fleming, 397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2005) (emphasis from Fernandez\n\n10   omitted)).   However, if the district court has “ignored or\n\n11   slighted a factor that Congress has deemed pertinent” in §\n\n12   3553(a), it has abused its discretion.          United States v. Taylor,\n\n13   487 U.S. 326, 337 (1988); Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 607 (Alito, J.,\n\n14   dissenting); see also id. at 596 (majority opinion) (directing\n\n15   district courts to “consider all of the § 3553(a) factors”\n\n16   (emphasis added)).\n\n17        In performing substantive reasonableness review, we must\n\n18   determine whether the district court’s sentence is “located\n\n19   within the range of permissible decisions.”           Cavera, 550 F.3d at\n\n20   191 (internal quotation marks omitted).          “[W]e take into account\n\n21   the totality of the circumstances, giving due deference to the\n\n22   sentencing judge’s exercise of discretion, and bearing in mind\n\n23   the institutional advantages of district courts.”            Id. at 190.\n24   But we must accept that such discretion is not boundless.              “In\n\n25   sentencing, as in other areas, district judges at times make\n\n26   mistakes that are substantive. . . . Circuit courts exist to\n\n27   correct such mistakes when they occur.”          Rita v. United\n\n28   States,551 U.S. 338, 354 (2007).          Because the § 3553(a) factors\n\n29   are to “guide sentencing,” the factors also “guide appellate\n\n30   courts . . . in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.”\n\n\n                                          11\n\f1    United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 261 (2005).    And because\n\n2    “it is fair to assume that [the Guidelines], insofar as\n\n3    practicable, reflect a rough approximation of sentences that\n\n4    might achieve § 3553(a)’s objectives,” Rita, 551 U.S. at 350, our\n\n5    judgment of a sentence’s substantive reasonableness must be\n\n6    informed by “the extent of any variance from the Guidelines\n\n7    range,” Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597.\n\n8         In light of a district court’s wide discretion in\n\n9    sentencing, we do not “presume that a non-Guidelines sentence is\n10   unreasonable.”   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190.   But when a district\n\n11   judge chooses to step away from the Guidelines, we “must consider\n\n12   the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is\n\n13   sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.”\n\n14   Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597; accord Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190.    There\n\n15   is no “rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a\n\n16   departure as the standard for determining the strength of the\n\n17   justifications required for a specific sentence.”    Gall, 128 S.\n\n18   Ct. at 595.   Rather, our focus on the degree of deviation is\n19   derived from the “uncontroversial” proposition “that a major\n\n20   departure should be supported by a more significant justification\n\n21   than a minor one.”   Id. at 597.    Whatever the justification, its\n\n22   persuasive power depends in large part on the quality of its\n\n23   reasoning.    Accordingly, in order to determine whether the\n\n24   sentencing court acted reasonably, we must examine how it reached\n\n25   its conclusions, and determine how persuasive its stated reasons\n\n26   are in supporting its exercise of discretion.    See id. at 600-02.\n\n\n                                        12\n\f1    If the district judge’s reasoning is sound, “we will not second\n\n2    guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the judge accorded to a\n\n3    given [§ 3553(a)] factor . . . . as long as the sentence\n\n4    ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the\n\n5    circumstances presented.”       Fernandez, 443 F.3d at 32, 34\n\n6    (emphasis added).     We have noted, however, that “unjustified\n\n7    reliance upon any one factor is a symptom of an unreasonable\n\n8    sentence,” United States v. Rattoballi, 452 F.3d 127, 137 (2d\n\n9    Cir. 2006), but only a symptom:        We must reach our decision by\n10   examining the reasoning of the district court in light of the\n\n11   totality of the circumstances, with due deference to the district\n\n12   court’s judgment.\n13   III. Stewart’s Sentence\n\n14   A. The District Court’s Findings and Conclusions\n\n15         In sentencing Stewart, the district court appropriately\n\n16   began by calculating her sentencing range under the Guidelines,\n\n17   and found it to be 360 months, the statutory maximum.6             Sent’g\n\n18   Tr. 112.    Over Stewart’s objection, the district court found that\n19   the Guidelines terrorism enhancement, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 (2000),\n\n20   applied because she had committed a “federal crime of terrorism.”\n\n21   Sent’g Tr. 107-08.      In light of the “ample evidence” showing that\n\n22   Stewart’s “actions were calculated to affect the conduct of the\n\n23   Egyptian government through intimidation and coercion,” the\n\n24   district judge held that her conduct “cannot be found to be\n\n\n           6\n             The district court calculated Stewart’s total Adjusted Offense Level\n     at 41 with a Criminal History Category of VI, yielding a Guidelines\n     “sentencing range” of the statutory maximum of 360 months of imprisonment.\n\n                                           13\n\f1    outside the heartland of the enhancement.”      Sent’g Tr. 108.     The\n\n2    district court acknowledged Stewart’s arguments that the\n\n3    enhancement did not apply, and that its effect on her Criminal\n\n4    History Category overstated the seriousness of her past conduct\n\n5    and the likelihood that she would commit further crimes.         Sent’g\n\n6    Tr. 108-09.    The district court, however, did not waver from its\n\n7    “heartland” determination, and chose to defer consideration of\n\n8    Stewart’s non-application and overstatement claims to its §\n\n9    3553(a) analysis, instead of determining whether they warranted\n10   departures within the Guidelines’ scheme.      Sent’g Tr. 109.\n\n11        The district court also declined to determine whether\n\n12   Stewart’s conduct warranted a Guidelines enhancement for her\n\n13   potential obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 (2000).\n\n14   The government had urged this enhancement based upon Stewart’s\n\n15   alleged double perjury at trial.      Sent’g Tr. 111.   The district\n\n16   court found “evidence to indicat[e] that [Stewart’s] statements\n\n17   were false.”   Sent’g Tr. 111.   The court nonetheless chose not to\n\n18   consider the enhancement’s applicability, on the basis that the\n19   Guidelines, because of the terrorism enhancement, already\n\n20   provided for the statutory maximum.      Sent’g Tr. 111.   The\n\n21   district court also noted that it believed a non-Guidelines\n\n22   sentence would be “most consistent with the [§ 3553(a)] factors.”\n\n23   Sent’g Tr. 111-12.\n\n24        Stewart sought several downward departures under the\n\n25   Guidelines.    First, she argued that she deserved a “lesser harms”\n\n26   departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5K2.11 (2000) because she\n\n\n                                      14\n\f1    committed her crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm.7\n\n2    Rejecting this argument, the district court found that “the\n\n3    circumstances of this case do not diminish society’s interest in\n\n4    punishing the conduct at issue,” and that “[t]his is not a case\n\n5    where the interest in punishment or deterrence is reduced.”\n\n6    Sent’g Tr. 109-10.      The district court also rejected Stewart’s\n\n7    request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.20 (2000),\n\n8    which applies to “aberrant behavior.”         The district court refused\n\n9    to grant this departure because Stewart’s conduct “was committed\n10   over an extended period of time, involved repeated acts of\n\n11   deception, and involve[d] significant planning.”            Sent’g Tr. 110.\n\n12   Finally, the district court stated that it would take into\n\n13   account Stewart’s requested departure for “extraordinary medical\n\n14   conditions,” pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4, when making its §\n\n15   3553(a) determination.\n\n16         Having found that the Guidelines called for Stewart to\n\n17   receive the statutory maximum of 360 months, the district court\n\n18   proceeded to its § 3553(a) analysis.         The district court cited\n\n\n\n           7\n             Specifically, Stewart claimed that her criminal conduct “was the\n     product of her perception that [Abdel Rahman’s] health and well-being were\n     seriously jeopardized by his continued imprisonment in the United States.”\n     Stewart Sent’g Br. 44-45. She explained at trial that it “was important for\n     [Abdel Rahman’s] frame of mind that he have sort of peace of mind about his\n     family, about people he had known when he was in the world, or the letters\n     that were usually sent to him.” Trial Tr. 7720-21. Stewart’s justification\n     for her conduct is patently absurd in light of evidence that her transmitted\n     messages related not to personal family matters but rather to plans to kidnap\n     and kill large numbers of innocent people, and to terrorize even more. The\n     fact that Stewart attempted to justify her potentially devastating criminal\n     conduct by citing her obligations to her client not only highlights her\n     eagerness to corrupt the role of defense counsel, but also casts serious doubt\n     on two of the district court’s purported mitigating factors: (1) the\n     unlikelihood that Stewart would provide material support to terrorism in the\n     future, and (2) the “public service” value of her work as a defense attorney.\n\n                                          15\n\f1    what it believed to be “numerous factors that argue in favor of a\n\n2    very substantial downward variance.”     Sent’g Tr. 113.   First, the\n\n3    district court noted that “this is an atypical case for the\n\n4    terrorism enhancement,” because “there are few, if any, cases\n\n5    where the thrust of the violation was the provision of a co-\n\n6    conspirator to a terrorist conspiracy.”     Sent’g Tr. 113.\n\n7    “Moreover,” the district court explained, “there is no evidence\n\n8    that any victim was in fact harmed as a result of the offense as\n\n9    charged . . . .”   Sent’g Tr. 113.     The district court also found\n10   the terrorism enhancement’s impact on Stewart’s Criminal History\n\n11   Category to be “dramatically unreasonable.”     Sent’g Tr. 113.\n\n12        The district court thus concluded that application of the\n\n13   full terrorism enhancement, “while correct under the guidelines,\n\n14   would result in an unreasonable result in this atypical case and\n\n15   produce a guideline range about quadruple the range without that\n\n16   enhancement.”   Sent’g Tr. 114.   Accordingly, the district court\n\n17   recalculated Stewart’s Guidelines range, now without the\n\n18   terrorism enhancement, to be 78 to 97 months imprisonment without\n19   the government’s requested obstruction enhancement, and 97 to 121\n\n20   months imprisonment with that enhancement.     Sent’g Tr. 114.    The\n\n21   district court then stated that these ranges did not “tak[e] into\n\n22   account the extraordinary personal characteristics of the\n\n23   defendant[,] which also argue strongly in favor of a substantial\n\n24   downward variance.”   Sent’g Tr. 114.\n\n25        Noting that “[t]he personal characteristics of the defendant\n\n26   are intertwined with several of the [§ 3553(a)] factors,” Sent’g\n\n\n                                       16\n\f1    Tr. 115, the district court then discussed at length Stewart’s\n\n2    age, health, and career.    The district court described Stewart’s\n\n3    career of “represent[ing] the poor, the disadvantaged[,] and the\n\n4    unpopular,” and concluded that it was “no exaggeration to say\n\n5    that Ms. Stewart performed a public service not only to her\n\n6    clients but to the nation.”    Sent’g Tr. 115-16.   Although\n\n7    acknowledging that, under the Guidelines, “prior good works are\n\n8    not ordinarily relevant” to a defendant’s sentence, the district\n\n9    court noted that even the Guidelines permitted “extraordinary\n10   contributions [to] take a defendant outside the Guidelines\n\n11   ra[n]ge.”    Sent’g Tr. 116.   Accordingly, the district court held\n\n12   that Stewart’s past work warranted a “substantial downward\n\n13   variance.”   Sent’g Tr. 116.\n\n14        The district court then explained that Stewart’s conviction\n\n15   would likely prevent her from ever practicing law again.       The\n\n16   court found that this “is itself a punishment,” and “means that\n\n17   the occasion for offenses will be removed and that a lengthy\n\n18   sentence of imprisonment would be an excessive one . . . for\n19   deterrence and protection of the public.”     Sent’g Tr. 116-17.\n\n20        The district court noted that Stewart was 67 years old,\n\n21   making “imprisonment . . . particularly difficult on her.”\n\n22   Sent’g Tr. 117.   And the court found Stewart’s history of\n\n23   overcoming cancer relevant, because she had a “statistically\n\n24   significant chance of recurrence” and “suffers from other medical\n\n25   conditions including sleep apnea.”     Sent’g Tr. 117.   The district\n\n26   court acknowledged that “[m]edical care can be delivered while in\n\n\n                                       17\n\f1    prison,” but found it “clear that prison will be particularly\n\n2    difficult for this defendant.”     Sent’g Tr. 117.\n\n3           Despite noting that “age and physical condition are\n\n4    discouraged factors under the guidelines,” the district court\n\n5    concluded that, “[b]ecause imprisonment will be particularly hard\n\n6    on the defendant, a lesser sentence than otherwise called for by\n\n7    the advisory guidelines would be sufficient to accomplish the\n\n8    goals of Section 3553(a)(2).”     Sent’g Tr. 117-18.   But the\n\n9    district court reiterated that there still was ”an irreduceable\n10   core of extraordinarily severe criminal conduct.”      Sent’g Tr.\n\n11   118.   The court “point[ed] out that the offenses of conviction\n\n12   were serious, involved dishonesty and breach of trust, and had\n\n13   potentially lethal consequences . . . .”     Sent’g Tr. 119.\n\n14   However, the district court felt that “the seriousness of the\n\n15   offense d[id] not wipe out the three decades of service and the\n\n16   other characteristics of the defendant and the particular effects\n\n17   of the sentence on this defendant.”     Sent’g Tr. 119.\n\n18   Accordingly, “[t]aking all of the [§ 3553(a)] factors into\n19   account,” the district court sentenced Stewart to 28 months of\n\n20   imprisonment.   Sent’g Tr. 120.\n\n21   B. The District Court’s Procedural and Analytical Errors\n\n22          The majority raises three issues concerning Stewart’s\n\n23   sentence:   (1) It does not understand why Stewart’s abuse of her\n\n24   position as a lawyer did not warrant a higher sentence, Maj. Op.\n\n25   at [120-121]; (2) it does not understand why Stewart’s sentence\n\n26   was only eight months longer than Yousry’s, despite her\n\n                                       18\n\f1    significantly more egregious conduct, Maj. Op. at [121-122]; and\n\n2    (3) it finds that the district court procedurally erred by\n\n3    ignoring Stewart’s potential perjury, which was relevant to her\n\n4    sentence under § 3553(a), Maj. Op. at [122-124].    Accordingly,\n\n5    the majority remands for resentencing, directing the district\n\n6    court to address the perjury issue, consider the abuse of trust\n\n7    enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, and resentence Stewart.    Maj.\n\n8    Op. at [124-125].\n\n9         Although I share the majority’s three concerns and its\n\n10   conclusion that resentencing is required, the district court made\n\n11   additional, and more serious, errors that the majority overlooks.\n\n12   Notably, because the district court’s stated reasons for\n\n13   effectively removing altogether the Guidelines’ terrorism\n\n14   enhancement from its sentencing consideration of the seriousness\n\n15   of the offense cannot, in fact, mitigate the seriousness of\n\n16   Stewart’s crime, I identify procedural error in the district\n\n17   court’s application of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).   This grave\n\n18   error in assessing the seriousness of Stewart’s crime, moreover,\n\n19   was compounded by the district court’s failure to account for two\n\n20   aggravating factors plainly relevant under the Guidelines:\n\n21   Stewart’s perjury, and her persistent and blatant abuse of a\n\n22   position of trust to commit her crime.   See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n23   3553(a)(4).   While the majority acknowledges these last two\n\n24   procedural errors, its failure to recognize the error that they\n\n25   compound minimizes the magnitude of the district court’s error in\n\n26   identifying the seriousness of Stewart’s criminal conduct —\n\n                                     19\n\f1    which, in turn, contributed to other errors.\n\n2         Without a reasonable assessment of the seriousness of\n\n3    Stewart’s crime, the district court could not reliably determine\n\n4    the sentence necessary to afford adequate general and specific\n\n5    deterrence for crimes of material support of terrorism.    See 18\n\n6    U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B).   The district court’s error in assessing\n\n7    the seriousness of Stewart’s crime further precluded a reliable\n\n8    determination of the sentence necessary to avoid unwarranted\n\n9    disparities with similarly situated criminals.    See 18 U.S.C. §\n10   3553(a)(6).\n\n11        Moreover, the district court’s error in assessing the\n\n12   seriousness of Stewart’s crime prompted it to accord Stewart’s\n\n13   age, health, and career mitigating weight that they cannot\n\n14   reasonably bear.   The totality of these procedural errors, all\n\n15   originating in a disturbing misunderstanding of the seriousness\n\n16   of Stewart’s conduct, contributed to a sentence that so\n\n17   trivializes the terrorism crimes of conviction as to present a\n\n18   rare occurrence in this court: a sentence that cannot be deemed\n19   to fall within the wide range of substantively reasonable choices\n\n20   available to a sentencing judge.     Cf. Jones, 531 F.3d at 174.\n\n21        1. Assessing the Seriousness of Stewart’s Crime as Required\n\n22        by § 3553(a)(2)(A)\n\n23             a. The Terrorism Enhancement\n\n24        In 1994, Congress’ expressly mandated that the Sentencing\n\n25   Commission provide for a terrorism enhancement to ensure that\n\n26   crimes of terrorism were met with a punishment that reflected\n\n\n                                     20\n\f1    their extraordinary seriousness.             See Violent Crime Control and\n\n2    Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, § 120004, 108 Stat.\n\n3    1796, 2022.       The Commission accordingly created an enhancement\n\n4    that operates both vertically, increasing the offense level to\n\n5    indicate the seriousness of the crime, and horizontally\n\n6    increasing the defendant’s Criminal History Category to reflect\n\n7    the need for deterrence, regardless of the defendant’s prior\n\n8    record. See U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 (2000).8            As the majority\n\n9    acknowledges, the Sentencing Commission “unambiguously cast a\n10   broad[] net” when drafting the terrorism enhancement.               Maj. Op.\n\n11   at [95] (quoting United States v. Mandhai, 375 F.3d 1243, 1247\n\n12   (11th Cir. 2004)).         The import of this enhancement “could not be\n\n13   clearer”:      It reflects Congress’ and the Commission’s policy\n\n14   judgment “that an act of terrorism represents a particularly\n\n15   grave threat because of the dangerousness of the crime and the\n\n16   difficulty of deterring and rehabilitating the criminal, and thus\n\n17   that terrorists and their supporters should be incapacitated for\n\n18   a longer period of time.”         United States v. Meskini, 319 F.3d 88,\n19   91-92 (2d Cir. 2003) (emphasis added).            Under the applicable\n\n20   Guidelines, the enhancement increases the Guidelines sentence for\n\n\n           8\n               The terrorism enhancement provides:\n\n                   (a) If the offense is a felony that involved, or was\n                   intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism, increase\n                   by 12 levels; but if the resulting offense level is less\n                   than level 32, increase to level 32.\n\n                   (b) In each such case, the defendant's criminal history\n                   category from Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal\n                   Livelihood) shall be Category VI.\n\n     U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 (2000).\n\n                                             21\n\f1    a terrorism crime to a minimum of 210 months or 17 1/2 years;\n\n2    particularly serious crimes, such as Stewart’s, have even higher\n\n3    sentences after the enhancement is applied.9\n\n4          Despite finding that Stewart’s crime fell within the\n\n5    terrorism enhancement’s “heartland,” in sentencing Stewart under\n\n6    § 3553(a), the district court jettisoned the enhancement\n\n7    wholesale — and from that lower platform, reduced her sentence\n\n8    considerably further.      Effectively, the district court sentenced\n\n9    Stewart as though she had committed no “federal crime of\n10   terrorism,” U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 (2000), at all, even though the jury\n\n11   and the district court itself had expressly found to the\n\n12   contrary.    I conclude that the district court manifestly abused\n\n13   its discretion in doing so.\n\n14         Whatever the merits of the district court’s disregard of the\n\n15   enhancement on the basis that it overstated Stewart’s criminal\n\n16   history, the district court’s complete elimination of the\n\n17   enhancement’s vertical component, which entirely wiped out the\n\n18   enhancement’s effect, cannot withstand scrutiny in light of the\n19   district court’s obligation to impose a sentence sufficient to\n\n20   reflect the seriousness of the crime of conviction.            The district\n\n21   court offered two rationales for ignoring the terrorism\n\n22   enhancement’s vertical effect when determining Stewart’s\n\n23   sentence:    the “atypical” nature of Stewart’s crime, and the lack\n\n24   of evidence of harm to victims.        Neither rationale is sustainable\n\n           9\n             As previously noted, the district court calculated the Guidelines\n     “sentencing range” to be the statutory maximum of 360 months of imprisonment.\n\n\n                                          22\n\f1    in this case.\n\n2         First, the district court stated that Stewart’s conviction\n\n3    was “an atypical case for the terrorism enhancement” despite\n\n4    concluding minutes earlier that Stewart’s conduct “cannot be\n\n5    found to be outside the heartland of the enhancement.”    Sent’g\n\n6    Tr. 108, 113.   The “atypical” heartland conduct, the district\n\n7    court added, was “the provision of a co-conspirator to a\n\n8    terrorist conspiracy.”    Sent’g Tr. 113.   The district court did\n\n9    not explain this conclusion, nor can the record support a\n\n10   reasonable explanation.   At the outset, I question the\n\n11   atypicality of this conduct as a mitigating factor.    Congress\n\n12   itself has made plain that giving material support, which is a\n\n13   crime of terrorism under the Guidelines, can be satisfied\n\n14   entirely by the provision of “personnel.”    See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n15   2339A(b) (including the provision of personnel in the definition\n\n16   of “material support”).   Indeed, it is absurd and therefore\n\n17   necessarily unreasonable to even suggest that enabling an\n\n18   incarcerated terrorist leader with enormous influence to actively\n19   conspire with others in a scheme to kidnap and kill innocent\n\n20   persons somehow mitigates the seriousness of the crime.\n\n21        Sheik Abdel Rahman was no ordinary “co-conspirator.”      He was\n\n22   the head of the snake, a spiritual leader of a violent terrorist\n\n23   group whose words carried the force of a holy writ among his\n\n24   followers, and a man serving a life term for conspiring to bring\n\n25   deadly chaos to New York City.   See Rahman, 189 F.3d at 103-11.\n\n26   After Abdel Rahman’s influence had been sapped by the\n\n                                      23\n\f1    incarceration and isolation attending his lawful conviction,\n\n2    Stewart’s crimes specifically targeted undoing this protection by\n\n3    successfully enabling Abdel Rahman, as the Islamic Group’s\n\n4    spiritual leader, to communicate with his followers and to\n\n5    support the renewal of bloodshed.      Abdel Rahman’s unique stature\n\n6    in the terrorist world surely renders Stewart’s crime “atypical,”\n\n7    but this atypicality is an aggravating factor, not a mitigating\n\n8    one, thereby making Stewart more culpable than a defendant\n\n9    engaged in more “typical” material support, such as providing\n10   money or a cache of firearms to a terrorist group.\n\n11        Although material support of terrorism may cover a\n\n12   “multitude of sins,” as Judge Calabresi’s concurrence states, Op.\n\n13   of J. Calabresi at [3], this observation does no work in\n\n14   justifying a district court’s complete disregard of the terrorism\n\n15   enhancement, particularly in this case.     The tie that binds each\n\n16   of the material support sins is that they promote terrorism.     The\n\n17   procedural concern in this case is not with where Stewart’s\n\n18   culpability falls on the spectrum: it is with whether she is\n19   placed on the terrorism spectrum at all.     Removing Stewart from\n\n20   the spectrum on account of the nature of her sins is particularly\n\n21   egregious given that Stewart’s conduct supported Abdel Rahman, a\n\n22   terrorist at the highest level.\n\n23        Beyond erroneously finding mitigating atypicality in\n\n24   “provi[ding] a co-conspirator to a terrorist conspiracy,” Sent’g\n\n25   Tr. 113, the district judge offered no further explanation of how\n\n26   or why Stewart’s “atypical” conduct should lessen Stewart’s\n\n                                       24\n\f1    culpability or contribute to the wholesale rejection of the\n\n2    terrorism enhancement, after he had found that conduct to be\n\n3    within the enhancement’s “heartland.”          As a result, we are left\n\n4    only with the district judge’s bare assertion of atypicality,\n\n5    which cannot reasonably support the complete rejection of the\n\n6    terrorism enhancement.       See Cavera, 550 F.3d at 193.\n\n7          The district court’s second rationale for disregarding the\n\n8    terrorism enhancement — the absence of evidence that Stewart’s\n\n9    terrorism crimes resulted in actual harm — is similarly flawed.10\n10   Several points must be made before explaining why this reasoning\n\n11   amounted to procedural error.        First, the absence of harm is in\n\n12   no sense attributable to Stewart.          Alaa Abdul Raziq Atia, the\n\n13   leader of the violent faction of the Islamic group, including\n\n14   Abdel Rahman, was located and killed by Egyptian authorities\n\n15   after the cease-fire was lifted but before he could act upon it.\n\n16   Second, the district court did not simply consider the absence of\n\n17   harm as a factor to lessen the effect of the terrorism\n\n18   enhancement; it used that fortuity to completely eliminate the\n19   effect of the terrorism enhancement, so that Stewart, in\n\n20   substance, was punished as if she had committed no crime of\n\n21   terrorism at all.      Third, the district court provided no reason,\n\n22   much less a persuasive one, for why the absence of death or\n\n23   injury should have this steep mitigating effect on Stewart’s\n\n24   sentence.\n\n\n           10\n              Because the district court’s flawed reliance on the absence of harm\n     in this case also infected Sattar’s and Yousry’s sentences, I would vacate\n     their sentences and remand for resentencing as to them as well.\n\n                                           25\n\f1            The majority, by its silence, endorses the district court’s\n\n2    deeply flawed reliance on the fortuity that Stewart’s crimes did\n\n3    not have the horrific consequences that she and Abdel Rahman\n\n4    intended.    In doing so, the majority fails to appreciate the\n\n5    unique nature of terrorism support crimes, and the enhancement\n\n6    punishment they warrant as envisioned by Congress.            Judge\n\n7    Calabresi’s concurrence mistakenly equates such crimes to\n\n8    ordinary crimes and attempts, and erroneously permits the\n\n9    district court to eliminate the enhancement altogether primarily\n10   because the intended destruction of innocent life did not come to\n\n11   pass.    Op. of J. Calabresi at [6].\n\n12           Congress and the Sentencing Commission plainly intended for\n\n13   crimes of terrorism to be fully punishable without regard to\n\n14   whether, due to events beyond the defendant’s control, the\n\n15   defendant’s conduct failed to achieve its intended deadly\n\n16   consequences.     Such intent is plain from the many criminal\n\n17   statutes and Guidelines unrelated to terrorism that specifically\n\n18   account for the level or absence of injury, while the material\n19   support statute and terrorism enhancement do not.11           Moreover,\n\n20   Congress amended Stewart’s statute of conviction in 2001 so that\n\n21   causing death increased the statutory maximum from 15 years to\n\n\n\n\n           11\n              See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2119 (varying maximum penalty for carjacking\n     based on injuries caused); U.S.S.G. § 2A1.5(c)(1) (2000) (increasing offense\n     level for conspiracy or solicitation to commit murder if the offense resulted\n     in the death of a victim); id. § 2A2.2(b)(3) (2000) (varying offense level for\n     aggravated assault based on the victim’s injuries).\n\n                                          26\n\f1    life imprisonment.12     Contrary to the suggestion in Judge\n\n2    Calabresi’s concurrence that the achievement of harm cannot be an\n\n3    aggravating factor unless the absence of such harm is a\n\n4    mitigating factor, Op. of J. Calabresi at [9], Congress has been\n\n5    unmistakably clear that, as a general matter, the achievement of\n\n6    actual harm may aggravate the seriousness of a terrorism crime\n\n7    but that the absence of such harm does not mitigate such a crime.\n\n8    Thus Judge Calabresi’s analogy to a two-way elevator is flawed in\n\n9    terrorism cases.\n\n10         There can be little doubt that Congress and the Commission\n\n11   expected the terrorism enhancement to reflect the seriousness of\n\n12   a material support crime regardless of the absence of injury.\n\n13   The district court’s decision to place substantial mitigating\n\n14   weight upon the absence of harm is thus so far contrary to the\n\n15   policy choices of Congress and the Commission that it cannot be\n\n16   deemed reasonable under § 3553(a)(1)(A) without persuasive\n\n17   explanation.    See Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct.558, 575\n\n18   (2007).\n19         Unremarkably, courts routinely, and unflinchingly, apply the\n\n20   terrorism enhancement in the absence of proven harm.13            Here, the\n\n           12\n             See Uniting and Strengthening America By Providing Appropriate Tools\n     Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, Pub. L.

Garey, 546\n     F.3d 1359, 1363 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam); United States v. Benkahla, 530\n     F.3d 300, 313 (4th Cir. 2008) (“Here, . . . the terrorism enhancement is doing\n     just what it ought to do: Punishing more harshly than other criminals those\n     whose wrongs served an end more terrible than other crimes.”); United States\n     v. Hale, 448 F.3d 971, 988 (7th Cir. 2006) (“That [the defendant] did not\n     commit a federal crime of terrorism is irrelevant; the district court found\n     the purpose of his soliciting [a co-conspirator] was to promote a federal\n\n                                          27\n\f1    Egyptian police caught and killed Alaa Abdul Raziq Atia, a\n\n2    violent co-conspirator, after Abdel Rahman and Stewart withdrew\n\n3    Rahman’s support for the cease-fire, but before Atia could act on\n\n4    that message.     This fortuity likely prevented Stewart’s crime\n\n5    from harming victims, but “[f]ortuity has no bearing on\n\n6    culpability,” United States v. Mitchell, 178 F.3d 904, 910 (7th\n\n7    Cir. 1999), nor does it mitigate to any degree the seriousness of\n\n8    Stewart’s conduct.14     Abdel Rahman himself was appropriately\n\n9    given a life sentence even though his plans to assassinate\n10   President Hosni Mubarak and to blow up bridges, tunnels, and\n\n11   buildings in New York City were frustrated.           See Rahman, 189 F.3d\n\n12   at 124-126.    There is no reason why fortuity should have enabled\n\n13   Stewart, Rahman’s supporter, enabler, and co-conspirator, to be\n\n14   sentenced as if no terrorism crimes had ever occurred.\n\n15         In finding the district court’s heavy reliance on the lack\n\n16   of proven harm to be reasonable, neither the majority’s opinion\n\n17   nor Judge Calabresi’s concurrence has case law support, and I\n\n18   have found none.     Judge Calabresi is reduced to observing that\n19   attempted crimes are sometimes treated differently from completed\n\n\n     crime of terrorism . . . .” (emphasis in original)). In footnote 6 of his\n     concurrence, Judge Calabresi correctly points out that Garey resulted in a\n     downward variance from the Guidelines. Op. of J. Calabresi at [7 n.6]. But\n     the district court did not reject the terrorism enhancement altogether in its\n     § 3553 calculus as here. In applying a somewhat reduced enhancement – even\n     for that mentally ill defendant who’s crime was telephoning threats to a\n     shopping mall - it imposed a 30 year prison sentence.\n\n           14\n              Cf. United States v. Simpson, 538 F.3d 459, 464 (6th Cir. 2008) (“It\n     cannot be . . . that a crime [of insurance fraud] spanning several years . . .\n     is not very serious merely because none of the employer’s workers happened to\n     get hurt.”); United States v. Butler, 970 F.2d 1017, 1030 (2d Cir. 1992)\n     (Newman, J., concurring) (“Whatever sentence is ultimately imposed on [the\n     defendant], . . . [it] should not turn on fact-finding that has little if any\n     relevance to moral culpability.”).\n\n                                          28\n\f1    crimes, even when only fortuity separates the two.    Op. of J.\n\n2    Calabresi at [5-6].     But how the law treats attempts is besides\n\n3    the point.    As the majority itself recognizes, material support\n\n4    of terrorism is “a substantive, not inchoate, offense.”    Maj. Op.\n\n5    at [51].     “This is an independent crime, complete in its most\n\n6    serious form when the [material support] is complete and nothing\n\n7    is added to its criminality by success or consummation, as would\n\n8    be the case, say, of attempted murder.”    Spies v. United States,\n\n9    317 U.S. 492, 498-99 (1943).\n\n10        Stewart completed her crime as Congress chose to define it,\n\n11   and the Sentencing Commission, in drafting the terrorism\n\n12   enhancement, elected not to mitigate its seriousness by rewarding\n\n13   a defendant whose crime did not ultimately result in death or\n\n14   serious injury with a reduced sentencing range.    It is for this\n\n15   reason that lack of success cannot normally be a mitigating\n\n16   factor even though achievement of harm may be an aggravating\n\n17   factor.    Permitting a district judge to require success in\n\n18   harming innocents before he will apply the terrorism enhancement\n19   in a “heartland” case is to permit that judge to disregard the\n\n20   fact that material support is itself a fully completed crime.\n\n21        The majority states that “[f]ortuitous events are not\n\n22   categorically irrelevant to the determination of a just\n\n23   punishment nor is their consideration necessarily inappropriate.”\n\n24   Maj. Op. at [100].     As a general matter, of course, I agree.    In\n\n25   addition, I do not mean to suggest that there can never be a\n\n26   terrorism case in which absence of harm might be an appropriate\n\n                                       29\n\f1    consideration, only that there is a very broad heartland of cases\n\n2    in which it should not be considered.     If, for example, an\n\n3    incompetent terrorist satisfies the enhancement by putting a\n\n4    small amount of arsenic into a reservoir for New York’s drinking\n\n5    water with every intention of killing thousands, but without\n\n6    understanding that the quantity is insufficient to cause harm,\n\n7    the complete absence of any practical possibility that the plot\n\n8    could cause harm may well be relevant.     But, that is far from the\n\n9    instant case, in which Stewart’s actions were designed to\n10   embolden Rahman’s followers to resume a murderous jihad against\n\n11   scores of innocent individuals in Egypt and elsewhere.     In this\n\n12   case, it was unreasonable for the district court to place any\n\n13   weight on the fortuitous and attenuated events that saved the\n\n14   potential victims of Stewart’s crime, much less to use it to wipe\n\n15   out the congressionally mandated terrorism enhancement.\n\n16          Judge Calabresi’s attempt to defend the district court’s\n\n17   analysis, by offering a hypothetical comparing the punishment of\n\n18   a terrorist who succeeds in causing harm with the punishment of\n19   one who does not misses the mark.      See Op. of J. Calabresi at\n\n20   [9].   The question at issue is not whether the amount of harm can\n\n21   never be a factor in sentencing.      It is whether the terrorist who\n\n22   attempts to detonate a bomb in a public place, with the intent of\n\n23   killing many innocent Americans, should be able to escape the\n\n24   terrorism enhancement altogether simply because his plan happens\n\n25   to fail or be foiled by authorities.     The answer, as the\n\n26   Sentencing Commission has made clear, is no.     A more persuasive\n\n                                      30\n\f1    reason than the mere absence of injury must be provided by the\n\n2    district judge who uses that factor to eliminate the terrorism\n\n3    enhancement.   To permit a judge to completely set aside the\n\n4    enhancement in a “heartland” case simply because the terrorist\n\n5    did not succeed, without further explanation as to why that case\n\n6    is sui generis, is to overlook the reality that the objective of\n\n7    terrorism is to kill large numbers of innocent people and that\n\n8    maximum deterrence needs to be achieved irrespective of success.\n\n9         Actual harm is a flawed metric when determining culpability\n10   in material support prosecutions.    Precisely because of the\n\n11   devastating consequences at stake, it is, and should be, the\n\n12   focus of enforcement authorities to make every effort to prevent\n\n13   those consequences before they occur.   When enforcement\n\n14   authorities are successful, it is to their great credit and their\n\n15   efforts should in no sense lessen the deterrent effect of\n\n16   punishment by conferring a sentencing benefit on those whose\n\n17   efforts were thwarted.   Indeed, the House Report accompanying the\n\n18   Comprehensive Antiterrorism Act of 1995, which criminalized the\n19   material support of terrorism, explained that one of the\n\n20   legislation’s primary goals was to “enhance [law enforcement’s]\n\n21   capability of thwarting, frustrating, and preventing terrorist\n\n22   acts before they result in death and destruction.”   H.R. Rep. No.\n\n23   104-383, at 42 (1995) (emphasis added).\n\n24        I fully recognize that district judges must develop ways of\n\n25   distinguishing whether and why one form of material support is\n\n26   more or less reprehensible than another, given the broad range of\n\n\n                                     31\n\f1    conduct that the material support statute criminalizes, see 18\n\n2    U.S.C. § 2339A.   However, it makes little sense to have the\n\n3    presence or absence of resultant harm to victims be a factor in\n\n4    that determination.    Cf. United States v. Whiteskunk, 162 F.3d\n\n5    1244, 1251 (10th Cir. 1998) (finding it “unfair not to recognize\n\n6    and accommodate th[e] varying spectrum of culpability” when\n\n7    sentencing for a “broad category of conduct” (emphasis added)).\n\n8    Because material support providers often have been, and hopefully\n\n9    will continue to be, apprehended before the crimes that they\n10   foster come to fruition, the lack of physical injury is more\n\n11   likely to be the norm than the exception.\n\n12        Accordingly, the lack of injury here was not a fact of\n\n13   “critical relevance . . . distinguish[ing]” Stewart’s conduct\n\n14   “not only from that of all [her] codefendants, but from the vast\n\n15   majority of defendants convicted of conspiracy in federal court.”\n\n16   Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 600.   Giving the absence of harm mitigating\n\n17   significance thus not only fails to recognize the extreme\n\n18   seriousness of such crimes even without achievement of actual\n19   harm, it undermines one of § 3553(a)’s express goals:\n\n20   eliminating sentencing disparities.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6);\n\n21   United States v. Simpson, 538 F.3d 459, 464 (6th Cir. 2008)\n\n22   (noting that focusing on “the defendant’s culpability” instead of\n\n23   fortuity when sentencing “prevents arbitrary disparities”\n\n24   (emphasis added)).    The happenstance lack of devastating injury\n\n25   implicit in terrorism crimes generally and Stewart’s in\n\n26   particular simply cannot “bear the weight” the district court\n\n\n                                      32\n\f1    assigned to it.   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191.   The district court\n\n2    acted unreasonably by using the absence of proven harm to justify\n\n3    completely discarding the terrorism enhancement and to support an\n\n4    unwarranted mitigation of the seriousness of the crime of\n\n5    conviction.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).\n\n6         My colleagues in the majority also suggest that because\n\n7    Stewart’s terrorism crimes preceded the events of September 11,\n\n8    2001 her view of her own culpability might have been different\n\n9    than would be true after that tragic day.    While such a lack of\n10   awareness may be true of the ordinary New Yorker, such\n\n11   attribution is ill-suited for Stewart who, as Abdel Rahman’s\n\n12   lawyer, sat through extensive horrific evidence at his trial,\n\n13   including that the Islamic Group was responsible for the\n\n14   slaughter of scores of innocent tourists at Luxor and the Islamic\n\n15   Group’s plans to bring New York to its knees by blowing up\n\n16   buildings, bridges, tunnels, and by assassinating the Egyptian\n\n17   President while in New York City.\n\n18              b. The Absence of an Enhancement for Perjury and\n19              Obstruction of Justice\n\n20        After jettisoning the terrorism enhancement in assessing the\n\n21   seriousness of Stewart’s crime of conviction pursuant to §\n\n22   3553(a)(2)(A), the district court then noted that — with this\n\n23   mitigation — the Guidelines would provide for a sentencing range\n\n24   for Stewart of either 78 to 97 months or 97 to 121 months,\n\n25   depending on whether the obstruction of justice enhancement\n\n26   applied.   I join the majority’s view that the district court’s\n\n\n                                     33\n\f1    failure to make any findings regarding obstruction was\n\n2    procedurally unreasonable.    Maj. Op. at [124].    The district\n\n3    court’s reason for not making such findings was that there was no\n\n4    point in doing so, because the terrorism enhancement took the\n\n5    sentence to the statutory maximum.    After the district court\n\n6    discarded the terrorism enhancement, however, the obstruction\n\n7    enhancement became relevant to the Guidelines calculation.     In\n\n8    addition, as the majority notes, it was error for the district\n\n9    court not to account for Stewart’s potential perjury in the §\n\n10   3553(a) calculus.    See Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190.\n\n11              c. The Absence of an Enhancement for Abuse of Trust\n\n12        The majority properly faults the district court for failing\n\n13   to “explain how and to what extent the sentence reflected the\n\n14   seriousness of the crimes of conviction in light of the fact that\n\n15   Stewart was . . . a member of the bar when she committed them.”\n\n16   Maj. Op. at [121].    The majority asks whether, in that light,\n\n17   “her punishment should have been greater than it was,” and then\n\n18   suggests the obvious answer.    Maj. Op. at [121].   I agree with\n\n19   the majority’s criticism.    As a “guardian[] of the law,” a lawyer\n\n20   has a special obligation to “refrain from all illegal and morally\n\n21   reprehensible behavior.”    New York Code of Professional\n\n22   Responsibility, Preamble, EC 1-5 (effective through March 31,\n\n23   2009).   However, the majority does not go far enough.    Stewart\n\n24   was not just a lawyer who committed crimes.    And she did not use\n\n25   her professional position simply to gain access to her client and\n\n26   to carry his jihadist messages by criminal means, conduct that,\n\n                                      34\n\f1    as noted in the previous section of this opinion reflects an\n\n2    extreme seriousness unreasonably overlooked by the district\n\n3    court.    Stewart also committed her material support crimes by\n\n4    garnering the trust of the government, and then blatantly\n\n5    violating that trust — a fiduciary obligation that lies at the\n\n6    core of the SAMs system and that protects the right to counsel,\n\n7    even for convicted terrorists.\n\n8         Under the Guidelines, the abuse-of-trust enhancement applies\n\n9    when a defendant has “abused a position of public or private\n10   trust . . . in a manner that significantly facilitated the\n\n11   commission or concealment of the offense.”           U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3\n\n12   (2000).   As the Commentary explains, a position of trust is\n\n13   “characterized by professional or managerial discretion,” for\n\n14   “[p]ersons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to\n\n15   significantly less supervision than employees whose\n\n16   responsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature,” id.\n\n17   cmt. n.1 (2000), and “[s]uch persons generally are viewed as more\n\n18   culpable,” id. cmt. background (2000).\n19        The district court failed to explain why an enhancement for\n\n20   abuse of trust is not plainly appropriate in this case.              The\n\n21   majority fails to fault the district court on this score because\n\n22   “the government did not specifically invoke section 3B1.3 in its\n\n23   sentencing memorandum.”      Maj. Op. at [121 n.37].        But the\n\n24   government explicitly argued for consideration of Stewart’s abuse\n\n25   of trust at the sentencing hearing:\n26        [T]he United States Attorney’s Office who was administering the SAMs\n27        trusted Ms. Stewart, put their faith in Ms. Stewart that she was\n\n\n                                       35\n\f1         doing what she promised to do.      She considered that attorney\n2         affirmation that she signed an oath, a promise.      Those are her\n3         words. And the government accepted that commitment and believed she\n4         would honor that commitment, but she violated that trust that was\n5         put in her by the United States Attorney’s Office, by the Justice\n6         Department, repeatedly violated [it].\n7\n8    Sent’g Tr. 95.    As a result, the issue was properly before the\n\n9    district court.\n\n10        The SAMs placed trust in Stewart because she was a member of\n\n11   the bar appointed under the Criminal Justice Act to represent\n\n12   Abdel Rahman, and she made explicit affirmations to the\n\n13   government specifically required to curb her client’s ability to\n\n14   continue terrorist activities.       Only because of the SAMs did\n\n15   Stewart have private access to, and “significantly less\n\n16   supervision” in her contacts with, Abdel Rahman, U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3\n\n17   cmt. n.1 (2000), and obtain the freedom she needed to act as his\n\n18   lawyer.   Stewart used, or more accurately abused, the trust that\n\n19   the government placed in her to “facilitat[e] the commission . .\n\n20   . of [her] offense,” id., furthering terrorist communications\n\n21   that put innocent lives in jeopardy.         Stewart was only given\n\n22   access to Abdel Rahman to discuss legal matters; instead, she\n\n23   engaged in criminal actions that, as she conceded at trial, had\n24   nothing to do with any past, pending, or future legal proceedings\n\n25   and were unrelated to the rendering of legal advice.            See Trial\n\n26   Tr. 7722 (acknowledging that Abdel Rahman’s “appeals [were]\n\n27   exhausted, with no issue legally on the horizon”).\n\n28        Stewart’s abuse of trust is particularly significant because\n\n29   it supports the arguments of those who say that our Article III\n\n30   courts, and the constitutional protections they afford, are not\n\n\n                                          36\n\f1    suited to terrorist trials.       See generally, e.g., Michael B.\n\n2    Mukasey, Civilian Courts Are No Place To Try Terrorists, Wall St.\n\n3    J., Oct. 19, 2009, at A21 (discussing the difficulties of trying\n\n4    terrorists in Article III courts).         The SAMs are designed to\n\n5    safeguard those rights, but they must necessarily be conditioned\n\n6    on attorneys respecting the trust placed in them, and cannot be\n\n7    sustained without that trust.        Stewart’s conduct thus raises\n\n8    concerns reaching even beyond her dealings with Abdel Rahman.\n\n9    Her criminal acts jeopardize, in a sensitive set of cases, the\n10   accused’s right to his choice of independent counsel, which is\n\n11   the right upon which the vindication of all of the accused’s\n\n12   other rights, and, in a larger sense, the right to a trial by an\n\n13   Article III court, depends.15\n\n14         Section 3553(a) requires a district court to consider all of\n\n15   the Guidelines relevant to a defendant’s conduct.            See 18 U.S.C.\n\n16   § 3553(a)(4); Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189 (requiring a district court\n\n17   to “conduct its own independent review of the sentencing factors,\n\n18   aided by the arguments of the prosecution and defense”).             In\n19   sentencing Stewart, the district court mentioned “abuse of trust”\n\n20   as part of the litany of her crimes and noted that Stewart\n\n21   “abused her position as a lawyer” in order to further Abdel\n\n22   Rahman’s terrorist quest.       Sent’g Tr. 118.     Yet the district\n\n           15\n             See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963) (“The right . . .\n     to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some\n     countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, [we] have laid great\n     emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair\n     trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before\n     the law.”); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69 (1932) (“Without [this right],\n     though [a defendant] be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because\n     he does not know how to establish his innocence.”).\n\n                                          37\n\f1    court gave no indication that it considered to any extent the\n\n2    depth of Stewart’s abuse of trust as argued by the government,\n\n3    which went beyond simply abusing her position as a lawyer to gain\n\n4    access to Abdel Rahman.       By not fully responding to the\n\n5    government’s clear and forceful argument by considering the\n\n6    policy reflected in U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3,16 and accounting for\n\n7    Stewart’s grave abuse of trust in assessing the seriousness of\n\n8    Stewart’s crime and imposing its sentence, the district court\n\n9    erred procedurally.\n10         d. The Impact of These Errors on the Rest of the § 3553\n\n11         Analysis\n\n12         The district court’s errors in assessing the seriousness of\n\n13   Stewart’s crime impacted other parts of its § 3553 analysis and,\n\n14   for that reason, must be recognized if any remand in this case is\n\n15   to yield a reasonable sentence.        Necessarily, the district\n\n16   court’s unreasonable underappreciation of the gravity of\n\n17   Stewart’s offense, evident from its reasoning despite its\n\n18   statements to the contrary, infected its consideration of “the\n19   need . . . to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” 18\n\n20   U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2), and “the need to avoid unwarranted sentence\n\n21   disparities,” id. § 3553(a)(6), because both factors are\n\n22   calibrated by the seriousness of the offense at stake.             More\n\n           16\n              See United States v. Carty, 520 F.3d 984, 992-93 (9th Cir. 2008) (en\n     banc) (“[W]hen a party raises a specific, nonfrivolous argument tethered to a\n     relevant § 3553(a) factor in support of a requested sentence, then the judge\n     should normally explain why he accepts or rejects the party’s position.”\n     (citing Rita, 551 U.S. at 355-56)); see also Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 599 (“Had the\n     prosecutor raised the issue, specific discussion of the point might have been\n     in order . . . .”).\n\n\n                                          38\n\f1    serious crimes require greater deterrence; an unreasonably low\n\n2    view of a crime’s severity will taint a district court’s stance\n\n3    on whether a given sentence sufficiently deters future criminal\n\n4    conduct, both for the specific defendant and for the public at\n\n5    large.   In no area can the need for adequate deterrence be\n\n6    greater than in terrorism cases, with their potential for\n\n7    devastating loss of innocent life.         Similarly, an erroneous\n\n8    assessment of a crime’s seriousness precludes accurate comparison\n\n9    with equally serious crimes, to avoid unwarranted disparities.\n10   Thus, although the district court’s mishandling of the\n\n11   seriousness of Stewart’s crime constitutes reversible error on\n\n12   its own, I believe it also infects other judgments the court made\n\n13   in its mandatory § 3553(a) analysis.\n\n14         2. The District Court’s Overwhelming Emphasis on Stewart’s\n\n15         Age, Health, and Career\n\n16         The district judge found that Stewart’s “extraordinary\n\n17   personal characteristics . . . argue[d] strongly in favor of a\n\n18   substantial downward variance,” Sent’g Tr. 114, and used that\n19   finding to effectively set aside the Guidelines and their\n\n20   import.17   To be sure, it was appropriate, indeed required that\n\n           17\n 1            A district court, of course, has wide discretion to impose a non-\n 2   Guidelines sentence after properly calculating the appropriate Guidelines\n 3   range. Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597. But because the Guidelines are the\n 4   touchstone or “starting point” for sentencing, id. at 596, the entire thrust\n 5   of sentencing below or above the Guidelines is that “any deviation [is] from\n 6   the Guidelines,” id. at 597, and is to be justified in that context. Because\n 7   a district judge “must begin [his] analysis with the Guidelines and remain\n 8   cognizant of them throughout the sentencing process,” id. at 597 n.6 (emphasis\n 9   added), it is not permissible simply to set them aside in toto and to impose a\n10   sentence that bears no rational relationship to them as if they did not exist.\n11   See United States v. Williams, 524 F.3d 209, 215 (2d Cir. 2008) (explaining\n12   that “displacement of the Sentencing Guidelines at the threshold . . . cannot\n13   be reconciled with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)”). But this is precisely what the\n\n                                          39\n\f1    the district judge consider Stewart’s “history and\n\n2    characteristics” under § 3553(a)(1).   But the district court\n\n3    abused its discretion by allowing this factor to overwhelm its\n\n4    consideration of “the need for the sentence imposed to reflect\n\n5    the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, .\n\n6    . . to provide just punishment for the offense, and . . . to\n\n7    afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” 18 U.S.C. §\n\n8    3553(a)(2), and by using it to justify the deep discount of 332\n\n9    months in Stewart’s sentence.   Indeed, given the magnitude of the\n10   district court’s error in evaluating the seriousness of the\n\n11   offense in this case, it could not reasonably determine what\n\n12   weight, if any, to assign to personal mitigating factors.\n\n13         Although we have no specific formula for balancing the §\n\n14   3553(a) factors, “unjustified reliance upon any one factor is a\n\n15   symptom of an unreasonable sentence,” Rattoballi, 452 F.3d at\n\n16   137, and here, the district judge’s focus on Stewart’s personal\n\n17   qualities exceeded the bounds of reasonableness in light of the\n\n18   gravity of her crimes.   Whatever weight Stewart’s career, age,\n19   and physical condition might reasonably warrant, these factors\n\n20   cannot support an unprecedentedly lenient 28-month sentence for\n\n21   what the district court itself termed her “extraordinarily severe\n\n22   criminal conduct.”    Sent’g Tr. 118; see supra note 3.\n\n23         The imposition of a 28-month prison sentence “slighted,”\n\n24   Taylor, 487 U.S. at 337, the extreme criminality of Stewart’s\n\n\n\n\n1    district judge did.\n\n                                      40\n\f1    offense18 and disregarded the manifest purpose of the Guidelines\n\n2    regime:    to avoid “unwarranted sentencing disparities,” 18 U.S.C.\n\n3    § 3553(a)(6).     See Booker, 543 U.S. at 264-65.        The Guidelines\n\n4    “reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve §\n\n5    3553(a)’s objectives,” Rita, 551 U.S. at 350, and Stewart’s age,\n\n6    health, and career simply cannot justify the degree to which the\n\n7    district judge deviated from the Guidelines pursuant to §\n\n8    3553(a).\n\n9          The district court’s apparent disregard of “the need to\n10   avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6),\n\n11   is particularly striking in light of the court’s obligation to\n\n12   consider “pertinent [Commission] policy statement[s],” id. §\n\n13   3553(a)(5).    For example, the Commission has determined that only\n\n14   “an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a\n\n15   sentence below the applicable guideline range,” U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4\n\n16   (2000) (emphasis added), yet the record indicates that Stewart,\n\n17   despite medical issues, will receive appropriate medical care in\n\n18   prison, and the district judge himself acknowledged that\n19   “[m]edical care can be delivered while in prison,” Sent’g Tr.\n\n\n           18\n 1           The district court treated Stewart’s terrorism and fraud crimes —\n 2   “particularly grave” offenses, Meskini, 319 F.3d at 92 — much more leniently\n 3   than what the Guidelines recommend for bank embezzlement, see U.S.S.G. §\n 4   2B1.1(b)(6)(B) (2000) (recommending a minimum range of 51-63 months for\n 5   embezzlement “affect[ing] a financial institution” and resulting in over\n 6   “$1,000,000 in gross receipts”), and on par with the Guidelines\n 7   recommendations for criminal trademark infringement, see U.S.S.G. § 2B5.3\n 8   (2000) (recommending a minimum range of 24-30 months for the manufacture of\n 9   infringing items exceeding $120,000 in total retail value), conspiring to\n10   steal over $5,000 of car parts, see U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(E), (5) (2000) (15-\n11   21 months), burgling a residence and stealing a $2,600 television, see\n12   U.S.S.G. § 2B2.1(a)(1), (b)(2)(B) (2000) (27-33 months), and possessing 1.5\n13   grams of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute it, see U.S.S.G. §\n14   2D1.1(c)(11) (2000) (27-33 months).\n\n                                          41\n\f1    117.   The district judge, of course, is not bound by Commission\n\n2    policy, but the record nowhere suggests that Stewart’s condition\n\n3    was sufficiently compelling to distinguish her from others in the\n\n4    prison population and to warrant any leniency on that score.     As\n\n5    for Stewart’s age, the Commission has concluded that this factor\n\n6    “is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence\n\n7    should be outside the applicable guideline range[, but it] may be\n\n8    a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline\n\n9    range in a case in which the defendant is elderly and infirm . .\n10   . .”   U.S.S.G. § 5H1.1 (2000).   Again, the district court was not\n\n11   bound by this statement.   But the district judge’s point that\n\n12   Stewart’s sentence “will represent a greater portion of her\n\n13   remaining life than for a younger defendant,” Sent’g Tr. 117,\n\n14   would apply to any older defendant, and this is not an\n\n15   extraordinary factor, such as being “elderly and infirm,” that\n\n16   can justify excessive leniency.    See Rattoballi, 452 F.3d at 136\n\n17   n.4, 137.   The district court cited both Stewart’s age (67 years)\n\n18   and health (sleep apnea; cancer survivor with a chance of\n19   recurrence) in concluding that “[a]ny sentence of imprisonment\n\n20   will be particularly difficult for the defendant.”   Sent’g Tr.\n\n21   117.   Yet as the majority notes, Maj. Op. at [26-27 n.9], Stewart\n\n22   herself apparently did not share the district court’s misgivings:\n\n23   “I don’t think anybody would say that going to jail for 28 months\n\n24   is anything anyone would look forward to, but as my clients have\n\n\n\n\n                                       42\n\f1    told me, ‘I can do that standing on my head.’”19           Stewart was not\n\n2    “elderly and infirm,” and I do not see how her age or health\n\n3    could reasonably contribute to such a significant variance from\n\n4    the Guidelines.     Advancing age and treatable medical conditions\n\n5    are not normally a ticket to overwhelming leniency, and this case\n\n6    is no different from the norm in that respect.\n\n7          Similarly, Stewart’s career of public service, as admirable\n\n8    as it seemed to the district court, can only go so far.             “[I]t is\n\n9    usually not appropriate to excuse a defendant almost entirely\n10   from incarceration because [s]he performed acts that, though in\n\n11   society’s interest, also were the defendant’s responsibility to\n\n12   perform and stood to benefit the defendant personally and\n\n13   professionally.”     United States v. D’Amico, 496 F.3d 95, 107 (1st\n\n14   Cir. 2007).    The district court placed emphasis on Stewart’s\n\n15   providing legal services to “the poor, the disadvantaged[,] and\n\n16   [the] unpopular over three decades,” Sent’g Tr. 115, but as the\n\n17   district judge himself put it, “that credit does not extend to\n\n18   the knowing violation of the law,” Sent’g Tr. 119.            Yet given the\n\n19   severity of Stewart’s conduct, this credit, which contributed\n\n20   heavily to a 332-month reduction from the recommended Guideline\n\n21   range to a 28-month sentence, goes further than the district\n\n22   court’s explanation can bear.        Giving such excessive weight to\n\n23   Stewart’s resumé trivializes the seriousness of her crimes,\n\n\n\n           19\n             Ellen Barry, Terrorist Lawyer Gets Two-Year Term, LA Times, Oct. 17,\n     2006, available at http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/17/nation/na-stewart17\n     (last visited Aug. 20, 2009); Katie Cornell, Wrist Slap for Smirk Jerk Terror\n     Attorney, N.Y. Post, Oct. 17, 2006, at 4.\n\n                                          43\n\f1    particularly when her legal career, by leading the government to\n\n2    trust her, is what enabled her to commit these crimes.\n\n3         Overemphasizing Stewart’s career as a lawyer also fails to\n\n4    “promote respect for the law” or “afford adequate deterrence to\n\n5    criminal conduct” under any reasonable understanding of those\n\n6    mandatory sentencing considerations.     18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).\n\n7    The district court found that Stewart’s likely disbarment\n\n8    “significantly . . . mean[t] that the occasion for her offenses\n\n9    will be removed,” Sent’g Tr. 116.     This is wrong.   One does not\n10   need a law license in order to materially support terrorism or to\n\n11   defraud the U.S. government.\n\n12        In sum, though we will rarely identify procedural error in\n\n13   the weight a sentencing judge assigns to relevant factors, this\n\n14   is one of those rare cases where the record of a defendant’s\n\n15   personal characteristics simply cannot bear the weight necessary\n\n16   to support the challenged sentence.     See Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192.\n\n17        3. Overall Substantive Unreasonableness\n\n18        I by no means assume that, upon resentencing, Stewart’s\n19   sentence will remain at 28 months, but I would be remiss if I did\n\n20   not comment further on Stewart’s current sentence.     Unlike the\n\n21   majority, I do not believe that this court must hold off on the\n\n22   question of substantive unreasonabless until the procedural flaws\n\n23   it identifies are remedied.    Maj. Op. at [99-100 n.33].    The\n\n24   “informed intuition of the appellate panel” has a place in\n\n25   appellate review.   See United States v. Rigas, No. 08-CR-3485,\n\n26   2009 WL 3166066, at *11 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2009).     And in the rare\n\n                                      44\n\f1    instance when a sentence imposed by a district court judge makes\n\n2    it plain that his judgment is in stark contrast with the\n\n3    appellate panel’s intuition – as evidenced, for example, by the\n\n4    comparative sentences of co-defendants – judicial efficiency\n\n5    counsels us to identify the substantive error along with\n\n6    procedural error at this time to minimize the need for subsequent\n\n7    appeals.    This is not, as Judge Calabresi suggests, the issuing\n\n8    of an advisory opinion.       Op. of J. Calabresi at [12].        Rather it\n\n9    is providing a district court with the full basis for the\n\n10   appellate panel’s remand prior to resentencing.20\n\n11         I stress that it is not the role of the appellate court to\n\n12   compare the district court’s sentence to what the appellate court\n\n13   deems the “correct” sentence.        Instead, our task is to ask\n\n\n\n           20\n              Judge Calabresi’s concurrence also contains the notion, never\n     mentioned earlier in these proceedings, that because Abdel Rahman’s two other\n     lawyers were not charged with SAMs violations some justification for a lower\n     sentence for Stewart might be found since “there might be even greater\n     disparities between a defendant and other individuals who were not charged at\n     all.” Op. of J. Calabresi at [16-17]. Judge Calabresi further suggests that\n     it is not much of an extension to permit district courts to use their\n     sentencing authority “to exercise . . . supervision” over discretionary\n     prosecutorial decisions not to bring charges where there is no claim of\n     selective prosecution. Op. of J. Calabresi at [15]. Whatever attraction\n     this idea might hold for a law review editor, it should not find a home in the\n     law. Prosecutorial discretion is traditionally exclusive and absolute,\n     subject of course to constitutional limits. See United States v. Nixon, 418\n     U.S. 683, 693 (1974); United States v. Molina, 530 F.3d 326, 332 (5th Cir.\n     2008); In re U.S., 503 F.3d 638, 642 (7th Cir. 2007). Insulated from judicial\n     review by the separation of powers, United States v. Campo, 140 F.3d 415, 419\n     (2d Cir. 1998), prosecutors acting in good faith, and there is no suggestion\n     to the contrary in this case, base their decisions not to prosecute on many\n     factors (cooperation and truthful accounts, trial dynamics, the quality of\n     evidence, time and resource requirements to name a few). It is enough of a\n     task for a busy district judge to administer justice in the cases actually\n     before the court without initiating its own inquisitorial foray into the\n     prosecutor’s office. In re U.S., 503 F.3d at 641 (“Judges in the United\n     States resolve the parties’ disputes rather than initiate their own factual\n     inquiries on issues that the parties have not contested; that’s a major\n     difference between adversarial and inquisitorial systems.”) And to what\n     purpose? To possibly reduce an otherwise just sentence?\n\n                                          45\n\f1    whether the sentence imposed by the district court is so high or\n\n2    low that it is manifestly unjust or shocks-the-conscious.             Id.\n\n3    We are not a mere “rubber stamp.”         Id. (citing United States v.\n\n4    Rattoballi, 452 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2006)).           “If we are going\n\n5    to let (district) judges be judges, and trust them to exercise\n\n6    the necessary discretion with sensitivity to the need for\n\n7    coherent sentencing policy, so we should let (appellate) judges\n\n8    be judges as well, performing their traditional function of\n\n9    reining in excess and gradually developing a “common law” of what\n10   is and is not sensible.”21      Hon. Gerard E. Lynch, Sentencing\n\n11   After Gall and Kimbrough: Letting Guidelines Be Guidelines (and\n\n12   Judges Be Judges), OSCJL Amici: Views From the Field 5 (January\n\n13   2008), at http://osjclblogspot.com.\n\n14         Even apart from the aggravating circumstances of Stewart’s\n\n15   obstruction of justice, her abuse of trust, and her false\n\n16   statements to the government, Stewart’s conduct was closer to\n\n17   that of Sattar, whose 24-year sentence still represented a sharp\n\n18   reduction from his Guidelines sentence of life imprisonment, than\n19   that of Yousry.     The district court found that Stewart and Sattar\n\n20   had engaged in conduct that warranted application of the\n\n21   terrorism enhancement and that was “calculated to influence or\n\n22   affect the conduct of the Egyptian government,” see Sent’g Tr.\n\n           21\n              Judge Calabresi suggests that substantive unreasonabless should not\n     be determined when tied to procedural error than can be corrected first,\n     although if the two are distinct then it may be “plausible to address the two\n     issues at once” if the procedural error is not harmless. Op. of J. Calabresi\n     at [12]. But whether the procedural error is harmless is irrelevant to\n     substantive unreasonableness. In any event, he fails to explain the benefit\n     of a “two-step appeal” rule that can result in correcting a good district\n     judge on two separate occasions when one would suffice.\n\n                                          46\n\f1    24, 28, & 108, but that student interpreter Yousry had not,\n\n2    Sent’g Tr. 143-44.\n\n3         Nonetheless, Stewart’s sentence was much closer to that of\n\n4    Yousry, even though, as the district court noted, Yousry’s “role\n\n5    in the offenses was subservient to the others involved,” Sent’g\n\n6    Tr. 150.   Stewart was given a sentence only eight months greater\n\n7    than that of Yousry, and in relative terms, she was treated far\n\n8    more leniently.   Yousry’s conduct, unlike that of Sattar and\n\n9    Stewart, was found by the district court to not warrant the\n10   terrorism enhancement; nor did Yousry falsely sign the SAMs or\n\n11   merit consideration for obstruction-of-justice and abuse-of-trust\n\n12   enhancements.   As a result, Yousry’s Guidelines range was 78 to\n\n13   97 months, less than one-third of Stewart’s Guidelines range of\n\n14   360 months.   Yousry’s actual 20-month sentence represented just\n\n15   under one-quarter of the 88-month median of his Guidelines range,\n\n16   while Stewart’s sentence was under one-tenth of her 360-month\n\n17   Guidelines range.    Under the Guidelines, more than 260 months\n\n18   separated the sentences of Stewart and Yousry, yet the district\n19   court chose sentences that were only eight months apart.   Like\n\n20   the majority, I am puzzled by this mismatch, particularly in\n\n21   light of “the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities.”\n\n22   18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).\n\n23        Because Stewart’s sentence is so out of line with the\n\n24   extreme seriousness of her criminal conduct (and, not\n\n25   surprisingly given that fact, with what the Guidelines\n\n26   recommend), notwithstanding the considerable deference due the\n\n\n                                      47\n\f1    district court at sentencing, I conclude that Stewart’s sentence\n\n2    is not only procedurally unreasonable, but also substantively\n\n3    unreasonable and an abuse of discretion.   The district court’s\n\n4    rationale for the sentence cannot “bear the weight assigned it\n\n5    under the totality of circumstances in the case.”   Cavera, 550\n\n6    F.3d at 191.   Indeed, I am at a loss for any rationale upon this\n\n7    record that could reasonably justify a sentence of 28 months\n\n8    imprisonment for this defendant under § 3553(a).    Accordingly, in\n\n9    addition to the procedural flaws that I have identified,\n10   Stewart’s sentence should be vacated as substantively\n\n11   unreasonable and resentencing required on that basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                     48\n\f",

Koeltl, Judge) for various crimes arising from their\n\n13   contacts with and behavior relating to government restrictions on\n\n14   communications and other contacts with Sheikh Omar Ahmad Ali\n\n15   Abdel Rahman.   Rahman is serving a life sentence in a maximum\n\n16   security prison for terrorism-related crimes of seditious\n\n17   conspiracy, solicitation of murder, solicitation of an attack on\n\n18   American military installations, conspiracy to murder, and a\n\n19   conspiracy to bomb.    He is subject to \"Special Administrative\n\n20   Measures\" (\"SAMs\") restricting his ability to communicate with\n\n21   persons outside of the prison in which he is incarcerated so as\n\n22   to prevent him from continuing to lead terrorist organizations\n\n23   and their members.    The government cross-appeals from the\n\n24   defendants' sentences.\n\n25             We would be remiss if we did not, at the outset,\n\n26   commend the district court for its thoroughness, thoughtfulness,\n\n27   and effectiveness in the conduct of these unusually lengthy,\n\n28   difficult, and sensitive proceedings.    Much of what follows\n\n29   simply reports what it did and tracks what it said.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f1              We affirm the judgments of conviction.   We also affirm\n\n2    the sentences of Yousry and Sattar.   We remand the case, however,\n\n3    with respect to the sentence of Stewart, and also with respect to\n\n4    the sentences of Yousry and Sattar in light of the resentencing\n\n5    of Stewart.\n\n6              In particular, we affirm the judgments as to each\n\n7    defendant's conviction of conspiring to defraud the United\n\n8    States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, by violating SAMs\n\n9    imposed upon Abdel Rahman.   Contrary to the defendants'\n\n10   arguments, the evidence is sufficient to sustain these\n\n11   convictions.   Moreover, we reject both Stewart's argument that,\n\n12   as a lawyer, she was not bound by the SAMs, and her belated\n\n13   argument collaterally attacking their constitutionality.\n\n14             We affirm as to Sattar's conviction of conspiring to\n\n15   murder persons in a foreign country in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n16   § 956, and his conviction of soliciting persons to commit crimes\n\n17   of violence -- viz., murder and conspiracy to commit murder -- in\n\n18   violation of 18 U.S.C. § 373.   We conclude that the evidence is\n\n19   sufficient to sustain these convictions, especially in light of\n\n20   testimony establishing that Sattar attempted to undermine a\n\n21   unilateral cease-fire by an Egyptian terrorist organization and\n\n22   to draft a fatwa calling for, inter alia, the killing of \"Jews\n\n23   and Crusaders.\"\n\n24             We affirm as to Stewart's and Yousry's convictions of\n\n25   providing and concealing material support to the conspiracy to\n\n26   murder persons in a foreign country in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f1    § 2339A and 18 U.S.C. § 2, and of conspiring to provide and\n\n2    conceal such support in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.   We\n\n3    conclude that the charges were valid -- that 18 U.S.C. § 2339A is\n\n4    neither unconstitutionally vague as applied nor a \"logical\n\n5    absurdity,\" as Stewart asserts -- and that the evidence was\n\n6    sufficient to sustain the convictions.   We also reject Stewart's\n\n7    claims that her purported attempt to serve as a \"zealous\n\n8    advocate\" for her client provides her with immunity from the\n\n9    convictions.\n\n10             Finally, we affirm Stewart's convictions for knowingly\n\n11   and willfully making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n12   § 1001 when she affirmed that she intended to, and would, abide\n\n13   by the SAMs.   In light of her repeated and flagrant violation of\n\n14   the SAMs, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Stewart's\n\n15   representations that she intended to and would abide by the SAMs\n\n16   were knowingly false when made.\n\n17             We reject the remaining challenges to the convictions.\n\n18   We affirm the district court's rejection of Sattar's vindictive\n\n19   prosecution claim because there is insufficient evidence to\n\n20   support a finding that the government's pre-trial decision to add\n\n21   new charges against Sattar amounted to an effort to punish him\n\n22   for exercising his constitutional rights.   And, because Stewart's\n\n23   conduct was materially different from, and more serious than, the\n\n24   conduct of other lawyers representing Abdel Rahman who may also\n\n25   have violated the SAMs, we affirm the district court's rejection\n\n26   of Stewart's claim that she was selectively prosecuted on account\n\n                                       -5-\n\f1    of her gender or political beliefs.   We also conclude that the\n\n2    district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sever\n\n3    the trial of Stewart and Yousry from that of Sattar in light of\n\n4    the general preference for joint trials, the specific charges at\n\n5    issue here, and the district court's curative instructions.    Nor\n\n6    did the district court abuse its discretion by empaneling an\n\n7    anonymous jury in light of the particular allegations of criminal\n\n8    wrongdoing at issue, involving the corruption of the judicial\n\n9    process, and the widespread publicity about the case.   We find no\n\n10   fault with the district court's resolution of allegations of\n\n11   juror impropriety.   We also agree with the district court's\n\n12   treatment of confidential information, including its denial of\n\n13   Stewart's motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to the\n\n14   Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), its ex parte, in\n\n15   camera examination of FISA wiretap applications, and its\n\n16   rejection of Stewart's more general challenges to the\n\n17   constitutionality of FISA.   Finally, we find no fault with the\n\n18   district court's treatment, in accordance with the Classified\n\n19   Information Procedures Act (\"CIPA\"), of Stewart's motion to\n\n20   compel disclosure of information related to potential\n\n21   surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency.\n\n22             We therefore affirm the convictions in their entirety.\n\n23             We also affirm the sentences of Sattar and Yousry.    We\n\n24   conclude that the district court committed neither procedural\n\n25   error in calculating the applicable Guidelines ranges, nor\n\n26   substantive error in varying from those ranges pursuant to its\n\n                                     -6-\n\f1    consideration of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n2    We nonetheless remand their cases to the district court to allow\n\n3    it to reconsider their sentences should it choose to do so in\n\n4    light of the resentencing of Stewart.\n\n5              We cannot affirm Stewart's sentence on the basis of the\n\n6    record before us.   Because the district court declined to find\n\n7    whether Stewart committed perjury at trial, we cannot conclude\n\n8    that the mitigating factors found to support her sentence can\n\n9    reasonably bear the weight assigned to them.   This is so\n\n10   particularly in light of the seriousness of her criminal conduct,\n\n11   her responsibilities as a member of the bar, and her role as\n\n12   counsel for Abdel Rahman.   We therefore remand the cause to the\n\n13   district court for further consideration of her sentence, in\n\n14   light of, among other things, the charges of perjury against her\n\n15   and of any other matter it deems necessary or advisable, and\n\n16   direct the court to revoke Stewart's and Yousry's bail pending\n\n17   appeal and to order them to surrender to the United States\n\n18   Marshal to begin serving their sentences forthwith.\n\n19                               BACKGROUND\n\n20             The transcript of the trials in the cases on appeal\n\n21   runs in excess of thirteen thousand pages.   The district court\n\n22   issued nine opinions and a wide variety of orders addressing\n\n23   issues presented during the course of the proceedings.   See\n\n24   principally, United States v.

The measures also provided for the monitoring of all non-\n\n8    legal visits.   Id. ¶ 6.   On the condition that his attorneys\n\n9    would not divulge any information to third parties, Abdel Rahman\n\n10   was permitted to communicate with his legal team by telephone,\n\n11   id. ¶¶ 4(a) & 4(d), mail, id. ¶ 5(a), and in person, id. ¶ 6,\n\n12   with fewer restrictions than with other persons.    Members of this\n\n13   legal team included lawyers Ramsey Clark, Abdeen Jabara, Lawrence\n\n14   Schilling, and defendant Lynne Stewart.\n\n15              Subsequent versions of the SAMs retained similar\n\n16   prohibitions and screening mechanisms including the prohibition\n\n17   against communications with the news media.    See, e.g., SAMs of\n\n18   Apr. 7, 1999, ¶ 9; SAMs of Dec. 10, 1999, ¶ 9.    They retained\n\n19   similar provisions regarding legal communications, and\n\n20   incorporated provisions requiring Abdel Rahman's attorneys to\n\n21   sign affirmations acknowledging their receipt of the version of\n\n22   the SAMs in effect.   See, e.g., SAMs of Apr. 7, 1999, ¶ 4; SAMs\n\n23   of Dec. 10, 1999, ¶ 4.     By virtue of those affirmations, counsel\n\n24   agreed to abide by the terms of SAMs then in effect.    See, e.g.,\n\n25   Unsigned Affirmation of Abdeen Jabara, Apr. 2000; Unsigned\n\n26   Affirmation of Ramsey Clark, Apr. 2000; Affirmation of Ramsey\n\n                                      -12-\n\f1    Clark, Jan. 10, 2001; Affirmation of Abdeen Jabara, Jan. 10,\n\n2    2001; Affirmation of Ramsey Clark, Apr. 24, 1997.\n\n3              Stewart repeatedly executed such statements.     On May 1,\n\n4    1998, she signed a document entitled \"Attorney Affirmation,\" in\n\n5    which she affirmed, under penalty of perjury, the truth of\n\n6    specified statements regarding the then-applicable SAMs: that she\n\n7    had read the May 11, 1998, version of the SAMs; that she\n\n8    \"underst[ood] the restrictions contained in that document and\n\n9    agree[d] to abide by its terms\"; that during her visits to Abdel\n\n10   Rahman she would \"employ only cleared translators/interpreters\n\n11   and [would] not leave [any] translator/interpreter alone with\n\n12   inmate Abdel Rahman\"; and that she would \"only be accompanied by\n\n13   translators for the purpose of communicating with inmate Abdel\n\n14   Rahman concerning legal matters.\"      Affirmation of Lynne Stewart,\n\n15   May 1, 1998.   Stewart also affirmed that neither she nor any\n\n16   member of her office would \"forward any mail received from inmate\n\n17   Abdel Rahman to a third person\" nor would she \"use [her]\n\n18   meetings, correspondence or phone calls with Abdel Rahman to pass\n\n19   messages between third parties (including, but not limited to,\n\n20   the media) and Abdel Rahman.\"   Id.    On May 16, 2000, and again on\n\n21   May 7, 2001, Stewart signed similar affirmations under penalty of\n\n22   perjury, again affirming that she had read the most recent\n\n23   versions of the SAMs, and that she would not use her contact with\n\n24   Abdel Rahman to pass messages between him and third parties,\n\n25   including members of the media.

As a translator, Yousry was permitted to\n\n5    read to Abdel Rahman, who is blind, and to take dictation from\n\n6    him.\n\n7               Various members of the team, including Stewart and\n\n8    Yousry, also maintained contact with defendant Ahmed Abdel\n\n9    Sattar, who had served as a paralegal during Abdel Rahman's\n\n10   trial.   The evidence established that Sattar was in continual\n\n11   contact with various members of al-Gama'a abroad.    See, e.g.,\n\n12   Transcript of Conversation between Ahmed Abdel Sattar and Rifa'i\n\n13   Ahmad Taha Musa, May 9, 2000.\n\n14              The Visits to Abdel Rahman\n\n15              Sometime in 1997, more than three years after Abdel\n\n16   Rahman was taken into federal custody, a faction of al-Gama'a\n\n17   declared a unilateral \"cease-fire,\" i.e., a halting of violent\n\n18   operations, in Egypt.    When the cease-fire was first announced,\n\n19   Abdel Rahman was understood to support it.\n\n20              In November 1997, despite the cease-fire, a group\n\n21   associated with al-Gama'a attacked, killed, and mutilated the\n\n22   bodies of more than sixty tourists, guides, and guards at the\n\n23   Hatshepsut Temple in Luxor, Egypt.     Rifa'i Taha Musa (\"Taha\") --\n\n24   a military leader of al-Gama'a, a follower of Abdel Rahman, and\n\n25   an unindicted co-conspirator herein -- was involved in the\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f1    incident.4    Alaa Abdul Raziq Atia (\"Atia\"), later a leader of\n\n2    al-Gama'a's military wing in Egypt, was also involved in the\n\n3    killings.     Al-Gama'a later claimed responsibility for the attack\n\n4    and demanded Abdel Rahman's release from prison in the United\n\n5    States.\n\n6                 In January 1998, Abdel Rahman was assigned by the\n\n7    Bureau of Prisons to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester,\n\n8    Minnesota (\"FMC Rochester\").     In March 1999, Stewart and Yousry\n\n9    visited him there.     Prior to the visit, Stewart signed and\n\n10   delivered to the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern\n\n11   District of New York a document in which she affirmed, under\n\n12   penalty of perjury, that she would abide by the SAMs imposed by\n\n13   the Bureau of Prisons on Abdel Rahman.\n\n14                At about this time, defendant Sattar was in contact\n\n15   with members of al-Gama'a, who were divided over their support\n\n16   for what remained of the cease-fire.     Pro-cease-fire and anti-\n\n17   cease-fire factions developed, and members of the organization\n\n18   wanted Abdel Rahman to take a position on the matter.     To that\n\n19   end, several wrote messages addressed to Abdel Rahman, which they\n\n20   sent to Sattar for delivery to Abdel Rahman.     Sattar gave the\n\n21   messages to Stewart and Yousry, who surreptitiously brought the\n\n22   messages with them to Abdel Rahman during a subsequent visit in\n\n23   May 2000.\n\n\n          4\n            In 1998, Taha joined with Osama Bin Laden and Ayman Al-\n     Zawahiri to sign a fatwa entitled \"Jihad against the United\n     States and the Jews.\" See Translation of World Islamic Front's\n     Statement Urging Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f1               Yousry read the messages to Abdel Rahman during the\n\n2    visit, and Abdel Rahman dictated to Yousry responses to some of\n\n3    them.   Yousry and Stewart then smuggled the responses out of FMC\n\n4    Rochester among their legal papers, and sent them to Sattar.     As\n\n5    directed by Abdel Rahman, Sattar informed various members of al-\n\n6    Gama'a that Abdel Rahman was willing to reconsider the\n\n7    effectiveness of the cease-fire and had rejected the associated\n\n8    idea that al-Gama'a should form a political party in Egypt.\n\n9               News of Abdel Rahman's purported position spread.     But\n\n10   some members of the media in the Middle East expressed skepticism\n\n11   about the veracity of Sattar's representations, questioning\n\n12   whether they in fact came from Abdel Rahman or whether Sattar had\n\n13   fabricated them himself.   To refute those reports, Sattar and\n\n14   Yousry asked one of Abdel Rahman's lawyers, former United States\n\n15   Attorney General Ramsey Clark, to tell a reporter for an Arabic-\n\n16   language newspaper that Abdel Rahman opposed al-Gama'a's\n\n17   formation of a political party.    Clark, they thought, would be\n\n18   perceived as more authoritative than Sattar.    Clark eventually\n\n19   agreed to talk to the reporter.    He told the reporter that \"[t]he\n\n20   Sheikh has said he believes that the formation of a new political\n\n21   party to engage in politics in Egypt at this time is . . .     not\n\n22   correct and should not be done.\"    Transcript of Conversation\n\n23   between Ahmed Abdel Sattar, Mohammed Yousry, Ramsey Clark, and\n\n24   Muhammad Al-Shafi'i, Nov. 5, 1999, at 15.\n\n25              In September 1999, Farid Kidwani, the then-leader of\n\n26   al-Gama'a's military wing, was killed along with three other\n\n                                    -16-\n\f1    members of the group in a shootout with Egyptian police.\n\n2    Kidwani's death precipitated further tension and debate within\n\n3    al-Gama'a regarding the advisability and efficacy of the cease-\n\n4    fire.\n\n5               Taha sent another message to Sattar to be relayed to\n\n6    Abdel Rahman urging Abdel Rahman to support the termination of\n\n7    the cease-fire and noting that Taha and his associates needed a\n\n8    \"powerful word\" from Abdel Rahman to achieve this goal.    Taha\n\n9    told Sattar that such support from Abdel Rahman would \"strengthen\n\n10   me among the brothers.\"    Sattar agreed to send the message to\n\n11   Abdel Rahman and prepared a letter to Abdel Rahman for that\n\n12   purpose.   In mid-September 1999, Clark and Yousry surreptitiously\n\n13   took the letter, along with newspaper articles relating to the\n\n14   killing of Kidwani in Egypt, with them during a visit to Abdel\n\n15   Rahman in FMC Rochester.    Yousry read the letter and newspaper\n\n16   clippings aloud to Abdel Rahman.    From these documents, Abdel\n\n17   Rahman first learned of Kidwani's death.\n\n18              Abdel Rahman dictated a letter to Yousry in response.\n\n19              To those against whom war is made, permission\n20              is given to fight, because they are wronged\n21              (oppressed) -- and verily God is most\n22              powerful for their aid. . . . The latest\n23              thing published in the newspapers was about\n24              the Egyptian regime's killing of four members\n25              of the Group. This is . . . enough proof\n26              that the Egyptian regime does not have the\n27              intention to interact with this peaceful\n28              Initiative [i.e., the cease-fire] which aims\n29              at unification. I therefore demand that my\n30              brothers, the sons of [al-Gama'a] do a\n31              comprehensive review of the Initiative and\n32              its results. I also demand that they\n33              consider themselves absolved from it.\n\n                                     -17-\n\f1    Transcript of Conversation between Ahmed Abdel Sattar and Rifa'i\n\n2    Ahmad Taha Musa, Sep. 20, 1999, at 6-7 (emphasis omitted,\n\n3    parenthetical in original).   Sattar expected Clark to make a\n\n4    public statement to similar effect, but Clark declined to do so.\n\n5               On February 18 and 19, 2000, Yousry and Abdeen Jabara,\n\n6    an Arabic-speaking lawyer and member of Abdel Rahman's legal\n\n7    team, visited Abdel Rahman at FMC Rochester.   They brought with\n\n8    them another letter which included another message from Taha,\n\n9    again asking for Abdel Rahman's support for ending the cease-\n\n10   fire.   But Jabara would not permit Abdel Rahman to dictate a\n\n11   letter to Yousry in response.   And, notwithstanding pressure from\n\n12   Sattar and Taha, Jabara, like Clark before him, refused to issue\n\n13   any public statement regarding Abdel Rahman's position on the\n\n14   matter.\n\n15              On May 16, 2000, defendant Stewart signed another\n\n16   affirmation that she and her staff would abide by the SAMs.     She\n\n17   did not submit that affirmation to the United States Attorney's\n\n18   Office until May 26.\n\n19              On May 18, 2000, Stewart met with Sattar, who gave her\n\n20   more letters for Abdel Rahman, including another message from\n\n21   Taha yet again seeking Abdel Rahman's approval of an end to the\n\n22   cease-fire.   Taha asked Abdel Rahman to take a \"more forceful\n\n23   position\" regarding the end of the cease-fire and to \"dictate\n\n24   some points we can announce in a press conference with Lynne.\"\n\n25   Transcript of Second Audiovisual Recording involving Omar Abdel\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f1    Rahman, Mohammed Yousry, Lynne Stewart, and others, May 19, 2000,\n\n2    (\"Video Tr.

Yousry told Abdel Rahman that Abu\n\n8    Sayyaf -- an Islamic terrorist group in the Philippines -- had\n\n9    taken hostages to be used in bargaining for the release of Abdel\n\n10   Rahman and others.   When Yousry explained to Stewart that he was\n\n11   \"telling the Sheikh about the Abu Sayyaf group in the\n\n12   Philippines\" and how \"they took hostages,\" Stewart replied, \"Good\n\n13   for them.\"   Transcript of First Audiovisual Recording involving\n\n14   Omar Abdel Rahman, Mohammed Yousry, and Lynne Stewart, May 19,\n\n15   2000, at 27.\n\n16             From the beginning of the visit, Stewart was aware of\n\n17   the prison guards' presence.   For example, she asked Yousry, \"Do\n\n18   they usually sit like this and watch us?\"     Id. at 10.   And during\n\n19   this meeting, Stewart and Yousry took overt steps to ensure that\n\n20   the nature of their communication with Abdel Rahman would be\n\n21   concealed from the prison guards.     As she suggested to Yousry,\n\n22   they \"should give them [i.e., the guards] something to watch.\"\n\n\n\n          5\n            Similar citations to transcripts of audiovisual recordings\n     of prison visits to Abdel Rahman will follow the same format,\n     i.e., \"Video Tr.

When the guards were standing close to the window of\n\n2    the conference room in which Abdel Rahman, Stewart, and Yousry,\n\n3    were meeting Yousry told Stewart to \"look at me and talk a little\n\n4    bit because they are watching us closely.\"      Id. at 51.   While\n\n5    Yousry read the message to Abdel Rahman, Stewart uttered a\n\n6    meaningless series of phrases to Yousry so that it would appear\n\n7    to an observer as though she was taking part in a three-way\n\n8    conversation:    \"I am talking to you about. . . him going to have\n\n9    a, uh, chocolate eh . . .   heart attack here . . . .     Why don't\n\n10   you stop a minute now.   And (UI)6 say to him that, you know, 'You\n\n11   understood what we are saying, (UI).'\"    Id.    As Stewart spoke,\n\n12   Yousry said to Abdel Rahman, \"I don't know, Sir, they are\n\n13   standing very close by the glass. . . .      Lynne says, (UI) when\n\n14   they look, you look at me a little, talk, then look at the\n\n15   Sheikh.\"   Id.\n\n16              Stewart continued to talk while Yousry read aloud\n\n17   Taha's statement in Sattar's letter.   Yousry explained to Abdel\n\n18   Rahman that \"Lynne just says anything, [laughing] (UI) Sir.\"         Id.\n\n19   at 52 (bracketed material in original).      Stewart remarked, \"I can\n\n20   get an academy award for it.\"   Id.\n\n21              Stewart and Yousry then had this exchange:\n\n22              YOUSRY: . . . Lynne, I think you should talk\n23              to him because they are looking at me.\n\n\n\n\n          6\n              \"UI\" stands for \"unintelligible.\"\n\n                                     -20-\n\f1              STEWART: (UI) there (UI), they, uh, (UI). . .\n2              [she taps Yousry's pad with her pen]7 uhm, if\n3              he finds out what this is, then we’re . . .\n4              [Laughs.]\n\n5              YOUSRY: [Laughs] In trouble.\n\n6              STEWART: [Laughing] Yeah, that's right.\n\n\n7    Video Tr. May 19, 2000, Tape 2, at 29 (brackets in original).\n\n8              Stewart and Yousry also took evasive action when a\n\n9    guard appeared to take interest in their conversation.        At one\n\n10   point, while Yousry was conversing with Abdel Rahman, Stewart\n\n11   touched Yousry's hand and said \"Why don't you stop there and\n\n12   we'll talk a minute um, the, uh. . . .     Ahmed's youngest son\n\n13   needs glasses, did you know that?\"     Id. at 30.    Yousry then\n\n14   explained to Abdel Rahman, \"Lynne says, stop a little because\n\n15   they are by the glass.\"   Id.   Not long afterwards, Stewart tapped\n\n16   with the pen on the paper in front of Yousry and told him to\n\n17   \"continue reading this 'cause this is setting up the\n\n18   organizational system around his conditions.\"       Id.   Yousry\n\n19   continued reading.   Stewart then made a series of statements\n\n20   unrelated to the substance of the conversation between Yousry and\n\n21   Abdel Rahman.   Yousry kept Abdel Rahman informed of what Yousry\n\n22   and Stewart were doing, noting that \"Lynne continues to eh, she's\n\n23   watching them, she's watching them,\" to which Abdel Rahman\n\n24   replied, \"[v]ery good, very good.\"     Id. at 33.

Video\n\n9    Tr. May 20, 2000, Tape 2, at 32.\n\n10             Meanwhile, Stewart and Yousry continued to engage in\n\n11   what Stewart later called \"[c]overing noises,\" Video Tr. July 13,\n\n12   2001, Tape 2, at 12, and other tactics designed to obscure the\n\n13   nature of what they were doing.     After one such incident, Yousry\n\n14   explained to Abdel Rahman, \"[S]he just has to say that in order\n\n15   to break the . . .   The people are looking.\"    Video Tr. May 20,\n\n16   2000, Tape 1, at 14.     Stewart told Yousry, \"I am making\n\n17   allowances for them looking in at us and seeing me never speaking\n\n18   and writing away here while you talk Arabic.\"     Id. at 17.   She\n\n19   then directed Yousry to \"talk back to me now, because otherwise\n\n20   it doesn't make any sense. . . .     So say something in\n\n21   English . . . .\"   Id.

Sattar then passed them\n\n2    along to Taha and another member of al-Gama'a.      Sattar also spoke\n\n3    to various members of al-Gama'a, informing them that Abdel Rahman\n\n4    would have \"no objection\" to a return to violence.

Sattar and Stewart first\n\n10   discussed what Stewart would say to the press.      Then, on June 13,\n\n11   2000, Sattar and Stewart spoke to Esmat Salaheddin, a Reuters\n\n12   reporter based in Cairo.   Stewart told Salaheddin that Abdel\n\n13   Rahman \"is withdrawing his support for the ceasefire that\n\n14   currently exists.\"   Trial Transcript (\"Trial Tr.\") at 5574, 5617,\n\n15   testimony of Salaheddin.   She explained that Abdel Rahman had\n\n16   made the statement from prison two weeks before.\n\n17             The next day, other Middle Eastern press outlets\n\n18   carried the news that Abdel Rahman had withdrawn his support for\n\n19   the cease-fire.   Many noted that for the cease-fire to hold,\n\n20   Abdel Rahman's support was essential.\n\n21             On June 20, 2000, Stewart participated in a telephone\n\n22   conference with Abdel Rahman.   She then sent another statement on\n\n23   Abdel Rahman's behalf via facsimile to Salaheddin, the Reuters\n\n24   reporter in Cairo.   The telecopy said, \"Everything said in the\n\n25   previous statements is correct\" and quoted Abdel Rahman as\n\n26   saying, \"I do withdraw my support to the [cease-fire]\n\n                                     -23-\n\f1    initiative.\"    Statement for Release, Abdel Rahman, June 20, 2000.\n\n2    Following Stewart's statements on Abdel Rahman's behalf, several\n\n3    members of al-Gama'a began preparations to engage anew in acts of\n\n4    violence.\n\n5                On October 4, 2000, Sattar and Taha completed a fatwa\n\n6    on Abdel Rahman's behalf, imitating his style, \"mandating the\n\n7    killing of the Israelis everywhere\" and \"the killing [of] the\n\n8    Jews wherever they are (UI) and wherever they are found.\"\n\n9    Transcript of Audio Recording of Ahmed Abdel Sattar and Yassir\n\n10   Al-Sirri Oct. 4, 2000, (\"Audio Tr.

But, on October 19,\n\n4    2000, before Atia could act, the Egyptian authorities raided his\n\n5    hideout, killing him and killing or arresting other al-Gama'a\n\n6    members.\n\n7                 On July 13 and 14, 2001, Stewart again paid a visit to\n\n8    Abdel Rahman at FMC Rochester, having signed a revised\n\n9    affirmation agreeing to abide by the SAMs and having sent the\n\n10   affirmation by facsimile to the United States Attorney's Office\n\n11   for the Southern District of New York on May 7, 2001.     Stewart\n\n12   again, with Yousry's assistance and contrary to provisions of the\n\n13   SAMs, surreptitiously brought messages to and from Abdel Rahman.\n\n14                Procedural History\n\n15                On April 8, 2002, the defendants were indicted in\n\n16   connection with these and related acts; a superseding indictment\n\n17   was filed on November 19, 2003.

Evidence as to Stewart.   Stewart argues that her\n\n6    defiance of the SAMs was open, not deceitful.      One aspect of her\n\n7    defiance was undoubtedly public -- the conveyance of Abdel\n\n8    Rahman's statements regarding the cease-fire and related matters\n\n9    to the Reuters journalist.     But we agree with the district court\n\n10   that \"[a] reasonable jury could certainly [have found] that\n\n11   Stewart gained access to Abdel Rahman [and thereby the\n\n12   information that she conveyed to the journalist] by deceit and\n\n13   dishonest means.\"     Sattar V, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 89.   \"Without\n\n14   [Stewart's] agreement to abide by the SAMs and the other\n\n15   representations contained in her affirmations, she knew that she\n\n16   would not have been allowed to visit Abdel Rahman,\" id.; see also\n\n17   id. at 84-89, and therefore would not later have been able to\n\n18   defy the regulations openly by publicizing messages on his\n\n19   behalf.\n\n20               Stewart insists that she acted with the intent, not to\n\n21   defraud the government, but to \"zealously\" represent her\n\n22   client.10   But the jury had a reasonable basis on which to\n\n\n          10\n             The word \"zealot,\" taken from a first century A.D. anti-\n     Roman Jewish movement, carries with it overtones of fanaticism,\n     see The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 2000\n     (4th ed. 2000). The American Heritage Dictionary lists as\n     principal definitions: \"1a. One who is zealous, especially\n                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                      -29-\n\f1    disbelieve this, and to \"disbelieve that zealous representation\n\n2    included filing false affirmations, hiding from prison guards the\n\n3    delivery of messages to Abdel Rahman, and the dissemination of\n\n4    responses by him that were obtained through dishonesty.\"     Id. at\n\n5    90.   Moreover, even if Stewart acted with an intent to represent\n\n6    her client zealously, a rational jury could nonetheless have\n\n7    concluded that Stewart simultaneously acted with an intent to\n\n8    defraud the government.    A genuinely held intent to represent a\n\n9    client \"zealously\" is not necessarily inconsistent with criminal\n\n10   intent.\n\n11               2. Evidence as to Yousry.   Yousry argues that, as a\n\n12   translator who was taking direction from others, he did only what\n\n13   he was told to do and acted in good-faith reliance on the\n\n14   guidance and conduct of the members of the bar for whom he\n\n15   worked.    Based on the evidence admitted at trial, however, a\n\n16   rational jury could have found that Yousry knew of and understood\n\n17   the terms of the SAMs.\n\n\n\n\n           10\n           (...continued)\n     excessively so. b. A fanatically committed person.\" Id.\n          The word has historically been used as a positive\n     commandment, however, with respect to the ethical obligations of\n     members of the bar. Until recently, for example, Canon 7 of the\n     New York Lawyer's Code of Professional Responsibility provided:\n     \"A Lawyer Should Represent a Client Zealously Within the Bounds\n     of the Law.\" It is in that sense that we understand Stewart to\n     use the term here.\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f1              Yousry had in his possession the December 1999 version\n\n2    of the SAMs as well as a copy of the underlying regulations.\n\n3    That version of the SAMs provided that Abdel Rahman's legal team\n\n4    could pass along to him \"only inmate case-related\n\n5    correspondence,\" and set forth a process for screening all non-\n\n6    legal mail.   SAMs of Dec. 10, 1999, ¶ 7.    The SAMs in Yousry's\n\n7    possession also specifically prohibited Abdel Rahman's\n\n8    communication with news media \"in person, by telephone, by\n\n9    furnishing a recorded message, through the mails, through his\n\n10   attorney(s), or otherwise.\"    Id. ¶ 9.   Yousry himself\n\n11   acknowledged that members of the legal team were not \"to disclose\n\n12   any portion of their conversation with the Sheik to the media.\"\n\n13   Excerpts from Draft of Dissertation of Mohammed Yousry at 29.\n\n14   Yousry also knew that Clark and Jabara had refused to relay\n\n15   messages from Abdel Rahman.\n\n16             From this evidence, a reasonable factfinder could\n\n17   conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Yousry knew that his\n\n18   assistance, by providing translation services, in facilitating\n\n19   Abdel Rahman's continued contact with members of al-Gama'a\n\n20   violated the SAMs.   Moreover, as with Stewart, Yousry's deceptive\n\n21   and evasive conduct during the course of his visits to Abdel\n\n22   Rahman undercuts his claim of good faith.\n\n23             Yousry argues that the evidence established, at most,\n\n24   that he intended to violate the SAMs, not that he knew that doing\n\n25   so might constitute a crime.    But even if he misunderstood the\n\n                                     -31-\n\f1    law in that respect, such a mistake provides no defense to a\n\n2    charge of criminal misbehavior.      See Cheek v. United States, 498\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (1991).    The fact that Yousry was aware that his\n\n4    acts, in knowing violation of the SAMs, would defraud the\n\n5    government is sufficient to sustain the conviction.     The\n\n6    government need not also prove that he knew that there was a\n\n7    criminal statute -- 18 U.S.C. § 371 -- that criminalized such\n\n8    behavior.    \"The general rule that ignorance of the law or a\n\n9    mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution is deeply\n\n10   rooted in the American legal system.\"     Cheek, 498 U.S. at 199.\n\n11   B. Propriety of the SAMs\n\n12               1. Stewart's Argument.   Stewart contends that the\n\n13   district court erred by preventing her from challenging the\n\n14   validity of the SAMs as part of her defense.     She sought to argue\n\n15   that the Attorney General has no authority to have lawyers held\n\n16   criminally liable for violating the SAMs and that the SAMs are\n\n17   unconstitutionally vague as applied to her.

The likelihood that he would continue\n\n5    to order, direct, or encourage such acts from prison, if he\n\n6    could, was plain, and his incapacitation reasonably required not\n\n7    just his physical immobility, but also his virtual silence vis-à-\n\n8    vis the world at large.\n\n9              Stewart might have effectively challenged the SAMs by\n\n10   refusing to sign the affirmations in which she said she would\n\n11   abide by them.

She might have argued -- as she\n\n14   forcefully does here -- that the SAMs interfered with her\n\n15   capacity to effectively represent Rahman.   But she did not.\n\n16   Instead, she signed the affirmations.   Having chosen that path,\n\n17   she cannot be heard to attack the validity of those measures when\n\n18   called to account for violating them, especially where, as here,\n\n19   her fraudulent and deceptive conduct endangered people's lives.\n\n20              The district court did not err in preventing Stewart\n\n21   from challenging the validity of the SAMs as part of her defense,\n\n22   and the jury acted within its province when it found that Stewart\n\n23   intentionally and fraudulently subverted them.\n\n24             2. Sattar's Related Arguments on Appeal.   Sattar relies\n\n25   on Stewart's and Yousry's arguments with respect to Count One.\n\n                                    -35-\n\f1    For the reasons set forth above addressing those arguments, we\n\n2    conclude that they are also unpersuasive as applied to him.\n\n3              III.    Counts Two and Three\n\n4              Only Sattar was charged in Counts Two and Three of the\n\n5    superseding indictment.    He does not challenge the sufficiency of\n\n6    the evidence supporting his Count Two conviction for conspiring\n\n7    with Abdel Rahman, Taha, and others to murder persons in a\n\n8    foreign country, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 956.13   Instead, he\n\n9    asserts that the district court should have dismissed this count\n\n10   on the grounds of vindictive prosecution.    Similarly, Sattar does\n\n11   not challenge his conviction on Count Three for soliciting\n\n12   persons to engage in crimes of violence -- murder and conspiracy\n\n13   to commit murder -- in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 373.14    He argues\n\n14   instead that he was denied a fair trial.    These arguments are\n\n15   addressed below in the context of the defendants' more general\n\n16   challenges to the probity of the proceedings.\n\n17             IV.    Counts Four and Five\n\n18             Stewart and Yousry challenge their Count Five\n\n19   convictions for violating 18 U.S.C. § 2339A and 18 U.S.C. § 2 by\n\n20   providing and concealing material support for the Count-Two\n\n21   conspiracy for which Sattar was convicted and their Count Four\n\n\n          13\n             By special verdict, the jury concluded that the object\n     of the Count-Two conspiracy was murder, not kidnaping.\n          14\n             By special verdict, the jury concluded that the crimes\n     of violence Sattar solicited were murder and conspiracy to\n     murder.\n\n                                     -36-\n\f1    convictions for conspiracy to provide and conceal such support,\n\n2    in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.     They argue that the evidence\n\n3    was insufficient to support their conviction on either count, and\n\n4    contend that their conduct was constitutionally protected in any\n\n5    event.\n\n6    A. History of the Charges\n\n7                 By way of background, the initial indictment charged\n\n8    all three defendants with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2339B.15     The\n\n9    defendants argued before the district court that \"18 U.S.C.\n\n10   § 2339B is unconstitutionally vague . . . with regard to the\n\n11   statute's prohibition on providing material support or resources\n\n12   in the form of communications equipment and personnel.\"     Sattar\n\n13   I, 272 F. Supp. 2d at 356 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n14   The district court agreed, and therefore dismissed those charges.\n\n15   Id. at 361.16\n\n16                The government then filed a superseding indictment\n\n17   alleging that by essentially the same course of conduct, i.e.,\n\n18   coordinating the surreptitious passage of al-Gama'a messages to\n\n19   and from Abdel Rahman, Stewart and Yousry violated 18 U.S.C.\n\n\n           15\n             At the time of the relevant offense conduct, section\n     2339B provided, in relevant part, that \"[w]hoever, within the\n     United States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United\n     States, knowingly provides material support or resources to a\n     foreign terrorist organization, or attempts or conspires to do\n     so, shall be [guilty of a crime.]\" 18 U.S.C. § 2339B(a)(1)\n     (2000).\n           16\n                The constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B is not before\n     us.\n\n                                       -37-\n\f1    § 2339A.17    The relevant version of section 2339A, entitled\n\n2    \"Providing material support to terrorists,\" provided in relevant\n\n3    part:\n\n 4                Whoever, within the United States, provides\n 5                material support or resources or conceals or\n 6                disguises the nature, location, source, or\n 7                ownership of material support or resources,\n 8                knowing or intending that they are to be used\n 9                in preparation for, or in carrying out, a\n10                violation of [various enumerated statutes\n11                related to terrorism] or in preparation for,\n12                or in carrying out, the concealment of an\n13                escape from the commission of any such\n14                violation, or attempts or conspires to do\n15                such an act, shall be [subject to criminal\n16                punishment].\n\n17   18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (2000).     For purposes of both sections 2339A\n\n18   and 2339B, \"material support or resources\" may be provided in the\n\n19   form of:\n\n20                currency or other financial securities,\n21                financial services, lodging, training,\n22                safehouses, false documentation or\n23                identification, communications equipment,\n24                facilities, weapons, lethal substances,\n25                explosives, personnel, transportation, and\n26                other physical assets, except medicine or\n27                religious materials.\n\n28   18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b)(1) (2000); see also id. § 2339B(g)(4) (2000)\n\n29   (\"[T]he term 'material support or resources' has the same meaning\n\n30   given that term in section 2339A . . . .\").     Section 2339A,\n\n31   however, in contrast to section 2339B, does not penalize the\n\n\n\n             17\n             The superseding indictment did not charge Sattar with\n     violating section 2339B; instead, he was charged with conspiracy\n     to murder persons in a foreign country in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n     § 956, i.e., Count Two.\n\n                                      -38-\n\f1    provision of material support without regard to what the support\n\n2    is for.    Section 2339A requires instead that the defendant\n\n3    provide support or resources with the knowledge or intent that\n\n4    such resources be used to commit specific violent crimes.18\n\n5               The government charged that the defendants provided\n\n6    \"material support or resources\" in the form of \"personnel\" --\n\n7    namely, Abdel Rahman -- to the Count-Two conspiracy, knowing or\n\n8    intending that Abdel Rahman, as an active co-conspirator, would\n\n9    help commit crimes.    See Sattar III, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 296.   The\n\n10   government further asserted that Stewart and Yousry \"conceal[ed]\n\n11   and disguise[d] the nature, location, and source\" of their\n\n12   material support by means of the defendants' covert conduct\n\n13   disguising Abdel Rahman's participation as a co-conspirator.     See\n\n14   id.   The government had initially argued that Stewart and Yousry\n\n15   could be convicted for providing themselves as \"personnel\" to a\n\n16   foreign terrorist organization and by providing communications\n\n17   equipment to the conspiracy.    After the dismissal of the section\n\n18   2339B charges and following the filing of the superseding\n\n19   indictment, however, the government abandoned those contentions.\n\n20   See id.\n\n\n\n           18\n            Section 2339B criminalizes the knowing provision of\n     material support. See 18 U.S.C. § 2339B(a)(1) (2000). Section\n     2339A criminalizes the provision of material support knowing or\n     intending that such support is used to aid crimes of terrorism.\n     See 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (2000). Therefore, the mental state in\n     section 2339A extends both to the support itself, and to the\n     underlying purposes for which the support is given.\n\n                                     -39-\n\f1                As an initial matter, Stewart and Yousry challenge the\n\n2    sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions on this\n\n3    count.    They also argue that the district court erroneously\n\n4    instructed the jury on the elements of a violation of section\n\n5    2339A.    In addition, they raise more general challenges to the\n\n6    statute, arguing that section 2339A does not criminalize the\n\n7    behavior alleged in the indictment, that the provision is\n\n8    unconstitutional as a multi-level inchoate offense, and that the\n\n9    statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.      We\n\n10   examine their arguments in the context of the statutory elements\n\n11   of the crime, addressing first the sufficiency arguments.\n\n12   B. Elements of Section 2339A\n13\n14               1. Proof of the Underlying Conspiracy to Kill Persons\n\n15   Abroad.19   There was sufficient evidence of the existence of the\n\n16   predicate crime -- the Count-Two conspiracy to kill or kidnap --\n\n17   for which Sattar was convicted.    Indeed Sattar, the only\n\n18   defendant charged with and convicted of participating in the\n\n19   Count-Two conspiracy, does not challenge the sufficiency of the\n\n20   evidence as to this count.\n\n21               The government offered evidence that Sattar and Taha\n\n22   composed a fatwa in Abdel Rahman's name calling for \"the killing\n\n23   [of] the Jews wherever they are (UI) and wherever they are\n\n\n\n          19\n             As noted above, the jury found that the underlying\n     conspiracy involved the murder, not the kidnaping, of persons\n     abroad.\n\n                                     -40-\n\f1    found.\"   Audio Tr. Oct. 4, at 15.     It also offered proof that\n\n2    this fatwa was communicated to Atia, an al-Gama'a military\n\n3    leader.   Although the evidence may not have established any\n\n4    particular plan of action to execute the fatwa, a reasonable jury\n\n5    could have found beyond a reasonable doubt from the fatwa's\n\n6    exhortations and Atia's readiness to act on it that there was a\n\n7    concrete, illegal objective to murder persons abroad.\n\n8                A review of the transcripts of various intercepted\n\n9    telephone conversations introduced into evidence, particularly\n\n10   the September 18, 2000, conversation involving Sattar, Taha, and\n\n11   another party, bolsters this conclusion.      The discussion goes\n\n12   well beyond the abstract and contemplates the coordination with\n\n13   Atia of violent actions, presumably along the lines of the Luxor\n\n14   massacre.    In light of such evidence, a rational jury could have\n\n15   found beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy as charged in\n\n16   Count Two existed.\n\n17               2. Proof of Material Support to the Conspiracy.\n\n18   Stewart and Yousry also assert that they did not provide material\n\n19   support in the form of \"personnel\" to the Count-Two conspiracy.\n\n20   A reasonable jury could have concluded otherwise.      There was\n\n21   evidence introduced at trial sufficient to support a reasonable\n\n22   juror's inference that Stewart and Yousry helped Abdel Rahman\n\n23   participate covertly in the conspiracy to engage in violence\n\n24   abroad by communicating to members of al-Gama'a and others his\n\n25   withdrawal of support for the cease-fire.      Abdel Rahman's\n\n                                     -41-\n\f1    instrumental participation -- indeed, his leadership -- would, as\n\n2    the district court observed, have been unavailable to the Count-\n\n3    Two conspiracy \"without the active participation of Stewart and\n\n4    Yousry.\"   Sattar V, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 95.\n\n5               The defendants argue that the government established\n\n6    only that they provided the underlying conspiracy with Abdel\n\n7    Rahman's \"pure speech\" and therefore did not provide \"personnel\"\n\n8    within any constitutional interpretation of section 2339A.   The\n\n9    government does not deny that section 2339A may not be used to\n\n10   prosecute mere advocacy or other protected speech, but contends\n\n11   that the defendants were prosecuted for criminal actions that did\n\n12   not amount to protected speech.\n\n13              Resolution of this dispute does not turn on whether the\n\n14   prosecution introduced evidence of \"pure speech.\"   \"Numerous\n\n15   crimes under the federal criminal code are, or can be, committed\n\n16   by speech alone,\" and certain crimes \"are characteristically\n\n17   committed through speech.\"   Rahman, 189 F.3d at 117.   The issue\n\n18   is, instead, whether Abdel Rahman's statements were protected\n\n19   speech.    We conclude that the statements were not protected such\n\n20   as to cast doubt on the convictions.\n\n21              Words that are \"the very vehicle of [a] crime\" are not\n\n22   protected \"merely because, in part, [the crimes] may have\n\n23   involved the use of language.\"    United States v.

For example, in\n\n15   reaffirming that he was withdrawing his support for the cease-\n\n16   fire, Abdel Rahman said that he had \"expressed [his] opinion and\n\n17   left the matters to [his] brothers to examine it and study it.\"\n\n18   Statement for Release, Abdel Rahman, June 20, 2000.\n\n19               But a reasonable jury could have found, in light of\n\n20   Abdel Rahman's role as \"spiritual\" leader of al-Gama'a, that his\n\n21   messages were ultimately intended to sway al-Gama'a members to\n\n22   end the cease-fire, and by implication to commit criminal acts of\n\n23   violence.    Abdel Rahman's statements were therefore not an\n\n24   expression of opinion, but a call to arms.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\f1              The evidence establishes, moreover, more than a one-way\n\n2    broadcast of Abdel Rahman's views.    Abdel Rahman's comments were\n\n3    made in direct response to solicitations of his views from other\n\n4    al-Gama'a members who were seeking to effect an end to the cease-\n\n5    fire and to resume violence.   In light of the information\n\n6    available to Abdel Rahman at the time, a reasonable jury could\n\n7    have read his statements as tailored to and necessary for\n\n8    al-Gama'a's operations and increased use of violence.   Viewed\n\n9    through this lens, Abdel Rahman's statements were not materially\n\n10   different in substance from a crime boss making decisions about\n\n11   his criminal enterprise from prison and ordering a \"hit.\"\n\n12             3. Proof Regarding Knowing or Intentional Provision of\n\n13   Material Support.   Stewart and Yousry argue that the prosecution\n\n14   did not prove the requisite mental state to sustain their\n\n15   convictions.   They contend that they were not aware of the\n\n16   existence of the conspiracy charged in Count Two and therefore\n\n17   could not have intended to aid it.\n\n18             These arguments are unavailing.   From the evidence at\n\n19   trial, a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that Stewart\n\n20   and Yousry knew (1) that an active group of people within\n\n21   al-Gama'a including, most notably, Taha, sought to commit violent\n\n22   crimes but were hindered by the cease-fire and by those members\n\n23   of al-Gama'a who sought to adhere to it; (2) that the support of\n\n24   Abdel Rahman -- a key leader of the group -- was critical to the\n\n25   continued maintenance of the cease-fire; and (3) that, in light\n\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\f1    of the letters and messages from Taha and Sattar that Yousry read\n\n2    to Abdel Rahman in prison, Abdel Rahman's particular opinion\n\n3    regarding the cease-fire -- and not the view of any other person\n\n4    -- would be dispositive on the question of whether al-Gama'a\n\n5    members would continue to abide by the cease-fire.   A reasonable\n\n6    factfinder could thus have concluded that Yousry and Stewart\n\n7    actively and intentionally facilitated communications between\n\n8    Abdel Rahman and al-Gama'a, in part by engaging in various ruses\n\n9    during the course of their visits to Abdel Rahman, and thereby\n\n10   effectively delivered Abdel Rahman's order to commit violence.\n\n11   Stewart also did so by reaffirming to the press Abdel Rahman's\n\n12   stated withdrawal of support for the cease-fire, thereby\n\n13   dispelling any notion that the message came not from Abdel Rahman\n\n14   himself, but was instead fabricated by members of the pro-\n\n15   violence faction of al-Gama'a.\n\n16   C. Other Challenges with Respect to 18 U.S.C. § 2339A\n\n17             1. Vagueness.   Section 2339A criminalizes the provision\n\n18   of material support or resources \"knowing or intending\" that they\n\n19   are to be used to assist in certain enumerated crimes of\n\n20   terrorism.   18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (full text set forth on page\n\n21   [38], supra).   Stewart and Yousry assert that insofar as the\n\n22   statute does not require \"conscious, knowing intent\" or\n\n23   \"knowledge and intent,\" the statute is unconstitutionally vague\n\n24   as applied to them.   They argue that the district court should\n\n25   have dismissed the section 2339A charges for substantially the\n\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\f1    same reasons that it dismissed the section 2339B charges that\n\n2    were contained in the initial indictment.    The government urges\n\n3    to the contrary that the text of section 2339A, which requires\n\n4    \"knowing or intending,\" 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (emphasis added), is\n\n5    sufficiently precise.\n\n6                In analyzing the defendants' arguments in this regard,\n\n7    we must focus on two major differences between the initial and\n\n8    superseding indictment.\n\n9                First, the statutes upon which they were based differ.\n\n10   Unlike section 2339A, section 2339B penalizes the knowing\n\n11   provision of material support alone.    Unlike section 2339A,\n\n12   section 2339B does not require for conviction proof that the\n\n13   defendant has provided support or resources with the knowledge or\n\n14   intent that such resources be used to commit specific violent\n\n15   crimes.20\n\n16               Second, the factual bases for the charges differ.   In\n\n17   the initial indictment, the government alleged that the\n\n18   defendants violated section 2339B by the \"provision\" of\n\n19   \"communications equipment\" to the conspiracy, Sattar I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">20</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   Supp. 2d at 357, and the \"provision\" of themselves as \"personnel\"\n\n21   to the conspiracy, id. at 358.    In the superseding indictment,\n\n22   the government charged instead that the defendants acted with the\n\n23   \"knowledge or intent\" to provide material support.    And rather\n\n\n          20\n            As already noted, the propriety   of the district court's\n     dismissal of the section 2339B charges   from the initial\n     indictment is not before us; we assume   for purposes of this\n     discussion that the district court was   correct.\n                                      -46-\n\f1    than proceeding on the theory that the defendants provided\n\n2    themselves as \"personnel\" to the conspiracy, the superseding\n\n3    indictment alleges that the defendants provided Abdel Rahman as\n\n4    the \"personnel.\"\n\n5              As we have explained, the district court dismissed the\n\n6    section 2339B charges on the ground that they were\n\n7    unconstitutional as applied to the defendants.      The basis for\n\n8    dismissal of the \"communications equipment\" charges was that the\n\n9    statute, as read to apply to the facts of this case, could\n\n10   \"criminaliz[e] the mere use of phones and other means of\n\n11   communication [with] neither notice nor standards for [the\n\n12   statute's] application.\"      Id.   And the basis for the dismissal of\n\n13   the \"personnel\" charges, as framed in the initial indictment, was\n\n14   that such a charge could criminalize the actions of \"'[s]omeone\n\n15   who advocates the cause of the [Foreign Terrorist\n\n16   Organization].'\"    Id. at 359 (quoting Humanitarian Law Project v.\n\n17   Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767936\"><a href=\"/opinion/767936/humanitarian-law-project-ralph-fertig-ilankai-thamil-sangam-tamils-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1137 (9th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   904 (2001)) (brackets omitted).       Without more, the district court\n\n19   concluded, such conduct cannot be punished without violating the\n\n20   First Amendment.    See id.\n\n21             The initial charges raised the possibility, moreover,\n\n22   that under the government's reading of the statute, \"a lawyer,\n\n23   acting as an agent of her client, an alleged leader of an FTO,\n\n24   could [be] subject to criminal prosecution as a 'quasi-\n\n25   employee.'\"   Id.   As we shall see, the charges in the superseding\n\n26   indictment do not pose this risk.\n\n                                         -47-\n\f1               A statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied \"if it\n\n2    fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable\n\n3    opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\" or \"if it\n\n4    authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory\n\n5    enforcement.\"   Hill v.

As a general matter,\n\n8    scienter requirements may \"ameliorate[]\" concerns of improper\n\n9    notice.   See Hill, 530 U.S. at 732.\n\n10              We are satisfied that section 2339A's knowledge-or-\n\n11   intent formulation saves the statute from being\n\n12   unconstitutionally vague as applied here.   Unlike the application\n\n13   of section 2339B proposed in the initial indictment, the\n\n14   superseding indictment required the jury to find that the\n\n15   defendants knew or intended the criminal uses to which the\n\n16   conspiracy would put the material support they provided, thereby\n\n17   eliminating concerns about inadequate notice.   In other words, if\n\n18   Stewart and Yousry knew that their actions provided material\n\n19   support to a conspiracy to end the cease-fire and thereby unloose\n\n20   deadly acts of terrorism by al-Gama'a and others, then they were\n\n21   on notice that what they were doing was prohibited by a statute\n\n22   that criminalizes the provision of material support \"knowing or\n\n23   intending that [such support is] to be used in preparation for,\n\n24   or in carrying out,\" criminal actions.   18 U.S.C. § 2339A.\n\n25              Stewart and Yousry argue nonetheless that several\n\n26   statutory terms, such as \"personnel,\" are unconstitutionally\n\n                                    -48-\n\f1    vague as applied to them.    They note that \"personnel,\" undefined\n\n2    at the relevant time, applies equally to sections 2339A and\n\n3    2339B, compare id. § 2339A(b)(1) (2000) with id. § 2339B(g)(4)\n\n4    (2000).21   They point out that the district court held this term\n\n5    to be unconstitutionally vague in Sattar I.      See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">6</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">    at 360.\n\n7                We agree, however, with the district court's conclusion\n\n8    that \"[t]he meaning of 'personnel' is clear in the context of\n\n9    § 2339A when applied to personnel who are to be used in\n\n10   preparation for, or in carrying out, specific crimes.\"      Sattar\n\n11   III, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 301 n.11.      By applying, in the first\n\n\n          21\n            At the time of the alleged criminal acts, \"personnel\" was\n     undefined. In December 2004, the term \"personnel\" was changed to\n     \"personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include\n     oneself).\" See Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act,\n     Pub. L. No. 108-458, § 6603(b), 118 Stat. 3638, 3762 (codified at\n     18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b)(1)). By the same act, the term was defined\n     in more detail for purposes of section 2339B:\n\n                 No person may be prosecuted under [section\n                 2339B] in connection with the term\n                 \"personnel\" unless that person has knowingly\n                 provided, attempted to provide, or conspired\n                 to provide a foreign terrorist organization\n                 with 1 or more individuals (who may be or\n                 include himself) to work under that terrorist\n                 organization's direction or control or to\n                 organize, manage, supervise, or otherwise\n                 direct the operation of that organization.\n                 Individuals who act entirely independently of\n                 the foreign terrorist organization to advance\n                 its goals or objectives shall not be\n                 considered to be working under the foreign\n                 terrorist organization's direction and\n                 control.\n\n     Id. § 6603(f),118 Stat. at 3763 (codified at 18 U.S.C.\n     § 2339B(h)). This amended definition applies to section 2339B\n     but not to section 2339A.\n                                     -49-\n\f1    indictment, the prohibition against providing \"personnel\" to the\n\n2    conspiracy to a circumstance in which the defendants provided\n\n3    themselves, the government created a situation in which the\n\n4    defendants could be punished for, in effect, providing themselves\n\n5    to speak out in support of the program or principles of a foreign\n\n6    terrorist organization, an activity protected by the First\n\n7    Amendment.    See Sattar I, 272 F. Supp. 2d at 359.   The more\n\n8    limited charge that they knowingly or intentionally provided\n\n9    Abdel Rahman (as \"personnel\"), whose voice of command or words of\n\n10   approbation were a means by which al-Gama'a members could prepare\n\n11   for, or carry out, terrorist acts in Egypt, does not carry the\n\n12   same risk with its corresponding constitutional implications.\n\n13             In addition, the heightened scienter requirement in\n\n14   section 2339A constrains prosecutorial discretion, and\n\n15   ameliorates concerns of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\n\n16   Similar scienter requirements have saved other statutes from\n\n17   void-for-vagueness challenges.

Nature of the Offense.     Stewart and Yousry also\n\n22   contend that Count Four, alleging a conspiracy to violate section\n\n23   2339A, acts impermissibly as a charge of a \"multi-level inchoate\n\n24   offense,\" a \"logical absurdity\" that \"violate[s] due process.\"\n\n25   Stewart Br. 161-65.    The gist of their argument is that the\n\n26   charge effectively criminalizes a \"conspiracy to conspire,\"\n\n                                      -50-\n\f1    thereby violating due process by extending criminal liability to\n\n2    a degree too remote from any substantive criminal offense to pass\n\n3    constitutional muster.   Id. at 165-69.   We need not consider this\n\n4    argument;22 Count Five charges the knowing provision of aid -- a\n\n5    substantive, not inchoate, offense -- and Count Four, pursuing a\n\n6    conspiracy to commit that substantive offense, functions as a\n\n7    traditional conspiracy charge.\n\n8               As what seems to us to be a variation on the same\n\n9    theme, Stewart and Yousry assert that the district court erred by\n\n10   \"impermissibly dilut[ing]\" the proof required for conviction of\n\n11   the Count-Two conspiracy in the context of the material support\n\n12   convictions under section 2339A.    Stewart Br. 158.   But the\n\n13   government need not have established beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n14   that Stewart or Yousry engaged in a conspiracy to kidnap or\n\n15   commit murder abroad; neither was charged with doing either.\n\n16   Instead, both were charged with and convicted of violating\n\n17   section 2339A, and, as discussed, the evidence is sufficient to\n\n18   sustain the conviction on those charges.    Stewart and Yousry do\n\n19   not, presumably because they cannot, suggest that Congress did\n\n20   not have the power to criminalize the relevant underlying\n\n21   conduct.\n\n\n\n\n          22\n             We note nonetheless that the defendants do not provide\n     authority for their argument that a \"multi-level inchoate\n     offense\" such as a conspiracy to conspire would violate the Due\n     Process Clause.\n                                      -51-\n\f1               V. Counts Six and Seven\n\n2               Stewart challenges her convictions on Counts Six and\n\n3    Seven for violating the blanket provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1001,\n\n4    which subjects to criminal sanctions\n\n5               whoever, in any matter within the\n6               jurisdiction of the executive, legislative,\n7               or judicial branch of the Government of the\n8               United States, knowingly and willfully--\n 9                   (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by\n10              any trick, scheme, or device a material fact;\n11                   (2) makes any materially false,\n12              fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\n13              representation; or\n14                   (3) makes or uses any false writing or\n15              document knowing the same to contain any\n16              materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\n17              statement or entry. . . .\n18   18 U.S.C. § 1001(a).   Stewart argues that, at worst, she broke a\n\n19   promise, and that the statute criminalizes false statements, not\n\n20   false promises.\n\n21              We conclude otherwise.    On May 16, 2000, Stewart signed\n\n22   an affirmation stating that she would (\"shall\") abide by the\n\n23   SAMs.   On May 26, 2000, Stewart submitted the affirmation to the\n\n24   United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New\n\n25   York.   On May 7, 2001, Stewart signed a revised affirmation to\n\n26   the same effect and telecopied it to the same office.    Before,\n\n27   after, and between executing these affirmations, she helped\n\n28   smuggle messages to and from Abdel Rahman in violation of the\n\n29   SAMs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -52-\n\f1               Stewart at least thrice affirmed \"under the penalties\n\n2    of perjury the truth\" of certain statements.    The May 16, 2000,\n\n3    statement reads in pertinent part:\n\n 4              I . . . understand that neither I nor any\n 5              member of my office shall forward any mail\n 6              received from inmate Abdel Rahman to a third\n 7              person.

There, the Supreme Court\n\n8    reversed a conviction of the defendant under 18 U.S.C. § 1014 for\n\n9    his making of a \"false statement\" -- a check drawn on an account\n\n10   containing insufficient funds -- for the purpose of influencing\n\n11   the actions of a federally insured institution.    But central to\n\n12   the Williams Court's analysis was the proposition that a check,\n\n13   even a bad check, \"is not a factual assertion at all.\"    Id. at\n\n14   284.    A check \"d[oes] not, in terms, make any representation as\n\n15   to the state of [the drawer's] bank balance\" but \"serve[s] only\n\n16   to direct the drawee banks to pay the face amounts to the bearer,\n\n17   while committing [the drawer] to make good the obligations if the\n\n18   banks dishonor[] the drafts.\"    Id. at 284-85.\n\n19               Williams does not apply to the conduct at issue here.\n\n20   A reasonable jury could have concluded that Stewart's\n\n21   affirmations that she would abide by the SAMs amounted to factual\n\n22   assertions regarding her then-present intent to abide by the\n\n23   SAMs.    Based on her repeated affirmations, and her repeated\n\n24   violations of those affirmations, moreover, a reasonable jury\n\n25   could have concluded that at the time Stewart executed and\n\n26   submitted the affirmations at issue, she did not intend to abide\n\n                                     -54-\n\f1    by them -- in other words, that her representations were\n\n2    knowingly false when made.    On this basis, a reasonable jury\n\n3    could have properly concluded that Stewart violated section 1001\n\n4    as charged in Counts Six and Seven.\n\n5               VI.   General Challenges to the\n6                     Validity of the Convictions\n\n7               In addition to their challenges to specific counts in\n\n8    the indictment, Stewart and Sattar make general assertions of\n\n9    error regarding the government's conduct during the course of the\n\n10   prosecution.     Stewart argues that she was selectively prosecuted\n\n11   on account of her gender and political beliefs, and both Stewart\n\n12   and Sattar assert that the government's decision to file a\n\n13   superseding indictment following their successful efforts to\n\n14   dismiss several counts of the initial indictment constitutes\n\n15   vindictive prosecution.\n\n16              The defendants also raise various challenges to the\n\n17   district court's case administration.    First, they allege a\n\n18   variety of pretrial errors: in the denial of their motions to\n\n19   sever their trial from Sattar's; in the empaneling of an\n\n20   anonymous jury; in the denial of Stewart's motion to suppress\n\n21   certain evidence obtained pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence\n\n22   Surveillance Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-511, 92 Stat. 1783, 50\n\n23   U.S.C. §§ 1801 et seq. (\"FISA\"); and in the denial of Stewart's\n\n24   motion for disclosure of whether she, her co-defendants, or\n\n25   others were subject to surveillance by the National Security\n\n26   Agency.   The defendants also argue that the district court made\n\n\n                                      -55-\n\f1    various evidentiary errors.     Finally, the defendants argue that\n\n2    the district court erred in addressing post-conviction claims of\n\n3    juror misconduct.\n\n4    A.   Selective Prosecution\n\n5               Stewart argues that she was selectively prosecuted on\n\n6    account of her gender and political beliefs in violation of the\n\n7    Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.     This\n\n8    argument requires Stewart to establish that she was \"treated\n\n9    differently from other similarly situated individuals\" and that\n\n10   \"such differential treatment was based on impermissible\n\n11   considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or\n\n12   punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad\n\n13   faith intent to injure [her].\"     Harlen Assocs. v.

Clark's and Jabara's alleged\n\n22   misconduct, however, was different from Stewart's adjudicated\n\n23   misconduct in at least one crucial respect: both Clark and Jabara\n\n24   refused to publicize Abdel Rahman's withdrawal of support for the\n\n25   al-Gama'a cease-fire, something Stewart did at least twice.     Like\n\n26   Stewart, Clark spoke to the media on Abdel Rahman's behalf.     But\n\n                                      -56-\n\f1    unlike Stewart, the message Clark disseminated in apparent\n\n2    violation of the SAMs -- that Abdel Rahman did not support the\n\n3    formation of a political party in Egypt -- did not have the same\n\n4    potential for inciting violence.

Supp. 2d at 311-14\n\n8    (denying vindictive prosecution claim), and Order, Sept. 1, 2004\n\n9    (denying selective prosecution claim), Stewart's arguments in\n\n10   this regard are without merit.23\n\n11   B. Vindictive Prosecution\n\n12             Sattar argues that the district court erred in denying\n\n13   his motion to dismiss the Count-Two conspiracy charge in the\n\n14   superseding indictment because the institution of the charge was\n\n15   driven by prosecutorial vindictiveness.   This argument is also\n\n16   without merit.\n\n17             The government filed the original five-count indictment\n\n18   in April 2002.   In it, Sattar, Stewart, Yousry, and another24\n\n          23\n            In rejecting Stewart's selective prosecution claim in\n     part by comparison with Clark's and Jabara's alleged misbehavior,\n     we do not, of course, suggest our approval of Clark's or Jabara's\n     remarkable alleged courses of conduct. But neither of them was\n     indicted or tried for, let alone convicted of, a crime. We are\n     therefore reluctant to comment on their alleged misdeeds at any\n     length. Stewart cites them as evidence of selective prosecution,\n     however, and we therefore note an important difference between\n     Clark and Jabara's alleged actions and Stewart's -- that she,\n     unlike either of them, was willing to issue a public statement\n     regarding Abdel Rahman's changed position on the cease fire.\n          24\n            In addition to the defendants here, the initial\n     indictment also named Yassir Al-Sirri, a/k/a \"Abu Ammar\" as a\n                                                        (continued...)\n                                    -57-\n\f1    were charged with providing, attempting to provide, and\n\n2    conspiring to provide, material support and resources to an FTO\n\n3    in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B.    Sattar moved to dismiss these\n\n4    charges on the ground that section 2339B was unconstitutionally\n\n5    vague as applied to the allegations in the indictment.    By\n\n6    opinion and order dated July 22, 2003, the district court agreed\n\n7    with Sattar.   Sattar I, 272 F. Supp. 2d at 358-61.   Following\n\n8    that decision, the government filed a superseding indictment\n\n9    adding a new count charging Sattar with conspiring to murder\n\n10   persons in a foreign country in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 956.\n\n11              Sattar argues that the government's decision to file\n\n12   the superseding indictment and add the charge of violating\n\n13   section 956 \"was a retaliatory act . . . motivated by the\n\n14   embarrassment [the government] suffered as a result of the\n\n15   dismissal\" of two central counts in the original indictment.\n\n16   Sattar Br. 17.   He asserts that an inference of vindictive\n\n17   prosecution is supportable in two ways:   First, the addition of\n\n18   Count Two -- which carries a potential sentence of life\n\n19   imprisonment, a longer sentence than that authorized by the\n\n20   dismissed charge pursuant to section 2339B -- \"up[ped] the ante\"\n\n21   for the consequences of conviction.

Sattar\n\n17   provides no reason for us to deviate from this general rule here,\n\n18   and no basis upon which we can conclude that the district court's\n\n19   findings in this respect were clearly erroneous.\n\n20               Sattar's claim of actual, as opposed to presumptive,\n\n21   vindictiveness is also without merit.    A finding of actual\n\n22   vindictiveness requires a showing that a \"prosecutor's charging\n\n23   decision [is] a 'direct and unjustifiable penalty,' that resulted\n\n24   'solely from the defendant's exercise of a protected legal\n\n25   right.'\"    Sanders, 211 F.3d at 716-17 (internal citation\n\n26   omitted).    The evidence Sattar offers in this regard is that the\n\n                                     -60-\n\f1    government possessed the same information when preparing the\n\n2    original and superseding indictments, that the maximum punishment\n\n3    Sattar faced if convicted under the superseding indictment was\n\n4    greater than that he faced if convicted under the original\n\n5    indictment, and that the superseding indictment was the result of\n\n6    the district court's dismissal of the section 2339B material\n\n7    support charges in the original indictment.   We have no warrant\n\n8    to conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that\n\n9    the charging decision was not vindictive, or that the government\n\n10   was attempting to do anything more than hold Sattar criminally\n\n11   responsible for engaging in the underlying acts that form the\n\n12   basis of the indictment.   See Paradise, 136 F.3d at 336.   Put\n\n13   another way, it does not follow from the facts Sattar recites\n\n14   that the resulting charge was necessarily brought vindictively;\n\n15   for this reason the district court did not err in concluding\n\n16   otherwise.\n\n17   C.

Severance\n\n20             Stewart and Yousry assert that the district court\n\n21   abused its discretion by denying their motions to sever their\n\n22   trial from the trial of Sattar because Sattar was charged with,\n\n23   and convicted of, conspiracy to murder persons in a foreign\n\n24   country -- allegations different from and more serious than those\n\n25   with which Stewart and Yousry were charged.   To succeed on this\n\n26   argument, Stewart and Yousry must show that the district court\n                                    -61-\n\f1    abused its discretion in this regard and that the resulting\n\n2    prejudice rose to the level of \"a miscarriage of justice.\"     See\n\n3    United States v.

They further contend that the volume\n\n8    of limiting instructions given to the jury rendered them\n\n9    effectively useless in attempting to curb any prejudicial effect.\n\n10             But the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\n11   this respect.   Count Two charged Sattar with conspiring to murder\n\n12   persons in a foreign country.   Count Five charged Stewart and\n\n13   Yousry with providing and concealing material support to that\n\n14   conspiracy, and Count Four charged them with conspiring to\n\n15   provide and conceal that support.      Most of the evidence against\n\n16   Sattar that Stewart and Yousry assert to have been unduly\n\n17   prejudicial to them -- evidence submitted to establish the\n\n18   existence of the Count-Two conspiracy charge against Sattar --\n\n19   would have been admissible against Stewart and Yousry even had\n\n20   the trial been severed.

As\n\n11   we have explained, \"Congress passed FISA to settle what it\n\n12   believed to be the unresolved question of the applicability of\n\n13   the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement to electronic\n\n14   surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, and to remove any\n\n15   doubt as to the lawfulness of such surveillance.\"   Duggan, 743\n\n16   F.2d at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted).   FISA's primary\n\n17   focus is surveillance for the purpose of gathering foreign\n\n18   intelligence information, which is defined to include\n\n19   \"information that relates to, and if concerning a United States\n\n20   person is necessary to, the ability of the United States to\n\n21   protect against [inter alia] international terrorism.\"    50 U.S.C.\n\n22   § 1801(e)(1).\n\n23             FISA established a court (the \"FISA Court\") comprised\n\n24   of designated district court judges (\"FISA Judges\").    The FISA\n\n25   Court has jurisdiction over applications for electronic\n\n26   surveillance relating to the gathering of potential foreign\n\n                                   -69-\n\f1    intelligence information under the procedures set forth in FISA.\n\n2    See id. § 1803.   FISA generally permits a federal officer, when\n\n3    authorized by the President of the United States acting through\n\n4    the Attorney General, to obtain from any FISA Judge an order\n\n5    \"approving electronic surveillance of a foreign power or an agent\n\n6    of a foreign power for the purpose of obtaining foreign\n\n7    intelligence information.\"   Id. § 1802(b).   \"[A] group engaged in\n\n8    international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor,\"\n\n9    is a \"foreign power,\" id. § 1801(a)(4), and an \"agent of a\n\n10   foreign power\" includes any person who \"knowingly engages in\n\n11   sabotage or international terrorism, or activities that are in\n\n12   preparation therefor, for or on behalf of a foreign power\" or\n\n13   \"knowingly aids or abets any person in [such] conduct,\" id.\n\n14   § 1801(b)(2)(C) & (E).\n\n15             In order to secure an order authorizing surveillance\n\n16   from a FISA Judge, the officer's application must meet the\n\n17   statutory requirements set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1804.   For\n\n18   example, the application must set forth the identity or\n\n19   description of the target of the surveillance, id. § 1804(a)(2),\n\n20   and a statement of facts and circumstances relied upon to justify\n\n21   the officer's belief that the target is a foreign power or agent\n\n22   of a foreign power and that each facility or location to be\n\n23   subjected to surveillance is being used or is about to be used by\n\n24   the target, id. § 1804(a)(3).   Prior to October 26, 2001, such a\n\n25   federal officer was required to certify to the FISA judge that\n\n26   \"the purpose\" of the FISA surveillance was the interception of\n\n                                     -70-\n\f1    foreign intelligence information.     See id. § 1804(a)(7)(B)\n\n2    (2000).   In Duggan, we interpreted this provision to mean that\n\n3    the interception of foreign intelligence information must be the\n\n4    \"primary objective\" of the surveillance.     Duggan, 743 F.2d at 77.\n\n5    The statute was changed in the wake of the events of September\n\n6    11, 2001, however, to require only that \"a significant purpose\"\n\n7    of the surveillance be the interception of such information.     See\n\n8    50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(7)(B) (2003); see also 50 U.S.C.\n\n9    § 1804(a)(6)(B) (2008) (redesignated from (a)(7)).\n\n10              Only after a FISA Judge has been satisfied that the\n\n11   application meets FISA's requirements will he or she authorize\n\n12   the surveillance.   To enter an order approving surveillance, the\n\n13   FISA Judge must find that the application was properly filed and\n\n14   properly authorized by the Attorney General; that associated\n\n15   procedures designed to minimize the acquisition and retention of\n\n16   non-publically available information concerning \"United States\n\n17   persons\" satisfy FISA's requirements, see id. § 1801(h); that the\n\n18   facts set forth in the application provide probable cause to\n\n19   believe that the target is a foreign power or agent of such a\n\n20   power; and that the locations to be subject to surveillance are\n\n21   being used, or are about to be used, by the target, id.\n\n22   § 1805(a).\n\n23              When the application is complete and properly certified\n\n24   by an executive branch official, however,\n\n25              it is, under FISA, subjected to only minimal\n26              scrutiny by the courts. Congress deemed it a\n27              sufficient check in this regard to require\n\n                                    -71-\n\f1              the FISA Judge (1) to find probable cause to\n2              believe that the target of the requested\n3              surveillance is an agent of a foreign power;\n4              (2) to find that the application is complete\n5              and in proper form; and (3) when the target\n6              is a United States person, to find that the\n7              certifications are not \"clearly erroneous.\"\n8\n9    Duggan, 743 F.2d at 77.   Stewart's argument that FISA does not\n\n10   ensure adequate judicial view is therefore foreclosed by Duggan.\n\n11   See id. at 77 & n.6.\n\n12             Although the purpose of the surveillance must be to\n\n13   obtain foreign intelligence information, \"otherwise valid FISA\n\n14   surveillance is not tainted simply because the government can\n\n15   anticipate that the fruits of such surveillance may later be\n\n16   used . . . as evidence in a criminal trial.\"     Id. at 78.   To the\n\n17   contrary, the statute specifically contemplates the introduction\n\n18   of FISA surveillance evidence in criminal prosecutions.       See 50\n\n19   U.S.C. § 1806(b).   As both Congress and this Court have\n\n20   recognized, \"in many cases the concerns of the government with\n\n21   respect to foreign intelligence will overlap those with respect\n\n22   to law enforcement.\"   Duggan, 743 F.2d at 78.\n\n23             When such FISA information is introduced in the course\n\n24   of a criminal prosecution, and upon review of a suppression\n\n25   motion, the trial court has the opportunity to review the FISA\n\n26   Court's order, issued pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1805, in light of\n\n27   the underlying applications for surveillance, filed pursuant to\n\n28   50 U.S.C. § 1804, in order \"to determine whether the surveillance\n\n29   [at issue] was lawfully authorized and conducted.\"     50 U.S.C.\n\n30   § 1806(f).

Similarly, based on the\n\n10   relevant evidence which, as adduced at trial, is outlined above,\n\n11   the district court did not err in finding there to be \"ample\n\n12   probable cause to believe that the targets of the relevant\n\n13   surveillance -- Sattar, Yousry, and Sheikh Abdel Rahman -- were\n\n14   acting as agents of a foreign power\" as defined by FISA, i.e.,\n\n15   al-Gama'a, \"and that each of the facilities at which the\n\n16   surveillance was directed was being used, or was about to be\n\n17   used, by that target.\"   Sattar II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22137012</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7, 2003\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

As the district court noted,\n\n21   however, Stewart was never designated as a target in any of the\n\n22   applications at issue; her alleged co-conspirators were.      \"Once\n\n23   the proper preconditions are established with respect to a\n\n24   particular target, there is no requirement in FISA that all those\n\n25   likely to be overheard engaging in foreign intelligence\n\n26   conversations be named.\"    Duggan, 743 F.2d at 79.   Because\n\n                                     -74-\n\f1    Stewart's co-conspirators were targeted pursuant to proper\n\n2    procedures, the Fourth Amendment did not require that Stewart\n\n3    also be identified or described as a target in order for her\n\n4    intercepted conversations to be used in a criminal prosecution.\n\n5    Id. at 79 n.7.\n\n6               Stewart further argues that the district court erred in\n\n7    declining to disclose FISA materials to her counsel.    The\n\n8    district court may order disclosure of FISA materials \"under\n\n9    appropriate security procedures and protective orders,\" but \"only\n\n10   where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate\n\n11   determination of the legality of the surveillance.\"    50 U.S.C.\n\n12   § 1806(f).   When the district court \"determines that the\n\n13   surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted, it shall deny\n\n14   the motion of the aggrieved person except to the extent that due\n\n15   process requires discovery or disclosure.\"   Id. § 1806(g).\n\n16              As we have noted, in these circumstances disclosure is\n\n17   the exception and \"'ex parte, in camera determination is [] the\n\n18   rule.'\"   Duggan, 743 F.2d at 78.   The need to disclose materials\n\n19   to defense counsel may arise if the judge determines there to be\n\n20   \"potential irregularities such as possible misrepresentation of\n\n21   fact, vague identification of the persons to be surveilled or\n\n22   surveillance records which include a significant amount of\n\n23   nonforeign intelligence information, calling into question\n\n24   compliance with the minimization standards contained in the\n\n25   order.\"   Id. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\n26   But Stewart does not point to any case where any court has\n\n                                    -75-\n\f1    ordered disclosure in a situation similar to hers.   Upon our own\n\n2    review of the materials, we conclude that there was no error in\n\n3    the district court's determination that disclosure was\n\n4    unnecessary for an accurate determination of the legality of the\n\n5    surveillance at issue or to satisfy the requirements of due\n\n6    process.\n\n7                   ii.   Disclosure Regarding NSA Surveillance.     On\n\n8    June 16, 2006, Stewart moved to compel disclosure as to whether\n\n9    she or any of her co-defendants were subject to surveillance by\n\n10   the National Security Agency (\"NSA\").   The government filed, ex\n\n11   parte, a classified response to be reviewed in camera.   At a\n\n12   hearing on September 25, 2006, the government insisted that its\n\n13   classified submission was properly filed under section 4 of the\n\n14   Classified Information Procedures Act (\"CIPA\"), Pub. L. No.\n\n15   96-456, 94 Stat. 2025 (1980) (codified at 18 U.S.C. app. 3).     The\n\n16   government also argued that none of the defense counsel was\n\n17   properly cleared for access to the information and that, \"without\n\n18   going into the details of the classification level of our\n\n19   submission, I don't think any defense counsel would ever have a\n\n20   need to know the details of the terrorist surveillance program,\n\n21   especially in this case.\"   H'g Tr. 13-14, Sept. 25, 2006.\n\n22   Following the hearing and in response to subsequent orders from\n\n23   the district court, the government filed supplemental ex parte\n\n24   confidential responses dated October 6, 2006, October 12, 2006,\n\n25   and October 13, 2006 for in camera review.   After additional\n\n26   materials were submitted by the government, the district court\n\n                                    -76-\n\f1    granted, in part, the motion for disclosure, ordering the\n\n2    government to make specified disclosures,25 but otherwise denied\n\n3    the motion.    Order, Oct. 17, 2006, at 2.   In that public order,\n\n4    the district court noted that it had filed an \"ex parte Order\n\n5    under seal containing classified information which explains in\n\n6    detail the reasons for the Court's decision,\" and found that\n\n7    there was a\n\n 8              compelling reason for filing the additional\n 9              Order ex parte and under seal because it\n10              contains classified information that cannot\n11              reasonably be segregated from the other\n12              material in the Order, and that such a filing\n13              is consistent with the Classified Procedures\n14              Act and the rights of the defendants.

Where evidence is\n\n7    intercepted, the sensitive nature of the information might lie\n\n8    \"not so much in the contents of the [information], as in the\n\n9    time, place, and nature of the government's ability to intercept\n\n10   the [information] at all.\"    Yunis, 867 F.2d at 623.28\n\n11               In light of these general concerns and the principles\n\n12   set forth in Yunis and Aref, and based upon our own review of the\n\n13   underlying materials and the district court's sealed order, we\n\n14   are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its\n\n15   discretion or otherwise err in denying Stewart's motion to compel\n\n16   disclosure.\n\n17               We note, as we did in Aref, which postdated the\n\n18   district court's order here, the absence of a formal public\n\n19   \"claim of privilege[] lodged by the head of the department which\n\n20   has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration\n\n21   by that officer.\"    Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7-8; see Aref, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">22</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   at 80.    As in Aref, we conclude that in the pre-Aref context,\n\n          27\n           (...continued)\n     privileged information is protected from disclosure where such\n     information has \"more than theoretical relevance\" and is\n     \"genuinely helpful to [the] defense.\" Id. at 625.\n          28\n            We make neither reference to nor conclusions regarding\n     the material at issue in the instant case.\n                                    -81-\n\f1    such a flaw \"is not necessarily fatal,\" and that \"[i]t would 'be\n\n2    of little or no benefit' for us to remand for the purpose of\n\n3    having the department head agree that disclosure of the\n\n4    classified information would pose a risk to national security\n\n5    here.\"   Aref, 533 F.3d at 80.   But the absence of the formal\n\n6    claim is not a trivial matter.    We do not demean it.    We expect\n\n7    that, in light of the holding in Aref, we will not need to\n\n8    address this issue in appeals from future prosecutions in which\n\n9    the state-secrets privilege is invoked as the government is now\n\n10   well-informed of this obligation.       Cf. id. (\"Based on our holding\n\n11   today . . . we trust that this issue will not arise in future\n\n12   CIPA cases.\").\n\n13              We reject Stewart's claim that the district court erred\n\n14   in reviewing materials ex parte and in camera.      As we noted in\n\n15   Aref, \"[b]oth CIPA section 4 and Rule 16(d)(1) authorize ex parte\n\n16   submissions. . . .   When the 'government is seeking to withhold\n\n17   classified information from the defendant, an adversary hearing\n\n18   with defense knowledge would defeat the very purpose of the\n\n19   discovery rules.'\"   Aref, 533 F.3d at 81.\n\n20              The CIPA procedures followed by the district court\n\n21   place all parties involved (except perhaps the government) at a\n\n22   substantial disadvantage: defendants are hampered in contesting\n\n23   the assertions that are being made to the court by the\n\n24   government; district courts and courts of appeals are deprived of\n\n25   the opportunity for an adversarial proceeding upon which they are\n\n26   typically dependent in attempting fairly and properly to resolve\n\n                                      -82-\n\f1    disputes; and the public, as well as the litigants, are deprived\n\n2    of the assurances that come with public scrutiny of the work of\n\n3    the courts.    The procedures are also, of course, subject to abuse\n\n4    by the executive.   But a method for protection of classified\n\n5    material is necessary, and these procedures have been established\n\n6    by Congress and held to be constitutional.    We, as did the\n\n7    district court, therefore accept them as a necessary, if\n\n8    imperfect, accommodation of the varied interests implicated.\n\n9              2.   Alleged Trial Errors.   Both Sattar and Yousry\n\n10   challenge various evidentiary rulings made by the district court.\n\n11   Sattar argues that the court abused its discretion by admitting a\n\n12   book by Taha and a videotape of Taha, Osama Bin Laden, and other\n\n13   al-Gama'a members encouraging violence, and by excluding news\n\n14   footage purporting to depict Israeli violence against Palestinian\n\n15   demonstrators.   In addition, Yousry challenges the exclusion of\n\n16   several statements he made to FBI agents.\n\n17             We review a district court's evidentiary rulings for\n\n18   abuse of discretion.

Here, the district court did not\n\n21   abuse its discretion with respect to any such rulings.\n\n22             We are guided by certain basic principles established\n\n23   by the Federal Rules of Evidence -- that, as a general rule,\n\n24   \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible,\" Fed. R. Evid. 402, but\n\n25   that even relevant evidence, although admissible, may be excluded\n\n26   by the district court \"if its probative value is substantially\n\n                                     -83-\n\f1    outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\n\n2    issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\n\n3    delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative\n\n4    evidence,\" Fed.

The Bin Laden video was similarly admissible,\n\n14   and relevant to Taha's intent to murder or kidnap.   The district\n\n15   court did not err in failing to find that the evidence was unduly\n\n16   prejudicial.\n\n17             It was also within the district court's discretion to\n\n18   exclude both the news video, which it found to be of minimal\n\n19   relevance yet highly prejudicial and confusing, and Yousry's\n\n20   statements to the FBI, which it found to be essentially\n\n21   duplicative of Yousry's own testimony.\n\n22             The district court made a \"conscientious assessment of\n\n23   whether unfair prejudice substantially outweigh[ed] probative\n\n24   value,\" Salameh, 152 F.3d at 110 (internal quotation marks\n\n25   omitted), and did not otherwise abuse its discretion in making\n\n\n\n                                     -84-\n\f1    this assessment.

It was brought to\n\n4    the district court's attention after the jury rendered its\n\n5    verdict that a juror, referred to by the parties as \"Juror # 39,\"\n\n6    had come forward with allegations concerning improprieties during\n\n7    the jury's deliberations.    The defendants requested that the\n\n8    district court \"'follow up' and conduct an inquiry\" into these\n\n9    allegations.

We\n\n14   disagree.\n\n15               The district court properly construed the request as\n\n16   one for an evidentiary hearing, and concluded that there was no\n\n17   \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . .\n\n18   that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred,\"\n\n19   United States v.

Application to This Case\n\n13             The government's principal claim of error on appeal is\n\n14   that the district court abused its discretion by imposing\n\n15   unreasonably lenient sentences.   The government also argues that\n\n16   the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to apply\n\n17   the Guidelines terrorism adjustment, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4, to\n\n18   Yousry's offense level.\n\n19             1. Yousry's Sentence.   The district court initially\n\n20   calculated Yousry's Guidelines range based on a total offense\n\n21   level of 28 and a criminal history category of I, for a range of\n\n22   78 to 97 months.   According to the government, Yousry's\n\n          31\n             As is discussed in more detail below, the district court\n     found that the terrorism enhancement did not apply to Yousry's\n     conduct, and that his conduct fell outside the heartland of\n     material support for terrorist activity crimes. The district\n     court found Sattar's and Stewart's conduct to merit the terrorism\n     enhancement, but, at least for Stewart, found the case to be an\n     unusual one for the enhancement.\n                                    -92-\n\f1    applicable Guidelines range should have been enhanced in\n\n2    accordance with the terrorism enhancement provide by the\n\n3    Guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4.    The district court concluded to\n\n4    the contrary that the terrorism enhancement did not apply to\n\n5    Yousry because he did not act with the requisite state of mind.\n\n6    Based on the district court's findings, we agree with its\n\n7    conclusion.\n\n8               Upon consideration of the various factors set forth in\n\n9    section 3553(a), the district court concluded that a significant\n\n10   downward variance32 was appropriate, and ultimately sentenced\n\n11   Yousry to a non-Guidelines sentence of 20 months of imprisonment,\n\n12   followed by 2 years of supervised release.\n\n13              a.

The application notes incorporate 18 U.S.C.\n\n12   § 2332b(g)(5) by reference.   See id. cmt. n.1.   That section\n\n13   defines a \"Federal crime of terrorism\" as:\n14\n15                  an offense that--\n16                  (A) is calculated to influence or affect\n17             the conduct of government by intimidation or\n18             coercion, or to retaliate against government\n19             conduct; and\n20                  (B) is a violation of [any one of many\n21             statutes, including 18 U.S.C. § 2339A,\n22             relating to the provision of material support\n23             to terrorists, and 18 U.S.C. § 956(a)(1),\n24             relating to conspiracies to murder persons\n25             abroad].\n\n26   18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5).   The conventional meaning of\n\n27   \"calculated\" is \"devised with forethought.\"   II Oxford English\n\n28   Dictionary 777 (2d ed. 1999).   Therefore, if a defendant's\n\n29   purpose in committing an offense is to \"influence or affect the\n\n30   conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to\n\n31   retaliate against government conduct,\" the first requirement of\n\n32   section 2332b(g)(5)(A) is satisfied.

The court explained:\n\n16              This is a motivational requirement and\n17              focuses on the defendant's purpose. The\n18              government has conceded the lack of\n19              motivation or purpose and has failed to show\n20              that the defendant's offenses were calculated\n21              to influence or affect the conduct of\n22              government by intimidation or coercion or to\n23              retaliate against government action.\n\n24   Sent'g Tr. 143-44; see 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(A) (defining\n\n25   \"federal crime of terrorism\").    The government does not challenge\n\n26   this finding, which we conclude to be consistent with the record\n\n27   and not clearly erroneous.\n\n28              Nonetheless, the government argues that the enhancement\n\n29   is appropriate despite the fact that Yousry has committed neither\n\n30   a federal crime of terrorism nor any other crime with the intent\n                                    -95-\n\f1    to promote such a crime.   According to the government, the\n\n2    enhancement applies because Yousry's offense was \"a felony that\n\n3    involved . . . a federal crime of terrorism.\"     U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4\n\n4    (emphasis added).   But under the \"involved\" prong of section\n\n5    3A1.4, the enhancement would be applicable to Yousry only if he\n\n6    himself had committed a federal crime of terrorism.

And, as the Fourth Circuit has\n\n15   recognized, commission of a federal crime of terrorism, which\n\n16   would trigger the \"involved\" prong of the enhancement,\n\n17   incorporates \"a specific intent requirement, namely, that the\n\n18   underlying felony was 'calculated to influence or affect the\n\n19   conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to\n\n20   retaliate against government conduct.'   18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5).\"\n\n21   United States v.

So\n\n22   the problem for the government remains: there is no evidence that\n\n23   Yousry himself sought to influence or affect the conduct of a\n\n24   government.   The enhancement therefore does not apply under the\n\n25   \"involved\" prong.

The government asserts that it was\n\n26   reasonably foreseeable to Yousry that his co-conspirators were\n\n27   acting in a manner \"calculated to influence or affect the conduct\n\n28   of government,\" so that the requirement of section 2332b(g)(5)(A)\n\n29   is satisfied as to him.\n\n30             But sections 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) and (B) apply to \"acts and\n\n31   omissions,\" while, as noted above, section 2332b(g)(5)(A)\n\n32   describes a motivational requirement, a \"specific intent.\"\n\n33   Chandia, 514 F.3d at 376.

Here, too, the terrorism\n\n8    enhancement's motivational requirement, as incorporated by\n\n9    reference to section 2332b(g)(5)(A), is not an \"act\" or\n\n10   \"omission\" under section 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).

Section 3553(a) Factors\n\n17             We conclude, then, that the district court properly\n\n18   calculated Yousry's Guidelines range to be 78 to 97 months.        We\n\n19   must therefore determine in light of that range and the totality\n\n20   of the circumstances whether Yousry's sentence of 20 months of\n\n21   imprisonment, imposed following the district court's section\n\n22   3553(a) inquiry, was substantively unreasonable.\n\n23             We need not outline again the nature of the crimes of\n\n24   which Yousry was convicted.      We focus instead on the reasons\n\n25   given by the district court in support of its downward variance.\n\n\n\n                                       -98-\n\f1              First, the court found that Yousry's conduct was\n\n2    \"unusual and f[e]ll outside the heartland of material support for\n\n3    terrorist activity.\"    Sent'g Tr. 150.   \"[A] district court's\n\n4    decision to vary from the Guidelines 'may attract greatest\n\n5    respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case outside\n\n6    the \"heartland\" to which the Commission intends individual\n\n7    Guidelines to apply.'\"    Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192 (quoting\n\n8    Kimbrough, 128 S.

We perceive no basis for\n\n9    concluding that the district court erred in deciding that to be\n\n10   the case with respect to Yousry, particularly because he was\n\n11   acting as a translator, not a lawyer or other professional.\n\n12             Second, the district court found that \"no actual harm\n\n13   to victims occurred\" although the court was \"well aware that such\n\n14   harm is not required and that if such harm occurred the guideline\n\n15   range would be higher.\"    Sent'g Tr. 150.   We conclude that it was\n\n16   not unreasonable for the district judge to decide that the fact\n\n17   that no injury occurred in the case mitigated the gravity of\n\n18   Yousry's offense.33    The criminal law often punishes the\n\n\n          33\n             As a procedural matter, we conclude that a district\n     court may rely on the fact that no harm resulted from the\n     criminal act at issue. The weight that such a factor can bear in\n     any particular instance, however, is an analytically separate,\n     and substantive, question. As is made clear by the discussion\n     below, we conclude that the district court did not procedurally\n     err by considering the absence of harm as one factor relevant to\n     the proper sentence of each defendant. We also conclude that\n     both Sattar's and Yousry's sentences are substantively reasonable\n     -- i.e., that the factors identified by the district court can\n     bear the weight assigned to them. Because we vacate Stewart's\n     sentence as procedurally unreasonable, however, we do not address\n     whether the factors identified by the district court, including\n     the apparent lack of substantial harm caused by her criminality,\n                                                        (continued...)\n                                    -99-\n\f1    substantive commission of a crime more severely than an attempt\n\n2    to commit the same crime, even when that which separates an\n\n3    attempt from the substantive commission of an offense is not\n\n4    culpability but fortuity.   Fortuitous events are not\n\n5    categorically irrelevant to the determination of a just\n\n6    punishment nor is their consideration necessarily inappropriate.\n\n7    As the Supreme Court has recently noted, although \"[i]t is\n\n8    unusual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of\n\n9    purely accidental conduct[,] it is not unusual to punish\n\n10   individuals for the unintended consequences of their unlawful\n\n11   acts.\"    See, e.g., Dean v.

We also defer to the district\n\n7    court's conclusion that Yousry's conduct was less culpable than\n\n8    that of his co-conspirators.    On this basis, we conclude that the\n\n9    district court did not err by giving weight to this factor.\n\n10               Fourth, the district court found that Yousry \"did not\n\n11   engage in the offenses for profit and . . . did not support or\n\n12   believe in the use of violence to achieve what he wanted.\"\n\n13   Sent'g Tr. 150.    These facts mitigate the gravity of the conduct\n\n14   at issue.    They also affect consideration of the \"history and\n\n15   characteristics of the defendant\" and the need to \"protect the\n\n16   public from further crimes of the defendant\" and to \"afford\n\n17   adequate deterrence.\"    18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).   The court concluded\n\n18   that a substantial downward variance was thus justified on the\n\n19   grounds that a lesser degree of punishment than otherwise called\n\n20   for would be sufficient for purposes of deterrence and the\n\n21   protection of the public.    As the Gall Court noted, a district\n\n22   court is well-situated to make determinations about the\n\n23   \"character of the defendant\" and whether, given such a character,\n\n24   the defendant is more or less likely \"to return to criminal\n\n25   behavior\" or constitute \"a danger to society.\"    Gall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">26</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   at 600-01.\n\n                                     -101-\n\f1              The district court did not err in finding that Yousry\n\n2    was not motivated by potential profit and did not believe in the\n\n3    use of violence.    Nor did it err in considering these factors\n\n4    while fashioning a non-Guidelines sentence for him.      In\n\n5    evaluating culpability, we cannot discount the relevance of the\n\n6    defendant's motivations -- i.e., whether mercenary, see, e.g., 18\n\n7    U.S.C. § 1958 (murder for hire), or born from a commitment to the\n\n8    use of violence.    The district court acted well within its\n\n9    discretion in deciding that Yousry was both less dangerous and\n\n10   more easily deterred than had he been acting on a for-hire basis\n\n11   or committed to the use of violence for political ends.\n\n12             Fifth, the district court found that Yousry's\n\n13   conviction made it \"doubtful that the defendant could pursue\" his\n\n14   career as an academic or translator, and therefore that the need\n\n15   for further deterrence and protection of the public is lessened\n\n16   because the conviction itself \"already visits substantial\n\n17   punishment on the defendant.\"    Sent'g Tr. 151.    The district\n\n18   court is specifically required by section 3553(a) to consider the\n\n19   \"just punishment for the offense.\"      18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).\n\n20   It is difficult to see how a court can properly calibrate a \"just\n\n21   punishment\" if it does not consider the collateral effects of a\n\n22   particular sentence.    Upon careful review of the record and the\n\n23   reasons given by the court, we are convinced that the court did\n\n24   so appropriately.\n\n25             Sixth, the district court found that Yousry provided\n\n26   \"extensive . . . cooperation\" to the government following the\n\n                                     -102-\n\f1    terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.     Sent'g Tr. 151.   The\n\n2    court concluded that this cooperation \"demonstrates a willingness\n\n3    to help law enforcement and reduces the need for rehabilitation\n\n4    and deterrence.\"    Id.   We defer to the district court's\n\n5    evaluation of the extent of Yousry's cooperation.      And of course,\n\n6    use of a defendant's cooperation to justify significant variances\n\n7    or departures from the otherwise applicable Guidelines\n\n8    calculations is commonplace.     The government argues that Yousry's\n\n9    assistance was not as extensive as the district court found it to\n\n10   be, but we have been given no cause to question the court's\n\n11   relevant findings of fact or the manner in which it accounted for\n\n12   them in sentencing.\n\n13             Seventh, the court found that Yousry \"will not be in a\n\n14   situation to commit the offenses of conviction again,\" because\n\n15   \"it is unlikely that he will ever be able to serve as an\n\n16   interpreter in an official capacity.\"     Id.   We defer to this\n\n17   finding, too.   It is not error for a district court to evaluate,\n\n18   based on the defendant's individual circumstances, the extent of\n\n19   punishment \"necessary to deter [him] from engaging in future\n\n20   criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future\n\n21   criminal acts.\"    Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 602; see 18 U.S.C.\n\n22   § 3553(a)(2)(B) & (C).\n\n23             The district court did not, of course, assign precise\n\n24   weights to particular factors.     Doing so would presuppose \"the\n\n25   existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages\n\n26   to various justifications,\" and would constitute a species of\n\n                                      -103-\n\f1    \"mathematical approach\" which has been expressly disavowed by the\n\n2    Supreme Court as \"a classic example of attempting to measure an\n\n3    inventory of apples by counting oranges.\"     Gall, 128 S. Ct. at\n\n4    596.\n\n5              In evaluating the ultimate substantive reasonableness\n\n6    of Yousry's sentence, we must determine, under the totality of\n\n7    the circumstances, whether these various factors can \"bear the\n\n8    weight\" assigned to them by the district court.     We are satisfied\n\n9    that they can.    We are equally satisfied that the district court\n\n10   \"consider[ed] the extent of the deviation and ensure[d] that the\n\n11   justification [was] sufficiently compelling to support the degree\n\n12   of variance.\"    Id. at 597.\n\n13             In conducting our review, we are further satisfied that\n\n14   the district court did not ignore the Guidelines or \"treat them\n\n15   merely as a body of casual advice.\"     Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189\n\n16   (internal quotation marks omitted).     Even were we inclined to\n\n17   think that the district court did not appreciate the weight of\n\n18   the Guidelines -- which, as we say, we are not -- in light of all\n\n19   of the foregoing, including the court's long-term and intimate\n\n20   involvement with these proceedings, any such conclusion would be\n\n21   purely a matter of surmise on our part.     See Rita, 551 U.S. at\n\n22   357-58 (noting that the sentencing judge had \"greater familiarity\n\n23   with[] the individual case and the individual defendant before\n\n24   him than the Commission or the appeals court\"); see also Gall,\n\n25   128 S. Ct. at 597.    The district court did not abuse its\n\n26   discretion in sentencing Yousry.\n\n                                     -104-\n\f1    B. Sattar's Sentence\n\n2               The district court calculated Sattar's total offense\n\n3    level to be 43 and his criminal history category to be 6, for a\n\n4    Guidelines \"range\" of life imprisonment.     But in conducting its\n\n5    own independent review, as guided by section 3553(a), the\n\n6    district court concluded that such a sentence would be \"seriously\n\n7    disproportionate\" to the offense.    Sent'g Tr. 35.   The court\n\n8    imposed a sentence of 24 years (288 months) of imprisonment, to\n\n9    be followed by five years of supervised release.\n\n10              1. Guidelines Calculation.    The district court\n\n11   calculated Sattar's sentence, as it did Yousry's, under the\n\n12   November 2000 Guidelines.    The court ultimately adopted the\n\n13   recommendations of the Probation Department in making its\n\n14   Guidelines calculation, except insofar as the district court\n\n15   added enhancements based on Sattar's obstruction of justice.\n\n16              a. Enhancements\n\n17              Sattar's Guidelines \"range\" of life imprisonment was\n\n18   arrived at based in part on the sentencing court's determination\n\n19   that the terrorism enhancement applied to both Sattar's Count-Two\n\n20   and Count-One conduct.     The district court also enhanced Sattar's\n\n21   sentence on the ground that he obstructed justice.     See U.S.S.G.\n\n22   § 3C1.1.\n\n23              b. Departures\n\n24              Sattar moved for a downward departure based on the\n\n25   conditions of his confinement.    The district court recognized\n\n26   that it was able to depart under the Guidelines for severe\n\n                                      -105-\n\f1    conditions of detention, but \"because thus far th[ose conditions]\n\n2    reflect only strict security measures rather than an abuse of\n\n3    those measures,\" it declined to do so.    Sent'g Tr. 33.    Instead,\n\n4    the court concluded that it would take Sattar's conditions of\n\n5    confinement into account in considering the section 3553(a)\n\n6    factors.\n\n7               2. Section 3553(a) Factors.   The district court began\n\n8    its section 3553(a) analysis with a correct calculation of the\n\n9    applicable Guidelines \"range\" -- life imprisonment.    The court\n\n10   then imposed the non-Guidelines sentence of 24 years'\n\n11   imprisonment, for which it gave three principal reasons.\n\n12              First, the court concluded that the terrorism\n\n13   enhancement overstated the seriousness of Sattar's crime by\n\n14   transforming a Guidelines range of 97 to 121 months to life\n\n15   imprisonment.    The court found that the otherwise-applicable\n\n16   Guideline range was \"relatively low\" because Sattar was convicted\n\n17   of conspiracy to murder and not of murder itself, and that the\n\n18   terrorism enhancement failed to account for the fact that \"no\n\n19   injury actually occurred in this case.\"    Sent'g Tr. 35.   The\n\n20   district court noted that a variance downward from a Guidelines\n\n21   range driven upward by the enhancement is permissible when the\n\n22   enhancement \"prevents the penalty from fitting the crime, based\n\n23   on the facts of th[e] record.\"    Id. at 35-36 (citing Mandhai, 375\n\n24   F.3d at 1249).\n\n25              Second, the terrorism enhancement put Sattar in the\n\n26   highest criminal history category, VI, \"without a single past\n\n                                      -106-\n\f1    criminal history point.\"    Id. at 36.   The district court\n\n2    concluded that such a jump \"overstates [Sattar's] past conduct\n\n3    and the likelihood that the defendant after a substantial period\n\n4    of incarceration would commit further crimes.\"     Id.\n\n5              Third, the court noted that Sattar had been under\n\n6    \"extremely restrictive conditions of confinement for 4-1/2\n\n7    years,\" and there \"is every reason to expect that his conditions\n\n8    of confinement will continue to be substantially more severe than\n\n9    the average prisoner.\"    Id. at 37.   These conditions include\n\n10   being kept in a cell for 23 hours a day and under constant\n\n11   surveillance.    As a result, the court concluded, \"the punitive\n\n12   aspects of the defendant's confinement are increased and the\n\n13   deterrent effect of the defendant's confinement is also\n\n14   increased.\"    Id.\n\n15             The court further noted that, for reasons explained in\n\n16   part under seal, a downward variance is warranted based on\n\n17   factors relevant to the history and characteristics of the\n\n18   defendant and the need to afford adequate deterrence.34       The\n\n19   district court observed that based on the totality of the\n\n20   circumstances and on its review of cases presented by the\n\n21   government as comparators, Sattar's sentence of 24 years'\n\n22   incarceration does not promote unwarranted sentencing\n\n23   disparities.\n\n\n\n\n          34\n             We have reviewed the document under seal.        See Sattar\n     Statement of Reasons, Oct. 26, 2006.\n                                   -107-\n\f1               3. Analysis.   The government's principal argument on\n\n2    cross-appeal is that Sattar's sentence is substantively\n\n3    unreasonable in light of his conduct and \"long-term dedication to\n\n4    violence.\"    Gov't Reply Br. 39.   We have no quarrel with the\n\n5    government as to the nature and quality of Sattar's conduct.\n\n6    Neither, to any significant extent, did the district court.       It\n\n7    considered, at length, the seriousness of Sattar's crimes.\n\n8               \"[A] sentence outside the Guidelines carries no\n\n9    presumption of unreasonableness.\"     Irizarry v. United States, 128\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2202 (2008).    \"[T]he Guidelines are only one of the\n\n11   factors to consider when imposing sentence . . . .\"     Gall, 128 S.\n\n12   Ct. at 602.    Taking those precepts as a starting point, we are\n\n13   satisfied that in fashioning a non-Guidelines sentence, the\n\n14   district court did not clearly err in according weight to the\n\n15   factors it identified.    As we recently noted in Cavera, \"at the\n\n16   procedural part of review, we will not categorically proscribe\n\n17   any factor 'concerning the background, character, and conduct' of\n\n18   the defendant, with the exception of invidious factors.\"     Cavera,\n\n19   550 F.3d at 191.\n\n20              We have already noted in the context of Yousry's\n\n21   sentence that the fact that no injury occurred may be relevant to\n\n22   fashioning a sentence \"sufficient, but not greater than\n\n23   necessary\" to accomplish the purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C.\n\n24   3553(a).   And it was not clear error for the district court to\n\n25   conclude that a criminal history category of VI significantly\n\n\n\n                                     -108-\n\f1    overstated Sattar's criminal history and likelihood of committing\n\n2    further offenses.\n\n3                We have recognized that \"the Sentencing Commission had\n\n4    a rational basis for creating a uniform criminal history category\n\n5    for all terrorists under [U.S.S.G.] § 3A1.4(b), because even\n\n6    terrorists with no prior criminal behavior are unique among\n\n7    criminals in the likelihood of recidivism, the difficulty of\n\n8    rehabilitation, and the need for incapacitation.\"   United States\n\n9    v. Meskini, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780806\"><a href=\"/opinion/780806/united-states-v-abdel-ghani-meskini-also-known-as-eduardo-rocha-mokhtar/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">10</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   1068 (2003).   But in the same virtual breath, we said, \"[a] judge\n\n11   determining that § 3A1.4(b) over-represents 'the seriousness of\n\n12   the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the\n\n13   defendant will commit other crimes' always has the discretion\n\n14   under § 4A1.3 to depart downward in sentencing.   U.S.S.G.\n\n15   § 4A1.3.\"   Id.\n\n16               And even with enhancements of magnitude -- i.e., those\n\n17   that \"sharply increase the recommended sentences\" -- there still\n\n18   may be \"a wide variety of culpability amongst defendants.\"\n\n19   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192.   There may therefore be \"different\n\n20   sentences based on the factors identified in § 3553(a).\"     Id.\n\n21   Sattar's crimes are indeed grave; he may well be the most\n\n22   culpable of these defendants.   But the district court has a\n\n23   responsibility, inter alia, \"to avoid unwarranted sentence\n\n24   disparities among defendants with similar records who have been\n\n25   found guilty of similar conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).\n\n26   Perhaps all who merit this enhancement are culpable and dangerous\n\n                                     -109-\n\f1    -- but some among them are more culpable, more dangerous, with\n\n2    crimes more serious, than others.   It is the district court that\n\n3    is primarily charged with the responsibility for making such\n\n4    distinctions.\n\n5              The district court is also in the best position to make\n\n6    an individual determination about the \"history and\n\n7    characteristics\" of a particular defendant, and to adjust the\n\n8    individualized sentence accordingly.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a);\n\n9    cf. U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3 (permitting downward departure where \"the\n\n10   court concludes that a defendant's criminal history category\n\n11   significantly over-represents the seriousness of a defendant's\n\n12   criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit\n\n13   further crimes\").   Upon examining the reasons the district court\n\n14   gave, we have no reason not to defer to its assessment here.\n\n15             It was not unreasonable for the district court to\n\n16   conclude that the severity of the conditions of confinement would\n\n17   increase the severity of the punishment and the amount of\n\n18   deterrence associated with a given term of imprisonment in light\n\n19   of the particular conditions of confinement under which Sattar is\n\n20   incarcerated.   The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\n21   varying downward based on those conditions here.     We think that\n\n22   the factors upon which the district court relied in determining\n\n23   Sattar's appropriate sentence can \"bear the weight\" the district\n\n24   court assigned to them.   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -110-\n\f1               We note, finally, that the court sentenced Sattar to\n\n2    more than twice what the maximum Guideline sentence would have\n\n3    been without the terrorism enhancement.\n\n4               The sentence thus adequately reflected the severity of\n\n5    the crime.\n\n6               C. Stewart's Sentence\n\n7               Before sentencing Stewart, the district court\n\n8    calculated her offense level under the November 2000 Guidelines\n\n9    to be 41, her criminal history category to be VI, and her\n\n10   Guidelines range to be 360 months, or 30 years, the statutory\n\n11   maximum.   The court concluded, however, that a sentence of 28\n\n12   months' imprisonment was sufficient but no greater than necessary\n\n13   to accomplish the purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n14              1. Guidelines Calculations\n\n15              a. Enhancements\n\n16              Over Stewart's objection, the district court concluded\n\n17   that the terrorism enhancement of section 3A1.4 applied because\n\n18   she had committed a federal crime of terrorism.   The enhancement\n\n19   was triggered in part by the district court's finding that\n\n20   Stewart's actions were \"calculated to affect the conduct of the\n\n21   Egyptian government through intimidation and coercion.\"    Sent'g\n\n22   Tr. 108.   The district court noted that Stewart's \"conduct cannot\n\n23   be found to be outside the heartland of the enhancement,\" but\n\n24   stated that it nonetheless would \"take all of the defendant's\n\n25   arguments [as to why the enhancement did not properly apply to\n\n\n\n                                    -111-\n\f1    her conduct] into account in performing the analysis under\n\n2    Section 3553(a).\"   Id.\n\n3              The district court noted that the terrorism enhancement\n\n4    automatically placed Stewart in criminal history category VI.\n\n5    The court appeared to accept Stewart's argument that the\n\n6    enhancement overstated the seriousness of her past conduct or the\n\n7    likelihood that she would commit further crimes.    Instead of\n\n8    adjusting the criminal history in the context of the Guidelines\n\n9    calculations themselves, however, the court found this to be \"one\n\n10   of the rare cases\" under United States v. Crosby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789140\"><a href=\"/opinion/789140/united-states-v-jerome-crosby/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n11   112 (2d Cir. 2005), where it would be more appropriate to\n\n12   determine the extent of the downward adjustment in the context of\n\n13   the section 3553(a) analysis.   Sent'g Tr. 109.35\n\n14             The government also sought an enhancement of Stewart's\n\n15   sentence on the ground that she obstructed justice.    The\n\n16   Guidelines provide that where a defendant \"willfully obstructed\n\n17   or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the\n\n18   administration of justice with respect to the investigation,\n\n19   prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction\"\n\n20   and where the obstructive conduct related to the offense of\n\n21   conviction or a closely related offense, that the applicable\n\n\n\n          35\n             In Crosby, we said that \"a sentencing judge will\n     normally have to determine the applicable Guidelines range\" but\n     that precise calculation of the range may not be necessary in\n     \"situations . . . where either of two Guidelines ranges, whether\n     or not adjacent, is applicable, but the sentencing judge, having\n     complied with section 3553(a), makes a decision to impose a\n     non-Guidelines sentence, regardless of which of the two ranges\n     applies.\" Crosby, 397 F.3d at 111-12.\n                                   -112-\n\f1    Guidelines should be enhanced by 2 levels.     U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.\n\n2    The government argued that Stewart committed perjury by\n\n3    testifying \"that she understood that there was a bubble built\n\n4    into the SAMs whereby the attorneys could issue press releases\n\n5    containing Abdel Rahman's statements as part of their\n\n6    representation of him\" and testifying about her purported lack of\n\n7    knowledge of Taha.   Sent'g Tr. 111.    As we have noted, Taha was a\n\n8    follower of Abdel Rahman and a military leader in al-Gama'a who\n\n9    claimed responsibility for the November 1997 massacre at Luxor,\n\n10   and was allegedly part of the Count-Two conspiracy.     The district\n\n11   court noted that there was \"evidence to indicate that [Stewart's]\n\n12   statements were false statements.\"     Id.   It concluded, however,\n\n13   that it was \"unnecessary to reach [the question] whether the\n\n14   defendant knowingly gave false testimony with the intent to\n\n15   obstruct the proceedings\" for two reasons:     First, the Guidelines\n\n16   calculation already provided for the statutory maximum permitted\n\n17   by the statutes of conviction, and second, a non-Guidelines\n\n18   sentence was, in the estimation of the court, \"reasonable and\n\n19   most consistent with the factors set forth in Section 3553(a).\"\n\n20   Id. at 111-12.\n\n21             b. Departures\n\n22             Stewart sought a downward departure pursuant to section\n\n23   5H1.4 of the Guidelines, which provides that while \"[p]hysical\n\n24   condition . . . is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether\n\n25   a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range,\"\n\n26   nonetheless \"an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason\n\n                                    -113-\n\f1    to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range.\"\n\n2    U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4.     Stewart proffered substantial documentation of\n\n3    serious illness.     As with Stewart's criminal history\n\n4    calculations, the district court concluded that it \"[did] not\n\n5    have to reach the question of whether [Stewart's] medical\n\n6    condition, given her age and continuing treatment, is sufficient\n\n7    in itself to warrant a departure from the guidelines,\" because it\n\n8    would take that condition into account in making its\n\n9    determination under section 3553(a).     Sent'g Tr. 110.\n\n10               The district court declined to adjust the Guidelines\n\n11   calculations based on Stewart's argument that she committed her\n\n12   crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm as set forth in\n\n13   \"Lesser Harms\" policy statement of the Guidelines.     See U.S.S.G.\n\n14   § 5K2.11.    Stewart argued before the district court that her\n\n15   conduct \"was the product of her perception that her client's\n\n16   health and well-being [was] seriously jeopardized by his\n\n17   continued imprisonment in the United States.\"     Stewart Sent'g Br.\n\n18   44-45.   Under the policy statement, where a defendant \"commit[s]\n\n19   a crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm,\" \"a reduced\n\n20   sentence may be appropriate, provided that the circumstances\n\n21   significantly diminish society's interest in punishing the\n\n22   conduct, for example, in the case of a mercy killing.\"     U.S.S.G.\n\n23   § 5K2.11.    However, \"[w]here the interest in punishment or\n\n24   deterrence is not reduced, a reduction in sentence is not\n\n25   warranted.\"    Id.   Here, the district court found this case not to\n\n26   be one where the interest in punishment or deterrence is reduced.\n\n                                      -114-\n\f1     The policy statement further provides that a reduction in the\n\n2    otherwise applicable sentence might be appropriate where \"conduct\n\n3    may not cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented\n\n4    by the law proscribing the offense at issue\" such as \"where a war\n\n5    veteran possessed a machine gun or grenade as a trophy, or a\n\n6    school teacher possessed controlled substances for display in a\n\n7    drug education program.\"    U.S.S.G. § 5K2.11.   But the court\n\n8    declined to conclude that Stewart's conduct did not cause or\n\n9    threaten the harm sought to be prevented by the statutes that\n\n10   Stewart violated.\n\n11               Stewart also moved for a departure on the ground that\n\n12   her conduct was \"aberrational.\"    A Guidelines policy statement\n\n13   provides that \"[a] sentence below the applicable guideline range\n\n14   may be warranted in an extraordinary case if the defendant's\n\n15   criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior.\"     U.S.S.G.\n\n16   § 5K2.20.    But the court, noting that Stewart's conduct was\n\n17   \"committed over an extended period of time, involv[ing] repeated\n\n18   acts of deception, and . . . significant planning,\" Sent'g Tr.\n\n19   110, concluded that such a departure would be inappropriate, and\n\n20   declined to grant it.\n\n21               The district court thus reached its final Guidelines\n\n22   calculation, using the November 2000 Guidelines, with a total\n\n23   offense level of 41, a criminal history category of VI, and\n\n24   therefore a Guidelines \"range\" of 360 months, the statutory\n\n25   maximum.    The government sought a term of life imprisonment;\n\n26   Stewart sought a non-incarceratory sentence.\n\n                                     -115-\n\f1              2. Section 3553(a) Factors.   Based on its section\n\n2    3553(a) analysis, the district court's sentence substantially\n\n3    varied from the applicable Guidelines range.\n\n4              As the starting point for its section 3553(a) analysis,\n\n5    the court addressed the applicability of the terrorism\n\n6    enhancement, which \"while correct under the guidelines, would\n\n7    result in an unreasonable result . . . and produce a guideline\n\n8    range about quadruple the range [that would otherwise apply]\n\n9    without the enhancement.\"   Sent'g Tr. 114.   The district court\n\n10   then observed:\n\n11             First, that Stewart's was an \"atypical case\" for the\n\n12   terrorism enhancement inasmuch as \"the thrust of the violation\n\n13   was the provision of a co-conspirator to a terrorist conspiracy,\"\n\n14   id. at 113; second, as with Sattar, that the structure of the\n\n15   terrorism enhancement prevented the Guidelines from taking into\n\n16   account the fact that no victim was harmed as a result of the\n\n17   offense as charged; and third, again as with Sattar, that the\n\n18   enhancement operated to prevent the Guidelines from taking into\n\n19   account Stewart's actual criminal history.    By virtue of the\n\n20   terrorism enhancement, Stewart was automatically classified as\n\n21   within criminal history category VI, the highest possible\n\n22   category, whereas if her sentence were based on her actual\n\n23   criminal history, she would have been classified in category I,\n\n24   the lowest possible category.\n\n25             The court therefore concluded that the terrorism\n\n26   enhancement was \"dramatically unreasonable\" and \"overstates the\n\n                                     -116-\n\f1    seriousness of [her] past conduct and the likelihood that [she]\n\n2    will repeat the offense.\"   Id.    Stewart \"has no criminal history\n\n3    and yet is placed in the highest criminal history category equal\n\n4    to that of repeat felony offenders for the most serious offenses\n\n5    including murder and drug trafficking.\"       Id. at 113-14.    The\n\n6    criminal history category was inappropriate, the court\n\n7    determined, in light of \"the likelihood of recidivism, the\n\n8    difficulty of rehabilitation and the need for incapacitation.\"\n\n9    Id. at 114.\n\n10              The court found that Stewart's opportunity to repeat\n\n11   \"the crimes to which she had been convicted will be nil\" because\n\n12   she \"will lose her license to practice law\" and \"will be forever\n\n13   separated from any contact with Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman.\"         Id.\n\n14   Loss of her license to practice law both removes \"the occasion\n\n15   for her offenses\" and \"is itself a punishment.\"        Id. at 116.\n\n16              The district court viewed Stewart's personal\n\n17   characteristics as \"extraordinary\" and thought they \"argue[d]\n\n18   strongly in favor of a substantial downward variance.\"         Id. at\n\n19   114.   The court described her as a dedicated public servant who\n\n20   had, throughout her career, \"represented the poor, the\n\n21   disadvantaged and the unpopular, often as a Court-appointed\n\n22   attorney,\" thereby providing a \"service not only to her clients\n\n23   but to the nation.\"   Id. at 115-16.      And \"[h]aving spent her\n\n24   professional career often representing the poor, she is now, at\n\n25   the end of her career, financially destitute.\"       Id. at 115.\n\n\n\n                                       -117-\n\f1              The court also took into account Stewart's ill health\n\n2    -- she had, for example, suffered from cancer, for which she had\n\n3    undergone surgery and radiation therapy, and for which there is a\n\n4    significant chance of recurrence.   The district court was of the\n\n5    view that in light of those conditions and her age, 67 years old\n\n6    at the time, prison would be \"particularly difficult\" for her,\n\n7    and that at her age, moreover, her sentence would \"represent a\n\n8    greater portion of her remaining life than for a younger\n\n9    defendant and provide increased punishment.\"   Id. at 117.\n\n10             3. Analysis\n\n11             a. The Scope of Review\n\n12             The government's principal argument on appeal is that\n\n13   in light of the crimes of which Stewart stands convicted, her\n\n14   sentence was substantively unreasonable.   Section 3553(a)\n\n15   instructs that the sentence must \"reflect the seriousness of the\n\n16   offense, . . . promote respect for the law, and . . . provide\n\n17   just punishment for the offense\" and \"afford adequate deterrence\n\n18   to criminal conduct.\"   18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A) & (B).   Our\n\n19   review for substantive reasonableness is a \"particularly\n\n20   deferential form of abuse-of-discretion review.\"   Cavera, 550\n\n21   F.3d at 188 n.5 (citing Gall 128 S. Ct. at 591).   But our review\n\n22   must also be \"meaningful.\"   Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597; cf. Gerard\n\n23   E. Lynch, Letting Guidelines Be Guidelines (And Judges Be\n\n24   Judges), Ohio St. J. Crim. L. Amici: Views From the Field (Jan.\n\n25   2008), at http://osjcl.blogspot.com/ (\"[W]e should let\n\n26   (appellate) judges be judges . . . , performing their traditional\n\n                                    -118-\n\f1    function of reining in excess and gradually developing a 'common\n\n2    law' of what is and is not sensible.\" (emphasis deleted)).\n\n3              Like the district court, we are impressed by the\n\n4    factors that figured in Stewart's modest sentence -- particularly\n\n5    her admirable history of providing, at no little personal cost to\n\n6    herself, proficient legal services in difficult cases to those\n\n7    who could not otherwise afford them.   We think it noteworthy,\n\n8    moreover, that the last of the acts for which Stewart is being\n\n9    punished occurred a short time before the September 11 attacks on\n\n10   the United States.   That carnage might have raised in her, as it\n\n11   surely has in many or most of us, a heightened awareness of and\n\n12   sensitivity to the imminent dangers of terrorism and the possible\n\n13   scope of the deadly capabilities of the terrorists with whom she\n\n14   was dealing.\n\n15             We also recognize, as did the district court, that the\n\n16   terrorism enhancement may apply to persons who are culpable in\n\n17   substantially different degrees; that Stewart's culpability may\n\n18   well be understood to be less than Sattar's; and that the\n\n19   district court may differentiate between different levels of\n\n20   culpable conduct that nonetheless trigger the same substantial\n\n21   enhancement.   Yet Stewart's sentence is strikingly low in light\n\n22   of what the district court correctly described as the\n\n23   \"irreducible core of [her] extraordinarily severe criminal\n\n24   conduct,\" Sent'g Tr. 118, \"which was committed over an extended\n\n25   period of time, involved repeated acts of deception, and\n\n26   involve[d] significant planning,\" id. at 110.\n\n                                    -119-\n\f1              For us to \"patrol the boundaries of [the]\n\n2    reasonableness\" of a sentence imposed by a gifted and experienced\n\n3    trial judge who has spent years intensively involved overseeing a\n\n4    prosecution may turn out to be the legal equivalent of squaring\n\n5    the circle.36   Yet that is what we are instructed to do.   Cavera,\n\n6    550 F.3d at 191.    While we will not lightly substitute our\n\n7    judgment for the carefully executed judgment of the learned trial\n\n8    judge, we think that in light of the fact Stewart used her\n\n9    privileged status as a lawyer to facilitate her violation of the\n\n10   law, and possibly committed perjury at trial in an attempt to\n\n11   avoid punishment for her conduct, her sentence at least tests\n\n12   those \"boundaries.\"\n\n13             b.    Stewart's Abuse of Her Status\n14                   as a Member of the Bar\n\n15             Stewart argues that she did no more than serve as a\n\n16   zealous advocate for her client.    That belief, if indeed she\n\n17   harbored it, gave her no license to violate the law.    Stewart's\n\n18   actions tended ultimately and ironically to subvert the same\n\n19   fundamental right of which she took advantage -- the\n\n20   constitutional right to counsel -- by making it less likely that\n\n21   other incarcerated persons will have the same level of access to\n\n22   counsel that her client was given.\n\n\n\n\n          36\n             The classic mathematical challenge of \"squaring the\n     circle,\" i.e., creating a square with the same area as a given\n     circle using only compass and straight edge, was, in 1882, proved\n     to be impossible. See 7 New Encyclopaedia Britannica\n     Micropaedia, \"Lindemann, (Carl Louis) Ferdinand von,\" 372 (15th\n     ed. 2002).\n                                   -120-\n\f1              The district court seemed to appreciate that fact,\n\n2    noting that Stewart \"abused her position as a lawyer\" in\n\n3    committing her crimes.   Sent'g Tr. 118.   The court did not,\n\n4    however, explain how and to what extent the sentence reflected\n\n5    the seriousness of the crimes of conviction in light of the fact\n\n6    that Stewart was engaged as a member of the bar when she\n\n7    committed them.\n\n8              The question therefore remains whether, because she was\n\n9    an experienced and dedicated lawyer acting as such when she broke\n\n10   the law in the manner that she did, her punishment should have\n\n11   been greater than it was.37\n\n12             c.   A Comparison of Yousry's and Stewart's Sentences\n\n13             A comparison between Stewart's and Yousry's offense\n\n14   conduct serves to highlight the seriousness of Stewart's crimes\n\n15   and the seemingly modest sentence she received for it.    Unlike\n\n16   Yousry, Stewart publicly disseminated \"potentially lethal\"\n\n\n          37\n             The district court did not address whether Stewart\n     \"abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special\n     skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission\n     or concealment of the offense,\" meriting a two-level enhancement\n     under the Guidelines.

The\n\n16   district court summarized the argument as follows:\n\n17             First the government contends that Ms.\n18             Stewart knowingly gave false testimony when\n19             she testified that she understood that there\n20             was a bubble built into the SAMs whereby the\n21             attorneys could issue press releases\n22             containing Abdel Rahman's statements as part\n23             of their representation of him.\n24             The government also contends that Ms. Stewart\n25             testified falsely when she denied knowing who\n26             Taha was until learning about him in the\n27             course of the trial except for an article\n28             that she came across in her representation of\n29             Yasir Ahmed.\n\n30   Sent'g Tr. 111.   The court, having thus recited the allegations\n\n31   at sentencing, declined to decide the issue.\n\n\n                                     -122-\n\f1              As noted, the district court gave two reasons for not\n\n2    making such a finding.   First, it concluded that because\n\n3    Stewart's Guidelines calculations had reached the statutory\n\n4    maximum of 360 months, a finding of obstruction of justice would\n\n5    not have changed the calculation.   This would be true if the\n\n6    terrorism enhancement had been applied in Stewart's case, but the\n\n7    district court, after determining that Stewart's conduct was in\n\n8    the enhancement's \"heartland,\" did not apply it.   And even were\n\n9    it true, the question of Stewart's perjury is nonetheless\n\n10   relevant to her sentence pursuant to section 3553.   Section\n\n11   3553(a) requires the district court to impose a sentence\n\n12   \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to, among other\n\n13   things, promote respect for the law.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).\n\n14   Whether Stewart lied to the jury under oath or upon affirmation\n\n15   at her trial is relevant to whether her sentence was \"sufficient\"\n\n16   under the circumstances.\n\n17             The district court's second reason for declining to\n\n18   determine whether Stewart committed perjury during the course of\n\n19   her testimony was that it had determined that a non-Guidelines\n\n20   sentence was \"reasonable and most consistent with the factors set\n\n21   forth in Section 3553(a).\"   Sent'g Tr. 111-12.   But as noted, we\n\n22   think that whether Stewart lied under oath at her trial is\n\n23   directly relevant to whether her sentence was appropriate in\n\n24   light of Section 3553(a).    Her willingness as a lawyer knowingly\n\n25   and falsely to affirm her intention to obey the SAMs and then to\n\n26   seek to cover up this knowing violation of the law with\n\n                                     -123-\n\f1    perjurious testimony, might well, if proven, influence our\n\n2    conclusion as to the propriety of her sentence.   Any cover-up or\n\n3    attempt to evade responsibility by a failure to tell the truth\n\n4    upon oath or affirmation at her trial would compound the gravity\n\n5    of her crime.\n\n6                We conclude that by declining to decide whether Stewart\n\n7    committed perjury or otherwise obstructed justice, the district\n\n8    court procedurally erred.\n\n9                4.   Remand\n\n10               A district court's failure to find particular facts\n\n11   will in no way impede our review in some, perhaps in most,\n\n12   situations; this, however, is not one of them.    Especially in\n\n13   light of the absence of a finding that Stewart did not commit\n\n14   perjury at trial or otherwise obstruct justice, we cannot\n\n15   determine whether her sentence was substantively reasonable.\n\n16               We therefore remand this matter to the district court\n\n17   for resentencing, in the course of which we direct the court to\n\n18   determine the issue of perjury and if it finds such perjury, to\n\n19   resentence Stewart so as to reflect that finding.    The district\n\n20   court should also consider whether Stewart's conduct as a lawyer\n\n21   triggers the special-skill/abuse-of-trust enhancement under the\n\n22   Guidelines, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, and reconsider the extent to\n\n23   which Stewart's status as a lawyer affects the appropriate\n\n24   sentence.    Upon resentencing Stewart, the district court may\n\n25   consider, or reconsider, any additional matter that may bear\n\n26   upon Stewart's sentence.\n\n                                     -124-\n\f1              Although we find no procedural or substantive error in\n\n2    connection with the sentencing of Sattar and Yousry, we\n\n3    nonetheless remand their cases, too.    We conclude that, inasmuch\n\n4    as the interrelationship among the sentences of the co-\n\n5    defendants is a principal consideration as to a proper sentence\n\n6    of Stewart, the district court should have the ability, if not\n\n7    the obligation, to resentence them as well.\n\n8              After the district court completes the resentencing,\n\n9    jurisdiction may be restored to this Court by letter from any\n\n10   party, and the Office of the Clerk of this Court shall set an\n\n11   expeditious briefing schedule and refer the matter to this panel\n\n12   for further review.\n\n13                              CONCLUSION\n\n14             For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction of\n\n15   Stewart, but remand this cause to the district court for\n\n16   resentencing of Stewart, see United States v.

I write separately to comment on our decision with\n\n 4   respect to Stewart’s sentence.\n\n 5          When a judge of extraordinary ability and a well-earned reputation for exceptional\n\n 6   judgment has spent as much time on a case like this, making many decisions of tremendous\n\n 7   difficulty—which on review we are all in agreement were correct and wisely done—even the\n\n 8   usual deference that the Supreme Court indicated should be paid to the district court’s sentencing\n\n 9   must constitute an understatement.

We may find that there are some procedural or\n\n11   technical matters that warrant more consideration by the district judge, such as the question of\n\n12   whether Stewart committed perjury and the relevance of this in determining an appropriate\n\n13   sentence, given the district court’s treatment of the terrorism enhancement. But for us—who\n\n14   have not been involved in the case and do not know all the backs and forths, some of which may\n\n15   even be best left not fully articulated—to second guess the district court’s judgment seems to me\n\n16   to be precisely what both the Supreme Court and our court sitting en banc in United States v.\n\n17   Cavera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1206802\"><a href=\"/opinion/1206802/united-states-v-cavera/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (2d Cir. 2008), have said we should not do. I join the majority\n\n18   opinion because I understand it to avoid second guessing. I write here to explore some of the\n\n19   principal issues on which this panel is divided and to give fuller expression to the importance of\n\n20   having appellate courts appreciate the limited, though still important, institutional role we play,\n\n21   particularly in a case such as this one, where the temptation to go beyond that role is so great.1\n\n\n     1\n      Judge Walker, in his partial dissent, suggests that I believe some judges are infallible and\n     beyond reproach. Far from it; were that my view, I could not join the majority opinion in\n\n\n                                                       1\n\f1                                                    I.\n\n2          After calculating Stewart’s sentence under the Guidelines, the district court applied the §\n\n3   3553(a) factors and concluded that the effect of the terrorism enhancement, “while correct under\n\n4   the guidelines, would result in an unreasonable result” in this particular case. Sent’g Tr. 114.\n\n5   The district court arrived at this conclusion based on, inter alia, (1) the somewhat atypical nature\n\n6   of Stewart’s case for the imposition of the terrorism enhancement, and (2) the lack of evidence\n\n7   that any victim was harmed as a result of the charged offense.2 Id. at 113. As a procedural\n\n8   matter, each of these grounds seems to me to be well within the district court’s discretion to\n\n\n\n\n    remanding Stewart’s sentence. Indeed, I agree completely with the implication in Judge\n    Walker’s statement that all judges, including distinguished appellate ones, can become so\n    preoccupied with a case as to lose perspective. My point is simply that before we assume that a\n    very able district judge has erred substantively in sentencing, we should be especially cautious\n    both in our language and in our judgments, and if we have doubts we should give that judge\n    every opportunity to explain the sentence imposed.\n    2\n      The district court also found that the terrorism enhancement’s increase of Stewart’s Criminal\n    History Category from I to VI—the result of the enhancement’s “horizontal” component—was\n    “dramatically unreasonable in [her] case” because it “overstate[d] the seriousness of [her] past\n    conduct and the likelihood that [she would] repeat the offense.” Sent’g Tr. 113. Because no\n    member of this panel suggests this determination was procedural error, I do not focus on it. It is\n    worth keeping in mind, however, that multiple considerations informed the district court’s view\n    that application of the terrorism enhancement—which “produce[d] a guideline range about\n    quadruple the range without that enhancement”—would be inappropriate in Stewart’s case. Id. at\n    114. For that reason, some of Judge Walker’s contentions—such as that the majority opinion,\n    and my concurrence especially, “erroneously permit[] the district court to eliminate the\n    enhancement altogether primarily because [harm did not result],” Op. of J. Walker at [26], or that\n    the district court “[r]emov[ed]” Stewart from the “terrorism spectrum” because of its view that\n    her crime was atypical, id. at [25]—strike me as misleading. Furthermore, in doing this, and\n    elsewhere in his opinion, Judge Walker seems to label as procedural errors decisions that are\n    normally considered substantive judgments about the amount of weight a particular factor can\n    bear—judgments that we are to review under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard after\n    taking into the account “the totality of the circumstances.” See Gall v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

What is more, I would be extremely reluctant to disturb a district court’s careful effort\n\n 2   to look to the unique circumstances of a defendant like Stewart and arrive at an individualized\n\n 3   sentence where the Guidelines recommendation is controlled by an undeniably broad\n\n 4   enhancement (or reduction) like the terrorism enhancement.\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>                                                    <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span>\n\n <span class=\"page\">6</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">          When the terrorism enhancement is applied, it has dramatic consequences on the\n\n 7   applicable Guidelines range because it automatically increases both the offense level of a crime\n\n 8   and the defendant’s Criminal History Category. In Stewart’s case, for example, the\n\n 9   recommended sentence range without the enhancement was 78 to 97 months, while imposition of\n\n10   the enhancement resulted in a recommended sentence of 360 months, the statutory maximum.\n\n11   Yet as both the majority opinion and Judge Walker, in his partial dissent, recognize, the terrorism\n\n12   enhancement casts a very broad net. In this case, that breadth was compounded by the fact that\n\n13   the “federal crime of terrorism” for which Stewart was convicted, i.e. the provision of material\n\n14   support, itself covers a wide range of conduct of varying degrees of culpability ranging from the\n\n15   supply of lodging to the contribution of “weapons, lethal substances, [and] explosives.” See 18\n\n16   U.S.C. § 2339A. When a Guidelines recommendation has such dramatic consequences and yet\n\n17   covers a multitude of sins, unusually broad sentencing discretion in the district court is essential.\n\n18   Indeed, it must be so to comply with the Supreme Court’s remedial holding in United States v.\n\n19   Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (2005).\n\n20          We articulated this precise point in Cavera, recognizing that “some Guidelines\n\n21   enhancements and reductions apply without modulation to a wide range of conduct.” 550 F.3d at\n\n22   192. We identified as examples several financial crimes where the recommended sentence under\n\n\n                                                       3\n\f 1   the Guidelines varies dramatically according to the money involved, but the culpability of an\n\n 2   individual defendant might not be captured accurately by a single variable like financial impact.\n\n 3   Id. Perhaps more closely analogous to the terrorism enhancement, we pointed to the Armed\n\n 4   Career Criminal Guidelines, under which the recommended sentences for firearms offenses\n\n 5   increase sharply if the defendant has a prior conviction for a “crime of violence”—an expansive\n\n 6   term that places crimes like attempted burglary of a dwelling under the same umbrella as crimes\n\n 7   like murder and rape. See id. (citing U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)). The terrorism enhancement in its\n\n 8   breadth of coverage is akin to these examples from Cavera. The majority opinion understands\n\n 9   this when it says that the terrorism enhancement “may apply to persons who are culpable in\n\n10   substantially different degrees,” and that the district court “may differentiate between different\n\n11   levels of culpable conduct that nonetheless trigger the same substantial enhancement.” Maj. Op.\n\n12   at [119].\n\n13          We indicated in Cavera that when a district court faces such over- and under-inclusive\n\n14   Guidelines recommendations and when, after considering the § 3553(a) factors, it promulgates a\n\n15   sentence that varies from that recommendation, the district court’s decision, “if adequately\n\n16   explained, should be reviewed especially deferentially.” 550 F.3d at 192 (emphasis added).\n\n17   Nothing we hold here should be understood to conflict with that principle, or to cast doubt on the\n\n18   district court’s apparent conclusion that there must be much room for discretion under the\n\n19   terrorism enhancement.3\n\n\n     3\n       Let me be absolutely clear. Neither the majority opinion nor my concurrence suggests that\n     district courts have greater discretion exclusively for sentencing terrorism defendants. In fact, I\n     believe precisely the opposite. My point is that the terrorism enhancement is, like the examples\n     identified in Cavera, one instance of a Guidelines enhancement that applies “without\n\n\n                                                       4\n\f 1          While we have raised questions about the closeness of Yousry and Stewart’s sentences in\n\n 2   light of Stewart’s seemingly greater level of responsibility and status as a lawyer, and while we\n\n 3   would benefit from greater explanation by the district court on this issue, it remains the district\n\n 4   court’s task to assess where Stewart’s criminal behavior falls along the spectrum of terrorism\n\n 5   enhancement culpability. And I would be very reluctant—when and if I had to review a sentence\n\n 6   in this case for substantive reasonableness—to find an abuse of discretion in a conclusion by the\n\n 7   district court that Stewart’s conduct, though undeniably serious, was significantly less serious\n\n 8   than that of other defendants subject to the terrorism enhancement.\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>                                                    <span class=\"reporter\">Barb.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">10</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n11          I am more ambivalent about the degree to which absence of harm is a valid ground on\n\n12   which to mitigate a sentence. But I am confident that we should not preclude a district court\n\n13   from giving lack of harm some weight, even for crimes of terrorism. Whether it is fair to assign\n\n14   different levels of culpability in criminal sentencing to the same criminal conduct based on the\n\n15   fortuity of whether harm results has long been a contested question in Anglo-American\n\n\n     modulation” to a wide range of conduct, and that we should be especially deferential to a district\n     court’s reasoned decision to vary from such a broad Guidelines recommendation. See Cavera,\n     550 F.3d at 192.\n             In contrast, Judge Walker does appear to advocate a separate sentencing jurisprudence for\n     terrorism cases. Judge Walker repeatedly seeks to distinguish terrorism-related crimes from\n     other crimes, and even suggests that, as to harm in terrorism crimes, the sentencing reviews of\n     appellate courts should run in one direction only. See Op. of J. Walker at [27] He also states\n     that the wide variety of conduct encompassed by “terrorism support,” unlike the wide variety of\n     conduct covered by other crimes, does not give rise to added district court discretion in\n     sentencing. See id. at [24–25]. He attributes this to congressional decisions. With great respect, I\n     have difficulty reading what Congress has mandated as creating these differences. Judge Walker\n     clearly views terrorism-related crimes as in a different category from all other very serious\n     felonies—and he may well be right. It is, however, an error—though a common one among all\n     judges—to attribute one’s own heartfelt and perhaps correct views to the legislators.\n\n\n                                                       5\n\f 1   jurisprudence. See H.L.A. HART , THE CONCEPT OF LAW 131 (1968) (“Why should the accidental\n\n 2   fact that an intended harmful outcome has not occurred be ground for punishing less a criminal\n\n 3   who may be equally dangerous and equally wicked?”). But whatever significance the\n\n 4   consequences of a defendant’s actions ought to have, it is an inevitable part of human\n\n 5   nature—and our law—that we as a society do give consequences considerable weight when we\n\n 6   mete out punishment and blame.4 This is deeply entrenched in our legal system. The majority\n\n 7   opinion identifies the law of attempts as one generally accepted instantiation of this tendency,\n\n 8   Maj. Op. at [99–100], but there are many others—such as crimes of culpable risk creation, like\n\n 9   vehicular homicide. And while it is true that material support to terrorism is a complete crime\n\n10   rather than an inchoate one, and so fully punishable even if no further harm results, it simply\n\n11   does not follow that the amount of punishment may not at least in part depend on the harm that\n\n12   occurred. The level of punishment for a completed crime varies all the time based on the amount\n\n13   of harm that has occurred, and the Guidelines themselves often directly embrace such a policy.5\n\n\n     4\n       See Sanford H. Kadish, The Criminal Law and the Luck of the Draw, 84 J. CRIM . L &\n     CRIMINOLOGY 679, 688 (1994) (“While in principle it’s difficult to find good reasons for making\n     desert turn on chance, here’s the rub: most of us do in fact make judgments precisely of this\n     kind.”). See generally PAUL H. ROBINSON & JOHN DARLEY , JUSTICE , LIABILITY AND BLAME:\n     COMMUNITY VIEWS AND THE CRIMINAL LAW (1995) (presenting studies suggesting public\n     judgments about criminal culpability turn significantly on the level of harm that results from an\n     action).\n     5\n       Judge Walker identifies several examples in his opinion, though he reaches a different\n     conclusion about their import. See Op. of J. Walker at [26 n.11] (identifying as examples the\n     increase of the offense level for conspiracy or solicitation to commit murder if the offense results\n     in death, U.S.S.G. § 2A1.5(c)(1)), and the increase of the offense level for aggravated assault\n     based on victim’s injuries, Id. § 2A2.(b)(3)). There are many other examples. See Kate Stith,\n     The Arc of the Pendulum: Judges, Prosecutors, and the Exercise of Discretion, 117 YALE L.J.\n     1420, 1476 (2008) (“Guidelines sentences for both drug crimes and financial crimes depend\n     heavily on the quantity of harm found by the sentencing judge . . . .”).\n\n\n                                                      6\n\f1          Judge Walker suggests terrorism is different, and that, at least in the “very broad\n\n2   heartland of cases,” it is procedural error for the district court to consider absence of harm as\n\n3   relevant to the application of the terrorism enhancement and ultimately to the imposition of a\n\n4   sentence.6 He argues that treating harm as a consideration relevant to sentencing those convicted\n\n5   of terrorism related crimes, such as for material support, would effectively nullify the policy\n\n6   considerations of Congress and the Sentencing Commission, who have not made reductions for\n\n7   lack of harm part of the terrorism enhancement. Even if the Guidelines do not themselves make\n\n8   lack of harm relevant for the application of the terrorism enhancement—and they fail to do so\n\n9   only in the narrow sense that the enhancement does not positively reflect the existence of\n\n\n\n    6\n      Though Judge Walker suggests otherwise, it is not at all unprecedented for a district court to\n    consider lack of harm relevant to sentencing in a terrorism case. Indeed, in a case that Judge\n    Walker cites, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a district court decision that did just that. See United\n    States v.

In that case, the district\n    court found that the terrorism enhancement applied, but then granted a downward variance based\n    in part on the fact that the defendant had not carried out any violent acts at the time of his\n    apprehension. See United States v. Garey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2337642\"><a href=\"/opinion/2337642/united-states-v-garey/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In upholding the defendant’s sentence as\n    not unreasonable, the Eleventh Circuit specifically noted that the district court had already\n    considered the defendant’s arguments about the lack of actual harm and, on the basis of the §\n    3553(a) factors, imposed a reasonable sentence below the advisory Guidelines range.

Walker at [27 n.13]. That is true,\n    but it is not relevant to the precise issue we face because the district court here agreed that the\n    enhancement applied under the Guidelines. It is also incorrect to say that, for all practical\n    purposes, the district court used lack of harm to nullify the sentencing enhancement, because that\n    was not the only consideration relied upon by the district court to support its variance. See supra\n    note 2. The real question is whether, as a procedural matter, lack of harm can support some\n    downward variance in a terrorism case. To this narrow question, other courts have said, or at\n    least strongly implied, that the answer is yes.\n\n\n                                                      7\n\f 1   injury—the Supreme Court has made clear that a district court, which has “greater familiarity\n\n 2   with [] the individual case and the individual defendant,” may properly decide that sentencing\n\n 3   judgments made by the Guidelines fail properly to reflect the § 3553(a) considerations. See Rita\n\n 4   v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351 (2007).\n\n 5          What is more, the Court has evidenced profound skepticism toward arguments that\n\n 6   certain policy judgments, which require departing from the Guidelines, have implicitly been\n\n 7   taken off the table as a result of congressional silence or inaction. See Kimbrough v. United\n\n 8   States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570–73 (2007). As the Court explained, it is usually inappropriate to draw\n\n 9   inferences from congressional silence on sentencing practices because Congress has shown that,\n\n10   when it wants to, it knows how to direct levels of sentencing in express terms. Id. at 571 (citing\n\n11   28 U.S.C. § 994(h), which required Sentencing Commission to set Guidelines sentences for\n\n12   recidivist offenders at or near the statutory maximum). As a result, the fact that Congress\n\n13   increased the statutory maximum in 2001 for material support convictions that caused death, see\n\n14   Op. of J. Walker at [26–27], and did so without saying anything whatever about how a district\n\n15   court may treat harm when issuing a sentence that is less than the applicable maximum, cannot\n\n16   be read to diminish the discretion the district court otherwise has under § 3553(a).7\n\n17          I also rather doubt that we would be willing to apply consistently a principle that harm is\n\n18   irrelevant in terrorism cases. Consider two potential defendants, both of whom provide funds to\n\n19   different terrorists and have the requisite mens rea to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C §\n\n\n\n     7\n       Indeed, that Congress saw fit to increase the maximum sentence for material support based\n     solely on whether death results can easily be understood to suggest that Congress thought amount\n     of harm does matter in this context, even if, at times, that harm is largely fortuitous.\n\n\n                                                      8\n\f 1   2239A. In one case, the terrorist whom the defendant funds attempts to detonate an explosive in\n\n 2   a public place, but the explosives do not go off properly and so cause only a few injuries and one\n\n 3   death that results, in part also, from inadequate medical treatment. In the second case, the\n\n 4   terrorist’s detonation attempt succeeds, blowing up a city bus and causing a major traffic\n\n 5   collision that kills or injures hundreds of people. While reasonable minds might differ as to the\n\n 6   weight the level of harm should be given in this scenario, surely we would not hold it\n\n 7   procedurally unreasonable for the district court to take the amount of harm into account when\n\n 8   sentencing the respective defendants and—while sentencing the first severely—use it as a reason\n\n 9   to give the second defendant a much greater sentence. Yet if that is so, the converse must hold,\n\n10   because “sentencing discretion is like an elevator in that it must run in both directions.” Cavera,\n\n11   550 F.3d at 194. To concede, as I think we must, that when hundreds of people are injured or\n\n12   killed rather than just one a district court may take the amount of harm into account and impose a\n\n13   higher sentence, but then to deny the court that same discretion to reach a lower sentence when,\n\n14   through fortuity, no harm results, would manifestly contravene that principle.8\n\n15\n\n     8\n       I by no means suggest that a district court may not err by attributing too much importance to\n     results, whether on the upside or the downside. When reviewing a sentence for substantive\n     reasonableness, appellate courts may question whether the presence or absence of actual harm\n     can “bear the weight” attributed to it by a district court. Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191. And while an\n     appellate court must never forget that its review is deferential, see Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 596, it may\n     need to look carefully at a district court’s reasons for giving weight to results, especially given\n     the natural tendency to overvalue consequences. The majority opinion appropriately treats this\n     substantive question as analytically distinct from whether a district court may, as a procedural\n     matter, rely on lack of harm. See Maj. Op. at [99–100 n.33]. Like the majority opinion, I\n     express no view, at this time, as to whether the district court in this case placed too much weight\n     on the apparent lack of harm that resulted from Stewart’s actions. See Part II infra.\n\n\n\n                                                       9\n\f 1                                                     II.\n\n 2           I have focused to this point on factors the district court may consider procedurally when\n\n 3   sentencing, but this case also illustrates the importance of our adherence as an appellate court to\n\n 4   the right procedure for review of district court sentences. In Cavera, we explained that our\n\n 5   review involves a two-step process. We first ensure that the district court has not committed\n\n 6   procedural error, and only later engage in substantive review to examine whether the district\n\n 7   court has rendered a sentence that is one of the “exceptional cases where the trial court’s decision\n\n 8   cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.” 550 F.3d at 189 (internal\n\n 9   quotations and emphasis omitted). Following this sequence of review is central to our limited\n\n10   role. Because district courts “have an institutional advantage over appellate courts” when\n\n11   making sentencing decisions, Koon v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (1996), our job as a\n\n12   reviewing court is mainly to ensure that a district court’s sentence “resulted from the district\n\n13   court’s considered judgment as to what was necessary to address the various, often conflicting,\n\n14   purposes of sentencing.” Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189–90. Evaluating the substantive\n\n15   reasonableness of a sentence before we have found it free from procedural defect risks the\n\n16   substitution of our “considered judgment” for that of the district court.\n\n17           When we identify procedural error, we have recognized the desirability of remanding to\n\n18   the district court to let it correct its mistake and “exercise its discretion anew,” rather than\n\n19   proceeding prematurely to review the sentence for substantive reasonableness. See Cavera, 550\n\n20   F.3d at 190. While we have not held that this course must necessarily be followed in all\n\n21   instances, a review of our cases makes clear that it is the ordinary and much preferred remedy.\n\n22   See, e.g., United States v.

It is consonant with our\n\n13   system of sentencing, which asks the district court to reach a complete judgment about the\n\n14   appropriate sentence in light of the factors enumerated in § 3553(a). Procedural errors prevent\n\n15   the district court from properly arriving at such a holistic judgment. And in light of our\n\n16   obligation to defer significantly to a procedurally correct sentence, we should almost always wait\n\n17   until we have such a sentence to review before evaluating overall reasonableness.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       See, e.g., United States v.

No one wants unnecessary appeals. But I fail to\n\n 3   see any systemic advantages from issuing advisory opinions on the reasonableness of sentences\n\n 4   that we are vacating, and hence that are now no longer really before us. The decision to remand\n\n 5   for procedural unreasonableness presupposes that we believe the district court might not have\n\n 6   imposed the same sentence but for the procedural defect. See, e.g., United States v. Jass, 569\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (recognizing that procedural errors in sentencing are subject to\n\n 8   harmless error rule). When we remand for procedural flaws, it may seem inviting to comment at\n\n 9   the same time on other factors relied upon by the district court that, though procedurally proper,\n\n10   do not, in our judgment, bear the weight the district court attributed to them. But it is not our\n\n11   role to weigh the individual § 3553(a) factors ourselves and to give advice to the district court as\n\n12   to our views. See Gall, 128 S. Ct. At 602.\n\n13          Let me repeat: Substantive reasonableness calls for review of the overall sentence, not\n\n14   individual factors. And § 3553(a) calls for balancing all the relevant factors. As a result, any\n\n15   non-harmless procedural errors necessarily affect the sentencing calculus. Our task is to evaluate\n\n16   (deferentially) the district court’s finished product, and not to grade its individual ingredients. To\n\n17   do this properly, we must almost always wait for the district court to correct the procedural errors\n\n18   that we have identified and to explain its sentence, and only then to consider the substantive\n\n19   reasonableness of the sentence.\n\n20          I do not mean to suggest an absolutist view on this matter. It may be that there are cases\n\n21   where there is procedural error that—even though it is not harmless—is sufficiently separate\n\n22   from any serious substantive concerns that we have, so as to make it plausible to address the two\n\n\n                                                      12\n\f 1   issues at once. I cannot think of any such cases offhand, however. And, for the reasons well\n\n 2   expressed by the majority opinion, this case is not one of them.\n\n 3                                                     III.\n\n 4           Another, perhaps uncomfortable, issue deserves discussion. Stewart does not appear to\n\n 5   have been the only member of Abdel Rahman’s legal team both to agree to abide by the SAMs\n\n 6   imposed upon Rahman and then subsequently to violate them. One of Rahman’s lawyers,\n\n 7   Abdeen Jabara, read to Rahman newspaper articles and letters from followers, while another,\n\n 8   Ramsey Clark, the former Attorney General of the United States, acknowledged issuing a\n\n 9   statement to the media on behalf of Rahman.10 Yet neither Jabara nor Clark was prosecuted for\n\n10   these apparent violations. This does not mean that the Government’s decision to prosecute only\n\n11   Stewart was invidious or improper, and I join the majority opinion in rejecting Stewart’s claim of\n\n12   selective prosecution. But though Stewart’s selective prosecution challenge fails, it does not\n\n13   follow that the alleged misconduct of Jabara and Clark—whom the district court may well have\n\n14   decided shared in certain respects the culpable behavior for which Stewart was convicted—is\n\n15   entirely irrelevant to Stewart and to her sentence. I think it possible that it is relevant, and I\n\n16   believe that usually only the district court is positioned to evaluate that relevance.\n\n17           As to claims of selective prosecution, we have properly recognized that our scope of\n\n18   review is limited, for “the decision as to whether to prosecute generally rests within the broad\n\n19   discretion of the prosecutor.” United States v. Alameh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783299\"><a href=\"/opinion/783299/united-states-v-fadi-alameh/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 173 (2d Cir. 2003).

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111375\"><a href=\"/opinion/111375/wayte-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 (1985). Yet this does not mean\n\n 3   that unfettered (even when it is non-invidious) prosecutorial discretion over who gets charged,\n\n 4   and for what, is categorically desirable. Quite the contrary: while prosecutorial discretion may be\n\n 5   salutary in a wide variety of cases, when left entirely without any controls it will concentrate too\n\n 6   much power in a single set of government actors, and they, moreover, may on occasion be\n\n 7   subject to political pressure. The result may well be to produce disparities in the way similarly\n\n 8   situated people are treated, disparities that our complex, Guidelines-with-district-court-\n\n 9   discretion, system has sought to minimize. The district court’s exercise of its sentencing\n\n10   discretion may provide the only effective way to control and diminish unjustified disparities,\n\n11   without operating in the blunt fashion of selective prosecution judicial review. It may reduce\n\n12   improper differences in treatment, without impinging on the executive’s obligation to enforce the\n\n13   law.\n\n14          Our case law provides support for this approach. For instance, while we have not\n\n15   required a district court to consider sentencing disparities among co-defendants, we have held\n\n16   that district courts are permitted to do so. As we explained, it is “appropriate for a district court,\n\n17   relying on its unique knowledge of the totality of circumstances of a crime and its participants, to\n\n18   impose a sentence that would better reflect the extent to which the participants in a crime are\n\n19   similarly (or dissimilarly) situated and tailor the sentences accordingly.” Wills, 476 F.3d at 110\n\n20   (internal emphasis omitted). This, as has been recognized, allows district courts to provide a\n\n21   check against certain otherwise unbounded prosecutorial decisions, as to what charges to bring\n\n\n\n\n                                                       14\n\f 1   and as to whether to make substantial assistance motions with respect to only some defendants.11\n\n 2   It is not much of an extension to permit the district courts to exercise analogous supervision over\n\n 3   those decisions as to which prosecutors enjoy the greatest discretion and that result in the greatest\n\n 4   disparities: the decisions on whether to bring any charges at all.\n\n 5          There are, of course, many reasons for prosecutors to fail to bring charges or to bring\n\n 6   lesser charges than they could have, and some of these reasons are clearly irrelevant to the proper\n\n 7   sentence of the person who has been charged and convicted. But other reasons may be relevant\n\n 8   because they may suggest arbitrariness and can lead to abuse—such as the political clout of some\n\n 9   potential defendants as against others. We as appellate judges are ill-suited to distinguish\n\n10   between relevant and irrelevant reasons in any given case. The same cannot be said, however,\n\n11   for a district court judge who has presided over a whole trial in which the behavior of uncharged\n\n12   or undercharged parties was part and parcel of the discussion.\n\n13          This does not mean that when a district court issues a sentence that it should articulate its\n\n14   reliance on the prosecution’s decision not to charge (or to undercharge) other parties. I am not\n\n15   sure. While we generally ask a district court to explain the reasons behind its sentence, and\n\n\n     11\n       See KATE STITH & JOSÉ A. CABRANES, FEAR OF JUDGING : SENTENCING GUIDELINES IN THE\n     FEDERAL COURTS 140–42 (1998) (articulating concern, pre-Booker, that “exercise of broad\n     prosecutorial authority over sentencing within a system that severely limits the sentencing\n     discretion of federal judges means that the power of prosecutors is not subject to the traditional\n     checks and balances that help prevent abuse of that power”and advocating system where judges\n     have the “countervailing discretionary authority to restrain prosecutorial power”) (emphasis in\n     original); Ryan Scott Reynolds, Note, Equal Justice under the Law: Post-Booker, Should\n     Federal Judges Be Able to Depart from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to Remedy Disparity\n     Between Codefendant’s Sentences?, 109 COLUM . L. REV . 538, 564–66 (2009) (contending that\n     the emerging rule among circuit courts that allows district courts to consider co-defendant\n     disparity is desirable because it mitigates negative effects of excessive prosecutorial power over\n     sentencing).\n\n\n                                                      15\n\f 1   indeed indicated in Cavera that “a district court errs if it fails adequately to explain its chosen\n\n 2   sentence, and must include an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range,” 550\n\n 3   F.3d at 190 (internal quotations omitted), there are some things that are perhaps best left unsaid\n\n 4   by the district court, even though their potential relevance is apparent on the record.12 A\n\n 5   prosecutor’s decision to charge only some parties rather than others may be one of these things.\n\n 6   The district court might quite reasonably want to avoid impugning the reputation of parties who\n\n 7   have not been indicted or tried, and hence have not had the opportunity to assert innocence in\n\n 8   open court. But that does not mean that a judge who has presided over a full trial may not have\n\n 9   valid reasons to conclude that the failure to charge some potential co-defendants affects, under\n\n10   the § 3553 factors, the propriety of a sentence.13\n\n11          I am inclined to think that the district court should not be barred from considering the\n\n12   relevance of prosecutorial discretion in a particular case, and that our legal system should take\n\n13   advantage of the district court’s unique position to consider a defendant’s sentence “in its\n\n14   complete relevant context,” Wills, 476 F.3d at 110 (emphasis added). As appellate courts we\n\n15   should therefore also keep this issue in mind when we review a district court’s sentence, and\n\n16   recognize it as a further reason to defer to a district court’s sentencing judgments. In particular,\n\n17   though we may properly ask the district court to explain apparent sentencing anomalies among\n\n     12\n        Cf. Guido Calabresi, A COMMON LAW FOR THE AGE OF STATUTES 172–81 (1982) (discussing\n     tradeoffs between open recognition of a doctrine and greater opacity, where the latter might be\n     useful in preventing a doctrine’s abuse).\n     13\n       Significantly, our system of sentencing allows the district court to consider uncharged conduct\n     by the defendant so as to ensure that the sentence is based upon “the real conduct that underlies\n     the crime of conviction.” Booker, 543 U.S. at 250 (Remedial Op., Breyer, J.). One of the\n     principal reasons for this, as expressed by the Court, is to prevent prosecutors, when they make\n     charging decisions, from “exercis[ing] a power the Sentencing Act vested in judges.” Id. at 257.\n\n\n                                                       16\n\f 1   convicted defendants as both the majority opinion and the partial dissent do here, we should not\n\n 2   forget that there might be even greater disparities between a defendant and other individuals who\n\n 3   were not charged at all.14\n\n 4                                                     IV.\n\n 5           Finally, I would be remiss if I did not follow the majority opinion in observing the fact\n\n 6   that all of the acts for which Stewart was convicted occurred before the attacks of September 11,\n\n 7   2001, an event that illustrates in particularly excruciating fashion that results do matter to us. It\n\n 8   does not diminish the gravity of Stewart’s crimes to take judicial notice of their timing, and to\n\n 9   recognize that our attitudes about her conduct have inevitably been influenced by the tragedy of\n\n10   that day. To suggest otherwise, and to ignore that 9/11 has profoundly influenced our\n\n11   retrospective assessment of the culpability of certain actions related to terrorists and terrorist\n\n12   organizations, would be to ignore reality. As the majority opinion says, Stewart herself might\n\n     14\n        At footnote 20 post, Judge Walker describes as academic my discussion of the possible relation\n     between the sentence imposed on the defendant before us, and the absence of any charges\n     brought against the other lawyers originally involved in this case—lawyers, some of whose acts\n     could surely be described in language as powerful as that used by Judge Walker with respect to\n     the defendant’s misdeeds. Whatever may be said of my views, they are not academic. They\n     reflect instead the very practical consequences of: (a) the necessary absence of any judicial\n     control over prosecutorial decisions as to whom to charge, decisions which, as Judge Walker\n     rightly notes, are “exclusive and absolute” and “insulated from judicial review,” Op. of J. Walker\n     at [45 n.20]; (b) the inevitable tendency of human beings, and hence also of “prosecutors acting\n     in good faith,” id., to take easy rather than difficult (and possibly politically costly) actions. (It is\n     perhaps worth noting again in this regard that one of the uncharged lawyers in this case was\n     formerly the chief prosecutor of the United States, while the defendant is described by the district\n     court as having “represented the poor, the disadvantaged and the unpopular,” Sent’g Tr. 115); (c)\n     the fact that without “initiating [any] inquisitorial foray into the prosecutor’s office,” Op. of J.\n     Walker at [45 n.20], a district court can get a pretty good read on the likely relative behavior of\n     those involved in the complex set of actions that led to a particular trial, including those\n     participants not charged; and (d) that the district court is given by law the direct task of\n     determining what is “just punishment” and, in doing so, to “avoid unwarranted . . . disparities,”\n     18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n                                                        17\n\f1   well have viewed her actions differently after 9/11 when the dangerousness of terrorism became\n\n2   so palpable, so stark, and—most important— so proximate. See Maj. Op. at [119]. We must be\n\n3   careful then in judging Stewart based on lessons that we learned only after her—very\n\n4   serious—crimes were committed.15 In the end, this factor too is part of the district court’s\n\n5   obligation to consider “the nature and circumstances of the offense,” and to impose a sentence\n\n6   that “reflect[s] the seriousness of the offense” and “provide[s] just punishment.” See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n    3553(a)(1)–(2).\n\n\n\n\n    15\n      On various occasions Judge Walker, in his partial dissent, makes reference to much higher\n    sentences given by other federal courts to those who have aided terrorists, including in cases in\n    which no harm occurred. See Op. of J. Walker at [7 n.4, 27 n.13]. It is no small matter,\n    however, that the overwhelming majority of the cases Judge Walker cites involved post-9/11\n    actions by the defendants. See, e.g., United States v. Khan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2310743\"><a href=\"/opinion/2310743/united-states-v-khan/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mar. 14, 2007).\n\n                                                    18\n\f1    United States v. Stewart\n2    No. 06-5015-cr\n\n3    WALKER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n4          For two years, defendant Lynne Stewart, through artifice and\n\n5    deception, and despite sworn commitments to the contrary made to\n\n6    the government, carried out a criminal plan to transmit\n\n7    instructions from her imprisoned client, a terrorist leader, to\n\n8    his jihadist followers in the Middle East, including, ominously,\n\n9    his withdrawal of support for a fragile cease-fire in Egypt, an\n10   action that effectively sanctioned renewed terrorist attacks and\n\n11   indiscriminate loss of human life.         The district court termed\n\n12   these deliberate and horrific crimes of terrorism, for which the\n\n13   Sentencing Guidelines recommended 30 years imprisonment,\n\n14   “extraordinarily severe criminal conduct.”          And yet the district\n\n15   court imposed a breathtakingly low sentence of 2 1/3 years.\n\n16   Because the majority fails to recognize that this sentence\n\n17   trivializes Stewart’s extremely serious conduct with a “slap on\n\n18   the wrist” that is substantively unreasonable, and because the\n\n19   majority fails to appreciate the full extent of the district\n20   court’s numerous procedural errors,         I respectfully dissent.1\n\n21\n\n\n\n           1\n             I concur, however, in the majority’s opinion insofar as it upholds the\n     defendants’ convictions and directs the district court to resentence Stewart\n     on the basis that it procedurally erred by failing to account for Stewart’s\n     likely perjury and obstruction of justice in imposing a sentence. The\n     majority also has determined that, at resentencing, the district court must\n     consider “whether Stewart’s conduct as a lawyer triggers the special\n     skill/abuse of trust enhancement under the Guidelines, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3\n     (2000), and reconsider the extent to which Stewart’s status as a lawyer\n     affects the appropriate sentence,” Maj. Op. at [124], but declined to find the\n     district court’s failure in this regard to be a procedural error. For reasons\n     I set forth, this failure was one, among several, procedural errors that the\n     majority failed to recognize.\n\f1           In imposing Stewart’s comparably insignificant sentence, the\n\n2    district judge rejected entirely a major enhancement, established\n\n3    by the Sentencing Commission under Congress’ express command,\n\n4    that applies generally to the “material support” of terrorism.\n\n5    Despite finding that Stewart’s crimes were within the\n\n6    enhancement’s “heartland,” Sent’g Tr. 108, the district court\n\n7    found that the “atypicality” of Stewart’s “material support”\n\n8    conduct in “provi[ding] a co-conspirator to a terrorist\n\n9    conspiracy” justified discarding the enhancement.    Sent’g Tr.\n10   113.   But, wholly apart from the fact that the provision of\n\n11   “personnel” falls squarely within the definition of “material\n\n12   support” provided in 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b), it trivializes\n\n13   Stewart’s conduct to even suggest that enabling a jailed\n\n14   terrorist leader, with enormous sway over his jihadist followers,\n\n15   to actively conspire with others in a scheme to kidnap and kill\n\n16   innocent people somehow mitigates the gravity of the crime.    The\n\n17   district court also based its rejection of the enhancement on the\n\n18   fact that Stewart’s conduct did not result in actual injuries or\n19   death, even though that fact is rarely, if ever, a mitigating\n\n20   circumstance, much less a reason to jettison the terrorism\n\n21   enhancement altogether.\n\n22          In addition to failing to make required findings on\n\n23   obstruction of justice based on evidence of Stewart’s double\n\n24   perjury at trial, as the majority recognizes, Maj. Op. at [122-\n\n25   124], the district court also all but ignored Stewart’s gross\n\n26   abuse of the fiduciary trust placed in her by the United States\n\n                                       2\n\f1    government, and, in the face of contrary policy statements by the\n\n2    Sentencing Commission, gave unjustified controlling weight to its\n\n3    mitigating view of Stewart’s age, health, and previous career.\n\n4    Numerous additional errors attended the radical reduction of\n\n5    Stewart’s sentence from the recommended 30 years to 2 1/3 years.\n\n6         Section 3553(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code, which\n\n7    governed Stewart’s sentence, requires that every sentence take\n\n8    into appropriate account “the nature and circumstances of the\n\n9    offense[,] and the history and characteristics of the defendant”;\n10   “reflect the seriousness of the offense”; “promote respect for\n\n11   the law”; and “adequate[ly] deter[]” similar conduct in the\n\n12   future.   18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1)-(2).      The statute also mandates\n\n13   consideration of “the need to avoid unwarr1anted sentenc[ing]\n\n14   disparities.”   Id. § 3553(a)(6).       Recognition of the full scope\n\n15   of the district court’s procedural errors makes plain that\n\n16   Stewart’s sentence fails to respect these goals and is so\n\n17   extraordinarily lenient as to manifest an abuse of discretion\n\n18   resulting in a substantively unreasonable sentence.\n19        The majority appropriately acknowledges the fine reputation\n\n20   of the district court judge, a point with which I concur.       And,\n\n21   like the majority, I commend the district court’s management of\n\n22   this complex and difficult trial.       However, the majority goes on\n\n23   to suggest, with Judge Calabresi’s concurrence being quite\n\n24   explicit, that because of the district court’s reputation, our\n\n25   review of the Stewart sentencing should be more deferential than\n\n26   would normally be the case.   This court has never recognized two\n\n\n                                         3\n\f1    classes of judges – those who are so good that their judgment is\n\n2    beyond reproach, and all the rest.   Indeed, no judge on any\n\n3    federal court, including the Supreme Court, can lay claim to\n\n4    infallibility.   Great respect for a particular judge cannot be a\n\n5    basis for overlooking what, in my view, amounts to a distortion\n\n6    of our sentencing laws.   For the foregoing reasons, and others\n\n7    that I will describe, Stewart’s sentence must be vacated and she\n\n8    must be resentenced.\n9    I. The Defendants’ Exceptionally Serious Criminal Conduct\n\n10        Sheik Abdel Rahman, Stewart’s client, is a dedicated\n\n11   terrorist leader with a large jihadist following in the Middle\n\n12   East, known as the “Islamic Group” among other names, Maj. Op. at\n\n13   [10], and a more discrete following in the United States.    See\n\n14   United States v. Rahman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765858\"><a href=\"/opinion/765858/united-states-v-omar-ahmad-ali-abdel-rahman-ibrahim-a-el-gabrowny-el/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104-05 (2d Cir. 1999) (per\n\n15   curiam).   Abdel Rahman was locked up in federal prison in\n\n16   Rochester, Minnesota, to serve a life sentence imposed in 1996,\n\n17   after he was convicted for both (1) trying to wreak havoc in New\n\n18   York City by blowing up bridges, tunnels, and buildings, and (2)\n19   attempting to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.    See\n\n20   id. at 148.\n\n21        For two years, 2000 and 2001, the defendants in this case —\n\n22   Sattar, another jihadist with direct links back to Abdel Rahman’s\n\n23   Egyptian followers; Stewart, Abdel Rahman’s lawyer; and Yousry,\n\n24   Stewart’s student interpreter — made sure that Abdel Rahman could\n\n25   continue to communicate with his jihadist cohorts.   The\n\n26   Department of Justice had employed “Special Administrative\n\n                                      4\n\f1    Measures” (SAMs) specifically designed to prevent such\n\n2    communications while still enabling an imprisoned terrorist to\n\n3    speak to, and be effectively represented by his attorney.\n\n4    Compliance with the SAMs system largely depends upon the trust\n\n5    placed in the attorney.       In accordance with the SAMs, Stewart,\n\n6    repeatedly swore under oath that she would not transmit any non-\n\n7    legal communications to or from Abdel Rahman.           She swore falsely.\n\n8    Undeterred by the SAMs, Stewart, assisted by Yousry, executed a\n\n9    scheme of lies and deception against the government to keep the\n10   lines of communication open between Abdel Rahman and Sattar, and,\n\n11   through Sattar, the Egyptian jihadists.          These communications\n\n12   included a declaration by Abdel Rahman that he was withdrawing\n\n13   his support for a tenuous cease-fire that, for some time, had\n\n14   aimed at curbing violent attacks by Abdel Rahman’s followers upon\n\n15   targets in Egypt.2     Stewart even went so far as to deliver this\n\n16   statement to an Arab journalist on Abdel Rahman’s behalf, which\n\n17   resulted in the message’s wide dissemination through the media in\n\n18   the Middle East.\n19         The federal crimes committed by the defendants are numerous.\n\n20   All three conspired to defraud the United States, in violation of\n\n21   18 U.S.C. § 371.     Rahman, Sattar, and other jihadists conspired\n\n22   to kill and to kidnap persons in a foreign country, in violation\n\n23   of 18 U.S.C. § 956(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), and solicited crimes of\n\n\n\n           2\n             The cease-fire’s fragility is evident from its inability to stop an\n     Islamic Group faction from slaughtering sixty tourists in Luxor, Egypt in\n     1997. See Douglas Jehl, 70 Die in Attack at Egypt Temple, N.Y. Times, Nov.\n     18, 1997, at A1.\n\n                                           5\n\f1    violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 373.   Stewart and Yousry,\n\n2    both individually and in conspiracy, provided and concealed\n\n3    material support to terrorist activity — namely Rahman’s and\n\n4    Sattar’s conspiracy to kill and to kidnap — in violation of 18\n\n5    U.S.C. §§ 371, 2339A.   Additionally, Stewart made multiple false\n\n6    statements to the Department of Justice and to the Bureau of\n\n7    Prisons, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.   Such behavior\n\n8    constitutes extraordinarily serious, indeed horrendous, criminal\n\n9    conduct; that there was no evidence that her conduct ultimately\n10   resulted in death and injury to innocent people was due to law\n\n11   enforcement’s diligence, and not to any lack of effort by the\n\n12   defendants or their confederates.\n\n13        For such crimes, the advisory Sentencing Guidelines\n\n14   effective on November 1, 2000, applicable here, provided for\n\n15   lengthy sentences:   life imprisonment for Sattar, 360 months\n\n16   imprisonment for Stewart, and 78 to 97 months imprisonment for\n\n17   Yousry.   A Guidelines recommendation, of course, is just that — a\n\n18   recommendation — and a district judge has considerable discretion\n19   to sentence outside of the Guidelines.   See Gall v. United\n\n20   States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594 (2007).   The district court sentenced\n\n21   the defendants well below the recommended Guidelines ranges,\n\n22   lowering Sattar’s sentence from a recommended life term to 24\n\n23   years, Yousry’s sentence from 78 months to 20 months, and\n\n24   Stewart’s sentence from 360 months to a mere 28 months.\n\n25        What is immediately striking about Stewart’s sentence is not\n\n26   simply its extraordinary 92 percent reduction from the\n\n\n                                      6\n\f1    recommended Guidelines range,3 but also the fact that the actual\n\n2    term of incarceration imposed — 2 1/3 years — is unprecedented in\n\n3    convictions for material support of terrorism.4           The Supreme\n\n4    Court has made clear that the Guidelines provide “the starting\n\n5    point and the initial benchmark” for sentencing, and that\n\n6    district judges must “remain cognizant of them” throughout the\n\n\n\n           3\n 1           In Gall, the Supreme Court instructed appellate courts not to use, as\n 2   a general matter, “the percentage of a departure [from the Guidelines] as the\n 3   standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a\n 4   specific sentence.” 128 S. Ct. at 595. This proscription recognizes that\n 5   percentages cannot speak reliably across the Guidelines ranges. See id. (“The\n 6   mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application.”). For\n 7   low Guidelines ranges, even small sentencing variances can yield large\n 8   percentages, unfairly exaggerating a district court’s action in imposing a\n 9   non-Guidelines sentence. Id. For high Guidelines ranges, major variances can\n10   yield relatively modest percentages, inaccurately representing the\n11   significance of the district court’s action. That percentages cannot always\n12   accurately measure a variance’s significance does not, however, mean that\n13   percentages are always irrelevant. When, as here, a variance from the\n14   recommended Guidelines range is extraordinarily large both in terms of the\n15   actual reduction of time to be served (a 232-month reduction) and the\n16   percentage of the reduction (92 percent), these facts taken together strongly\n17   signal the need for careful review of the justifications advanced for the\n18   challenged sentence. See id. at 597 (observing that appellate courts may\n19   reasonably expect a “major departure” from the Guidelines sentencing range to\n20   be supported “by a more significant justification than a minor one”).\n\n           4\n 1           In material support convictions after the Guidelines were deemed\n 2   advisory in United States v.

Despite the significant\n\n7    discretion accorded to district judges, we retain a limited but\n\n8    important reviewing function:    We must review sentences for both\n\n9    procedural and substantive reasonableness.\n10   II.   Relevant Legal Standards\n\n11         Our review proceeds under a “deferential abuse-of-discretion\n\n12   standard,” Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 591, and “a district court’s\n\n13   decision to vary from the Guidelines ‘may attract greatest\n\n14   respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case [to be]\n\n15   outside the “heartland” to which the Commission intends\n\n16   individual Guidelines to apply,’” Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192\n\n17   (quoting Kimbrough v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, “closer review may be in order when the\n19   sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the\n\n20   judge’s view that the Guidelines range fails properly to reflect\n\n21   § 3553(a) considerations even in a mine-run case.”    Kimbrough,\n\n22   128 S. Ct. at 575 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord\n\n23   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192.   The basic contours of our role are as\n\n24   follows.\n\n25         To evaluate procedural reasonableness, we must ensure that\n\n26   the district court, in imposing a sentence, followed the\n\n\n                                       8\n\f1   procedural steps prescribed by law.          Procedural reasonableness\n\n2   “requires that we be confident that the sentence resulted from\n\n3   the district court’s considered judgment as to what was necessary\n\n4   to address the various, often conflicting, purposes of\n\n5   sentencing.”      Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189-90.         Thus, a district court\n\n6   commits procedural error when it fails to calculate or\n\n7   incorrectly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the\n\n8   Guidelines as mandatory, neglects to consider the factors set\n\n9   forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),5 or bases its sentence on a clearly\n\n\n         5\n             Section § 3553(a) states in relevant part:\n\n                 The [district] court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not\n                 greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in\n                 paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining the\n                 particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider—\n\n                 (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history\n                 and characteristics of the defendant;\n\n                 (2) the need for the sentence imposed—\n\n                       (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\n                       respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the\n                       offense;\n\n                       (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n\n                       (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the\n                       defendant; and\n\n                       (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or\n                       vocational training, medical care, or other correctional\n                       treatment in the most effective manner;\n\n                 (3) the kinds of sentences available;\n\n                 (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established\n                 for—\n\n                       (A) the applicable category of offense committed by the\n                       applicable category of defendant as set forth in the\n                       guidelines—\n\n                             ...\n\n                 (5) any pertinent policy statement—\n\n                       (A) issued by the Sentencing Commission . . . .\n\n                                           9\n\f1    erroneous factual finding.        See id. at 190.      To avoid procedural\n\n2    error, a district court must also “adequately . . . explain its\n\n3    chosen sentence,” including the reasons that the sentence should\n\n4    be different (in this case, extraordinarily different) from that\n\n5    recommended by the Guidelines, id., in order “to allow for\n\n6    meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair\n\n7    sentencing,” Gall, 128 S.

And because\n\n2    “it is fair to assume that [the Guidelines], insofar as\n\n3    practicable, reflect a rough approximation of sentences that\n\n4    might achieve § 3553(a)’s objectives,” Rita, 551 U.S. at 350, our\n\n5    judgment of a sentence’s substantive reasonableness must be\n\n6    informed by “the extent of any variance from the Guidelines\n\n7    range,” Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597.\n\n8         In light of a district court’s wide discretion in\n\n9    sentencing, we do not “presume that a non-Guidelines sentence is\n10   unreasonable.”   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190.   But when a district\n\n11   judge chooses to step away from the Guidelines, we “must consider\n\n12   the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is\n\n13   sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.”\n\n14   Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597; accord Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190.    There\n\n15   is no “rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a\n\n16   departure as the standard for determining the strength of the\n\n17   justifications required for a specific sentence.”    Gall, 128 S.\n\n18   Ct. at 595.   Rather, our focus on the degree of deviation is\n19   derived from the “uncontroversial” proposition “that a major\n\n20   departure should be supported by a more significant justification\n\n21   than a minor one.”   Id. at 597.    Whatever the justification, its\n\n22   persuasive power depends in large part on the quality of its\n\n23   reasoning.    Accordingly, in order to determine whether the\n\n24   sentencing court acted reasonably, we must examine how it reached\n\n25   its conclusions, and determine how persuasive its stated reasons\n\n26   are in supporting its exercise of discretion.

Stewart’s Sentence\n\n14   A. The District Court’s Findings and Conclusions\n\n15         In sentencing Stewart, the district court appropriately\n\n16   began by calculating her sentencing range under the Guidelines,\n\n17   and found it to be 360 months, the statutory maximum.6             Sent’g\n\n18   Tr. 112.    Over Stewart’s objection, the district court found that\n19   the Guidelines terrorism enhancement, U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 (2000),\n\n20   applied because she had committed a “federal crime of terrorism.”\n\n21   Sent’g Tr. 107-08.      In light of the “ample evidence” showing that\n\n22   Stewart’s “actions were calculated to affect the conduct of the\n\n23   Egyptian government through intimidation and coercion,” the\n\n24   district judge held that her conduct “cannot be found to be\n\n\n           6\n             The district court calculated Stewart’s total Adjusted Offense Level\n     at 41 with a Criminal History Category of VI, yielding a Guidelines\n     “sentencing range” of the statutory maximum of 360 months of imprisonment.\n\n                                           13\n\f1    outside the heartland of the enhancement.”      Sent’g Tr. 108.     The\n\n2    district court acknowledged Stewart’s arguments that the\n\n3    enhancement did not apply, and that its effect on her Criminal\n\n4    History Category overstated the seriousness of her past conduct\n\n5    and the likelihood that she would commit further crimes.         Sent’g\n\n6    Tr. 108-09.    The district court, however, did not waver from its\n\n7    “heartland” determination, and chose to defer consideration of\n\n8    Stewart’s non-application and overstatement claims to its §\n\n9    3553(a) analysis, instead of determining whether they warranted\n10   departures within the Guidelines’ scheme.      Sent’g Tr. 109.\n\n11        The district court also declined to determine whether\n\n12   Stewart’s conduct warranted a Guidelines enhancement for her\n\n13   potential obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 (2000).\n\n14   The government had urged this enhancement based upon Stewart’s\n\n15   alleged double perjury at trial.      Sent’g Tr. 111.   The district\n\n16   court found “evidence to indicat[e] that [Stewart’s] statements\n\n17   were false.”   Sent’g Tr. 111.   The court nonetheless chose not to\n\n18   consider the enhancement’s applicability, on the basis that the\n19   Guidelines, because of the terrorism enhancement, already\n\n20   provided for the statutory maximum.      Sent’g Tr. 111.   The\n\n21   district court also noted that it believed a non-Guidelines\n\n22   sentence would be “most consistent with the [§ 3553(a)] factors.”\n\n23   Sent’g Tr. 111-12.\n\n24        Stewart sought several downward departures under the\n\n25   Guidelines.    First, she argued that she deserved a “lesser harms”\n\n26   departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5K2.11 (2000) because she\n\n\n                                      14\n\f1    committed her crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm.7\n\n2    Rejecting this argument, the district court found that “the\n\n3    circumstances of this case do not diminish society’s interest in\n\n4    punishing the conduct at issue,” and that “[t]his is not a case\n\n5    where the interest in punishment or deterrence is reduced.”\n\n6    Sent’g Tr. 109-10.      The district court also rejected Stewart’s\n\n7    request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.20 (2000),\n\n8    which applies to “aberrant behavior.”         The district court refused\n\n9    to grant this departure because Stewart’s conduct “was committed\n10   over an extended period of time, involved repeated acts of\n\n11   deception, and involve[d] significant planning.”            Sent’g Tr. 110.\n\n12   Finally, the district court stated that it would take into\n\n13   account Stewart’s requested departure for “extraordinary medical\n\n14   conditions,” pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4, when making its §\n\n15   3553(a) determination.\n\n16         Having found that the Guidelines called for Stewart to\n\n17   receive the statutory maximum of 360 months, the district court\n\n18   proceeded to its § 3553(a) analysis.         The district court cited\n\n\n\n           7\n             Specifically, Stewart claimed that her criminal conduct “was the\n     product of her perception that [Abdel Rahman’s] health and well-being were\n     seriously jeopardized by his continued imprisonment in the United States.”\n     Stewart Sent’g Br. 44-45. She explained at trial that it “was important for\n     [Abdel Rahman’s] frame of mind that he have sort of peace of mind about his\n     family, about people he had known when he was in the world, or the letters\n     that were usually sent to him.” Trial Tr. 7720-21. Stewart’s justification\n     for her conduct is patently absurd in light of evidence that her transmitted\n     messages related not to personal family matters but rather to plans to kidnap\n     and kill large numbers of innocent people, and to terrorize even more. The\n     fact that Stewart attempted to justify her potentially devastating criminal\n     conduct by citing her obligations to her client not only highlights her\n     eagerness to corrupt the role of defense counsel, but also casts serious doubt\n     on two of the district court’s purported mitigating factors: (1) the\n     unlikelihood that Stewart would provide material support to terrorism in the\n     future, and (2) the “public service” value of her work as a defense attorney.\n\n                                          15\n\f1    what it believed to be “numerous factors that argue in favor of a\n\n2    very substantial downward variance.”     Sent’g Tr. 113.   First, the\n\n3    district court noted that “this is an atypical case for the\n\n4    terrorism enhancement,” because “there are few, if any, cases\n\n5    where the thrust of the violation was the provision of a co-\n\n6    conspirator to a terrorist conspiracy.”     Sent’g Tr. 113.\n\n7    “Moreover,” the district court explained, “there is no evidence\n\n8    that any victim was in fact harmed as a result of the offense as\n\n9    charged . . . .”   Sent’g Tr. 113.     The district court also found\n10   the terrorism enhancement’s impact on Stewart’s Criminal History\n\n11   Category to be “dramatically unreasonable.”     Sent’g Tr. 113.\n\n12        The district court thus concluded that application of the\n\n13   full terrorism enhancement, “while correct under the guidelines,\n\n14   would result in an unreasonable result in this atypical case and\n\n15   produce a guideline range about quadruple the range without that\n\n16   enhancement.”   Sent’g Tr. 114.   Accordingly, the district court\n\n17   recalculated Stewart’s Guidelines range, now without the\n\n18   terrorism enhancement, to be 78 to 97 months imprisonment without\n19   the government’s requested obstruction enhancement, and 97 to 121\n\n20   months imprisonment with that enhancement.     Sent’g Tr. 114.    The\n\n21   district court then stated that these ranges did not “tak[e] into\n\n22   account the extraordinary personal characteristics of the\n\n23   defendant[,] which also argue strongly in favor of a substantial\n\n24   downward variance.”   Sent’g Tr. 114.\n\n25        Noting that “[t]he personal characteristics of the defendant\n\n26   are intertwined with several of the [§ 3553(a)] factors,” Sent’g\n\n\n                                       16\n\f1    Tr. 115, the district court then discussed at length Stewart’s\n\n2    age, health, and career.    The district court described Stewart’s\n\n3    career of “represent[ing] the poor, the disadvantaged[,] and the\n\n4    unpopular,” and concluded that it was “no exaggeration to say\n\n5    that Ms. Stewart performed a public service not only to her\n\n6    clients but to the nation.”    Sent’g Tr. 115-16.   Although\n\n7    acknowledging that, under the Guidelines, “prior good works are\n\n8    not ordinarily relevant” to a defendant’s sentence, the district\n\n9    court noted that even the Guidelines permitted “extraordinary\n10   contributions [to] take a defendant outside the Guidelines\n\n11   ra[n]ge.”    Sent’g Tr. 116.   Accordingly, the district court held\n\n12   that Stewart’s past work warranted a “substantial downward\n\n13   variance.”   Sent’g Tr. 116.\n\n14        The district court then explained that Stewart’s conviction\n\n15   would likely prevent her from ever practicing law again.       The\n\n16   court found that this “is itself a punishment,” and “means that\n\n17   the occasion for offenses will be removed and that a lengthy\n\n18   sentence of imprisonment would be an excessive one . . . for\n19   deterrence and protection of the public.”     Sent’g Tr. 116-17.\n\n20        The district court noted that Stewart was 67 years old,\n\n21   making “imprisonment . . . particularly difficult on her.”\n\n22   Sent’g Tr. 117.   And the court found Stewart’s history of\n\n23   overcoming cancer relevant, because she had a “statistically\n\n24   significant chance of recurrence” and “suffers from other medical\n\n25   conditions including sleep apnea.”     Sent’g Tr. 117.   The district\n\n26   court acknowledged that “[m]edical care can be delivered while in\n\n\n                                       17\n\f1    prison,” but found it “clear that prison will be particularly\n\n2    difficult for this defendant.”     Sent’g Tr. 117.\n\n3           Despite noting that “age and physical condition are\n\n4    discouraged factors under the guidelines,” the district court\n\n5    concluded that, “[b]ecause imprisonment will be particularly hard\n\n6    on the defendant, a lesser sentence than otherwise called for by\n\n7    the advisory guidelines would be sufficient to accomplish the\n\n8    goals of Section 3553(a)(2).”     Sent’g Tr. 117-18.   But the\n\n9    district court reiterated that there still was ”an irreduceable\n10   core of extraordinarily severe criminal conduct.”      Sent’g Tr.\n\n11   118.   The court “point[ed] out that the offenses of conviction\n\n12   were serious, involved dishonesty and breach of trust, and had\n\n13   potentially lethal consequences . . . .”     Sent’g Tr. 119.\n\n14   However, the district court felt that “the seriousness of the\n\n15   offense d[id] not wipe out the three decades of service and the\n\n16   other characteristics of the defendant and the particular effects\n\n17   of the sentence on this defendant.”     Sent’g Tr. 119.\n\n18   Accordingly, “[t]aking all of the [§ 3553(a)] factors into\n19   account,” the district court sentenced Stewart to 28 months of\n\n20   imprisonment.   Sent’g Tr. 120.\n\n21   B. The District Court’s Procedural and Analytical Errors\n\n22          The majority raises three issues concerning Stewart’s\n\n23   sentence:   (1) It does not understand why Stewart’s abuse of her\n\n24   position as a lawyer did not warrant a higher sentence, Maj. Op.\n\n25   at [120-121]; (2) it does not understand why Stewart’s sentence\n\n26   was only eight months longer than Yousry’s, despite her\n\n                                       18\n\f1    significantly more egregious conduct, Maj. Op. at [121-122]; and\n\n2    (3) it finds that the district court procedurally erred by\n\n3    ignoring Stewart’s potential perjury, which was relevant to her\n\n4    sentence under § 3553(a), Maj. Op. at [122-124].    Accordingly,\n\n5    the majority remands for resentencing, directing the district\n\n6    court to address the perjury issue, consider the abuse of trust\n\n7    enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3, and resentence Stewart.    Maj.\n\n8    Op. at [124-125].\n\n9         Although I share the majority’s three concerns and its\n\n10   conclusion that resentencing is required, the district court made\n\n11   additional, and more serious, errors that the majority overlooks.\n\n12   Notably, because the district court’s stated reasons for\n\n13   effectively removing altogether the Guidelines’ terrorism\n\n14   enhancement from its sentencing consideration of the seriousness\n\n15   of the offense cannot, in fact, mitigate the seriousness of\n\n16   Stewart’s crime, I identify procedural error in the district\n\n17   court’s application of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).   This grave\n\n18   error in assessing the seriousness of Stewart’s crime, moreover,\n\n19   was compounded by the district court’s failure to account for two\n\n20   aggravating factors plainly relevant under the Guidelines:\n\n21   Stewart’s perjury, and her persistent and blatant abuse of a\n\n22   position of trust to commit her crime.   See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n23   3553(a)(4).   While the majority acknowledges these last two\n\n24   procedural errors, its failure to recognize the error that they\n\n25   compound minimizes the magnitude of the district court’s error in\n\n26   identifying the seriousness of Stewart’s criminal conduct —\n\n                                     19\n\f1    which, in turn, contributed to other errors.\n\n2         Without a reasonable assessment of the seriousness of\n\n3    Stewart’s crime, the district court could not reliably determine\n\n4    the sentence necessary to afford adequate general and specific\n\n5    deterrence for crimes of material support of terrorism.    See 18\n\n6    U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B).   The district court’s error in assessing\n\n7    the seriousness of Stewart’s crime further precluded a reliable\n\n8    determination of the sentence necessary to avoid unwarranted\n\n9    disparities with similarly situated criminals.    See 18 U.S.C. §\n10   3553(a)(6).\n\n11        Moreover, the district court’s error in assessing the\n\n12   seriousness of Stewart’s crime prompted it to accord Stewart’s\n\n13   age, health, and career mitigating weight that they cannot\n\n14   reasonably bear.   The totality of these procedural errors, all\n\n15   originating in a disturbing misunderstanding of the seriousness\n\n16   of Stewart’s conduct, contributed to a sentence that so\n\n17   trivializes the terrorism crimes of conviction as to present a\n\n18   rare occurrence in this court: a sentence that cannot be deemed\n19   to fall within the wide range of substantively reasonable choices\n\n20   available to a sentencing judge.     Cf. Jones, 531 F.3d at 174.\n\n21        1. Assessing the Seriousness of Stewart’s Crime as Required\n\n22        by § 3553(a)(2)(A)\n\n23             a. The Terrorism Enhancement\n\n24        In 1994, Congress’ expressly mandated that the Sentencing\n\n25   Commission provide for a terrorism enhancement to ensure that\n\n26   crimes of terrorism were met with a punishment that reflected\n\n\n                                     20\n\f1    their extraordinary seriousness.             See Violent Crime Control and\n\n2    Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, § 120004, 108 Stat.\n\n3    1796, 2022.       The Commission accordingly created an enhancement\n\n4    that operates both vertically, increasing the offense level to\n\n5    indicate the seriousness of the crime, and horizontally\n\n6    increasing the defendant’s Criminal History Category to reflect\n\n7    the need for deterrence, regardless of the defendant’s prior\n\n8    record. See U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 (2000).8            As the majority\n\n9    acknowledges, the Sentencing Commission “unambiguously cast a\n10   broad[] net” when drafting the terrorism enhancement.               Maj. Op.\n\n11   at [95] (quoting United States v. Mandhai, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76685\"><a href=\"/opinion/76685/united-states-v-imran-mandhai/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1247\n\n12   (11th Cir. 2004)).         The import of this enhancement “could not be\n\n13   clearer”:      It reflects Congress’ and the Commission’s policy\n\n14   judgment “that an act of terrorism represents a particularly\n\n15   grave threat because of the dangerousness of the crime and the\n\n16   difficulty of deterring and rehabilitating the criminal, and thus\n\n17   that terrorists and their supporters should be incapacitated for\n\n18   a longer period of time.”         United States v. Meskini, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780806\"><a href=\"/opinion/780806/united-states-v-abdel-ghani-meskini-also-known-as-eduardo-rocha-mokhtar/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n19   91-92 (2d Cir. 2003) (emphasis added).            Under the applicable\n\n20   Guidelines, the enhancement increases the Guidelines sentence for\n\n\n           8\n               The terrorism enhancement provides:\n\n                   (a) If the offense is a felony that involved, or was\n                   intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism, increase\n                   by 12 levels; but if the resulting offense level is less\n                   than level 32, increase to level 32.\n\n                   (b) In each such case, the defendant's criminal history\n                   category from Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal\n                   Livelihood) shall be Category VI.\n\n     U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 (2000).\n\n                                             21\n\f1    a terrorism crime to a minimum of 210 months or 17 1/2 years;\n\n2    particularly serious crimes, such as Stewart’s, have even higher\n\n3    sentences after the enhancement is applied.9\n\n4          Despite finding that Stewart’s crime fell within the\n\n5    terrorism enhancement’s “heartland,” in sentencing Stewart under\n\n6    § 3553(a), the district court jettisoned the enhancement\n\n7    wholesale — and from that lower platform, reduced her sentence\n\n8    considerably further.      Effectively, the district court sentenced\n\n9    Stewart as though she had committed no “federal crime of\n10   terrorism,” U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 (2000), at all, even though the jury\n\n11   and the district court itself had expressly found to the\n\n12   contrary.    I conclude that the district court manifestly abused\n\n13   its discretion in doing so.\n\n14         Whatever the merits of the district court’s disregard of the\n\n15   enhancement on the basis that it overstated Stewart’s criminal\n\n16   history, the district court’s complete elimination of the\n\n17   enhancement’s vertical component, which entirely wiped out the\n\n18   enhancement’s effect, cannot withstand scrutiny in light of the\n19   district court’s obligation to impose a sentence sufficient to\n\n20   reflect the seriousness of the crime of conviction.            The district\n\n21   court offered two rationales for ignoring the terrorism\n\n22   enhancement’s vertical effect when determining Stewart’s\n\n23   sentence:    the “atypical” nature of Stewart’s crime, and the lack\n\n24   of evidence of harm to victims.        Neither rationale is sustainable\n\n           9\n             As previously noted, the district court calculated the Guidelines\n     “sentencing range” to be the statutory maximum of 360 months of imprisonment.\n\n\n                                          22\n\f1    in this case.\n\n2         First, the district court stated that Stewart’s conviction\n\n3    was “an atypical case for the terrorism enhancement” despite\n\n4    concluding minutes earlier that Stewart’s conduct “cannot be\n\n5    found to be outside the heartland of the enhancement.”    Sent’g\n\n6    Tr. 108, 113.   The “atypical” heartland conduct, the district\n\n7    court added, was “the provision of a co-conspirator to a\n\n8    terrorist conspiracy.”    Sent’g Tr. 113.   The district court did\n\n9    not explain this conclusion, nor can the record support a\n\n10   reasonable explanation.   At the outset, I question the\n\n11   atypicality of this conduct as a mitigating factor.    Congress\n\n12   itself has made plain that giving material support, which is a\n\n13   crime of terrorism under the Guidelines, can be satisfied\n\n14   entirely by the provision of “personnel.”    See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n15   2339A(b) (including the provision of personnel in the definition\n\n16   of “material support”).   Indeed, it is absurd and therefore\n\n17   necessarily unreasonable to even suggest that enabling an\n\n18   incarcerated terrorist leader with enormous influence to actively\n19   conspire with others in a scheme to kidnap and kill innocent\n\n20   persons somehow mitigates the seriousness of the crime.\n\n21        Sheik Abdel Rahman was no ordinary “co-conspirator.”      He was\n\n22   the head of the snake, a spiritual leader of a violent terrorist\n\n23   group whose words carried the force of a holy writ among his\n\n24   followers, and a man serving a life term for conspiring to bring\n\n25   deadly chaos to New York City.   See Rahman, 189 F.3d at 103-11.\n\n26   After Abdel Rahman’s influence had been sapped by the\n\n                                      23\n\f1    incarceration and isolation attending his lawful conviction,\n\n2    Stewart’s crimes specifically targeted undoing this protection by\n\n3    successfully enabling Abdel Rahman, as the Islamic Group’s\n\n4    spiritual leader, to communicate with his followers and to\n\n5    support the renewal of bloodshed.      Abdel Rahman’s unique stature\n\n6    in the terrorist world surely renders Stewart’s crime “atypical,”\n\n7    but this atypicality is an aggravating factor, not a mitigating\n\n8    one, thereby making Stewart more culpable than a defendant\n\n9    engaged in more “typical” material support, such as providing\n10   money or a cache of firearms to a terrorist group.\n\n11        Although material support of terrorism may cover a\n\n12   “multitude of sins,” as Judge Calabresi’s concurrence states, Op.\n\n13   of J. Calabresi at [3], this observation does no work in\n\n14   justifying a district court’s complete disregard of the terrorism\n\n15   enhancement, particularly in this case.     The tie that binds each\n\n16   of the material support sins is that they promote terrorism.     The\n\n17   procedural concern in this case is not with where Stewart’s\n\n18   culpability falls on the spectrum: it is with whether she is\n19   placed on the terrorism spectrum at all.     Removing Stewart from\n\n20   the spectrum on account of the nature of her sins is particularly\n\n21   egregious given that Stewart’s conduct supported Abdel Rahman, a\n\n22   terrorist at the highest level.\n\n23        Beyond erroneously finding mitigating atypicality in\n\n24   “provi[ding] a co-conspirator to a terrorist conspiracy,” Sent’g\n\n25   Tr. 113, the district judge offered no further explanation of how\n\n26   or why Stewart’s “atypical” conduct should lessen Stewart’s\n\n                                       24\n\f1    culpability or contribute to the wholesale rejection of the\n\n2    terrorism enhancement, after he had found that conduct to be\n\n3    within the enhancement’s “heartland.”          As a result, we are left\n\n4    only with the district judge’s bare assertion of atypicality,\n\n5    which cannot reasonably support the complete rejection of the\n\n6    terrorism enhancement.       See Cavera, 550 F.3d at 193.\n\n7          The district court’s second rationale for disregarding the\n\n8    terrorism enhancement — the absence of evidence that Stewart’s\n\n9    terrorism crimes resulted in actual harm — is similarly flawed.10\n10   Several points must be made before explaining why this reasoning\n\n11   amounted to procedural error.        First, the absence of harm is in\n\n12   no sense attributable to Stewart.          Alaa Abdul Raziq Atia, the\n\n13   leader of the violent faction of the Islamic group, including\n\n14   Abdel Rahman, was located and killed by Egyptian authorities\n\n15   after the cease-fire was lifted but before he could act upon it.\n\n16   Second, the district court did not simply consider the absence of\n\n17   harm as a factor to lessen the effect of the terrorism\n\n18   enhancement; it used that fortuity to completely eliminate the\n19   effect of the terrorism enhancement, so that Stewart, in\n\n20   substance, was punished as if she had committed no crime of\n\n21   terrorism at all.      Third, the district court provided no reason,\n\n22   much less a persuasive one, for why the absence of death or\n\n23   injury should have this steep mitigating effect on Stewart’s\n\n24   sentence.\n\n\n           10\n              Because the district court’s flawed reliance on the absence of harm\n     in this case also infected Sattar’s and Yousry’s sentences, I would vacate\n     their sentences and remand for resentencing as to them as well.\n\n                                           25\n\f1            The majority, by its silence, endorses the district court’s\n\n2    deeply flawed reliance on the fortuity that Stewart’s crimes did\n\n3    not have the horrific consequences that she and Abdel Rahman\n\n4    intended.    In doing so, the majority fails to appreciate the\n\n5    unique nature of terrorism support crimes, and the enhancement\n\n6    punishment they warrant as envisioned by Congress.            Judge\n\n7    Calabresi’s concurrence mistakenly equates such crimes to\n\n8    ordinary crimes and attempts, and erroneously permits the\n\n9    district court to eliminate the enhancement altogether primarily\n10   because the intended destruction of innocent life did not come to\n\n11   pass.    Op. of J. Calabresi at [6].\n\n12           Congress and the Sentencing Commission plainly intended for\n\n13   crimes of terrorism to be fully punishable without regard to\n\n14   whether, due to events beyond the defendant’s control, the\n\n15   defendant’s conduct failed to achieve its intended deadly\n\n16   consequences.     Such intent is plain from the many criminal\n\n17   statutes and Guidelines unrelated to terrorism that specifically\n\n18   account for the level or absence of injury, while the material\n19   support statute and terrorism enhancement do not.11           Moreover,\n\n20   Congress amended Stewart’s statute of conviction in 2001 so that\n\n21   causing death increased the statutory maximum from 15 years to\n\n\n\n\n           11\n              See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2119 (varying maximum penalty for carjacking\n     based on injuries caused); U.S.S.G. § 2A1.5(c)(1) (2000) (increasing offense\n     level for conspiracy or solicitation to commit murder if the offense resulted\n     in the death of a victim); id. § 2A2.2(b)(3) (2000) (varying offense level for\n     aggravated assault based on the victim’s injuries).\n\n                                          26\n\f1    life imprisonment.12     Contrary to the suggestion in Judge\n\n2    Calabresi’s concurrence that the achievement of harm cannot be an\n\n3    aggravating factor unless the absence of such harm is a\n\n4    mitigating factor, Op. of J. Calabresi at [9], Congress has been\n\n5    unmistakably clear that, as a general matter, the achievement of\n\n6    actual harm may aggravate the seriousness of a terrorism crime\n\n7    but that the absence of such harm does not mitigate such a crime.\n\n8    Thus Judge Calabresi’s analogy to a two-way elevator is flawed in\n\n9    terrorism cases.\n\n10         There can be little doubt that Congress and the Commission\n\n11   expected the terrorism enhancement to reflect the seriousness of\n\n12   a material support crime regardless of the absence of injury.\n\n13   The district court’s decision to place substantial mitigating\n\n14   weight upon the absence of harm is thus so far contrary to the\n\n15   policy choices of Congress and the Commission that it cannot be\n\n16   deemed reasonable under § 3553(a)(1)(A) without persuasive\n\n17   explanation.

Ct.558, 575\n\n18   (2007).\n19         Unremarkably, courts routinely, and unflinchingly, apply the\n\n20   terrorism enhancement in the absence of proven harm.13            Here, the\n\n           12\n             See Uniting and Strengthening America By Providing Appropriate Tools\n     Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, Pub.

It is for this\n\n15   reason that lack of success cannot normally be a mitigating\n\n16   factor even though achievement of harm may be an aggravating\n\n17   factor.    Permitting a district judge to require success in\n\n18   harming innocents before he will apply the terrorism enhancement\n19   in a “heartland” case is to permit that judge to disregard the\n\n20   fact that material support is itself a fully completed crime.\n\n21        The majority states that “[f]ortuitous events are not\n\n22   categorically irrelevant to the determination of a just\n\n23   punishment nor is their consideration necessarily inappropriate.”\n\n24   Maj. Op. at [100].     As a general matter, of course, I agree.    In\n\n25   addition, I do not mean to suggest that there can never be a\n\n26   terrorism case in which absence of harm might be an appropriate\n\n                                       29\n\f1    consideration, only that there is a very broad heartland of cases\n\n2    in which it should not be considered.     If, for example, an\n\n3    incompetent terrorist satisfies the enhancement by putting a\n\n4    small amount of arsenic into a reservoir for New York’s drinking\n\n5    water with every intention of killing thousands, but without\n\n6    understanding that the quantity is insufficient to cause harm,\n\n7    the complete absence of any practical possibility that the plot\n\n8    could cause harm may well be relevant.     But, that is far from the\n\n9    instant case, in which Stewart’s actions were designed to\n10   embolden Rahman’s followers to resume a murderous jihad against\n\n11   scores of innocent individuals in Egypt and elsewhere.     In this\n\n12   case, it was unreasonable for the district court to place any\n\n13   weight on the fortuitous and attenuated events that saved the\n\n14   potential victims of Stewart’s crime, much less to use it to wipe\n\n15   out the congressionally mandated terrorism enhancement.\n\n16          Judge Calabresi’s attempt to defend the district court’s\n\n17   analysis, by offering a hypothetical comparing the punishment of\n\n18   a terrorist who succeeds in causing harm with the punishment of\n19   one who does not misses the mark.      See Op. of J. Calabresi at\n\n20   [9].   The question at issue is not whether the amount of harm can\n\n21   never be a factor in sentencing.      It is whether the terrorist who\n\n22   attempts to detonate a bomb in a public place, with the intent of\n\n23   killing many innocent Americans, should be able to escape the\n\n24   terrorism enhancement altogether simply because his plan happens\n\n25   to fail or be foiled by authorities.     The answer, as the\n\n26   Sentencing Commission has made clear, is no.     A more persuasive\n\n                                      30\n\f1    reason than the mere absence of injury must be provided by the\n\n2    district judge who uses that factor to eliminate the terrorism\n\n3    enhancement.   To permit a judge to completely set aside the\n\n4    enhancement in a “heartland” case simply because the terrorist\n\n5    did not succeed, without further explanation as to why that case\n\n6    is sui generis, is to overlook the reality that the objective of\n\n7    terrorism is to kill large numbers of innocent people and that\n\n8    maximum deterrence needs to be achieved irrespective of success.\n\n9         Actual harm is a flawed metric when determining culpability\n10   in material support prosecutions.    Precisely because of the\n\n11   devastating consequences at stake, it is, and should be, the\n\n12   focus of enforcement authorities to make every effort to prevent\n\n13   those consequences before they occur.   When enforcement\n\n14   authorities are successful, it is to their great credit and their\n\n15   efforts should in no sense lessen the deterrent effect of\n\n16   punishment by conferring a sentencing benefit on those whose\n\n17   efforts were thwarted.   Indeed, the House Report accompanying the\n\n18   Comprehensive Antiterrorism Act of 1995, which criminalized the\n19   material support of terrorism, explained that one of the\n\n20   legislation’s primary goals was to “enhance [law enforcement’s]\n\n21   capability of thwarting, frustrating, and preventing terrorist\n\n22   acts before they result in death and destruction.”   H.R. Rep. No.\n\n23   104-383, at 42 (1995) (emphasis added).\n\n24        I fully recognize that district judges must develop ways of\n\n25   distinguishing whether and why one form of material support is\n\n26   more or less reprehensible than another, given the broad range of\n\n\n                                     31\n\f1    conduct that the material support statute criminalizes, see 18\n\n2    U.S.C. § 2339A.   However, it makes little sense to have the\n\n3    presence or absence of resultant harm to victims be a factor in\n\n4    that determination.    Cf. United States v. Whiteskunk, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">5</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">    1244, 1251 (10th Cir. 1998) (finding it “unfair not to recognize\n\n6    and accommodate th[e] varying spectrum of culpability” when\n\n7    sentencing for a “broad category of conduct” (emphasis added)).\n\n8    Because material support providers often have been, and hopefully\n\n9    will continue to be, apprehended before the crimes that they\n10   foster come to fruition, the lack of physical injury is more\n\n11   likely to be the norm than the exception.\n\n12        Accordingly, the lack of injury here was not a fact of\n\n13   “critical relevance . . . distinguish[ing]” Stewart’s conduct\n\n14   “not only from that of all [her] codefendants, but from the vast\n\n15   majority of defendants convicted of conspiracy in federal court.”\n\n16   Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 600.   Giving the absence of harm mitigating\n\n17   significance thus not only fails to recognize the extreme\n\n18   seriousness of such crimes even without achievement of actual\n19   harm, it undermines one of § 3553(a)’s express goals:\n\n20   eliminating sentencing disparities.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6);\n\n21   United States v. Simpson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1442549\"><a href=\"/opinion/1442549/united-states-v-simpson/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 464 (6th Cir. 2008)\n\n22   (noting that focusing on “the defendant’s culpability” instead of\n\n23   fortuity when sentencing “prevents arbitrary disparities”\n\n24   (emphasis added)).    The happenstance lack of devastating injury\n\n25   implicit in terrorism crimes generally and Stewart’s in\n\n26   particular simply cannot “bear the weight” the district court\n\n\n                                      32\n\f1    assigned to it.   Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191.   The district court\n\n2    acted unreasonably by using the absence of proven harm to justify\n\n3    completely discarding the terrorism enhancement and to support an\n\n4    unwarranted mitigation of the seriousness of the crime of\n\n5    conviction.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).\n\n6         My colleagues in the majority also suggest that because\n\n7    Stewart’s terrorism crimes preceded the events of September 11,\n\n8    2001 her view of her own culpability might have been different\n\n9    than would be true after that tragic day.    While such a lack of\n10   awareness may be true of the ordinary New Yorker, such\n\n11   attribution is ill-suited for Stewart who, as Abdel Rahman’s\n\n12   lawyer, sat through extensive horrific evidence at his trial,\n\n13   including that the Islamic Group was responsible for the\n\n14   slaughter of scores of innocent tourists at Luxor and the Islamic\n\n15   Group’s plans to bring New York to its knees by blowing up\n\n16   buildings, bridges, tunnels, and by assassinating the Egyptian\n\n17   President while in New York City.\n\n18              b. The Absence of an Enhancement for Perjury and\n19              Obstruction of Justice\n\n20        After jettisoning the terrorism enhancement in assessing the\n\n21   seriousness of Stewart’s crime of conviction pursuant to §\n\n22   3553(a)(2)(A), the district court then noted that — with this\n\n23   mitigation — the Guidelines would provide for a sentencing range\n\n24   for Stewart of either 78 to 97 months or 97 to 121 months,\n\n25   depending on whether the obstruction of justice enhancement\n\n26   applied.   I join the majority’s view that the district court’s\n\n\n                                     33\n\f1    failure to make any findings regarding obstruction was\n\n2    procedurally unreasonable.    Maj. Op. at [124].    The district\n\n3    court’s reason for not making such findings was that there was no\n\n4    point in doing so, because the terrorism enhancement took the\n\n5    sentence to the statutory maximum.    After the district court\n\n6    discarded the terrorism enhancement, however, the obstruction\n\n7    enhancement became relevant to the Guidelines calculation.     In\n\n8    addition, as the majority notes, it was error for the district\n\n9    court not to account for Stewart’s potential perjury in the §\n\n10   3553(a) calculus.    See Cavera, 550 F.3d at 190.\n\n11              c. The Absence of an Enhancement for Abuse of Trust\n\n12        The majority properly faults the district court for failing\n\n13   to “explain how and to what extent the sentence reflected the\n\n14   seriousness of the crimes of conviction in light of the fact that\n\n15   Stewart was . . . a member of the bar when she committed them.”\n\n16   Maj. Op. at [121].    The majority asks whether, in that light,\n\n17   “her punishment should have been greater than it was,” and then\n\n18   suggests the obvious answer.    Maj. Op. at [121].   I agree with\n\n19   the majority’s criticism.    As a “guardian[] of the law,” a lawyer\n\n20   has a special obligation to “refrain from all illegal and morally\n\n21   reprehensible behavior.”    New York Code of Professional\n\n22   Responsibility, Preamble, EC 1-5 (effective through March 31,\n\n23   2009).   However, the majority does not go far enough.    Stewart\n\n24   was not just a lawyer who committed crimes.    And she did not use\n\n25   her professional position simply to gain access to her client and\n\n26   to carry his jihadist messages by criminal means, conduct that,\n\n                                      34\n\f1    as noted in the previous section of this opinion reflects an\n\n2    extreme seriousness unreasonably overlooked by the district\n\n3    court.    Stewart also committed her material support crimes by\n\n4    garnering the trust of the government, and then blatantly\n\n5    violating that trust — a fiduciary obligation that lies at the\n\n6    core of the SAMs system and that protects the right to counsel,\n\n7    even for convicted terrorists.\n\n8         Under the Guidelines, the abuse-of-trust enhancement applies\n\n9    when a defendant has “abused a position of public or private\n10   trust . . . in a manner that significantly facilitated the\n\n11   commission or concealment of the offense.”           U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3\n\n12   (2000).   As the Commentary explains, a position of trust is\n\n13   “characterized by professional or managerial discretion,” for\n\n14   “[p]ersons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to\n\n15   significantly less supervision than employees whose\n\n16   responsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature,” id.\n\n17   cmt. n.1 (2000), and “[s]uch persons generally are viewed as more\n\n18   culpable,” id. cmt. background (2000).\n19        The district court failed to explain why an enhancement for\n\n20   abuse of trust is not plainly appropriate in this case.              The\n\n21   majority fails to fault the district court on this score because\n\n22   “the government did not specifically invoke section 3B1.3 in its\n\n23   sentencing memorandum.”      Maj. Op. at [121 n.37].        But the\n\n24   government explicitly argued for consideration of Stewart’s abuse\n\n25   of trust at the sentencing hearing:\n26        [T]he United States Attorney’s Office who was administering the SAMs\n27        trusted Ms. Stewart, put their faith in Ms. Stewart that she was\n\n\n                                       35\n\f1         doing what she promised to do.      She considered that attorney\n2         affirmation that she signed an oath, a promise.      Those are her\n3         words. And the government accepted that commitment and believed she\n4         would honor that commitment, but she violated that trust that was\n5         put in her by the United States Attorney’s Office, by the Justice\n6         Department, repeatedly violated [it].\n7\n8    Sent’g Tr. 95.    As a result, the issue was properly before the\n\n9    district court.\n\n10        The SAMs placed trust in Stewart because she was a member of\n\n11   the bar appointed under the Criminal Justice Act to represent\n\n12   Abdel Rahman, and she made explicit affirmations to the\n\n13   government specifically required to curb her client’s ability to\n\n14   continue terrorist activities.       Only because of the SAMs did\n\n15   Stewart have private access to, and “significantly less\n\n16   supervision” in her contacts with, Abdel Rahman, U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3\n\n17   cmt. n.1 (2000), and obtain the freedom she needed to act as his\n\n18   lawyer.   Stewart used, or more accurately abused, the trust that\n\n19   the government placed in her to “facilitat[e] the commission . .\n\n20   . of [her] offense,” id., furthering terrorist communications\n\n21   that put innocent lives in jeopardy.         Stewart was only given\n\n22   access to Abdel Rahman to discuss legal matters; instead, she\n\n23   engaged in criminal actions that, as she conceded at trial, had\n24   nothing to do with any past, pending, or future legal proceedings\n\n25   and were unrelated to the rendering of legal advice.            See Trial\n\n26   Tr. 7722 (acknowledging that Abdel Rahman’s “appeals [were]\n\n27   exhausted, with no issue legally on the horizon”).\n\n28        Stewart’s abuse of trust is particularly significant because\n\n29   it supports the arguments of those who say that our Article III\n\n30   courts, and the constitutional protections they afford, are not\n\n\n                                          36\n\f1    suited to terrorist trials.       See generally, e.g., Michael B.\n\n2    Mukasey, Civilian Courts Are No Place To Try Terrorists, Wall St.\n\n3    J., Oct. 19, 2009, at A21 (discussing the difficulties of trying\n\n4    terrorists in Article III courts).         The SAMs are designed to\n\n5    safeguard those rights, but they must necessarily be conditioned\n\n6    on attorneys respecting the trust placed in them, and cannot be\n\n7    sustained without that trust.        Stewart’s conduct thus raises\n\n8    concerns reaching even beyond her dealings with Abdel Rahman.\n\n9    Her criminal acts jeopardize, in a sensitive set of cases, the\n10   accused’s right to his choice of independent counsel, which is\n\n11   the right upon which the vindication of all of the accused’s\n\n12   other rights, and, in a larger sense, the right to a trial by an\n\n13   Article III court, depends.15\n\n14         Section 3553(a) requires a district court to consider all of\n\n15   the Guidelines relevant to a defendant’s conduct.            See 18 U.S.C.\n\n16   § 3553(a)(4); Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189 (requiring a district court\n\n17   to “conduct its own independent review of the sentencing factors,\n\n18   aided by the arguments of the prosecution and defense”).             In\n19   sentencing Stewart, the district court mentioned “abuse of trust”\n\n20   as part of the litany of her crimes and noted that Stewart\n\n21   “abused her position as a lawyer” in order to further Abdel\n\n22   Rahman’s terrorist quest.

Necessarily, the district\n\n16   court’s unreasonable underappreciation of the gravity of\n\n17   Stewart’s offense, evident from its reasoning despite its\n\n18   statements to the contrary, infected its consideration of “the\n19   need . . . to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” 18\n\n20   U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2), and “the need to avoid unwarranted sentence\n\n21   disparities,” id. § 3553(a)(6), because both factors are\n\n22   calibrated by the seriousness of the offense at stake.

In no area can the need for adequate deterrence be\n\n6    greater than in terrorism cases, with their potential for\n\n7    devastating loss of innocent life.         Similarly, an erroneous\n\n8    assessment of a crime’s seriousness precludes accurate comparison\n\n9    with equally serious crimes, to avoid unwarranted disparities.\n10   Thus, although the district court’s mishandling of the\n\n11   seriousness of Stewart’s crime constitutes reversible error on\n\n12   its own, I believe it also infects other judgments the court made\n\n13   in its mandatory § 3553(a) analysis.\n\n14         2. The District Court’s Overwhelming Emphasis on Stewart’s\n\n15         Age, Health, and Career\n\n16         The district judge found that Stewart’s “extraordinary\n\n17   personal characteristics . . . argue[d] strongly in favor of a\n\n18   substantial downward variance,” Sent’g Tr. 114, and used that\n19   finding to effectively set aside the Guidelines and their\n\n20   import.17   To be sure, it was appropriate, indeed required that\n\n           17\n 1            A district court, of course, has wide discretion to impose a non-\n 2   Guidelines sentence after properly calculating the appropriate Guidelines\n 3   range. Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597. But because the Guidelines are the\n 4   touchstone or “starting point” for sentencing, id. at 596, the entire thrust\n 5   of sentencing below or above the Guidelines is that “any deviation [is] from\n 6   the Guidelines,” id. at 597, and is to be justified in that context. Because\n 7   a district judge “must begin [his] analysis with the Guidelines and remain\n 8   cognizant of them throughout the sentencing process,” id. at 597 n.6 (emphasis\n 9   added), it is not permissible simply to set them aside in toto and to impose a\n10   sentence that bears no rational relationship to them as if they did not exist.\n11   See United States v.

But this is precisely what the\n\n                                          39\n\f1    the district judge consider Stewart’s “history and\n\n2    characteristics” under § 3553(a)(1).   But the district court\n\n3    abused its discretion by allowing this factor to overwhelm its\n\n4    consideration of “the need for the sentence imposed to reflect\n\n5    the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, .\n\n6    . . to provide just punishment for the offense, and . . . to\n\n7    afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” 18 U.S.C. §\n\n8    3553(a)(2), and by using it to justify the deep discount of 332\n\n9    months in Stewart’s sentence.   Indeed, given the magnitude of the\n10   district court’s error in evaluating the seriousness of the\n\n11   offense in this case, it could not reasonably determine what\n\n12   weight, if any, to assign to personal mitigating factors.\n\n13         Although we have no specific formula for balancing the §\n\n14   3553(a) factors, “unjustified reliance upon any one factor is a\n\n15   symptom of an unreasonable sentence,” Rattoballi, 452 F.3d at\n\n16   137, and here, the district judge’s focus on Stewart’s personal\n\n17   qualities exceeded the bounds of reasonableness in light of the\n\n18   gravity of her crimes.   Whatever weight Stewart’s career, age,\n19   and physical condition might reasonably warrant, these factors\n\n20   cannot support an unprecedentedly lenient 28-month sentence for\n\n21   what the district court itself termed her “extraordinarily severe\n\n22   criminal conduct.”    Sent’g Tr. 118; see supra note 3.\n\n23         The imposition of a 28-month prison sentence “slighted,”\n\n24   Taylor, 487 U.S. at 337, the extreme criminality of Stewart’s\n\n\n\n\n1    district judge did.\n\n                                      40\n\f1    offense18 and disregarded the manifest purpose of the Guidelines\n\n2    regime:    to avoid “unwarranted sentencing disparities,” 18 U.S.C.\n\n3    § 3553(a)(6).     See Booker, 543 U.S. at 264-65.        The Guidelines\n\n4    “reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve §\n\n5    3553(a)’s objectives,” Rita, 551 U.S. at 350, and Stewart’s age,\n\n6    health, and career simply cannot justify the degree to which the\n\n7    district judge deviated from the Guidelines pursuant to §\n\n8    3553(a).\n\n9          The district court’s apparent disregard of “the need to\n10   avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6),\n\n11   is particularly striking in light of the court’s obligation to\n\n12   consider “pertinent [Commission] policy statement[s],” id. §\n\n13   3553(a)(5).    For example, the Commission has determined that only\n\n14   “an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a\n\n15   sentence below the applicable guideline range,” U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4\n\n16   (2000) (emphasis added), yet the record indicates that Stewart,\n\n17   despite medical issues, will receive appropriate medical care in\n\n18   prison, and the district judge himself acknowledged that\n19   “[m]edical care can be delivered while in prison,” Sent’g Tr.\n\n\n           18\n 1           The district court treated Stewart’s terrorism and fraud crimes —\n 2   “particularly grave” offenses, Meskini, 319 F.3d at 92 — much more leniently\n 3   than what the Guidelines recommend for bank embezzlement, see U.S.S.G. §\n 4   2B1.1(b)(6)(B) (2000) (recommending a minimum range of 51-63 months for\n 5   embezzlement “affect[ing] a financial institution” and resulting in over\n 6   “$1,000,000 in gross receipts”), and on par with the Guidelines\n 7   recommendations for criminal trademark infringement, see U.S.S.G. § 2B5.3\n 8   (2000) (recommending a minimum range of 24-30 months for the manufacture of\n 9   infringing items exceeding $120,000 in total retail value), conspiring to\n10   steal over $5,000 of car parts, see U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(E), (5) (2000) (15-\n11   21 months), burgling a residence and stealing a $2,600 television, see\n12   U.S.S.G. § 2B2.1(a)(1), (b)(2)(B) (2000) (27-33 months), and possessing 1.5\n13   grams of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute it, see U.S.S.G. §\n14   2D1.1(c)(11) (2000) (27-33 months).\n\n                                          41\n\f1    117.   The district judge, of course, is not bound by Commission\n\n2    policy, but the record nowhere suggests that Stewart’s condition\n\n3    was sufficiently compelling to distinguish her from others in the\n\n4    prison population and to warrant any leniency on that score.     As\n\n5    for Stewart’s age, the Commission has concluded that this factor\n\n6    “is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence\n\n7    should be outside the applicable guideline range[, but it] may be\n\n8    a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline\n\n9    range in a case in which the defendant is elderly and infirm . .\n10   . .”   U.S.S.G. § 5H1.1 (2000).   Again, the district court was not\n\n11   bound by this statement.   But the district judge’s point that\n\n12   Stewart’s sentence “will represent a greater portion of her\n\n13   remaining life than for a younger defendant,” Sent’g Tr. 117,\n\n14   would apply to any older defendant, and this is not an\n\n15   extraordinary factor, such as being “elderly and infirm,” that\n\n16   can justify excessive leniency.    See Rattoballi, 452 F.3d at 136\n\n17   n.4, 137.   The district court cited both Stewart’s age (67 years)\n\n18   and health (sleep apnea; cancer survivor with a chance of\n19   recurrence) in concluding that “[a]ny sentence of imprisonment\n\n20   will be particularly difficult for the defendant.”   Sent’g Tr.\n\n21   117.   Yet as the majority notes, Maj. Op. at [26-27 n.9], Stewart\n\n22   herself apparently did not share the district court’s misgivings:\n\n23   “I don’t think anybody would say that going to jail for 28 months\n\n24   is anything anyone would look forward to, but as my clients have\n\n\n\n\n                                       42\n\f1    told me, ‘I can do that standing on my head.’”19           Stewart was not\n\n2    “elderly and infirm,” and I do not see how her age or health\n\n3    could reasonably contribute to such a significant variance from\n\n4    the Guidelines.     Advancing age and treatable medical conditions\n\n5    are not normally a ticket to overwhelming leniency, and this case\n\n6    is no different from the norm in that respect.\n\n7          Similarly, Stewart’s career of public service, as admirable\n\n8    as it seemed to the district court, can only go so far.             “[I]t is\n\n9    usually not appropriate to excuse a defendant almost entirely\n10   from incarceration because [s]he performed acts that, though in\n\n11   society’s interest, also were the defendant’s responsibility to\n\n12   perform and stood to benefit the defendant personally and\n\n13   professionally.”     United States v.

The district court placed emphasis on Stewart’s\n\n15   providing legal services to “the poor, the disadvantaged[,] and\n\n16   [the] unpopular over three decades,” Sent’g Tr. 115, but as the\n\n17   district judge himself put it, “that credit does not extend to\n\n18   the knowing violation of the law,” Sent’g Tr. 119.            Yet given the\n\n19   severity of Stewart’s conduct, this credit, which contributed\n\n20   heavily to a 332-month reduction from the recommended Guideline\n\n21   range to a 28-month sentence, goes further than the district\n\n22   court’s explanation can bear.

This is wrong.   One does not\n10   need a law license in order to materially support terrorism or to\n\n11   defraud the U.S. government.\n\n12        In sum, though we will rarely identify procedural error in\n\n13   the weight a sentencing judge assigns to relevant factors, this\n\n14   is one of those rare cases where the record of a defendant’s\n\n15   personal characteristics simply cannot bear the weight necessary\n\n16   to support the challenged sentence.     See Cavera, 550 F.3d at 192.\n\n17        3. Overall Substantive Unreasonableness\n\n18        I by no means assume that, upon resentencing, Stewart’s\n19   sentence will remain at 28 months, but I would be remiss if I did\n\n20   not comment further on Stewart’s current sentence.     Unlike the\n\n21   majority, I do not believe that this court must hold off on the\n\n22   question of substantive unreasonabless until the procedural flaws\n\n23   it identifies are remedied.    Maj. Op. at [99-100 n.33].    The\n\n24   “informed intuition of the appellate panel” has a place in\n\n25   appellate review.   See United States v.

And in the rare\n\n                                      44\n\f1    instance when a sentence imposed by a district court judge makes\n\n2    it plain that his judgment is in stark contrast with the\n\n3    appellate panel’s intuition – as evidenced, for example, by the\n\n4    comparative sentences of co-defendants – judicial efficiency\n\n5    counsels us to identify the substantive error along with\n\n6    procedural error at this time to minimize the need for subsequent\n\n7    appeals.    This is not, as Judge Calabresi suggests, the issuing\n\n8    of an advisory opinion.       Op. of J. Calabresi at [12].        Rather it\n\n9    is providing a district court with the full basis for the\n\n10   appellate panel’s remand prior to resentencing.20\n\n11         I stress that it is not the role of the appellate court to\n\n12   compare the district court’s sentence to what the appellate court\n\n13   deems the “correct” sentence.        Instead, our task is to ask\n\n\n\n           20\n              Judge Calabresi’s concurrence also contains the notion, never\n     mentioned earlier in these proceedings, that because Abdel Rahman’s two other\n     lawyers were not charged with SAMs violations some justification for a lower\n     sentence for Stewart might be found since “there might be even greater\n     disparities between a defendant and other individuals who were not charged at\n     all.” Op. of J. Calabresi at [16-17]. Judge Calabresi further suggests that\n     it is not much of an extension to permit district courts to use their\n     sentencing authority “to exercise . . . supervision” over discretionary\n     prosecutorial decisions not to bring charges where there is no claim of\n     selective prosecution. Op. of J. Calabresi at [15]. Whatever attraction\n     this idea might hold for a law review editor, it should not find a home in the\n     law.

The district court found that Stewart and Sattar\n\n20   had engaged in conduct that warranted application of the\n\n21   terrorism enhancement and that was “calculated to influence or\n\n22   affect the conduct of the Egyptian government,” see Sent’g Tr.\n\n           21\n              Judge Calabresi suggests that substantive unreasonabless should not\n     be determined when tied to procedural error than can be corrected first,\n     although if the two are distinct then it may be “plausible to address the two\n     issues at once” if the procedural error is not harmless. Op. of J. Calabresi\n     at [12]. But whether the procedural error is harmless is irrelevant to\n     substantive unreasonableness. In any event, he fails to explain the benefit\n     of a “two-step appeal” rule that can result in correcting a good district\n     judge on two separate occasions when one would suffice.\n\n                                          46\n\f1    24, 28, & 108, but that student interpreter Yousry had not,\n\n2    Sent’g Tr. 143-44.\n\n3         Nonetheless, Stewart’s sentence was much closer to that of\n\n4    Yousry, even though, as the district court noted, Yousry’s “role\n\n5    in the offenses was subservient to the others involved,” Sent’g\n\n6    Tr. 150.   Stewart was given a sentence only eight months greater\n\n7    than that of Yousry, and in relative terms, she was treated far\n\n8    more leniently.   Yousry’s conduct, unlike that of Sattar and\n\n9    Stewart, was found by the district court to not warrant the\n10   terrorism enhancement; nor did Yousry falsely sign the SAMs or\n\n11   merit consideration for obstruction-of-justice and abuse-of-trust\n\n12   enhancements.   As a result, Yousry’s Guidelines range was 78 to\n\n13   97 months, less than one-third of Stewart’s Guidelines range of\n\n14   360 months.   Yousry’s actual 20-month sentence represented just\n\n15   under one-quarter of the 88-month median of his Guidelines range,\n\n16   while Stewart’s sentence was under one-tenth of her 360-month\n\n17   Guidelines range.    Under the Guidelines, more than 260 months\n\n18   separated the sentences of Stewart and Yousry, yet the district\n19   court chose sentences that were only eight months apart.   Like\n\n20   the majority, I am puzzled by this mismatch, particularly in\n\n21   light of “the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities.”\n\n22   18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).\n\n23        Because Stewart’s sentence is so out of line with the\n\n24   extreme seriousness of her criminal conduct (and, not\n\n25   surprisingly given that fact, with what the Guidelines\n\n26   recommend), notwithstanding the considerable deference due the\n\n\n                                      47\n\f1    district court at sentencing, I conclude that Stewart’s sentence\n\n2    is not only procedurally unreasonable, but also substantively\n\n3    unreasonable and an abuse of discretion.   The district court’s\n\n4    rationale for the sentence cannot “bear the weight assigned it\n\n5    under the totality of circumstances in the case.”   Cavera, 550\n\n6    F.3d at 191.   Indeed, I am at a loss for any rationale upon this\n\n7    record that could reasonably justify a sentence of 28 months\n\n8    imprisonment for this defendant under § 3553(a).    Accordingly, in\n\n9    addition to the procedural flaws that I have identified,\n10   Stewart’s sentence should be vacated as substantively\n\n11   unreasonable and resentencing required on that basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                     48\n\f</pre>",
