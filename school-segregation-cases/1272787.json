FILED SEPTEMBER 18, 2014\n\n      John McClain and Mitchell Prince filed an action in equity to compel\n\nreformation of a deed relating to residential property located at 624\n\nMontgomery School Lane in Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County\n\n\n\nrequests for relief. McClain and Prince filed timely post-trial motions, which\n\nthe trial court denied, and they appealed to this Court1. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1\n\njudgment at the time they filed their notice of appeal, they subsequently\nperfected their appeal by filing a praecipe to reduce the decision to\njudgment. See                                 notice of appeal filed after the\nannouncement of a determination but before the entry of an appealable\norder shall be treated as filed after such entry and on the da\n                                      1\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n                                     I.\n\n     In essence, McClain and Prince assert that there are material defects\n\nboth in the deed that Michael and Theresa Power conveyed to them on July\n\n22, 2005 and in a deed of correction that the Powers executed on July 14,\n\n2010. McClain and Prince requested that the trial court compel the Powers\n\nto issue another deed of correction which\n\n     (1)   states that the property consists of two\n\n\n\n\n     (2)   conveys the property to McClain and Prince as joint tenants with\n\n           right of survivorship.\n\n                                                n A/B legal description is\n\n\n\nproperty known as Lot B.      It appears that when Wells Fargo began a\n\nforeclosure action against McClain and Prince in 2009, McClain learned that\n\nthe 2005\n\nThe 2005 deed did not have an A/B legal description. McClain and Prince\n\nseem to believe that inclusion of an A/B description would help their defense\n\nin the foreclosure action by enabling them to assert that Wells Fargo never\n\nintended to mortgage Lot B and could only foreclose on the empty lot, Lot A.\n\nWe are uncertain whether this theory makes sense. But whether it does or\n\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nnot, we still must fulfill our duty of summarizing what the trial court did in\n\nresponse to this action and analyze whether it reached the proper result.\n\n     The Powers, for their part, contend that the correct legal description of\n\nthe property is a single consolidated parcel, not an A/B parcel, because they\n\neliminated the A/B legal description in a deed of consolidation that they\n\nrecorded three years before selling the property to McClain and Prince.\n\n     McClain and Prince filed a three-count complaint seeking reformation\n\nof the deed, declaratory judgment and vacatur of the 2010 deed of\n\ncorrection. Although this controversy arose in Montgomery County, McClain\n\nand Prince prosecuted their lawsuit in Delaware County, because Delaware\n\nCounty is where the Powers now reside. Following a non-jury trial, the court\n\nordered the Powers to deliver a corrected deed to McClain and Prince which\n\nconveyed the property to them as joint tenants with right of survivorship 2.\n\nThe court also ordered that the corrected deed include the legal description\n\nadvocated by the Powers, i.e., a description of the property as a single\n\nconsolidated parcel.\n\n\n\nruling on Count I of the complaint, an equitable claim to reform the deed to\n\ninclude an A/B legal description, and add several short arguments relating to\n\nCount III. The brief does not address their declaratory judgment request in\n\nCount II of the complaint. Therefore, we will not address Count II below.\n\n2\n  This portion of the order is not at issue in this appeal and thus does not\nrequire further analysis.\n                                      3\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n                                          II.\n\n\n\nlimited to a determination of whether the chancellor committed an error of\n\nlaw or abused his discretion. A final decree in equity will not be disturbed\n\nunless it is unsupported by t\n\nKepple v. Fairman Drilling Co., 615 A.2d 1298, 1302 (Pa.1992).\n\nAlthough facts found by the chancellor, when supported by competent\n\nevidence in the record, are binding, no such deference is required for\n\nconclusions of law, which we review de novo. Id.\n\n                                          III.\n\n             The following is a summary of the evidence adduced during trial and\n\n\n\n             The Powers purchase the property in 2001.        On November 15,\n\n2001, the Powers purchased the Property by deed which is registered with\n\nLower Merion Township and recorded in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               t\n     4\n         .\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Exhibit P-12 (November 15, 2001 deed).\n4\n    Id., exhibit A (legal description in 2001 deed).\n                                           4\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n        The 2002 deed of consolidation. In 2002, the Powers decided to\n\ninstall a swimming pool on the premises5.       The Powers learned that they\n\n\n\nobtain a pool permit6.      The only way to satisfy the impervious surface\n\nrequirement was to consolidate Lots A and B into a single parcel7.\n\n        The Powers hired Jade Abstract Company to prepare a deed of\n\nconsolidation8. Jade Abstract prepared a deed that consolidated Lots A and\n\nB into a single parcel by removing the line separating Lot A from Lot B9. On\n\nJuly 5, 2002, the Township reviewed the deed of consolidation and stamped\n\nits approval on the deed10.       One week later, the Township issued the\n\nswimming pool permit11. Michael Power filed the deed with the Montgomery\n\nCounty Recorder of Deeds12, and the deed was recorded in Deed Book 5414,\n\nPage 240013.\n\n        The recorded deed of consolidation refers to a Mesko Associates\n\nstamped drawing dated June 11, 2002, the same drawing that was in Jade\n\n\n5\n    N.T. 2, pp. 277-78 (Michael Power). Trial in this case lasted two days. All\n\nare to the second day of trial.\n6\n  Id., pp. 277-78, 316 (Michael Power).\n7\n  Id.\n8\n  Id., pp. 278-83 (Michael Power).\n9\n   N.T. 2/12/13, pp. 281-83, 319 (Michael Power); Exhibit P-16 (deed of\nconsolidation), D-2 (Jade Abstract documents).\n10\n   Exhibit P-16 (deed of consolidation).\n11\n   Exhibit D-2 (Jade Abstract documents); see also N.T. 2, pp. 281, 286,\n321-22 (Michael Power).\n12\n   N.T. 2, p. 317 (Michael Power).\n13\n   Exhibit P-16 (deed of consolidation).\n                                        5\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n                uments14. The drawing states: \"Lot line to be removed on the\n\nline dividing Premises A from Premises B.\"15 Although the drawing was two\n\npages, the Recorder of Deeds recorded only one of the pages. The left half,\n\nwith the words \"lot line to be removed,\" was not recorded16. The recorded\n\nversion of the Mesko document does not say \"lot line to be removed\"17.\n\n     Despite this omission, the trial court found that the consolidation deed\n\nconsolidated the lands previously segregated as Lots A and B. The evidence\n\nsupports this finding. As noted above, Lot A was 50 feet by 205 feet, and\n\nLot B was 100 feet by 205 feet.           The boundary lines in the deed of\n                                                               18\n                                                                    -- a combination\n\nof Lots A and B19 -- and McClain admitted that the boundary lines were a\n                                               20\n                                                    . Moreover, as the trial court\n\nfound, the deed was properly recorded in the Recorder of Deeds and\n\n                one parcel those lands previously described upon the public\n                        21 22\nrecord as two\n\n\n14\n   Exhibit P-16 (deed of consolidation), D-2 (Jade Abstract documents).\n15\n   Exhibit D-2 (Jade Abstract documents); N.T. 2, p. 324 (Michael Power).\n16\n   Exhibit P-16 (deed of consolidation).\n17\n   Id.\n18\n   Exhibit P-16; N.T. 2, pp. 118-31 (McClain).\n19\n   N.T. 2, pp. 118-31 (McClain).\n20\n   N.T. 2, p. 128 (McClain).\n21\n   Trial Court Opinion, p. 7; see also id.\nthe 2002 deed [of consolidation] and its effect on the property to prove its\neffe\n22\n   McClain and Prince also argued that the deed of consolidation only\ndescribed Lot A, but not Lot B, due to its language that the entire property\n\n\n                                      6\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n     McClain and Prince agree to purchase the property in 2005. On\n\nMay 22, 2005, McClain and Prince toured the property and offered $950,000\n\nto purchase it23. The Powers rejected the offer24. On May 24, 2005, McClain\n\nand Prince raised their offer to $1,100,000.     According to McClain, they\n\nraised their offer because Michael Power told them that the property\n\ncontained two lots and gave them several documents that showed two lots,\n\nconsistent with the A/B description in the 2001 deed25.       Michael Power\n\ntestified, however, that he never had any such discussion with McClain and\n\nPrince; instead, he only discussed the pervious versus impervious surface\n\nissue with them and gave them documents to show what he meant about\n\nthis issue. Although the court did not explicitly state whom it believed, its\n\n\n\n     On May 24, 2005, following the higher offer, the parties entered into\n\nan agreement of sale26.     All discussions between the parties about the\n\nproperty took place before they signed the agreement of sale27.\n\n\n\nstatement at least once and understood both documents at the time he\n\n\n\n\nruling in favor of the Powers, we infer that it did not accept this argument.\nFor further discussion of this subject, see pp. 21-22, infra.\n23\n   N.T. 2, p. 163 (McClain).\n24\n   Id.\n25\n   N.T. 1, p. 97, 99-106 (McClain); Exhibits P-5 (Mesko sketch plan), P-6\n(neighborhood plot plan), P-\n26\n   Exhibit P-2 (agreement of sale).\n27\n   N.T. 2, p. 178 (McClain).\n                                     7\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nsigned the agreement of sale. He admitted that the property had only one\n\naddress, 624 Montgomery School Lane, and only one parcel number28.\n\n        Paragraph 26 of the agreement provided:\n\n                Representations: (A) Buyer understands that any\n                representations, claims, advertising, promotional\n                activities, brochure or plans of any kind made by\n                Seller, Brokers, their licenses, employees, officer or\n                partners are not a part of this Agreement unless\n                expressly incorporated or stated in this Agreement.\n                It is further understood that this Agreement contains\n                the whole agreement between Seller and buyer and\n                there are no other terms, obligations, covenants,\n                representations, statements or conditions, oral or\n                otherwise of any kind whatsoever concerning this\n                Sale. Furthermore, this Agreement will not be\n                altered, amended, changed, or modified except in\n                writing executed by the Parties29.\n\n\n\nstatement made any specific reference to Parcels A and B or the property's\n\nmetes and bounds description30. Nor was there anything in writing promising\n\nto convey a deed that specifically referenced Lot A and Lot B31.\n\n        Prince admitted that when he signed the agreement of sale, he did not\n\nknow that there had been two lots identified separately as Premises \"A\" and\n\nPremises \"B\"32. Nor did McClain say anything to Prince prior to closing that\n\nthe deed should have separate descriptions for Lots A and B33. Furthermore,\n\n\n28\n     N.T. 2,   p. 139 (McClain).\n29\n     Exhibit   P-2 (agreement of sale).\n30\n     N.T. 2,   pp. 155-58 (McClain).\n31\n     N.T. 2,   pp. 230, 297 (Michael Power).\n32\n     N.T. 2,   p. 355 (Prince).\n33\n     N.T. 2,   pp. 228, 342 (Prince).\n                                          8\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nMichael Power testified that he did not promise McClain that the deed would\n\nidentify and define Lots A and Lot B separately34. Power added that it was\n\nimpossible for him to make such a promise, because he had already\n\nrecorded the deed of consolidation that eliminated Lots A and B 35. Although\n\n\n\npoint, its ultimate decision in favor of the Powers suggests that it credited\n\n\n\n        McClain and Prince approached Patrick Keenan, a mortgage banker\n\nand branch manager at Wells Fargo and a good friend of McClain, to arrange\n\na loan of $825,000 for the purchase of the property36.       Keenan had no\n\nknowledge at any time during this transaction that there were two parcels\n\non the property or whether the mortgage would relate to both parcels. At\n\nno time did McClain or Prince mention that there were two parcels or\n\nindicate that they only wanted this substantial mortgage to relate only to Lot\n\nA, the empty lot37. Nor would Wells Fargo have willingly loaned this amount\n\nonly for Lot A38.     McClain admitted that he gave the bank no reason to\n\nbelieve he really only meant for the mortgage to cover Lot A39.        Prince\n\nassumed, when he applied for the mortgage, that the mortgage covered the\n\n\n\n34\n     N.T. 2, p. 293 (Michael Power).\n35\n     N.T. 2, p. 293 (Michael Power).\n36\n     N.T. 1, p. 43 (Keenan).\n37\n     Id., p. 43 (Keenan); N.T. 2, p. 186 (McClain).\n38\n     N.T. 1, p. 46 (Keenan).\n39\n     N.T. 2, p. 190 (McClain).\n                                        9\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nentire property40\n\nmortgage depended on the value of the entire property, including both\n\nlots41.\n\n       McClain and Prince had the duty under the agreement of sale to order\n\nthe title insurance commitment and policy42.          McClain obtained title\n\ninsurance from Stewart Title Insurance, which issued a five page title\n\ncommitment several days before settlement43.

On July 22,\n\n2005, the Powers conveyed title to the property to McClain and Prince.\n\nAccording to McClain, the legal description in the deed presented at closing\n\nencompassed the land in both Lot A and Lot B, but the deed that was later\n\nrecorded mysteriously changed the legal description to include only the land\n\nwithin Lot A49. Furthermore, McClain testified that Michael Power reviewed\n\n                 s   commitment50\n\ndescription of separate lots A and B, but said nothing51\n\n\n\ncourt ultimately found in favor of the Powers, the obvious inference is that it\n\n\n\n        The trial court agreed that the legal description in the recorded deed\n\nlimiting the property to Lot A was not accurate52.\n\n\n49\n  N.T. 2, pp. 68-69 (McClain); see also exhibit P-13 (recorded 2005 deed\ndescribing only the land in Lot A); Brief for Appellants, p. 12 (claim in\n\n[A/B] in the deed as conveyed and registered with Lower Merion Township\nwas switched with another legal description before the deed was recorded\n\n\n50\n     Exhibit P-9 (title commitment).\n51\n     N.T. 2, p. 69 (McClain).\n52\n\nJuly 22, 2005 is in error and is not a complete closed description of the\n                                       11\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n      Notably, the recorded deed referenced the deed of consolidation at the\n\ncorrect record number (Deed Book 5414, page 2400)53. The recorded deed\n\nalso provided that McClain and Prince are joint tenants with right of\n\nsurvivorship54.\n\n      In November 2005, McClain and Prince received a recorded copy of the\n\n2005 deed55. McClain filed the copy in his cabinet without reviewing it56.\n\n      The 2009 foreclosure action.          In January 2009, Wells Fargo\n\ncommenced a foreclosure action against the property57. In March 2009, U.S.\n\nBank commenced a second foreclosure action58.         At that point, McClain\n\nnoticed that the legal description in the 2005 deed and the property\n\ndescription in the Wells Fargo mortgage only covered Lot A59.         McClain\n\nrealized Wells Fargo might not have a mortgage on the house on Lot B and\n\ncould only foreclose on Lot A60.\n\n      Six months later, Prince filed for bankruptcy with McClain as his\n\nattorney61\n\n\n\nproperty; rather, it describes only what is identified as the former premises\n53\n   Exhibit P-13 (recorded 2005 deed). We note, however, that the 2005\ndeed states erroneously that the date of the deed of consolidation was July\n3, 2003, and that its date of recording was July 5, 2003.

On August 5, 2011, McClain and Prince filed the\n\npresent action to reform the 2005 deed through reinstatement of (1) the Lot\n\nA/B legal description that had been in the 2001 deed and (2) the joint tenant\n\nwith right of survivorship language that had been in the 2005 deed.\n\n        After trial, the court determined that the Powers\n\n              presented sufficient evidence of the 2002 deed and\n              its effect upon the property to prove its effect upon\n              title received by [McClain and Prince] on July 22,\n              2005. . .[The Powers] presented sufficient evidence\n\n62\n     N.T. 2, p. 346 (Prince).\n63\n     Id., p. 347 (Prince).\n64\n     Id., pp. 300, 313 (Michael Power).\n65\n     Exhibit P-15 (2010 deed of correction).\n66\n     N.T. 2, pp. 91-95 (McClain).\n                                       13\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n                of the absence of any mistake or misunderstanding\n                on their part concerning the consolidation of [Lots A\n                and B] into one parcel as described in the 2002\n                deed.67\n\n\n\n\n                         68\n\n\n\n        The court held that although McClain and Prince did not receive actual\n\nnotice of the existence of the 2002 deed and its consolidation of the two\n\nparcels,69 they were charged, as purchasers of the land, with constructive\n\nnotice of every matter affecting their title appearing on any deed which\n\nformed an essential link in the chain of documents through which they took\n\ntitle.70\n\n\n\n\n           71\n\n\n\n        The court thus ordered the Powers to execute and deliver a reformed\n\ndeed which (1) provides that McClain and Prince are joint tenants with right\n\nof survivorship, and (2) describes the land conveyed as a single consolidated\n\nparcel in conformity with the 2002 deed of consolidation but excludes any\n\n\n\n67\n     Trial Court Opinion, p. 8.\n68\n     Id.\n69\n     Trial Court Opinion, p. 7.\n70\n     Id.\n71\n     Id.\n                                         14\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n                                                                 72\n                                                                      .

The Remedy to Correct the Admitted Recording Error\n              is to Convey the Premises According to the Deed\n              Describing Two Lots as Intended, Executed, and\n              Conveyed by the Sellers.\n           2. The Powers Are Estopped from Asserting a Deed\n              Contrary to the One as Conveyed.\n           3. The Verdict Improperly Exceeds the Scope of the\n              Specific Relief Requested by the Plaintiffs.\n           4. The Court Can Not Compel the Recording of a Deed\n              Contrary to Lower Merion Township's Ordinances.\n           5. This Case is Not Controlled by Constructive Notice of\n              the Deed of Consolidation.\n           6. The First Deed of Correction Dated July 14, 2010\n              Must be Stricken.\n           7. The First Deed of Correction Dated July 14, 2010\n              Eliminates the Plaintiffs Rights to the Entire Parcel.\n           8. The Second Deed of Correction Dated May 8, 2013\n              Continues to Contain Errors.\n           9. The Powers Do Not Have the Ability to Execute the\n              Deeds of Correction Because They do Not Hold Title.\n\nThis number of topics (9) differs from the number of issues in the Statement\n\n\n\n\n(16). Nevertheless, we are satisfied that McClain and Prince preserved each\n\nof the nine topics in the Argument section for appeal. We also find that the\n\n72\n     Trial Court Opinion, p. 8.\n                                       15\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\norganization of the brief does not impede appellate review. Therefore, we\n\nwill review all 9 topics on the merits.\n\n\n\nremedy to correct a deed with an admitted recording error is to execute a\n\nnew deed as intended, executed and conveyed by the sellers with two\n                  73\n\n\n\n\nWe address these arguments together.\n\n        The thrust of these arguments is that the legal description in the July\n\n22, 2005 deed was the product of mutual mistake, and the trial court, sitting\n\nin equity, had the power to correct the mistake by reforming the deed to\n\ninclude an A/B legal description.         The trial court abused its discretion,\n\nMcClain and Prince contend, by refusing to make this correction.             We\n\ndisagree.\n\n        Courts of equity\n\n               have jurisdiction to reform deeds where mutual\n               mistakes appear, but proof of the mutual mistake\n               must be clear and positive. . .A party who seeks\n               reformation on the ground of mutual mistake must\n               establish in the clearest manner that the intention\n               proffered as the basis for reformation of the deed\n               existed and continued concurrently in the minds of\n               the parties down to the time of the execution of the\n               deed. . .If the evidence justifies such a finding of the\n               intention of the parties, this finding may be made by\n               the Chancellor.\n\n\n73\n     Brief for Appellants, p. 16.\n                                          16\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nDudash v.

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n        When a mutual mistake occurs in a deed, the court, sitting in equity,\n\nshould reform the deed to effectuate the intent of the parties.           Dudash,\n\nsupra, 460 A.2d at 326-27.\n\n        We conclude that the result reached by the trial court was well within\n\nits discretion, albeit for slightly different reasons than those given by the\n\ntrial court.\n\n        The trial court asserted that there was no mutual mistake 74, but it still\n\nreformed the deed        a remedy which is possible only if there was a mutual\n\nmistake.       Dudash, supra.       We hold, with all due respect for the\n\ndistinguished trial court, that there was indeed a mutual mistake. No party\n\n\n74\n     Trial Court Opinion, p. 8.\n                                        17\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nwanted the deed to convey only Lot A, yet that is what the July 22, 2005\n\ndeed stated.\n\n      The real dispute is not whether there was a mutual mistake but what\n\nthe proper remedy for this mistake should be. The Powers want the deed to\n\nconvey Lots A and B in one consolidated parcel; McClain and Prince want the\n\ndeed to convey Lots A and B in two separate parcels. The court selected the\n\n\n\nA and B in their 2002 deed of consolidation, and that McClain and Prince\n\nwere under constructive notice of this deed.    The evidence supports this\n\ndecision.\n\n      The Powers clearly intended in 2002 to obtain a deed consolidating\n\nLots A and B in order to obtain a pool permit.      The Powers hired Jade\n\n\n\ninclude a drawing which states: \"Lot line to be removed on the line dividing\n\nPremises A from Premises B.\" Lower Merion Township approved the deed,\n\nand the Powers recorded this deed with the Recorder of Deeds. Thus, the\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\nand Prince did not have actual notice of the 2002 deed at the time of\n\nsettlement in 2005, but that they did have constructive notice of the 2002\n\ndeed at the time of settlement. With regard to actual notice, Prince never\n\n\n                                    18\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nknew before settlement that the property had two lots. At the time McClain\n\nand/or Prince applied for a loan at Wells Fargo, they never mentioned to\n\nPatrick Keenan, their mortgage banker, that the property had two lots or\n\nthat the lots had been consolidated.         Furthermore, the title insurance\n\ncompany hired by McClain and Prince, Stewart Title, failed to find the deed\n\nof consolidation during its title search.   McClain and Prince did not receive\n\nactual notice of the deed of consolidation until 2009, after Wells Fargo\n\ncommenced foreclosure proceedings.\n\n      Notwithstanding the absence of actual notice, McClain and Prince had\n\nconstructive notice of the deed of consolidation. Both statutory and common\n\nlaw confirm this point.\n\n      Over one century ago, our Supreme Court held:\n\n            The general rule is that where a purchaser holds\n            under a conveyance, and is obliged to make out his\n            title through that deed, or through a series of prior\n            deeds, he is charged with constructive notice of\n            every matter connected with or affecting his title,\n            which appears by description of parties, by recital,\n            by reference, or otherwise, on the face of any deed,\n            or upon any public record, which forms an essential\n            link in the chain of instruments through which he\n            takes title or liens which affect the same.\n\nVolk v. Eaton, 69 A. 91 (1908).         This principle has carried over into\n\nstatutory law.     21 P.S. §356, entitled \"Agreements concerning real\n\nproperty,\" provides:\n\n            All agreements in writing relating to real property\n            situate in this Commonwealth by the terms whereof\n            the parties executing the same do grant, bargain,\n\n                                      19\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n            sell, or convey any rights or privileges of a\n            permanent nature pertaining to such real property,\n            or do release the grantee or vendee thereunder\n            against damages which may be inflicted upon such\n            real property at some future time, shall be\n            acknowledged according to law by the parties\n            thereto or proved in the manner provided by law,\n            and shall be recorded in the office for the recording\n            of deeds in the county or counties wherein such real\n            property is situate.\n\nD                                                 First Citizens Nat.

The trial court thus had ample reason to treat McClain and\n\n\n75\n   See also Mid-State Bank & Trust Co. v. Globalnet Inel. Inc., 735\nA.2d 79, 85 (Pa.1999) (party is on constructive notice where he could have\nlearned of facts which might affect title and also by what appeared in\nappropr\n                                     20\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nPrince as knowing of and accepting consolidation of Lots A and B in the legal\n\ndescription of the property.\n\n        In an attempt to avoid the impact of the 2002 deed of consolidation,\n\nMcClain and Prince argue that this deed only applies to Lot A but not to Lot\n\nB. McClain and Prince claim:\n\n        1. A neighborhood plot plan that Michael Powers provided to McClain\n\n        prior to the agreement of sale includes a diagram stating that Lot B is\n                                             76\n\n\n\n        2. The former land of Rush Touton shares a boundary with Lot A and\n\n        is immediately t\n\n        3. The 2002 deed of consolidation states that the entire property being\n\n        described is bounded by the former land of Rush D. Touton.\n\n        4. The land being conveyed, of course, cannot be bound by itself.\n\n        5. By process of elimination, only Premises \"A\" is conveyed by the\n\n        consolidation deed.\n\n\n\n                                                  77\n                                                       the detailed courses and\n\ndistances in the deed, along with its introductory statement of intent, make\n\nclear that the deed consolidated two previously separate lots, lots A and B,\n\ninto one parcel.     Moreover, the same details provide a complete closed\n\ndescription of the property, i.e., a complete description of every inch of the\n\n76\n     Exhibit P-6 (neighborhood plot plan).\n77\n     Brief for Appellees, p. 35.\n                                       21\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nproperty but not one i\n\n\n\nof the deed of consolidation to Lot A.\n\n      To reiterate, we hold that the parties made a mutual mistake in the\n\n2005 deed by limiting its legal description to Lot A. The trial court properly\n\nreformed the legal description to define a single consolidated parcel in\n\n\n\nnotice of the 2002 deed of consolidation.     McC\n\nargument that the 2002 deed only pertains to Lot A is devoid of merit.\n\n                                         V.\n\n\n\n\nestopped from\n\nother words, McClain and Prince assert that (1) the Powers verbally\n\npromised prior to the agreement of sale that the property had two separate\n\nlots, (2) the Powers conveyed a deed at closing with an A/B description that\n\nsomehow was replaced by a different deed that was recorded, (3) McClain\n\n\n\nthe Powers cannot renege on their promise under the doctrines of estoppel\n\nby deed78, estoppel by warranty79 and promissory estoppel80.\n\n\n78\n   See Daley v.

Since the trial court did not make an affirmative finding that it\n\ncredited this testimony, we, as an appellate court, cannot hold that this\n\ntestimony formed the basis for an estoppel claim.\n\n\n\nverdict improperly exceeds the scope of the specific relief [that they]\n\n\n\nasked for a specific form of relief in their complaint    reformation of the\n\ndeed to provide an A/B legal description      and therefore the court had no\n\npower to reform the deed in a different fashion. We disagree. When a court\n\nreforms a deed on the basis of mutual mistake, it must reform the deed to\n\nreflect the intent of the parties.   Dudash, supra.   Reforming the deed in\n\nthis manner might result in a different deed than the moving party wants,\n\nbut that is the risk that the party takes when it requests reformation. Id.\n\nAs we reasoned above, we think that the manner in which the court\n\nreformed the deed was consist\n\n\n\nis all that McClain and Prince can ask for.\n\n      In their fourth argument on appeal, McClain and Prince contend that\n\n                   compel the recording of a deed contrary to Lower Merion\n\n\n\ndecision violated an ordinance that requires registration of deeds with the\n\n\n                                       24\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\ntownship prior to recording. This ordinance, however, has not been in effect\n\nsince 2008. See 21 P.S. § 338.9 (2008 act that repealed statute permitting\n\ntownships to require registration of deeds prior to recording).         Thus, the\n\n\n\n        Even if the ordinance remained in effect in 2013, we know of no law\n\nthat prohibits a court sitting in equity from reforming a deed in a manner\n\nthat overrides a local ordinance. Furthermore, McClain and Prince admit that\n\n                                                             s ordinances are in\n\n\n\naggrieved by any violation of the ordinance and thus lack standing to\n\nenforce the ordinance in this action.\n\n        In their sixth argument on appeal, McClain and Prince assert that the\n\ncourt erred by denying the request in Count III of the complaint to strike the\n\n2010 deed of correction.       This issue does not warrant relief.    McClain and\n\n\n\nthe world that they acquiesced to this erroneous deed. Otherwise they will\n                                    82\n                                         These empty phrases do not establish that\n\nthey suffered tangible prejudice as a result of the 2010 deed.\n\n        In their seventh argument on appeal, McClain and Prince assert that\n\nthe 2010 deed of correction eliminates their rights to the entire parcel. This\n\nis incorrect. The 2010 deed did not strip them of ownership of the property;\n\n\n82\n     Brief for Appellants, p. 32.\n                                            25\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\nit merely consolidated the property into one parcel.     And while the 2010\n\ndeed failed to mention that they are joint tenants with right of survivorship,\n\nthe 2013 deed reinstates this language and thus cures any possible\n\nprejudice to their rights.\n\n      In their eighth argument on appeal, McClain and Prince state that the\n\n2013 deed of corre\n\n2013 deed properly reinstates McClain and Prince as joint tenants with right\n\nof survivorship and properly consolidates the property into one parcel.\n\n      Finally, in their ninth argument on appeal, McClain and Prince claim\n\nthat the Powers do not have the ability to execute deeds of correction\n\nbecause they do not hold title. Perhaps they do not have the ability on their\n\nown, but the court vested them with the authority to execute a deed of\n\ncorrection within its 2013 order.   We see no reason why the court cannot\n\n\n\nequitable power of reformation.\n\n\n\n      Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.

FILED SEPTEMBER 18, 2014\n\n      John McClain and Mitchell Prince filed an action in equity to compel\n\nreformation of a deed relating to residential property located at 624\n\nMontgomery School Lane in Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County\n\n\n\nrequests for relief. McClain and Prince filed timely post-trial motions, which\n\nthe trial court denied, and they appealed to this Court1. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1\n\njudgment at the time they filed their notice of appeal, they subsequently\nperfected their appeal by filing a praecipe to reduce the decision to\njudgment. See                                 notice of appeal filed after the\nannouncement of a determination but before the entry of an appealable\norder shall be treated as filed after such entry and on the da\n                                      1\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n                                     I.\n\n     In essence, McClain and Prince assert that there are material defects\n\nboth in the deed that Michael and Theresa Power conveyed to them on July\n\n22, 2005 and in a deed of correction that the Powers executed on July 14,\n\n2010. McClain and Prince requested that the trial court compel the Powers\n\nto issue another deed of correction which\n\n     (1)   states that the property consists of two\n\n\n\n\n     (2)   conveys the property to McClain and Prince as joint tenants with\n\n           right of survivorship.\n\n                                                n A/B legal description is\n\n\n\nproperty known as Lot B.      It appears that when Wells Fargo began a\n\nforeclosure action against McClain and Prince in 2009, McClain learned that\n\nthe 2005\n\nThe 2005 deed did not have an A/B legal description. McClain and Prince\n\nseem to believe that inclusion of an A/B description would help their defense\n\nin the foreclosure action by enabling them to assert that Wells Fargo never\n\nintended to mortgage Lot B and could only foreclose on the empty lot, Lot A.\n\nWe are uncertain whether this theory makes sense. But whether it does or\n\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nnot, we still must fulfill our duty of summarizing what the trial court did in\n\nresponse to this action and analyze whether it reached the proper result.\n\n     The Powers, for their part, contend that the correct legal description of\n\nthe property is a single consolidated parcel, not an A/B parcel, because they\n\neliminated the A/B legal description in a deed of consolidation that they\n\nrecorded three years before selling the property to McClain and Prince.\n\n     McClain and Prince filed a three-count complaint seeking reformation\n\nof the deed, declaratory judgment and vacatur of the 2010 deed of\n\ncorrection. Although this controversy arose in Montgomery County, McClain\n\nand Prince prosecuted their lawsuit in Delaware County, because Delaware\n\nCounty is where the Powers now reside. Following a non-jury trial, the court\n\nordered the Powers to deliver a corrected deed to McClain and Prince which\n\nconveyed the property to them as joint tenants with right of survivorship 2.\n\nThe court also ordered that the corrected deed include the legal description\n\nadvocated by the Powers, i.e., a description of the property as a single\n\nconsolidated parcel.\n\n\n\nruling on Count I of the complaint, an equitable claim to reform the deed to\n\ninclude an A/B legal description, and add several short arguments relating to\n\nCount III. The brief does not address their declaratory judgment request in\n\nCount II of the complaint. Therefore, we will not address Count II below.\n\n2\n  This portion of the order is not at issue in this appeal and thus does not\nrequire further analysis.\n                                      3\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n                                          II.\n\n\n\nlimited to a determination of whether the chancellor committed an error of\n\nlaw or abused his discretion.

On November 15,\n\n2001, the Powers purchased the Property by deed which is registered with\n\nLower Merion Township and recorded in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               t\n     4\n         .\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Exhibit P-12 (November 15, 2001 deed).\n4\n    Id., exhibit A (legal description in 2001 deed).\n                                           4\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n        The 2002 deed of consolidation. In 2002, the Powers decided to\n\ninstall a swimming pool on the premises5.       The Powers learned that they\n\n\n\nobtain a pool permit6.      The only way to satisfy the impervious surface\n\nrequirement was to consolidate Lots A and B into a single parcel7.\n\n        The Powers hired Jade Abstract Company to prepare a deed of\n\nconsolidation8. Jade Abstract prepared a deed that consolidated Lots A and\n\nB into a single parcel by removing the line separating Lot A from Lot B9. On\n\nJuly 5, 2002, the Township reviewed the deed of consolidation and stamped\n\nits approval on the deed10.       One week later, the Township issued the\n\nswimming pool permit11. Michael Power filed the deed with the Montgomery\n\nCounty Recorder of Deeds12, and the deed was recorded in Deed Book 5414,\n\nPage 240013.\n\n        The recorded deed of consolidation refers to a Mesko Associates\n\nstamped drawing dated June 11, 2002, the same drawing that was in Jade\n\n\n5\n    N.T. 2, pp. 277-78 (Michael Power). Trial in this case lasted two days. All\n\nare to the second day of trial.\n6\n  Id., pp. 277-78, 316 (Michael Power).\n7\n  Id.\n8\n  Id., pp. 278-83 (Michael Power).\n9\n   N.T. 2/12/13, pp. 281-83, 319 (Michael Power); Exhibit P-16 (deed of\nconsolidation), D-2 (Jade Abstract documents).\n10\n   Exhibit P-16 (deed of consolidation).\n11\n   Exhibit D-2 (Jade Abstract documents); see also N.T. 2, pp. 281, 286,\n321-22 (Michael Power).\n12\n   N.T. 2, p. 317 (Michael Power).\n13\n   Exhibit P-16 (deed of consolidation).\n                                        5\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n                uments14. The drawing states: \"Lot line to be removed on the\n\nline dividing Premises A from Premises B.\"15 Although the drawing was two\n\npages, the Recorder of Deeds recorded only one of the pages. The left half,\n\nwith the words \"lot line to be removed,\" was not recorded16. The recorded\n\nversion of the Mesko document does not say \"lot line to be removed\"17.\n\n     Despite this omission, the trial court found that the consolidation deed\n\nconsolidated the lands previously segregated as Lots A and B. The evidence\n\nsupports this finding. As noted above, Lot A was 50 feet by 205 feet, and\n\nLot B was 100 feet by 205 feet.           The boundary lines in the deed of\n                                                               18\n                                                                    -- a combination\n\nof Lots A and B19 -- and McClain admitted that the boundary lines were a\n                                               20\n                                                    . Moreover, as the trial court\n\nfound, the deed was properly recorded in the Recorder of Deeds and\n\n                one parcel those lands previously described upon the public\n                        21 22\nrecord as two\n\n\n14\n   Exhibit P-16 (deed of consolidation), D-2 (Jade Abstract documents).\n15\n   Exhibit D-2 (Jade Abstract documents); N.T. 2, p. 324 (Michael Power).\n16\n   Exhibit P-16 (deed of consolidation).\n17\n   Id.\n18\n   Exhibit P-16; N.T. 2, pp. 118-31 (McClain).\n19\n   N.T. 2, pp. 118-31 (McClain).\n20\n   N.T. 2, p. 128 (McClain).\n21\n   Trial Court Opinion, p. 7; see also id.\nthe 2002 deed [of consolidation] and its effect on the property to prove its\neffe\n22\n   McClain and Prince also argued that the deed of consolidation only\ndescribed Lot A, but not Lot B, due to its language that the entire property\n\n\n                                      6\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n     McClain and Prince agree to purchase the property in 2005. On\n\nMay 22, 2005, McClain and Prince toured the property and offered $950,000\n\nto purchase it23. The Powers rejected the offer24. On May 24, 2005, McClain\n\nand Prince raised their offer to $1,100,000.     According to McClain, they\n\nraised their offer because Michael Power told them that the property\n\ncontained two lots and gave them several documents that showed two lots,\n\nconsistent with the A/B description in the 2001 deed25.       Michael Power\n\ntestified, however, that he never had any such discussion with McClain and\n\nPrince; instead, he only discussed the pervious versus impervious surface\n\nissue with them and gave them documents to show what he meant about\n\nthis issue. Although the court did not explicitly state whom it believed, its\n\n\n\n     On May 24, 2005, following the higher offer, the parties entered into\n\nan agreement of sale26.     All discussions between the parties about the\n\nproperty took place before they signed the agreement of sale27.\n\n\n\nstatement at least once and understood both documents at the time he\n\n\n\n\nruling in favor of the Powers, we infer that it did not accept this argument.\nFor further discussion of this subject, see pp. 21-22, infra.\n23\n   N.T. 2, p. 163 (McClain).\n24\n   Id.\n25\n   N.T. 1, p. 97, 99-106 (McClain); Exhibits P-5 (Mesko sketch plan), P-6\n(neighborhood plot plan), P-\n26\n   Exhibit P-2 (agreement of sale).\n27\n   N.T. 2, p. 178 (McClain).\n                                     7\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nsigned the agreement of sale. He admitted that the property had only one\n\naddress, 624 Montgomery School Lane, and only one parcel number28.\n\n        Paragraph 26 of the agreement provided:\n\n                Representations: (A) Buyer understands that any\n                representations, claims, advertising, promotional\n                activities, brochure or plans of any kind made by\n                Seller, Brokers, their licenses, employees, officer or\n                partners are not a part of this Agreement unless\n                expressly incorporated or stated in this Agreement.\n                It is further understood that this Agreement contains\n                the whole agreement between Seller and buyer and\n                there are no other terms, obligations, covenants,\n                representations, statements or conditions, oral or\n                otherwise of any kind whatsoever concerning this\n                Sale.

Nor was there anything in writing promising\n\nto convey a deed that specifically referenced Lot A and Lot B31.\n\n        Prince admitted that when he signed the agreement of sale, he did not\n\nknow that there had been two lots identified separately as Premises \"A\" and\n\nPremises \"B\"32. Nor did McClain say anything to Prince prior to closing that\n\nthe deed should have separate descriptions for Lots A and B33.

Power added that it was\n\nimpossible for him to make such a promise, because he had already\n\nrecorded the deed of consolidation that eliminated Lots A and B 35. Although\n\n\n\npoint, its ultimate decision in favor of the Powers suggests that it credited\n\n\n\n        McClain and Prince approached Patrick Keenan, a mortgage banker\n\nand branch manager at Wells Fargo and a good friend of McClain, to arrange\n\na loan of $825,000 for the purchase of the property36.       Keenan had no\n\nknowledge at any time during this transaction that there were two parcels\n\non the property or whether the mortgage would relate to both parcels. At\n\nno time did McClain or Prince mention that there were two parcels or\n\nindicate that they only wanted this substantial mortgage to relate only to Lot\n\nA, the empty lot37. Nor would Wells Fargo have willingly loaned this amount\n\nonly for Lot A38.     McClain admitted that he gave the bank no reason to\n\nbelieve he really only meant for the mortgage to cover Lot A39.        Prince\n\nassumed, when he applied for the mortgage, that the mortgage covered the\n\n\n\n34\n     N.T. 2, p. 293 (Michael Power).\n35\n     N.T. 2, p. 293 (Michael Power).\n36\n     N.T. 1, p. 43 (Keenan).\n37\n     Id., p. 43 (Keenan); N.T. 2, p. 186 (McClain).\n38\n     N.T. 1, p. 46 (Keenan).\n39\n     N.T. 2, p. 190 (McClain).\n                                        9\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nentire property40\n\nmortgage depended on the value of the entire property, including both\n\nlots41.\n\n       McClain and Prince had the duty under the agreement of sale to order\n\nthe title insurance commitment and policy42.

On July 22,\n\n2005, the Powers conveyed title to the property to McClain and Prince.\n\nAccording to McClain, the legal description in the deed presented at closing\n\nencompassed the land in both Lot A and Lot B, but the deed that was later\n\nrecorded mysteriously changed the legal description to include only the land\n\nwithin Lot A49. Furthermore, McClain testified that Michael Power reviewed\n\n                 s   commitment50\n\ndescription of separate lots A and B, but said nothing51\n\n\n\ncourt ultimately found in favor of the Powers, the obvious inference is that it\n\n\n\n        The trial court agreed that the legal description in the recorded deed\n\nlimiting the property to Lot A was not accurate52.\n\n\n49\n  N.T. 2, pp. 68-69 (McClain); see also exhibit P-13 (recorded 2005 deed\ndescribing only the land in Lot A); Brief for Appellants, p. 12 (claim in\n\n[A/B] in the deed as conveyed and registered with Lower Merion Township\nwas switched with another legal description before the deed was recorded\n\n\n50\n     Exhibit P-9 (title commitment).\n51\n     N.T. 2, p. 69 (McClain).\n52\n\nJuly 22, 2005 is in error and is not a complete closed description of the\n                                       11\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n      Notably, the recorded deed referenced the deed of consolidation at the\n\ncorrect record number (Deed Book 5414, page 2400)53. The recorded deed\n\nalso provided that McClain and Prince are joint tenants with right of\n\nsurvivorship54.\n\n      In November 2005, McClain and Prince received a recorded copy of the\n\n2005 deed55. McClain filed the copy in his cabinet without reviewing it56.\n\n      The 2009 foreclosure action.          In January 2009, Wells Fargo\n\ncommenced a foreclosure action against the property57. In March 2009, U.S.\n\nBank commenced a second foreclosure action58.         At that point, McClain\n\nnoticed that the legal description in the 2005 deed and the property\n\ndescription in the Wells Fargo mortgage only covered Lot A59.         McClain\n\nrealized Wells Fargo might not have a mortgage on the house on Lot B and\n\ncould only foreclose on Lot A60.\n\n      Six months later, Prince filed for bankruptcy with McClain as his\n\nattorney61\n\n\n\nproperty; rather, it describes only what is identified as the former premises\n53\n   Exhibit P-13 (recorded 2005 deed).

On August 5, 2011, McClain and Prince filed the\n\npresent action to reform the 2005 deed through reinstatement of (1) the Lot\n\nA/B legal description that had been in the 2001 deed and (2) the joint tenant\n\nwith right of survivorship language that had been in the 2005 deed.\n\n        After trial, the court determined that the Powers\n\n              presented sufficient evidence of the 2002 deed and\n              its effect upon the property to prove its effect upon\n              title received by [McClain and Prince] on July 22,\n              2005. . .[The Powers] presented sufficient evidence\n\n62\n     N.T. 2, p. 346 (Prince).\n63\n     Id., p. 347 (Prince).\n64\n     Id., pp. 300, 313 (Michael Power).\n65\n     Exhibit P-15 (2010 deed of correction).\n66\n     N.T. 2, pp. 91-95 (McClain).\n                                       13\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\n                of the absence of any mistake or misunderstanding\n                on their part concerning the consolidation of [Lots A\n                and B] into one parcel as described in the 2002\n                deed.67\n\n\n\n\n                         68\n\n\n\n        The court held that although McClain and Prince did not receive actual\n\nnotice of the existence of the 2002 deed and its consolidation of the two\n\nparcels,69 they were charged, as purchasers of the land, with constructive\n\nnotice of every matter affecting their title appearing on any deed which\n\nformed an essential link in the chain of documents through which they took\n\ntitle.70\n\n\n\n\n           71\n\n\n\n        The court thus ordered the Powers to execute and deliver a reformed\n\ndeed which (1) provides that McClain and Prince are joint tenants with right\n\nof survivorship, and (2) describes the land conveyed as a single consolidated\n\nparcel in conformity with the 2002 deed of consolidation but excludes any\n\n\n\n67\n     Trial Court Opinion, p. 8.\n68\n     Id.\n69\n     Trial Court Opinion, p. 7.\n70\n     Id.\n71\n     Id.\n                                         14\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n                                                                 72\n                                                                      .

The Powers Are Estopped from Asserting a Deed\n              Contrary to the One as Conveyed.\n           3. The Verdict Improperly Exceeds the Scope of the\n              Specific Relief Requested by the Plaintiffs.\n           4. The Court Can Not Compel the Recording of a Deed\n              Contrary to Lower Merion Township's Ordinances.\n           5. This Case is Not Controlled by Constructive Notice of\n              the Deed of Consolidation.\n           6. The First Deed of Correction Dated July 14, 2010\n              Must be Stricken.\n           7. The First Deed of Correction Dated July 14, 2010\n              Eliminates the Plaintiffs Rights to the Entire Parcel.\n           8. The Second Deed of Correction Dated May 8, 2013\n              Continues to Contain Errors.\n           9. The Powers Do Not Have the Ability to Execute the\n              Deeds of Correction Because They do Not Hold Title.\n\nThis number of topics (9) differs from the number of issues in the Statement\n\n\n\n\n(16). Nevertheless, we are satisfied that McClain and Prince preserved each\n\nof the nine topics in the Argument section for appeal. We also find that the\n\n72\n     Trial Court Opinion, p. 8.\n                                       15\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\norganization of the brief does not impede appellate review. Therefore, we\n\nwill review all 9 topics on the merits.\n\n\n\nremedy to correct a deed with an admitted recording error is to execute a\n\nnew deed as intended, executed and conveyed by the sellers with two\n                  73\n\n\n\n\nWe address these arguments together.\n\n        The thrust of these arguments is that the legal description in the July\n\n22, 2005 deed was the product of mutual mistake, and the trial court, sitting\n\nin equity, had the power to correct the mistake by reforming the deed to\n\ninclude an A/B legal description.         The trial court abused its discretion,\n\nMcClain and Prince contend, by refusing to make this correction.             We\n\ndisagree.\n\n        Courts of equity\n\n               have jurisdiction to reform deeds where mutual\n               mistakes appear, but proof of the mutual mistake\n               must be clear and positive. . .A party who seeks\n               reformation on the ground of mutual mistake must\n               establish in the clearest manner that the intention\n               proffered as the basis for reformation of the deed\n               existed and continued concurrently in the minds of\n               the parties down to the time of the execution of the\n               deed. . .If the evidence justifies such a finding of the\n               intention of the parties, this finding may be made by\n               the Chancellor.\n\n\n73\n     Brief for Appellants, p. 16.\n                                          16\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nDudash v.

Dudash,\n\nsupra, 460 A.2d at 326-27.\n\n        We conclude that the result reached by the trial court was well within\n\nits discretion, albeit for slightly different reasons than those given by the\n\ntrial court.\n\n        The trial court asserted that there was no mutual mistake 74, but it still\n\nreformed the deed        a remedy which is possible only if there was a mutual\n\nmistake.       Dudash, supra.       We hold, with all due respect for the\n\ndistinguished trial court, that there was indeed a mutual mistake. No party\n\n\n74\n     Trial Court Opinion, p. 8.\n                                        17\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nwanted the deed to convey only Lot A, yet that is what the July 22, 2005\n\ndeed stated.\n\n      The real dispute is not whether there was a mutual mistake but what\n\nthe proper remedy for this mistake should be. The Powers want the deed to\n\nconvey Lots A and B in one consolidated parcel; McClain and Prince want the\n\ndeed to convey Lots A and B in two separate parcels. The court selected the\n\n\n\nA and B in their 2002 deed of consolidation, and that McClain and Prince\n\nwere under constructive notice of this deed.    The evidence supports this\n\ndecision.\n\n      The Powers clearly intended in 2002 to obtain a deed consolidating\n\nLots A and B in order to obtain a pool permit.      The Powers hired Jade\n\n\n\ninclude a drawing which states: \"Lot line to be removed on the line dividing\n\nPremises A from Premises B.\" Lower Merion Township approved the deed,\n\nand the Powers recorded this deed with the Recorder of Deeds. Thus, the\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\nand Prince did not have actual notice of the 2002 deed at the time of\n\nsettlement in 2005, but that they did have constructive notice of the 2002\n\ndeed at the time of settlement. With regard to actual notice, Prince never\n\n\n                                    18\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\nknew before settlement that the property had two lots. At the time McClain\n\nand/or Prince applied for a loan at Wells Fargo, they never mentioned to\n\nPatrick Keenan, their mortgage banker, that the property had two lots or\n\nthat the lots had been consolidated.         Furthermore, the title insurance\n\ncompany hired by McClain and Prince, Stewart Title, failed to find the deed\n\nof consolidation during its title search.   McClain and Prince did not receive\n\nactual notice of the deed of consolidation until 2009, after Wells Fargo\n\ncommenced foreclosure proceedings.\n\n      Notwithstanding the absence of actual notice, McClain and Prince had\n\nconstructive notice of the deed of consolidation. Both statutory and common\n\nlaw confirm this point.\n\n      Over one century ago, our Supreme Court held:\n\n            The general rule is that where a purchaser holds\n            under a conveyance, and is obliged to make out his\n            title through that deed, or through a series of prior\n            deeds, he is charged with constructive notice of\n            every matter connected with or affecting his title,\n            which appears by description of parties, by recital,\n            by reference, or otherwise, on the face of any deed,\n            or upon any public record, which forms an essential\n            link in the chain of instruments through which he\n            takes title or liens which affect the same.\n\nVolk v.

The trial court properly\n\nreformed the legal description to define a single consolidated parcel in\n\n\n\nnotice of the 2002 deed of consolidation.     McC\n\nargument that the 2002 deed only pertains to Lot A is devoid of merit.\n\n                                         V.\n\n\n\n\nestopped from\n\nother words, McClain and Prince assert that (1) the Powers verbally\n\npromised prior to the agreement of sale that the property had two separate\n\nlots, (2) the Powers conveyed a deed at closing with an A/B description that\n\nsomehow was replaced by a different deed that was recorded, (3) McClain\n\n\n\nthe Powers cannot renege on their promise under the doctrines of estoppel\n\nby deed78, estoppel by warranty79 and promissory estoppel80.\n\n\n78\n   See Daley v.

Since the trial court did not make an affirmative finding that it\n\ncredited this testimony, we, as an appellate court, cannot hold that this\n\ntestimony formed the basis for an estoppel claim.\n\n\n\nverdict improperly exceeds the scope of the specific relief [that they]\n\n\n\nasked for a specific form of relief in their complaint    reformation of the\n\ndeed to provide an A/B legal description      and therefore the court had no\n\npower to reform the deed in a different fashion. We disagree. When a court\n\nreforms a deed on the basis of mutual mistake, it must reform the deed to\n\nreflect the intent of the parties.   Dudash, supra.   Reforming the deed in\n\nthis manner might result in a different deed than the moving party wants,\n\nbut that is the risk that the party takes when it requests reformation. Id.\n\nAs we reasoned above, we think that the manner in which the court\n\nreformed the deed was consist\n\n\n\nis all that McClain and Prince can ask for.\n\n      In their fourth argument on appeal, McClain and Prince contend that\n\n                   compel the recording of a deed contrary to Lower Merion\n\n\n\ndecision violated an ordinance that requires registration of deeds with the\n\n\n                                       24\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\n\ntownship prior to recording. This ordinance, however, has not been in effect\n\nsince 2008. See 21 P.S. § 338.9 (2008 act that repealed statute permitting\n\ntownships to require registration of deeds prior to recording).         Thus, the\n\n\n\n        Even if the ordinance remained in effect in 2013, we know of no law\n\nthat prohibits a court sitting in equity from reforming a deed in a manner\n\nthat overrides a local ordinance. Furthermore, McClain and Prince admit that\n\n                                                             s ordinances are in\n\n\n\naggrieved by any violation of the ordinance and thus lack standing to\n\nenforce the ordinance in this action.\n\n        In their sixth argument on appeal, McClain and Prince assert that the\n\ncourt erred by denying the request in Count III of the complaint to strike the\n\n2010 deed of correction.       This issue does not warrant relief.    McClain and\n\n\n\nthe world that they acquiesced to this erroneous deed. Otherwise they will\n                                    82\n                                         These empty phrases do not establish that\n\nthey suffered tangible prejudice as a result of the 2010 deed.\n\n        In their seventh argument on appeal, McClain and Prince assert that\n\nthe 2010 deed of correction eliminates their rights to the entire parcel. This\n\nis incorrect. The 2010 deed did not strip them of ownership of the property;\n\n\n82\n     Brief for Appellants, p. 32.\n                                            25\n\fJ-A09034-14\n\nit merely consolidated the property into one parcel.     And while the 2010\n\ndeed failed to mention that they are joint tenants with right of survivorship,\n\nthe 2013 deed reinstates this language and thus cures any possible\n\nprejudice to their rights.\n\n      In their eighth argument on appeal, McClain and Prince state that the\n\n2013 deed of corre\n\n2013 deed properly reinstates McClain and Prince as joint tenants with right\n\nof survivorship and properly consolidates the property into one parcel.\n\n      Finally, in their ninth argument on appeal, McClain and Prince claim\n\nthat the Powers do not have the ability to execute deeds of correction\n\nbecause they do not hold title. Perhaps they do not have the ability on their\n\nown, but the court vested them with the authority to execute a deed of\n\ncorrection within its 2013 order.   We see no reason why the court cannot\n\n\n\nequitable power of reformation.\n\n\n\n      Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
