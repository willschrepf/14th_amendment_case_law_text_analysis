Alvarez, Justice\n                  Jason Pulliam, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: August 26, 2015\n\nAPPEAL DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION\n\n           University of the Incarnate Word (UIW) brings this interlocutory appeal from the trial\n\ncourt’s order denying its plea to the jurisdiction. In its plea to the jurisdiction, UIW asserted the\n\ntrial court is without subject matter jurisdiction because UIW is entitled to governmental\n\nimmunity. On appeal, the Redus plaintiffs (the Reduses) filed a motion to dismiss contending this\n\ncourt lacks interlocutory jurisdiction.      We dismiss UIW’s interlocutory appeal for want of\n\njurisdiction.\n\f                                                                                     04-15-00120-CV\n\n\n                                FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       It is undisputed that UIW is a private institution of higher education and operates its own\n\npolice department.      This suit arises from an incident in which a UIW police officer, Cpl.\n\nChristopher Carter, conducted a DWI traffic stop and detention of UIW student Cameron Redus.\n\nDuring the detention Officer Carter shot Redus five times, resulting in Redus’s death. The Reduses\n\nfiled suit against UIW and Officer Carter and asserted causes of action of: (1) negligence and gross\n\nnegligence based upon UIW’s failure to exercise reasonable care in the hiring, training and\n\nemployment of its police officers; (2) negligence, negligence per se, and gross negligence based\n\nupon Officer Carter’s unwarranted use of excessive force; (3) wrongful death; and (4) survival. In\n\ntheir First Amended Answer, UIW and Officer Carter asserted several affirmative defenses,\n\nincluding UIW’s assertion of governmental immunity from liability.\n\n       Although ambiguous, it appears UIW filed its plea to the jurisdiction based upon the\n\nassertion of governmental immunity from suit and liability. UIW also moved to dismiss the suit\n\nagainst Officer Carter based upon UIW’s entitlement to governmental immunity. Pertinent to this\n\ninterlocutory appeal, at the hearing on its plea to the jurisdiction, UIW asserted governmental\n\nimmunity from suit pursuant to the limitations of liability outlined in the Texas Tort Claims Act\n\n(TTCA). The trial court denied UIW’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss. UIW\n\nperfected this interlocutory appeal filed pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nSection 51.014(a)(8).\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n               THE REDUSES’ MOTION TO DISMISS FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION\n\n       Within the procedural posture of this case, UIW seeks entitlement to file this interlocutory\n\nappeal under Section 51.014(a)(8) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Section\n\n51.014(a)(8) permits a party to appeal from an interlocutory order that “grants or denies a plea to\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nthe jurisdiction by a governmental unit as that term is defined in Section 101.001.” TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(8) (West 2015). The parties agree that the only definition\n\nof “governmental unit” implicated is that appearing in Section 101.001(3)(D), which defines\n\n“governmental unit” as any “other institution, agency, or organ of government the status and\n\nauthority of which are derived from the Constitution of Texas or from laws passed by the\n\nlegislature under the constitution.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 101.001(3)(D) (West\n\nSupp. 2014).\n\n       UIW contends it is “a ‘governmental unit’ with respect to its law enforcement activities.”\n\nIn narrowing the application of the TTCA in this way, UIW attempts to parcel out its law\n\nenforcement activities and claim operation as a “governmental unit”, and thus, governmental\n\nimmunity, for this one function. UIW contends it is a governmental unit with respect to its law\n\nenforcement activities because it derives its status and authority to operate a police department\n\nfrom Texas Education Code Section 51.212.\n\n       The Reduses contend this court does not hold interlocutory jurisdiction because UIW, as\n\nan institution, must satisfy the statutory definition of “governmental unit” and may not carve out\n\nits function as a police department. The Reduses contend the statute authorizing a private\n\nuniversity to employ peace officers does not turn the university or its police department into a\n\ngovernmental unit. Because UIW is a private institution and does not derive its status and authority\n\nfrom statute, the Reduses contend it is not a governmental unit, and therefore, not entitled to bring\n\nthis interlocutory appeal pursuant to Section 51.014(a)(8).\n\n       UIW’s attempt to limit its qualification and operation as a governmental unit to its law\n\nenforcement activities, only, does not fit within the framework of the TTCA or the procedural\n\ncontext of this case. The TTCA permits interlocutory appeal from action taken on a plea to the\n\njurisdiction filed by a governmental unit. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(8).\n                                                -3-\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nThus, the party that filed the plea is the same party that must qualify as a governmental unit. In\n\nthis case, the Reduses filed suit against UIW as an institution, and UIW, as an institution, filed the\n\nplea to the jurisdiction. The Reduses did not file suit against, and UIW did not file its plea as,\n\nUIW Police Department or UIW, as it acts within the context of its police department. Because\n\nSection 51.014(a)(8) permits the filing of an interlocutory appeal only by the same entity that filed\n\na plea to the jurisdiction, and UIW filed the plea, UIW is the entity that must qualify as a\n\n“governmental unit” to be permitted this interlocutory appeal.\n\n       Pursuant to these definitions, the issue to be determined is whether UIW, a privately run\n\nuniversity, is a “governmental unit” as defined in Section 101.001(3)(D), and thus able to take an\n\ninterlocutory appeal under Section 51.014(a)(8) from the trial court’s denial of its plea to the\n\njurisdiction. To satisfy the definition of “governmental unit,” UIW must derive its status and\n\nauthority from statute or the Texas Constitution. The parties agree that UIW does not derive its\n\nstatus or authority as an institution from the Texas Constitution. Thus, this court’s examination\n\nmust focus on whether UIW’s status and authority is conferred by legislative enactment.\n\n                                        Standard of Review\n\n       An appellate court must review whether it has jurisdiction over an appeal de novo because\n\njurisdiction is a legal question. See IFS Sec. Grp., Inc. v. Am. Equity Ins. Co., 175 S.W.3d 560,\n\n562 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.); Parks v. DeWitt Cty. Elec. Coop., Inc., 112 S.W.3d 157,\n\n160 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2003, no pet.). “If the record does not affirmatively demonstrate\n\nthe appellate court’s jurisdiction, the appeal must be dismissed.” Parks, 112 S.W.3d at 160.\n\n                                          Applicable Law\n\n   1. Interlocutory Jurisdiction\n\n       In general, appellate courts have jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments, only.\n\nBally Total Fitness Corp. v. Jackson, 53 S.W.3d 352, 355 (Tex. 2001). As a narrow exception to\n                                                 -4-\n\f                                                                                        04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nthis rule, an interlocutory order of a trial court is appealable if explicitly authorized by Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code Section 51.014(a). City of Houston v. Estate of Jones, 388 S.W.3d\n\n663, 666 (Tex. 2012); see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(a). For this reason,\n\ndetermination whether Section 51.014(a) authorizes an interlocutory appeal is a jurisdictional\n\nissue. See Texas A & M Univ. Sys. v. Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d 835, 841 (Tex. 2007); Bally Total\n\nFitness Corp., 53 S.W.3d at 355.\n\n   2. Statutory Construction\n\n       Section 51.014 must be strictly construed as a narrow exception to the general rule that\n\nonly final judgments and orders are appealable. See Bally Total Fitness Corp., 53 S.W.3d at 355;\n\nSee America Online, Inc. v. Williams, 958 S.W.2d 268, 271 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n1997, no pet.). In construing a statute, a reviewing court should determine and give effect to the\n\nlegislature’s intent and should presume “the Legislature selected language in a statute with care\n\nand that every word or phrase was used with a purpose in mind.” Tex. Lottery Comm’n v. First\n\nState Bank of DeQueen, 325 S.W.3d 628, 635 (Tex. 2010). If the meaning of the statutory\n\nlanguage is unambiguous, a reviewing court adopts, with few exceptions, the interpretation\n\nsupported by the plain meaning of the provision’s words and terms. See Fitzgerald v. Advanced\n\nSpine Fixation Sys., Inc., 996 S.W.2d 864, 865-66 (Tex. 1999).\n\n   3. Determination of Interlocutory Jurisdiction Under Sections 51.014(a)(8) and\n      101.001(3)(D)\n\n       While no court has addressed the issue whether a privately run university is a\n\n“governmental unit” as defined in Sections 51.014(a)(8) and 101.001(3)(D), the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt has interpreted these same statutes to address the issue whether a privately run charter school\n\nso qualifies. See LTTS Charter Sch., Inc. v. C2 Constr., Inc., 342 S.W.3d 73, 84 (Tex. 2011).\n\nAlthough the facts in LTTS Charter School are distinguishable, because it interprets the same\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\f                                                                                       04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nstatutory provisions pertinent to the determination of this court’s jurisdiction in the case, LTTS\n\nCharter School is instructive and provides applicable guidance and authority. See e.g. Hwy 3\n\nMHP, LLC v. Electric Reliability Council of Tex., 462 S.W.3d 204, 207–10 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2015, no pet.) (analyzing and applying LTTS Charter School to issue whether electricity provider\n\nqualifies as a governmental unit).\n\n       In LTTS Charter School, C2 Construction asserted a breach-of-contract action against\n\nLTTS Charter School, Inc., a private non-profit corporation that operated an open–enrollment\n\ncharter school called Universal Academy. LTTS Charter Sch., Inc., 342 S.W.3d at 75. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court analyzed Sections 51.014(a)(8) and 101.001(3) for the issue posed in that case:\n\nwhether a privately run, open-enrollment charter school is a governmental unit, and thus able to\n\ntake an interlocutory appeal from a trial court’s denial of its plea to the jurisdiction. Id. at 74–75.\n\nThe supreme court ultimately concluded an open-enrollment charter school is a governmental unit\n\nbecause, as a charter school, it derived its status and authority from legislative enactments. Id. at\n\n75. In reaching this conclusion, the supreme court began by noting, “open-enrollment charter\n\nschools . . . are indisputably part of the Texas public-education system.” Id. at 76. Important to\n\ntheir “status” as a public school, the supreme court noted charter schools are “nontraditional public\n\nschools, created and governed by Chapter 12 of the Education Code,” they receive government\n\nfunding and comply with the state’s testing and accountability system. Id. at 74, 76. With regard\n\nto their authority to act and conduct their business, the court found to be significant the statutory\n\ngrants of authority to charter schools “of all the powers given to traditional public schools under\n\nTitle 2 of the Education Code.” Id. at 77 (citing TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 12.104(a) (West 2014)).\n\nFurthermore, the supreme court held to be important the facts that charter schools: (1) “have\n\nstatutory entitlements to state funding” and to services that public school districts receive; (2) are\n\ngenerally subject to the laws and rules pertaining to public schools; and (3) are obligated to comply\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                       04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nwith many of the requirements of educational programs that apply to traditional public schools,\n\nincluding accountability programs. Id. at 78 (citing TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. §§ 12.103(a), .104,\n\n.106(a)). Finally, the court noted that charter schools are subject “to a host of statutes that govern\n\ngovernmental entities outside the Education Code,” including statutes imposing open-meetings\n\nrequirements, public-information requirements, and record-regulation requirements. Id. at 78.\n\nWhen summarizing its reasoning, the supreme court stated it was confident that the Legislature\n\nconsiders open-enrollment charter schools to be governmental units given the enabling statute\n\ncreating their existence as part of the public school system, their authority to wield the powers\n\ngiven to public schools, to receive and spend state tax dollars, and in many ways to function as a\n\ngovernmental entity. Id.\n\n       From LTTS Charter School, this court can conclude the term “derive its status and authority\n\nfrom legislative enactment” to mean UIW must be created by or obtain its origin from legislative\n\nenactment, as well as its authority to operate as an educational institution, which includes its police\n\nfunction. Id. at 76–77. Important factors to consider in making this determination are whether\n\nUIW, as an institution: (1) is “part of the Texas public-school system”; (2) is created by and\n\ngoverned by the Education Code or other statute; (3) receives statutory entitlement to state or other\n\ngovernment funding; (4) must comply with Texas’s regulatory and accountability system and rules\n\npertaining to public schools; or (5) is granted authority of all powers given to traditional public\n\nschools. Id. In addition, of import is whether UIW is subject to statutes that govern governmental\n\nentities in general, such as those imposing open-meetings requirements, public-information\n\nrequirements, or record-regulation requirements. Id. at 78.\n\n                           Application of LTTS Charter School Factors\n\n       To begin, a primary factor in determination whether an entity is statutorily classified as a\n\npublic entity, although privately owned, is whether the entity is the functional equivalent of, or\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\notherwise part of, a public system, such as the public-school system of higher education in this\n\ncase. See id. Here, UIW admits in its First Amended Answer that it is not statutorily classified as\n\na public entity, stating, “Defendant UIW is an incorporated charitable institution created and\n\nsponsored by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, a Catholic order of nuns. . . . The UIW\n\nis a charitable institution under both Texas and Federal law.” This judicial admission establishes\n\nUIW was not created or established by Texas law, but instead originated and maintains the status\n\nof a charitable, private institution run by a Catholic order of nuns.\n\n        Of significant import, review of the Education Code reveals UIW is not statutorily\n\nclassified as part of the higher education public system. Title 3 of the Education Code, which\n\ncontains the provisions applicable to institutions of higher education, defines those public\n\ninstitutions subject to the regulations and benefits of the Education Code. Section 61.003 contains\n\nthe general definitions applicable to the majority of Title 3 and defines “institution of higher\n\neducation” as “any public technical institution, public junior college, public senior college or\n\nuniversity, medical or dental unit, public state college, or other agency of higher education as\n\ndefined in this section.” TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 61.003(8) (West Supp. 2014). UIW is not\n\nincluded in the individual definitions of any of these specified institutions, including “other agency\n\nof higher education.” Id. at §§ 61.003(2)-(7).\n\n        Section 61.003(15) specifically defines “private or independent institution of higher\n\neducation.” Id. at § 61.003(15). Thus, the Education Code designates two distinct systems of\n\nhigher education: the public system and the private system. By providing this separate and distinct\n\ndefinition of “private institutions” and portioning out private institutions from the public school\n\nsystem, the legislature provides strong indication that it does not intend for a privately held\n\nuniversity to be considered a part of the public-school system as regulated under the Education\n\nCode.\n                                                 -8-\n\f                                                                                        04-15-00120-CV\n\n\n        Next, in LTTS Charter School, the supreme court placed much significance on the factor\n\nthat an entity operates as a “governmental unit” if it is given taxpayer money and is statutorily\n\nentitled to services that an equivalent public entity receives. LTTS Charter Sch., Inc., 342 S.W.3d\n\nat 78. As applied in this case, the Education Code begins with a general provision of applicability,\n\nstating, “[t]his code applies to all educational institutions supported in whole or in part by state tax\n\nfunds unless specifically excluded by this code.” TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 1.001(a) (West 2012).\n\nThus, the Education Code, itself, reiterates the importance of this factor, since the code generally\n\napplies only to those institutions receiving state tax funds. It is not disputed that UIW does not\n\nreceive funding from the State of Texas nor is it statutorily entitled to services that public schools\n\nof higher education receive.\n\n        Next in analysis of the LTTS Charter School factors is: whether an entity “is granted\n\nauthority of all powers given to traditional public schools.” The powers and regulations applicable\n\nto institutions of higher education are provided in Title 3 of the Education Code. These powers\n\nare then outlined in Subtitle A, titled “Higher Education in General.” Subtitle A contains\n\nsubchapters which individually relegate controls and regulations, each specifically limited to an\n\n“institution of higher education” as defined in Section 61.003. As noted already, UIW is not\n\nincluded within this definition.\n\n        Within the context of this factor, it is important to note that the Education Code does\n\nprovide UIW limited power relegated to schools within the public system. Specifically, Subtitle\n\nA contains Chapter 53A titled, “Higher Education Facility Authorities for Private Schools”. TEX.\n\nEDUC. CODE ANN. § 53A.01 (West 2012). Diminutive of this authorization, though, this chapter\n\nrelegates only limited authority for a private institution to act in a specific circumstance. It is not\n\nthe enabling statute as anticipated by, and that existed in, LTTS Charter School. See LTTS Charter\n\nSch., Inc., 342 S.W.3d at 76–78. In addition, Chapter 53, titled “Higher Education Facility\n                                                  -9-\n\f                                                                                        04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nAuthorities for Public Schools,” again separates the powers and authorities granted to public higher\n\neducation institutions from those given to private higher education institutions. Therefore, by\n\nspecific definition and limitation within the Education Code, UIW is not granted the authority of\n\nall powers relegated to “traditional public schools,” but instead is provided only limited\n\nauthorization to perform a specific function in a specific circumstance.\n\n        Further, Education Code Section 51.212, titled “Peace Officers at Private Institutions,”\n\nfrom which UIW contends it derives its authority “to create and operate a law enforcement agency\n\nor police department,” authorizes the governing board of a private institution to “employ and\n\ncommission peace officers.” Section 51.212 falls under Subchapter E, designated to regulate the\n\n“Protection of Buildings and Grounds” and authorizing employment of peace officers for the\n\nlimited purposed of enforcing state law on the institution’s campus. TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 51.212(a)(1) (West 2012). So, while Section 51.212 does allow UIW’s governing board to\n\nemploy peace officers, it is not an enabling statute for the institution of UIW to operate as the\n\nequivalent of a public university, to segregate its police department as a separate and distinct entity,\n\nor to fall within the realm of the public-school system, as anticipated in LTTS Charter School.\n\nRather, Section 51.212 provides authority to UIW’s governing body to operate a specific and\n\nlimited function also given to universities within the public school system. Again, in this limited\n\ncircumstance, a school falling within the public school system has a different enabling statute for\n\nemploying a peace officer. Compare TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 51.203 (public) to § 51.212\n\n(private).\n\n        Because this limited power is also relegated to a public institution, this factor provides\n\nsome weight in favor of UIW with regard to consideration of the relevant factors. However, this\n\nlimited delegation of authority does not qualify UIW as a governmental unit. Further, the supreme\n\ncourt in LTTS Charter School determined to be important the fact that an entity be “granted\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                       04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nauthority of all powers given to traditional public schools. . . .” LTTS Charter Sch., Inc., 342\n\nS.W.3d at 77. UIW is not granted such authority. Of notable importance in analyzing and\n\nweighing this factor is the requirement that, to be entitled to the statutory authority granted by\n\nSection 51.212, an entity must first satisfy the definition of a “private or independent institution of\n\nhigher education.” TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 51.212(a). Thus, the statute from which UIW claims\n\nto derive its status and authority as a governmental unit requires that it be a private or independent\n\ninstitution. This distinction provides indication the legislature intended only to provide an\n\ninstitution outside the public-school system limited authority and to maintain the private school’s\n\nstatus as separate and distinct.\n\n       Finally, with regard to the final factor, it does appear that UIW will be subject to a statute\n\nthat governs governmental entities in general with regard to exposure of public information. In\n\nparticular, UIW urges this court to consider recently passed Senate Bill 308, which applies only to\n\n“a campus police department of a private university” and which becomes effective on September\n\n1, 2015. Once enacted, Senate Bill 308, will make a private-university police department a “law\n\nenforcement agency and a governmental body” for purposes of complying with Texas Government\n\nCode Chapter 552, commonly known as the Texas Public Information Act. See TEX. GOV’T CODE\n\nANN. § 552. The provision states, “[a] campus police department of a private university of higher\n\neducation is a law enforcement agency and a governmental body for purposes of Chapter 552,\n\ngovernment Code, only with respect to information relating solely to law enforcement activities.”\n\nSenate Bill 308, Act of March 31, 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., ch. 300, § 1, 2015 Tex. Sess. Law Serv.\n\n(codified as TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 51.212(f)).\n\n       While the newly enacted Senate Bill 308 does designate UIW’s police department as a\n\n“governmental body,” this designation is limited to the police department and to the purpose of\n\ncompliance with a portion of the Public Information Act. The provision will be enacted in\n                                                 - 11 -\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nEducation Code Section 51.212, which has already been discussed and which this court has already\n\nconcluded does not equate a private university, as a whole, to a governmental unit. In fact, the\n\nprovision’s specific limitation of its designation of a campus police department to this specific\n\nrequirement under the Public Information Act reveals the legislature’s intent to prevent any\n\nextension of this designation. Finally, the newly-enacted statute does not apply to this case nor\n\nweigh in UIW’s favor, as it is not yet in effect. See id.\n\n       As a final point, in making its argument for entitlement to designation as a governmental\n\nunit limited to its police function, UIW relies upon the Texas Supreme Court’s recent opinion,\n\nRice Univ. v. Refaey, 459 S.W.3d 590 (Tex. 2015). The primary issue in Rice University v. Refaey\n\nis “whether a private university peace officer is an ‘officer or employee of the state’ that may\n\ninvoke a court of appeals’ interlocutory jurisdiction under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nsection 51.014(a)(5).” Rice Univ. v. Refaey, 459 S.W.3d at 591. As in this case, the Rice\n\nUniversity v. Refaey opinion interpreted the statute implicated to confer interlocutory appellate\n\njurisdiction. See id.\n\n       While informative, Rice University v. Refaey is distinguishable based upon the statute\n\nutilized to confer interlocutory jurisdiction, and therefore, its holding is difficult to apply to the\n\njurisdictional issue before this court. Under similar facts, Plaintiff Refaey sued Rice University, a\n\nprivate university, and its police officer, Gary Spears, based upon incidents leading to and resulting\n\nfrom a traffic stop and Refaey’s arrest. Id. Rice University and Officer Spears moved for summary\n\njudgment asserting Officer Spears’ official immunity from suit. When the trial court denied\n\nsummary judgment, Rice University and Officer Spears sought interlocutory appeal pursuant to\n\nSection 51.014(a)(5), which grants authority to appeal an interlocutory order that “denies a motion\n\nfor summary judgment that is based on an assertion of immunity by an individual who is an officer\n\nor employee of the state. . . .” Id. The supreme court concluded an officer of a private university\n                                                - 12 -\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nis an “officer of the state” as that term is used in Section 51.015(a)(5) to confer interlocutory\n\njurisdiction. Id.\n\n       We recognize UIW attempts to apply Rice University v. Refeay as an indication of the\n\nTexas Supreme Court’s and the legislature’s intent to cast a broad net over entities that satisfy the\n\ndefinition of “governmental unit”. However, the supreme court interpreted Section 51.014(a)(5),\n\na different provision than what is at issue in this case. The supreme court did not interpret the term\n\n“governmental unit” or determine whether a private university qualifies as such. For this reason,\n\nthe supreme court’s analysis and conclusion in Rice University v. Refeay are not applicable to the\n\nprincipal jurisdictional issue to be determined in this case.\n\n       Following the application and weight of the factors outlined in LTTS Charter School and\n\nafter consideration of the Texas Supreme Court framework to determine legislative intent in\n\nconstruction of Section 51.014(a)(8), we conclude UIW does not satisfy the definition of\n\n“governmental unit” as that phrase is defined in Section 101.001(3)(D). Specifically, UIW is not\n\n“part of the Texas public-school system”; receives no statutory entitlement to state or other\n\ngovernment funding; is not compelled to comply with Texas’s regulatory and accountability\n\nsystem and rules pertaining to public schools, and; is not granted authority of all powers given to\n\ntraditional public schools. While UIW is granted limited power to employ peace officers, also\n\ngiven to public institutions, and this weighs in its favor, this power is separate and distinct from\n\nthat granted to a public institution and when weighed in consideration of the other factors, is not\n\nsufficient to pull UIW under the statutory definition of “governmental unit.”\n\n       As a final matter, although UIW appeals the trial court’s denial of its motion to dismiss, a\n\nparty may only pursue an interlocutory appeal from action on a plea to the jurisdiction under\n\nSection 51.014(a)(8). TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(8). Therefore, to the extent\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                    04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nUIW asserts appeal from the trial court’s denial of its motion to dismiss, this appeal is dismissed\n\nfor want of jurisdiction.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        In light of the guidance provided in LTTS Charter School and after application of the\n\nfactors noted as important indicia of entities qualifying as a governmental unit, we conclude UIW\n\nis not a governmental unit to be entitled to bring this interlocutory appeal under Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code § 51.014(a)(8). For this reason, the trial court’s denial of UIW’s plea\n\nto the jurisdiction is not an appealable interlocutory order.     Accordingly, UIW’s appeal is\n\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction. UIW’s appeal from the trial court’s denial of its motion to\n\ndismiss is not an appealable interlocutory order, and accordingly is dismissed for want of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n                                                  Jason Pulliam, Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f",

In its plea to the jurisdiction, UIW asserted the\n\ntrial court is without subject matter jurisdiction because UIW is entitled to governmental\n\nimmunity. On appeal, the Redus plaintiffs (the Reduses) filed a motion to dismiss contending this\n\ncourt lacks interlocutory jurisdiction.      We dismiss UIW’s interlocutory appeal for want of\n\njurisdiction.\n\f                                                                                     04-15-00120-CV\n\n\n                                FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       It is undisputed that UIW is a private institution of higher education and operates its own\n\npolice department.      This suit arises from an incident in which a UIW police officer, Cpl.\n\nChristopher Carter, conducted a DWI traffic stop and detention of UIW student Cameron Redus.\n\nDuring the detention Officer Carter shot Redus five times, resulting in Redus’s death. The Reduses\n\nfiled suit against UIW and Officer Carter and asserted causes of action of: (1) negligence and gross\n\nnegligence based upon UIW’s failure to exercise reasonable care in the hiring, training and\n\nemployment of its police officers; (2) negligence, negligence per se, and gross negligence based\n\nupon Officer Carter’s unwarranted use of excessive force; (3) wrongful death; and (4) survival. In\n\ntheir First Amended Answer, UIW and Officer Carter asserted several affirmative defenses,\n\nincluding UIW’s assertion of governmental immunity from liability.\n\n       Although ambiguous, it appears UIW filed its plea to the jurisdiction based upon the\n\nassertion of governmental immunity from suit and liability. UIW also moved to dismiss the suit\n\nagainst Officer Carter based upon UIW’s entitlement to governmental immunity. Pertinent to this\n\ninterlocutory appeal, at the hearing on its plea to the jurisdiction, UIW asserted governmental\n\nimmunity from suit pursuant to the limitations of liability outlined in the Texas Tort Claims Act\n\n(TTCA). The trial court denied UIW’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion to dismiss. UIW\n\nperfected this interlocutory appeal filed pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nSection 51.014(a)(8).\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n               THE REDUSES’ MOTION TO DISMISS FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION\n\n       Within the procedural posture of this case, UIW seeks entitlement to file this interlocutory\n\nappeal under Section 51.014(a)(8) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Section\n\n51.014(a)(8) permits a party to appeal from an interlocutory order that “grants or denies a plea to\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nthe jurisdiction by a governmental unit as that term is defined in Section 101.001.” TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(8) (West 2015). The parties agree that the only definition\n\nof “governmental unit” implicated is that appearing in Section 101.001(3)(D), which defines\n\n“governmental unit” as any “other institution, agency, or organ of government the status and\n\nauthority of which are derived from the Constitution of Texas or from laws passed by the\n\nlegislature under the constitution.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 101.001(3)(D) (West\n\nSupp. 2014).\n\n       UIW contends it is “a ‘governmental unit’ with respect to its law enforcement activities.”\n\nIn narrowing the application of the TTCA in this way, UIW attempts to parcel out its law\n\nenforcement activities and claim operation as a “governmental unit”, and thus, governmental\n\nimmunity, for this one function. UIW contends it is a governmental unit with respect to its law\n\nenforcement activities because it derives its status and authority to operate a police department\n\nfrom Texas Education Code Section 51.212.\n\n       The Reduses contend this court does not hold interlocutory jurisdiction because UIW, as\n\nan institution, must satisfy the statutory definition of “governmental unit” and may not carve out\n\nits function as a police department. The Reduses contend the statute authorizing a private\n\nuniversity to employ peace officers does not turn the university or its police department into a\n\ngovernmental unit. Because UIW is a private institution and does not derive its status and authority\n\nfrom statute, the Reduses contend it is not a governmental unit, and therefore, not entitled to bring\n\nthis interlocutory appeal pursuant to Section 51.014(a)(8).\n\n       UIW’s attempt to limit its qualification and operation as a governmental unit to its law\n\nenforcement activities, only, does not fit within the framework of the TTCA or the procedural\n\ncontext of this case. The TTCA permits interlocutory appeal from action taken on a plea to the\n\njurisdiction filed by a governmental unit. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(8).\n                                                -3-\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nThus, the party that filed the plea is the same party that must qualify as a governmental unit. In\n\nthis case, the Reduses filed suit against UIW as an institution, and UIW, as an institution, filed the\n\nplea to the jurisdiction. The Reduses did not file suit against, and UIW did not file its plea as,\n\nUIW Police Department or UIW, as it acts within the context of its police department. Because\n\nSection 51.014(a)(8) permits the filing of an interlocutory appeal only by the same entity that filed\n\na plea to the jurisdiction, and UIW filed the plea, UIW is the entity that must qualify as a\n\n“governmental unit” to be permitted this interlocutory appeal.\n\n       Pursuant to these definitions, the issue to be determined is whether UIW, a privately run\n\nuniversity, is a “governmental unit” as defined in Section 101.001(3)(D), and thus able to take an\n\ninterlocutory appeal under Section 51.014(a)(8) from the trial court’s denial of its plea to the\n\njurisdiction. To satisfy the definition of “governmental unit,” UIW must derive its status and\n\nauthority from statute or the Texas Constitution. The parties agree that UIW does not derive its\n\nstatus or authority as an institution from the Texas Constitution. Thus, this court’s examination\n\nmust focus on whether UIW’s status and authority is conferred by legislative enactment.\n\n                                        Standard of Review\n\n       An appellate court must review whether it has jurisdiction over an appeal de novo because\n\njurisdiction is a legal question.

App.—Austin\n\n2015, no pet.) (analyzing and applying LTTS Charter School to issue whether electricity provider\n\nqualifies as a governmental unit).\n\n       In LTTS Charter School, C2 Construction asserted a breach-of-contract action against\n\nLTTS Charter School, Inc., a private non-profit corporation that operated an open–enrollment\n\ncharter school called Universal Academy. LTTS Charter Sch., Inc., 342 S.W.3d at 75. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court analyzed Sections 51.014(a)(8) and 101.001(3) for the issue posed in that case:\n\nwhether a privately run, open-enrollment charter school is a governmental unit, and thus able to\n\ntake an interlocutory appeal from a trial court’s denial of its plea to the jurisdiction. Id. at 74–75.\n\nThe supreme court ultimately concluded an open-enrollment charter school is a governmental unit\n\nbecause, as a charter school, it derived its status and authority from legislative enactments. Id. at\n\n75. In reaching this conclusion, the supreme court began by noting, “open-enrollment charter\n\nschools . . . are indisputably part of the Texas public-education system.” Id. at 76. Important to\n\ntheir “status” as a public school, the supreme court noted charter schools are “nontraditional public\n\nschools, created and governed by Chapter 12 of the Education Code,” they receive government\n\nfunding and comply with the state’s testing and accountability system. Id. at 74, 76. With regard\n\nto their authority to act and conduct their business, the court found to be significant the statutory\n\ngrants of authority to charter schools “of all the powers given to traditional public schools under\n\nTitle 2 of the Education Code.” Id. at 77 (citing TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 12.104(a) (West 2014)).\n\nFurthermore, the supreme court held to be important the facts that charter schools: (1) “have\n\nstatutory entitlements to state funding” and to services that public school districts receive; (2) are\n\ngenerally subject to the laws and rules pertaining to public schools; and (3) are obligated to comply\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                       04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nwith many of the requirements of educational programs that apply to traditional public schools,\n\nincluding accountability programs. Id. at 78 (citing TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. §§ 12.103(a), .104,\n\n.106(a)). Finally, the court noted that charter schools are subject “to a host of statutes that govern\n\ngovernmental entities outside the Education Code,” including statutes imposing open-meetings\n\nrequirements, public-information requirements, and record-regulation requirements. Id. at 78.\n\nWhen summarizing its reasoning, the supreme court stated it was confident that the Legislature\n\nconsiders open-enrollment charter schools to be governmental units given the enabling statute\n\ncreating their existence as part of the public school system, their authority to wield the powers\n\ngiven to public schools, to receive and spend state tax dollars, and in many ways to function as a\n\ngovernmental entity. Id.\n\n       From LTTS Charter School, this court can conclude the term “derive its status and authority\n\nfrom legislative enactment” to mean UIW must be created by or obtain its origin from legislative\n\nenactment, as well as its authority to operate as an educational institution, which includes its police\n\nfunction. Id. at 76–77. Important factors to consider in making this determination are whether\n\nUIW, as an institution: (1) is “part of the Texas public-school system”; (2) is created by and\n\ngoverned by the Education Code or other statute; (3) receives statutory entitlement to state or other\n\ngovernment funding; (4) must comply with Texas’s regulatory and accountability system and rules\n\npertaining to public schools; or (5) is granted authority of all powers given to traditional public\n\nschools. Id. In addition, of import is whether UIW is subject to statutes that govern governmental\n\nentities in general, such as those imposing open-meetings requirements, public-information\n\nrequirements, or record-regulation requirements. Id. at 78.\n\n                           Application of LTTS Charter School Factors\n\n       To begin, a primary factor in determination whether an entity is statutorily classified as a\n\npublic entity, although privately owned, is whether the entity is the functional equivalent of, or\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\notherwise part of, a public system, such as the public-school system of higher education in this\n\ncase. See id. Here, UIW admits in its First Amended Answer that it is not statutorily classified as\n\na public entity, stating, “Defendant UIW is an incorporated charitable institution created and\n\nsponsored by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, a Catholic order of nuns. . . . The UIW\n\nis a charitable institution under both Texas and Federal law.” This judicial admission establishes\n\nUIW was not created or established by Texas law, but instead originated and maintains the status\n\nof a charitable, private institution run by a Catholic order of nuns.\n\n        Of significant import, review of the Education Code reveals UIW is not statutorily\n\nclassified as part of the higher education public system. Title 3 of the Education Code, which\n\ncontains the provisions applicable to institutions of higher education, defines those public\n\ninstitutions subject to the regulations and benefits of the Education Code. Section 61.003 contains\n\nthe general definitions applicable to the majority of Title 3 and defines “institution of higher\n\neducation” as “any public technical institution, public junior college, public senior college or\n\nuniversity, medical or dental unit, public state college, or other agency of higher education as\n\ndefined in this section.” TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 61.003(8) (West Supp. 2014). UIW is not\n\nincluded in the individual definitions of any of these specified institutions, including “other agency\n\nof higher education.” Id. at §§ 61.003(2)-(7).\n\n        Section 61.003(15) specifically defines “private or independent institution of higher\n\neducation.” Id. at § 61.003(15). Thus, the Education Code designates two distinct systems of\n\nhigher education: the public system and the private system. By providing this separate and distinct\n\ndefinition of “private institutions” and portioning out private institutions from the public school\n\nsystem, the legislature provides strong indication that it does not intend for a privately held\n\nuniversity to be considered a part of the public-school system as regulated under the Education\n\nCode.\n                                                 -8-\n\f                                                                                        04-15-00120-CV\n\n\n        Next, in LTTS Charter School, the supreme court placed much significance on the factor\n\nthat an entity operates as a “governmental unit” if it is given taxpayer money and is statutorily\n\nentitled to services that an equivalent public entity receives. LTTS Charter Sch., Inc., 342 S.W.3d\n\nat 78. As applied in this case, the Education Code begins with a general provision of applicability,\n\nstating, “[t]his code applies to all educational institutions supported in whole or in part by state tax\n\nfunds unless specifically excluded by this code.” TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 1.001(a) (West 2012).\n\nThus, the Education Code, itself, reiterates the importance of this factor, since the code generally\n\napplies only to those institutions receiving state tax funds. It is not disputed that UIW does not\n\nreceive funding from the State of Texas nor is it statutorily entitled to services that public schools\n\nof higher education receive.\n\n        Next in analysis of the LTTS Charter School factors is: whether an entity “is granted\n\nauthority of all powers given to traditional public schools.” The powers and regulations applicable\n\nto institutions of higher education are provided in Title 3 of the Education Code. These powers\n\nare then outlined in Subtitle A, titled “Higher Education in General.” Subtitle A contains\n\nsubchapters which individually relegate controls and regulations, each specifically limited to an\n\n“institution of higher education” as defined in Section 61.003. As noted already, UIW is not\n\nincluded within this definition.\n\n        Within the context of this factor, it is important to note that the Education Code does\n\nprovide UIW limited power relegated to schools within the public system. Specifically, Subtitle\n\nA contains Chapter 53A titled, “Higher Education Facility Authorities for Private Schools”. TEX.\n\nEDUC. CODE ANN. § 53A.01 (West 2012). Diminutive of this authorization, though, this chapter\n\nrelegates only limited authority for a private institution to act in a specific circumstance. It is not\n\nthe enabling statute as anticipated by, and that existed in, LTTS Charter School. See LTTS Charter\n\nSch., Inc., 342 S.W.3d at 76–78. In addition, Chapter 53, titled “Higher Education Facility\n                                                  -9-\n\f                                                                                        04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nAuthorities for Public Schools,” again separates the powers and authorities granted to public higher\n\neducation institutions from those given to private higher education institutions. Therefore, by\n\nspecific definition and limitation within the Education Code, UIW is not granted the authority of\n\nall powers relegated to “traditional public schools,” but instead is provided only limited\n\nauthorization to perform a specific function in a specific circumstance.\n\n        Further, Education Code Section 51.212, titled “Peace Officers at Private Institutions,”\n\nfrom which UIW contends it derives its authority “to create and operate a law enforcement agency\n\nor police department,” authorizes the governing board of a private institution to “employ and\n\ncommission peace officers.” Section 51.212 falls under Subchapter E, designated to regulate the\n\n“Protection of Buildings and Grounds” and authorizing employment of peace officers for the\n\nlimited purposed of enforcing state law on the institution’s campus. TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 51.212(a)(1) (West 2012). So, while Section 51.212 does allow UIW’s governing board to\n\nemploy peace officers, it is not an enabling statute for the institution of UIW to operate as the\n\nequivalent of a public university, to segregate its police department as a separate and distinct entity,\n\nor to fall within the realm of the public-school system, as anticipated in LTTS Charter School.\n\nRather, Section 51.212 provides authority to UIW’s governing body to operate a specific and\n\nlimited function also given to universities within the public school system. Again, in this limited\n\ncircumstance, a school falling within the public school system has a different enabling statute for\n\nemploying a peace officer. Compare TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 51.203 (public) to § 51.212\n\n(private).\n\n        Because this limited power is also relegated to a public institution, this factor provides\n\nsome weight in favor of UIW with regard to consideration of the relevant factors. However, this\n\nlimited delegation of authority does not qualify UIW as a governmental unit. Further, the supreme\n\ncourt in LTTS Charter School determined to be important the fact that an entity be “granted\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                       04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nauthority of all powers given to traditional public schools. . . .” LTTS Charter Sch., Inc., 342\n\nS.W.3d at 77. UIW is not granted such authority. Of notable importance in analyzing and\n\nweighing this factor is the requirement that, to be entitled to the statutory authority granted by\n\nSection 51.212, an entity must first satisfy the definition of a “private or independent institution of\n\nhigher education.” TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 51.212(a). Thus, the statute from which UIW claims\n\nto derive its status and authority as a governmental unit requires that it be a private or independent\n\ninstitution. This distinction provides indication the legislature intended only to provide an\n\ninstitution outside the public-school system limited authority and to maintain the private school’s\n\nstatus as separate and distinct.\n\n       Finally, with regard to the final factor, it does appear that UIW will be subject to a statute\n\nthat governs governmental entities in general with regard to exposure of public information. In\n\nparticular, UIW urges this court to consider recently passed Senate Bill 308, which applies only to\n\n“a campus police department of a private university” and which becomes effective on September\n\n1, 2015. Once enacted, Senate Bill 308, will make a private-university police department a “law\n\nenforcement agency and a governmental body” for purposes of complying with Texas Government\n\nCode Chapter 552, commonly known as the Texas Public Information Act. See TEX. GOV’T CODE\n\nANN. § 552. The provision states, “[a] campus police department of a private university of higher\n\neducation is a law enforcement agency and a governmental body for purposes of Chapter 552,\n\ngovernment Code, only with respect to information relating solely to law enforcement activities.”\n\nSenate Bill 308, Act of March 31, 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., ch. 300, § 1, 2015 Tex. Sess. Law Serv.\n\n(codified as TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 51.212(f)).\n\n       While the newly enacted Senate Bill 308 does designate UIW’s police department as a\n\n“governmental body,” this designation is limited to the police department and to the purpose of\n\ncompliance with a portion of the Public Information Act. The provision will be enacted in\n                                                 - 11 -\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nEducation Code Section 51.212, which has already been discussed and which this court has already\n\nconcluded does not equate a private university, as a whole, to a governmental unit. In fact, the\n\nprovision’s specific limitation of its designation of a campus police department to this specific\n\nrequirement under the Public Information Act reveals the legislature’s intent to prevent any\n\nextension of this designation. Finally, the newly-enacted statute does not apply to this case nor\n\nweigh in UIW’s favor, as it is not yet in effect. See id.\n\n       As a final point, in making its argument for entitlement to designation as a governmental\n\nunit limited to its police function, UIW relies upon the Texas Supreme Court’s recent opinion,\n\nRice Univ. v. Refaey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2015). The primary issue in Rice University v. Refaey\n\nis “whether a private university peace officer is an ‘officer or employee of the state’ that may\n\ninvoke a court of appeals’ interlocutory jurisdiction under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nsection 51.014(a)(5).” Rice Univ. v. Refaey, 459 S.W.3d at 591. As in this case, the Rice\n\nUniversity v. Refaey opinion interpreted the statute implicated to confer interlocutory appellate\n\njurisdiction. See id.\n\n       While informative, Rice University v. Refaey is distinguishable based upon the statute\n\nutilized to confer interlocutory jurisdiction, and therefore, its holding is difficult to apply to the\n\njurisdictional issue before this court. Under similar facts, Plaintiff Refaey sued Rice University, a\n\nprivate university, and its police officer, Gary Spears, based upon incidents leading to and resulting\n\nfrom a traffic stop and Refaey’s arrest. Id. Rice University and Officer Spears moved for summary\n\njudgment asserting Officer Spears’ official immunity from suit. When the trial court denied\n\nsummary judgment, Rice University and Officer Spears sought interlocutory appeal pursuant to\n\nSection 51.014(a)(5), which grants authority to appeal an interlocutory order that “denies a motion\n\nfor summary judgment that is based on an assertion of immunity by an individual who is an officer\n\nor employee of the state. . . .” Id. The supreme court concluded an officer of a private university\n                                                - 12 -\n\f                                                                                      04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nis an “officer of the state” as that term is used in Section 51.015(a)(5) to confer interlocutory\n\njurisdiction. Id.\n\n       We recognize UIW attempts to apply Rice University v. Refeay as an indication of the\n\nTexas Supreme Court’s and the legislature’s intent to cast a broad net over entities that satisfy the\n\ndefinition of “governmental unit”. However, the supreme court interpreted Section 51.014(a)(5),\n\na different provision than what is at issue in this case. The supreme court did not interpret the term\n\n“governmental unit” or determine whether a private university qualifies as such. For this reason,\n\nthe supreme court’s analysis and conclusion in Rice University v. Refeay are not applicable to the\n\nprincipal jurisdictional issue to be determined in this case.\n\n       Following the application and weight of the factors outlined in LTTS Charter School and\n\nafter consideration of the Texas Supreme Court framework to determine legislative intent in\n\nconstruction of Section 51.014(a)(8), we conclude UIW does not satisfy the definition of\n\n“governmental unit” as that phrase is defined in Section 101.001(3)(D). Specifically, UIW is not\n\n“part of the Texas public-school system”; receives no statutory entitlement to state or other\n\ngovernment funding; is not compelled to comply with Texas’s regulatory and accountability\n\nsystem and rules pertaining to public schools, and; is not granted authority of all powers given to\n\ntraditional public schools. While UIW is granted limited power to employ peace officers, also\n\ngiven to public institutions, and this weighs in its favor, this power is separate and distinct from\n\nthat granted to a public institution and when weighed in consideration of the other factors, is not\n\nsufficient to pull UIW under the statutory definition of “governmental unit.”\n\n       As a final matter, although UIW appeals the trial court’s denial of its motion to dismiss, a\n\nparty may only pursue an interlocutory appeal from action on a plea to the jurisdiction under\n\nSection 51.014(a)(8). TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(8). Therefore, to the extent\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                    04-15-00120-CV\n\n\nUIW asserts appeal from the trial court’s denial of its motion to dismiss, this appeal is dismissed\n\nfor want of jurisdiction.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        In light of the guidance provided in LTTS Charter School and after application of the\n\nfactors noted as important indicia of entities qualifying as a governmental unit, we conclude UIW\n\nis not a governmental unit to be entitled to bring this interlocutory appeal under Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code § 51.014(a)(8). For this reason, the trial court’s denial of UIW’s plea\n\nto the jurisdiction is not an appealable interlocutory order.     Accordingly, UIW’s appeal is\n\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction. UIW’s appeal from the trial court’s denial of its motion to\n\ndismiss is not an appealable interlocutory order, and accordingly is dismissed for want of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n                                                  Jason Pulliam, Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f</pre>",
