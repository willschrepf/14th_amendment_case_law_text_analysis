Persons charged with\nsex offenses in Illinois may be diverted before trial to civil\nconfinement, if a mental illness of a least one year’s dura-\ntion led to the criminal conduct. Those who complete\ntreatment successfully are released and the criminal\ncharges dismissed. The Illinois Sexually Dangerous Per-\nsons Act, 725 ILCS 205/1.01 to 12, is described, and sus-\ntained against one constitutional challenge, in Allen v.\nIllinois, 478 U.S. 364 (1986). In this suit under 42 U.S.C.\n§1983, twenty-seven persons committed under the Act\ncontend that it is being implemented unconstitutionally\n\f2                                               No. 03-1570\n\nin at least three ways: first, they are confined in one wing\nof an institution that also serves as a prison; second, their\ntreatment includes self-accusatory features; third, it is\nconducted on a group rather than an individual basis.\nPlaintiffs seek both damages and injunctive relief. After\ndiscovery was completed, the district judge resolved some\nclaims in favor of some defendants on summary judg-\nment. But he rejected three defendants’ argument that\nqualified immunity protects them from damages liability.\nThese three have filed an interlocutory appeal. See Behrens\nv. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299 (1996); Scott v. Lacy, 811 F.2d\n1153 (7th Cir. 1987). The initial step in evaluating any\nimmunity defense is determining whether the complaint\nstates a claim, see Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201\n(2001), so we discuss the merits along with the question\nwhether the legal principles on which plaintiffs rely were\nso clearly established that persons in defendants’ posi-\ntion had to understand that what they were doing vio-\nlated the Constitution.\n  All of the plaintiffs are confined at Big Muddy River\nCorrectional Center. The three appellants are Donald\nSnyder, former Director of the Department of Corrections;\nMichael Holmes, the Warden of Big Muddy; and Mark\nCarich, its Public Service Administrator and the principal\ndesigner of the programs to which plaintiffs object. Snyder\nassigned plaintiffs to Big Muddy, where they mingle\nwith convicts at meals and on some other occasions. Some\ndetainees are housed two to a cell (though never with a\nconvicted inmate). According to plaintiffs, these arrange-\nments violate the Constitution because civil detainees\nare entitled to housing at facilities separate from convicts,\nand in the “least restrictive” environment. Plaintiffs’ prin-\ncipal problem is the lack of any federal authority for these\npropositions. They contend, to quote their brief:\n    Plaintiffs have not claimed that it is unconstitu-\n    tional, per se, for them to be confined to a facility\n\fNo. 03-1570                                                   3\n\n    that is labeled a “prison” and that also houses\n    criminally convicted inmates. Their claim is a more\n    general one that the Constitution requires them\n    to be placed “in the least restrictive environment\n    consistent with the purposes of the [Sexually Dan-\n    gerous Persons Act]” and that they be provided\n    “housing, recreation, education and treatment in\n    facilities segregated from the general prison popula-\n    tion as required by the SDPA.”\nThe argument, in other words, is that the Constitution\nrequires Illinois to fulfill promises that the plaintiffs locate\nin a state statute. Yet the Constitution does not com-\npel states to follow their own laws. See DeShaney v.\nWinnebago County Department of Social Services, 489\nU.S. 189, 202 (1989); Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 11\n(1944); Archie v. Racine, 847 F.2d 1211, 1215-18 (7th Cir.\n1988) (en banc). Nor does it permit a federal court to en-\nforce state laws directly. See Pennhurst State School &\nHospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106 (1984). Plaintiffs\nneed a genuinely federal rule, such as the principle articu-\nlated in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321-22 (1982),\nthat “[p]ersons who have been involuntarily committed\nare entitled to more considerate treatment and conditions\nof confinement than criminals whose conditions of confine-\nment are designed to punish.” Although the Court rejected\nin Youngberg an argument that the state must estab-\nlish the “necessity” of keeping detainees in close custody,\nit held that they are entitled to “the exercise of profes-\nsional judgment as to the needs of residents” (id. at 322).\nSeling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 265 (2001), generalizes the\nproposition this way: “due process requires that the con-\nditions and duration of confinement . . . bear some reason-\nable relation to the purpose for which persons are com-\nmitted.”\n  Thus detainees may be subjected to conditions that\nadvance goals such as preventing escape and assuring the\n\f4                                              No. 03-1570\n\nsafety of others, even though they may not be punished. See\nAllen, 478 U.S. at 373-74. Does placement in a prison,\nsubject to the institution’s usual rules of conduct, signify\npunishment? The answer, given by Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520 (1979), is no. Wolfish held that pretrial de-\ntainees, who like civil committees may be held for security\nreasons but not punished, may be assigned to prisons and\ncovered by the usual institutional rules, which are designed\nto assure safety and security. Our plaintiffs were not as-\nsigned to high-security institutions, solitary, lockdown, or\notherwise onerous confinement. And one must keep in\nmind that they are pretrial detainees as well as civil\ncommittees: criminal charges against them are pending.\nIf pretrial detainees may be subjected to the ordinary\nconditions of confinement, as Wolfish holds, then so may\npersons detained before trial as sexually dangerous persons.\n   Plaintiffs do not assert that their situation is worse in\nany material way than the situation in which ordinary\npretrial detainees find themselves. They do not contend, for\nexample, that accused sex offenders suffer injury at the\nhands of convicted prisoners at Big Muddy more often than\nat each others’ hands, something that if true might be\nthought to imply that they have been mixed with convicts\nbecause of (rather than in spite of) the special risks of\nviolence in prison. Details such as double celling add\nnothing to plaintiffs’ contentions. Wolfish rejected an\nargument that this practice equates to punishment. 441\nU.S. at 530-43. College dorms, hospitals, and military\nbarracks house people more than one to a room without\namounting to punishment. Just so at Big Muddy. Plain-\ntiffs initial challenge to their confinement therefore fails\non the merits, making it unnecessary to consider immunity.\n  Youngberg, Allen, and Seling all show that detainees\nare entitled to some kind of treatment—but plaintiffs\ndon’t like the kind on offer. Illinois has concluded that\nthe best treatment for sex offenders is group therapy in\n\fNo. 03-1570                                                5\n\nwhich people admit their crimes (to others as well as to\nthemselves), own up to and confront the urges that drive\nthem to perpetrate heinous acts, and then assist each\nother in overcoming those urges. Illinois administers\npolygraph examinations to check whether participants\nin this program are being candid. Its approach is similar\nto the one described, and sustained against constitutional\nchallenge, in McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24 (2002). The\nprincipal ground of attack in McKune was that the state\ndid not supply use immunity for information obtained in\nits self-accusatory program. The Court replied, in part,\nthat immunity was unnecessary because participation in\nthe program was voluntary; completion of the program\nentitled the offender to early release. Our plaintiffs say\nthat, because they have not been convicted, they also can’t\nearn early release and that their participation is accord-\ningly involuntary. True enough, the plaintiffs in McKune\nhad been convicted while our plaintiffs have not been,\nbut each group enjoys an opportunity to get out earlier.\nPlaintiffs are free to turn down the treatment Illinois\noffers. This may make it harder to show that their prob-\nlems are behind them, that release is in order, and that\nthe criminal charges should be dismissed, but this does\nnot make the choice any less willing or intelligent. An\naccused who turns down a plea bargain (or declines to\nassist the prosecutors) may end up with a longer sen-\ntence, but this does not vitiate the choice to confess. See\nUnited States v. Klotz, 943 F.2d 707, 710-11 (7th Cir. 1991).\n  Illinois contends, as Kansas did in McKune, that no\nparticipant in the treatment program ever has been crimi-\nnally prosecuted on account of acts to which the partici-\npant admitted during the program. Plaintiffs do not offer\nany contrary evidence. They do say that, because crim-\ninal charges are pending against each of them, they are\nat greater risk than the Kansas inmates of a change in\nstate practice. Nothing in the formal rules would prevent\n\f6                                                No. 03-1570\n\nIllinois from using statements made in the program as\nconfessions in the event a detainee’s treatment is deemed\nunsuccessful, his civil confinement ends, and the pend-\ning criminal charges are reactivated. This possibility is\nnot, however, a ground of recovery. A majority of the\nJustices concluded in Chavez v. Martinez, No. 01-1444 (U.S.\nMay 27, 2003), that courts may not award damages\nagainst investigators who wrongfully induce suspects to\nsupply incriminating information that is never used in a\ncriminal prosecution. Four Justices (Thomas, J., joined\nby Rehnquist, C.J., and O’Connor & Scalia, JJ.) held this\nbecause the self-incrimination clause applies only to\nevidence used in a criminal case; two Justices (Souter, J.,\njoined by Breyer, J.) held this because any judicially crafted\nexpansion of the clause should be implemented by rem-\nedies other than money damages. Although a different\nmajority (Souter, J., joined by Stevens, Kennedy, Ginsburg\n& Breyer, JJ.) left open the possibility that damages could\nbe awarded under a substantive-due-process theory in the\nevent of genuine physical or mental coercion to speak, our\nplaintiffs do not contend that their arms were twisted or\ntheir health imperiled. So no matter what one makes of\nthe risk that some day Illinois will use against a de-\ntainee evidence gathered in its treatment program, no\ndamages remedy is available. Plaintiffs would be free to\nask the court to suppress evidence offered against them;\nthey are entitled to no more than that option.\n  Youngberg holds that, under the due process clause,\ndetainees are entitled to non-punitive programs de-\nsigned using the exercise of professional judgment. As the\nCourt stated in McKune, many specialists think that self-\naccusatory features are essential to treatment (just as\nalcoholics must admit that they have a problem). Plaintiffs\ndisagree with this proposition, and they distrust poly-\ngraphs, but neither Youngberg nor any other decision\nholds that judges or juries may substitute their judgment\n\fNo. 03-1570                                                7\n\nfor that of the professionals who design such programs.\nThis suit is not about whether polygraphs are reliable\nenough for the results to be used in court; it is about\nwhether wardens and psychologists must pay damages\nfor using them (and other devices) as part of thera-\npeutic programs. The answer is no; it is not clearly es-\ntablished (indeed, it is not the law) that self-accusa-\ntory programs and polygraph machines are forbidden\nwhen treating sex offenders. As far as the Constitution\nis concerned, it is enough that judgment be exer-\ncised. That the Association for the Treatment of Sexual\nAbusers (whose position papers may be found at\n<http://www.atsa.com/pubPPapers.html>) recommends pro-\ngrams different from the one Illinois uses is neither here\nnor there. The Constitution does not command state\nofficials to follow the majority view of a given professional\nassociation. Plaintiffs have not supplied any reason for\nus to conclude that the choices made by Illinois are so\nfar outside the bounds of professional norms that they\nmust be equated with no professional choice at all. In-\ndeed, plaintiffs have not adduced any expert evidence,\nperiod. (At the last minute they tendered a letter by a\nconsultant whose principal writings have had to do with\nvictims’ recovered memories. This unsworn document,\nwhich showed up after the discovery deadline, has no\nevidentiary significance.) Nor have they cited any scholarly\nliterature. The defendants’ contention that Illinois is us-\ning programs that represent the application of reputable\nprofessional judgment stands without any serious contest.\n  As for plaintiffs’ contention that treatment must be\ntailored to each individual rather than administered to\ngroups: one court of appeals has said this (without ex-\nplanation), see Ohlinger v. Watson, 652 F.2d 775, 778-79\n(9th Cir. 1980), but what Youngberg held two years later\nis that (a) committed persons are entitled to some treat-\nment, and (b) what that treatment entails must be decided\n\f8                                             No. 03-1570\n\nby mental-health professionals. Youngberg deprived the\nunreasoned assertion in Ohlinger of whatever slight\nvalue unreasoned judicial assertions otherwise carry. For\nreasons we have given, it is not possible to say on this\nrecord that Illinois’ program exceeds the domain of legiti-\nmate professional judgment. The three appellants prevail\non the merits, without any need for qualified immunity.\n                                                REVERSED\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                       ________________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                  USCA-02-C-0072—6-19-03\n\f",

See\nAllen, 478 U.S. at 373-74. Does placement in a prison,\nsubject to the institution’s usual rules of conduct, signify\npunishment? The answer, given by Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), is no. Wolfish held that pretrial de-\ntainees, who like civil committees may be held for security\nreasons but not punished, may be assigned to prisons and\ncovered by the usual institutional rules, which are designed\nto assure safety and security. Our plaintiffs were not as-\nsigned to high-security institutions, solitary, lockdown, or\notherwise onerous confinement. And one must keep in\nmind that they are pretrial detainees as well as civil\ncommittees: criminal charges against them are pending.\nIf pretrial detainees may be subjected to the ordinary\nconditions of confinement, as Wolfish holds, then so may\npersons detained before trial as sexually dangerous persons.\n   Plaintiffs do not assert that their situation is worse in\nany material way than the situation in which ordinary\npretrial detainees find themselves. They do not contend, for\nexample, that accused sex offenders suffer injury at the\nhands of convicted prisoners at Big Muddy more often than\nat each others’ hands, something that if true might be\nthought to imply that they have been mixed with convicts\nbecause of (rather than in spite of) the special risks of\nviolence in prison. Details such as double celling add\nnothing to plaintiffs’ contentions. Wolfish rejected an\nargument that this practice equates to punishment. 441\nU.S. at 530-43. College dorms, hospitals, and military\nbarracks house people more than one to a room without\namounting to punishment. Just so at Big Muddy. Plain-\ntiffs initial challenge to their confinement therefore fails\non the merits, making it unnecessary to consider immunity.\n  Youngberg, Allen, and Seling all show that detainees\nare entitled to some kind of treatment—but plaintiffs\ndon’t like the kind on offer. Illinois has concluded that\nthe best treatment for sex offenders is group therapy in\n\fNo. 03-1570                                                5\n\nwhich people admit their crimes (to others as well as to\nthemselves), own up to and confront the urges that drive\nthem to perpetrate heinous acts, and then assist each\nother in overcoming those urges. Illinois administers\npolygraph examinations to check whether participants\nin this program are being candid. Its approach is similar\nto the one described, and sustained against constitutional\nchallenge, in McKune v. Lile, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121146\"><a href=\"/opinion/121146/mckune-v-lile/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). The\nprincipal ground of attack in McKune was that the state\ndid not supply use immunity for information obtained in\nits self-accusatory program. The Court replied, in part,\nthat immunity was unnecessary because participation in\nthe program was voluntary; completion of the program\nentitled the offender to early release. Our plaintiffs say\nthat, because they have not been convicted, they also can’t\nearn early release and that their participation is accord-\ningly involuntary. True enough, the plaintiffs in McKune\nhad been convicted while our plaintiffs have not been,\nbut each group enjoys an opportunity to get out earlier.\nPlaintiffs are free to turn down the treatment Illinois\noffers. This may make it harder to show that their prob-\nlems are behind them, that release is in order, and that\nthe criminal charges should be dismissed, but this does\nnot make the choice any less willing or intelligent. An\naccused who turns down a plea bargain (or declines to\nassist the prosecutors) may end up with a longer sen-\ntence, but this does not vitiate the choice to confess. See\nUnited States v. Klotz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567673\"><a href=\"/opinion/567673/united-states-v-james-m-klotz/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 710-11 (7th Cir. 1991).\n  Illinois contends, as Kansas did in McKune, that no\nparticipant in the treatment program ever has been crimi-\nnally prosecuted on account of acts to which the partici-\npant admitted during the program. Plaintiffs do not offer\nany contrary evidence. They do say that, because crim-\ninal charges are pending against each of them, they are\nat greater risk than the Kansas inmates of a change in\nstate practice. Nothing in the formal rules would prevent\n\f6                                                No. 03-1570\n\nIllinois from using statements made in the program as\nconfessions in the event a detainee’s treatment is deemed\nunsuccessful, his civil confinement ends, and the pend-\ning criminal charges are reactivated. This possibility is\nnot, however, a ground of recovery. A majority of the\nJustices concluded in Chavez v. Martinez, No. 01-1444 (U.S.\nMay 27, 2003), that courts may not award damages\nagainst investigators who wrongfully induce suspects to\nsupply incriminating information that is never used in a\ncriminal prosecution. Four Justices (Thomas, J., joined\nby Rehnquist, C.J., and O’Connor & Scalia, JJ.) held this\nbecause the self-incrimination clause applies only to\nevidence used in a criminal case; two Justices (Souter, J.,\njoined by Breyer, J.) held this because any judicially crafted\nexpansion of the clause should be implemented by rem-\nedies other than money damages. Although a different\nmajority (Souter, J., joined by Stevens, Kennedy, Ginsburg\n& Breyer, JJ.) left open the possibility that damages could\nbe awarded under a substantive-due-process theory in the\nevent of genuine physical or mental coercion to speak, our\nplaintiffs do not contend that their arms were twisted or\ntheir health imperiled. So no matter what one makes of\nthe risk that some day Illinois will use against a de-\ntainee evidence gathered in its treatment program, no\ndamages remedy is available. Plaintiffs would be free to\nask the court to suppress evidence offered against them;\nthey are entitled to no more than that option.\n  Youngberg holds that, under the due process clause,\ndetainees are entitled to non-punitive programs de-\nsigned using the exercise of professional judgment. As the\nCourt stated in McKune, many specialists think that self-\naccusatory features are essential to treatment (just as\nalcoholics must admit that they have a problem). Plaintiffs\ndisagree with this proposition, and they distrust poly-\ngraphs, but neither Youngberg nor any other decision\nholds that judges or juries may substitute their judgment\n\fNo. 03-1570                                                7\n\nfor that of the professionals who design such programs.\nThis suit is not about whether polygraphs are reliable\nenough for the results to be used in court; it is about\nwhether wardens and psychologists must pay damages\nfor using them (and other devices) as part of thera-\npeutic programs. The answer is no; it is not clearly es-\ntablished (indeed, it is not the law) that self-accusa-\ntory programs and polygraph machines are forbidden\nwhen treating sex offenders. As far as the Constitution\nis concerned, it is enough that judgment be exer-\ncised. That the Association for the Treatment of Sexual\nAbusers (whose position papers may be found at\n<http://www.atsa.com/pubPPapers.html>) recommends pro-\ngrams different from the one Illinois uses is neither here\nnor there. The Constitution does not command state\nofficials to follow the majority view of a given professional\nassociation. Plaintiffs have not supplied any reason for\nus to conclude that the choices made by Illinois are so\nfar outside the bounds of professional norms that they\nmust be equated with no professional choice at all. In-\ndeed, plaintiffs have not adduced any expert evidence,\nperiod. (At the last minute they tendered a letter by a\nconsultant whose principal writings have had to do with\nvictims’ recovered memories. This unsworn document,\nwhich showed up after the discovery deadline, has no\nevidentiary significance.) Nor have they cited any scholarly\nliterature. The defendants’ contention that Illinois is us-\ning programs that represent the application of reputable\nprofessional judgment stands without any serious contest.\n  As for plaintiffs’ contention that treatment must be\ntailored to each individual rather than administered to\ngroups: one court of appeals has said this (without ex-\nplanation), see Ohlinger v. Watson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 778-79\n(9th Cir. 1980), but what Youngberg held two years later\nis that (a) committed persons are entitled to some treat-\nment, and (b) what that treatment entails must be decided\n\f8                                             No. 03-1570\n\nby mental-health professionals. Youngberg deprived the\nunreasoned assertion in Ohlinger of whatever slight\nvalue unreasoned judicial assertions otherwise carry. For\nreasons we have given, it is not possible to say on this\nrecord that Illinois’ program exceeds the domain of legiti-\nmate professional judgment. The three appellants prevail\non the merits, without any need for qualified immunity.\n                                                REVERSED\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                       ________________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                  USCA-02-C-0072—6-19-03\n\f</pre>",
