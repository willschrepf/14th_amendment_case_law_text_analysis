R.\n\fCiv. P. 60(b). For the reasons stated below, we will affirm the decision of the District\n\nCourt.\n\nI.       Factual Background and Procedural History\n\n         As the situation is well known to the parties, we give only an abbreviated\n\ndescription of the facts and procedural posture of the case.\n\n         Appellant, Goff Group, Inc., (Goff) agreed to manage the underwriting of workers’\n\ncompensation and employers’ liability insurance for appellees, Greenwich Insurance\n\nCompany and XL Specialty Insurance Company (together XL). In this capacity, Goff\n\nwas responsible for collecting and holding premiums in a segregated trust pending\n\nremittance. A dispute arose regarding Goff’s treatment of these funds.\n\n         On August 7, 2002, XL commenced arbitration proceedings against Goff under the\n\nterms of their Program Manager’s Agreement. The next day, Goff successfully brought\n\nsuit in Alabama state court for a temporary restraining order after XL suspended Goff’s\n\nunderwriting authority. The suit was removed to the United States District Court for the\n\nMiddle District of Alabama which granted XL’s subsequent motion to compel arbitration\n\nand dissolve the state court’s injunction. An arbitration panel was convened in the spring\n\nof 2003.\n\n         While arbitration was pending in Philadelphia1 under the terms of the Program\n\nManager’s Agreement, XL commenced a proceeding before the United States District\n\n\n     1\n    The Panel sat in New York at the request of the arbitrators but was deemed to be in\nPhiladelphia as required by the Program Manager’s Agreement.\n\n                                              2\n\fCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking ancillary relief regarding Goff’s\n\nhandling of the funds pending arbitration. On April 28, 2003, the District Court granted\n\nthe relief sought by XL and retained jurisdiction over the matter. In an order dated\n\nOctober 3, 2003, the District Court placed the proceedings in suspense pending\n\narbitration.\n\n       Goff sought a stay of arbitration before the arbitration panel, before an Alabama\n\nstate court, and before the District Court in the Middle District of Alabama, all of which\n\nwere denied. On March 10, 2004, the arbitration panel directed Goff to pay XL\n\n$4,332,382.00 in damages. XL filed a motion before the District Court in the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania to confirm the arbitration award pursuant to the Program\n\nManager’s Agreement which specifically provided for confirmation in the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania. The motion was served by overnight delivery to Goff’s counsel\n\nof record, John Fabiani. Goff declined to submit any opposition to the motion. Rather,\n\nGoff filed a motion to vacate the award in the District Court in the Middle District of\n\nAlabama.\n\n       On April 23, 2004, the District Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued\n\na confirmation order and judgment. On May 3, 2004, Goff moved to vacate the\n\nconfirmation award pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). On July 9, 2004, the District\n\nCourt denied Goff’s motion and this appeal followed.\n\nII.    Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. We have\n\n                                             3\n\fappellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       We review motions for relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Coltec Indus. Inc. v. Hobgood, 280 F.3d 262, 269 (3d Cir. 2002). An abuse of\n\ndiscretion my be found when the lower court’s decision “rests upon a clearly erroneous\n\nfinding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.”\n\nReform Party of Allegheny County v. Allegheny County Dept. of Elections., 174 F.3d\n\n305, 311 (3d Cir. 1999) (quoting International Union, UAW v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 820\n\nF.2d 91, 95 (3d Cir. 1987)).\n\nIII.   Discussion\n\n       Relief from a judgement, such as a confirmation order, may be granted pursuant to\n\nRule 60(b)(6) for “any ... reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.”\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). Such relief can only be granted under extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, where an extreme and unexpected hardship would otherwise occur.\n\nSawka v. Healtheast, Inc., 989 F.2d 138, 140 (3d Cir. 1993). Also, Rule 60(b)(6) does\n\nnot provide relief for “calculated and deliberate” litigation choices which, in hindsight,\n\nwere erroneous. Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).\n\n       Goff offers two purported extraordinary circumstances justifying relief under Rule\n\n60(b)(6). First, Goff contends that it was not properly served the motion to confirm under\n\nthe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Specifically, Goff argues that as a non-resident of the\n\nstate where the arbitration occurred, service was invalid because it was not executed by a\n\nUnited States Marshal. See 9 U.S.C. § 9 (“If the adverse party shall be a nonresident,\n\n                                              4\n\fthen the notice of the application shall be served by the marshal of any district within\n\nwhich the adverse party may be found in like manner as other process of the court.”). In\n\nthis case, Goff was served by delivery of the motion to its counsel of record, John\n\nFabiani, via Federal Express. See generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(1) (“[s]ervice ... on a\n\nparty represented by an attorney is made on the attorney unless the court orders service on\n\nthe party.”).\n\n       Service by mail on Goff’s attorney was proper. Service of a motion to confirm the\n\narbitration award by a U.S. Marshal is unnecessary where a party is already before the\n\ncourt. Smiga v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 766 F.2d 698, 707 (2d Cir. 1985); see also\n\nFed R. Civ. P. 5(a) (distinguishing between the complaint and subsequent pleadings).\n\nSince Goff was before the District Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and that\n\ncourt had explicitly maintained jurisdiction in the matter after granting XL ancillary relief\n\nand staying its proceedings, service by mail on Goff’s attorney of record was permissible\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(1) & (b)(2)(B).\n\n       Second, Goff argues that it was “fundamentally unfair” for the District Court in\n\nPennsylvania to grant the motion to confirm without considering the later-filed motion to\n\nvacate the award pending before the District Court in the Middle District of Alabama.\n\nGoff fails to cite any authority for the proposition that a later-filed motion to vacate in one\n\ncourt divests another district court of jurisdiction to hear a motion to confirm. Thus, the\n\nDistrict Court was correct when it noted that the “pendency of a later-filed motion to\n\nvacate the arbitration award in the Alabama District Court did not divest this court of\n\n                                              5\n\fjurisdiction over the motion to confirm.” District Court Order (July 9, 2004).\n\n       Moreover, the FAA authorizes district courts to confirm arbitration awards when\n\nthe parties agreed to have the arbitration award entered as a judgment by the court. Isidor\n\nPaiewonsky Assoc., Inc. v. Sharp Prop. Inc., 998 F.2d 145, 154 n. 11 (3d Cir. 1993); 9\n\nU.S.C. § 9. Here, the parties agreed to confirmation in the Eastern District of\n\nPennsylvania. Therefore, the District Court’s exercise of jurisdiction was proper.\n\n       Finally, none of the alleged prejudices suffered by Goff rise to the level of\n\n“extraordinary circumstances.” For example, Goff does not dispute that it received notice\n\nof the motion to confirm, only that service was improper. Goff’s decision not to\n\nchallenge the motion to confirm in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was a calculated\n\nlitigation maneuver which is not entitled to reversal via the mechanism of Rule 60(b)(6).\n\nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons explained above, the District Court’s order denying relief pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f",

Also, Rule 60(b)(6) does\n\nnot provide relief for “calculated and deliberate” litigation choices which, in hindsight,\n\nwere erroneous. Ackermann v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104837\"><a href=\"/opinion/104837/ackermann-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (1950).\n\n       Goff offers two purported extraordinary circumstances justifying relief under Rule\n\n60(b)(6). First, Goff contends that it was not properly served the motion to confirm under\n\nthe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Specifically, Goff argues that as a non-resident of the\n\nstate where the arbitration occurred, service was invalid because it was not executed by a\n\nUnited States Marshal. See 9 U.S.C. § 9 (“If the adverse party shall be a nonresident,\n\n                                              4\n\fthen the notice of the application shall be served by the marshal of any district within\n\nwhich the adverse party may be found in like manner as other process of the court.”). In\n\nthis case, Goff was served by delivery of the motion to its counsel of record, John\n\nFabiani, via Federal Express. See generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(1) (“[s]ervice ... on a\n\nparty represented by an attorney is made on the attorney unless the court orders service on\n\nthe party.”).\n\n       Service by mail on Goff’s attorney was proper. Service of a motion to confirm the\n\narbitration award by a U.S. Marshal is unnecessary where a party is already before the\n\ncourt. Smiga v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454671\"><a href=\"/opinion/454671/marcy-smiga-v-dean-witter-reynolds-inc-and-raymond-b-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707 (2d Cir. 1985); see also\n\nFed R. Civ. P. 5(a) (distinguishing between the complaint and subsequent pleadings).\n\nSince Goff was before the District Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and that\n\ncourt had explicitly maintained jurisdiction in the matter after granting XL ancillary relief\n\nand staying its proceedings, service by mail on Goff’s attorney of record was permissible\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(1) & (b)(2)(B).\n\n       Second, Goff argues that it was “fundamentally unfair” for the District Court in\n\nPennsylvania to grant the motion to confirm without considering the later-filed motion to\n\nvacate the award pending before the District Court in the Middle District of Alabama.\n\nGoff fails to cite any authority for the proposition that a later-filed motion to vacate in one\n\ncourt divests another district court of jurisdiction to hear a motion to confirm. Thus, the\n\nDistrict Court was correct when it noted that the “pendency of a later-filed motion to\n\nvacate the arbitration award in the Alabama District Court did not divest this court of\n\n                                              5\n\fjurisdiction over the motion to confirm.” District Court Order (July 9, 2004).\n\n       Moreover, the FAA authorizes district courts to confirm arbitration awards when\n\nthe parties agreed to have the arbitration award entered as a judgment by the court. Isidor\n\nPaiewonsky Assoc., Inc. v. Sharp Prop. Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610915\"><a href=\"/opinion/610915/isidor-paiewonsky-associates-inc-sharp-properties-inc-third-party-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 n. 11 (3d Cir. 1993); 9\n\nU.S.C. § 9. Here, the parties agreed to confirmation in the Eastern District of\n\nPennsylvania. Therefore, the District Court’s exercise of jurisdiction was proper.\n\n       Finally, none of the alleged prejudices suffered by Goff rise to the level of\n\n“extraordinary circumstances.” For example, Goff does not dispute that it received notice\n\nof the motion to confirm, only that service was improper. Goff’s decision not to\n\nchallenge the motion to confirm in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was a calculated\n\nlitigation maneuver which is not entitled to reversal via the mechanism of Rule 60(b)(6).\n\nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons explained above, the District Court’s order denying relief pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f</pre>",
