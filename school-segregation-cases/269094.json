The disputed formula is contained in the collective bargaining contract executed between the Jackson Teachers Association and the Board of Education of the City of Jackson, Michigan.  It reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>ARTICLE XII.B.1.  In the event that it becomes necessary to reduce the number of teachers through layoff from employment by the Board, teachers with the most seniority in the district shall be retained, except that at no time will there be a greater percentage of minority personnel laid off than the current percentage of minority personnel employed at the time of the layoff.    In no event will the number given notice of possible layoff be greater than the number of positions to be eliminated.  Each teacher so affected will be called back in reverse order for positions for which he is certified maintaining the above minority balance.  (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants, who object to the Board's following this provision, contend that the quoted provision violates both federal and state statutory and constitutional provisions, including particularly the fourteenth amendment, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e to 2000e-17 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981);  42 U.S.C.

XII.B.1. is still before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge who heard this case wrote a careful opinion upholding the validity of the layoff system adopted by the School Board and the Federation of Teachers.  We quote in part Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 546 F.Supp. 1195 (E.D.Mich.1982) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Plaintiffs argue first that they are entitled to summary judgment because an employer and a union cannot lawfully negotiate a voluntary affirmative action plan which gives preferential treatment to minorities, where there has been no judicial finding of past employer discrimination.  Stated in other words, plaintiffs argue that societal discrimination, as opposed to identifiable employer discrimination, is not a lawful basis for the adoption of a voluntary affirmative action plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979) held that Title VII does not prohibit a private employer from voluntarily adopting an affirmative action plan 'to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories.'    443 U.S. at 209, 99 S.Ct. at 2730.  In Weber, there was no judicial finding that the private employer, Kaiser Aluminum, had ever engaged in race discrimination.  However, Kaiser's work force statistics for the years prior to the adoption of the affirmative action plan pointed up gross disparities between the number of blacks employed by Kaiser and the number of blacks in the relevant labor market.  Thus, Weber stands for the proposition that Title VII does not require a judicial finding of employer discrimination before a private sector employer may adopt an affirmative action plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Detroit Police Officers' Association v.

The white officers challenged the affirmative promotion plan on Title VII and Equal Protection grounds.  The Sixth Circuit relied on Weber to hold that the internal determination of racial disparities justified the voluntary plan, even though there had been no prior judicial determination of race discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>\"[D]iscriminatory acts which might not give rise to legal liability may nonetheless be sufficient to justify a voluntary remedial affirmative action plan...  As Justice Blackmun noted in his concurring opinion in Weber, a preferential hiring plan which seeks to alleviate an imbalance caused by traditional practices of job segregation is a reasonable voluntary response 'whether or not a court, on these facts, could order the same step as a remedy'...    Under Weber, the district court's holding that 'quota relief, when fashioned by the employer without the assistance and direction of the court, is not permitted ...' ... cannot stand as a matter of law.  608 F.2d at 689-90.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Having thus held on the Title VII claim, the Young court applied the same principle to the Constitutional challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>\"It was also error to require that there be judicial determination of past discrimination for a state to undertake a race-conscious remedy, as stated by the district court.  This requirement would be 'self-defeating' and would 'severely undermine' voluntary remedial efforts.  [Citing Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 364, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2785, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) ].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" Thus, it appears that plaintiffs' contention that the affirmative action plan at issue here cannot stand because there has been no prior judicial determination that the defendants engaged in racial discrimination, is without merit.  Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on this ground is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>\"b.

Justice Brennan, for the majority in Weber, adhered closely to the facts of that case and framed this requirement in terms of 'conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories.'    443 U.S. at 209, 99 S.Ct. at 2730.  Justice Blackmun, in concurrence in Weber, held out for an 'arguable violation' standard.  In other words, employers and unions which had committed 'arguable violations' of Title VII would be free to adopt voluntary affirmative action plans without fear of Title VII liability to whites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"For purposes of the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution, the Young court stated this requirement as follows:  'whether \"there is a sound basis for concluding that minority underrepresentation is substantial and chronic, and that the handicap of past discrimination is impeding access [and promotion] of minorities...,\" ' 608 F.2d at 694.  The standard was adopted directly from the opinion of Justices Brennan, White, Marshall and Blackmun in Bakke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Young court expressly held that:  [I]t was error to require proof that the persons receiving the preferential treatment had been individually subjected to discrimination, for 'it is enough that each recipient is within a general class of persons likely to have been the victims of discrimination.'    608 F.2d at 694.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The reason for this requirement is to permit the court to determine that the purpose of the affirmative action plan is legitimate.   Valentine v. Smith, 654 F.2d 503, 508 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1124, 102 S.Ct. 972, 71 L.Ed.2d 111 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The requirement of some showing of previous underrepresentation of minorities must, of course, be adapted to the facts and circumstances of the particular case.  In both Weber and Young it was appropriate, when searching for evidence of past discrimination, to compare the percentage of blacks in the employer's work force with the percentage of blacks in the relevant labor pool.  For example, prior to the adoption of the affirmative action plan challenged in Weber, 1.83 percent of Kaiser-Aluminum's skilled workers were black while the relevant work force was 39 percent black.  433 U.S. at 198-99, 99 S.Ct. at 2724.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"However, in the setting of this case, it is appropriate to compare the percentage of minority teachers to the percentage of minority students in the student body, rather than with the percentage of minorities in the relevant labor market.  It is appropriate because teaching is more than just a job.  Teachers are role-models for their students.  More specifically, minority teachers are role-models for minority students.  This is vitally important because societal discrimination has often deprived minority children of other role-models.   See, Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of Education, 498 F.Supp. 732, 748 (W.D.Mich.1980) ('faculty ought to begin to approximate the percentage of minority students in the district').</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" Because of this one vitally important aspect of the teaching profession, the court holds that in applying the Young 'substantial underrepresentation' standard, it may compare the percentage of minority faculty with the percentage of minorities in the student body, rather than with the percentage of minorities in the relevant labor pool.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Applying this standard, it is clear that minority teachers were 'substantially' and 'chronically' underrepresented on the Jackson School District faculty in the years preceding the adoption of the affirmative action plan.  In 1953, there were no black teachers and by 1961, only 1.8 percent of the faculty was black.  The court has not been provided with figures establishing the percentage of black students in the Jackson School District during these years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" However, by the school year 1968-69, black students made up 15.2 percent of the total student population, while black faculty members constituted only 3.9 percent of the total teaching staff.  While the percentage of minority students remained relatively constant (15.9 percent in 1971), the percentage of minority faculty members increased, but only to 5.5 percent in 1970-71 and 8.3-8.8 percent in 1971-72.<sup>3</sup>  These findings were made by the school board and the court holds that the school board was competent to make such findings.   Regents of University of California v. Bakke, supra, 438 U.S. at 363-64, 98 S.Ct. at 2785;  see also, McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U.S. 39, 91 S.Ct. 1287, 28 L.Ed.2d 582 (1971);  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>3. The 8.3 percent figure appears in the affidavit of Susan Diebold, one of the plaintiffs.  The other figures appear in the affidavit of Jane I. Phelps, custodian of employment and student records and coordinator of personnel operations for the Jackson Public Schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" The court finds that this is 'substantial' and 'chronic' underrepresentation within the meaning of Young.    Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment would permit the Jackson School Board and the Jackson Education Association to voluntarily adopt, through collective bargaining negotiations, an affirmative action plan to protect minority teachers from the effects of layoffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The objective of this affirmative action plan to remedy past 'substantial' and 'chronic' underrepresentation of minority teachers on the Jackson School District faculty is plainly constitutional.   Valentine v. Smith, supra, at 509.  Therefore, the only remaining question is whether the means adopted by the Jackson School Board to achieve its objective are constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" The test is one of reasonableness.   Detroit Police Officers' Association v. Young, supra, at 694, 696.  The reasonableness test asks whether the affirmative action plan is 'substantially related' to the objectives of remedying past discrimination and correcting 'substantial' and 'chronic' underrepresentation.

The school board (and the bargaining representative of the teachers) have a legitimate interest in curing the past racial isolation of black teachers in the school system concerned.  No undue stigma attaches in the instant case.  We recognize that on the record before us, at least one white school teacher, presumably entirely innocent of any racial discrimination, has suffered by being displaced by the plan which plaintiffs attack here.  The Supreme Court has, however, previously recognized that \"[w]hen effectuating a limited and properly-tailored remedy to cure the effects of prior discrimination, such a 'sharing of the burden' by innocent parties is not impermissible.\"   Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 484, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2778, 65 L.Ed.2d 902 (1980) (opinion of Burger, C.J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court's recent opinion in Bratton v.

They have done so voluntarily to cure faculty racial imbalance and as a matter of educational policy.  We believe that it is within the power and authority of the parties to this agreement so to do, and that their action is in no respect in violation of the United States Constitution or federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of the United States has just decided Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v.

We conclude that Stotts does not require any revision or change of result in the opinion above.  The affirmative action plan involved in our instant case was not the product of any court order.  It resulted from voluntary decisions in the collective bargaining process between the school board and the bargaining agent for the teachers.  We do not read Stotts as barring this form of affirmative action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion in Stotts specifically declined to decide the issue with which we are confronted.

Whether the City, a public employer, could have taken this course without violating the law is an issue we need not decide.  The fact is that in this case the City took no such action and that the modification of the decree was imposed over its objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">--- U.S. at ----, 104 S.Ct. at 2590 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Stotts case overrule United Steelworkers v.

The goal of such policy shall be to have at least the same percentage of minority racial representation on each individual staff as is represented by the student population of the Jackson Public Schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ARTICLE VII.D.2.   In order that this goal be expeditiously met, it is agreed that, for vacancies in school buildings in which this goal has not been met, the Board will actively seek, recruit, and hire qualified minority teachers for such vacancies.  The Board will annually review each individual staff to ensure proper minority representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ARTICLE XII.B.1.   In the event that it becomes necessary to reduce the number of teachers through layoff from employment by the Board, teachers with the most seniority in the district shall be retained, except that at no time will there be a greater percentage of minority personnel laid off than the current percentage of minority personnel employed at the time of the layoff.    In no event will the number given notice of possible layoff be greater than the number of positions to be eliminated.  Each teacher so affected will be called back in reverse order for positions for which he is certified maintaining the above minority balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract containing these provisions, is \"a voluntary, race-conscious affirmative action plan.\"    It was adopted by a majority vote of the Jackson Teachers Association as well as by the Jackson Board of Education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Wellford's concurring opinion concludes \"I would AFFIRM the decision that this voluntary affirmative action layoff system, subjected to collective bargaining safeguards, was sufficient to meet the challenge presented by plaintiffs.\"    This is a good summary of this majority opinion's rationale as well as that of Judge Wellford's concurrence.  The majority opinion is not, however intended, as Judge Wellford seems to imply, to overrule Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of Education, 706 F.2d 757 (6th Cir.1983), either directly or sub silentio.  The agreement which the School Board and the Jackson Teachers Association (set out in full on pages 7 and 8 of this opinion) was voluntarily entered into by the Jackson Board of Education and the Jackson Teachers' union.  Neither Judge Joiner nor this court has held that its adoption was constitutionally mandated.  This opinion does imply that that agreement is constitutionally permissible.  It is also a collective bargaining contract enforceable as a voluntary affirmative action plan designed to remedy past obvious race discrimination and to meet the practical problems posed by racial tensions engendered by that history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What this court ruled in the Kalamazoo case was that the District Court did not have the constitutional authority to design and order the remedy of a 20% hiring quota for black teachers disregarding the contractual and legal seniority and tenure rights of white teachers who would be displaced.  In this regard, it seems to have anticipated the opinion of the majority of the Supreme Court in Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, --- U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principle involved in both cases seems to be that voluntary affirmative action plans contracted between the parties are easier to defend in the courts than those mandated ab initio by federal trial courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WELLFORD, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur in the result reached in this case, but I write separately in an effort to address an issue which the majority expressly refuses to answer.

My problem with this determination is that Judge Joiner expressly relied upon Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of Education, 498 F.Supp. 732 (W.D.Mich.1980), in stating a proposition essential to his decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>[I]n the setting of this case, it is appropriate to compare the percentage of minority teachers to the percentage of minority students in the student body, rather than with the percentage of minorities in the relevant labor market.  It is appropriate because teaching is more than just a job.  Teachers are role-models for their students.  More specifically, minority teachers are role-models for minority students.  This is vitally important because societal discrimination has often deprived minority children of other role-models.   See, Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of Education, 498 F.Supp. 732, 748 (W.D.Mich.1980) (\"faculty ought to begin to approximate the percentage of minority students in the district\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wygant v.

In doing so it was made clear that comparing the percentage of minority teachers to the percentage of minority students and then requiring a minority quota of teachers based on the latter proportion was not only not constitutionally mandated, it was inappropriate under the circumstances because the court had ignored the practicalities of the situation in the school district.   Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of Education, 706 F.2d 757, 762 (6th Cir.1983).   See also International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 375, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1874, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (court should take practicalities into account in devising remedies under Title VII and in any equitable decree.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court, moreover, in reversing the trial court in the Oliver case, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>In most school desegregation cases, as in this one, see 498 F.Supp. at 746, 751, the constitutional rights to be vindicated are those of the students, not of the teachers or potential teachers.  The students, however, do not have a constitutional right to attend a school with a teaching staff of any particular racial composition.  See Fort Bend Independent School District v. City of Stafford, 651 F.2d 1133 (5th Cir.1981) (holding that the percentage of minority faculty need not approximate the percentage of minority students).  Rather, with respect to the teaching staff, all that the students are entitled to is the \"sustained good faith effort to recruit minority faculty members so as to remedy the effects of any past discriminatory practices.\"   Id. at 1140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">706 F.2d at 762 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court, then, in citing with approval Fort Bend Independent School District v. City of Stafford, 651 F.2d 1133, (5th Cir.1981), a case decided after the district court decision in Oliver, held that there is no constitutional right to attend a school with a minority teacher ratio the same as the minority ratio of students.  So long as the school district, over a period of years, had voluntarily hired minority teachers without evidence of discrimination, it was erroneous to impose a quota system utilizing the minority student ratio as the minimum quota for minority teachers.   Oliver, 706 F.2d at 763.  The court, rather, advised:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>But, generally, the wiser approach is a more flexible affirmative action program rather than a hiring quota.   Cf. University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (affirmative action admission programs of educational institutions may take race into account, but racial quotas are prohibited).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 763.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the plaintiffs in this case presented data as to the percentage of qualified minority teachers in the relevant labor market to show that defendant Board's hiring of black teachers over a number of years had equaled that figure, I believe this court may well have been required to reverse under the rationale of Oliver.    For example, had defendant shown that from 1969 to 1972 the qualified minority teacher ratio in the relevant market was 10% and that 16% of its teachers hired were a minority, the rationale of Oliver would have brought the contract provision at issue into very serious question.   See United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 209, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 2730, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979), (Court indicated that a showing of \"conspicuous racial imbalance\" was required).

Thus, Young utilized an available, reasonable labor base of eligible minority workers, not the general population of the city served by the police force.  The metropolitan labor market should be the \"proper comparison.\"   See Young, 608 F.2d at 688, and Hazelwood School District v.

The Court of Appeals was correct in the view that a proper comparison was between the racial composition of Hazelwood's teaching staff and the racial composition of the qualified public school teacher population in the relevant labor market.   See Teamsters, supra, [431 U.S.] at 337-338, and n. 17 [97 S.Ct. at 1855-1856 and n. 17].  The percentage of Negroes on Hazelwood's teaching staff in 1972-1973 was 1.4% and in 1973-1974 it was 1.8%.  By contrast, the percentage of qualified Negro teachers in the area was, according to the 1970 census, at least 5.7%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hazelwood School District, 433 U.S. at 308, 97 S.Ct. at 2741-42 (footnotes omitted).

For example, prior to the adoption of the affirmative action plan challenged in Weber, 1.83 percent of Kaiser-Aluminum's skilled workers were black while the relevant work force was 39 percent black.  433 U.S. at 198-99, 99 S.Ct. at 2724.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"However, in the setting of this case, it is appropriate to compare the percentage of minority teachers to the percentage of minority students in the student body, rather than with the percentage of minorities in the relevant labor market.

It is appropriate because teaching is more than just a job.  Teachers are role-models for their students.  More specifically, minority teachers are role-models for minority students.  This is vitally important because societal discrimination has often deprived minority children of other role-models.   See, Oliver v.

So long as the school district, over a period of years, had voluntarily hired minority teachers without evidence of discrimination, it was erroneous to impose a quota system utilizing the minority student ratio as the minimum quota for minority teachers.

For example, had defendant shown that from 1969 to 1972 the qualified minority teacher ratio in the relevant market was 10% and that 16% of its teachers hired were a minority, the rationale of Oliver would have brought the contract provision at issue into very serious question.

See Teamsters, supra, [431 U.S.] at 337-338, and n. 17 [97 S.Ct. at 1855-1856 and n. 17].  The percentage of Negroes on Hazelwood's teaching staff in 1972-1973 was 1.4% and in 1973-1974 it was 1.8%.
