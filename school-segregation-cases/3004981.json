He was\n\nsentenced to natural life in prison. On appeal, defendant argues that: (1) his sentence is\n\nexcessive; (2) his conviction for aggravated criminal sexual assault should be reversed because\n\nthe State failed to prove that the victim was alive at the time of the sexual assault; (3) his\n\nconviction for burglary should be reversed because he had unlimited authority to be inside the\n\nfuneral home; (4) the jury instructions constructively amended the burglary charge of the\n\nindictment; (5) the trial court erred in ruling that he failed to establish a prima facie case of racial\n\ndiscrimination during voir dire; and (6) the State made improper comments during closing and\n\nrebuttal arguments.\n\f1-07-2516\n\n\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Defendant, then 19 years old, was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated criminal\n\nsexual assault, burglary, concealment of a homicidal death, robbery, and armed robbery after the\n\nbody of Mary Stachowicz was found under the floorboards of his apartment, which was located\n\nabove the F.J. Sikorski Funeral Home. Defendant was convicted of all charges except robbery\n\nand armed robbery. The trial court found defendant eligible for the death penalty based on the\n\nmurder during the commission of aggravated criminal sexual assault but sentenced him to natural\n\nlife in prison for the murder, 30 years' imprisonment for aggravated criminal sexual assault, 7\n\nyears' imprisonment for burglary, and 3 years' imprisonment for concealment of a homicidal\n\ndeath, all sentences to be served concurrently. The following evidence was adduced at trial.\n\n                                             A. Trial\n\n                                       1. Francine Sikorski\n\n       Francine Sikorski owned the F.J. Sikorski Funeral Home, located at 3630 West George\n\nStreet in Chicago, and lived in apartment 2 East above the funeral home. Defendant and Ray\n\nScacchitti moved into the other apartment, 2 West, in December 2001. The stairwell to the\n\napartments could be accessed through a door in the lobby of the funeral home; through a single\n\ndoor outside of the funeral home, just west of the main entrance on George Street; and through a\n\nstairwell in the backyard. Sikorski testified that she allowed them to live in the apartment rent-\n\nfree in exchange for their services at the funeral home. Defendant and Scacchitti had keys to the\n\nfront door of the funeral home and keys to their apartment.\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       In the fall of 2002, defendant and Scacchitti stopped working at the funeral home.\n\nSikorski testified that she asked defendant and Scacchitti to stop working and move out because\n\nshe and Scacchitti were having personality conflicts. On cross-examination, Sikorski admitted\n\nthat she \"might\" have told the police the night of the murder that she had fired defendant.\n\nSikorski testified that she gave defendant the option of continuing to stay there; she further\n\ntestified that she loved defendant, she talks to him almost daily, and she visits him weekly.\n\nScacchitti and defendant began looking for another place to live and packing their belongings in\n\nboxes. After Sikorski told Scacchitti and defendant to move out, she expected that they would\n\nuse the same two doors to that apartment, and they had the authority to do so.\n\n       About a month before her death, Mary Stachowicz began working part-time at the funeral\n\nhome doing light cleaning and helping with Polish translations.\n\n       The morning of November 13, 2002, Christopher Stachowicz asked his mother, Mary, if\n\nhe could borrow $10. When he was taking the money from her wallet, he noticed that there was\n\na $10 bill and a $20 bill, as well as 5 to 10 other bills. He took the $10 bill, left the remaining\n\nbills, and returned the wallet to his mother's purse.\n\n       Sikorski testified that on November 13, 2002, Mary arrived at the funeral home at 8:30\n\na.m. There was a funeral at the church across the street at 10 a.m. At 10:50 a.m., Sikorski\n\nreturned to the funeral home to pick up her belongings and then left for the cemetery. Mary\n\nstayed at the funeral home to answer the phones until Sikorski returned. Mary called her\n\nhusband, Jerry, at 11 a.m. The caller ID for the funeral home's phone showed that a call came in\n\non November 13, 2002, at 11:32 a.m., from the pay phone at the Chicago Transit Authority\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n(CTA) station at Belmont and Kimball.\n\n       Sikorski returned at 12:45 p.m. The front door to the funeral home was locked, and a\n\nman was standing outside with clothes for the next visitation. Sikorski looked through the\n\nfuneral home but could not find Mary. She found Mary's purse and jacket on the chair in the\n\narrangement room and her car was still in the parking lot. In addition, there was a clean dish and\n\na dish towel on the table near Mary's jacket and purse.\n\n       Sikorski went to pick up her daughter in Wilmette at 2:45 p.m. and was gone for 45\n\nminutes. When she returned, she called the church looking for Mary and went through Mary's\n\npurse looking for her husband's phone number. Sikorski called the rectory at St. Constance\n\nchurch, where Mary was scheduled to work later that day, and got her husband's number. At\n\n3:50 p.m., Francine Sikorski called Jerry Stachowicz and told him that Mary was missing. Jerry\n\nand his son went to the funeral home, arriving at 4:30 p.m. Jerry discovered Mary's jacket, scarf,\n\nand purse sitting on a chair. Christopher looked in his mother's wallet and discovered that the\n\nbillfold area was empty.\n\n       Jerry called the police and reported his wife missing. Mary's family and the police\n\nsearched for her at the funeral home and the church across the street.\n\n                                        2. Ray Scacchitti\n\n       Scacchitti testified that he is homosexual and defendant is bisexual. In November 2002,\n\nhe and defendant were living openly as a couple in an apartment above the funeral home. In\n\nJanuary or February of 2002, shortly after Scacchitti and defendant moved into the apartment,\n\nthey began working at the funeral home. Their wages would be deducted from their rent. In\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nOctober 2002, Sikorksi told Scacchitti and defendant that she did not want them working at the\n\nfuneral home anymore. She also asked them to move out. After this time, neither Scacchitti nor\n\ndefendant would \"go into different rooms of the funeral home.\"\n\n       Soon after Sikorksi terminated Scacchitti's and defendant's employment, she hired Mary\n\nStachowicz, whom Scacchitti knew from St. Hyacinth, the church across the street. Scacchitti\n\ntestified that Mary knew he was homosexual and never confronted him or questioned his beliefs.\n\nHowever, defendant and the State stipulated that Angela Ruffolo, Mary's daughter, would testify\n\nthat her mother did not like defendant and Ray and did not approve of their lifestyle.\n\n       The morning of November 13, 2002, defendant went with Scacchitti to Flower Fantasy,\n\nthe flower shop where Scacchitti worked. When they arrived, Scacchitti gave defendant $4 to\n\nbuy breakfast; defendant went to buy it and then ate while Scacchitti worked. After 10:30 a.m.,\n\ndefendant went with the flower shop owner's sister to a fruit store half a block away, where they\n\nbought fruit for a fruit basket. At 11 a.m., defendant left for the Harlem and Irving Plaza mall,\n\nwhere he was to look for a job, play video games, and eat lunch. Scacchitti gave him between $4\n\nand $7. Scacchitti also gave defendant his cell phone.\n\n       After defendant left the flower shop, Scacchitti tried to reach him between three and five\n\ntimes. Defendant did not respond to any of those calls, which was unusual. At 3 p.m. he heard\n\nfrom defendant, who said he was on his way back to the flower shop. When defendant arrived at\n\nthe flower shop, he was limping and there was blood on his temple. Defendant said he injured\n\nhimself when he played basketball at the Norridge gym and that he cut his finger. Defendant\n\ngave Scacchitti $30, which he claimed that he won from the basketball game. Scacchitti never\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nknew defendant to have that much money.\n\n       Defendant changed into his Subway uniform in the bathroom of the flower shop and put\n\nthe clothes he had been wearing in the van. Scacchitti took him to work some time after 4 p.m.\n\nHe then returned to the flower shop and drove the owner's sister to Schiller Park. While he was\n\ntrying to find the phone number for an apartment that was for rent, Sikorski called him and said\n\nthat Mary was missing. Scacchitti went to the Subway where defendant was working and asked\n\nif he had been to the funeral home that day. Defendant responded that he had not. Because\n\ndefendant was finished working, the two returned home.\n\n       Mary's family asked to search defendant and Ray's apartment. After sending defendant\n\nfirst to check on their pets, Scacchitti took Mary's son upstairs to their apartment.\n\n       On November 13 or 14, defendant burned incense while playing video games. On the\n\n14th, when a story about Mary was on the television news, defendant said, \"God doesn't let bad\n\nthings happen to good people.\" Scacchitti testified that defendant's behavior was normal.\n\n                                              3. Police\n\n       Detective Kevin McDonald testified that on November 15, 2002, he spoke to defendant at\n\nthe police station. Defendant gave the detective his CTA card. McDonald spoke to the Norridge\n\nPark District and asked CTA security to fax a printout of the activity on defendant's CTA card.\n\nMcDonald confronted defendant with the information that the CTA card had been purchased at\n\nthe Belmont-Kimball Blue Line station at 3:02 p.m. on November 13, 2002, and was used\n\nseconds later to board the subway at that station. It was then used at 3:43 p.m. to board a bus at\n\nthe Cumberland station. McDonald also informed defendant that the outdoor basketball courts in\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nNorridge were closed at that time and that the indoor basketball court did not open until 3:30 that\n\nafternoon. To play basketball at the Norridge Park District indoor facility, defendant would have\n\nbeen required to sign in and pay $5 or have a resident pass. Defendant did not have such a pass.\n\nHe told defendant that he would send detectives to the locations that he mentioned to see if they\n\ncould get video surveillance to verify where he was.\n\n       Defendant responded that he wanted to tell the truth about what happened that day.\n\nDefendant stated that on November 13, 2002, he left the florist at 11:30 a.m. and took the El back\n\nto the funeral home, where he intended to play video games. As he walked on George Street\n\napproaching the funeral home, he saw two Hispanic men leave the front of the funeral home. He\n\ngave detailed descriptions of the two men. Defendant stated that he approached the men and\n\nasked if he could help them. They asked whether he knew Ray Scacchitti, and he replied that he\n\ndid. The men responded, \"If you tell anybody we were at the funeral home, we will kill you, Ray,\n\nand your pets.\" The larger man reached toward the small of his back, as if reaching for a\n\nweapon, but the other man stopped him. They left in a black Lincoln driven by a third man.\n\nDefendant then told McDonald that he entered his apartment and discovered that one of the rear\n\nwindows was open and the safe that contained Scacchitti's jewelry had been moved. He took\n\ncare of his pets and walked around to clear his head before taking the El back to the florist.\n\n       McDonald asked defendant what he thought happened to Mary with those people in the\n\nfuneral home. Defendant responded that he believed the two men climbed up the garage and\n\nentered his apartment through the rear window. Mary probably heard as they moved the safe and\n\nthreatened to call the police. The offenders probably left the apartment, grabbed Mary, and\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ndragged her back to the apartment so they would not get blood on the funeral home's carpet.\n\nNext, he believed that the men tried to gag Mary and ended up beating her to death when she\n\nviolently fought back. They hid the body in the funeral home in an effort to incriminate\n\ndefendant and Ray. Possible places to hide the body included the garage, air ducts in the\n\nbasement, a rear office, and a space in the ceiling of the basement. He also noted a crawl space\n\nin the den of his apartment for radiator pipes. The space was covered by boards, a rug, a table,\n\nand a bust of Jesus. Defendant stated that he also remembered that there had been art books on\n\nthe table and that they were moved. He surmised, therefore, that the body had been hidden in\n\nthat crawl space. Defendant drew a map of his apartment showing the crawl space.\n\n       Detective John Callaghan testified that he checked the common areas of the funeral\n\nhome, including the areas that defendant specified in his statement. They entered defendant's\n\napartment when he consented to the search. They proceeded to the crawl space that defendant\n\nspecified and found Mary's body. Her shirt was pulled up and her bra was protruding.\n\n       Detective Robert Rutherford left the funeral home at 7 p.m. on November 15, 2002, and\n\nreturned to the police station, where he spoke to defendant. Defendant stated that he and\n\nScacchitti were no longer working for the funeral home and were in the process of moving out of\n\ntheir apartment. On November 13, 2002, he went to the flower shop with Scacchitti and got into\n\na disagreement with him about the path his life was taking. Defendant stated that he left the\n\nflower shop and returned to the apartment. He entered the apartment through the door on George\n\nStreet that leads directly up the staircase to his apartment. When he opened the door, Mary\n\nopened the door to the staircase from the lobby of the funeral home and said, \"Oh, it's you.\"\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nDefendant gave her a disrespectful wave of his hand, as if to say, \"Don't bother me,\" and\n\ncontinued up the stairs. He stated that Mary started to close the door, stopped, opened it back up,\n\nand asked, \"Why do you fuck boys?\" Defendant told her to \"fuck off\" and continued up the\n\nstairs.\n\n          Defendant stated that Mary followed him up the stairs and asked, \"Why don't you like\n\ngirls? Why do you fuck boys?\" He entered his apartment and shut the door. He heard banging\n\non the door and started to lose control. He opened the door, grabbed Mary by the hair, and\n\ndragged her into the apartment. She slapped and kicked him, and he let her go. He backed up\n\ninto the dining room, and Mary followed him, asking, \"Why don't you like girls?\" He slapped\n\nMary, and she slapped him back. As he continued backing up through the kitchen to the den, he\n\n\"lost total control of himself.\" He punched Mary in her jaw, knocking her to the ground. He\n\ngrabbed a knife that was on top of some boxes and stabbed her and hit her until he became\n\nexhausted. He saw red while he was stabbing and beating her. He sat there for 10 minutes to\n\ncatch his breath, then he took Mary's pulse to see if she was alive. He did not feel a pulse, so he\n\ngot three plastic bags and wrapped them around her head to stop the blood from going onto the\n\nfloor.\n\n          He got a sheet off the couch in the front room and wrapped Mary's body in it. He hid her\n\nbody in the crawl space below the den. He cleaned the floor and furniture using three rolls of\n\npaper towels and put the paper towels, as well as a blood-covered sheet from the couch, into a\n\ngarbage bag. He went down the front stairs into the funeral home. As he walked through the\n\nfuneral home, he saw Mary's purse out in the open. He took $85 from her purse, left through the\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nback door, hopped a fence, and walked down the alley, where he put the garbage bag into a\n\ngarbage can. He walked to the El stop and went back to the flower shop. When he got to the\n\nflower shop, defendant gave Scacchitti $30 and told him he won it playing basketball. He\n\nchanged into his work uniform and left his dirty clothes in the van.\n\n       Detective Robert Carrillo testified that on November 15, 2002, defendant asked him to\n\ntake the $52 in his wallet and give it to Mary's family. Defendant stated that he was going to take\n\nthat money, whatever he could steal from Ray, and any valuables from the funeral home to buy a\n\nticket to Las Vegas.\n\n       Carrillo contacted the State's Attorney's office. Assistant State's Attorney Mark Hitt\n\narrived at 10 p.m. and spoke to defendant. At the end of their conversation, defendant gave a\n\nvideotaped statement, which was substantially similar to his statements to Rutherford and\n\nCarrillo. At the time defendant gave this statement, the autopsy had not been completed.\n\n       After defendant finished his videotaped statement, defendant asked if he could write Ray\n\na note. Hitt gave defendant a pen and some paper and allowed him to write a note. When\n\ndefendant was done, Hitt showed it to Detective Carrillo and then took it to Ray. In the note,\n\ndefendant expressed his affection for Scacchitti and apologized for what he had done. He asked\n\nSchacchitti, \"Please don't think of me as a monster.\"\n\n       On November 16, 2002, after learning the results of Mary's autopsy, Detective Carrillo\n\ntold defendant that Mary's cause of death was strangulation. Defendant stated that after he beat\n\nand stabbed Mary until he was exhausted, he checked for a pulse and did not find one. He saw\n\nthe telephone line for the funeral home lit up, suggesting that Francine had returned from the\n\n\n                                               -10-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nfuneral. He was afraid that Francine might be calling the police, so he decided to hide the body.\n\nHe placed the bags over Mary's head and pressed down on the neck area for two minutes, hoping\n\nthat the blood would coagulate and form a seal. The blood slowed down, and he placed the body\n\nin a blanket and then put the body in the floorboards. Defendant did not mention having sexual\n\ncontact with Mary, and Carrillo did not ask because he was unaware at that point.\n\n       Assistant State's Attorney Julie Egan learned the results of the autopsy on November 16,\n\n2002. She briefly spoke to defendant and told him that the cause of Mary's death was\n\nstrangulation and asked if he knew anything about that. Defendant explained that he placed\n\nplastic bags over Mary's head to stop the bleeding, and when that did not work, he placed his\n\nhands around the victim's throat for two minutes.\n\n                                      4. Medical Examiner\n\n       The medical examiner, Dr. Eupil Choi, found 11 superficial stab wounds on the back and\n\nright side of Mary's head and on her neck. The stab wounds were inflicted from behind. The\n\nwound to her neck struck the cervical bone and would have caused her to lose consciousness. It\n\nalso would have caused the knife to bend. Ten of her ribs were fractured, and there were\n\nabrasions on her arms and elbows. She had numerous injuries indicative of strangulation,\n\nincluding bruising on her neck and the underside of her chin and fractured neck bones. The\n\nstrangulation injuries were consistent with being strangled with the sheet that her body was\n\nwrapped in.\n\n       The doctor did not find any injuries to her vagina or rectum consistent with sexual\n\nassault, nor was her clothing ripped. He testified, however, that sexual assault can occur without\n\n\n                                               -11-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nany injuries to the body. Further, Mary gave birth four times, and each time a woman gives birth,\n\nthe elasticity of the vagina is reduced, which, in turn, makes vaginal injuries less likely. She also\n\nhad rib fractures and a bruise to her groin, which are consistent with a sexual assault.\n\n       Semen was present in the vaginal and rectal swabs taken from Mary Stachowicz. The\n\nforensic scientist working on the vaginal swab inadvertently combined the male and female\n\nsamples after they had been previously separated. As a result, no male DNA was found in the\n\nvaginal sample. Defendant could not be excluded as a contributor to the male profile from the\n\nrectal swab. Defendant's DNA was found on Mary's underwear.\n\n       Defendant's clothes containing Mary's blood were recovered from Scacchitti's van. A\n\nfolding hunting knife with a bent tip was recovered from the living room of defendant's\n\napartment. It contained both defendant's and Mary's DNA. The police also found a plastic bag\n\ncontaining blood-soaked towels and sheets in a nearby garbage can. Mary's DNA was found on\n\nthe paper towels. There were no signs of forced entry into the funeral home or into defendant's\n\napartment.\n\n                                             5. Verdict\n\n       The jury found defendant not guilty of robbery and armed robbery and guilty of burglary,\n\nmurder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and concealment of a homicidal death. Defendant\n\nwaived a jury for the eligibility and death penalty proceedings.\n\n                                           B. Sentencing\n\n       The State sought the death penalty on the basis that the killing happened during the\n\ncommission of an inherently dangerous crime. The trial court found that defendant was eligible\n\n\n                                                -12-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nto receive the death penalty on the basis of the aggravated criminal sexual assault.\n\n       During the next phase of the sentencing hearing, Sharon E. testified that in 1995, she was\n\nsix years old and living at the Larkin Center, a residential home for children in Elgin, where\n\ndefendant was also living. On Halloween, she was in the bathroom when defendant and two\n\nother boys entered. The boys put Sharon on top of the sink and defendant put his penis onto her\n\nvagina without penetrating it. Defendant stated that if she told anyone, he would kill her. She\n\ntold a staff member that two boys were \"messing\" with her, but she did not implicate defendant at\n\nthe time because she was afraid. Afterward, the staff told her she had to sleep on the couch. At\n\nnight, when she slept on the couch, defendant would stand in front of her and look at her \"crazy.\"\n\n       Linda Nordtvedt was defendant's therapist at the Larkin Center in 1995. When\n\nconfronted about the incident involving Sharon E., defendant admitted only that he exposed\n\nhimself. She observed visitations between defendant and his mother; their interactions were\n\npositive, and she found no cause for concern. Nordtvedt testified that defendant did not make\n\nmuch progress in his therapy because he only told her what he wanted her to hear and did not\n\nwork on his issues. When he was released from the Larkin Center, his prognosis was poor based\n\non behaviors he exhibited. For example, he had difficulty taking responsibility for his own\n\nactions, and he frequently ran away at the beginning of his stay there. In addition, there was an\n\nincident involving the sexual abuse of another resident. As a result, restrictions were placed on\n\ndefendant for the safety of other residents.\n\n       In 1997, defendant was transferred to the juvenile sex offender program at Uhlich\n\nChildren's Advantage Network, a residential program for children with severe behavior and\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nemotional problems. Ann Przybysz, a residential intake coordinator at Uhlich, conducted a\n\nviolence screening with defendant as part of the intake process. During the screening, defendant\n\nreported carrying a knife as a weapon, using a weapon in a fight, robbing a parent and a stranger,\n\nand forcing his sister to have sex with him. He also reported that he saw a security guard get shot\n\nand killed at a mall and saw his mother beat his sister until she bled. His mother beat him until\n\nhe was bleeding or knocked out. Further, he reported that his babysitter's friend forced him to\n\nhave sex against his will.\n\n       Francisco Monzon, who was a residential case manager in 1997, testified that defendant\n\nwas in the sexually aggressive program at Uhlich. His individual plan included no unsupervised\n\ncontact with minors. While defendant was successful in the program initially, he began to run\n\naway frequently, was found with pornography in his possession, and committed theft while he\n\nwas on the run. In September 1997, defendant, then 14, was charged with possession of lost or\n\nmislaid credit cards, which he gave to a fellow Uhlich resident. In October 1997, he was arrested\n\nfor retail theft. Monzon reported that defendant was resistant to staff and stopped making\n\nprogress in therapy. Defendant's visits with his mother were normal and did not cause Monzon\n\nany concern. Defendant was discharged from Uhlich because of his runaway behavior.\n\n       Lynda Moore, defendant's Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS)\n\ncaseworker in 1999, testified that when she first took over defendant's case, he was placed at the\n\nMill in Rockford, Illinois. The Mill was a residential placement for children with behavioral\n\nproblems, and it provided services for juvenile sex offenders. Defendant, who was 15 at the\n\ntime, lacked progress there. He was sexually inappropriate with both peers and staff, and he\n\n\n                                               -14-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nfondled another student. He also broke into the chief executive officer's office at the Mill, where\n\nhe accessed confidential student information, stole and broke items, and made long-distance\n\nphone calls. He was convicted of burglary and property damage for this incident and sentenced\n\nto 18 months' probation. He also ran away to high-risk areas, including the parking lot of a\n\nschool that developmentally challenged children attended. Defendant had fantasies about raping\n\nwomen in parking lots; once, he was found crouched between cars in a parking lot with a\n\ncrowbar. The Mill asked to have defendant removed and placed in a more restrictive\n\nenvironment because he was at \"high risk of sexual re-offense\" and he \"terrified\" the women at\n\nthe Mill.\n\n       The only placement more restrictive than the Mill is a locked facility; however, there\n\nwere none in Illinois that would accept defendant. Moore found defendant, then 16, a placement\n\nat Piney Ridge, a locked, out-of-state facility for children with psychiatric issues and juvenile\n\nsex-offender behaviors. At first, defendant did well at Piney Ridge, as he moved up the level\n\nsystem quickly and gained the trust of his therapist. However, he ran away when he was\n\nassigned the task of taking out the trash. Defendant was discharged from Piney Ridge with a\n\npoor prognosis after he engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a peer. Defendant got mad\n\nat the peer and threatened to slash his throat.\n\n       Moore found one private agency in Illinois that was willing to take defendant. Defendant\n\nwas transported to Onarga Place but was rejected because of his runaway behavior. Moore had\n\nno choice but to take defendant to a DCFS emergency shelter for the night. A couple of hours\n\nlater, he ran away, and Moore never saw him again. Moore stated that she was afraid of\n\n\n                                                  -15-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ndefendant.\n\n       Christiana Largent, defendant's younger sister, also testified in aggravation. Largent is\n\nfour years younger than defendant. For the first four years of her life, she lived with her mother\n\nand defendant. When Largent was three, her mother hung her out a window to eliminate her fear\n\nof heights. Her mother also wanted defendant to hang Largent out the window, but he refused.\n\nDuring this period of time, their mother physically abused defendant. However, their mother did\n\nnot sexually abuse her or expose her to sexual abuse. When Largent was four and defendant was\n\nnine, their mother broke a whiskey bottle over Largent's head. They were removed from their\n\nmother's home and placed in a group home called Hephzibah. Defendant was moved to another\n\nhome a week later, while Largent stayed at Hephzibah until she was 10. Largent testified that her\n\nmother tried to visit when she could. When Largent was 11, she returned to her mother's home,\n\nand in 2003, they moved to Alabama. Largent testified that, to her recollection, defendant did\n\nnot sexually abuse her before they were removed from their mother's home.\n\n       While defendant was in jail, he was charged when the entire tier was involved in a fight.\n\nDefendant stated that he was writing a letter on the top tier when the fight occurred. After a\n\nhearing, he was found guilty of fighting and was sentenced to 14 days in disciplinary segregation.\n\nIn another incident, defendant was charged with participating in a riot in the prison gym. After a\n\nhearing, defendant was found guilty and was sentenced to 29 days in segregation.\n\n       In mitigation, the parties stipulated that Dr. Paul Batty would testify that he examined\n\nSharon E. in the emergency room of St. Joseph's Hospital on November 1, 1995, and that his\n\nphysical examination revealed no signs of trauma. He would further testify that Sharon E. denied\n\n\n                                                -16-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nthat the boys touched her private parts with their hands, touched her with their private parts, or\n\nremoved her underwear.\n\n       The parties also stipulated that Melody E., Sharon E.'s mother, would testify that during\n\nher visit with Sharon after the Halloween of 1995, she stated that \"them boys touched me\" and\n\nthat she never mentioned defendant's name.\n\n       David Berg, a forensic interviewer for the Child Advocacy Center in Kane County,\n\ntestified that he interviewed Sharon E. on November 6, 1995. Sharon told him that three boys\n\npulled down her pants and touched her private part. While she named Chris, Ray, and TK, she\n\ndid not mention defendant. He testified that she was evasive and anxious and it was difficult to\n\ntalk to her. He interviewed defendant, who denied involvement but was \"overly eager\" to\n\nimplicate the other three boys.\n\n       Carol Garza testified that she was friends with Paula Largent, defendant's mother. In the\n\n1980s, Garza and Largent worked at a lounge owned by Hector Gutierrez. While Hector was\n\nmarried, he had an affair with Paula; as a result, Paula became pregnant with defendant. Shortly\n\nafter defendant was born, he and Paula lived with Garza and her family. Hector continued living\n\nwith his wife. After a year, Paula moved to an apartment building owned by Hector's parents.\n\nWhile they worked at the lounge, Carol and Paula became alcoholics and cocaine addicts. They\n\npartied three or four times a week, frequently at Paula's apartment. Defendant was at the\n\napartment sleeping while this occurred; however, he would wake up now and then. Paula would\n\nyell at defendant when he came out of his room while they were getting high. One time, Paula\n\nbackhanded defendant because he came out of his room crying, and a few other times, she\n\n\n                                                -17-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nslapped or spanked him for leaving his room or for crying. Another time, Paula strapped him to\n\nhis high chair with a belt. His bedroom door was kept locked from the outside by either a belt or\n\na clothes line while Paula and others got high. Carol also witnessed one of their drug dealers\n\nfondle defendant's crotch while he was lying on the couch wearing pajamas and a diaper.\n\nDefendant, then two or three, woke up crying. In addition, Carol saw Peto, an associate of their\n\ndrug dealer, swipe his penis across defendant's mouth while he was sleeping. When defendant\n\nwoke up, Peto took defendant to his bedroom, where they remained for 10 to 15 minutes. Carol\n\ndid not remember whether the door was open or closed or whether Peto and defendant were\n\nalone in the bedroom. At some point during the 1980s, Paula told Carol that she paid for drugs\n\nby selling defendant for sex. Carol did not do anything to stop it, nor did she tell the authorities.\n\n       Grace Gorski testified that she was friends with Ray and defendant. She loved defendant\n\nand was supportive of him. She trusted defendant and found him to be charming.\n\n       Colleen Luckey owned the jewelry store next to Flower Fantasy. She met Scacchitti in\n\n2000 and then met defendant through Scacchitti. She found defendant to be charming, pleasant,\n\nand helpful.\n\n       Sergeant Michael Hallihan testified that defendant started on the school wing in the jail\n\nand moved to the \"Christian deck,\" where chaplains held Bible readings and worked with\n\ninmates on drug-abuse or anger-management issues. A stricter set of rules applied to the\n\nChristian deck.\n\n       Valerie Scacchitti, Ray's sister, testified that before the murder, she saw defendant and\n\nRay once a week. She considered defendant family and found him to be a \"gentle soul.\"\n\n\n                                                -18-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment for first-degree murder; 30 years'\n\nimprisonment for aggravated criminal sexual assault; 7 years for burglary; and 3 for concealment\n\nof a homicidal death. Defendant's posttrial motion was denied, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              II. ANALYSIS\n\n                                 A. Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault\n\n            1. Whether the State Must Prove the Victim Was Alive at the Time of the Assault\n\n       Defendant argues that the crime of sexual assault requires that the State prove that the\n\nvictim was alive at the time of the sexual acts. He contends that his conviction for aggravated\n\ncriminal sexual assault must be reversed because the State failed to prove that Mary was alive at\n\nthe time he assaulted her.\n\n       In support of his argument, defendant cites People v. Segara, 126 Ill. 2d 70 (1988), which\n\nheld, \"To the victim, each rape was 'readily divisible and intensely personal; each offense is an\n\noffense against a person.' \" (Emphasis in original.) Segara, 126 Ill. 2d at 77, quoting Pruitt v.\n\nState, 269 Ind. 559, 565, 382 N.E.2d 150, 154 (1978). The question in that case, however, was\n\nwhether the defendant was liable for two acts of criminal sexual assault, not whether the State\n\nmust prove that the victim was alive at the time of the rape. Further, the Illinois criminal sexual\n\nassault statute does not specifically require a living victim. 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(3), 12-12(f), 12-\n\n13(a)(1), 12-14 (West 2006).\n\n       Further, People v. Hendrix, 250 Ill. App. 3d 88 (1993), refutes defendant's contention. In\n\n\n                                                -19-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nHendrix, the body of the 71-year-old victim was found 30 to 48 hours after death, and the\n\ndefendant was convicted of first-degree murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and burglary.\n\nOn appeal, the defendant argued that he was not proven guilty of aggravated criminal sexual\n\nassault because the medical examiner could not conclusively establish that any sexual assault\n\noccurred before death. This court concluded that \"we will not draw a bright line which would\n\nrequire the State in all similar cases to establish the precise time of death in order to prove a\n\nsexual assault upon a murder victim.\" Hendrix, 250 Ill. App. 3d at 103. Accordingly, the court\n\nconcluded that the State proved defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Hendrix, 250 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 103.\n\n       Hendrix relied on People v. Colley, 188 Ill. App. 3d 817 (1989). In Colley, the defendant\n\nargued that he was not proven guilty of aggravated criminal sexual assault because the victim's\n\nstab wounds occurred too long after the sexual acts were performed to be considered part of the\n\nsame course of conduct. The court noted that the evidence showed that the defendant stabbed the\n\nvictim soon after the sexual acts were completed. Colley, 188 Ill. App. 3d at 820. \"Under the\n\ninstant circumstances, we will not draw a bright line between the ending of the sexual acts and\n\nthe bodily harm occurring afterward, as that would defeat the statutory purpose of protecting\n\nvictims from sex offenders.\" Colley, 188 Ill. App. 3d at 820. The court found that the stab\n\nwounds occurred \"sufficiently close in time to the sexual acts that they can be said to have been\n\ncommitted during the course of the sexual assault.\" Colley, 188 Ill. App. 3d at 820, citing People\n\nv. Ortiz, 156 Ill. App. 3d 170 (1987).\n\n       Defendant cites cases from other jurisdictions that have held that the crime of rape\n\n\n                                                 -20-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nrequires that the victim be alive at the time of the sexual act. See Doyle v. State, 112 Nev. 879,\n\n899, 921 P.2d 901, 914 (1996), rev'd on other grounds by Kaczmarek v. State, 120 Nev. 314, 91\n\nP.3d 16 (2004); People v. Davis, 10 Cal. 4th 463, 521 n.20, 896 P.2d 119, 151 n.20, 41 Cal. Rptr.\n\n2d 826, 858 n.20 (1995); State v. Perkins, 248 Kan. 760, 771, 822 P.2d 1142, 1150 (1991); State\n\nv.

Hutner, 209 Mich. App. 280, 283-84, 530 N.W.2d 174, 176 (1995). \"These courts\n\nreason that rape must be accomplished against a person's will, and once one is dead has no will\n\nwhich can be overborne.\" Missouri v. McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d 257, 270 (Miss. 2008), citing\n\nPeople v. Sellers, 203 Cal. App. 3d 1042, 1050, 250 Cal. Rptr. 345, 350 (1988). Defendant,\n\nurging this court to follow those cases, contends that a separate criminal offense of mutilation or\n\nsexual abuse of a corpse is more appropriate than a conviction for criminal sexual assault.\n\n       We note, however, that a different panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals disagreed with\n\nHutner. People v. Diefenbach, No. 176489, slip op at 6 n.1 (Mich. App. August 20, 1996).\n\nFurther, Holt was superseded by Wisconsin's sexual assault statute (Wis. Stat. '940.225(7)\n\n(2005)), which provides, \"This section applies regardless of whether a victim is dead or alive at\n\nthe time of sexual contact or sexual intercourse.\" Similarly, Pennsylvania's \"involuntary deviate\n\nsexual intercourse\" statute now provides that the term \"forcible compulsion\" includes\n\n\"compulsion resulting in another person's death, whether the death occurred before, during or\n\nafter the sexual intercourse.\" Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. '3123(e) (2009 Supp.).\n\n       In People v. Kelly, 1 Cal. 4th 495, 822 P.2d 385, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d 677 (1992), the trial\n\n\n                                                -21-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ncourt instructed the jury, \" 'It is legally possible to rape a dead body. Where a defendant attempts\n\nto coerce his victim into intercourse with him, fails to accomplish [this] purpose while she is\n\nalive and kills her to satisfy his desires with her corpse, the killing falls within the felony murder\n\nrule.' \" (Emphasis omitted.) Kelly, 1 Cal. 4th at 524, 822 P.2d at 399, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 691.\n\nThe California Supreme Court concluded that the first sentence of the instruction was erroneous\n\nbecause rape requires a live victim. Kelly, 1 Cal. 4th at 524, 822 P.2d at 399, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d at\n\n691. \"This does not, however, mean that intercourse after death negates the felony-murder rule,\"\n\nsince felony murder includes a killing committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate,\n\nrape. Kelly, 1 Cal. 4th at 524, 822 P.2d at 399, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 691. The Kelly court held, \"\n\n'Where a defendant attempts to coerce his victim into intercourse with him, fails to accomplish\n\nhis purpose while she is alive, and kills her to satisfy his desires with her corpse, the killing is\n\nfirst degree murder.' \" Kelly, 1 Cal. 4th at 525, 822 P.2d at 400, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 692, quoting\n\nPeople v. Goodridge, 70 Cal. 2d 824, 838, 452 P.2d 637, 645, 76 Cal. Rptr. 421, 429 (1969).\n\nAccordingly, the second sentence of the instructions correctly informed the jury of the law.\n\nKelly, 1 Cal. 4th at 526, 822 P.2d at 400-01, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 692-93.\n\n        Illinois law is dispositive of this issue. In People v. Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d 500 (1990), the\n\ndefendant argued that it was not possible for the murder to occur \"in the course of\" arson because\n\nthe victim was dead at the time he started the fire. Our supreme court found that the murder and\n\narson occurred \"essentially simultaneously.\" Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d at 534. \"It is not imperative\n\nthat the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant formed the criminal intent to\n\ncommit arson or aggravated arson before committing murder.\" Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d at 534. It\n\n\n                                                 -22-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nwas sufficient that the State proved the elements of the crimes and the accompanying felonies\n\nwere part of the \"same criminal episode.\" Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d at 534.\n\n        Thomas declined to adopt the California Supreme Court's reasoning in People v. Morris,\n\n46 Cal. 3d 1, 756 P.2d 843, 249 Cal. Rptr. 119 (1988), and People v. Green, 27 Cal. 3d 1, 609\n\nP.2d 468, 164 Cal. Rptr. 1 (1980), which determined that its capital punishment statute is\n\ninapplicable when the felony that accompanies the murder is \" 'merely incidental to the murder.' \"\n\nThomas, 137 Ill. 2d at 534, quoting Green, 27 Cal. 3d at 61, 609 P.2d at 505, 164 Cal. Rptr. at\n\n38. Thomas found that the language of the California statute is different from Illinois's statutes\n\nbecause it permits the imposition of the death penalty when the jury concluded that the defendant\n\ncommitted murder \" 'during the commission or attempted commission of' \" several enumerated\n\nfelonies. Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d at 534, quoting Green, 27 Cal. 3d at 59, 609 P.2d at 504, 164 Cal.\n\nRptr. at 37. This language contemplates a shorter time frame than does the \" 'in the course of' \"\n\nlanguage found in the Illinois statute. Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d at 535, quoting Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch.\n\n38, par. 9-1(b)(6). \"That is, we think that the Illinois statute recognizes that the crime of murder\n\nis not necessarily complete when the victim's heart stops beating, but rather the crime continues\n\nthrough the time that the perpetrator conceals the crime and flees the scene.\" Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d\n\nat 535. \"The statute imparts no significance to the precise timing of the *** various felonies\n\ndefendant commits.\" Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d at 535. Accordingly, the court concluded that a\n\ndefendant is eligible for the death penalty if he commits murder and one of the specifically\n\nenumerated felonies either simultaneously or as part of the same criminal episode. Thomas, 137\n\nIll. 2d at 535.\n\n\n                                                -23-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       Other Illinois cases have ruled similarly to Thomas. For example, in People v.\n\nRichardson, 123 Ill. 2d 322 (1988), our supreme court addressed the applicability of the death\n\npenalty if the murder was committed \"in the course of\" an armed robbery. Richardson, 123 Ill.\n\n2d at 359, citing Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 38, par. 9-1(b)(6)©). The defendant announced a\n\nrobbery as he fired the first shot, then rifled through the cash register before he left the store. The\n\ncourt rejected the defendant's argument that the shooting was not committed \"in the course\" of\n\nthe armed robbery because the shooting took place before the robbery began. The court held that\n\n\"[j]ust as the phrase 'in the course of' does not require that defendant complete one of the other\n\nfelonies in order to be eligible for the death sentence [citation], we also believe that it does not\n\nrequire that the armed robbery commence prior to the fatal gunshot.\" Richardson, 123 Ill. 2d at\n\n359. The court continued, \"[T]he precise timing of the offenses is not necessarily indicative of\n\ndefendant's intent. The jury concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed both\n\na murder and an armed robbery, which offenses occurred essentially simultaneously.\"\n\nRichardson, 123 Ill. 2d at 359.

Ramirez, 98\n\nIll. 2d 439 (1983) (all involving felony murder based on armed robbery). Our courts have\n\napplied the same reasoning to home invasion (People v. Sample, 326 Ill. App. 3d 914 (2001)),\n\nmurder \"in the course of\" burglary (People v. Pitsonbarger, 142 Ill. 2d 353 (1990)), and murder\n\n\"in the course of\" aggravated kidnapping (People v. Nitz, 143 Ill. 2d 82 (1991)).\n\n       Here, defendant committed both murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault, and these\n\ncrimes occurred \"essentially simultaneously.\" It was sufficient that the State proved the elements\n\n\n                                                 -24-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nof the crimes were part of the \"same criminal episode.\" Thomas, 137 Ill. 2d at 534. \"To parse\n\nthe crimes out into bounded acts would contradict the reality that these crimes were intertwined\n\nboth temporally and functionally.\" Sample, 326 Ill. App. 3d at 928.\n\n        These cases, as well as Hendrix, are consistent with the majority of jurisdictions, which\n\nhave adopted the \"ongoing criminal assault rule.\" For example, in McLaughlin, the defendant\n\nargued that he was not guilty of rape because he raped the victim after he stabbed her. Noting\n\nthat Missouri's rape statute did not expressly address whether the victim must be alive at the time\n\nof penetration, the court, like \"the majority of jurisdictions to address this issue,\" adopted the\n\n\"ongoing criminal assault\" rule. McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d at 268. \"Under that rule, where the\n\nforcible compulsion that leads to the rape begins before the death of the victim, the defendant is\n\nguilty of rape even if the jury believes defendant killed the victim before penetration or before\n\nthe sexual assault was concluded.\" McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d at 268. The court noted important\n\npolicy reasons why the death of the victim during the assault should not preclude a conviction for\n\nrape:\n\n        \" 'We are likewise unable to embrace the notion that the fortuitous circumstance,\n\n        for the rapist, that death may have preceded penetration by an instant, negates\n\n        commission of the crime of aggravated rape and reduces it to a relatively minor\n\n        offense associated with erotic attraction to dead bodies. Reading the \"live only\"\n\n        requirement into the statute encourages rapists to kill their victims, in our\n\n        opinion.' \" (Emphasis in original.) McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d at 268-69, quoting\n\n        State v. Brobeck, 751 S.W.2d 828, 832 (Tenn. 1988).\n\n\n                                                 -25-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nAccordingly, the court concluded:\n\n       \"It is rape where defendant both kills and sexually assaults a victim in a single,\n\n       continuous act, or in a series or closely related acts, and where, as part of the\n\n       course of conduct, defendant uses forcible compulsion against the victim, even if\n\n       portions of the rape, including penetration, occur once the victim has already been\n\n       killed.\" McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d at 269.\n\nSee also State v.

Collins, 66\n\nOhio App. 3d at 443, 585 N.E.2d at 536; Lipham, 257 Ga. at 810, 364 S.E.2d at 842-43. Even\n\n\n                                                -26-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nassuming that defendant killed Mary first and then raped her, it is illogical to assume that he\n\nkilled her, waited around for a while as she bled profusely on his apartment floor, and then\n\nraped her.\n\n       Illinois has been following the majority of jurisdictions to address the ongoing criminal\n\nassault rule, as exemplified by Illinois cases involving other crimes. Pursuant to Hendrix and\n\nthe Richardson line of cases, we hold that the State was not required to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Mary was alive at the time defendant sexually assaulted her since the\n\nmurder and sexual assault occurred \"essentially simultaneously.\"\n\n                                  2. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Even assuming that the State was required to prove that Mary was alive at the time of the\n\nsexual assault, we would find that it proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she was alive at the\n\ntime of the assault. A person commits criminal sexual assault if he \"commits an act of sexual\n\npenetration by the use of force or threat of force.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-13(a)(1) (West 2006).\n\n\"Sexual penetration\" is defined as follows:\n\n               \"any contact, however slight, between the sex organ or anus of one person\n\n       by an object, the sex organ, mouth or anus of another person, or any intrusion,\n\n       however slight, of any part of the body of one person *** into the sex organ or\n\n       anus of another person, including but not limited to *** anal penetration.\n\n       Evidence of emission of semen is not required to prove sexual penetration.\" 720\n\n       ILCS 5/12-12(f) (West 2006).\n\nFurther, a person commits aggravated criminal sexual assault if he commits criminal sexual\n\n\n                                               -27-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nassault and: uses a dangerous weapon, causes bodily harm to the victim, acts in such a manner\n\nas to threaten or endanger the life of the victim, or perpetrates the sexual assault during the\n\ncourse of the commission of any other felony. 720 ILCS 5/12-14(a)(1) through (4) (West 2006).\n\n       When a court considers a challenge to a criminal conviction based on the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence, its function is not to retry the defendant. People v. Milka, 211 Ill. 2d 150, 178\n\n(2004). Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Woods, 214 Ill. 2d 455, 470 (2005). Under this\n\nstandard, a reviewing court must draw all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of the\n\nprosecution. People v. Bush, 214 Ill. 2d 318, 326 (2005). A court of review will not overturn\n\nthe fact finder's verdict unless \"the proof is so improbable or unsatisfactory that there exists a\n\nreasonable doubt of the defendant=s guilt.\" People v. Maggette, 195 Ill. 2d 336, 353 (2001).\n\n       Defendant's semen was present in Stachowicz's underwear, and he could not be excluded\n\nas a contributor to the male profile from the rectal swab. The vaginal swab showed the presence\n\nof sperm, and while there was a mistake with that sample, Mary's husband testified that they last\n\nhad sex a week before her death. In addition, the side zipper on her pants was not zipped, which\n\nsuggested that she did not dress herself. The evidence also showed that defendant used force\n\nduring the sexual assault. See 720 ILCS 5/12-13(a)(1) (West 2006). Mary was stabbed 11\n\ntimes in her head and neck. She was strangled, 10 of her ribs were fractured, and there were\n\nabrasions on her arms and elbows. The medical examiner testified that her rib fractures and the\n\nbruise to her groin were consistent with a sexual assault.\n\n\n                                                -28-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       Defendant nevertheless claims that his conviction should be reversed because there was\n\nno proof that Mary was alive when he raped her. Defendant contends that Mary must have been\n\ndead when he raped her because there was no evidence of vaginal or rectal tearing or bruising,\n\nher clothing was not torn, and he confessed to the murder but not to a sexual assault.\n\nWhile there was no evidence of injuries to Mary's vagina or rectum, the medical examiner\n\ntestified that sexual assault can occur without any injuries to the body. Further, Mary gave birth\n\nfour times, and each time a woman gives birth, the elasticity of the vagina is reduced, which, in\n\nturn, makes vaginal injuries less likely. See People v. Shum, 117 Ill. 2d 317, 356 (1987)\n\n(medical evidence is not required to prove rape).\n\n       More important, there would have been no need for defendant to compress Mary's torso\n\nand break 10 of her ribs had she not been alive and struggling. In People v. Fisher, 169 Ill. App.\n\n3d 915 (1988), blood was found on the victim's pubic hair, and her bra was damaged, as if it had\n\nbeen forcibly removed. There was no evidence of injury to her breasts or genitalia, but there\n\nwas blood on the defendant's underwear. The defendant was convicted of murder and attempted\n\nrape. On appeal, the defendant argued that his attempted rape conviction should be reversed\n\nbecause the victim was dead when he attempted to rape her. This court rejected the defendant's\n\nargument, finding that \"if the victim was dead at the time of the attempted rape there would\n\nhave been no need to engage in a violent struggle to disrobe and bind her.\" Fisher, 169 Ill. App.\n\n3d at 922. As in Fisher, if Mary was dead when defendant sexually assaulted her, he would not\n\nhave needed to compress her torso and break 10 of her ribs.\n\n                                       3. Jury Instruction\n\n\n                                               -29-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       Defendant next argues that, assuming the evidence was sufficient to show Mary was\n\nalive at the time of the sexual assault, the trial court erred in refusing defense counsel's\n\ninstruction on this point. Defendant sought to have the jury instructed as follows: \"When\n\nconsidering the charges involving sexual acts, you may not convict the defendant of Aggravated\n\nCriminal Sexual Assault or any murder charges referencing Aggravated Criminal Sexual\n\nAssault if you believe from the evidence that the sexual acts occurred after the death of Mary\n\nStachowicz.\"\n\n       The purpose of a jury instruction is to \" ' \"convey to the minds of the jury the correct\n\nprinciples of law applicable to the evidence submitted to it.\" ' \" People v. Harris, 225 Ill. 2d 1,\n\n43 (2007), quoting People v. Salazar, 126 Ill. 2d 424, 464 (1988), quoting People v. Gambony,\n\n402 Ill. 72 (1948). Further, Supreme Court Rule 451(a) (210 Ill. 2d R. 451(a)) provides that\n\nwhenever the pattern jury instructions contain an instruction applicable in a criminal case and\n\nthe court determines that the jury should be instructed on the subject, the pattern instruction\n\nshall be used, unless the court determines that it does not accurately state the law. 210 Ill. 2d R.\n\n451(a); Harris, 225 Ill. 2d at 43. An appellate court applies an abuse-of-discretion standard\n\nwhen reviewing a trial court's decisions relating to instructions. People v. Roberts, 351 Ill. App.\n\n3d 684, 690 (2004).\n\n       There is no dispute that the jury was properly instructed as to aggravated criminal sexual\n\nassault. The court gave the jury Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Criminal, Nos. 7.01, 7.02,\n\n11.57, 11.58, 11.65, 11.65C, 11.65E, and 11.65F (4th ed. 2000), which adequately informed the\n\njury of the definitions and elements of felony murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault.\n\n\n                                                 -30-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nTherefore, under Supreme Court Rule 451(a), the instructions were sufficient. While defendant\n\ncontends that these instructions do not specify whether sexual acts committed on a deceased\n\nperson qualify as criminal sexual assault, we found above that the State was not required to\n\nprove that Mary was alive at the time of the sexual assault.\n\n                                           B. Burglary\n\n                                  1. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       A person commits burglary \"when without authority he knowingly enters or without\n\nauthority remains within a building ***, or any part thereof, with intent to commit therein a\n\nfelony or theft.\" 720 ILCS 5/19-1(a) (West 2006). Defendant contends that because the\n\nevidence showed that he had unlimited authority to be in the funeral home, the State failed to\n\nprove a lack of authority, as the statute requires. Defendant cites the testimony of Francine\n\nSikorski that on November 13, 2002, defendant still had the keys to the funeral home and had\n\nthe authority to be anywhere within the funeral home. Therefore, defendant argues, he had\n\nunlimited authority to be inside the funeral home. See People v. Reid, 179 Ill. 2d 297, 316-17\n\n(1997); People v. Taylor, 318 Ill. App. 3d 464, 473 (2000) (reversing home invasion conviction\n\nwhere defendant was an overnight guest at the apartment); People v. Moulton, 282 Ill. App. 3d\n\n102 (1996) (reversing conviction for home invasion where defendant was joint tenant of the\n\ndwelling).\n\n       We note, however, that Sikorski's testimony was impeached by her admission that she\n\n\"might\" have told the police the night of the murder that she had fired defendant and Scacchitti,\n\nand other evidence was presented showing that she had fired the two men. Scacchitti also\n\n\n                                               -31-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ntestified that he and defendant had been fired and no longer entered the funeral home. We find\n\nthat this conflicting testimony on the issue of authority was one for the jury to decide.\n\n       Furthermore, Sikorski's testimony is insufficient to allow defendant to escape the\n\nparameters of the limited authority doctrine. The limited authority doctrine \"states that authority\n\nto enter a building for a specific lawful purpose is vitiated when the wrongdoer departs from\n\nthat purpose and commits a felony or theft.\" People v. Wilson, 155 Ill. 2d 374, 376 (1993). This\n\nis because if the entrant's intent to commit criminal acts therein had been \"communicated to the\n\nowner at the time of entry, it would have resulted in the individual's being barred from the\n\npremises ab initio.\" People v. Bush, 157 Ill. 2d 248, 253-54 (1993).\n\n       In People v. Woolsey, 24 Ill. App. 3d 1079 (1975), the defendant, using a key given to\n\nhim by his employer, entered his place of employment after working hours and took materials\n\ntherefrom. The court affirmed the defendant's conviction for burglary and rejected his argument\n\nthat he had authority to enter the building: \" 'While unlimited consent to enter is always a\n\ndefense against a charge of burglary ***, a consent limited as to place, time, or purpose is not a\n\ndefense where entry occurs outside the limitations stated or implied.' \" Woolsey, 24 Ill. App. 3d\n\nat 1082, quoting Annot., 93 A.L.R.2d 531, 537 (1964). The evidence supported the conclusion\n\nthat the defendant's authority to enter the building was limited to those occasions necessary to\n\nfurther the employer's activities. Woolsey, 24 Ill. App. 3d at 1082-83. Similarly, here,\n\nSikorski's testimony could not support an acquittal on the basis that defendant had authority to\n\nenter or remain in the funeral home because any consent that may have been given was vitiated\n\nby defendant's series of criminal activities. The fact that defendant once worked at the funeral\n\n\n                                                -32-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nhome and sometimes used the door to the public business did not provide a blanket consent\n\nbecause whatever consent that remained was insufficient to excuse his unauthorized entry or\n\nremaining for the purposes of committing a theft.\n\n       Defendant, citing People v. Meeker, 86 Ill. App. 3d 162 (1980), and People v. Baker, 59\n\nIll. App. 3d 100 (1978), contends that the limited authority doctrine does not apply to this case.\n\nHowever, Baker and Meeker are distinguishable on the basis that no evidence was presented to\n\nshow the defendants' unauthorized entry in those cases. Here, on the other hand, the State\n\npresented evidence that defendant no longer worked at the funeral home, that the funeral home\n\nwas not open to the public, and that the funeral home remained locked at all times except during\n\nvisitations. In addition, defendant lived in an apartment above the funeral home, with a separate\n\naccess door, not within the funeral home. Further, Scacchitti testified that he and defendant had\n\nbeen fired and no longer entered the funeral home.\n\n                                       2. Jury Instruction\n\n       Defendant argues that if this court finds the evidence sufficient to support his burglary\n\nconviction, it should still remand for retrial on that charge because an erroneous burglary\n\ninstruction was given to the jury. Defendant was charged with one count of burglary based on\n\nan unlawful entry into the funeral home and predicated on an intent to commit theft. However,\n\nthe jury was instructed that defendant was guilty of burglary if he \"without authority remain[ed]\n\nwithin\" the funeral home \"with intent to commit therein the offense of theft or concealment of a\n\nhomicidal death.\" Defendant contends that this instruction constructively amended the\n\nindictment because it changed the method of committing the burglary and broadened the\n\n\n                                               -33-\n\f1-07-2516\n\npossible mental states. He maintains that his fifth amendment rights have been violated, since\n\n\"a person's right to notice of a charge and an opportunity to mount a defense in court is basic to\n\nour system of jurisprudence.\"\n\n          The State contends that defendant waived this argument. At trial, defendant objected to\n\nthe State's burglary instruction only on the basis of the limited authority doctrine, not because it\n\nbroadened the indictment. See People v. Eyler, 133 Ill. 2d 173, 219 (1989) (specific objections\n\nwaive all grounds not specified). Further, he did not raise this specific issue in his posttrial\n\nmotion. To preserve a question for appellate review, both a trial objection and a written\n\nposttrial motion raising the issue are required. People v. Pinkney, 322 Ill. App. 3d 707, 715\n\n(2000).\n\n          The doctrine of plain error serves as a \" 'narrow and limited exception' \" to the general\n\nrule of procedural default. People v. Szabo, 113 Ill. 2d 83, 94 (1986), quoting People v.\n\nPastorino, 91 Ill. 2d 178, 188 (1982); 134 Ill. 2d R. 615(a). The plain-error doctrine bypasses\n\nnormal forfeiture principles and allows a reviewing court to review an unpreserved error when\n\neither (1) the evidence is close, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) the error is\n\nserious, regardless of the closeness of the evidence. People v. Herron, 215 Ill. 2d 167, 186-87\n\n(2005). Under the first prong, \"the defendant must prove 'prejudicial error.' That is, the\n\ndefendant must show *** that the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened\n\nto tip the scales of justice against him.\" Herron, 215 Ill. 2d at 187. Under the second prong,\n\n\"the defendant must prove that there was plain error and that the error was so serious that it\n\naffected the fairness of the defendant’s trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process.\"\n\n\n                                                  -34-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nHerron, 215 Ill. 2d at 187. \"In both instances, the burden of persuasion remains with the\n\ndefendant.\" Herron, 215 Ill. 2d at 187. Defendant contends that both prongs of the plain-error\n\nrule apply because the evidence of burglary was closely balanced and he was convicted based on\n\na theory of burglary that was never presented to the grand jury.\n\n       We agree with the State that the evidence of burglary, discussed above, was\n\noverwhelming. Defendant had been fired from the funeral home, he and Ray had a fight that\n\nmorning about defendant's life path, defendant admitted that he planned to take money and\n\nanything valuable from Ray and the funeral home to buy a ticket to Las Vegas, and he entered\n\nthe funeral home and took money from Mary's purse.\n\n       As for the second prong of the plain-error rule, both the United States and Illinois\n\nconstitutions provide a criminal defendant with the fundamental right to be informed of the\n\nnature and cause of the charges against him. People v. Likar, 329 Ill. App. 3d 654, 660 (2002),\n\nciting U.S. Const., amend. VI; Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, '8. \"When the sufficiency of a charging\n\ninstrument is challenged for the first time on appeal, this court is called upon to determine\n\nwhether the charging instrument apprised the defendant of the precise offense charged with\n\nenough specificity to allow preparation of his defense and to allow pleading of the judgment as a\n\nbar to future prosecution arising out of the same conduct.\" Likar, 329 Ill. App. 3d at 660. In the\n\ninstant case, the indictment sufficiently apprised defendant of the offense charged with enough\n\nspecificity to allow preparation of his defense and to plead the judgment as a bar to future\n\nprosecution for the same conduct.\n\n                                            C. Batson\n\n\n                                               -35-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       Defendant next argues that the trial court erred in determining that he failed to show a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106\n\nS. Ct. 1712 (1986), in the State's use of peremptory challenges to exclude four African\n\nAmerican venirepersons.\n\n       Jury selection took place over two days; the parties each had 14 peremptory challenges,\n\nand on each day, 28 prospective jurors were questioned. On the first day, the State exercised\n\nperemptory challenges against three venirepersons: Susan Farese, who was Caucasian, and Juan\n\nMunoz and Judith McCain Brown, whose races are not known. On the second day, the State\n\nexercised peremptory challenges against three African American venirepersons: Patricia\n\nWilkerson, Robert Joyner, and Richard Monroe. After the jury was seated, the State exercised a\n\nperemptory challenge against a potential venireperson for one of the four alternate positions,\n\nClifford Haywood, an African American.\n\n       Defense counsel made a Batson challenge. The assistant State's Attorney argued that\n\ndefendant failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination because defendant is Hispanic and\n\nCaucasian, there were no African American attorneys or witnesses in the case, and the defense\n\nhad used its six previous peremptory challenges against Caucasians. The court noted that \"by\n\nmy count there are four African Americans, one Hispanic, and I believe there are two of Asian\n\ndescent.\" The court denied the Batson motion, concluding, \"I think *** you're looking at what\n\nwe are doing today, not the entire jury selection process.\" In its response to defendant's motion\n\nfor new trial, the State represented that the final jury consisted of six Caucasians, four African\n\nAmericans, one Hispanic, and one Asian American.\n\n\n                                                -36-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       In Batson, the United States Supreme Court \"held that in a criminal case the fourteenth\n\namendment=s equal protection clause prohibits the State from using a peremptory challenge to\n\nexclude a prospective juror based solely on the basis of his or her race.\" People v. Macias, 371\n\nIll. App. 3d 632, 645 (2007). The Batson Court established a three-step process for evaluating\n\nclaims of discrimination in jury selection. The defendant must first make a prima facie case\n\nshowing that the State exercised its peremptory challenges on the basis of race. People v.\n\nEasley, 192 Ill. 2d 307, 323 (2000). If the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden\n\nshifts to the State to articulate a race-neutral reason for excusing the venireperson. Easley, 192\n\nIll. 2d at 323-24. When the State has articulated its reasons for excusing the venirepersons, the\n\ntrial court determines whether the defendant has satisfied his burden of establishing purposeful\n\ndiscrimination. Easley, 192 Ill. 2d at 324.\n\n       \"It is settled that a Batson prima facie case cannot be established merely by the numbers\n\nof black venirepersons stricken by the State.\" People v. Peeples, 155 Ill. 2d 422, 469 (1993).\n\nRather, the issue is whether, in consideration of \"all relevant circumstances,\" a prima facie case\n\nof discrimination has been established. People v. Coulter, 230 Ill. App. 3d 209, 222 (1992).\n\n\"Relevant circumstances\" include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) racial identity\n\nbetween the defendant and the excluded venirepersons, (2) a pattern of strikes against African\n\nAmerican venire members, (3) disproportionate use of strikes against such members, (4) the\n\nlevel of African American representation in the venire as compared to the jury, (5) prosecutorial\n\nquestions and statements during voir dire and while exercising challenges, (6) whether the\n\nexcluded venirepersons were a heterogeneous group sharing race as their only common\n\n\n                                               -37-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ncharacteristic, and (7) the races of the defendant, victim, and witnesses. People v. Williams, 173\n\nIll. 2d 48, 71 (1996). The trial court's determination as to whether a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination has been shown will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence. Williams, 173 Ill. 2d at 71.\n\n       The first relevant circumstance is whether defendant and the excluded venirepersons\n\nshare the same race. Here, there is no racial identity between defendant and the stricken jurors.\n\nDefendant is Caucasian and Hispanic, while the excluded jurors are African American.\n\nAlthough this factor is relevant, it is not dispositive in determining whether a prima facie case\n\nexists. Williams, 173 Ill. 2d at 72.\n\n       The next relevant circumstance is whether the State used a disproportionate number of\n\nperemptory challenges to exclude African Americans. Four of the seven panel members struck\n\nby the State were African American. In People v. Hughes, 257 Ill. App. 3d 633 (1993), and\n\nPeople v. Nicholson, 218 Ill. App. 3d 273, 283 (1991), the use of five out of seven strikes\n\nagainst African Americans constituted a pattern of strikes. Defendant also cites cases where the\n\nState's use of five of six peremptory challenges against African Americans constituted a pattern\n\nof strikes. These cases are distinguishable, however, where the State in those cases used all but\n\none of its strikes on African Americans versus just over half here. See People v. Nicholson, 218\n\nIll. App. 3d 273, 283 (1991); People v. Lockhart, 201 Ill. App. 3d 700, 710 (1990).\n\n       Next, it must be determined whether there was a pattern of strikes against African\n\nAmerican venire members. This inquiry is different from the question of whether the State used\n\na disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude African Americans. While the\n\n\n                                               -38-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nproportionality analysis compares the number of peremptories used against African Americans\n\nversus the number used against Caucasians, the pattern analysis compares the number of African\n\nAmericans that could have been, but were not, struck by the State. People v. Lann, 261 Ill. App.\n\n3d 456, 463 (1994). Before exercising peremptory challenges against Wilkerson, Joyner,\n\nMonroe, and Haywood, the State had accepted two panels that included four African Americans.\n\nOur supreme court has previously found that when a Batson claim is made regarding\n\ndiscrimination against a particular race, the unchallenged presence of jurors of that race on the\n\nseated jury tends to weaken the basis for a prima facie case of discrimination. People v. Rivera,\n\n221 Ill. 2d 481, 513 (2006).\n\n       The fourth factor is the level of African American representation in the venire as\n\ncompared to the jury. We first note a discrepancy in the record as to the racial makeup of the\n\nfinal jury. The trial court stated that the final jury consisted of four African Americans, one\n\nHispanic, and two Asians. In its response to defendant's motion for new trial, the State claimed\n\nthat the jury consisted of six Caucasians, four African Americans, one Hispanic, and one Asian\n\nAmerican; on appeal, the parties continue to cite these numbers. Even applying the proportions\n\ncited by the parties on appeal, however, we still find that the empaneled jury had higher\n\npercentage of African Americans than the venire.\n\n       Excluding those venirepersons excused for cause (People v. Evans, 125 Ill. 2d 50, 65\n\n(1988)), the venire contained 39 prospective jurors. Of those 39, 21 were Caucasian (53.8 %);\n\n11 were African American (28.2 %); 6 were Hispanic (15.4 %); and 1 was Asian American (2.6\n\n%). According to the parties, the final 12-person jury consisted of 6 Caucasians (50 %); 4\n\n\n                                               -39-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nAfrican Americans (33.3 %); 1 Hispanic (8.3 %); and 1 Asian American (8.3 %). Thus, a larger\n\npercentage of African Americans served on the jury than were present in the venire. See Evans,\n\n125 Ill. 2d at 65 (empaneled jury had higher percentage of African Americans than the venire).\n\n       This court must also analyze questions and statements made during he prosecutor during\n\nvoir dire and while exercising challenges. Defendant does not allege, and the record does not\n\nindicate, that the assistant State's Attorneys' statements or questions to the jury were racially\n\nmotivated.\n\n       Another factor that has been taken into consideration in determining whether a defendant\n\nhas presented a prima facie case is the race of the defendant, the victim, and the witnesses.\n\nWilliams, 173 Ill. 2d at 71. The victim was Caucasian, and defendant is Caucasian and\n\nHispanic. The attorneys were Caucasian, and the witnesses were Caucasian, African American,\n\nHispanic, and Asian. There were no racial overtones in the case. See Evans, 125 Ill. 2d at 65-\n\n66 (any racial issue inherent in the selection of the jury was minimal where the case did not\n\ninvolve \"an interracial crime in which specific racial groups would be prone to take sides of\n\nprejudice\").\n\n       The final relevant circumstance is whether the excluded venirepersons were a\n\nheterogeneous group sharing race as their only common characteristic. Defendant claims that\n\nthe four stricken jurors shared race as their only common characteristic, as one was widowed,\n\none was married, one was single, and one had a domestic partner; two had been victims of\n\nproperty offenses, while two had not been victims of any crimes; and \"they each had different\n\nkids of jobs and interests.\" Defendant also compares the four stricken jurors= qualifications to\n\n\n                                                -40-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nthose of the seated jurors; he claims that Joyner was similar to Anthony Magnifico, a seated\n\njuror, because both were married with children, worked as skilled laborers, and had been a\n\nvictim or married to a victim of a property offense for which no one was arrested. He compares\n\nJoyner and Monroe, who had food-service experience, to seated juror Loretta Jackson, who was\n\nstudying to be a chef. However, three of the four stricken jurors had children, none had been\n\nconvicted of a crimes, and both Joyner and Haywood were in security-type jobs without formal\n\nlaw enforcement training.\n\n       While defendant makes much of the fact that the State used its final four challenges\n\nagainst African Americans, he cites no case law holding that this pattern suggests\n\ndiscrimination. In addition, it is well established that the court must consider \"the totality of the\n\nrelevant facts\" and \"all relevant circumstances\" surrounding the strikes. People v. Davis, 231\n\nIll. 2d 349, 360 (2008). Thus, it was proper for the trial court to consider the entire jury\n\nselection process, not only, as the trial court noted, \"what we are doing today.\" Further, the\n\nState argued in response to defendant's Batson challenge at trial that defendant used 13 of his 16\n\nperemptory challenges to strike Caucasians, and after the eleventh juror was accepted, defendant\n\nstruck 10 Caucasians.\n\n       Defendant also argues that the trial court used the incorrect standard in ruling on his\n\nBatson motion. He contends that the trial court made a conclusory determination that no\n\ndiscrimination had occurred without first considering whether he had presented a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination. He cites People v. Hogan, 389 Ill. App. 3d 91 (2009), which concluded\n\nthat the trial court did not follow the three-step procedure delineated by Batson as to the\n\n\n                                                -41-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ndefendant's first Batson motion where it failed to ask the defendant to make a prima facie\n\nshowing before making a judicial determination. Hogan, 389 Ill. App. 3d at 101. Unlike the\n\ndefendant in Hogan, defendant in the instant case first argued that a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination was established because he was a minority, the last four peremptory challenges\n\nused by the State were against minorities, and there was nothing in their backgrounds that\n\ndistinguished them from the seated jurors. The State responded that a prima facie case had not\n\nbeen established because defendant was not a minority, the State did not engage in a pattern of\n\nstrikes against African Americans, and the last six jurors struck by defendant were Caucasian.\n\nThe trial court analyzed the \"entire jury selection process\" and denied the motion. Therefore,\n\nthe trial court did not collapse the three-step Batson procedure.\n\n                                        D. State's Closing\n\n       Next, defendant argues that he was denied a fair and impartial trial by the State's closing\n\narguments, which argued facts not in evidence, urged the jury to reach a verdict out of outrage,\n\nand disparaged defendant and his counsel. He contends that the cumulative effect of the\n\nprosecutor's improper comments requires reversal of his convictions.\n\n       \"[D]efendant faces a substantial burden in attempting to achieve reversal [of his\n\nconviction] based upon improper remarks made during closing argument.\" People v. Williams,\n\n332 Ill. App. 3d 254, 266 (2002). Prosecutors enjoy wide latitude in closing arguments. People\n\nv. Caffey, 205 Ill. 2d 52, 131 (2001). In reviewing comments made at closing arguments, this\n\ncourt asks whether they \"engender substantial prejudice against a defendant such that it is\n\nimpossible to say whether or not a verdict of guilt resulted from them.\" People v. Wheeler, 226\n\n\n                                               -42-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nIll. 2d 92, 123 (2007). A reviewing court will not reverse a jury=s verdict based on improper\n\nremarks made during closing arguments unless the comments resulted in substantial prejudice to\n\nthe defendant and constituted a material factor in his conviction. People v. Brooks, 345 Ill. App.\n\n3d 945, 951 (2004).\n\n       Defendant contends that the State engaged in speculation and misstated evidence when it\n\nargued: (1) that Mary was washing dishes when she caught defendant going through her purse,\n\n(2) that she threatened to call the police; (3) that he grabbed her and dragged her upstairs, and\n\n(4) that Sikorski removed any evidence of a struggle by cleaning the funeral home. \"To be\n\nproper, closing argument comments on evidence must be either proved by direct evidence or be\n\na fair and reasonable inference from the facts and circumstances proven.\" People v. Hood, 229\n\nIll. App. 3d 202, 218 (1992).\n\n       The argument that defendant was caught going through Mary's purse was supported by\n\nseveral facts, including that money was missing from her purse, that defendant admitted taking\n\nmoney from her purse, and that her purse was in an area where cash was hidden inside the\n\nfuneral home. The evidence also supported the argument that Mary was washing dishes when\n\nsomething interrupted her, as Sikorski testified that there was a clean dish and a dish towel on\n\nthe table near Mary's jacket and purse.\n\n       The State further responds that the argument that defendant grabbed Mary and dragged\n\nher upstairs after she threatened to call the police was based on defendant's fictional account of\n\ntwo Hispanic men trying to burglarize his apartment, portions of which were truthful if\n\n\"defendant's name [is] inserted into that story.\" For example, defendant told Detective\n\n\n                                                -43-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nMcDonald that he believed the two men climbed up the garage and entered his apartment\n\nthrough the rear window. Defendant stated that Mary probably heard them as they moved the\n\nsafe and threatened to call the police. The offenders, according to defendant's fictional account,\n\nprobably left the apartment, grabbed Mary, and dragged her back to the apartment, where they\n\nbeat her to death when she violently fought back. Defendant also eventually admitted to\n\nDetective Rutherford that he grabbed Mary by her hair and dragged her into the apartment.\n\nSimilarly, the prosecutor's \"desperate inference\" that there were scuff marks based on a\n\nphotograph of the staircase leading to defendant's apartment was supported by defendant's story\n\nthat the two Hispanic men dragged Mary up the stairs; the photo showing black marks on the\n\nstaircase; and defendant's admission that he \"dragged\" Mary into his apartment.\n\n       As for defendant's contention that the prosecutor speculated as to why Mary had to have\n\nbeen brought upstairs to be killed, we note that, in his \"fictional\" account, defendant stated that\n\nthe Hispanic men brought Mary upstairs to avoid getting blood on the funeral-home carpet. In\n\naddition, the front doors are made of glass and face a busy road and a church; the crime was\n\ncommitted in broad daylight; and a funeral, for which clothes were being dropped off, was\n\nscheduled for the next day. Furthermore, the argument in rebuttal that Sikorski removed\n\nevidence of a struggle in the funeral home could be construed as a response to defendant's\n\nclosing argument that \"there wasn't one speck of evidence to even suggest that a struggle took\n\nplace anywhere on the first floor of that funeral home.\" The State noted that the funeral home\n\nwas going to be used for a wake the next day, and \"Don't you think Francine is going to clean\n\nthat funeral home?\" In his confession, defendant said he used three rolls of paper towels to\n\n\n                                                -44-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nclean up the victim's blood, put three plastic bags over her head, and wrapped her body in a\n\nsheet to staunch the flow of her blood.\n\n       Finally, defendant contends that the State ignored uncontested evidence when it argued\n\nthat the struggle occurred in the kitchen. However, defendant himself admitted in one of his\n\nstatements that part of the struggle occurred in the kitchen. Furthermore, Mary had injuries to\n\nher elbows consistent with friction with a hard surface, and it is reasonable to assume that if\n\ndefendant had raped and stabbed Mary in the den, there would have been more blood on the\n\nfurniture, boxes, and rug.\n\n       Defendant argues that the State ignored the \"one account of events\" that was in\n\nevidence--i.e., defendant's videotaped statement--and created a scenario that was unsupported,\n\nor even contradicted by, the trial evidence. However, the jury was not required to believe the\n\nentirety of defendant's videotaped statement, especially when defendant previously lied to the\n\npolice and the evidence contradicts his statement. See People v. Washington, 375 Ill. App. 3d\n\n243, 259 (2007).\n\n       Defendant also argues that the State urged the jury to reach a verdict out of outrage when\n\nit repeatedly disparaged defendant and defense counsel. See People v. Blue, 189 Ill. 2d 99, 129-\n\n30 (2000); People v. Hope, 116 Ill. 2d 265, 278 (1986). For example, the prosecutor twice\n\nasked the jury to consider what was going through the minds of Mary's family members. First,\n\nhe stated, \"Can you imagine the worst fears for a loved one who has gone missing? The worst\n\nfears you can ever imagine. Take the worst fears of all the loved ones of Mary combined and\n\nyou can't even begin to imagine the horror this man inflicted on her.\" The court sustained\n\n\n                                               -45-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ndefendant's objection. Seconds later, the prosecutor stated, \"Think about what was going\n\nthrough the family members' minds while she was in those floor boards. Think about and\n\ncontrast it to defendant's own actions.\" The trial court's sustaining defendant's objection to the\n\nfirst comment and instruction the jury to disregard the comment cured any prejudice. People v.\n\nMartinson, 89 Ill. App. 3d 66, 68 (1980). Further, defendant did not object to the second\n\ncomment, nor did he include it in his posttrial motion. The second comment, which was brief,\n\ncan also be considered a reasonable inference in support of defendant's consciousness of guilt,\n\nparticularly about the concealment of a homicidal death.\n\n       The second brief reference was both shorter and less prejudicial than the arguments in\n\nBlue and Hope, the cases that defendant relies on. In Blue, the State argued that the victim's\n\nparents \" 'need to hear from you that even though they suffered the worst nightmare a parent\n\ncould suffer, that they had to bury their child, they need to hear from you that they will get\n\njustice.' \" Blue, 189 Ill. 2d at 128. The State also argued that the victim's daughter \" 'needs to\n\nhear *** that daddy didn't die in vain.' \" Blue, 189 Ill. 2d at 128. In Hope, the State elicited\n\ntestimony from the victim's wife that she had three children, age 10 or younger, and identified\n\nphotos of the victim and his family. In closing, the State referred to the victim's family, stating,\n\n\" 'Little did [the victim] know that when he said good-bye to his wife, that would be the last\n\ntime he saw her alive ***.' \" Hope, 116 Ill. 2d at 277.\n\n       Defendant also argues that the prosecutor improperly invited the jurors to put themselves\n\nin Mary's mind during the rape. This argument was relevant to rebut consent to the sexual\n\nassault, as well as Mary's submission to the assault, as illustrated by her mental state at the time\n\n\n                                                -46-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nof the assault.\n\n        Defendant next argues that the prosecutor improperly called him a \"monster\" five times.\n\nAfter the first reference, the trial court overruled defendant's objection. The State proceeded,\n\n\"Right here over here is the monster, folks. Not because I'm saying it, because he's saying it.\n\nAnd he's never been more right.\" Later, the prosecutor said, \"You can take confidence in\n\nknowing it's this monster who deposited that DNA.\" The trial court sustained defendant's\n\nobjection to calling him a monster this time, and the State went on to say, \"He called himself a\n\nmonster. That's the evidence.\" The State further argued, \"When you look at this evidence, you\n\ncome to one conclusion and that is he is evil.\" The State also accused defendant of \"playing the\n\nblame game\" by attempting to \"blame mommy\" after Mary's body was found: \"Okay, I had a bad\n\nchildhood. Great, I guess I can rape, rob, and kill now and blame mommy if I get caught.\"\n\n        \"A closing argument must serve a purpose beyond inflaming the emotions of the jury.\"\n\nPeople v. Nicholas, 218 Ill. 2d 104, 121 (2005). Therefore, a prosecutor may not \"characterize\n\nthe defendant as an 'evil' person or cast the jury's decision as a choice between 'good and evil.' \"\n\nNicholas, 218 Ill. 2d at 121. A prosecutor may, however, \"comment unfavorably on the evil\n\neffects of the crime and urge the jury to administer the law without fear, when such argument is\n\nbased on competent and pertinent evidence.\" Nicholas, 218 Ill. 2d at 121-22. In Nicholas, the\n\ncourt found no error when the prosecutor argued, \" 'And when she screams, please, don't, he\n\npulls the trigger, and pulls the trigger again, and pulls the trigger again, and pulls the trigger\n\nagain, pure evil.' \" Nicholas, 218 Ill. 2d at 113. \"Pure evil\" referred to the defendant's actions of\n\ngetting his gun, hunting his mother in the street, shooting her four times, stashing the gun,\n\n\n                                                 -47-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nreturning to bed, and displaying little concern about her death. Nicholas, 218 Ill. 2d at 113.\n\n       Here, the State claims that the words \"monster\" and \"evil\" accurately describe\n\ndefendant's actions. Further, defendant injected the term \"monster\" into the proceedings by\n\ncalling himself that in his note to Scacchitti and in his videotaped statement. Indeed, the\n\nprosecutor stated more than once in closing that it was defendant who called himself a monster.\n\nIn addition, the comment about the \"blame game\" was directed at defendant's statement that he\n\nsaw his mother's face immediately before he stabbed Mary, and it responds to a major theme in\n\nhis case, i.e., that he was less culpable because of the abuse he suffered as a child. The State\n\nclarified this position when it next stated, \"Really? That's an insult to anybody who ever had a\n\ntough childhood.\"\n\n       Defendant also argues that the State mocked his defense and ridiculed defense counsel.\n\nThe prosecutor commented regarding defense counsel's cross-examination of the State's DNA\n\nexpert, \"In this case you heard a lot of questions about DNA ad nauseum\" and, \"So for all future\n\nrapists out there make sure you kill your victim.\" The State responds that the first comment was\n\nan accurate description of the cross-examination because defense counsel spent a considerable\n\namount of time questioning the forensic scientist regarding the statistical information linking\n\ndefendant's DNA profile to the material recovered from Mary's body. It further contends that it\n\nwas responding to the defense theory by conveying the strength of the scientific evidence that\n\ndefendant was ignoring. Regarding the second comment, it was made in response to defendant's\n\nargument, which was the same as that before this court, that sexually assaulting a dead person\n\ndoes not constitute sexual assault. The assistant State's Attorney's argument expressed the same\n\n\n                                               -48-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nconcern as did the court in McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d at 268-69, as previously discussed. In any\n\nevent, the trial court sustained defendant's objection.\n\n       Defendant also contends that the State \"mocked the very idea to raising defenses to the\n\nnon-murder charges.\" For example, the prosecutor argued:\n\n               \"If Nicholas Gutierrez or when Nicholas Gutierrez murdered Mary\n\n       Stachowicz and stuck her in the floor boards, Mary Stachowicz still–the only one\n\n       that could have stopped Nicholas Gutierrez from taking that purse was Mary\n\n       Stachowicz. How did he stop her from doing that? By killing her and putting her\n\n       in the floor boards. That doesn't give you a free robbery to go down--a free crime\n\n       to go down and take the property.\"\n\nDefendant argues that characterized the defense mounted as a \"request for a free crime.\" See\n\nPeople v. Kuntu, 196 Ill. 2d 105, 145 (2001) (the trial court erred in allowing the State to argue\n\nthat not sentencing the defendant to death would be like giving him five free murders). The\n\nState contends that it was simply responding to defendant's theory and explaining that the\n\napplication of force can occur before or after the taking of the property as long as it is part of a\n\ncontinuous course of conduct. Further, the jury acquitted defendant of robbery and armed\n\nrobbery, so it is unclear how this comment could have prejudiced him.\n\n       Finally, defendant claims that the State twice improperly referred to his defense as\n\n\"splitting hairs.\" The State responds that it was properly challenging the credibility of his theory\n\nas he attempted to parse out the force requirement of different offenses in an effort to eliminate\n\nhis guilt on all offenses. People v. Kirchner, 194 Ill. 2d 502, 549 (2000).\n\n\n                                                 -49-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       We find that the comments that the state made during closing arguments were not\n\nimproper. Further, they did not result in substantial prejudice to the defendant, nor did they\n\nconstitute a material factor in his conviction. See Brooks, 345 Ill. App. 3d at 951.\n\n                                                E. Sentence\n\n       Defendant argues that the trial court, in sentencing him to life imprisonment for the\n\nmurder, failed to give adequate weight to the mitigating factors of his age, lack of significant\n\ncriminal history, abusive childhood, mental illnesses stemming from that abuse, and\n\nrehabilitative potential. Defendant requests that this court reduce his sentence pursuant to\n\nSupreme Court Rule 615(b)(4) (134 Ill. 2d R. 615(b)(4)).\n\n       The sentencing decisions of a trial court are entitled to great deference and weight\n\nbecause \"a trial judge is in a far better position than an appellate court to fashion an appropriate\n\nsentence\" based on firsthand consideration of the defendant's credibility, demeanor, moral\n\ncharacter, and other relevant factors. People v. Govea, 299 Ill. App. 3d 76, 91 (1998), citing\n\nPeople v. Perruquet, 68 Ill. 2d 149, 154 (1977). Accordingly, a trial court has wide latitude in\n\ndetermining and weighing factors in mitigation or aggravation in imposing a sentence. People\n\nv. Madura, 257 Ill. App. 3d 735, 739 (1994). When the imposed sentence falls within the\n\nstatutory guidelines, it will not be disturbed unless its imposition constitutes an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Madura, 257 Ill. App. 3d at 739-40.\n\n       A reviewing court will not engage in the reweighing of sentencing factors. People v.\n\nCagle, 277 Ill. App. 3d 29, 32 (1996). \"We will presume the trial court considered all\n\nmitigating evidence before it, absent a contrary indication other than the sentence.\" Cagle, 277\n\n\n                                                -50-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nIll. App. 3d at 32. Additionally, mitigating factors do not automatically require the sentencing\n\njudge to give less than the maximum sentence. Cagle, 277 Ill. App. 3d at 32. Where the\n\nsentencing court examines the presentence report, it is presumed that the court took into account\n\nthe defendant's potential for rehabilitation. Madura, 257 Ill. App. 3d at 739.\n\n       First, defendant argues that the trial court did not give sufficient weight to his age. At\n\nthe time of the murder, he was 19 years old and was, according to defendant, \"finally on the path\n\nto maturity and independence.\" He contends that a defendant's youth, standing alone, is an\n\nimportant mitigating factor. He cites People v. Clark, 374 Ill. App. 3d 50, 75 (2007) (reducing\n\nsentence for murder from 44 to 36 years particularly in light of the defendant's age, 18 at the\n\ntime of the murder, and lack of significant criminal background), People v. Brown, 243 Ill. App.\n\n3d 170, 176 (1993) (reducing sentence for murder from 45 to 30 years because the defendant\n\nwas 20 at the time of the murder and lacked any prior criminal history), and People v.\n\nMaldonado, 240 Ill. App. 3d 470, 484 (1992). However, the supreme court has rejected the use\n\nof comparative sentencing from unrelated cases as a basis for claiming that a particular sentence\n\nis excessive or that the judge abused his discretion. People v. Fern, 189 Ill. 2d 48, 62 (1999).\n\n\"We hold that a claim that a sentence is excessive must be based on the particular facts and\n\ncircumstances of that case. If a sentence is appropriate given the particular facts of that case, it\n\nmay not be attacked on the ground that a lesser sentence was imposed in a similar, but unrelated,\n\ncase.\" Fern, 189 Ill. 2d at 62.\n\n       Next, defendant argues that his childhood was characterized by abuse and neglect, which\n\nfurther mitigated his sentence. While the State minimizes the evidence of abuse, claiming that\n\n\n                                                -51-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nCarol Garza testified about five acts of \"possible abuse or neglect,\" the evidence seems clear\n\nthat he had a tumultuous, abusive childhood. The evidence also showed that after defendant\n\nwas taken away from his mother, he spent time at nine difference facilities.\n\n       In the presentence investigation (PSI) report, defendant reported being sexually abused\n\nby a babysitter and his mother's boyfriends. A few times, his mother made him drink until he\n\npassed out, and when he was nine, his mother beat him until he passed out. He had to observe\n\nhis mother having sex and saw two men murdered by his mother's boyfriend.\n\n       Defendant cites People v. Margentina, 261 Ill. App. 3d 247 (1994), in support of his\n\nargument. In Margentina, the Third District found that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nsentencing the defendant to 50 years for murder where he was 18 years old at the time of the\n\nmurder, was raised in a \"terrible\" environment, and was provoked. While defendant here had a\n\ntumultuous childhood and was only 19 at the time of the murder, it is doubtful that he was\n\nprovoked. In his statements to the police, defendant claimed that Mary followed him up the\n\nstairs to his apartment and asked, \"Why don't you like girls? Why do you fuck boys?\" Mary's\n\nfamily, however, testified that they never heard Mary use such language. Even assuming that\n\nevents unfolded as defendant claimed, his action of grabbing Mary and dragging her into the\n\napartment was disproportionate to what she did. Therefore, Margentina is distinguishable.\n\n       Defendant also claims that he shows \"promising rehabilitation potential\" because the\n\nonly tickets he received in jail arose from instances where an entire tier was ticketed; he was\n\nhoused in the \"Christian deck\"; and at the time of the offense, he had helped out at the funeral\n\nhome for two years and then found his own job at Subway. He also touts his lack of significant\n\n\n                                               -52-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ncriminal history. However, while he was not charged with and convicted of a plethora of violent\n\ncrimes, his background shows violent tendencies.\n\n       Most important, the trial court specifically discussed the evidence that defendant\n\npresented in mitigation. The judge noted defendant's age at the time of the murder; his good\n\nbehavior in jail; his early placements in DCFS, where \"there was very little, if any, supervision\n\nof these young children\"; the impeachment of Sharon E.; and the physical and sexual abuse he\n\nexperienced as a child. The court found, however, that the most significant factor in aggravation\n\nwas \"the actual facts of the case.\" In determining a sentence, the trial court must balance the\n\ninterests of society against the ability of a defendant to be rehabilitated. People v. Tye, 323 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 872, 890 (2001). However, a trial court is not required to give greater weight to the\n\nrehabilitative potential of a defendant than to the seriousness of the offense. Govea, 299 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 91. In fact, the seriousness of the crime committed is considered the most important\n\nfactor in fashioning an appropriate sentence. Tye, 323 Ill. App. 3d at 890. The trial court\n\ncorrectly noted the seriousness of the crime.\n\n       Because defendant's sentence is within the statutory requirements and the trial court\n\nconsidered all factors in sentencing defendant, we affirm his sentence of life imprisonment.\n\n                                                F. Mittimus\n\n       In a supplemental brief, defendant argues that his mittimus should be corrected to reflect\n\nthe three-year sentence for concealment of a homicidal death that was orally imposed by the\n\ncourt. The State concedes that the mittimus should be corrected. Accordingly, pursuant to\n\nSupreme Court Rule 615(b)(1) (134 Ill. 2d R. 615(b)(1)), we order the clerk of the circuit court\n\n\n                                                -53-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nto make the necessary correction. See People v. Jones, 376 Ill. App. 3d 372, 395 (2007).\n\n                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentence. We also\n\norder that defendant's mittimus be corrected to reflect a sentence of three years for concealment\n\nof a homicidal death.\n\n       Affirmed; mittimus corrected.\n\n       QUINN and COLEMAN, J.J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -54-\n\f             1-07-2516\n\nPlease Use                     REPORTER OF DECISIONS – ILLINOIS APPELLATE COURT\nFollowing                                (Front Sheet to be Attached to Each Case)\nForm:\n\nComple te\nTITLE\nof Case                  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,\n\n                                                                                                        Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\n                         v.\n\n                         NICHOLAS GUTIERREZ,\n\n                                                                                                        Defendant-Appellant.\n                                                               Nos. 1-07-2516\nDocket No.                                                    Appellate Court of Illinois\n                                                            First District, THIRD Division\nCOURT\n                                                                     June 30, 2010\nOpinion                                                         (modified upon rehearing)\nFiled                                                            (Give month, day and year)\n\n\n                                PRESIDING JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the court:\nJUSTICES\n                                Quinn   and Coleman, JJ.,                                                      concur [s]\n\n\n\n\n                                         Lower Court and T rial Judge(s) in form indicated in the margin:\n\nAPPEAL from\nthe Circuit Ct. of              The Honorable             William G.

He was\n\nsentenced to natural life in prison. On appeal, defendant argues that: (1) his sentence is\n\nexcessive; (2) his conviction for aggravated criminal sexual assault should be reversed because\n\nthe State failed to prove that the victim was alive at the time of the sexual assault; (3) his\n\nconviction for burglary should be reversed because he had unlimited authority to be inside the\n\nfuneral home; (4) the jury instructions constructively amended the burglary charge of the\n\nindictment; (5) the trial court erred in ruling that he failed to establish a prima facie case of racial\n\ndiscrimination during voir dire; and (6) the State made improper comments during closing and\n\nrebuttal arguments.\n\f1-07-2516\n\n\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Defendant, then 19 years old, was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated criminal\n\nsexual assault, burglary, concealment of a homicidal death, robbery, and armed robbery after the\n\nbody of Mary Stachowicz was found under the floorboards of his apartment, which was located\n\nabove the F.J. Sikorski Funeral Home. Defendant was convicted of all charges except robbery\n\nand armed robbery. The trial court found defendant eligible for the death penalty based on the\n\nmurder during the commission of aggravated criminal sexual assault but sentenced him to natural\n\nlife in prison for the murder, 30 years' imprisonment for aggravated criminal sexual assault, 7\n\nyears' imprisonment for burglary, and 3 years' imprisonment for concealment of a homicidal\n\ndeath, all sentences to be served concurrently. The following evidence was adduced at trial.\n\n                                             A. Trial\n\n                                       1. Francine Sikorski\n\n       Francine Sikorski owned the F.J. Sikorski Funeral Home, located at 3630 West George\n\nStreet in Chicago, and lived in apartment 2 East above the funeral home. Defendant and Ray\n\nScacchitti moved into the other apartment, 2 West, in December 2001. The stairwell to the\n\napartments could be accessed through a door in the lobby of the funeral home; through a single\n\ndoor outside of the funeral home, just west of the main entrance on George Street; and through a\n\nstairwell in the backyard. Sikorski testified that she allowed them to live in the apartment rent-\n\nfree in exchange for their services at the funeral home. Defendant and Scacchitti had keys to the\n\nfront door of the funeral home and keys to their apartment.\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       In the fall of 2002, defendant and Scacchitti stopped working at the funeral home.\n\nSikorski testified that she asked defendant and Scacchitti to stop working and move out because\n\nshe and Scacchitti were having personality conflicts. On cross-examination, Sikorski admitted\n\nthat she \"might\" have told the police the night of the murder that she had fired defendant.\n\nSikorski testified that she gave defendant the option of continuing to stay there; she further\n\ntestified that she loved defendant, she talks to him almost daily, and she visits him weekly.\n\nScacchitti and defendant began looking for another place to live and packing their belongings in\n\nboxes. After Sikorski told Scacchitti and defendant to move out, she expected that they would\n\nuse the same two doors to that apartment, and they had the authority to do so.\n\n       About a month before her death, Mary Stachowicz began working part-time at the funeral\n\nhome doing light cleaning and helping with Polish translations.\n\n       The morning of November 13, 2002, Christopher Stachowicz asked his mother, Mary, if\n\nhe could borrow $10. When he was taking the money from her wallet, he noticed that there was\n\na $10 bill and a $20 bill, as well as 5 to 10 other bills. He took the $10 bill, left the remaining\n\nbills, and returned the wallet to his mother's purse.\n\n       Sikorski testified that on November 13, 2002, Mary arrived at the funeral home at 8:30\n\na.m. There was a funeral at the church across the street at 10 a.m. At 10:50 a.m., Sikorski\n\nreturned to the funeral home to pick up her belongings and then left for the cemetery. Mary\n\nstayed at the funeral home to answer the phones until Sikorski returned. Mary called her\n\nhusband, Jerry, at 11 a.m. The caller ID for the funeral home's phone showed that a call came in\n\non November 13, 2002, at 11:32 a.m., from the pay phone at the Chicago Transit Authority\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n(CTA) station at Belmont and Kimball.\n\n       Sikorski returned at 12:45 p.m. The front door to the funeral home was locked, and a\n\nman was standing outside with clothes for the next visitation. Sikorski looked through the\n\nfuneral home but could not find Mary. She found Mary's purse and jacket on the chair in the\n\narrangement room and her car was still in the parking lot. In addition, there was a clean dish and\n\na dish towel on the table near Mary's jacket and purse.\n\n       Sikorski went to pick up her daughter in Wilmette at 2:45 p.m. and was gone for 45\n\nminutes. When she returned, she called the church looking for Mary and went through Mary's\n\npurse looking for her husband's phone number. Sikorski called the rectory at St. Constance\n\nchurch, where Mary was scheduled to work later that day, and got her husband's number. At\n\n3:50 p.m., Francine Sikorski called Jerry Stachowicz and told him that Mary was missing. Jerry\n\nand his son went to the funeral home, arriving at 4:30 p.m. Jerry discovered Mary's jacket, scarf,\n\nand purse sitting on a chair. Christopher looked in his mother's wallet and discovered that the\n\nbillfold area was empty.\n\n       Jerry called the police and reported his wife missing. Mary's family and the police\n\nsearched for her at the funeral home and the church across the street.\n\n                                        2. Ray Scacchitti\n\n       Scacchitti testified that he is homosexual and defendant is bisexual. In November 2002,\n\nhe and defendant were living openly as a couple in an apartment above the funeral home. In\n\nJanuary or February of 2002, shortly after Scacchitti and defendant moved into the apartment,\n\nthey began working at the funeral home. Their wages would be deducted from their rent. In\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nOctober 2002, Sikorksi told Scacchitti and defendant that she did not want them working at the\n\nfuneral home anymore. She also asked them to move out. After this time, neither Scacchitti nor\n\ndefendant would \"go into different rooms of the funeral home.\"\n\n       Soon after Sikorksi terminated Scacchitti's and defendant's employment, she hired Mary\n\nStachowicz, whom Scacchitti knew from St. Hyacinth, the church across the street. Scacchitti\n\ntestified that Mary knew he was homosexual and never confronted him or questioned his beliefs.\n\nHowever, defendant and the State stipulated that Angela Ruffolo, Mary's daughter, would testify\n\nthat her mother did not like defendant and Ray and did not approve of their lifestyle.\n\n       The morning of November 13, 2002, defendant went with Scacchitti to Flower Fantasy,\n\nthe flower shop where Scacchitti worked. When they arrived, Scacchitti gave defendant $4 to\n\nbuy breakfast; defendant went to buy it and then ate while Scacchitti worked. After 10:30 a.m.,\n\ndefendant went with the flower shop owner's sister to a fruit store half a block away, where they\n\nbought fruit for a fruit basket. At 11 a.m., defendant left for the Harlem and Irving Plaza mall,\n\nwhere he was to look for a job, play video games, and eat lunch. Scacchitti gave him between $4\n\nand $7. Scacchitti also gave defendant his cell phone.\n\n       After defendant left the flower shop, Scacchitti tried to reach him between three and five\n\ntimes. Defendant did not respond to any of those calls, which was unusual. At 3 p.m. he heard\n\nfrom defendant, who said he was on his way back to the flower shop. When defendant arrived at\n\nthe flower shop, he was limping and there was blood on his temple. Defendant said he injured\n\nhimself when he played basketball at the Norridge gym and that he cut his finger. Defendant\n\ngave Scacchitti $30, which he claimed that he won from the basketball game. Scacchitti never\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nknew defendant to have that much money.\n\n       Defendant changed into his Subway uniform in the bathroom of the flower shop and put\n\nthe clothes he had been wearing in the van. Scacchitti took him to work some time after 4 p.m.\n\nHe then returned to the flower shop and drove the owner's sister to Schiller Park. While he was\n\ntrying to find the phone number for an apartment that was for rent, Sikorski called him and said\n\nthat Mary was missing. Scacchitti went to the Subway where defendant was working and asked\n\nif he had been to the funeral home that day. Defendant responded that he had not. Because\n\ndefendant was finished working, the two returned home.\n\n       Mary's family asked to search defendant and Ray's apartment. After sending defendant\n\nfirst to check on their pets, Scacchitti took Mary's son upstairs to their apartment.\n\n       On November 13 or 14, defendant burned incense while playing video games. On the\n\n14th, when a story about Mary was on the television news, defendant said, \"God doesn't let bad\n\nthings happen to good people.\" Scacchitti testified that defendant's behavior was normal.\n\n                                              3. Police\n\n       Detective Kevin McDonald testified that on November 15, 2002, he spoke to defendant at\n\nthe police station. Defendant gave the detective his CTA card. McDonald spoke to the Norridge\n\nPark District and asked CTA security to fax a printout of the activity on defendant's CTA card.\n\nMcDonald confronted defendant with the information that the CTA card had been purchased at\n\nthe Belmont-Kimball Blue Line station at 3:02 p.m. on November 13, 2002, and was used\n\nseconds later to board the subway at that station. It was then used at 3:43 p.m. to board a bus at\n\nthe Cumberland station. McDonald also informed defendant that the outdoor basketball courts in\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nNorridge were closed at that time and that the indoor basketball court did not open until 3:30 that\n\nafternoon. To play basketball at the Norridge Park District indoor facility, defendant would have\n\nbeen required to sign in and pay $5 or have a resident pass. Defendant did not have such a pass.\n\nHe told defendant that he would send detectives to the locations that he mentioned to see if they\n\ncould get video surveillance to verify where he was.\n\n       Defendant responded that he wanted to tell the truth about what happened that day.\n\nDefendant stated that on November 13, 2002, he left the florist at 11:30 a.m. and took the El back\n\nto the funeral home, where he intended to play video games. As he walked on George Street\n\napproaching the funeral home, he saw two Hispanic men leave the front of the funeral home. He\n\ngave detailed descriptions of the two men. Defendant stated that he approached the men and\n\nasked if he could help them. They asked whether he knew Ray Scacchitti, and he replied that he\n\ndid. The men responded, \"If you tell anybody we were at the funeral home, we will kill you, Ray,\n\nand your pets.\" The larger man reached toward the small of his back, as if reaching for a\n\nweapon, but the other man stopped him. They left in a black Lincoln driven by a third man.\n\nDefendant then told McDonald that he entered his apartment and discovered that one of the rear\n\nwindows was open and the safe that contained Scacchitti's jewelry had been moved. He took\n\ncare of his pets and walked around to clear his head before taking the El back to the florist.\n\n       McDonald asked defendant what he thought happened to Mary with those people in the\n\nfuneral home. Defendant responded that he believed the two men climbed up the garage and\n\nentered his apartment through the rear window. Mary probably heard as they moved the safe and\n\nthreatened to call the police. The offenders probably left the apartment, grabbed Mary, and\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ndragged her back to the apartment so they would not get blood on the funeral home's carpet.\n\nNext, he believed that the men tried to gag Mary and ended up beating her to death when she\n\nviolently fought back. They hid the body in the funeral home in an effort to incriminate\n\ndefendant and Ray. Possible places to hide the body included the garage, air ducts in the\n\nbasement, a rear office, and a space in the ceiling of the basement. He also noted a crawl space\n\nin the den of his apartment for radiator pipes. The space was covered by boards, a rug, a table,\n\nand a bust of Jesus. Defendant stated that he also remembered that there had been art books on\n\nthe table and that they were moved. He surmised, therefore, that the body had been hidden in\n\nthat crawl space. Defendant drew a map of his apartment showing the crawl space.\n\n       Detective John Callaghan testified that he checked the common areas of the funeral\n\nhome, including the areas that defendant specified in his statement. They entered defendant's\n\napartment when he consented to the search. They proceeded to the crawl space that defendant\n\nspecified and found Mary's body. Her shirt was pulled up and her bra was protruding.\n\n       Detective Robert Rutherford left the funeral home at 7 p.m. on November 15, 2002, and\n\nreturned to the police station, where he spoke to defendant. Defendant stated that he and\n\nScacchitti were no longer working for the funeral home and were in the process of moving out of\n\ntheir apartment. On November 13, 2002, he went to the flower shop with Scacchitti and got into\n\na disagreement with him about the path his life was taking. Defendant stated that he left the\n\nflower shop and returned to the apartment. He entered the apartment through the door on George\n\nStreet that leads directly up the staircase to his apartment. When he opened the door, Mary\n\nopened the door to the staircase from the lobby of the funeral home and said, \"Oh, it's you.\"\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nDefendant gave her a disrespectful wave of his hand, as if to say, \"Don't bother me,\" and\n\ncontinued up the stairs. He stated that Mary started to close the door, stopped, opened it back up,\n\nand asked, \"Why do you fuck boys?\" Defendant told her to \"fuck off\" and continued up the\n\nstairs.\n\n          Defendant stated that Mary followed him up the stairs and asked, \"Why don't you like\n\ngirls? Why do you fuck boys?\" He entered his apartment and shut the door. He heard banging\n\non the door and started to lose control. He opened the door, grabbed Mary by the hair, and\n\ndragged her into the apartment. She slapped and kicked him, and he let her go. He backed up\n\ninto the dining room, and Mary followed him, asking, \"Why don't you like girls?\" He slapped\n\nMary, and she slapped him back. As he continued backing up through the kitchen to the den, he\n\n\"lost total control of himself.\" He punched Mary in her jaw, knocking her to the ground. He\n\ngrabbed a knife that was on top of some boxes and stabbed her and hit her until he became\n\nexhausted. He saw red while he was stabbing and beating her. He sat there for 10 minutes to\n\ncatch his breath, then he took Mary's pulse to see if she was alive. He did not feel a pulse, so he\n\ngot three plastic bags and wrapped them around her head to stop the blood from going onto the\n\nfloor.\n\n          He got a sheet off the couch in the front room and wrapped Mary's body in it. He hid her\n\nbody in the crawl space below the den. He cleaned the floor and furniture using three rolls of\n\npaper towels and put the paper towels, as well as a blood-covered sheet from the couch, into a\n\ngarbage bag. He went down the front stairs into the funeral home. As he walked through the\n\nfuneral home, he saw Mary's purse out in the open. He took $85 from her purse, left through the\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nback door, hopped a fence, and walked down the alley, where he put the garbage bag into a\n\ngarbage can. He walked to the El stop and went back to the flower shop. When he got to the\n\nflower shop, defendant gave Scacchitti $30 and told him he won it playing basketball. He\n\nchanged into his work uniform and left his dirty clothes in the van.\n\n       Detective Robert Carrillo testified that on November 15, 2002, defendant asked him to\n\ntake the $52 in his wallet and give it to Mary's family. Defendant stated that he was going to take\n\nthat money, whatever he could steal from Ray, and any valuables from the funeral home to buy a\n\nticket to Las Vegas.\n\n       Carrillo contacted the State's Attorney's office. Assistant State's Attorney Mark Hitt\n\narrived at 10 p.m. and spoke to defendant. At the end of their conversation, defendant gave a\n\nvideotaped statement, which was substantially similar to his statements to Rutherford and\n\nCarrillo. At the time defendant gave this statement, the autopsy had not been completed.\n\n       After defendant finished his videotaped statement, defendant asked if he could write Ray\n\na note. Hitt gave defendant a pen and some paper and allowed him to write a note. When\n\ndefendant was done, Hitt showed it to Detective Carrillo and then took it to Ray. In the note,\n\ndefendant expressed his affection for Scacchitti and apologized for what he had done. He asked\n\nSchacchitti, \"Please don't think of me as a monster.\"\n\n       On November 16, 2002, after learning the results of Mary's autopsy, Detective Carrillo\n\ntold defendant that Mary's cause of death was strangulation. Defendant stated that after he beat\n\nand stabbed Mary until he was exhausted, he checked for a pulse and did not find one. He saw\n\nthe telephone line for the funeral home lit up, suggesting that Francine had returned from the\n\n\n                                               -10-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nfuneral. He was afraid that Francine might be calling the police, so he decided to hide the body.\n\nHe placed the bags over Mary's head and pressed down on the neck area for two minutes, hoping\n\nthat the blood would coagulate and form a seal. The blood slowed down, and he placed the body\n\nin a blanket and then put the body in the floorboards. Defendant did not mention having sexual\n\ncontact with Mary, and Carrillo did not ask because he was unaware at that point.\n\n       Assistant State's Attorney Julie Egan learned the results of the autopsy on November 16,\n\n2002. She briefly spoke to defendant and told him that the cause of Mary's death was\n\nstrangulation and asked if he knew anything about that. Defendant explained that he placed\n\nplastic bags over Mary's head to stop the bleeding, and when that did not work, he placed his\n\nhands around the victim's throat for two minutes.\n\n                                      4. Medical Examiner\n\n       The medical examiner, Dr. Eupil Choi, found 11 superficial stab wounds on the back and\n\nright side of Mary's head and on her neck. The stab wounds were inflicted from behind. The\n\nwound to her neck struck the cervical bone and would have caused her to lose consciousness. It\n\nalso would have caused the knife to bend. Ten of her ribs were fractured, and there were\n\nabrasions on her arms and elbows. She had numerous injuries indicative of strangulation,\n\nincluding bruising on her neck and the underside of her chin and fractured neck bones. The\n\nstrangulation injuries were consistent with being strangled with the sheet that her body was\n\nwrapped in.\n\n       The doctor did not find any injuries to her vagina or rectum consistent with sexual\n\nassault, nor was her clothing ripped. He testified, however, that sexual assault can occur without\n\n\n                                               -11-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nany injuries to the body. Further, Mary gave birth four times, and each time a woman gives birth,\n\nthe elasticity of the vagina is reduced, which, in turn, makes vaginal injuries less likely. She also\n\nhad rib fractures and a bruise to her groin, which are consistent with a sexual assault.\n\n       Semen was present in the vaginal and rectal swabs taken from Mary Stachowicz. The\n\nforensic scientist working on the vaginal swab inadvertently combined the male and female\n\nsamples after they had been previously separated. As a result, no male DNA was found in the\n\nvaginal sample. Defendant could not be excluded as a contributor to the male profile from the\n\nrectal swab. Defendant's DNA was found on Mary's underwear.\n\n       Defendant's clothes containing Mary's blood were recovered from Scacchitti's van. A\n\nfolding hunting knife with a bent tip was recovered from the living room of defendant's\n\napartment. It contained both defendant's and Mary's DNA. The police also found a plastic bag\n\ncontaining blood-soaked towels and sheets in a nearby garbage can. Mary's DNA was found on\n\nthe paper towels. There were no signs of forced entry into the funeral home or into defendant's\n\napartment.\n\n                                             5. Verdict\n\n       The jury found defendant not guilty of robbery and armed robbery and guilty of burglary,\n\nmurder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and concealment of a homicidal death. Defendant\n\nwaived a jury for the eligibility and death penalty proceedings.\n\n                                           B. Sentencing\n\n       The State sought the death penalty on the basis that the killing happened during the\n\ncommission of an inherently dangerous crime. The trial court found that defendant was eligible\n\n\n                                                -12-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nto receive the death penalty on the basis of the aggravated criminal sexual assault.\n\n       During the next phase of the sentencing hearing, Sharon E. testified that in 1995, she was\n\nsix years old and living at the Larkin Center, a residential home for children in Elgin, where\n\ndefendant was also living. On Halloween, she was in the bathroom when defendant and two\n\nother boys entered. The boys put Sharon on top of the sink and defendant put his penis onto her\n\nvagina without penetrating it. Defendant stated that if she told anyone, he would kill her. She\n\ntold a staff member that two boys were \"messing\" with her, but she did not implicate defendant at\n\nthe time because she was afraid. Afterward, the staff told her she had to sleep on the couch. At\n\nnight, when she slept on the couch, defendant would stand in front of her and look at her \"crazy.\"\n\n       Linda Nordtvedt was defendant's therapist at the Larkin Center in 1995. When\n\nconfronted about the incident involving Sharon E., defendant admitted only that he exposed\n\nhimself. She observed visitations between defendant and his mother; their interactions were\n\npositive, and she found no cause for concern. Nordtvedt testified that defendant did not make\n\nmuch progress in his therapy because he only told her what he wanted her to hear and did not\n\nwork on his issues. When he was released from the Larkin Center, his prognosis was poor based\n\non behaviors he exhibited. For example, he had difficulty taking responsibility for his own\n\nactions, and he frequently ran away at the beginning of his stay there. In addition, there was an\n\nincident involving the sexual abuse of another resident. As a result, restrictions were placed on\n\ndefendant for the safety of other residents.\n\n       In 1997, defendant was transferred to the juvenile sex offender program at Uhlich\n\nChildren's Advantage Network, a residential program for children with severe behavior and\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nemotional problems. Ann Przybysz, a residential intake coordinator at Uhlich, conducted a\n\nviolence screening with defendant as part of the intake process. During the screening, defendant\n\nreported carrying a knife as a weapon, using a weapon in a fight, robbing a parent and a stranger,\n\nand forcing his sister to have sex with him. He also reported that he saw a security guard get shot\n\nand killed at a mall and saw his mother beat his sister until she bled. His mother beat him until\n\nhe was bleeding or knocked out. Further, he reported that his babysitter's friend forced him to\n\nhave sex against his will.\n\n       Francisco Monzon, who was a residential case manager in 1997, testified that defendant\n\nwas in the sexually aggressive program at Uhlich. His individual plan included no unsupervised\n\ncontact with minors. While defendant was successful in the program initially, he began to run\n\naway frequently, was found with pornography in his possession, and committed theft while he\n\nwas on the run. In September 1997, defendant, then 14, was charged with possession of lost or\n\nmislaid credit cards, which he gave to a fellow Uhlich resident. In October 1997, he was arrested\n\nfor retail theft. Monzon reported that defendant was resistant to staff and stopped making\n\nprogress in therapy. Defendant's visits with his mother were normal and did not cause Monzon\n\nany concern. Defendant was discharged from Uhlich because of his runaway behavior.\n\n       Lynda Moore, defendant's Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS)\n\ncaseworker in 1999, testified that when she first took over defendant's case, he was placed at the\n\nMill in Rockford, Illinois. The Mill was a residential placement for children with behavioral\n\nproblems, and it provided services for juvenile sex offenders. Defendant, who was 15 at the\n\ntime, lacked progress there. He was sexually inappropriate with both peers and staff, and he\n\n\n                                               -14-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nfondled another student. He also broke into the chief executive officer's office at the Mill, where\n\nhe accessed confidential student information, stole and broke items, and made long-distance\n\nphone calls. He was convicted of burglary and property damage for this incident and sentenced\n\nto 18 months' probation. He also ran away to high-risk areas, including the parking lot of a\n\nschool that developmentally challenged children attended. Defendant had fantasies about raping\n\nwomen in parking lots; once, he was found crouched between cars in a parking lot with a\n\ncrowbar. The Mill asked to have defendant removed and placed in a more restrictive\n\nenvironment because he was at \"high risk of sexual re-offense\" and he \"terrified\" the women at\n\nthe Mill.\n\n       The only placement more restrictive than the Mill is a locked facility; however, there\n\nwere none in Illinois that would accept defendant. Moore found defendant, then 16, a placement\n\nat Piney Ridge, a locked, out-of-state facility for children with psychiatric issues and juvenile\n\nsex-offender behaviors. At first, defendant did well at Piney Ridge, as he moved up the level\n\nsystem quickly and gained the trust of his therapist. However, he ran away when he was\n\nassigned the task of taking out the trash. Defendant was discharged from Piney Ridge with a\n\npoor prognosis after he engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a peer. Defendant got mad\n\nat the peer and threatened to slash his throat.\n\n       Moore found one private agency in Illinois that was willing to take defendant. Defendant\n\nwas transported to Onarga Place but was rejected because of his runaway behavior. Moore had\n\nno choice but to take defendant to a DCFS emergency shelter for the night. A couple of hours\n\nlater, he ran away, and Moore never saw him again. Moore stated that she was afraid of\n\n\n                                                  -15-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ndefendant.\n\n       Christiana Largent, defendant's younger sister, also testified in aggravation. Largent is\n\nfour years younger than defendant. For the first four years of her life, she lived with her mother\n\nand defendant. When Largent was three, her mother hung her out a window to eliminate her fear\n\nof heights. Her mother also wanted defendant to hang Largent out the window, but he refused.\n\nDuring this period of time, their mother physically abused defendant. However, their mother did\n\nnot sexually abuse her or expose her to sexual abuse. When Largent was four and defendant was\n\nnine, their mother broke a whiskey bottle over Largent's head. They were removed from their\n\nmother's home and placed in a group home called Hephzibah. Defendant was moved to another\n\nhome a week later, while Largent stayed at Hephzibah until she was 10. Largent testified that her\n\nmother tried to visit when she could. When Largent was 11, she returned to her mother's home,\n\nand in 2003, they moved to Alabama. Largent testified that, to her recollection, defendant did\n\nnot sexually abuse her before they were removed from their mother's home.\n\n       While defendant was in jail, he was charged when the entire tier was involved in a fight.\n\nDefendant stated that he was writing a letter on the top tier when the fight occurred. After a\n\nhearing, he was found guilty of fighting and was sentenced to 14 days in disciplinary segregation.\n\nIn another incident, defendant was charged with participating in a riot in the prison gym. After a\n\nhearing, defendant was found guilty and was sentenced to 29 days in segregation.\n\n       In mitigation, the parties stipulated that Dr. Paul Batty would testify that he examined\n\nSharon E. in the emergency room of St. Joseph's Hospital on November 1, 1995, and that his\n\nphysical examination revealed no signs of trauma. He would further testify that Sharon E. denied\n\n\n                                                -16-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nthat the boys touched her private parts with their hands, touched her with their private parts, or\n\nremoved her underwear.\n\n       The parties also stipulated that Melody E., Sharon E.'s mother, would testify that during\n\nher visit with Sharon after the Halloween of 1995, she stated that \"them boys touched me\" and\n\nthat she never mentioned defendant's name.\n\n       David Berg, a forensic interviewer for the Child Advocacy Center in Kane County,\n\ntestified that he interviewed Sharon E. on November 6, 1995. Sharon told him that three boys\n\npulled down her pants and touched her private part. While she named Chris, Ray, and TK, she\n\ndid not mention defendant. He testified that she was evasive and anxious and it was difficult to\n\ntalk to her. He interviewed defendant, who denied involvement but was \"overly eager\" to\n\nimplicate the other three boys.\n\n       Carol Garza testified that she was friends with Paula Largent, defendant's mother. In the\n\n1980s, Garza and Largent worked at a lounge owned by Hector Gutierrez. While Hector was\n\nmarried, he had an affair with Paula; as a result, Paula became pregnant with defendant. Shortly\n\nafter defendant was born, he and Paula lived with Garza and her family. Hector continued living\n\nwith his wife. After a year, Paula moved to an apartment building owned by Hector's parents.\n\nWhile they worked at the lounge, Carol and Paula became alcoholics and cocaine addicts. They\n\npartied three or four times a week, frequently at Paula's apartment. Defendant was at the\n\napartment sleeping while this occurred; however, he would wake up now and then. Paula would\n\nyell at defendant when he came out of his room while they were getting high. One time, Paula\n\nbackhanded defendant because he came out of his room crying, and a few other times, she\n\n\n                                                -17-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nslapped or spanked him for leaving his room or for crying. Another time, Paula strapped him to\n\nhis high chair with a belt. His bedroom door was kept locked from the outside by either a belt or\n\na clothes line while Paula and others got high. Carol also witnessed one of their drug dealers\n\nfondle defendant's crotch while he was lying on the couch wearing pajamas and a diaper.\n\nDefendant, then two or three, woke up crying. In addition, Carol saw Peto, an associate of their\n\ndrug dealer, swipe his penis across defendant's mouth while he was sleeping. When defendant\n\nwoke up, Peto took defendant to his bedroom, where they remained for 10 to 15 minutes. Carol\n\ndid not remember whether the door was open or closed or whether Peto and defendant were\n\nalone in the bedroom. At some point during the 1980s, Paula told Carol that she paid for drugs\n\nby selling defendant for sex.

Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault\n\n            1. Whether the State Must Prove the Victim Was Alive at the Time of the Assault\n\n       Defendant argues that the crime of sexual assault requires that the State prove that the\n\nvictim was alive at the time of the sexual acts. He contends that his conviction for aggravated\n\ncriminal sexual assault must be reversed because the State failed to prove that Mary was alive at\n\nthe time he assaulted her.\n\n       In support of his argument, defendant cites People v. Segara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2132339\"><a href=\"/opinion/2132339/people-v-segara/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988), which\n\nheld, \"To the victim, each rape was 'readily divisible and intensely personal; each offense is an\n\noffense against a person.' \" (Emphasis in original.)

The question in that case, however, was\n\nwhether the defendant was liable for two acts of criminal sexual assault, not whether the State\n\nmust prove that the victim was alive at the time of the rape. Further, the Illinois criminal sexual\n\nassault statute does not specifically require a living victim. 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(3), 12-12(f), 12-\n\n13(a)(1), 12-14 (West 2006).\n\n       Further, People v.

This court concluded that \"we will not draw a bright line which would\n\nrequire the State in all similar cases to establish the precise time of death in order to prove a\n\nsexual assault upon a murder victim.\" Hendrix, 250 Ill. App. 3d at 103. Accordingly, the court\n\nconcluded that the State proved defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Hendrix, 250 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 103.\n\n       Hendrix relied on People v.

In Colley, the defendant\n\nargued that he was not proven guilty of aggravated criminal sexual assault because the victim's\n\nstab wounds occurred too long after the sexual acts were performed to be considered part of the\n\nsame course of conduct. The court noted that the evidence showed that the defendant stabbed the\n\nvictim soon after the sexual acts were completed. Colley, 188 Ill. App. 3d at 820. \"Under the\n\ninstant circumstances, we will not draw a bright line between the ending of the sexual acts and\n\nthe bodily harm occurring afterward, as that would defeat the statutory purpose of protecting\n\nvictims from sex offenders.\" Colley, 188 Ill. App. 3d at 820. The court found that the stab\n\nwounds occurred \"sufficiently close in time to the sexual acts that they can be said to have been\n\ncommitted during the course of the sexual assault.\" Colley, 188 Ill.

Noting\n\nthat Missouri's rape statute did not expressly address whether the victim must be alive at the time\n\nof penetration, the court, like \"the majority of jurisdictions to address this issue,\" adopted the\n\n\"ongoing criminal assault\" rule. McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d at 268. \"Under that rule, where the\n\nforcible compulsion that leads to the rape begins before the death of the victim, the defendant is\n\nguilty of rape even if the jury believes defendant killed the victim before penetration or before\n\nthe sexual assault was concluded.\" McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d at 268. The court noted important\n\npolicy reasons why the death of the victim during the assault should not preclude a conviction for\n\nrape:\n\n        \" 'We are likewise unable to embrace the notion that the fortuitous circumstance,\n\n        for the rapist, that death may have preceded penetration by an instant, negates\n\n        commission of the crime of aggravated rape and reduces it to a relatively minor\n\n        offense associated with erotic attraction to dead bodies.

In addition, the side zipper on her pants was not zipped, which\n\nsuggested that she did not dress herself. The evidence also showed that defendant used force\n\nduring the sexual assault. See 720 ILCS 5/12-13(a)(1) (West 2006). Mary was stabbed 11\n\ntimes in her head and neck. She was strangled, 10 of her ribs were fractured, and there were\n\nabrasions on her arms and elbows.

Defendant contends that Mary must have been\n\ndead when he raped her because there was no evidence of vaginal or rectal tearing or bruising,\n\nher clothing was not torn, and he confessed to the murder but not to a sexual assault.\n\nWhile there was no evidence of injuries to Mary's vagina or rectum, the medical examiner\n\ntestified that sexual assault can occur without any injuries to the body. Further, Mary gave birth\n\nfour times, and each time a woman gives birth, the elasticity of the vagina is reduced, which, in\n\nturn, makes vaginal injuries less likely. See People v.

Here, on the other hand, the State\n\npresented evidence that defendant no longer worked at the funeral home, that the funeral home\n\nwas not open to the public, and that the funeral home remained locked at all times except during\n\nvisitations. In addition, defendant lived in an apartment above the funeral home, with a separate\n\naccess door, not within the funeral home. Further, Scacchitti testified that he and defendant had\n\nbeen fired and no longer entered the funeral home.\n\n                                       2. Jury Instruction\n\n       Defendant argues that if this court finds the evidence sufficient to support his burglary\n\nconviction, it should still remand for retrial on that charge because an erroneous burglary\n\ninstruction was given to the jury. Defendant was charged with one count of burglary based on\n\nan unlawful entry into the funeral home and predicated on an intent to commit theft. However,\n\nthe jury was instructed that defendant was guilty of burglary if he \"without authority remain[ed]\n\nwithin\" the funeral home \"with intent to commit therein the offense of theft or concealment of a\n\nhomicidal death.\" Defendant contends that this instruction constructively amended the\n\nindictment because it changed the method of committing the burglary and broadened the\n\n\n                                               -33-\n\f1-07-2516\n\npossible mental states. He maintains that his fifth amendment rights have been violated, since\n\n\"a person's right to notice of a charge and an opportunity to mount a defense in court is basic to\n\nour system of jurisprudence.\"\n\n          The State contends that defendant waived this argument. At trial, defendant objected to\n\nthe State's burglary instruction only on the basis of the limited authority doctrine, not because it\n\nbroadened the indictment. See People v. Eyler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230536\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230536/people-v-eyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219 (1989) (specific objections\n\nwaive all grounds not specified).

Defendant had been fired from the funeral home, he and Ray had a fight that\n\nmorning about defendant's life path, defendant admitted that he planned to take money and\n\nanything valuable from Ray and the funeral home to buy a ticket to Las Vegas, and he entered\n\nthe funeral home and took money from Mary's purse.\n\n       As for the second prong of the plain-error rule, both the United States and Illinois\n\nconstitutions provide a criminal defendant with the fundamental right to be informed of the\n\nnature and cause of the charges against him.

On the first day, the State exercised\n\nperemptory challenges against three venirepersons: Susan Farese, who was Caucasian, and Juan\n\nMunoz and Judith McCain Brown, whose races are not known. On the second day, the State\n\nexercised peremptory challenges against three African American venirepersons: Patricia\n\nWilkerson, Robert Joyner, and Richard Monroe. After the jury was seated, the State exercised a\n\nperemptory challenge against a potential venireperson for one of the four alternate positions,\n\nClifford Haywood, an African American.\n\n       Defense counsel made a Batson challenge. The assistant State's Attorney argued that\n\ndefendant failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination because defendant is Hispanic and\n\nCaucasian, there were no African American attorneys or witnesses in the case, and the defense\n\nhad used its six previous peremptory challenges against Caucasians. The court noted that \"by\n\nmy count there are four African Americans, one Hispanic, and I believe there are two of Asian\n\ndescent.\" The court denied the Batson motion, concluding, \"I think *** you're looking at what\n\nwe are doing today, not the entire jury selection process.\" In its response to defendant's motion\n\nfor new trial, the State represented that the final jury consisted of six Caucasians, four African\n\nAmericans, one Hispanic, and one Asian American.\n\n\n                                                -36-\n\f1-07-2516\n\n       In Batson, the United States Supreme Court \"held that in a criminal case the fourteenth\n\namendment=s equal protection clause prohibits the State from using a peremptory challenge to\n\nexclude a prospective juror based solely on the basis of his or her race.\" People v.

Williams, 173 Ill. 2d at 72.\n\n       The next relevant circumstance is whether the State used a disproportionate number of\n\nperemptory challenges to exclude African Americans.

This inquiry is different from the question of whether the State used\n\na disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude African Americans. While the\n\n\n                                               -38-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nproportionality analysis compares the number of peremptories used against African Americans\n\nversus the number used against Caucasians, the pattern analysis compares the number of African\n\nAmericans that could have been, but were not, struck by the State.

Before exercising peremptory challenges against Wilkerson, Joyner,\n\nMonroe, and Haywood, the State had accepted two panels that included four African Americans.\n\nOur supreme court has previously found that when a Batson claim is made regarding\n\ndiscrimination against a particular race, the unchallenged presence of jurors of that race on the\n\nseated jury tends to weaken the basis for a prima facie case of discrimination. People v. Rivera,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2222107\"><a href=\"/opinion/2222107/people-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (2006).\n\n       The fourth factor is the level of African American representation in the venire as\n\ncompared to the jury. We first note a discrepancy in the record as to the racial makeup of the\n\nfinal jury. The trial court stated that the final jury consisted of four African Americans, one\n\nHispanic, and two Asians. In its response to defendant's motion for new trial, the State claimed\n\nthat the jury consisted of six Caucasians, four African Americans, one Hispanic, and one Asian\n\nAmerican; on appeal, the parties continue to cite these numbers. Even applying the proportions\n\ncited by the parties on appeal, however, we still find that the empaneled jury had higher\n\npercentage of African Americans than the venire.\n\n       Excluding those venirepersons excused for cause (People v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2025348\"><a href=\"/opinion/2025348/people-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65\n\n(1988)), the venire contained 39 prospective jurors. Of those 39, 21 were Caucasian (53.8 %);\n\n11 were African American (28.2 %); 6 were Hispanic (15.4 %); and 1 was Asian American (2.6\n\n%). According to the parties, the final 12-person jury consisted of 6 Caucasians (50 %); 4\n\n\n                                               -39-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nAfrican Americans (33.3 %); 1 Hispanic (8.3 %); and 1 Asian American (8.3 %). Thus, a larger\n\npercentage of African Americans served on the jury than were present in the venire. See Evans,\n\n125 Ill. 2d at 65 (empaneled jury had higher percentage of African Americans than the venire).\n\n       This court must also analyze questions and statements made during he prosecutor during\n\nvoir dire and while exercising challenges. Defendant does not allege, and the record does not\n\nindicate, that the assistant State's Attorneys' statements or questions to the jury were racially\n\nmotivated.\n\n       Another factor that has been taken into consideration in determining whether a defendant\n\nhas presented a prima facie case is the race of the defendant, the victim, and the witnesses.\n\nWilliams, 173 Ill. 2d at 71. The victim was Caucasian, and defendant is Caucasian and\n\nHispanic. The attorneys were Caucasian, and the witnesses were Caucasian, African American,\n\nHispanic, and Asian. There were no racial overtones in the case. See Evans, 125 Ill. 2d at 65-\n\n66 (any racial issue inherent in the selection of the jury was minimal where the case did not\n\ninvolve \"an interracial crime in which specific racial groups would be prone to take sides of\n\nprejudice\").\n\n       The final relevant circumstance is whether the excluded venirepersons were a\n\nheterogeneous group sharing race as their only common characteristic. Defendant claims that\n\nthe four stricken jurors shared race as their only common characteristic, as one was widowed,\n\none was married, one was single, and one had a domestic partner; two had been victims of\n\nproperty offenses, while two had not been victims of any crimes; and \"they each had different\n\nkids of jobs and interests.\" Defendant also compares the four stricken jurors= qualifications to\n\n\n                                                -40-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nthose of the seated jurors; he claims that Joyner was similar to Anthony Magnifico, a seated\n\njuror, because both were married with children, worked as skilled laborers, and had been a\n\nvictim or married to a victim of a property offense for which no one was arrested. He compares\n\nJoyner and Monroe, who had food-service experience, to seated juror Loretta Jackson, who was\n\nstudying to be a chef. However, three of the four stricken jurors had children, none had been\n\nconvicted of a crimes, and both Joyner and Haywood were in security-type jobs without formal\n\nlaw enforcement training.\n\n       While defendant makes much of the fact that the State used its final four challenges\n\nagainst African Americans, he cites no case law holding that this pattern suggests\n\ndiscrimination. In addition, it is well established that the court must consider \"the totality of the\n\nrelevant facts\" and \"all relevant circumstances\" surrounding the strikes. People v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2216535\"><a href=\"/opinion/2216535/people-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 360 (2008). Thus, it was proper for the trial court to consider the entire jury\n\nselection process, not only, as the trial court noted, \"what we are doing today.\" Further, the\n\nState argued in response to defendant's Batson challenge at trial that defendant used 13 of his 16\n\nperemptory challenges to strike Caucasians, and after the eleventh juror was accepted, defendant\n\nstruck 10 Caucasians.\n\n       Defendant also argues that the trial court used the incorrect standard in ruling on his\n\nBatson motion. He contends that the trial court made a conclusory determination that no\n\ndiscrimination had occurred without first considering whether he had presented a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination. He cites People v. Hogan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), which concluded\n\nthat the trial court did not follow the three-step procedure delineated by Batson as to the\n\n\n                                                -41-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ndefendant's first Batson motion where it failed to ask the defendant to make a prima facie\n\nshowing before making a judicial determination. Hogan, 389 Ill. App. 3d at 101. Unlike the\n\ndefendant in Hogan, defendant in the instant case first argued that a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination was established because he was a minority, the last four peremptory challenges\n\nused by the State were against minorities, and there was nothing in their backgrounds that\n\ndistinguished them from the seated jurors. The State responded that a prima facie case had not\n\nbeen established because defendant was not a minority, the State did not engage in a pattern of\n\nstrikes against African Americans, and the last six jurors struck by defendant were Caucasian.\n\nThe trial court analyzed the \"entire jury selection process\" and denied the motion. Therefore,\n\nthe trial court did not collapse the three-step Batson procedure.\n\n                                        D. State's Closing\n\n       Next, defendant argues that he was denied a fair and impartial trial by the State's closing\n\narguments, which argued facts not in evidence, urged the jury to reach a verdict out of outrage,\n\nand disparaged defendant and his counsel. He contends that the cumulative effect of the\n\nprosecutor's improper comments requires reversal of his convictions.\n\n       \"[D]efendant faces a substantial burden in attempting to achieve reversal [of his\n\nconviction] based upon improper remarks made during closing argument.\" People v.

A reviewing court will not reverse a jury=s verdict based on improper\n\nremarks made during closing arguments unless the comments resulted in substantial prejudice to\n\nthe defendant and constituted a material factor in his conviction. People v. Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022811\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022811/people-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 945, 951 (2004).\n\n       Defendant contends that the State engaged in speculation and misstated evidence when it\n\nargued: (1) that Mary was washing dishes when she caught defendant going through her purse,\n\n(2) that she threatened to call the police; (3) that he grabbed her and dragged her upstairs, and\n\n(4) that Sikorski removed any evidence of a struggle by cleaning the funeral home. \"To be\n\nproper, closing argument comments on evidence must be either proved by direct evidence or be\n\na fair and reasonable inference from the facts and circumstances proven.\" People v. Hood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2025759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2025759/people-v-hood/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (1992).\n\n       The argument that defendant was caught going through Mary's purse was supported by\n\nseveral facts, including that money was missing from her purse, that defendant admitted taking\n\nmoney from her purse, and that her purse was in an area where cash was hidden inside the\n\nfuneral home. The evidence also supported the argument that Mary was washing dishes when\n\nsomething interrupted her, as Sikorski testified that there was a clean dish and a dish towel on\n\nthe table near Mary's jacket and purse.\n\n       The State further responds that the argument that defendant grabbed Mary and dragged\n\nher upstairs after she threatened to call the police was based on defendant's fictional account of\n\ntwo Hispanic men trying to burglarize his apartment, portions of which were truthful if\n\n\"defendant's name [is] inserted into that story.\" For example, defendant told Detective\n\n\n                                                -43-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nMcDonald that he believed the two men climbed up the garage and entered his apartment\n\nthrough the rear window. Defendant stated that Mary probably heard them as they moved the\n\nsafe and threatened to call the police. The offenders, according to defendant's fictional account,\n\nprobably left the apartment, grabbed Mary, and dragged her back to the apartment, where they\n\nbeat her to death when she violently fought back. Defendant also eventually admitted to\n\nDetective Rutherford that he grabbed Mary by her hair and dragged her into the apartment.\n\nSimilarly, the prosecutor's \"desperate inference\" that there were scuff marks based on a\n\nphotograph of the staircase leading to defendant's apartment was supported by defendant's story\n\nthat the two Hispanic men dragged Mary up the stairs; the photo showing black marks on the\n\nstaircase; and defendant's admission that he \"dragged\" Mary into his apartment.\n\n       As for defendant's contention that the prosecutor speculated as to why Mary had to have\n\nbeen brought upstairs to be killed, we note that, in his \"fictional\" account, defendant stated that\n\nthe Hispanic men brought Mary upstairs to avoid getting blood on the funeral-home carpet. In\n\naddition, the front doors are made of glass and face a busy road and a church; the crime was\n\ncommitted in broad daylight; and a funeral, for which clothes were being dropped off, was\n\nscheduled for the next day. Furthermore, the argument in rebuttal that Sikorski removed\n\nevidence of a struggle in the funeral home could be construed as a response to defendant's\n\nclosing argument that \"there wasn't one speck of evidence to even suggest that a struggle took\n\nplace anywhere on the first floor of that funeral home.\" The State noted that the funeral home\n\nwas going to be used for a wake the next day, and \"Don't you think Francine is going to clean\n\nthat funeral home?\" In his confession, defendant said he used three rolls of paper towels to\n\n\n                                                -44-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nclean up the victim's blood, put three plastic bags over her head, and wrapped her body in a\n\nsheet to staunch the flow of her blood.\n\n       Finally, defendant contends that the State ignored uncontested evidence when it argued\n\nthat the struggle occurred in the kitchen. However, defendant himself admitted in one of his\n\nstatements that part of the struggle occurred in the kitchen. Furthermore, Mary had injuries to\n\nher elbows consistent with friction with a hard surface, and it is reasonable to assume that if\n\ndefendant had raped and stabbed Mary in the den, there would have been more blood on the\n\nfurniture, boxes, and rug.\n\n       Defendant argues that the State ignored the \"one account of events\" that was in\n\nevidence--i.e., defendant's videotaped statement--and created a scenario that was unsupported,\n\nor even contradicted by, the trial evidence. However, the jury was not required to believe the\n\nentirety of defendant's videotaped statement, especially when defendant previously lied to the\n\npolice and the evidence contradicts his statement. See People v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">243</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259 (2007).\n\n       Defendant also argues that the State urged the jury to reach a verdict out of outrage when\n\nit repeatedly disparaged defendant and defense counsel. See People v. Blue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2108726\"><a href=\"/opinion/2108726/people-v-blue/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129-\n\n30 (2000); People v.

For example, the prosecutor twice\n\nasked the jury to consider what was going through the minds of Mary's family members. First,\n\nhe stated, \"Can you imagine the worst fears for a loved one who has gone missing? The worst\n\nfears you can ever imagine. Take the worst fears of all the loved ones of Mary combined and\n\nyou can't even begin to imagine the horror this man inflicted on her.\" The court sustained\n\n\n                                               -45-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ndefendant's objection. Seconds later, the prosecutor stated, \"Think about what was going\n\nthrough the family members' minds while she was in those floor boards. Think about and\n\ncontrast it to defendant's own actions.\" The trial court's sustaining defendant's objection to the\n\nfirst comment and instruction the jury to disregard the comment cured any prejudice. People v.\n\nMartinson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (1980). Further, defendant did not object to the second\n\ncomment, nor did he include it in his posttrial motion. The second comment, which was brief,\n\ncan also be considered a reasonable inference in support of defendant's consciousness of guilt,\n\nparticularly about the concealment of a homicidal death.\n\n       The second brief reference was both shorter and less prejudicial than the arguments in\n\nBlue and Hope, the cases that defendant relies on. In Blue, the State argued that the victim's\n\nparents \" 'need to hear from you that even though they suffered the worst nightmare a parent\n\ncould suffer, that they had to bury their child, they need to hear from you that they will get\n\njustice.' \" Blue, 189 Ill. 2d at 128. The State also argued that the victim's daughter \" 'needs to\n\nhear *** that daddy didn't die in vain.' \" Blue, 189 Ill. 2d at 128. In Hope, the State elicited\n\ntestimony from the victim's wife that she had three children, age 10 or younger, and identified\n\nphotos of the victim and his family. In closing, the State referred to the victim's family, stating,\n\n\" 'Little did [the victim] know that when he said good-bye to his wife, that would be the last\n\ntime he saw her alive ***.' \" Hope, 116 Ill. 2d at 277.\n\n       Defendant also argues that the prosecutor improperly invited the jurors to put themselves\n\nin Mary's mind during the rape. This argument was relevant to rebut consent to the sexual\n\nassault, as well as Mary's submission to the assault, as illustrated by her mental state at the time\n\n\n                                                -46-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nof the assault.\n\n        Defendant next argues that the prosecutor improperly called him a \"monster\" five times.\n\nAfter the first reference, the trial court overruled defendant's objection. The State proceeded,\n\n\"Right here over here is the monster, folks. Not because I'm saying it, because he's saying it.\n\nAnd he's never been more right.\" Later, the prosecutor said, \"You can take confidence in\n\nknowing it's this monster who deposited that DNA.\" The trial court sustained defendant's\n\nobjection to calling him a monster this time, and the State went on to say, \"He called himself a\n\nmonster. That's the evidence.\" The State further argued, \"When you look at this evidence, you\n\ncome to one conclusion and that is he is evil.\" The State also accused defendant of \"playing the\n\nblame game\" by attempting to \"blame mommy\" after Mary's body was found: \"Okay, I had a bad\n\nchildhood. Great, I guess I can rape, rob, and kill now and blame mommy if I get caught.\"\n\n        \"A closing argument must serve a purpose beyond inflaming the emotions of the jury.\"\n\nPeople v. Nicholas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (2005). Therefore, a prosecutor may not \"characterize\n\nthe defendant as an 'evil' person or cast the jury's decision as a choice between 'good and evil.' \"\n\nNicholas, 218 Ill. 2d at 121. A prosecutor may, however, \"comment unfavorably on the evil\n\neffects of the crime and urge the jury to administer the law without fear, when such argument is\n\nbased on competent and pertinent evidence.\" Nicholas, 218 Ill. 2d at 121-22. In Nicholas, the\n\ncourt found no error when the prosecutor argued, \" 'And when she screams, please, don't, he\n\npulls the trigger, and pulls the trigger again, and pulls the trigger again, and pulls the trigger\n\nagain, pure evil.' \" Nicholas, 218 Ill. 2d at 113. \"Pure evil\" referred to the defendant's actions of\n\ngetting his gun, hunting his mother in the street, shooting her four times, stashing the gun,\n\n\n                                                 -47-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nreturning to bed, and displaying little concern about her death. Nicholas, 218 Ill. 2d at 113.\n\n       Here, the State claims that the words \"monster\" and \"evil\" accurately describe\n\ndefendant's actions. Further, defendant injected the term \"monster\" into the proceedings by\n\ncalling himself that in his note to Scacchitti and in his videotaped statement. Indeed, the\n\nprosecutor stated more than once in closing that it was defendant who called himself a monster.\n\nIn addition, the comment about the \"blame game\" was directed at defendant's statement that he\n\nsaw his mother's face immediately before he stabbed Mary, and it responds to a major theme in\n\nhis case, i.e., that he was less culpable because of the abuse he suffered as a child. The State\n\nclarified this position when it next stated, \"Really? That's an insult to anybody who ever had a\n\ntough childhood.\"\n\n       Defendant also argues that the State mocked his defense and ridiculed defense counsel.\n\nThe prosecutor commented regarding defense counsel's cross-examination of the State's DNA\n\nexpert, \"In this case you heard a lot of questions about DNA ad nauseum\" and, \"So for all future\n\nrapists out there make sure you kill your victim.\" The State responds that the first comment was\n\nan accurate description of the cross-examination because defense counsel spent a considerable\n\namount of time questioning the forensic scientist regarding the statistical information linking\n\ndefendant's DNA profile to the material recovered from Mary's body. It further contends that it\n\nwas responding to the defense theory by conveying the strength of the scientific evidence that\n\ndefendant was ignoring. Regarding the second comment, it was made in response to defendant's\n\nargument, which was the same as that before this court, that sexually assaulting a dead person\n\ndoes not constitute sexual assault. The assistant State's Attorney's argument expressed the same\n\n\n                                               -48-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nconcern as did the court in McLaughlin, 265 S.W.3d at 268-69, as previously discussed. In any\n\nevent, the trial court sustained defendant's objection.\n\n       Defendant also contends that the State \"mocked the very idea to raising defenses to the\n\nnon-murder charges.\" For example, the prosecutor argued:\n\n               \"If Nicholas Gutierrez or when Nicholas Gutierrez murdered Mary\n\n       Stachowicz and stuck her in the floor boards, Mary Stachowicz still–the only one\n\n       that could have stopped Nicholas Gutierrez from taking that purse was Mary\n\n       Stachowicz. How did he stop her from doing that? By killing her and putting her\n\n       in the floor boards. That doesn't give you a free robbery to go down--a free crime\n\n       to go down and take the property.\"\n\nDefendant argues that characterized the defense mounted as a \"request for a free crime.\" See\n\nPeople v. Kuntu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2166993\"><a href=\"/opinion/2166993/people-v-kuntu/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 (2001) (the trial court erred in allowing the State to argue\n\nthat not sentencing the defendant to death would be like giving him five free murders). The\n\nState contends that it was simply responding to defendant's theory and explaining that the\n\napplication of force can occur before or after the taking of the property as long as it is part of a\n\ncontinuous course of conduct. Further, the jury acquitted defendant of robbery and armed\n\nrobbery, so it is unclear how this comment could have prejudiced him.\n\n       Finally, defendant claims that the State twice improperly referred to his defense as\n\n\"splitting hairs.\" The State responds that it was properly challenging the credibility of his theory\n\nas he attempted to parse out the force requirement of different offenses in an effort to eliminate\n\nhis guilt on all offenses.

Sentence\n\n       Defendant argues that the trial court, in sentencing him to life imprisonment for the\n\nmurder, failed to give adequate weight to the mitigating factors of his age, lack of significant\n\ncriminal history, abusive childhood, mental illnesses stemming from that abuse, and\n\nrehabilitative potential. Defendant requests that this court reduce his sentence pursuant to\n\nSupreme Court Rule 615(b)(4) (134 Ill. 2d R. 615(b)(4)).\n\n       The sentencing decisions of a trial court are entitled to great deference and weight\n\nbecause \"a trial judge is in a far better position than an appellate court to fashion an appropriate\n\nsentence\" based on firsthand consideration of the defendant's credibility, demeanor, moral\n\ncharacter, and other relevant factors.

At\n\nthe time of the murder, he was 19 years old and was, according to defendant, \"finally on the path\n\nto maturity and independence.\" He contends that a defendant's youth, standing alone, is an\n\nimportant mitigating factor.

However, the supreme court has rejected the use\n\nof comparative sentencing from unrelated cases as a basis for claiming that a particular sentence\n\nis excessive or that the judge abused his discretion.

If a sentence is appropriate given the particular facts of that case, it\n\nmay not be attacked on the ground that a lesser sentence was imposed in a similar, but unrelated,\n\ncase.\" Fern, 189 Ill. 2d at 62.\n\n       Next, defendant argues that his childhood was characterized by abuse and neglect, which\n\nfurther mitigated his sentence. While the State minimizes the evidence of abuse, claiming that\n\n\n                                                -51-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nCarol Garza testified about five acts of \"possible abuse or neglect,\" the evidence seems clear\n\nthat he had a tumultuous, abusive childhood. The evidence also showed that after defendant\n\nwas taken away from his mother, he spent time at nine difference facilities.\n\n       In the presentence investigation (PSI) report, defendant reported being sexually abused\n\nby a babysitter and his mother's boyfriends. A few times, his mother made him drink until he\n\npassed out, and when he was nine, his mother beat him until he passed out. He had to observe\n\nhis mother having sex and saw two men murdered by his mother's boyfriend.\n\n       Defendant cites People v. Margentina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2219033\"><a href=\"/opinion/2219033/people-v-lann/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 247 (1994), in support of his\n\nargument. In Margentina, the Third District found that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nsentencing the defendant to 50 years for murder where he was 18 years old at the time of the\n\nmurder, was raised in a \"terrible\" environment, and was provoked. While defendant here had a\n\ntumultuous childhood and was only 19 at the time of the murder, it is doubtful that he was\n\nprovoked. In his statements to the police, defendant claimed that Mary followed him up the\n\nstairs to his apartment and asked, \"Why don't you like girls? Why do you fuck boys?\" Mary's\n\nfamily, however, testified that they never heard Mary use such language. Even assuming that\n\nevents unfolded as defendant claimed, his action of grabbing Mary and dragging her into the\n\napartment was disproportionate to what she did. Therefore, Margentina is distinguishable.\n\n       Defendant also claims that he shows \"promising rehabilitation potential\" because the\n\nonly tickets he received in jail arose from instances where an entire tier was ticketed; he was\n\nhoused in the \"Christian deck\"; and at the time of the offense, he had helped out at the funeral\n\nhome for two years and then found his own job at Subway. He also touts his lack of significant\n\n\n                                               -52-\n\f1-07-2516\n\ncriminal history. However, while he was not charged with and convicted of a plethora of violent\n\ncrimes, his background shows violent tendencies.\n\n       Most important, the trial court specifically discussed the evidence that defendant\n\npresented in mitigation. The judge noted defendant's age at the time of the murder; his good\n\nbehavior in jail; his early placements in DCFS, where \"there was very little, if any, supervision\n\nof these young children\"; the impeachment of Sharon E.; and the physical and sexual abuse he\n\nexperienced as a child. The court found, however, that the most significant factor in aggravation\n\nwas \"the actual facts of the case.\" In determining a sentence, the trial court must balance the\n\ninterests of society against the ability of a defendant to be rehabilitated. People v. Tye, 323 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 872, 890 (2001). However, a trial court is not required to give greater weight to the\n\nrehabilitative potential of a defendant than to the seriousness of the offense. Govea, 299 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 91. In fact, the seriousness of the crime committed is considered the most important\n\nfactor in fashioning an appropriate sentence. Tye, 323 Ill. App. 3d at 890. The trial court\n\ncorrectly noted the seriousness of the crime.\n\n       Because defendant's sentence is within the statutory requirements and the trial court\n\nconsidered all factors in sentencing defendant, we affirm his sentence of life imprisonment.\n\n                                                F. Mittimus\n\n       In a supplemental brief, defendant argues that his mittimus should be corrected to reflect\n\nthe three-year sentence for concealment of a homicidal death that was orally imposed by the\n\ncourt. The State concedes that the mittimus should be corrected. Accordingly, pursuant to\n\nSupreme Court Rule 615(b)(1) (134 Ill. 2d R. 615(b)(1)), we order the clerk of the circuit court\n\n\n                                                -53-\n\f1-07-2516\n\nto make the necessary correction. See People v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395 (2007).\n\n                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentence. We also\n\norder that defendant's mittimus be corrected to reflect a sentence of three years for concealment\n\nof a homicidal death.\n\n       Affirmed; mittimus corrected.\n\n       QUINN and COLEMAN, J.J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -54-\n\f             1-07-2516\n\nPlease Use                     REPORTER OF DECISIONS – ILLINOIS APPELLATE COURT\nFollowing                                (Front Sheet to be Attached to Each Case)\nForm:\n\nComple te\nTITLE\nof Case                  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,\n\n                                                                                                        Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\n                         v.\n\n                         NICHOLAS GUTIERREZ,\n\n                                                                                                        Defendant-Appellant.\n                                                               Nos. 1-07-2516\nDocket No.                                                    Appellate Court of Illinois\n                                                            First District, THIRD Division\nCOURT\n                                                                     June 30, 2010\nOpinion                                                         (modified upon rehearing)\nFiled                                                            (Give month, day and year)\n\n\n                                PRESIDING JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the court:\nJUSTICES\n                                Quinn   and Coleman, JJ.,                                                      concur [s]\n\n\n\n\n                                         Lower Court and T rial Judge(s) in form indicated in the margin:\n\nAPPEAL from\nthe Circuit Ct. of              The Honorable             William G.
