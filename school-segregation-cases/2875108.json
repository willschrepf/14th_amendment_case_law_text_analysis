Smith brought suit against the City of Des Moines,\nclaiming that he was fired from his position as a city firefighter in\nviolation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29\nU.S.C. §§ 621-634 (1994), and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990\n(ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (1994).           The District Court1 granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the city on all of Smith's claims.         Smith\nappeals, and we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n     The Honorable Harold D. Vietor, United States District Judge\nfor the Southern District of Iowa.\n\f                                     I.\n\n\n     At the time of his dismissal, Smith had been a firefighter with the\nDes Moines Fire Department for thirty-three years and had risen to the rank\nof fire captain.   In 1988, the city began to require annual testing of all\nfirefighters at the rank of captain or below to determine whether they\ncould safely fight fires while wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus\n(SCBA).      Each firefighter underwent spirometry testing, which gauges\npulmonary function by measuring the capacity of the lungs to exhale.    Any\nfirefighter whose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) exceeded\n70% of lung capacity was approved to wear a SCBA.   If a firefighter scored\nless than 70%, he or she was required to take a maximum exercise stress\ntest, which measures the capacity of the body to use oxygen effectively.\nThe city required firefighters to establish a maximum oxygen uptake (VO2\nmax) of at least 33.5 milliliters per minute per kilogram of body weight\nin order to pass the stress test.\n\n\n     Smith failed both tests in 1988 and was not approved to wear a SCBA\nthat year.    In 1989, 1990, and 1991, Smith passed the spirometry test and\nwas approved for SCBA use.      In August 1992, Smith narrowly failed the\nspirometry test and was referred to Dr. Steven K. Zorn, a consultant to the\ncity, for further testing.       In Dr. Zorn's office, Smith passed the\nspirometry test but registered a VO2 max of only 22.2 on the stress test.\nThe fire department placed Smith on sick leave.     In January 1993, Smith\nreturned to Dr. Zorn but scored only 21.1 on a stress test.       The fire\ndepartment offered to allow Smith to remain on sick leave until April, when\nhe would turn age fifty-five and thus be eligible for retirement.\n\n\n     In the interim, the fire department sent Smith to another physician,\nDr. John Glazier, for a second opinion.    Additionally, when Smith did not\nfile for retirement in April, the fire chief\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\ffiled an application for disability retirement on Smith's behalf.                 Before\nruling on this application, the state pension board required Smith to be\nexamined by a panel of three additional physicians.              Dr. Glazier did not\nperform a stress test, but the panel of three physicians did (Smith's VO2\nmax was 28.9).     All four physicians concluded that Smith was physically\ncapable   of    working      as   a   firefighter.        After     receiving     these\nrecommendations, the pension board denied the application for disability\nretirement,    finding     that   Smith   was   not   disabled   from   working    as   a\nfirefighter.\n\n\n     The fire department did not permit Smith to return to work but did\noffer to place him on leave of absence with benefits until July 1, 1994,\nwhen he would be eligible for maximum pension benefits.             Smith did not file\nfor retirement at that time, however, and the city discharged him on July\n18, 1994 for failure to meet the fire department's physical fitness\nstandards.\n\n\n     After     obtaining    right-to-sue    letters    from   the   Equal   Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, Smith\nbrought suit against the city in federal district court, raising claims\nunder the ADEA, the ADA, and the Iowa Civil Rights Act, Iowa Code Ann.\n§§ 216.01-.20 (West 1994 & Supp. 1996).         The District Court granted summary\njudgment in favor of the city on all counts.             The court, assuming Smith\ncould establish that the city's testing standards have a disparate impact\non older firefighters, held that the city had established a \"business\nnecessity\" defense because firefighters require \"a high standard of\nphysical fitness.\"         Similarly, Smith's ADEA disparate treatment claim\nfailed because he was not qualified for the job, and the state law claim\nfailed because Iowa law mirrors federal law.               The District Court also\nconcluded that Smith did not have a disability and granted summary judgment\nfor the city on his ADA claim.        Smith's appeal raises only the disparate\nimpact and ADA claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f        We have jurisdiction over Smith's appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291\n(1994).    Our review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo.          Krenik v.\nCounty of Le Sueur, 47 F.3d 953, 959-60 (8th Cir. 1995).             We will affirm\n\"only if the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving    party   and   giving   the   nonmoving   party   the   benefit    of   all\nreasonable factual inferences, shows no genuine issue of material fact and\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"                 Weber v.\nAmerican Express Co., 994 F.2d 513, 515 (8th Cir. 1993).\n\n\n                                          II.\n\n\n                                          A.\n\n\n        We consider first the city's argument, which the District Court\nrejected, that a claim of disparate impact is not cognizable under the\nADEA.     Disparate impact claims challenge \"'employment practices that are\nfacially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact\nfall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by\nbusiness necessity.'\"      Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 609 (1993)\n(quoting International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324,\n335-36 n.15 (1977)).         A disparate impact plaintiff need not prove a\ndiscriminatory motive.      Id.\n\n\n        Like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to which the\ndisparate impact theory was first applied in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401\nU.S. 424 (1971), the ADEA contains two prohibitions relevant here:\n\n\n        It shall be unlawful for an employer--\n\n              (1) to    fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n        individual or    otherwise discriminate against any individual\n        with respect     to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n        privileges of   employment, because of such individual's age;\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f           (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any\n     way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n     employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\n     status as an employee, because of such individual's age . . . .\n\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a) (1994).\n\n\n     We have on several occasions applied disparate impact analysis to age\ndiscrimination claims.     See Houghton v. SIPCO, Inc., 38 F.3d 953, 958-59\n(8th Cir. 1994) (reversing plaintiff's verdict because of erroneous jury\ninstruction); Nolting v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., 799 F.2d 1192, 1196-99\n(8th Cir. 1986) (affirming judgment for defendant); Leftwich v. Harris-\nStowe State College, 702 F.2d 686, 690-93 (8th Cir. 1983) (affirming\njudgment for plaintiff).\n\n\n     Several years ago, in a disparate treatment case under the ADEA, the\nSupreme Court noted that it had never decided whether a disparate impact\ntheory is available under the ADEA.     Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610.   In a\nconcurring opinion, three Justices stated that \"there are substantial\narguments that it is improper to carry over disparate impact analysis from\nTitle VII to the ADEA.\"      Id. at 618 (Kennedy, J., concurring).      Other\nlanguage in the lead opinion can be read as a suggestion by the Court that\nthe ADEA does not permit disparate impact actions.         See id. at 610\n(\"Disparate treatment, thus defined, captures the essence of what Congress\nsought to prohibit in the ADEA.\"); id. at 611 (\"When the employer's\ndecision is wholly motivated by factors other than age, the problem of\ninaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes disappears.\").\n\n\n     Before the Supreme Court decided Hazen Paper, many courts of appeals\nhad recognized a disparate impact theory under the ADEA.       See EEOC v.\nFrancis W. Parker Sch., 41 F.3d 1073, 1079 n.1 (7th Cir. 1994) (Cudahy, J.,\ndissenting), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2577 (1995).      Since Hazen Paper,\nseveral circuits have revisited the issue.       See DiBiase v. SmithKline\nBeecham Corp., 48 F.3d 719, 732-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f34 (3d Cir.) (opinion of Greenberg, J., alone) (doubting disparate impact\ntheory cognizable), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 306 (1995); Lyon v. Ohio Educ.\nAss'n & Prof'l Staff Union, 53 F.3d 135, 139 n.5 (6th Cir. 1995) (noting\ndoubt as to disparate impact theory); Francis W. Parker Sch., 41 F.3d at\n1076-78 (suggesting disparate impact theory not cognizable); Mangold v.\nCalifornia      Pub.   Utils.   Comm'n,   67   F.3d   1470,   1474   (9th   Cir.   1995)\n(suggesting disparate impact theory is cognizable); Ellis v. United\nAirlines, Inc., 73 F.3d 999, 1007-10 & n.12 (10th Cir.) (holding disparate\nimpact theory not cognizable under § 623(a)(1) and suggesting it is not\ncognizable under § 623(a)(2)), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 2500 (1996).2\n\n\n        Our opinion in Houghton, however, postdated Hazen Paper and continued\nto recognize the viability of disparate impact actions under the ADEA.               See\nHoughton, 38 F.3d at 958-59.3       As a result, even if we believed that Hazen\nPaper       cast doubt on the validity of Leftwich and Nolting, Houghton\nrepresents the law of this Circuit,\n\n\n\n\n            2\n       Some confusion has resulted from a difference between the\nADEA and Title VII. Section 623(a)(2) of the ADEA governs employer\nconduct with respect to \"employees\" only, while the parallel\nprovision of Title VII protects \"employees or applicants for\nemployment.\" Compare 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2) (1994) with 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a)(2) (1994). Because Francis W. Parker School and Ellis\nwere disparate impact actions involving applicants for employment,\nthe plaintiffs in those cases were limited to relying on\n§ 623(a)(1), which covers employees and applicants.\n\n     In this case, because Smith was an employee of the city, he\nmay rely on either subsection of section 623(a). Our opinion in\nLeftwich (involving an applicant) established that a plaintiff may\nbase a disparate impact claim on § 623(a)(1). Leftwich, 702 F.2d\nat 690. And the Supreme Court has made it clear in the Title VII\ncontext that the second subsection can be the basis for such a\nclaim. See, e.g., Lorance v. AT&T Techs., Inc., 490 U.S. 900, 904\n(1989); Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 448-49 (1982); Griggs,\n401 U.S. at 426 n.1.\n        3\n      Like this case, Houghton involved incumbent employees. Id.\nat 956. The opinion does not specify the subsection of § 623(a) on\nwhich the disparate impact action was premised.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fwhich we follow absent a \"clear indication\" that it has been overruled.\nFDIC v. Bowles Livestock Comm'n Co., 937 F.2d 1350, 1354 (8th Cir. 1991).\nWe conclude that disparate impact claims under the ADEA are cognizable.\n\n\n                                      B.\n\n\n      We assume, as the District Court did, that Smith has established a\nprima facie case of disparate impact, that is, that he has demonstrated\n\"that a facially neutral employment practice actually operates to exclude\nfrom a job a disproportionate number of persons protected by the ADEA.\"\nLeftwich, 702 F.2d at 690.   We therefore turn to Smith's argument that the\nDistrict Court erroneously granted summary judgment to the city based on\nthe so-called \"business necessity\" defense.\n\n\n      This defense is derived in part from the cases in which the Supreme\nCourt developed the disparate impact doctrine under Title VII, see, e.g.,\nDothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 332 n.14 (1977) (physical requirements\nfor prison guards with disparate impact on women \"must be shown to be\nnecessary to safe and efficient job performance\"), and in part from a\nprovision of the ADEA which states that an employment practice is not\nunlawful \"where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other\nthan age.\"   29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1) (1994).4    We recognize that in the Title\nVII   context   the   business   necessity   defense   has   undergone   several\ntransformations in recent years.    See Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490\nU.S. 642, 659 (1989) (placing burden of persuasion on\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      Title VII contains no provision parallel to the \"reasonable\nfactors other than age\" language in the ADEA.       See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(e) (1994). Nevertheless, the EEOC, as amicus curiae and\nin its regulations interpreting the ADEA, suggests that the\nbusiness necessity defense is the same under Title VII and the\nADEA. See 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7(d)-(e) (1995). For reasons that will\nbe made clear in the text of this opinion, we need not decide this\nissue in this case.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fplaintiff and broadening the defense); Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L.\nNo. 102-166, § 105, 105 Stat. 1071, 1074-75 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(k) (1994)) (attempting to restore pre-Wards Cove law).           Our most recent\nADEA disparate impact opinion reflected the shift to the Wards Cove\nstandard, see Houghton, 38 F.3d at 959, but we have not yet considered\nwhether the Civil Rights Act of 1991 has affected the ADEA's business\nnecessity defense.\n\n\n        We need not decide that issue in this case.          In granting summary\njudgment for the city, the District Court clearly placed the burden of\npersuasion on the city in a manner consistent with the pre-Wards Cove\nstandard.     For purposes of our analysis, we therefore assume, without\ndeciding, that pre-Wards Cove law--the law most favorable to Smith--applies\nhere.    In the context of a physical job requirement, the pre-Wards Cove\nbusiness necessity defense places the burden of persuasion on the defendant\nto show that the requirement has \"a manifest relationship to the employment\nin question,\" Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432, and that it is \"necessary to safe\nand efficient job performance.\"        Dothard, 433 U.S. at 332 n.14.    See McCosh\nv. City of Grand Forks, 628 F.2d 1058, 1062 (8th Cir. 1980) (applying this\ntest to Title VII case involving job requirements for police sergeants);\nFitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1119 (11th Cir. 1993)\n(holding,    in   Title   VII   case   involving   firefighters   and   SCBAs,   that\n\"[m]easures demonstrably necessary to meeting the goal of ensuring worker\nsafety are therefore deemed to be 'required by business necessity'\").\n\n\n        It follows that the city, as the party with the burden of persuasion\non the business necessity defense, was required to support its summary\njudgment motion \"with evidence that would entitle it to a directed verdict\nif not controverted at trial.\"         Firemen's Fund Ins. Co. v. Thien, 8 F.3d\n1307, 1310 (8th Cir. 1993) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n331 (1986) (Brennan, J., dissenting)).         If the city met that burden, the\nburden of production then shifted to the nonmoving party, Smith, to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fshow the existence of a genuine issue of fact for trial.           Id.   Using this\nframework, we review Smith's objections to the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n       We conclude that the city met its burden on the business necessity\ndefense by supporting its motion with evidence that would entitle it to a\ndirected verdict if not controverted by evidence sufficient to create a\njury issue.   On the job-relatedness issue, the city presented undisputed\nevidence   that   a   captain   is   frequently   involved   in   fire   suppression\nactivities when a company arrives at a fire scene and that the captain\nwears a SCBA under those circumstances.        Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 157-59,\n302.    This evidence alone is sufficient to carry the city's burden of\nshowing that its fitness standard has a \"manifest relationship\" to the\nposition in question.     Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432.\n\n\n       The other element of the defense is whether the standard is necessary\nto safe and effective job performance.        The city's evidence on this issue\nis more complicated and begins with some of the extensive regulations\ngoverning the manner in which the city operates its fire department.\nFederal regulations require the fire department to provide firefighters\nwith SCBAs \"when such equipment is necessary to protect the health of the\nemployee.\"    29 C.F.R. § 1910.134(a)(2) (1995).5       The city may not assign\nfirefighters to tasks requiring use of a SCBA unless they are \"physically\nable to perform the work and use the equipment.\"         Id. § 1910.134(b)(10).\nThe city must review the medical status of SCBA users periodically.

Code r. 347-10.20(88) (1996).\n\n                                        -9-\n\ftesting as a screening mechanism for SCBA users and suggests stress testing\nfor persons who use SCBAs under strenuous conditions.      J.A. at 338.   ANSI\nrecommends a 70% FEV1 threshold for spirometry testing but does not specify\nan acceptable result for stress testing.     Id.\n\n\n      To reach its determination that a VO2 max of 33.5 was the appropriate\nthreshold for stress testing, the city relied on a review of the relevant\nmedical   literature by Dr. Zorn.       A number of studies suggest that\nfirefighters consume between 25 and 35 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram\nper minute while suppressing a fire.    J.A. at 200.   One study in particular\ninvolved 150 firefighters performing a series of tasks in a simulated fire-\nsuppression environment.        Id. at 212-22.     The authors of that study\ndetermined that a VO2 max of 33.5 was the minimum required to allow the\nfirefighters to complete the simulation successfully.       Id. at 218.   The\nauthors then repeated the simulation with 32 additional firefighters.     Id.\nOf those with a VO2 max less than 33.5, only 40% (4 of 10) completed the\nsimulation successfully.    Id.   On the other hand, of those with a VO2 max\nof 33.5 or more, 86% (19 of 22) completed the simulation successfully.6\nId.   After reviewing this study and others, Dr. Zorn concluded that 33.5\nwas the minimum satisfactory VO2 max requirement for the Des Moines\nfirefighters.     J.A. at 83.   This evidence would clearly be sufficient to\nentitle the city to a directed verdict on the issue of necessity if it were\nuncontroverted.    See Firemen's Fund, 8 F.3d at 1310.\n\n\n      We now turn to the evidence presented by Smith in opposition to the\ncity's summary judgment motion.     Smith does not dispute that firefighting\nis a strenuous occupation or that the city has a legitimate interest in\ndetermining whether its employees can\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      The city's brief repeatedly refers to this pass rate as \"at\nleast 70%.\" We are not sure why the city uses this figure, but it\nmakes little difference to our analysis whether the number is 70%\nor 86%.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fperform those duties safely.       On the issue of job-relatedness, he does\nargue that as a captain, he did not perform the same duties as a line\nfirefighter, and that the 33.5 threshold is therefore not related to his\nparticular position.     But as we noted above, it is undisputed that Smith\nand other captains do enter burning buildings and perform fire suppression\nactivities when their companies arrive at a fire scene; as Smith himself\nstated, \"if we were the first to arrive, I would don a mask, go right in\nand attack the fire.\"    J.A. at 301-02.      Although Smith also stated that he\nwould \"[v]ery seldom\" perform tasks like knocking down walls, id., this\nevidence is insufficient to create a jury issue on job-relatedness in light\nof the uncontroverted evidence that he was required to fight fires while\nwearing a SCBA.\n\n\n       On the issue of whether the requirement is necessary to safe and\neffective job performance, Smith argues that the opinions of the panel of\nphysicians who determined he was not disabled for purposes of disability\nbenefits, plus the opinion of Dr. Glazier that Smith is capable of\nperforming exertional tasks while wearing a SCBA, create a fact issue.          We\ndisagree.     We note first that these physicians examined Smith in the\ncontext of a disability retirement proceeding.           A member of a police or\nfire   department in Iowa is eligible for disability benefits if the\nexamining physicians certify \"that the member is mentally or physically\nincapacitated for further performance of duty, that the incapacity is\nlikely to be permanent, and that the member should be retired.\"          Iowa Code\nAnn.   §    411.6(3)   (West   Supp.   1996).     Even   though   the   disability\ndetermination was phrased in broader language than the statute (\"He does\nnot have any limitation which would preclude him from working as a\nfirefighter . . . and in our opinion he should be reinstated fully to work\nas a firefighter,\" J.A. at 360), the physicians' conclusions lack probative\nvalue on the relevant issue in this case:       whether the fitness standard set\nby the city is necessary to safe and efficient job performance.                The\nopinions of these physicians, aside from being geared to the question of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fSmith's    entitlement   to   disability   benefits,   do   not   appear   to   have\nconsidered the solid scientific studies on which the city based the 33.5\nVO2 max standard.7   Such evidence affords no basis for allowing a jury to\nsecond-guess the city's well-supported and reasonable conclusion that, in\nthe interest of the safety of its firefighters (including captains) and\ntheir effective job performance, the appropriate place to draw the line was\nat a VO2 max of 33.5.    We thus conclude that Smith has not demonstrated a\nfactual dispute on this issue.\n\n\n      To summarize our conclusions:        fitness and the ability to perform\nwhile wearing a SCBA are undoubtedly job-related and necessary requirements\nfor firefighters.    The dispute in this case is not whether firefighters\nmust be physically fit, but how fitness can be most appropriately measured\nand how the city may distinguish those firefighters who are probably\ncapable of performing the job from those firefighters who are probably not\ncapable.   The city has not proceeded arbitrarily, but rather has carefully\ndeveloped a standard based upon the available medical literature and using\nthe\n\n\n\n\n      7\n      Two members of the panel of three physicians later reviewed\nthe primary study, detailed above, on which the city relied in\nsetting the 33.5 VO2 max standard. They concluded:\n\n      Dr. Moseley and I do not believe that this study\n      justifies identifying Mr. Smith as unable to fulfill the\n      duties of a firefighter. In fact, Mr. Smith's exercise\n      capacity was 110% [of] predicted for his age and size.\n      I therefore believe that Mr. Smith is fully capable of\n      working as a firefighter and recommend that he return to\n      work.\n\nJ.A. at 361.     This evidence comes closer to addressing the\nnecessity of the 33.5 standard, but it is ultimately only an\nopinion that Smith be permitted an exception to the fire\ndepartment's policy. The physicians do not suggest that the study\nis inaccurate or that the fitness standard is unreasonable. We\nalso note that whether Smith's performance on the stress test\nexceeded the physicians' expectations is irrelevant.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fbest test available for measuring fitness, the stress test.8    J.A. at 81.\nThe literature indicates that a high proportion of firefighters with a VO2\nmax above 33.5 can perform fire suppression tasks successfully, but a much\nlower proportion of those with a VO2 max below 33.5 can do so.        Smith\nargues, and the physicians' evaluations suggest, that some firefighters\nwith lower VO2 max scores--Smith in particular--may be able to perform\ntheir jobs.   This may well be true, but the law does not require the city\nto put the lives of Smith and his fellow firefighters at risk by taking the\nchance that he is fit for duty when solid scientific studies indicate that\npersons with test results similar to his are not.    The lack of a precise\nor universally perfect fit between a job requirement and actual effective\nperformance is not fatal to a claim of business necessity, particularly\nwhen the public health and safety are at stake.    See McCosh, 628 F.2d at\n1062-63; cf. Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1120-21 (lack of unfortunate incidents\nin the past insufficient to create genuine issue of fact as to necessity\nof safety requirements).   We conclude that Smith has not met his burden of\npresenting a triable issue on the business necessity defense.\n\n\n                                     C.\n\n\n     Smith also argues that he presented evidence of an alternative means\nof assessing fitness that would have less of a disparate impact on older\nfirefighters.   In particular, he suggests that the city use the spirometry\nand stress tests to determine which firefighters may be unfit for the job,\nthen require those firefighters to undergo a physical examination and \"a\nbattery of\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Because the city is measuring fitness directly, this case is\ndistinguishable from Dothard, where the job (prison guard) required\na degree of strength but the defendants did not show any\ncorrelation between the requirements (minimum height and weight)\nand the strength required for the job. See Dothard, 433 U.S. at\n331.\n\n                                    -13-\n\ftests\" to determine whether they are actually fit for duty.      Appellant's\nBr. at 24.\n\n\n     We have not previously had the occasion to determine whether this\nbranch of the Title VII disparate impact doctrine applies to the ADEA.   For\npurposes of this appeal, however, we assume that the Title VII framework\napplies:    once the defendant has met its burden of demonstrating business\nnecessity, the plaintiff may still prevail by showing \"that other selection\ndevices without a similar discriminatory effect would also serve the\nemployer's legitimate interest in efficient and trustworthy workmanship.\"\nDothard, 433 U.S. at 329 (quotations omitted).         For several reasons,\nSmith's argument on this point is unavailing.\n\n\n     First, it does not appear from the record that Smith advanced this\nargument before the District Court.    We will not reverse a grant of summary\njudgment on the basis of an argument not presented below.         See, e.g.,\nO.R.S. Distilling Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp., 972 F.2d 924, 926 (8th Cir.\n1992).   Even if the argument were proper, however, Smith has not made any\nshowing that his proposed alternative (which is in any case rather vague)\nwould have less of a disparate impact on older firefighters than the city's\npresent system does.   At most, Smith has asserted that he would be able to\npass his proposed battery of tests, but he has not shown the effect of his\nsystem on other firefighters.    Nor has he shown that his more subjective\napproach would serve the city's legitimate interest in the fitness of its\nfirefighters as well as the current system.     Smith has failed to raise a\ngenuine issue of material fact on this branch of the disparate impact\ndoctrine.\n\n\n                                      III.\n\n\n     Finally, we consider the District Court's grant of summary judgment\nin favor of the city on Smith's ADA claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f       The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating 'against a\n       qualified individual with a disability because of the\n       disability of such individual.'     42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).    A\n       plaintiff seeking relief under the ADA must establish that he\n       is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA, that he is\n       qualified to perform the essential functions of his job either\n       with or without reasonable accommodation, and that he was\n       terminated because of his disability.\n\n\nWooten v. Farmland Foods, 58 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir. 1995).        The ADA\ndefines \"disability\" with respect to an individual as follows:\n\n\n       (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits\n       one or more of the major life activities of such individual;\n\n       (B) a record of such an impairment; or\n\n       (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) (1994).        Because the fire department filed for\ndisability retirement on his behalf, Smith claims that the city regards him\nas having a disability.     The parties agree that Smith is not in fact\ndisabled.   Amend. Compl. ¶ 26; Answer ¶ 20.\n\n\n       We rejected a claim similar to Smith's in Wooten.   In that case, we\nrecognized that \"working\" is a \"major life activity\" that, if substantially\nlimited by an impairment, brings an individual within the protection of the\nADA.   Wooten, 58 F.3d at 385-86.    We also held, however, that \"'working'\ndoes not mean working at a particular job of that person's choice\" and\nrecognized that \"[a]n impairment that disqualifies a person from only a\nnarrow range of jobs is not considered a substantially limiting one.\"   Id.\nat 386 (quotation omitted); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (1996)\n(\"The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a\nsubstantial limitation in the major life activity of working.\").    We then\napplied these principles to a \"regarded as\" situation in which Wooten\nclaimed that his former employer regarded\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fhim as having a disability, and we affirmed a grant of summary judgment for\nthe employer.   Wooten, 58 F.3d at 386.\n\n\n     Smith's claim fails for the same reasons that Wooten's did.     Viewing\nthe record in the light most favorable to Smith, we see that the city\nregarded Smith as unable to perform the duties of a firefighter.   But Smith\ndoes not suggest that the city believed he was unable to perform other\njobs, and he has presented no evidence to support that proposition.       In\nfact, in a letter to Smith in December 1993, the fire chief recognized that\nSmith had gone back to school and had taken another job while he was on\nsick leave from the fire department.   J.A. at 267.   Smith failed to create\na genuine issue of fact as to whether the city regarded him as having a\ndisability for purposes of the ADA, and the District Court properly granted\nsummary judgment on this claim.\n\n\n                                   IV.\n\n\n     The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n     I concur in parts I, IIA, and III of the majority's opinion.          I\nrespectfully dissent, however, from the majority's conclusion in parts IIB\nand IIC that the city was entitled to summary judgment on Smith's age\ndiscrimination claim.   I certainly agree that a high level of physical\nfitness is related to the job of a firefighter and that the city must\ndevelop a policy that ensures safe and efficient job performance.       In my\nview, however, the city has not adequately demonstrated that its fitness\nstandard has a manifest relationship to the duties of a fire captain.    Nor\nhas the city produced sufficient evidence to support a finding that its\npolicy of dismissing all employees who fail to meet the standard is\nnecessary for their safe and efficient job performance.   Moreover, contrary\nto the majority's position, the opinions of four\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fphysicians who independently examined Smith and determined that he was fit\nto perform his firefighting duties, directly rebut the necessity of the\ncity's policy.      At a minimum, therefore, I do not agree that summary\njudgment was appropriate for Smith's age discrimination claim and would\nremand to the district court for a full trial on the merits.\n\n\n        To prevail in its business necessity defense, the city must validate\nits    fitness   test    for    job-relatedness     to   the    particular     skills       and\nexertional requirements of a fire captain, the position at issue in this\ncase.    See Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 431, 45 L.Ed. 2d\n280, 304 (1975).         As the ANSI report recommends, for a proper fitness\nevaluation, an examiner must consider meaningful work-related information,\nincluding the type of activity to be performed, the level and duration of\neffort required.        (J.A. at 336.)\n\n\n        To justify its fitness standard, the city relies solely on Dr. Zorn's\nconclusion based on his review of a report of a study in which he did not\nparticipate.       The    study    tested     the   ability    of    a    sample    group    of\nfirefighters to complete a series of tasks that were \"designed to simulate\nthe duration, intensity, and types of tasks that are performed during\nfirefighting.\"    (J.A. at 215.)         As the majority states, a fire captain is\nfrequently involved in fire suppression activities when a company arrives\nat a fire scene.    Yet, as both Chief Phillips and Chief Morgan testified,\na fire captain spends much less time in the structure fighting the fire\nthan    firefighters      and    the    captain's    main     role   is    directing,       not\nparticipating in, the fire suppression.              (J.A. at 151, 170.)            Dr. Zorn\nacknowledged     that     it    would   be   \"reasonable\"      to    adjust   the    fitness\nrequirements for different positions, depending on the amount of time each\nposition spends suppressing the fire.           He left those decisions to the fire\ndepartment.      (J.A. at 130.)         The city has made no attempt to link its\nfitness standard specifically to\n\n\n\n\n                                             -17-\n\fthe job requirements of a fire captain.              Thus, the standard cannot be\njustified as a business necessity.\n\n\n        Even if a fitness standard for firefighters could justify the\ndismissal of a fire captain, there is conflicting evidence in the record\nas to whether the test used and the specific fitness level set by the city\nare reasonable.         After reviewing the study and discussing its findings with\nDr. Zorn, Dr. Schwartz wrote to the fire department:               \"Dr. Moseley and I\ndo not believe that this study justifies identifying Mr. Smith as unable\nto fulfill the duties of a firefighter.\"             (J.A. at 361.)        Dr. Schwartz\ntestified that the VO2 minimums set by the city are unreasonable and that,\nin his opinion, the city should not rely on a single test for its fitness\nevaluation.      (J.A. at 179-80.)        With this conflicting evidence as to the\nvalidation of the standard, Smith's claim should have survived summary\njudgment.\n\n\n        In addition to the insufficient evidence of a \"manifest relationship\"\nbetween the fitness standard and Smith's job requirements, the city has not\ndemonstrated the necessity of its policy requiring dismissal of all those\nwho fail the fitness test.          The city argues that its policy is necessary\nbecause       federal    regulations   and   ANSI   recommendations    require        fire\ndepartments to ensure the safety of its employees.                 Neither authority\nrequires as strict a policy as the city has adopted for its firefighters,\nhowever.       Moreover, the study on which the city relies for its standard\ndoes not recommend that employees failing to meet the standards be fired.\nRather, the study suggests that employees who cannot meet the standards be\ngiven     a    specialized     exercise    regime   to   improve   their     levels     of\ncardiopulmonary fitness.          As the authors of the study recognize,\n\n\n        policies that select and/or retain on the basis of fitness but\n        are not accompanied by programs emphasizing fitness may be\n        vulnerable to legal challenge. Initiating\n\n\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\f     entry expectations at a level allowing for a reasonable decline\n     with advancing age is one step but this should be accompanied\n     by weight control, exercise, and smoking cessation programs\n     with periodic individualized assessment.\n\n\n(J.A. at 221.)\n\n\nIn a letter to Dr. Zorn, Sothmann recommends:\n\n\n     a proactive approach where individuals below the expectation\n     are given time to improve through an established policy\n     negotiated by concerned parties (e.g. administration, union,\n     medical, human rights). An unwillingness to adhere or failure\n     to achieve the expectation should be treated on a case by case\n     basis with additional information to decide employment\n     implications.\n\n\n(J.A. at 256.)   The city did not implement these recommendations.     Where\na fitness test so disparately affects persons protected by the ADEA, the\ncity should at least attempt to minimize the effect by giving its employees\nan opportunity to improve their physical condition.\n\n\n     To further rebut the necessity of the city's fitness standard, Smith\nhas presented substantial evidence that, despite failing the city's test,\nhe was fit to perform firefighting duties.   Dr. Glazier, who examined Smith\nto provide a second opinion, stated that based on spirometric findings,\n\"[Smith] is capable of performing exertional tasks while wearing SCBA.\"\n(J.A. at 364.)   The three doctors who evaluated Smith for his disability\npension status thoroughly examined him.   Each concluded separately not only\nthat Smith was not disabled but also that he was fit to return to work as\na firefighter.   As the EEOC asserted in its amicus brief, the opinions of\nthe four doctors that Smith's cardiopulmonary capacity would not prevent\nhim from performing the duties of his job safely and efficiently is\nsufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the city's\nstandard is justified by business necessity.\n\n\n     The majority characterizes the dispute in this case as how fitness\ncan be \"most appropriately measured.\"     Rather, the real dispute is whether\nthe city's policy, which has a disparate impact on persons protected by the\nADEA, has a manifest relationship to the job of a fire captain and whether\n\n                                   -19-\n\fit is necessary for the safe and efficient performance of the captain's\njob.   In my view, plaintiff presents sufficient evidence to counter both\nelements   of   the   business   necessity   defense.   Thus,   Smith's   age\ndiscrimination claim should have survived summary judgment.\n\n\n       A true copy.\n\n\n            Attest:\n\n\n                 CLERK, U. S.

Smith brought suit against the City of Des Moines,\nclaiming that he was fired from his position as a city firefighter in\nviolation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29\nU.S.C. §§ 621-634 (1994), and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990\n(ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (1994).           The District Court1 granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the city on all of Smith's claims.         Smith\nappeals, and we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n     The Honorable Harold D. Vietor, United States District Judge\nfor the Southern District of Iowa.\n\f                                     I.\n\n\n     At the time of his dismissal, Smith had been a firefighter with the\nDes Moines Fire Department for thirty-three years and had risen to the rank\nof fire captain.   In 1988, the city began to require annual testing of all\nfirefighters at the rank of captain or below to determine whether they\ncould safely fight fires while wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus\n(SCBA).      Each firefighter underwent spirometry testing, which gauges\npulmonary function by measuring the capacity of the lungs to exhale.    Any\nfirefighter whose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) exceeded\n70% of lung capacity was approved to wear a SCBA.   If a firefighter scored\nless than 70%, he or she was required to take a maximum exercise stress\ntest, which measures the capacity of the body to use oxygen effectively.\nThe city required firefighters to establish a maximum oxygen uptake (VO2\nmax) of at least 33.5 milliliters per minute per kilogram of body weight\nin order to pass the stress test.\n\n\n     Smith failed both tests in 1988 and was not approved to wear a SCBA\nthat year.    In 1989, 1990, and 1991, Smith passed the spirometry test and\nwas approved for SCBA use.      In August 1992, Smith narrowly failed the\nspirometry test and was referred to Dr. Steven K. Zorn, a consultant to the\ncity, for further testing.       In Dr. Zorn's office, Smith passed the\nspirometry test but registered a VO2 max of only 22.2 on the stress test.\nThe fire department placed Smith on sick leave.     In January 1993, Smith\nreturned to Dr. Zorn but scored only 21.1 on a stress test.       The fire\ndepartment offered to allow Smith to remain on sick leave until April, when\nhe would turn age fifty-five and thus be eligible for retirement.\n\n\n     In the interim, the fire department sent Smith to another physician,\nDr. John Glazier, for a second opinion.    Additionally, when Smith did not\nfile for retirement in April, the fire chief\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\ffiled an application for disability retirement on Smith's behalf.                 Before\nruling on this application, the state pension board required Smith to be\nexamined by a panel of three additional physicians.              Dr. Glazier did not\nperform a stress test, but the panel of three physicians did (Smith's VO2\nmax was 28.9).     All four physicians concluded that Smith was physically\ncapable   of    working      as   a   firefighter.        After     receiving     these\nrecommendations, the pension board denied the application for disability\nretirement,    finding     that   Smith   was   not   disabled   from   working    as   a\nfirefighter.\n\n\n     The fire department did not permit Smith to return to work but did\noffer to place him on leave of absence with benefits until July 1, 1994,\nwhen he would be eligible for maximum pension benefits.             Smith did not file\nfor retirement at that time, however, and the city discharged him on July\n18, 1994 for failure to meet the fire department's physical fitness\nstandards.\n\n\n     After     obtaining    right-to-sue    letters    from   the   Equal   Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, Smith\nbrought suit against the city in federal district court, raising claims\nunder the ADEA, the ADA, and the Iowa Civil Rights Act, Iowa Code Ann.\n§§ 216.01-.20 (West 1994 & Supp. 1996).         The District Court granted summary\njudgment in favor of the city on all counts.             The court, assuming Smith\ncould establish that the city's testing standards have a disparate impact\non older firefighters, held that the city had established a \"business\nnecessity\" defense because firefighters require \"a high standard of\nphysical fitness.\"         Similarly, Smith's ADEA disparate treatment claim\nfailed because he was not qualified for the job, and the state law claim\nfailed because Iowa law mirrors federal law.               The District Court also\nconcluded that Smith did not have a disability and granted summary judgment\nfor the city on his ADA claim.        Smith's appeal raises only the disparate\nimpact and ADA claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f        We have jurisdiction over Smith's appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291\n(1994).

Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610.   In a\nconcurring opinion, three Justices stated that \"there are substantial\narguments that it is improper to carry over disparate impact analysis from\nTitle VII to the ADEA.\"      Id. at 618 (Kennedy, J., concurring).

See\nHoughton, 38 F.3d at 958-59.3       As a result, even if we believed that Hazen\nPaper       cast doubt on the validity of Leftwich and Nolting, Houghton\nrepresents the law of this Circuit,\n\n\n\n\n            2\n       Some confusion has resulted from a difference between the\nADEA and Title VII. Section 623(a)(2) of the ADEA governs employer\nconduct with respect to \"employees\" only, while the parallel\nprovision of Title VII protects \"employees or applicants for\nemployment.\" Compare 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2) (1994) with 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a)(2) (1994). Because Francis W. Parker School and Ellis\nwere disparate impact actions involving applicants for employment,\nthe plaintiffs in those cases were limited to relying on\n§ 623(a)(1), which covers employees and applicants.\n\n     In this case, because Smith was an employee of the city, he\nmay rely on either subsection of section 623(a). Our opinion in\nLeftwich (involving an applicant) established that a plaintiff may\nbase a disparate impact claim on § 623(a)(1). Leftwich, 702 F.2d\nat 690. And the Supreme Court has made it clear in the Title VII\ncontext that the second subsection can be the basis for such a\nclaim. See, e.g., Lorance v. AT&T Techs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112282\"><a href=\"/opinion/112282/lorance-v-att-technologies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 904\n(1989); Connecticut v.

We therefore turn to Smith's argument that the\nDistrict Court erroneously granted summary judgment to the city based on\nthe so-called \"business necessity\" defense.\n\n\n      This defense is derived in part from the cases in which the Supreme\nCourt developed the disparate impact doctrine under Title VII, see, e.g.,\nDothard v. Rawlinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109725\"><a href=\"/opinion/109725/dothard-v-rawlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 n.14 (1977) (physical requirements\nfor prison guards with disparate impact on women \"must be shown to be\nnecessary to safe and efficient job performance\"), and in part from a\nprovision of the ADEA which states that an employment practice is not\nunlawful \"where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other\nthan age.\"   29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1) (1994).4    We recognize that in the Title\nVII   context   the   business   necessity   defense   has   undergone   several\ntransformations in recent years.

Nevertheless, the EEOC, as amicus curiae and\nin its regulations interpreting the ADEA, suggests that the\nbusiness necessity defense is the same under Title VII and the\nADEA.

For reasons that will\nbe made clear in the text of this opinion, we need not decide this\nissue in this case.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fplaintiff and broadening the defense); Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.

Our most recent\nADEA disparate impact opinion reflected the shift to the Wards Cove\nstandard, see Houghton, 38 F.3d at 959, but we have not yet considered\nwhether the Civil Rights Act of 1991 has affected the ADEA's business\nnecessity defense.\n\n\n        We need not decide that issue in this case.          In granting summary\njudgment for the city, the District Court clearly placed the burden of\npersuasion on the city in a manner consistent with the pre-Wards Cove\nstandard.     For purposes of our analysis, we therefore assume, without\ndeciding, that pre-Wards Cove law--the law most favorable to Smith--applies\nhere.    In the context of a physical job requirement, the pre-Wards Cove\nbusiness necessity defense places the burden of persuasion on the defendant\nto show that the requirement has \"a manifest relationship to the employment\nin question,\" Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432, and that it is \"necessary to safe\nand efficient job performance.\"        Dothard, 433 U.S. at 332 n.14.

Id.   Using this\nframework, we review Smith's objections to the District Court's grant of\nsummary judgment.\n\n\n       We conclude that the city met its burden on the business necessity\ndefense by supporting its motion with evidence that would entitle it to a\ndirected verdict if not controverted by evidence sufficient to create a\njury issue.   On the job-relatedness issue, the city presented undisputed\nevidence   that   a   captain   is   frequently   involved   in   fire   suppression\nactivities when a company arrives at a fire scene and that the captain\nwears a SCBA under those circumstances.        Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 157-59,\n302.    This evidence alone is sufficient to carry the city's burden of\nshowing that its fitness standard has a \"manifest relationship\" to the\nposition in question.     Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432.\n\n\n       The other element of the defense is whether the standard is necessary\nto safe and effective job performance.        The city's evidence on this issue\nis more complicated and begins with some of the extensive regulations\ngoverning the manner in which the city operates its fire department.\nFederal regulations require the fire department to provide firefighters\nwith SCBAs \"when such equipment is necessary to protect the health of the\nemployee.\"    29 C.F.R. § 1910.134(a)(2) (1995).5       The city may not assign\nfirefighters to tasks requiring use of a SCBA unless they are \"physically\nable to perform the work and use the equipment.\"         Id. § 1910.134(b)(10).\nThe city must review the medical status of SCBA users periodically.             Id.\nThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard on physical\nqualifications for respirator use recommends spirometry\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      The federal regulations do not apply to the city directly.\nSee 29 U.S.C. § 652(5) (1994) (excluding states and political\nsubdivisions from coverage of Occupational Safety and Health Act).\nThe Iowa occupational safety and health laws do apply to the city,\nhowever, Iowa Code Ann. § 88.3(5) (West Supp. 1996), and the\napplicable state regulations adopt the federal regulations by\nreference. Iowa Admin. Code r. 347-10.20(88) (1996).\n\n                                        -9-\n\ftesting as a screening mechanism for SCBA users and suggests stress testing\nfor persons who use SCBAs under strenuous conditions.      J.A. at 338.   ANSI\nrecommends a 70% FEV1 threshold for spirometry testing but does not specify\nan acceptable result for stress testing.     Id.\n\n\n      To reach its determination that a VO2 max of 33.5 was the appropriate\nthreshold for stress testing, the city relied on a review of the relevant\nmedical   literature by Dr. Zorn.       A number of studies suggest that\nfirefighters consume between 25 and 35 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram\nper minute while suppressing a fire.    J.A. at 200.   One study in particular\ninvolved 150 firefighters performing a series of tasks in a simulated fire-\nsuppression environment.        Id. at 212-22.     The authors of that study\ndetermined that a VO2 max of 33.5 was the minimum required to allow the\nfirefighters to complete the simulation successfully.       Id. at 218.   The\nauthors then repeated the simulation with 32 additional firefighters.     Id.\nOf those with a VO2 max less than 33.5, only 40% (4 of 10) completed the\nsimulation successfully.    Id.   On the other hand, of those with a VO2 max\nof 33.5 or more, 86% (19 of 22) completed the simulation successfully.6\nId.   After reviewing this study and others, Dr. Zorn concluded that 33.5\nwas the minimum satisfactory VO2 max requirement for the Des Moines\nfirefighters.     J.A. at 83.   This evidence would clearly be sufficient to\nentitle the city to a directed verdict on the issue of necessity if it were\nuncontroverted.    See Firemen's Fund, 8 F.3d at 1310.\n\n\n      We now turn to the evidence presented by Smith in opposition to the\ncity's summary judgment motion.     Smith does not dispute that firefighting\nis a strenuous occupation or that the city has a legitimate interest in\ndetermining whether its employees can\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      The city's brief repeatedly refers to this pass rate as \"at\nleast 70%.\" We are not sure why the city uses this figure, but it\nmakes little difference to our analysis whether the number is 70%\nor 86%.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fperform those duties safely.       On the issue of job-relatedness, he does\nargue that as a captain, he did not perform the same duties as a line\nfirefighter, and that the 33.5 threshold is therefore not related to his\nparticular position.     But as we noted above, it is undisputed that Smith\nand other captains do enter burning buildings and perform fire suppression\nactivities when their companies arrive at a fire scene; as Smith himself\nstated, \"if we were the first to arrive, I would don a mask, go right in\nand attack the fire.\"    J.A. at 301-02.      Although Smith also stated that he\nwould \"[v]ery seldom\" perform tasks like knocking down walls, id., this\nevidence is insufficient to create a jury issue on job-relatedness in light\nof the uncontroverted evidence that he was required to fight fires while\nwearing a SCBA.\n\n\n       On the issue of whether the requirement is necessary to safe and\neffective job performance, Smith argues that the opinions of the panel of\nphysicians who determined he was not disabled for purposes of disability\nbenefits, plus the opinion of Dr. Glazier that Smith is capable of\nperforming exertional tasks while wearing a SCBA, create a fact issue.          We\ndisagree.     We note first that these physicians examined Smith in the\ncontext of a disability retirement proceeding.           A member of a police or\nfire   department in Iowa is eligible for disability benefits if the\nexamining physicians certify \"that the member is mentally or physically\nincapacitated for further performance of duty, that the incapacity is\nlikely to be permanent, and that the member should be retired.\"          Iowa Code\nAnn.   §    411.6(3)   (West   Supp.   1996).     Even   though   the   disability\ndetermination was phrased in broader language than the statute (\"He does\nnot have any limitation which would preclude him from working as a\nfirefighter . . . and in our opinion he should be reinstated fully to work\nas a firefighter,\" J.A. at 360), the physicians' conclusions lack probative\nvalue on the relevant issue in this case:       whether the fitness standard set\nby the city is necessary to safe and efficient job performance.                The\nopinions of these physicians, aside from being geared to the question of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fSmith's    entitlement   to   disability   benefits,   do   not   appear   to   have\nconsidered the solid scientific studies on which the city based the 33.5\nVO2 max standard.7   Such evidence affords no basis for allowing a jury to\nsecond-guess the city's well-supported and reasonable conclusion that, in\nthe interest of the safety of its firefighters (including captains) and\ntheir effective job performance, the appropriate place to draw the line was\nat a VO2 max of 33.5.    We thus conclude that Smith has not demonstrated a\nfactual dispute on this issue.\n\n\n      To summarize our conclusions:        fitness and the ability to perform\nwhile wearing a SCBA are undoubtedly job-related and necessary requirements\nfor firefighters.    The dispute in this case is not whether firefighters\nmust be physically fit, but how fitness can be most appropriately measured\nand how the city may distinguish those firefighters who are probably\ncapable of performing the job from those firefighters who are probably not\ncapable.   The city has not proceeded arbitrarily, but rather has carefully\ndeveloped a standard based upon the available medical literature and using\nthe\n\n\n\n\n      7\n      Two members of the panel of three physicians later reviewed\nthe primary study, detailed above, on which the city relied in\nsetting the 33.5 VO2 max standard. They concluded:\n\n      Dr. Moseley and I do not believe that this study\n      justifies identifying Mr. Smith as unable to fulfill the\n      duties of a firefighter. In fact, Mr. Smith's exercise\n      capacity was 110% [of] predicted for his age and size.\n      I therefore believe that Mr. Smith is fully capable of\n      working as a firefighter and recommend that he return to\n      work.\n\nJ.A. at 361.     This evidence comes closer to addressing the\nnecessity of the 33.5 standard, but it is ultimately only an\nopinion that Smith be permitted an exception to the fire\ndepartment's policy. The physicians do not suggest that the study\nis inaccurate or that the fitness standard is unreasonable. We\nalso note that whether Smith's performance on the stress test\nexceeded the physicians' expectations is irrelevant.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fbest test available for measuring fitness, the stress test.8    J.A. at 81.\nThe literature indicates that a high proportion of firefighters with a VO2\nmax above 33.5 can perform fire suppression tasks successfully, but a much\nlower proportion of those with a VO2 max below 33.5 can do so.        Smith\nargues, and the physicians' evaluations suggest, that some firefighters\nwith lower VO2 max scores--Smith in particular--may be able to perform\ntheir jobs.   This may well be true, but the law does not require the city\nto put the lives of Smith and his fellow firefighters at risk by taking the\nchance that he is fit for duty when solid scientific studies indicate that\npersons with test results similar to his are not.    The lack of a precise\nor universally perfect fit between a job requirement and actual effective\nperformance is not fatal to a claim of business necessity, particularly\nwhen the public health and safety are at stake.    See McCosh, 628 F.2d at\n1062-63; cf. Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1120-21 (lack of unfortunate incidents\nin the past insufficient to create genuine issue of fact as to necessity\nof safety requirements).   We conclude that Smith has not met his burden of\npresenting a triable issue on the business necessity defense.\n\n\n                                     C.\n\n\n     Smith also argues that he presented evidence of an alternative means\nof assessing fitness that would have less of a disparate impact on older\nfirefighters.   In particular, he suggests that the city use the spirometry\nand stress tests to determine which firefighters may be unfit for the job,\nthen require those firefighters to undergo a physical examination and \"a\nbattery of\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Because the city is measuring fitness directly, this case is\ndistinguishable from Dothard, where the job (prison guard) required\na degree of strength but the defendants did not show any\ncorrelation between the requirements (minimum height and weight)\nand the strength required for the job. See Dothard, 433 U.S. at\n331.\n\n                                    -13-\n\ftests\" to determine whether they are actually fit for duty.      Appellant's\nBr. at 24.\n\n\n     We have not previously had the occasion to determine whether this\nbranch of the Title VII disparate impact doctrine applies to the ADEA.   For\npurposes of this appeal, however, we assume that the Title VII framework\napplies:    once the defendant has met its burden of demonstrating business\nnecessity, the plaintiff may still prevail by showing \"that other selection\ndevices without a similar discriminatory effect would also serve the\nemployer's legitimate interest in efficient and trustworthy workmanship.\"\nDothard, 433 U.S. at 329 (quotations omitted).         For several reasons,\nSmith's argument on this point is unavailing.\n\n\n     First, it does not appear from the record that Smith advanced this\nargument before the District Court.    We will not reverse a grant of summary\njudgment on the basis of an argument not presented below.         See, e.g.,\nO.R.S. Distilling Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588878\"><a href=\"/opinion/588878/ors-distilling-company-v-brown-forman-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 926 (8th Cir.\n1992).   Even if the argument were proper, however, Smith has not made any\nshowing that his proposed alternative (which is in any case rather vague)\nwould have less of a disparate impact on older firefighters than the city's\npresent system does.   At most, Smith has asserted that he would be able to\npass his proposed battery of tests, but he has not shown the effect of his\nsystem on other firefighters.    Nor has he shown that his more subjective\napproach would serve the city's legitimate interest in the fitness of its\nfirefighters as well as the current system.     Smith has failed to raise a\ngenuine issue of material fact on this branch of the disparate impact\ndoctrine.\n\n\n                                      III.\n\n\n     Finally, we consider the District Court's grant of summary judgment\nin favor of the city on Smith's ADA claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f       The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating 'against a\n       qualified individual with a disability because of the\n       disability of such individual.'     42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).    A\n       plaintiff seeking relief under the ADA must establish that he\n       is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA, that he is\n       qualified to perform the essential functions of his job either\n       with or without reasonable accommodation, and that he was\n       terminated because of his disability.\n\n\nWooten v. Farmland Foods, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698421\"><a href=\"/opinion/698421/hubert-wooten-v-farmland-foods/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385 (8th Cir. 1995).        The ADA\ndefines \"disability\" with respect to an individual as follows:\n\n\n       (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits\n       one or more of the major life activities of such individual;\n\n       (B) a record of such an impairment; or\n\n       (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) (1994).        Because the fire department filed for\ndisability retirement on his behalf, Smith claims that the city regards him\nas having a disability.     The parties agree that Smith is not in fact\ndisabled.   Amend. Compl. ¶ 26; Answer ¶ 20.\n\n\n       We rejected a claim similar to Smith's in Wooten.   In that case, we\nrecognized that \"working\" is a \"major life activity\" that, if substantially\nlimited by an impairment, brings an individual within the protection of the\nADA.   Wooten, 58 F.3d at 385-86.    We also held, however, that \"'working'\ndoes not mean working at a particular job of that person's choice\" and\nrecognized that \"[a]n impairment that disqualifies a person from only a\nnarrow range of jobs is not considered a substantially limiting one.\"   Id.\nat 386 (quotation omitted); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (1996)\n(\"The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a\nsubstantial limitation in the major life activity of working.\").    We then\napplied these principles to a \"regarded as\" situation in which Wooten\nclaimed that his former employer regarded\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fhim as having a disability, and we affirmed a grant of summary judgment for\nthe employer.   Wooten, 58 F.3d at 386.\n\n\n     Smith's claim fails for the same reasons that Wooten's did.     Viewing\nthe record in the light most favorable to Smith, we see that the city\nregarded Smith as unable to perform the duties of a firefighter.   But Smith\ndoes not suggest that the city believed he was unable to perform other\njobs, and he has presented no evidence to support that proposition.       In\nfact, in a letter to Smith in December 1993, the fire chief recognized that\nSmith had gone back to school and had taken another job while he was on\nsick leave from the fire department.   J.A. at 267.   Smith failed to create\na genuine issue of fact as to whether the city regarded him as having a\ndisability for purposes of the ADA, and the District Court properly granted\nsummary judgment on this claim.\n\n\n                                   IV.\n\n\n     The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n     I concur in parts I, IIA, and III of the majority's opinion.          I\nrespectfully dissent, however, from the majority's conclusion in parts IIB\nand IIC that the city was entitled to summary judgment on Smith's age\ndiscrimination claim.   I certainly agree that a high level of physical\nfitness is related to the job of a firefighter and that the city must\ndevelop a policy that ensures safe and efficient job performance.       In my\nview, however, the city has not adequately demonstrated that its fitness\nstandard has a manifest relationship to the duties of a fire captain.    Nor\nhas the city produced sufficient evidence to support a finding that its\npolicy of dismissing all employees who fail to meet the standard is\nnecessary for their safe and efficient job performance.   Moreover, contrary\nto the majority's position, the opinions of four\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fphysicians who independently examined Smith and determined that he was fit\nto perform his firefighting duties, directly rebut the necessity of the\ncity's policy.      At a minimum, therefore, I do not agree that summary\njudgment was appropriate for Smith's age discrimination claim and would\nremand to the district court for a full trial on the merits.\n\n\n        To prevail in its business necessity defense, the city must validate\nits    fitness   test    for    job-relatedness     to   the    particular     skills       and\nexertional requirements of a fire captain, the position at issue in this\ncase.    See Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109299\"><a href=\"/opinion/109299/albemarle-paper-co-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109299\"><a href=\"/opinion/109299/albemarle-paper-co-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304 (1975).         As the ANSI report recommends, for a proper fitness\nevaluation, an examiner must consider meaningful work-related information,\nincluding the type of activity to be performed, the level and duration of\neffort required.        (J.A. at 336.)\n\n\n        To justify its fitness standard, the city relies solely on Dr. Zorn's\nconclusion based on his review of a report of a study in which he did not\nparticipate.       The    study    tested     the   ability    of    a    sample    group    of\nfirefighters to complete a series of tasks that were \"designed to simulate\nthe duration, intensity, and types of tasks that are performed during\nfirefighting.\"    (J.A. at 215.)         As the majority states, a fire captain is\nfrequently involved in fire suppression activities when a company arrives\nat a fire scene.    Yet, as both Chief Phillips and Chief Morgan testified,\na fire captain spends much less time in the structure fighting the fire\nthan    firefighters      and    the    captain's    main     role   is    directing,       not\nparticipating in, the fire suppression.              (J.A. at 151, 170.)            Dr. Zorn\nacknowledged     that     it    would   be   \"reasonable\"      to    adjust   the    fitness\nrequirements for different positions, depending on the amount of time each\nposition spends suppressing the fire.           He left those decisions to the fire\ndepartment.      (J.A. at 130.)         The city has made no attempt to link its\nfitness standard specifically to\n\n\n\n\n                                             -17-\n\fthe job requirements of a fire captain.              Thus, the standard cannot be\njustified as a business necessity.\n\n\n        Even if a fitness standard for firefighters could justify the\ndismissal of a fire captain, there is conflicting evidence in the record\nas to whether the test used and the specific fitness level set by the city\nare reasonable.         After reviewing the study and discussing its findings with\nDr. Zorn, Dr. Schwartz wrote to the fire department:               \"Dr. Moseley and I\ndo not believe that this study justifies identifying Mr. Smith as unable\nto fulfill the duties of a firefighter.\"             (J.A. at 361.)        Dr. Schwartz\ntestified that the VO2 minimums set by the city are unreasonable and that,\nin his opinion, the city should not rely on a single test for its fitness\nevaluation.      (J.A. at 179-80.)        With this conflicting evidence as to the\nvalidation of the standard, Smith's claim should have survived summary\njudgment.\n\n\n        In addition to the insufficient evidence of a \"manifest relationship\"\nbetween the fitness standard and Smith's job requirements, the city has not\ndemonstrated the necessity of its policy requiring dismissal of all those\nwho fail the fitness test.          The city argues that its policy is necessary\nbecause       federal    regulations   and   ANSI   recommendations    require        fire\ndepartments to ensure the safety of its employees.                 Neither authority\nrequires as strict a policy as the city has adopted for its firefighters,\nhowever.       Moreover, the study on which the city relies for its standard\ndoes not recommend that employees failing to meet the standards be fired.\nRather, the study suggests that employees who cannot meet the standards be\ngiven     a    specialized     exercise    regime   to   improve   their     levels     of\ncardiopulmonary fitness.          As the authors of the study recognize,\n\n\n        policies that select and/or retain on the basis of fitness but\n        are not accompanied by programs emphasizing fitness may be\n        vulnerable to legal challenge. Initiating\n\n\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\f     entry expectations at a level allowing for a reasonable decline\n     with advancing age is one step but this should be accompanied\n     by weight control, exercise, and smoking cessation programs\n     with periodic individualized assessment.\n\n\n(J.A. at 221.)\n\n\nIn a letter to Dr. Zorn, Sothmann recommends:\n\n\n     a proactive approach where individuals below the expectation\n     are given time to improve through an established policy\n     negotiated by concerned parties (e.g. administration, union,\n     medical, human rights). An unwillingness to adhere or failure\n     to achieve the expectation should be treated on a case by case\n     basis with additional information to decide employment\n     implications.\n\n\n(J.A. at 256.)   The city did not implement these recommendations.     Where\na fitness test so disparately affects persons protected by the ADEA, the\ncity should at least attempt to minimize the effect by giving its employees\nan opportunity to improve their physical condition.\n\n\n     To further rebut the necessity of the city's fitness standard, Smith\nhas presented substantial evidence that, despite failing the city's test,\nhe was fit to perform firefighting duties.   Dr. Glazier, who examined Smith\nto provide a second opinion, stated that based on spirometric findings,\n\"[Smith] is capable of performing exertional tasks while wearing SCBA.\"\n(J.A. at 364.)   The three doctors who evaluated Smith for his disability\npension status thoroughly examined him.   Each concluded separately not only\nthat Smith was not disabled but also that he was fit to return to work as\na firefighter.   As the EEOC asserted in its amicus brief, the opinions of\nthe four doctors that Smith's cardiopulmonary capacity would not prevent\nhim from performing the duties of his job safely and efficiently is\nsufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the city's\nstandard is justified by business necessity.\n\n\n     The majority characterizes the dispute in this case as how fitness\ncan be \"most appropriately measured.\"     Rather, the real dispute is whether\nthe city's policy, which has a disparate impact on persons protected by the\nADEA, has a manifest relationship to the job of a fire captain and whether\n\n                                   -19-\n\fit is necessary for the safe and efficient performance of the captain's\njob.   In my view, plaintiff presents sufficient evidence to counter both\nelements   of   the   business   necessity   defense.   Thus,   Smith's   age\ndiscrimination claim should have survived summary judgment.\n\n\n       A true copy.\n\n\n            Attest:\n\n\n                 CLERK, U. S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f</pre>",
