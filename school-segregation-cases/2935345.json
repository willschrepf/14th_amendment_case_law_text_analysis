See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 841.001-.151\n\n(West 2010 & Supp. 2012). A jury found that Fierro is a sexually violent predator\n\nand the trial court rendered a final judgment and an order of civil commitment. On\n\nappeal, Fierro challenges the State’s comments made during closing arguments, the\n\nlegal and factual sufficiency of the evidence, one of the conditions of civil\n\ncommitment, and the constitutionality of the SVP statute. We affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n\n\n                                        1\n\f                            Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n      In issues two and three, Fierro challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence to support the jury’s verdict. The State must prove, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, that a person is a sexually violent predator. Tex. Health & Safety\n\nCode Ann. § 841.062(a) (West 2010). Under a legal sufficiency review, we assess\n\nall the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any\n\nrational trier of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the elements required\n\nfor commitment under the SVP statute. In re Commitment of Mullens, 92 S.W.3d\n\n881, 885 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2002, pet. denied). It is the factfinder’s\n\nresponsibility to fairly resolve conflicts in the testimony, weigh the evidence, and\n\ndraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. Id. at 887. Under\n\nfactual sufficiency review, we weigh the evidence to determine “whether a verdict\n\nthat is supported by legally sufficient evidence nevertheless reflects a risk of\n\ninjustice that would compel ordering a new trial.” In re Commitment of Day, 342\n\nS.W.3d 193, 213 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2011, pet. denied).\n\n      A person is a “sexually violent predator” if he is a repeat sexually violent\n\noffender and suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes him likely to\n\nengage in a predatory act of sexual violence. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §\n\n841.003(a) (West 2010). A “behavioral abnormality” is “a congenital or acquired\n\n                                         2\n\fcondition that, by affecting a person’s emotional or volitional capacity, predisposes\n\nthe person to commit a sexually violent offense, to the extent that the person\n\nbecomes a menace to the health and safety of another person.” Id. at § 841.002(2)\n\n(West Supp. 2012). “A condition which affects either emotional capacity or\n\nvolitional capacity to the extent a person is predisposed to threaten the health and\n\nsafety of others with acts of sexual violence is an abnormality which causes serious\n\ndifficulty in behavior control.” In re Commitment of Almaguer, 117 S.W.3d 500,\n\n506 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2003, pet. denied).\n\n        According to the record, Fierro pleaded guilty to indecency with a child,\n\nsexual assault, and aggravated sexual assault. Fierro testified that he is incarcerated\n\nfor sexually assaulting two sixteen-year-old girls. He denied approaching women\n\non the streets and grabbing their breasts, but admitted being charged with public\n\nlewdness for such offenses. Fierro testified that he participated in sex offender\n\ntreatment while on deferred adjudication, but subsequently sexually offended. He\n\nadmitted losing control of his sexual urges on multiple occasions throughout his\n\nlife.\n\n        However, Fierro testified that he is not a sex addict and no longer has a\n\nproblem with sex or a desire to reoffend. Fierro explained that sex offender\n\ntreatment has taught him about negative beliefs and anger, rational thoughts,\n\n                                          3\n\frelapse prevention, and stopping deviant fantasies. He acknowledged that he had\n\nhurt the victims, the victims’ families, and his own family, and that he is to blame.\n\nFierro explained that sexual assault is wrong. He testified that he wants to move on\n\nwith his life and that reoffending would let both himself and his family down. He\n\npromised not to sexually assault again and testified that he would be at fault if he\n\nreoffended.\n\n      Dr. Antoinette McGarrahan, a forensic psychologist, testified that Fierro is\n\nsexually aroused by, interested in, and acts on urges and fantasies related to\n\ninflicting harm and humiliation upon other people. She described this behavior as\n\nsexually deviant. She diagnosed Fierro with sexual sadism and frotteurism.\n\nMcGarrahan explained that Fierro has no remorse, does not believe he is at fault,\n\ntakes no responsibility, and makes excuses for his behavior. Dr. Lisa Clayton, a\n\nmedical doctor specializing in psychiatry and forensic psychiatry, testified that\n\nFierro is gratified and aroused by physically and psychologically threatening or\n\nharming women. Clayton diagnosed Fierro with sexual sadism, frotteurism,\n\nparaphilia not otherwise specified, alcohol abuse in remission, cocaine dependence\n\nin remission, and antisocial personality disorder. She explained that Fierro is\n\nsexually deviant, is a serial rapist, exhibits assaultive violence, and portrays\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fhimself as a victim. McGarrahan and Clayton testified that sexual sadism is\n\nchronic and McGarrahan explained that this condition requires intensive treatment.\n\n      McGarrahan opined that Fierro has difficulty following the rules, as\n\nevidenced by the fact that he engaged in violent acts even when under significant\n\nconstraints. According to McGarrahan, the ramifications of being caught and\n\npunished did not deter Fierro from offending. She noted that Fierro was a leader in\n\na prison gang, participated in prison riots and fighting, spent time in administrative\n\nsegregation, and was found in possession of shanks. Clayton testified that Fierro\n\nminimizes his violent conduct in prison and his gang affiliation.\n\n      McGarrahan testified that Fierro claims to have previously participated in\n\nsex offender treatment, but she testified that Fierro continued to sexually offend.\n\nShe testified that Fierro is currently participating in treatment, but continues to\n\nshow no remorse and continues to deny that he did anything wrong, is a sex\n\noffender, needs sex offender treatment, or is sexually deviant. Clayton testified that\n\nFierro lacks victim empathy, sees himself as a victim, and takes no responsibility\n\nfor his offenses. She did not believe that Fierro’s current sex offender treatment\n\nwill help him and testified that the treatment may even have a counter-productive\n\neffect. She explained that treatment had not deterred Fierro from escalating, may\n\nhave given him more ideas, and will not stop his serial raping.\n\n                                          5\n\f      McGarrahan testified that, based on Fierro’s score on the Hare Psychopathy\n\nChecklist, Fierro is a psychopath. Fierro’s psychopathic characteristics include\n\npathological lying, lack of remorse or guilt, callousness, impulsivity, failure to\n\naccept responsibility, and poor behavioral controls. Clayton agreed that Fierro is a\n\npsychopath and she pointed to evidence of his gang involvement, manipulation of\n\nothers, attitude toward others, and lack of conscience, guilt, or remorse.\n\nMcGarrahan testified that Fierro’s score on the Static-99R places him in the\n\nmoderately high range for reoffense and his score on the Minnesota Sex Offender\n\nScreening Tool Revised placed Fierro at a high risk for sexually violent offense.\n\nShe identified several factors that increase Fierro’s risk of reoffense: denial and\n\nminimization, stranger and unrelated victims, substance abuse, non-sexual\n\nviolence, use of a weapon during offenses, lack of an emotionally intimate\n\nrelationship with an adult, psychopathy, sexual deviancy, and offenses that\n\noccurred in public, after Fierro was caught and punished, and during supervision.\n\nClayton testified that Fierro’s ability to obtain employment is a positive factor, but\n\nthat he has numerous risk factors: multiple time periods of sexually deviant\n\nbehavior, use of violence and force, history of assaultive and violent behavior,\n\ngang association and violent conduct in prison, lack of victim empathy, failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\ftake responsibility, good health and young age, sexual assault while in a\n\nrelationship, and sexual offenses after sex offender treatment.\n\n      Clayton testified that Fierro’s emotional or volitional capacity has been\n\naffected because Fierro cannot think about sex without his thoughts progressing to\n\nsexual deviancy, he cannot control his urges, in the free world he will be presented\n\nwith many potential victims, and he is not deterred by the possibility of spending\n\nlife in prison. McGarrahan testified that Fierro’s sexual offenses and sexual\n\ndeviancy constitute evidence that his emotional and volitional capacity have been\n\naffected:\n\n             The willingness -- the volitional capacity -- the willingness to\n      engage in violent, humiliating sexual acts with women, his\n      willingness to do that without consideration of the consequences for\n      the victim or even for himself means that his emotional capacity has\n      been affected. That is the way he thinks about the world, the way he\n      feels, the way he perceives things is not normal. It’s been affected\n      because of this condition and it is affected to the point at which it -- it\n      makes him likely to engage in another predatory act of sexual\n      violence.\n\nMcGarrahan and Clayton both concluded that Fierro suffers from a behavioral\n\nabnormality that makes him likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence.\n\n      On appeal, Fierro argues that the experts’ testimony was too conclusory to\n\nsupport a finding that he suffers from a behavioral abnormality or has serious\n\ndifficulty controlling his behavior. We disagree. Both doctors are licensed in their\n\n                                          7\n\frespective fields. See In re Commitment of Burnett, No. 09-09-00009-CV, 2009\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 9930, at *14 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Dec. 31, 2009, no pet.)\n\n(mem. op.). They interviewed Fierro and reviewed records regarding his\n\nbackground, offenses, and incarceration. See id. McGarrahan administered\n\nactuarial tests and testified that these types of tests are generally accepted in her\n\nfield. The experts relied on the types of records relied on by experts in their\n\nrespective fields and performed their evaluations in accordance with their training\n\nas professionals in their respective fields. See id. The doctors based their opinions\n\non the facts and data gathered from the records they reviewed, their interviews\n\nwith Fierro, and the risk assessments they conducted. See id. They explained in\n\ndetail the facts and evidence they found relevant in forming their opinions and how\n\nthose facts played a role in their evaluations. See id. Both experts concluded that\n\nFierro suffers from a behavioral abnormality as defined by the SVP statute. See id.\n\nTheir testimony is not so conclusory as to be completely lacking in probative\n\nvalue. See id.\n\n      In addition to the experts’ opinions that Fierro has a behavioral abnormality\n\nthat makes him likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence, the jury heard\n\nevidence of Fierro’s risk factors, actuarial test scores, criminal history, sexual\n\noffenses, and diagnoses. The jury was entitled to infer current serious difficulty\n\n                                         8\n\fcontrolling behavior based on Fierro’s past behavior, Fierro’s testimony, and the\n\nexperts’ testimony. See id. at *13; see also In re Commitment of Grinstead, No. 09-\n\n07-00412-CV, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 228, at *20 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Jan. 15,\n\n2009, no pet.) (mem. op.). The jury could reasonably conclude that Fierro has\n\nserious difficulty controlling his behavior and is likely to commit predatory acts of\n\nsexual violence directed toward individuals for the primary purpose of\n\nvictimization. See Mullens, 92 S.W.3d at 887; see also Almaguer, 117 S.W.3d at\n\n506; Burnett, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 9930, at *13. Such conclusions are implicit\n\nin a finding that Fierro suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes him likely\n\nto engage in a predatory act of sexual violence. See Grinstead, 2009 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 228, at *16; see also In re Commitment of Bailey, No. 09-09-00353-CV,\n\n2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 6685, at **12-13 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Aug. 19, 2010,\n\nno pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n      Reviewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a\n\nrational jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Fierro has a\n\nbehavioral abnormality that predisposes him to commit a predatory act of sexual\n\nviolence; therefore, the evidence is legally sufficient. See Kansas v. Crane, 534\n\nU.S. 407, 413, 122 S.Ct. 867, 151 L.Ed.2d 856 (2002); see also Mullens, 92\n\nS.W.3d at 885. Weighing all of the evidence, the verdict does not reflect a risk of\n\n                                         9\n\finjustice that would compel ordering a new trial. See Day, 342 S.W.3d at 213. We\n\noverrule Fierro’s second and third issues.\n\n                                  Jury Argument\n\n      In issue one, Fierro contends that the State engaged in improper and harmful\n\njury argument. To obtain a reversal based upon improper jury argument, the\n\nappellant must demonstrate (1) an error (2) that was not invited or provoked, (3)\n\nthat was preserved by the proper trial predicate, such as an objection, a motion to\n\ninstruct, or a motion for mistrial, (4) was not curable by an instruction, a prompt\n\nwithdrawal of the statement, or a reprimand by the judge, and (5) that the argument\n\nby its nature, degree, and extent constituted reversibly harmful error. Standard Fire\n\nIns. Co. v. Reese, 584 S.W.2d 835, 839 (Tex. 1979). “[T]he complainant must\n\nshow that the probability that the improper argument caused harm is greater than\n\nthe probability that the verdict was grounded on the proper proceedings and\n\nevidence.” Id. at 840.\n\n      During closing arguments, the State began to argue, “First off, these first\n\nfive offenses, yes, he went up to women, he grabbed them and eventually –[.]”\n\nFierro’s counsel objected that the State’s argument assumed facts not in evidence,\n\nbut the trial court overruled the objection. The State proceeded with its argument\n\nand discussed the five offenses. Subsequently, in rebuttal, the State argued that\n\n                                         10\n\fFierro “went up to women on the street and grabbed their breasts[]” and “raped\n\nwomen in cars.” Fierro did not object to the State’s argument. When the State\n\nargued that Fierro had shown “no empathy when he talked about his ten victims\n\ntoday[,]” Fierro’s counsel objected that the State’s argument assumed facts not in\n\nevidence. The trial court overruled the objection.\n\n      On appeal, Fierro contends that his guilt for these alleged crimes was not\n\nbefore the jury and, consequently, the State’s argument was improper. Fierro\n\nasserts that the State’s arguments suggested to the jury that it should consider\n\nwhether these other offenses occurred and punish Fierro for those offenses.\n\nAccording to Fierro, the State failed to limit its closing argument to the evidence\n\npresented at trial and encouraged the jury to consider irrelevant facts when\n\nrendering a verdict.\n\n      However, the record does not indicate that Fierro objected to similar\n\narguments or requested a running objection to the State’s argument. Additionally,\n\nas to the arguments objected to, the evidence was such that the probability that the\n\nState’s argument caused harm is not greater than the probability that the verdict\n\nwas based on the proper proceedings and evidence. See Reese, 584 S.W.2d at 840.\n\nWe conclude that the State’s arguments that were not objected to were not so\n\ninflammatory that a timely instruction would not have alleviated the harm, if any,\n\n                                         11\n\fcaused by the argument. See Nat’l Freight, Inc. v. Snyder, 191 S.W.3d 416, 421\n\n(Tex. App.—Eastland 2006, no pet.). We overrule issue one.\n\n                          Conditions of Civil Commitment\n\n      In issue four, Fierro argues that the trial court’s civil commitment order\n\nimposes a condition that is too vague for a person of ordinary intelligence to apply\n\nand understand. Specifically, the trial court found it appropriate to establish a child\n\nsafety zone and ordered that Fierro shall not “participate in an activity that at any\n\ntime provides athletic, civic or cultural affairs to persons 17 years of age or\n\nyounger[.]” At trial, Fierro sought clarification as to this condition and the trial\n\ncourt responded as follows:\n\n             The statute allows me to establish a child safety zone in every\n      case, which I do. Okay? This is enforced by the Counsel for Sex\n      Offender Treatment Providers that you are going to get to meet. Upon\n      release from prison, they are going to be the ones that pick you up.\n      Okay?\n      ...\n\n             It says that the Court has determined that it is appropriate to\n      establish child safety zones such that Robert Joseph Fierro shall not\n      participate in any activity that at any time provides athletic, civic and\n      cultural affairs to persons 17 years of age or younger or be within\n      1,000 feet of a perimeter where children gather, including school,\n      daycare facility, playground, tennis, swimming pool or video arcade.\n      Okay? It states exactly what it means. Okay? So, that’s what it says,\n      and that’s the way it’s going to be followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      On appeal, Fierro contends that this condition lacks guidelines for uniform\n\napplication, requiring Fierro to guess at its meaning and, therefore, violates due\n\nprocess. He contends that this condition gives substantial discretion to the police\n\nand may also lead to infringement of First Amendment rights. The record does not\n\nindicate that Fierro presented these complaints to the trial court either when he\n\nsought clarification of the condition or at any time thereafter. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a); see also In re Commitment of Sprague, No. 09-10-00228-CV, 2011 Tex.\n\nApp. LEXIS 4503, at *31 (Tex. App.—Beaumont June 16, 2011, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.). Thus, issue four is not preserved for appellate review.\n\n                                Supplemental Issue\n\n      In a supplemental issue, Fierro argues that the Texas Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in In re Bohannan, ___ S.W.3d ___, No. 10-0605, 2012 Tex. LEXIS 734\n\n(Tex. Aug. 31, 2012) (not yet released for publication) interpreted portions of the\n\nSVP statute in such a way as to render the statute facially unconstitutional. In\n\nBohannan, the Texas Supreme Court explained that a behavioral abnormality is a\n\ncondition that predisposes sexually violent conduct. Bohannan, 2012 Tex. LEXIS\n\n734, at *14. The Court explained that “condition and predisposition are one and the\n\nsame[,]” and “whether a person ‘suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fthe person likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence’ is a single,\n\nunified issue.” Id. at **16-17.\n\n      Fierro contends that Bohannan relieves the State of the burden of\n\ndemonstrating that a person has a mental illness or disorder. However, this Court\n\nhas previously concluded that “Bohannan did not eliminate any proof required by\n\nthe statute for a sexually-violent-predator finding, nor did the Supreme Court\n\nchange the statute or render it unconstitutional.” See In re Commitment of\n\nAnderson, ___ S.W.3d ___, No. 09-11-00613-CV, 2013 Tex. App. Lexis 607, at\n\n*17 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Jan. 24, 2013, no pet. h.) (not yet released for\n\npublication). We, therefore, reject Fierro’s arguments and affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                                             ________________________________\n                                                    STEVE McKEITHEN\n                                                        Chief Justice\n\n\n\nSubmitted on February 20, 2013\nOpinion Delivered March 7, 2013\nBefore McKeithen, C.J., Gaultney and Horton, JJ.\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f",

See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 841.001-.151\n\n(West 2010 & Supp. 2012). A jury found that Fierro is a sexually violent predator\n\nand the trial court rendered a final judgment and an order of civil commitment. On\n\nappeal, Fierro challenges the State’s comments made during closing arguments, the\n\nlegal and factual sufficiency of the evidence, one of the conditions of civil\n\ncommitment, and the constitutionality of the SVP statute. We affirm the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n\n\n                                        1\n\f                            Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n      In issues two and three, Fierro challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence to support the jury’s verdict. The State must prove, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, that a person is a sexually violent predator. Tex. Health & Safety\n\nCode Ann. § 841.062(a) (West 2010). Under a legal sufficiency review, we assess\n\nall the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any\n\nrational trier of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the elements required\n\nfor commitment under the SVP statute.

It is the factfinder’s\n\nresponsibility to fairly resolve conflicts in the testimony, weigh the evidence, and\n\ndraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. Id. at 887. Under\n\nfactual sufficiency review, we weigh the evidence to determine “whether a verdict\n\nthat is supported by legally sufficient evidence nevertheless reflects a risk of\n\ninjustice that would compel ordering a new trial.” In re Commitment of Day, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541340\"><a href=\"/opinion/2541340/in-re-commitment-of-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2011, pet. denied).\n\n      A person is a “sexually violent predator” if he is a repeat sexually violent\n\noffender and suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes him likely to\n\nengage in a predatory act of sexual violence. Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §\n\n841.003(a) (West 2010). A “behavioral abnormality” is “a congenital or acquired\n\n                                         2\n\fcondition that, by affecting a person’s emotional or volitional capacity, predisposes\n\nthe person to commit a sexually violent offense, to the extent that the person\n\nbecomes a menace to the health and safety of another person.” Id. at § 841.002(2)\n\n(West Supp. 2012). “A condition which affects either emotional capacity or\n\nvolitional capacity to the extent a person is predisposed to threaten the health and\n\nsafety of others with acts of sexual violence is an abnormality which causes serious\n\ndifficulty in behavior control.” In re Commitment of Almaguer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427757\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427757/in-re-commitment-of-almaguer/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n506 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2003, pet. denied).\n\n        According to the record, Fierro pleaded guilty to indecency with a child,\n\nsexual assault, and aggravated sexual assault. Fierro testified that he is incarcerated\n\nfor sexually assaulting two sixteen-year-old girls. He denied approaching women\n\non the streets and grabbing their breasts, but admitted being charged with public\n\nlewdness for such offenses. Fierro testified that he participated in sex offender\n\ntreatment while on deferred adjudication, but subsequently sexually offended. He\n\nadmitted losing control of his sexual urges on multiple occasions throughout his\n\nlife.\n\n        However, Fierro testified that he is not a sex addict and no longer has a\n\nproblem with sex or a desire to reoffend. Fierro explained that sex offender\n\ntreatment has taught him about negative beliefs and anger, rational thoughts,\n\n                                          3\n\frelapse prevention, and stopping deviant fantasies. He acknowledged that he had\n\nhurt the victims, the victims’ families, and his own family, and that he is to blame.\n\nFierro explained that sexual assault is wrong. He testified that he wants to move on\n\nwith his life and that reoffending would let both himself and his family down. He\n\npromised not to sexually assault again and testified that he would be at fault if he\n\nreoffended.\n\n      Dr. Antoinette McGarrahan, a forensic psychologist, testified that Fierro is\n\nsexually aroused by, interested in, and acts on urges and fantasies related to\n\ninflicting harm and humiliation upon other people. She described this behavior as\n\nsexually deviant. She diagnosed Fierro with sexual sadism and frotteurism.\n\nMcGarrahan explained that Fierro has no remorse, does not believe he is at fault,\n\ntakes no responsibility, and makes excuses for his behavior. Dr. Lisa Clayton, a\n\nmedical doctor specializing in psychiatry and forensic psychiatry, testified that\n\nFierro is gratified and aroused by physically and psychologically threatening or\n\nharming women. Clayton diagnosed Fierro with sexual sadism, frotteurism,\n\nparaphilia not otherwise specified, alcohol abuse in remission, cocaine dependence\n\nin remission, and antisocial personality disorder. She explained that Fierro is\n\nsexually deviant, is a serial rapist, exhibits assaultive violence, and portrays\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fhimself as a victim. McGarrahan and Clayton testified that sexual sadism is\n\nchronic and McGarrahan explained that this condition requires intensive treatment.\n\n      McGarrahan opined that Fierro has difficulty following the rules, as\n\nevidenced by the fact that he engaged in violent acts even when under significant\n\nconstraints. According to McGarrahan, the ramifications of being caught and\n\npunished did not deter Fierro from offending. She noted that Fierro was a leader in\n\na prison gang, participated in prison riots and fighting, spent time in administrative\n\nsegregation, and was found in possession of shanks. Clayton testified that Fierro\n\nminimizes his violent conduct in prison and his gang affiliation.\n\n      McGarrahan testified that Fierro claims to have previously participated in\n\nsex offender treatment, but she testified that Fierro continued to sexually offend.\n\nShe testified that Fierro is currently participating in treatment, but continues to\n\nshow no remorse and continues to deny that he did anything wrong, is a sex\n\noffender, needs sex offender treatment, or is sexually deviant. Clayton testified that\n\nFierro lacks victim empathy, sees himself as a victim, and takes no responsibility\n\nfor his offenses. She did not believe that Fierro’s current sex offender treatment\n\nwill help him and testified that the treatment may even have a counter-productive\n\neffect. She explained that treatment had not deterred Fierro from escalating, may\n\nhave given him more ideas, and will not stop his serial raping.\n\n                                          5\n\f      McGarrahan testified that, based on Fierro’s score on the Hare Psychopathy\n\nChecklist, Fierro is a psychopath. Fierro’s psychopathic characteristics include\n\npathological lying, lack of remorse or guilt, callousness, impulsivity, failure to\n\naccept responsibility, and poor behavioral controls. Clayton agreed that Fierro is a\n\npsychopath and she pointed to evidence of his gang involvement, manipulation of\n\nothers, attitude toward others, and lack of conscience, guilt, or remorse.\n\nMcGarrahan testified that Fierro’s score on the Static-99R places him in the\n\nmoderately high range for reoffense and his score on the Minnesota Sex Offender\n\nScreening Tool Revised placed Fierro at a high risk for sexually violent offense.\n\nShe identified several factors that increase Fierro’s risk of reoffense: denial and\n\nminimization, stranger and unrelated victims, substance abuse, non-sexual\n\nviolence, use of a weapon during offenses, lack of an emotionally intimate\n\nrelationship with an adult, psychopathy, sexual deviancy, and offenses that\n\noccurred in public, after Fierro was caught and punished, and during supervision.\n\nClayton testified that Fierro’s ability to obtain employment is a positive factor, but\n\nthat he has numerous risk factors: multiple time periods of sexually deviant\n\nbehavior, use of violence and force, history of assaultive and violent behavior,\n\ngang association and violent conduct in prison, lack of victim empathy, failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\ftake responsibility, good health and young age, sexual assault while in a\n\nrelationship, and sexual offenses after sex offender treatment.\n\n      Clayton testified that Fierro’s emotional or volitional capacity has been\n\naffected because Fierro cannot think about sex without his thoughts progressing to\n\nsexual deviancy, he cannot control his urges, in the free world he will be presented\n\nwith many potential victims, and he is not deterred by the possibility of spending\n\nlife in prison. McGarrahan testified that Fierro’s sexual offenses and sexual\n\ndeviancy constitute evidence that his emotional and volitional capacity have been\n\naffected:\n\n             The willingness -- the volitional capacity -- the willingness to\n      engage in violent, humiliating sexual acts with women, his\n      willingness to do that without consideration of the consequences for\n      the victim or even for himself means that his emotional capacity has\n      been affected. That is the way he thinks about the world, the way he\n      feels, the way he perceives things is not normal. It’s been affected\n      because of this condition and it is affected to the point at which it -- it\n      makes him likely to engage in another predatory act of sexual\n      violence.\n\nMcGarrahan and Clayton both concluded that Fierro suffers from a behavioral\n\nabnormality that makes him likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence.\n\n      On appeal, Fierro argues that the experts’ testimony was too conclusory to\n\nsupport a finding that he suffers from a behavioral abnormality or has serious\n\ndifficulty controlling his behavior. We disagree. Both doctors are licensed in their\n\n                                          7\n\frespective fields. See In re Commitment of Burnett, No. 09-09-00009-CV, 2009\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 9930, at *14 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Dec. 31, 2009, no pet.)\n\n(mem. op.). They interviewed Fierro and reviewed records regarding his\n\nbackground, offenses, and incarceration. See id. McGarrahan administered\n\nactuarial tests and testified that these types of tests are generally accepted in her\n\nfield. The experts relied on the types of records relied on by experts in their\n\nrespective fields and performed their evaluations in accordance with their training\n\nas professionals in their respective fields. See id. The doctors based their opinions\n\non the facts and data gathered from the records they reviewed, their interviews\n\nwith Fierro, and the risk assessments they conducted. See id. They explained in\n\ndetail the facts and evidence they found relevant in forming their opinions and how\n\nthose facts played a role in their evaluations. See id. Both experts concluded that\n\nFierro suffers from a behavioral abnormality as defined by the SVP statute. See id.\n\nTheir testimony is not so conclusory as to be completely lacking in probative\n\nvalue. See id.\n\n      In addition to the experts’ opinions that Fierro has a behavioral abnormality\n\nthat makes him likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence, the jury heard\n\nevidence of Fierro’s risk factors, actuarial test scores, criminal history, sexual\n\noffenses, and diagnoses. The jury was entitled to infer current serious difficulty\n\n                                         8\n\fcontrolling behavior based on Fierro’s past behavior, Fierro’s testimony, and the\n\nexperts’ testimony. See id. at *13; see also In re Commitment of Grinstead, No. 09-\n\n07-00412-CV, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 228, at *20 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Jan. 15,\n\n2009, no pet.) (mem. op.). The jury could reasonably conclude that Fierro has\n\nserious difficulty controlling his behavior and is likely to commit predatory acts of\n\nsexual violence directed toward individuals for the primary purpose of\n\nvictimization. See Mullens, 92 S.W.3d at 887; see also Almaguer, 117 S.W.3d at\n\n506; Burnett, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 9930, at *13. Such conclusions are implicit\n\nin a finding that Fierro suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes him likely\n\nto engage in a predatory act of sexual violence. See Grinstead, 2009 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 228, at *16; see also In re Commitment of Bailey, No. 09-09-00353-CV,\n\n2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 6685, at **12-13 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Aug. 19, 2010,\n\nno pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n      Reviewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a\n\nrational jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Fierro has a\n\nbehavioral abnormality that predisposes him to commit a predatory act of sexual\n\nviolence; therefore, the evidence is legally sufficient. See Kansas v. Crane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118479\"><a href=\"/opinion/118479/kansas-v-crane/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118479\"><a href=\"/opinion/118479/kansas-v-crane/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Weighing all of the evidence, the verdict does not reflect a risk of\n\n                                         9\n\finjustice that would compel ordering a new trial. See Day, 342 S.W.3d at 213. We\n\noverrule Fierro’s second and third issues.\n\n                                  Jury Argument\n\n      In issue one, Fierro contends that the State engaged in improper and harmful\n\njury argument. To obtain a reversal based upon improper jury argument, the\n\nappellant must demonstrate (1) an error (2) that was not invited or provoked, (3)\n\nthat was preserved by the proper trial predicate, such as an objection, a motion to\n\ninstruct, or a motion for mistrial, (4) was not curable by an instruction, a prompt\n\nwithdrawal of the statement, or a reprimand by the judge, and (5) that the argument\n\nby its nature, degree, and extent constituted reversibly harmful error. Standard Fire\n\nIns. Co. v. Reese, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757950/standard-fire-ins-co-v-reese/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839 (Tex. 1979). “[T]he complainant must\n\nshow that the probability that the improper argument caused harm is greater than\n\nthe probability that the verdict was grounded on the proper proceedings and\n\nevidence.” Id. at 840.\n\n      During closing arguments, the State began to argue, “First off, these first\n\nfive offenses, yes, he went up to women, he grabbed them and eventually –[.]”\n\nFierro’s counsel objected that the State’s argument assumed facts not in evidence,\n\nbut the trial court overruled the objection. The State proceeded with its argument\n\nand discussed the five offenses. Subsequently, in rebuttal, the State argued that\n\n                                         10\n\fFierro “went up to women on the street and grabbed their breasts[]” and “raped\n\nwomen in cars.” Fierro did not object to the State’s argument. When the State\n\nargued that Fierro had shown “no empathy when he talked about his ten victims\n\ntoday[,]” Fierro’s counsel objected that the State’s argument assumed facts not in\n\nevidence. The trial court overruled the objection.\n\n      On appeal, Fierro contends that his guilt for these alleged crimes was not\n\nbefore the jury and, consequently, the State’s argument was improper. Fierro\n\nasserts that the State’s arguments suggested to the jury that it should consider\n\nwhether these other offenses occurred and punish Fierro for those offenses.\n\nAccording to Fierro, the State failed to limit its closing argument to the evidence\n\npresented at trial and encouraged the jury to consider irrelevant facts when\n\nrendering a verdict.\n\n      However, the record does not indicate that Fierro objected to similar\n\narguments or requested a running objection to the State’s argument. Additionally,\n\nas to the arguments objected to, the evidence was such that the probability that the\n\nState’s argument caused harm is not greater than the probability that the verdict\n\nwas based on the proper proceedings and evidence. See Reese, 584 S.W.2d at 840.\n\nWe conclude that the State’s arguments that were not objected to were not so\n\ninflammatory that a timely instruction would not have alleviated the harm, if any,\n\n                                         11\n\fcaused by the argument.

We overrule issue one.\n\n                          Conditions of Civil Commitment\n\n      In issue four, Fierro argues that the trial court’s civil commitment order\n\nimposes a condition that is too vague for a person of ordinary intelligence to apply\n\nand understand. Specifically, the trial court found it appropriate to establish a child\n\nsafety zone and ordered that Fierro shall not “participate in an activity that at any\n\ntime provides athletic, civic or cultural affairs to persons 17 years of age or\n\nyounger[.]” At trial, Fierro sought clarification as to this condition and the trial\n\ncourt responded as follows:\n\n             The statute allows me to establish a child safety zone in every\n      case, which I do. Okay? This is enforced by the Counsel for Sex\n      Offender Treatment Providers that you are going to get to meet. Upon\n      release from prison, they are going to be the ones that pick you up.\n      Okay?\n      ...\n\n             It says that the Court has determined that it is appropriate to\n      establish child safety zones such that Robert Joseph Fierro shall not\n      participate in any activity that at any time provides athletic, civic and\n      cultural affairs to persons 17 years of age or younger or be within\n      1,000 feet of a perimeter where children gather, including school,\n      daycare facility, playground, tennis, swimming pool or video arcade.\n      Okay? It states exactly what it means. Okay? So, that’s what it says,\n      and that’s the way it’s going to be followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      On appeal, Fierro contends that this condition lacks guidelines for uniform\n\napplication, requiring Fierro to guess at its meaning and, therefore, violates due\n\nprocess. He contends that this condition gives substantial discretion to the police\n\nand may also lead to infringement of First Amendment rights. The record does not\n\nindicate that Fierro presented these complaints to the trial court either when he\n\nsought clarification of the condition or at any time thereafter. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a); see also In re Commitment of Sprague, No. 09-10-00228-CV, 2011 Tex.\n\nApp. LEXIS 4503, at *31 (Tex. App.—Beaumont June 16, 2011, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.). Thus, issue four is not preserved for appellate review.\n\n                                Supplemental Issue\n\n      In a supplemental issue, Fierro argues that the Texas Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in In re Bohannan, ___ S.W.3d ___, No. 10-0605, 2012 Tex. LEXIS 734\n\n(Tex. Aug. 31, 2012) (not yet released for publication) interpreted portions of the\n\nSVP statute in such a way as to render the statute facially unconstitutional. In\n\nBohannan, the Texas Supreme Court explained that a behavioral abnormality is a\n\ncondition that predisposes sexually violent conduct. Bohannan, 2012 Tex. LEXIS\n\n734, at *14. The Court explained that “condition and predisposition are one and the\n\nsame[,]” and “whether a person ‘suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fthe person likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence’ is a single,\n\nunified issue.” Id. at **16-17.\n\n      Fierro contends that Bohannan relieves the State of the burden of\n\ndemonstrating that a person has a mental illness or disorder. However, this Court\n\nhas previously concluded that “Bohannan did not eliminate any proof required by\n\nthe statute for a sexually-violent-predator finding, nor did the Supreme Court\n\nchange the statute or render it unconstitutional.” See In re Commitment of\n\nAnderson, ___ S.W.3d ___, No. 09-11-00613-CV, 2013 Tex. App. Lexis 607, at\n\n*17 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Jan. 24, 2013, no pet. h.) (not yet released for\n\npublication).
