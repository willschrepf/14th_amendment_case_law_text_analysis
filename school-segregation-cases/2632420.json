Change, Judge. Reversed in part and affirmed in part.\n\n        Law Office of Mark E. Merin and Mark E. Merin for Plaintiffs and Appellants.\n\n      James Sanchez, City Attorney, and Chance L.

Among other things,\nthey assert the ordinance is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to them. We\nwill reverse a portion of the trial court’s order sustaining the City’s demurrer. Although\nplaintiffs fail to meet their appellate burden on most of their claims, they state a cause of\naction for declaratory relief asserting an as-applied challenge based on equal protection.\n       A private property owner agreed that plaintiffs -- 22 homeless individuals and two\npeople providing services to the homeless -- could camp on his lot in a light industrial\narea of the City of Sacramento. City police informed plaintiffs that their camping\nviolated a City ordinance prohibiting extended camping on public or private property\nwithout a City permit. When plaintiffs continued to camp on the lot, the police gave\nthem citations on two occasions and removed their camping gear. Plaintiffs brought in\nother camping gear each time and continued their camping activities. The police\nultimately arrested them.\n       Plaintiffs sued the City, claiming the camping ordinance is unconstitutional and\nthe City enforces the ordinance in a discriminatory manner. The trial court sustained the\nCity’s demurrer with leave to amend. Rather than amend the complaint, the parties\nagreed judgment could be entered against plaintiffs and plaintiffs could appeal.\n       On appeal, plaintiffs raise many concerns about the plight of homeless individuals\nin the City. Among other things, they argue homeless individuals are forced to live\noutside because they lack employment opportunities, mental health treatment, and\nadequate shelter. But in considering these arguments, we must be mindful of our limited\nrole in this dispute. Our focus must be to determine whether plaintiffs have met their\nlegal burden on appeal, i.e., whether they have stated a cause of action in their first\namended complaint. It is not our role to determine appropriate City policy. Thus, as we\nconsider the City’s camping ordinance, we may not opine on the wisdom of the policies\nembodied in such legislation. (Superior Court v. County of Mendocino (1996) 13 Cal.4th\n45, 53.) “[A]bsent a constitutional prohibition, the choice among competing policy\n\n                                              2\n\fconsiderations in enacting laws is a legislative function.” (Ibid; see also Tobe v. City of\nSanta Ana (1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1092, fn. 12 (Tobe) [arguments regarding the\nintractable problem of homelessness and the impact of the challenged ordinance on\nhomeless persons should be addressed to legislative bodies, not the courts]; People v.\nKellogg (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 593, 605.)\n       Accordingly, in part I of this opinion, we will address plaintiffs’ contentions\npertaining to their first cause of action for declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs contend the\ntrial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to their first cause of action because (A) a\ndemurrer to a declaratory relief cause of action must be overruled whenever an actual\ncontroversy is alleged, (B) plaintiffs adequately stated a facial void-for-vagueness\nchallenge to the ordinance, and (C) plaintiffs adequately stated an as-applied\nconstitutional challenge to the ordinance based on (1) the Eighth Amendment prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment, (2) the right to travel, (3) equal protection and\nclass-based discrimination, (4) arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of laws, (5)\nsubstantive due process, and (6) protections regarding vague laws.\n       In part II of this opinion, we will analyze plaintiffs’ contention pertaining to their\nsecond cause of action for an injunction. Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in\nsustaining the demurrer to their second cause of action because their failure to cite\n“California Civil Code section 526(a)” should not foreclose injunctive relief.\n       Finally, in part III, we discuss plaintiffs’ contention pertaining to their third cause\nof action for violation of Civil Code section 52.1 [interference or attempt to interfere, by\nthreats, intimidation, or coercion, with exercise of rights]. Plaintiffs contend the trial\ncourt erred in sustaining the demurrer to their third cause of action because plaintiffs\nalleged facts constituting threats and coercion.\n       Regarding the first cause of action for declaratory judgment, we conclude (A) a\ngeneral demurrer is proper when the plaintiff does not allege facts sufficient to state a\nclaim; (B) plaintiffs have not stated a facial vagueness challenge because their camping\n\n                                               3\n\fclearly violated the ordinance; and (C) plaintiffs have not stated an as-applied challenge\nbased on cruel and unusual punishment (the ordinance punishes the act of camping and\ndoes not punish plaintiffs’ homeless status) or the right to travel (the ordinance has only\nan indirect impact on the right to travel, and the first amended complaint does not allege\npunishment for exercising the right to travel). But plaintiffs do state an as-applied\nchallenge based on equal protection.\n          Plaintiffs forfeited their as-applied claims asserting arbitrary and discriminatory\nenforcement and a violation of substantive due process, because they failed to provide\nany argument or citation to supporting authority in their opening brief regarding those\ncontentions. And they forfeited their as-applied claim regarding vagueness by failing to\nexplain how the ordinance is vague as applied to them.\n          Regarding the second cause of action for an injunction, the trial court did not err in\nsustaining the demurrer because an injunction is not a cause of action. As for the third\ncause of action for violation of Civil Code section 52.1, the trial court did not err because\nplaintiffs do not allege City police threatened violence and they do not allege threats,\nintimidation, or coercion independent of the coercion inherent in their detention and\narrest.\n          We will reverse the judgment with respect to the first cause of action for\ndeclaratory judgment asserting an as-applied challenge based on equal protection. We\nwill affirm the judgment in all other respects.\n                                        BACKGROUND\n          Because this case comes to us on a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action,\nwe accept as true the well-pleaded allegations in plaintiffs’ first amended complaint.\n(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) We draw the following\nfacts from that complaint.\n          There are at least 2,600 homeless persons in the City at any given time. Of that\nnumber, 1,200 to 1,300 homeless people do not have shelter each night.\n\n                                                4\n\f       Plaintiffs are part of a group of homeless men and women who stayed the night at\ndifferent public and private properties in the City in 2009. City police officers informed\nplaintiffs that staying overnight at those properties violated the City’s camping ordinance\nand could subject plaintiffs to arrest and loss of their personal property.\n       Sacramento City Code section 12.52.030 makes it “unlawful and a public nuisance\nfor any person to camp, occupy camp facilities, or use camp paraphernalia in . . . [a]ny\npublic property; or . . . [a]ny private property.” A violation of the ordinance is a\nmisdemeanor. (Sac. City Code, ch. 12.52, §§ 12.52.030, 12.52.040.)\n       The ordinance contains an exception for overnight camping on private residential\nproperty by friends or family of the property owner, so long as the owner consents and\nthe overnight camping is limited to not more than one consecutive night. (Sac. City\nCode, supra, at § 12.52.030.)\n       In addition, the City Manager may issue a temporary permit to allow camping on\npublic or private property in connection with a special event. (Sac. City Code, supra, at\n§ 12.52.030.) A special event includes programs operated by the City, youth or school\nevents, marathons or other sporting events, and scouting activities. (Id. at § 12.52.050.)\nThe city manager may consider any facts bearing on the sanitary, health, safety, and\nwelfare conditions of the area where the proposed temporary camp or camp facility is to\nbe located in issuing a permit. (Ibid.) The city manager may impose conditions on the\nestablishment, maintenance and operation of the camp or camp facility, including\nconditions relating to security, sanitation facilities, the number of occupants, posting of\nbonds or deposits, insurance, quiet hours, duration of the permit, and permitted activities\non the premises. (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.070.) A permit may be revoked if\nthe city manager determines the maintenance or continuing operation of the camp or\ncamp facilities is adverse to the public health, safety, and welfare. (Ibid.)\n       The camping ordinance states it is intended “to maintain streets, parks and other\npublic and private areas within the city in a clean, sanitary and accessible condition and\n\n                                              5\n\fto adequately protect the health, safety and public welfare of the community, while\nrecognizing that, subject to reasonable conditions, camping and camp facilities associated\nwith special events can be beneficial to the cultural and educational climate in the city.”\n(Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.010.) The Sacramento City Council recognized that\n“[t]he streets and public areas within the city should be readily accessible and available to\nresidents and the public at large. The use of these areas for camping purposes or storage\nof personal property interferes with the rights of others to use the areas for which they\nwere intended. Such activity can constitute a public health and safety hazard which\nadversely impacts neighborhoods and commercial areas. Camping on private property\nwithout the consent of the owner, proper sanitary measures and for other than a minimal\nduration adversely affects private property rights as well as public health, safety, and\nwelfare of the city.” (Ibid.)\n       The ordinance is not intended “to interfere with otherwise lawful and ordinary\nuses of public or private property.” (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.010.) It does not\nprohibit or make unlawful “activities of an owner of private property or other lawful user\nof private property that are normally associated with and incidental to the lawful and\nauthorized use of private property for residential or other purposes” and “activities are\nexpressly authorized by the Planning and Development Code or other laws, ordinances\nand regulations.” (Id. at § 12.52.030.)\n       The complaint alleges the City enacted the camping ordinance to discriminate\nagainst homeless persons. It further alleges the City has a policy and practice of\ndissuading homeless persons from entering the City or, if within the City, to drive them\nout of the City by selectively enforcing the ordinance against the homeless, even when\nthey are living on private property with the property owner’s consent.\n       Pursuant to a lease agreement, the owner of a fenced lot in a light industrial area of\nthe City agreed in 2009 to allow plaintiffs to live and store personal property at the lot\nuntil they qualified for shelter. About 30 people set up tents and stored their property at\n\n                                              6\n\fthe lot with the owner’s written permission. Portable toilets were also moved onto the\nproperty.\n       On September 2, 2009, City police officers detained all persons at the lot, seized\nand removed plaintiffs’ personal property including tents, sleeping bags and personal\nitems, and cited the detainees for violating the camping ordinance. Alleging they had\nnowhere else to go, plaintiffs obtained more tents and sleeping bags and remained at the\nlot.\n       On September 4, 2009, police officers again detained and cited plaintiffs for\nviolating the camping ordinance. Police seized and removed the additional tents,\nsleeping bags and personal items at the lot. Once again alleging they had nowhere else to\ngo, plaintiffs obtained more tents, sleeping bags and personal items, and remained at the\nlot.\n       On September 12, 2009, police officers arrested plaintiffs for violating the\ncamping ordinance and seized the tents, sleeping bags, tarps and personal items found at\nthe lot. The complaint alleges plaintiffs have had to search for places to sleep on other\npublic or private properties because no shelter was available to them. Plaintiffs fear\narrest and the confiscation of their property. Some homeless persons, including one of\nthe plaintiffs, have died while sleeping outdoors.\n       The first cause of action of plaintiffs’ first amended complaint seeks a declaration\nthat the camping ordinance is unconstitutional on its face and also as applied to homeless\npersons residing on private property in the City with the consent of the owner when no\npublic or private shelter is available to them. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the\nordinance (1) targets and discriminates against the homeless in the same way the\nordinance in Parr v. Municipal Court for Monterey (1971) 3 Cal.3d 861 (Parr)\ndiscriminated against “hippies;” (2) criminalizes the status of homelessness which is\nprohibited under Robinson v. California (1962) 370 U.S. 660 [8 L.Ed.2d 758]\n(Robinson); (3) is selectively enforced against the homeless; (4) interferes with the state\n\n                                              7\n\fand federal constitutional right to freedom of travel because the homeless are forced to\nleave the City at night in order to avoid arrest; (5) deprives homeless persons of equal\nprotection of the laws in that the City only enforces the ordinance against the homeless\nand their supporters; (6) deprives the homeless who have no access to a public or private\nshelter of substantive due process of law because they are not permitted to live in the City\nwithout the threat of arrest; and/or (7) contains terms which are unconstitutionally vague.\n       The second cause of action seeks an injunction against the selective enforcement\nof the camping ordinance, and the third cause of action asserts a violation of Civil Code\nsection 52.1. There was also a fourth cause of action which plaintiffs subsequently\nagreed to dismiss.\n       The trial court sustained the City’s demurrer to plaintiffs’ first, second and third\ncauses of action but granted leave to amend. Rather than filing a second amended\ncomplaint, however, plaintiffs agreed judgment could be entered against them in return\nfor the City’s agreement that plaintiffs could appeal.\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       When, as here, a demurrer to a complaint is sustained with leave to amend and the\nplaintiffs elect not to amend the complaint, the plaintiffs may test the validity of the order\nsustaining the demurrer by filing an appeal from the ensuing judgment of dismissal.\n(County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 312;\nOtworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 457.)\n       In reviewing a demurrer order, we independently evaluate the challenged pleading,\nconstruing it liberally, giving it a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole, and\nviewing its parts in context. (Milligan v. Golden Gate Bridge Highway & Transportation\nDist. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1, 5-6 (Milligan).) We treat the demurrer as admitting all\nmaterial facts properly pleaded, but we do not assume the truth of contentions, deductions\nor conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist., supra, 2 Cal.4th at pp. 966-967.)\nWe determine de novo whether the factual allegations of the challenged pleading are\n\n                                              8\n\fadequate to state a cause of action under any legal theory. (Milligan, supra, 120\nCal.App.4th at p. 6.) The constitutionality of an ordinance is also a question of law for\nour independent review. (Garcia v. Four Points Sheraton LAX (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th\n364, 381; Samples v. Brown (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 787, 799.)\n       The plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that the demurrer was sustained\nerroneously. (Friends of Shingle Springs Interchange, Inc. v. County of El Dorado\n(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1485.) We will affirm the judgment if proper on any\ngrounds stated in the demurrer, whether or not the trial court acted on that ground.\n(Carman v. Alvord (1982) 31 Cal.3d 318, 324.)\n       It is the responsibility of the appellant, here the plaintiffs, to support claims of\nerror with meaningful argument and citation to authority. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule\n8.204(a)(1)(B); Badie v. Bank of Am. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 784-785.) When legal\nargument with citation to authority is not furnished on a particular point, we may treat the\npoint as forfeited and pass it without consideration. (Okasaki v. City of Elk Grove (2012)\n203 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1045, fn. 1; Keyes v. Bowen (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 647, 656.)\nIn addition, citing cases without any discussion of their application to the present case\nresults in forfeiture. (Nelson v. Avondale Homeowners Assn. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th\n857, 862; Tilbury Constructors, Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th\n466, 482-483.) We are not required to examine undeveloped claims or to supply\narguments for the litigants. (Maral v. City of Live Oak (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 975, 984-\n985; Mansell v. Board of Administration (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 539, 546 [it is not the\ncourt’s function to serve as the appellant’s backup counsel].)\n       Moreover, we do not consider points raised for the first time in the reply brief\nabsent a showing of good cause for the failure to present them earlier. (Garcia v.\nMcCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 482, fn. 10; Neighbours v. Buzz Oates Enterprises\n(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 335, fn. 8 (Neighbours).) This rule is based on\nconsiderations of fairness; withholding a point until the closing brief deprives the\n\n                                               9\n\fopposing party of the opportunity to file a written response unless supplemental briefing\nis ordered. (Neighbours, supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p. 335.)\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                              I\n       Plaintiffs assert a number of arguments claiming the trial court erred in sustaining\nthe demurrer on their first cause of action for declaratory judgment. Plaintiffs contend\nthe trial court erred because (A) a demurrer to a declaratory relief cause of action must be\noverruled whenever an actual controversy is alleged, (B) plaintiffs adequately stated a\nfacial void-for-vagueness challenge to the camping ordinance, and (C) plaintiffs\nadequately stated an as-applied constitutional challenge to the ordinance based on (1) the\nEighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, (2) the right to\ntravel, (3) equal protection and class-based discrimination, (4) arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory enforcement of laws, (5) substantive due process, and (6) protections\nregarding vague laws. We address each argument in turn.\n                                             A\n       Plaintiffs claim the trial court should not have sustained the demurrer on their first\ncause of action for declaratory judgment because plaintiffs established the existence of an\nactual controversy. They claim a demurrer to a declaratory relief cause of action must be\noverruled whenever an actual controversy is alleged. We disagree.\n       Plaintiffs rely on Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82\nCal.App.4th 592 and Qualified Patients Assn. v. City of Anaheim (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th\n734, but those cases are inapposite as they involved orders disposing of a declaratory\nrelief cause of action following the grant of judgment on the pleadings or the sustaining\nof a demurrer without leave to amend. (Ludgate, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at pp. 596-597;\nQualified Patients, supra, 187 Cal.App.4th at p. 741.) Unlike in those cases, here the\ntrial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend but plaintiffs elected not to amend\ntheir complaint.\n\n                                             10\n\f       Nonetheless, even where the trial court sustains a demurrer without leave to\namend, we do not reverse the judgment if the trial court’s legal rulings are correct or\nwhen a different result would not be obtained. (Taxpayers for Improving Public Safety v.\nSchwarzenegger (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 749, 769; Coffman Specialties, Inc. v.\nDepartment of Transportation (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1144; Helmer v. Miller\n(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1565, 1569; Teachers Management & Inv. Corp. v. City of Santa\nCruz (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 438, 449; Tiburon v. Northwestern P. R. Co. (1970) 4\nCal.App.3d 160, 172, fn. 5; Peters v. State of California (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1421,\n1424.) A general demurrer to a declaratory relief cause of action is proper when the\nplaintiff does not allege facts sufficient to state the derivative claim. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 430.10, subd. (e); Ball v. FleetBoston Financial Corp. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 794,\n800.) Because plaintiffs’ declaratory judgment cause of action is based on their facial\nand as-applied challenges, the cause of action is dependent on the sufficiency of those\nclaims.\n                                              B\n       Plaintiffs next contend the trial court should not have sustained the demurrer on\ntheir first cause of action for declaratory judgment because they adequately stated a facial\nvoid-for-vagueness challenge to the camping ordinance.\n       A facial challenge to the constitutional validity of an ordinance considers only the\ntext of the ordinance, not its application to the plaintiffs’ particular circumstances. (Tobe,\nsupra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1084.) Our analysis begins with the strong presumption that the\nordinance is constitutionally valid. (Id. at p. 1107; City of San Diego v. Boggess (2013)\n216 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1503 (City of San Diego).) We resolve all doubts in favor of the\nvalidity of the ordinance. (City of San Diego, supra, 216 Cal.App.4th at p. 1503.) Unless\nconflict with a provision of the state or federal Constitution is clear and unmistakable, we\nmust uphold the ordinance. (Ibid.; Samples v. Brown, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at p. 799\n[same].) Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that the ordinance is\n\n                                             11\n\funconstitutional in all or most cases. (City of San Diego, supra, 216 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1504.)\n       Protections against vagueness are based on due process. To satisfy the\nconstitutional requirement of due process of law, a penal statute must (1) be sufficiently\ndefinite to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed, and (2) provide sufficiently\ndefinite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory\nenforcement. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1106-1107.) However, no more than a\nreasonable degree of certainty is required. (People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna (1997)\n14 Cal.4th 1090, 1117.) Thus, a statute is not void for uncertainty if any reasonable and\npractical construction can be given to its language. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1107.)\nAnd “ ‘[o]ften the requisite standards of certainty can be fleshed out from otherwise\nvague statutory language by reference to any of the following sources: (1) long\nestablished or commonly accepted usage; (2) usage at common law; (3) judicial\ninterpretations of the statutory language or of similar language; [and] (4) legislative\nhistory or purpose. [Citation.]’ ” (Ewing v. City of Carmel-By-The-Sea (1991)\n234 Cal.App.3d 1579, 1594; see also Samples v. Brown, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at pp.\n802-804.)\n       Plaintiffs claim the camping ordinance is unconstitutionally vague on its face\nbecause it does not contain standards to protect against arbitrary and discriminatory\nenforcement.1 But their contention fails because the ordinance clearly applied to their\n\n\n\n1 In their reply brief, plaintiffs assert for the first time that the ordinance is facially\ninvalid because it violates equal protection, substantive due process, the prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment, and the right to travel. Plaintiffs do not explain\nwhy they did not assert these facial contentions in their opening brief. Accordingly, we\nlimit our review to the claim that the ordinance is facially invalid because it is\nunconstitutionally vague. (Garcia v. McCutchen, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 482, fn. 10;\nNeighbours, supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p. 335, fn. 8.) In any event, a facial challenge on\nthe additional grounds raised in the reply brief appears to lack merit. The ordinance, on\n\n                                               12\n\fconduct, i.e., living temporarily outdoors or living in a tent on private property for more\nthan one consecutive night without a City permit. (Sac. City Code, supra, at\n§§ 12.52.020, 12.52.030; Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc. (1982) 455\nU.S. 489, 495 [71 L.Ed.2d 362, 369] [a facial challenge on vagueness grounds cannot\nsucceed where the plaintiff engaged in some conduct that is clearly proscribed by the\nstatute]; Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1095-1096 [same]; Joel v. City of Orlando (11th\nCir. 2000) 232 F.3d 1353, 1359 [same].) On its face, the ordinance makes it unlawful for\na person to “camp,” occupy “camp facilities,” or use “camp paraphernalia” in any “public\nproperty” or any “private property.” (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.030.) The word\n“camp” means “to place, pitch or occupy camp facilities; to live temporarily in a camp\nfacility or outdoors; to use camp paraphernalia.” (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.020.)\n“ ‘Camp facilities’ include, but are not limited to, tents, huts, vehicles, vehicle camping\noutfits or temporary shelter.” (Ibid.) “ ‘Camp paraphernalia’ includes, but is not limited\nto, bedrolls, tarpaulins, cots, beds, sleeping bags, hammocks or cooking facilities and\nsimilar equipment.” (Ibid.) “Public property” means all public property including\nstreets, sidewalks, alleys, improved or unimproved land, and parks. (Ibid.)2 “Private\n\n\nits face, does not restrict travel into or out of the City, does not discriminate based on\nresidency or duration of residency, and does not disclose the intent to discriminate against\nthe homeless. Unlike the “Declaration of Urgency” made by the City Council in Parr,\nsupra, 3 Cal.3d 861, here plaintiffs do not allege that the City made an official\npronouncement to discriminate against the homeless.\n2 Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 8.254, plaintiffs filed a letter notifying us of\nDesertrain v. City of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2014) 754 F.3d 1147. That case involved a\nfacial vagueness challenge to a Los Angeles ordinance which prohibited the “use [of] a\nvehicle parked or standing upon any City street, or upon any parking lot owned by the\nCity of Los Angeles and under the control of the City of Los Angeles or under control of\nthe Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors, as living quarters either\novernight, day-by-day, or otherwise.” (Id. at p. 1149.) The terms the Ninth Circuit Court\nof Appeal found unconstitutionally vague in the ordinance at issue in Desertrain v. City\nof Los Angeles are not found in the ordinance challenged in this case. (Id. at pp. 1155-\n1156.)\n\n                                              13\n\fproperty” means all private property including improved or unimproved land. (Ibid.)\nThe ordinance does not prohibit overnight camping on private residential property by\nfriends or family of the property owner, so long as the owner consents and the overnight\ncamping is limited to not more than one consecutive night. (Sac. City Code, supra, at\n§ 12.52.030.)\n       In their appellate reply brief, plaintiffs assert for the first time that the terms\n“friend,” “temporary shelter” and “one consecutive night” in the ordinance are also\nvague. We do not consider those contentions because plaintiffs did not raise them in their\nopening brief and there is no explanation for the delay in presenting those claims.\n(Garcia v. McCutchen, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 482, fn. 10; Neighbours, supra,\n217 Cal.App.3d at p. 335, fn. 8.) We also do not consider plaintiffs’ claim that the phrase\n“to live temporarily . . . outdoors” in the ordinance is vague because plaintiffs raised it for\nthe first time on appeal at oral argument. (Santa Clara County Local Transp. Auth. v.\nGuardino (1995) 11 Cal.4th 220, 232, fn. 6.)\n       The trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action based on\na facial challenge to the ordinance on vagueness grounds.\n                                               C\n       Plaintiffs claim the trial court should not have sustained the demurrer on their first\ncause of action for declaratory judgment because they adequately stated an as-applied\nconstitutional challenge to the camping ordinance.\n       An as-applied challenge asserts that the manner of enforcement against an\nindividual or class of individuals or the circumstances in which the ordinance is applied is\nunconstitutional. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1089.) “It contemplates analysis of the\nfacts of a particular case or cases to determine the circumstances in which the . . .\nordinance has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the\napplication deprived the individual to whom it was applied of a protected right.\n[Citations.] When a criminal defendant claims that a facially valid statute or ordinance\n\n                                               14\n\fhas been applied in a constitutionally impermissible manner to the defendant, the court\nevaluates the propriety of the application on a case-by-case basis to determine whether to\nrelieve the defendant of the sanction.” (Id. at p. 1084.) As with a facial challenge, we\npresume the ordinance is constitutional and must uphold it “unless its unconstitutionality\n‘clearly, positively and unmistakably appears.’ ” (Hale v. Morgan (1978) 22 Cal.3d 388,\n404.)\n        Specifically, plaintiffs’ as-applied challenge asserts arguments based on (1) the\nEighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, (2) the right to\ntravel, (3) equal protection and class-based discrimination, (4) arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory enforcement of laws, (5) substantive due process, and (6) protections\nregarding vague laws. 3\n                                              1\n        Plaintiffs claim the camping ordinance, as applied to them, violated their Eighth\nAmendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. They say the ordinance\nviolates the Eighth Amendment by “criminalizing the homeless condition.”\n        The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment in\nthree ways: it limits the type of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted of\ncrimes; it proscribes punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime; and\nit imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal. (Ingraham v. Wright (1977)\n430 U.S. 651, 667 [51 L.Ed.2d 711, 727-728].) The last limitation, which is at issue here,\nis “to be applied sparingly.” (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n3 The trial court did not address plaintiffs’ right to travel, substantive due process and\nvagueness claims because the parties did not explicitly discuss those claims.\nNonetheless, plaintiffs assert the right to travel, substantive due process and vagueness\nclaims in their as-applied challenge on appeal. The City does not argue that plaintiffs are\nnow barred from asserting the claims.\n\n                                             15\n\f       In Robinson, supra, 370 U.S. 660, the United States Supreme Court struck down a\nCalifornia statute which made it unlawful to be addicted to the use of narcotics. (Id. at\npp. 660, fn. 1, 667 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 759, fn. 1, 763].) The Supreme Court recognized that\nthe State can regulate the use of narcotics. (Id. at p. 664 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 761].) But it\nsaid the challenged statute and its construction by the state courts criminalized the status\nof narcotic addiction, irrespective of whether the defendant ever used or possessed any\nnarcotic within the state or engaged in any antisocial behavior there. (Id. at p. 666 [8\nL.Ed.2d at p. 763].) The Supreme Court likened the challenged statute to one that made\nit a crime for a person to be mentally ill or a leper. (Ibid.)\n       Under Robinson, criminalizing the status of being addicted to narcotics violates\nthe Eighth Amendment, but punishing the conduct of using narcotics, even by a narcotics\naddict, is not impermissible punishment for status. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1105.)\n       About six years after Robinson, the United States Supreme Court considered an\nEighth Amendment challenge to a Texas statute that made it a crime to “ ‘get drunk or be\nfound in a state of intoxication in any public place.’ ” (Powell v. Texas (1968) 392 U.S.\n514, 517, 532 [20 L.Ed.2d 1254, 1258, 1267] (Powell).) Although the defendant was a\nchronic alcoholic, a plurality of the Supreme Court upheld the statute because it punished\nbehavior (being drunk in public) that society had an interest in preventing; it did not\npunish the defendant’s status. (Ibid.) The plurality refused to read Robinson as finding\nan Eighth Amendment violation based on an involuntary condition or a condition\noccasioned by compulsion. (Id. at p. 533 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 1268].) The plurality said\nsuch an interpretation of Robinson would lead to a slippery slope: “it is difficult to see\nany limiting principle that would serve to prevent this Court from becoming, under the\naegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards\nof criminal responsibility . . . .” (Ibid.) “If Leroy Powell cannot be convicted of public\nintoxication, it is difficult to see how a State can convict an individual for murder, if that\nindividual, while exhibiting normal behavior in all other respects, suffers from a\n\n                                              16\n\f‘compulsion’ to kill . . . .” (Id. at p. 534) The plurality said “[t]raditional common-law\nconcepts of personal accountability and essential considerations of federalism” led them\nto reject the proposition that criminal penalties may not be imposed for a condition the\ndefendant was powerless to change. (Id. at pp. 533-535 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1268-1269];\nLehr v. City of Sacramento (E.D.Cal. 2009) 624 F.Supp.2d 1218, 1231 [expressing the\nsame concerns in a case challenging the constitutionality of Sacramento’s ordinance];\nJoyce v. City & County of San Francisco (N.D.Cal. 1994) 846 F.Supp. 843, 858 [same in\na case challenging the City of San Francisco’s actions in connection with the homeless].)\nThe Powell plurality also said it could not conclude the defendant suffered from an\nirresistible compulsion to drink and to get drunk in public. (Powell, supra, 392 U.S. at p.\n535 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 1269].)\n       In his concurring opinion in Powell, Justice White said it is not a crime to drink\nalcohol when the defendant has an irresistible compulsion to drink. (Powell, supra, 392\nU.S. at pp. 548-549, 552, fn. 4 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1276, 1278, fn. 4].) However, Justice\nWhite concluded the conviction should stand because there was no evidence the\ndefendant could not stay off the streets on the night in question or that his extreme\ndrunkenness sufficiently deprived him of his faculties that night. (Id. at pp. 552-554 [20\nL.Ed.2d at pp. 1278-1279].)\n       Some courts have interpreted Robinson and Powell as holding that the Eighth\nAmendment prohibits punishment of an act which is derivative of a person’s status or\ninvoluntary condition, i.e., that it violates the Eighth Amendment to punish an act which\nis an unavoidable consequence of a person’s status. (Pottinger v. Miami (S.D. Fla. 1992)\n810 F.Supp. 1551, 1562-1565 (Pottinger) [punishing the homeless for harmless acts they\nare forced to perform in public because of their involuntary condition of being homeless\nis cruel and unusual]; Jones v. City of L.A. (9th Cir. 2006) 444 F.3d 1118, 1135-1137,\nopinion vacated following settlement in Jones v. City of L.A. (9th Cir. 2007) 505 F.3d\n1006 [the Eighth Amendment prohibits the state from punishing a person for the\n\n                                             17\n\funavoidable consequences of being involuntarily homeless, i.e., sitting, lying down or\nsleeping in a public place].)\n       But being homeless is not necessarily equivalent to an involuntary condition or\nstatus. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1105 [homelessness is not readily classified as a\nstatus]; Lehr v. City of Sacramento, supra, 624 F.Supp.2d at p. 1222 [no generalization\ncan describe the diverse population of homeless people in Sacramento]; Joyce v. City &\nCounty of San Francisco, supra, 846 F.Supp. at pp. 857-858 [as an analytical matter,\nhomelessness is not readily classified as a status].) What constitutes a status “might\nelude perfect definition,” but factors such as the involuntary acquisition of the\ncharacteristic (including whether the characteristic was present at birth) and the degree to\nwhich a person has control over that characteristic determine whether a characteristic is a\nstatus. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1105.)\n       In Tobe, the California Supreme Court rejected the plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment\nclaim because it was not shown that the plaintiffs had no alternative to homelessness, to\nthe conduct that led them to homelessness, or to the violations under the ordinance.\n(Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1105-1106.) The Supreme Court reached that conclusion\ndespite evidence that on any given night at least 2,500 homeless persons in the city did\nnot have shelter beds available to them. (Id. at p. 1083.)\n       Here, the first amended complaint does not allege facts indicating that plaintiffs’\nhomelessness is a status. It alleges that the homeless plaintiffs had no shelter available to\nthem when City police officers detained and arrested them for violating the ordinance,\nbut it does not allege why plaintiffs had no shelter. (See Joyce v. City & County of San\nFrancisco, supra, 846 F.Supp. at p. 857 [refusing to find a status based on the\ndiscretionary acts of the city in failing to provide sufficient housing for the homeless];\nLehr v. City of Sacramento, supra, 624 F.Supp.2d at p. 1232 [same].) Plaintiffs elected\nnot to file a second amended complaint.\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\f       Other courts have declined to interpret Robinson and Powell as holding that the\nEighth Amendment bars punishment of an act derivative of a person’s status. (Joyce v.\nCity & County of San Francisco, supra, 846 F.Supp. at pp. 856-857 [extending Eighth\nAmendment protection to acts derivative of status is a dubious extension of Robinson and\nPowell, and questionable in light of concerns implicating federalism and the proper role\nof the court in such adjudications]; Lehr v. City of Sacramento, supra, 624 F.Supp.2d at\npp. 1231-1232 [disagreeing with Jones v. City of L.A., supra, 444 F.3d 1118].) In fact,\nthe California Supreme Court said Robinson and Powell did not hold that the Eighth\nAmendment prohibits punishment for acts derivative of a person’s status. (Tobe, supra, 9\nCal.4th at p. 1105.)\n       While the Court in Robinson observed that narcotic addiction is an illness which\nmay be contracted innocently or involuntarily, it did not say involuntariness made\nnarcotic addiction a status for which a person cannot constitutionally be punished.\n(Robinson, supra, 370 U.S. at p. 667 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].) The Court focused instead\non whether the defendant committed a prohibited act. (Id. at p. 667 [8 L.Ed.2d at\np. 763].) That is our focus too. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57\nCal.2d 450, 455.)\n       Sacramento’s ordinance punishes the acts of camping, occupying camp facilities,\nand using camp paraphernalia, not homelessness. (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.030;\nLehr v. City of Sacramento, supra, 624 F.Supp.2d at p. 1231.) The ordinance is\ndistinguishable from the statute in Robinson, which criminalized the status of being\naddicted to narcotics and did not require any act by the defendant. (Robinson, supra,\n370 U.S. at p. 666 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].) Because the Eighth Amendment does not\nprohibit the punishment of acts (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1105; Lehr v. City of\nSacramento, supra, 624 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1232, 1234; People v. Kellogg, supra,\n119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 596, 602-604), plaintiffs’ challenge based on cruel and unusual\npunishment lacks merit.\n\n                                            19\n\f                                               2\n  Plaintiffs also claim the ordinance, as applied to them, infringes on their constitutional\nright to travel.\n       The right to freedom of travel is constitutionally protected. (Tobe, supra, 9\nCal.4th at pp. 1096-1100.) Even so, our state courts have found a violation of the\nconstitutional right of intrastate travel only when there is a direct restriction on the right\nto travel, such as where a parent is ordered to move to another county as a condition of\ncontinued custody of a child. (Id. at p. 1101.) Otherwise lawful ordinances that have an\nindirect or incidental impact on the right to travel and do not discriminate among classes\nof persons by penalizing the exercise of the right to travel are not constitutionally\nimpermissible. (Id. at p. 1100.)\n       While the camping ordinance might discourage some homeless persons from\ntraveling into the City, it does not directly restrict the right to travel. (Tobe, supra, 9\nCal.4th at p. 1102 [an ordinance that bans camping and storing personal possessions on\npublic property does not directly impede the right to travel]; Sanchez v. City of Fresno\n(E.D. Cal. 2012) 914 F.Supp.2d 1079, 1109-1111 (Sanchez) [dismissing violation of right\nto travel claim even though the complaint alleged defendants’ policies singled out the\nhomeless; seizing and destroying the property of homeless persons had an incidental\nimpact on travel]; Johnson v. City of Dallas (N.D. Texas 1994) 860 F.Supp. 344, 346,\n354, reversed on another ground in Johnson v. City of Dallas (5th Cir. 1995) 61 F.3d 442\n[ordinances that prohibit sleeping in public space do not implicate the right to travel].)\nThe ordinance does not bar anyone from entering into or leaving the City.\n       Plaintiffs nevertheless claim that homeless persons are effectively prevented from\ntraveling to Sacramento. They also allege, however, that they reside in the City,\nindicating that the camping ordinance did not bar their entry into the City if they traveled\nthere. While laws that use a classification that serves to penalize the exercise of the right\nto travel are unconstitutional (Sanchez, supra, 914 F.Supp.2d at p. 1109), the first\n\n                                               20\n\famended complaint does not allege the homeless plaintiffs were punished because they\nexercised their right to travel to Sacramento. The first amended complaint alleges\nplaintiffs were penalized for illegal camping.\n       Plaintiffs also complain that the City prevented them from remaining in particular\nareas within the City. However, the right to travel does not give plaintiffs the right to live\nor stay where they want. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1103; see also Davison v. City of\nTucson (D.Ariz. 1996) 924 F.Supp. 989, 993 [right to travel is not implicated where\nhomeless plaintiffs do not seek to travel anywhere and seek only to remain in the city].)\nAnd the City has no constitutional obligation to provide homeless persons with\naccommodations to facilitate their exercise of the right to travel. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th\nat p. 1103.)\n       In addition, unlike the state law challenged in Attorney General of N.Y. v. Soto-\nLopez (1986) 476 U.S. 898, 905 [90 L.Ed.2d 899, 907], Sacramento’s ordinance does not\ndistinguish between residents and non-residents or on the basis of the duration of\nresidency, classifications which have been held to violate the right to travel. (Tobe,\nsupra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1101 [ordinance was nondiscriminatory in right to travel context\nbecause it applied to residents and nonresidents alike].) Plaintiffs assert we should not\nconsider the California Supreme Court’s analysis in Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th 1069, because\nthe ordinance in that case did not ban camping on private property. But the Supreme\nCourt’s reasoning was not based on whether the ban applied to public or private property.\n(Id. at pp. 1096-1104.)\n       Plaintiffs also cite Pottinger, supra, 810 F.Supp. 1551. The district court in that\ncase held the city’s enforcement of ordinances, such as those for loitering and for\nobstructing the sidewalk, significantly burdened the right of the homeless to travel. (Id.\nat pp. 1580-1581.) Subjecting the city’s enforcement activities to strict scrutiny, the\ndistrict court concluded the city’s interest in maintaining public areas and promoting\ntourism and business in its downtown area was not compelling, and its actions were not\n\n                                             21\n\fnarrowly tailored to achieve its objective of preventing health hazards. (Id. at pp. 1581-\n1582.)\n         Pottinger is not controlling for a number of reasons. The ordinances at issue in\nPottinger were broader in scope than the ordinance at issue in this case. (Pottinger,\nsupra, 810 F.Supp. at pp. 1554-1555 [homeless persons were punished for sleeping,\neating, standing and congregating in public places].) In addition, the cases cited in\nPottinger involved the grant or denial of benefits based on past residency or duration of\nresidency or laws that barred or expressly regulated travel. (Pottinger, supra, 810\nF.Supp. at pp. 1578-1580.) Such measures, which have been found to infringe on the\nfundamental right to travel, are not found in Sacramento’s ordinance. Moreover,\nPottinger has been rejected by other courts. (Sanchez, supra, 914 F.Supp.2d at p. 1111\n[the bulk of authority has rejected or declined to follow Pottinger’s right to travel holding\nin cases concerning policies designed to prevent homeless persons from erecting shelters\nand/or leaving their belongings in particular places]; Davison v. City of Tuscon, supra,\n924 F.Supp. at p. 994 [Pottinger has been rejected in at least four other cases]; Joyce v.\nCity & County of San Francisco, supra, 846 F.Supp. at pp. 860-861 [refusing to follow\nPottinger].) And we are not bound to follow the decisions of lower federal courts.\n(People v. Crittenden (1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 120, fn. 3.)\n         We conclude the first amended complaint does not state a cause of action based on\nthe infringement of plaintiffs’ right to travel because the ordinance has only an indirect\nimpact on the right to travel and the first amended complaint does not allege plaintiffs\nwere punished for exercising their right to travel.\n                                                3\n         Plaintiffs next claim the ordinance, as applied to them, violated their right to equal\nprotection of the laws and to be free from class-based discrimination.\n         Equal protection under the federal and California Constitutions requires equal\ntreatment of persons similarly situated. (City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.\n\n                                               22\n\f(1985) 473 U.S. 432, 439 [87 L.Ed.2d 313, 320] (Cleburne); Brown v. Merlo (1973) 8\nCal.3d 855, 861.) Even when a law is nondiscriminatory on its face, equal protection is\nviolated if the law is applied in a manner that discriminates against a particular group.\n(U. S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno (1973) 413 U.S. 528, 534-535 [37 L.Ed.2d 782,\n788]; Joyce v. City & County of San Francisco, supra, 846 F.Supp. at p. 858 [“a neutral\nlaw found to have a disproportionately adverse effect upon a minority classification will\nbe deemed unconstitutional only if that impact can be traced to a discriminatory\npurpose”].)\n       “[I]f the constitutional conception of ‘equal protection of the laws’ means\nanything, it must at the very least mean that a bare . . . desire to harm a politically\nunpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.” (U. S. Dept. of\nAgriculture v. Moreno, supra, 413 U.S. at pp. 534-535 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 788], italics\nomitted; Parr, supra, 3 Cal.3d at pp. 868, 864-868 [equal protection clause requires\nstatutory classifications to be related to permissible purposes].) Even under the more\nlenient rational relationship test, discriminatory animus toward a group is not a valid state\nobjective. (Cleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at pp. 446-447 [87 L.Ed.2d at p. 325] [irrational\nprejudice against the “mentally retarded”]; U. S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno, supra,\n413 U.S. at pp. 534-535 [37 L.Ed.2d at p. 788] [discrimination against “hippies”].)\n       The first amended complaint alleges the City selectively enforces the camping\nordinance against homeless persons and those non-homeless persons who support the\nright of the homeless to be in the City. We must read those factual allegations liberally\nand assume their truth on a demurrer. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist., supra, 2 Cal.4th\nat pp. 966-967; Milligan, supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at pp. 5-6.) Contrary to the City’s\nassertion, the California Supreme Court in Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th 1069 did not decide\nwhat a plaintiff must plead in order to state an equal protection claim. (Id. at p. 1080,\nfn. 1.) Although the court in Tobe indicated that the Tobe plaintiffs “did not clearly\nallege” an as-applied challenge (id. at p. 1083), that was in a completely different\n\n                                              23\n\fprocedural posture. In those consolidated actions, the Zuckernick matter involved\npersons charged with violating an ordinance who demurred unsuccessfully to the criminal\ncomplaint and then filed a writ petition to compel the trial court to sustain their\ndemurrers. (Id. at pp. 1081-1082.) The Supreme Court held the procedural posture of\nthat action precluded an as-applied challenge. (Id. at p. 1083.) The Tobe matter involved\npersons who challenged enforcement of an ordinance by petition for writ of mandate and\nappealed the trial court’s order. (Id. at pp. 1081-1082.) The Supreme Court held the\nTobe plaintiffs did not clearly allege an as-applied challenge or seek relief from specific\nallegedly impermissible applications of the ordinance. (Id. at p. 1083.) Unlike in Tobe,\nthe plaintiffs in this case filed a civil complaint asserting an as-applied challenge, not a\npetition for writ of mandate or a demurrer to a criminal complaint.\n       Here, we conclude the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for\ndeclaratory relief asserting an as-applied challenge based on equal protection. (Murgia v.\nMunicipal Court for Bakersfield Judicial Dist. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 286, 301 [allegation of\ndeliberate practice of discriminatory enforcement of criminal laws against members of a\nparticular labor organization is sufficient to support equal protection clause claim];\nAshbaucher v. City of Arcata (N.D.Cal., August 19, 2010, No. CV 08-2840 MHP (NJV))\n2010 U.S. Dist.

Lexis 67519, p. *8\n[same].)4 We need not, and do not, determine whether plaintiffs can ultimately prevail\non this cause of action. (Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 496.)\n\n\n\n\n4 We may cite and rely on unpublished federal district court decisions as persuasive\nauthority. (Mendoza v. City of West Covina (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 702, 717, fn. 13.)\n\n                                              24\n\f                                              4\n       Plaintiffs further claim the camping ordinance, as applied to them, violated their\nright to be free from arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. But they do not explain\nwhy; they merely cite City of Chicago v. Morales (1999) 527 U.S. 41 [144 L.Ed.2d 67],\nand Long Beach Area Peace Network v. City of Long Beach (2009) 574 F.3d 1011,\nwithout further argument or explanation.5 Accordingly, the undeveloped claim is\nforfeited. (Nelson v. Avondale Homeowners Assn., supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 862;\nDills v. Redwoods Associates, Ltd. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 888, 890, fn. 1 [we need not\nreach issues presented without argument and we will not develop the appellants’\narguments for them].)\n                                              5\n       In addition, plaintiffs claim the ordinance, as applied to them, violated their right\nto substantive due process. But once again, they do not provide any further explanation\nin their opening brief. Accordingly, the contention is forfeited for failure to support it\nwith argument or citation to authority. (Okasaki v. City of Elk Grove, supra, 203\nCal.App.4th at p. 1045, fn. 1; Keyes v. Bowen, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 656.)\nAlthough plaintiffs made belated arguments relating to substantive due process for the\nfirst time in their reply brief, we do not consider those arguments because plaintiffs do\nnot explain the delayed presentation of those arguments. (Garcia v. McCutchen, supra,\n16 Cal.4th at p. 482, fn. 10; Neighbours, supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p. 335, fn. 8.)\n\n\n\n\n5 In their reply brief, plaintiffs cite Sanchez, supra, 914 F.Supp.2d 1079, but that case is\ninapposite. Unlike in Sanchez, the applicable pleading in this case does not allege that\nthe City placed plaintiffs in a situation of known danger with deliberate indifference to\ntheir safety. Moreover, plaintiffs did not argue in the trial court that the first amended\ncomplaint states a substantive due process claim based on the “danger creation” doctrine.\n(Sanchez, supra, 914 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1101-1102 [discussing “danger creation”\ndoctrine].)\n\n                                             25\n\f                                              6\n       Plaintiffs claim the ordinance, as applied to them, violated their right to be free\nfrom vague laws. Once again, however, they forfeited this claim by failing to explain\nhow the ordinance is vague as applied to them. (Nelson v. Avondale Homeowners Assn.,\nsupra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 862; Tilbury Constructors, Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund,\nsupra, 137 Cal.App.4th at pp. 482-483.) The claim also fails on the merits, because\nplaintiffs’ conduct clearly violated the ordinance. The ordinance prohibits placing or\noccupying tents on any private property for more than one consecutive night without a\nCity permit. (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.030.) The first amended complaint\nalleges that plaintiffs “continued to live” at a privately owned lot where they set up tents\nfor several days.\n                                              II\n       Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the second cause\nof action for an injunction. They say their failure to cite “California Civil Code section\n526(a)” should not foreclose their ability to seek injunctive relief. We assume they\nintended to reference Code of Civil Procedure section 526, subdivision (a).\n       In any event, we conclude the trial court did not err. The second cause of action\nseeks an order enjoining the enforcement of the ordinance. Injunctive relief is a remedy,\nnot a cause of action. (Roberts v. Los Angeles County Bar Assn. (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th\n604, 618; McDowell v. Watson (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1159.) A cause of action\nmust exist before a court may grant a request for injunctive relief. (County of Del Norte\nv. City of Crescent City (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 965, 973; City of South Pasadena v.\nDepartment of Transportation (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1280, 1293 [“ ‘A permanent\ninjunction is merely a remedy for a proven cause of action. It may not be issued if the\nunderlying cause of action is not established.’ ”]; Camp v. Board of Supervisors (1981)\n123 Cal.App.3d 334, 356.)\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f       Although the order sustaining the demurrer was proper because an injunction is\nnot a cause of action, plaintiffs may still obtain injunctive relief if they prevail on a cause\nof action. (6 Witkin, California Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Provisional Remedies, § 331,\npp. 275-276; see, e.g., Attorney General of N.Y. v. Soto-Lopez, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 901\n[90 L.Ed.2d at p. 904].)\n                                              III\n       Plaintiffs also contend the first amended complaint states a cause of action for\nviolation of Civil Code section 52.1.6 Section 52.1, also known as the Tom Bane Civil\nRights Act, authorizes an action for injunctive and other equitable relief where a person,\nwhether or not acting under color of law, interferes or attempts to interfere, “by threat,\nintimidation, or coercion,” with the exercise or enjoyment by any individual or\nindividuals of rights secured by state or federal law. (§ 52.1, subd. (a).)\n       We begin by noting what plaintiffs do not assert. The first amended complaint\ndoes not allege the use of excessive or unreasonable force by the police, and plaintiffs do\nnot contend on appeal that this is an excessive force case. Plaintiffs also do not claim on\nappeal that the first amended complaint alleges any intimidation by the City.\n       Rather, plaintiffs argue the first amended complaint alleges “threats” within the\nmeaning of section 52.1. Plaintiffs point to the allegations in paragraphs 4 and 10 of the\nfirst amended complaint that City police officers threatened to arrest homeless persons\nwho had gathered at two locations other than the lot plaintiffs leased in 2009 and also\nthreatened to confiscate their property. Even if we assume those allegations apply to\nplaintiffs, however, “[s]peech alone is not sufficient to support an action brought pursuant\nto [section 52.1] subdivision (a) or (b), except upon a showing that the speech itself\nthreatens violence against a specific person or group of persons; and the person or group\n\n\n\n\n6 Undesignated statutory references are to the Civil Code.\n\n\n                                              27\n\fof persons against whom the threat is directed reasonably fears that, because of the\nspeech, violence will be committed against them or their property and that the person\nthreatening violence had the apparent ability to carry out the threat.” (§ 52.1, subd. (j).)\nWhile plaintiffs say in their reply brief they had a reasonable belief violence would result\nshould they disobey the orders of the police officers, the first amended complaint does\nnot allege a police officer threatened any plaintiff with violence.\n       In addition, plaintiffs argue the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges\n“coercion” because City police officers arrested plaintiffs and an arrest is inherently\ncoercive. The first amended complaint alleges City police officers “forcibly detained”\npersons at the lot where plaintiffs lived, “forcibly detained and cited plaintiffs on the\nproperty . . . for illegal camping,” arrested plaintiffs for violating the ordinance,\n“coercively violated plaintiffs’ rights under the 4th and 14th Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution (namely, unreasonable search and seizure, violation of due process, and\nviolation of equal protection of the laws)” and “coercively interfered with the exercise\nand/or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution of the state of California, Article\n1, §§ 1, 7 and 13 (namely, unreasonable search and seizure, deprivation of life, liberty\nand property, without due process of law).” Plaintiffs say the actions of the police are\ninherently coercive because of their “unique position of trust” in society.\n       There are two distinct elements for a section 52.1 cause of action. A plaintiff must\nshow (1) intentional interference or attempted interference with a state or federal\nconstitutional or legal right, and (2) the interference or attempted interference was by\nthreats, intimidation or coercion. (Jones v. Kmart Corp. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 329, 334\n[section 52.1 requires an attempted or completed act of interference with a legal right,\naccompanied by a form of coercion]; Shoyoye v. County of Los Angeles (2012) 203\nCal.App.4th 947, 958 (Shoyoye) [incidental interference brought about by negligent\nconduct is not sufficient].) The California Supreme Court has not addressed whether an\nunlawful detention or arrest, without more, is sufficient to satisfy both elements of\n\n                                              28\n\fsection 52.1. While the California Supreme Court said in Venegas v. County of Los\nAngeles (2004) 32 Cal.4th 820 (Venegas) that the plaintiffs in that case stated a section\n52.1 cause of action based on an unreasonable search and seizure, the only issue the\nSupreme Court considered was whether section 52.1 required a showing that the\ndefendants acted with discriminatory animus. (Id. at pp. 841, 843 [“All we decide here is\nthat, in pursuing relief for those constitutional violations under section 52.1, plaintiffs\nneed not allege that defendants acted with discriminatory animus or intent, so long as\nthose acts were accompanied by the requisite threats, intimidation, or coercion.”].) A\ncase is not authority for propositions not considered and decided.7 (In re Chavez (2003)\n30 Cal.4th 643, 656.)\n       Nonetheless, Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th 947, is instructive. In that case, the\nplaintiff was lawfully arrested but was held more than two weeks after the order for his\nrelease; a county employee mistakenly attached information about another person to the\ndefendant’s paperwork. (Id. at pp. 951-953.) The plaintiff claimed interference with his\nconstitutional right to be secure against unreasonable seizure. (Id. at p. 955.) Relying on\na case which adopted the analysis in Longval v. Commissioner of Correction (1989) 535\nN.E.2d 588 [404 Mass. 325] (Longval), the appellate court in Shoyoye held that where\ncoercion is inherent in the constitutional violation alleged, as it is in an unreasonably\nprolonged detention, section 52.1 requires a showing of coercion independent from the\n\n\n\n\n7 For the same reason, Gillan v. City of San Marino (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1033\n(Gillan), a case plaintiffs cite, is not helpful. There is no discussion in Gillan about what\nconstitutes “threats, intimidation, or coercion” under section 52.1. Plaintiffs cite Quinn v.\nFresno County Sheriff (E.D.Cal., Dec. 14, 2012, No. 1:10-CV-01617 LJO BAM) 2012\nWL 6561562 (Quinn) for the first time in their reply brief. Even if it were proper for us\nto consider Quinn, it is not persuasive because it failed to apply the reasoning in Shoyoye,\nsupra, 203 Cal.App.4th 947, and relied instead on Gillan, a case which, as we have\nexplained, did not analyze the “threats, intimidation, or coercion” element of section\n52.1. (Quinn, supra, 2012 WL 6561562, at p. *5.)\n\n                                              29\n\fcoercion inherent in the wrongful detention. (Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at pp.\n959-960 [citing Gant v. County of Los Angeles (C.D.Cal. 2011) 765 F.Supp.2d 1238].)8\n       The court in Longval, supra, 535 N.E.2d 588, construed the Massachusetts Civil\nRights Act of 1979, upon which California modeled section 52.1.9 Longval involved the\ntransfer of the plaintiff to an administrative segregation unit in another prison allegedly\nwithout a required hearing and without required approvals. (Longval, supra, 535 N.E.2d\nat p. 590.) The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled the use of force by prison officials in\nplacing a prisoner in the segregated unit does not constitute coercion under the\nMassachusetts Civil Rights Act, even if it turned out the prison officials had no lawful\nright to take that action. (Id. at pp. 590, 593.) The Court in Longval said conduct that\n“take[s] someone’s rights away directly,” even if unlawful, does not satisfy the\nrequirement of “threats, intimidation or coercion” under the Massachusetts Civil Rights\nAct. (Longval, supra, 535 N.E.2d at p. 593; see also Santiago v. Keyes (D.Mass. 2012)\n890 F.Supp.2d 149, 155-156 [the constitutional violation itself cannot also serve as the\n\n\n\n8 The district court in Gant adopted the holding in Longval, stating that when use of\nforce is intrinsic to the alleged constitutional violation, it cannot also satisfy the\nadditional “coercion” element of section 52.1. (Gant, supra, 765 F.Supp.2d at p. 1253.)\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reversed the district court’s judgment in part\nbecause, as to one of the public entity defendants, the appellate court found a genuine\nissue of fact regarding whether police officers coerced the plaintiff to make an untrue\nstatement. (Gant v. County of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2014) 772 F.3d 608, 623-624.) The\nNinth Circuit did not disagree with the district court’s interpretation of section 52.1, and\naffirmed the district court’s judgment as to the plaintiffs’ other section 52.1 claims in a\nseparately issued memorandum. (Id. at p. 623, fn. 1; Gant v. County of Los Angeles (9th\nCir. Nov. 24, 2014) 2014 U.S. App. Lexis 22192, at pp. *4, 9.)\n9 Like California, Massachusetts authorizes a personal right of action “[w]henever any\nperson or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interfere by threats,\nintimidation or coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, with\nthe exercise or enjoyment by any other person or persons of rights secured by the\nconstitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws\nof the commonwealth.” (Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 12, §§ 11H, 11I.)\n\n                                             30\n\fprerequisite conduct under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act; the statute requires\nthreats, coercion or intimidation in addition to a constitutional violation, and the plaintiff\ncannot graft one act onto two distinct burdens].)\n       Similar to Shoyoye, this case involves an allegedly unlawful arrest but no alleged\ncoercion beyond the coercion inherent in any arrest. (Cf. Bender v. County of Los\nAngeles (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 968, 978 [although coercion is inherent in any arrest,\nwhere an arrest is unlawful and excessive force is applied, there is coercion independent\nof the wrongful detention].) Consistent with Shoyoye, we conclude a wrongful arrest or\ndetention, without more, does not satisfy both elements of section 52.1. (Shoyoye, supra,\n203 Cal.App.4th at p. 960.) The conclusory allegations of “forcible” and “coercive”\ninterference with plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are inadequate to state a cause of action\nfor a violation of section 52.1. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist., supra, 2 Cal.4th at pp.\n966-967 [we do not assume the truth of conclusions of law]; Maystruk v. Infinity Ins. Co.\n(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 881, 888 [conclusions without allegations of facts were fatal to\nthe complaint].)\n       Plaintiffs cite Cole v. Doe (N.D.Cal. 2005) 387 F.Supp.2d 1084 (Cole), Butler v.\nCity of Sacramento (E.D.Cal., Aug. 7, 2007, No. CIV. S-07-755 LKK/DAD) 2007 WL\n2275218 (Butler), and Ohlsen v. County of San Joaquin (E.D.Cal., June 4, 2008, No.\n2:06-CV-2361-GEB-GGH) 2008 WL 2331996 (Ohlsen). Cole predates Shoyoye. The\ndistrict court in Cole held that the use of law enforcement authority to effectuate a stop,\ndetention and search can constitute interference with the plaintiff’s right to be free from\nan unreasonable search or seizure by threat, intimidation or coercion if the officer lacked\nprobable cause to stop, detain and search the plaintiff. (Cole, supra, 387 F.Supp.2d at p.\n1103.) Butler and Ohlsen rely on the holding in Cole. (Butler, supra, 2007 WL\n2275218, at pp. *6-7; Ohlsen, supra, 2008 WL 2331996, at p. *4.) But none of the cases\nthe district court in Cole relied upon -- Venegas, supra, 32 Cal.4th 820, Jones v. Kmart\nCorp., supra, 17 Cal.4th 329, or Whitworth v. City of Sonoma (September 22, 2004,\n\n                                              31\n\fA103342) [nonpub. opn.] -- held that a wrongful arrest or detention, without more,\nconstitutes threats, intimidation or coercion under section 52.1 where the arrest is itself\nthe alleged constitutional violation. (Cole, supra, 387 F.Supp.2d at p. 1103.) Hence,\nCole is not persuasive. (Shoyoye, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 960 [also rejecting Cole].)\n       Plaintiffs also rely on Moreno v. Town of Los Gatos (9th Cir. 2008) 267 Fed.Appx.\n665 (Moreno), another case which predates Shoyoye. The court in Moreno said the\nplaintiffs stated a section 52.1 cause of action by alleging that police officers threatened\nto arrest some of the plaintiffs and actually arrested others. (Moreno, supra, 267\nFed.Appx. at p. 666.) But again, the holding in Moreno was based on Venegas, supra, 32\nCal.4th 820, Jones v. Kmart Corp., supra, 17 Cal.4th 329, and another case, Stamps v.\nSuperior Court (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1441. (Moreno, supra, 267 Fed.Appx. at p. 666.)\nBecause none of those cases addressed whether an arrest or threat of arrest constitutes\nthreats, intimidation or coercion, Moreno is also not persuasive.\n       Plaintiffs further argue in their reply brief that even if they are required to allege\nfacts showing threats, intimidation or coercion independent of the coercion inherent in a\nwrongful arrest or detention, they can do so because the enactment of the ordinance is the\nalleged constitutional violation, and the arrest of plaintiffs is an act of coercion\nindependent of the enactment of the ordinance. But plaintiffs raised this argument for the\nfirst time in their reply brief, they did not assert it in the trial court, and they do not cite\nlegal authority supporting their theory. “Obvious reasons of fairness militate against our\nconsidering this poorly developed and untimely argument.” (Garcia v. McCutchen,\nsupra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 482, fn. 10.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\f                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is reversed as to the first cause of action for declaratory judgment\nasserting an as-applied challenge based on equal protection.

Among other things,\nthey assert the ordinance is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to them. We\nwill reverse a portion of the trial court’s order sustaining the City’s demurrer. Although\nplaintiffs fail to meet their appellate burden on most of their claims, they state a cause of\naction for declaratory relief asserting an as-applied challenge based on equal protection.\n       A private property owner agreed that plaintiffs -- 22 homeless individuals and two\npeople providing services to the homeless -- could camp on his lot in a light industrial\narea of the City of Sacramento. City police informed plaintiffs that their camping\nviolated a City ordinance prohibiting extended camping on public or private property\nwithout a City permit. When plaintiffs continued to camp on the lot, the police gave\nthem citations on two occasions and removed their camping gear. Plaintiffs brought in\nother camping gear each time and continued their camping activities. The police\nultimately arrested them.\n       Plaintiffs sued the City, claiming the camping ordinance is unconstitutional and\nthe City enforces the ordinance in a discriminatory manner. The trial court sustained the\nCity’s demurrer with leave to amend. Rather than amend the complaint, the parties\nagreed judgment could be entered against plaintiffs and plaintiffs could appeal.\n       On appeal, plaintiffs raise many concerns about the plight of homeless individuals\nin the City. Among other things, they argue homeless individuals are forced to live\noutside because they lack employment opportunities, mental health treatment, and\nadequate shelter. But in considering these arguments, we must be mindful of our limited\nrole in this dispute. Our focus must be to determine whether plaintiffs have met their\nlegal burden on appeal, i.e., whether they have stated a cause of action in their first\namended complaint. It is not our role to determine appropriate City policy. Thus, as we\nconsider the City’s camping ordinance, we may not opine on the wisdom of the policies\nembodied in such legislation.

Plaintiffs contend the\ntrial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to their first cause of action because (A) a\ndemurrer to a declaratory relief cause of action must be overruled whenever an actual\ncontroversy is alleged, (B) plaintiffs adequately stated a facial void-for-vagueness\nchallenge to the ordinance, and (C) plaintiffs adequately stated an as-applied\nconstitutional challenge to the ordinance based on (1) the Eighth Amendment prohibition\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment, (2) the right to travel, (3) equal protection and\nclass-based discrimination, (4) arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of laws, (5)\nsubstantive due process, and (6) protections regarding vague laws.\n       In part II of this opinion, we will analyze plaintiffs’ contention pertaining to their\nsecond cause of action for an injunction. Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in\nsustaining the demurrer to their second cause of action because their failure to cite\n“California Civil Code section 526(a)” should not foreclose injunctive relief.\n       Finally, in part III, we discuss plaintiffs’ contention pertaining to their third cause\nof action for violation of Civil Code section 52.1 [interference or attempt to interfere, by\nthreats, intimidation, or coercion, with exercise of rights]. Plaintiffs contend the trial\ncourt erred in sustaining the demurrer to their third cause of action because plaintiffs\nalleged facts constituting threats and coercion.\n       Regarding the first cause of action for declaratory judgment, we conclude (A) a\ngeneral demurrer is proper when the plaintiff does not allege facts sufficient to state a\nclaim; (B) plaintiffs have not stated a facial vagueness challenge because their camping\n\n                                               3\n\fclearly violated the ordinance; and (C) plaintiffs have not stated an as-applied challenge\nbased on cruel and unusual punishment (the ordinance punishes the act of camping and\ndoes not punish plaintiffs’ homeless status) or the right to travel (the ordinance has only\nan indirect impact on the right to travel, and the first amended complaint does not allege\npunishment for exercising the right to travel). But plaintiffs do state an as-applied\nchallenge based on equal protection.\n          Plaintiffs forfeited their as-applied claims asserting arbitrary and discriminatory\nenforcement and a violation of substantive due process, because they failed to provide\nany argument or citation to supporting authority in their opening brief regarding those\ncontentions. And they forfeited their as-applied claim regarding vagueness by failing to\nexplain how the ordinance is vague as applied to them.\n          Regarding the second cause of action for an injunction, the trial court did not err in\nsustaining the demurrer because an injunction is not a cause of action. As for the third\ncause of action for violation of Civil Code section 52.1, the trial court did not err because\nplaintiffs do not allege City police threatened violence and they do not allege threats,\nintimidation, or coercion independent of the coercion inherent in their detention and\narrest.\n          We will reverse the judgment with respect to the first cause of action for\ndeclaratory judgment asserting an as-applied challenge based on equal protection. We\nwill affirm the judgment in all other respects.\n                                        BACKGROUND\n          Because this case comes to us on a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action,\nwe accept as true the well-pleaded allegations in plaintiffs’ first amended complaint.\n(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399294\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399294/aubry-v-tri-city-hospital-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 966-967.) We draw the following\nfacts from that complaint.\n          There are at least 2,600 homeless persons in the City at any given time. Of that\nnumber, 1,200 to 1,300 homeless people do not have shelter each night.\n\n                                                4\n\f       Plaintiffs are part of a group of homeless men and women who stayed the night at\ndifferent public and private properties in the City in 2009. City police officers informed\nplaintiffs that staying overnight at those properties violated the City’s camping ordinance\nand could subject plaintiffs to arrest and loss of their personal property.\n       Sacramento City Code section 12.52.030 makes it “unlawful and a public nuisance\nfor any person to camp, occupy camp facilities, or use camp paraphernalia in . . . [a]ny\npublic property; or . . . [a]ny private property.” A violation of the ordinance is a\nmisdemeanor. (Sac. City Code, ch. 12.52, §§ 12.52.030, 12.52.040.)\n       The ordinance contains an exception for overnight camping on private residential\nproperty by friends or family of the property owner, so long as the owner consents and\nthe overnight camping is limited to not more than one consecutive night. (Sac. City\nCode, supra, at § 12.52.030.)\n       In addition, the City Manager may issue a temporary permit to allow camping on\npublic or private property in connection with a special event. (Sac. City Code, supra, at\n§ 12.52.030.) A special event includes programs operated by the City, youth or school\nevents, marathons or other sporting events, and scouting activities. (Id. at § 12.52.050.)\nThe city manager may consider any facts bearing on the sanitary, health, safety, and\nwelfare conditions of the area where the proposed temporary camp or camp facility is to\nbe located in issuing a permit. (Ibid.) The city manager may impose conditions on the\nestablishment, maintenance and operation of the camp or camp facility, including\nconditions relating to security, sanitation facilities, the number of occupants, posting of\nbonds or deposits, insurance, quiet hours, duration of the permit, and permitted activities\non the premises. (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.070.) A permit may be revoked if\nthe city manager determines the maintenance or continuing operation of the camp or\ncamp facilities is adverse to the public health, safety, and welfare. (Ibid.)\n       The camping ordinance states it is intended “to maintain streets, parks and other\npublic and private areas within the city in a clean, sanitary and accessible condition and\n\n                                              5\n\fto adequately protect the health, safety and public welfare of the community, while\nrecognizing that, subject to reasonable conditions, camping and camp facilities associated\nwith special events can be beneficial to the cultural and educational climate in the city.”\n(Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.010.) The Sacramento City Council recognized that\n“[t]he streets and public areas within the city should be readily accessible and available to\nresidents and the public at large. The use of these areas for camping purposes or storage\nof personal property interferes with the rights of others to use the areas for which they\nwere intended. Such activity can constitute a public health and safety hazard which\nadversely impacts neighborhoods and commercial areas. Camping on private property\nwithout the consent of the owner, proper sanitary measures and for other than a minimal\nduration adversely affects private property rights as well as public health, safety, and\nwelfare of the city.” (Ibid.)\n       The ordinance is not intended “to interfere with otherwise lawful and ordinary\nuses of public or private property.” (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.010.) It does not\nprohibit or make unlawful “activities of an owner of private property or other lawful user\nof private property that are normally associated with and incidental to the lawful and\nauthorized use of private property for residential or other purposes” and “activities are\nexpressly authorized by the Planning and Development Code or other laws, ordinances\nand regulations.” (Id. at § 12.52.030.)\n       The complaint alleges the City enacted the camping ordinance to discriminate\nagainst homeless persons. It further alleges the City has a policy and practice of\ndissuading homeless persons from entering the City or, if within the City, to drive them\nout of the City by selectively enforcing the ordinance against the homeless, even when\nthey are living on private property with the property owner’s consent.\n       Pursuant to a lease agreement, the owner of a fenced lot in a light industrial area of\nthe City agreed in 2009 to allow plaintiffs to live and store personal property at the lot\nuntil they qualified for shelter. About 30 people set up tents and stored their property at\n\n                                              6\n\fthe lot with the owner’s written permission. Portable toilets were also moved onto the\nproperty.\n       On September 2, 2009, City police officers detained all persons at the lot, seized\nand removed plaintiffs’ personal property including tents, sleeping bags and personal\nitems, and cited the detainees for violating the camping ordinance. Alleging they had\nnowhere else to go, plaintiffs obtained more tents and sleeping bags and remained at the\nlot.\n       On September 4, 2009, police officers again detained and cited plaintiffs for\nviolating the camping ordinance. Police seized and removed the additional tents,\nsleeping bags and personal items at the lot. Once again alleging they had nowhere else to\ngo, plaintiffs obtained more tents, sleeping bags and personal items, and remained at the\nlot.\n       On September 12, 2009, police officers arrested plaintiffs for violating the\ncamping ordinance and seized the tents, sleeping bags, tarps and personal items found at\nthe lot. The complaint alleges plaintiffs have had to search for places to sleep on other\npublic or private properties because no shelter was available to them. Plaintiffs fear\narrest and the confiscation of their property. Some homeless persons, including one of\nthe plaintiffs, have died while sleeping outdoors.\n       The first cause of action of plaintiffs’ first amended complaint seeks a declaration\nthat the camping ordinance is unconstitutional on its face and also as applied to homeless\npersons residing on private property in the City with the consent of the owner when no\npublic or private shelter is available to them. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the\nordinance (1) targets and discriminates against the homeless in the same way the\nordinance in Parr v.

There was also a fourth cause of action which plaintiffs subsequently\nagreed to dismiss.\n       The trial court sustained the City’s demurrer to plaintiffs’ first, second and third\ncauses of action but granted leave to amend. Rather than filing a second amended\ncomplaint, however, plaintiffs agreed judgment could be entered against them in return\nfor the City’s agreement that plaintiffs could appeal.\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       When, as here, a demurrer to a complaint is sustained with leave to amend and the\nplaintiffs elect not to amend the complaint, the plaintiffs may test the validity of the order\nsustaining the demurrer by filing an appeal from the ensuing judgment of dismissal.\n(County of Santa Clara v.

(Tobe,\nsupra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1084.) Our analysis begins with the strong presumption that the\nordinance is constitutionally valid. (Id. at p. 1107; City of San Diego v.

(City of San Diego, supra, 216 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1504.)\n       Protections against vagueness are based on due process. To satisfy the\nconstitutional requirement of due process of law, a penal statute must (1) be sufficiently\ndefinite to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed, and (2) provide sufficiently\ndefinite guidelines for the police in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory\nenforcement. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1106-1107.) However, no more than a\nreasonable degree of certainty is required. (People ex rel. Gallo v.

(Id. at\npp. 660, fn. 1, 667 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 759, fn. 1, 763].) The Supreme Court recognized that\nthe State can regulate the use of narcotics. (Id. at p. 664 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 761].) But it\nsaid the challenged statute and its construction by the state courts criminalized the status\nof narcotic addiction, irrespective of whether the defendant ever used or possessed any\nnarcotic within the state or engaged in any antisocial behavior there. (Id. at p. 666 [8\nL.Ed.2d at p. 763].) The Supreme Court likened the challenged statute to one that made\nit a crime for a person to be mentally ill or a leper. (Ibid.)\n       Under Robinson, criminalizing the status of being addicted to narcotics violates\nthe Eighth Amendment, but punishing the conduct of using narcotics, even by a narcotics\naddict, is not impermissible punishment for status. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1105.)\n       About six years after Robinson, the United States Supreme Court considered an\nEighth Amendment challenge to a Texas statute that made it a crime to “ ‘get drunk or be\nfound in a state of intoxication in any public place.’ ” (Powell v. Texas (1968) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107750\"><a href=\"/opinion/107750/powell-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517, 532 [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107750\"><a href=\"/opinion/107750/powell-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Although the defendant was a\nchronic alcoholic, a plurality of the Supreme Court upheld the statute because it punished\nbehavior (being drunk in public) that society had an interest in preventing; it did not\npunish the defendant’s status. (Ibid.) The plurality refused to read Robinson as finding\nan Eighth Amendment violation based on an involuntary condition or a condition\noccasioned by compulsion. (Id. at p. 533 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 1268].) The plurality said\nsuch an interpretation of Robinson would lead to a slippery slope: “it is difficult to see\nany limiting principle that would serve to prevent this Court from becoming, under the\naegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards\nof criminal responsibility . . . .” (Ibid.) “If Leroy Powell cannot be convicted of public\nintoxication, it is difficult to see how a State can convict an individual for murder, if that\nindividual, while exhibiting normal behavior in all other respects, suffers from a\n\n                                              16\n\f‘compulsion’ to kill . . . .” (Id. at p. 534) The plurality said “[t]raditional common-law\nconcepts of personal accountability and essential considerations of federalism” led them\nto reject the proposition that criminal penalties may not be imposed for a condition the\ndefendant was powerless to change.

(Powell, supra, 392 U.S. at p.\n535 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 1269].)\n       In his concurring opinion in Powell, Justice White said it is not a crime to drink\nalcohol when the defendant has an irresistible compulsion to drink.

However, Justice\nWhite concluded the conviction should stand because there was no evidence the\ndefendant could not stay off the streets on the night in question or that his extreme\ndrunkenness sufficiently deprived him of his faculties that night. (Id. at pp. 552-554 [20\nL.Ed.2d at pp. 1278-1279].)\n       Some courts have interpreted Robinson and Powell as holding that the Eighth\nAmendment prohibits punishment of an act which is derivative of a person’s status or\ninvoluntary condition, i.e., that it violates the Eighth Amendment to punish an act which\nis an unavoidable consequence of a person’s status.

What constitutes a status “might\nelude perfect definition,” but factors such as the involuntary acquisition of the\ncharacteristic (including whether the characteristic was present at birth) and the degree to\nwhich a person has control over that characteristic determine whether a characteristic is a\nstatus. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1105.)\n       In Tobe, the California Supreme Court rejected the plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment\nclaim because it was not shown that the plaintiffs had no alternative to homelessness, to\nthe conduct that led them to homelessness, or to the violations under the ordinance.\n(Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1105-1106.) The Supreme Court reached that conclusion\ndespite evidence that on any given night at least 2,500 homeless persons in the city did\nnot have shelter beds available to them. (Id. at p. 1083.)\n       Here, the first amended complaint does not allege facts indicating that plaintiffs’\nhomelessness is a status. It alleges that the homeless plaintiffs had no shelter available to\nthem when City police officers detained and arrested them for violating the ordinance,\nbut it does not allege why plaintiffs had no shelter.

(Tobe, supra, 9\nCal.4th at p. 1105.)\n       While the Court in Robinson observed that narcotic addiction is an illness which\nmay be contracted innocently or involuntarily, it did not say involuntariness made\nnarcotic addiction a status for which a person cannot constitutionally be punished.\n(Robinson, supra, 370 U.S. at p. 667 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].) The Court focused instead\non whether the defendant committed a prohibited act. (Id. at p. 667 [8 L.Ed.2d at\np. 763].) That is our focus too. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455.)\n       Sacramento’s ordinance punishes the acts of camping, occupying camp facilities,\nand using camp paraphernalia, not homelessness. (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.030;\nLehr v. City of Sacramento, supra, 624 F.Supp.2d at p. 1231.) The ordinance is\ndistinguishable from the statute in Robinson, which criminalized the status of being\naddicted to narcotics and did not require any act by the defendant. (Robinson, supra,\n370 U.S. at p. 666 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].) Because the Eighth Amendment does not\nprohibit the punishment of acts (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1105; Lehr v. City of\nSacramento, supra, 624 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1232, 1234; People v. Kellogg, supra,\n119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 596, 602-604), plaintiffs’ challenge based on cruel and unusual\npunishment lacks merit.\n\n                                            19\n\f                                               2\n  Plaintiffs also claim the ordinance, as applied to them, infringes on their constitutional\nright to travel.\n       The right to freedom of travel is constitutionally protected. (Tobe, supra, 9\nCal.4th at pp. 1096-1100.) Even so, our state courts have found a violation of the\nconstitutional right of intrastate travel only when there is a direct restriction on the right\nto travel, such as where a parent is ordered to move to another county as a condition of\ncontinued custody of a child. (Id. at p. 1101.) Otherwise lawful ordinances that have an\nindirect or incidental impact on the right to travel and do not discriminate among classes\nof persons by penalizing the exercise of the right to travel are not constitutionally\nimpermissible. (Id. at p. 1100.)\n       While the camping ordinance might discourage some homeless persons from\ntraveling into the City, it does not directly restrict the right to travel. (Tobe, supra, 9\nCal.4th at p. 1102 [an ordinance that bans camping and storing personal possessions on\npublic property does not directly impede the right to travel]; Sanchez v.

They also allege, however, that they reside in the City,\nindicating that the camping ordinance did not bar their entry into the City if they traveled\nthere. While laws that use a classification that serves to penalize the exercise of the right\nto travel are unconstitutional (Sanchez, supra, 914 F.Supp.2d at p. 1109), the first\n\n                                               20\n\famended complaint does not allege the homeless plaintiffs were punished because they\nexercised their right to travel to Sacramento. The first amended complaint alleges\nplaintiffs were penalized for illegal camping.\n       Plaintiffs also complain that the City prevented them from remaining in particular\nareas within the City. However, the right to travel does not give plaintiffs the right to live\nor stay where they want. (Tobe, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 1103; see also Davison v.

But the Supreme\nCourt’s reasoning was not based on whether the ban applied to public or private property.\n(Id. at pp. 1096-1104.)\n       Plaintiffs also cite Pottinger, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court in that\ncase held the city’s enforcement of ordinances, such as those for loitering and for\nobstructing the sidewalk, significantly burdened the right of the homeless to travel. (Id.\nat pp. 1580-1581.) Subjecting the city’s enforcement activities to strict scrutiny, the\ndistrict court concluded the city’s interest in maintaining public areas and promoting\ntourism and business in its downtown area was not compelling, and its actions were not\n\n                                             21\n\fnarrowly tailored to achieve its objective of preventing health hazards. (Id. at pp. 1581-\n1582.)\n         Pottinger is not controlling for a number of reasons. The ordinances at issue in\nPottinger were broader in scope than the ordinance at issue in this case. (Pottinger,\nsupra, 810 F.Supp. at pp. 1554-1555 [homeless persons were punished for sleeping,\neating, standing and congregating in public places].) In addition, the cases cited in\nPottinger involved the grant or denial of benefits based on past residency or duration of\nresidency or laws that barred or expressly regulated travel. (Pottinger, supra, 810\nF.Supp. at pp. 1578-1580.) Such measures, which have been found to infringe on the\nfundamental right to travel, are not found in Sacramento’s ordinance. Moreover,\nPottinger has been rejected by other courts. (Sanchez, supra, 914 F.Supp.2d at p. 1111\n[the bulk of authority has rejected or declined to follow Pottinger’s right to travel holding\nin cases concerning policies designed to prevent homeless persons from erecting shelters\nand/or leaving their belongings in particular places]; Davison v.

(Id. at p. 1080,\nfn. 1.) Although the court in Tobe indicated that the Tobe plaintiffs “did not clearly\nallege” an as-applied challenge (id. at p. 1083), that was in a completely different\n\n                                              23\n\fprocedural posture. In those consolidated actions, the Zuckernick matter involved\npersons charged with violating an ordinance who demurred unsuccessfully to the criminal\ncomplaint and then filed a writ petition to compel the trial court to sustain their\ndemurrers. (Id. at pp. 1081-1082.) The Supreme Court held the procedural posture of\nthat action precluded an as-applied challenge. (Id. at p. 1083.) The Tobe matter involved\npersons who challenged enforcement of an ordinance by petition for writ of mandate and\nappealed the trial court’s order. (Id. at pp. 1081-1082.) The Supreme Court held the\nTobe plaintiffs did not clearly allege an as-applied challenge or seek relief from specific\nallegedly impermissible applications of the ordinance. (Id. at p. 1083.) Unlike in Tobe,\nthe plaintiffs in this case filed a civil complaint asserting an as-applied challenge, not a\npetition for writ of mandate or a demurrer to a criminal complaint.\n       Here, we conclude the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for\ndeclaratory relief asserting an as-applied challenge based on equal protection.

But once again, they do not provide any further explanation\nin their opening brief. Accordingly, the contention is forfeited for failure to support it\nwith argument or citation to authority. (Okasaki v. City of Elk Grove, supra, 203\nCal.App.4th at p. 1045, fn. 1; Keyes v.

Unlike in Sanchez, the applicable pleading in this case does not allege that\nthe City placed plaintiffs in a situation of known danger with deliberate indifference to\ntheir safety. Moreover, plaintiffs did not argue in the trial court that the first amended\ncomplaint states a substantive due process claim based on the “danger creation” doctrine.\n(Sanchez, supra, 914 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1101-1102 [discussing “danger creation”\ndoctrine].)\n\n                                             25\n\f                                              6\n       Plaintiffs claim the ordinance, as applied to them, violated their right to be free\nfrom vague laws. Once again, however, they forfeited this claim by failing to explain\nhow the ordinance is vague as applied to them. (Nelson v.

The claim also fails on the merits, because\nplaintiffs’ conduct clearly violated the ordinance. The ordinance prohibits placing or\noccupying tents on any private property for more than one consecutive night without a\nCity permit. (Sac. City Code, supra, at § 12.52.030.) The first amended complaint\nalleges that plaintiffs “continued to live” at a privately owned lot where they set up tents\nfor several days.\n                                              II\n       Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the second cause\nof action for an injunction. They say their failure to cite “California Civil Code section\n526(a)” should not foreclose their ability to seek injunctive relief. We assume they\nintended to reference Code of Civil Procedure section 526, subdivision (a).\n       In any event, we conclude the trial court did not err. The second cause of action\nseeks an order enjoining the enforcement of the ordinance. Injunctive relief is a remedy,\nnot a cause of action. (Roberts v. Los Angeles County Bar Assn.

(§ 52.1, subd. (a).)\n       We begin by noting what plaintiffs do not assert. The first amended complaint\ndoes not allege the use of excessive or unreasonable force by the police, and plaintiffs do\nnot contend on appeal that this is an excessive force case. Plaintiffs also do not claim on\nappeal that the first amended complaint alleges any intimidation by the City.\n       Rather, plaintiffs argue the first amended complaint alleges “threats” within the\nmeaning of section 52.1. Plaintiffs point to the allegations in paragraphs 4 and 10 of the\nfirst amended complaint that City police officers threatened to arrest homeless persons\nwho had gathered at two locations other than the lot plaintiffs leased in 2009 and also\nthreatened to confiscate their property. Even if we assume those allegations apply to\nplaintiffs, however, “[s]peech alone is not sufficient to support an action brought pursuant\nto [section 52.1] subdivision (a) or (b), except upon a showing that the speech itself\nthreatens violence against a specific person or group of persons; and the person or group\n\n\n\n\n6 Undesignated statutory references are to the Civil Code.\n\n\n                                              27\n\fof persons against whom the threat is directed reasonably fears that, because of the\nspeech, violence will be committed against them or their property and that the person\nthreatening violence had the apparent ability to carry out the threat.” (§ 52.1, subd. (j).)\nWhile plaintiffs say in their reply brief they had a reasonable belief violence would result\nshould they disobey the orders of the police officers, the first amended complaint does\nnot allege a police officer threatened any plaintiff with violence.\n       In addition, plaintiffs argue the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges\n“coercion” because City police officers arrested plaintiffs and an arrest is inherently\ncoercive. The first amended complaint alleges City police officers “forcibly detained”\npersons at the lot where plaintiffs lived, “forcibly detained and cited plaintiffs on the\nproperty . . . for illegal camping,” arrested plaintiffs for violating the ordinance,\n“coercively violated plaintiffs’ rights under the 4th and 14th Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution (namely, unreasonable search and seizure, violation of due process, and\nviolation of equal protection of the laws)” and “coercively interfered with the exercise\nand/or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution of the state of California, Article\n1, §§ 1, 7 and 13 (namely, unreasonable search and seizure, deprivation of life, liberty\nand property, without due process of law).” Plaintiffs say the actions of the police are\ninherently coercive because of their “unique position of trust” in society.\n       There are two distinct elements for a section 52.1 cause of action. A plaintiff must\nshow (1) intentional interference or attempted interference with a state or federal\nconstitutional or legal right, and (2) the interference or attempted interference was by\nthreats, intimidation or coercion.

(Longval, supra, 535 N.E.2d\nat p. 590.) The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled the use of force by prison officials in\nplacing a prisoner in the segregated unit does not constitute coercion under the\nMassachusetts Civil Rights Act, even if it turned out the prison officials had no lawful\nright to take that action. (Id. at pp. 590, 593.) The Court in Longval said conduct that\n“take[s] someone’s rights away directly,” even if unlawful, does not satisfy the\nrequirement of “threats, intimidation or coercion” under the Massachusetts Civil Rights\nAct.

(Gant, supra, 765 F.Supp.2d at p. 1253.)\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reversed the district court’s judgment in part\nbecause, as to one of the public entity defendants, the appellate court found a genuine\nissue of fact regarding whether police officers coerced the plaintiff to make an untrue\nstatement. (Gant v.

The\nNinth Circuit did not disagree with the district court’s interpretation of section 52.1, and\naffirmed the district court’s judgment as to the plaintiffs’ other section 52.1 claims in a\nseparately issued memorandum. (Id. at p. 623, fn. 1; Gant v. County of Los Angeles (9th\nCir. Nov. 24, 2014) 2014 U.S. App. Lexis 22192, at pp. *4, 9.)\n9 Like California, Massachusetts authorizes a personal right of action “[w]henever any\nperson or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interfere by threats,\nintimidation or coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, with\nthe exercise or enjoyment by any other person or persons of rights secured by the\nconstitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws\nof the commonwealth.” (Mass.

(Cf. Bender v. County of Los\nAngeles (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 978 [although coercion is inherent in any arrest,\nwhere an arrest is unlawful and excessive force is applied, there is coercion independent\nof the wrongful detention].) Consistent with Shoyoye, we conclude a wrongful arrest or\ndetention, without more, does not satisfy both elements of section 52.1. (Shoyoye, supra,\n203 Cal.App.4th at p. 960.) The conclusory allegations of “forcible” and “coercive”\ninterference with plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are inadequate to state a cause of action\nfor a violation of section 52.1. (Aubry v.
