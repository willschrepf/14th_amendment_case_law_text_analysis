INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiff Cherryl Bradley filed this lawsuit against her former employer, Defendant District\n\nof Columbia Public Schools (“DCPS”), asserting that Defendant failed to accommodate her\n\ndisability and wrongfully terminated her employment. Plaintiff initially brought six claims,\n\nincluding violation of her constitutional and statutory rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation in violation of federal and District of Columbia law, and constructive\n\ndischarge under District of Columbia law. The court dismissed her claims under section 1983 and\n\nthe District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act. See Bradley v. D.C. Pub. Sch., 87 F. Supp.\n\n3d 156 (D.D.C. 2015). The court now addresses Plaintiff’s remaining claims for discrimination\n\nand retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and the District of\n\nColumbia Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”).\n\n       This case is before the court in a unique posture—on Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment. Plaintiff therefore bears the heavy burden of showing that a reasonable jury could reach\n\fonly one conclusion based on the record evidence—that Defendant failed to reasonably\n\naccommodate her disability and terminated her because of her disability and request for reasonable\n\naccommodation. The court finds that Plaintiff has not satisfied this burden and, therefore, denies\n\nher Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\nII.    BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       Plaintiff Cherryl Bradley began work as a special education specialist for Defendant in\n\n2004. Pl.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 32-1 [hereinafter Pl.’s Mot.], at 1, 11;\n\nPl.’s Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts, ECF No. 32-2 [hereinafter Pl.’s Stmt.], ¶ 3; Def.’s Opp’n\n\nto Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. A, Def.’s Resp. to Pl.’s Stmt., ECF No. 35-2 [hereinafter Def.’s\n\nResp.], ¶¶ 3–4. In April 2009, while Plaintiff was substitute teaching, a student violently elbowed\n\nher in the chest, causing her serious injuries and preventing her from returning to work until\n\nJanuary 2010. Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 12–19; Def.’s Resp. ¶¶ 12–19.\n\n       About one year later, Defendant again assigned Plaintiff to substitute teach in a special\n\neducation classroom. Exposure to the students caused Plaintiff to flash back to the 2009 battery\n\nand gave her extreme anxiety. Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 20–24. Plaintiff sought medical assistance and was\n\ndiagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety, Depressed Mood, and Post-Traumatic\n\nStress Disorder. Pl.’s Mot. at 1; Def.’s Resp. ¶ 23.\n\n       In March 2011, Plaintiff sought disability compensation and sick leave. Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 25–\n\n28; Def.’s Resp. ¶ 27–28. After her claim went unaddressed, Plaintiff filed a formal charge of\n\ndiscrimination in July 2011 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against both\n\nDefendant and the District of Columbia Office of Risk Management, citing discriminatory\n\npractices with respect to her disability. See Receipt of Original Case File, ECF No. 2, Superior\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fCourt Documents, ECF No. 2-1 [hereinafter Super. Ct. Docs.], at 155–56 (Ex. BB, Charge of\n\nDiscrimination); Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 27–31, 45; Def.’s Resp. ¶¶ 27–31, 45. Eventually, in December\n\n2011, Defendant granted Plaintiff extended leave until March 4, 2012. Super. Ct. Docs. at 161–\n\n62 (Ex. HH, Letter from Erin K. Pitts to Cherryl Bradley (Dec. 6, 2011)); Pl.’s Stmt. ¶ 56; Def.’s\n\nResp. ¶ 56.\n\n       On April 10, 2012, Paul Webb, Manager of Staffing Services for Defendant, sent Plaintiff\n\na letter “regarding [her] return to work for DC Public Schools.” See Super. Ct. Docs. at 168 (Ex.\n\nLL, Letter from Paul Webb to Cherryl Bradley (Apr. 10, 2012)). Webb advised Plaintiff that “[t]he\n\nfirst step is obtaining the necessary background clearance. You are required to come in for\n\nfingerprinting . . . . Once your fingerprints have cleared, we can move forward with your\n\nplacement.” Id. The letter warned that the “[f]ailure to report for fingerprinting . . . will be taken\n\nas your voluntary resignation as an employee of DC Public Schools.” Id.\n\n       The same month, Plaintiff’s treating psychiatrist sent a letter to Defendant, stating that\n\nPlaintiff “currently cannot perform any of the job functions listed related to the job description\n\nuntil her anticipated recovery which can be anywhere between 4–6 months.” See id. at 169 (Ex.\n\nMM, Letter from Sheryl Neverson (Apr. 16, 2012)); Pl.’s Stmt. ¶ 62; Def.’s Resp. ¶ 62. The letter\n\nincluded a diagnosis form in which her physician opined that Plaintiff “needs to work on\n\nreasonable accommodations for her [to] return to work because returning to the position that she\n\nleft a year ago can further injur[e] [Plaintiff].” Super. Ct. Docs. at 171 (Ex. MM, Medical\n\nDiagnosis of Cherryl Bradley).\n\n       When Plaintiff did not appear at her scheduled fingerprinting appointment, DCPS\n\nterminated her. Id. at 172 (Ex. PP, Notification of Personnel Action); Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 64–66; Def.’s\n\nResp. ¶¶ 64, 66.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       B.      Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiff filed a Complaint in D.C. Superior Court in May 2014. Notice of Removal,\n\nECF No. 1, Pl.’s Compl., ECF. No. 1-2 [hereinafter Compl.], at 4–34. Plaintiff then filed an\n\nAmended Complaint in this court on September 22, 2014, alleging deprivation of her constitutional\n\nand statutory rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count I); discrimination and retaliation in\n\nviolation of the ADA and DCHRA (Counts II, III, IV, and V); and discharge in violation of the\n\nD.C. Administrative Procedure Act (Count VI). On April 3, 2015, the court dismissed Counts I\n\nand VI.     See Bradley, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 158.         Plaintiff thus has four remaining claims:\n\n(1) employment discrimination based on her disability under the ADA (Count II); (2) retaliation\n\nunder the ADA (Count III); (3) employment discrimination based on her disability under the\n\nDCHRA (Count IV); and (4) retaliation under the DCHRA (Count V).\n\n       Before the court is Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment. See Pl.’s Mot for Summ. J.,\n\nECF No. 32. Based on the undisputed material facts, she contends that a reasonable jury could\n\nreach only one conclusion—that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability and terminated\n\nher for exercising her protected rights under the ADA and DCHRA. See Pl.’s Mot. at 7, 19, 21.\n\nIn its opposition brief, Defendant argues that three disputed material facts—whether Plaintiff’s job\n\nrequired her to work in the classroom, whether Plaintiff sought an accommodation, and whether\n\nDefendant terminated Plaintiff for a discriminatory reason—preclude an entry of summary\n\njudgment in Plaintiff’s favor on any count. See Def.’s Opp’n at 2–3.\n\nIII.   LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a court should grant summary judgment\n\nif “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [the moving party] is entitled to judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fas a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(a). A material fact is one capable of affecting the outcome\n\nof litigation. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).\n\n       Rule 56 provides for a court to enter summary judgment “after adequate time for discovery\n\nand upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence\n\nof an element essential to that party’s case . . . on which that party will bear the burden of proof at\n\ntrial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). The party moving for summary\n\njudgment “bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion”\n\nand identifying those portions of the record that it believes “demonstrate the absence of a genuine\n\nissue of material fact.” Id. at 323.\n\n       Once the moving party has made an adequate showing that a fact cannot be disputed, the\n\nburden shifts to the party opposing summary judgment to “set forth specific facts showing that\n\nthere is a genuine issue for trial.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe nonmoving party may oppose the motion using “any of the kinds of evidentiary materials\n\nlisted in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves, and it is from this list that one would\n\nnormally expect the nonmoving party to make the showing to which [the Court has] referred.”\n\nCelotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324. “The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all\n\njustifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255 (citation omitted).\n\nHowever, “[t]o defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must offer more\n\nthan mere unsupported allegations or denials.” Dormu v. District of Columbia, 795 F. Supp. 2d 7,\n\n17 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324). In other words, if the non-movant’s evidence\n\nis “merely colorable” or “not significantly probative,” summary judgment may be granted.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 249–50. Summary judgment, then, is appropriate when the non-moving\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fparty fails to offer “evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant].” Id.\n\nat 252.\n\nIV.       DISCUSSION\n\n          Plaintiff’s four remaining claims fall into two categories: (1) denial of reasonable\n\naccommodation, in violation of Title I of the ADA (Count II) and the DCHRA (Count IV); and\n\n(2) retaliatory termination due to her disability and for engaging in protected activity, in violation\n\nof Title IV of the ADA (Count III) and the DCHRA (Count V). See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 112–14. The\n\ncourt considers each group of claims in turn.\n\n          A.       Plaintiff’s Reasonable Accommodation Claims\n\n          The ADA prohibits any covered employer from discriminating “against a qualified\n\nindividual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring,\n\nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms,\n\nconditions, and privileges of employment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). 1 Discrimination includes “not\n\nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise\n\n\n\n\n1\n Plaintiff also asserts her failure-to-accommodate claim under the DCHRA, see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 116–120, which\nmakes it unlawful for an employer:\n\n          [t]o fail or refuse to hire, or to discharge, any individual; or otherwise to discriminate against any\n          individual, with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n          including promotion; or to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would\n          deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect\n          his status as an employee.\n\nD.C. Code § 2-1402.11. The legal standards applicable to Plaintiff’s claims under the ADA and the DCHRA are the\nsame. See Giles v. Transit Employees Credit Union, 32 F. Supp. 3d 66, 70 (D.D.C. 2014) (“claims arising under the\n[DCHRA] are analyzed in the same manner as an ADA claim”) aff’d sub nom. Giles v. Transit Employees Fed. Credit\nUnion, 794 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 1171 (2016); Grant v. May Dep’t Stores Co., 786 A.2d\n580, 583–84 (D.C. 2001) (“We have considered decisions construing the ADA as persuasive in our decisions\nconstruing comparable sections of DCHRA”). The court thus considers Plaintiff’s claims under the ADA and the\nDCHRA in tandem.\n\n                                                            6\n\fqualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee.”                  42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12112(b)(5)(A).\n\n       To prevail on summary judgment on a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA,\n\nPlaintiff must show that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that: “(i) she was disabled\n\nwithin the meaning of the [ADA]; (ii) her employer had notice of her disability; (iii) she was able\n\nto perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation; and\n\n(iv) her employer denied her request for a reasonable accommodation of that disability.” Solomon\n\nv. Vilsack, 763 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citations omitted).\n\n       Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to summary judgment because “the undisputed facts\n\nshow that [she] is a person with a disability who was able to perform the essential functions of her\n\njob, that the School District was on notice of [her] disability and that the School District denied\n\nher request for reasonable accommodation, thereby discriminating against her.” Pl.’s Mot. at 7.\n\nAccordingly, Plaintiff argues, she satisfies all four requirements for summary judgment to be\n\nentered in her favor.\n\n       Defendant concedes that Plaintiff was a person with a qualifying disability during the\n\nrelevant period. It contends, however, that summary judgment is inappropriate because there is a\n\ngenuine dispute of fact as to whether Plaintiff’s disability rendered her unable to work in the\n\nclassroom, which Defendant asserts is an “essential function of a special education specialist.”\n\nDef.’s Opp’n at 4–5; Def.’s Stmt. of Material Facts in Dispute, ECF No. 35-3 [hereinafter Def.’s\n\nStmt.], ¶ 2. Plaintiff, for her part, does not counter that she would have been able to perform\n\nclassroom duties had she been given reasonable accommodation. Instead, Plaintiff maintains that\n\nthe essential functions of her job were to “create programs, instructions, prepare reports, conduct\n\nresearch, etc.[,] in order to assist special education teachers”—not to be in a classroom. Pl.’s Reply\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fto Def.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 37 [hereinafter Pl.’s Reply], at 6. According to Plaintiff, because\n\nteaching in a classroom is not an essential function of her position, her inability to teach in a\n\nclassroom even with reasonable accommodation is not fatal to her claim.\n\n        Both sides point to a single piece of evidence to support their respective positions—the\n\nwritten job description for a special education specialist. See Super. Ct. Docs. at 195 (Ex. VV, Job\n\nDescription—Special Education Specialist); Def’s Stmt. ¶ 1; Pl.’s Reply at 3–6. That job\n\ndescription consists of a list of 16 bullet-pointed responsibilities. Id. The sixteenth bullet-point\n\nstates as follows: “[T]he Special Education Specialist . . . [p]erforms other duties as assigned to\n\ninclude but not limited to . . . substitute teaching or modeling effective specialized instruction in\n\nspecial education classrooms and programs[.]”           Super. Ct. Docs. at 195 (Ex. VV, Job\n\nDescription—Special Education Specialist) (emphasis added).\n\n        Plaintiff insists that, notwithstanding the plain inclusion of substitute teaching within the\n\nrelevant job description, classroom work is not an essential function of the position. See Pl.’s\n\nReply, at 4–6. Her argument rests solely on the text of the job description itself. She asserts that\n\nthe order in which the job duties are listed—with developing programs, preparing reports, and\n\nconducting research placed near the top of the list, and substitute teaching listed at the bottom—\n\ncorresponds to the essential nature of each duty. Id. Put another way, Plaintiff argues that it would\n\nstrain credibility to find that the sixteenth most important job function could possibly be considered\n\n“essential.” She also contends that the “or” separating “substitute teaching” and “modeling\n\neffective specialized instruction in special education classrooms and programs” allows for\n\nemployees to choose either to substitute teach or model effective instruction outside of the\n\nclassroom, further supporting her contention that teaching is not an essential function of her job.\n\nId. at 5.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f         The problem with Plaintiff’s argument, however, is that it is premised on the wholly\n\nspeculative assumption that where a particular responsibility or function appears within the bullet-\n\npointed list equates to its centrality to the job. There is no evidence on the record to support that\n\nassumption. Plaintiff could have offered testimonial evidence from someone in a position to\n\ninterpret the relative importance of special education specialist’s job duties, but she did not do so.\n\nIndeed, the written job description could support the equally plausible inference that each of the\n\nbullet points constitutes an essential part of the position and that the sequence is wholly irrelevant.\n\nAbsent any testimony about how the job description applies in practice, there exists a genuine\n\ndispute of fact about whether classroom work is an essential part of the job. Accordingly, the court\n\ncannot conclude that, as a matter of law, Plaintiff was denied reasonable accommodation for her\n\ndisability. Summary judgment is denied as to Plaintiff’s failure-to-accommodate claims. 2\n\n         B.        Claims Arising Out of Plaintiff’s Termination\n\n         Turning to Plaintiff’s retaliation claims, Plaintiff puts forward two theories of liability\n\narising out of her termination. First, she claims that Defendant fired her because of her disability.\n\nPl.’s Mot. at 11–13. Second, she maintains that Defendant terminated her because she exercised\n\nher right to seek reasonable accommodation. Id. at 21. Defendant counters that it did not terminate\n\nPlaintiff for either asserted reason, and instead claims that it terminated Plaintiff for a legitimate\n\nreason—Plaintiff’s failure to show up for fingerprinting. See Def.’s Opp’n at 6.\n\n         The Court of Appeals has made clear that once, as here, an employer provides a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory or nonretaliatory reason for an adverse employment action, the court is left with\n\n“one central inquiry” on summary judgment. Adeyemi v. District of Columbia, 525 F.3d 1222,\n\n\n2\n  Defendant also maintains that granting summary judgment would be improper because there is a genuine dispute as\nto whether Plaintiff ever requested reasonable accommodation. Def.’s Opp’n at 3. Because the court finds there is a\ngenuine dispute of material fact about the essential functions of Plaintiff’s job, the court need not reach this alternative\nground.\n\n                                                             9\n\f1226 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Ordinarily, because the employer is the movant, that inquiry is “whether\n\nthe employee produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer’s\n\nasserted nondiscriminatory or non-retaliatory reason was not the actual reason and that the\n\nemployer intentionally discriminated or retaliated against the employee.” Allen v. Johnson, 795\n\nF.3d 34, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (alterations adopted and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the\n\ncentral inquiry differs slightly because the employee is the movant. Accordingly, the court must\n\nask whether, based on all the record evidence, a reasonable jury could reach no conclusion other\n\nthan that the employer’s stated reason was not the actual reason for the plaintiff’s termination and\n\nthat, in fact, the employer “intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on a prohibited basis.”\n\nAdeyemi, 525 F.3d at 1226.\n\n        Framed in that way, the burden that Plaintiff faces here is a heavy one, and she has not met\n\nit.   Determining the true reason or cause for Plaintiff’s firing demands an examination of\n\nDefendant’s intent—and “intent is a quintessential jury question.”           See SEC v. Johnson,\n\n525 F. Supp. 2d 70, 78 (D.D.C. 2007). Plaintiff argues that the proximity in time between her\n\nprotected activity and the adverse employment action alone establishes the causation required for\n\na retaliation claim. Pl.’s Mot. at 19–21. But the Court of Appeals has held that, when an employer\n\nmoves for summary judgment, the temporal proximity between an employee’s protected activity\n\nand an adverse employment action is not enough to enable the plaintiff to defeat summary\n\njudgment. See Minter v. District of Columbia, 809 F.3d 66, 71–72 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (stating that\n\n“when an employer comes forward with a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for an employment\n\naction, positive evidence beyond mere proximity is required to create a genuine issue of material\n\nfact” about the employer’s motive for taking the adverse action (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).

INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiff Cherryl Bradley filed this lawsuit against her former employer, Defendant District\n\nof Columbia Public Schools (“DCPS”), asserting that Defendant failed to accommodate her\n\ndisability and wrongfully terminated her employment. Plaintiff initially brought six claims,\n\nincluding violation of her constitutional and statutory rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation in violation of federal and District of Columbia law, and constructive\n\ndischarge under District of Columbia law. The court dismissed her claims under section 1983 and\n\nthe District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act. See Bradley v. D.C. Pub. Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 156 (D.D.C. 2015). The court now addresses Plaintiff’s remaining claims for discrimination\n\nand retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and the District of\n\nColumbia Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”).\n\n       This case is before the court in a unique posture—on Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment. Plaintiff therefore bears the heavy burden of showing that a reasonable jury could reach\n\fonly one conclusion based on the record evidence—that Defendant failed to reasonably\n\naccommodate her disability and terminated her because of her disability and request for reasonable\n\naccommodation. The court finds that Plaintiff has not satisfied this burden and, therefore, denies\n\nher Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\nII.    BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       Plaintiff Cherryl Bradley began work as a special education specialist for Defendant in\n\n2004. Pl.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 32-1 [hereinafter Pl.’s Mot.], at 1, 11;\n\nPl.’s Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts, ECF No. 32-2 [hereinafter Pl.’s Stmt.], ¶ 3; Def.’s Opp’n\n\nto Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. A, Def.’s Resp. to Pl.’s Stmt., ECF No. 35-2 [hereinafter Def.’s\n\nResp.], ¶¶ 3–4. In April 2009, while Plaintiff was substitute teaching, a student violently elbowed\n\nher in the chest, causing her serious injuries and preventing her from returning to work until\n\nJanuary 2010. Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 12–19; Def.’s Resp. ¶¶ 12–19.\n\n       About one year later, Defendant again assigned Plaintiff to substitute teach in a special\n\neducation classroom. Exposure to the students caused Plaintiff to flash back to the 2009 battery\n\nand gave her extreme anxiety. Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 20–24. Plaintiff sought medical assistance and was\n\ndiagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety, Depressed Mood, and Post-Traumatic\n\nStress Disorder. Pl.’s Mot. at 1; Def.’s Resp. ¶ 23.\n\n       In March 2011, Plaintiff sought disability compensation and sick leave. Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 25–\n\n28; Def.’s Resp. ¶ 27–28. After her claim went unaddressed, Plaintiff filed a formal charge of\n\ndiscrimination in July 2011 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against both\n\nDefendant and the District of Columbia Office of Risk Management, citing discriminatory\n\npractices with respect to her disability. See Receipt of Original Case File, ECF No. 2, Superior\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fCourt Documents, ECF No. 2-1 [hereinafter Super. Ct. Docs.], at 155–56 (Ex. BB, Charge of\n\nDiscrimination); Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 27–31, 45; Def.’s Resp. ¶¶ 27–31, 45. Eventually, in December\n\n2011, Defendant granted Plaintiff extended leave until March 4, 2012. Super. Ct. Docs. at 161–\n\n62 (Ex. HH, Letter from Erin K. Pitts to Cherryl Bradley (Dec. 6, 2011)); Pl.’s Stmt. ¶ 56; Def.’s\n\nResp. ¶ 56.\n\n       On April 10, 2012, Paul Webb, Manager of Staffing Services for Defendant, sent Plaintiff\n\na letter “regarding [her] return to work for DC Public Schools.” See Super. Ct. Docs. at 168 (Ex.\n\nLL, Letter from Paul Webb to Cherryl Bradley (Apr. 10, 2012)). Webb advised Plaintiff that “[t]he\n\nfirst step is obtaining the necessary background clearance. You are required to come in for\n\nfingerprinting . . . . Once your fingerprints have cleared, we can move forward with your\n\nplacement.” Id. The letter warned that the “[f]ailure to report for fingerprinting . . . will be taken\n\nas your voluntary resignation as an employee of DC Public Schools.” Id.\n\n       The same month, Plaintiff’s treating psychiatrist sent a letter to Defendant, stating that\n\nPlaintiff “currently cannot perform any of the job functions listed related to the job description\n\nuntil her anticipated recovery which can be anywhere between 4–6 months.” See id. at 169 (Ex.\n\nMM, Letter from Sheryl Neverson (Apr. 16, 2012)); Pl.’s Stmt. ¶ 62; Def.’s Resp. ¶ 62. The letter\n\nincluded a diagnosis form in which her physician opined that Plaintiff “needs to work on\n\nreasonable accommodations for her [to] return to work because returning to the position that she\n\nleft a year ago can further injur[e] [Plaintiff].” Super. Ct. Docs. at 171 (Ex. MM, Medical\n\nDiagnosis of Cherryl Bradley).\n\n       When Plaintiff did not appear at her scheduled fingerprinting appointment, DCPS\n\nterminated her. Id. at 172 (Ex. PP, Notification of Personnel Action); Pl.’s Stmt. ¶¶ 64–66; Def.’s\n\nResp. ¶¶ 64, 66.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       B.      Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiff filed a Complaint in D.C. Superior Court in May 2014. Notice of Removal,\n\nECF No. 1, Pl.’s Compl., ECF. No. 1-2 [hereinafter Compl.], at 4–34. Plaintiff then filed an\n\nAmended Complaint in this court on September 22, 2014, alleging deprivation of her constitutional\n\nand statutory rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count I); discrimination and retaliation in\n\nviolation of the ADA and DCHRA (Counts II, III, IV, and V); and discharge in violation of the\n\nD.C. Administrative Procedure Act (Count VI). On April 3, 2015, the court dismissed Counts I\n\nand VI.     See Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 158.         Plaintiff thus has four remaining claims:\n\n(1) employment discrimination based on her disability under the ADA (Count II); (2) retaliation\n\nunder the ADA (Count III); (3) employment discrimination based on her disability under the\n\nDCHRA (Count IV); and (4) retaliation under the DCHRA (Count V).\n\n       Before the court is Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment. See Pl.’s Mot for Summ. J.,\n\nECF No. 32. Based on the undisputed material facts, she contends that a reasonable jury could\n\nreach only one conclusion—that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability and terminated\n\nher for exercising her protected rights under the ADA and DCHRA. See Pl.’s Mot. at 7, 19, 21.\n\nIn its opposition brief, Defendant argues that three disputed material facts—whether Plaintiff’s job\n\nrequired her to work in the classroom, whether Plaintiff sought an accommodation, and whether\n\nDefendant terminated Plaintiff for a discriminatory reason—preclude an entry of summary\n\njudgment in Plaintiff’s favor on any count. See Def.’s Opp’n at 2–3.\n\nIII.   LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a court should grant summary judgment\n\nif “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [the moving party] is entitled to judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fas a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(a). A material fact is one capable of affecting the outcome\n\nof litigation. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1986).\n\n       Rule 56 provides for a court to enter summary judgment “after adequate time for discovery\n\nand upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence\n\nof an element essential to that party’s case . . . on which that party will bear the burden of proof at\n\ntrial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322 (1986). The party moving for summary\n\njudgment “bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion”\n\nand identifying those portions of the record that it believes “demonstrate the absence of a genuine\n\nissue of material fact.” Id. at 323.\n\n       Once the moving party has made an adequate showing that a fact cannot be disputed, the\n\nburden shifts to the party opposing summary judgment to “set forth specific facts showing that\n\nthere is a genuine issue for trial.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe nonmoving party may oppose the motion using “any of the kinds of evidentiary materials\n\nlisted in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings themselves, and it is from this list that one would\n\nnormally expect the nonmoving party to make the showing to which [the Court has] referred.”\n\nCelotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324. “The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all\n\njustifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255 (citation omitted).\n\nHowever, “[t]o defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must offer more\n\nthan mere unsupported allegations or denials.” Dormu v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2115058\"><a href=\"/opinion/2115058/dormu-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n17 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324). In other words, if the non-movant’s evidence\n\nis “merely colorable” or “not significantly probative,” summary judgment may be granted.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 249–50. Summary judgment, then, is appropriate when the non-moving\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fparty fails to offer “evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant].” Id.\n\nat 252.\n\nIV.       DISCUSSION\n\n          Plaintiff’s four remaining claims fall into two categories: (1) denial of reasonable\n\naccommodation, in violation of Title I of the ADA (Count II) and the DCHRA (Count IV); and\n\n(2) retaliatory termination due to her disability and for engaging in protected activity, in violation\n\nof Title IV of the ADA (Count III) and the DCHRA (Count V). See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 112–14. The\n\ncourt considers each group of claims in turn.\n\n          A.       Plaintiff’s Reasonable Accommodation Claims\n\n          The ADA prohibits any covered employer from discriminating “against a qualified\n\nindividual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring,\n\nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms,\n\nconditions, and privileges of employment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). 1 Discrimination includes “not\n\nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise\n\n\n\n\n1\n Plaintiff also asserts her failure-to-accommodate claim under the DCHRA, see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 116–120, which\nmakes it unlawful for an employer:\n\n          [t]o fail or refuse to hire, or to discharge, any individual; or otherwise to discriminate against any\n          individual, with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n          including promotion; or to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would\n          deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect\n          his status as an employee.\n\nD.C. Code § 2-1402.11. The legal standards applicable to Plaintiff’s claims under the ADA and the DCHRA are the\nsame. See Giles v. Transit Employees Credit Union, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70 (D.D.C. 2014) (“claims arising under the\n[DCHRA] are analyzed in the same manner as an ADA claim”) aff’d sub nom.

The court thus considers Plaintiff’s claims under the ADA and the\nDCHRA in tandem.\n\n                                                            6\n\fqualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee.”                  42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12112(b)(5)(A).\n\n       To prevail on summary judgment on a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA,\n\nPlaintiff must show that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that: “(i) she was disabled\n\nwithin the meaning of the [ADA]; (ii) her employer had notice of her disability; (iii) she was able\n\nto perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation; and\n\n(iv) her employer denied her request for a reasonable accommodation of that disability.” Solomon\n\nv. Vilsack, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citations omitted).\n\n       Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to summary judgment because “the undisputed facts\n\nshow that [she] is a person with a disability who was able to perform the essential functions of her\n\njob, that the School District was on notice of [her] disability and that the School District denied\n\nher request for reasonable accommodation, thereby discriminating against her.” Pl.’s Mot. at 7.\n\nAccordingly, Plaintiff argues, she satisfies all four requirements for summary judgment to be\n\nentered in her favor.\n\n       Defendant concedes that Plaintiff was a person with a qualifying disability during the\n\nrelevant period. It contends, however, that summary judgment is inappropriate because there is a\n\ngenuine dispute of fact as to whether Plaintiff’s disability rendered her unable to work in the\n\nclassroom, which Defendant asserts is an “essential function of a special education specialist.”\n\nDef.’s Opp’n at 4–5; Def.’s Stmt. of Material Facts in Dispute, ECF No. 35-3 [hereinafter Def.’s\n\nStmt.], ¶ 2. Plaintiff, for her part, does not counter that she would have been able to perform\n\nclassroom duties had she been given reasonable accommodation. Instead, Plaintiff maintains that\n\nthe essential functions of her job were to “create programs, instructions, prepare reports, conduct\n\nresearch, etc.[,] in order to assist special education teachers”—not to be in a classroom. Pl.’s Reply\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fto Def.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 37 [hereinafter Pl.’s Reply], at 6. According to Plaintiff, because\n\nteaching in a classroom is not an essential function of her position, her inability to teach in a\n\nclassroom even with reasonable accommodation is not fatal to her claim.\n\n        Both sides point to a single piece of evidence to support their respective positions—the\n\nwritten job description for a special education specialist. See Super. Ct. Docs. at 195 (Ex. VV, Job\n\nDescription—Special Education Specialist); Def’s Stmt. ¶ 1; Pl.’s Reply at 3–6. That job\n\ndescription consists of a list of 16 bullet-pointed responsibilities. Id. The sixteenth bullet-point\n\nstates as follows: “[T]he Special Education Specialist . . . [p]erforms other duties as assigned to\n\ninclude but not limited to . . . substitute teaching or modeling effective specialized instruction in\n\nspecial education classrooms and programs[.]”           Super. Ct. Docs. at 195 (Ex. VV, Job\n\nDescription—Special Education Specialist) (emphasis added).\n\n        Plaintiff insists that, notwithstanding the plain inclusion of substitute teaching within the\n\nrelevant job description, classroom work is not an essential function of the position. See Pl.’s\n\nReply, at 4–6. Her argument rests solely on the text of the job description itself. She asserts that\n\nthe order in which the job duties are listed—with developing programs, preparing reports, and\n\nconducting research placed near the top of the list, and substitute teaching listed at the bottom—\n\ncorresponds to the essential nature of each duty. Id. Put another way, Plaintiff argues that it would\n\nstrain credibility to find that the sixteenth most important job function could possibly be considered\n\n“essential.” She also contends that the “or” separating “substitute teaching” and “modeling\n\neffective specialized instruction in special education classrooms and programs” allows for\n\nemployees to choose either to substitute teach or model effective instruction outside of the\n\nclassroom, further supporting her contention that teaching is not an essential function of her job.\n\nId. at 5.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f         The problem with Plaintiff’s argument, however, is that it is premised on the wholly\n\nspeculative assumption that where a particular responsibility or function appears within the bullet-\n\npointed list equates to its centrality to the job. There is no evidence on the record to support that\n\nassumption. Plaintiff could have offered testimonial evidence from someone in a position to\n\ninterpret the relative importance of special education specialist’s job duties, but she did not do so.\n\nIndeed, the written job description could support the equally plausible inference that each of the\n\nbullet points constitutes an essential part of the position and that the sequence is wholly irrelevant.\n\nAbsent any testimony about how the job description applies in practice, there exists a genuine\n\ndispute of fact about whether classroom work is an essential part of the job. Accordingly, the court\n\ncannot conclude that, as a matter of law, Plaintiff was denied reasonable accommodation for her\n\ndisability. Summary judgment is denied as to Plaintiff’s failure-to-accommodate claims. 2\n\n         B.        Claims Arising Out of Plaintiff’s Termination\n\n         Turning to Plaintiff’s retaliation claims, Plaintiff puts forward two theories of liability\n\narising out of her termination. First, she claims that Defendant fired her because of her disability.\n\nPl.’s Mot. at 11–13. Second, she maintains that Defendant terminated her because she exercised\n\nher right to seek reasonable accommodation. Id. at 21. Defendant counters that it did not terminate\n\nPlaintiff for either asserted reason, and instead claims that it terminated Plaintiff for a legitimate\n\nreason—Plaintiff’s failure to show up for fingerprinting. See Def.’s Opp’n at 6.\n\n         The Court of Appeals has made clear that once, as here, an employer provides a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory or nonretaliatory reason for an adverse employment action, the court is left with\n\n“one central inquiry” on summary judgment. Adeyemi v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187159\"><a href=\"/opinion/187159/adeyemi-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n2\n  Defendant also maintains that granting summary judgment would be improper because there is a genuine dispute as\nto whether Plaintiff ever requested reasonable accommodation. Def.’s Opp’n at 3. Because the court finds there is a\ngenuine dispute of material fact about the essential functions of Plaintiff’s job, the court need not reach this alternative\nground.\n\n                                                             9\n\f1226 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Ordinarily, because the employer is the movant, that inquiry is “whether\n\nthe employee produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer’s\n\nasserted nondiscriminatory or non-retaliatory reason was not the actual reason and that the\n\nemployer intentionally discriminated or retaliated against the employee.” Allen v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (alterations adopted and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the\n\ncentral inquiry differs slightly because the employee is the movant. Accordingly, the court must\n\nask whether, based on all the record evidence, a reasonable jury could reach no conclusion other\n\nthan that the employer’s stated reason was not the actual reason for the plaintiff’s termination and\n\nthat, in fact, the employer “intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on a prohibited basis.”\n\nAdeyemi, 525 F.3d at 1226.\n\n        Framed in that way, the burden that Plaintiff faces here is a heavy one, and she has not met\n\nit.   Determining the true reason or cause for Plaintiff’s firing demands an examination of\n\nDefendant’s intent—and “intent is a quintessential jury question.”           See SEC v. Johnson,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1692122\"><a href=\"/opinion/1692122/sec-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (D.D.C. 2007). Plaintiff argues that the proximity in time between her\n\nprotected activity and the adverse employment action alone establishes the causation required for\n\na retaliation claim. Pl.’s Mot. at 19–21. But the Court of Appeals has held that, when an employer\n\nmoves for summary judgment, the temporal proximity between an employee’s protected activity\n\nand an adverse employment action is not enough to enable the plaintiff to defeat summary\n\njudgment. See Minter v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71–72 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (stating that\n\n“when an employer comes forward with a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for an employment\n\naction, positive evidence beyond mere proximity is required to create a genuine issue of material\n\nfact” about the employer’s motive for taking the adverse action (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)). If mere temporal proximity is insufficient to overcome an employer’s motion for\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fsummary judgment, then it certainly is not enough to enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of\n\na plaintiff.\n\n        Therefore, the court denies Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment on her\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation claims.\n\nV.      CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the court denies Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n\n\n\nDated: November 1, 2016                             Amit P. Mehta\n                                                    United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f</pre>",
